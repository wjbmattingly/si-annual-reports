JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

WASHINGTON, January 12, 1887.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution fixing the time of the annual session on the second
Wednesday in January of each year, the Board met this day at 10:30
o’clock A. M.

Present: The Chancellor, Chief-Justice MoRRISON R. WAITE; Hon.
JOHN SHERMAN, Hon. JusTIN S. MorRILL, Hon. SHELBY M. CULLOM,
Hon. OTno R. SINGLETON, Hon. WILLIAM W. PHELPS, Dr. ASA GRAY,
Dr. HENRY CoPpPpbeE, Dr. JAMES C. WELLING, General MONTGOMERY -
C. MEIGS, and the Secretary, Prof. SPENCER IF’. BAIRD.

Excuses for non-attendance were read from Dr. NoAH PORTER and
Hon. WILLIAM L. WILSON.

The Chancellor announced that since the last meeting of the Board
one of its most valued and eminent members had deceased, Rev. Dr.
JOHN MACLEAN, of Princeton, N. J.; whereupon Dr. Welling, chair-
man of the Executive Committee, offered the following:

THE LATE DR. MACLEAN.

I trust that without too much presumption I may venture to offer a
brief minute in humble tribute to the memory of our honored and la-
mented colleague, the late Dr. Maclean, not because I chance to hold the
place he lately filled with so much dignity and usefulness on your Ex-
ecutive Committee, but because it is perhaps my good fortune to have
known that venerable man for a longer period than has fallen to the lot
of any other member of this Board. And yet I do not come with any
words of formal eulogium. This is not the hour and this is not the
place in which to essay anything like an elaborate delineation of the
character which was expressed in the life and services of our late dis-
tinguished friend, a character no less remarkable for its beauty than
for its strength.

The memoir of his long and useful career has already been written else-
where in the record of a well-spent life, dedicated to the glory of God and
the welfare of man. It is written in the annals of the great College,
whose story he has told so well that for all the sons of Princeton it must
remain ‘a possession forever,” and which he was called to serve in every

XI
XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

post of duty and honor, from the humblest to the highest, rising by
easy gradations, because by a natural ascent, from the chair of Tutor
to that of Professor, from the chair of Professor to that of Vice-Presi-
dent, and from the chair of Vice-President to the honors of the Presi-
dency in a critical period, when he was able to lay broad and deep the
solid foundations on which others have builded. It is written in the
anvals of the Church to which he gave his sincere adhesion, whose pul-
pit he adorned no less by the sanctity of his life than by the steadfast-
ness of his faith, and for the defense of whose doctrine and order he was
called again and again to stand in its courts of highest judicature. It
is written in the annals of the Smithsonian Institution, for whose pros-
perity he was willing to spend and be spent till the last day of his
mortal career. And above all it is written in the pious recollections of
a countless host of scholarly men, scattered in all parts of the land, who
from year to year went forth from Nassau Hall carrying with them the
name and memory of John Maclean embalmed in their hearts by a
thousand acts of kindness and of love which transmuted the temporary
ties of academic relation into ‘‘ hooks of steel,” binding to him a suc-
cessive swarm of youth during two generations of men.

Of the ripeness and range of Dr. Maclean’s scholarship tliere is no
room to speak within the limits of this brief chronicle. He preferred
to read the Bible of the old dispensation in the original Hebrew, not
only that he might get as near as possible to “the lively oracles of
God,” but because Hebrew was to him a familiar tongue. In the Greek
language and literature he was a master and for long years an expert
professor. The Latin tongue he wrote with a facility and grace which
caused his pen to be put in frequent requisition whenever, for the pur-
poses of academic disquisition, a draught was to be made on the stately
speech of ancient Rome. As a preacher, he was sound and logical.
As a teacher, he was solid and thorough, looking rather to the substance
than the form of his instruction. As an executive officer, he had that
““wisdom of business” which Lord Bacon praises, because he never
sought an end which he did not believe to be right, and therefore he
was able to pursue all the ends he aimed at with the directness in-
spired by a clear intelligence and a pure heart. In all things he was
the very soul of Christian honor.

Great and good as teacher, preacher, and ruler, the man in Dr. Mae-
lean was something greater, better, and broader than any of the forms
or manifestations under which he was officially called to reveal himself
in the performance of his public functions. The man should always be
greater than the functionary. As the altar which sanctifies the gift is
greater than any gift that ean be laid upon it, so Dr. Maclean was
greater in the sweetness and light of his gentle and candid nature than
was apparent to those who never knew the “hidden man of the heart;”
for high and holy as were his gifts in the sigat of men, those gifts re-

ceived their best consecration from the altar of the sanctified manhood
on which he reverently laid them.
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XIII

Under the inspiration of these sentiments, I respectfully submit the
following resolutions:

Whereas, since the date of the last meeting of the Board of Re-
gents of the Smithsonian Institution, its members have been called to
mourn the loss of their venerable and distinguished colleague, the late
Rey. John Maclean, D. D., LL. D., sometime President of Princeton
College, who held the office of Regent for the term of eighteen years,
during seventeen of which he served on its Executive Committee with
no less credit to himself than usefulness to the Institution: Therefore,
be it

Resolved, That with a high appreciation of the varied, abundant, and
intelligent labors which the late Dr. Maclean brought to the cause of cul-
ture, of truth, and of righteousness throughout the whole of his long,
useful, and honorable career; with a grateful sense of the manifold.
services he rendered to the Smithsonian Institution, for whose welfare
he worked without weariness and watched without flagging, even after
he had begun to feel the burden of age; with profound sorrow for his
death, mingled with reverence for his beautiful memory, and with
thanksgivings for the serene and peaceful close of a finished life, as full
of years as it was full of honors, we hereby testify and record our ad-
miration of the exalted Christian character with which he dignified and
adorned every station that he was called to hold in the eyes of men;
our respect for the solidity of the learning which supported him in the
high discharge of every professional duty, whether in the pulpit, the
academic chair, or the post of executive administration; and lastly,
in special recognition of the grateful savor which his genial presence
never failed to shed on the deliberations of this council-chamber, our
cheerful and loyal homage to the dignity of bearing and amenity of
manners which made him as courteous in debate as he was wise in coun-
Sel, as gracious in all the relations of private life as he was inflexible in
the maintenance of Christian honor and conscientious in the perform-
ance of public duty.

Resolved, That this preamble and resolution be spread on the min-
utes of the Board in respectful tribute to the services and memory of
our venerated colleague, and that a copy of these resolutions be trans-
mitted to the family of our deceased friend in token of the share we
fain would take with them in this bereavement.

The resolutions were unanimously adopted by a rising vote.

The Chancellor announced the election, by joint resolution of Con-
gress, of Dr. James B. Angell, President of the University of Michi-
gan, to fill the vacancy in the Board occasioned by the death of Dr.
Maclean.

The annual report of the Executive Committee for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1886, was presented by its chairman, Dr. Welling, who
Stated that it gave him pleasure to inform the Board that his colleagues,
Dr. Coppée and General Meigs, and himself, after making a thorough
and minute examination of the accounts, looking at every voucher and
verifying the books and certificates, had not found a single error of
omission or commission, and he was therefore able to say that there was
the most gratifying evidence of the efficiency of the financial manage-
XIV JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

ment of the Institution, a fact especially noteworthy when the great
magnitude and the variety of its transactions are considered.

He also called attention to a slight change in the form of the report,
as now presented, from the reports lately presented to the Board. It
was, however, a recurrence to the old practice, which had been changed
a few years ago at the suggestion of a former member of the committee.
It is the custom of the Institution every year to make advances for cer-
tain operations, which are subsequently refunded, and these advances,
with the amounts received from sales of publications, re-payments for
freight, etc., have been deducted from the gross expenditures. The
statements in the report of the Executive Committee, as recently com-
piled, gave only the net or actual outlay from the income of the
Smithson fund. But now it is thought better to spread the actual ag-
gregate of these transactions on the record, so as to exhibit the full
magnitude and distinctive nature of the operations. A statement is
therefore made in the present report of the Executive Committee under
the head of “ Receipts for conducting special researches and collections,”
and ‘* Repayments,” to which we would direct attention.

He also stated that the committee had deemed it advisable to make
a statement of all the moneys received and handled by the Institution
on account of trusts committed to it by Congress, and on the last page
of the report it would be seen that an exhibit was presented giving an
abstract of everything under this head.

On motion of Mr. Sherman the report was received and adopted.

The Secretary presented his annual report for the year ending June
30, 1886, which in accordance with a resolution of the Board had been
printed in advance of the meeting.

General Meigs asked if there was any point in the report that Pro-
fessor Baird wished to emphasize or to ask action on, particularly in
regard to additional buildings for the Museum.

Professor Baird replied that there was not; thatin regard to the new
building for the Museum the Board had already taken action and rec-

Ethnological researches.—An appropriation of $40,000 was made by
Congress for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1887, for the prosecution
of ethnological researches under the direction of the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution. The actual conduct of these investigations
has been placed by the Secretary in the hands of Maj. J. W. Powell,
director of the Geological Survey. The abstracts of expenditures and
balance sheets for this appropriation have been exhibited to us; the
vouchers for the expenditures are, however, transmitted, after approval
by the Secretary, to the accounting officers of the Treasury Department
for settlement.

The balance available to meet outstanding liabilities on the 1st of
July, 1887, as reported by the official disbursing agent, is $6,553.08.

WASHINGTON, July 21, 1887,
REPORT OF PROFESSOR BAIRD,
SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1887.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith the report of the
operations and condition of the Smithsonian Institution for the year
188687.

There is also given, in accordance with established usage, a summary
of the work performed by the branches of the public service placed by
Congress under its charge, namely, the National Museum and the Bu-
reau of Ethnology.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

By the organic law of August 10, 1546, the Vice-President of the
United States is made a member of the Board of Regents; and in the
absence of a Vice-President, it has been held that the President of the
United States Senate occupies the same position. At the date of the
last annual report, Hon. John Sherman, by virtue of his office as the
acting Vice-President pro tempore, was a Regent of the Institution. In
consequence of his resignation of that office, the Hon. John James In-
galls was elected by the United States Senate its President, February
26, 1887; and is accordingly a Regent.

The only other change in the Board since the last annual report is the
vacancy occasioned by the death of the Rev. Dr. John Maclean (fer-
merly president of Princeton College), who was so long identified with
the history of the Institution and so closely associated with its late Sec-
retary, Professor Henry. Dr. Maclean died August 10, 1886, and as a
just mark of respect to his memory the building was closed on the day
of his funeral, August 13, 1586.

The action of the Board in regard to Dr. Maclean was the adoption of
the following resolutions after an eloquent and feeling tribute had been
paid to his memory by Dr. James C. Welling, chairman of the Execu-
tive Committee, whose remarks in full will be found in the journal of
proceedings of the Board of Regents:

‘“¢ Whereas since the date of the last annual meeting of the Board of
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, its members have been called

H. Mis, 600-——1 hes |
2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

upon to mourn the loss of their venerable and distinguished colleague,
the late Rev. John Maclean, D. D., LL. D., sometime president of Prince-
ton College, who held the office of Regent for the term of eighteen years,
during seventeen of which he served on its Executive Committee with
no less credit to himself than of usefulness to the Institution: There-
fore, be it :

‘Resolved, That with a high appreciation of the varied, abundant, and
intelligent labors which the late Dr. Maclean brought to the cause of
culture, of truth, and of righteousness throughout the whole of his long,
useful, and honorable career; with a grateful sense of the manifold serv-
ices he rendered to the Smithsonian Institution, for whose welfare he
worked without weariness, and watched without flagging even after he
had begun to feel the burden of age; with profound sorrow for his death,
mingled with reverence for his beautiful memory, and with thanksgiv-
ing for the serene and peaceful close of a finished life, as full of years
as it was full of honor, we hereby testify and record our admiration of
the exalted Christian character with which he dignified and adorned
every station that he was called to hold in the eyes of men; our respect
for the solidity of the learning which supported him in the high dis-
charge of every professional duty, whether in the pulpit, the academic
chair, or at the pest of executive administration; and lastly, in special
recognition of the grateful savor which his genial presence never failed to
shed on the deliberations of this council chamber, our cheerful and loyal
homage to the dignity of bearing and amenity of manners which made
him as courteous in debate as he was wise in council, as gracious im all
the relations of private life as he was inflexible in the maintenance of
Christian honor and conscientious in the performance of public duty.

‘“‘ Resolved, That this preamble and resolution bespread on the minutes
of the Board in respectful tribute to the services and memory of our
venerated colleague, and that a copy of these resolutions be transmitted
to the family of our deceased friend in token of the share we fain would
take with them in this bereavement.”

Congress by joint resolution, approved by President Cleveland Jan-
uary 19, 1887, filled the vacancy on the Board of Regents occasioned

by the death of Dr. Maclean by the election of Dr. James B. Angell,
president of the University of Michigan.

FINANCES.

The Smithson fund in the Treasury of the United States remains the
Same as stated in the last report, $703,000.

The vouchers and account-books have been examined quarterly by
the Executive Committee, who report them all correct, and that the

United States. A more detailed account of the expenditures of the
Institution is given in the report of the Executive Committee.

ASSISTANT SECRETARIES.

Having consulted with Prof. Samuel P. Langley, director of the
Allegheny Observatory, Pennsylvania, with a view of securing his
services as Assistant Secretary of the Institution, without asking from
him the abandonment of his great scientific researches or a withdrawal
from his observatory, I ascertained that he was willing to devote a con-
siderable portion of his time to the object mentioned.

Accordingly, at the last annual meeting of the Regents, after repre-
senting to them the onerous nature of the duties of the Secretary, from
their increasing range and importance, I requested permission to ap-
point two assistant secretaries, which appointment would be in a cer-
tain sense a return to the organization of the Institution in 1850, when
Mr. Charles C. Jewett was assistant in charge of the library, and my-
self assistant in charge of the museum collections, and later of the ex-
changes as well. I therefore asked leave to nominate Prof. Samuel
P. Langley Assistant Secretary in charge of the exchanges, publications,
and library, and Mr. G. Brown Goode Assistant Secretary in charge of
the National Museum. These nominations were unanimously confirmed
by the Board; and the two gentlemen named were, on the 12th day
of January, 1887, appointed Assistant Secretaries of the Smithsonian
Institution.

Subsequently, in consequence of my enforced absence from the In-
stitution by reason of sickness, Professor Langley was appointed by
the Chancellor, February 10, 1887, Acting Secretary, under the provis-
ions of the act of Congress of May 13, 1884, and this position he contin-
ues to occupy at the date of the present report.

PORTRAIT OF SMITHSON.

A water-color portrait of James Smithson, in the possession of Mr.
James Gunn, of 49 Bedford street, Strand, London, having been offered
to the Institution for 30s., our agent, Mr. Wesley, of London, was au-
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

thorized to conclude the purchase if found satisfactory. By letter dated
May 19, i887, the purchase of the likeness, at £1 10s., was approved ;
and the Elona drawing was forwarded to this Teenie ree where it
will be deposited with the other relics of Smithson. The nae color
is 7 inches by 6 inches in size, representing Smithson in his academic
cap and gown (at the age of probably twenty-five years), and is ina
fresh and excellent condition. ’

BUILDINGS.

Smithsonian Building.—The western corridor, or range, connecting the
main building of the Institution with its extreme western wing, in
which have been deposited of late years all the large alcoholic collec-
tions of the National Museum and of the Fish Commission, not having
its floors, ceilings, and roof originally built fire-proof, representation has
several times been made to Congress that the United States national
collections were thereby seriously endangered, and that a moderate ap-
propriation for providing against such risk was eminently just and ad-
visable. At the last session of Congress an appropriation of $15,000
was granted for putting this range in good fire-proof condition. Pro-
posals for the work were at once published, and the desired repairs
have been commenced and will be vigorously pushed forward.

National Museum Building—The building erected by Government for
the National Museum, at a remarkably small cost, continues to give sat-
isfaction in every particular excepting in its extent. The overflowing
wealth of the collections cannot at present be properly displayed or
protected; and the necessity of additional accommodations becomes
every year more pressing. The Regents having authorized some years
ago an application to Congress for relief, the present opportunity should
not be neglected for again respectfully and urgently pressing upon the
attention of Senators and Members of the House of Representatives
the claims of the National Museum for an additional building, at least
as large as the present one.

Armory Square.—A communication dated June 1, 1887, was received
from Col. John M. Wilson, in charge of the public buildings and grounds,
informing me that it was proposed to re-name Armory Square (extend-
ing from Sixth to Seventh streets, and from B street north to B street
south), after our late distinguished Secretary, the “ HENRY PARK.”
The adjoining triangular reservation, extending eastward from Sixth
street to Third street, is now known as the Seaton Park.

To this communication an expression of cordial approval was re-
turned to Colonel Wilson, through the Acting Secretary, Professor
Langley.

CORRESPONDENCE.

This important branch of Smithsonian operations embraces a wide
range of applications and of topics in addition to the necessarily large
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

number of business and routine letters constantly required in the trans-
action of its daily work. From all portions of our country inquiries
and proposals are continually received, varying from modest requests
for information on subjects frequently common-place, sometimes ab-
struse, to magisterial announcements of new philosophies and cosmolo-
gies, destined to revolutionize science or to entirely supersede the laws
of Newton. Agreeably to its established policy, all correspondents re-
ceive a respectful attention and reply, and if the information sought is
not immediately accessible, either reference is given to other establish-
ments or sources, or specialists are addressed upon the subject, and the
Institution itself becomes a solicitor of knowledge.

The number, however, of those ambitious of having their visionary
speculations published by the Institution has been so considerable that
for several years past the following circular has been largely employed
in response:

‘¢ SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, WASHINGTON, D. C.

“This Institution being in frequent receipt of communications an-
nouncing discoveries or theories supposed by the writers to be both
new and important, it may be well to inform these correspondents that
owing to the number of such papers the usual course is to refer them
to one or more specialists in the particular subject discussed, and to
communicate briefly by letter to the authors the result of such exami-
nation. This may sometimes involve a delay of several weeks before
the expected answer is returned.

“In order to correct a very common misapprehension, it is proper to
state that the Institution has not offered any standing prizes for the
solution of difficult problems, or for the discovery of new scientific prin-
ciples. The proper course for those who wish to obtain pecuniary ad-
vantage from their supposed contributions to knowledge, is to make
some practical application thereof, for which they may secure a patent
from the United States Patent Office. It may also be remarked that a
rule adopted by the Board of Regents forbids the Secretary or his as-
sistants giving, for personal benefit, an official opinion as to the merits
or demerits of inventions or other projects.”

EXPLORATIONS.

A full account of the explorations and accessions resuliing therefrom
undertaken during the past year under the auspices of the Institution
will be found in the report of Mr. Goode, upon the Museum, forming
the second part or volume of the Regents’ Report. Only a brief refer-
ence, therefore, to one or two subjects appears necessary in this place.

Exploration for American bison.—An unsuccessful attempt having
been made the previous year to procure specimens of the buffalo (now
being rapidly exterminated), at the request of Mr. W. T. Hornaday
another attempt was approved and determined upon.

Early in the spring of 1886 the attention of the Secretary was called
to the fact that the work of exterminating the American bison had
made most alarming progress, and also that the representatives of this
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

species then in the National Museum were far from being what they
should be. A careful inventory revealed the fact that the collection
contained only two male specimens which were very old and in a sadly
dilapidated condition, a single cow, an unmounted cow-skin, and one
mounted male skeleton. The efforts which had been made by corre-
spondence during the previous year had signally failed to produce any
specimens. Realizing the imperative need of securing at once and at
all hazards a complete and unexceptional series of fresh skins for
mounting, before it should become too late, the Secretary directed
the chief taxidermist, Mr. Hornaday, to take immediate steps toward
the accomplishment of that end.

At first all inquiries in regard to the presence of wild buffalo were met
by the assurance that those animals had all been killed, and that none
remained outside of the Yellowstone Park. Eventually, however, re-
ports were received to the effect that a few individuals still remained
in Montana, and a few more in the panhandle of Texas. Inasmuch as
the task of finding specimens threatened to be the most serious part of
the undertaking, and might possibly require two or three months’
search, it was decided not to wait until the proper hunting season in the
fall and winter months, but to send the party at once on its quest.
Accordingly Mr. Hornaday started immediately for Montana, and by
following up the most reliable information he obtained, had the exceed-
ing good fortune to find a locality, about 75 miles northwest of Miles
City, which contained about fifty or sixty head of buffalo. Owing to
the fact that the people along the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers
were generally quite ignorant of the existence of those animals in that
wild and uninhabited region, the bison had found safe shelter there
ever since the great northern herd was swept out of existence in the
years 1881, 1882, and 1883, and were breeding there in fancied security.
But the settlement of that country by the ranchmen, which had just
then taken place, doomed every one of those animals to destruction at
the hands of the cowboys, and the sequel has proved that Mr. Horna-
day’s efforts were put forth only just in time to snatch a few specimens
from the total annihilation that has overtaken the millions.

Mr. Hornaday’s party prosecuted its search until three buffaloes were
actually taken, one a very young calf, which was caught alive and so
taken to Washington, and two old bulls, which were killed and pre-
served, As was fairly expected, they had so far shed their winter
pelage that their skins were worthless, but their heads and entire
skeletons were taken. Having thus actually located a band of bison
the party returned to the Smithsonian without delay, to go out again
in the fall to accomplish the remainder of its task.

In the latter part of September, Mr. Hornaday again took the field,
and in a little over two months succeeded in finding about twenty-eight
head of buffalo. By dint of hard work and no small amount of personal
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. : 7

risk twenty-two specimens were killed and preserved in the finest pos-
sible condition, and at the same time the chief taxidermist was afforded
a fine opportunity for making life studies of the species. The finest
and largest of the eight bulls was actually studied and sketched as he
stood on the prairie, wounded and at bay, only 30 yards distant.

In addition to the splendid series of skins of all ages and sexes thus
collected, which in view of the almost complete extinction of the species
we may fairly consider of almost priceless value, the party collected
sixteen complete skeletons, fifty-one dry skulls, two feetal young in
alcohol, and a very fine series of skins and skeletons of prong-horn
antelope, coyote, and a fewdeer. A fine collection of skeletons of birds
of all species found was also made for the department of comparative
anatomy.

This exploration has not only yielded a collection of great value to
the National Museum, and such as could not have been obtained in any
other way, but it has also secured to science a large number of valuable
duplicates such as will be eagerly sought after a very few years hence,
when the last specimen of Bos americanus has been slaughtered. In-
deed, so rapidly is the destruction of our great game animals being
prosecuted in every part of the United States, it is a sad certainty that
in a very few years the elk, mountain sheep, goat, deer, moose, and
other forms will have totally disappeared. In view of this prospect,
more stringent measures of game protection and preservation are loudly
called for.

A full report of the above exploration and its results will be found
in the Report of the U.S. National Museum, already referred to.

Other fields of exploration—A proposal was made (August 2, 1886) to
Mr. C. H. Townsend that he undertake an exploration of the Swan Isl-
ands, in the Caribbean Sea (belonging to the Pacific Guano Company),
said to abound in land birds in great variety, and also in large iguana
and other reptiles, in the belief that the exploration of these islands
will afford an excellent opportunity for a naturalist to make a mono-
graph of great interest. Messrs. Glidden & Curtis having made a cour-
teous offer to accommodate a naturalist on board of one of their vessels
about to sail for that region, due acknowledgment was made for the
favor; and later, additional thanks were called for (November 15, 1886)
by their placing one of their vessels at Mr. Townsend’s disposal, for the
reception of such collections as he might secure for the National Mu-
seum.

An appropriation was made to assist Mr. J. A. MeNiel in collecting
antiquities from the Isthmus of Panama for the National Museum.

The acquisition for the ethnological collections, of the Easter Island
idol, and of other interesting articles, will be fully detailed in the Re-
port, Part Il, devoted te the condition of the National Museum.
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
PUBLICATIONS.

The publications of the Institution may be said to now comprise four
series. First, the “Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge” in quarto
form, presenting the results of original research (corresponding gen-
erally with the transactions of learned societies), of which 25 vol-
umes have been published. Second, the “Smithsonian Miscellaneous
Collections,” in octavo form, presenting papers, tabulations, classi-
fications, and other compilations, generally of a more technical and
practical character, of which 30 volumes have been published. Third,
the “annual reports of the Board of Regents of the Institution” to
Congress, in octavo form, containing, in addition to the exposition of
the operations and condition of the Institution, papers from corre-
spondents illustrating the progress of scientific investigation, of which
40 volumes have been published. Fourth, the more recent series of
“Annual Reports of the Bureau of Ethnology” in imperial octavo
form, of which 4 volumes have been published.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge—The only memoir of this
series actually issued during the past fiscal year, is ‘“* Researches upon
the Venoms of Poisonous Serpents,” by S. Weir Mitchell, M. D., and
Edward T. Reichert, M. D. This forms a quarto volume of 196 pages,
illustrated by 4 cuts inserted in the text and 5 colored plates. This
work was leaving the printer’s hands at the close of the last fiscal year, .
though it was not actually published until the beginning of the present
fiscal year, and it was fully described in the last annual report.

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections—Numerous papers belonging
to this series have been published during the past year, and 3 com-
plete volumes have been collected from the published papers on
hand. ‘These have been selected without reference to their chronolog-
ical order, but mainly with regard to the average size of the resulting
volume, and also with some attention to congruity of compilation. The
numbers prefixed to the following titles indicate merely their order in
the official catalogue of publications.

text. The second volume contains vili+559 pages, including index,
and is illustrated by 48 cuts inserted in the text. This work is fully
described in the Smithsonian report for 188586.

558. *‘ Miscellaneous Collections. Vol. XXX.” The ‘Scientific Writ-
ings of Joseph Henry.” This edition of the work just above referred
to is reprinted on medium octavo paper, for the * Miscellaneous Collec-
tions” series, from the same stereotype plates. It forms a single
octavo volume of 1105 pages.

645. ‘“‘ Miscellaneous Papers relating to Anthropology.” By George
Ercol Sellers; Charles Whittlesey ; J. P. MacLean; Charles C. Jones,
jr.; James Shepard; Mark Williams; and the late Henry Rh. Sehool-
craft. (Reprinted from the Smithsonian report for 1885.) An octavo
pamphlet of 44 pages; illustrated by 19 cuts. °

Bulletins of the National Museum.—This series consists of monographs
of biological subjects, check-lists, taxonomic systems, ete., designed to
illustrate the mineral, botanical, zoological, and ethnological material
of the Museum, and are originally printed under the authority of the
honorable Secretary of the Interior. These papers, prepared under the
direction of the Smithsonian Institution, are necessarily of great variety
in size and range: Bulletin No. 17, for example, covering but 51 pages;
and Bulletin No. 27 occupying 1279 pages. A supplementary edition
of the bulletins from the stereotype plates is issued by the Institution,
and from time to time the issues are arranged or combined in volumes
of its Miscellaneous Collections. Thus Bulletins Nos. 1 to 10, inclusive,
formed Volume XIII of the Miscellaneous Collections. Bulletins Nos.
11 to 15, inelusive, formed Volume X XIII; and Bulletin 16 formed Vol-
ume XXIV. Bulletins 17 and following have not yet been gathered
into the Miscellaneous Volumes.

625. “Bulletin of the U.S. National Museum, No. 30. Bibliography
of Publications relating to the Collection of Fossil Invertebrates in the
U.S. National Museum, including complete lists of the writings of

653. “Bulletin of the U. S. National Museum, No. 31. Synopsis of
the North American Syrphide.” By Samuel W. Williston. Octavo,
335 pages; illustrated by 12 plates of outline cuts.

Proceedings of the National Museum.—This series, like the preceding,
are primarily printed under the authority of the honorable Secretary of
the Interior. The papers, however, are shorter and less elaborate, and
are designed to give early accounts of recent acquisitions to the Museum,
or of freshly acquired facts relating to biology, ete. And to this end
such papers are promptly published in single “signatures” as soon as
matter sufficient to fill 16 pages has been prepared, the date of issue
being given on each signature. The publication thus partakes of
the character of an irregular periodical, the numbers of which, con-
tinuously paged, form a regular annual volume. These volumes, like
the bulletins, are from time to time included in the Miscellaneous Col-
lections. The “ Proceedings,” Vol. I, for 1878, and Vol. II, for 1879, to-
gether formed Vol. XIX of the Miscellaneous Collections, ‘' Proceed-
ings,” Vol. UI, for 1880, and Vol. IV, for 1881, together formed Vol.
XXII of the Miscellaneous Collections. ‘“ Proceedings,” Vol. V and
following have not yet been collected into the ** Miscellaneous” series.

637. ‘Circular for the Guidance of Persons desiring to make Ex-
changes of Birds or Birds’ Eggs with the National Museum.” A one-page
octavo circular (No. 34).

page octavo circular (No. 35). These circulars are inserted as an ap-
pendix to the volume of ‘“‘ Proceedings.”

650. *‘ Proceedings of the U. 8. National Museum, Vol. IX, 1886.”
The volume contains descriptive and systematic papers by James E.
Benedict, T. W. Blackiston, George H. Boehmer, Charles H. Bollman,
Edward D. Cope, W. H. Dall, George E. Doering, Charles L. Edwards,
Carl H. Eigenmann, Barton W. Evermann, Fernando Ferrari-Perez,

W. True, and John Grant Wells. An octavo volume of v+ 714 pages,
illustrated by 25 plates (1 colored, the rest cuts).

Smithsonian Annual Reports——These reports being submitted to Con-
gress as required by the organic law, are printed by order of that body.
Much of the contents, however, are reprinted by the Institution at its
own expense.

fortunately delayed in its issue by the Government Printing Office; the
first part, that relating to the Institution, having been published in the
preceding year. The Museum Report forms an octavo volume of ix+
458 pages, illustrated by 105 wood-cut plates.

649. “Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, showing the operations, expenditures, and condition of the
Institution to July, 1885. Part I.” Owing to the change made by the
Regents in the period of, the Secretary’s report, from the civil or calen-
dar year to the fiscal year of the United States Government, this report °
of the condition of the Institution embraced only the first six months
of the year 1885; or from January to June, inclusive. The volume
contains the Journal of Proceedings of the Board of Regents, the re-
port of the Executive Committee, the report of the Secretary of the
Institution for six months, supplemented by the report on Exchanges,
followed by the ‘General Appendix,” in which is given a record of
scientific progress for 1885, in astronomy, by William C. Winlock; with
a list of astronomical observatories, by George H. Boehmer; in vulean-
ology and seismology, by Charles G. Rockwood; volcanic eruptions and
earthquakes in Iceland within historic times (from the Icelandic of Th.
Thoroddsen) ; geography, by J. King Goodrich; physics, by George F.
Barker; chemistry, by H. Carrington Bolton; mineralogy, by Edward
S. Dana; bibliography of North American invertebrate palzontology,
by J. B. Marcou; zoology, by Theodore Gill; and anthropology, by
Otis T. Mason ; concluding with miscellaneous anthropological papers by
correspondents; observations on stone-chipping, by George E. Sellers;
copper implements from Bayfield, Wis., by Charles Whittlesey ; ancient

plan for American ethnological investigation, by the late Henry R.
Schoolcraft; index to the literature of Uranium, by H. Carrington
Bolton ; and price-list of the publications of the Smithsonian Institution.
The whole forms an octavo volume of xviii + 996 pages, illustrated by
19 figures.

651. “‘ Report of Prof. Spencer F. Baird, Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, for the year 1885~86.”,  Octavo pamphlet of 83 pages.

The volume containing the above report, with its accompanying pa-
pers, together with the second part containing the report of the Museum,
has not yet appeared. The usual concurrent resolution of Congress
directing the printing of 16,000 copies of the reports for 1885~86, failed
to pass the House at its last session although it had passed the Senate
in time. This has unfortunately delayed the issue of these volumes.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

Next in importance to the promotion of original research, and the
propagation of its results in the Smithsonian series of publications,
ranks the system of international exchanges, early established by this
Institution, and continuously prosecuted by it until its operations have
expanded beyond the unaided capabilities of its resources.

During the past fiscal year the receipts for foreign transmission
amounted to 30,046 packages, weighing 83,902 pounds; the receipts for
domestic distribution comprised 10,294 packages, weighing 34,861
pounds, and for Government exchanges the receipts were 21,600 pack-
ages, weighing 22,500 pounds, making the total of 61,940 packages re-
ceived, weighing 141,263 pounds.

A comparison of the receipts for exchanges during the past fiscal year
with those of the preceding year is given in the following table:

It is shown by the above that the receipts on account of Government
exchanges for the past year have fallen off about one-half from those of
the preceding year. This is mainly due to the diminished number of
United States public documents printed during the “ short session ” of
Congress.

During the past year two accessions have been made to the list of
foreign Governments accepting the system of international exchange

with the United States, namely, the Empire of Austria and the Republic
of Peru.

countries which they respectively represent.

Government Exchanges.-The Smithsonian Institution, as is well
known, has been made by law the agent of the United States Govern-
ment for conducting the international exchanges of public official docu-
ments between it and foreign Governments. By joint resolution of
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Congress (approved March 2, 1867), it was ordered that “ fifty copies
of all documents hereafter printed by order of either house of Congress,
and fifty copies additional of all documents printed in excess of the
usual number, together with fifty copies of each publication issued by
any Department or Bureau of the Government, be placed at the disposal
of the Joint Committee on the Library, who shall exchange the same;
through the agency of the Smithsonian Institution, for such works
published in foreign countries, and especially by foreign Governments,
as may be deemed by said committee an equivalent; said works to be
deposited in the Library of Congress.” And by supplemental joint
resolution to carry the same into better effect (approved July 25, 1868),
the Congressional Printer, whenever he shall be so directed by the
Joint Committee on the Library, is required to print fifty copies in ad-
dition to the regular number of all documents hereafter printed by order
of either house of Congress, or by order of any Department or Bureau
of the Government, and whenever he shail be so directed by the Joint
Committee on the Library, one hundred copies additional of all docu-
ments ordered to be printed in excess of the usual number; said fifty
or one hundred copies to be delivered to the Librarian of Congress, to
be exchanged under the direction of the Joint Committee on the Library,
as provided by joint resolution approved March 2, 1867.

Since the international movement, commencing with the Paris con-
vention of 1875, for promoting the free reviprocal exchange of public
documents, there has. been a growing interest in the subject manifested
abroad. International conferences, for agreeing upon details, were held
at Brussels, Belgium, in 1880, in 1883, and finally in 1886—March 15.
There are now thirty-nine Governments in exchange with the United
States, or, counting the duplicate sets sent to the Dominion of Canada
(deposited at Ottawa and Toronto), there may be said to be forty foreign
recipients. These are: The Argentine Confederation, Austria, Bavaria,
Belgium, Brazil, Buenos Ayres, Canada, two sets (one for the parlia-
mentary library at Ottawa, the other for the legislative library at To-
ronto), Chili, Colombia (United States of), Denmark, France, Germany,
Great Britain, Greece, Hayti, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico,
Netherlands, New South Wales, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Portugal,
Prussia, Queensland, Russia, Saxony, South Australia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Tasmania, Turkey, Venezuela, Victoria, and Wiirtemberg.

Assistance by the Government.—In view of the great public and national
services rendered by the exchange system, in the distribution of Gov-
ernment publications, and in the large accessions of valuable works
annually made through its instrumentality to the Congressional Library,
an appropriation has for some years past been granted by Congress in
aid of this enterprise. And without this support the operations of the
exchange service would be very seriously restricted. The usual appro-
priation of $10,000 was granted to the Institution by the last Congress.

Insufficiency of the Government Exchanges.—W hile the system of inter-
national exchanges inaugurated by the Smithsonian Institution is in a
highly satisfactory condition, the same can not, unfortunately, be said of
the system of Government exchanges intrusted to it. N otwithstanding
the urgent and repeated efforts made by this Institution, it stiil fails to
receive for foreign distribution a large portion of the United States
official publications required for this service by law. Some more effect-
ual legislation appears still necessary to secure the operation of existing
statutes.

Still more unsatisfactory has been the condition of receipts from
abroad in return for the valuable works actually sent from our Govern-
ment. From the indifference of the agents of foreign Governments in
the matter of securing and systematically appropriating their public
documents to the service voluntarily undertaken by these Governments,
the representation of such documents received by us has been meager
in the extreme. The entire receipts from Europe during the past year
have been contained in 5 boxes (with some books and pamphlets by
mail), as against 163 Government boxes forwarded by the Institution.
While it is recalled that when the officer in charge of our exchanges
was sent abroad in 1884, on a tour of inspection and inquiry, the re-
turns from 14 European Governments amounted for that year to 44
boxes and 160 packages of books, numbering in all about 7,000 vol-
umes, the present inadequacy of foreign reciprocity becomes painfully
apparent. Iam constrained to here repeat the earnest recommenda-
tion made by the diligent librarian of the Congressional Library, di-
rected to this matter. In his report for 1885 Mr. Spofford well re-
marks:

‘‘ The experience of years has amply proved the impossibility of secur-
ing any complete or adequate return from foreign Governments for the
full and costly series of Ainerican Government publications so long fur-
nished them, without direct and persistent effort, through an agency
upon the ground furnished with adequate credentials, to attend per-
sonally to the whole business. One of the chief benefits of the initial
effort already made has been the discovery of the practical obstacles in
the way of a thoroughly suecessful system of exchanges. These, it is

believed, could be removed by following up the work with each Govern-
ment, while if neglected or left to the very uncertain medium of cor-
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

respondence the United States will continue to reap very inadequate
returns for our publications sent abroad. It is recommended that the
Joint Committee on the Library consider the expediency of providing
an appropriation to defray the necessary expenses of an agent of inter-
national exchanges, to be sent abroad for a term of at least six months
during the present vear.

“It is also recommended that the act directing the printing of fifty
copies of each publication ordered by any Department or Bureau, to be
devoted to international exchanges, be so amended as to render its pro-
visions more effective.”

The success of the experiment made by us in 1884 would appear to
show that only the employment of an experienced agent of the Institu-
tion, in the work of visiting foreign countries and personally securing
from their authorities the due transmission to our Government of pub-
lic documents as soon as published, is likely to be effective in obtain-
ing the desired result.

LIBRARY.

The fact should constantly be borne in mind that the distribution of
the publications of the Institution secures in return a large amount of
valuable material for the Library of Congress. Whatever cost, there-
fore, there may be to our Government for Smithsonian or Museum re-
ports, ete., it is many times repaid by the exchanges received, in addition
to which the returns for the many volumes of publications printed en-
tirely at the expense of the Smithsonian fund find the same depository.
By the joint resolutions of 1867 and 1868, above referred to, the “ works
published in foreign countries, and especially by foreign Governments,”
that may be obtained by our international exchanges, are directed ‘to
be deposited in the Library of Congress.” This great national institu-
tion thus becomes the beneficiary of this branch of the service, and it is
a matter of public interest that such returns should be placed on their
broadest basis.

The following is a statement of the books, maps, and charts received
by the Smithsonian Institution from July 1, 1886, to June 30, 1887:

U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The National Museum, though supported by Government appropria-
tions, has since 1846 been under the direction of the Institution. Itsrapid
growth during the last few years has shown how impossible it would
be for the Smithsonian Institution to adequately maintain it, even by
the devotion of its entire resources to the task. Indeed, the spacious
building so recently erected by the Government for its accommodation
is already quite insufficient to display its accumulation of valuable ma-
terial, and unless a due provision be early made for the erection of addi-
tional buildings (as urgently asked for in my report for 1883, and in
subsequent reports) there will be a serious hinderance to the proper
administration of the establishment in the insufficiency of space which
can be allowed to its several scientific departments.

In the report of the Museum for 1884 (at page 20), the number of
Specimens is estimated at 1,471,000; this number is now increased by
more than a million, and it is evidently a matter of great importance
that some means of storing and exhibiting this vast quantity of incom-
ing material should be provided without delay. The growth of this
Museum has been exceedingly rapid. Until the beginning of this decade
there was only 1 curator with a few “assistants.” At the present time
there are 31 regularly-organized departments and sections under the
care of 26 curators and numerous assistant curators and aids. Only 9
of the curators receive salaries from the Museum appropriations. Of the
remaining 17,4 are detailed from the U. S. Fish Commission, 2 from
U.S. Army, 1 from U. 8. Navy, 5 from the U.S. Geological Survey, and
1 from the Bureau of Ethnology. Prof. O. C. Marsh has been appointed
honorary curator of the department of vertebrate fossils, and Mr. 8.
R. Koehler, of Roxbury, Mass., has accepted a commission as acting
curator of the section of graphic arts.

There have been no important changes in the administrative staff, a
classification of which is given in full in the report for 1885-1886,

Hi, Mis, 600—-2
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

It is estimated that there are now in the Museum 2,592,732 ‘ lots” of
specimens, an increase of 1,121,732 during the last two and a half years.
The catalogues of the various departments show that in the aggregate
36,595 entries of accession “lots” have been made during the year. In
Speaiine of the accessions to the Museum, I desire to present the cordial
thanks of the Smithsonian Institution to the various Departments and
Bureaus of the Government through whose valuable co-operation a
great deal of interesting material has been received.

The increased popularity of the Museum is plainly evidenced by the
fact that during the year it has bee.. visited by 216,562 persons, while
98,592 visitors were registered in the Smithsonian building, giving a
total of 315,114 visitors to both buildings during the year. This is an
increase of 51,929 over the number recorded for the last fiscal year.

Mr. A. H. Clark has been appointed editor of the Proceedings and
Bulletins in place of Dr. T. H. Bean, who for many years has carried
on this work with great ability. This change was made at Dr. Bean’s
request, since the demands on his time as curator of fishes, left very
little opportunity for him to attend to editorial work. During the year
the Museum report for 1884 was issued, and the manuscripts for both
the 1885 and 1886 reports are now in the hands of the printer. Vol.
VIII of the ‘‘Proceedings of the National Museum” was issued in Oc-
tober, and the signatures of Vol. 1X are all in print. In addition 6
signatures of Vol. X were distributed before the close of the fiscal year.
Bulletin 31, ‘Synopsis of the North America Syrphide,” by Dr. Samuel
M. Williston, appeared in May. Bulletin 32, ‘‘Catalogue of the Batra-
chia and Reptiles of Central America and Mexico,” by Prof. E. D. Cope,
is now intype. The manuscript for Bulletin 33, ‘Catalogue of Minerals
and Synonyms,” by Mr. Thomas Egleston, as well as that for Bulletin
34, ‘Catalogue of the Batrachia and Reptiles of North America,” by
Prof. EK. D. Cope, has gone to the Government Printing Office. <A bib-
liography of papers published by officers of the Museum and by co-op-
erators in Museum work is included in the report of the assistant
secretary. This embraces 345 titles by 84 authors, 32 of whom are
officially connected with the Museum.

In the library, the total number of publications received during the
year, exclusive of regular periodicals, was 1,511. The most valuable
contributions to the library were those made by the Secretary of the
Institution.

There were received 2,055 forms of labels, from the Government Print-
ign Office, each form containing 24 copies, 12 or which are printed on
card-board and 12 on paper.

As in previous years, several students in various branches of natural
history have enjoyed the privilege of access to the collections in which
they were especially interested. Courtesies of this kind have been ex-
tended: notably by the departments of birds, insects, mollusks, marine
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

invertebrates, minerals, mammals, ethnology, and fishes. Instruction
in taxidermy and photography has been given to several applicants.

The regular Saturday lectures, 12 in number, were given in the lec-
ture hall between March 12 and May 7. The national convention ot
Superintendents of Schools (March 15-17) and the Dental Association
(July 27-29) held their meetings in the same hall. The Biological
Society of Washington also used this room for their regular fort-
nightly meetings during the winter.

The Museum preparators have been kept constantly employed during
the year. The chief taxidermist was sent by this Institution to Montana
for the purpose of obtaining skins and skeletons of American bison,
and the results of this expedition were successful. The details of the
work accomplished in the various preparators’ shops will be found in -
the report of the assistant secretary, on the condition of the Museum.

The work accomplished in the scientific departments is described at
length in the reports of the curators, given in the Museum Report,
which forms Part II of the Smithsonian Report. As this work is briefly
reviewed by the Assistant Secretary in the said Museum report it is
unnecessary to enlarge upon it here.

It seems proper that I should here pay a tribute of respect to a de-
parted collaborator—Capt. Hubbard C. Chester—who, as connected
with the U.S. Fish Commission service, has contributed tothe accessions
of the Museum. Captain Chester was born at Groton, Conn., July 6,
1835. Devoted to a sea-faring life from his earliest manhood, he joined
the ship Leander in 1857, under the command of his uncle, Capt. Brad-
dock Chester, on a whaling voyage. In 1860 he sailed in the schooner
Cornelia to the southern Indian Ocean in pursuit of elephant seals. In
1864, as mate of the whaling vessel, Monticello, he made a voyage to
Hudson Bay. In 1871, as mate of the ill-fated Polaris, under command
of Capt. Charles F. Hall, he joined in the Arctic expedition ; and it
was to his skill and courage that the survivors of this expedition owed
their preservation. In 1874, Captain Chester attached himself to the
Fish Commission, in which service he remained during his life. In
1883 he superintended the packing of the collections sent by the U.S.
Commission to the International Fisheries Exhibition at London, as-
sisted in the installation of the exhibition at London, and also in re-
packing the exhibit for return to this country. In 1885 he was made
superintendent of the new station at Wood’s Holl.

After an illness primarily induced by his exposures he died at his
home in Noank, Conn., July 19, 1886. His varied services—faithfully
rendered—inspired all who knew him with a high appreciation of his
abilities and a strong regard for his mauly worth,
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

The prosecution of ethnologic researches among the North American
Indians, under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution and in compliance with acts of Congress, was continued during the
year 1886~87, under the charge of Maj. J. W. Powell, who has furnished
the following account of operations.

The work of the year may be conveniently reported upon under the
two general heads of ficld work and office work.

1. Field work.

The field work of the yearis divided into (1) mound explorations and
(2) general field studies, embracing those relating to social customs, in-
stitutions, linguistics, and other divisions of anthropology.

Mound explorations.—The work of exploring the mounds of the east-
ern United States was, as in previous years, under the charge of Prof.
Cyrus Thomas.

Although Professor Thomas and his assistants have devoted a large
portion of the year to the study of the collections made in the division
of mound exploration and to the preparation of a report of its opera-
tions for the past five years, yet some field work of importance has been
done.

Professor Thomas, in person, has examined the more important an-
cient works of New York and Ohio. He has given special attention
to the latter, with a view of determining where new and more accu-
rate descriptions, surveys, and illustrations are necessary. It was
found requisite to undertake a careful re-survey and description of a
number of the well-known works in Ohio. This re-examination, which
is still in progress, is deemed. the more necessary in view of the light
shed on the origin and use of these monuments by the explorations
which have been carried on in West Virginia, western North Carolina,
and eastern Tennessee.

Mr. J. P. Rogan continued his work as assistant until the close of
November, when he voluntarily resigned his position to enter upon other
engagements. A portion of his time during the first month was occu-
pied in arranging and preparing for shipment the collection purchased
of Mrs. McGlashan, in Savannah,Ga. The rest of his time was em-
ployed in exploring mounds along the upper Savannah River in Georgia
and South Carolina and along the lower Yazoo River in Mississippi.

Mr. J. W. Emmert continued to act as field assistant until the end of
February, when the field work closed. His labors, with the exception
of a short visit to central New York, were confined to east Tennessee,
chiefly Blount, Monroe, and Loudon Counties, where numerous extensive
and very interesting groups are found in the section formerly occupied
by the Cheroki. Professor Thomas has thought it necessary to devote

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. aT

considerable attention to the ancient works of that region, as it is prob-
able that there and in western North Carolina is to be found the key that
will materially assist in solving the problem of the singular works of
Ohio. The results of these explorations are of unusual interest, inde-
pendent of their supposed bearing on the Ohio mounds.

Mr. J. D. Middleton, who has been a constant assistant since the or-
ganization of the division, after completing some investigations begun
in southern Illinois, visited western Kentucky for the purpose of inves-
tigating the works of that section, but was soon afterwards called to
Washington to take part in the office work. During the month of
June he visited and made a thorough survey of the extensive group of
works near Charleston, West Va., of which Colonel Norris had made a
partial exploration, the latter having been prevented from completing it
by the sickness which immediately preceded his death. During the
same month Mr. Middleton commenced the survey of the Ohio works
before alluded to, securing some valuable results in the short time be-
fore the close of the year.

Mr. Gerard Fowke was also engaged for a short time in field work in
western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky, but was called early in
autumn to Washington to assist in office work.

General field studies.—During October and December Mr. Albert S.
Gatschet was engaged in gathering historic and linguistic data in
Louisiana, Texas, and the portion of Mexico adjoining the Rio Grande,
this region containing the remnants of a number of tribes of whose lan-
guage and linguistic affinity practically nothing is known. After a
long search Mr. Gatschet found a small settlement of Biloxi Indians
at Indian Creek, 5 or 6 miles west of Lecompte, Rapides Parish, La.,

_where they gain a livelihood as day laborers. Most of them speak

English more than their native tongue. In fact about two-thirds of
the thirty-two survivors speak English only. The vocabulary obtained
by him discloses the interesting fact that the Biloxi belong to the Siouan
linguistic family.

Mr. Gatschet heard of about twenty-five of the Tunica tribe still
living in their old homes on the Marksville Prairie, Avoyelles Parish,
La. An excellent vocabulary was obtained of their language at Le-
compte, La., and a careful comparison of this with other Indian lan-
guages shows that the Tunica is related to none, but represents a dis-
tinct linguistic family.

He was unable to collect any information in regard to the Karankawa
tribe, concerning which little is known except that they lived upon the
Texan coast near Lavacea Bay.

Leaving Laredo County, Texas, he visited Camargo in Tamaulipas,
Mexico, finding near San Miguel the remnants of the Comecrudo tribe,
or, as they are called by the whites, Carrizos. Only the older men and
women still remember their language. The full-blood Comecrudos seen
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

by Mr. Gatschet were tall and thin, some of them with fairer complexions
than the Mexicans. Subsequently the Cotoname language, formerly
spoken in the same district, was studied and found to be a distantly
related dialect of Comecrudo. Both of them belong to the Coahuilte-
can‘family. From the Comecrudo Mr. Gatschet obtained the names of
a number of extinct tribes who formerly lived in their vicinity, but of
whom no representatives are left. These are the Casas Chiquitas, Te-
jones (or “raccoons ”), Pintos or Pakawas, Miakkan, Cartujanos. Mr.
Gatschet next visited the Tlaskaltec Indians, who livein the city of Sal-
tillo. Of these Indians about 200 still speak their own language, which
is almost identical with the Aztec, although largely mixed with Spanish.

Mr. Josiah Curtin was engaged from the middle of March to June 1
in completing investigations begun the previous year into the history,
myths, and language of the Iroquois Indians at Versailles, Cattaraugus
County, N. Y. The material secured by him is of great interest and
value.

2. Office work.

The Director, Maj. J. W. Powell, has continued the work of the lin-
guistic classification of the Indian tribes in North America north of
Mexico, and in connection with it is preparing a map upon a linguistic
basis showing the original habitat of the tribes. The work is now so far
advanced that it is expected to be ready for the printer before January
next. It will form a part of the seventh annual report.

As previously stated, Professor Thomas has devoted much of his time
during the year to the study of the collections made, and in preparing
for publication the account of field work performed by himself and his
assistants. That account will form the first volume of his final report,
and will consist wholly of descriptions, plans, and figures of the ancient,
works examined, narrative and speculation being entirely excluded.
The report will be ready for publication so soon as the illustrations
shall be prepared and some verifications and supplemental surveys now
being made, shall be completed.

The second volume, which will be devoted to the geographic distri-
bution of the various types of mounds, archologic maps and charts,
and a general discussion of the various forms and types of ancient works,
iswellunderway. Thepreliminary list of the various monuments known,
and of the localities where they are found, together with references to
the works and periodicals in which they are mentioned, which Mrs. V.
L. Thomas, in addition to her other duties as secretary to Mr. Thomas,
has been engaged upon for nearly three years, is now completed, and is
being used in the preparation of maps. It will form a part of the sec-
ond volume.

Mr. Middleton’s office work has consisted entirely in the preparation
of maps, charts, and diagrams. These are of two classes: (1) Those
made entirely from original surveys, which constitute the larger portion,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

and (2) the archeological maps of States and districts, showing the dis-
tribution of given types, which are made from ali the data obtainable,
including additions and verifications made by the mound exploration
division of the Bureau.

Mr. Gerard Fowke, in addition to assisting in the preparation of the
report on the field work which is to constitute the first volume, has made
a study of the stone articles of the collection, and Mr. H. L. Reynolds
jr. has made a study of the copper articles collected, both with a view
of preparing papers for the third volume of the report. The paper by
Mr. Reynolds is nearly completed.

Mr. Pilling continued his bibliographic studies during the year, with
the intention of completing for the press his bibliography of North
American languages. After consultation with the Director and a num-
ber of gentlemen well informed on the subject, it was concluded that
the wants of students in this branch of ethnology would be better sub-
served were the material to be issued in separate bibliographies, each
devoted to one of the great linguistic stocks of North America. The
first to be issued related to the Eskimo, forming a pamphlet of 116 pages.
The experiment proved successful, and Mr. Pilling continued the prep-
aration of the separates. Late in the fiscal year the copy of the bibliog-
raphy of the Siouan family was sent to the Public Printer. It is Mr.
Pilling’s intention to continue this work by preparing a bibliography
of each of the linguistic groups as fast as opportunity will permit.

Mr. Frank H. Cushing continued work, so far as his health permitted,
upon his Zui material until the middle of December. At that time
he gave up office work and left for Arizona and New Mexico, intending
to devote himself for a season to the examination of the ruins of that
region with the view of obtaining material of collateral interest in con-
nection with his Zuni studies as well as in hope of restoring his impaired
health. .

Mr. Charles C. Royce, although no longer officially connected with
the Bureau, has devoted much time during the past year to the com-
pletion of his work upon the former title of Indian tribes to lands within
the United States and the methods of securing their relinquishment.
This work, delayed by Mr. Royce’s resignation from the Bureau force,
is now nearly completed and will soon be ready for publication.

Dr. H. C. Yarrow has continued the preparation of the material for
his final report upon the mortuary customs of the North American
Indians. The collection of data from various sources has been practi-
cally completed, and nothing now remains but the classification and
elaboration of the great amount of material into its final form, which
work is in an advanced state.

Mr. William H. Holmes has continued the archeologic work begun
in preceding years, utilizing such portions of his time as were not ab-
sorbed in work pertaining to the Geological Survey. A paper upon
the antiquities of Chiriqui and one upon textile art in its relation to
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

form and ornament, prepared for the sixth annual report, were com.
pleted and proofs were read. During the year work was begun upon a
review of the ceramic art of Mexico. A special paper, with 20 illus-
trations, upon a remarkable family of spurious antiquities belong-
ing to that country, was prepared and turned over to the Smithsonian
Institution for publication. In addition, a preliminary study of the
prehistoric textile fabrics of Peru was begun, and a short-paper, with
numerous illustrations, was written.

Mr. Holmes has general charge of the miscellaneous archeeologic and
ethnologic collections of the Bureau, and reports that Dr. Cyrus Thomas,
Mr. James Stevenson, and other authorized agents of the Bureau have
obtained collections of articles from the mounds of the Mississippi
Valley and from the ruins of the Pueblo country. A number of inter-
esting articles have also been acquired by donation. Capt. J. G.
Bourke, of the U. S. Army, presented a series of vases and other
ceremonial objects obtained from cliff dwellings and caves in the
Pueblo country; Mr. J. B. Stearns, of Short Hills, made a few addi-
tions to his already valuable donations of relics from the ancient graves
of Chiriqui, Colombia; and Mr. J. N. Macomb presented a number of
fragments of earthenware from Graham County, N.C. Some important
accessions have been made by purchase. A large collection of pot-
tery, textile fabrics, and other articles from the graves of Peru was
obtained from Mr. William E. Curtis; a series of ancient and modern
vessels of clay and numerous articles of other classes from Chihuahua,
Mexico, were acquired through the agency of Dr. E. Palmer; a small
set of handsome vases of the ancient white ware of New Mexico was
acquired by purchase from Mr. C. M. Landon, of Lawrence, Kans., and
several handsome vases from various parts of Mexico were obtained
from Dr. Eugene Boban.

As in former years, Mr. Holmes has superintended the preparation
of drawings and engravings for the Bureau publications. The number
of illustrations prepared during the year amounted to 650.

During the fiscal year Mr. Victor Mindeleff has been engaged in the
preparation of a report on the architecture of the Tusayan and Cibola
groups of pueblos, which is nearly ready for publication. This report
will contain a description of the topography and climate of the region,
in illustration of the influence of environment upon the development of
the pueblo type of architecture. It will also contain a traditionary ac-
count of the Tusayan pueblos and of their separate clans or phratries.
A description in detail of the Tusayan group will treat of the relative
position of the villages and such ruins as are connected traditionally or
historically with them. A comparative study is also made between the
Tusayan and Cibola groups and between them and certain well pre-
served ruins in regard to constructive details, by which means the com-
paratively advanced type of the modern pueblo architecture is clearly
established. Maps of the groups discussed and of the topography of
Sn ee ee

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

the country and ground plans of houses and apartments will illustrate
the report and give effect to the descriptions and discussion.

Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff devoted the early part of the fiscal year to the

. preparation of a report upon the exhibits of the Bureau of Ethnology and
the Geological Survey at the Cincinnati Industrial Exposition, 1884;
the Southern Exposition at Louisville, 1884; and the Industrial and
Cotton Centennial Exposition at New Orleans, 1884~’85. The report
includes a descriptive catalogue of the various exhibits. As these con-
sisted largely of models, and as the locality or object represented by
each model was described in detail, the report was lengthy. It was
finished in October and transmitted to the commissioner representing
the Interior Department. During the remainder of the year the por-
tion of time which Mr. Mindeleff was able to devote to office work was
employed in assisting Mr. Victor Mindeleff in the preparation of a pre-
liminary report on the architecture of Zuni and Tusayan (Moki). The
portion assigned to him consists of an introductory chapter, which will
include a review of the literature of the subject and a chapter devoted
to traditionary history of Tusayan, from material collected by Mr. A.
M. Stephen, of Keam’s Cafon, Ariz.

The modeling room has remained in charge of Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff.
The preparation of a duplicate series of the models made in the past
few years and now deposited in the National Museum was continued, a
large portion of the time being given to that work. During the year
the following models were added to this series, which now consists ot
eighteen models: (1) Relief map of the high plateaus of southern Utah;
(2) model of Leadville and vicinity; (3) model of Shimopavi, Tusayan,
Arizona; (4) model of Etowah mound, Georgia; (5) model of Mishon-
ginivi; (6) model of Zuni; (7) model of Penasco Blanco; (8) models of
Etruscan graves (series to illustrate Etruscan graves, from material

_ furnished by Mr. Thomas Wilson).

During 1886, and continuously to the end of the fiscal year, Mr. E.
W. Nelson has devoted much time to preparing a report upon the Hs-
kimo of northern Alaska, for which his note-books and large collections
obtained in that region furnish ample material. During 1886 the vo-
cabularies, taken from twelve Eskimo dialects for use in Arctic Alaska,
were arrangéd in the form of an English-Eskimo and Eskimo-Eng-
lish dictionary. These dictionaries, with notes upon the alphabet and
grammar, will form one part of his report. The other part, upon
which he is at work at present, will consist of chapters upon various
phases of Eskimo life and customs in Alaska, and will be illustrated by
photographs taken by him on the spot, and by specimens collected dur-
ing his extended journeys in that region. Mr. Nelson’s notes upon
Eskimo legends, festivals, and other customs will form an important
contribution.

Mr. Lucien M. Turner is also engaged in the preparation of a similar
report upon the Eskimo, in the form of a descriptive catalogue of the
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

large amount of material collected by him during a residence of several
years at Saint Michaels and in the Aleutian Islands. When these two
reports shall be completed the amount of accurate information concern-
ing the singular people to whom they relate will be materially in;
creased.

Mr. H. W. Henshaw has continued in charge of the work upon the
synonymy of the Indian tribes of the United States, which was alluded
to in some detail in the report of last year. This work has been sus-
pended for a period, and Mr. Henshaw has assisted the Director in the
preparation of a linguistic map of the region north of Mexico, and in
the classification of the Indian tribes, a work which properly precedes
and forms the basis of the volume on synonymy.

Col. Garrick Mallery was steadily occupied during the year in the
work of the synonymy of the Indian tribes, his special field being the
Troquoian and Algonquian linguistic stocks, and his particular respon-
sibility being the careful study of all the literature on the subject in the
French language. He also, when time allowed, continued researches
in and correspondence concerning sign language and pictographs.

Mr. James Mooney also has been occupied during the entire year in
conjunction with Colonel Mallery in that portion of the work of the In-
dian synonymy relating to the Algonquian and Iroquoian families.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt has continued the work left unfinished by Mrs.
Erminnie Smith. During the year he has been engaged in recording,
translating, and tracing the derivation of Tuscarora-English words for
a dictionary. He has thus far recorded about 8,000 words.

Mr. Albert S. Gatschet has devoted almost the entire year to the
synonymy of Indian tribes and has practically completed the section
assigned to him, viz, the tribes of the southeastern United States.

Rev. J. Owen Dorsey continued his work on the Indian synonymy
cards of the Siouan, Caddoan, Athabascan, Kusan, Yakonan, and Ta-
kilman linguistic stocks. He resumed his preparation of the dictionary
cards for Contributions to North American Ethnology, Vol. VI, Part
II, and in connection therewith found it necessary to elaborate his ad-
ditional Gegiha texts, consisting of more “than two hundred and fifty
epistles, besides ten or more myths gained since 1880. This work was
interrupted in March, 1887, when he was obliged to undertake the ar-
rangement of a new collection of Teton texts for publication. Mr.
George Bushotter, a Dakota Indian who speaks the Teton dialect, was
employed by the Director, from March 23, for the purpose of recording
for future use of the Bureau some of the Teton myths and legends in
the original. One hundred of these texts were thus written, and it de-
volved on Mr. Dorsey to prepare the interlinear translations of the
texts, critical and explanatory notes, and other necessary linguistie
material as dictated by Mr. Bushotter. Besides writing the texts in
the Teton dialect, Mr. Bushotter has been able to furnish numerous
sketches as illustrations, all of which have been drawn and colored ac-

cording to Indian ideas. His collection is the most extensive that has
been gained by any collector among the tribes of the Siouan family,
and it is the first one contributed by an Indian.

Dr. W. J. Hoffman and Mr. Josiah Curtin, as heretofore, have con-
tinued to assist in the work of the synonymy of the Indian tribes.

[In consequence of severe illness, Professor Baird had not extended
and completed his report, as he doubtless had contemplated; and the
Acting Secretary respectfully submits the same, without feeling called
upon for further comment. |]

REPORT ON SMITHSONIAN EXCHANGES FOR THE YEAR
ENDING JUNE 30, 1887.

By Gro. H. BoEHMER.

I. SMITHSONIAN EXCHANGES.

Personnel and duties.—In prosecuting the plans recommended for
the execution of the duties devolving on the exchange division, the
services of some of the clerks became superfluous, and on the Ist of
April, 1887, they were assigned to duty in other departments of the
Institution.

The assistants to the exchange clerk now are:

1. Mr. F. V. Berry, who receives, receipts for, acknowledges by
postal card, verifies, and journalizes all incoming exchanges; who ships
all foreign and government exchanges, and writes out the shipping
orders and announcements to the transportation companies and dis-
tributing agents.

2. Mr. H. A. Parker, who assists Mr. Berry, and in addition keeps a
card catalogue of the titles of official publications received from the
Public Printer as provided for by law.

3. Mr. C. W. Shoemaker, who records all exchange transactions by
(a) entering in day-book; (b) posting on ledger cards; (¢) making ont
invoices; (d) recording acknowledgments; (e) entering letters.

4. Mr. A. F. Adams, who assists Mr. Shoemaker in the execution of
the above duties.

5. Mr. M. A. Tolson, who attends to the shipping of packages for do-
mestic distribution, and in addition assists Mr. Berry in shipping
foreigu exchanges.

My own regular duties are:

(a) The supervising of the service in all its branches.

(b) The receiving of all exchange letters, acting on the same accord-
ing to instructions, and preparing replies or memoranda for replies, by
the corresponding clerk.

29
30 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

(c) The translation of foreign letters and documents.

(ad) The verifying of requests from abroad, for Smithsonian publica-
tions, including the issuing of orders for the same and the keeping of
an account of every Smithsonian publication sent abroad. A quarterly
abstract of this account is submitted to the Chief Clerk.

(e) The preparation of a card catalogue, from the old records, show-
ing the distribution of the volumes of Contributions to Knowledge and
of the Miscellaneous Collections since the establishment of the Institu-
tion.

(7) The preparation of a scientists’ directory.

(g) The preparation, for ready reference, of bibliographical informa-
tion relating to the titles of the publications of foreign establishments
in correspondence with the Institution.

(h) The execution of any work assigned by the Secretary, the Assist-
ant secretaries, and the Chief Clerk.

A very important duty, under this last head, intrusted to me by Pro-
fessor Langley, the acting and assistant secretary, was that of collecting
and arranging all the information relating to the proposed plan for the
increase of the Smithsonian library, and to report on the results of the
inquiry.

The report submitted on the subject represents two divisions: I. In-
quiry. Il. Result.

The first division, that of inquiry, is again subdivided into two sec-
tions, of which the first shows, in brief; abstracts of all transactions of
consequence connected with the scheme, to the number of two hundred,
including the report, and representing, as recorded in full in the jour-
nal, 475 folio pages of manuscript. Part 2 represents a list of persons
addressed on the subject, by circular letter or otherwise, and their re-
spective replies, as indicated by the number corresponding to each
document in the journal. Three hundred letters were written and 174
replies received, as follows:

As shown by the geographical arrangement, 3,594 distinct titles, rep-
resenting 5,730 references, were reported by the collaborators, and it was
part of my instructions to ascertain how many of these were already
correspondents of the Institution.

Subtracting from the number of titles the 400 approximated trom the
unclassified list of books in the west room of the Patent Office Library, °
and the 866 published in the United States, 2,328 foreign serials remain,
and of these 792, or 34 per cent., occur in our list of foreign correspond-
ents, which number, however, will be increased to some extent by the
correction of titles, given in many cases but very indistinetly, and by
the assigiment to the proper society on the list of correspondents of
magazines and journals properly to be designated under the name of
the society; and it is believed that upon that correction nearly one-half
of all the foreign titles given may be considered as correspondents of
the Institution.

I beg here to state that owing to the press of routine duties all the
work connected with the library inquiry has been performed by me in
my leisure hours.

Work performed.—During the past year 61,940 packages, represent-
ing a weight of 141,263 ponnds, were received. Of these 10,294 were
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 33

for domestic distribution, and these were sent out through the United
States Post-Office. The remainder was for foreign and Government
distribution, requiring 692 packing-boxes with a bulk of 4,122 cubic feet.

The total number of entries were, for domestic exchanges 20,590, and
for the foreign branch 51,917 entries.

The ledger shows 9,561 running accounts, of which 7,396 are with cor-
respondents abroad and 2,165 with domestic establishments and individ-
uals.

For foreign transmission 15,298 invoices required to be written, of
which 12,430 were returned properly receipted, and which had to be
credited on the respective accounts. Of domestic invoices 4,924 were
returned by consignees and entered.

Letters received during the year 1,131, and 1,217 were written.

In the following table I beg to give a detailed statement of the
amount of work performed during each month of the year:

34 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

Transportation companies.—The only change which has taken place in
the relations of the Institution to the transportation companies extend-
ing the privilege of free freight on all Smithsonian exchanges was caused
by the dissolution of the Monarch Line, plying between London and
New York. Satisfactory arrangements, however, have been made with
Messrs. Barber & Co., of New York, to forward the cases to London
at a mere nominal charge, while the incoming cases from England con-
tinue to be transported free of cost, by the Cunard and Inman Lines.

A full list and account of the transportation lines to which the Insti-
tution is indebted for the privilege of free freight was given in the
Smithsonian Report for 1886.

Centers of distribution.—No changes have taken place among the dis-
tributing agents abroad, all of whom deserve the warmest thanks for
the prompt and efficient manner in which they have discharged their
mostly voluntary duties.

For a complete list of agents for the distribution of Smithsonian ex-
changes, I beg to refer to the report for 1886.

Shipments made to foreign countries.—With the increase in the busi-
ness a more rapid method of intercourse had to be devised, and now
the shipments have become very frequent, with but very short inter-
vals.

The following table exhibits the dates of transmissions during the
present year to each of the foreign countries corresponding with the
Institution :

36 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

It has been suggested that the intervals between the receipt, by the
Smithsonian Institution, of packages and their delivery to the consignee
might perhaps be lessened by some improved method of transmission.
If there is ground for complaint of tardiness in the delivery, such charge
can certainly not be made against the exchange office, in which but
very small delays occur between the receipt of exchange packages and
their transmission.

In order to illustrate this assertion I now beg to submit the follow-
ing tables of transmissions to France, Germany, Great Britain, and
Italy. In each case twenty invoices have been selected at random, ex-
tending over a period of almost three years, and their history has been
traced from the ledger accounts as follows:

IL.—GOVERNMENT EXCHANGES.

The Smithsonian Institution, charged by the Government of the
United States with the duties required for the execution of an exchange
of official public documents with foreign Governments, as provided for
by the laws of March 2, 1867, and July 25, 1868, has, during the past
year, received from the Public Printer three hundred and seventy-one
sets (of fifty copies each) of official publications. These were distrib-
uted in the usual manner to the contracting Governments of thirty-
eight countries. .

The Governments of Peru and Austria were added to the list, thus
increasing the number of recipients to forty.

EXCHANGE WITH AUSTRIA.

The first step toward establishing exchange relations with the Gov-
ernment of Austria was taken in 1876, by the transmission of the first
two boxes of official publications, which were depostied in the Imperial
Library at Vienna.
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 39

In 1884 the subject was again taken up on occasion of my mission to
Europe, as described in the Smithsonian Reports for 1884 and 1885, but
no definite arrangement could be decided on.

On the 14th of December the following letter was received by the
Smithsonian Institution:

The chargé Waffaires of Austria-Hungary to the Secretary of the Smithso
nian Institution.

WASHINGTON, D. C., December 14, 1886.

Sir: Having been instructed to transmit to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution a case which reached this legation yesterday, and which con-
tains thirty-four volumes (and one register) of stenographie reports
referring to the ninth session of both houses of the Imperial Parliament,
I have the honor to inform you that said case shall be forwarded with
out delay to your address.

Please to acknowledge the receipt of said publications, and accept,
sir, the renewed assurance of my high consideration.

Yours, very respectfully,
LIPpPE- WEISSENFELS.

The first advance toward the accomplishment of the proposition for
an exchange made by the United States having thus been made by the
Imperial Government in Vienna, it was decided to make an immediate
return in official publications of the United States Government, result-
ing in the following correspondence:

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to the consul-general of Aus-
tria-Hungary in New York.

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 8, 1887.

Str: The Smithsonian Institution, on behalf of the United States
Government, is about presenting to the Imperial Government at Vienna
a set of the United States official documents published since January
1, 1868, comprising twenty-five packing-boxes, with an approximate
bulk of 160 cubic feet, and an aggregate weight of about 6,000 pounds.

In this transaction we desire the Imperial Government to be at the
least possible expense, and we therefore propose to deliver the cases,
freight prepaid, at an Austrian sea-port easy of access to Vienna, such
as Trieste or Fiume, provided we could arrange for the shipment of the
lot by some sailing vessel bound direct for one of those ports.

We are not cognizant of any regular sailing communication between
the United States and Austria, and therefore beg to request your kind
co-operation in the matter, by informing us of the existence of a regular
line plying between New York and one of the above-named Austrian
ports, or of the possibility of arranging with some Austrian vessel for
the shipment, at reasonable rates, of the lot of books mentioned, which
could be délivered in New York within forty-eight hours of any informa-
tion received.

Very respectfully,
SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution.
40 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.
In reply to this letter the following communication was received :

The Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian consulate-general, New York, to
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

NEw YorRK, January 17, 1887.

Str: In receipt of your esteemed favor of the 8th instant, I beg to say
that I shall be most happy to co-operate with you in the matter of the
shipment of a set of United States official ducuments to the Imperial
Government at Vienna,

There is, unfortunately, no regular sailing communication between
the United States and Austria, nor is there at this moment any sailing-
vessel or steamer in port bound direct to Trieste or Fiume.

It may be that an opportunity will before long offer itself to ship the
books by an Austrian sailing vessel to a home port, and in that case I
shall not fail to communicate with you at once.

I have also given instructions to be promptly advised of the loading
of any sailing vessel or steamer for Austrian ports, so as to make ar-
rangements for this shipment.

I shall have the pleasure of reporting progress as soon as possible;
and remain,

Very respectfully, ete.,
Hueo FRITSCH,
Consul.

The Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian consulate-general, New York,

NEw York, May 2, 1887.

Sir: Referring to my last of January 17, a. ¢., | am to-day enabled to
comply with your favor of January 8.

There is no Austrian vessel as yet for Trieste, but the Italian bark
rags Mignano is now loading for that port and will sail in about two
weeks.

The agents are Messrs. Funch, Edye & Co., 27 South William street.

WASHINGTON, D. C., May 9, 1887.
Str: I have the honor inclosed to submit a copy of a communication
addressed by the Smithsonian Institution on the 12th of October, 1885,
to Count Lippe Weissenfels, the Imperial Austrian chargé d’affaires (this
communication will be found on page 109 of the Smithsonian Annual
Report for 1886, Part I), explanatory of the steps taken for the final
REPORT ON EXCHANGES, 41

settlement of the question of an exchange of the official publications
between the Government of His Majesty and that of the United States,
proposed bythe Smithsonian Institution, as the authorized agent of the
Government in 1884.

Since then, on the 14th December, 1886, the first advance was made
by the Austrian Government by the transmission, through His Majesty’s
legation, of a case containing the *‘ stenographic reports referring to the
ninth session of both houses of the Imperial Parliament,” and being
desirous of making an immediate return, we placed ourselves in com-
munication with the Austrian consul-general in New York, relative to
the best mode of forwarding our exchanges to the Austrian port most
convenient to Vienna.

In compliance with our request, Consul-General Fritsch of New York
now informs us that the Italian bark Peppino Mignano is about to sail
for Trieste. Therefore, unless your excellency is prepared to provide
for a channel of transmission, we propose to utilize the opportunity
thus offered, and to send by this bark, freight prepaid, to Trieste the
twenty-seven boxes of official documents (with a bulk of about 160 cubic
feet and a total weight of about 7,000 pounds) required, additional to the
two boxes already deposited in the Imperial Public Library in Vienna,
to complete the series comprised in the exchange proposition, and now
beg you to kindly arrange or have the Imperial Government arrange
for their delivery to some responsible party in Trieste.

The annual addition to this collection will be about three boxes, and
we desire instructions to deliver the same hereafter to the consul-general
in New York for transmission to Vienna.

As provided for in the stipulations of exchanges proposed through
Mr. Boehmer in 1884, we trust that the minister of foreign affairs in
Vienna may be pleased to arrange for the collecting from the various
departments and bureaus of the Government and from the scientific es-
tablishments and institutions under their care, of one copy each of allthe
publications made by them or under their direction, and to have the
same forwarded to the agent of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr. Felix
Fliigel, 39 Sidonien Strasse, Leipzig, who has received instructions
relative to their transmission to the United States.

With the assurance of my high consideration, etc.

SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary.

EXCHANGES WITH PERU.

On the 16th of May, 1867, the Smithsonian Institution, as the agent
of the United States Government for the exchange of official public
documents with foreign nations as provided for by act of March 2, 1867,
invited, among others, the Government of Peru to participate in- the
proposed exchange. The proposition was favorably received, and the
acceptance, on the part of the Peruvian Government, expressed in a let-
ter emanating from the foreign office in Lima, Peru, on the 380th De-
cember, 1867, and transmitted to the Smithsonian Institution through
the United States Department of State. (See Smithsonian Annual Re-
port for 1881, p. 760, 761; also History of Smithsonian Exchanges,
Washington, 1882, pp. 58-59.)

By some inexplicable oversight this subject was completely lost sight
of until in the beginning of the present fiscal year, when it was again
brought to notice by Mr. Elmore, then the representative of the Peru-
vian Government at Washington, and chief clerk of the Peruvian for-
eign office in 1867, at the time of the acceptance of the proposition on
the part of his Government. :

In consequence relations were at once established, of which the fol-
lowing correspondence is a portion, and which terminated in the trans-

mission, by the Smithsonian Institution, of a set of twenty cases, ad-
dressed to the Government of Peru at Lima:

Prof. Spencer F. Baird to the Secretary of State.

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 2, 1886.

Str: During the administration of my predecessor in office, the la-
mented Professor Henry, a letter dated February 8, 1868, was received
from the then Secretary of State, Hon. William H. Seward, transmit-
ting a note from the foreign office at Lima with reference to a proposi-
tion from this Institution for an exchange of official documents with the
Republic of Peru. Printed copies of this correspondence I inclose.

In some inexplicable way the subject has been entirely lost sight of and
has only just been brought to the light; and I beg to state that the In-
stitution is now anxious to resume negotiations with the Peruvian Gov-
ernment relative to the proposed exchange.

The Smithsonian Institution as the agent for international exchanges
on the part of the United States Government is prepared to furnish the
Government of Peru with a collection of several thousand volumes of
documents published by the United States since 1868. These can be
delivered to the Peruvian consul at New York free of charge. The re-
turns of publications on the part of Peru, which should be full and in
as complete series as possible, should be delivered free of charge to the
United States consulat Callao. The returns will be placed inthe Library
of Congress in accordance with existing law. The Peruvian Govern-

‘Inent, if desirous of renewing its acceptance of the proposition of the

Institution, should, of course, furnish us with the name of the depart-
ment designated to receive the books transmitted on behalf of the
United States.

We should also be pleased to have the Peruvian department to which
the business of the exchange is assigned take charge of and distribute
the miscellaneous scientific exchanges presented by societies and indi-
viduals, through the Smithsonian Institution, to correspondents in that
country, the Institution guaranteeing a like service for any parcels of
Similar character for the United States and Europe.

WASHINGTON, July 31, 1886.
My Drar Sir: I take the liberty to call your attention to a matter of great inter-
est and of much importance for Peru, and which, if the suggestion Iam about to
make is carried out, will be a source of real joy among all Peruvians who desire to

study and know better the United States and who wish to develop their own coun-
try by the arts of peace. I refer to the execution of the agreement in 1867 between
Peru and the United States to exchange their respective Government publications.

This system of international exchanges, authorized by an act of Congress, Mareh
2, 1867, proposed to foreign nations, through the State Department, in a circular by
the Smithsonian Institution, May 16, 1867, was ‘‘accepted in all of its terms” by a
decree of the President of Pern on 27th December, 1867. (See pages 58 and 59 of “A
History of the Smithsonian Exchanges,” by George H. Boehmer, from the Smith-
sonian Report for 1881.)

Through causes too long to state in this letter the exchange with Peru was imper-
fectly carried out, or not at all. Of course Peru, under any circumstances, would be
benefited by the exchanges more than the United States; but it is precisely on this
account that I now beg to be allowed to address you on the subject, because my ob-
ject is to request you to do Pern a great service, now needed more than at any time
before.

It is known that one of the first acts of the Chilians when they occupisd Lima in
1881 was to sack and destroy or carry away completely the whole of the old and
valuable library of Lima. The Peruvian Government in 1383 began to take steps to
form a new library, which has been created, having at present about 30,000 volumes,
mostly the gift of foreign governments and institutions and of literary men and
other private individuals.

During Secretary Frelinghuysen’s time I made some etforts to obtain a few works
of interest from this country, which in 18384 I presented to the new national library
of Lima. But most of the United States publications destined for Peru since 1868
are kept in deposit, packed up in boxes, in the Smithsonian Institution, awaiting the
order of your Government to be sent to the Peruvian Government, who will in return
send to the Smithsonian Institution, for the Library of Congress, a full set of the offi-
cial and other publications of Peru.

As now, after many years of disorder, Peru has a regularly elected constitutional
government, the opportunity to send the Smithsonian exchanges to Peru is most
admirable, and the benefit you will confer on Peru will be very great and will be
fully appreciated.

On the 9th of August, probably, a gentleman of New York, intimately connected
with the commerce of Peru, and whose firm (that of Messrs. W. R. Grace & Co., Han-
over Square, New York) holds important contracts with the Peruvian Government,
leaves for Lima. During a very long time no opportunity so good as this will pre-
sent itself to have the valuable Smithsonian collection sent to Peru. The books are
ready, packed up in about eighteen cases (measuring about 50 cubic feet), and con-
taining over 1,000 volumes.

The United States Government would have no expense in this matter. As usual,
the Smithsonian Institution would forward the cases to. New York, and Messrs. W.
R. Grace & Co. would attend to the shipping for account of the Peruvian Govern-
ment.

I earnestly beg you, Mr. Secretary, to let the books be sent at once to the Govern-
ment of Peru,-as, going as they would, under the personal care of Mr. W. R. Grace,
they would arrive with the greatest safety. The Smithsonian Institution only awaits
your directions to forward the cases to New York.

Believe me, etc.,
J. F. ELMORE.

Sir: Referring to your communication of August 2, in reply to a
letter from this Institution on the same subject, I beg to say that your
suggestion with reference to the publications of the United States for

Minister of foreign relations, Lima, to Hon. T. F. Bayard, Secretary of State.

Lima, Seplember 13, 1886.

Mr. MrnisTER: I have had the honor of receiving the very polite dispatch of your
excellency relative to the exchange of publications between Peru and the United
States.

In reply, I have the pleasure of manifesting to your excellency that my Govern-
ment has a lively desire to maintain the arrangement celebrated in 1867 with the
Smithsonian Institution, having to that end authorized the director of the national
library to make remittances of Peruvian works with such exactness as is possible.

My Government appreciates and esteems at its value this literary exchange between
two sister peoples of similar political institutions, in which is illustrated a spirit re-
dounding in benefits to society.

The library of Lima, which was destroyed by the invading army, has been re-
established through the generous co-operation of friendly Governments and foreign
scientific societies, among which the Smithsonian has distinguished its efforts superior
to all.

My Government desires, in making this expression of its gratitude, that through
the worthy medium of your excellency it be placed in the knowledge of the Secretary
of that Institution, manifesting at the same time that it will not omit efforts to per-
petually comply with the arrangement to which I have referred.

Reiterating with this motive to your excellency assurances of my most high and
distinguished consideration.

M. M. Rivas.

DEFECTS OF THE EXCHANGE SYSTEM.

In carrying on the operations of an international exchange of official
publications, the Smithsonian Institution, as the agent of the United
States Government, experiences two difficulties, which it has for many
years endeavored to overcome, without, however, fully accomplishing
the desired end. é

These obstacles are—

(1) The failure to procure the fifty copies of each and every public
document for exchange purposes; and

(2) The inability to secure, by means of correspondence alone, the
entire fruits of the wise provision of Congress in the way of adequate
returns from foreign Governments for the books sent by us.

The first point has been the subject of repeated appeal to Congress,
and I now beg to present the correspondence illustrating our last effort
in that direction :

The Smithsonian Institution to the Hon. A. R. Spofford, Librarian of
Congress.

WASHINGTON, D. C., February 21, 1887.

Sir: On the 7th of March, 1884, and on October 7, 1885, the Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution had the honor to address the Hon.
John Sherman, chairman of the Joint Library Committee of Congress,
as follows:

‘““After overcoming many obstacles, the Smithsonian system of ex-
changes has now been placed upon a most satisfactory basis, the only
difficulty of any magnitude yet remaining being inability on the part
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 47

of the Smithsonian Institution, as the Government intermediary, to
secure the entire fruit of the wise provision of Congress in the way of
fifty copies of each and every public document for exchange purposes,
and to this extent the system is yet imperfect. In the absence of strict
compliance with the stipulation that all works published by the United
States—its Congress, Executive Departments, Bureaus, etc.—shall be
furnished for the purpose, the Institution can hardly exact from foreign
Governments that have entered into an international exchange alliance
copies of everything they, respectively, issue.

“ T would therefore ask you respectfully to consider the several enact-
ments upon the subject of international exchange, and that such supple-
mentary legislation be provided as will enable us to surmount the diffi-
culty referred to.”

In the absence of any action on the subject as requested, Professor
Baird, on the 18th of January, 1886, addressed himself to the Hon.
William J. Sewell, chairman of the Joint Library Committee of Con-
gress, as follows:

“It again becomes the duty of the Smithsonian Institution, as the
agent for the Government exchanges under appointmentof Congressional
actof March 2, 1867, to suggest a review by the Library Committee of
the several enactments upon the subject of international exchanges, to
the end that such additional legislation be provided as will render the
Institution able to enforce strict compliance (on the part of the Public
Printer and the various Departments aud Bureaus of the Government)
with the order of Congress that all works published by the United States
of America, whether by its Congress, its Executive Departments, or its Bu-
reaus, and whether printed at the Public Printing Office or elsewhere, be
furnished the Smithsonian Institution in fifty copies of each of the three
distinct series, as specified in the acts of March 2, 1867, and July 25, 1865,
and without which the Government of the United States, through the
Library of Congress, will fail to reap the full benefit of that complete
exchange which was intended and desired when the American Congress
first exhibited its enlightened liberality in the wise provision for an ex-
change of United States official publications for those of foreign na-
tions.”

The letter was accompanied by a memorandum specifying the various
enactments ou international exchange, and illustrating the defects of
existing laws on the subject.

No attention, however, was given by the Joint Library Committee to
the request for a consideration of the requirements as pointed out by
the Institution, and the present session of Congress drawing to a close
without any action having been had in relation to it, I beg to invite
your co-operation—as the party most interested in the results of the
' service—by requesting you to bring the matter before the proper com-
mittee, for whose information and guidance, in connection with any new
legislation which it may deem proper to suggest for the consideration
of Congress, I inclose herewith a brief sketch of existing laws on the
subject.

In order to obtain for the international exchange the advantages de-
sired by Congress, the laws governing it should be amended so as to
make it obligatory on the part of the Public Printer, the Executive De-
partments and Bureaus of the Government to furnish the fifty copies
of each and every publication made by them, of whatever class or de-
ae called for by the original acts of March 2, 1867, and July 25,

48 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

{Inclosure.

On the 2d day of March, 1867, Congress passed the following reso-
lution (Stat. at Large, vol. 14, p. 573):

‘Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled, That fifty copies of all documents here-
after printed by order of either House of Congress, and fifty copies ad-
ditional of all documents printed in excess of the usual number, together
with fifty copies of each publication issued by any Department or
Bureau of the Government, be placed at the disposal of the Joint Com-
mittee on the Library, who shall exchange the same, through the agency
of the Smithsonian Institution, for such works published in foreign
countries, and especially by foreign Governments, as may be deemed
by said committee an equivalent; said works to be deposited in the
Library of Congress.”

This resolution provides, as plainly and distinctly expressed, for three
times fifty copies of certain official publications, or, rather, for fifty
copies each of three different and distinct issues into which the publi-
cations of the United States Government may be classed:

I. The Congressional issue, consisting of series of journals, reports of
committees, miscellaneous documents, and executive documents.

IT. The annual reports of the Executive Departments and Bureaus of
the Government.

ITI. The memoirs, monographs, and special reports published by the
Executive Departments and Bureaus of the Government.

Of the first issue (the Congressional), the wsual number printed is, as
prescribed in section 3792 Revised Statutes, ‘fifteen hundred and fifty
copies of any document ordered by Congress,” ete., increased to nineteen
hundred, which includes the installments for distribution by the Con-
gressional Library and for exchange in foreign countries.

Section 3799 provides that ‘“‘of the documents printed by order of
either House of Congress there shall be printed and bound fifty addi-
tional copies for the purpose of exchange in foreign countries.”

The second series is formed by the “ extra copies” ordered to be
printed by Congress in addition to the usual number, and represent the
annual report of the Executive Departments and Bureaus of the Gov-
ernment, Reports on Foreign Affairs, Commerce and Navigation, Com-
mercial Relations, etc., and as such form each an independent series of
Government publications.

Relative to this issue, section 3796 Revised Statutes provides: ‘ The
Congressional Printer shall, when so directed by the Joint Committee
on the Library, print in addition to the usual number either fifty or one
hundred copies, as he may be directed, of all documents printed by
either House of Congress or by any Department or Bureau of the Gov-
ernment.

Resolution No. 72, second session Fortieth Congress (approved July 25,
1868), a resolution to carry into effect the resolution approved March 2,
1867, providing for the exchange of certain public documents, specifies :
‘* That the Congressional Printer, whenever he shall be so directed by
the Joint Committee on the Library, be, and he hereby is, directed to
print fifty copies in addition to the regular number of all documents
hereafter printed by order of either House of Congress, or by order of
any Department or Bureau of the Government, and whenever he shall

_be so directed by the Joint Committee on the Library, one hundred
copies additional of all documents ordered to be printed in excess of the
usual number ; said fifty or one hundred copies to be delivered to the
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 49

Librarian of Congress, to be exchanged under the direction of the Joint
Committee on the Library, as provided for by joint resolution approved
March 2, 1867.”

The third series, the memoirs, monographs, or special reports pub-
lished by the Executive Departments and Bureaus of the Government,
is provided for by section 2 of the above joint resolution No. 72, sec-
ond session Fortieth Congress, approved July 25, 1868—a resolution to
carry into effect the resolution approved March 2, 1867, providing for
the exchange of certain public documents, as follows: ‘ And be tt further
resolved, That fifty copies of each publication, printed under the direc-
tion of any Department or Bureau of the Government, whether at the
Congressional Printing Oftice or elsewhere, shall be placed at the dis-
posal of the Joint Committee on the Library to carry out the provision
of said resolution.”

Subsequent to this resolution becoming a law the Hon. EH. D. Morgan,
chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library, addressed the fol-
lowing letter to the Public Priater, J. D. Defrees, esq. :

‘““ WASHINGTON, D. C., October 24, 1868.

‘““T have the honor to eall your attention to the provisions of the reso-
lution of Congress inclosed, approved July 25, 1868, and to request that
the fifty copies of all documents now being printed and hereafter to be
printed at the Congressional Printing Office, whether by order of either
House of Congress or any of the Departments or Bureaus of the Gov-
ernment, be furnished by you, as fast as each edition is printed and
bound, to the Librarian of Congress, for the purpose specified in the
resolution.

‘““T would also request that of the Patent Office report and Agricult-
ural report now being printed one hundred copies additional (or one
hundred and fifty copies in all) be delivered to the Librarian for the pur-
pose indicated.”

On September 22, 1869, the Librarian of Congress addressed the
Public Printer, on the subject of books required by law for the inter-
national exchange of official documents as follows:

‘“ Your attention is respectfully called to the provisions of the reso-
lution of Congress approved July 25, 1868, requiring the Congressional
Printer to furnish to the Librarian of Congress fifty copies of all docu-
ments printed under whatever authority for the purpose of exchanging
the same for the publications of foreign Governments, which are to be
deposited in this Library.

‘“ The official direction from the chairman of the Joint Committee on
the Library, to printand deliver these documents required by the resolu-
tion, was communicated to your predecessor, Mr. J. D. Defrees, on the 24th
of October, 1868. (See letter of Hon. E. D. Morgan, chairman, of that
date.) The only reply received was a verbal one from Mr. Defrees, to
the undersigned, that the documents should be regularly forwarded,
and that the one hundred and fifty copies (fifty regular and one hundred
extra) of the Agricultural and Patent Office reports for 1867, then on
the press, would also be supplied. Not having received any documents
whatever under this act of Congress, and the purpose of the same being
to enrich the Library with as large a number and variety of the docu-
ments of foreign Governments as can be procured in exchange for our
own, you are requested to have placed at my disposal fifty copies of
each book, pamphlet, circular, army order, or other publication, by
whatever authority printed, and one hundred copies additional of all

50 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

documents printed in excess of the usual number, to enable me to carry
out the resolution of Congress referred to.”

And again in reply to an inquiry on the part of the Public Printer,
the following communication was addressed to that official on Septem-
ber 30, 1869:

“In reference to the documents not of Congress, but of the Depart-
ments and Bureaus of the Government, of which fifty copies are required
by resolution of Congress to be furnished to the Library for interna-
tional exchange, I have to say that all such documents as are printed
at the public expense (with the single exception of printed instructions
or confidential official communications) are important and will properly
be furnished. The foreign Governments with which the exchanges are
made furnish us with great fullness the specially printed documents they
print in each department of their public service, and itis desired to
make a return in kind.”

Owing to the failure of the Public Printer to comply with those por-
tions of the law relating to the second and third series of the United
States official publications, the annual reports of the Executive De-
partments and Bureaus of the Government, and the memoirs, mono-
graphs, and special reports by the Executive Departments and Bureaus
of the Government, although ovcasionally some few of the works of
these classes have been received, a circular letter was addressed by
the Smithsonian Institution on the 15th of February, 1884, to all the
Departments and Bureaus of the Government, soliciting co-operation,
in compliance with the existing laws, to enable the Institution, as
agent of the Government, to carry out the provisions of the Congres-
sional resolutions.

Among the replies received, that of the Hon. Secretary of State
Says:

I have ventured to suggest to the Joint Committee on the Library
the desirability of a permanent provision for the printing of these re-
quired copies.

Appended to the letter of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti.
tution of March 7, 1884, is a list of the more important documents not
furnished to the Smithsonian Institution although they are embraced
in the series intended by Congress for exchange purposes.

Among the documents not furnished by the Public Printer may
again be mentioned the following (assuming series I, the Congressional
issue, to be complete as delivered, although even therein are many de-
ficiencies) :

Series Il. The annual reports of the Executive Departments and Bu-
reaus of the Government, together with the papers accompanying such
reports. (Section 3796, Rev. Stat., and Resol. 72, second sess. Fortieth
Congr.)

Series IIT. The memoirs, monographs, or special reports published by
the Executive Departments or Bureaus of the Government, whether
printed at the Government Printing Office, or elsewhere. (Section 2,
Resolution No, 72, second session Fortieth Congr.)
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 51

This last series comprises, among many others, the following valuable
publications :
Patent Office :
Official Gazette—thirty-two volumes published.
Specifications and Drawings—two hundred volumes published
since 1872.
Growth of Industrial Art—two volumes, folio. Of this only fifty
copies were printed.
U. S. Geological Survey : :
Bulletins—thirty numbers issued.
Monographs—eleven volumes issued, of which only Vol. 11 and At-
las were received. :

A letter was addressed to the Director of the Survey, February 18,
1884, claiming fifty copies of all the publications of that office for ex-
change purposes under the law. In reply the Director states, Febru-
ary 26, 1884:

Under the law of March 2, 1867, fifty copies of everything published
by us should be sent to the Library of Congress, and thence to the
Smithsonian Institution by the Public Printer, and such copies are re-
served for’ that purpose, and do not come into our possession.

Under the statutes relating to the publication of the monographs of
the Geological Survey it would be impossible to spare any copies from
the three thousand received by this office from the fact that it is neces-
ary for the Survey to render an account of its publications, either as
sold, exchanged, or on hand.

Ethnological Bureau :
Contributions to North American Ethnology. Only vols. 1, 3, and
4 received.
Pilling: Proof-sheets of North American Languages. Of this only
one hundred copies were printed.

Tenth Census of the United States :
Monographs. Not one has been received.

Fish Commission :
Bulletins, vols. 1-5.

State Department:
Consular Reports. Only the first twenty-two have been received,

Coast and Geodetic Survey:
Publications.

American and Foreign Claims Commissions:

France, Hayti, Spain, Alabama, etc., neither of which has been re-
ceived.

And, in fact, all the publications of the Departments and Bureaus of
the Government, as independent series, although they may have been
furnished as Congressional (miscellaneous) documents, which, however,
constitute a distinct series (I) in themselves.
52 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

The second point, the inability to secure the entire fruits of the pro-
visions of Congress, in the way of adequate returns, was fully discussed
by Professor Baird on page 20 of the Annual Report of the Smithson-
ian Institution for 1885, by Mr. Spofford, the Librarian of Congress, on
pages 25 and 26 of the Smithsonian Report for the fiscal year 1885~86,
and by myself, in the appendix to each of these reports.

The remedy suggested in the case was based on the experience of my
mission to Europe, and the predictions ventured that, without the es-
tablishment of a permanent agency on the ground to attend personally
to the whole business, only temporary results would be obtained, are
fully borne out by the experience of the past year.

While the returns secured by my personal efforts comprise 44 cases
and 160 packages of books, numbering about 7,000 volumes, collected
from fourteen European Governments, the returns of the present year
received from European Governments through the medium of the ex:
change service represent only 3 boxes and about 250 volumes of books.
GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1886-87.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX is to furnish summaries of
scientific discovery in particular directions; occasional reports of the
investigations made by collaborators of the Institution; memoirs of a
general character or on special topics, whether original and prepared
expressly for the purpose, or selected from foreign journals and proceed-
ings; and briefly to present (as fully as space will permit) such papers
not published in the “‘Smithsonian Contributions” or in the “ Miscella-
neous Collections” as may be supposed to be of interest or value to the
numerous correspondents of the Institution.

5d
RECORD OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS.

INTRODUCTION.

While it has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution, from a very early date in its history, to enrich
the annual report required of them by law, with scientific memoirs illus-
trating the more remarkable and important developments in physical
and biological discovery, as well as showing the general character of
the operations of the Institution, this purpose had not been carried out
on any very systematic plan. Believing however that an annual report
or summary of the recent advances made in the leading departments
of scientific inquiry would supply a want very generally felt, and would
be favorably received by all those interested in the diffusion of knowl-
edge, the Secretary had prepared for the report of 1880, by competent
collaborators, a series of abstracts showing concisely the prominent
features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology, physics,
chemistry, mineralogy, botony, zodlogy, and anthropology.

The same general programme has been followed in the subsequent
reports, until the last, that for 1886, when the incompleteness of the
record obtained, the discouragement from the increasing delay encoun-
tered in the printing of the annual summaries, and other considera-
tions, induced the temporary suspension of the project. The postponed
contributions are herewith presented, with the regret that the expected
articles on meteorology and on botany are unavoidably omitted by
reason of the pressing occupations of Professors Abbe and Farlow,
their accustomed expositors, having prevented the undertaking.

With every effort to secure prompt attention to the more important
details of a general survey of the annual progress of scientific discov-
ery, experience has shown that various unexpected delays render it
impracticable to obtain all the desired reports in each department within
the time prescribed ; and the plan attempted of bringing up the defi-
ciencies in subsequent reports has not proved entirely satisfactory.

An appropriate introduction to the annual record is found in Professor
Huxley’s excellent sketeh of the Advance of Science in the Last Half
Century, which is herewith reprinted by permission of the publisher
and of the author. This paper is one of a series setting forth the legis-
lative, political, and civil condition of England during the reign of Queen
Victoria, the progress of the nation in industrial arts, education, sci-

56 RECORD OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS.

ence, literature, arts, etc., as a memorial of the jubilee year of the
Queen, which was celebrated June 20, 1887. This semi-centennial cor-
responds—not, indeed, with the period of the life of the Smithsonian
Institution, but with the interval from the time of secaring the Smith-
son fund to the United States. The formal organization of the Insti-
tution was not effected till nearly ten years later.

Notwithstanding the acknowledged educational value of these gen-
eral summaries of the annual advances of scientific investigation, and the
popular interest that has been manifested in this feature of the Smith-
sonian Reports, varions difficulties in the practical execution of the
scheme have arisen to render the continuance of the experiment of
doubtiul expediency. In view of the numerous important fields of
scientific inquiry which have been necessarily omitted from the pro-
gramme, for lack of space for their presentation, (such as mathematics,
physiology, microscopy, ete.,) as well as of the entire domain of the
more popular topics embraced in the practical applications of science,
(such as horticultural and agricultural economy, engineering, mechanics,
and technology in general,)—the policy of attempting so inadequate a
survey of intellectual and industrial advancement, with its ever-increas-
ing range and complexity of development, may well be questioned. To
all this must be added the consideration that the numerous demands
upon the limited Smithsonian fund render it unable to bear the burden
that a just award to the collaborators engaged would require from it.

Accordingly after perhaps another year of the more systematic treat-
ment of scientific progress as latterly undertaken, it is probable that it
may be thought advisable to revert to the earlier plan of publishing
each year a number of papers possessing a popular interest—selected
from foreign and domestic scientific journals or the Proceedings and
Transactions of learned societies, together with such original articles as
may appear to deserve general attention.
ADVANCE OF SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.*

By lan Buximy, 1. 5R. 8:

The most obvious and the most distinctive feature of the history of
civilization during the last fifty years is the wonderful increase of in-
dustrial production by the application of machinery, the improvement
of old technical processes and the invention of new ones, accompanied
by an even more remarkable development of old and new means of lo-
comotion and inter-communication. By this rapid and vast multiplica-
tion of the commodities and conveniences of existence, the general
standard of comfort has been raised; the ravages of pestilence and
famine have been checked; and the natural obstacles, which time and
space offer to mutual intercourse, have been reduced in a manner and
to an extent unknown to former ages. The diminution or removal of
local ignorance and prejudice, the creation of common interests among
the most widely separated peoples, and the strengthening of the forces
of the organization of the commonwealth against those of political or
social anarchy, thus effected, have exerted an influence on the present
and future fortunes of mankind the full significance of which may be
divined, but can not as yet be estimated at its full value.

This revolution—for it is nothing less—in the political and social as-
pects of modern civilization has been preceded, accompanied, and in
great measure caused by a less obvious, but no less marvellous, increase
of natural knowledge, and especially of that part of it which is known
as physical science, in consequence of the application of scientific
method to the investigation of the phenomena of the material world.
Not that the growth of physical science is an exclusive prerogative of
the Victorian age. Its present strength and volume merely indicate
the highest level of a stream which took its rise, alongside of the primal
founts of Philosophy, Literature, and Art, in ancient Greece ; and, after

sages of antiquity who for eight centuries, from the time of Thales to
that of Galen, toiled at the foundations of physical science. But, with-
out entering into the discussion of that large question, it is certain that
the labors of these early workers in the field of natural knowledge were
brought to a standstill by the decay and disruption of the Roman Em-
pire, the consequent disorganization of society, and the diversion of
men’s thoughts from sublunary matters to the problems of the super-
natural world suggested by Christian dogma in the Middle Ages. And,
notwithstanding sporadic attempts to recall men to the investigation of
nature here and there, it was not until the fifteenth and sixteenth cen-
turies that physical science made a new start, founding itself at first
altogether upon that which had been done by the Greeks. Indeed, it
must be admitted that the men of the Renaissance, though standing on
the shoulders of the old philosophers, were a long time before they saw
as much as their forerunners had done.

The first serious attempts to carry further the unfinished work of
Archimedes, Hipparchus, and Ptolemy, of Aristotle and of Galen,
naturally enough arose among the astronomers and the physicians.
Hor the imperious necessity of seeking some remedy for the physical
ills of life had insured the preservation of more or less of the wisdom
of Hippocrates and his successors, and, by a happy conjunction of cir-
cumstances, the Jewish and Arabian physicians and philosophers
escaped many of the influences which at that time blighted natural
knowledge in the Christian world. On the other hand, the supersti-
tious hopes and fears which afforded countenance to astrology and to
alchemy also sheltered astronomy and the germs of chemistry.
Whether for this or for some better reason the founders of the schools
of the Middle Ages included astrenomy along with geometry, arith-
metic, and music as one of the four branches of advanced education,
and in this respect it is only just to them to observe that they were far
in advance of those who sit in their seats. The schoolmen considered
no one to be properly educated unless he were acquainted with—at any
rate—one branch of physical science. We have not even yet reached
that stage of enlightenment.

In the early decades of the seventeenth century the men of the Re-
naissance could show that they had already put out to good interest the
treasure bequeathed to them by the Greeks. They had produced the
astronomical system of Copernicus, with Kepler’s great additions; the
astronomical discoveries and the physical investigations of Galileo; the
mechanics of Stevinus and the “De Magnete” of Gilbert; the anatomy
of the great French and Italian schools and the physiology of Harvey.
In Italy, which had succeeded Greece in the hegemony of the scientific
world, the Accademia dei Lyncei, and sundry other such associations
for the investigation of nature, the models of all subsequent academies
and scientific societies, had been founded, while the literary skill and
biting wit of Galileo had made the great scientific questions of the day
not only intelligible, but attractive, to the general public.
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 59
FRANCIS BACON.

In our own country Francis Bacon had essayed to sum up the past of
physical seience, and to indicate the path which it must follow if its
ereat destinies were to be fulfilled. And though the attempt was just
such a magnificent failure as might have been expected from a man of
great endowments, who was so singularly devoid of scientific insight
that he could not understand the value of the work already achieved by
the true instaurators of physical science, yet the majestic eloquence
and the fervid vaticinations of one who was conspicuous alike by the
greatness of his rise and the depth of his fall, drew the attention of all
the world to the ‘‘new birth of Time.”

. But it is not easy to discover satisfactory evidence that the ‘* Novum
Organum” had any direct beneficial influence on the advancement of
natural knowledge. No delusion is greater than the notion that method
and industry can make up for lack of mother wit, either in science or
in practical life, and it is strange that, with his knowledge of mankind,
Bacon should have dreamed that his or any other ‘ via inveniendi sci-
entias” would “level men’s wits” and leave little scope for that inborn
capacity which is called genius. As a matter of fact, Bacon’s “ via”
has proved hopelessly impracticable, while the “ Anticipation of Na-
ture,” by the invention of hypotheses based on incomplete inductions,
which he specially condemns, has proved itself to be a most efficient,
indeed an indispensable, instrument of scientific progress. Finally,
that transcendental alchemy, the superinducement of new forms on mat-
ter, which Bacon declares to be the supreme aim of science, has been
wholly ignored by those who have created the physical knowledge of
the present day.

Even the eloquent advocacy of the chancellor brought no unmixed
good to physical science. It was natural enough that the man who, in
his better moments, took ‘ali knowledge for his patrimony,” but, in his
worse, sold that birthright for the mess of pottage of court favor and
professional success, for pomp and show, should be led to attach an
undue value to the practical advantages which he foresaw, as Roger
Bacon and, indeed, Seneca had foreseen, long before his time, must
follow in the train of the advancement of natural knowledge. The
burden of Bacon’s pleadings for science is the “ gathering of fruit ”—the
importance of winning solid material advantages by the investigation
of nature and the desirableness of limiting the application of scientific
methods of inquiry to that field.

THOMAS HOBBES.

Bacon’s younger contemporary, Hobbes, casting aside the prudent
reserve of his predecessor in regard to those matters about which the
Crown or the Church might have something to say, extended scientific
methods of inquiry to the phenomena of mind and the problems of
60 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

social organization; while, at the same time, he indicated the boundary
between the province of real, and that of imaginary, knowledge. The
‘Principles of Philosophy” and the “Leviathan” embody a coherent
system of purely scientific thought in language which is*a model of
clear and vigorous English style.

DESCARTES.

At the same time, in France, a man of far greater scientific capacity
than either Bacon or Hobbes, René Descartes, not only in his immortal
“Discours de la Méthode” and elsewhere, went down to the foundations
of scientific certainty, but, in his ‘* Principes de Philosophie,” indicated
where the goal of physical science really lay. However, Descartes was
an eminent mathematician, and it would seem that the bent of his mind
led him to over-estimate the value of deductive reasoning from general
principles, as much as Bacon had under-estimated it. The progress of
physical science has been effected neither by Baconians nor by Cartes-
ians—as such, but by men like Galileo and Harvey, Boyle and Newton,
who would have done their work just as well if neither Bacon nor Des-
cartes had ever propounded his views respecting the manner in which
scientific investigation should be pursued.

PROGRESS WITHOUT “FRUITS.”

The progress of science, during the first century after Bacon’s death,
by no means Verified his sanguine prediction of the fruits which it would
yield. For, though the revived and renewed study of nature had spread
and grown to an extent which surpassed reasonable expectation, the
practical results—the ‘‘good to men’s estate”—were at first by no
means apparent. Sixty years after Bacon’s death, Newton had crowned
the long labors of the astronomers and the physicists by co-ordinating
the phenomena of molar motion throughout the visible universe into one
vast system; but the “ Principia” helped no man to either wealth or
comfort. Descartes, Newton, and Leibnitz had opened up new worlds
tothe mathematician, but the acquisitions of their genius enriched only
man’s ideal estate. Descartes had laid the foundations of rational
cosmogony and of physiological psychology; Boyle had produced models
of experimentation in various branches of physics and chemistry; Pascal
and Torricelli had weighed the air; Malpighi and Grew, Ray and Wil-
loughby had done work of no less importance in the biological sciences;
but weaving and spinning were carried on with the old appliances;
nobody could travel faster by sea or by land than at any previous time
in the world’s history, and King George could send a message from
London to York no faster than King John might have done. Metals
were worked from their ores by immemorial rule of thumb, and the
center of the iron trade of these islands was still among the oak forests
of Sussex. The utmost skill of our mechanicians did not get beyond
the production of a coarse watch.
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 61

The middle of the eighteenth century is illustrated by a host of great
names in science—English, French, German, and Italian,—especially in
the fields of chemistry, geology, and biology; but this deepening and
broadening of natural knowledge produced next to no immediate prac-
tical benefits. Even if,at this time, Francis Bacon could have returned
to the scene of his greatness and of his littleness, he must have re-
garded the philosophic world which praised and disregarded his pre-
cepts with great disfavor. If ghosts are consistent he would have
said, “These people are all wasting their time, just as Gilbert and Kep-
ler and Galileo and my worthy physician Harvey did in my day.
Where are the fruits of the restoration of science which I promised?
This accumulation of bare knowledge is all very well, but cui bono?
Not one of these people is doing what I told him specially to do, and
seeking that secret of the cause of forms which will enable men to deal
at will with matter, and super-induce new natures upon the old founda.
tions.”

LATER PRACTICAL EFFECT.

But, a little later, that growth of knowledge beyond imaginable utili-
tarian ends, which is the condition precedent of its practical utility,
began to produce some effect upon practical life; and the operation of
that part of nature we call human upon the rest began to create, not
‘new natures,” in Bacon’s sense, but a new Nature, the existence of
which is dependent upon men’s efforts, which is subservient to their
wants, and which would disappear if man’s shaping and guiding hand
were withdrawn. [Every mechanical artifice, every chemically pure
substance employed in manufacture, every abnormally fertile race of
plants, or rapidly growing and fattening breed of animals, is a part of
the new Nature created by science. Without it the most densely pop-
ulated regions of modern Europe and America must retain their primi-
tive, sparsely inhabited, agricultural or pastoral condition: it is the
foundation of our wealth and the condition of our safety from submer-
gence by another flood of barbarous hordes; it is the bond which unites
into a solid political whole, regions larger than any empire of antiquity ;
it secures us from the recurrence of the pestilences and famines of
former times; it is the source of endless comforts and conveniences,
which are not mere luxuries, but conduce to physical and moral well-
being. During the last fifty years, this new birth of time, this new
Nature begotten by science upon fact, has pressed itself daily and

hourly upon our attention, and has worked miracles which have modi-
fied the whole fashion of our lives.

What wonder, then, if these astonishing fruits of the tree of knowl-
edge are too often regarded by both friends and enemies as the be-all
and end-all of science? What wonder if some eulogize, and others
revile, the new philosophy for its utilitarian ends and its merely ma-
terial triumphs ?
62 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

In truth, the new philosophy deserves neither the praise of its eulo-
gists, nor the blame of its slanderers. As I have pointed out, 1ts disciples
were guided by no search after practical fruits during the great period
of its growth, and it reached adolescence without being stimulated by
any rewards of that nature. The bare enumeration of the names of the
men who were the great lights of science in the latter part of the eight-
eenth and the first decade of the nineteenth century, of Herschel, of
Laplace, of Young, of Fresnel, of Oersted, of Cavendish, of Lavoisier,
of Davy, of Lamarck, of Cuvier, of Jussieu, of Decandolle, of Werner,
and of Hutton, suffices to indicate the strength of physical science in
the age immediately preceding that of which I have to treat. But of
which of these great men can it be said that his labors were directed
to practical ends? I do not cail to mind even an invention of practical
utility which we owe to any of them, except the safety-lamp of Davy.
Werner certainly paid attention to mining, and I have not forgotten
James Watt. But, though some of the most important of the improve-
ments by which Watt converted the steam-engine, invented long before
his time, into the obedient slave of man, were suggested and guided by
his acquaintance with scientific principles, his skill as a practical mech-
anician and the efficieucy of Bolton’s workmen had quite as much to
do with the realization of his projects.

LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE.

In fact, the history of physical science teaches (and we can not too
carefully take the lesson to heart) that the practical advantages, attain-
able through its agency, never have been, and never will be, sufficiently
attractive to men inspired by the inborn genius of the interpreter of
nature, to give them courage to undergo the toils and make the sacri-
fices which that calling requires from its votaries. That which stirs
their pulses is the love of knowledge and the joy of the discovery of the
causes of things sung by the old poets; the supreme delight of extend-
ing the realm of law and order ever farther towards the unattainable
goals of the infinitely great and the infinitely small, between which our
little race of lifeisrun. In the course of this work, the physical philos-
opher, sometimes intentionally, much more often unintentionally, lights
upon something which proves to be of practical value. Great is the
rejoicing of those who are benefited thereby; and, for the moment,
science is the Diana of all the craftsmen. But, even while the cries of
jubilation resound, and this flotsam and jetsam of the tide of investi-
gation is being turned into the wages of workmen and the wealth of
capitalists, the crest of the wave of scientific investigation is far away
on its course over the illimitable ocean of the unknown.

SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY RECIPROCALLY DEPENDENT.

Far be it from me to depreciate the value of the gifts of science to
practical life, or to cast a doubt upon the propriety of the course of ac-
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 63

tion of those who follow science in the hope of finding wealth alongside
truth, or even wealth alone. Such a profession is as respectable as any
other. And quite as little do I desire to ignore the fact that, if industry
owes a heavy debt to science, it has largely repaid the loan by the inm-
portant aid which it has, in its turn, rendered to the advancement of
science. In considering the causes which hindered the progress of
physical knowledge in the schools of Athens and of Alexandria, it has
often struck me* that where the Greeks did wonders was in just those
branches of science, such as geometry, astronomy, and anatomy, which
are susceptible of very considerable development without any, or any
but the simplest, appliances. It is a curious speculation to think what
would have become of modern physical science if glass and alcohol had
not been easily obtainable; and if the gradual perfection of mechanical
skill for industrial ends had not enabled investigators to obtain, at com-
paratively little cost, microscopes, telescopes, and all the exquisitely
delicate apparatus for determining weight and measure and for estimat-
ing the lapse of time with exactness, which they now command. If
science has rendered the colossal development of modern industry pos-
sible, beyond a doubt industry has done no less for modern physics and
chemistry, and for a great deal of modern biology. And as the captains
of industry have at last begun to be aware that the condition of suc-
cess in that warfare, under the forms of peace, which is kuown as in-
dustrial competition lies in the discipline of the troops and the use of
arms of precision, just as much as it does in the warfare which is called
war, their demand for that discipline, which is technical education, is
re-acting upon science in a manner which will assuredly stimulate its
future growth to an incalculable extent. It kas become obvious that
the interests of science and of industry are identical; that sciencé can
not make a step forward without sooner or later opening up new
channels for industry, and on the other hand, that every advance of
industry facilitates those experimental investigations upon which the
growth of science depends. We may hope that at last the weary mis-
understanding between the practical men who professed to despise
science, and the high and dry philosophers who professed to despise
practical results, is at an end.

Nevertheless, that which is true of the infancy of physical science in
the Greek world, that which is true of its adolescence in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, remains true of its riper age in these latter
days of the nineteenth century. The great steps in its progress have
been made, are made, and will be made, by men who seek knowledge
simply because they crave it. They have their weaknesses, their follies,
their vanities, and their rivalries, like the rest of the world; but what-
ever by-ends may mar their dignity and impede their usefulness, this

* There are excellent remarks to the same effect in Zeller’s Philosophie der Griechen,

pp. 138 et seq.
64 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

chief end redeems them.* Nothing great in science has ever been done
by men, whatever their powers, in whom the divine afflatus of the
truth-seeker was wanting. Men of moderate capacity have done great
things because it animated them; and men of great natural gifts have
failed, absolutely or relatively, because they lacked this one thing
needful.

TRUE OBJECT OF RESEARCH.

To any one who knows the business of investigation practically,
Bacon’s notion of establishing a company of investigators to work for
“fruits,” as if the pursuit of knowledge were a kind of mining opera-
tion and only required well directed picks and shovels, seems very
strange.t In science, as in art, and, as I believe, in every other sphere
of human activity, there may be wisdom in a multitude of counsellors,
but it is only in one or two of them. And in scientific inquiry at any
rate, it is to that one or two that we must look for hight and guidance.
Newton said that he made his discoveries by “intending” his mind on
the subject; no doubt truly. But to equal his success one must have
the mind which he “intended.” Forty lesser men might have intended
their minds till they cracked, without any like result. It would be idle
either to affirm or to deny that the last half century has produced men
of science of the caliber of Newton. It is sufficient that it can show a
few capacities of the first rank, competent not only to deal profitably
with the inheritance bequeathed by their scientific forefathers, but to
pass on to their successors physical truths of a higher order than any
yet reached by the human race. And if they have succeeded as New-
ton succeeded, it is because they have sought truth as he sought it, with
no other object than the finding it.

PROGRESS FROM 1837 TO 1887.

IT am conscious that in undertaking to give even the briefest sketch
of the progress of physical science, in all its branches, during the last

* Fresnel, after a brilliant career of discovery in some of the most difficult regions
of physico-mathematical science, died at thirty-nine years of age. The following pas-
sage of a letter from him to Young (written in November, 1824), quoted by Whewell,
so aptly illustrates the spirit which animates the scientific inquirer, that I may cite it:

‘‘For a long time that sensibility, or that vanity, which people call love of glory
is much blunted in me. I labor much less to catch the suffrages of the public than
to obtain an inward approval which has always been the mental reward of my efforts.
Without doubt I have often wanted the spur of vanity to excite me to pursue my re-
searches in monients of disgust and discouragement. But all the compliments which
I have received from MM. Arago, De Laplace, or Biot, never gave me so much pleas-
ure as the discovery of a theoretical truth or the confirmation of a calculation by ex-
periment.”

t ‘“Mémorable exemple de ’impuissance des recherches collectives appliquées a la
découverte des vérités nouvelles,” says one of the most distinguished of living French
savants, of the corporate chemical work of the old Académie des Sciences. (See Ber-
thelot, Science et Philosophie, p. 201.)
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 65

half century, I may be thought to have exhibited more courage than
discretion, and perhaps more presumption than either. So far as phys-
ical science is concerned, the days of Adntirable Crichtons have long
been over, and the most indefatigable of hard workers may think he
has done well if he has mastered one of its minor subdivisions. Never-
theless, it is possible for any one who has familiarized himself with the
operations of science in one department, to comprehend the significance,
and even to form a general estimate of the value, of the achievements
of specialists in other departments.

Nor is there any lack either of guidance, or of aids to ignorance. By
a happy chance, the first edition of Whewell’s “ History of the Induce-
tive Sciences” was published in 1837, and it affords a very useful view
of the state of things at the commencement of the Victorian epoch. As
to subsequent events, there are numerous excellent summaries of the
progress of various branches of science, especially up to 1881, which
was the jubilee year of the British Association.* And, with respect to
the biological sciences, with some parts of which my studies have fa-
miliarized me, my personal experience nearly coincides with the pre-
ceding half century. I may hope therefore that my chance of escap-
ing serious errors is aS good as that of any one else who might have
been persuaded to undertake the somewhat perilous enterprise in which
I find myself engaged.

There is yet another prefatory remark which it seems desirable I
should make. It is that I think it proper to confine myself to the work
done, without saying anything about the doers of it. Meddling with
questions of merit and priority is a thorny business at the best of times,
and, unless in case of necessity, altogether undesirable when one is
dealing with contempdéraries. No such necessity lies upon me; and
I shall therefore mention no names of living men, lest perchance I
should incur the reproof which the Israelites, who struggled with one
another in the field, addressed to Moses, ‘ Who made thee a prince and
a judge over us?”

AIM OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE.

Physical science is one and indivisible. AJthough for practical pur-
poses it is convenient to mark it out into the primary regions of Phys-
ics Chemistry, and Biology, and to subdivide these into subordinate
provinces, yet the method of investigation and the ultimate object of
the physical inquirer are everywhere the same.

The object is the discovery of the rational order which pervades the
universe; the method consists of observation and experiment (which
is observation under artificial conditions) for the determination of the

*I am particularly indebted to my friend and colleague Professor Riicker, F. R. S.,
for the many acute criticisms and suggestions on my remarks respecting the ultimate
problems of physics, with which he has favored me, and by which I have greatly
profited.

H. Miss. 600-——5
66 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

facts of nature, of inductive and deductive reasoning for the discovery
of their mutual relations and connection. The various branches of
physical science differ in the extent to which, at any given moment of
their history, observation on the one hand, or ratiocination on the
other, is their more obvious feature, but in no other way; and nothing
can be more incorrect than the assumption one sometimes meets with,
that physics has one method, chemistry another, and biology a third.

POSTULATES.

All physical science starts from certain postulates. One of them is
the objective existence of a material world. It is assumed that the
phenomena which are comprehended under this name have a “sub-
stratum” of extended, impenetrable, mobile substance, which exhibits
the quality known as inertia, and is termed matter.* Another postu-

late is the universality of the law of causation; that nothing happens
without a cause (that is, a necessary precedent condition), and that the
state of the physical universe, at any given moment, is the consequence
of its state at any preceding moment. Another is that any of the rules,
or so-called ‘‘laws of nature,” by which the relation of phenomena is
truly defined, is true for all time. The validity of these postulates is a
problem of metaphysics; they are neither self-evident nor are they,
strictly speaking, demonstrable. The justification of their employ-
ment, as axioms of physical philosophy, lies in the circumstance that
expectations logically based upon them are verified, or, at any rate,
not contradicted, whenever they can be tested by experience.

HYPOTHESES.

Physical science therefore rests on verified or uncontradicted hypoth-
eses; and such being the case, it is not surprising that a great con-
dition of its progress has been the jnvention of verifiable hypotheses.
It is a favorite popular delusion that the scientific inquirer is under a
sort of moral obligation to abstain from going beyond that generaliza-
tion of observed facts which is absurdly called ‘“ Baconian ” induction.
But any one whois practically acquainted with scientific work is aware

*Iam aware that this proposition may be challenged. It may be said, for exam-
ple, that, on the hypothesis of Boscovich, matter has no extension, being reduced to
mathematical points serving as centers of ‘‘forces.” But as the ‘‘forces” of the
various centers are conceived to limit one another’s action in such a manner that
an area around each center has an individuality of its own, extension comes back in
the form of that area. Again, a very eminent mathematician and physicist, the late
Clerk Maxwell, has declared that impenetrability is not essential to our notions of
matter, and that two atoms may conceivably occupy the same space. I am loth to
dispute any dictum of a philosopher as remarkable for the subtlety of his intellect as
for his vast knowledge; but the assertion that one and the same point or area of
space can have different (conceivably opposite) attributes appears to me to violate
the principle of contradiction, which is the foundation not only of physical science,
but of logic in general. It means that A can be not-A.
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 67

that those who refuse to go beyond fact rarely get as far as fact; and
any one who has studied the history of science knows that almost every
great step therein has been made by the “ anticipation of nature,” that
is, by the invention of hypotheses, which though verifiable, often had
very little foundation to start with; and not unfrequently, in spite of a
long career of usefulness, turned out to be wholly erroneous in the
long run.

HYPOTHESES FRUITFUL EVEN WHEN ERRONEOUS.

The geocentric system of astronomy, with its eccentrics and its epi-
cycles, was an hypothesis utterly at variance with fact, which never-
theless did great things for the advancement of astronomical knowledge.
Kepler was the wildest of guessers. Newton’s corpuscular theory of
light was of much temporary use in optics, though nobody now believes
in it; and the undulatory theory, which has superseded the corpus-
cular theory, and has proved one of the most fertile of instruments of
research, is based on the hypothesis of the existence of an “ wether,” the
properties of which are defined in propositions, some of which, to ordi-
nary apprehension, seem physical antinomies.

It sounds paradoxical to say that the attainment of scientific truth
has been effected, to a great extent, by the help of scientific errors.
But the subject-matter of physical science is furnished by observation,
which can not extend beyond the limits of our faculties; while, even
within those limits, we can not be certain that any observation 1s abso-
lutely exact and exhaustive. Hence it follows that any given generali-
zation from observation may be true, within the limits of our powers of
observation at a given time, and yet turn out to be untrue, when those
powers of observation are directly or indirectly enlarged. Or, to put
the matter in another way, a doctrine which is untrue absolutely, may
to a very great extent be susceptible of an interpretation in accordance
with the truth. Atacertain period in the history of astronomical science
the assumption that the planets move in circles was true enough to
serve the purpose of correlating such observations as were then possible ;
after Kepler, the assumption that they move in ellipses became true
enough in regard to the state of observational astronomy at that time.
We say still that the orbits of the planets are ellipses, because, for all
ordinary purposes, that is a sufficiently near approximation to the truth ;
but, as a matter of fact, the center of gravity of a planet describes
neither an ellipse nor any other simple curve, but an immensely compli-
cated undulating line. It may fairly be doubted whether any generali-
zation, or hypothesis, based upon physical data is absolutely true, in
the sense that a mathematical proposition is so; but, if its errors can
become apparent only outside the limits of practicable observation, it
may be just as usefully adopted for one of the symbols of that algebra
by which we interpret nature, as 1f 1t were absolutely true.

The development of every branch of physical knowledge presents
63 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

three stages which, in their logical relation, are successive. The first is
the determination of the sensible character and order of the phenomena.
This is Natural History, in the original sense of the term, and here
nothing but observation and experiment avail us. The second is the
determination of the constant relations of the phenomena thus defined,
and their expression in rules or laws. The third is the explication of
these particular laws by deduction from the most general laws of matter
and motion. The last two stages constitute Natural Philosophy in its
original sense. In this region, the invention of verifiable hypotheses
is not only permissible, but is one of the conditions of progress.

Historically, no branch of science has followed this order of growth;
but, from the dawn of exact knowledge to the present day, observation,
experiment, and speculation have gone hand in hand; and, whenever
science has halted or strayed from the right path, it has been, either
because its votaries have been content with mere unverified or unveri-
fiable speculation (and this is the commonest case, because observation
and experiment are hard work, while speculation is amusing); or it has
been because the accumulation of details of observation has for a time
excluded speculation.

The progress of physical science, since the revival of learning, is.
largely due to the fact that men have gradually learned to lay aside
the consideration of unverifiable hypotheses; to guide observation and
experiment by verifiable hypotheses; and to consider the latter, not as
ideal truths, the real entities of an intelligible world behind phenomena,
but as a symbolical language, by the aid of which nature can be in-
terpreted in terms apprehensible by our intellects. And if physical
science, during the last fifty years, has attained dimensions beyond all
former precedent, and can exhibit achievements of greater importance
than any former such period can show, it is because able men, animated
by the true scientific spirit, carefully trained in the method of science,
and having at their disposal immensely improved appliances, have de-
voted themselves to the enlargement of the boundaries of natural knowl-
edge in greater number than during any previous half century of the
world’s history.

THREE GREAT RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS.

I have said that our epoch can produce achievements in physical
Science of greater moment than any other has to show, advisedly ; and.
I think that there are three great products of our time which justify the
assertion. One of these is that doctrine concerning the constitution of
matter, which, for want of a better name, I will call “molecular;” the
second is the doctrine of conservation of energy; the third is the doc-
trine of evolution. Each of these was foreshadowed, more or less dis-
tinctly, in former periods of the history of science; and, so far is either
from being the outcome of purely inductive reasoning, that it would be
hard to over-rate the influence of metaphysical, and even of theological,

’
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 69

considerations upon the development of all three. The peculiar merit
of onr epoch is that it has shown how these hypotheses connect a vast
number of seemingly independent partial generalizations; that it has
given them that precision of expression which is necessary for their
exact verification; and that it has practically proved their value as
guides to the discovery of new truth. All three doctrines are intimately
connected, and each is applicable to the whole physical cosmos. But,
as might have been expected from the nature of the case, the first two
grew, main ly, out of the consideration of physico-chemical phenomena
while the third, in great measure, owes its rehabilitation, if not its origin,
to the study of biological phenomena.

1. S'RUCTURE OF MATTER.

In the early decades of this century, a number of important truths
applicable, in part, to matter in general, and, in part, to particular
forms of matter, had been ascertained by the physicists and chemists.

The laws of motion of visible and tangible—or molar matter had been
worked out to agreat degree of refinement and embodied in the branches
of science known as Mechanics, Hydrostatics, and Pneumatics. These
laws had been shown to hold good, so far as they could be checked by
observation and experiment, throughout the universe, on the assump-
tion that all such masses of matter possessed inertia and were suscep-
tible of acquiring motion in two ways, firstly by impact, or impulse
from without; and secondly, by the operation of certain hypothetical
causes of motion termed ‘ forces,” which were usually supposed to be
resident in the particles of the masses themselves, and to operate at a
distance, in such a way as to tend to draw any two such masses to-
gether, or to separate them more widely.

With respect to the ultimate constitution of these masses, the same
two antagonistic opinions which had existed since the time of Democ-
ritus and of Aristotle were still face to face. According to the one,
matter was discontinuous and consisted of minute indivisible particles
or atoms, separated by a universal vacuum; according to the other, it
was continuous, and the finest distinguishable, or imaginable, particles
were scattered through the attenuated general substance of the plenum.
A rough analogy to the latter case would be afforded by granules of
ice diffused through water; to the former, such granules diffused through
absolutely empty space.

In the latter part of the eighteenth century the chemists had ar-
rived at several very important generalizations respecting those prop-
erties of matter with which they were especially concerned. However
plainly ponderable matter seemed to be originated and destroyed in
their operations, they proved that as mass or body, it remained inde-
Structible, and ingenerable; and that so far, it varied only in its per-
ceptibility by our senses. The course of investigation further proved
that a certain number of the chemically separable kinds of matter were

~

unalterable by any known means (except in so far as they might be
made to change their state from solid to fluid, or vice versa), unless
they were brought into contact with other kinds of matter, and that
the properties of these several kinds of matter were always the same,
whatever their origin. All other bodies were found to consist of two
or more of these, which thus took the place of the four ‘“ elements” of
the ancient philosophers. Further, it was proved that in forming
chemical compounds, bodies always unite in a definite proportion by
weight, or in simple multiples of that proportion, and that, if any one
body were taken as a standard, every other could have a number as-
signed to it as its proportional combining weight. It was on this foun-
dation of fact that Dalton based his re-establishment of the old atomic
hypothesis on a new empirical foundation. Itis obvious that if ele-
mentary matter consists of indestructible and indivisible particles,
each of which constantly preserves the same weight relatively to all
the others, compounds formed by the aggregation of two, three, four, or
more such particles must exemplify the rule of combination in definite
proportions deduced from observation.

In the meanwhile, the gradual reception of the undulatory theory of
light necessitated the assumption of the existence of an “ ether” filling
all space. But whether this ether was to be regarded as a strictly ma-
terial and continuous substance was an undecided point, and hence the
revived atomism escaped strangling in its birth. For it is clear that
if the ether is admitted to be a continuous material substance, Demo-
critic atomism is at an end, and Cartesian continuity takes its place.

The real value of the new atomic hypothesis, however, did not liein the
two points which Democritus and his followers would have considered
essential, namely, the indivisibility of the ‘“‘atoms” and the presence
of an inter-atomic vacuum; but in the assumption that, to the extent to
which our means of analysis take us, material bodies consist of definite
minute masses, each of which, so far as physical and chemical processes
of division go, may be regarded as a unit—having a practically perman-
ent individuality. Just as a man is the unit of sociology, without refer-
ence to the actual fact of his divisibility. so such a minute mass is the
unit of physico-chemical science—that smallest material particle which
under any given circumstances acts as a whole.*

The doctrine of specific heat originated in the eighteenth century.
It means that the same mass of a body, under the same circumstances,
always requires the same quantity of heat to raise it to a given temper-
ature, but that equal masses of different bodies require different quan-
tities. Ultimately, it was found that the quantities of heat required to
raise equal masses of the more perfect gases through equal ranges of
temperature were inversely proportional to their combining weights.

*“ Molecule” would be the more appropriate name for such a particle. Unfortu-
nately chemists employ this term in a special sense as a name for an aggregation of
their smallest particles, for which they retain the designation of ‘‘atoms.”
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. (Ay

and heat. The phenomena of electrolytic decomposition showed that
there was a like close relation between these units and electricity. The
quantity of electricity generated by the combination of any two units
is sufficient to separate any other two which are susceptible of such
decomposition. The phenomena of isomorphism showed a relation
between the units and crystalline forms; certain units are thus able to
replace others in acrystalline body without altering its form, and others
are not.

Again, the laws of the effect of pressure and heat on gaseous bodies, the
fact that they combine in definite proportions by volume, and that such
proportion bears a simple relation to their combining weights, all har-
monized with the Daltonian hypothesis, and led to the bold speculation
known as the law of Avogadro—that all gaseous bodies, under the same
physical conditions, contain the same number of units. In the form in
which it was first enunciated this hypothesis was incorrect-—perhaps it
is not exactly true in any form; but it is hardly too much to say that
chemistry and molecular physics would never have advanced to their
present condition unless it had been assumed to be true. Another
immense service rendered by Dalton, as a corrollary of the new atomic
doctrine, was the creation of a system of symbolic notation, which not
only made the nature of chemical compounds and processes easily in-
telligible and easy of recollection, but, by its very form, suggested new
lines of inquiry, The atomic notation was as serviceable to chemistry
as the binomial nomenclature and the classificatory schematism of
Linneus were to zoology and botany.

Side by side with these advances arose another, which also has a close
parallel in the history of biological science. If the unit of a compound
is made up by the aggregation of elementary units, the notion that
these must have some sort of definite arrangement inevitably suggests
itself; and such phenomena as double decomposition pointed, not only
to the existence of a molecular architecture, but to the possibility of
modifying a molecular fabric without destroying it, by taking out some
of the component units and replacing them by others. The class of
neutral salts, for example, includes a great number of bodies in many
ways similar, in which the basic molecules, or the acid molecules, may
be replaced by other basic and other acid molecules without altering
the neutrality of the salt; just as a cube of bricks remains a cube so
long as any brick that is taken out is replaced by another of the same
shape and dimensions, whatever its weight or other properties may be.
Facts of this kind gave rise to the conception of “types” of molecular
structure, just as the recognition of the unity in diversity of the struct-
ure of the species of plants and animals gave rise to the notion of bio-.
logical “types.” The notation of chemistry enabled these ideas to be
represented with precision; and they acquired an immense importance
when the improvement of methods of analysis, which took place about
T2 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

Thus a definite relation was established between the hypothetical units
the beginning of our period, enabled the composition of the so-called
“organic” bodies to be determined with rapidity and precision.* A
large proportion of these compounds contain not more than three or
four elements, of which carbon is the chief; but their number is very
great, and the diversity of their physical and chemical properties is as-
tonishing. The ascertainment of the proportion of each element in
these compounds affords little or no help towards accounting for their
diversities; widely different bodies being often very similar, or even
identical, in that respect. And, in the last case, that of isomeric com-
pounds, the appeal to diversity of arrangement of the identical compo-
nent units was the only obvious way out of the difficulty. Here again
hypothesis proved to be of great value; not only was the search for
evidence of diversity of molecular structure successfal, but the study
of the process of taking to pieces led to the discovery of the way to put
together, and vast numbers of compounds, some of them previously
known only as products of the living economy, have thus been artifi-
cially constructed. Chemical. work at the present day is, to a large
extent, synthetic or creative; that is to say, the chemist determines,
theoretically, that certain non-existent compounds ought to be pro-
ducible, and he proceeds to produce them.

It is largely because the chemical theory and practice of our epoch
have passed into this deductive amd synthetic stage, that they are en-
titled to the name of the ‘*‘ New Chemistry,” which they commonly re-
ceive. But this new chemistry has grown up by the help of hypotheses,
such as these of Dalton, and of Avogadro, and that singular conception
of “ bonds” invented to colligate the facts of ‘ valency ” or “ atomicity,”
the first of which took some time to make its way; while the second
fellinto oblivion for many years after if was propounded for lack of em-
pirical justification. As for the third, it may be doubted if any one
regards it as more than a temporary contrivance.

But some of these hypotheses have done yet further service. Com.
bining them with the mechanical theory of heat and the doctrine of the
conservation of energy, wbich are also products of our time, physicists
have arrived at an entirely new conception of the nature of gaseous
bodies and of the relation of the physico-chemical units of matter to
the different forms of energy. The conduct of gases under varying
pressure and temperature, their diffusibility, their relation to radiant
heat and to light, the evolution of heat when bodies combine, the ab-
sorption of heat when they are dissociated, and a host of other molecu-
lar phenomena, have been shown to be deducible from the dynamical
and statical principles which apply to molar motion and rest; and the
tendeney of the physico-chemical science is clearly towards the reduc-
tion of the problems of the world of the infinitely little, as it already

plished before Liebig’s time in a whole year.”—Hofmann, Faraday Lecture, p. 46.
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 73

has reduced those of the infinitely great world, to questions of me-
chanics.*

In the meanwhile, the primitive atomic theory, which has served as
the scaffolding for the edifice of modern physics and chemistry, has
been quietly dismissed. I can not discover that any contemporaryy,
physicist or chemist believes in the real indivisibility of atoms, or in ‘
an inter-atomic matterless vacuum. ‘ Atoms” appear to be used as
mere names for physico-chemical units which have not yet been sub-
divided, and “molecules” for physico-chemical units which are aggre-
gates of the former. And these individualized particles are supposed
to move in an endless ocean of a vastly more subtle matter—the ether.
If this ether is a continuous substance, therefore, we have got back
from the hypothesis of Dalton to that of Descartes. But there is much
reason to believe that science is going to make a still further journey,
and in form, if not altogether in substance, to return to the point of
view of Aristotle.

The greater number of the so-called “‘elementary” bodies, now known,
had been discovered before the commencement of our epoch; and it had
become apparent that they were by no means equally similar or dis-
similar, but that some of them, at any rate, constituted groups, the sev-
eral members of which were as much like one another as they were
unlike the rest. Chlorine, iodine, bromine, and fluorine thus formed a
very distinct group; sulphur and selenium another; boron and silicon
another; potassium, sodium, and lithium another, and so on. In some
cases the atomic weights of such allied bodies were nearly the same, or
could be arranged in series, with like differences between the several
terms. In fact, the elements afforded indications that they were sus-
ceptible of a classification in natural groups, such as those into which
animals and plants fall.

PERIODIC SERIES OF ELEMENTS.

Recently this subject has been taken up afresh, with a result which
may be stated roughly in the following terms: If the sixty-five or sixty-
eight recognized “elements” are arranged in the order of their atomic
weights—from hydrogen, the lightest, as unity, to uranium, the heavi-
est, as 240—the series does not exhibit one continuous progressive
modification in the physical and chemical characters of its several
terms, but breaks up into a number of sections, in each of which the
several terms present analogies with the corresponding terms of the
other series.

Thus the whole series does not run

So that it 1s said to express a periodic law of recurrent similarities. Or

the relation may be expressed in another way. In each section or the
series, the atomic weight is greater than in the preceding section, so
that if wis the atomic weight of any element in the first segment,
w+ «will represent the atomic weight of any element in the next,
and w+ 2+ y the atomic weight of any element in the next, and so on.
Therefore the sections may be represented as parallel series, the cor-
responding terms of which have analogous properties; each successive
series starting with a body the atomic weight of which is greater than
that of any in the preceding series, in the following fashion:

This is a conception with which biologists are very familiar, animal
and plant groups constantly appearing as series of parallel modifica-
tions of similar and yet different primary forms. In the living world,
facts of this kind are now understood to mean evolution from a com-
mon prototype. It is difficult to imagine that in the not-living world
they are devoid of significance. Is it not possible, nay probable, that
they may mean the evolution of our “elements” from a primary un-
differentiated form of matter? Fifty years ago such a suggestion
would have been scouted as a revival of the dreams of the alchemists.
At present it may be said to be the burning question of physico-chemi-
cal science.

In fact, the so-called “ vortex-ring ” hypothesis is a very serious and
remarkable attempt to deal with material units from a point of view
which is consistent with the doctrine of evolution. It supposes the
ether to be a uniform substance, and that the ‘elementary ” units are,
broadly speaking, permanent whirlpools, or vortices, of this ether, the
properties of which depend on their actual and potential modes of
motion. It is curious and highly interesting to remark that this hy-
pothesis reminds us not only of the speculations of Descartes, but of those
of Aristotle. The resemblance of the “vortex-rings” to the ‘tour.
billons” of Descartes is little more than nominal; but the correspond-
ence between the modern and the ancient notion of a distinction be-
tween primary and derivative matter is, to a certain extent, real. For
this ztherial ‘‘Urstoft” of the modern, corresponds very closely with
the zpwry bay of Aristotle, the materia prima of his medieval follow-
ers; while matter, differentiated into our elements, is the equivalent
of the first stage of progress towards the éoydéry &dy, or finished mat-
ter, of the ancient philosophy.

If the material units of the existing order of nature are specialized
portions of a relatively homogeneous materia prima—which were orig-
inated under conditions that have long ceased to exist and which remain
unchanged and unchangeable under all conditions, whether natural or
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. (5

artificial, hithertc known to us—it follows that the Speculation that
they may be indefinitely altered, or that new units may be generated
under conditions yet to be discovered, is perfect] y legitimate. Theoret-
ically, at any rate, the transmutability of the elements is a verifiable
scientific hypothesis; and such inquiries as those which have been set
afoot, into the possible dissociative action of the great heat of the
sun upon our elements, are not only legitimate, but are likely to yield
results which, whether affirmative or negative, will be of great impor-
tance. The idea that atoms are absolutely ingenerable and immutable
‘manufactured articles” stands on the same sort of foundation as the
idea that biological species are “manufactured articles” stood thirty
years ago; and the supposed constancy of the elementary atoms, dur-
ing the enormous lapse of time measured by the existence of our uni-
verse, is of no more weight against the possibility of change in them,
in the infinity of antecedent time, than the constancy of species in
Egypt, since the days of Rameses or Cheops, is evidence of their im-
mutability during all past epochs of the earth’s history. It seems safe
to prophesy that the hypothesis of the evolution of the elements from
a primitive matter will, in future, play no less a part in the history of
Science than the atomic hypothesis, which, to begin with, had no greater
if so great an empirical foundation.

It may perhaps occur to the reader that the boasted progress of phys-
ical science does not come to much, if our present conceptions of the
fundamental nature of matter are expressible in terms employed, more
than two thousand years ago, by the old “ master of those that know.”
Such a criticism, however, would involve forgetfulness of the fact that
the connotation of these terms, in the mind of the modern, is almost
infinitely different from that which they possessed in the mind of the
ancient philosopher. In antiquity, they meant little more than vague
Speculation; at the present day they indicate definite physical concep-
tions, susceptible of mathematical treatment, and giving rise to innu-
merable deductions, the value of which can be experimentally tested.
The old notions produced little more than floods of dialectics; the new
are powerful aids towards the increase of solid knowledge.

2. CONSERVATION OF ENERGY.

Every-day observation shows that of the bodies which compose the
material world, some are in motion and some are, or appear to be, at
rest. Of the bodies in motion, some, like the sun and stars, exhibit a
constant movement, regular in amount and direction, for which no ex-
ternal cause appears. Others, as stones and smoke, seem also to move
of themselves when external impediments are taken away; but these
appear to tend to move in opposite di rections, the bodies we call heavy,
such as stones, downwards, and the bodies we call light, at least such
as smoke and steam, upwards; and as we further notice that the earth
below our feet is made up of heavy matter, while the air above our
76 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

heads is extremely light matter, it is easy to regard this fact as evi-
dence that the lower region is the place to which heavy things tend—
their proper place, in short—while the upper region is the proper place
of light things; and to generalize the facts observed by saying that
bodies which are free to move tend towards their proper places. All
these seem to be natural motions, dependent on the inherent faculties
or tendencies of bodies themselves; but there are other motions which
are artificial or violent, as when a stone is thrown from the hand or is
knocked by another stone in motion. In such cases as these, for ex-
ample, when a stone is cast from the hand the distance travelled by the
stone appears to depend partly on its weight and partly upon the exer-
tion of the thrower. So that the weight of the stone remaining the
same, it looks as if the motive power communicated to it were measured
by the distance to which the stone travels;—as if (in other words) the
power needed to send it a hundred yards was twice as great as that
-needed to send it fifty yards. These, apparently obvious, conclusions
from the every-day appearances of rest and motion fairly represent the
state of opinion upon the subject which prevailed among the ancient
Greeks and remained dominant until the age of Galileo. The publica-
tion of the “ Principia” of Newton in 1686~87 marks the epoch at which
the progress of mechanical physics had effected a complete revolution
of thought on these subjects. By this time it had been made clear that
the old generalizations were either incomplete or totally erroneous; that
a body, once set in motion, will continue to move in a straight line for
any conceivable time or distance, unless it is interfered with; that any
change of motion is proportional to the ‘‘ force” which causes it and
takes place in the direction in which that ‘“‘ force” is exerted, and that
when a body in motion acts as a cause of motion on another the latter
gains aS much as the former loses, and vice versa. It is to be noted,
however, that while, in contradistinction to the ancient idea of the in-
herent tendency to motion of bodies, the absence of any such spon-
taneous power of motion was accepted as a physical axiom by the mod-
erns, the old conception virtually maintained itself in a new shape.
For, in spite of Newton’s well-known warning against the “ absurdity ”
of supposing that one body can act on another at a distance through a
vacuum, the ultimate particles of matter were generally assumed to be
the seats of perennial causes of motion termed “attractive and repulsive
forces,” in virtue of which any two such particles, without any external
impression of motion or intermediate material agent, were supposed to
tend to approach or remove from one another; and this view of the
duality of the causes of motion is very widely held at the present day.

Another important result of investigation, attained in the seventeenth
century, was the proof and quantitative estimation of physical inertia.
In the old philosophy, a curious conjunction of ethical and physical
prejudices had led to the notion that there was something ethically bad
and physically obstructive about matter. Aristotle attributes all irregu-
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. fir

larities and apparent dysteleologies in nature to the disobedience, or
sluggish yielding, of matter to the shaping and guiding influence of
those reasons and causes which were hypostatized in his ideal ‘‘ Forms.”
In modern science, the conception of the inertia, or resistance to change,
_of matter is complex. In part, it contains a corollary from the law of
causation: A body can not change its state in respect of rest or motion
without a sufficient cause. But, in part, it contains generalizations from
experience. One of these is that there is no such cause resident in any
body, and that therefore it will rest or continue in motion so long as no
external cause of change acts upon it. The other is that the effect which
the impact of a body in motion produces upon the body on which it im-
pinges depends, other things being alike, on the relation of a certain
quality of each which is called “mass.” Given a cause of motion of a
certain value, the amount of motion, measured by distance travelled in
a certain time, which it will produce in a given quantity of matter, say
a cubic inch, is not always the same, but depends on what that matter
is;—a cubic inch of iron will go faster than a cubicineh of gold. Hence,
it appears, that since equal amounts of motion have, ex hypothesi, been
produced, the amount of motion ina body does not depend on its speed
alone, but on some property of the body. To this the name of * mass”
has been given. And since it seems reasonable to suppose that a large
quantity of matter, moving slowly, possesses as much motion as a small
quantity moving faster, ‘‘ mass” has been held to express ‘*‘ quantity of
matter.” it is further demonstrable that, at any given time and place,
the relative mass of any two bodies is expressed by the ratio of their
weights. |
When all these great truths respecting molar motion, vr the move-
ments of visible and tangible masses, had been shown to hotd good not
ouly of terrestrial bodies, but of all those which coustitute the visible
universe, and the movements of the macrocosm had thus been expressed
by a general mechanical theory, there remained a vast number of phe-
nomena, such as those of light, heat, electricity, magnetism, and those
of the physical and chemical changes, which do not involve molar mo-
tion. Newton’s corpuscular theory of light was an attempt to deal with
one great series of these phenomena on mechanical principles, and it
maintained its ground until, at the beginning of the nineteenth century,
the undulatory theory proved itself to be a much better working hy-
pothesis. Heat, up to that time, and indeed much later, was regarded
as an imponderable substance, caloric; as a thing which was absorbed
by bodies when they were warmed, and was given out as they cooled;
and which, moreover, was capable of entering into a sort of chemical com-
bination with them, and so becoming latent. Rumford and Davy had
given a great blow to this view of heat by proving that the quantity of
heat which two portions of the same body could be made to give out, by
rubbing them together, was practically illimitable. This result brought
philosophers face to face with the contradiction of supposing that a
-

78 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

finite body could contain an infinite quantity of another body; but it
was not until 1843, that clear and unquestionable experimental proof was
given of the fact that there is a definite relation between mechanical
work and heat; that so much work always gives rise, under the same
conditions, to so much heat, and so much heat to so much mechanical
work. Thus originated the mechanical theory of heat, which became
the starting point of the modern doctrine of the conservation of energy.
Molar motion had appeared to be destroyed by friction. It was proved
that no destruction took place, but that an exact equivalent of the
energy of the lost molar motion appears as that of the molecular motion,
or motion of the smallest particles of a body, which constitutes heat.
The loss of the masses is the gain of their particles.

Before 1843, however, the doctrine of the conservation of energy had
been approached. Bacon’s chief contribution to positive science is the
happy guess (for the context shows that it was little more) that heat
may be a modeof motion; Descartes affirmed the quantity of motion in
the world to be constant; Newton nearly gave expression to the com-
plete theorem, while Rumford’s and Davy’s experiments suggested,
though they did not prove, the equivalency of mechapical and thermal
energy. Again, the discovery of voltaic electricity, and the marvellous
development of knowledge in that field, effected by such men as Davy,
Faraday, Oersted, Ampére, and Melloni, had brought to light a num-
ber of facts which tended to show that the so-called “ forces” at work
in light, heat, electricity, and magnetism, in chemical and in mechani-
cal operations, were intimately, and in various cases, quantitatively
related. It was demonstrated that any one could be obtained at the
expense of any other; and apparatus was devised which exhibited the
evolution of all these kinds of action from one source of energy. Hence
the idea of the “correlation of forces” which was the immediate fore-
runner of the doctrine of the conservation of energy.

It is a remarkable evidence of the greatness of the progress in this
direction which has been effected in our time, that even the second edi-
tion of the “ History of the Inductive Sciences,” which was published in
1846, contains no allusion either to the general view of the “ Correlation
of Forces” published in England in 1842, or to the publication in 1843
of the first of the series of experiments by which themechanical equiva-
lent of heat was correctly ascertained.* Such a failure on the part ofa

*This is the more curious, as Ampére’s hypothesis that vibrations of molecules,
causing and caused by vibrations of the zther constitute heat, is dis¢ussed. See vol.
li, p. 587, 2d ed. In the Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, 2d ed., 1847, p. 239,
Whewell remarks a propos of Bacon’s definition of heat, ‘‘that it is an expansive, re-
strained motion, modified in certain ways, and exerted in the smaller particles of
the body; ” that “ although the exact nature of heat is still an obscure and contro-
verted matter, the science of heat now consists of many important truths; and that
to none of these truths is there any approximation in Bacon’s essay.” In point of
fact, Bacon’s statement, however much open to criticism, does contain a distinct ap-
proximation to the most important of all the truths respecting heat which had been
discovered when Whewell wrote.

contemporary, of great acquirements and remarkable inteliectual pow-
ers, to read the signs of the times, is a lesson and a warning worthy of
being deeply pondered by any one who attempts to prognosticate the
course of scientific progress.

I have pointed out that the growth of clear and definite views re-
specting the constitution of matter has led to the conclusion that so far
as natural agencies are concerned, it is ingenerable and indestructible.
In so far as matter may be conceived to exist in a purely passive state,
it is, imaginably, older than motion. But as it must be assumed to be
susceptible of motion, a particle of bare matter at rest must be endowed
with the potentiality of motion. Such a particle however, by the sup-
position can have no energy, for there is no cause why it should move.
Suppose now that it receives an impulse, it will begin to move with a
velocity inversely proportional toits mass on the one hand, and directly
proportional to the strength of the impulse on the other, and will pos-
sess kinetic energy, in virtue of which it will not only continue to move
forever if unimpeded, but if it impinges on another such particle it will
impart more or less of its motion to the latter. Let it be conceived that
the particle acquires a tendency to move, and that nevertheless it does
not move. It is thenina condition totally different from that in which
it was at first. A cause competent to produce moticn is operating upon
it, but, for some reason or other, is unable to give rise to motion. If the
obstacle is removed, the energy which was there but could not manifest
itself, at once gives rise to motion. While the restraint lasts, the en-
ergy of the particle is merely potential; and the case supposed illus-
trates what is meant by potential energy. Inthis contrast of the po-
tential with the actual, modern physics is turning to account the most
familiar of Aristotelian distinctions—that between ddvaprs and évgpyera.

That kinetic energy appears to be imparted by impact is a fact ot
daily and hourly experience: we see bodies set in motion by bodies,
already in motion, which seem to come into contact with them. It is
a truth which could have been learned by nothing but experience, and
which can not be explained, but must be taken as an ultimate fact
about which, explicable or inexplicable, there can be no doubt. Strictly
speaking, we have no direct apprehension of any other cause of mo-
tion. But experience furnishes innumerable examples of the produc-
tion of kinetic energy in a body previously at rest, when no impact
is discernible as the cause of that energy. In all such cases, the
presence of a second body is a necessary condition ; and the amount of
kinetic energy, whichits presence enables the first to gain, is strictly de-
pendent on the relative positions of thetwo. Hence the phrase energy of
position, which is frequently used as equivalent to potential energy. Ifa
stone is picked up and held, say, 6 feet above the ground, it has potential
energy, because, if let go, it will immediately begin to move towards the
earth ; and this energy may be said to be energy of position, because it

stone is solicited to move, but can not so long as the muscular strength
of the holder prevents the solicitation from taking effect. The stone,
therefore, has potential energy, which becomes kinetic if it is let go,
and the amount of that kinetic energy which will be developed before
it strikes the earth depends upon its position,—on the fact that it is, say,
6 feet off the earth, neither more nor less. Moreover, it can be proved
that the faiser of the stone had to exert as much energy in order to
place it in its position as it will develop in falling. Hence the en-
ergy which was exerted, and apparently exhausted, in raising the stone
is potentially in the stone in its raised position, and will manifest it-
self when the stone is set free. Thus the energy, withdrawn from the
general stock to raise the stone, is returned when it falls, and there is
no change in the total amount. Energy, as a whole, is conserved.

Taking this as a very broad and general statement of the essential
facts of the case, the raisicg of the stone is intelligible enough, as a
ease of the communication of motion from one body to another. But
the potential energy of the raised stone is not so easily intelligible.
To all appearance, there is nothing either pushing or pulling it toward
the earth, or the earth toward it; and yet it is quite certain that the
stone tends to move toward the earth, and the earth toward the stone,
in the way defined by the law of gravitation.

In the currently accented language of science, the cause of motion,
in ail such cases as this, when bodies tend to move toward or away from
one or another, without any discernible impact of other bodies, is termed
a ‘“¢ force,” which is called “ attractive” in the one case, and “ repul-
sive” in the other. And such attractive or repulsive forces are often
spoken of as if they were real things, capable of exerting a pull, ora
push, upon the particles of matter concerned. Thus the potential
energy of the stone is commonly said to be due to the force” of gravity
which is continually operating upon it.

Another illustration may make the case plainer. The bob of a pend-
ulum swings first to one side and then to the other of the center of the
are which it describes. Suppose it to have just reached the summit of
its right-hand half-swing. It is said that the “attractive forces” of the
bob for the earth, and of the earth for the bob, set the former in motion ;
and as these ‘“ forces” are continually in operation, they confer an ac-
celerated velocity on the bob; until, when it reaches the center of its
Swing, it is, so to speak, fully charged with kinetic energy. If, at this
moment, the whole material universe, except the bob, were abolished,
it would move forever in the direction of a tangent to the middle of the
are described. Asa matter of fact, it is compelled te travel through
its left-hand half-swing, and thus virtually to go up hill. Consequently
the “ attractive forces” of the bob and the earth are now acting against
it, and constitute a resistance which the charge of kinetic energy has to
overcome. But as this charge represents the operation of the attractive
torces, during the passage of the bob through the right-hand half-swing
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 81

down to the center of the are, so it must needs be used up by the pas-
sage of the bob upward from the center of the are to the summit of the
left-hand half-swing. Hence, at this point, the bob comes to a momen-
tary rest. The last fraction of kinetic energy is just neutralized by the
action of the attractive forces, and the bob has only potential energy
equal to that with which it started. So that the sum of the phenomena
may be stated thus: At the summit of either half-are of its swing, the
bob bas a certain amount of potential energy; and as it descends it
gradually exchanges this for kinetic energy, until at the center it pos-
sesses an equivalent amount of kinetic energy; from this point on-
wards, it gradually loses kinetic energy as it ascends, until, at the
summit of the other half-are, it has required an exactly similar amount
of potential energy. Thus, on the whole transaction, nothing is either
lost or gained; the quantity of energy is always the same, but it passes
from one form into the other.

To all appearance, the phenomena exhibited by the pendulum are
not to be accounted for by impact; in fact, it is usually assumed that cor-
responding phenomena would take place if the earth and the pendulum
were situated in an absolute vacuum, and at any conceivable distance
from one another. If this be so, it follows that there must be two
totally different kinds of causes of motion; the one impact—a vera causa,
of which, to all appearance, we have constant experience; the other,
attractive or repulsive ‘‘foree”—a metaphysical entity which is phys-
ically inconceivable. Newton expressly repudiated the notion of the
existence of attractive forces, in the sense in which that term is ordi-
narily understood ; and he refused to put forward any hypothesis as to
the physical cause of the so-called “attraction of gravitation.” As a
general rule, his successors have been content to accept the doctrine of
attractive and repulsive forces, without troubling themselves about the
philosophical difficulties which it involves. But this has not always
been the case; and the attempt of Le Sage, in the last century, to show
that the phenomena of attraction and repulsion are susceptible of ex-
planation by his hypothesis of bombardment by ultra-mundane par-
ticles, whether tenable or not, has the great merit of being an attempt
to get rid of the dual conception of the causes of motion which has
hitherto prevailed. On this hypothesis, the hammering of the ultra-
mundane corpuscles on the bob coufers its kinetic energy on the one
hand, and takes it away onthe other; and the state of potential energ)
means the condition of the bob during the instant at which the energy
conferred by the hammering during the one half-are has just been ex-
hausted by the hammering during the other half-arc. It seems safe
to look forward to the time when the conception of attractive and re-
pulsive forces, having served its purpose as a useful piece of scientific
scaffolding, will be replaced by the deduction of the phenomena known
as attraction and repulsion, from the general laws of motion, .

82 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

The doctrine of the conservation of energy, which I have endeavored
to illustrate, is thus defined by the late Clerk Maxwell:

“The total energy of any body or system of bodies is a quantity
which can neither be increased nor diminished by any mutual action of,
such bodies, though it may be transformed into any one of the forms of
which energy is susceptible.” It follows that energy, like matter, is in-
destructible and ingenerable in nature. The phenomenal world, so far
as it is material, expresses the evolution and involution of energy, its
passage from the kinetic to the potential condition and back again.
Wherever motion of matter takes place, that motion is effected at the
expense of part of the total store of energy.

Hence, asthe phenomena exhibited by living beings, in so far as they
are material, are all molar or molecular motions, these are included un-
der the general law. A living body is a machine by which energy is
transformed in the same sense as a Steam-engine is So, and all its move-
ments, molar and molecular, are to be accounted for by the energy which
is supplied to it. The phenomena of consciousness which arise, along
with certain transformations of energy, can not be interpolated in the
series of these transformations, inasmuch as they are not motions to
which the doctrine of the conservation of energy applies. And for the
same reason, they do not necessitate the using up of energy; a sensa-
tion has no mass and can not be conceived to be susceptible of move-
ment. That a particular molecular motion does give rise to a state of
consciousness is experimentally certain; but the how and why of the
process are just as inexplicable as in the case of the communication of
kinetic energy by impact.

When dealing with the doctrine of the ultimate constitution of mat-
ter, we found a certain resemblance between the oldest speculations and
the newest doctrines of physical philosophers. But there is no such
resemblance between the ancient and modern views of motion and its
causes, except in so far as the conception of attractive and repulsive
forces may be regarded as the modified descendant of the Aristotelian
conception of forms. In fact, it is hardly too much to say that the es-
sential and fundamental difference between ancient and modern phys-
ical science lies in the ascertainment of the true laws of statics and
dynamics in the course of the last three centuries; and in the invention
of mathematical methods of dealing with all the consequences of these
laws. The ultimate aim of modern physical science is the deduction of
the phenomena exhibited by material bodies from physico-mathematical
first principles. Whether the human intellect is strong enough to at-
tain the goal set before it may be a question, but thither will it surely
strive.

3. EVOLUTION.

The third great scientific event of our time, the rehabilitation of the
doctrine of evolution, is part of the same teudency of increasing kuowl-
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. $3

edge to unify itself, which has led to the doctrine of the conservation of
energy. And this tendency, again, is mainly a product of the increas-
ing strength conferred by physical investigation on the belief in the
universal validity of that orderly relation of facts, which we express by
the so-called ‘‘ Laws of Nature.”

The growth of a plant from its seed, of an animal from its egg, the
apparent origin of innumerable living things from mud, or from the
putrefying remains of former organisms, had furnished the earlier sci-
entific thinkers with abundant analogies suggestive of the conception of
a corresponding method of cosmic evolution from a formless “chaos”
to an ordered world which might either continue forever or undergo
dissolution into its elements before starting on a new course of evolu-
tion. Itis therefore no wonder that, from the days of the Ionian school
onwards, the view that the universe was the result of such a process
should have maintained itself as a leading dogma of philosophy. The
emanistic theories which played so great a part in Neoplatonic philos-
ophy and Gnostic theology are forms of evolution. In the seventeenth
century, Descartes propounded a scheme of evolution, as an hypothesis
of what might have been the mode of origin of the world, while pro-
fessing to accept the ecclesiastical scheme of creation, as an account of
that which actually was its manner of coming into existence. In the
eighteenth century Kant put forth a remarkable speculation as to the
origin of the solar system, closely similar to that subsequently adopted
by Laplace and destined to become famous under the title of the “neb-
ular hypothesis.”

The careful observations and the acute reasonings of the Italian
geologists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the specula-
tions of Leibnitz in the *“* Protogeea” and of Buffon in his *‘ Théorie de
la Terre,” the sober and profound reasonings of Hutton, in the latter
part of the eighteenth century,—all these tended to show that the
fabric of the earth itself implied the continuance of processes of natural
causation for a period of time as great, in relation to human history, as
the distances of the heavenly bodies from us are, in relation to terres-
trial standards of measurement. The abyss of time began to loom as
large as the abyss of space. And this revelation to sight and touch,
of a link here and a link there of a practically infinite chain of natural
causes and effects, prepared the way, as perhaps nothing else has done,
for the modern form of the ancient theory of evolution.

In the beginning of the eighteenth ceutury, De Maillet made the first
serious attempt to apply the doctrine to the living world. In the latter
part of it, Erasmus Darwin, Goethe, Treviranus, and Lamarck, took up
the work more vigorously and with better qualifications. The question
of special creation, or evolution, lay at the bottom of the fierce dis-

- putes which broke out in the French Academy between Cuvier and St.-
Hilaire; and, for a time, the supporters of biological evolution were

84 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

the age with their ecclesiastical opponents. Catastrophism, a short-
sighted teleology, and a still more short-sighted orthodoxy, joimed
forces to crush evolution.

Lyell and Poulett Scrope, in this country, resumed the work of the
Italians aod of Hutton; and the former, aided by a marvellous power
of clear exposition, placed upon an irrefragable basis the truth that
natural causes are competent to account for all events, which can be
proved to have occurred, in the course of the secular changes which
have taken place during the deposition of the stratified rocks. The
publication of “The Principles of Geology,” in 1830, constituted an
epoch in geological science. But it also constituted an epoch in the
modern history of the doctrines of evolution, by raisingin the mind of
every intelligent reader this question: If natural causation is compe-
tent to account for the not-living part of our globe, why should it not
account for the living part?

By keeping this question before- the public for some thirty years,
Lyell, though the keenest and most formidable of the opponents of the
transmutation theory, as it was formulated by Lamarck, was of the
greatest possible service in facilitating the reception of the sounder
doctrines of a later day. And in like fashion, another vehement op-
ponent of the transmutation of species, the elder Agassiz, was doomed
to help the cause he hated. Agassiz not only maintained the fact of
the progressive advance in organization of the inhabitants of the earth
at each successive geological epoch, but he insisted upon the analogy
of the steps of this progression with those by which the embryo ad-
vances to the adult condition, among the highest forms of each group.
In fact, in endeavoring to support these views he went a good way be-
yond the limits of any cautious interpretation of the facts then known.

Although little acquainted with biological science, Whewell seems
to have taken particular pains with that part of his work which deals
with the history of geological and biological speculation ; and several
chapters of his seventeenth and eighteenth books, which comprise the
history of physiology, of comparative anatomy and of the paletiological
sciences, vividly reproduce the controversies of the early days of the
Victorian epoch. But here, as in the case of the doctrine of the con-
servation of energy, the historian of the inductive sciences bas no pro-
phetic insight; not even a suspicion of that which the near future was
to bring forth. And those who still repeat the once favorite objection
that Darwin’s “ Origin of Species” is nothing but a new version of the
** Philosophie zoologique” will find that, so late as 1844, Whewell had
not the slightest suspicion of Darwin’s main theorem, even as a logical
possibility. In faet, the publication of that theorem by Darwin and
Wallace, in 1859, took all the biological world by surprise. Neither
those who were inclined towards the “ progressive transmutation” or
“development” doctrine, as it was then called, nor those who were
opposed to it, had the slightest suspicion that the tendency to variation

in living beings, which all admitted as a matter of fact, the selective
influence of conditions, which no one could deny to be a matter of fact
when his attention was drawn to the evidence, and the occurrence
of great geological changes which also was matter of fact, could be
used as the only necessary postulates of a theory of the evolution of
plants and animals which, even if not, at once, competent to explain all
the known facts of biological science, could not be shown to be incon-
sistent with any. So far as biology is concerned, the publication of the
‘Origin of Species,” for the first time, put the doctrine of evolution, in
its application to living things, upon a sound scientific foundation. It
became an instrument of investigation, and in no hands did it prove
more brilliantly profitable than in those of Darwin himself. His pub-
lications on the effects of domestication in plants and animals,.on the
influence of cross-fertilization, on flowers as organs for effecting such
fertilization, on insectivorous plants, on the motions of plants, pointed
out the routes of exploration which have since been followed by hosts
of inquirers, to the great profit of science.

Darwin found the biological world a more than sufficient field for
even his great powers, and left the cosmical part of the doctrine to
others. Not much has been added to the nebular hypothesis since the
time of Laplace, except that the attempt to show (against that hypoth-
esis) that all nebule are star clusters, has been met by the spectro-
scopic proof of the gaseous condition of some of them. Moreover, phy-
sicists of the present generation appear now to accept the secular cool-
ing of the earth, which is one of the corollaries of that hypothesis. * In
fact, attempts have been made, by the help of deductions from the data
of physics, to lay down an approximate limit to the number of millions
of years which have elapsed since the earth was habitable by living
beings. If the conclusions thus reached should stand the test of further
investigation, they will undoubtedly be very valuable. But, whether
true or false, they can have no influence upon the doctrine of evolu-
tion in its application to living organisms. The occurrence of succes-
sive furms of life upon our globe is an historical fact which can not be
disputed, and the relation of these successive forms, as stages of evoln-
tion of the same type, is established in various cases. The biologist
has no means of determining the time over which the process of evolu-
tion has extended, but accepts the computation of the physical geologist
and the physicist, whatever that may be.

Evolution as a philosophical doctrine applicable to all phenomena,
whether physical or mental, whether manifested by material atoms or
by men in society, has been dealt with systematically in the ‘‘Synthetic .
Philosophy” of Mr. Herbert Spencer. Comment on that great under-
taking would not be in place here. I mention it because, -so far as I
know, it is the first attempt to deal on scientifie principles with modern
Scientific facts and speculations. For the ‘ Philosophie positive” of M.
Comte, with which Mr. Spencer’s system of philosophy is sometimes
86 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

compared, though it professes a similar object, is unfortunately per-
meated by a thoroughly unscientific spirit, and its author had no ade-
quate acquaintance with the physical sciences even of his own time.

The doctrine of evolution, so far as the present physical cosmos is
concerned, postulates the fixity of the rules of operation of the causes
of motion in the material universe. If all kinds of matter are modifica-
tions of one kind, and if all modes of motion are derived from the same
energy, the orderly evolution of physical nature out of one substratum
and one energy implies that the rules of action of that energy should
be fixed and definite. In the past history of the universe back to that
point, there can be no room for chance or disorder. But it is possible
to raise the question whether this universe of simplest matter and defi-
nitely operating energy, which forms our hypothetical starting point,
may not itself be a product of evolution from a universe of such matter,
in which the manifestations of energy were not definite,—in which, for
example, our laws of motion held good for’some units and not for
others, or for the same units at one time and not at another,—and which
would therefore be a real epicurean chance-world ?

For myself, J must confess that I find the air of this region of speeu-
lation too rarefied for my constitution, and I am disposed to take refuge
in ‘“‘ignoramus et ignorabimus.”

OTHER SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS.

The execution of my further task, the indication of the most im-
portant achievements in the several branches of physical science during
the last fifty years, is embarrassed by the abundance of the objects of
choice; and by the difficulty which every one, but a specialist in each
department, must find in drawing a due distinction between the dis-
coveries which strike the imagination by their novelty, or by their
practical influence, and those unobtrusive but pregnant observations
and experiments in which the germs of the great things of the future
really lie. Moreover, my limits restrict me to little more than a bare
chronicle of the events which I have to notice.

In physies and chemistry, the old boundaries of which sciences are
rapidly becoming effaced, one can hardly go wrong in ascribing a pri-
mary value to the investigations into the relation between the solid,
liquid, and gaseous states of matter on the one hand, and degrees of
pressure and of heat on the other. Almost all, even the most refrac-
tory, solids have been vaporized by the intense heat of the electric arc ;
and the most refractory gases have been forced to assume the liquid,
and even the solid, forms by the combination of high pressure with
intense cold. It has further been shown that there is no discontinuity
between these states—that a gas passes into the liquid state through a
condition which is neither one nor the other, and that a liquid body
becomes solid, or a solid liquid, by the intermediation of a condition in
which it is neither truly solid nor truly liquid.
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 87
KINETIC THEORY OF GASES.

Theoretical and experimental investigations have concurred in the
establishment of the view that a gas is a body, the particles of which
are in incessant rectilinear motion at high velocities, colliding with one
another and bounding back when they strike the walls of the containing
vessel; and, on this theory, the already ascertained relations of gaseous
bodies to heat and pressure have been shown to be deducible from
mechanical principles. Immense improvements have been effected in
the means of exhausting a given space of its gaseous contents; and
experimentation on the phenomena which attend the electric discharge
and the action of radiant heat, within the extremely rarefied media
thus produced, has yielded a great number of remarkable results, some

‘of which have been made familiar to the public by the Gieseler tubes

and the radiometer. Already these investigations have afforded an —
unexpected insight into the constitution of matter and its relations
with thermal and electri¢ energy, and they open up a vast. field for
future inquiry into some of the deepest problems of physics. Other
important steps, in the same direction, have been effected by investiga-
tions into the absorption of radiant heat proceeding from different
sources by solid, fluid, and gaseous bodies. And it is a curious ex-
ample of the inter-connection of the various branches of physical
science, that some of the results thus obtained have proved of great
importance in meteorology.

SPECTROSCOPY.

The existence of numerous dark lines, constant in their number and
position in the various regions of the solar spectrum, was made out by
Frauvhofer in the early part of the present century, but more than
forty years elapsed before their causes were ascertained and theif im-
portance recognized. Spectroscopy, which then took its rise, is proba-
bly that employment of physical knowledge, already won, as a means
of further acquisition, which most impresses the imagination. For it
has suddenly and immensely enlarged our power of overcoming the
obstacles which almost infinite minnteness on the one hand, and almost
infinite distance on the other, have hitherto opposed to the recognition
of the presence and the condition of matter. One eighteen-millionth
of a grain of sodium in the flame of a spirit-lamp may be detected by
this instrument; and, at the same time, it gives trustworthy indica-
tions of the material constitution not only of the sun, but of the far-
thest of those fixed stars and nebule which afford sufficient light to
affect the eye, or the photographic plate, of the inquirer?

ELECTRICAL ADVANCES.

The mathematical and experimental elucidation of the phenomena of
electricity, and the study of the relations of this form of energy with

chemical and thermal action, had made extensive progress before 1837.
But the determination of the influence of magnetism on light, the dis-
covery of diamagnetism, of the influence of crystalline structure on

city, all belong tothe present epoch. To it also appertain the practical
execution and the working out of the results of the great international
system of observations on terrestrial magnetism, suggested by Hum-
boldt in 1836; and the invention of instruments of infinite delicacy and
precision for the quantitative determination of electrical phenomena.
The voltaic battery has received vast improvements; while the inven-
tion of magneto-electric engines and of improved means of prodacing
ordinary electricity has provided sources of electrical energy vastly
superior to any before extant in power, and far more convenient for.
use.

It is perhaps this branch of physical science which may claim the
palm for its practical fruits, no less than for the aid which it has fur-
nished to the investigation of other parts of the field of physical sci-
ence. The idea of the practicability of establishing a communication
between distant points, by means of electricity, could hardly fail to
have simmered in the minds of ingenious men, since well-nigh a cen-
tury ago, experimental proof was given that electric disturbances could
be propagated through a wire 12,000 feet long. Various methods of
carrying the suggestion into practice had been effected with some de-
gree of success; but the system of electric telegraphy, which, at the
present time, brings all parts of the civilized world within a few min-
utes of one another, originated only about the commencement of the
epoch under consideration. In its influence on the course of human
affairs, this invention takes its place beside that of gunpowder, which
tended to abolish the physical inequalities of fighting men,—of print-
ing, which tended to destroy the effect of inequalities in wealth among
learning men,—of steam transport, which has done the like for travel-
ling men. All these gifts of science are aids in the process of levelling
up; of removing the ignorant and baneful prejudices of nation against
nation, province against province, and class against class; of assuring
that social order which is the foundation of progress, which has re-
deemed Europe from barbarism, and against which one is glad to think
that those who, in our time, are employing themselves in fanning the
embers of ancient wrong, in setting class against class, and in trying
to tear asunder the existing bonds of unity, are undertaking a futile
Struggle. The telephone is only second in practical importance to the
electric telegraph. Invented, as it were, only the other day, it has
already taken its place as an appliance of daily life. Sixty years ago
the extraction of metals from their solutions, by the electric current,
was simply a highly interesting scientific fact. At the present day
the galvano-plastic art is a great industry; and, in combination with
photography, promises to be of endless service in the arts. Electric

lighting is another great gift of science to civilization, the practical
effects of which have not yet been fully developed, largely on account
of its cost. But those whose memories go back to the tinder-box pe-
riod, and recollect the cost of the first lucifer matches, will not despair
of the results of the application of science and ingenuity to the cheap
production of anything for which there is a large demand.

The influence of the progress of electrical knowledge and invention
upon that of investigation in other fields of science is highly remark-
able. The combination of electrical with mechanical contrivances has
produced instruments by which not only may extremely small intervals
of time be exactly measured, but the varying rapidity of movements,
which take place in such intervals and appear to the ordinary sense in-
stantaneous, is recorded. The duration of the winking of an eye is a
proverbial expression for an instantaneous action; but, by the help of
the revolving cylinder and the electrical-marking apparatus, it is possi-
ble to obtain a graphic record of such an action, in which, if it endures
a fraction of a second, that fraction shall be subdivided into a hundred
or a thousand equal parts, and the state of the action at each hundredth
or thousandth of a second exhibited. In fact, these instruments may be
said to be time-microscopes. Such appliances have not only effected a
revolution in physiology by the power of analyzing the phenomena of
muscular and nervous activity which they have conferred, but they have
furnished new methods of measuring the rate of movement of projectiles
to the artillerist. Again, the microphone, which renders the minutest
movements audible, and which enables a listener to hear the footfall of
a fly, has equipped the sense of hearing with the means of entering
almost as deeply into the penetralia of nature as does the sense of sight.

PHOTOGRAPHY.

That light exerts a remarkable influence in bringing about certain
chemical combinations and decompositions was well known fifty years
ago, and various more or less successful attempts to produce permanent
pictures by the help of that knowledge had already been made. It was
not till 1839, however, that practical success was obtained; but the
“‘daguerreotypes ” were both cumbrous and costly, and photography
would never have attained its present important development had not
the progress of invention substituted paper and glass for the silvered
plates then in use. It is not my affair to dwell upon the practical appli-
cation of the photography of the present day, but it is germane to my
purpose to remark that it has furnished a most valuable accessory to
the methods of recording motions and lapse of time already in exist-
ence. In the hands of the astronomer and the meteorologist it has
yielded means of registering terrestrial, solar, planetary, and stellar
phenomena, independent of the sources of error attendant on ordinary
observation; in the hands of the physicist not only does it record spec-
troscopic phenomena with unsurpassable ease and precision, but it has

revealed the existence of rays having powerful chemical energy, or be-
yond the visible limits of either end of the spectrum; while, to the
naturalist, it furnishes the means by which the forms of many highly
complicated objects may be represented, without that possibility of error
which is inherent in the work of the draughtsman. In fact, in many
cases, the stern impartiality of photography is an objection to its em.
ployment,—it makes no distinction between the important and the un-
important; and hence photographs of dissections, forexample, are rarely
so useful as the work of a draughtsman who is at once accurate and in-
telligent.
ASTRONOMY.

The determination of the existence of a new planet, Neptune, far be-
yond the previously known bounds of the solar system, by mathematical
deduction from the facts of perturbation ; and the immediate confirma-
tion of that determination, in the year 1846, by observers who turned
their telescopes into the part of the heavens indicated as its place, con-
stitute a remarkable testimony of nature to the validity of the principles
of the astronomy of our time. In addition, so many new asteroids have
been added to those which were already known to circulate in the place
which theoretically should be occupied by a planet, between Mars and
Jupiter, that their number now amounts to between two and three hun-
dred. I have already alluded to the extension of our knowledge of the
nature of the heavenly bodies by the employment of spectroscopy. It
has not only thrown wonderful light upon the physical and chemical
constitution of the sun, fixed stars, and nebule and comets, but it holds
out a prospect of obtaining definite evidence as to the nature of our
so-called elementary bodies.

ASTRONOMIC GEOLOGY.

The application of the generalizations of thermoties to the problem of
the duration of the earth, and of deductions from tidal phenomena to
the determination of the length of the day and of the time of revolution
of the moon, in past epochs of the history of the universe; and the
demonstration of the competency of the great secular changes, known
under the general name of the precession of the equinoxes, to cause
corresponding modifications in the climate of the two hemispheres of
our globe, have brought astronomy into intimate relation with geol-
ogy. Geology, in fact, proves that in the course of the past history
of the earth, the climatic conditions of the same regions have been
widely different, and seeks the explanation of this important truth from
the sister sciences. The facts that, in the middle of the Tertiary epoch,
evergreen trees abounded within the arctic circle; and that, in the long
subsequent Quaternary epoch, an arctic climate, with its accompaniment
of gigantic glaciers, obtained in the northern hemisphere, as far south
as Switzerland and central France, are as well established as any truths
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 91

of science. But, whether the explanation of these extreme variations
in the mean temperature of a great part of the northern hemisphere is
to be sought in the concomitant changes in the distribution of land and
water surfaces of which geology affords evidence, or in astronomical
conditions, such as those to which I have referred, 1s a question which
must await its answer from the science of the future.

BIOLOGY.

Turning now to the great steps in that vast progress which the bio-
logical sciences have made since 1537, we are met, on the threshold of
our epoch, with perhaps the greatest of all,—namely, the promulgation
by Schwann, in 1839, of the generalization known as the “ cell theory,”
the application and extension of which by a host of subsequent investi-
gators has revolutionized morphology, development, and physiology.
Thanks to the immense series of labors thus inaugurated, the following
fundamental truths have been established:

All living bodies contain substances of closely similar physical and
chemical composition, which constitute the physical basis of life, known
as protoplasm. So far as our present knowledge goes, this takes its
origin only from pre-existing protoplasm.

All complex living bodies consist, at one period of their existence, of
an aggregate of minute portions of such substance, of similar structure,
called cells, each cell having its own life independent of the others,
though influenced by them.

All the morphological characters of animals and plants are the results
of the mode of multiplication, growth, and structural metamorphosis of
these cells, considered as morphological units.

All the physiological activities of animals and plants—assimilation,
secretion, excretion, motion, generation—are the expression of the ac-
tivities of the cells considered as physiological units. Each individual,
among the higher animals and plants, is a synthesis of millions of sub-
ordinate individualities. Its individuality, therefore, is that of a “ civ-
itas” in the ancient sense, or that of the Leviathan of Hobbes.

There is no absolute line of demarkation between animals and plants.
The intimate structure, and the modes of change, in the cells of the two
are fundamentally the same. Moreover, the higher forms are evolved
from lower, in the course of their development, by analogous processes
of differentiation, coalescence, and reduction in both the vegetable and
the animal worlds.

At the present time the cell theory, in consequence of recent inves.
tigations into the structure and metamorphosis of the ‘ nucleus,” is
undergoing a new development of great significance, which, among
other things, foreshadows the possibility of the establishment of a phy-
sical theory of heredity, on a safer foundation than those which Buffon
and Darwin have devised.
92 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

The popular belief in abiogenesis, or the so-called “ spontaneous”
generation of the lower forms of life, which was accepted by all the
philosophers of antiquity, held its ground down to the middle of the
seventeenth century. Notwithstanding the frequent citation of the
phrase, wrongfully attributed to Harvey, ‘‘ Omne vivum ex ovo,” that
great physiologist believed in spontaneous generation as firmly as Aris-
totle did. And it was only in the latter part of the seventeenth century
that Redi, by simple and well-devised experiments, demonstrated that
in a great number of cases of supposed spontaneous generation, the
animals which made their appearance owed their origin to the ordinary
process of reproduction, and thus shook the ancient doctrine to its foun-
dations. In the middle of the eighteenth century it was revived in a
new form, by Needham and Buffon; but the expeyiments of Spalianzani
enrorced the conclusions of Redi, and compelled the advocates of the
occurrence of spontaneous generation to seek evidence for their hypoth-
esis only among the parasites and the lowest and minutest organisms.
It is just fifty years since Schwann and others proved that even with
respect to them, the supposed evidence of abiogenesis was untrust-
worthy.

During the present epoch the question whether living matter can be
produced in any other way than by the physiological activity of other liv-
ing matter has been discussed afresh with great vigor; and the problem has
been investigated by experimental methods of a precision and refinement
unknown to previous investigators. The result is that the evidence in
favor of abiogenesis has utterly broken down in every case which has
been properly tested. So far as the lowest and minutest organisms are
concerned, it has been proved that they never make their appearance
if those precautions by which their germs are certainly excluded are
taken. And, in regard to parasites, every case which seemed to. make
for their generation from the substance of the animal or plant which
they infest has been proved to have a totally different significance.
Whether not-living matter may pass, or ever has under any conditions
passed into living matter, without the agency of pre-existing living
matter, necessarily remains an open question; all that can be said is
that it does not undergo this metamorphosis under any known condi-
tions. Those who take a monistic view of the physical world may fairly
hold abiogenesis as a pious opinion, supported by analogy and defended
by our ignorance. But, as matters stand, it is equally justifiable to re-
gard the physical world as a sort of dual monarchy. The kingdoms of
living matter and of not-living matter are under one system of laws,
and there is a perfect freedom of exchange and transit from one to the
other. But no claim to biological nationality is valid except birth.

In the department of anatomy and development a host of accurate
and patient inquirers, aided by novel methods of preparation, which
enable the anatomist to exhaust the details of visible structure and to
reproduce them with geometrical precision, have investigated every

important group of living animals and plants, no less than the fossil
relics of former faune and flor. An enormous addition has thus been
made to our knowledge, especially of the lower forms of life, and it may
be said that morphology, however inexhaustible in detail, is complete in
its broad features. Classification, which is merely a convenient sum-
mary expression of morphological facts, has undergone a corresponding
improvement. The breaks which formerly separated our groups from
one another, as animals from plants, vertebrates from invertebrates,
cryptogams from phanerogams, have either been filled up or shown
to have no theoretical significance. The question of the position of
man, aS an animal, has given rise to much disputation, with the result
of proving that there is no anatomical or developmental character by
which he is more widely distinguished from the group of animals most
nearly allied to him, than they are from one another. In fact, in this
particular, the classification of Linnzeus has been proved to be more in
accordance with the facts than those of most of his successors.

ANTHROPOLOGY.

The study of man, as a genus and species of the animal world, con-
ducted with reference to no other considerations than those which
would be admitted by the investigator of any other form of animal
life, has given rise to a special branch of biology known as Anthropol-
ogy, which has grown with great rapidity. Numerous societies devoted
to this portion of science have sprung up, and the energy of its devo-
tees has produced a copious literature. The physical characters of the
various races of men have been studied with a minuteness and accu-
racy heretofore unknown; and demonstrative evidence of the existence
of human contemporaries of the extinct animals of the latest geological
epoch has been obtained; physical science has thus been brought into
the closest relation with history and with archeology ; and the striking
investigations which, during our time, have put beyond doubt the vast
antiquity of Babylonian and Egyptian civilization, are in perfect har-
mony with the conclusions of anthropology as to the antiquity of the
human species.

Classification is a logical process which consists in putting together
those things which are like and keeping asunder those which are un-
like; and a morphological classification, of course, takes notes only of
morphological likeness and unlikeness. So long, therefore, as our mor-
phological knowledge was almost wholly confined to anatumy, the
characters of groups were solely anatomical; but as the phenomena of
embryology were explored, the likeness and unlikeness of individual
development had to be taken into account; and at present, the study of
ancestral evolution introduces a new element of likeness and unlike-
hess which is not only eminently deserving of recognition, but must
ultimately predominate over all others. A classification which shall
represent the process of ancestral evolution is, in tact, the end which
é

the labors of the philosophical taxonomist must keep in view. But it
is an end which can not be attained until the progress of paleontology
has given us far more insight than we yet possess into the historical
facts of the case. Much ofthe speculative “ phylogeny,” which abounds
among my present contemporaries, reminds me very forcibly of the
speculative morphology, unchecked by a knowledge of development,
which was rife in my youth. As hypothesis, suggesting inquiry in this
or that direction, it is often extremely useful; but when the product
of such speculation is placed on a level with those generalizations of
morphological truths which are represented by the definitions of natural
groups, it tends to confuse faney with fact and to create mere disorder.
We are in danger of drifting into a new “ Natur-Philosophie” worse
than the old, because there is less excuse for it. Boyle did great serv-
ice to science by his ‘‘Sceptical Chemist,” and I am inclined to think
that at the present day a *‘ Sceptical Biologist” might exert an equally
beneficent influence.

PHYSIOLOGY.

Whoso wishes to gain a clear conception of the progress of physiology
since 1837, will do well to compare Miiller’s ‘“ Physiolog;,” which ap-
peared in 1835, and Drapiez’s edition of Kichard’s “ Nouveaux Hléments
de Botanique,” published in 1837, with any of the present hand-books
of animal and vegetable physiology. Miiller’s work was a masterpiece,
unsurpassed since the time of Haller, and Richard’s book enjoyed a
great reputation at the time; but their successors transport one into a
new world. That which characterizes the new physiology, is that it is
permeated by, and indeed based upon conceptions which, though not
wholly absent, are but dawning on the minds of the older writers.

Modern physiology sets forth as its chief ends: TVirstly, the ascertain-
ment of the facts and conditions of cell-life in general. Secondty, in
composite organisms, the analysis of the functions of organs into those
of the cells of which they are composed. Thirdly, the explication of
the processes by which this local cell-life is directly or indirectly con-

trolled and brought into relation with the life of the rest of the cells

which compose the organism. Fourthly, the investigation of the phe-
nomena of lifein general, on the assumption that the physical and chem-
ical processes which take place in the living body are of the same order
as those which take place out of it; and that whatever energy is exerted
in producing such phenomena is derived from the common stock of en-
ergy in the universe. In the fifth place modern physiology investigates
the relation between physical and psychical phenomena, on the assump-
tion that molecular changes in definite portions of nervous matter stand
in the relation of necessary antecedents to definite mental states and
operations. The work which has been done in each of the directions
here indicated is vast, and the accumulation of solid knowledge, which
has been effected, is correspondingly great, For the first time in the
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 95

history of science, physiologists are now in the position to say that they
have arrived at clear and distinct, though by no means complete, con-
ceptions of the manner in which the great functions of assimilation,
respiration, secretion, distribution of nutriment, removal of waste prod-
ucts, motion, sensation, and reproduction are performed; while the op-
ération of the nervous system, as a regulative apparatus, which in-
fluences the origination and the transmission of manifestations of. ac-
tivity, either within itself or in other organs, has been largely elucidated.

] have pointed out, in an earlier part of this chapter, that the history
of all branches of science proves that they must attain a considerable
stage of development before they yield practical “fruits;” and this is
eminently true of physiology. It is only within the present epoch that
physiology and chemistry have reached the point at which they could
offer a scientific foundation to agriculture, and it is only within the
present epoch that zoology and physiology have yielded any very great
aid to pathology and hygiene. But within that time they have already
rendered highly important services by the exploration of the phe-
nomena of parasitism. Not only have the history of the animal para:
sites, such as the tapeworms and the trichina, which infest men and
animals, with deadly results, been cleared up by means of experimental
investigations, and efficient modes of prevention deduced from the data
so obtained, but the terrible agency of the parasitic fungi and of the
infinitesimally minute microbes, which work far greater havoc among
plants and animals, has been brought to light. The “particulate” or
‘‘verm” theory of disease, as it is called, long since suggested, has ob-
tained a firm foundation, in so far as it has been proved to be true in
respect of sundry epidemic disorders. Moreover, it has theoretically
justified prophylactic measures, such as vaccination, which formerly
rested on a merely empirical basis; and it has been extended to other
diseases with excellent results. Further, just as the discovery of the
cause of scabies proved the absurdity of many of the old prescriptions
for the prevention and treatment of that disease, so the discovery of
the cause of splenic fever, and other such maladies, has given a new
direction to prophylactic and curative measures against the worst
scourges of humanity. Unless the fanaticism of philozoic sentiment
overpowers the voice of philanthropy, and the love of dogs and cats
supersedes that of one’s neighbor, the progress of experimental physi-
ology and pathology will indubitably, in course of time, place medi-
cine and hygiene upon a rational basis. Two centuries ago England
was devastated by the plague; cleanliness and common sense were
enough to free us from its ravages. One century since small-pox was
almost as great a scourge; science, though working empirically, and
almost in the dark, has reduced that evil to relative insignificance. At
the present time, science working in the light of clear knowledge, has
attacked splenic fever and has beaten it. It is attacking hydrophobia
with no mean premise of success; sooner or later it will deal in the
96 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

same way with diphtheria, typhoid and scarlet fever. To one who has
seen half a street swept clear of its children, or has lost his own by
these horrible pestilences, passing one’s offspring through the fire to
Moloch seems humanity compared with the proposal to deprive them of
half their chances of health and life because of the discomfort to dogs
and cats, rabbits and frogs, which may be involved in the search for
means of guarding them.

EXPLORATION.

An immense extension has been effected in our knowledge of the dis-
tribution of plants and animals; and the elucidation of the causes which
have brought about that distribution has been greatly advanced. The
establishment of meteorological observations by all civilized nations,
has furnished a solid foundation to climatology ; while a growing sense
of the importance of the influence of the “ struggle for existence” affords
a wholesome check to the tendency to overrate the influence of climate
on distribution. Expeditions, such as that of the Challenger, equipped,
not for geographical exploration and discovery, but for the purpose of
throwing light on problems of physical and biological science, have
been sent out by our own and other Governments, and have obtained
stores of information of the greatest value. For the first time, we are
in possession of something like precise knowledge of the physical feat-
ures of the deep seas, and of the living pepulation of the floor of the
ocean. ‘The careful and exhaustive study of the phenomena presented
by the accumulations of snow and ice, in polar and mountainous regions,
which has taken place in our time, has not only revealed to the geologist
an agent of denudation and transport, which has slowly and quietly
produced effects, formerly confidently referred to diluvial catastrophes,
but it has suggested new methods of accounting for various puzzling
facts of distribution,

PAL AONTOLOGY.

Paleontology, which treats of the extinct forms of life and their suc-
cession and distribution upon our globe, a branch of science which
could hardly be said to exist a century ago, has undergone a wonderful
development in our epoch. In some groups of animals and plants the
extinct representatives, already known, are more numerous and impor-
tant than the living. There can be no doubt thaf the existing Fauna
and Flora is but the last term of a long series of equally numerous con-
temporary species, which have succeeded one another, by theslow and
gradual substitution of species for species, in the vast interval of time
which has elapsed between the deposition of the earliest fossiliferous
strata and the present day. There is no reasonable ground for believ-
jng that the oldest remains yet obtained carry us even near the begin-
nings of life. The impressive warnings of Lyell against hasty specula-
tions, based upon negative evidence, have been fully justified; time
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 97

after time, highly organized types have been discovered in formations
of an age in which the existence of such forms of life had been confi-
dently declared to be impossible. The western territories of the United
States alone have yielded a world of extinct animal forms, undreamed
of fifty years ago. And wherever sufficiently numerous series of the re-
mains of any given group, which has endured for a long space of time,
are carefully examined, their morphological relations are never in dis-
cordance with the requirements of the doctrine of evolution. and often
afford convincing evidence of it. At the same time, it has been shown
that certain forms persist with very little change, from the oldest to the
newest fossiliferous formations; and thus show that progressive devel-
opment is a contingent, and not a necessary result, of the nature of liv-
ing matter.

GEOLOGY.

Geology is, as it were, the biology of our planet as a whole. In so
far as it comprises the surface configuration and the inner structure of
the earth, it answers to morphology; in so far as it studies changes of
condition and their causes, it corresponds with physiology; in so far as
it deals with the causes which have effected the progress of the earth
from its earliest to its present state, it forms part of the general doc-
trine of evolution. An interesting contrast between the geology of the
present day and that of halfa century ago is presented by the complete
emancipation of the modern geologist from the controlling and pervert-
ing influence of theology, all-powerful at the earlier date. As the geol-
ogist of my young days wrote, he had one eye upon fact and the other
on Genesis; at present he wisely keeps’ both eyes on fact and ig-
nores the pentateuchal mythology altogether. The publication of the
“Principles of Geology” brought upon its illustrious author a period
of social ostracism ; the instruction given to our children is based upon
those principles. Whewell had the courage to attack Lyell’s funda-
mental assumption (which surely is a dictate of common sense) that we
ought to exhaust known causes, before seeking for the explanation of
geological phenomena in causes of which we have no experience. But
geology has advanced to its present state by working from Lyell’s *
axiom; and to this day the record of the stratified rocks affords no proof
that the intensity or the rapidity of the causes of change has ever varied
between wider limits than those between which the operations of nature
have taken place in the youngest geological epochs.

An incalculable benefit has accrued to geological science from the
accurate and detailed surveys which have now been executed by skilled
geologists employed by the Governments of all parts of the civilized

*Perhaps I ought rather to say Buffon’s axiom. For that great naturalist and
writer embodied the principles of sound geology in a pithy phrase of the Théorie de
la Terre: “ Pour juger de ce qui est arrivé, et méme de ce qui arrivera, nous n’avons
qua examiner ce qui arrive.”

world. In geology the study of large maps is as important as it is said
to bein politics; and sections, on a true scale, are even more important,
in so far as they are essential to the apprehension of the extraordinary
insignificance of geological perturbations in relation to the whole mass
of our planet. It should never be forgotten that what we call “catas-
trophes” are, in relation to the earth, changes, the equivalents of which
would be well represented by the development of a few pimples, or the
scratch of a pin, on a man’s head. Vast regions of the earth’s surface
remain geologically unknown; but the area already fairly explored is
many times greater than it was in 1837, and in many parts of Europe
and the United States the structure of the superficial crust of the earth
has been investigated with great minuteness.

The parallel between Biology and Geology which I have drawn is
further illustrated by the modern growth of that branch of the science
known as Petrology, which answers to Histology, and has made the
microscope as essential an instrument to the geological as to the bio-
logical investigator.

The evidence of the importance of causes now in operation has been
wonderfully enlarged by the study of glacial phenomena, by that of
earthquakes and voleanoes, and by that of the efficacy of heat and cold,
wind, rain, and rivers as agents of denudation and transport. On the
other hand, the exploration of coral reefs and of the deposits now tak-
ing place at the-bottom of the great oceans has proved that in animal
and plant life, we have agents of reconstruction of a potency hitherto
unsuspected.

There is no study better fitted than that of geology to impress upon
men of general culture that.conviction of the unbroken sequence of the
order of natural phenomena throughout the duration of the universe,
which is the great, and perhaps the most important, effect of the in-
crease of natural knowledge.
RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR. 1886.

ASTRONOMY, FOR 1886.

By WILLIAM C. WINLOCK,
Assistant Astronomer, United States Naval Observatory,

In preparing the review of Astronomy for 1886, the method and ar-

* rangement adopted by Professor Holden from i879 to 1884 have been

adhered to without essential modification. The record is intended pri-

marily to serve as a series of notes for those who have not access to a

large astronomical library, but it is hoped that the bibliography will be

found useful to the professional astronomer as a reference list of tech-
nical papers.

Much assistance has been derived from the reviews and abstracts in
the Bulletin Astronomique, the Observatory, Nature, the Atheneum,
and other periodicals, and the writer is indebted to the directors of
many observatories for the communication of information not otherwise
available.

A subject-index to the review has been effected by inserting the nec-
essary page-references in the bibliography.

DISTRIBUTION OF STARS.

Distribution of the stars in Schinfeld’s Durchmusterung.—The comple-
tion of the Durchmusterung to — 23° of declination by Argelander’s
successor, Dr. Schonfeld, has given Professor Seeliger the opportunity
of extending his counts of stars to a considerable portion of the south-
ern hemisphere. Professor Seeliger’s paper “ Uber die Vertheilung
der Sterne.auf der siidlichen Halbkugel nach Schinfeld’s ‘ Durehmus-
terung,’” has been published in the Proceedings of the Bavarian Acad-
emy of Sciences, and résumés may be found in the Bulletin astrono-
mique (3: 593-6), the Observatory (9: 399), and Nature (34: 627). An
abstract of Professor Seeliger’s previous work was given in the “Ac-
count of the Progress in Astronomy” for 1884, and his present discus-
sion has been carried out on a plan similar to that there described.

99
100 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

The stars are divided into eight classes, one more than previously
used, as Schénfeld has included stars of the tenth magnitude, whereas
Argelander stopped at 9.5.

Schénfeld’s zones begin at — 2°, but the ‘ counts” may be carried up
to the equator by utilizing Argelander’s work ; the slight difference in
limiting magnitude will not affect materially the result. The stars
embraced in each degree of declination have been divided into groups
of twenty minutes in right ascension, though only the sums for each
forty minutes have been published.

The number of stars in each of the eight classes is as follows:

The numbers in column A comprise Schoénfeld’s stars only ; column
B includes Argelander’s stars, from 0° to —2°, for the first seven
classes: to complete Class VIII about 3,600 should be added. The
number of stars thus counted in the “Southern Durchmusterung” proper
is, therefore, 133,580, and adding to this 79 objects which are classed as
nebule or variables, there results the grand total, 133,659.

In order to investigate the influence of the Milky Way on the distri-
bution of these stars, Professor Seeliger proceeds, as in his, former
paper, to form the “ gradient,” which expresses for each class the
rapidity of increase in the number of stars as we approach the Milky
Way. Comparing the values of the gradient with these found for
Argelander’s Durchmusterung, it is seen that, as far as Schénfeld’s
work can be considered typical of the southern hemisphere as a whole
(it must be remembered, however, that it only embraces one-third
thereof) the influence of the Milky Way on stellar distribution, at least
for stars down to the eighth magnitude, appears to be less marked for
the southern than for the northern bemisphere. But it may well be
that, especially in the higher classes of stars, local and accidental irreg-
ularities are the cause of this apparent difference. With regard to the
question as to which hemisphere is the richer in stars, it appears that
there is no decided difference shown by the two surveys under consider-
ation. When Argelander’s numbers are corrected so as to be compara-
ble with Shéufeld’s, taking stars down to the ninth magnitude, inclu-
ASTRONOMY. 101

sive, the totals are, for the former, 34,324, and for the latter, 34,119,
a difference which may reasonably be attributed to accidental cireum-
stances.

The whole discussion of the distribution of the stars will no doubt
be mach facilitated by the application of photography.

A writer in L’Astronomie has concluded that the total number of
stars in ‘our nebula”—on the assumption that the combined light of
the stars is equal to one-tenth that of the full moon—must be sixty-six
thousand million.

NEBULAi AND STAR CLUSTERS.

New nebule.—Two lists, embracing 476 new nebule discovered with
the 26-inch equatorial of the Leander McCormick Observatory, have
been published in the Astronomical Journal (7: 9, 57) by Professor
Stone. The observers were Professor Stone himself, Mr. Leavenworth,
and Mr. Muller. In the earlier observations Herschel’s abbreviations
were used to designate brightness and size. Afterwards numerical
magnitudes were employed to indicate brightness, assuming that the
faintest nebula visible in the 26-inch refractor with power 167, is 16.3,
that being the theoretical limit for stars. The magnitudes given refer
to the nucleus, or, in case there is no nucleus, to the brightest part.
Still later the custom was instituted of estimating the diameters of the
nebul in fractions of the diameter of the field, and from these deducing
their dimensions in minutes of are.

Dr. Swift has published (Astron. Nachr., 115: 153, 257; 116: 33) eata-
logues 3, 4, and 5 of nebule discovered at the Warner Observatory. He
States in the report of the observatory that 540 nebule have been dis-
covered up to January 1, 1887. Mr. Muller has found that fifteen of
“Catalogue No.5” have already been announced by other observers.
(Sid. Mess., 6: 83.)

The Pleiades.—M. Kayet, in order to test the penetrating power of
the 14-inch Bordeaux equatorial, has made a revision of Wolf’s chart
of the Pleiades, and has determined accurately the positions of 143
Stars, most of them of the fourteenth or fifteenth magnitude, not given
by Wolf.

The Henry brothers have also compared their photographs of the
Pleiades with Wolf’s chart, and have been able to detect 1,421 stars
where Wolf shows but 625, the telescopes used being of nearly the same
aperture. In order to avoid errors which might arise from impurities
in the photographic plate, three exposures, of an hour each, were made,
and the plate was shifted between exposures, so that three images of
each star are obtained, forming an equilateral triangle. Stars as faint

“as the sixteenth maguitude are depicted. All the stars of Wolf’s chart
are found upon the photograph except ten, and these the Messrs. Henry
have been unable to find in the sky. A number of faint companions
haye been detected close to several of the brightest stars of the group,
102 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

and in several cases where M. Wolf has observed a faint companion to
a bright star, the photograph has shown that the magnitude of the
former was underestimated. One of the advantages of photography
seems to be that it brings out faint objects which are lost to the eye, on
account of their proximity to bright stars. Besides the nebula discov-
ered about Maia, a nebulous streak has been seen near Electra, and
details of the Merope nebula have been made out, which had not been
recognized before, except by Common.

Dr. Weiss has expressed a strong suspicion that all of the region to the
north and west of Aleyone is a vast nebula, only the brightest portions
of which are shown by our best telescopes. He recalls a statement by
Schmidt in 1863, that a small planet seemed to lose a part of its light
in traversing the region between Alcyone and Electra.

Dr. Kammermann has been able to see the new Maia nebula with
the 10-inch refractor of the Geneva Observatory by masking the bright
star, and by using a special eye-piece provided with diaphragms, and
a plate of uranium glass, to increase the intensity of the chemical rays.

A paper by Dr. Elkin upon **A comparison of the places of the Pleiades
as determined by the Kénigsberg and Yale College heliometers” was read
at the Buffalo meeting of the American Association. Provisional results
show unguestioned change of position with reference to 77 Taurisince 1840.
Most of the brighter stars of the group, as shown by Neweomb in his
‘‘ Standard Stars,” go with 7 Tauri, but among the smaller stars there
are departures from this community of proper motion. Professor Pick-
ering has pointed out that the agreement of the spectra of certain of
these stars strongiy confirms the probability of their physical connec
tion.

ASTRONOMICAL CONSTANTS.

Lewy’s method of determining the elements of refraction—M. Lowy
has elaborated his method of determining the elements of refraction by
means of a reflecting prism placed in front of the object-glass of an
equatorial, and has submitted the problem to a careful mathematical
analysis in several papers communicated to the French Academy. The
full titles of these important papers are given in our “biobligraphy.” Dr.
till speaks very highly of the plan, and has suggested some modifica-
tions of the details which he thinks would increase the ease and accu-
racy of observations.

Onpolzer’s astronomical refraction—The late Dr. von Oppolzer pub-
lished in the Transactions of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, of
Vienna, a paper containing a theoretical discussion of the problem of
astronomical refraction followed by numerical tables intended to facil-
itate the practical application of the results at which he arrived. When
the approximations are carried far enough, the method seems capable ~
of giving results of great accuracy, even for large zenith distances.

A correction for gravity in the use of refraction tables.—Proft, Cleve-
ASTRONOMY. 103

land Abbe has directed attention to a neglected correction in the use
of refraction tables, which appears as a function of the latitude.
Thirty inches of mercury in the barometer at the equator indicate a
less density of the atmosphere than 30 inches at the poles, consequently
the barometer readings should be corrected for differences of lati-
tude. This is accomplished by simply adding to the formula one more
factor for gravity. Professor Abbe shows that the difference of latitude
between Pulkowa and Washington makes a difference of 0’. 1 in the
refraction at 45° zenith distance, and increases with the zenith distance.
We have here a partial explanation, at least, of systematic differences
in declination shown by different catalogues.

Correction for differential refraction in declination.—Professor MeNeill,
of Princeton, has devised (Astron. Nachr., 114:385) a method of correct-
ing micrometer observations for refraction, applicable to the diagonal-
square micrometer, the ring micrometer, and others of the same class.
The correction to the observed difference of declination is not deter-
mined by a special separate computation, but the true difference -is
directly determined, the corrections being applied to the logarithms in
the course of the computation. Tables are given which will be found
very useful to observers.

In a “Zusatz” to this communication, Dr. Krueger gives a résumé of
differential refraction formule for ring and filar micrometers.

M. Radanu suggests (Bull. astron., 3:373) that Professor MeNeill’s prin-
cipal table may be replaced by a simple graphical table which will give
at a glance the correction sought.

The diurnal nutation of the earth’s axis.—M. Folie, about three years
ago, submitted to the Paris Academy a theory of the diurnal nutation
of the earth’s axis, based upon the assumption that the earth has a
fluid nucleus; and he has recently given (Compt. Rend., Dec. 13, 1886)
some practical illustrations of his formule. These formule contain
two constants to be determined by observation: the constant of diurnal
nutation itself, and the longitude, referred to an initial meridian. Very
accordant results are obtained from the rather meager observational
material available, the value of the diurnal constant being about 0.2.
The new correction applied to a series of observations of Polaris made
at Pulkowa, smooths out the discordant observations in a most surpris-
ing manner. Further investigation of this subject seems highly desir-
able.

An abstract of the paper read by Prof. J. C. Adams at the Phila-
delphia meeting of the American Association, September 11, 1884, “On
the general values of the obliquity of the ecliptic, and of the precession
and inclination of the equator to the invariable plane, taking into ac-
count terms of the second order,” has appeared in the Observatory for
April, 1886, vol. 9, p. 150-154,

STAR CATALOGUES, ETC.

Schinfeld’s Southern Durchmusterung (1855.0).—This catalogue con-
talus the approximate positions of 153,659 stars between 2° and 23° of
south declination—that is, all stars between those limits down to the
tenth magnitude. It carries Argelander’s ‘ sweeps” as far south as the
latitude of Bonn will permit, and is on essentially the same plan as the
Northern Durchmusterung, Inthe details of the work, however, several
improvements have been made: Instead of Argelander’s little 3-inch
glass, magnifying nine times, Dr. Schénfeld used a telescope by Schroder
of 64 inches aperture with a magnifying power of twenty-six, and with
the field slightly i]luminated. The width of the zones was 14°, instead
of 2°, the width of the older zones. This invoived more hours of obser-
vation, but the accuracy of the work and the certainty of catching faint
stars were increased, since the observer was not obliged to take in every-
thing up to the limit of visibility. A further advantage which the
Southern Durchmusterung possesses 1s that Dr. Schénfeld Las himself
made all of the observations and revisions, so that the work is more
homogeneous than the Northern Durchmusterung. The observations
were begun, after some preliminary experiments, on the 6th of June,
1876; by the 28th of March, 1881, the zones had all been observed for
the second time. There are, including sixteen zones subsequently re-
observed, 363,922 observations, all reduced to 1855.0. The revision,
also by Dr. Schénfeld and with the same instrument, embraced 5,700
positions, and was finished between April, 1881, and March, 1884.

From the summary of the stars in each square degree it appears that
the Southern Durchmusterung is richer in stars than the Northern, in
the ratio of 1.21to1. The fainter stars (under the ninth magnitude)
are much more thoroughly observed than before, the limit being the
tenth magnitude instead of 9.5, that adopted by Argelander. The prob-
able error of a single estimation of magnitude for stars of the 9.5 mag-
nitude is only 0.11 magnitude, and for the seventh magnitude, 0.26
magnitude. The charts accompanying the catalogue contain an hour
each in right ascension. .

The Argentine General Catalogue.—The observations from which this
catalogue was formed were made with the meridian circle of the Cor-
doba Observatory during the years 1872~80. During these years the
zone observations were the chief object of attention, and the catalogue
contains the places of 32,448 stars whose positions were more elabo-
rately determined during the progress of that great work, and consti-
tutes an addition to our knowledge of southern stellar positions of per-
haps not less importance than the Cordoba Zone Catalogue. The Gen-
eral Catalogue gives the positions for the epoch 1875.0 of most of the
southern stars brighter than magnitude 84, the deficiencies in this re-
spect being chiefly found north of the parallel of 23°, at which the zone
begins. These omissions will be of comparatively small importance,
ASTRONOMY. 105

inasmuch as the Durchmusterung of Professor Schéutfield comprises all

the southern stars within this region, while accurate determinations of
the brighter ones will have been made in the re-observation of Lalande’s
stars now nearly completed at the Paris Observatory.

Pulkowa catalogue of 3,542 stars for 1855.0.—Volume vu of the Pul-
kowa Observations is to contain two catalogues of stars deduced from
observations made with the meridian circle from 1840 to 1869. The first
of these—the one that has just been published—contains, with the ex-
ception of the Pulkowa fundamental stars (observed with the transit
instrument and vertical circal), all Bradley’s stars between the north
pole and 15° south declination, and also a comparatively small number
of other stars down to the sixth magnitude, inclusive, given in the
Uranometria Nova of Argelander, in the same part of the sky. A few
fainter stars have also been taken into the catalogue. The whole work
has been in the hands of Dr. Backlund. (Bull. astron., November, 1886.)

Kam’s catalogue of ** Nachrichten” stars for 1855.0.—* Dr. N. M. Kam
of Schiedam has published in Verhandelingen der Koninklijke Akademie
van Wetenschappen, Deel. 24(Amsterdam), a star catalogue compiled
from the places of stars determined by meridian observations, which
have been extracted from volumes 1 to 66 of the Astronomische Nach-
richten, and reduced to the epoch 1855.0. The positions of the stars
contained in this catalogue were determined in connection with obser-
vations of planets and comets, and it was in compliance with Arge-
lander’s express desire that the work of collecting them and reducing
the positions to a common epoch was commenced by Hoek, then di-
rector of the Utrecht Observatory. Dr. Kam, who was Hoek’s assist-
ant, continued the work after the death of the latter, and has at length
been able to publish his results. The principal catalogue contains the
completely determined places of 4,350 stars, and is followed by two
subsidiary catalogues, the first giving the places of 236 stars, and the
second those of 335 stars; all of the latter, however, are incomplete,
i. é., the place is given in one element only. The catalogues are followed
by a comparison of the places, of the stars contained in them with
their places as given in the Bonn Durchmusterung, or, for stars south
of — 2° declination, with other authorities. Notes on proper motions,
corrigenda, etc., are appended, which are of considerable interest and
value.” (Nature, June 3, 1886.)

Romberg’s catalogue of * Nachrichten” stars (1855.0)—Herr Romberg,
of the Pulkowa Observatory, has compiled a catalogue of about 8,000
stars extracted from the Astronomische Nachrichten, volumes 67 to 112,
and his work now appears as Publication xvii of the Astronomische
Gesellschaft. This is a continuation of a similar compilation (Pub. VIII,
Astron. Gesellsch.), by Schjellerup, from the first sixty-six volumes of
the Nachrichten, and is prepared on much the same plan. The stars
have appeared in the Nachrichten as comparison stars for planets, com-
ets, etc., and have been collected by Romberg and reduced to 1855.0.
106 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 18386.

Right ascensions are given to seconds of time, declinations to the nearest
tenth of a minute of are. The catalogue proper is followed by several
useful pages of notes.

Jdinburgh catalogue.—Prof. Piazzi Smyth has given in volume xv of
the Edinburgh Astronomical Observations the results of observations
made from 1833 to 1872 upon some 3,890 B. A. C. stars, reduced to the
epochs 1830, 1870, 1880, and 1890. The catalogue begins with 4" 0 of
right ascension, the first four hours having appeared nine years ago as
volume xIv. The notes contain information in regard to the proper
motion, color, or duplicity of the stars.

Second Armagh catalogue of 3,300 stars for 1875.0.—After the comple-
tion of the observations of Bradley’s stars, the results of which were em-
bodied in the catalogue commonly known as the “ Armagh Catalogue,”
Dr. Robinson formed the plan of re-observing a number of stars from
Lalande’s “‘ Histoire céleste,” occurring in Baily’s catalogue. Observa-
tions were commenced in 1859 with the 33-inch mural circle and transit,
but were stopped after 1860 in order to change the mural into a 7-inch
transit circle. Work was resumed in 1863, and continued with more or
less regularity till 1883. The right ascensions of this catalogue depend
on the standard stars of the ** Nautical Almanae;” the north polar dis-
tances upon observations of the nadir. Dr. Dreyer, who succeeded Dr.
Robinson in 1882, found from 400 observations of 80 stars between 30°
and 100° N. P. D., that the probable error of a single observation in
right ascension was + 08.081, (the single errors having been multiplied
by cos 6); and in north polar distance -+-0’.85. For systematic errors
Armagh has been compared with Glasgow, and, indirectly through the
latter, a comparison is obtained with Auwers’ fundamental system.
From this comparison it appears that the north polar distances are in
fair agreement with Auwers’ catalogue, while the right ascensions
show considerable discordances.

Reliability of the star-places of Auwers’ Fundamental Catalogue.—Mr.
Chandler, having pointed out the possibility of error in the places of
certain stars (Observatory 8: 387), as given in the Berlin “ Jahrbuch,”
Herr Auwers has been induced to publish (Astron. Nachr., 114: 1-20)
some valuable and interesting remarks on the reliability of the places
of his Fundamental Catalogue (Pub. d. astron. Gesellsch., 14), from which
those given in the Berlin “ Jahrbuch” are derived. Herr Auwers ex-
plains the provisional character of the data on which some of his star-
places depend, and repeats in a more definite manner what he has already
said on the subject in Publication xtvy. In facet the proper motions
adopted for some of the stars are merely provisional, as has been pointed
out in the introduction to the catalogue. The proper motions employed
have been, as a rule, obtained from a comparison of Bradley’s places
with those of Greenwich, 1561, and in those cases in which Bradley has
only one observation, or observed the star in one element only, the
proper motion is given to one decimal place less than usual. The reader
ASTRONOMY. 107

is thus put on his guard, and knows that he should use the places of
certain stars with circumspection. Herr Auwers thinks that it would
be premature to attempt any correction of the catalogue-places before
the completion of the general revision, which has been undertaken by
the observers of the zones and by the Pulkowa astronomers. He, how-
ever, takes this opportunity of publishing the results of investigations
he has made as to the mean errors of the different catalogues employed
in the formation of the Fundamental Catalogue, viz, Pulkowa, 1845 and
1865; Greenwich, 1861 and 1872; Cambridge (U.S8.), 1872; Leipzig,
1868; and Leiden, 1868, for the principal'stars ; and in addition to these,
Pulkowa, 1871, for the supplementary stars.

The following are, in the mean (for declination — 10° to + 90°), the
mean errors, referred to the unit of weight, for the principal stars :

| P. 1845. | P. 1865. | G. 1861. me G. 1872. | C. 1872. | Lp. 1868. | L. 1868.

We have then, finally, for mean error of the right ascensions 0°.033
(for supplementary stars 0°.042), and for the declinations 0.59 (for sup-
plementary stars 0.67). The somewhat considerable difference in the
results for principal and for supplementary stars arises from the cir-
cumstance that Herr Auwers gave relatively too much weight to Pul-
kowa 1871, at least for the right ascensions. For the catalogue-places,
the mean errors are 0°.009 and 0.14 in R. A. and Decl., respectively, for
the principal stars, and 0°.026 and 0/.19 for the supplementary stars ;
where the mean error in R. A. refers to the total number of stars be-
tween — 10° and + 50°. Atthe present time, in Herr Auwers’ opinion,
the probable error of the star-places is not greater than 05.02 in R. A.
(for moderate declinations), and 0.15 in Decl. (Observatory, 9: 202,
May, 1886.)

In response to a suggestion by Dr. Gill, a number of astronomers
have expressed their willingness to co-operate in the systematic observa-
tion of stars which have been used in comet comparisons, faint stars
whose occultations have been observed, zones of stars used for scale or
screw values, orstars that have been used for geodetic purposes. Among
the observatories ready for this work are, the Cape of Good Hope,
Neuchatel, Bruxelles, Cointe, Taschkent, and Cordoba,
108 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Professor Holden, while at the Washburn Observatory, compiled a
list of all published corrections to his star catalogues, inserting the
errata in the bodies of the books themselves. The original sources from
which the errata were copied are given in the fourth volume of the
Publications of the observatory. The value of this list will be appre-
ciated by all astronomers who have occasion to make use of star cata-
logues.

The catalogue of stars of the British Association has been advertised
recently at 170 mark, or about $43. °

STELLAR PARALLAX.

Prof. A. Hall has given in Appendix 11 to the Washington Observa-
tions for 1883 the results of recent observations made with the 26-inch
equatorial to determine the parallaxes of a Lyre, 61 Cygni, 40 (0°)
Eridani, and 6  Cygni. The results are as follows:

Dr. W. Schur has published in the Astronomische Nachrichten (vol.
114, p. 161), a discussion of the parallax of the double star > Aurigze
from measures of position, angle, and distance made with 6-inch Strass-
burg refractor, in 1883-85. The final value for the parallax of the
fainter (ninth magnitude) star is + 0/111 4+ 0” 034. ‘Herr Schur
thinks that he is justified in asserting that the parailax of this star is
at least 0/’.1—a remarkable result, considering the fixity of the object.”

40 (0°?) Hridani.—Mr. J. E. Gore, using Professor Hall’s parallax,

DOUBLE STARS.

Two recent papers on personal equation in double-star observations
will be found of especial interest to those engaged in this class of work.
The first paper forms the subject of a thesis by M. Bigourdan, of the
Paris Observatory, submitted for the degree of doctor of physical
ASTRONOMY. 109

science. M. Bigourdan reviews the work of others in this field, gives
a description of apparatus which he has devised for investigating the
problem by means of artificial stars, and deduces his own personal
equation from a large number of measures made with this apparatus.
He finds that his personal equation is not affected by the position of
the eyes with respect to the line joining the stars nor by the altitude;
‘the brightness of the stars, on the other hand, does affect his measures.

The second paper referred to is by Mr. H. C. Wilson; formerly of the
Cincinnati Observatory, and is published in the Sidereal Messenger
(vol. 5, pp. 174, 211). Mr. Wilson gives an interesting sketch of the
history of the subject, together with an investigation of his personal
errors, obtained from observations made between 1882 and 1886, with
the equatorial of the Cincinnati Observatory. He finds that his meas-
ures, both of position angle and of distance, are slightly influenced
by the inclination of the head.

Spectroscopic method of determining the distance of a double star.—Mr.
A. A. Rambaut, of the Dublin Observatory, in a paper communicated to
the Royal Irish Academy on May 24, 1886, discusses at some length the
possibility of determining the distance of a double star by measures of
the relative velocities of the cemponents in the line of sight. Dr.
Huggins having demonstrated that it was practicable to measure the
rate of approach or recession of a star, it was seen that it would be
at least theoretically possible to determine the distance of a star by
this method. Mr. Rambaut’s critical examination of the conditions of
the problem shows however that the method can have but little prac-
tical application.

Orbits of double stars.—The following table gives the “ period of revo-
lution” in years, and “semi-axis major,” in seconds of arc, obtained for
a number of binary stars in recent determinations of elements:

VARIABLE, NEW, OR TEMPORARY STARS—COLORED STARS.

Observations of variable stars in 1885.—Professor Pickering prints in
the twenty-first volume of the Proceedings of the American Academy
his third annual report upon observatious of variables, giving particu-
110 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

lars of nearly two hundred stars for 1885. The work has been done by
co-operation. All who are willing to assist (a field-glass is sufficient
instrumental equipment), are requested to send accounts of their work
to the Harvard Observatory as soon as possible after the close of each
year. Professor Pickering undertakes to make photometric observa-
tions of all comparison stars needed.

Mr. Espin, the special observer of tbe Liverpool Astronomical Society,
has commenced the issue of a circular calling attention to various vari-
able stars or stars suspected of variability.

Several interesting cases of variability have been discovered by
Messrs. Chandler and Sawyer, of Cambridge. The most interesting case
is a new variable of the Algol type discovered by Mr. Chandler in the
coustellation Cygnus (R. A. 20" 48"; Decl. + 34° 14’). The range is from
7.1 magnitude to 7.8 magnitude, the whole variation taking place in
about six hours. The only doubt is in regard to the interval during
which the star remains at its normal magnitude. Mr. Chandler sus-
pects that the whole duration between two successive periods of change
will be found to be about one day, twelve hours.

Gores new variable near y' Orionis (Nova Orionis)—A mass of obser-
vatious by skillful observers has accumulated, and will repay a thor-
ough study.

It seems to be clearly established that this interesting star is a sim-
ple variable, and not one of the class to which the title “ temporary ”
can properly be applied. M. Dunér, who observed the star at inter-
als from December, 1885, to April, 1886, found (Astron. Nachr., No.
2755), on renewing his observations at the end of October and the
beginning of November, 1886, that it had unmistakably increased
in brightness in the interval, and was cuntinuing to do so. Herr
Fr. Schwab and Mr. Espin confirm this conclusion, the former having
observed the star early in last July, and having found it then fainter
than the twelfth magnitude. Its period would appear to be not far
from one year; Herr Schwab gives it as one or two weeks longer than
one year, and asranging in brightness from the sixth magnitude to 123,
whilst M. Dunér assigns a period of 359.5 days. (Nature.)

According to Dr. Vogel and others who have examined its spectrum,
it belongs to Type II] a, resembling the spectrum of a Orionis.

The new star in the great nebula of Andromeda.—Professor Seeliger
has published (Astron, Nachr., No. 2710) an interesting paper contain-
ing an attempt to represent the observed variations of the light of the
Nova in Andromeda by a formula expressing the rate of cooling of a
hotsphere. Supposing that such a body has its temperature suddenly
increased to an enormous extent by some shock, its brightness will of
course be increased also. And assuming that the latter is proportional
to the xth power of the temperature, and using Pogson’s seale for trans-
forming brightness into stellar magnitude, Professor Seeliger (making
ASTRONOMY. tl

some further more or less probable assumptions) deduces an expres-
sion for the magnitude of the cooling star at any time. In order to
compare this formula with Herr Miiller’s photometric measures of the
Nova, extending from 1885, September 2, to October 13, Professor Seel-
iger assumes that n=1, and that the epoch for which the time t=0,
is 1885, August 27,8" Berlin mean time. Using quite approximate
values of the constants involved in his formula, it appears that there is
a good general agreement (the mean discordance being 0.11 of a stellar
magnitude) between the computed and observed values. The computed
magnitude corresponding to the epoch for which t=0, is 7.73. The fair
agreement shown by this comparison induces Professor Seeliger to
think that the form of the expression which he has deduced is such as
would. accurately represent the observations, provided that it were pos-
sible to determine the necessary constants with sufficient precisicn.
And as there is evidence to show that the nebula in Andromeda is,
partly at least, composed of a vast number of faint stars, it appears, in
Professor Seeliger’s opinion, not unreasonable to suppose that a collis-
ion was the cause of the sudden development of heat and light which
revealed itself to us as the appearance of a *“‘ new” star.

With reference to the point thus raised by Professor Seeliger, Herr
Auwers points out (Astron. Nachr., No. 2715) that the great similarity of
the outburst in Andromedain 1885 to the phenomenon observed by him
in 1860 in the cluster 80 Messier in Scorpio is a strong confirmation of
Professor Seeliger’s views. The probability that two variable stars of
such exceptional character should be projected, in one case on a close
star-cluster, in the other case on an object which appears to be, in
part at least, a close star-cluster, is So small that it is almost necessary
to refer these outbursts to physical changesin the nebule in which they
respectively appeared. (Observatory, April, 1886.)

Dr. Milis (Nature 33 : 440) in criticising Professor Seeliger’s collision
hypothesis suggests that the blazing out of the Nova may be merely a
physico-chemical consequence of cooling; and it has been pointed out
by Mr. Castell-Evans (Nature, 33: 486) that practically the same expla-
nation was suggested in 1878 by Prof. R. Meldola in a paper published
in the Philosophical Magazine for July of that year. Professor Mel-
dola says: “‘ It is conceivable that in certain cases the composition of
a Star’s atmosphere may be such as to permit a considerable amount of
cooling before any combination takes place among its constituents; un-
der such circumstances a sudden catastrophe might mark the period of
combination, and a starof feeble light would blaze forth suddenly, as
occurred in 1866 to zt Corone Borealis. In other cases, again, it is
possible that the composition of a star’s atmosphere may be of such a
nature as to lead to a state of periodically unstable chemical equilib-
rium ; that is to say, during a certain period combination may be going
on with the accompanying evolution of heat, till at length dissociation
112 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

again begins to take place. In this manner the phenomena of many
variable stars may perhaps be accounted for.”

Dr. von Kévesligethy observing with a 7-inch Merz equatorial at the
observatory of Baron Podmaniezky at Kis Kartal, in Hungary, an-
nounced the re-appearance of the Nova on September 26, 1886. From
this date he found that it became more star-like, and up to the evening
of Octeber 2 both nucelus and new star were visible. From October
2 to October 17 the old nucleus was invisible. By October 23 the nu-
cleus had assumed its normal state, but the new star was not seen.
A number of telescopes were immediately turned upon the nebula, but
in the main failed to detect the changes suspected. (See Astron. Nachr.,
2750-2752.) Itis probable that the object seen was one of the very
faint points of light known to exist near the nucleus of the nebula.

A very complete series of observations of Nova Andromede is given
by Dr. Copeland, of the Dun Echt Observ aoe in the Monthly No-
tices for December, 1856.

Catalogue of colored stars.—Mr. W.S. Franks has presented to the
Royal Astronomical Society a catalogue (not printed, apparently) of
1,730 colored stars situated between the pole and —20° of declination,
and including all stars down to the 6.-5 magnitude. The introduction
to this catalogue, giving a tabular. analysis of the colors recorded, is
published in the Monthly Notices for April, 1886.

We should mention also a list of thirty-one prominent colored stars of
the southern hemisphere published by Mr. A. S. Williams in the Astro-
nomical Register for October.

Mr. Chambers stated at the meeting of the Royal Astronomical So-
ciety on March 12, 1886, that he was preparing a catalogue of red stars.

STELLAR PHOTOMETRY.

Photometric observations at Harvard College Observatory.—Professor
Pickering, in his annual report, states that 59,800 separate photometric
comparisons were made with the meridian photometer in 1886, The in-
strument has been found to give entire satisfaction both in the accuracy
and the rapidity of its work. Various tests have been applied to de-
tect the presence of systematic errors, but so far with negative results.
“A comparison of the seven hundred stars common to the observations
of Wolff, Pritchard, and the Harvard Photometry, showed that our re-
sults differed on the average from Wolff, after allowance for systematic
differences, by 0.140 of a magnitude; from Pritchard by 0.145; while
Wolff and Pritchard differed from each other by 0.192. A comparison
of the fifty five stars proposed by Professor Pritchard as standards, and
measured by him on several nights, showed that the average deviation
from the Harvard Photometry was only 0.104. - - - A comparison
between the results obtained at Pulkowaand Cambridge shows that the
average deviation of a measurement of the difference in brightness be-

tween two stars observed at both places does not exceed one-tenth of
a magnitude.”

The principal work of the meridian photometer, the revision of the
Durchmusterung magnitudes, is now approaching completion, nine-
tenths of the observations having already been made. During 1887 the
observing list will be extended to include stars in the first 20° of south
declination.

Observations of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites, comparison stars
for variables, ete., are made with the photometer attached to the 15-
inch equatorial.

A comparison of photometric methods.—Mr. 8. C. Chandler, jr., pre-
sented at the Buffalo meeting of the American Association an important
paper on ‘A comparative estimate of methods and results in stellar
photometry,” in which he reaches the conclusion (also reached by Dr.
G. Miiller, of Potsdam,—Vrtljschr. d. astron. Gesellsch., 20 : 261-267),
that the photometers now in use give no advantage, in point of accu-
racy, over direct eye-estimates of differences in magnitude made accord-
ing to Argelander’s well known method. With regard to accidental
errors, Mr. Chandler concludes that ‘‘ eye-estimates” are nearly three
times as accurate as photometric measures, and he also points out that
several variables have been detected and their periods and light-curves
well determined by careful eye-estimates, whose whole range of bright-
ness is no greater than the range of error in photometric observations.
Reference should be made to Mr. Chandler’s paper in the Astronomische
Nachrichten, vol. 115, p. 145, merely an abstract of his communication
having been published in the Proceedings of the American Associa-
tion.

A proposed new catalogue of magnitudes of southern stars.—Mr. E. F,
Sawyer, of Cambridge, has been at work since 1882 upon a determina-
tion of the relative magnitude of the stars included between the equa-
tor and 30° of south declination, and not fainter than the seventh mag-
nitude. The observations are made with an opera glass (magnifying
two and a half times) put slightly out of focus. The number of stars
comprised will approximate 3,500, and the average number of observa-
tions for each star will be about three and‘ one-half. Mr. Sawyer finds
from 593 stars, each observed twice, that the average difference between
two independent determinations of a magnitude of a star is 0.112 of a
magnitude, which corresponds to a probable error of a single observa-
tion of +0.065. It is expected that the work will be completed and
ready for publication within a year.

STELLAR SPECTRA.

Photographic study of stellar spectra at Harvard College Observatory.—
Professor Pickering has announced in his annual report an extensive
investigation in stellar spectra, by means of photography, undertaken

H. Mis. 600-—-—8
114 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

at the Harvard Observatory. Provision has been made by Mrs. Dra-
per for meeting the expenses of this work, as a memorial to her hus-
band, the late Dr. Henry Draper.

Three researches are now in progress.

The first includes a general survey of stellar spectra. Each spectrum
is photographed with an exposure of not less than five minutes, and
these photographs generally exhibit the spectra of all stars brighter
than the sixth magnitude with sufficient distinctness for measurement.
The greater portion of the sky north of —30° has been surveyed in this
work, which will be repeated during the coming year. One hundred
and fifty-one plates have been measured and 5,431 spectra examined
and classified. Of these 4,148 have been identified and the name and
position of the corresponding star entered opposite each. The com-
pleted work will form a catalogue probably containing three or four
thousand stars, each photographed on several plates.

The second research relates to a determination of the spectra of the
fainter stars. Each photograph taken in the course of this research
receives an exposure of one hour, so that the spectra of ali the stars
not fainter than the eighth or ninth magnitude, and included in a region
ten degrees square, are represented upon the plate. On fifty-eight
plates 2,416 spectra have been measured, and of these 2,359 have been
identified.

In both of these investigations the 8-inch Bache telescope has been
employed.

The third research relates to a more careful study of the spectra of
the brightest stars. For this work Mrs. Draper has lent the 11-inch
photographic lens employed by her husband. She has also furnished
an admirable mounting for the instrument and a small observatory to
contain it. Two prisms have been constructed to place in front of the
object-glass, the large one having a clear aperture of 11 inches square
and an angle of nearly 15°, the other being somewhat smaller. The
preliminary results attained with this apparatus are highly promising.

A recent photograph of the region in Cygnus where four stars were
known, exhibiting the interesting peculiarity of bright-line spectra,
brought out four more spectra of the same kind. One of these is the
comparatively bright star P Cygni, in which bright lines, apparently
due to hydrogen, are distinctly visible. This phenomenon recalls the
circumstances of the outburst of light in the star T Coron, especially
when the former history of P Cygni's considered. According to Schon-
feld, it first attracted attention as an apparently new star in 1600, and
fluctuated greatly during the seventeenth century, finally becoming a
star of the fifth magnitude, and so continuing to the present time.
Another of the stars shown by the photograph to have bright lines is
DM. + 37°, 3821, where the lines are unmistakably evident.

ASTRONOMICAL PHOTOGRAPHY.

The improvements in astronomical photography during the past two
years, following the introduction of the modern dry plates, have at-
tracted wide-spread attention, and the great merits of the new method
scarcely call for any exaggeration in order to establish photography
permanently as a means for astronomical research. We find Greenwich,
Harvard, Paris, Cape of Good Hope, and Lick taking steps to make
stellar photography a part of their routine work, and arrangements have
been made by Admiral Mouchez for holding an international conference
at Paris in April, 1887, for the purpose of elaborating a plan of co-op-
eration in photographing the whole sky. It is hoped that ten or twelve
observatories will be ready to co-operate and that all will be supplied
with instruments of the same power, so that the work will form a homo-
geneous whole. It will require 11,000 plates of 4° each to cover the sky,
and ten years will probably be necessary for the completion of the un-
dertaking. ,

Stellar photography at the Paris Observatory.—An article in Nature
(May 13, 1886), which gives a wood-cut of the apparatus used by tie
Messrs. Henry, gives also the following table of the time of exposure re-
quired (with the Monckhoven gelatino-bromide plates) to obtain stars
of different degrees of brightness:

These figures represent a minimum. To secure good reproductions
on paper the time of exposure would have to be increased threefold. A
two hours’ exposure gives stars much fainter than Herschel’s debilissima.

The Henrys have successfully photographed the clusters in Hercules,
Sobieski, Ophiuchus, and Perseus, and the major planets. They have
obtained the trail of an eleventh-magnitude asteroid—a fine line among
the stellar points. The new method seenis well adapted, also, to the
search for a trans-Neptunian planet.

The observatories at Algiers and Rio Janeiro are to be supplied with
instruments similar to those at Paris, and an equatorial coudé of 0.6
meter (24 inches) apertue provided with a photographie objective is
to be constructed for the Paris Observatory, to test the adaptability of
this form of instrument for photographie work.
116 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Stellar photography at Harvard College Observatory.—Professor Pick-
ering’s investigations, which were briefly referred to in last year’s re-
port, have been published in full in the Memoirs of the American
Academy (vol. 11, pp. 179-226). His paper contains a sketch of the
history of the subject, description of the apparatus, discussion of
theoretical considerations, and some results obtained in the three depart-
ments of “star-charting, photographing star trails, and spectrum pho-
tography.” His work on the photography of stellar spectra we have
already alluded to in the present review.

In the report of the Harvard Observatory for 1886 it is stated that
the investigation in stellar photography undertaken with the aid of
the Bache fund is now nearly completed. The principal results ob-
tained include photographs of the entire sky north of — 30°, on which
all stars bright enough to leave trails without the aid of clock-work are
depicted. One series of plates exhibits the effect of atmospheric ab-
sorption on nearly every night of observation for a year; and among the
miscellaneous observations may be mentioned some experiments in the
application of photography to transit instruments, which showed that
the accidental errors did not reach one-half of those affecting eye-
observations. Various photographs were taken of the nebula of Orion
to show the relative brightness of different portions of this object.
The nebule in Andromeda, in Lyra, and in the Pleiades were also
photographed. An attempt was made to photograph a satellite of
Jupiter while undergoing eclipse, and thus to determine the time of this
phenomenon.

Astronomical photography at the Lick Observatory.—In a very interest-
ing article upon astronomical photography, published in the Overland
Monthly for November, 1886, Professor Holden thus summarizes the
facilities of the California observatory for investigations in this field:
“We expect to have a photographic objective as large as 36 inches in
aperture, if the glass for this can be obtained. This will be mounted
in the most perfect manner, and we shall employ the 12-inch Clark
telescope, now at the observatory, as a pointing telescope for the large
objective. The 12-inch telescope will be mounted alongside the other.
An electrically-controlled driving clock will keep the two telescopes
accurately directed during the exposure. Our objective will collect nine
times the light of any other photographic telescope now made. - - -
The focal length of the combination will be about 580 inches, and 1” on
the plate will therefore be 0.002 inch. This is a quantity whose =}, part
can easily be measured. A single exposure will give us a map of the
sky comprising four square degrees on a plate 24 by 24 inches. - - -
The sun’s image unmagnified will be 6 incies in diameter; a large sun-
spet will be the size of one’s finger-nail. - - - The photographs of
the moon in the focus of the Lick equatorial will be 6 inches in diam-
eter, and will probably stand an enlargement of twelve times, so as to
be 6 feet finally.”
ASTRONOMY. Ly

Stellar photography at Cordoba.—Dr. Gould, in a paper read at the
Butfalo meeting of the American Association, has described the photo-
graphs taken at Cordoba from 1872 to 1882. About seventy southern
clusters and more than a hundred double stars were repeatedly photo-
graphed. Some sixteen plates of the Pleiades and five of Presepe
were obtained; the total number of photographs being somewhat less
than thirteen hundred. Dr. Gould lays great stress on the necessity
of promptly converting the photographs into a permanent numerical
record: and considerable uneasiness is aroused by the discovery that
the collodion or gelatine films are readily detached from the plates.
Some progress has already been made in the reductions, under Dr,
Gould’s immediate supervision at Cambridge.

Pritchard's *‘ Researches in stellar photography.”—In a paper with the
foregoing title, read at the meeting of the Royal Society, May 27, 1886,
Professor Pritchard gives an account of a number of photographs of
the Pleiades which he has submitted to a critical examination, with the
following objects in view:

(1) To ascertain, by means of definite and accurate measurement, the
relation between the diameter of a star-disk impressed on a photo-
graphic plate with a given exposure, and its photometric magnitude;
a simple formula seems to connect the two. (2) To ascertain whether
the photographic plate remains an absolutely accurate picture of the
actual relative positions of the stars in the sky itself, and, moreover,
whether these are measurable with that extreme degree of precision
which is attainable with the best instrumeutal means. The satisfactory
accordances of measures of different plates have afforded a sufficient
answer to this inquiry. (3) The third subject of investigation was the
relation between the areas of the impressed star-disks and the time of
exposure of the plates. As far as at present appears, these areas vary
as the square root of the time, though the investigation is not to be
regarded as complete. Bond, in 1858, considered that the areas varied
directly as the time.

In the course of his work Professor Pritchard noticed what appeared
to be a distortion of the photographic film on a small portion of the
plate, and he detected a somewhat similar distortion upon one of eight
plates of 61 Cygni and neighboring stars. He has hopes that in the
course of a year the parallax of certain stars will be re-determined by
photography, even to a greater degree of accuracy than has hitherto
been achieved by direct instrumental application.

Professor Harkness has suggested that great increase in the accuracy
of transit observations of the sun would be gained by inserting a sensi-
tive photographic plate just behind the wire system of theinstrument, and
making an instantaneous exposure at the time of the sun’s transit.
This would avoid the disturbance of adjustments of the instrument
arising from the exposure to the sun for several minutes, which is nec-
essary in the present mode of observing. Stars would be observed and

the instrumental constants determined by using the eye-piece in the
usual way.
COMETS.

Professor Bredichin in continuing his researches upon the mathe-
matical theory of comets has re-determined the repulsive forces which
produce the tails of different types. Making use of some forty comets in
his discussion, he has found for tails of type I, a mean value, 1— 4 = 14;
but the comet of 1811, by far the most favorable for the determination
of the repulsive force of this type, gave 17.5, and this represents quite
well the tails of other comets. In this type the initial velocity g varies
from 0.1 to 0.54, the mean being 0.23 (0.1=1.9 miles per second, about).
In type I1 the forces vary from 0.5 to 2.2, and the initial velocities from
0.03 to 0.07, mean 0.05. For the axis of the tail 1—y=1.1. In type
I the repulsive forces lie between 0.1 and 0.3, and the velocities be-
tween 0.01 and 0.02. ‘

Dr. Holetschek’s investigation upon the conditions of visibility of a
comet have been followed up by Dr. W. Meyer, who finds that if the
great comets of 1845, 1880, and 1882 had reached perihelion in May
they would have escaped unobserved. The orbit of the comet seen
during the total eclipse of May 16, 1882, must have been very much
like that of the comet which appeared four months later (1882 II) ; it
seems, indeed, that the observed position can be represented to half a
degree by the elements of the September comet, merely changing the
time of perihelion of the latter and fixing it for the 17th of May. The
ephemeris computed by Dp. Meyer with these elements shows very
plainly why the Sohag comet could not be found after the eclipse, or
had not been detected before; it was too faint when in a position favor-
able for observation. The comet is probably one of a regular stream of
comets with small perihelion distance, such as 1845 I, 1880 I, 1882 II.
If the orbits of the comets of 1845 and 1880 were sufficiently alike in
other respects, the failure in repeated returns would be no objection to
their identity, for if the returns have taken place in the month of May,
the comet must have been invisible. A revolution in thirty-seven
years is hardly to be reconciled, however, with the observations of
1843, and for the great comet of 1882 Frisby has found a period of
seven hundred and ninety-four years.

Mr. Monck, in the Observatory for August and September, brings
out some interesting statistics in support of his view that there exists
a sort of “‘companionship ” among comets—that is, cases in which the
elements show a striking similarity; but it is improbable that the
bodies are identical. Several of the comets of short period exhibit a
family likeness which can hardly be attributed to their capture by
Jupiter unless they previously formed members of a system. The ques-
tion derives further interest from its bearing upon meteoric showers,
for, if a family of comets can be supposed to be accompanied by a
ASTRONOMY. 119

family of meteors, a shower from nearly the same point might continue
for a considerable time, giving rise to stationary radiants to which Mr.
Denning has called attention.

It may not be out of place here to point out the value of physical
observations of cometary phenomena—accurate observations of jets,
tails, brightness, ete.—which may furnish data for testing any theories
of their origin and constitution that may be put forward.

Encke’s comet.—The progress of investigations upon Encke’s comet
may be briefly stated thus: The comet which has now been observed at
twenty-four apparitions since its first discovery in 1786 ‘‘ was shown
by Encke to be subject to a remarkable decrease in the length of its
period, a decrease which could not be accounted for by the attract-
ive force of the sun and planets. Encke surmised that this was pro-
duced by the effects of a resisting medium. His calculations, which
extended up to 1848, were continued by von Asten, who in a great
measure confirmed Encke’s conclusions, but found the curious anomaly
that between the apparitions of 1865 and 1871, the acceleration of the
mean motion which had been exhibited until the former of these years
ceased to appear. Since the death of von Asten the work has been con-
tinued by Dr. Backlund, who has succeeded in showing that the appar-
ent anomaly in question was due to an error in the formule of pertur-
bations employed, and vanished when this was corrected. He was led
however to the remarkable and interesting result that the acceleration
of the mean motion of the comet is subject to a progressive diminution,
and amounted between 1871 and 1885 to scarcely one-half of what it
was between 1819 and 1865.” It was reduced from 0/.104 to 0.062.
It seems very probable that about the year 1868 the acceleration under-
went a change, due no doubt to some unknown modification in the
physical condition of the comet.

Dr. Backlund has recently resumed his labors, which were inter-
rupted by illness, and the first memoir, relating to the return in 1885,
has just been printed; the second, treating of the comet’s motion since
1865, will soon be presented to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences;
while the third, which is in preparation, will comprise the period 1819-
1868. For these researches the author has been awarded the Lalande
prize of the Paris Academy.

Comet Tempel-Swift.—Bossert has given in the Bulletin astronomique
an elaborate discussion of the orbit of the comet discovered by Tempel
in 4869, but not recognized as periodic till its rediscovery by Swift in
1880. The period is about five and one-half years, but the comet es-
caped notice in 1875 and again in 1856.

Comet 1873 VII.—M. Schulhof has published (Bull. astron., 3: 125 et
Seq.) a discussion of the orbit of this comet, and has gone into the ques-
tion of its possible identity with 1818 I and 1457 I (the observations of
which by Toscanelli have recently been discussed by Professor Celoria).
120 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

His conclusion, expressed with some reserve, is that 1873 VII and 1818 [
are distinct bodies, with a short period of revolution but having a com-
mon origin. Comet 1457 Lis probably identical with 1873 VII, but it is
also possible that the two comets 1873 VII and 1818 I are fragments of
1457 I.

Comet 1877 V1.—Dr. Larssén, of Upsala, has completed the definitive
determination of parabolic elements of the comet discovered by Coggia
at Marseilles on September 14, 1877, and observed to December 10 of
that year. The observations have been newly reduced and combined
in five normal places, with a very satisfactory result. (Astron. Nachr.
116 : 23-26.)

Comet 1881 V.—The close agreement of the elements with those of the
orbit of a comet discovered by Blanpain on the 28th of November, 1819,
has led to a conjecture that the two comets are identical, although Blan-
pain’s was computed to have a period of less than five years and Den-
ning’s of nearly nine, it being supposed that planetary perturbation
had lengthened the period between the appearance of 1819 and that of
1881. It has been noticed both by Mr. Plummer and by Mr. Denning
that the longitude of the ascending node of the 1881 comet corresponds
almost exactly with that of the descending node of Biela’s comet, which
has not been seen as a comet (or rather double comet) since 1852, though
it has been supposed to be connected with a very brilliant meteoric dis-
play seen on the 27th of November, 1872. The other elements of Den-
ning’s comet exhibit a remarkable agreement with those of Biela’s
comet; and the suggestion in question is that these comets are identi-
cal, or rather that Denning’s is identical witb the principal remaining
portion of Biela’s, which underwent violent perturbation through near
approach to the earth in 1872, sufficient to lengthen its period and
reverse the nodes (a necessary consequence of altering the inclina-
tion through zero). Colonel Tupman, whose calculations well confirm
this theory, remarks “that on the 27th of November, 1872, it is prob-
able that the comet was very near the earth and mixed up with the
meteoric shower.” The comet passed its perihelion on the 13th of Sep-
tember, 1881; the computed length of its period was 8.83 years, or about
3,225 days; and this was almost exactly the interval which had elapsed
since the meteoric display of the 27th of November, 1872. If this theory
be true, we can not expect another similarly brilliant display on that
day until the year 1916, five periods of the comet’s revolution in its or-
bit being very nearly equal to forty-four of the earth’s. (Athenzeum.)

Comet 1881 VIII.—Olsson finds a period of 612 years; that found by
Oppenheim was 2,740 years, though Oppenheim remarks that 900 years
would satisfy the observations almost as well.

Comet 1882 II.—The valuable series of observations of this comet
made at the Cape of Good Hope, including the remarkable observation
of the disappearance of the comet at the limb of the sun, has been pub-
lished as vol. 11, part 1, of the Annals of the Cape Observatory. Inter-
ASTRONOMY. ; A boa

esting observations of the tail, accompanied by numerous sketches, are
found in vol. 1 of the Publications of the McCormick Observatory, the
observers being Messrs. Leavenworth and Jones.

Comets of 1886.—Nine comets passed perihelion in 1886; three of them
visible to the naked eye. One was a well-known periodic comet return:
ing at the appointed time, and two of the new-comers appear to be
periodic, one of them identical possibly with De Vico’s lost comet of
1844. Olbers’s comet of 1815 was not detected, but as an uncertainty of
some three years exists in the period of revolution, it may be picked up
during the coming year. The Tempel-Swift comet due at perihelion on
May 9 seems to have escaped notice on account of its excessive faint-
ness. Of these nine comets, three belong to Barnard, three to Brooks,
two were found by Finlay, and one by Fabry; two were discovered in
1885, one in 1887; leaving six discovered in 1886. Comet 1886 IX was
picked up by three observers independently, on three successive morn-
ings in October, showing what a careful watch is kept by comet-hunt-
ers. Warner prizes to the amount of $800 were paid for the captures.
Comet 1886 I: | This comet, as noted in last year’s report, was dis-

=Comet d1835. | covered on December 1, 1885, at Paris. From a

=Fabry’s comet. faint little patch of nebulosity it grew steadily in
size and brightness, and on March 29, 1886, Fabry described it as hav-
ing a diffused nucieus about 15” in diameter, comparable with a star of
the seventh magnitude; a tail about 20’ long and 4’ broad, was thrust
out in a position angle of 325°, while the nebulosity extended about 1’. 5
beyond the head. It became rapidly more prominent, and on April 3
was visible without difficulty to the naked eye. On April 23 the head
was as bright as a third-magnitude star, and the tail 4° long. The
greatest length of the tail was probably about 9°, but the comet was not
aw very conspicuous object on account of its slight elevation above the
horizon before sunrise, ayd also on account of the moon-light. Itis said
to have remained visible to the naked eye from the early part of April
to beyond the middle of May. Observations were continued in the
southern hemisphere until about the end of July.

The determination of the orbit presented some difficulties, and the
elements from early observations were not entirely accordant. Dr. S.
Oppenheim’s elements (Astron. Nachr., 2722), derived from observa-
tions extending to March 28, placed perihelion passage on April 5, 1886;
the nearest point to the earth and greatest brilliancy (about four hun-
dred and seventy-five times as bright as when discovered) were reached
about May 1.

The spectrum was studied by Trépied, Perrotin, Rayet, Vogel, and
others. The three bands common to comets and hydrocarbons were
found—the central band, perhaps, somewhat intensified ; and besides
these bands there was also a continuous spectrum.

Dr. Muller, of Potsdam, has published in the Nachrichten (No. 2733)

ea RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

a very interesting series of photometric observations of this comet and
of the comet discovered by Barnard on December, 18385. ‘ The observa-
tions extended over the months of March and April, 1886; and both
comets were increasing in brightness. Reducing the measures to a dis-
tance unity, the intrinsic brilliancy seems to have been tolerably con-
stant; from which it may be concluded that the comets shone almost en-
tirely with borrowed light. This conclusion is confirmed by Dr. Miiller’s
spectroscopic observations, according to which the continuous spectrum
predominates. Trépied, on the other hand, found thatin Fabry’s comet
the proportion of reflected sunlight was small, gaseous elements pre-
dominating and the bands being much brighter than the continuous
spectrum. Dr. Miiller remarks that his observations show no effect of
phase, and he suggests that this may be due to a variation in the in-
herent light of the comet as it approaches the sun and earth, or we may
assume that the nucleus is made up of discrete particles by which the
phase phenomena must to a great extent be modified.

Comet 1886 IT: A brief account of this eomet was given last year,
=Comet e 1885. as it was discovered by Barnard on December 3,
=Barnard’s comet. | 1885, with a 6-inch Cooke equatorial. A small tail

about 15’ long was detected by Tempel as early as December 31. In

April and May the comet developed into quite a fine object with stellar

nucleus and fan-shaped tail, 2° or 3° in length. It was seen with the

naked eye on May 7 and 12 by Mr. Barnard, at Nashville, and on May

31 and June 3 by Mr. Tebbutt, at Windsor, New South Wales. The

last observation published was made on July 19, at Cordoba. <A care.

ful series of ‘extinction observations” is given by Dr. Holetschek in

the Nachrichten, No. 2739. The spectroscope showed the three ordi-

nary cometary bands, with faint, continuous spectrum of the nucleus.
The latest elements computed by Thraen from observations between

December 5, 1885, and May 10, 1886, place perihelion passage on May

3, and give aslightly hyperbolic orbit (eccentricity =1.0004). Whether

the curve really differs from a parabola can not be decide] until all the

observations, including those from southern observatories, can be taken
into account. Morrison has obtained hyperbolic elements agreeing
tolerably well with those of Thraen. Earlier elements showed a slight
resemblance to comet 1785 11, but it is not probable that the comets are

identical. .

Comet 1886 III: | This was discovered by Mr. W. R. Brooks,
—Comet b 1886. | at Phelps, New York, on April 30, 1886, or
=Comet 1886..-.(Brooks 2). | in civil reckoning on the morning of May

1; his second comet within four days. Mr. Brooks described it as hav-

ing a small but bright and star-like head, and a conspicuous tail. On

May 4 there was a tail 10’ or 12’ long; very bright near the origin.

Engelhardt, on May 6, found the tail 40’ long and nearly straight, while

8’ from the nucleus there was a faint secondary tail bending towards

the south. Pechiile, observing from May 3 to May 12, detected two

nuclei or condensations in the head. Barnard says it was a most sin-
gular looking telescopic comet—‘ a perfect miniature of the naked-eye
appearance of a great comet.” It does not seem to have been observed
beyond the last week of May, when its theoretical brightness was about
half that at the time of discovery.

According to Wendell’s elements the comet passed perihelion on May
5. Dr. Weiss called attention to the fact that at the ascending node
the orbit approached quite near the orbit of the earth, so that when the
earth passed the line of nodes, July 9, a meteoric shower visible in the
southern hemisphere might result from particles following in the wake
of the comet. We believe, however, that no unusual display was re-

ported.

orbit with a period of about nine years. Dr. Hind makes the period
very much shorter, not much more, in fact, than six and a quarter years,
according to which the comet would return in the autumn of 1892. The
perihelion passage took place on June 6 or 7. A new discussion of the
orbit has been undertaken by Drs. Oppenheim and Bidschof, of Vienna.

was of the eighth magnitude, and May 21 and 25, sixth to seventh mag-
nitude with nearly circular coma 2’ 20’ in diameter. Dr. Krueger's ele-
ments show that the comet’s nearest approach to the sun, 0.27 (the

ion was passed on August 19, about twelve days earlier than predicted
by Dr. A. Palisa. An attempt was made at Paris to photograph the

in diameter, with some central condensation, and no tail.” The pos-
sible identity with ‘De Vico’s lost comet,” 1844 I, (for which Briin-
now found a period of 5.5 years), immediately attracted attention, and
elliptic elements have been calculated by Boss, Krueger, Oppenheim,
and Holetschek. The computation of the orbit presents some difficul-
ties, and it is impossible to settle the question of identity until all ob-
servations at this return have received a thorough discussion—if it can
be settled then. The last set of elements obtained by Professor Boss
(Asiron. Journ., v. 3, p. 43) place perihelion passage on November 22,
1886, and give an approximate period of 6.675 years. With tuis period
the comet, if undisturbed, should return to the sun in July, 1893, under
conditions quite favorable for observation. It is still visible, nearly
five months after discovery.

was an easy object in the telescope, and developed a tail early in

October. By October 29 the nucleus was as bright as a star of the

eighth magnitude, and the comet was visible to the naked eye as an ill-

defined spot. Two distinct tails were detected about this time, and

Barnard found a third on November 23. The comet was now easily

seen with the naked eye, as conspicuous as a star of the fourth magni-

tude, with a slender train traceable for 7° or 8°. The tail seems to
have reached a maximum length of about 10° during the first week of

December, the theoretical brightness of the comet being then about

twenty-five times that at discovery.

Ricco, of Palermo, found the spectrum composed of the three hydro-
carbon bands, of which the middle one (green) was longest and bright-
est. The spectrum of the nucleus was continuous, but re-enforced at
the bright bands.

Elements computed by Lieutenant Allen from observations reaching
to December 10 show that perihelion was passed on December 16, 1886.

METEORS AND THE ZODIACAL LIGHT.
a

The Biela meteors of November 27, 1885.—Professor Newton has col-
lected all the published data in regard to this great shower, and has
submitted it to a thorough discussion in an article of nearly twenty
pages of the American Journal of Science for June, 1886.

We quote merely his summary statement of conclusions :

1, The maximum of the shower was near 6 15" Greenwich mean time.

‘©2. Three hours after the maximum the number of meteors had dimin-
ished to one-tenth the maximum number, and it is not unreasonable to
assume six hours as containing the principal part of the shower.

‘3. The total hourly number of meteors visible at one place in a very
clear sky to some one or other of a very large group of observers may
at maximum be regarded as 75,000.

‘4, In the densest part of the meteor stream, where and when the
earth encountered it, the space that corresponded to each meteoroid
was equal to a cube whose edge was about 20 English miles.

‘‘5, The dense part of the stream was not over 100,000 miles in thick-
ness.

“6, The zenithal attraction of the Biela meteors was about one-tenth
of the observed zenith distance of the radiant.

“7, The radiant was an area several degrees across.

“8, It is reasonable to suppose that the meteoroids, while in the upper
part of the atmosphere, before the paths become luminous, change di-
rection by a glancing due to irregularity of form. After the resistance
has developed heat enough to melt or burn off projecting angles of the
stones, and the tracks become luminous, the forms of the bodies become
rounded in front and the paths described are straight lines.

“9. The meteoroids encountered by the earth on the 27th of Novem-
ber, in 1872 and in 1885, did not leave the immediate neighborhood of
the Biela comet earlier than 1841-45, and may be treated as having at
that time orbits osculating that of the comet. The determination of the
paths of these meteoroids through their five and seven last revolutions
about the sun seems to be a problem capable of complete solution.”

Professor Newton’s presidential address at the Buffalo meeting of the
American Association, on “ Meteorites, meteors, and shooting stars,”
has been published in Science (8 : 169-76), and in Nature (34 : 532-36).

M. P. F. Denza reports that a careful watch maintained on the night
of November 27, 1886, at seven observatories on the Italian peninsula,
showed no repetition of the great shower of 1885. This would indicate
that the stream is of small extent but very dense, and would tend to
strengthen the hypothesis that it originated in the recent disintegra-
tion of Biela’s comet. »

Herr Forster finds for the radiant points of the great meteor showers
of 1872 and 18°35:

1872 R. A. 23°.3 Decl. + 43°.8.
1885 239.5 + 43°.3.
126 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

A recent bulletin of the New Eugland Meteorological Society gives
a discussion, b¥ Professor Newton, of a meteor seen on September 6,
1886, height, time and place of appearance and disappearance, ete. It
is desired that observers should report the position of bright meteors,
noting their paths among the stars, and trails, if any, with as much
accuracy and detail as possible.

Mr. Denning publishes in the Monthly Notices for November some
interesting results he has obtained from the study of a catalogue of
more than 82,000 meteors from 3,035 radiants. Mr. Denning himself
contributes to his catalogue no less than 7,000 meteors. He also, in
another place, calls attention to the marked agreement between the
orbit of Halley’s comet and a pronounced meteor shower with radiant
close to y Aquarii. The maximum shower occurs about May 6. This
radiant needs further observation.

Relation of the zodiacal light to Jupiter.—Dr. Geelmuyden, speaking
of Professor Searle’s researches upon the zodiacal light, says: “If the
zodiacal matter has the same position among meteoric matter in general
as comets of short period among comets, it is to be expected that the
fundamental plane of the zodiacal light will have some relation to Jupi-
ter as the principal motor in deflecting the orbits, and therefore in col-
lecting the matter. Now it is worth remarking that the most north-
erly point of Jupiter’s orbit has the heliocentric longitude 188°, or with
60° east elongation 178° geocentric longitude; and for matter in the
same plane, but nearer the sun, the approximation to coincidence with
160° is still greater.”

THE SUN.

Motion of the solar system in space.—Several attempts have lately been
made to obtain the direction and rate of motion of the solar system in
space. These results are discordant among themselves, and, as the in-
vestigators have remarked, are not entitled to very great weight, on
account of the meagerness of the data available, but it may not be with-
out interest to give the values obtained.

Herr Homann, from a discussion of the spectroscopic observations
made at Greenwich, and from the observations of Huggin and Sea-
broke, finds:

ASTRONOMY. 127

There is only a rough sort of agreement, but all three unite in
placing the apex considerably in advance, in right ascension, of the
apex as found from the proper motions of stars by Struve, Airy, Dun-
kin, and others (the mean position generally assigned is, R. A. 260°;
Decl. +35°), while Struve found a velocity of translation of only
about 44 miles per second.

Herr Homann is inclined to think that the velocity of translation of
the sun does not differ very much from the velocity of the earth in its
orbit, that is, 184 miles per second. Dr. von Koévesligethy in 1883 found
from spectroscopic observations that the rate of motion of the solar
system was 8.6 geographical miles per second. The spectroscopic ob-
servations were insufficient to determine the direction, and he assumed
the apex in R. A. 2169.0, Deel. +35°.1.

Dr. Ubaghs, of Liege, in making a preliminary examination of the
aberration due to the motion of the solar system, pointed out by M.
Folie, has obstained a result which would give a velocity of only about
180 feet per second.

The velocity of light and the solar parallax.—Professor Newcomb has
published in vol. 2 of the ** Astronomical papers prepared for the use
of the American Ephemeris” the details of his researches on the velocity
of light, made during the summer months of 1880, 1881, and 1882. The
apparatus used, to which the name “ photo-tachometer” has been given,
is a modified form of Foucault’s revolving mirror. The result obtained
for the velocity of light in vacuo is 299,860 kilometers, or 186,327 miles
per second, with a probable error of 50 kilometers. Michelson found
in 1879 a velocit:7 of 299,910 kilometers, and repeating his work at Cleve-
land in 1882, he obtained 299,853. Accepting the value 299,860 as the
true one, it becomes of interest to consider the value thereby deducible
for the parallax and distance of thesun. The latest and probably the
most accurate determination of the constant of aberration is that of
Dr. Nyrén, 20.492. Combining this with the above velocity of light and
Clarke’s value of the earth’s equatorial radius (6,378.2 kilometers), we
obtain 8.794 for the value of the solar parallax, almost exactly the same
as that obtained from heliometer observations of Mars in 1877. The cor-
responding distance of the sun is 92,960,000 miles.

With regard to a possible difference between the velocities of rays of
different colors, it is pointed out that the phenomena of variable stars
seem to be conclusive-against the hypothesis of any such difference.
Were there a difference of one hour in the times of the blue and the red
rays reaching us from Algol, this star would show a well-marked color-
ation in its phases of increase and decrease. No such effect, however,
has been noticed. Recent researches by Professors Michelson and Mor-
ley have led to a similar result.

Transit of Venus Commission is being rapidly carried to completion

under the immediate supervision of Prof. William Harkness. The re-
ductions of observations made at the various stations for time, latitude
and longitude are finished, the determination of longitudes having re-
quired a thorough examination of all the great chains of telegraphic
longitude. A volume containing all of the observations for 1874—all of
the 1874 work except the discussion of the photographs—is now in press.

Dr. Auwers reports, under date of January 11, 1886, that the reduc-
tions of the German heliometer measures are well advanced and that
the printing has been begun; and M. Bouquet de la Grye announces
for the French commission that the photographic plates, 1,019 in num-
ber, have been measured, and that the reductions are now half done,
and will be finished about the end of 1887.

Theory of sun-spots.—Professor Young, in an article on “ Recent ad-
vances in solar astronomy,” makes the following comments upon an
important paper by M. Belopolsky, of the Moscow Observatory. pub-
lished in the Astronomische Nachrichten, No. 2722:

‘Some recent investigations upon the rotation of fluid masses, by
Jukowsky, of Moscow, as applied to solar conditions by his colleague Bel-
opolsky, seem to warrant a hope that the phenomena of surface-drift in
longitude, and even the periodicity of the spots, may soon find a ra-
tional explanation as necessary results of the slow contraction of a non-
homogeneous and mainly gaseous globe. The subject is difficult and
obscure; but if it can be proved, as seems likely, that on mechanical
principles, the time of rotation of the central portions of such a whirl-
ing mass must be shorter than that of the exterior, then there will be
of necessity an interchange of matter between the inside and outside of
the sphere, a slow surface-drift from equator toward the poles, a more
rapid internal current along and near the axis from the poles toward
the equator, a continual ‘ boiling up’ of internal matter on each side of
the equator, and, finally, just such an eastward drift near the equator as
is actually observed. Moreover, the form of the mass, and the intensity
of the drift and consequent ‘boiling-up’ from underneath might and
probably would be subject to great periodic variations.

‘This theory falls in well with the facts established by Spoerer
respecting the motion of the sun-spot zones, and the general though
slow poleward movement of sun-spots.”

Sun-spot observations at Kaloesa.—A summary (Astron. Nachr., 116:
31) of sun-spot observations at Kaloesa, 1880-1885, shows the predom-
inance of spots in the southern hemisphere of the sun over those in the
northern hemisphere, particularly well marked, since the beginning of
1883. <A similarresult is shown in the Greenwich observations, and has
also been pointed out by Dr. Spoerer; on the other hand, from 1880 to
1883 the northern hemisphere had the greater number of spots. It has
been noticed, furthermore, that since 1880 the spots show a tendency
towards the equatorial zones.
ASTRONOMY. 129

Observation of sun-spot spectra.—Professor Young mentions a some-
what curious observation of sun-spot spectra, which he has recently
made. He finds that under high dispersion the spectrum of the darkest
part of the spot is not continuous, but is made up of countless fine,
dark lines, for the most part touching or slightly overlapping, but leay-
ing here and there unoccupied intervals which look like (and may be)
bright lines. ‘‘It seems to indicate that the principal absorption which
darkens the center of the sun-spot is not such as would be caused by
minute solid or liquid particles—by smoke or cloud, which would give
a continuous spectrum ; but itis a true gaseous absorption, producing
a veritable dark-line spectrum, in which the lines are countless and con-
tiguous.”

Solar activity in 1886.—According to Professor Tacchini’s observa-
tions (Comptes Rendus, 103: 120; 104: 216), it appears that there was a
decided falling off in the number and size of sun-spots during the year
1886. In March, however, there was a considerable temporary increase }
and on the 8th of May a magnificent group of spots was visible in the
sun’s northern latitude. A well-marked minimum occurred in November,
and rather peculiar ‘‘secondary minima” seem to have fallen in the
months of February, May, and August. Prominences also showed a
diminution in number and size compared with those seen in 1885, but
the fluctuations were much fewer than in the case of the spots. <A par-
ticularly remarkable eruption was observed on March 9 and 10.

Professor Tacchini places the last great minimum of spots in March,
1879, and the last maximum in February, 1884; if then the decrease
in the number of spots during the latter part of 1886 corresponds to a
new minimum, we shall have an interval from the last maximum of
only 2.8 years, whereas the mean interval is Seven years. So short an
interval between maximum and minimum is very exceptional, for the
shortest known since 1750 is 4.3 years; the longest is ten years.

Lotal eclipse of the sun, August 28-29, 1886.—A party consisting of
Lockyer, Tacchini, Schuster, Maunder, Perry, and others, was sent out
by the British Government to the island of Grenada, in the West Indies,
to observe the total eclipse of August 28-29, 1886. A full review of
the results of the expedition can not be given until the detailed report
is ready. Preliminary accounts show that only one division of the
party, that with Mr. Lockyer at Green Island, failed entirely on ac-
count of clouds, though the observations at some of the other stations
were more or less interfered with. Photometric observations and pho-
tographs of the corona and of its spectrum were obtained, and also
good spectra of the prominences, showing the bright lines of highly
incandescent vapors. In this respect the result resembles that obtained
in the two previous eclipses, though it was thought possible that this
year, being one when sun-spots were tending to a minimum, would be
marked by the more continuous spectrum that bespeaks lower tempera-

ture.

130 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 18886.

Prof. W. H. Pickering, of Boston, observing from Fort Green, ob-
tained a number of photographs and some interesting photometric
observations. He also organized aseries of observations of the shadow
bands.

Observations of the partial phase were made at the Azores, Mar-
tinique, Port au Prince, and at several points along the eastern coast
of the United States. No parties were sent out by the United States
Government.

Photography of the solar corona.—Dr. Huggins’s method of photograph-
ing the corona in full sunshine seems to have failed when submitted to
a crucial test in the eclipse of last August. In a letter to Science,
dated September 11, 1886, Dr. Huggins says: “The partial phases of
this eclipse furnished conditions which would put the success of the
method beyond doubt if the plates showed the corona cut off partially
by the moon during its approach to and passage over the sun. As the
telegrams received from Grenada, and a telegram I have received this
day from Dr. Gill, at the Cape of Good Hope, state this partial cutting
off of the corona by the moon is not shown upon the plates, I wish to
be the first to make known this untoward result. I regret greatly that
a method which seemed to promise so much new knowledge of the
corona, which, under ordinary circumstances of observation, shows it-
self only during total eclipses, would seem to have failed. At the same
time I am not able to offer any sufficient explanation of the early favor-
able results.”

Mr. Common thinks it probable that this failure to get a picture of
the moon projected on the corena was due entirely to the state of the
sky ; and Professor Langley, in a recent letter to Nature (35: 53), adds
his testimony as to the great effect of atmospheric diffusion upon the
visibility of the corona. Moreover, Dr. Huggins says that he has not
himself been able to obtain any satisfactory results since 1883, and
that the plates taken by Mr. Ray Woods in 1884, in Switzerland, are
inconclusive. The failure may be due to the abnormally large amount
of air-glare from finely divided matter of some sort which has been
present in the higher regions of the atmosphere since the autumn of
1883. :

It is interesting to note that Professor Wright, of New Haven, in ex-
perimenting upon the visibility of the corona, succeeded in obtaining
what he believed to be a coronal image upon a screen, when he, too,
was brought to a standstill by these same “white skies” and “ red
sunsets.” Professor Wright’s method was to admit the sun’s rays re-
flected from a heliostat, into a darkened room, and to cut out all but
the blue and violet rays by a suitable absorbing cell, and then to form
an image of the sun and its surroundings upon a sensitive fluorescent
screen, stopping out the sun’s disk itself.

Professor Young seems to have some slight hope of ultimate success
of these efforts to reach the corona without an eclipse,
ASTRONOMY. 131

Langley’s observations of hitherto unrecognized wave-lengths.—Profes-
sor Langley having traced the solar spectrum in the infra-red as far as
wave-length =0.0027 of a millimeter, where it suddenly ceased, has
since, with more delicate instruments, examined the emission spectra
of various terrestrial substances at temperatures from that of fusing
platinum to that of melting ice, and more particularly of temperatures
corresponding to the ordinary conditions of the soil. The result has
been to show that the maximum of heat from cold and black bodies has
in every case a wave-length greater than 0.0027—greater, that is to say,
than that of the lowest solar heat which reaches us. Professor Lang-
ley thus sums up (Am. J. Se., 132: 84-106) his investigation: “ Broadly
speaking, we have learned through the present measures with certainty
of wave-lengths greater than 0.005 millimeter, and have grounds for es-
timating that we have recognized radiations whose wave-length ex-
ceeds 0.03 millimeter, so that while we have directly measured to nearly
eight times the wave-length known to Newton, we have probable indica-
tion of wave-lengths far greater, and the gulf between the shortest vi-
bration of sound and the longest known vibration of the «ther is now
in some measure bridged over.”

The visual solar spectrum in 1884.—Professor Piazzi Smyth made a
careful map of the solar spectrum in 1884 in order to determine whether
any perceptible effect had been produced by the “ white skies” so prev-
alent in that year. His observations have lately been published in a
series of sixty plates, in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edin-
burgh, vol. 32. He finds that the red and violet ends of the spectrum
show a marked general dulling, such as should arise from the upper
air being laden with minute opaque particles—whether from the Kra-
katoa explosion or any other source.

Lhollon’s map of the solar spectrum.—M. Thollon, in the Bulletin as-
tronomique for July, gives some interesting details in regard to the
great map of the spectrum for which the Lalande prize of the Paris
Academy was awarded him about a year ago. An earlier map from A
to H was finished by Thollon in 1879, but he determined to go over
the work again with improved instruments, and to make a chart
representing, with all the accuracy attainable, the positions, breadths,
and relative intensities of the lines, a chart which will enable us to
determine in the future whether any changes have taken place. For
even now, from the comparison of M. Thollon’s chart with that of Angs-
trém, there is a strong suspicion that some change has occurred in the
intensity of several lines between B and C.

M. Thollon has carried the map from A to b, and it is to be continued
to the violet by M. Trépied. It is now more than 33 feet long (though
it covers little more than one-third of the spectrum), and contains
about 3,200 lines, nearly 900 of which are distinguished as of telluric
origin. The instrument employed was a large spectroscope with bi-
132 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

sulphide of carbon prism, kept at an even temperature by running
water. The measures were made with a fine glass pointer.

Cornws device for distinguishing the telluric lines in the solar spec-
trum.—At the meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society, cn June 11,
1886, M. Cornu gave a description of an ingenious method he has de-
vised for distinguishing between those lines of the solar spectrum which
are atmospheric and those which are due to solar absorption. The east
and west equatorial limbs of the sun are alternately thrown on the slit
of the spectroscope by means of an oscillating mirror. As one limb of
the sun is approaching us and the other receding, there is a real differ-
ence of wave-length in the same radiation as obtained from the two
limbs, and consequently the solar lines appear to oscillate while the
atmospheric lines remain perfectly stationary. “It is as if you shook
the spectrum; and if a line were a solar one it moved, if a terrestrial
one it remained steady.”

The absorption spectrum of oxygen.—About three years ago M. Egoroff
was able to show that the great groups A and B in the solar spectrum
were due to the absorption of oxygen. More recently the a band was
also found to be due to the same gas. M. Janssen, studying the ab-
sorption of oxygen, has now discovered that, under certain conditions,
the gas yields another spectrum, composed no longer of lines easily
separated, but of shaded bands, which can only be resolved with great
difficulty. This system of bands appears for moderate pressures much
later than the spectrum of lines, but it shows itself very quickly with in-
crease of the density; the two systems are so different that it is possible
to obtain either the first without the second, or vice versa. M. Janssen
was at first unable to explain how it was that these bands were not
visible in the solar spectrum when they were easily obtained by passing
light through thicknesses of oxygen far less than the sun’s light has to
traverse before reaching us. But further experiments showed that
these bands did not develop in proportion to the thickness of the stratum
of oxygen producing them, multiplied by its density, but in proportion
to the thickness multiplied by the square of the density. The density
of our atmosphere being small as compared with some of the pressures
at which M. Janssen worked, the non-appearance of these bands amongst
the telluric lines of the solar spectrum is readily explained.

M. Janssen is continuing his experiments at Meudon, and is building
tubes which can be loaded with 1,000 atmospheres of hydrogen, oxy-
gen, or carbonic acid. In this last case the real density of the gas will
be superior to the density of water. (Nature.)

For a thorough and authoritative review of recent advances in our
knowledge of the sun the reader should consult Professor Young’s ar-
ticle which appeared in the Popular Science Monthly for November,
1886 (30: 24-33), and also his “Ten Years’ Progress in Astronomy,” in
vol. 5 of the Transactions of the New York Academy of Sciences.

THE PLANETS.

Mercury: The mass of Mercury.—Dr. Backlund has published in the
Bulletin astronomique for October a new mass of Mercury, obtained in-
cidentally in his eiecasion of the motion of Encke’s comet. The new
result in question is 5,¢4705, the sun’s mass being unity, and this is the
largest value of the mass of the planet yet obtained. Dr. Backlund
states that, even supposing the acceleration of the comet’s mean motion
to have been constant during the entire period, 1871-85, it is not pos-
sible to represent satisfactorily the five apparitions of the comet gure
that period on the assumption of a mass of Mercury less than z554505.

VENUS: Semi-diameter of Venus.—Mr. Thackeray, discussing the ob-
servations of Venus made at Greenwich from 1866 to 1884, finds that
the amount of personality in the measures is much greater than the cor-
rection due to the instrument, and that, though a greater number of
observers by compensating one another might give increased accu-
racy to the value of the semi-diameter, it is just as likely that they
should not.

THE EARTH: Geodetic Congress.—We learn from Nature that the In-
ternatioral Geodetic Conference met at Berlin in October, 1886, to settle
the organization of the central geodetic bureau (which is to have its per-
manent seat at Berlin), and to determine upon the best method of exe-
cuting the resolutions passed at Rome and Washington in 1883 and
1884, respecting the actual measurement of a degree on the earth’s sur-
face. The adoption of Greenwich as a first meridian is to be strictly en-
forced, but the introduction of international normal time is postponed
on account of insuperable practical difficulties.

The proposed change in the beginning of the astronomical deny —Itis to
be regretted that no agreement has yet been reached by astronomers
upon the proposition to change the beginning of the astronomical day
from noon to midnight.

The general sentiment is opposed to making any change until it is
clear that it will be adopted by a majority of astronomers, and until the
proper modifications have been introduced into our principal ephemeri-
des. The new day has been provisionally adopted by Mr. Christie, at
Greenwich, and the board of visitors have recommended that it be in-
troduced into the Nautical Almanac for 1891. On the other hand, the
superintendents of the German and American ephemerides oppose any
change; and there seems to be great danger that the agitation of the
question by the Washington Meridian Conference in 1884 may introduce
new confusion rather than remove the old. At present there is little
prospect of the plan meeting with anything like a general acceptance
before the beginning of the next century.

Theory of the moon’s motion.—Several valuable papers upon the lunar
theory have been published by Hill and others. Reference should be
made to the papers themselves, cited in our Bibliography.

134 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Mr. Hill has received the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical
Society for his laborious and masterly researches upon this difficult
subject.

An interesting historical note ou the inequalities of the motion of the
moon which depends on the figure of the earth, is given by Professor
Hall in the Annals of Mathematies, vol. 2, No. 5.

Mars: The ‘‘ canals” of Mars.—M. Perrotin and his colleagues at
Nice succeeded in recovering many of Schiaparelli’s enigmatical “‘ canals”
at the last opposition of Mars, although the planet was seen under very
unfavorable conditions. Its apparent diameter at this opposition was
only 14”, against 25’ at the opposition of 1877, when the canals were
discovered. The canals were made out by several observers at Nice,
and were recognized as having the same general outline and position
attributed to them by Schiaparelli in 1882. They seem, therefore, to be
essentially permanent, forming a sort of network of grayish lines pro-
jected against the brighter equatorial regions of the planet. Compared
with the thickness of the spider lines of the micrometer, the finest of
these lines appear to have a width which corresponds to an are of 2°
or 3° on the surface of Mars. Some of them measure from 50° to 60°
in length, and several are double, composed of lines strictly parallel,
separated, according to Schiaparelli’s estimate, by intervals of from 6°
to 12°. All of this speaks well for the purity of the atmosphere at
Nice, the excellence of the 15-inch Henry refractor, and the keenness
of the observers.

During the study of the planet (from the end of March to the middle
of June) some change seemed to be taking place near Kaiser Sea. On
May 21 this region, from 10° to 55° north latitude, was hidden by a
luminous veil somewhat softer in color than the continents, very much
as if clouds in regular parallel bands were stretched across the planet
from northeast to southwest. At moments these clouds became trans-
pareiit, exposing the outline of the prolongation of Kaiser Sea. Other
similar cloud phenomena were observed on subsequent days. M. Per-
rotin suggests that these phenomena were really produced by clouds
or mists circulating in the atmosphere of Mars, and concludes that they
are, in such case, the act of an element belonging to the atmosphere,
or to the surface of the planet, susceptible of motion and modification
in a comparatively short time.

Mr. Denning, who has been an attentive observer of Mars, has not
been able to make out the canals in the detail assigned to them by
Schiaparelli, although he has distinguished a large number of appear-
ances highly suggestive of these configurations. Mr. Denning con-
cludes a review of his recent observations of the planet (Nature, 34:
105) as follows :

‘“‘Many of our leading treatises on astronomy attribute a dense atmos-
phere to Mars, but nothing has been observed during my recent obser-
vations to corroborate this theory. It seems to me far more plausible
ASTRONOMY, 135

to assume that the atmosphere of this planet is extremely attenuated.
The chief spots are invariably visible, and the phenomena, occasionally
observed are rather to be imputed to the vagaries of our own atmos-
phere than to that of Mars.

“ Jupiter aud Saturn are doubtless enveloped in dense vapors shroud-
ing their real surfaces from terrestrial eyes. Their markings are atmos-
pheric, though in some cases very durable, and constantly undergoing
changes of aspect and displacements of position by longitudinal cur-
rents. On Mars a totally different nature of things prevails.. Here
the appearances described are absolute surface markings displaying
none of the variations which are so conspicuously displayed on J upiter.
It seems to me that the very pronounced character of the
markings and their great permanency are quite opposed to the idea that
the planet is surrounded by a dense cloud-laden atmosphere.”

Dr. Lohse has used, in observing Mars, a double-refracting prism,
achromatized for the extraordinary ray; this prism, placed before the
ocular of the telescope, brings out more sharply the details of the
planet’s surface by reducing the polarized light reflected from its at-
mosphere.

Satellites of Mars.—Professor Hall was able to observe the outer
satellite, Deimos, on four evenings in March, 1886, but the inner satel-
lite was seen only once, and was then so faint that no measurements
could be made. Both little bodies were near their predicted places.

THE MINOR PLANETS.—Eleven minor planets were added to the list
in 1886, the last one bearing the number 264; the brightest was of the
eleventh magnitude. Seven of the new-comers belong to Dr. Palisa,
making the total number discovered by him fifty-seven. Dr. Peters has
now discovered forty-six and Dr. Luther twenty-three.

The dates of discovery and the names, as far as assigned, are given
in the following table:

Number 253, discovered by Dr. Palisa on November 15, 1885, has been
named Mathilde.

The influence of phase on the brightness of the minor planets.—Dr. G.
Miiller, of the Potsdam Observatory, is led to believe from observations
of seven asteroids with a Zéllner photometer, that there is a real con-
nection between the phase of these bodies and their apparent bright-
ness, and that Lambert’s law of phase brightness does not apply to
them. The planets are separated into two classes. In the first class,
class, which embraces Vesta, Iris, Massilia, and Amphitrite, the changes
in brightness are only perceptible as the planet approaches opposition,
thus resembling Mars in their behavior ; in the second, which contains
Ceres, Pallas, and Irene, the changes in brightness seem to be coexten-
sive with the changes of phase, giving a light curve, like that of the
the moon or Mercury.

The asteroid ring.—M. A. Svedstrup gives in the Nachrichten, Nos.
2740-41, an interesting abstract of a recent investigation, for which he
received the gold medal of the Royal Danish Academy—a statistical —
examination of the orbits of 198 of the small planets, considered as
part of a cosmical ring around the sun. The orbit obtained for the
‘‘mean planet” shows an inclination of about 6° and a mean distance
of 2.64. The mass of this fictitious planet corres to an apparent
magnitude, at opposition, of 6.7.*

Relation of the asteroid orbits to that of Tipe. —Professor Newton
points out the interesting fact that the plane of Jupiter’s orbit coincides
almost exactly with the mean plane of the orbits found for the first 251
asteroids, understanding by the mean plane, the plane whose pole is the
center of gravity of the poles of the asteroid planes ; the difference be-
tween the poles is, indeed, only 30’.

JUPITER: The “red spot..—The “ great red spot,” some 30,000 miles
in length by 8,300 in width, has now been the principal object of inter-
est on the planet for eight years. It was faint during the last season,
but far more conspicuous than in 1885. Professor Young obtained,
from eight observations made between March 17 and June 29, 1886, a
rotation-time of the spot of 9 55™ 408.74 0%2, showing that the
remarkable retardation of the period still persists. This is brought
out by the following figures:

In 1879 Mr. Pratt made the period.... 98 55™ 348.9

1880-81 Mr. Hough made the period ..- - 37 .2
1882~83 Mr. Hough made the period.. - 38.4

Professor Young, on re-reducing Mr. Pratt’s observations of 1879, ob-
tains 9" 55™ 348,05, and he finds from a series of observations fae by
Prof. C. W. Pritchett, in 1882, 95 55™ 388.15. A small round white spot

observed at Princeton in March and April, 1885, gave a period of 9
557 118.14. “Itis noteworthy that although this spot was in a higher
latitudé (about 50°south) than the red spot, it yet rotates more rapidly.”
Professor Young remarked the apparent overlapping of the southern
belt and the red spot which took place towards the end of March and
the beginning of April, and which was seen by many Engiish observers
(Observatory, May, 1886, vol. 9: p. 188); but whilst admitting that it
was impossible to say which was uppermost, he was inelined, in oppo-
sition to Mr. Denning’s view, to believe the red spot to be the lower.
Mr. Denning has pointed out that the apparent partial coalescence of
the two markings was simply due to an arm of the southern belt over-
taking the red spot, the former having a rotation period shorter by
about 19* than the latter.

Mr. Denning finds evidence of regular recurrence in many of the
prominent markings on this planet.

SATURN: The satellites of Saturn.—Professor Hall has finished a very
important discussion of the six inner satellites of Saturn, and his work
has been published as Appendix I to the Washington Observations for
1883. The observations of Professor Newcomb in 1874, and Professor
Hall’s own observations from 1875 to 1884, are given in detail; these are
followed by the formation of equations of condition and their solution,
and the work concludes with useful tables of the satellites’ motions.

A remarkable result of the discussion is that the Washington obser-
vations of the five inner satellites can be satisfied within the limits of
their probable errors by circular orbits. It was hoped that the observa-
tions would determine the positions of the lines of apsides with such
accuracy that the motions of these lines would be known, and that thus
we might obtain data for a new determination of the mass of the ring
and of the figure of the plant. But the resulting circular orbits for the
inner satellites make the position of a line of apsides indeterminate, and
for the present the mass of the ring remains unknown.

The mass of Saturn has been computed from the elements found for
Titan, Rhea, Dione, and Tethys with the separate results for the re-
ciprocal of the mass, —

In a paper in the Astronomische Nachrichten (No. 2743) entitled
“ Comparison of the five inner satellites of Saturn made at Toulouse in
138 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 18386.

1876 and 1877,” Professor Hall discusses the old method of observing
these difficult objects by noting their conjunctions with the ends of the
ring, or with some other marked feature of the Saturnian system, but
concludes that the filar micrometer measures are at present among the
best we have. He is inclined to think that the heliometer, if it can be
made large enough, must be one of the best instruments for dealing
with measurements of such objects as Saturn and Jupiter. This sug-
gestion is being carried out by Mr. Asaph Hall, jr., in a series of obser-
vations of Titan with the 6-inch heliometer of the Yale College Obser-
vatory.

The following table represents the results of Professor Hall’s inves-
tigations upon these satellites. The elements of Titan, however, and
the values of the node and inclination of the ring aie adopted from
Bessel. Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, and Rhea are assumed to
move in the plane of the ring, and Hyperion in the plane of Titan.

The motion of Hyperion.—Tisserand in investigating the case of two
satellites moving around their primary in orbits but little inclined to
each other has shown that ifthe mean motions are very nearly com-
mensurable, and if the motion of one was originally circular and uni-
form, the perturbations caused by the other would have for their princi-
pal effect to transform this motion into motion ina Keplerian ellipse
with a uniform rotation of the major axis. Applying this to the case of
Hyperion perturbed by Titan, which has been investigated by Hall and
Newcomb, and in which there is one of the nearest approaches to com-
mensurability of mean motions to be found in the solar system, M.
ASTRONOMY. 139

Tisserand finds that his results agree closely with the facts of observa-
tion, the computed rate of retrograde motion of the perisaturnium of
Hyperion being 18°.8 per annum, whilst the observed quantity is 20°,
and he also finds that his value of the mass of Titan (,,4,,) differs little

from that obtained by Newcomb. (Observatory, November, 1886,
9: 360.)

URANUS.—Observations of the planet made by Dr. H. ©. Wilson at
the Cincinnati Observatory in 1883 (recently published in Astron.
Nachr., 2730), seem to confirm Professor Young’s observations (As-
tron. Nachr., 2545), that the equator of the planet does not coincide
with the plane of the satellites’ orbits.

NEPTUNE: Satellite of Neptune.— Marth calls attention (Month. Not.,
46: 507) to what appears to be a remarkable change in the position of
the plane of the orbit of Neptune’s satellite. He noticed that the orbit
from the Malta observations of 1863~64 did not agree with that from
the observations of 1852. The node and inclination obtained by New-
comb in 1874 showed a movement in the same direction, and the motion
of these elements is still further confirmed by the orbit recently pub-
lished by Professor Hall from his own observations at Washington.
The probable errors are so small that it seems hardly plausible or pos-
sible to attribute the change to systematic errors of observations. Mr.
Marth calls for careful observations to strengthen the evidence.

REPORTS OF OBSERVATORIES.

The following account of the recent activity of astronomical observa-
tories is compiled from all available sources, the “ Vierteljahrsschrift”
furnishing, as usual, the data for most of the observatories, although the
latest reports there published are for the year 1885. I am indebted to
the directors of many observatories for the direct communication of
information in regard to the institutions under their control.

An alphabetical list of astronomical observatories, compiled by Mr.
Boehmer, will be found in the Smithsonian Report for 1885.

M. Lancaster, of the Bruxelles Observatory, has published a useful
directory of observatories and astronomers.

Algiers Observatory (1886).—The French Government has granted the
funds necessary for. the completion of the observatory, and two assist-
ants have been sent to join M. Trépied. A time service has been organ-
ized for the cities of Algiers and Tunis, and the observatory will co-
operate in geodetic work with field parties. Stellar photography will
receive special attention. The observatory possesses a spectroscope by
Thollon giving a spectrum 10 meters in length.

Allegheny Observatory (1886).—The work during 1886 has consisted of
an extension of former researches on invisible radiations, and on the
absorption and radiation of .heat by the earth’s atmosphere, and also of
researches upon the absolute temperature of the lunar surface. In con-
140 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

nection with this latter investigation a new field of exploration has
been opened in spectral regions, where the planet’s own radiations to-
wards space, of very great wave-lengths—exceeding one one-hundredth
of a millimeter—are now for the first time found.

Professor Langley, in giving a portion of his time to the Smithsonian
Institution, has not resigned the active directorship of the observatory,
and all communications relative to the scientific or business affairs of that
institution should be addressed to him at Allegheny as usual. Mr. F.
W. Very continues at the observatory as senior assistant. Mr. Keeler
is now at the Lick Observatory, and has been succeeded at Allegheny
by Mr. James Page, jr.

Amherst (1885).—This observatory, named in honor of the Hon. Abbot
Lawrence, was built in 1847, and has been employed chiefly for purposes
of instruction. Professor Todd was appointed director in July, 1881,
and his report covers the years 1881-1885, inclusive. The instruments
of the observatory are: A 74inch Clark equatorial, a 3-inch Gambey
transit cirele, and a 63-inch Pistor & Martins transit instrument, with
mean-time and sidereal clocks, chronograph, and subsidiary appara‘us.
The equatorial is provided with two small cameras for celestial photog-
raphy. Observations are made of sun-spots, of the phenomena of Jupi-
ter’s satellites, occultations of stars by the moon, etc. The provision-
ally adopted position of the observatory is: Latitude, +42° 22/ 17/.1;
longitude, 4° 50™ 48.67 west of Greenwich.

Amn Arbor (1886).—The observatory is known as the Detroit Observa-
tory, having been founded through the liberality of citizens of Detroit.
Valuable additions and improvements have been made by means of
further contributions from the same source and from the city of Ann
Arbor, and also by appropriations made by the board of regents of the
University of Michigan, to which the observatory is attached. The
building consists of a main part, with a movable dome, and two wings.
The east wing contains the large meridian circle by Pistor & Martins
and a sidereal clock by Tiede, of Berlin. The west wing contains the
library of the observatory, a chronograph with Bond’s new isodynamic
escapement, and the smaller instruments. This wing connects with the
residence of the director. In the dome is mounted a large refracting
telescope, with an object-glass 13 inches in diameter, constructed by
the late Henry Fitz, of New York.

Much attention is given to instruction in astronomy, and through the
liberality of the legislature a small observatory for the purpose of in-
struction has been erected on the observatory grounds near the main
building. It contains an equatorial telescope of 6 inches aperture and
a transit instrument of 3 inches aperture, with zenith telescope attach-
ment. A building near by contains computing rooms and rooms for
observers, and a workshop where necessary repairs and attachments
for the instruments can be made. A set of self-registering meteorologi-
ASTRONOMY. 141

cal instruments has recently been added. It consists of Hough’s baro-
graph and thermograph and an anemograph.

The observatory is under the direction of Prof. M. W. Harrington,
who is assisted by Mr. J. M. Schaeberle and a meteorological observer.
Professor Harrington has devoted considerable time during the past
few years to photometric observations, especially of the asteroids. Mr.
Schaeberle has made observations with the meridian circle.

The observatory plant is valued at about $40,000, and the annual ex-
penditures amount to about $3,000. It should be mentioned that the
American Meteorological Journal is edited here by Professor Harring-
ton.

Armagh (1886).—-Under the direction of Dr. Dreyer the Armagh e¢at-
alogue of 3,300 stars has been published.

Bamberg (1886).—This observatory, founded by the will of the late
Dr. Kemeis, of Bamberg, who died in 1882, will be provided with a 7-
inch heliometer, the largest instrument of its kind made. Dr. Hartwig
proposes to take up the systematic investigation of Stellar parallax, and
the investigation of the physical libration of the moon.

Berlin (1885).—With the meridian circle, Dr. Kiistner has observed a
series of comparison stars for planets and comets, stars which have been
occulted by the moon, stars for heliometer investigations, ete. There
have been made in all 2,096 observations of right ascension and 1,936 of
declination; the reductions are up to date. A new observing list, con-
taining the Pulkowa “ Zusatzsterne” and Argelander’s proper motion
stars—about 1,000 objects in all—was started in 1886. The transit has
been used for observations of cireumpolars, and also for continuing the
observations upon seven selected pairs of stars, which are to furnish
data for determining the constant of aberration. With the 9-inch re-
fractor Dr. Knorre has observed a large number of comets and planets,
and with the aid of his ‘‘declinograph” he has determined the positions
of about a thousand stars, some as faint as the thirteenth magnitude.
Dr. Battermann observed occultations with the 4.6-inch refractor. The
investigations upon the movements of piers have given interesting re-
sults, and the clock which has been for four years in a hermetically
sealed case, continues to perform most satisfactorily.

Bonn (1885).—The meridian circle was devoted, mainly, to continu-
ing the Gesellschaft zone observations. Volume vit, the Southern
Durchmusterung, was published during 1886, and the printing of the
twenty-four charts which are to accompany this work has been begun.
The reduction of the zone work is not quite finished. The director, |
Dr. Schénfeld, has been assisted in observing by Drs. Scheiner, Deich-
miiller, and W. Luther. Dr. Scheiner was absent a considerable por-
tion of the year, serving a term of military duty.

Breslau (1885).—The observatory, under the charge of the veteran
Dr. Galle, is engaged in meteorological and magnetic work. Assistant,
Dr. Lachmann.
142 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Buchtel College Observatory (1886).—Professor Howe has devoted his
time to instruction in practical astronomy. The cost of the observa-
tory was about $5,000.

Bucknell University Observatory.—Mr. William Bucknell has given
the sum of $10,000 for an observatory at Lewisburgh, Pa. A 10-inch
equatorial has been ordered from Clark and a 3-inch transit from
Ertel. The building is of brick, 25 feet by 150 feet, a dome 164 feet in
diameter surmounting the central tower.

The observatory, under the direction of Prof. W. ©. Bartol, is to be
used for instruction in practical astronomy, and will be ready in. June,
1887. ;

Chabot Observatory (1886).—This new observatory, the gift of An-
thony Chabot, esq., to the city of Oakland, Cal., is under the direction
of Mr. F. M. Campbell. The instruments are, an 8-inch equatorial,
with micrometer and spectroscope, a 44-inch transit, chronograph,
clocks, ete. The geographical position given (Sid. Mess., 5:286) is:
Latitude, +37° 48’ 5”; longitude, 3" 0™ 548.3 west of Washington.

Cineimnati (1886).—The Cinema Observatory was founded in 1842
by an astronomical society, and was afterward transferred to the Uni-
versity of Cincinnati, of which it now forms one of the departments. A
new building was erected in 1870 upon Mount Lookout, about 4 miles
east and 2 miles north of the central portion of the city. The observa-
tory grounds comprise 4 acres on the summit of the hill. The building
is of brick; it consists of a central portion supporting the dome, and two
wings, the western being furnished with meridian shutters, and the east-
ern containing the library.

The observatory possesses the Mitchel refractor of 11 inches aper-
ture, made by Merz & Mahier, and supplied with a filar micrometer and
a double-ring micrometer. The magnifying powers range from 90 to
1,500. There is also a portable equatorial of 4 inches aperture by Clark,
with magnifying powers ranging from 15 to 250. The transit instru-
ment, by Buff & Berger, has an aperture of 3 inches and is furnished
with a latitude level and an eye-piece micrometer for measuring differ-
ences of declination. The total value of the instruments is estimated to
be about $12,000. The library contains over fifteen hundred bound vol-
umes pesides a large number of pamphlets.

The financial support is derived from a city tax, ee yearly income
from which is about $5,000. This provides for the eae of the diree-
tor, one assistant, and a janitor, the payment of the ordinary expenses,

-and the publication of results. The purpose of the observatory is both

educational and scientific. Instruction in astronomy is given in con-
nection with the university, and the observatory is also open to the
public for the first hour of each evening.

The principal work of the past year (1886) has been the prosecution
of the zone observations with the 3-inch transit instrument. In these
zones about 4,000 stars between the declinations —19° and —22° have
ASTRONOMY. 143

been observed, most of them three times or more. The work of pre-
paring this catalogue for publication is already commenced, and in the
progress of the work Professor Porter has detected a number o£ inter-
esting cases of proper motion. The catalogue will probably be issued
during the coming year. A few observations of nebule, double stars,
and comets were also made during the early part of the year, but were
suspended owirg to the resignation of Mr. H. ©. Wilson, assistant
astronomer.

The work proposed for 1857 is the completion of the observations
required for the zone catalogue, and after-that the continuation of
a series of charts of southern nebule.

Cointe (1886).—The new observatory attached to the University of
Liége, Belgium, is under the direction of M. Folie, the director of the
Brussels Observatory. The instruments are a 10-inch equatorial and 6-
inch meridian circle (diameter of circle about 31.5 inches), both by
Cooke, with numereus smaller astronomical and geodetic instruments,
and a set of magnetical and meteorological instruments. M. Folie is
assisted by Dr. L. de Ball and M. P. Ubaghs.

Columbia College Observatory (1886).—The observatory is upon the
top of the college library building, 100 feet above the level of Forty-
ninth street, New York City. The13-inch Rutherford equatorial, 3-inch
transit, and zenith telescope are mounted in a room about 24 by 30 feet.
The instruments rest upon solid piers of masonry, which are supported
by heavy iron girders, the floors and ceilings nowhere touching the
girders. The instrumental equipment embraces also a 5-inch equatorial
(not mounted at present), a Troughton & Simms transit, spectroscope
and subsidiary apparatus, clock, chronometers, portable transit, per-
sonal-equation machine, etc. The dome is by Waters & Son, of Troy,
New York, and consists of a paper covering with wooden ribs. The
shutters of the transit slits are also paper, and open by the action of
springs.

Some trouble is caused by vibrations from the railroad trains (over
one hundred a day) constantly passing within 100 feet of the building,
but at times the instruments are very steady.

A careful redetermination of the geographical position of the observ-
atory will be made, as the old Jongitude seems to be somewhat in error.
It is also hoped to devote the Rutherford equatorial, which is supplied
with a photographie corrector, to astronomical photography.

Professor Rees, the director, has but one assistant, and the greater
part of his time is required to carry on a very complete course of in-
struction ip practical astronomy, designed especially for training engi-
neering students.

Dearborn Observatory (1886).—The Dearborn Observatory is the prop-
erty of the Chicago Astronomical Society, but is upon ground leased to
it by the now extinct University of Chicago, and may at any time be
required to vacate. A new site has not yet been selected, Observa-
144 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

tions of Jupiter and of double stars have been made with the equato-
rial during 1886, and the necessary observations for furnishing time to
the city of Chicago have been made with the meridian circle. A cata-
logue of two hundred and nine new double stars has been sent to the
Nachrichten. It is expected that observations of double stars, Jupiter,
and the satellites of Uranus will be kept up during the coming year.
The instruments of the observatory are valued at $30,000. There is
no permanent endowment, and Professor Hough carries on his work
without assistants.

Deutz (1885).—Herr Emil Mengering established in 1884 a private
observatory, the principal instrument being a 5-inch refractor by Rein-
felder & Hertel. Physical observations of the moon and Jupiter have
been made, and attention is being directed to astronomical photography
and spectroscopy. Approximate geographical position: Latitude, +50°
56/ 33’; longitude, +05 25™ 45*.0 west of Berlin.

Die nicn (1885).—At Baron von Engelhardt’s observatory observa-
tions were made of comets, nebulz, double stars, the phenomena of Ju-
piter’s satellites, occultations by the moon, ete.

Dresden (1885)—Dr. Drechsler, of the “ Mathematischer Salon,” con-
tinues a series of meteorological observations begun in 1828.

Diisseldorf (1885).—Since 1847, 1,271 observations of 157 asteroids
have been made.

Frankfort-on-the-Main (1885).—Herr Epstein continues his star-gauges
and his observations of sun-spots.

Geneva (1885).—Four hundred and ninety-eight chronometers were
tested during 1885, some of them showing an uncommon degree of ex-
cellence. Forty-two chronometers were entered on December 1, 1885,
for a twelve- weeks’ special trial of temperature compensation. M.Kam-
mermann has employed the 10-inch equatorial in observations of com-
ets, nebulz, and satellites. Meteorological observations are continued
as in former years.

Gotha (1885).—Dr. Becker has given up the greater part of his time
to.the reduction of his zone observations. The equatorial which has
received anew 44-inch objective by Reinfelder & Hertel, and has been
thoroughly repaired, was remounted in October. <A series of observa-
tions was made with the meridian instrument.

Greenwich (1886).—The annual report of the astronomer royal, Mr.
Christie, was submitted to the board of visitors of the Greenwich Ob-
servatory on June 5, and gives an account of the progress and activ-
ity of the observatory for the year ending May 20, 1886. The regular
work of the transit circle and the altazimuth has been continued, and
very satisfactory results have been obtained with the apparatus for de-
termining absolute personal equations brought into use with the former
instrument some months ago. Spectroscopic observations include a
considerable number made of the new star which burst out in the great
nebula of Andromeda. The spectroscopic observations of Sirius indi-

cate, as in the last three years, a displacement of the F line towards
the blue; this displacement would correspond to a motion of the ear th
towards Se at arate of something more than 20 miles per second,

though, from the nature of the observations, the amount of such a mo-

tion can not be considered as very accurately determined. For the year
1885 a photographic record of the sun’s surface can be made out for
three hundred and sixty days by filling up the gaps in the series of
Greenwich photographs from photographs obtained in India and the
Mauritius. Observations of comets and of casual phenomena have been
made with the equatorials; and the magnetie and meteorological ob-

servations, the time-service, ete., have been kept up as in previous years.

The full import of the feeemeut that the reductions of the observations
are keeping pace with their registration will be appreciated by all who
are engaged in routine astronomical work.

In regard to the new equatorial Mr. Christie says: “The construe-
tion of an object-glass of 28 inches aperture and 28 feet focal length,
with suitable tube, to be mounted on the southeast equatorial, has been
authorized oy the Goyernment, and the necessary funds have been pro-

vided in the estimates. The work has been intrusted to Mr. Grubb,
with whom I have arranged the details of the tube, which is to be of
special construction, adapted to the conditions of the mounting, and
available for spectroscopy and photography as well as for eye observa-
tions. Mr. Grubb proposes to provide means for readily separating the
lenses of the object-glass to such a distance as will give the proper cor-
rection for photographic rays.”

It is proposed to refit the 123-inch refractor for astronomical pho-
tography by placing a combination of a convex flint and a concave
crown lens about 2 feet within the focus, in order te correct the chro-
matic aberration of the ebjective for the photographic rays without
alteration of the focal length.

Grignon (1885).—Observations of sun-spots and of the physical ap-
pearance of planets, ete.

Hamburg (1885).—Only one hundred and nineteen nights in the year
were favorable for observing. Besides the meridian observations and
the observations of planets and comets, a large number of chronom-
eters have been tested. Dr. Schrader has left the observatory to take
part in a scientific exploring expedition, and his place is filled tempo-
rarily by Dr. Wilhelm Luther. The time-balls at Cuxhaven and Bremer-
haven have worked satisfactorily, the former having failed only four
times and the latter five. The Hamburg ball has given more trouble,
having failed, from various causes, twenty-one times during the year.

Harvard College Observatory (1886).—The forty-first annual report of
the director covers the year ending November 1, 1886. About half the
Paine bequest, or $164,198, has become available for the support of the
observatory ; and the funds, which in 1875 amounted to $164,067 and
in 1885 to $226,958, have now risen to $398,046. This increase must for

the present be devoted to the publication of observations already made,
and to effecting repairs in the buildings and instruments. A new
mounting for the 15-inch equatorial is required, and Professor Pickering
expresses the hope that at no distant day means may be found for re-
placing the present building by one better adapted to the requirements
of modern astronomy.

The most important extension of the work of the observatory which
has recently been made is in the field of stellar photography. With the
aid from the Bache fund almost the entire visible sky has been photo-
graphed, and a large number of photographs of stellar spectra have
been obtained. For continuing the researches upon a stellar spectra
Mrs. Draper has lent the 11-inch photographic lens employed by her
husband, the late Dr. Henry Draper, and has provided means for a new
mounting at Cambridge, and for the proper reduction and publication
of the results. This investigation has been referred to under “Astro-
nomical photography.”

The 15-inch equatorial has been used for photometric observations,
observations of new comets, and of the new stars in Andromeda and
Orion, and for experiments in photography.

The work projected for the meridian circle is now completed, and
the reductions are being pushed as rapidly as possible. Volume
XV, part I, containing the annual results for the fundamental stars,
1870-79, and the individual results, 1883-86, has been published ; it
includes also the results from the separate observations of stars belong-
ing to various special classes, and the catalogue of 1,213 stars, sepa-
rately issued in 1585. The second part of this volume will contain the
catalogue of zone stars. Volume Xvi (published) contains a tabular
statement of the instrumental constants and a journal of the observa-
tions. A volume corresponding to volume xVI, but relating to the zone
stars instead of the fundamental stars, and another, containing the obser-
vations for absolute right ascension and declination made from 1879 to
1883, will complete the work of the meridfan circle still requiring publi-
cation. The resignation of Prof. William A. Rogers, who has had charge
of this instrument since it was mounted in 1870, is greatly to be re-
gretted. Professor Rogers has accepted the position of professor of
astronomy at Colby University, Waterville, Maine, but will, however,
superintend the reduction of his meridian observations and their publi-
cation.

The meridian photometer, Professor Pickering states, has given en-
tire satisfaction, both in accuracy and in rapidity of work. (See Pho-
tometry.) A time-ball is dropped at the Boston post-office, and the
telegraphic announcement of important discoveries has been continued
under the management of Mr. Ritchie. The report concludes with a
list, embracing twenty-two titles, of contributions to astronomical litera-
ture made by officers of the institution during the year.

The available annual income, including gifts for immediate use, is
$22,000. The salary of the director is $3,400, the use of the house being
estimated at $600 more. The sale of time signals brought in nearly
$3,000 during the year. The principal items of expenditure are—

The personnel includes Professor Pickering, the director; assistant,
Prof. W. A. Rogers (resigned September 1, 1886); assistant, Prof. A.
Searle; and Messrs. Wendell, Edmands, Ritchie, Gerrish; Gifford, and
Metcalf; with six computers, ladies.

The Boyden fund, which was left for the purpose of astronomical
research ‘“ at such anelevation as to be free, so far as practicable, from
the impediments to accurate observations which oceur in the observa-
tories now existing, owing to atmospheric influences,” has been trans-
ferred to Harvard College and will be administered at the observatory.
The fund at present exceeds $230,000. Professor Pickering proposes to
establish an experimental observing station in Colorado, but desires to
occupy ultimately some high mountain peak in the southern hemisphere
where observations—largely photographic, probably—ean be carried on
in co-operation with Cambridge. Information in regard to eligible sites
south of the equator is much desired.

Heidelberg (1886).—Private observatory of Dr. Wolf. The principal
instrument is a 6-inch equatorial; objective by Reinfelder & Hertel,
mounting by Sendtner, of Munich. <A photograph of the observatory
is given in Sirius, vol. 19, Heft 12.

Helsingfors (1885).—Dr. Donner has continued to observe the moon,
moon-culminating stars, and planets, with the large transit instrument.
This instrument is to be remodeled by Repsold into a meridian circle.
A portable transit of 6.9°™ (2.7 inches) aperture by Repsold has been
mounted in the prime vertical. The equatorial has been used for ob-
serving comets.

Herény (1885).—The mirror of the 104-inch reflector having been re-
Silvered by Professor Safarik, the instrument has been arranged for
experiments in celestial photography. Herr von Gothard has succeeded
in photographing several constellations, star-clusters, nebule, and stel-
lar spectra, but the work is still regarded as experimental. Spectro-
148 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

_ scopic observations and drawings of the planets have been continued
as heretofore.

Hillsborough, Ohio.—Private observatory of Henry A. Pavey. Ap-
proximate position: Latitude, +39° 12’; longitude, 5" 34" west of
Greenwich. The instruments are a 4-inch equatorial by Benjamin
Pike’s Sons, with mean-time clock and chrouometer, and other accesso-
ries. Physical observations of the sun and Jupiter have been made,
and observations of the zodiacal light. Variable stars have been ob-
served in accordance with the plan proposed by Professor Pickering.

Kalocsa Observatory (1886).—Dr. C. Braun has published a report of
the observatory founded by Cardinal Haynald, archbishop of Kaloesa.
The instruments are a refractor, by Merz, of 7 inches; another of 4
inches; a transit, by Cooke, of 2.3 inches; altazimuth, clocks, spectro-
scopes, photometers, etc. The latitude from geodetic observations is
+46° 31/ 41.92; astronomical methods give it 0.07 greater. The lon-
gitude is 1" 15™ 545.343 east of Greenwich. A valuable series of sun-
spot observations has been made and discussed.

Karlsruhe (1886).—The observatory at Karlsruhe (Baden) is still in
a small, temporary, wooden building, the instruments having been re-
moved in 1881 from Mannheim to the present quarters in Karlsruhe,
where the observatory forms a part of the “‘Techniche Hochschule.”
Unfortunately the financial condition of the Grand Duchy of Baden bas
thus far precluded the establishment of a thoroughly equipped observa-
tory, which has been in contemplation. The temporary building has
two small meridian rooms, and a dome. The instruments are: (1) a
6 inch refractor by Steinheil, lately remounted by Fecker & Co., of
Wetzlar; (2) an old repeating circle by Reichenbach some years ago
changed into a meridian circle by Hildebrandt & Schramm, of Freiberg ;
the telescope. has an aperture of 84 millimeters (3.3 inches); the divided
cirele is 3 feet in diameter; (3) a large portable transit instrument by
Bamberg, of Berlin; (4) two fine clocks by Hohwii, of Amsterdam—
one with break-circuit attachment; (5) chronographs, chronometers,
ete,

The personnel consists, at present, of the director, one regular assist-
ant, and a temporary assistant. The director, Dr. W. Valentiner, has
begun with the meridian circle a series of observation of all stars down
to the eighth maguitude between 0° and 20° of south declination, each
star will be observed six times. So far about nine thousand observa-
tions have been made, and most of these have been reduced and pub-
lished in parts 1 and 2 of the “ Veroffentlichungen ” of the observatory.
The assistant, Dr. von Rebeur-Paschwitz, uses the refractor for observa-
tions of comets, occultations, ete.; his principal work is the micromet-
rical measurement of star-clusters; two groups will Soon be finished.
The filar micrometer has been carefully investigated. Herr von Kebeur
has also completed an exhaustive discussion of comet 1582 I (Wells).
The second assistant, Herr L, Stutz, makes regular observations with
ASTRONOMY. 149

the transit instrument for the time-service of the observatory, and
also observes moon-culminations and right ascensions of the fundamen-
tal stars for the southern zones of the “ Astronomische Gesellschaft.”

Kew (1886).—The magnetical and meteorological observations and
observations for time are kept up. Sketches of sun-spots projected on
the photo-heliograph screen are made in order to continue Schwabe’s
enumeration.

Kiel (1885).—Observations with the meridian circle and equatorial
‘are continued, the equatorial having been provided with a new regis-
tering apparatus. The catalogue founded on the Helsingfors Gotha
zones is still unfinished.

Lawrence Observatory.—(See Amherst.)

Kis-Kartel (1886).—Private observatory of Baron Podmanicezky, near
Budapest, Hungary. The principal instrument is a 7-inch refractor
by Merz, with a mounting by Cooke. The work commences next year
with double-star measures and physical observations of the sun, moon,
and planets.

La Plata Observatory (1886).—The Government of the province of
Buenos Aires is fitting up in La Plata an observatory which is to have
a 31.5-inch reflector, an equatorial coudé of 17 inches, an 8-inch transit,
a large Thollon spectroscope with objective of 9.8 inches, apparatus for
celestial photography, and numerous smaller instruments. A time-
Service will be instituted, and a large amount of geodetic work will be
done, including the measurement of an are of a meridian. The ob-
Servatory is to be under the direction of M. Beuf, late an officer in the
French navy. i

Leipzig (1885).—Dr. Harzer has gone to Pulkowa, and has been suc-
ceeded at Leipzig by Herr Schnauder. The zone observations and
necessary reductions are being advanced as rapidly as possible. The -
equatorial has been used on comets and star-clusters.

Leyden Observatory (1885).—Prof. H. G. van de Sande Bakhuyzen’s
report is for the year ending September 15, 1885. The new 104-inch
equatorial, with objective by Clark, and mounting by Repsold, is ready
for use. The 7-inch refractor was used for observations of comets. A
series of measurements of artificial disks was made with Airy’s double-
image micrometer for the purpose. of determining the systematic errors
of the measures of the diameters of Mars and Uranus obtained in for-
mer years. The meridian circle was devoted to observations of fairly
bright cireumpolar stars. Some progress has been made with the re-
ductions of the zone observations, 1874~76.

Lick Observatory (1886).—The Lick Observatory will soon ke counted
as one of the active observatories of America. The formal opening
and transfer to the University of California can not take place until the
great telescope is mounted (probably in the summer of 1887), but Pro-
fessor Holden already has one assistant at work—Mr. Keeler, who has
been Professor Langley’s assistant at Allegheny for a number of years.
150 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR .i886.

The crown and flint lenses for the 36-inch objective arrived safely at
Mount Hamilton on December 27, 1856, and have been packed away
in a fire-proof vault in readiness for the mounting.

It is the intention to provide three lenses, the third a ‘‘ photographic
corrector” which can be slipped on in front of the other two. The
Clarks found that the first piece of glass sent them for this lens showed
signs of internal strain due to insufficient annealng, and the work of
figuring was only undertaken at the risk of the makers, Feil & Co.
The suspicion of strain proved well founded, for the disk burst into
three pieces while upon the grinding tool. Another disk will be pro-
cured and should be ready by June 1, 1887. The cost of the objective
was $52,000. The photographic lens will add several thousand dollars
to this. The recent death of Feil pére may cause serious delay in ob-
taining the glass for the third lens.

The mounting is under way in the workshops of Messrs. Warner &
Swasey, of Cleveland, Ohio, and will be delivered at Mount Hamilton
in June, 1887, for $42,000. It will contain many novel devices, among
them an application of a modified form of the bicyele ball-bearings to
the right ascension and declination axes, which will insure great ease
of movement. The driving clock will have an electrical control.

The hemispherical dome of 70 feet interior diameter has been built
by the Union Iron Works, of San Francisco, for $56,800. Tbe question
of an observing chair has been met by adopting Grubb’s plan of mov-
ing the floor vertically 16 feet. Some such arrangement becomes ab-
solutely necessary when we consider that the ‘‘ spectroscopic length”
of the telescope is some 5 feet more than the visual length, and the
photographie length some 8 feet less; the eye-piece may be 7 feet from
the base of the dome when the telescope is pointed to the zenith, or it
may be 35 feet in the horizontal position. The floor will be raised in
four minutes with a perfectly parallel motion, by hydraulic rams. The
cost of the floor will be $14,500. A star spectroscope is to be made by
Brashear, of Pittsburgh, for $1,000, and the micrometer by Fauth, of
Washington, for $750.

The total cost of the observatory will be a little over $500,000, leav-
ing nearly $200,000 available as a permanent endowment. The annual
income of the observatory from all sources will be about $20,000.

In the summer of 1886 Prof. G. C. Comstock made an investigation
of the Repsold meridian circle and a preliminary determination of the
latitude. The resulting latitude of the north dome is + 37° 20/ 25/2 ;
the longitude given by the U.S. Coast Survey is 8" 6™ 348.35 west of
Greenwich. A time-service is in operation over the whole Pacific sys-
tem of railways from Ogden to El Paso. Volume1 of the observatory
publications is in press, and will be distributed in the early summer.

Professor Holden’s plan for utilizing to the utmost the magnificent
equipment under his charge must commend itself to every one. The
plan is to relinquish the use of the 36-inch equatorial for certain hours
ASTRONOMY. 151

of each day to distinguished astronomers, specialists, who may wish to
turn its enormous power upon some one of the many unsolved prob-
lems of astronomy. Such astronomers may be invited to visit the
observatory for periods of several months, and will be given every
possible facility. The legislature of California has provided money for
a permanent support of the observatory.

Lund (1885).—Dr. Dunér is principally occupied with stellar spectra
and variable stars. Herr Laurin has observed with the meridian in-
strument a number of stars with large proper motion.

McCormick Observatory.—Professor Stone’s report for the year end-
ing June 1, 1886, states that the 26-inch equatorial has been employed
chiefly in examining and sketching southern nebulae. The nebula in
Orion and the Trifid and Omega nebule have received special attention;
many others have been studied, and two hundred and thirty-three new
nebulz have been discovered. “The features seen indicate that the
performance of the instrument employed surpasses that of any of the
great reflectors which have been used in the examination of nebulae.”
Double stars, comets, and occultations by the moon have also been ob-
served. Observations with the small equatorial for the revision of the
23° zone are now practically completed. Electric lamps are used for
illuminating the circles and field of the great equatorial, and have
proved most useful. The 45-foot dome revolves as easily as when first
erected.

The cost of the observatory building and instruments was about
$70,000, of which $64,000 was the gift of Leander J. McCormick. A
working fund of $25,000 was given by William H. Vanderbilt, and an
endowment of the directorship of $50,000 was subscribed by thealumni
of the University of Virginia.

Professor Stone is assisted by Mr. F. P. Leavenworth and Mr. F. Mul-
ler. Part 2 of volume lI, on the great comet of 1882, and part 3, on the
nebula of Orion, have been issued during the year.

MeGill College Observatory (1886).—A most thorough discussion of a
series of longitude observations by Professor McLeod, at MeGill Col-
lege, and Professor Rogers, at Harvard College Observatory, has been
published: the resulting longitude of the pier of the transit instrument
at McGill Observatory being 4" 54™ 188.543 + 08.043 west of Greenwich.
The center of the dome of the Harvard Observatory is assumed to be
in longitude 45 44™ 30°.993 + 08.041 west of Greenwich.

Melbourne (1886).—Mr. Ellery has published the first installment of
observations of southern nebulae made with the great Melbourne re-
flector from 1869 to 1885. A description of the great 4-foot Cassegrain-
ian reflectoris given; and there are several lithographs of small nebule.
Some fine results have been obtained in photography both of the moon
and of stars and nebule.

Milan.—The 18-inch Merz-Repsold refractor was mounted and ready
152 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

for work in May, 1886. The 8-inch glass has been used for double stars,
comets, ete. Messrs. Rajna, Porro, and Abetti have been engaged in —
geodetic work.

Morrison Observatory (1886).—The work of the equatorial for 1886
has consisted of a series of observations on comets Fabry, Barnard,
and Finlay (reduced and published or ready for publication); physical
observations of Jupiter and phenomena of Jupiter’s satellites, with a
few observations of occultations by the moon. The meridian circle can
be used, at present, only for time observations and for the determina-
tion of such star-places as are needed in equatorial work. <A daily and
efficient time-service is maintained on railroads extending to St. Louis,
Chicago, and Kansas City, and thence south and southwest. Meteor-
ological observations are kept up with regularity.

Professor Pritchett has prepared a small volume of the unpublished
observations of former years. This is now passing-through the press,
and will be distributed as soon as practicable. The expense of publi-
cation is borne by Mrs. Berenice Morrison-Fuller, the founder of the ob-
servatory.

The annual income of the observatory is $2,160. This covers all ex-
penses, including salaries. The director has no assistance, except that
rendered by his daughters, and such as is afforded by a boy in handling
the instruments and caring for the rooms.

Munich (1885).—The revision of Lamont’s catalogue is progressing
favorably. A number of stars from the southern Durchmusterung have
been added to the observing list, to fill up gaps. Dr. Seeliger has fin-
ished a count of the stars in this southern extension of the Durchmus-
terung similar to the one already published for stars. of the northern
hemisphere. Dr. Bauschinger was obliged to devote two months of
the year to “ Militérische Verpflichtungen.”

Nice (1886).—The refractor of 30 inches was provisionally mounted in
August, and it is stated that the trials with it have given most excel-
lent results.

O’Gyalla (1885).—The main work of the observatory has been the ex-
perimental determination of the mechanical energy of the radiations
of thirty-four stars of the first and second magnitude. The spectro-
scopic * Durchmusterung” of a zone 0° to 15° is nearly completed.
Sun-spots are observed regularly.

Oxford University Observatory (1886).—Professor Pritchard’s report
was read to the board of visitors on June 16. The photometrie meas-
urement of the magnitudes of an equatorial zone of stars has been un-
dertaken. Attention will be given to astronomical photography—a
department of work for which the observatory is well equipped—di-
recting investigations to, first, the relation which exists between the
photometric and the photographic magnitude of stars; second, the re-
liable uniformity of the photographie film; third, the amount of astro-
nomical accuracy attainable on the same.
ASTRONOMY. 1538

Palermo (1885).—New comets, shooting stars, solar spots, and pro-
tuberances have been observed; drawings have been made of the
planets, and atmospheric phenomena have been studied.

Paris (1885).—The report of Admiral Mouchez, presented to the
council on the 22d of January, 1886, gives especial prominence to the
work in astronomical photography. A reproduction is given of a pho-
tograph of the Pleiades taken by the Henry Brothers, and also an il-
lustration of the instrument employed. We have already referred to
many of the interesting results obtained. Three instruments have
been used for photography; the first (aperture 6.3 inches), the exper-
imental instrument used in 1884, has been employed in photometric
researches. The second is a smaller instrument, aperture 4.3 inches,
for photographing large comets and extended groups of stars. The
tbird is the equatorial of 13 inches aperture, with which the more im-
portant work has been done.

The routine work has not, however, suffered; in the meridian service
over sixteen thousand observations -have been made by sixteen differ-
ent observers; the instrument devised by M. Lowy, the equatorial
coudé, has been used for the observation of comets and minor planets,
and the time-service, meteorological department, etc., are all in a most
satisfactory condition. The reductions for the great catalogue were
completed up to 8 right-ascension. The catalogue has been printed up
to number 3,800.

Plonsk (1885).—Comets, double stars, ete., have been observed, and
an interesting study of the atmospheric lines of the spectrum has been
undertaken. Dr. Jedrzejewicz, the director, has made a new deter-
mination of the geographical co-ordinates of the observatory with the
following result: Latitude, +52° 37’ 40”; longitude, 27" 578.07 east
of Berlin.

Potsdam (1885).—Dr. Vogel’s most interesting report occupies more
than ten pages of the Vierteljahrsschrift (vol. 21, pp. 132-142). The
instruments have been improved in many minor details, and several
pieces of subsidiary apparatus have been added. Drs. Miiller and
Kempf have devoted considerable time to finishing the new determina-
tion of wave-lengths of the Fraunhofer lines. Drs. Vogel and Wilsing
have been at work upon the spectra of new stars, spectra of comets, and
spectra of solar spots and protuberances. Dr. Miiller has made a num-
ber of photometric observations of the major and minor planets, while
Dr. Wilsing has observed variable stars. Dr. Lohse has made a series
of drawings of Jupiter, and has obtained one hundred and forty-six
photographs of the sun; these latter, taken in connection with Dr.
Spoerer’s telescopic observations, will furnish ample material for the
history of the spots. Dr. Lohse has also continued his series of photo-
graphs of star-clusters with gratifying success. Dr. Wilsing hascarried
on a very interesting series of experiments to determine the density of
the earth. The third part of volume four and the fifth volume of the
154 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Annals have been published. The library has inereased to about thirty-
seven hundred volumes.

Prague (1885).—Professor Safarik has devoted his attention to varia-
ble stars.

Princeton (1886).—The 23-inch equatorial has been used by Professor
Young in micrometrical work upon close double stars, the satellites of
Uranus and Neptune, the surface markings of Jupiter, and the details
of Saturn. Comets are observed when they have become difficult ob-
jects for smaller instruments. Occasional spectroscopic observations
are made of sun-spots, prominences, and comets. The institution has
no endowment which would make it possible to undertake any extensive
or continuous programme of work. The small observatory is used
almost entirely for instruction in practical astronomy, this part of the
work being under the immediate supervision of Professor McNeill.

Pulkowa (1886).—The annual report of Dr. Struve is for the year
ending May 25,1886. The great routine work, the determination of
star-positions, has been continued as in former years. The 30-inch re-
fractor, in the hands of Dr. Hermann Struve, has been employed in
observing the faint double stars of Burnham’s catalogue, the satellites
of Mars, Saturn, and Neptune, the Maia nebula and Nova Andromede,
which was easily visible on January 27. Dr. Hermann Struve speaks in
the highest terms of the instrument, both as regards its optical power
and its mounting, the movement of the dome, etc. Backlund has meas-
ured with the 4-inch heliometer the positions of Jupiter’s satellites, for
a determination of the mass of the planet and the orbits of the satellites.
Hasselberg has been experimenting upon photography of the solar spee-
trum. The observatory has met with a severe loss in the recent death
of Herr Wagner.

Radcliffe Observatory (1886).—Observations have been made of the
sun, the moon throughout: the lunation, occultations by the moon, and
the phenomena of Jupiter’s satellites. Volume 41, containing results
for 1883, has been published.

Rio Janeiro (1886).—M. Cruls announces that the observatory is to
be transferred to a new site, nearly on the same parallel as the present
observatory, but two minutes of time farther west. M. Cruls has been
commissioned by the Emperor of Brazil to have a photographic appa-
ratus constructed similar to that at Paris, in order to co-operate in the
proposed photographic survey of the heavens.

Rousdon (1886).—A_ private observatory erected in 1884 and 1885 by
Mr. Cuthbert E. Peek at Rousdon, near Lyme Regis, Devon, England.
The principal instruments are, a 6.4-inch equatorial objective by Merz,
mounting by Cooke, a 2-inch Troughton & Simms transit, chronometers,
ete. Beneath the equatorial room is a laboratory which is also fitted
for photography. In 1886 the comets of the year and a list of long-
period variables were observed, and transit observations were made for
rating the chronometers. A volume containing observations of comets,
ASTRONOMY. 155

Nova Andromede, etc., and meteorological observations from 1882 to
1885 has been published.

Smith College Observatory.—Professor Todd includes in his report of
the Amherst Observatory a brief account of an observatory, the con-
struction of which he has supervised for the trustees of Smith College
(for young women), at Northampton, Massachusetts. A one-story brick
building is divided into an equatorial room, photographic dark-room,
library, clock-room, and transit-room. The equatorial is of 11 inches
aperture, the objective by the Clarks, and mounting by Warner &
Swasey. Incandescent lamps are provided for the illumination of the
circles and micrometers. The transit-room will contain a 4-inch merid-
jan cirele. The approximate position of the new observatory is: Lati-
tude, + 42° 19’ 7”; longitude, 4" 50™ 328.9 west of Greenwich.

South Evanston (1886).—Dr. Marshall D. Ewell has erected a small
private observatory at South Evanston, Cook County, Llinois, 10.8
miles north of Chicago. The equatorial is a 64-inch Clark refractor
mounted on a pier made of Portland cement and fine gravel so as to
form practically a single piece of rock from top to bottom. The dome
is 12 feet in diameter, built with ash ribs covered with tin, and turns
on six iron wheels. The observatory is also provided with a 24-inch
Troughton & Simms transit, sidereal and mean-time chronometers,
and minor apparatus.

Stockholm (1885).—Investigations upon the motions of the different
members of the solar system have absorbed the attention of the director
and his assistants. The mean motions of the apsides of the planets
Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are found to differ sensibly from the
values assigned by Leverrier. Herr Shdanow has continued Gyldén’s
researches upon the lunar theory, and Dr. Harzer has contributed a
valuable memoir upon the motion of Hecuba.

Strassburg.—Dr. Schur, previous to his departure for Gottingen, where
he takes Klinkerfnes’ place, published a report, dated May 6, 1886, sup-
plementary to his annual report of July, 1885. The principal meridian
work was upon southern stars in the extension of the Durchmusterung,
and Auwers’ eighty-three southern fundamental stars and refraction
stars. The moon was observed with the altazimuth; comets with the
refractor. Dr. Kobold succeeds Herr Schur. Dr. Winnecke has been
retired, at his own request, on account of ill health.

Tacubaya (1885) —The Observatorio Nacional, formerly at Chapulte-
pec, is now at Tacubaya, about 6 miles from the city of Mexico. The
final value of the longitude of the large meridian circle, from exchanges
in 1885 with St. Louis, is 6? 36™ 468,54 + 08.02 west of Greenwich.
(Astron. Jour., 7: 62.)

Taschkent (1885).—The refractor was employed principally in observ-
Ing sun-spots; comets and occultations were also observed. The merid-
ian circle furnished the places of a number of comparison stars for
156 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

comets and planets. Geographical positions were determined for six
towns in central Asia.

Temple Observatory (1886).—Observations of double stars have been
continued, and spectroscopic observations to determine the motion of
stars in the line of sight. :

United States Naval Observatory (1886).—No material change has
been made in the character of the work. Professor Hall has used the
26-inch refractor in observations of Saturn, of double stars, and of
satellites; and also for determinations of stellar parallax. No deteriora-
tion of the objective has been noticed since it was repolislfed ten years
ago.

The transit circle has been employed in observations of the sun,
moon, planets, and such stars as are necessary to complete the data
for a transit-circle catalogue, which will contain all of the miscellaneous
stars observed since the instrument was mounted, twenty years ago.
The reductions are somewhat behindhand on account or the inade-
quate computing force. The 9.6-inch equatorial has been used in the
observation of comets, asteroids, and the occultation of stars by the
moon; and the Repsold meridian circle at Annapolis temporarily, under
the direction of the Superintendent of the Washington Observatory, in
the observation of a list of southern stars. The revision of Yarnall’s
catalogue and the reduction of recent observations with the prime
vertical instrument are progressing favorably. Photographs of the sun
have been taken with the photo-heliograph used during the transit of
Venus. Ninety-eight negatives showing spots were secured between
January 11 and September 30, 1886.

The extensive time-service of the observatory is in an efficient state,
and the chronometer tests inaugurated a few years ago have proved of
great benefit to the naval service. Considerable attention has also
been given to the examination of nautical instruments, thermometers,
etc., for the Navy.

The volume for 1882, and Appendices I, U1, and 111 to the volume for
1883 have been distributed.

Commodore Belknap was relieved from duty as Superintendent on
June 7, 1886, by Commander A. D. Brown, and Commander Brown on
November 15 by Capt. Robert L. Phythian.

The expenses of the observatory are met by annual appropriations
from Congress, the naval officers (including professors) receiving the
pay of their respective ranks. The pay of fourteen officers attached to
the observatory December 1, 1886, aggregated $31,400.

The specific appropriation for the observatory for the year ending
June 30, 1886, contains the following items: For pay of three assistant
astronomers, $3,600; one clerix, $1,800; instrument maker, $1,500; four
watchmen, $4,880; assistant for the 26-inch equatorial, $720; gardener,
$1,000 ; seven laborers, $4,620; for miscellaneous computations, $1,200 ;
purchase of apparatus and material for repairs of instruments, $2,500;
ASTRONOMY. 157

library, $1,000 ; repairs to buildings, fuel, gas, furniture, stationery, and
contingent expenses, $3,900; freight on observatory publications sent
to foreign countries, $366. The entire annual cost of the maintenance
of the observatory may, therefore, be put at about $58,500 ;—$50,700
being for salaries and wages, and nearly $7,800 for other expenses. The
item of salaries- will vary considerably, of course, with the number and
rank of line officers on duty, and it should be borne in mind that sev-
eral of the officers are engaged upon work carried on at the observatory
as a naval institution.

The sum of $100,000 is now available for the erection of a new obser-
vatory, and the plans prepared six or eight years ago are being revised,
with a prospect of beginning work upon the new buildings in the course
of afew months. The total cost of the buildings is limited to $400,000.

Warner Observatory.—Dr. Swift has confined himself to the discovery
of new nebulz and the search for comets. The instruments are: A
16-inch Clark equatorial, provided with a filar micrometer and many
convenient accessories ; a 44-inch comet-seeker, and a sidereal clock by
Howard. <A spectroscope, to cost $1,000, has been ordered from Alvan
Clark & Sons. A description of the observatory, with its instruments
and work from 1885 to 1886, has been published as volume If of the ob-
servatory publications. This volume contains a list of four hundred and
nine nebule discovered since July 9, 1883 (it is stated that five hundred
and forty have been discovered in all), a list of the Warner astronom.
ical prizes, and the full text of the Warner prize essays on comets and
on the red ‘“‘ sky-glows.”

Vanderbilt University Observatory, Nashville, Tenn.—This observa-
tory is supplied with the following instruments:

Six-inch equatorial refractor, by T. Cooke & Sons, 8-foot focus, with
hour circle divided to single minutes, and subdivided to 28 by opposite
verniers ; and declination circle divided to 10/ and read by two verniers
to 10”. There is also a third vernier reading to 15’, used for setting
in declination, and read by the observer at the eye-piece with a small
telescope. The instrument is supplied with eight eye-pieces, ranging
from 60 to 600, and filar micrometer (bright field, dark wires only). A
revolving disk with colored glasses gives a change of color of field,—a
red one being found most useful, as it seems to permit observations of
fainter objects with sufficient distinctness of the wires. A ring microm-
eter (not belonging to the observatory) is also used with the equatorial.
A good driving clock gives a steady motion to the telescope. Two
spectroscopes belong to this instrument—one, a direct-vision spectro-
scope by Merz & Mahler, the other by Grubb.

The equatorial room is surmounted by a hemispherical dome, revolv-
ing readily by hand on twelve pairs of wheels. The shutter is of light
corrugated iron, in two sections; the upper section, two-thirds of the
entire length, passes through the zenith to the back of the dome; the
other part is drawn to one side, running on two light wheels, upon
158 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

a projecting platform. This instrument has been used during the past
year in the observation of comets, nebule, and the planets, and other
miscellaneous work. Positions of all the comets have been obtained
with either the ring or filar micrometer. Some experiments in celestial
photography have been carried on, and good views of the moon obtained.
The instrument cost about $1,900.

A 4-inch meridian circle, by Ertel, with circles 26 inches in diameter,
divided to 3’. On the east pier is mounted a frame carrying four micro-
scopes which read the circle to 0.5. The reticule consists of thirteen
vertical and two horizontal wires. The field or threads are illuminated
at will. This instrument is reversible, and cost about $1,400.

The chronograph is one of Warner & Swazey’s | latest designs, and
is used with either the equatorial or meridian circle. Cost, $375. The
sidereal clock, by Dent, cost $500. The mean time clock, by Howard,
cost $400.

There is also a 3-inch altazimuth, by Cooke; and a 5-inch portable
refractor, by Byrne. This latter instrument is not the property of the
observatory. With it Professor Barnard has discovered a large num-
ber of comets.

The observatory building consists of a transit room, an equatorial
room, and two computing rooms. The equatorial room is on the second
floor, and is reached by a spiral staircase.

Washburn Observatory (1886).—This fine observatory possesses a 154-
inch Clark equatorial, with filar micrometer, a Repsold meridian circle,
one sidereal and two mean-time clocks, a chronograph, chronometers,
etc., besides the excellent 6-inch equatorial which formerly belonged
to Mr. S. W. Burnham, and with which his first observations and
measurements of double stars were made. This latter equatorial,
together with a Fauth 3-inch transit, is mounted in a separate build-
ing of wood, called the students’ observatory. The main building
has, besides the rooms for the meridian circle and the large dome
for the equatorial, a separate clock and computing room, a room for
the electrical switch-board, time relays, ete., and a well furnished
room for a library and director’s study. There are also sleeping
rooms for two assistants, one of whom is the meteorological observer’
whose records are printed in the annaal volumes of the observatory.
The officers of the observatory are a director, two assistant astromoners
(one of whom is a lady), the meteorological observer, and a janitor.
The library of the observatory is maintained by the generosity of the
Hon. Cyrus Woodman, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, who has given,
for this purpose, the sum of $5,000. One half the yearly interest from
this sum is available for the purchase of new books, the other half
going to increase the principal until it reaches a specified sum. The
“publications” are printed at the expense of the State, and are issued
when circumstances warrant. Four volumes have already been issued,
and a fifth is nearly ready for publication.
ASTRONOMY. 159

The entire outfit of the observatory, in instruments and buildings, is
due to the munificence of the late Governor Cadwallader C. Washburn,
and cost not far from $50,000. <A detailed list of the cost of some of
the instruments is given in the volumes of publications of the obserya-
tory. All salaries and running expenses are paid by the regents of
the university from the general fund. These have heretofore amounted
to about $5,000 annually.

After the departure of Professor Holden, in December, 1885, the as-
sistants of the observatory, Mr. Milton Updegraff and Miss Alice Lamb,
completed the observations and reductions of the three hundred and
three star list, and the reading of the proof-sheets for the publication of
volume Ivy (1885) of the observatory reports. During the early sum-
mer of 1866 a careful study of the division errors of special diameters
of the meridian circle was undertaken; also of its horizontal flexure.
Observations of the latitude made with the meridian circle since its
first mounting show a discordance between circle east and circle west
of about 1’. Tne cause of this is now an object of study, and is be-
_ lieved to be mainly due to flexure. The large equatorial has been kept
employed upon double stars, and in January, 1887, a series of measure-
ments was made with its filar micrometer upon the position of Sappho
(80) at opposition. An index to those stars in the six Greenwich cata-
logues not occurring in Flamsteed, has been prepared by Miss Lamb,
and will be published in volume y.

The usual routine work of the observatory, such as controlling the
clocks in the city of Madison, the time bells in the university recita-
tion rooms, and the daily furnishing of time-signals to the railroads
entering Madison, has been faithfully attended to. Professor Holden’s
successor as director of the observatory is Prof. John E. Davies.

Washington University Observatory, St. Louis (1886).—Instruction in
theoretical and practical astronomy is the main object of the obsery-
atory. An extensive time-service is maintained, and the observatory
co-operates with Government field parties in geodetic work. Prof. H.
S. Pritchett has one assistant. The income is derived from the general
university endowment and from the time-service.

* Woodside Observatory.—Mr. Charles L. Woodside has a small private
observatory at East Boston, Massachusetts, its approximate position
being latitude +42° 22/ 39”; longitude 4 44™ 9° west of Greenwich.
The, principal instrument is a silvered-glass reflector of 64 inches aper-
ture and 5 feet focal length; the mirror is by Brashear, of Allegheny,
and the mounting by Mr. Woodside himself. This is to be devoted for
several years to a careful and systematic study of the colors of all stars
brighter than the sixth magnitude visible at Boston. Mr. Woodside
has devised a method of computing occultations which he has described
jn the Sidereal Messenger for Ju-y, 1886.

Yale College Observatory (1886).—For the year ending June 1, 1836,
Dr. Elkin reports progress in his work of triangulation in the Pleiades

with the 6-inch heliometer. He proposes to observe ten of the brightest
stars in the northern hemisphere for parallax. Mr. A. Hall, jr., has been
engaged in observations of Titan with the heliometer, with a view to a
new determination of the mass of Saturn.

Ziirich (1885).—Dr. Rudolf Wolf is occupied almost entirely with sun-
spot statistics. He fixes the last ‘‘maximum” of spots at 1883.9.

ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS.

Barometer coefficients for clocks.—Dr. Hilfiker has determined the
barometric coefficient—or the variation in rate for a change of 1 milli-
meter in the atmospheric pressure—for.a Winnerl clock with gridiron
pendulum comparing the Winner! clock with the H'pp normal electric
clock at Neuchatel on each night of observation.

These comparisons, made between August, 1884, and September,
1885, give an idea of the influence of the mode of compensation upon
the value of the barometric coefficient. The following table shows the
results obtained at Geneva and at several other observatories for their
normal clocks:

The new optical glass.—Nature for October 28, 1886, contains an in-
teresting account of the experiments of Professor Abbé and Dr.
Schott in their endeavors to produce a glass of such chemical compo-
sition that it may be possible to make lenses free from the secondary
chromatic aberration and other defects. For the microscope lenses
already made of the new glass Professor Abbé claims great superiority
in many important respects.-

Hlectric illumination.—Prof. Ormond Stone, of the McCormicke Ob-
servatory, uses for illuminating the circles and micrometer wires of
the great equatorial, Edison incandescent lamps of one-candle power,
run by what is known as the ‘‘Orne motor battery,” or by the *‘ Edeo
battery,” the latter being used where a more continuous light is re-
quired. The success of the experiment here has resulted in the uso
of electricity, at least for circle illumination, at West Point, Yale and
other observatories.

In the Greenwich spectroscopic observations, ‘a slip of metal coated °
ASTRONOMY. 161

with Balmain’s luminous paint, inserted immediately behind the meas-
uring pointer, has been frequently employed to give a phosphorescent
illumination of the field.”

Gautier’s mercury-basin for nadir and reflection observations, de-
scribed in last year’s report, has been tried at the Melbourne Observa-
tory, and gives highly satisfactory results.

We have already referred, in the report of the Lick Observatory, to
the completion of the 36-inch objective and its removal to Mount
Hamilton.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Astronomical prizes.—At the meeting of the Paris Academy of Science
on December 27, 1888, the Lalande prize was awarded to Dr. Backlund
for his work on Encke’s comet; the Valz prize to M. G. Bigourdan for
investigation of personal equation in the measurement of double stars;
the Damoiseau prize to M. Souillart for his theoretical researches on
Jupiter’s satellites, and an “encouragement” of 1,000 franes to .M.
Obrecht for his study of the application of photometry to the eclipses
of Jupiter’s satellites. The Bordin prize was awarded to M. RK. Radau
for his work on the theory of astronomical refraction.

The gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society was awarded to
Mr. G. W. Hill for his researches on the motion of the moon.

The Rumford medal of the Royal Society, the Rumford gold and silver
medals of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Draper
medal of the National Academy were awarded to Prof. 8. P. Langley
for his researches with the bolometer.

The Watson medal of the National Academy, with an honorarium of
$100, was awarded to Dr. B. A. Gould.

The Royal Society of Edinburgh awarded the Makdougall-Brisbane
prize to Dr. Edward Sang for his communication on the need for decimal
subdivisions in astronomy and navigation.

The Warner prizes, $100 for each comet discovered (and announced
under certain conditions), were conferred, in 1886, as follows: Mr.
Brooks, $300; Mr. Finlay, $100; Mr. Barnard, $100.

The American Astronomical Society of Brooklyn.—Among the papers
read in 1886 were: “The Earth’s Temperature,” by H. M. Parkhurst;
“ Faye’s Nebular Speculations,” by G. P. Serviss; ‘Origin of Meteor-
ites,” by G. W. Coakley and H. M. Parkhurst. The president of the
society is Mr. S. V. White, the secretary, Mr. G. P. Serviss, Brooklya,
New York.

Baltimore Amateur Astronomical Society.—A number of gentlemen
of Baltimore have organized an amateur astronomical society, meet-
ing each month for the presentation of papers and discussion of obser-
vations. Dr. Hooper, 1425 Linden avenue, the secretary, has a 5-inch
Clark equatorial; Mr. Gildersleeve a 6-inch equatorial with object-
glass by Dr. C. S. Hastings; Mr. Stahn a 4inch glass, a'so by Dr.

H. Mis. 600——11
162 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Hastings, and Mr. Numsen a 4-inch Cooke equatorial, mentioned in the
report last year under the ‘“ Denmore Observatory.” Physical obser-
vations are made of the sun, moon, planets, and comets. Mr. Stahn
has kept a record of sun-spots, and has devised numerous ingenious
accessories for his instruments.

Astronomical Journals.—The reissue of the “Astronomical Jour.
nal” by Dr. Gould is cordially welcomed, particularly by American
astronomers, who are thereby furnished with a more prompt means
of intercommunication than has been heretofore available. An inter-
val of twenty-five years occurs after No. 144; and No. 145, bearing the
date of November 2, 1886, begins volume vil. The Journal is edited
by Dr. Gould, as before, at Cambridge, Massachusetts.

A new monthly astronomical review, Revista do Observatorio, has
appeared, under the editorship of Dr. Luis Cruls, of the Imperial Ob-
servatory of Rio Janeiro. The journal will be found interesting and
valuable by amateurs and those interested in the progress of astron-
omy, as well as by professional astronomers.

We are at the same time obliged to record the discontinuance of the
Astronomical Register, with the completion of its twenty-fourth vol-
ume, December, 1886, No. 288.

The Influence of astigmatism on Astronomical Observations.—It ap-
pears from Professor Seeliger’s researches that this malformation in the
eye, which is far from uncommon, exerts a greater influence on astro-
nomical measurements than is generally supposed. Thus, he shows
that a systematic error in a series of observed declinations amounting
to 0/’.26 may very well be due to it; and it appears that the discordances
in observed position angles of double stars—depending on the inclina-
tion of the line joining the components to the vertical—with which the
measures of some observers are affected, may be referred to the same
cause. (Nature, November 18, 1886.)

Determination of time.—Dollen has described in the Nachrichten
(114: 289) an expeditious method of obtaining a clock correction where
great refinement is not necessary. The observation is made in the ver-
tical of the pole-star, and tables have been published by the Pulkowa
Observatory giving for some sixty odd stars all the quantities which
are independent of the latitude, required in the formule. The work of
reduction is made as brief as possible.

An astronomical directory.—M. A. Lancaster, the librarian of the
Brussels Observatory, has published a very useful list of observato-
ries, their geographical co-ordinates, and the astronomers attached to
them; of astronomical societies and institutions, and of reviews and
journals specially devoted to astronomy. The little book contains also
a list of names and addresses of astronomers not attached to any ob-
servatory, and of amateurs, as well as a list of makers of astronomical
instruments.

Miss Olerke’s admirable ‘ Popular History of Astronomy during the
ASTRONOMY. 163

Nineteenth Century” has been so widely reviewed that it seems unnee-
essary to do more than merely to mention it by title here. The book
is “ untechnical,” and the “ terse and vigorous ” style makes it most in-
teresting from beginning to end. There are numerous references to
the original sources of information.

ASTRONOMICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, 1886.

The following bibliography is arranged by subjects, and contains jour-
nal articles and reprints from transactions of societies, as well as more
formal publications. No pretense is made to completeness, even to the
extent of including all titles that have come under the compiler’s no-
tice, and, in some cases, where it has not been possible to examine the
publications themselves, the imprints, etc., may be imperfect. The
prices quoted are generally taken from Friedlinder’s Naturz Novitates,
in German “mark” (lL mark = 100 pfennige = 1 frane 25 centimes = 25
cents, nearly).

it is hoped that the abbreviated titles of journals will be intelligible
without special explanation. (‘*Compt. Rend.” is, of course, the
Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l’ Académie des sciences,
Paris, and *“ Month. Not.” the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronoin-
ical Society.) Among the imprint and other abbreviations there occur:

Bd. = Band. n. F. =neue Folge.
d.= die, der, del, ete. n. Ss. = new series.
ed. = edition. p. = page.
hrsg. — herausgegeben. Pp = page of this summary.
il. = illustrated. pl. = plates.
k. k. = kaiserlich kéniglich. pt. = part.
Lfg. == Lieferung. Rev. = Review.
M. =mark. 8. =series.
n. d.=no date. sh. = shilling.
n. p.=no place of publication. v. = volume.

The alphabetical arrangement is made to serve as an index to the
present record, by inserting after the subject-heading, the pages of this
review (p*—) on which the different subjects are noticed.

In the references to journals the volume and page are simply sepa-
rated by a colon; thus: 5:81 indicates volume 5, page 81.

By NEtson H. DarRTON.

INTRODUCTORY.

The preparation of this review was undertaken by the writer with
serious misgivings as to his ability either to complete it in the time al-
lotted, or to reduce the results of a year’s activity in the various branches
of geologic research to the space assigned ; and the outcome is in sev-
eral respects unsatisfactory.

It was originally intended to inelude a bibliography of North Amer-
ican geology for the year 1886; but as the work progressed, this was
found to be impossible without greatly exceeding the space assigned
to the review. It was, however, believed that the bibliography would
be of such value to the geologists of this and other countries as to war-
rant its separate publication. Accordingly, it was annotated, so mod-
ified as to include a subject-index under the same alphabetic arrange-
ment as the author’s bibliography, and so extended as to become ex-
haustive for North America; and thus modified it will form Bulletin No.
44 of the U. S. Geological Survey.

It was originally intended, also, to include in this review a résumé of
the foreign contributions of the year to geologic philosophy; but this,
too, finally proved impracticable, partly on account of the inaccessibil-
ity of much of the literature, and partly on account of the limits of
space and time.

By reason of hurried preparation, the abstracts in this review are
often less full than seems desirable, and by reason of the character of
the material the abstracts are generally presented more or less discon-
nectedly. It is believed, however, that all important publications dis-
tributed during 1886, or bearing that date and received early in the
present year, are noticed in the following pages. With the exception
of a few words of introduction or connection, the writer has acted sim-
ply as an abstractor, and has endeavored to avoid bias or partiality.

QUATERNARY.

1. No subject in American geology is now receiving more attention
than that including the many interesting problems of the Quaternary.
Each year brings forth a considerable mass of literature in which con-

tributions are made to this subject. In an address before the Ameri-
can Association in 1886, Chamberlin* summarized the results attained
up to that time, especially those relating to drift phenomena. The
following is a very brief abstract of his conclusions: Three phases
are recognized in the course of the undulatory drift border: (1) a
thickened edge or terminal moraine; (2) a thin margin; and (3) an
attenuated border of scattered pebbles. The morainic border prevails
from the Atlantic to the Ohio, while attenuated borders reach thence
to the Rocky Mountains. Attenuated borders delimit an earlier ice-
incursion, and the morainic border a later one. The interval be-
tween the two principal glacial epochs is represented by changes
of orographic attitude and drainage ; by different degrees of erosion,
decomposition, and ferrugination; and by vegetal accumulations and
lacustrine oscillations. The chief interglacial epoch was marked by
great erosion. The drifts are grouped into the earlier, embracing two
or more subdivisions, and the later, embracing several subordinate
phases; also a third series, embracing the Great Basin deposits of
aqueous origin. Of bowldery clays at least three genetic classes are
recognized: (1) the subglacial; (2) the englacial or superglacial; (3)
the subaqueous ; and perhaps (4) tills ridged transversely by the thrust
of the margin of the ice. Of moraines, terminal, lateral, medial, and
interlobate are described; and of forms cf ~vound moraine the following
are enumerated: (1) till tamuli; (2) mammillary and lenticular hills; (3)
elongated parallel ridges; (4) drift billows; (5) crag and tail; (6) pre-
crag and combings; and (7) veneered hills; the first three being grouped
under the term “drumlins.” Of the assorted drifts, two classes com-
monly embraced are excluded: (1) the “orange sands,” commonly
regarded as Champlain deposits, because there is great uncertainty in
regard to their age, and good reason to believe that they are not Cham-
plain; (2) drifts reworked by non glacial agencies. Omitting these, two
classes there are recognized; (1) those that gathered immediately within
and beneath the ice body itseif, or against its margin, and (2) those
borne to distances beyond its limit by glacial drainage. Of the first,
there are the products (a) of superglacial streams; (b) of moulins ; (¢) of
subglacial streams; (d) of streams in ice-canons; and (e) debouchure
deposits at the glacial margin. The importance of the distinction be-
tween kames and osars is urged. Of valley drift the intermediate
phases are passéd over, and attention is directed to two extreme
phases: (a) the moraine-headed valley trains and (b) the loess, the
former the deposit of vigorous glacial floods, the latter inferred to be
the product of slack drainage. Attention is directed to the ice-blocked
ancient lakes, especially of the greater basins, to the overflow phenom-
ena, and to the difference between ancient and existing water levels.
Finally, the current interpretations of glacial phenomena, and specula-

NORTH AMERICAN GEOLOGY. += Sit

tions respecting the origin of the glacial epoch are discussed, and the
hypothesis that the regional refrigeration of the glacial time was
brought about by shifting of the terrestrial poles is favorably presented.

2. In a paper on “ North America in the Ice Period” * Newberry dis-
cusses the iceberg theory and glacial climate, and states very forcibly
the objections to the former and to Whitney’s theory of the latter. It
is shown that the iceberg theory is inapplicable to the mountainous
districts of the West, and can not be reconciled to such phenomena in
the Hast as (1) the widely different altitudes of glaciation within short
distances ; (2) the entire independence of the principal glacial features
of altitude in the vicinity of the terminal moraine ; (3) the driftless area
of Wisconsin; (4) the complete absence of marine shells in the inland
drift deposits; and (5) the characteristic effects of the erosion when
compared with glaciers now in existence.

3. Branner makes some very interesting observations on the relation
of topography to the glacial flow in the Wyoming and Lackawanna
valleys, Pennsylvania, a district of sharp relief and numerous rock
outcrops. Two systems of striz are found, one parallel to the general
southward slope of the country, and produced by the flow of the great
mass of ice in that direction, and another system determined entirely
by the local topography, and apparently due to the effect cf the latter
upon the ice sheet when it was greatly reduced in thickness.t

The same writer{ discusses the greatest elevation of glaciation in
northeastern Pennsylvania, finding that the glacier overrode peaks
2,200 feet in height, which White and Lewis considered islands above
the level of glaciation. These peaks are the Elk Mountains. Careful
search has revealed unquestionable glacial striz on one of their sum-
mits.

4. Britton § finds driftless areas at a moderate height on the serpen-
tine hills of Staten Island, a few miles north of the terminal moraine,
which indicate a thickness of the ice of less than 200 feet.

5. Ina paper on the geology of Cincinnati,|| James gives some in-
teresting information on the local surface geology of that district, and,
in view of the absence of glacial drift from the tops of some of the hills,
doubts White’s estimate that the glacial dam of the Ohio stood 645 feet
above low water, as these hills are only 460 feet above at the highest
point.

6. Salisbury discusses the distribution of drift copper in the Northwest.
As far as reported, it occurs over an area of nearly half a million square
miles, extending as far as 600 miles south, and several hundred miles
east and west, of Lake Superior. Fragments are especially plentiful at

Grand Traverse Bay, at the mouth of the Llinois River, and along the
lower part of the Wabash; but this may be due to fuller records from
these places. In general, it is found that the size of the masses de-
creases as their distance from the Lake Superior region increases, and
it is thought that, with some possible local exceptions, the latter has
been its source.*

7.In apaper on the geology in the vicinity of the Northern Pacific
Railroad, Newberryt gives an account of his observations on the drift.
In the Yellowstone Valley he was unable to find the evidences of the
eastern drift reported by C. A. White, and considers the drift of the
upper Missouri local in character.

8. Comstock describes some features of the drift in the Rocky Mount-
ains of Wyoming and Colorado. All the glacial action is inferred to
have been local, but intense. In the San Juan district, and to a less
extent elsewhere, a ‘distinct peculiarity lies in the duplex character cf
the erosion; that is to say, there are two zones of glaciation vertically,
the upper largely representing the transportative action, the lower
being eroded without removal of the débris to any extent. The imper-
fect drainage had fastened the ice sheet so that it could move as a unit
only in the superficial portion, while the lower part acted like a slowly
working plow, which cut deeply but not so extensively as the overlying
mass. In the more elevated tracts, therefore, the lower portion often
lies in grooves like cwls-de-sac, and many of these exist to-day, connected
with the main drainage often by reversed or indirect drainage.” ¢

9. In his paper on the Post-tertiary elevation of the Sierra Nevada,
‘ Le Conte incidentally discusses the later history of the Mississippi
Basin. He coneludes that during the Champlain period it was filled
with 400 feet or more of deposits; that in the terrace period elevation
took place, and the present wide channel was cut,—not by cliff erosion
as in the Grand Cajon, but by shifting of the stream from side to side,
and that in the present epoch there has been subsidence and, as shown
by Hilgard, a refilling with about fifty feet of alluvium.§

10. Ina paper on the Geology of Long Island, F. J. H. Merrill makes the
interesting statement that the morainal hills owe their elevation in great
part to a series of folds at right angles to the course of the glacier, and
involving the pre-glacial deposits. The deep bays in the north shore
of the island appear to have been plowed across these flexed beds, and
are found to be heavily flanked by ridges and hills. From the thinness
of the till deposits south of Long Island Sound (except opposite its
western extremity) it is thought that the depression was pre-glacial,
and the ice sheet lost the loads of detritus in its lower portion and
attached to its base in passing over the broader part of the Sound,
only carrying across the bowlders and débris upon its surface. The

stratified beds composing the greater mass of the formations of the
island are unconformably overlain by the drift, but although they yield
* some fossils, their age is considered uncertain. Some of the clays ex-
posed along the north shore may be Cretaceous, and other clays and
sands are thought to be Tertiary, while the greater mass of the strati-
fied sands and gravels are thought to represent the Post-pliocene of
Sankaty Head and Gardiner’s Island.*

11. The same author reports the preliminary results of a detailed study
of the Quaternary and recent formation of the coast region of New Jer-
sey, made under the direction of the State geologist, Professor Cook.t
An account is given of the subsidence of the coast and the variations in
its rate. It is found also that the ocean shore is wearing away and the
winds and waves cause its recession westward. Beach and strand
formation is discussed, and descriptions are given of the several beaches
and their recent changes.

12. In the introduction to this report t Professor Cook discusses the
terraces of the coastal plain. They occur from 40 to 60 feet above tide,
and it has been determined that they slope southward at the rate of
three inches to the mile. It is thought that the higher terraces mark
the position of the ocean level at the close of the glacial period, and
that there has been an uplift between that time and the present subsi-
dence.

13. On the northeastern corner of Staten Island Britton finds the
morainal beds capping the finely stratified sands and clays along a line
of contact between 25 and 30 feet above tide, indicating at least that
amount of elevation since the glacial period, but there are other de-
posits of pre-glacial drift of much greater elevation on the island, and
some other areas have been recently discovered.§

14, In a paper on the geology of Washington and vicinity, McGee
gives an account of the Quaternary formations of that district. The city
lies on the terraces of an amphitheater extending back from the Poto-
mac. Up to an elevation of about 160 feet there is found a well-defined
Quaternary deposit to which the name Columbia formation is applied.
Its upper portion consists of loam or brick clay, varying from nothing to
20 or 30 feet in thickness; and its lower, of sand, gravel, and bowlder
beds, from a trifle to 20 feet in thickness, all more or less stratified
throughout. It is thought that it represents a subaqueous delta of the
Potomac River, deposited during the period of formation of the terraces.
Its absence from above tide on the eastern side of the amphitheater is
attributed to a dislocation bounding the coastal plain, of which other
- evidence is also found.||

15. Smith describes a bed of clay inclosed in the Delaware gravels
near Philadelphia. It contains remains of trees of species now living,
and appears to be similar in age to the other clay beds farther up the
Delaware valley.*

16. Dwight describes some very curious structural features in Cham-
plain depesits in the Hudson valley near Newburgh. At the locality de-
scribed there are three huge clay-filled pot-holes in a sand bed. These
holes are in line, close together and elliptical in outline, with their
longer axes at right angles to the Hudson. They appear to be in a
faulted block of the sand, and the fault line on one side is marked by a
hard wall composed of sand cemented by carbonate of lime.t

17. Ashburner and Hill¢ describe the buried valley of the Susque-
hanna between Pittston and Kingston, in Luzerne County, Pa., and
discuss the former channel of that river and its peculiarities: Ash-
burner describes the Archbald pot-holes in the same vicinity, and from
their position considers them either due to water flowing beneath the
glacier or over its edge.§

18. Dawson describes the bowlder drift and sea margins at Little
Metis, Lower St. Lawrence. The bowlder drift occurs in belts exposed
at low tide, and extending out to some distance from the shore. The first
or shore terrace seldom holds bowlders, but farther inland there is a ter-
race 30 feet higher, consisting of sand resting on hard bowlder clay or
till, the latter sometimes being filled with bowlders and at others with
marine shells. Higher up huge bowlders are found perched upon the
bare rocks, the latter being rough and showing no sign of polishing
except near the second terrace. It is thought that these phenomena
can not be ascribed to land ice, and are similiar to those of the Lower
St. Lawrence generally, except in some lateral valleys on the northern
shore, where local glaciers appear to have descended. ||

19. Lamplugh describes the glacial shell beds of British Columbia,
adding detail to Dawson’s previous descriptions. The beds at Esqui-
mault, Vancouver’s Island, lie in a gully in polished and striated dio-
rite. The shells are abundant in the lower layers of the clays, and
decreasing in number upward, are absent ten feet from the surface. It
is thoug!t that the beds were shoved up into this gully by the ice in
its flow down the channel, as they dip steeply shoreward and are often
disturbed.

20. Gilbert has discussed two instances of post-glacial deformation.
First, in a paper on the inculeation of scientific method by example,
he incidentally investigates the cause of the elevation of the center
of the Bonneville Basin. It is supposed that this great Quaternary

lake slightly depressed the earth’s crast, and that on its evaporation
the normal conditions were resumed and the lake bed and terraces
elevated.* The same writer called the attention of. the American As-
sociation to several small anticlinal ridges in the rocks of western
New York, which are believed to have resulted from horizontal expan-
sion of superficial strata consequent on post-glacial amelioration of
climate.t

21. Niagara Falls.—At the Buffalo meeting of the American Associa-
tion there was a general - discussion of the various questions connected
with the chronology of Niagara Falls, which was taken part in by Gil-
bert, Chamberlin, Hall, Pohlman, Claypole, Woodward, Wright, Davis,
Comstock, and Holly. It wasshown by Gilbert that the Niagara River
probably began its work at the close of the glacial period, when the
retreating ice opened the St. Lawrence Valley and separated the two
lakes, Erie being held back by the Niagara escarpment. Consequently
the age of the Niagara River is a measure of Post-quaternary time.
The rate of recession determined by comparison of a recent survey by
Woodward with those of Hall in 1842 and the United States Engi-
neers in 1875 would require seven thousand years for the excavation
of the 6 miles of gorge. A number of considerations, however, qualify
this estimate, and they are summarized as follows:

“‘ At stages of recession earlier than the present there was a thinner
body of limestone to be undermined and removed; there was a deeper
exposed body of shale; the water plunged from a greater height; the
water was concentrated in a narrower channel; it carried more floating
ice; and all these differences tended to make the rate of recession faster,
The rate may also have been influenced by variations in the amount of
detrital load (a tool of erosion), by variations in the solvent power of
the water, and by variations of its volume due to changes of climate or
catchment basin. The catchment basin was formerly ‘extended by in-
cluding part of the area of the ice sheet, but it may have been abridged

by the partial diversion of Laurentian drainage to other courses.
“The problem admits of expression in an equation :

22. Pohlman advances the opinion that in pre-glacial time a small lake
occupied the valley between the Niagara and Corniferous escarpments,
and drained northward along the line of the present Niagara gorge as
far as the whirlpool, and thence down the now drift-filled valley to St.
David’s. There appears to have been no great cataract, but three
small falls over the ledges of hard beds, and the stream was joined at
the whirlpool by a branch from the present lower channel. The chan-
nel of the Niagara above the Falls was apparently in part cut by the
reversal of this drainage into Lake Erie by some agency of the ice age.

These opinions lead to the conclusion that after the lakes were sepa-
rated at the close of the glacial period the Niagara River had only to
clean out the drift-filled channels of the main pre-glacial streim to the
whirlpool and thence of its branch to the present outlet. This explana-
tion of the history of the Niagara gorge would greatly decrease the time
estimate, but as the amount of work accomplished by the pre-glacial
drainage is not known, no figures can be suggested.*

23. Claypole discusses the drainage relations of the great lakes, and
shows that Chicago would be at their foot rather than head if the ele-
vation at Black Rock, near Buffalo, was 20-odd feet higher, so as to
cause the drainage of the lakes te flow through the Chicago River into
the Mississippi. It is thought that the channel was cut in its present
position owing to a glacial ice dam in the Straits of Mackinaw during
the retreat of the glacier, which prevented the westward flow and ne-
cessitated the excavation of the present channel.t

24. Lake Lahontan.—Russell’s long-delayed monographit on Lake La-
hontan has at last appeared, and the many matters of interest connected
with this great fossil lake are discussed in detail. The various ques-
tions of sedimentation, shore phenomena, chemical deposition, ete., are
treated at length in their bearing on the history of the lake, the whole
forming a most important contribution to geologic science. It is only
possible here to give a general résumé of the principal conclusions,
The lake filled a compound orographie basin, resulting from the tilting
of faulted blocks, and received the drainage from many thousands of
square miles of surrounding country, with its mechanical load and mat-
ter in solution. Its history is taken up at a time of long aridity, which
was followed by a period in which the water covered nearly its maxi-
mum area and deposited lacustrine marls and clays exceeding 150 feet
in thickness. It then evaporated away, with many minor oscillations,
and deposited vast quantities of impure carbonate of lime in a stony
form of tufa termed lithoid, while stream channels were carved in the
lacustral beds and current-bedded gravels and sands were superimposed
on the previously formed beds. Another rise of the lake followed, with
the deposition of another lacustral series, and when about half-way to

its former level it appears to have been highly charged with saline mat-
ter, which was deposited as a crystalline tufa, of which thinolite is the
pseudomorph. This stage was probably closed by a rise of the lake and
consequent diiution, and the dentritic tufa was deposited, overlapping
the thinolitic and extending up against the lithoid. The rise continued
and the lake finally attained its highest level, covering an area of over
8,000 square miles, with a depth at greatest of 886 feet. It then carved
the Lahontan terrace, after which it evaporated away, probably to com-
plete dessication, forming terraces at different altitudes and depositing
a thin coat of tufa. The present lakes are of recent origin.

25. Voleanic dust deposits in the West.—In an examination of some
Pliocene sandstones, collected by Peale in Montana and Idaho, G. P.
Merrill* discovered that they are principally composed of particles of
voleani¢ glass and other finely fragmental products of vulcanism. It was
soon after found that the sand adhering to fossil bones in the Niobrara,
Loup Fork, and Sweetwater regions was of similar composition, and
other sandstones of the same character were received from Arizona,
Colorado, and from Norton and Phillips County, Kansas, showing the
wide distribution of deposits of this kind in the West.

26. Peale, in a letter to Science, describes Montana deposits similar
to the Loup Fork beds. The volcanic dust in both instances appears
to have been ejected high into the air from some vent and to have fallen
directly into the lake, as the fineness of the particles bears no relation
to the proximity of the ancient shore.{

27. Todd announces the discovery of beds of voicanie dust in Ne-
braska, where they are associated with what appear to be ice-floe beds
of drift. He considers them to have been deposited during the Quater-
nary, and probably at one stage of King’s Lake Cheyenne.{

SOUTHERN TERTIARY.

The controversy on the order of succession of the Tertiary beds of the
Gulf States is still kept up by Meyer, who persists in his theory that the
Grand Gulf group is the base of the series, in opposition to many ob-
servers.

28. Hilgard, in a letter to Science, severely criticises Meyer for neglect-
ing the previous literature and persistently ignoring well-known facts
disproving his theory. He declares, for instance, that the statement,
pointedly made and verified innumerable times, that ‘the sandstone of
the Grand Gulf group is found overlying the Vicksburg strata gener-
ally along the southern line of the Vicksburg group” is entirely disre-
garded, although Meyer was often near the outcrops at which this could
be plainly seen; and again, that in referring to the re appearance of the
Jackson shell bed at one point on the Chickasaw River south of the

main belt, Meyer entirely overlooks the fact that it is there directly over-
lain by the very characteristic Orbitoides limestone of the Vicksburg
group, under which it disappears south ward.*

29. A few months later Langdon describes a section along the Pearl
River, observed at very low water, from Jackson to Yazoo City, in which
w general southern dip is found, and the Jackson beds underlie the Orbi-
toides limestone, although the exact contact was not observed. Sections
are described at St. Stephen’s Bluff, Bladen’s Springs, near Enterprise,
west of Meridian and near Claiborne, confirming the general opinion as
to the relations of the Vicksburg, Jackson, and Claiborne beds.t

30. In July Meyer makes another contribution to the question, giving
an account of a special visit to the region. Owing to high water in the
rivers he was obliged to rely upon exposures in railroad cuts but found
the latter very satisfactory. An abstract of his results is as follows:
Between Pelahatchee and Brandon the Grand Gulf strata are found
for five miles at a higher level than the Marine Tertiary west of it, and
which are either nearly horizontal or dip strongly westward. At Bran-
don the marine strata dip over the grand gulf clays, and at the contact
have only a thickness of two feet. He can not find a single instance in
which the Grand Gulf may be seen in actual superposition on the Ma-
rine Tertiary, but on the contrary finds two localities where strata which
can not be distinguished from Grand Gulf may be seen actually overlain
by Marine Tertiary, and in one case unconformably.

The Grand Gulf formation is considered to be, at least in greater part,
non-marine. A thick and extended marine greensand formation is found
in eastern Mississippi, which carries a Claibornian fauna approaching
the Jacksonian, and is thougbt to be parallel to the strata immediately
below the claibornian profile. ¢

31. Heilprin reports on Tertiary fossils from several localities in the
Gulf States. Some specimens from San Augustine County, Tex., are
thought to represent the “ Claibornian” horizon, and are from deposits
probably in the Jacksonian area. Some specimens from Paducah,
Ky., indicate the Lower Eocene; and N. Floridanus and other species
from near Gainesville, Florida, confirm his opinion of the broad ex-
tent of the southern Nummelitic formation and the relative antiquity of
the Florida peninsula.§ The same author has issued the second part of
his paper on the west coast of Florida|| in advance of the first; but this
incomplete publication can not fairly receive attention in this review.

which it is stated that the peninsula does not consist of a sand bank
deposited upon a coral reef, but of Tertiary and more recent strata con-
tinuous with these formations farther north and west.

MESOZOIC OF THE EASTERN UNITED STATES,

Trias.—Many of the important questions connected witlt this familiar
formation still remain unanswered, but over most of its area several
systematic surveys have been in progress for some time, and interesting
results may be expected from Davis’s investigations in the Connecticut
valley, Darton’s detailed study of the New Jersey and New York dis-
trict, and Rassell’s researches on the Richmond coal field and in the
Southern States.

33. During the past year Davis has proposed a hypothesis to account
for the general monoclinal structure of the Trias, especially of the
east-dipping beds of the Connecticut Valley. He finds in this district
that the formation is traversed by numerous faults, mostly with the up-
throw on the eastern side and parallel to the belts of crystalline rocks
which form the Trias basin, and strike under and across it at a small
angle. The Triassic rocks were originally deposited on the smoothed-
off upturned edges of these crystalline rocks, and the hypotheses de-
mand that, when the latter yielded to a deep-seated horizontal pressure,
the bottom of the basin was deformed and the formation faulted. The
mechanism of this process is explained as follows:

When the whole mass was crushed, so as to diminish its measure from
east to west, it may be supposed that one of the easiest ways of yield-
ing to the crush was by alittle slipping of slab on slab, whereby their
inclination should steepen and their horizontal measure decrease. If
the crushing were more severe near the surface than at great depths,
a Shearing force would be introduced, that might, if necessary, throw
theslabs over past the vertical, and thus produce reversed dips. As
slab slips on slab, the formerly horizontal beveled surface of every one
is canted over, so as to dip in one direction at an angle equal to the
change of the inclination of the slabs ; and the surface of every slab is
separated from that of its neighbors by faults with upthrow on the
side of the direction of dip. The Triassic cover is uot strong enough
to bridge across from ridge to ridge of the uneven surface thus pro-
duced; its weight is much greater than its strength can bear, and it
perforce follows the deformation of its foundation, and thereby acquires
a faulted monoclinal attitude. The explanation of the Triassic mono-
clinal may therefore be included in the following general statement.
Wherever unconformable masses are deformed together, the structure
given to the lesser relatively superficial mass must depend in great
part on the changes in the surface shape of the greater deeper mass
below.*

The principal evidence in favor of this hypothesis is the occurrence
of the observed faults and their parallelism with the belts of crystalline
rocks which strike across the Triassic areas at a small angle. ‘These

* American Assoc. Proc., vol. 35, pp. 224-227; Am. Jour. Sci., 11, vol. 32, pp. 342-352,
200 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

faults are only determinable in the trap shee's of the formation, and it
is found that the curvature of these and the overlap of their various
outerops is caused by the slight and varying d.fferences between the .
range of the fault lines and the strike of the beds.

The discovery of these faults indicate that the thickness of the forma-
tion in the Connecticut Valley is very much less than formerly supposed,
for the repetition of beds produced by the upthrow of the dislocations
is always on the side of the direction of dip, allowing a moderate thick-
ness of strata to cover a broad surface area, and causing frequent out-
crops of the edges of the four or five trap sheets.

34.° The old notion that all the Triassic traps were intrusive is dying
out, largely owing to the work of Davis, who has found that in the Conn.
ecticut Valley the greater part of the trap has been poured out in broad
sheets as contemporaneous lava flows, end has pointed cut the proba-
bility that the great masses forming the mountains in New Jersey are
of the same character ; a conclusion which is reached also by Iddings*
from a study of the columnar structure and microscopic character of
one of the sheets near Orange, New Jersey. ‘

The Holyoke trap ranges of the Connecticut Valley have been con-
sid_red overflows by Hitchcock and Davis, and this opinion is confirmed
by Emersont from a very detailed study in Massachusetts, where he
finds the trap to consist of two sheets. Ricet gives an account of the
relations found in the same ridge where it is crossed by the Farmington
River, in Connecticut, and the two sheets and the surface features of the
lower flow are exposed.

35, The question of the age of the Trias is as yet certainly known only
in a general way. Newberry considers the formation the equivalent of
Rhetic beds of Germany from its flora, and states that while its fish
remains are mostly peculiar, they are more closely related to the Jura
and Cretaceous of the older world than to the Permian, and in the
Connecticut Valley represent groups confined to the foreign Jura. He
finds also that representatives of the Muschelkalk and Bunter are
wanting in the United States, and he considers the Ammonites, ete.,
of Humboldt County, Nev., and the plants of Abiquiu, New Mex.
ico, and Los Broces, Sonora, to be Upper Triassic. He points out
that since no distinctly marked Jurassic fossils have been found east of
the Mississippi, and since the well-marked Jurassic of the Black Hills,
Utah, ete., overlies the Trias, tue use of the term Jura-Trias seems un-
warranted; and hé supposes that the Permian proper of Europe, as
represented by the Zechstein and cupriferous schists, has not been
found in America, and that there is here a break between the Upper
Carboniferous and the Trias.§

36. Younger Mesozoic.—The age of the New Jersey clays and marls has
been briefly discussed by Cook,* Whitfield,t and Newberry.t The lat-
ter considers the marls equivalent to the chalk of Europe and the
marine Cretaceous of Colorado. Whitfield sees no reason to ‘“ dispute
the notion generally held that the lower marl bed of the State is
equivalent to ‘No. 4,’ or the Fort Pierre group of the Upper Missouri.”
Newberry states his opinion that the Raritan clays are at the horizon
of the upper greensand of Hurope and the Dakota of the West; an
opinion shared by Cook. Whitfield thinks the fauna is in some re-
spects allied to that of the Jura, and is inclined to consider the group
the Eastern representative of that formation.

37. McGee, in a paper on the geology of Washington and vicinity, de-
scribes the newer Mesozoic, which occupies a wide area in that district
and is there called the Potomac formation. The upper part is made
up of highly colored clays, with sand and gravel; the lower part is
sand and gravel, with intercalations of clay. Stratification is often ab-
sent, and the materials are sometimes intermingled. The formation
appears “to consist of inosculating deltas of the Potomac and other
Atlantic-coast rivers and the littoral deposits into which they merge,
laid down along a bay-indented coast upon a highly inclined and irreg-
ular sea-bottom, produced by combined depression and seaward tilting
of a deeply corraded surface in late Jurassic or early Cretaceous time.”§
Newberry considers the Potomac formation Neocomian in age.

PALEOZOIC OF EASTERN NORTH AMERICA.

33. President Dawson, in his address before the British Association,
discussed the origin of the American Paleozoic sediments, and stated
his preference for the theory that they were derived from Arctic
lands and deposited similarly to the great sand banks of the Atlantic
coast. Hull.|| in a letter to Nature, opposes this idea on the ground of
the character of the deposits and the inadequacy of the currents,
especially if there was no coast to determine their course. He restates
his opinion that the sediments were deposited off-shore from a very
wide land surface in the region of the present Atlantic Ocean, “ toward
which the sediments thicken, and opposite to that in which the lime-
stones are most developed.”4{ Dana** and Le Contett disagree with
_ Dawson and Hull in considering the Paleozoic land surface to have

included all or part of the Archean now exposed in New England and
southward, and not to have extended any great distance eastward.

09, Shaler describes the geology of the Cobscook Bay district, near
Eastport, Maine, where he finds a series including Devonian, Silurian,
and perhaps Archean members, intermingled at various horizons with
lava flows, intruded sheets and dikes, and at some points with beds of
fragmental volcanic rocks, as ash and breccia. The sedimentary rocks—
are in greater part fine-grained sandstones and dark-colored shales, with
occasional thin beds of limestone. The ash beds are found interbedded
with fossiliferous strata at several horizons, and one bed, just below a
shale tentatively referred to the Hamilton, is 500 feet in thickness. The
volcanic activity appears to have been greatest to the northeastward, as
the extravasated matter decreases in amount in the opposite direction.
The igneous rocks are in greater part felsites and felsite porphyries, but
other varieties are found. The entire stratified series, with a very few
exceptions, has an easterly dip of from 20° to 60°, and the beds are
much compressed and their fossils contorted. The principal faults
range NNE. and SSW., with a subordinate series at right angles, and
the dikes generally occur along the fault lines. Provisional names have
been applied to the formations, but there is still some doubt about their
relation to each other and to other beds along the coast. The basal
rocks are crystalline and thought to be Laurentian. Upon them lie
what is termed the Campobello group, consisting of about 4,000 feet at
least of slaty beds without observed fossils, and probably Cambrian or
Siluro-Cambrian in age. They are unconformably overlain by the Cobs-
cook group, which also has a thickness of about 4,000 feet. Its upper
part yields a Devonian fauna somewhat resembling that of the Hamil-
ton, and the Lower Helderberg and other Silurian groups are thought
to be recognized farther down; but the species are mixed and not al-
ways determinable. The uppermost group is the Perry series, which
constitutes over 2,000 feet of coarse red sandstones, conglomerates, and
reddish shales, apparently Upper Devonian or Subcarboniferous.*

40. At a meeting of the New Brunswick Natural History Society,t
Matthew states that on Frye’s Island he has recognized the same suc-
cession of Silurian strata as is found on the Mascarine shore of Passa-
maquoddy Bay, and that the belt of red conglomerate extending from
Black’s Harbor toward Eastport is Devonian.

41. Inareport of studies of parts of northern and western New Bruns-
wick, Bailey describes the distribution, stratigraphy, and structure of
the several formations and discusses their horizons. The Carboniferous
is represented in its upper part by gray sandstones, grading downward
into bright-red conglomerates and shales of the Lower Carboniferous,
which also contains great masses of volcanic material, and in some lo-
calities beds of limestone and gypsum. The supposed Devonian is rep-

resented by a very limited area yielding plant remains. The Silurian
consists In greater part of slate, with thick beds of limestone, approxi-
mately Lower Helderberg in age. The members of the Cambrian-Silu-
rian series are mostly slates and sandstones greatly disturbed, and in
some places graduating into beds of micaceous schists.*

42, Messrs. Seely and Brainard describe the geology in the vicinity of
Fort Cassin, Vermont, near the shore of Lake Champlain. The district
is one of simple monoclinal structure, with gentle dips. The strata are
Lower Silurian limestone, some beds of which yielded a fauna of many
new species, which are described and figured by Whitfield, who also dis-
cusses the horizon of the beds.t

43. Darton, ina paper on the Upper Silurian at Cornwall Station, Orange
County, New York, describes an outlier of Lower Helderberg limestone
lying upon beds of conglomerates and shales, forming an outlier far dis-
tant from the main mass of the formation. The Water-Lime, Pentame-
rous and Delthyris Shaly are recognized by abundant fauna. The beds
are uptilted at a high angle, and the greatest exposed thickness is about
100 feet, the outerop having a length of about half a mile along a NNE.

age of the fossiliferous limestone associated with the Green Pond Mount-
ain series at Upper Longwood, and in Newfoundland, New Jersey, which

westward extension of rocks of Lower Helderberg age in New York.
He finds the group, including all above the Water- Lime, to be represented
at least as far west as Cayuga Lake by limestones not less than 65 feet
in thickness, and carrying an unmistakable fauna. The gypsiferous
limestone of Cayuga County holds a mixed Tentaculite and Lower
Pentamerous fauna. Atthe outlet of Skaneateles Lake and at the Oris-
kany Falls, near Utica, the formation is represented by the Tentaculite
limestones, which at the last-named place is overlain by mixed Lower
Pentamerous and Delthyris Shaly. From the increasing indistinctness
of the divisions, and the predominance of the lower portion of the
Lower Helderberg to the westward and of the Salina Group to the
eastward, it is concluded that the two groups may have been deposited
simultaneously, or at least soin part.|| Tbe same author, ina paper on
the Tully limestone of New York, calls attention to its outcrop line and
flexures, and gives an account of its fauna, which includes 120 species.]

either thin rapidly from its outcrop or inerease considerably in dip.*

46, Wrightt gives an account of a salt mine at Piffard,in western New
York, where a shaft has been sunk 1,105 feet to beds of salt which ag-
gregate 80 feet in thickness within 200 feet.

Wohlmann finds that Sherwood has overlooked the occurrence of
Oriskany in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, for he has been able to
trace it for some miles in an inconspicuous ridge on both sides of the
ereat anticlinal, and separating the Lower Helderberg and Marcellus,
which are shown to come together on the Second Geological Survey
map.t

47. The Clinton group of Ohio is the subject of a memoir by Foerst,
and while it is only preliminary to a more extended and detailed
report, it describes the fauna and many of the outcrops. The term
Clinton is only used provisionally, as the formation is very closely re-
lated to the Niagara, and has only been distinguished from the latter
by being richly fossiliferous and separated by a few inches of clay or
marl. Its fauna does not differ materially from that of the Niagara, and
both are limestones of similar character. The so-called Clinton is only
from 10 to 15 feet in thickness in western Ohio, but is somewhat greater
farther eastward. Itis uneconformable by erosion to the Cincinnati
group, and holds pebbles of the latter often in considerable amount.§

In an economie description of the coal and iron of the Southern Ap-
palachian, Porter || gives some aecount of the Clinton group in that
district and describes some of its stratigraphic and structural features.

Boyd,{] in a somewhat similar paper on southwestern Virginia and
adjacent parts of Tennessee, describes the geology and gives some de-
tailed information in regard to the structure of that region.

48. In the continuation of their review of Rogers’ Geology of the
Virginias, the Campbells add some interesting and valuable statements
on the structural and stratigraphic relations in western Virginia. The
Niagara is stated to consist of alternating beds of conglomerates, hard
sandstones and shales, caleareous in greater part in its upper members,
and holding occasional beds of impure limestone. The occurrence of
the Salina in Virginia is thought to be open to question, butif it exists
itis represented by calcareous shales, with occasional limestone beds
in Rogers’, No. V. The inseparability of the Silurian and Devonian at
the base of the Oriskany is urged, as the rocks and fauna of the
Lower Helderburg graduate into those of the Oriskany, and a much
better line of division is found above the latter, where the Corniferous

is wanting and the change in rock and fauna abrupt. The Mar-
cellus, Hamilton, and Genesee form a group about 750 feet in thick-
ness, which in its upper part holds fossiliferous limestone beds. The
Catskill is a transition series in every respect. The subdivisions of
the Subcarboniferous are well characierized the lower division bear-
ing small quantities of coal, and is supposed to have furnished the salt
of the Holston valley deposits.*

49. In describing the coal district in Sullivan County, Pennsylvania,
Ashburnert makes some observations on its general stratigraphy, and
conside s White justified in assigning the whole of Wyoming County
east of the Susquehanna to the Catsk Il formation, but finds the sup-
posed equivalency of some of the conglomerates n the North Mountain
region open to question.

50. The same author describes the occurrence of a thin bed of fossil-
iferous lim stone in the anthracite coal measures in Wyoming valley,
Pennsylvania. The fossils are reported upon by Heilprin, and are all
of a most pronounced Carboniferous type.t

51. Linn and Linton report on an examination of borings ‘rom gas
wells in Washington County, Pennsylvania, in which they find evidence
of the occurrence of the mountain or silicious limestone, with character-
istics similar to those in the outcrops described by Stevenson in the
gaps of Laurel Hill and Chestnut Ridge. Its thickness is about 80 feet.
It lies about 1,100 feet below the Pittsburgh coal, is 170 feet below the
Piedmont sandstone, and is overlain by 30 feet of black shales. §

52. Ashburner reports on the examination of the coal beds in the Po-
cono tormation (No. X), at Tipton kun, Blair County, Pennsylvania.
The horizon of the beds is considered unquestionable. The coal is bi-
tuminous, and one bed is as much as 3 feet in thickness.|| The same
author ] reports on the progress of the elaborate survey which is now
being made of the antlracite coal region, and while little matter of gen-
eral geologic interest is presented, the report contains much special in-
form:2tion upon details of struc’ ure, stratigraphy, and progress of the
survey in several fields.

their horizons, equivalency, and former extent. He calls attention to
some interesting facts not generally appreciated in regard to the west-
ward thinning of the Paleozoic series. In central Pennsylvania the
thickness of the Paleozoic rocks from the top of the Potsdam to the top
of the Pottsville conglomerate is 26,000 feet and in central Ohio only
3,500 feet, and there is a similar thinning northward. Between the edge
of the Alleghany Mountains, in Huntington County and Pittsburgh, the
lower members of the Carboniferous system thin to one-half. In dis-
cussing the flexures of the coal district, discrimination is made between
the great low rolls and the gentle plications of some of the Western
basins. The former are thought to be part of those of the general Ap-
palachian system, but the latter appear to be due to local subsidence at
the time of the deposition, and by the shrinkage due to the compacting
of the loose mass of organic matter now pressed into coal.*

55. D’Invillierst gives a preliminary account of the general re-exam-
ination of the Pittsburgh coal region, describing in detail a portion of
Alleghany County. He speaks highly of the work of his predecessors,
who determined the more general features, but it is now proposed to
prepare contour maps of the coal beds, and very detailed work is con-
templated.

56. McCalley reportson thestudy of the Warrior coal field of Alabama,
and describes many details of its coal beds, structure, drift cover, soils,
topography, ete. The Warrior field is stated to be a broad, shallow,
tray-shaped depression, sloping southwesterly under the newer forma-
tions, and much flexed and dislocated on its southeastern part. It is
principally composed of sandstone, conglomerates, shales, slates, and
coal seams, with occasional beds of limestone. The country is plateau
where underlain by the conglomerates, and this holds coals which thin
southward. It is thought that in the basin district near Tuscaloosa
there are 300 feet of coal measures, with nearly fifty seams of coal, aggre-
gating 100 feet in thickness, and varying from a few inches to 14 feet
each. Thirty-five are known to be 18 inches or over in thickness and
fifteen over 24 feet. They are thickest in the center of the basin and
thin northwestward. ¢

57. Hill calls atrention to the very exceptional occurrence of coal in
the Carboniferous of Colorado. The coal is anthracite, and in very thin
beds, probably in the Middle Carboniferous. §

stone, quite distinct from the underlying coal-measure shales, and pos-
sibly unconformable to them. Of the one hundred and twenty-three
coal-measure species in Nebraska, not more than a dozen pass upward
into this group. The overlying Dakota group lies on its irregular
eroded surface. It is thought that the old maps representing this
formation, extending from the Kansas line to the Platte, are erroneous,
as on the surface the group only appears to cover Gage and parts of
the adjoining counties. Newberry, in discussing this paper, questions
the propriety of calling the beds Permian, as their fauna is not charac-
teristic, and expresses the opinion that this formation does not oceur in
America. Walcott stated that he regards some Arizona beds as good
representatives of the Permian.

59. Cornwall Iron Mines, Pennsylvania.—So many opinions have been
held in regard to the position and origin of the ore beds at these im-
portant mines, and the similar ones northward, that the papers on the
subject which have appeared during the past year have more than usual
general interest. One is Willis’s long-delayed report of studies made
in 1881 for the Tenth Census,* and the other is a very detailed report
by Lesley and d’Invilliers+t of work in 1885. These writers agree in
considering the deposits entirely independent of the Mesozoic and to
have been derived from calcareous shales or limestone into which they
are found to graduate. Lesley and d’Invilliers, from a careful study of
the structural relations, consider the horizon of the ore to be approxi-
mately Trenton and apply the term ‘*‘ Cornwall Slates ” to the extension
of the unaltered shales along the Trias border. Willis suggests the
possibility of the ore representing the Upper Primal and that the lime-
stones are above ine ore; their apparent subordination at some points
being due to cross faults, of which other evidence was found. Les-
ley thinks that the ore body is separated from the adjoining Trias by
a fault, but Willis and d’Invilliers do not share this opinion, consider-
jng the overlap to be that of a simple shore line. Lesley and d’Invil-
liers describe many details of the trap associated with the ore, and con-
sider its curved outcrop due to branching dikes and intrusions along
a slightly crumpled monoclinal.

CAMBRIAN AND TACONIC.

The Taconic controversy is now rapidly approaching its end, and if
discoveries of fossils and determinations of structural relations continue
as In the past year or two, it will soon be satisfactorily terminated.

The manner in which much of the literature on the subject has been
received indicates that in this, as well as other questions of its class,
nothing will be convincing to most geologists but the results of careful

systematic field-work—something the Taconic district had never re-
ceived up to within a few years past.

60. In regard to the use of the term Taconic, opinions will always
differ, whatever the issue. No one now questions the fact that Em-
mons was the first to definitely call attention to the occurrence of a pri-
mordial series in America, and notwithstanding the great opposition,
much of which was prejudiced, persisted in his views. It seems unfor-
tunate that his typical Taconic proves to be in greater part Lower Silu-
rian; but he also applied the term to other areas by lithologie anal-
ogy, and as these are now found to be Cambrian, some will always be
in favor of giving the name Taconic to this series as an honor to the
geologist who first recognized the primordial in America. In the lit-
erature of the past year Winchell* is in favor of this. Walcott uses
the term for his Middle Cambrian, but Danat is opposed to this on the
grounds that Emmons’s typical Taconic is not primordial, and that his
application of the term to others arose from the very faulty supposition
of identity of age in rocks of lithologie similarity.

61. Walcott announced before the American Association his discov-
ery of a Middle Cambrian or Georgian fauna in limestone in the slate,
near Middle Granville, Washington County, New York. These slates
aggregate 10,000 feet in thickness. The red slates of the same district
are found to be of Hudson River age. t

32. Dwight calls attention to the occurrence of Trenton fossils in
metamorphic limestone of Hmmons’s original Taconic, at Canaan, New
York,§ and Bishop finds similar exposures at approximately the same
horizon farther north, near Chatham and Kent, in Columbia County,.||
Dana discusses Dwight’s discovery in its bearings on the Taconic ques-
tion, and shows that the limestone is unquestionably part of Emmons’s
original Taconic, and that the same strata comes up on the other side of
the synelinal as the Steckbridge limestone, and is traceable for many
miles northward into Vermont. Itis conformably overlain by slates an-
questionably Hudson River in age, which at some points have yielded
characteristic graptolites to Hall. The question of overthrust in the
Taconic district is discussed, and it is shown that this could be easiiy
detected if it existed to a sufficient extent to invert the order of
succession, as in the Scottish Highlands. Some slightly overturned
flexures occur, and most of the faults are overthrust to the eastward ;
but these are purely local results and do not affect the general problem.
The absence of fossils and increasingly crystalline condition of the
rocks eastward is thought to be due to an increased amount of meta-
morphism in that direction.

63. In his second contribution to the study of the Cambrian faunas
Walcott discusses the classification of this series in the light of present
knowledge of its stratigraphy and fauna. The Cambrian is shown to
be as distinctly a system as the Silurian, Devonian, and others, being
represented by over 18,000 feet of strata, with ninety-two genera and
three hundred and ninety-three species, of which very few pass upward
into the Ordovician, or so-called Lower Silurian. Its subdivisions into
upper, middle, and lower is shown to be required, and although the mid-
dle is transitionary in fauna, it presents well-marked characteristics.
A detailed description is given of the sections of Georgia, Vermont,
and at Eureka, and in the highland ranges, Nevada, where the faunal
and stratigraphic distinctions between the Middle or Georgian and the
Upper or Potsdam is distinctly exposed. It is also shown that the
Upper Cambrian or Potsdam of the Mississippi Valley is faunally dis-
tinct from the Middle Cambrian, which, however, is not recognized in
this district. The Lower Cambrian is only found east of eastern Mas-
sachusetts, and is represented by the faunally characteristic series of St.
Johns and Braintree, as there appears to have been a barrier up-to the
end of the Lower Cambrian, preventing its extension to the eastward.
The following table is given as a classification of North American Cam-
brian rocks:

The Grand Caiion, Chuar, Llano, and Keweenaw series are considered
pre-Cambrian on account of unconformity with the unmistakable Cam-
brian and their inconspicuous faynas. They are termed the Keweenaw
group, and the interval between them and the Upper Cambrian is
thought to be a hiatus equal to the Middle and Lower Cambrian; the
Keweenaw not being directly overlain by the two latter as far as known.*

New York, Dwight has discovered an outcrop of fossiliferous Potsdam

The thickness exposed is about 300 feet. He suggested that the fault
may be related to the great dislocation of Logan, as it ranges NNE.
and SSW., and has been traced for some distance. *

65. The stiatiaeatng of the Cambrian of the Northwest is discussed
by Winchell from recent observations in the valley of Minnesota. The
following table represents his conclusions in regard to the relations of
the several sandstones and limestones constituting the Cambrian of
Minnesota and Wisconsin :

Red shales and red sandrock, passing into the Cupriferous ? (Pots-
dam ?).t

66. Dawson, in his report on the Canadian Rocky Mountains, de-
scribes the Cambrian of that district. The rocks consist in the main of
11,000 feet or more of quartzites and quartzitic shales passing into ar-
gillites, and including occasional beds of limestone, conglomerate, and
lava fiows. A few Middle Cambrian fossils were found in its upper part,
but with this exception the series is closely similar to the quartzites and
argillites of the Wasatch and the Chuar and Grand Cafion group of
Arizona. {

ARCHEAN AND METAMORPHIC.

The crystalline metamorphic rocks of the United States have been
subjects of controversy almost from the first; and although much has
been written about them, they have received systematic study at com-
paratively few localities. In the Appalachian belt there have been
those who considered the rocks of some areas to be Cambrian, Silurian,
and Devonian in age, the evidence for which from its own character and
the recent revelations of the possibilities of paramorphism and metamor-
phism seems almost incontrovertible; while on the other hand many ge-
ologists hoid, at least tentatively, that all metamorphic erystallines of
considerable areal extent are Archean. In the studies of the past year
some of the areas thought to be post-Archean metamorphics are found
to be shore lines of Cambrian formations, and consequently pre-Cam-
brian; while Becker, in California, finds as a result of careful detailed

studies that some of the crystalline rocks of the coast ranges are altered
sandstone of Cretaceous age.* Dale gives other instances of the meta-
morphism of the Carboniferous of Rhode Island to gneisses and mica
schists.t| Emerson, in a paper before the American Association, dis-
cusses in detail the relations of the Helderberg limestone and the crys-
talline condition of overlying as well as of underlying rocks in the Con-
necticut Valiey;t and the studies of Van Hise on the enlargement of
mineral grains suggests an easily understood explanation of the forma-
tion of many of the crystalline rocks of post-Archean age. With all
this evidence in view, it now seems probable that the whole controversy
about our metamorphies will end in finding that, while the greater mass
of them belong to the Archean and its subdivision, there are areas of
considerable size which will prove much younger.

There are now in progress three systematic surveys of the crystalline
rocks. Pumpelly in the Appalachian belt, Inving in the Great Lake
district of the Northwest, and Britton in the New Jersey Highlands.
During the past year the two latter have published preliminary reports,
Irving for 1883 and Britton for 1885.

67. The principal features of Irving’s reports are accounts of a re-ex-
amination of the typical Huronian, stadies of a number of series which
are correllated with the Huronian, and a discussion of equivalency. The
typical Huronian is found to consist primarily of quartzite, with occa-
sional beds of graywacke, limestone with chert, and numerous eruptive
greenstones, the whole being very gently flexed and-unconformable to
the older gneisses. With this formation are correllated the Marquette
and Menominee, and the Penokee-Gogebic iron-bearing series, the
schists and quartzites of the Upper Wisconsin Valley, the slate-belt of
the St. Louis and Minnesota Rivers, the quartzites of Cippewa and Bar-
ren Counties, Wisconsin, the schists of Black River Valley, the Baraboo
quartzites, and those of southern Minnesota and soatheastern Dakota,
and the Animikie series. The folded schists north and east of Lake
Superior are thought to be equivalent to at least the latter. §

68. Bell, in a report on the Hcdson’s Strait and Bay, describes the

crystalline rocks of that district, and states that the schistose memvers

classed as Huronian are either interstratified with the massive beds of
the Laurentian system, or conformable to them. The quartzites of the
typical Huronian district do not extend far to the north and west, and
the schistose series includes, besides a great variety of crystalline schists,
more or less massive diorites, argillaceous and dioritic slate, conglom-
erates, granites, syenites, schistose and jaspery iron ores, limestones
or dolomites, and imperfect gneisses. As far as observed, they are much
more abundant in the region between the Great Lakes and Hudson’s

Bay than in the Labrador peninsula or north of Hudson’s Strait. The
same author, in a paper on the mineral resources of the Hudson’s Bay
Territory, states that on the eastern shore of the bay there occurs a
series of sedimentary rocks apparently identical with the Animikie and
Nipigon groups. On the western and northwestern shores there are
altered rocks resembling the gold bearing series of Nova Scotia, some
Similar to the Huronian of Lake Huron, and others like the crystalline
series near Cherbourg, Quebec. Between the Laurentian nucleus and
the Rocky Mountains there is a great basin of Silurian, Devonian, Cre-
taceous, and Tertiary rocks, which give place northward to limestones,
probably of Nipigon age. On the shores of the Arctic Ocean similar
limestones, associated with traps, are the prevailing rocks between
Mackenzie and Coppermine Rivers, and the copper-bearing rocks of the
latter region appear to correspond with those of the Lake Superior dis-
trict.*

69. Willis, in a report on a trip to the Upper Mississippi and Vermil-
lion Lake, Minnesota, describes some structural relations of the Vermil-
lion Lake iron-bearing series, the supposed northern equivalent of those
of Marquette. The beds are all vertical, and pressed into close folds with
exceedingly intricate relations. The iron-bearing bed is of jasper, hold-
ing non-magnetic specular ore, and is associated with semi-erystalline
schistose rocks and a bed of quartzite containing grains of magnetite.
The Vermillion and Two River ranges are thought to be anticlinal
ridges, eroded down to the chloritic schists. Some of the structural
features are very curious, and the relations under one swampy area were
worked out by tracing the magnetite-bearing quartzite with the mag-
netic needle.t

70. Britton’s report (already referred to) is a preliminary account of
the continuation of Smock’s studies of the Highland Archean for the
New Jersey Geological Survey. Smock’s discovery that the crystalline
rocks could be divided into “‘massive” and ‘ bedded” was taken up,
and the areal and structural relations of each worked out for a portion of
the district. The massive and underlying rocks consist in the main of
quartz, syenites, granulites, and hornblendic granulites, and graduate
into the stratified rocks, which are gneisses, hornblendic schists, etc.,
but all are considered equivalent to the Laurentian in age. The struc-
tural relations are not particularly complicated so fur as determined,
and the eastern side of the Highlands appears to have been more over-
turned than the western. +

71. Farther northward, in the Highlandsin New York, Ruttman gives
an account of a detailed study of the Tillie Foster magnetite deposit.

The ore is found in a bed unquestionably interstratified with the crys-
talline rocks, and presents some evidence of having been originally in
granular form and sorted by shore action, as suggested by Julien.*

72. In the midst of the Adirondacks, at Lower Saranac Lake, Brit-
ton notes the occurrence of a series of schistose gneisses with micaceous
and hornblendic schists holding abundant quartz veins, and dipping 45
degrees north, and Julien calls attention in this connection to the simi-
lar series, bordering the Adirondacks, especially on their eastern side.t

73. In a description of the Wallbridge magnetite mine in Canada,
Chapman discusses the Archean rocks of that district, and recognizes
four divisions, rather than the three proposed by Vennor. Two of the
series are thought to be volcanic, the others metamorphic, and it is
thought that the syenites should be separated from the lower stratified
gneisses. ¢

74. The erystalline rocks extending southward from Westchester
County, N. Y., have received some attention in the literature of the
past year. Ata meeting of the New York Academy of Science, New-
berry states his opinion that they are of Archean age; and Martin, in
calling attention to their great difference from the Highland rocks, and
their more hydrous condition, suggests that it may be due to a long
submergence at the bottom of the Trias basin. Britton states that at
Washington the series contains less feldspar and generally more mica
than in the Highlands. §

75. Britton presents an additional note on the geology of Staten
Island. From the discovery of partially altered amphibole in the ser-
pentine, he is of opinion that the latter has been derived from horn-
blendic or tremolitic strata, which have been found to a limited extent
on the island, and from magnesian limestone. He states that the strati-
fication of the rocks is unquestionable, and gives a number of dips. It
is thought that the serpentine does not form an anticlinal, as before
described, but probably a geosynclinal. As the serpentine of Hoboken,
Staten Island, and New York lie along the strike, it is suggested that
they may occupy a belt in the gneisses, and that their outcrops and
those of the limestones of New York Island may be due to pitch or to
cross faults. ||

76. Frazer, in a sketch of the geology of York County, Pennsylvania,
summarizes his views on the crystalline rocks of that district. None
of the rocks are thought to be Laurentian or Norian, unless, perhaps, |
in a portion of the South Mountain. The lowest horizon appears to be
equivalent to the horizon of the Huronian, which is supposed to cover
most of the areas, and of which at least 14,000 feet is exposed in the

Susquehanna anticlinal. These lower rocks are more perfectly crystal-
line and contain a greater proportion of muscovite and feldspar than
the upper series into which they graduate, and which are magnesian, less
erystalline, and possibly of Paleozoic age. The quartzites of Chikis,
Chester Valley, etc., are thought to be Potsdam from their unconformity
to the underlying schists.*

PACIFIC COAST.

77. Two systematic geologic surveys are now in progress in the State
of California, one by Becker, at present in the southern part, and the
other by Diller, en the voleanic geology. Some of Becker’s results are
given in a paper which is referred to at length under “ Metamorphism
and Paramorphism,” and announces the Neocomian age of a portion of
the crystalline schists of the Coast ranges.

Diller makes a preliminary report of progress of work in the northern
part of the State, which throws much light upon its geologic history.
It is found that the Carboniferous limestones are quite widely distrib-
uted and probably embrace all those of the metamorphic rocks. Gil-
bert’s suggestion that the Sierra Nevada has the basin-range structure
is verified, and three westward-sloping blocks are recognized. The age
of the auriferous slates is considered doubtful; while one portion of
them is certainly Mesozoic, another portion is apparently older than the
Carboniferous limestone, and is, perhaps, altogether pre Carboniferous.
The great displacements forming the Sierra Nevada appear to have be-
gun about the close of the Tertiary, and may still be in progress. The
distribution and relations of the Chico group indicate that during the
Chico epoch much of what is now the Coast Range region in northern
California was an island seperated from the continental mass to which
the Sierra belonged by a strait which has since been filled by Lassen
Peak lavas to form a portion of the present Cascade Range.t

78. Le Conte discusses the time of the elevation of the Sierra Nevada
from the evidence afforded by the river beds in middle California. In
that district the lava flows at the end of the Tertiary were only of suf-
ficient thickness to fill up the river channels and cause them to shift
their courses to the divides. Previous to this the base-level of erosion
had been almost attained, and since the lava flows there has been a

. great uplift, which has caused the rivers to cut the deep, narrow gorges
in which they now run. This idea of post-Tertiary uplift in the Sierra
Nevada is interesting in connection with Dutton’s study in the plateau
country, where the elevation took place approximately at the same time,
and was similarly attended by faulting and great lava flows. According
to studies of Gilbert and Russell on the faults of the Great Basin, uplift
in that region appears to have begun in the beginning of the Quater-

nary, and was probably contemporaneous with that of the Sierra Nevada.
It is thought that the great lava flow of the Northwest commenced at
the beginning of the Pliocene, as it lies upon the eroded edges of the
Miocene, and must have continued almost to the present time, the
greatest flows being as late as the end of the Pliocene.*

79. Willis reports on his studies for the Northern Transcontinental
Survey of the coal measures on the western slope of the Cascade Mount-
ains, in Washington Territory. While the report is in greater part of
economic interest only, some general statements are made which form
an important contribution to the knowledge of the geology of this dis-
trict. The coal measures are in sandstones and carbonaceous shales of
Laramie age which aggregate 13,000 feet in thickness. The workable
beds are seventeen in number, mostly in the lower 3,000 feet of the
measures. The quality varies from poor lignite to coking coal in pro-
portion to the mechanical disturbance of the beds. It is locally anthra-
citic in the vicinity of intrusive dikes. The formation is found to be
a brackish water deposit, and by the uplift forming the Cascade Range
they were flexed over axes having a general north and south trend. Ero-
sion, volcanic overflow, and drift have obscured the limits of the forma-
tion, and it is now only recognized in detached areas. The following
table summarizes the conclusions in regard to the equivalency of the
several formations flanking the Cascade Mountains : f

Russell, in a very interesting and finely illustrated paper on the ex-
isting glaciers of the United States, describes with some detail his own
studies of those near Mono Lake, California. Nine glaciers are found
in the southern rim of that basin, and a number of others occur on the
opposite side of Sierra Nevada, all being between latitude 36° 30’ and
38° north, at an altitude of approximately 11,500 feet. They occur in
amphitheaters on the northern side of elevated peaks, and are quite
small, the largest, on Mount Lyell, being nearly a mile in length, and
a little more than a mile in width. The ice is ribboned in structures,
has dirt bands, crevasses, moraines, and other features found in larger
glaciers. Their former wide extent is indicated by great moraines and

ROCKY MOUNTAINS, ETC.

81. G. M. Dawson, in a paper on a portion of the Canadian Rocky
Mountains, gives a description of the relation of the various ranges
and the geologic relations and structure along some of the routes across
them. It is found that the lowest rocks consist of over 11,000 feet of
quartzites, slates, and shales, with occasional beds of limestone and
lava flows, and present scanty fossil evidence that they are of Middle
Cambrian age in the upper part, but otherwise similar to the quartzites
and schists of the Wasatch Mountains of Utah, and the Chuar and
Grand Cafion groups of Arizona. Overlying these unconformably is a
limestone series of Devonian and Carboniferous age, which occasionally
holds quartzites, and may prove in the westernmost parts of the range
to pass down into Silurian or Cambrio-Silurian. ‘Triassic or Permo-
Triassic red sandstones with traps appear in some places near the
forty-ninth parallel, and are overlain by 7,000 feet of shales and sand-
stones, with coal-beds, which bear a characteristic early Cretaceous or
Cretaceo-Jurassic flora, which have been named the Kootanie series.
Overlying them, generally with slight unconformity, lie remnants of
Middle and Upper Cretaceous, with coal-beds and trap-sheets. The
following table is given of the beds above the Kootanie series :

lie in an overturned synclinal in the Subcarboniferous, on the Devo-
nian limestone. The coal contains about 81 per cent of fixed carbon,
and there are several workable beds.

83. Sir J. William Dawson, in a memoir on the Mesozoic floras of the
Rocky Mountain district of Canada, discusses the occurrence of plant
remains in general, and describes the three new horizons recognized.
First, the Kootanie series, supposed to be the representative of the
Neocomian, or at least not newer than the Shasta group of the United
States, and the lower sandstone shales of the Queen Charlotte Islands,
which is regarded as similar to the eyead beds of Maryland. Second,
the Mill Creek beds, corresponding closely with the Dakota group, and
separated from the Kootanie by a considerable thickness of strata.
Above this is a third sub-flora, that of the Belly River series at the
base of the Fort Pierre group. This series, though separated from the
Laramie proper. by the marine beds of the Pierre and Fox Hill groups,
an interval of 1,700 feet, introduces the Laramie or Darien flora. The
Laramie flora is found to be divisible into two sub-floras, an older,
allied to that of the Belly River series, and a newer, identical with that
of the Souris River, which appears to agree with the Fort Union group
of the United States. The following table is given, showing the equiva-
leney of these series: +

85. In the long-delayed Census report on Mining Industries there
are several papers on the coal-beds of the Northwest, the results of the
studies of Eldridge, Davis, and Willis for the Northern Transconti-
nental Survey under the direction of Pumpelly. Willis’ report is re-
ferred to under another heading. Eldridget describes’ in great detail
the Montana coal-beds and their associated strata, and Davis reports
on the more general geologic relations of the district. The area studied
is included in a triangle 120 to 140 miles on a side in south-central
Montana, including the Bridger, Big, and Little Belt, Highwood, and
Main ranges. The rock series extends conformably from the Lower
Cambrian to the Upper Cretaceous, and is from 30,000 to 35,000 feet in
maximum thickness. The Cambrian schists are from 10,000 to 15,000
feet thick, but in some parts of the area are very much less and possi-
bly absent. These schists are capped by a persistent layer of quartzite,
and a limestone with Potsdam fauna. Overlying this, and separated
by a small interval of shales, there are 3,000 odd feet of Lower Carbon-
iferous limestones, generally overlain by a hard quartzite. Then there
are 15,000 feet or more of sandstones and shales of the Mesozoic in
which the occurrence of the Trias red beds is doubtful. Jurassic fossils
occur at 600 feet, many Cretaceous fossils at 3,200 feet, and the Creta-
ceous coal at 4,400 feet above the Carboniferous limestone, and con-
formabie sandstones, with occasional imperfect plant-remains, extending
over 10,000 feet higher. All the post-Carboniferous about the mountains
appears to be Mesozoic, excepting Quaternary lake deposits in the
upper valleys, and some patches of possibly early Tertiary. Volcanic
rocks are found to have been extruded in greater part at the end of the
Cretaceous and Tertiary. The workable coal near Bozeman is only
3,700 feet above the Jura fossils, and is far below the Laramie.t

Comstock describes the geology and vein structure of southwestern
Colorado, and discusses at some length the vein stones and ore deposits.
The following is an abstract of the statements in regard to the surface
geology: The crystalline rocks consist of a quartzite group, and an
overlying granite, which are considered post-Archean, and possibly
Lower Paleozoic. The Silurian and Devonian are represented at some
points by fossiliferous rocks, and may occur over a wide area, of which
the age is now in doubt. The Carboniferous is divided into two series,
the earlier represented by 1,200 feet or more of argillaceous, arenaceous,
and calcareous beds, the latter by over 1,200 feet of red sandstone,
with occasional local trachytic inclusions. The Triassic and Jurassic
do not cover any considerable area, and may be absent. The Cretace-
ous appears in force, and the series 1-5 of the Hayden survey are rec-
ognized. Coal-beds are found in the upper part of the upper Dakota.
The Tertiary is represented by Eocene lake beds, and great lava flows,
which appear to be chiefly middle Tertiary. Five series of volcanic
eruptions are recognized in the following order: Propylite, andesite,
trachyte, crater flows of rhyolite, and finally a few patches of basait,
probably the remnants of Pliocene flows.*

87. In the Red Mountain districts great geyser deposits are found,
and it is supposed that at one time this area experienced geyser action
similar to that now active in the Yellowstone Park t

88. Stephens gives a general account of observations made on a trip
through the San Juan Mountains. The underlying rocks of the district
are a crystalline series, generally overlain by Silurian sandstones,
quartzites, etc., and these in turn are often overlain by the Carbonifer-
ous. Structural features and outcrops are geuerally obscured by great
masses of volcanic rocks. North of Ouray the country is traversed by
numerous faults, often of great magnitude. Two periods of voleanism
are recognized, both subsequent to the last uplift. The first is termed
the porphyry period, and its viscid lavas are found overflowing the
whole district, and intruded between many of the beds, causing great
alteration. The second is termed the trachytic period, in which an ex-
ceedingly viscid lava appears to have been outpoured upon the moun-
tain tops, but was not sufficiently liquid to flow into the valleys. {

89. In hisreport as geologist of Wyoming for 1885, Aughey discusses
the geologic position of the hematite deposits of Seminole Mountain. He
considers the ore-bearing series to be of approximately Huronian age.
It consists of quartzites, and gneissic, hornblendic, and chloritic rocks,
with limestones, jasper, and epidotic slates, which form the core of the
mountain, and are overlain by Potsdam, Carboniferous and Cretaceous
in succession. §

90. Texas.—The State of Texas has recently published a report by
Shumard on the geology along routes traveled by the expedition be-
tween Indianola, Texas, and the valley of the Mimbres, New Mexico, in
1855, 756, and of Grayson County, Texas.* Although issued at this late
date, and opinions on some of the broader questions have radically
changed, the report contains a great mass of valuable information.
Hill, in reviewing it, states that most ofthe stratigraphic deductions are
erroneous, and as shown by Marcou, the sections in the Cretaceous are
reversed. The supposed Upper Cretaceous in Grayson County is
now known to be Tertiary and the Lower Cretaceous, Upper.t

91. Hill, in a general description of the geologic features of Travis
County, Texas, makes the interesting statement that the Cretaceous is
in two divisions, differing considerably in fauna and lithology and un-
conformable to each other, and it is pointed out that the lower division
lies altogether below the Dakota horizon.t Their areal distribution and
structural relations are described, and much local information given.

92. Mexico.—Cope, in a report on the coal deposits near Zacuatipan,
Hidalgo, Mexico, describes the geologic features of that district. The
country is underlain by a silicious limestone said to be Cretaceous and
penetrated by numerous trap dikes and sheets. In the depressions in
this formation and its voleanic rocks lie regularly stratified horizontal
beds of Upper Miocene age, probably equivalent to the Loup Fork
series of the United States, and consisting of glass, volcanic ash beds,
and the carbonaceous shales, with lignite coal, often of good quality.§

93. Nebraska.—In a description of the Lincoln salt basin, Hicks states
his opinion that these salt deposits in the Dakota group (especially those
of the lower part of the group) || are remnants of old Cretaceous salt
marshes, resulting from the evaporation of the sea water during the
deposition of the sands.

the United States, one by McGee, ] the other by Hitchcock.** ‘That of

western California are colored. MeGee’s map is dated 1884, and is not
only compiled from published information, but from manuscript maps in
some areas. It differs from previous maps in numerous respects. Besides
more accurate delineation of boundaries, the crystalline rocks of New
York Island and of Westchester County are represented as Silurian; the
New England erystallines and those of all the Piedmont and Appalach-
ian belt are colored as Archean, including the semi-crystalline schists of
central South Carolina, central and western North Carolina, south-
eastern Pennsylvania, and parts of New England. The oldest rocks of
Texas are referred to the Cambrian, and the Archean area in Missouri
are shown surrounded by Cambrian. The southern half of Long Island
is represented as Tertiary, and much of the Atlantic coast, especially
that of North Carolina, is thus shown. The gypsiferous series of Kan-
sas, Indian Territory, and New Mexico is incorporated with the Creta-
ceous; the Eocene of Texas is given a great width along the Rio Grande ;
the cross-timber district of Texas is shown as Quaternary, and a large
portion of Dakota and Minnesota is similarly shown.

95. Hitchcock copies MeGee’s boundaries in districts of which the
geology is less open to question. In the Black Hills and eastward the
Archean is subdivided into Laurentian and Huronian. Cambrian is
represented in southwestern Maine, in central South Carolina, and in -
west central and in western North Carolina. The underlying rocks
are shown as far as possible in Minnesota and Dakota instead of the
overlying drift, information for Minnesota having been furnished by
Upham. The gypsiferous series of Indian Territory, Texas, and New
Mexico is shown as Trias, and the Jura and Trias are separated as far
as possible in other parts of the West; much information from Pum-
pelly, Blake, Willis, Dutton, and Diller is utilized for the far West,
but large areas are colored hypothetically. The gold slates of California
are represented as Jurassic and Cretaceous metamorphic, but not with
approbation. For the Canadian areas in the Hast and far West much
new information has been incorporated.

During the past year there has appeared the report of the Interna-
tional Congress of Geologists, in which an account is given of the re-
sults attained towards uniformity in geologic nomenclature and cartog-
raphy.

PETROGRAPHY.

Besides the papers referred to in the following paragraphs, there are
several others containing petrographic information of a most interest-
ing character, notably those of Becker on the Cretaceous crystallines
of California, and Williams on a district west of Baltimore, both of
which are noticed under ‘‘ Metamorphism and Paramorphism.”

96. G. H. Williams describes in detail the petrographic characteris-
tics of the peridotites of the Cortlandt series near Peekskill, New York.
Two varieties are found, one containing hornblende and the other py-
222 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

roxene. The hornblendic peridotite is dotted with small roundecG grains
of olivine or serpentine, as in the Schillerspath or bastit of the Hartz
Mountains, and for which the name poicilitic (mottled) is proposed.
The hornblende is of the variety called basaltic, and contains charac-
teristic specular intrusions. It is not crystalline, but fills spaces of the
rock, and often forms masses of some size, the other minerals appear-
ing to have crystallized from it, probably under much pressure. The
olivine has interesting inclusions, and at its contact with the feldspar
it is always separated by a zone of square grains of pyroxene and tufts
of radiated actinolite. The pyroxene generally appears to be hyper-
sthene. Feldspar is never an important constituent. This rock grades
into augite-peridotite by transition, the hornblende giving place to
augite. The rocks are mostly massive, but are sometimes somewhat
schistose, and appear under the microscope to have been subjected to
much pressure. All the basic members of the Cortlandt series are too
acid to pass as representative olivine rocks, as the amount of this con-
stituent is small.* :

97. The petrography of the peridotite in the Carboniferous of eastern
Kentucky is described by Diller, who finds it to consist in the main of
about 40 per cent. of olivine, 30 of secondary serpentine, 8 of py-
rope, and 14 of dolomite. The relation of the peridotites to the asso-
ciated sedentary beds is discussed, and as the latter are indurated, and
its fragments occur in the peridotite, itis thought that the latter is
undoubtedly intrusive.t

98. Lindgren describes the petrographic features and the relations
of the eruptive rocks of south central Montana, as a supplement to
Davis’ paper (see 85). Itis found that the oldest eruptive is a gran-
ite with red orthoclase, occurring in dikes in gneiss at the head of
Belt Creek, in the Little Belt Mountains. The next period of erup-
tion appears to have been in the Cambrian or the Silurian, and rocks
consist of a diabase, sometimes quartzose, with the quartz granopyric
in structure. This was succeeded in the Jurassic by acid magmas
issuing as flows and dikes of diorite, granites and quartz porphyrites,
and latter presenting two varieties, the augitic and the hornblendie.
In the Laramie and Tertiary, volcanism was very active and varied.
The sequence of eruptions is pot worked out, but the andesite flows
appear to have commenced late in the Cretaceous or Laramie. The
hornblende dacites are found massive in the Little Belt Mountains, as
dikes in Laramie in front of the main range, and with andesites in the
Laramie conglomerates in the Highwood Mountains. No augite-da-
cites, and only a few augite-andesites were found. Liparites are found
jn front of the main range as dikes in Laramie strata. The most recent
eruptions appear to have been in the post-Tertiary, probably Pliocene,
and consist of trachytes and basalt. The former are nearly all devel-

oped as augite-trachytes, some of which are very rich in augite. The
basalts are in part plagioclastic ; another part consist of analcite (no-
seal) basalts, originally composed of nosean augite and olivine, with
the former changed to analcite—generally occurring in dikes, often
crowded in great numbers, and apparently older than trachy tes.*

99. Newberry quotes the results of examination by Iddings of some
of the igneous rocks from the Lower Silurian and Cretaceous of the
Belt Mountains, and consisting of typical augite-andesites, true tra-
chytes and rhyolites.t

100. Becker, in a paper on the Washoe Rocks, discusses Hague and
Iddings’ criticism on the petrography in his monograph on the Comstock
lode. An account is given of a re-examination in the field, the result
of which substantially corroborates his previous conclusions that there
were two separate eruptions of porphyritic, pyroxenic, and plagioclase
rocks, presenting sufficient differences to be separated into diabase and
andesite. Additional reasons were also found for maintaining the exist-
ence of diabase, and for dividing the pyroxene andesite into two distinet
outflows separated by a long interval of time, contrary to Hague and
Iddings’ opinion that the rocks constitute substant.ally a single Tertiary
eruption. The structural features and petrography of the rocxs in
question are discussed in detail, and while somewhat slight corrections
are made to his previous statements, he finds Hague and Iddings’
hypothesis of progressive crystallization inapplicable in explanation of
the differentiation of the several members of the Comstock district.{

101. In a paper on columnar structure in the Mesozoic igneous rocks
of New Jersey, Iddings describes:‘the petrography of the diabase near
Orange, New Jersey. It is found that it differs in some respects from
most of the similar igneous rocks in that part of the country. ‘ Gener-
ally the microstructure of these rocks is holocrystalline, formed of lath-
shaped, basic feldspar, irregular crystals and grains of augite, grains of
iron oxide, and considerable green serpentine or chlor.te, which is dis-
seminated through the mass, and is evidently the alteration product of a
fourth primary constituent.” The rock from the quarry described ‘is
not holocrystalline, but contains a variable amount of glass base, which
is more or less globulitic, with augite microlites having opaque grains
attached, besides larger aggregations of magnetite grains. There is a
comparatively small amount of serpentine in patches, the larger of
which still contain fragments of olivine at their centers, the former
mineral from which the serpentine has been derived. In some places
* the glass base has been colored green, though still isotropic, while in
others it has deen devitrified through decomposing agents. The rock
with the least glass and coarsest grain of crystallization is from the
large columns” near the base of the trap sheet, while that near the same

level but from “small columns shows nearly the same size of crystals
with more glass base.” Higher up in the sheet the rock in medium-
sized columns “ has somewhat smaller feldspar crystals and more glass
base, in places brown and globulitic, with fern-like groups of magnetite
crystals. Midway up the cliff the rock shows still more globulitic and
microlitic glass, and that from 10 feet below the present upper surface
has smaller crystals and rather more glass base. The variations from
bottom to top of the lava are slight but distinctly noticeable, and indi-
cate that the cooling which caused the consolidation of the mass was
more rapid at the top than at the bottom, which corresponds with the
subsequent conditions deemed necessary to produce the different sys-
tems of columnar cracking.” *

102. McCormick discusses the nature of concretions in crystalline
rocks and describes in detail those in the granite in Craftsbury, Ver-
mont. From a study of the literature of the subject two classes of in-
clusions are recognized ; the first are ovoid in structure, seldom sharply ~
defined, and often include nodules. They are believed to be contem-
poraneous with the solidification of the enclosing rock mass. The
second class are generally angular and very dissimilar from the matrix.
In the granite of Craftsbury the inclusions consist of spheroidal nodules
of biotite from one-half to two inches in diameter and often four inches
in length, in some cases much flattened and crumpled. Microscopic ex-
amination shows the mica to be in concentric layers with scattered grains
of quartz, most abundant in the center. They are very difficultly sepa-
rated from the remaining rock, and it is thought that they are masses of
biotite and segregated from the original chloritic mass, and that their
wrinkling indicates an igneous condition of the granite at the time of
their separation.t

103. Danat proposes a nomenclature for metamorphism and porphy-
ritic structure in rocks. For the former, Crystallinic is suggested for
secondary enlargement ; Paramorphic for the results of paramorphism,
and Metachemic for the term ‘‘metasomatic.” In descriptions of por-
phyritic structure it is proposed that such terms as Orthophyric, Leu-
citophyric, Augitophyric, Quartzophyric, etc., be used as adjectives to
indicate at once the structure and the mineral causing it.

PARAMORPHISM, METAMORPHISM, ETC.

The writer is compelled to confine his attention to the American con-
tributions to this subject on account of lack of time and inaccessibility |
of the literature. The many questions connected with the formation of*
crystalline rocks are now being discussed by an increasing number of
observers, who, with the aid of misroscopic petrography, and with wide
opportunities for systematic field survey, obtain results vastly more

valuable than those represented by the hypothetical speculations com-
posing the greater part of the past literature on this subject.

104. Becker’s memoir on the Cretaceous metamorphic rocks of Cali-
fornia will prove especially interesting among those which have ap-
peared during the past year, for his results have been obtained by ex-
ceptionally detailed work with every possible auxiliary in a country
which is stated to be particularly easy of study. It has been found
that sandstones and arkoses of Neocomian age have been altered to
crystalline rocks only differing from those of the Archean by holding
plagioclase instead of orthoclase, and by irregularity of their alteration.
They include metamorphic diabases and diorites and vast quantities of
serpentine. These changes have been traced from slight alteration,
through all stages of the obliteration of evidence of plastic character,
to the final crystalline products. The great masses of serpentine are
found to be derived from the sandstones boch directly and through in-
termediate granular metamorphies: ‘ Highly inclined sandstones strike
into serpentine areas in such a manner as to wholly preclude the sup-
position that the serpentine is an older mass, and instances are ob-
served where one side of an anticlinal is serpentinized while the other
is unaltered and carries excellent fossils. These relations are par-
ticularly clear at Knoxville and Mount Diablo.” In discussing the
causes of these changes it is thought that they were effected in great
part at the time of upheaval by solutions from the underlying granites.
It is supposed that these were at first warm and basic and supplied the
material for the change to augitic and amphibolic holocrystallines.
Serpentinization appears to have followed at a lower temperature, and
finally the greater part of the silica was deposited.*

105. The Trappean and Serpentinous rocks oc urring in a considera-
ble area west of Baltimore have been studied in great detail by G. H.
Williams, who finds them to consist of what are termed “ hypersthene
gabbros,” gabbro-diorites, peridotites and their alteration and paramor-
phic products. Tue firstisa fine-grained, purplish-black aggre ateof hy-

ites. The first two graduate into each other in the field, and microscopic
examination reveals the gradual transition of the second from the first
by change of pyroxene to fibrous-hornb.ende, and some other interest-
ing spec al features. The peridotites break through the oth r in dikes.
They are rarely rich in feldspar, and sometimes this is absent. By
gradual loss of olivine they grade into another massive rock composed
almost wholly of diallage and hypersthene. Thesolivine always appears
to alter to serpentiue, and the pyroxene (no matter what its form) to
hornblende, which suffers further alteration to tale, with separation of
calcite. In the main the hornblende serper tines S, as those of Bare Hills,

et2., have beon formed from eruptives composed of olivine and bronzite,
similar to rocks now found unaltered in their vicinity.*

106. The origin of the ferruginous schists and iron ores of the Lake
Superior district has long been a subject of controversy. In a recent
paper on this subject, Irving discusses the several theories which have
been held and gives a summary of the results of a detailed study of
the ores and schists into which they grade. The general conclusions
arrived at are as follows: In its original condition, the ore-bearing beds
consisted of a series of thinly bedded more or less highly ferriferous
carbonates, interstratified with and grading into carbonaceous shales
closely simulating the beds of carbonates in the coal measures. By a
process of silicification part of the siderite in these beds was broken up
and replaced by silica and the iron segregated into seams, layers, and

-impregnations in a more highly oxidized condition, but it is thought that
in some places the silicifying waters have given rise to actinolitic
magnetite-schists and intermediate products. At some points the sid-
eritic constituent in the original beds appears to have been oxidized in
place, but the larger hematitic deposits are unquestionably secondary.t

107. Van Hise, in a paper on the origin of the mica schists and black
mica slates of the Penokee-Gogebic¢ iron-bearing series, gives an ac-
count of their lithologie characteristics, and discusses the mode of
their formation from clastic materials. Followed along the strike, the
quartzites, slates, and graywackes are found to change through biotic
and chloritic graywackes to mica schists, forming the main mass of the
formation, by alteration of the feldspar and biotite to muscovite with
separation of silica; ‘ the result being a production from a completely
fragmental rock by a metasomatic change, of one presenting every
appearance of a complete original crystallization, and which would or-
dinarily be classed as a genuine crystalline schist.” In the western
part of the district the feldspathic constituent was apparently in
greater proportion, and the rocks there are now entirely mica schists
and slates. +

108. In a note to the American Journal of Science, § Irving corrects
his previous statement that Sorby was the first to call attention to
secondary enlargement of quartz grains in rocks, and states that Tor-
nebohn made this observation several years before.

109. Ina paper before the British Association, entitled “ Some Exam-
ples of Pressure Fluxion in Pennsylvania,” Lewis describes his studies
upon some localities where evidences of this phenomena is found. The
principal one is the belt of Laurentian rocks crossing the Schuylkill
20 miles above Philadelphia, which are considered to be purely of erup-
tive origin, consisting of syenites, acid gabbros, trap granulites, and other

igneous rocks often highly metamorphosed.* The rocks are massive
in the center of this belt, but the outer portions have ** been enormously
compressed,.folded, and faulted, with the result of producing a tough,
banded, porphyritic fluxion gneiss, identical with the milonite of Lap-
worth or the sheared gneiss of Peach and Horne. So perfect is the
fluxion structure that the rock resembles a rhyolite. Asin the banded
granulite of Lehmann, elongated feldspar eyes lie in flowing streams of
biotite grains and broken quartz, the streams often parting and again
meeting around the porphyritic eyes. Occasional crystalline eyes of
hornblende remain, but most of it has been converted into biotite.

A point of especial interest is that the feldspar of the eyes is quite
colorless and free from inclusions, like the sanidine of recent lavas;
while, on the other hand, the feldspars of the inner and massive portions
of the zone, out of which this outer portion has been reformed by
pressure fluxion, are full of inclusions and have the dusty appearance
so common in ancient feldspars. The fresh-looking feldspar eyes have
therefore very possibly been subsequently formed as the result of a
recrystallization of the old material under the influence of pressure
fluxion. In similar manner the biotite has been made out of the old
hornblende, garnets have been developed, and quartz has been granu-
lated and optically distorted by pressure. Associated Cambrian strata
with Scolithus stems shows evidence of the great pressure, and its
stems and pebbles are pulled out and flattened. Other localities are
found showing various phases of lamination by pressure, and it is ex-
pected that further study will reveal more.*

«110. Another paper bearing on the same subject is one by Lawson,
entitled “Some Instances of Gneissic Foliation and Schistose Cleavage
in Dikes and their bearing upon the Problem of the Origin of the Ar-
chean Rocks.” Its author describes anumber of graniticand dioritic dikes
in the Lake of the Woods region in whick schistose structure is devel-
oped parallel to their walls, and it is thought these instances prove con-
clusively that gneissic foliation is not a proof of bedding. Upon this
premise it is suggested that the gneissic rocks of the Laurentians and
elsewhere may not be sediments metamorphosed in place, but intrusives

‘in which the foliation was induced by pressure, and that their pucker-
ings and crumplings may be due to the increase of bulk during the
crystallization process. ‘To account for the lamination and alternation
of beds in the yourger gneisses it is supposed that they were under less
pressure and more liquid, so that their materials could separate into
zones determined by specific gravity and melting points.t

111. In a paper on supermetamorphism Comstock calls attention to
instances in the San Juan district where Silurian and Devonian beds
grade into a granitic rock which is underlain by quartzite. t

112. Dale, in a paper on the metamorphism'in the Rhode Island coal
basin, describes an area north of that previously studied, in which the
beds are greatly disturbed and the alteration intense. The slates and
clays are found changed to mica schists, holding garnet, staurolite,
ete., and separated from equally crystalline beds, at least in part of
Paleozoic age, by plumbaginous argillite, with veins of mica and coal
ferns.*

113. Kaolinization.—Lesley, in a paper on the Kaolin of southeastern
Pennsylvania, discusses kaolinization, and suggests that this process
and the resulting rock decay may be greatly increased by the presence
of limestone. Itis thought that this would account for some of the
features observed in the district studied and in various belts of spe-
cially decayed rocks; for instance, on the eastern side of Hoosac Mount-
ain and in parts of the Southern States.t The relation of decay to
joint planes is also considered, and Ashburner, t in an examination of a
kaolin deposit in Delaware County, finds evidence confirming Lesley’s
views.

114. On the origin of coal.—Lesquereux, in a very interesting and sug-
gestive paper on this subject, urges the peat-bog theory with a great
mass of evidence from his own observations in the European peat bogs
and the coal measures of the United States, §

TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES OF LAKE SHORES.

115. Inapaper on this subject Gilbert discusses the several agents con-
cerned in the formation of the shores of water bodies in which tidal
action was insignificant in its results. The studies leading to the memoir
were in large part upon the topographic features of the lacustral de-
posits of the great fossil lakes of the Great Basin, and supplemental
observations have been made on the shores of some existing lakes.
Omitting considerations of tidal action, the agents concerned in the
production of shore features are waves and currents created by the
wind. The wind which drives waves toward a shore produces also a
system of currents—superficial currents toward the shore and along the
shore, and an inferior current, the undertow, away from the shore.
The waves erode, and the waves and shore current in combination
transport the eroded material, shore drift, in the direction of the shore
current. Under certain clearly indicated conditions the shore drift is
deposited, its accumulation taking the form of spits, bars, hooks, ete.
In the region of erosion the land is planed away just below the water
surface, and this planed surface in the fossil condition becomes a ter-
race. The shoreward limit of erosive action is marked by a cliff. In

the region where there is neither erosion nor deposition, but transpor-
tation only, the shore drift takes the form of a beach, and if the land
is gently inclined a lagoon is separated behind the beach, which is
then called a barrier. Points of land are usually eroded by waves,
while bays are filled or partitioned off by bars; the waves of a lake
thus tend to straighten its shores. Other shore features treated are
the delta, whose anatomy as well as morphology is described, and the
‘shore wall, a feature resulting in cold climates from the expansive force
of ice.

The topographic elements constituting shores have-sometimes been
confused with similar elements of different origin, and the criteria for
discrimination are therefore discussed. A sea-cliff is compared with
cliffs resulting from the unequal hardness of strata, from lateral wear
by streams, from faulting, ete. Shore terraces are compared with ter-
races arising from alternations of hard and soft strata, stream terraces,
fault terraces, etc. Barriers and other shore structures constituting
ridges are compared with moraines and osars.*

and colors voted by the International Geologic Congress at the meet-
ings of the 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th of September and Ist of October, 1881.

RULES TO BE FOLLOWED IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE NOMENCLAT-
URE OF SPECIES.

1. The nomenclature adopted is that in which each being is desig-
nated by a generic and a specific name.

2. Each of these names is composed of a single Latin or Latinized
word, written according to the rules of Latin orthography.

3. A species may present a certain number of modifications, con-
nected together in time or space, and designated respectively under
the name of Mutations or of Varieties; modifications having a doubt-
ful origin are simply called Forms. Modifications will be indicated,
when necessary, by a third term preceded, according to each case, by
the words variety, mutation, or form, or by the corresponding abbrevi-
ations.

4. The specific name should always be defined by indicating the
name of the author who established it; this author’s name is placed in
parenthesis when the primitive generic name is not kept, and in this
case it is useful to add the name of the author who changed the generic
reference. The same process is applicable to varieties when elevated
to species.

5. The name attributed to each genus or to each species is that under
which they have been designated the longest on condition that the
characters of the genus and of the species shall have been published
and clearly defined. Priority will not go back beyond Linnzeus, twelfth
eclition, 1766.

6. In future, for specific names, priority will have been irrevocably
acquired only when the species shall have been not only described, but
also figured.

The fossiliferous localities are three in number, and all are in the eastern
belt. From the first, situated midway between Chatham and Ghent, only
crinoid stems have been taken. The second is situated at the crossing of
the New York and Mahopac Railroad, 2 miles north of Chatham; and the
third a mile still farther north, on the farm of Mr. Joel Angell; and these
two have furnished the fossils mentioned. Several well-marked valves of
Leptena sericea and *Strophomena alternata. The external markings of the
gasteropods are so effaced by metamorphism and weathering that it is very
difficult to distinguish species. There are several species of a slender Mur-

Ophileta in abundance, one incomplete Orthoceras, and a well-preserved new
species of the genus Ptilodictya.

Considers these fossils of Trenton age, and that there can be no reasonable

An attempt to prove that the Olenellus beds are older than the Paradoxides

divisions of the American and Scandinavian primordial faunas. The aa-
thor thinks he has demonstrated that the Olenellus zone in America as
well as in Europe represents the oldest trilobite-bearing fauna so far
known. Outside of America the genus Olenellus is represented by the one
species only of O. Wahklenbergii, Torell, = O. Kjerulfi, Iai (Which is
quite probably a Paradoxides.)

In conclusion, the progressive may be compared with the retrogressive evolu-
tion of the Vertebrata, as follows: In the earlier periods and with the
lower forms, retrogressive evolution predominated. In the higher classes,
progressive evolution has predominated. When we consider the nature of
the first class of vertebrates (the Tunicata) in this respect, and compare it
with that of the last class (the Mammalia), the contrast is very great.

In the Naturalist for June, 1885, the author gave a synopsis of the genera of
this suborder, which was partly based on information derived from Pro-
fessor Marsh’s work. Among them was included the supposed genus
Tetheopsis, whose character consisted in the absence of inferior canine
and incisor teeth. The author now learns on good authority that the
symphyseal region in the specimen in question is entirely constructed of
plaster of Paris. The genus Tetheopsis must then be regarded as an arti-
fact.

The basal part of a skull which the author described under the head of Uinta-
therium lacustre, Marsh (U. 8. Geol. Survey Terr., 111, p. 592), turns out to

of the Kansas Chalk, which have been described under the generic head of
Erisichthe Cope. Several species are known (see Bulletin U.S. Geol. Sur-
vey Terrs., 111, 1887), and one of them is probably the Xiphias Dixoni of
Agassiz, from the chalk of Sussex, England. These genera can not be re-
ferred to any of the existing orders of fishes, on account of the peculiar
structure of the pectoral arch. The author therefore places them in an
especial one, the Actinoplert (see Proceedings Amer. Assoc. Adv. Science,

The total number of genera is nine, of species twenty-six. The development
of the camels in North America presents a remarkable parallel to that of
the horses. The ancestors of both lines appear together in the Wasatch or
lowest Eocene, and the successive forms develop side by side in all the sue-
ceeding formations. Camels and horses are standard types in all our Ter-
tiary formations; and they must be learned by any one who wishes to dis-
tinguish readily the horizons one from the other. The horse forms are
more numerous in all the beds in individuals as well as in species.

tween the vertrebral centra on their inferior side. Apparently homologous
elemenst occur in the dorsal and cervical regions of Sphenodon, and in the
cervical regions of various other lizards, Similar pieces are found in the
dorsal and caudal regions of various mammalia, for instance, Frinaceus.
But in general they are wanting from the Mammalia, and are better de-
veloped in the Polycosauria than in any other order of reptiles.

Considers it probable that we have in the Embolomeri that order of Batrachia
from which the Reptilia were derived, through intermediate forms not yet
discovered. And that the Sphenosauride can not be referred to this order
as proposed by him, but constitute a family of Rhachitomi.

Thinks that the development of the dorsal part of the vertebral column in Cricotus
is in an opposite direction to that stated by Fritsch to characterize the
Sphenosauride. This is the main point to be proven. If further he has
shown that the larger dorsal bodies of Cricotus are homologous with the
centra of the Polycosauria and Lacertilia, the proposition remains proven
that the inferior vertebral bodies of the Rhachitomi and the entire vertebral
bodies of existing Batrachia are intercentra and not centra.

These observations are derived from a part of the skull of one of the Diadectide
(Pelycosauria in the transverse molar teeth), of a single individual of un-
determined species. <A few characters are derived from skulls of two allied
species, Diadecdes phaseolinus and Empedias molaris Cope, which, like the
first-named specimen, were derived from the Permian formation of Texas.
The prominent features of this brain are the following: The widest partis
at the origin of the trigeminus nerve. Both the cerebellum and optic tha-
lamus are flat and simple. The hemispheres are narrower than the seg-
ments posterior to them and of greater vertical diameter. The epiphysis
is cnormons and sends a process posteriorly between the tables of the parie-
tal bone. The olfactory lobes were apparently large and had a greater
transverse diameter than the hemispheres. The reduced diameter of the
hemispheres is a character of fishes and batrachia rather than of reptiles,
but the thalami are also smaller than is the case in batrachia. The small,
flat cerebellum is rather batrachian than reptilian.

The result of this examination into the structure of the auditory organs in the
Diadectide may be stated as follows: The semicircular canals have the
structure in common to all Gnathostomatous Chordata. The internal wall
of the vestibule remains unossified as in many fishes and afew batrachians.
There is no rudiment of the cochlea, but the vestibule is produced outwards
and upwards to the fenestra ovalis in a way unknown in any other fam-
ily of vertebrates.

I may add that in the specimen examined the semicircular canals were filled
with a white calcareous powder, probably derived from the comminution
of otolites.

Fossils are not to be looked for in a coarse mica schist or gneiss, or in coarsely
crystalline limestone. With even the metamorphic change producing a
hydromica schist, the disappearance of fossils is to be expected, though not
always a fact; and that producing a coarse mica schist necessarily exter-
minates fossils. In conclusion, the author believes we may safely regard
the Canaan fossils as proof that the limestones and schists of the Taconic
system (sic) are not older than the Potsdam sandstone.

Daviges, W. Note on Prof. E. D. Cope’s article upon Edestus and Pe-
lecopterus, etc. (Geol. Mag., new ser., Decade I, vol. I, pp. 141,
142, March, 1886. London.)

“Professor Cope is, I think, mistaken in assigning Xiphias Diconi to Agassiz.
The name first appears in a paper by Dr. Leidy” ‘On Saurocephalus and
its Allies,” in the Trans. Amer. Philos. Soce., vol. xt, p. 91, where the name
was given to the prolonged ethmoid bone referred by Sir Philip Egerton
to Sawrocephalus lanciformis, as then understood.

In that paper Dr. Leidy proves that the teeth assigned by Agassiz to the Sauro-
cephalus of Harlan, had no relation to that genus, and he refers the jaws
and teeth from the English chalk to a new genus under the name of Pro-
tosphyrena, Leidy. The ‘‘rostral” bones described by Sir Philip Egerton,
he contended, did not belong to Protosphyrana, but to a species of Xiphias,
to which he gave the trivial name of XY. Dizoni. Subsequently Professor
Cope described his genus Lrisichthe, which certainly embodies both of
Leidy’s species. I may mention here that the prolonged ethmoids are
found in our Chalk, Upper Greensand, and Gault; and here also are found
(and in no other deposit) the peculiar fin-rays referred to Ptychodus by
Agassiz. From this association the inference is natural that the ethmoids
and fins belong to the same species of fish, viz, the Protosphyrana of Leidy,
Lrisichthe Cope. (See Paper by W. Davies, F. G.8., on Saurocephalus lan-

11. Basals symmetrical; odd ambalacrum linear.

The following is an attempt at an abstract of the work on American forms :
Regulares, E. & C., 1886.

Pentremilide, D’Orbigny, 1852 (Emend. E. & C., 18868).

Pentremiles, Say, 1820 (Emend. E. & C., 1886), type.

Encrina Godoni, De France. This genus as restricted is essentially Carbonif-
erous and strictly American, with one possible exception, P. ovatis,
Goldfuss.

P. Godoni, var. major, var. nov.

Pentremitide, D’Orbigny, 1849 (Emend. E. & C., 1882). Type Pentremites
Palletti, de Verneuil. This genus is limited to the Devonian Period, and
in America to the Hamilton Group, which contains at least two, and per-
haps six, species.

Mesoblastus,* gen. nov. Type Pentremites crenulatus, Roemer. This is essen-
tially a Carboniferous genus, and occurs on both sides of the Atlantic.
The authors think it probable that Granatocrinus glaber, M. & W., should
be referred to this group, and also some other American species, hitherto
described under Granatocrinus.

Troostoblastidae, Kh. & C., 1886.

Troostocrinus, F. B. Shumard, 1865 (Emend. E. & C., 1886).

Type Pentremiles Reinwardtii, Troost. The type species is characteristic of the
Niagara Period of America. No Devonian species are known, but if, as
the authors suspect, P. Grosvenori, Shumard, be referable to this genus, it
reappeared in the upper strata of the American Carboniferous limestone.

Metablastus, gen. noy. Type Pentremites lineatus, Shumard. The authorsrefer
doubtfully to this genus, Pentremiles subcylindricus, Hall, and Codaster penta-
lobus, Hall, from the Niagara group; most of the forms are from the
American Carboniferous system. The type series occurs in the Upper
Burlington limestone, two are found in the Keokuk and two more in the
Warsaw limestone, though none are known in the Kaskaskia limestone, so
rich in Pentremitles.

Tricelocrinus, Meek & Worthen, 1868. Type Pentremites Woodmani, Meek &
Worthen. This is an essentially Carboniferous type, and, so far as we at
present know, it is limited to the Keokuk and St. Louis groups of the
American Carboniferous system; four species are known, though it is
probable that two of them are identical. Tricwlocrinus Meekianus, sp.
nov., Warsaw limestone, Spurgen Hill, Indiana.

Nucleoblastide, E. & C., 1886.

I. Subfamily Lleocrinidw, BE. & C., 1886.

* Mécoc, intermediate.
NORTH AMERICAN PALAONTOLOGY. 247

ETHERIDGE, ROBERT, JR., and P. HERBERT CARPENTER—Continued.
Eleacrinus, F. Roemer, 1851 (Emend. Hall, 1862). Type Pentremites Verneuili,
Troost. This is purely a Devonian genus, and appears to be generally dis-
tributed throughout that formation in the United States and Canada, but
is unknown in rocks of a similar age in Europe. There appear to be no
species common to the Lower and Upper Devonian. Elwacrinus Ferneuili,
var. pomum, var. nov., Columbus, Ohio; Corniferous limestone, Clarke
County, Indiana; Upper Helderberg group, Lower Devonian.

Eleacrinus sp. ?
uw. Subfamily Schizoblastide, E. & C., 1886.

Schizoblastus, E. & C., 1882. Type Pentremites Sayi, Shumard. 8. melonoides
and S. Sayt are limited to the Burlington group. These would ve the earli-
est species of the genus, unless the Pentremites Sampsoni of Hambach form
the underlying Chouteau limestone, or Shumard’s P. Missouriensis should
prove to be a Schizoblasius. The authors know of no species of it above the
Burlington limestone, with the possible exception of Granatocrinus granu-
losus, M. & W., which occurs in the Keokuk limestone of Indiana and IIli-
nois, Only four species are recognized as belonging certainly to this group,
though eight others, it is thought, may belong to it.

Cryptoblastus, gen. nov. Type Pentremites melo, Owen & Shumard. The genus
is exclusively confined to the Subcarboniferous of America, three species
belonging to the Burlington limestone and one to the St. Louis; but four
species are recognized.

Granatoblastide, E. & C., 1886. Granatocrinus (Troost, 1849; Hall, 1862)
(Emend. E. & C., 1882). Type Pentremites Norwoodi, Owen & Shumard.
Of the sixteen species which have been described in America @. Norwodi,
the type of the genus, is the only one which they can with any certainty
refer to this genus; it occurs in the Burlington limestone. The genus, as
now defined, is strictly limited to rocks of Carboniferous age.

Heteroblastus,* gen. nov. Type H. Cumberlandi, sp. nov. ? Pentremites cornutus,
M. & W., St. Louis limestone, is the only American species referred to this
genus.

Codasteride, E. & C., 1886.
I. Subfamily Phenoschismide, E. & C., 1886.
Codaster, McCoy, 1849. Type Codaster trilobatus, McCoy.

The authors are prepared to admit five or perhaps nine species of Codaster
though not more, on account of the indefinite manner in which certain go-
called Codasters have been described and figured. In Britain there is only
one C. trilobatus, the type. The American species differ from the British
type in possessing a more elongate form, greater convexity of summit, a
narrow base, and more complex ambulacra. Four of these are well defined,
viz: C. alternatus, C. gracilis, C. Hindei,and C. pyramidatus. Doubtful
Species are: C. Americanus, C. pulchellus, C. Whitei, and Pentremites sub-
truncatus. If C. pulchellus, Miller & Dyer, from the Niagara group be
rightly so named, this genus has the most extended geological range of all
the Blastoidea, Commencing in the Upper Silurian of America, it is well
represented both in the Upper Helderberg and in the Hamilton group, of
the Devonian, especially the latter; while the doubtful C. Whitei, Hall, oe-
curs in the transition bed between the Upper Burlington and the Keokuk
of the Subcarboniferous. The type species (C. trilobatus) is fairly abun-
dant in the Carboniferous limestone of Lancashire and Yorkshire, and may
be considered, they suppose, as the last survivor of the genus.

* Erepoc, unusual.
248 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

ETHERIDGE, Roper, JR., and P. HERBERT CARPENTER—Continued.

Phenoschisma, E. & C.,1332.. Type Pentatrematites acuta, G. B. Shy. There
appear to be three species in the Carboniferous rocks of America. ? Pentre-
mites (Codaster) Kentuckiensis, Shumard, and two species from New Mexico
which Mr. Wachsmuth will describe.
ui. Subfamily Cryptoschismide, E. & C., 1886.
Orophocrinus, von Seebach, 1864. Type Pentremites stelliformis, Owen and
Shumard. Three American species are referred to this genus, all confined
to rocks of the Carboniferous period—Codonites campanulatus, Hambach, C.
gracilis, M. & W., and the type species. The genus occurs in rocks of the
same age in England, Ireland and Belgium.

Order Irregulares, E. & C., 1886.
This order has been established to contain three very remarkable genera:
Eleutherocrinus of Shumard & Yandell, two species of which occur in the
Devonian rocks of America, and the British genera Astrocrinites and Pente-
phyllum.

Astrocrinitide, T. & T. Austin, 1843 (mend. E. & C.), This family is divided
into two groups. The first contains Hleutherocrinus and Astrocrinites, T. &
T. Austin ; the second Pentephyllum, Haughton.

Review and abstract of.

“The description of the various species of Blastoids is very limited both in
space and time. A few species appear to be common to the Upper and
Lower Devonian of America, buteach of the great divisions of the Sub-car-
boniferous in the Mississippi Valley seems to have its own particular types.
No Blastoid occurs on both sides of the Atlantic ; one species is common to
the Devonian of Spain and Germany, and another to the Carboniferous
limestone of Britain and Belgium. But, with these exceptions, the range
of individual specific types is very limited indeed.”

denda. Pl. vi., 1885. Paris.)

Considers that Anaptomorphus and Necrolemur, which Mr. Cope had thought
might be identical, although evidently belonging to the same group of
Lemuroids, are too different to be joined zoologically under the same name.

Mr. Cope says ‘‘ that the Hyrachius is the American Lophiodon, for there are
only slight differences between them; both exist in France, the second in
the lower Parisian, the first in the Phosphorites.” ‘The present author
thinks it probable that the Hyrachius, animals descending from the Lophi-
odon, lived both on the old and new continent and were represented in
France by four species, H. priscus, H. Donvillei, H. Zeilleri, ar.d H. interme-
dius.

Future discoveries will enable us to understand the changes effected in the
Hyrachius, which must have modified themselves progressively to give birth
to the Tapirs. °

clearly allied to P. élandicus, a Brachypleural species and an undoubted
Paradovides ; and (3) that it is a Menevian species in America; all appear
to me to indicate that it is a Menevian species in Europe also, and that, the

the most northern locality in the State where the members of the group of
Foraminifera have been found. He also received from approximately the
same locality Arredonda, Alachua County, specimens containing Nummulites
floridanus, Orbitoides,and Operculina rotella (O. complanata?).

Some marine Eocene fossils from the neighborhood of Paducah, Kentucky, have
also been received, and a list of the genera is given; the horizon is con-
sidered to be that of the older Tertiaries of Maryland and Virginia.

undertaken under the Ausnices of the Wagner Free Institute of
Science of Philadelphia. (Trans. Wagner Free Institute Sci., vol.
——., pp. 65-127, 1886. Philadelphia.)

The author concludes that there is not a particle of evidence sustaining the
coral theory of growth of the peninsula. The formations represented in
the State are the Oligocene, Miocene, Pliocene, and Post-Pliocene, which
follow each other in regular succession, beginning with the oldest, from
the north to the south, thus clearly indicating the direction of growth of
the peninsula. No indisputable Eocene rocks have thus far been identified
in the State, but not improbably some such exist in the more northerly
sections, and possibly include even a part of what has generally been re-
ferred to the Oligocene. Fresh-water streams, and consequently, dry land,
existed in the more southern parts of the peninsula during the Pliocene
period, as is proved by the interassociation of marine and fluviatile mol-
lusks in the deposits of the Caloosahatchie. The modern fauna of the coast
is indisputably a derivative, through successive evolutionary changes of
the pre-existing faunas of the Pliocene and Miocene periods of the same
region, and the immediate ancestors of many of the living forms, but
slightly differing in specific characters, can be determined among the Plio-
cene fossils of the Caloosahatchie. The doctrine of evolution thus receives
positive and most striking confirmation from the past invertebrate fauna
of the Floridan region.

Man’s great antiquity on the peninsula is established beyond a doubt, and not
improbably the fossilized remains found on Sarasota Bay, now wholly
converted into limonite, represent the most ancient belongings of man that
have ever been discovered.

these the following new species are described: Fusus Caloosaensis, Fascio-

besides the presence of types undoubtedly new and approximating Mesozoic
forms, the great diminution of typical Carboniferous species is noteworthy.
Of one hundred and twenty-three species enumerated by Meek from the
coal measures along the Missouri River in Nebraska, not more than a dozen
run up into the Permian. There are some indications of unconformity be-
tween the coal measures and the Permian, but further. investigation is re-

with a numerous fauna is found in eastern Mississippi. It is parallel to
the strataimmediately below the Claiborne protile. Its fauna is Claiborn-
ian, but approaches the Jacksonian.

Morris, CHARLES. Methods of Defense in Organisms. (Proc. Acad.
Nat. Sci., vol. , pp. 25-29, March, 1886. Philadelphia.)

Throughout the whole history of the organic realm one principle holds good.
There has been a continued evolution of more rapid and varied powers of
motion. To this every advance in organization bas tended, while the hin-
derances to speed and flexibility have been successively discarded by the
higher forms of life. In correspondence with this has been the develop-
ment of mentality, since mentality, as outwardly displayed by the ani-
mals below man, is indicated by a greater intricacy of motions, in combi-
nation with ambush and concealment. For the attainment of the highest
possible speed and strength little mentality was requisite, and brain de-
velopment is manifested rather by intricacy than speed of motion—or rather
by that well-ordered correlation of rest and diversified motion suited to
the best good of the organism. Yet we must regard mentality as rather
the effect than the cause of motor evolution. Probably the power of di-
versified motion appeared first while the exercise of any new power of this
kind acted as an agent in the development of the brain. In other words,
the evolution of the brain is a consequence of that of the body—not the

reverse. P. 29.

agara formation. In Americathere is also C. cellulosum N. and M. from the

Labechide, Nich.

Labechia, Edwards and Haime, 1851. Type L. conferta, Lonsd. Two species at
least of Lower Silurian age occur in North America, 1. Canadensis, Nich.
and Mur., Trenton limestone, and L. Ohioensis, n. s., Cincinnati group.

Dictyostroma, Nich. Type D. undulatum. Niagara limestone.

Beatricea, Billings. Types Bb. undulata and BL. nodulosa. The balance of evi-
dence seems to the author to be in favor of regarding Beatricea as an ab- ‘
normal type of the Stromatoporoids.

Stromatoporida, Nich.

Stromatopora, Goldf. (emend.). Type S. concentrica, Refers to this genus his
own genus, Pachystroma, from the Niagara limestone.

Stromatoporella, nov. gen. Type S. granulata, Nich. From the Hamilton and
Corniferous formations of western Canada. Refers to this genus probably
Stromatopora nulliporoides, Nich., from the Devonian, and the allied or iden-
tical Cenostroma incrustans, Hall and Whitf., from the Devonian.

Syringostroma, Nich. Type S. densum. Nich. From the Devonian rocks of Ohio.

Idiostromide, Nich.

Idiostroma, Winchell, founded for the reception of J. caspitosum and TI. gor-
diaceum, from the Devonian rocks of North America.

Considering that the embedded tubes constitute the essential feature upon
which Cawnopora, Phill., and Diapora., Berg., were founded, the author
thinks that the facts render it absolutely certain that these names can not
be retained as names of genera.

Concludes that ‘‘the fossils ordinarily called ‘ Caunopora’ and ‘ Diapora’ are
the results of the combined growth of some stromatoporoid with some
coral, the former usually being a species of Stromatopora or Stromatoporella,
and the latter generally belonging either to Syringopora or to Aulopora
We must also conclude, however, that there are other fossils in general
aspect exceedingly similar to the ordinary ‘ Caunopora,’ in which the em-
bedded tubes really do belong to the organism in which they are found, as
we have seen to be the case in Jdiostroma oculatum. In practice, therefore,
each individual specimen must, with our present knowledge, be judged on
its own merits, apart from all preconceived theories. Moreover, as the
‘ Caunopore’ and ‘ Diapore’ show many points of interest which are quite
independent of any hypothesis as to their actual nature, I shall, where
needful, describe and figure any noticeable features in connection with the
‘ Caunopora-state’ of certain Stromatoporoids, irrespective of all theoret-
ical views as to the precise nature of this ‘ state.’”

OWEN, RICHARD. Ona New Perissodactyle Ungulata from Wyoming.
(Geol. Mag., new ser., Decade I1,. vol. I, p. 140, March, 1886.
London.)

In the Geological Magazine for February, 1886, it is stated, p.50, that no Peris-
sodactyle mammal was known to possess tubercular teeth. Professor Cope
does not supply the characters to which his term ‘‘ tubercular” is applica-
ble. Sir Richard then says that he figured tubercular molars of Pliolophus
from the Eocene in his Paleontology (2d ed., 1861), and that an earlier ex-
ample is found in the genus Hyracotherium, described and figured in “ Brit-
ish Fossil Mammals aud Birds,” 8vo., 1846, p. 422, cut 166; also from ‘‘ Lon-
don Clay.” He states that his estimates of the claims of Elephants and
Mastodons to rank as an ‘‘ Order” rests upon the multilamellate structure,
size, and succession of their ‘‘ grinders,” subordinate to which dental char-
acter may be cited a vertebral one, necessitating their special instrument,
the proboscis. ;

Describes the new genus and species Microconodon tenuirostris. This genus is
founded upon the specimen in the collection of the Academy of Natural
Sciences of Philadelphia, which was described by Emmons as Dromathe-
rium. He also re-describes Dromatherium sylvestre Emmons. There are
some portions of jaws described by Emmons from the Upper Triassic (Chat-

PackARD, A. S. Geological Extinction and some of its Apparent
Causes. (Amer. Nat., vol. xx, pp. 29-40, January, 1886. Philadel-

‘That there is a limit to the age of species as well as to individuals almost goes
without saying. As there is in each individual a youth, manhood, and old
age, so species and orders rise, culminate, and decline.” (This view was
first propounded by Prof. Alpheus Hyatt.—Ed.) The causes, however com-
plex, are, in the case of plants and animals, apparently physical; they are
general and pervasive in their effects, and have been in operation since life
began; there have been critical periods in paleontological as well as geo-
logical history, and periods of rapid and wide-spread extinction as well as
continual, progressive dying out of isolated species.

Purnam, F. W. Discovery of Mastodon Skull at Shrewsbury. (Proe.
Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., vol. XXIIL, p. 242, June, 1886. Boston.)

Mr. F. W. Putnam referred to the discovery of the mastodon skull at Shrews-
bury a vear ago, and described the continuation of the exploration of the
peat deposit this autumn by the Worcester Society of Natural History,
when a human skull was found. As stated to him by Dr. Raymenton, who
took out the human skull, both skulls lay on the blue clay bottom of an
ancient pond and were covered with from 6 to8 feet of peat formation.

The author concludes that Hindia fibrosa is no doubtful form, not belonging at
all to the sponges, as Professor Steinmann thought he was obliged to as-
sume, but a well-characterized, true tetracladine siliceous sponge.

SCHRENK, JOSEPH. A.G. Nathorst on the Nomenclature of the Leaves
of Fossil Dicotyledons. (Bull. Torrey Botan. Club, vol. x1, No. 3,
p. 38, March, 1886. New York.)

Abstract and translation of an article by A. G. Nathorst, in vol. xxv, numbers
1 and 2, of the Botanisches Centralblatt, on the difficulties which present
themselves to the paleontologist in classifying and naming fossil dicoty-
ledons on the characters of their leaves only, and proposes to designate
those species of which the leaves only are known by the name of the genus
with which they agree best, with the addition of the termination phyllum.

In order to meet another difficulty, the author proposes to adopt a ternary
nomenclature. Suppose a leaf were found in Japan which resembles Acer
trilobatum so much that it would not be advisable to make 4 new species of
it, although the similarity is not perfect; this leaf ought to be called Acer
trilobatum Japonicum. i

THORELL, T. On Proscorpius osbornei, Whitfield. (Amer. Nat., vol.
XX, pp. 269-274, March, 1886. Philadelphia.)

The author can not find that Proscorpius differs essentially from the hitherto
knowp scorpionsin other respects than in the somewhat shorter cephalothoraz,
and perhaps iv the form of the mandibles. Its systematical position ap-
pears to him to be in the close vicinity of Palwophonus, and especially of
the Scotch scorpion referred to that genus by Mr. Peach. An additional
reason to those given above for removing Proscorpius from the Carbonifer-
ous Loscorpioide, and for referring this genus to the Apoxypodes, fam. Pale-
ophonoide, may be found inits being, geologically speaking, almost con-
temporary with the Palwophoni, belonging, like these, to the Upper Silu-
rain formation. As the Palwophoni, and all other more recent scorpions,
are undoubted land animals and air-breathers, and asno traces of branchize
have been shown to exist in Proscorpius, there is, he believes, no serious
reason for considering that this scorpion is an aquatic animal, or that ‘we
have here a link between the true aquatic forms, the Lurypterus and Ptery-
gotus, and the true air-breathing scorpions of subsequent periods,” as Mr.
Whitfield supposes.

, pp. 65, 302, March and September, 1886. Philadelphia.)

Same, author’s edition, pp. 65-334, contains, in addition to the article in the pro-
ceedings, an index of all generic and specific names used in connection with
the Palewocrinidea. The total number of genera recognized in this work is
156; species, 1,276. Of the genera, 61 were found exclusively in America,
48 exclusively in Europe, 46 on both continents, and 1 exclusively in Aus-
tralia.

Part 111, Section 11, contains the Articulata and the Inadunata.

The Articulata include the group formerly defined by the authors under the
family name of Ichthyocrinide, with the addition of Crotalocrinus and
Enallocrinus, which possess in a remarkable degree some of the most char-

acteristic features of the group.

The Articulata are divided into two families, the Ichthyoecrinide and the Cro-
talocrinidaw, which are defined andthe genera enumerated.

The Inadunata are divided into two branches, Larviformia and Fistulata W.
and Sp. The Larviformia comprise the families Haplocrinide, Synbatho-
crinidiew, Cupressocrinide and Gasterocomide, which are defined.

Under the Haplocrinide are placed only two genera, Haplocrinus, Steininger,
and Allagecrinus, Ether. and Carp.

Under the Synbathocrinide, W. and Sp., are placed the genera Synbathocrinus,
Phinocrinus, Stylocrinus, Stortingocrinus, Pisocrinus, Triacrinus, and Lageni-
ocrinus. They are uncertain whether to place Rhopalocrinus, W. and Sp.
(Rev. 1, p. 57), among the Synbathocrinide, Cupressocrinide, Gastero-
crinide, or be made a distinct group.

The Cupressocrinoid, Roemer, consist of only one genus, Cupressocrinns, Gold-
fuss.

The Gasterocomide embrace the following genera: Gasterocoma, Nanocrinua,
and Vyrtillocrinus.

The branch Fistulata contains the Cyathocrinidz as previously defined by the
authors, but which they now divide into Hybocrinidx, Heterocrinidx, Ano-
malocrinidie, Cyathocrinidi, and Poteriocrinide. To these they add the
Belemnocrinide, Astylocrinid, and Encrinide.

Their present Cyathocrinide they subdivide into: Dendrocrinites, embracing
the genera Merocrinus, Carabocrinus, Dendrocrinus, Homocrinus, Ampheristoc-
rinus, and Parisocrinus ; Botryocrinites, embracing the genera Atelestocri-
nus,* n. gen. (and the new species 4. delicatus and A. robustus are described
under it), Vasocrinus, Botryocrinus, Sicyocrinus, Streptocrinus, and ? Baryeri-
nus. Cyathocrinites, embracing the genera without azygous plate, with
branch-arms without pinules; Cyathocrinus, Arachnocrinus, Gissocrinus,
Spherocrinus, Achradocrinus, Codiacrinus, and (?) Lecythiocrinus.

They subdivide the Poteriocrinidw as follows: Poteriocrinites embracing the
genera Poéeriocrinus, Scaphiocrinus, Scytalocrinus, Decadocrinus, Woodocrinus,
Zeacrinus (and describe the new species Z. nodosus), Hydreionocrinus, Celio-
crinus, Eupachyerinus, Cromyocrinus, and Tribrachiocrinus. Graphiocrinites
embracing the genera Graphiocrinus, Bursacrinus, Phialocrinus, and Cerio-
erinus. Erisocrinites embracing the genera Hrisocrinus and Stemmatocrinus,
and describe the new species S. Trautscholdi. They also define under this
branch the Catillocrinide and Calceocrinide. Under the Hybocrinide, Zit-

Under the Encrinidzx, Pictet, are placed the genera Hnerinus and Dadocrinus.
Under the Astylocrinide, Roemer, are placed the genera Agassizocrinus
and (?) Hdriocrinus. Under the Catillocrinide, W. & Sp., are placed the
genera Catillocrinus and Mycocrinus. Under the Calceocrinide, Meek &

Much of the data given in this paper is embraced in the introduction to thie
“Second Contribution to the Studies of the Cambrian Faunas of North
America” (Bulletin 30, U. 8. Geological Survey), although, owing to the
delay in the publication of the latter, it appeared four months earlier.
The most noticeable addition is the hypothetical map showing the land
area during the deposition of the Middle Cambrian Strata, the description
of its extent, and the disappearance of large portions of it just prior to the
deposition of the formations carrying the Potsdam faunas. This broad
generalization was developed by the study of the geographic and vertical
distribution of the Cambrian faunas.

brian Faunas of North America. (Bull. 30, U.S. Geol. Survey, pp.

In this second contribution, Mr. Walcott has given a review of the strati-
graphy of the Cambrian system in the United States, and a description of
the faunas of the Middle or Georgia horizon of the Cambrian.

In the introduction the principal geologic sections of the Cambrian system are
described and illustrated, and a general description of the Middle Cambrian
horizon and its relations to the Lower and Upper Cambrian are given, and
also the geographic distribution of the fauna on the North American con-
tinent.

In a résumé of the table of the Cambrian faunas of North America the follow-
ing table occurs (bottom of page 61) :

On page 63 a table of the classification of the North American Cambrian rocks
shows that the Cambrian includes the Potsdam sandstone and the Lower
Calciferous of the New York Survey as its upper member, and the Paradoz-
ides beds of Braintree, Massachusetts, St. John, New Brunswick, and St.
John’s, Newfoundland, as the basal member, and the Georgia formation as
the middle division.

The geologic sections given in the introduction show the Cambrian system ‘‘to
have a total thickness of over 13,000 feet, and that its middle division has
a known fauna of 43 genera, represented by 107 species ; also that the Lower
Cambrian or Paradovides fauna has 32 genera and 76 species; that the Upper
Cambrian or Potsdam fauna includes 52 genera and 212species ; that of the
393 species now known from the Cambrian rocks but very few pass up into
the Calciferous horizon of the Lower Silur*’’ (Ordovician), and that the
faunas of the two systems are so distir-_.0 their general facies, and also in
detail, that they are quite as readi1y separated as the Silurian and Devo-
nian, or the Devonian and the Carboniferous.”

Ninety species, eighteen of which are new, are described and illustrated, and
three new genera are proposed—Leptomitus * (Spongiw), Oryctocephalus,t
and Protypus (Trilobita). The almost unknown genera Ethmophyllum,
Meek (Spongix), and Olenoides, Meek (Trilobita), are described; and the
genus Microdiscus, Emmons (Trilobita) is redefined and based on another
species, as its type species is considered to be an embryonic form of Trinu-
cleus concentricus.

Paragraphs 119 and 120, page 57, state that: ‘‘ Reviewing the Middle Cambrian
fauna as a whole, we find that it combines the characters of both the Lower
Cambrian and the Upper Cambrian faunas, and yet is distinct from either
of them. There does not appear to be an equivalent faunain the Cambrian
system of Europe, either in Bohemia, the Scandinavian area, or in Wales.
The nearest approach to it is on the island of Sardinia.” (See close of re-
marks on the genus Lthmophyllum, p. 20.)

“The conditions that developed the Middle Cambrian fauna appear to have
been largely peculiar to the American continent. During the deposition
of the St. John series of the Lower Cambrian or Paradoxides strata, we learn
from the European and eastern American section that the fauna was essen-

- tially of the same type over the entire basin (Atlantic), and from the evi-
dence known to date that the fauna did not extend west of a line passing
northeast through eastern Massachusetts to New Brunswick and Newfound-
land.”

The illustrations are wood-cuts, and are very good of their kind.

The apparent identity of one or two of those species from the Black Hills with
some which were found at the Cafion City locality, and of one or two species
from the latter locality*with some of those at Como, Wyoming, suggests an
identity of horizon at the three localities; but even if the identity referred

to is real the horizon of each locality may be more or less different, for it is
believed that some of the species then existing may have passed from
282 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

WHITE, CHARLES A.—Continued.

one horizon to another, even as certain fresh-water species are now known
to have passed from the Laramie up into the Wasatch group. The char-
acter of the strata in which these fresh-water Jurassic fossils were found,
both at the Colorado and Wyoming localities, in addition to the character
of the fossils themselves, is such as to indicate for them a lacustrine and
not an estuary or fluviatile origin. If the strata at both localities really
contain an identical fauna, it may be regarded as probable that they were
deposited in the same lake. The distance between the Colorado and the
Wyoming localities indicates that the supposed lake was nearly 200 miles
across; and if the Black Hills fossils also belonged to the same contempora-
neous fauna, the assumed lake was much larger.

Indeed in view of the evidence we have (derived from both the vertebrate and
invertebrate fossils) of the existing continental conditions and in view of
the limited extent of recognized marine Jurassic deposits in North America
and the doubtful age of some of the deposits which have teen referred to
that period, one can not say with confidence that any considerable part of
the present North American continent was beneath the sea during any por-
tion of the Jurassic period. In conclusion the author thinks it may be
safely assumed that the great inland portion of our continent was not so
permanently the seat of oceanic waters during Mesozoic time as has been
supposed.

A synopsis and figures of all the known fresh-water fossils which have been
discovered in the Jurassic rocks of North America is given, and the follow
ing new species are described: Unio Felchii, U. toxonotus, U. macropisthus,
U. iridoides, U. lapilloides, Limnea ativuncula, L. consortis, L.? accelerata, -
Vorticifex Stearnsii.

Fauna to that of the succeeding Fresh-Water Eocene and other groups.

ington.)

Concludes that the strata in the western portion of our national domain form
one uninterrupted series from the lowest of the marine Cretaceous forma-
tions to the top of the Bridger group, the uppermost of the fresh-water
Eocene series, inclusive, both on account of the stratigraphical relations
and the character and distribution of the fossil contents of the respective
groups of strata.

The author gives a table showing the range of the species collected at the
Wales locality on the western side of the San Pete Valley, with the addi-
tion of the Helix and Pupa obtained by Professor Cope from his Puerco
group in New Mexico.

The new species described are the following: Unio rectoides, Acella micronema,
Physa bullata, Acroloxus aclinophorus, Helix nacimientensis, H. adipis, Gonio-
basis filifera, Viviparus nanus, and Cypris sanpetensis.

Abstract of 2 paper announcing the discovery of quite an extensive new fauna
in limestones, apparently of the age of the Birdseye limestone of the New
York series, near the mouth of the Otter Creek, Lake Champlain, which is
of much interest owing to the fact that only about fifteen species of fossils
have hitherto been known from the formation. The new forms described
in the paper from this one bed are fifteen in number, comprising one Brach-
iopod, six Gasteropods, and nine Cephalopods. One of the Gasteropods
has given reasons for the establishment of a new genus Lophospira, with
Murchisonia bicineta Hall, and M. helicteres Salter as the types. Subse-
quent collections made at the same locality give a total of forty recognized
species in a condition suitable for description and illustration, of which
the new ones are shortly to appear in a bulletin of the American Museum
of Natural History.

Coneludes: (1) That the Devonian black shales carry a fauna (B) which re-
appears with slight modification wherever the black shales appear, from
the Genesee shales up through the Portage deposits to the Cleveland shale,
and possibly higher. These deposits run out and disappear at the eastern
extreme of the area. (2) The Portage rocks and their fauna (C) are com-
paratively local, belonging to the central part of the area, the fauna failing
in the more western sections, and both fauna and lithologic characteristics
are unrecognizable east of the Cayuga section. (3) It is evident from the
study of the sections that the interval occupied in the Genesee section by
the typical Portage fauna is represented in the Cayuga section by an en-
tirely different set of species (the several stages of A), while still farther
east in the Chenango and Unadilla section the same interval is filled by a
preliminary stage of the Catskill (F.1). (4) The Ithaca group of the State
reports contains faunas (A., 3,4) which he has defined as stages in the suc-
cessive modifications of the Hamilton fauna. This set of faunas differs from
the Chemung fauna in the absence of several of its common and abundant
species, and by presenting unmistakable evidences of earlier stages in modifi-
cation of species which are near enough alike to be classified under the same
specific name. (5) The series of modified stages of the Hamilton fauna (A.,
1-7) is confined to the sections east of the Canandaigua meridian. The lowest
stage (A, 1) occurs at the extreme east, where the Tuliy limestone and the
black Genesee shale are scarcely to be recognized. The third and fourth stages
do not appear at the extreme east, but only in the Cayuga and Tiaughnioga
sections, their place farther east being occupied by the first stage of the
Catskill. The following stages appear in the more eastern and fail in the
Cayuga sectiou, while the final stage (A.6 and A.7) extends farther west,
and appears after the Chemung species have appeared in the deposits of the
region. (6) The Catskill deposits of Chenango and Otsego Counties are in-
trinsically not distinguishable from the upper stage of the Catskill, but
appear at a lower position stratigraphically in the interval occupied by
the “Ithaca group” of the Cayuga section and by the middle part of the
Portage group of the Genesee section; but palentologically they are im-
mediately preceded by stages of the Hamilton fauna, and are followed by
later stages of the same general fauna. (7) The Chemung fauna appears,
in what I consider its earliest biological stage, in the central sections (D.
and D.1), but the predominant and most characteristic species of the Che-
mung appear stratigraphically earliest in the more western sections (D. 4 of
Girard and Chatauqua). This stage of the fauna appears in the upper part
of the Chemung group of the more eastern sections, and when we reach the
more eastern part of the area (the Chenango and Unadilla sections) this

stage of the fauna is all that appears, and is there represented by a few
specimens in the very upper strata just before the final incursion of the

difficult to conceive why the Lower Helderberg should thin to the west-

be represented by impure limestones, resembling the lowest portion of the
eastern series, while more nearly synchronous with its higher portions. It
would also be natural to expect, in this case, that the fauna of the western
strata would consist of forms migrating from the east, and on this account,
partaking largely of the life characters of the lower eastern deposits, since
such migrations are likely to take place very slowly.

VULCANOLOGY.

In describing the eruption of Etna, May 18 and 19, 1886, O. Silvestri
notes that after the great eruption of August, i874, by which the
mountain was fractured from north-northeast to south-southwest, he
predicted that another eruption would occur on the southern side of the
mountain, where the fracture had not closed. This prediction was ful-
‘filled in May, 1879. Again,in May, 1883, there was a third eruption
from the same opening; and it is still again from the same crevasse
that the lava has issued in 1836. (Compt. Rend., C11, 1222.) The erup-
tion of 1886 was somewhat severe, and at one time ee steno the de-
struction of the village of Nicolosi. H. Silvestri calculates that the

289

290 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

output of lava from all the several openings amounted to from 40 to 60
cubic meters per second, and the rapidity of flow of the stream was from
40 to 60 meters per minute near the source. The stream extended
in all 6.5 kilometers, stopping within 327 meters cf Nicolosi, and the
whole volume of lava emitted was estimated at 66,000,000 cubic meters.
(Compt. Rend., C11, 1589.)

On the morning of June 10, 1886, a remarkable volcanic eruption be-
gan in the lake district of the North Island of New Zealand. By di-
rection of the Government, acting with the utmost promptness, Dr.
James Hector, director of the Geological Survey of New Zealand, at
‘ once began a scientific examination of the phenomena, starting with
assistants for the scene of the outbreak on the afternoon of the same
day on which the eruption commenced. His preliminary report, on
which the writer has mainly relied for the following brief account, is
given in Nature, xxiv, 289. The focus of the disturbance was ascer-
tained to be in a line 7 to 10 miles long, extending in a northeast-south-
west direction from the. north end of the Tarawera Range to Okaro
Lake. The outbreak began at 2.10 a. m. by an eruption from the top
of Wahanga, the north peak, followed in a few minutes by a more vio-
lent one from Ruawahia, the middle peak, and a little later by a third
one from the south end of the range. By the last explosion the mount-
ain was split in two, and Percy Smith found the fissure to be 5 chains
wide and the eastern part to have been blown away and scattered in
débris over the country. (Nature xxxiv, 554.) The earthquake shocks
at this time were not very severe. But about 4 a.m. aviolent outburst
of a different nature occurred, attended by loud reports and widely
felt earth shocks. This was the outburst of an immense volume of
steam, carrying pumice dust and rocks, which proceeded from the site
of Rotomahana Lake, southwest of Tarawera, and formeda thick cloud
in the higher atmosphere, where the vapor condensed to such an extent
that the suspended solid matter fell in the form of mud, overwhelming
the settlement of Wairoa to a depth of 12 inches. The site of this
eruption is a great fissure which seems to commence as a narrow rift at
the northern end from the great rent which has been formed in the
south end of Tarawera Mountain. This rent appears as if a portion
of the mountain, measuring 2,000 by 500 feet and 300 feet deep, had
been blown out, leaving a ragged chasm, from which steam was issuing
when observed. The great fissure cuts across Lake Rotomahana, where
were formerly the famous Pink Terrace and White Terrace, but where
there are now seven powerful geysers, at intervals throwing up water
and mud to a height of 600 to 800 feet, the largest geyser rising from
the position formerly occupied by the Pink Terrace. The rain of mud
which overwhelmed the country is attributed to the condensation of
the heavy vapor and dust cloud under the influence of a cold south-
west wind. When visited steam was still rising from the site of Lake
Rotomahana, forming a cloudy pillar 12,000 feet high. Dr. Hector
| VULCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY. 291

thinks that the eruption ‘“‘was a purely hydrothermal phenomenon,
but on a gigantic scale.” An illustrated popular account of this erup-
tion by C. F. Gordon Cumming may be found in “The Leisure Hour,”
October, 1886.

The changes that have occurred in the Hawaiian volcano of Kilauea
during 1886 areof interest. On theevening of March 6, 1886, the lakes
of liquid lava in this great pit crater were unusually active, but after
midnight of that night the lava suddenly sank away, leaving the site
of Halemaumau a great hole 500 feet deep. No overflow of lava oe-
curred above the sea-level, although several rents were made outside of
the crater. There may have been a submarine discharge (Am. Jour,
Sci., XX1, 397). Soon after this occurrence the crater was visited by J.S.
Emerson, of the Hawaiian Government Survey, who remained there
from March 24 to April 14. During his stay no molten lava was any-
where visible in the entire crater, although there were evidences of heat
beneath the surface. He describes Halemaumau as a pit 600 feet in
diameter and 275 feet deep. He made surveys of the crater and inferred
that the lava which had disappeared had ‘found its way into the great
fissures of 1868, and from the spongy nature of the district had readily
found all the space needed to contain its entire volume without coming
to the surface or entering the sea.” (Am. Jour. Sci. Xxx, 87.) About
three months later L. L. Van Slyke remained at Kilauea from July 19
to 24. At that time the deep pit observed in April was replaced by a
conical hill of loose rocks, some 150 feet high. Molten lava was also
again visible in places, one being at the bottom of ‘‘a deep hole or well, of
rather irregular outline, four-sided, perhaps 30 or 40 feet wide and from
60 to 75 feet long, and not less than 100 feet deep.” (Am. Jour. Sci.,
XXXII, 95.) Again, at the beginning of October, it was visited by F. 8S.
Dodge, who describes the pit of Halemaumau as now occupied by an
irregular pit or lake, surrounded by a range of hills or ridge nearly cir-
cular in form and about 1,000 feet across. There appeared to be fire in
the central pit, although he could not get near enough to actually see
into it. (Am. Jour. Sci., XXXII, 98.)

A voleanic eruption was reported to have occurred in the island of
Nina Fédu, one of the Friendly Islands, beginning August 31, 1886, and
continuing ten days, covering the greater part of the island with stones
and ashes to a depth of 6 to 9 meters, killing the vegetation and de-
stroying all the villages but two, with, however, but little loss of life.
(Humboldt, 1887, p. 116.) It is noticed that the date of this eruption is
the same as that of the Charleston earthquake (Nature, xxv, 127), but
Professor Dana does not regard this as any reason for supposing a con-
nection between the two. He notices the similarity in general direction
of these islands with that of the voleanic line of central New Zealand.
(N. 30° H.), and thinks that this line, 1,500 miles long, ‘‘ may be viewed
as having been, at the beginning and since, the course of a series of
fractures and a line of common genetic action,” which would tend to
Zoe RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

connect the eruption of Nina Féou with that in New Zealand in June,
1886, rather than with the Charleston earthquake. (Am. Jour. Sci.,
XXXII, 311.)

The new volcanic island which appeared in October, 1885, near the
Island of Tonga, is pictured from photograph in Vol. xu, Proc. Royal
Soc., London. The island when visited in November, 1885, was about
2 miles long and 200 feet high.

In connection with the report of Dr. Johnston Lavis to the British As-
sociation (1886) on the volcanic phenomena of Vesuvius, the fourth sheet
of the geological map of Monte Somma and Vesuvius was exhibited at
the meeting. It distinguishes in detail the lava flows of different dates.
The report states that unusual opportunities of studying the subterra-
nean structure of the volcanic region about Naples are just now afforded
by the construction of the sewer from Naples to the GwWif of Gaeta, by
certain borings near the temple of Jupiter Serapis, and by the construe-
tion of the Cumana Railway from Naples to Baiaand Fusaro. (Nature,
XXXIV, 481.)

At the meeting of the London Geolozienl Society February 19, 1886,
Dr. Johnston Lavis received an award from the Barlow-Jameson Fund
‘in recognition of his past labors and in furtherance of future work in
the vicinity of Naples.” (Nature, XXxIII, 503.)

The volcanic phenomena of central Madagascar are described by R.
Baron in Nature (xxxu, 415). The volcanoes described, all now ex-
tinct and none so much as 1,000 feet high, lie in two districts, one fifty
or sixty miles west and the other seventy or eighty miles southwest of
Antananarivo, the capital. Itis stated that scarcely a year passes with-
out one or more slight earthquake shocks in central Madagascar. Ex-
tinct voleanoes and thermal springs are said to exist in other parts of
the island, but little is known of them.

In a paper before the British Association (1886) on the geysers of
New Zealand, BE. W. Bucke gives observations on an extinct geyser, into
the tube of einen he was fet down. He found that this tube, at 13 feet
from the surface, opened into a chamber 15 feet long, 8 feet broad, and
9 feet high, from one end of which chamber another tube led downward
to an unknown depth. His observations also indicate a conn&ction be-
tween the activity of the geysers and the direction of the wind. (Na-
ture, XXXIV, 512.)

In the second part of the ninth volume Transactions of the Seismolo-
gical Society of Japan, Professor John Milne has published an account
of the voleanoes of that country. The account is mainly descriptive
and historical, the material being drawn from a number of Japanese
works, a considerable portion of them being in manuscript. The infor-
mation thus gathered from previous writers is supplemented by ex-
tended personal observations by, the author himself in frequent journeys
made for the purpose during his residence for a dozen years or more in
Japan. Among these personal experiences may be mentioned his visit
VULCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY. 293

to Oshima (p. 78), where he had an opportunity of lookimg down into
the open crater of an active volcano, which was at the time belching
forth masses of molten lava to a height far above the point where he
stood. A map is given on which are marked one hundred and twenty-
nine mountains of volcanic origin, twenty-three being in the Kurile Isl-
ands. Of this number, fifty-one are active, sixteen being in the Kuriles
and eleven in Yezo. Of the whole, thirty-nine are symmetrically formed
cones, Showing a more or less close approximation to the theoretical
outline deduced ivy Milne in the Geological Magazine and by Becker in
the American Journal of Science, IT], xxx, 283-293. From several con-
siderations the author infers that the volcanoes of the Kuriles are of
more recent formation than those of Japan.

Asama Yama is an active volcano about 75 miles northwest of Tokio,
Japan, rising to 8,800 feet above sea-level. The depth of its crater be-
ing estimated by visitors all the way from 2,000 feet down to 500 feet.
Professor Milne, with a party of assistants, attempted to measure this
depth by a sounding line passed through a ring on a rope which was
stretched across the crater. His measures, which were, however, not
entirely successful, indicate the depth to be about 750 feet. (Nature,
XXXV, 152.)

The volcano of Barren Island and the island of Narcondam in the
Bay of Bengal were visited and surveyed by Capt. J. kh. Hobday and F.
R. Mallet, whose observations are published in the Memoirs of the Geo-
logical Survey of India. Barren [sland is circular in shape, with a
diameter of 2 miles. The main crater is elliptical, measuring 14 by 1
mile, with walls varying in height from 1,158 feet on the southeast to
nothing on the northwest. Theinner cone, about half a mile in diameter
at the base, rises 1,015 feet, terminating in a small elliptical crater 300
_ by 190 feet in measurement, from which steam and smoke issued. The
outer slopes of the main crater, if prolonged, would meet above the
apex of the inner cone, from which it is inferred that this outer cone
was once complete, and that its upper part bas been removed by an ex-
plosion similar to that of Krakatoa. (Nature, XxxII, 489.)-

On the authority of Junghuhn it has been believed that within his-
toric times the voleanoes of Java have thrown out only solid matter and
not lava. But observations on recent eruptions there, made by Herr
Fennema, an engineer of Buitenzorg, show that in April, 1885, a stream
of lava appeared on the southeastern side of Smeru which forced the
residents of plantations below to flee, and caused some loss of life
by avalanches of stones started by the stream. At the same time
Lemongan also threw out a lava stream, but of a basaltic character,
while that from Smeru was andesitic. (Nature, Xxxrv, 224.)

Comparing with the eruption from Krakatoa that at the island Ferdi-
nandea in 1851, A. Riccd remarks that at the latter place large quanti-
ties of vapor were projected into the air to a height comparable with that
attributed to the emanations from Krakatoa, but, owing to the fact that
294 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

the eruption took place through the waters of the sea, the amount of
solid matters which reached the upper atmosphere was inconsiderable.
Aud as this eruption was followed by observations of the blue sun and
red after-glows at Palermo, he infers that the dust from Krakatoa could
not have been a prominent factor in the production of the red sun-glows
which attracted so much attention in 1883. (Compt. Rend., c11, i060.)

“ Naturen” also called attention to the relation between red sun-glows
noted in Scandinavia in 1636 and 1783 and eruptions of Skapta Jékul
in Iceland. (Nature, XXXII, 137.)

In the president’s address at the meeting in November, 1885, the
Krakatao Committee of the Royal Society was reported to have their
work in a good state of forwardness, the detailed work having been di-
vided between five subcommittees.

The president’s address in November, 1886, states that by working in
connection with a similar committee from the Royal Meteorological So-
ciety the work is now nearly completed. Consideration of the sea dis-
turbances, begun and carried on by Sir F. Evans, but interrupted by
his death, has been completed by his successor in the office of hydrog-
rapher, Captain Wharton. The report on air disturbance by General
Strachey and on geology by Professor Judd, as also that on sunsets and
atmospheric phenomena, by Hon. Rollo Russell and Professor Archi-
bald, are nearly ready in manuscript, and the completed publication may
no doubt be expected at an early day. (Nature, xxxv, 114.)

The French translation of Verbeek’s work on Krakatoa was completed
in 1886, forming an octavo volume of 567 pages, printed at Batavia, ac-
companied by forty-three maps and plates, and an album of twenty-five
plates, published by the National Institute of Geography in Bruxelles.
It is characterized by Daubrée as “‘ Un document classique dans les
archives des volcans.” (Compt. Rend., cu, 1139.) .

Edmond Cotteau has described Krakatoa and the Straits of Sunda
as seen in the expedition of Breon and Corthals, in 1884, the article be-
ing illustrated with numerous views taken from the album accompany-
ing Verbeck’s volume. (Le Tour du Monde, LI, 113.)

In September, 1885, J. M. Alexander, with J. S. Emerson, visited the
crater of Mokuaweoweo, on Mauna Loa. He notes the curious fact that
this voleano has had frequent eruptions from craters situated on the rim
of the great central pit, so that lava streams have poured down inside
the crater as well as outside. Having determined the position of
over fifty small craters, he finds them apparently situated on a series of
parallel fissures running in a direction 8. 40° to 60° E., although a few
are in lines running N.50° KE. He states that the “ major axis of the
great craters is generally at right angles” to the main trend of the group.
This is certainly true of Kilauea and Mokuaweoweo, of which he says
also that in both the highest walls are on the western side and the action
is working toward the southwest, the most active craters being in each
case in the southwest end of the caldera. (Nature, XXXIV,».232.)
VULCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY. 295

Professor Dana (Am. Jour. Sci., XXXII, 247) calls attention to the way
in which the great erosion of the volcanic peaks in the island of Tahiti
has displayed the inner structure of this mountain and so has made
known what is probably the inner structure of many extinct volcanoes.:
The central mass of the mountain is made up not of bedded lavas, but
of crystalline rock eroded into deep valleys separated by “knife edged”
ridges and showing no horizontal lines but rather indications of vertical
striation. He interprets this as being the solidified mass of lava which
when liquid filled the interior of the voleano, and from which, since it so-
lidified, the crater walls and overlying stratified beds have been washed
away.

The first volume of Joseph Prestwich’s Geology has been published
during the year (Oxford, 1886). Chapter x11 is devoted to volcanoes
and in it he reiterates the views in regard to the agency of water in
eruptions which he upheld in his paper before the Royal Society as no-
ticed in our summary for 1855. Chapter x11 treats of earthquakes.
In regard to the origin of earthquakes, while admitting other more local

_ causes, he says “ I am disposed to share the view expressed by Dana,

that the tension and pressure by which the great oscillations and plica-
tions of the earth’s crust have been produced have not yet wholly ceased
and that this is generally the most probable cause of earthquakes.” A
map on Mereator’s projections shows the geographical distribution of
volcanoes and earthquakes.

SEISMOLOGY.

Much the most interesting occurrence of the year to Americans, and,
indeed, the only earthquake which has attracted any general attention,
was the destructive Charleston earthquake of August 31, 1886. In
extent of area affected and in the magnitude of the destruction which
ensued it surpassed anything that has occurred on the Atlantic coast
since its occupation by Europeans.

The New Madrid earthquake of 1811, in the Mississippi Valley, was
probably more vioient, but, owing to the sparsely populated country,
the material damage was much less. The first premonitions of the ca-
lamity were given by slight shocks felt at Charleston and Summerville
on August 27 and 28, but the destructive shock occurred on the evening
of August 31, within a few seconds of 9.51 p.m. By this shock nearly
the entire city of Charleston was ruined, almost every house being
more or less injured and very many rendered entirely uninhabitable, so
that for many days thereafter a large part of the population lived in
tents and other temporary shelters in the public parks. The shock was
felt throughout the eastern United States, as far as Boston on the
northeast, Toronto on the north, Wisconsin and Iowa to the northwest,
Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana on the west. It wasslightly per-
ceptible in Cuba and the Bermuda Islands, to the south and east. Iso-

Review, August, 1886) and by Everett Hayden (Science), from which,
as well as from the coseismals, the origin or epicentrum appears to have
been in the neighborhood of Charleston, probably somewhat north of
‘that city. The greatest destruction was caused in the city of Charles-
ton, although the direction of the shock appears to have_been more
nearly vertical at Summerville, about 25 miles northwest. At both of
these places, but more particularly at Ten Mile Hill, between them,
many “sand craters” were formed. These were openings in the ground,
from which came out water and sand. They varied in size from little
sand hillocks of an inch or two in diameter to large craters the sand
from which covered a surface of some acres. The water at first spouted
forth, but to no great height, and in most cases soon ceased to flow, al-
though in at least one case it continued for more than three days. Fis-
sures of considerable extent also occurred in other places. The main
shock was followed by others that same night, none, however, of suffi-
cient violence to have done harm except to buildings already weakened
by the first. So in the following weeks shocks repeatedly occurred, at
first daily and later at gradually increasing intervals; and they are
still oceasionally felt at the present writing, March 30, 1887.

Naturally this most unusual phenomenon at once attracted great ai!
tention, and Major Powell, director of the U. 8. Geological Survey, im-
mediately determined to take advantage of it for scientific study, for
which it presented unusual opportunities. Competent persons were
sent to make personal examination of the ground, and, by circular and
otherwise, manuscript and printed reports were collected for future
discussion. The results of this work are not yet published, but are ex-
pected to yield conclusions of the utmost interest and value. Of prelim-
inary publications the following may be mentioned: A report by T. C.
Mendenhall, accompanied by an isoseismal map, inthe United States
Monthly Weather Review; several communications to Science by
Everett Hayden, of the Geological Survey, one accompanied by a map
of isoseismals and coseismals prepared originally for the Wa ashington
Philosophical Society ; an illustrated descriptive article in Science by
W. J. McGee, of the Geological Survey; many newspaper accounts
jn the issues of the daily and weekly press during the month of Sep-
tember.

Dom Pedro, Emperor of Brazil, evinced his interest in scientific mat-
ters by himself sending to the French Academy an account of a moder-
ate earthquake observed by him at his summer home in Petropolis, near
Rio Janeiro, on May 9, 1886. It caused no important damage, but af-
fected an area larger than that of the recent Andalusian earthquake,
and is noteworty as occurring in a region where earthquakes are rare.
(Compt. Rend., cr, 1351.)

The recording of the numerous minor shocks that are continually
occurring still goes on both in Europe and in America, as is shown by
the lists for 1885, which are now to be noted.

VULCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY. 296

The Norwegian savant, Dr. Rausch, makes, in the Norwegian press,,
an appeal for more careful Pane eeaiion and report of earthquakes oc-
curring in that region, with a view to preserving a record of their dura-
tion, extent, ete. (Nature, XXXIIT, 424.)

In his twenty-first annual report (Min. u. petrog. Mitt., vitr, 28) Dr.
C. W. C. Fuchs has collected the statistics of vuleanology and seis-
mology for 1885. The volcanic activity of the year is regarded as un-
important and is dismissed with brief references to the eruption ot Ve-
suvius in May; of Cotopaxi in July, by which one hundred and two
houses were destroyed; and of Smeru (Java) in April, by which a few
lives werelost. His account of the earthquakes of the year includes two
hundred and thirty items, which are distributed in time as follows: Win-
ter, £0 beau 20; January, 40; February, 30); spring, 61 (March,
27; April, 23; May, uh ; summer, 40 (June, 18; July, 10; August, 12); an-
ae 39 (September, 15; October, 14; November, 10). On twenty-six
days earthquakes were reported at two or more places. Of these earth-
quakes the following receive more special mention: The series of shocks
in southern Spain, which were a sequel to the great earthquakes of
December, 1884, and continued to be felt at intervals far into 1885; an
earthquake in Switzerland April 13, which affected an area of 20,000:
square kilometers, and had an estimated intensity at the epigenirany of
vin, Rossi-Forel scale; in Steiermark May 1 and September 22, with
fa well defined; in Gusher May 24, by which 3,081 lives were lost
and 70,000 houses injured ; and in Algeria December 3 to 13, where vil-
lages were destroyed and numerous persons perished in the ruins. The
list contains only seven American earthquakes, the deficiency being no
doubt due to the same cause as noted in reference to the previous re-
port. The one reported under date of January 6 probably should be
January 2, Maryland, and January 3, New Hampshire. In an appendix
he adds seventy Jee items for 1883, nearly every one relating to Ital-
ian stations, and one hundred and twenty-one for 1884, of which many
are Italian and forty-six are American, derived from Rockwood’s lists
for that year. In regard to these latter it must be noted that the geo-
graphical names and details have ‘suffered seriously in the transfer to
a foreign language, so that it is in some cases difficult to recognize for
what they are intended.

Professor Rockwood’s fifteenth Annual Notes on American Earth-
quakes (Am. Jour. Sci., xxx11, 7) gives asummary for the year 1885. It
is almost wholly occupied with North America, containing only five
references to places south of the Isthmus of Panama. It gives 71
items classified in time, as follows: Winter, 24 (December, 8; Jan-
uary, 9; February, 7); spring, 22 (March, 8; April, 11; May, 3); sum-
mer, 14 (June, 3; July, 6; August, 5); autumn, 11 (September, 2; Octo-
ber, 7; November, 2). In geographical distribution they were: Cana-
dian provinces, 8; New England, 5; Atlantic States, 9; Mississippi
Valley, 3; Pacific coast of United States, 34; Alaska, 2;/Mexico, 1;
298 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 91886.

Central America, 2; West Indies, 2; Ecuador, 1; Peru and Chili, 3;
Argentine Republic, 1. As so many shocks occurred in California a
small earthquake map of that State for the year is given, which shows
that the Bay of San Francisco is in a particularly shaky region, that
city having been within the area of five distinct earthquakes during the
year. The author has again assigned an intensity to each earthquake,
using the Rossi-Forel seale in combination with the one previously
proposed by him (Am. Jour, Sei, XX1x, 426), and which, having been
adopted by the U.S. Geological Survey, is coming to be known as the
Americana scale. Those earthquakes estimated as having an intensity
of vi Rossi-Forel or over were—

(vi.).—March 30, Argentine Republic; March 30, April 11, July 23,
California.

(vir.)—February 8, Mexico; July 31, California.

(1x.)—October 11, Nicaragua; December 18, Guatemala.

Forty-three dates are added for 1883 and 1884, all but one being in
the latter year, and mainly taken from Detaille’s lists in L’Astronomie.

M. C. Detaille contributes to L’Astronomie (p. 216) a list of earth-
quakes felt in 1885, being the third article of similar character from him.
It gives 246 items in all, of which 35 are American. The largest
number (49) occurred in January; the smallest (11) in October. For
the other months the numbers areas follows: February, 18; March, 15;
April, 19; May, 14; June, 29; July, 23; August, 13; September, 16;
November, .6; December, 23. Of the American items only six are Con-
tained in Rockwood’s lists, seventeen being from Venezuela and five
from Valparaiso. After commenting on a few special earthquakes of
1885, he adds a list of thirteen earthquakes which occurred in Austra-
lia, Tasmania, and New Zealand from December 1, 1883, to December 1,
1884; notices some recent literature and gives the Rossi-Forel scale
adopted by the Swiss Commission and now in quite general use.

The Croatian Earthquake Commission, by M. RiSpatié, published in
1885 (Verh. K. K. Geol. Reichsanst.) a report on the shocks of 1883. It
enumerates forty-five shocks occurring on thirty-sevendays. The great-
est number of shocks occurred in Agram, where there were in all six-
teen earthquake days. The origin of nearly allis referred to the mount-
ains northeast of Agram (Gaea. XXIT: 58).

Dr. ©. W. C. Fuchs has collected the records of earthquakes from his
various annual reports, arranged them according to countries and pub-
lished the whole under the title “Statistik der Erdbeben, 1865-85 ” in
the ninety-second volume of the Sitzungsberichte of the Vienna Acad-
emy; so that the statistics for any particular locality for the whoie
twenty years are now easily available to the student. It forms another
chapter in the general earthquake cataloguein which Mallet and Perrey
have preceded him. In order that the lists for different countries may
be comparable one with another, Dr. Fuchs has included in his pres-
ent lists only those shocks which were sensible without instruments ;
2

that is, those which correspond to the numbers li to X of the Rossi
Forel scale. The lists occupy about 400 octavo pages and are pre-
ceded by a brief separate notice of the more important shocks.

Prof. J. P. O’Reilly, of Dublin, has followed his catalogue of British
earthquakes (1884) by asimilar catalogue of “ Harthquakes recorded as
having occurred in Europe and adjacent countries.” The British cata-
logue was referred to in the summary for 1884. The present list is
based mainly on those of Mallet, Perrey, and Fuchs, and aims to give
for each of the localities, arranged in alphabetical order, the number of
recorded earthquake shakes, with their dates and condensed indications
of the areaaffected. It forms a quarto volume of 220 pages. Owing to
the difficulty ef making any numerical estimate of intensity, especially
with reference to shocks in past years, of which no sufficient details are
now available, that element has been omitted in preparing this list, and
it represents only the number of recorded earthquakes, the unit adopted
being the “shock.” The earthquake map of Europe, for which this list
is intended to be the basis, has not yet appeared, but will be prepared
in due time.

“Observations on the Volcanic Eruptions and Earthquakes in Ice-
land,” by G. H. Boehmer, has been printed by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion from advance sheets of the Report for 1885. The first nineteen
pages of this pamphlet are translated avd condensed from a history by
Th. Thoroddsen and describe the location of the active volcanoes. It
is stated that ‘‘ volcanic eruptions appear to be confined to two locali-
ties, one in the south of the island, running from southwest to north-
east, and the other in the north, running from south to north.” The
voleanoes which have been active within historic times are classified
geographically. into eight groups, and under these headings they are
described at some length. There follows a chronological and descrip-
tive list of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, beginning with Katla,
about 900 A. D., and coming down to 1879. About twenty localities
are named where eruptions have occurred. Of the large volcanoes
Hecia has the first place with twenty-one eruptions. After it come Katla
with twelve or thirteen, the Eldeyjar, near Reykjanes, with ten, and the
Trolladyngja with six. The earthquakes are in evident connection
with the voleanic activity. The remainder of the pamphlet, about 28
pages, is occupied with a valuable vibliography of the volcanoes, earth-
quakes, and geysers of Iceland, founded on a similar list by Thoroddsen
but much extended by Mr. Boehmer. It names fifty-eight oS Sh
besides the numerous books and articles in journals,

In studying the slight earthquakes of January:5 and 17, 1886,
southern New Hampshire, W. M. Davis prepared ae aay IV, ak
from the data in Rockwood’s lists an outline map showing the areas in
New England affected by earthquakes from 1872 to 1884, from which it
appears that southern New Hampshire is the most frequently disturbed
region. Professor Davis’s detailed study of these shocks also confirms
300 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

what the present writer has long felt, that the newspaper notices on

which so much of our records are based give a very insufficient idea of

the true extent of the area affected, and gives added importance to the |
work undertaken by the Geological Survey looking to the collection of

better records.

In the ninth volume of the Transactions of the Seismological Society
of Japan, Dr. C. G. Knott has a paper on Earthquake Frequency. After
a discussion of the probable length of any periodicity which might be due
to the gravitational action of the sun or moon, with the result that the
periods most likely to be discoverable are semi-annual and annual, he
gives a method of combining the monthly numbers so as to eliminate
any shorter periods; which method he then applies to several earth-
quake lists and finds clear indications both of a winter maximum and
of a semi-annual periodicity. In regard to the latter, however, the
author finds reason to doubt whether it is due to the gravitational cause
which led to the search for it. He finds a possible or probable cause for
the winter earthquake maximum (which his annual curves show to exist
in both northern and southern regions), in the accumulations of snow
over continental areas and in the annual change of barometric gradients.

Ch. V. Zenger, in searching for a possible relation between the cos-
mic streains of shooting stars and seismic phenomena, finds the follow-
ing results (Compt. Rend., ci, 1288): (1) The days of the passage of
the streams and of the solar perturbations coincide with the days
of seismic movement during the years 1883, 1884, and 1885, and with
volcanic eruptions. (2) When there isa considerable difference between
the days of passage of the meteoric stream and the period of the solar
perturbations, two groups of seismic movements are observed. (3)
These movements are often accompanied by tempests, electric storms,
and aurora borealis.

Ina paper by Prof. J.S. Newberry, reprinted from the School of Mines
Quarterly, he advocates the theory of a fluid or viscous interior and a
comparatively thin and flexible earth-crust, and that earthquakes are
the vibrations attending the folding and breaking of rocks which have
been in a state of strain through its gradual contraction. He regards
it as quite possible that the provoking cause in any particular case may
lie in some comparatively trifling increase of atmospheric pressure or
in the transfer of the products of erosion from the land to the bottom
of the adjacent sea-basin.

M. Stanislas Meunier renews his theory of earthquakes (stated in
1883), by which he attributes the seismic activity to the effect .of
water contained in the rocks and suddenly brought under the influence
of the internal heat of the earth, the means of its transfer to the super-
heated region being the sudden fall of masses of rock already saturated.
He finds confirmatory evidence in the numerous shocks characterizing
the recent earthquakes in Chios and in Spain. (Compt. Rend., c11, 934.)

M. Ch. Lallemand presented to the French Academy a suggestion of
ee oe

VULCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY. 301

the origin of earthquakes in relation with the theory of the tetrahe-
dral form of the earth proposed by Mr. Lowthian Green (Vestiges of
the Molten Globe, 1875). According to this theory the four vertices of
the terrestrial tetrahedral form are, respectively, in the Austral conti-
nent, the Himalayas in Asia, the Alps in Europe, and the Rocky Moun-
tains in America, the several faces being occupied by the Indian, the
Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Arctic Oceans, and the consequent areas
of greatest deformation or lines of fracture should be the theaters of
volcanic and seismic action, which indeed seems to be in accord with
the physical facts (Compt. Rend., ci, 715). This tetrahedral theory of

' the earth’s form was also dicussed before the Academy by M. H. Faye

at its next meeting (Compt. Rend., c11, 786). He showed that reasons
for rejecting this theory were abnndant, drawn from the unsymmetrical
position assigned to the tetrahedral vertices and from the evident spher-
ical form of the moon and planets. The details of his discussion be-
long rather to physical geography than seismology.

The promised monograph by Dr. Johnston Lavis on the earthquakes
of Ischia has appeared during 1886, but as the writer has not yet seen
it, nor any review of it, further notice of it must be reserved.

An important memoir by T. Taramelli and G. Mercalli on the Anda-
lusian earthquakes of 1884 (Atti R. Accad. d. Lincei, 1886) has also come
to the knowledge of the writer too late to receive more than mention.

In the fifth edition of the Admiralty Manual of Scientific Inquiry,
the article on earthquakes, originally prepared by Robert Mallet, is to
be revised by Prof. Thomas Gray, now of Glasgow and formerly in
Japan. (Nature, xxxtiI, 135.)

An account of “ Kanthquakes and earth movements,” intended for
the non-scientific reader, has been published in the International Scien-
tific Series. It was prepared by Professor Milne, of Japan, who has had
such a prominent part with Ewing, Gray, and others in the recent ad-
vances in seismology. It forms a book of 360 pages, divided into
twenty chapters. It gives an excellent popular account of the subject,
especially the part devoted to seismometry, in which are described a
variety of instruments, from the simple columns of Mallet and the mer-
cury cup of Cacciatore, to the modern seismographs of Ewing, Gray,
and Milne. The character of the earthquake motion is discussed both
theoretically and experimentally, with reference to Mallet’s and Abbott’s
investigations, as well as to the experimental work done by the author
and others in Japan. The effects on buildings are described and rules
for building are inferred. In regard to the determination of the cen-
trum and epicentrum several methods are given, dependent on the
direction of the motion, on the direction of the cracks in buildings, and

_ on time observations. For the latter case he treats mathematically (1)

the method of straight lines, (2) the method of circles, (3) the method

& of hyperbolas, and (4) the method of co-ordinates; as also the methods

and time is illustrated, the former by a map based upon that of Mallet,
and the latter by reference to the results of Mallet, Perrey, Schmidt,
Fuchs, and others. In discussing the causes of earthquakes the usual
theories of steam, vulcanism, chemical action, cosmic influence, are
stated, the only conclusion being that the cause is endogenous to our
earth, and that solar and lunar influences and barometric fluctuations
have small effect. The last 40 pages are devoted to earth tremors,
which escape notice by reason of their small amplitude; earth pulsa-
tions, which are overlooked on account of the slowness of their period;
and earth oscillations, by which are meant such slow changes of level
as are illustrated by the well-known temple of Jupiter Serapis. Inre- °
gard to the earth tremors reference is made to the observations of d’Ab-
badie at Hendaye, of G. and H. Darwin at Cambridge, of Bertelli and
Rossi in Italy, and of the authorin Japan. The book is written in a
popular style and, while dated 1886, appears to have been completed at
least two years earlier, as it does not refer to the most recent work in
this department, even that of Milne himself.

At the second annual conference of delegates of the “‘ corresponding
societies” enrolled in connection with the British Association, Professor
Lebour stated that the North of England Mining and Mechanical En-
gineers had a committee actively engaged on the connection of earth
tremors and mine explosions, and that they were desirous of organizing
concerted observations on earth tremors by the corresponding societies.
(Nature, xxxv, 80.)

In the re-modelling of the Imperial University of Tokio, with which
the Imperial College of Engineering is now united, a chair of Seismol- *
ogy has been founded, and filled by the appointment of Mr. Seikei
Sekiya, who has already become known by his previous work in that
science. Japan is thus the first country to recognize the importance
of this department of science by assigning to it a separate professor in
its university. (Nature, xxxIv, 130.)

The French Academy appointed MM. Daubrée, Fouqué, Hébert,
Gaudry, and des Cloizeaux as the Commission of Award for the Vail-
lant prize, the subject for which was ‘“‘to study the influence which
the geology of a country, the action of water, or other physical causes
might have upon earthquakes.” (Compt. Rend., cil, 541.) The prize
was awarded to the members of the French Commission on the An-
dalusian Earthquake of December, 1884 (MM. Michel Levy, Bertrand,
Barrons, Offret, Kilian and Bergeron), whose reports were referred to
in the summary for 1885. They also awarded in the same connection
an “encouragement” of 1,000 francs to M. de Montessus, who had
passed four years (1881-1885) in San Salvador, and while there had
made a careful study of seismism in its relations to other physical and
cosmic phenomena. (Compt. Rend., cr, 1355, 1358.)

In 1885 the East Indian Section of the Dutch Royal Institution of
Engineers published some prize questions. one of which related to the
VULCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY. 303

theoretical methods and calculations employed in making deductions
from earthquake observations. For this Prof. John Milne received the
first prize of 150 guilders and a diploma. He also received honorable
mention for an essay on the application of theoretical seismology to the
art of house-building. (Nature xxxty, 154.)

The Japanese Transactions of the Seismological Society of Japan
have reached Vol. 111, which contains papers on ‘“Harth Tremors,”
by Milne; on the “ Harthquake of October 15, 1884,” by Sekiya; and on
‘Air Waves and Sea Waves,” by Wada. The English Transactions of
this active society have completed Vol. 1x, the contents of which are
referred to in their appropriate places in this summary.

SEISMOMETRY.

Early in the year Professor Milne read before the Seismological So-
ciety a paper on a Seismic survey made in Tokio in 188485. Itis a
fuller account of experiments briefly described in his ‘Fifth Report”
to the British association, 1885. A number of similar seismographs
were installed at different points on the grounds of the Imperial Col-
lege of Engineering, one being at the bottom of a pit 10 feet deep, and
another in a house supported on cast-iron balls. The instruments were
connected and simultaneously put in operation by electricity. During
the year of observation fifty earthquakes occurred, whose automatic
records were studied. A map of the grounds is given and copies of
some of the record diagrams. In general the results differed very
sensibly at the various stations, the motion being usually greatest on
the low grounds. The greatest amplitude marked at any station was
2.5 millimeters, while the same earthquake at another station gave
only 0.05 millimeter. The greatest ‘maximum velocity” recorded is 19
millimeters per second. The greatest acceleration was 300 millimeters,
or about 1 foot per second. In the house resting on shot the least mo-
tion was found when the shot used were small, about a quarter of an
inch in diameter.

Experiments have been made with delicate instruments by MM.
Fouqué and Levy on the velocity of propagation of vibrations in the
soil, the vibrations being produced by dynamite and by the blow of a
pile-driver. Some of their conclusions are of interest. (1) The vibra-
tions caused by charges of dynamite or powder (up to 12 kilograms of
dynamite) are, at the same distance, more feeble than those produced
by a hammer of 100 tons falling from a height of 5 meters. (2) When
the point of disturbance and the basin of mercury are both at the sur-
face the vibrations are multiplied, showing several maxima and minima,
and at a distance of 1,200 meters lasted 10 seconds. On the contrary,
when the origin of the disturbance is below the surface, as in a mine, a
single blow gives rise to a single shock of short duration, even when
observed at a great distance; and the result is the same whether the mer-
cury basin be in the mine or on the surface. (Compt. Rend., crt, 1290.)
304 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

In a letter to Nature, under date February 28, 1886, Professor Sekiya
gives a specimen of the earthquake records which are now issued from
the University of Tokio. Regular observations are there made by the
Meteorological Bureau by means of the horizontal pendulum and verti-
cal motion seismographs of Milne, Gray, and Ewing, which produce
continuous diagrams on a revolving glass plate or drum. The Meteoro-
logical Bureau has also carried out a set of observations for the deter-
mination of the area shaken in each earthquake, by means of reports
gathered from over six hundred local offices throughout the Empire.
The results are confirmatory of those reached by Milne in previous
similar study. The total number of earthquakes in Japan in 1885 was
four hundred and eighty-two, equivalent to 1.3 shakings per day. Of
these two hundred and thirty-five were local, not affecting an area of
more than 100 square miles. The maximum areaof any oneearthquake
was 34,700 square miles. The intention to continue similar observa-
tions is announced. (Nature, XXxXIII, 603.)

The Cambridge Scientific Instrament Company is now prepared to
manufacture seismographic instruments after the designs of Prof. J. A.
Ewing, of Dundee, formerly of Japan. The instruments are described
by Ewing, with illustrations, in Nature, xXxxIv, 342, and consist essen-
tially of a pair of bracket seismographs for horizontal motions and a
vertical motion instrument, all recording on a glass plate revolving
by clock-work. The cost of this apparatus complete is £57 5s. The
bracket seismographs with recording apparatus alone cost £40. The
duplex pendulum seismograph, recording on a fixed plate and com-
plete in itself, costs £14. These instruments are essentially similar to
those described by Ewing in his memoir on Earthquake Measurement.

James White, of Glasgow, also advertises the Milne and Gray seismo-
graph, improved from that figured in Milne’s “ Earthquakes,”-page 39,
and made under Mr. Gray’s personal supervision, for £55. It records
both horizontal and vertical motions on a revolving drum, by means of
two conical pendulum seismographs for the horizontal components and
a compensated spring seismograph for vertical motions.

The U. 8. Geological Survey has been experimenting on cheap forms
of seismoscopes, which could be provided in considerable numbers and
distributed to competent observers in the interest of its seismological
work. Final results are not yet public, but good progress has been
made toward an instrument which should meet the necessary conditions
of reliability and cheapness.

Professor Ewing’s instruments are in use at, or have been ordered by,
the University, Tokio; the Meteorological Observatory, Tokio ; the Geo-
graphical Bureau, Manila; the Ben Nevis Observatory ; and the Lick
Observatory, California. M. Cruls is also desirous of setting up seis-
mographic instruments in the new building about to be erected for the
Rio Observatory, Brazil. (Nature, xxxIv, 604.)

GEOGRAPHY AND EXPLORATION IN 1886.

By WILLIAM LIBBEY, JR.,

Professor of Physical Geography, College of New Jersey.

There appear to be few great regions left for the valiant explorers
of modern times except those lying at the poles. A great deal still re-
mains to be done in the way of working up the details that are needed
to fill in the outlines of our globe’s structure, which are now pretty well
known. This is very clearly seen when we contrast the two species of
activity at work in the study of Europe and Africa; the former might
almost be said to be known so well as to preclude all further investiga-
tion, and this is true with regard to its general features, but we find
more written about its details in every way, than of any other conti-
nent. In the case of Africa this sort of minute study has only begun,
but the long lines traversed by so many intrepid men are rapidly
producing a net-work which will give us a true idea of this enormous
portion of our globe, concerning which it has been well said that it isa
dark, mysterious, and sealed continent.

Europe has been properly retired from-the list of the continents
which are subjects for exploration, but the exploration of its resources
and enterprises are in the first full flush of development; in other
words, the history of man’s modifying effect on nature has but fairly
begun to be written.

Asia and Africa have received most attention during the past year,
though there is no lack of expeditions of note in all the quarters of the
globe.*

Asia.—The greatest explorations which have been carried on in this
continent during the past year have been those of General Prjevalski,
who returned to Moscow in January, 1886, after his fourth journey into
the interior. This is but one of a series of trips undertaken by him,
commencing in 1871, and he was at that time the first explorer to pene-
trate these unknown regions, all other attempts having been repelled

*TI have been aided very materially in the preparation of these notes by the excel-
_ lent sketches of the progress of geography which have been published by Maunoir,
Duveyrier & Kaltbrunner; not only in the verification of facts already known, but
also for many records, which their greater facilities have enabled them to give.

by the fierce native tribes. A simple outline, giving the regions visited
in these several journeys, may not be amiss in this place.

The first voyage extended from 187173, during which time he visited
and made known for the first time the sources of the Blue River, the
Yang-tse-kiang. In his second trip he travelled through the Thian
Shan region as far as the Tarim, and then he was forced to return
throngh eastern Turkestan. This took place in 1876~’77. In 1878~79,
he explored the region about Lake Zaisan and reached Tsaidam in
Thibet; then going forward, he was stopped within 160 miles of Sadji.
He then turned his attention to the headwaters of the Hoang-ho. In
his fourth journey, begun in 1883, he again crossed these central desert
regions to the source of the Hoang: ho, spending the month of February,
1884, in the mountains of Thibet. In May he again passed through
Tsaidam, where he left his stores in charge of the Cossacks. The
river in this region has only a breadth of about 150 feet, which however
soon increases rapidly. The Chinese have a great veneration for the
Hoang-ho, which is justified by its importance to the region through
which it flows. Wild animals, yaks, ete., arethe only living things
found near its source, but in its lower course, when the plainsare reached,
it becomes thickly settled. From these headwaters he turned farther
southward to the source of the Yang-tse-kiang. Here he again en-
countered many difficulties, chief among which were the natives; they
were generally poorly armed and easily repulsed, but he was exposed
to their sudden attacks for several months.

Crossing from southern to western Tsaidam he found desert land
once more, and he was glad to reach a small town called Gas, even
though he was forced to take the most impracticable routes. Here
he remained three months, and then passed on to western Thibet, where
he discovered three new mountain ranges. On his return to Gas he
passed through these mountains once more, going to Loto on his way.
In this place he was received kindly by the inhabitants, who seem to be
of Turkish origin. He received the same treatment from the natives of
western China and eastern Turkestan.

This part of the country is described in the most favorable terms. It
seems to havea warm and agreeable climate, to be very fertile, and winter
is scarcely known. All the surrounding nations are represented here—
Chinese, Mongolians, Arabians, and Hindoos. Going farther, another
desert region was crossed, which was dotted here and there with oases;
that of Tchertchen was found to contain the remains of an ancient and
forgotten village; the Oasis of Potam is described as very fertile, and
he is the first explorer who has followed and described the course of
the River Potam. This river arises in a marsh in the midst of the desert,
and has a length of about 120 miles; after following it he passed
across the River Tarim and then went to the oasis of Akson. From
this spot he crossed the Thian Shan mountains to Sekoul, where his
journey ended.
GEOGRAPHY AND EXPLORATION. 315

Potanine and Skassi spent the greater part of the year in making
ethnographic and topographic studies near Sinin and around Lake
Koko nor, on the border lands between China proper and Thibet.

In southern Arabia we have had most interesting results from the
voyage of Glaser. He crossed from Hodeida, on the Red Sea, to Sana,
a voyage not so noted for its length as for the difficulties encountered.
He has only been preceded by three Europeans (Niebuhr, 1763; Armand,
1845; and Halevy, 1870). This is one of the most famous portions of
southern Arabia in ancient times.

Professor Euting, of Strasburg, has also published this year an ac-
count of the journey (made in 1883-84) from Damascus to Nefond and
from there to Mecca by a hitherto untraversed route.

A good map of central Syria has been published by Dr. Diener, which
embodies the results of his studies around Damascus, Baalbec, south-
ern Lebanon, and Palmyra.

The great cartographer H. Kiepert has been travelling ren Asia
Minor with the object of completing his map of that portion of the con-
tinent by the aid of original investigations and the unpublished docu-
ments to be found at Constantinople. As yet, however, nothing has
been published.

Dr. Elisseiew has started on a journey across Asior Minor to Armenia
and Kourdistan by way of Alexandretta and Aleppo.

The party, composed of Potanine, Skassi, and Beresovski, which has
explored a considerable part of southern Mongolia and northwestern
China, continued their work in the spring, and started on their return
across the desert of Gobi by a route lying between Sogok-Nor and the
eastern ramifications of the Altai Mountains.

There has been another expedition in Thibet which deserves men-
tion. The English explorer Carey has passed through western Thibet.
From Leh, in Cashmir, be went to Khotan, then, following the course
of the Tarim, he reached Lob Nor towards the end of April, and pro-
posed to return by the north of China.

Another expedition, which was known as the Macaulay mission, has
been ordered back because of the opposition of the Chinese Govern-
ment. It was to have gone to Lhassa, crossing Sikkim and Japela
Pass.

Upper Assam has been visited by Colquhoun, but no reports have
been received from him concerning the region lying between Birmah
and Assam. The border line of British India has been very carefully
and energetically mapped by the English topographers, who were sent
there for the purpose.

In the French possessions of Indo-China, the investigations of Rey-
eillere and Fresigny have demonstrated that the rapids, heretofore con-
sidered insurmountable difficulties, can be passed by small steamers, as
they went as high as Khong, on the Mekong river. The boundary com-
mission have been at work in the North, near Laokai, where they have

nearly finished their work on the border between Yun-nan and Tong.
king. They have been much interrupted by the piratical attacks of the
natives.

Capus, Bonvalot, and Pepin have continued their travels in the trans-
Caspian district and Turkestan. They always hoped to be able to cross
the Afghan boundary, but have been unable to do so. After reaching
the sacred city of Meshed, this season they decided to go at any risk,
and started for Balkh. They were captured, safely returned to the bor-
der, and left on the other side in a very emphatic but respectful man-
ner. They have explored the regions about Merv and Samarkand and
have followed the course of the Amu-Daria.

The Russian Government sent out a party under Dr. Radde to ex-
amine into the resources of the new trans-Caspian territory. They
were detained at Askabad by a tardy spring. They profited by the de-
lay to explore the mountains on the Russo-Persian frontier. At Merv
he was joined by Koutchine. From this point they went along the Mur-
ghab to the frontier of Afghanistan, and then followed the boundary to
Saraklis and then to Askabad, studying the five parallel mountain
chains on the border of the new Russian provinces.

Mr. and Mme. Dieulafoy are still continuing their researches in
Persia, Chaldea, and Susiania, and although their work is mainly
archeological, it contains much of interest to the geographer. At this
time the interest centers in the description of their return trip from
Susa to Bassorah.

Persia has also been crossed by Captain Gore of the Afghanistan
boundary commission. He was accompanied by a party of native to-
pographers, and starting from the Oxus he traveled through Herat,
Burjum, and then across the desert of Luth‘to Kerman; here the latest
news was received from him, and his objective point was Bunder Abbas
at the mouth of the Persian Gulf.

The Russian Government sent an expedition this year into eastern
Pamir to study the botany of the region. It was the expedition of
Grum-Grzymailo, and failed to reach the higher portions of the Pamir
on account of bad weather.

The English government of India represented by Lord Dufferin sent
Ney to Kashgar and Yarkand in 1885. The explorations of Ney in
Central Asia have already made him famous. In this instance he

profited by the occasion to cross that portion of the Pamir which has —

been considered inaccessible heretofore, and reached the headwaters
of the Amu Daria. He then explored the regions of Roshan and Shigh-
nan, which had only been visited by the pundits previously. After this
he passed through Badakshan, and then reaching the English boundary
commission in Afghanistan, went to Ladak, where he has resided for
some time.

The Hindoo Koosh range was also crossed by Colonel Lockhart. Near |

the southern sources of the Amu Daria he passed through Badakshan,

after which he regained his starting point at Gilgit after having made
topographical studies of some importance.

Africa.—The continent of Africa is becoming better known every
year, but at the cost of many lives; in fact it is hard to tell whether
the polar regions oppose more difficnities to overcome in exploration
than these equatorial regions or not. Both parts of the globe have
great natural obstacles to be overcome, but those found near the equa-
tor are intensified by the stubbornness, jealousy, and tricky dispositions _
of the natives. Thus each year a new list of victims to their barbarity
has to be prepared, but this does not seem to prevent men risking their
lives in the exploration of the dark continent.

Robecchi of Cairo has started across the Libyan desert from the Nile
to Tripoli. The latest news from him was to the effect that he had
reached the Oasis of Siwah safely.

‘Italy seems to be studying the eastern portion of Africa very care-
fully just at present; at least there are a large number of Italian voy-
agers in Shoa and Abyssinia this year. It is said that the object of
their trip, commercial or political enterprises, forces them to remain
quiet concerning all they observe, and therefore they have not published
much. The names of some of these explorers are Antonelli, Martini,
Piana, Ragazzi, Salembeni, Traversi, etc. Other travellers who have
had secret missions have been able to impart valuable information to
geographers without committing any indiscretions, as, for example,
Captain Longbois, who has given a very attractive description of his
voyage to Shoa where he visited King Menelik, and it is hoped that
our Italian friends will soon follow his example.

Another very fatal portion of Africa is the extreme eastern part near
the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The list of those who have lost their
lives in this region is quite long already, and this year we must add the
massacre of the Italian expedition under Porro at Harar, also of that
under Barral at Shoa, the death of Paul Sollellet, the French explorer,
at Aden, as the result of the hardships of his trip to Kaffa and Shoa,
and then the complete destruction of the.crew of a French man-of- war
in the Gulfof Tajurrah. In spite of all this the Italian voyager Franzoi
will make an attempt to reach Kaffa and the great lakes by the way of
Zanzibar, and is fitting out an expedition to make his proposed trip.

When the insurrection in Egypt under the Mahdi broke out Dr.
Schnitzler (Emin Bey) was governor of the equatorial provinces, in
the service of the Khedive, and was stationed at Lado. He was not
only noted for his activity as an officer, but also as an explorer. This
man, and those who supported him, were thus penned up, and fora long
time no news came trom them, for communication in the direction of
Egypt was thus cut off. At the same time the state of affairs to the
south and east was hardly less favorable. Between the Soudan and
the Indian Ocean we find the kingdom of Ouganda, ruled over at pres-
ent by Mwanga, a very unworthy successor to Mtesa, who always aided
318 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 18386.

the white men who passed through his realm. This iatter tyrant how-
ever has either intercepted all the messages or killed the messengers
sent to Emin Bey. He ordered the massacre of the caravan of the
unfortunate English Bishop Harrington, to the eastof Victoria Nyanza,
near Kavirando, and seems determined that no one shall approach his
state or pass throughit. Dr. Fischer was prevented from going around
Victoria Nyanza to aid the party of Emin Bey and they were not al-
lowed to escape from the Soudan. The Khedive and the English au-
thorities have ignored these indications of blind hatred, or they would
not have turned this governor over to himself and left him to become
the victim of their political mistakes. Fortunately Emin Bey did not
lose his head in this serious state of things, but immediately joined
forces with Dr. Junker, who has been exploring this region since 1879,
and Captain Casati, who has been travelling along the Uelle,—the two
other Europeans who were in the country. Their position at Lado was
at first untenable and they retreated to the south with a handful of
devoted men; since then reports have been received stating that Emin
Bey made an aggressive move and had regained Lado. Dr. Junker then
forced his way to the coast with messages from Emin Bey, in spite of the
obstacles placed in his way by Mwanga, although at first he seemed to
have been made a captive in Ounyoro. This distingushed explorer
must have made many valuable observations during his long stay which
will be very useful in completing our maps of this district. Expeditions
are being fitted out for the relief of Emin Bey and Casati. The whole
district about Lakes Bangweolo and Moero has been most thoroughly
exhausted by the expeditions of Boelhme, Reichard, and Giraud.

A new and easy route to the head of Lake Nyassa has been found
by Pfeil, who has been traveling along the Ulanga, which is a large
tributary of the Lufiji. Revoil left Zanzibar for Lake Tanganyika last
year and only succeeded in reaching Tabora, about two-thirds of the
distance to the lake.

The only important expedition between the coast and Lake Nyassa
was that of Serpa Pinto and Cardoso, who were able to found the
station of Blantyre, on the Shire, after several attempts.

Dr. Fischer, in spite of all his efforts to reach Dr. Junker, only suc-
ceeded in reaching Victoria Nyanza, and was unable to traverse
Uganda or go around the lake, and there is no doubt but that the trials
of this trip helped to bring about the premature death of this intrepid
traveler at the age of thirty-eight. He died suddenly on his return to
Berlin, November 11, 1886. There are some other prisoners in this
Nyanza region who do not dare to move from Uganda without per-
mission from the king, viz, the two missionaries, Mackey and Lomdel.
The expedition under Livinhae is also detained at the south of the
lake, waiting more favorable conditions to advance to the north.

A very rapid trip across the continent from Stanley Falls to Zanzi-
bar was made by Gleerup. He was materially aided by Tipu-tip, a

powerful chief, and passed through Nyangwe, then Ujiji, on Lake
Tanganyika, then Bagamoyo, and reached Zanzibar in five months,
making too quick a journey to add much to our geographicai knowl-
edge of the regions crossed.

Dr. Lenz, the famous explorer, who was sent to the aid of Dr. Junker,
was detained at Stanley Falls by circumstances beyond his control
until April, 1886, when he left for Nyangwe and Tanganyika. In
the mean time Dr. Junker virtually became a captive, and the lot of
Dr. Lenz has become a source of inquietude because he is doubtless
completely in the power of Arabs hostile to Europeans. Dr. Lenz
was accompanied by Dr. Baumann and Bohndorff, the faithful com-
panion of Dr. Junker. He seems to have given up the possibility of.
reaching the valley of the Uelle through that of the Mobangi (the
connection only existing on some fancifully constructed maps). At
first he intended traveling up the Aruwimi, but later news from the
captives, which led him to believe that they were on the eastern side
of Albert Nyanza, determined him to give the preference to the Mbura
route.

The best and clearest résumé of the work of all investigators of the
affluents of the Congo has been given in Petermann’s Mitteilungen, 1836,
Ix and XI, by v. Francois. It embodies the work of Grenfell, Kund,
Tappenbeck, Wissmann, Wolf, and himself, among others. The year has
been rather poor in results as far as the basin of the main river Congo
has been concerned. Many travelers have passed up the river as far as
Stanley Falls, among them Lenz, Bove, v. Schwerin, etc., but nothing
new has been pointed out. In January, 1886, Kund and Tappenbeck
found that the [kata enters the Kassai just before this latter river enters
the Congo. There is still considerable doubt concerning the lower
course of the Kwango, one of the main southern branches of the Congo,
and it is to be regretted that the travels of Massari and Buttner do not
throw any new light on the subject, because their itineraries agree and
disagree in the most peculiar manner.

Lieutenants Kund and Tappenbeck have traveled over portions of the
Kwango, Kassai, and Sankuru. They found two new tributaries of the
Kwango, viz, the Wambu and the Saie, which latter empties into the
Kuilu before it joins the Kwango. None of their guides would follow
them beyond the Kassai, and on reaching the Sankuru with boats and
travelling along it they turned eastward through prairies and dense
forests. On their return they discovered a new and important river,
the Ikatta, which reaches the Congo under the name of Mfini. This
latter river Stanley believes is the outlet of Lake Leopold II.

Lieutenant Wissmann has descended the Kassai, and the result has
been the complete revolutionizing of our previous ideas of its course. —
He has gone still further eastward to Lake Lanji, the great basin from
which the Congo flows and into which the great rivers, the Lualova,
the Luapula, and the Lufira, empty.
320 _ RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

In this connection it might be well to mention the fact that Grenfell
and v. Francois have been travelling up the various tributaries, one
after another, as far as their little vessel could go, and have been re-
naming them all.

The Kingdom of Muata Yamvo, so well described by Pogge, has been
recently visited by de Carvalho on a political mission from Portugal, in
which he is said to have been successful.

After a while we may get some definite idea of the limits of the re-
gions of this continent, concerning which almost all the various nations
of Europe have been contending. The International Boundary Com-
-mission have been having a difficult time locating the artificial limits
of these so-called states, which are sometimes marked by problematical
rivers. The members of the French Commissivn, Rouvier and Ballay,
and those of the Congo Free State, ascended the Congo, trying to find
the mouth of the Licona, which was to be the boundary according to
the terms of the Berlin treaty. They reached the Bunga without find-
ing the Licona, and here the delegates of the two states signed a de-
claration which states “that the Licona of the maps and of the treaty
is nothing more than the Bunga.”

French Congo has been explored by J. De Brazza, who passed down
the Sekoli from a point near its source, for some distance, and then
traveled to the north and eastward. They intended going down the
river to its juncture with the Congo on their return, but the natives
would not supply them with canoes. They made boats for themselves,
and after a month’s hard work reached the junction of the Sekoli and
Ambili. Later along they reached the Congo, and then made their way
back to the coast from Bunga station by way of the Alima and Ogowe.

In South Africa the only expedition now in the field is that of Dr.
Holub. There have been many explorations in previous years which
we are just commencing to hear from; for example, that of Capello and
lvens, which extended from coast to coast; that of Montague Kerr from
Cape Colony to the Zambesi and Lake Nyassa; that of Schulze to Lake
Ngami, and more recently that of Farini across the Kalahari Desert to
Lake Ngaini. A rather energetic and carefully-planned expedition to the
Lower Niger and the Sokoto was made by Thomson last year. They
steamed up these rivers as far as they could go, with their caravan al-
ready mounted, on board the vessel which carried them, and, when they
could go no further, landed and were off before the natives knew what
was going on or could recover from the surprise. Their object was to
conclude treaties with the sultans of Hansa. Their promptness prob-
ably saved their lives, but all their papers and baggage were lost. The
lower portion of the Niger is held by the English nation, who control all
the commerce of this region from their station at the juiction of the
Niger and the Benue. A German station has been founded at Bakundi
by Flegel, the explorer of the Torraba. The upper part of the river has
been carefully explored by Davoust, for, although previously studied by
GECGRAPHY AND EXPLORATION. Fa yAe &

Caillé and Park, it was but partially known. For a long time Lake
Liba has had a location and a name on the maps, but they have served
as a sort of ignis fatuus, for it defies all attempts to reach it, if it exists,
and this seems more problematical than ever in spite of the efforts of
Rogozinski and Parsavant, who announced their intention of visiting it.

The northwest coast of Africa, never very hospitable, has been keep-
ing up its reputation during the past year. The attempt of the Ger-
man Commercial Geographical Society at Berlin to establish a station
at Cape Nun came very near ending fatally to all concerned. The
party were left on the shore, and after wandering in the most wretched
condition from one tribe to the next, they were at last escorted to the
coast at Mogador. There have been several expeditions across Mo-
rocco, and some from Alveria, and many errors and defects have been
corrected in our maps. Many of the routes between the leading towns
of this district have been shown to be practicable, but our map is far
from complete. The work of Maurel, de la Martiniére, Duveyrier,
Foucault, and Quedenteldt has been important for this reason, that
their travels have made us better acquainted with a region of the globe
which, though it is quite near Europe, has been virtually sealed to the
white man by the fanaticism and ferocity of the natives: Thus the
slopes of the Atlas Range, which are not so very distant from the coast,
are almost an unknown region.

We have received what is probably an exaggerated account of Adrar
from the Spanish expedition under Cervera which started from Rio di
Ouro. They reached their destination nearly in a dying condition after
many hardships and after being robbed of nearly everything, and conse-
quently their picture of the region hardly agrees with that of Vincent
and Panet, who describe it as a most delightful place, comparing it
with the most favored portions of Switzerland.

Timbuetu is again exciting attention, and expeditions have started
from north and south to reach this city. Among these might be men-
tioned the party under Gallieni and Viard along the upper course of
the Niger. They were only forced to return by lack of water at Djenne.
The party under Dr. Krause promises interesting results, because they
travelled through regions as yet unexplored. We have to chronicle
here the assassination of Palat, who left Algeria for this point and was
treacherously murdered on the road.

The Cameroon region has been more carefully studied and explored
since it has come under the German protectorate. Dr. Schwarz, Pauli,
Langhaus, Zoller, Valdau, and Knutson have been the main explorers
of the slopes of the mountains, while the many streams which enter the
Atlantic from this range have been examined by the Government
authorities. Schwarz, Valdau, and Knutson passed beyond the mount-
ains, and describe the region visited as a fertile and pleasant one, and
not a desert as was supposed. The mountains are described as pecul-
jiarly beautiful, with peaks reaching 12,000 and 13,000 feet,

More was expected from the trip of de Oca, Osorio, and Tradier in their
trip to the Corisco coast, to the south of this region. They visited
probably the most glorious portion of this western coast between the
Campo and Mouni Rivers, but their descriptions are disappointing.

North America.—The only portions of North America which seem
to be left for great geographical discoveries are Alaska and the central
and western portions of British America. The work of the Coast Sur-
vey and the Geological Survey is rapidly giving us the detail of most
of our vast western territory. Alaska alone seems comparatively neg-
lected, except along the coast-line, on account of its peculiar position.
The expedition sent out under Lieutenant Schwatka by the New York
Times to the Mount Saint Elias Alps, visited that part of Alaska which
is nearest the United States but which is least known, having been seen
but once by the Coast Survey, in 1874, and then under disadvantages.
The party succeeded in crossing the large glaciers which come from the
great are of mountains (of which Mount Saint Elias is the center) and
which pass between the range and the coast. They ascended the lower
slopes of one of the adjacent poutine, but did not reach the main
slopes of the mountain.

On this same southern shore of the body of Alaska, Lieutenant Allen
completed his explorations of the Copper River and the Tananah, the
largest-branch of the Yukon. Lieutenant Stoney has explored the west-
ern coast of Alaska between the Kowak River and Point Barrow, after
wintering at Fort Cosmos, on Kowak River, which he discovered in 1883.

In central British America, Hudson’s Bay has attracted most atten-
tion, on account of the proposed scheme of making Hudson’s Straits
the outlet for all the great grain districts to the south and west of the
bay. Lieutenant Gordon has found that the straits are always open
from July to October, which fact seems to encourage the promoters of the
pian to compete in this way with our transcontinental railways. The
whole affair appears to be very visionary, but may be carried out after all.

Our knowledge of Central America has been somewhat increased by
the archeological voyages of Pinart to Chiriqui and of Charnay to Yu-
catan. We have also the details of the Nicaragua route between the
two oceans.

South America.—This is a continent which still merits explorations,
and those of the present year have been quite successful in disclosing
many new features, though some of the expeditions have of course suf-
fered. Beginning at the north, we find the expedition of Dr. Siewers
in Venezuela is completed this year by a trip to the Sierra Nevadas of
Santa Marta. He has now spent some three years in Venezuela, and
all have been profitable.

Theexplorations of Tenkatein the Guianas have been resumed this year.
He reached the State of Bolivar, on the Orinoco, then went to Cumana,
the peninsula of Araya, and after this to LaGuayra and Caracas. Here
he suffered from fever to such an extent that he had to stop work,
GEOGRAPHY AND EXPLORATION. 323

A new scientific expedition has been in Venezuela this year, under
the leadership of Chaffanjon, already well known by his explorations.
The object of the expedition was to reach the headwaters of the Orinoco.
After a stay in Bolivar, he set out with his companions, Morisot and
four men engaged as rowers, but his men deserted him during the night,
carrying off the canoe and some provisions. They secured a new crew
of two men, at a high price, and worked themselves, in order to continue
the trip. The floods had driven all game from the river banks, and
they were thus deprived of meat in the way of food which hunting
would have given them. For several days they were forced to live upon
roots. They reached Caicara, the point where the Apure joins the Ori-
noco, and stopped there, overcome by hunger and fatigue. The swollen
current of the river, greatly increased by the heavy rains, prevented
their proceeding farther.

The South American continent has been crossed from east to west
by two Europeans during the present year. Olivier (French consul to
Callao) was the first to accomplish this feat. Starting from Callao he
crossed the Andes and descended the main streams to the Atlantic
coast, whereas Payer ascended the Amazon (Maranon-Ueayali), and then
crossed the Peruvian Andes. He has prepared a map of many of the
smaller tributaries which he explored. Both voyages have been the
means of adding considerably to our knowledge of the geographical and
hydrographic features of the central portion of South America.

A commission has been appointed by Brazil, Paraguay. and the Ar-
gentine Republic to explore that portion of the Argentine Republic
which projects in between Paraguay and the Brazilian province of Rio
Grande do Sul, with the object of determining the respective frontiers.
Two preliminary voyages have been made here by Nederlein and Godio.
Very little is known of this province, which has been called the Mis-
sion Territory because of the missions founded there by the Jesuits
with the idea of civilizing the Indians.

Thouar is still actively engaged upon his explorations in the Argen-
tine Republicand Bolivia. He had scarcely returned from his voyage
on the Pilecomayo when he started out from Buenos Ayres to meet the
Bolivian ambassadors at Tarija in order to consult as to the best way
of opening the navigation of the Pilcomayo. It was his intention at
first to go by the way of the Gran Chaco region once more, with some
natives, but after careful consideration he decided to take the less dan-
gerous route through Tucuman, Salta, and Jujuy. He was retarded by
the rains and when he reached Tarija he did not find theambassadors,
as he expected, and he found that Bolivia was not in a condition to
prove there was a practicable fluviatile route to the heart of their coun-
try, by tracing the course of the Pilcomayo to the Paraguay. The
hardships endured on this trip were remarkable. They were deserted by
their men, and they often lost their way in the mountain labyrinths.
Their burdens were heavy, and it is scarcely any wonder that the fatigue
324 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

of the trip under such conditions brought on fever which forced them
to stop and rest.

The Argentine Republic has undertaken to explore the region between
the Pilecomayo and the Vermejo, and has sent-out an expedition under
de Brettes, accompanied by Boisviers and Robin with an escort of
twenty men. Viscount de Brettes has been in this region before, and
therefore we may expect thorough work from his party.

Chili is at present engaged in the official exploration of the territory
ceded by Peru after the war. The desert of Atacama is also being
studied, and an expedition has been sent to Tierra del Fuego to examine
the gold-bearing strata said to have been recently discovered there.

A real voyage of discovery has been made in Patagonia this year by
Colonel Fontana, the governor of the Cbhupat Territory. His brilliant
expedition to the eastern slopes of the Andes is to be followed by a
minute exploration of the regions which he could only cross at a very
rapid rate. All that is known of the beautiful valleys which lie at the
foot of the Andes, beyond the desolate and arid Pampas, rests upon the
descriptions of native hunters, because, with the single exception of the
hasty visit of an English marine by the name of Musters, in 1869, no
one has ever visited this region. The reality seems not only to answer
the description, but to surpass all our conceptions of its possibilities.
These valleys are said to be picturesque, fertile, and well watered. and
form a complete contrast with the monotonous Pampas which must be
crossed to reach them.

One expedition to Tierra del Fuego has been already noted. The
Argentine Republic, which owns the other half of this region, has also
sent out a mining expedition to exploit the recently discovered gold.

The distinguished geographer Lista is also travelling in Tierra del
Fuego, and much that is valuable concerning this wild land can be ex-
pected from his report.

Australia and Oceania.—Lindsay, who explored the Arnheim penin-
sula in 1883, has crossed the Australian continent. He travelled from
southern Australia toward Lake Eyre in order to study the course of
the Finke River. He finds that in the rainy season it empties into the
Treuer or Macumba River, which is the main northern tributary of Lake
Eyre, but in the dry season it loses itself in the sand. From this point
he went eastward, to the Herbert River, which led him to the north,
and he studied this river carefully, passing from it to the Arthur
River, which carried him to the Gulf of Carpentaria, thus making his
trip from the south to the north, across the continent, complete. New
Guinea seems to have treated all explorers badly this year, the expedi-
tion of Forbes not even excepted. This party, fitted ont with the great-
est care for scientific work, intended to cross the Owen-Staniey mount-
ains and explore the regions beyond. They were delayed in reaching
the base of operations, and when they got there the season was so far
advanced that the trip was given up for the time being, and the party

—_——
GEOGRAPHY AND EXPLORATION. 325

remained at Sogere, waiting for a favorable opportunity. Their means
became exhausted, but not wishing to leave the island without at least
seeing that part of it he came to explore, Forbes, accompanied by a Mr.
Chambers, undértook a trip to the top of the Owen Mountains, but
they were deserted by their guides, and were forced to regain the coast
with all speed. They have returned to Australia in the hope of finding
aid to enable them to undertake the trip once more.

Dallmann and v. Schlenitz have ascended the Empress Augusta-
River some 190 miles from its mouth.

The German expedition under Dr. Schrader has limited its explora-
tions to the neighborhood of Port Finch, the capital of their colony of
Kaiser Wilhelm’s Land.

Polar Regions.—Lieutenants Ryder and Block have charge of the
Danish expedition to Greenland. They expect to visit the coast from
Upernavik to Melville Bay and are accompanied by the geologist Us-
sing. Captain Hovgaard has started out toreach 77° north latitude on
the east coast at the same time, and the ‘“ Fylla” expedition has been
examining the coast from the extreme southern point to Upernavik the
last inhabited point to the northward.

Iceland has been crossed twice this year. Dr. Labonne has traversed
the island from south to north in the central portion. On his way he
ascended Mount Hecla, to which he assigns an elevation of 5,227 feet
above the sea. Thoroddsen has been continuing the geological studies
already begun in the northwestern portion of the island, and has reached
Cape North.

There is a plan on foot for an expedition to Nova Zembla, the main
object of which will be the measurement of the attractive force of the
earth, but geographical explorations will also form part of their work.
This effort is being made by Colonel Chamhorst.

The Liakof of Islands and the five islands of the New Siberia group
have been visited by Bunge and v. Toll, who crossed the ice which.
unites these islands with the continent on sleds.

But one of the many expeditions planned to reach the North Pole has
actually started. Colonel Gilder left Winnipeg for Hudson Bay with
the idea of reaching the eastern coast of Baffin’s Land from this place
and then take a whaler if possible to Cape Sabine and winter there,
after which he intended to start directly north for the pole. Colonel
Gilder has returned to Winnipeg, having been unable to cross Hudson
Bay on account of the lateness of the season. This expedition was sent.
out by the New York Herald.

A very interesting expedition is being organized for the exploration
of the regions, somewhat neglected up to the present time, which lie
around the South Pole. The impulse in this direction was given by the
Australian Societies, and appears to have found an echo in England
where active steps are being taken to secure the funds necessary «for
such an exploration.
PHYSICS IN 1886.

By GrorGE F. BARKER, M. D.

Professor of Physics in the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.

GENERAL.

The address of Professor Rowland upon “The Physical Laboratory
in Modern Education,” delivered at the tenth anniversary of the Johns
Hopkins University, is an important contribution to the discussion now
in progress as to the value of scientific methods in education. His
ideal man has “full respect for the opinions of those around him, and
yet with such discrimination that he sees a chance of error in all, and
most of all in himself. He has a longing for the truth, and is willing
to test himself, to test others, and to test nature, until he finds it. He
has the courage of his opinions when thus carefully formed, and is then,
but not till then, willing to stand before the world and proclaim what he
considers the truth. Like Galileo and Copernicus, he inaugurates a
new era in science, or, like Luther, in the religious belief of mankind.
He neither shrinks within himself at the thought of having an opinion
of his own, nor yet believes it to be the only one worth considering in
the world; he is neither crushed with intellectual humility, nor yet
exalted with intellectual pride; he sees that the problems of nature and
society can be solved, and yet he knows that this can only come about
by the combined intellect of the world acting through ages of time,
and that he, though his intellect were that of Newton, can, at best, do
very little towards it. Knowing this, he seeks all the aids in his power
to ascertain the truth; and if he, through either ambition or love of
truth, wishes to impress his opinions on the world, he first takes care
to have them correct. Above all, he is willing to abstain from having
opinions on subjects of which he knows nothing.” To form such a mind,
says Professor Rowland, is the province of modern education. ‘So far
as I can see,” he states, ‘“‘ the unscientific mind differs from the scien-
tific in this, that it is willing to accept and make statements of which it’
has no clear conception to begin with, and of whose truth it is not as-
sured. It is an irresponsible state of mind, without clearness of con-
ception, where the connection between the thought and the object is of
the vaguest description. Itis the state of mind where opinions are

327
328 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

given and accepted without ever being subjected to rigid tests, and it
may have some connection with that state of mind where everything
has a personal aspect and we are guided by feelings rather than by
reason.” In attempting to correct these faults, it is necessary that we
bring the mind in direct contact with some standard of absolute truth,
and let it be convinced of its errors againand again. “ Let the student
be brought face to face with nature; let him exercise his reason with
respect to the simplest physical phenomenon, and then in the laboratory
put his opinions to the test; theresult is invariably humility, for he
finds that nature has laws which must be discovered by labor and toil,
and not by wild flights of the imagination and scintillations of so-called
genius.” ‘To train the powers of observation and classification, let
students study natural history not only froin books, but from prepared
specimens or directly from nature; to give care in experiment and con-
vince them that nature forgives no error, let them enter the chemical
laboratory ; to train them in exact and logical powers of reasoning, let
them study mathematics; but to combine all this training in one and
exhibit to their minds the most perfect and systematic method of dis-
covering the exact laws‘of nature, let them study physics and astron-
omy, where observation, common sense, and mathematics go hand in
hand.” Much of our modern education fails because it trains only the
memory, using the reason and judgment merely to refer matters to some
authority who is considered final. Worse than all, students are not
trained constantly in applying their knowledge. ‘To produce men of
action, they must be trained in action. If the languages be studied,
they must be made to translate from one Janguage to the other until
they have perfect facility in the process. If mathematics be studied,
they must work problems, more problems, and problems again, until
they have the use of what they know. Jf they study the sciences, they
must enter the laboratory and stand face to face with nature; they must
learn to test.their knowledge constantly, and thus see for themselves
the sad results of vague speculation ; they must learn by direct experi-
ment that there is sucha thing in the world as truth, and that their own
mind is most liable to error; they must try experiment after experi-
ment, and work problem after problem, until they become men of action
and not of theory.” ‘This, then, is the use of the laboratory in general
education—to train the mind in right modes of thought by constantly
bringing it in contact with absolute truth, and to give it a pleasant and
profitable exercise which will call all its powers of reason and of imagi-
nation into play.” ‘The special physicist trained there, must be taught
to cultivate his science for its own sake. He must go forth into the
world with enthusiasm for it, and try to draw others into an apprecia-
tion of it, doing his part to convince the world that the study of nature
is one of the most noble of pursuits, that there are other things worthy
of the attention of mankind beside the pursuit of wealth.” (Science
June, 1886, vil, 573.)
PHYSICS. 329

Joukowsky has made an elaborate mathematical investigation of the
laws of motion of a solid body having hollows filled up with .a homo-
geneous liquid. Various shapes of cavities were considered, as well as
the case where there was vortex motion of the liquid, with interior fric-
tion. Some of the phenomena resulting from the interior motion of the
liquid itself, in the case of the solid body, when caused to rotate, were
verified experimentally and thus proved to accord with theory. These
experiments showed that in a body whose rotation velocity decreases
from the surface to the center (as, for example, a glass sphere filled with
water while being put into motion) the molecules flow from the poles to
the equator; while, on the other hand, when the rotation is suddenly
stopped the speed decreases from the center to the circumference and
the flow is from the equator to the poles. The general conclusion of the
inguiry is that if we have a hollow body filled with a liquid, and if this
system be put in motion, its motion will tend toward a limit determined
by one of the principal axes of inertia of the body, taking the direction
of the principal moment of the communicated motion, and the whole
system will rotate about this axis as asingle body, the speed of rotation
being constant and equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the force
applied by the moment of inertia of the system with regard to this axis.
The author thinks that this result may explain the fact that the planets,
notwithstanding the variety of their primary velocities, all rotate around
their axes of inertia. (Nature, February, 1886, xxx1u, 349.)

Von Helmholtz has given to the Physical Society of Berlin a sketch
of the “ doctrine of the maximum economy of action,” in connection with
his own investigations in this direction. This. doctrine was first pro-
pounded by Maupertius in 1744 in a treatise laid before the French
Academy. This treatise, however, contained no general statement of
the proposition, nor did it define the limits of its applicability, but only
adduced anexample. But this example in the present state of our knowl-
edge is seen not to have been pertinent and not to have any relation to
the principle of the actio minima. Two years later, Maupertius pro.
pounded his principle before the Berlin Academy, proclaimed it to be
@ universal law of nature and the first scientific proof of theexistence
of God. But on this occasion, too, he did not prove the proposition nor
determine the limits of its applicability, but supported it by two ex-
amples, one only of which was correct. This principle, propounded with
such grand solemnity, but so weakly supported, was violently attacked
by Konig, of Leipzig, and defended just as keenly by Euler. This mathe-
matician likewise failed to furnish the proof, which was not possible
until after the investigations of Lagrange. The form in which the
principle of the actio minima now exists was given to it by Hamilton,
and the Hamiltonian principle for ponderable bodies is in complete
harmony with the propositions of Lagrange. The elder Neumann,
Clausius, Maxwell, and Von Helmholtz himself had already extended
the Hamiltonian principle to electrodynamics. For this purpose, and
330 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 18386.

in order to be able to subordinate it to all reversible processes, the
speaker had undertaken some transformations of it, and had introduced
into it the conception of the ** kinetic potential.” In the form it has
thus attained, the Hamiltonian law—the old principle of the actio
minima—has in point of fact universal validity. It has just as wide an
application as has the law of the conservation of energy and reveals a
whole series of mutual relations between the different physical proc-
esses. (Nature, July, 1886, Xxxtv, 308.)

Becker has propounded a theorem of maximum dissipativity, as fol-
lows: In all moving systems theress a constant tendency to motions
of shorter period. And moreover if there is a sufficient difference be-
tween the periods compared, this tendency is always a maximum, so
that all natural phenomena occur in such a way as to convert the
greatest possible quantity of the energy of sensible motion into heat, or
the greatest possible quantity of heat into light, etc., in a given time,
provided that the interval of time considered exceeds a certain frac-
tion of the period of the most rapidly moving particles of the system.
From this it follows immediately that the higher forms of energy can be
produced from the lower, or motions of longer period from those of
shorter period, only on condition that the sum of the transformations of
the system is equivalent to a degradation; a result nearly ideutical
with one of the chief deductions from the second law of thermodynamies.
(Am. J. Sci., February, 1886, III, xxx1, 115.)

Tait has undertaken a mathematical investigation upon the partition
of energy between two systems of colliding spheres, because since 1860,
when Clerk Maxwell published his first grand investigation on the sub-
ject, it seems to have been taken for granted than in a mixture of great
numbers of colliding spherical particles of two kinds, the ultimate state
would be one in which the average energy of translation is the same
for a sphere of either kind. (Nature, January, 1886, xxx11, 270.)

Exner has employed a new method for calculating the size of mole-
cules. The Kinetic theory of gases gives the diameter of a molecule
as a fraction of the mean length of free path and of the ratio of the
space actually occupied by the material particles to their apparent
volume. Clausius has obtained this latter value in terms of the dielec-
tric constant; and since this is equal to the square of the refractive
index, in terms also of this index. Hence, knowing the mean length of
free path of the molecules of any gas (determined from diffusion or in-
terior friction) and its index of refraction, the actual diameter of the
molecules may be calculated. Exner’s figures are as follows, expressed
in centimeters. They should all be multiplied by 10%: Air 10, CO, 18,
CO 13, H, 10, CH, 12, C, Hy 21, NH; 16, H, O19, N 17, NO 16, O, 16,
H, S 22, HCe 18, SO, 17, Ce. 19, and C, N, 19. Toe this table the
author has added the relative atomic volumes and relative specific
weights of certain substances. By the latter is to be understood the
weight in grams of one cubic centimeter filled with the molecules on

the supposition that there are no vacant spaces between them. (Anz.
Ak. Wien, 1885~87; J. Phys., May, 1886, II, v, 240.)

Mach and Wenzel have studied the mechanism of explosions with a
view to explain their action inrupturing the solid bodies on which they
are placed, even when the explosive is unconfined. ‘The experiments
were made with silver fulminate. The authors show, in the first place,
that a visiting card is perforated quite as readily by the explosion of a
small quantity of the fulminate placed upon it when the experiment is
performed in vacuo as when it is made in the air, thus proving that the
presence of air is not necessary to-the result. In the next place they
established the fact that the velocity of propagation of the explosive
wave is very great by placing a few grains of the fulminate in the mid-
dle of a ‘train of powder upon a sheet of paper. After ignition the
direction in which the combustion was propagated through the powder
could be clearly recognized, but the position of each mass of fulminate
was marked by a circle with divergent striw, equally distinct and well
marked in all directions. Hence the combustion of the fulminate had
not occupied an appreciable time. To measure this velocity of the com-
bustion in the case of the fulminate, the authors laid two parallel trains
of fulminate upon a strip of paper and fired them at opposite ends
simultaneously by the spark of a Leyden jar. Above these trains was
a plate of smoked glass, upon which after the explosion an oblique in- .
terference band could be seen, making with the trains themselves an
anglea. Ife be the velocity of sound (supposed with these wreat ampli-
tudes to be not less than 400 meters), then sin a = < from which 4,
the velocity desired, can be calculated. This the authors found to be
_ between 1,700 and 2,000 meters per second. In further proof of the
extremely brief duration of the explosion, a ballistic pendulum was at-
tached at its top to a horizontal rod, upon the end of each arm of which
was acard. On firing a small discharge of fulminate upon one of these
the card itself was perforated, but. no impulse whatever was given to. -
the pendulum, the velocity of propagation of the explosive wave being
too great to communicate any motion to the mass in the time the com-
bustion occupied. If however the cards be replaced by brass cups the
metal is not perforated, but the pendulum receives a strong impulse.
If it be assumed that in this case the amount of motion corresponding
to the lower half of the wave has been communicated to the pendulum,
this amount can be calculated from the impulse given to the pendulum,
and so an approximate value of the velocity of this wave obtained; but
the value thus calculated is too great. Hence it seems probable that
the wave is reflected by the metal without diminution of strength. In
this case the amount of motion communicated to the pendulum is twice
that of the half wave, and the calculated velocity on this supposition is
reduced to one half or to 1,750 meters per second. (Wied. Ann., 1885,
XXVI, 628; J. Phys., November, 1886, II, v, 477.)
332 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Wolf has presented a paper to the French Academy on the authentie-
ity and exact value of the Peruvian unit of length preserved in the
Paris Observatory. Since the French legal meter is defined as a
determined fraction of this standard unit taken at the temperature
of 13° Réaumur, the importance of ascertaining its exact value and its
state of preservation is obvious. Moreover, as the same standard was
used for the measurement of an are of the meridian in Peru, it forms
the connecting link between the older and the more recent geodetic
operations. For these reasons, this meter has become an object of the
highest interest, not only for France but also for the whole scientific
world. The author replies in detail to the doubts and objections raised
by Peters and others in Germany against its authenticity and state of
preservation; and at his request a committee was appointed by the
academy consisting of Faye, Mouchez, Janssen, F. Perrier and Wolf, to
consider the whole question. (Nature, March, 1886, xxx, 503).

A paper on the normal meter has been presented to the Berlin Phys-
ical Society by Pernet. After a brief historical introduction, the paper
discusses the events which in 1878 led to a new international agreement,
in consequence of which a new normal meter of platinum-iridium of x
form was prepared and compared. with the meter of the archives. The
paper describes minutely the arrangements of the Bureau in which the
comparisons were undertaken, the contrivances for securing the sev-
eral comparing rooms against outward disturbances, the means adopted

for insuring constant temperatures, and the methods employed in.the —

comparisons as also in the determinations of the expansion-coefficients
of the rodsused. His own especiai labors had for their object the com-
parison of a series of normal meter rods of different metals with the
meter of the archives and the determination whether repeated heatings
and coolings between 50° and 0° C., whether concussions, and whether
time caused any perceptible changes in the lengths of the rods. As the
result of these investigations it was found (1) that the compared national
standards, together with their divisions, were exact up to one-thou-
sandth of a millimeter; (2) that, with the exception of steel (which on
account of its changes in hardness, readily yielded modifications of
volume and length in the rods made of this material), all the metals out
of which the standards were made—namely, platinum-iridium, platinum
and brass—furnished material suitable for normal meter rods; and (3)
that repeated heatings and concussions induced no changes passing be-
yond the limits within which observation fails. (Nature, May, 1886,
XXXIV, 22.

The ninth report of the Comité International des Poids et Mesures has
beenissued. During the year 1885, new instruments have been obtained
at a cost of about $2,500, for the accurate comparison of standards of the

a a,

metric system. These include a comparator for length measurements —
made by Brunner; mercurial thermometers, by Tonnelot; an air ther- ‘

mometer, by Golaz; a spherometer, by Brunner, and other measuring

instruments by Oerthing, Boudin, Alvergniat, Simmon, and the Société
Genevoise. During the year: the director bas verified the leugths and.
expansion-coefficients of several standard meters, and has determined the
weights and specific gravities of several standard kilograms for different
governments and scientific authorities. The results of the comparison.
of the new kilogram prototype with the old kilogram des Archives are
given and also a report on the verification at Paris of certain British
standards. (Nature, May, 1886, xxxrv, 79.)

Mayer has described a modified form of spherometer, which he calls
the well-spherometer, which*is especially adapted to measure the
radii of curvature of lenses of very small linear aperture. The novel
feature of the apparatus is the well, a cylindrical aperture into which
the screw of the spherometer passes. Placing a piece of. flat glass
against the lower opeuing of the well (which is for this purpose screwed
into a flat plate resting on three feet), a reading of the instrument is
made. Replacing the flat glass by the lens to be measured, which ob-
viously must not be smaller than the aperture of the well, a second
reading is taken. Then, knowing the radius of the well, an easy calcu-
lation gives the radius of curvature of the, lens. Several very ingeni-
ous modifications of the apparatus. are also described in the paper.
(Am. J. Sci., July, 1886, TT, xxxm, 61.)

In a memoir to the French Academy, Germain has given the results
of very accurate determinations of both the astronomical and the geo-
detic co-ordinates at Nice, St. Raphael, Toulon, and Marseilles, made
for the purpose of studying the deviation from the vertical produced
by the action of topographic relief of the surface. It follows from these
four determinations that on the south coast of France the continent
attracts the vertical, that is to say, it repels the astronomical zenith rel-
ative to the geodetic zenith. The effect is the same as if the attraction
was exerted by a point situated to the northward of Nice, in the mass
of the Alps.—(C. R., May, 1886, cr, 1160.)

Deprez has suggested the employment of electricity for recording the
oscillations of a pendulum. To the pendulum is attached a screen fur-

—nished witha slit. The light from a petroleum lamp, passiny through
_ this slit at each oscillation, falls on a linear thermopile and generates an

electric current. This may be used to move the needle of a galvanom-
eter, which acts as a relay and brings in an auxiliary current to oper-
ate a suitable recording instrument. (C. R., June, 1886, C11, 1523.)

A paper on the dynamics ot bicycling was read before the Dublin
University Experimental Science Association by Gerald Stoney. In
conjunction with his father, G. Johnstone Stoney, he had made exper-

iments to determine the energy necessary to propel a bicyele. They

found that when the velocity was 9 miles an hour, it required about

5,500 foot pounds per minute, and that it often rose higher than 10,000

foot-pounds per minute, the highest the apparatus was capable of re-

cording. . Their results on the power which a man can exert were higher
334 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

than those of other experimenters. This shows that the bicycle or tri-
cycle is probably the most economical way of using human muscles.
The experiments were made by attaching an indicator diagram appa-
ratus to the lever of the safety bicycle known as the “ Extraordinary,”
and also by observing the reduction in speed due to fric'ion when the
bicycle was running free. The experiments also showed that the resist-
ance varied almost as the velocity, and that the pressure on the pedal
was not constant, but was a maximum at the center of the stroke.
(Nature, March, 1886, xx x11, 455.)

Curie has contrived a transmission dynamometer having an optical
measuring device. Anarbor,supported horizontally upon two bearings,
carries a pulley at each end, one of which receives the power and the
other transmits it to the machine. The power transmitted is deter-
mined from the torison of the arbor. This arbor is a metallic tube whose
ends are closed by two plates of quartz cut parallel to the optic axis, ©
and each giving a difference of half a wave length between the ordi-
nary and extraordinary rays. A beam of polarized monochromatic light
traverses the arbor along its axis, the plane of polarization being ro-
tated through a definite and invariable angle by the quartz plates. If,
however, any torsion of the tube is produced, the plane of polarization is _
rotated through twice the torsion angle. By a preliminary experiment,
the couple of torsion necessary to produce a rotation of 1° is determined.
Calling this c, and the angle of rotation of the arbor a, the power
transmitted per second will be represented by 2, 7, ¢, a, n, in which
n designates the number of revolutions per second. (C.R., July, 1886,
cit, 45.)

MECHANICS.
1. Of solids.

Nipher has published a paper on the isodynamic surfaces of the com-
pound pendulum. Asis well kuown, certain particles in the system
constituting such a pendulum tend to inerease its acceleration, while
others tend to diminish it. These two groups of particles are sepa-
rated by a surface, such that no particle lying in it has any tendency at
a given instant to change the acceleration of the system. It is in this
surface that the axis of oscillation always lies. On either side of this
neutral surface there must exist surfaces of equal tendency—isodynamic
surfaces—those on the one side having a plus sign and those on the
other a minus sign. Investigation shows these isodynamic lines for a
disk pendulam to be coneentric circles, their common center being on
a horizontal line through the axis of suspension and at a distance from
it, depending on the length of the pendulum (i. e., the distance between
the axes of suspension and oscillation, respectively), and on the angle
of displacement, being half the length of the pendulum when it is
horizontal and intinite when it is vertical. These circles are the right

any compound pendulum. (Am. J. Sci., January, 1886, [1], xxx, 22.)

In determining density by means of the balance, it is desirable to
know to how many decimal places the division should be carried when
the error of weighing is the nth part of a gram. Lermantoff has in-
vestigated this question. Differentiating the ordinary expression for
the density D = iy we have dD = o—P .
certain fraction of a gram in the determination of the weight of a body
produces in the density obtained an error equal to the same fraction of
unity divided by the number of cubic centimeters occupied by the body ;
and (2) the influence of an equal error in the determination of the
weight of water displaced 1s D times greater than that above given
and of contrary sign. (J. Soc. Phys. Chim. Russe, 1885, xvi, 56; J.
Phys., February 1886, I, v. 91.)

Parize has peed thie following method of determining the density
of porous friable bodies, such as earth, peat, and the like. A jar of
250 cubic centimeters capacity is exactly filled with a smooth, regular
seed, such as linseed, for example, and is then weighed. The peat or
other porous material is placed in the jar and shaken down to its normal
condition, and the jar is again weighed. Knowing the weight of water
required to fill the jar, all the data necessary to calculate the density
are obtained. (J. Phys., May, 1886, II, v, 222.)

Kirchhoff has calculated the change of form which an iron sphere
would undergo under the influence of a constant magnetic force.
Calling » the number of turns of wire in the magnetizing spiral and 7
the current in ampéres which traverses it, he finds for the elongation of
the radius of the sphere parallel to the axis of the spiral the value
n?.2.32.1042.R. The contraction in a direction perpendicular to
this axis is between one-fifth and one-sixth of this. (Wied. Ann., 1885,
XXIV, 52; xxv, 601; J. Phys., 1886; April, II, v, 175, 179.)

Koch has published an account of experiments on the elasticity of
ice, made by him in Labrador in 1882-83, and in Fribourg in 1884.
The co-efficient was determined from the flexure of bars of ice when
supported at the ends and weighted in the middle. The principal diffi-
_ culties encountered arose, first, from the direct evaporation which took
place, and which changed the dimensions of the bars; second, from the
plasticity of the ice, which produced a permanent and progressive set ;
and third, from the existence of a considerabie residual elasticity. A1-
lowing for these perturbing causes, the author obtained for the mean
value of the elasticity co-efficient, for ice cut parallel to the free surface
of solidification, the value 641.5, expressed in kilograms per square
mnillimeter; a value considerably higher than that obtained by Reusch
by the acoustic method, which was ouly 236.3. Koch, however, obtained
a still higher value by the acoustic method, namely, 884 kilograms

Hence (1) an error of a

per square millimeter. (Wied. Ann., 1885, xxv, 438; J. Phys., Novem-
ber, 1886, LI, v, 484.) .

Schneebels: has experimentally verified the conclusions of Herz con-
cerning the impact of elastic bodies. The duration of the contact of
two spheres 70™ in diameter was determined by the impulse given to
a galvauometer needle by a current which passed between the spheres
while they were in contact. Provided the total resistance of the cir-
cuit is large and the coefficient of self-induction small, the time may be
considered proportional to the deviation of the needle. With velocities
varying from 156™™ to 1,032™™ the deviations observed varied from 59.0
to 39.5, the product of the deviation and the fifth root of the velocity be-
ing sensibly constant. With spheres of different diameters and the same
velocity the ratio of the diameter to the deviation was found to be con-
stant. In order to determine the absolute duration of the contact, the
author compared the impulse produced by the impact with that given
by a pendulum sliding on a steel band during 0.00082 second, and thus
obtained 0.000185 second. He has verified also the formula of Herz,
which gives the radius of the surface of flattening in terms of the radius
of the sphere. The spheres were covered with paraffin and the radius
of the circle produced by the impact was measured micrometrically.
For a velocity of 259™™ the radius observed was 0.66™"; that calcu-
lated being 0.65. For a velocity of 515"" the radii were 0.83 and 0.85,
respectively. For 1,042™™, 1.10 and 1.12™~, and for 1,535™" velocity,
1.3land 1.27". In the case of the higher velocities, these results are
interesting, since the pressure obtained surpasses that ordinarily as-
sumed as the limit of the elasticity of the steel. (Arch. Sci. Phys. Nat.,
Geneve, 1885, xiv, 435; J. Phys., June, 1886, IL, v, 291.)

Tomlinson has communicated to the London Physical Society the
results of a long series of experiments on the torsional elasticity and
the internal friction of metals, in the course of which he had noticed
several sources of error incident to torsional experiments. In the earlier
experiments a horizontal brass bar was suspended by a wire and oscil-
lated, the time of vibration being observed by means of a lamp, scale,
and mirror. Its moment of inertia was varied by sliding two brass
cylinders, suspended from the bar by fine wires, backward or forward
along it. Under certain conditions it was observed that the bar exe-
cuted a few vibrations of gradually decreasing amplitude, came to rest
and then commenced to swing again, the amplitude increasing to a
maximum, then decreasing, and so on. This effect was finally traced
to an approach to synchronism between the time of oscillation of the
bar and that of the small cylinders about their axes of suspension, the
absorption of energy being due to these being set in vibration. On
clamping the cylinders rigidly to the bar the phenomenon disappeared.
Subsequently something of the same kind appeared which turned out
on investigation to be due to an approach to synchronism between
the torsional and the pendulous vibration periods, Of course this could

a i

not occur if it were practically possible to have the axis of the wire
pass accurately through the center of mass of the vibrator. Another
error arises from the fact that in a wire recently suspended the tor-
sional vibration period is always slightly greater than when the
wire has been Jong used and frequently oscillated (Phil. Mag., Novem-
ber, 1886, V, xx, 414; Nature, July, 1886, xxxIv, 283.)

Barns and Stroubal have continued in the laboratory of the U. S.
Geological Survey their researches upon the effect of temper upon the
structure of glass and steel, and have published: “A note on the
structure of tempered steel,” ‘“‘Strain-effect of sudden cooling exhibited
by glass and steel” (two papers), ‘‘ Note on the hydro-electric eftect of
temper in case of steel,” and on ‘The viscosity of steel and its rela-
tions to temper.” (Am. J. Sci., May, June, 1886, III, xx1, 386, 439;
September, October, December, 1886, III, xxxi1, 181, 276, 444.)

Lehmann has observed certain remarkable spontaneous changes of
form in solid erystalline bodies, produced evidently by their interior
forces. These changes were observed with the microscope and in the
following substances: Quinohydrodicarbonic ether, protocatechic acid,
and ammonium chloride. The first of these substances, for example,

dissolved by the aid of heat, in aniline thickened with a little resin,
crystallized in leaflets which are parallelograms of 44°. But on grad-
ually lowering the temperature, these crystals change into others hav-
ing a pale green color and angles of 60°. This change may commence
at different points in the same crystal even, and so twist them, the
movement at the ends of the crystal having force enough to dis-
place the entire mass. The other bodies mentioned show the same
property. (Wied. Ann., xxv, 173; J. Phys., November, 1886, II, v, 479.)

Fonqué and Lévy have experimented to determine the velocity with
which vibrations are propagated through the ground. In their pre-
liminary experiments the vibration was produced by the fall of a steam-
hammer of 100 tons, at the Creusot works. The transmitted vibrations
were observed by means of a mercury surface; their arrival, as well ag
the instant of fall, electrically transmitted, being registered by hand on
a revolving cylinder. At 1,200 meters distance the jar produced by the
blow ceases to be perceptible directly to the senses but is distinctly
seen in the mercury. In the permian sandstone of Creusot, a velocity
of 1,200 meters per second was recorded, in a direction parallel to the
strata and 1,050 meters at right angles to their direction. The dura-
tion of the disturbance was nearly a second. At Meudon, where the
terrace is formed of a thick layer of Fontainebleau sand, the propaga-
tion of the vibration is much less rapid, 320 to 360 meters only per
second. But the duration of the disturbance was much longer, being
about 5 seconds at 500 meters and 34 seconds at 250 meters. Subse-
quently the authors employed an apparatus constructed by Breguet, in
which a sensitive gelatino-bromide plate was made to turn about a beam
of light reflected from the mercury bath. A shutter opens automati-

cally by an electric current upon the arrival of the vibration and be-
gins the exposure, closing again before the plate has made a complete
revolution. The registration attained is accurate to one twentieth of
a second. With this apparatus experiments were made in the permian
sandstone of Creusot, the granite of Montvicq near Commentry, and the
carboniferous sandstone of Commentry ; in the latter case in the mines,
beneath the surface of the ground. The results show: (1) The veloci-
ties of propagation are greater than by the old method; (2) the dis-
turbances caused by charges of powder or dynamite (up to 12 kilograms
of the latter) are, at equal distances, less than those produced by the
steam-hammer, falling through 5 meters; but even this at 500 meters
produced hardly more effect than stamping with the heel did at 10 me-
ters; (3) at the surface the shocks are multiple, enduring ten seconds
at the distance of 1,200 meters; but beneath the surface there is but a
single shock and that of short duration, whether the mercury is in the
mine or at the surface. (C. R., Feb., June, 1886, c11, 237, 1290.)

2. Of liquids.

Joly has suggested a simple method of finding the specific gravity of
small, heavy bodies. The substance, which may have a weight of only
a few milligrams, is melted into some paraffin of known specific gravity
in a small dish. The paraffin and substance are then floated in a spe-
cific gravity solution, and fromthe data thus obtained the specific gravity
of the substance can be calculated. It is especially useful for porous
bodies. (Nature, March, 1886, XXxXTII, 455.)

Handl has proposed to determine the density of a liquid by measur-
ing, by means of a water manometer, the hydrostatic pressure which it
exerts at a given distance from its free surface. (Anz. Ak. Wien., 1885,
148; J. Phys., May, 1886, II, v, 241.)

Amat has devised a density pipette for taking the specific gravity of
liquids. It consists of a straight glass tube, graduated, to the upper
end of which is attached laterally a V-tube, also graduated on both
limbs. The standard liquid is placed in this V-tube and by means of a
rubber spherical cap on the upper end of the pipette the given liquid
may be drawn into the main tube. Noting the height of this column,
and comparing it with the difference of level in the standard column,
the specific gravity of the given liquid may be read off in terms of the
standard. A small correction may be made for capillarity. Theresults
are accurate. (Bull. Soc. Chim., May, 1886, II, xLv, 482.)

if arectangular glass vessel filled with water is penetrated at bot-
tom by a tube connected by means of a tap with a lateral reservoir,
containing water colored with aniline, and the whole is at the uniform
temperature of the room, there is produced, when the tap is opened, a
red jet in the middle of the colorless liquid. By modifying the orifice,
and by placing within the liquid articles of various forms against which
the liquid jet may impinge very varied phenomena are produced, which
PHYSICS. 309

were first observed by Oberbeck, and studied more recently by K6ts-
chan. If the vertical jet for example strikes the center of a disk in
the form of a regular polygon, the reflected jet divides into as many
liquid sheets as there are sides to the polygon. These sheets are at
first inflected as they leave the disk, but then recurve themselves, form-
ing volutes of great elegance directed toward the interior of the poly-
gon. The memoir is illustrated with numerous plates (Wied. Ann.,
1885, xxv1, 530; J. Phys., November, 1886, If, v. 479.)

Thomson and Newall have studied the formation of vortex rings by
drops falling into liquids. When a drop of ink falls into water from
not too great a height it descends through the water as a ring, in which
there is considerable rotation about the circular axis passing through
the centers of its cross-sections. The drops were observed by instan-
taneous illumination; and it was seen that the drop enters the liquid as
a sphere, becomes flattened as it descends, and finally breaks into a ring
more than half an inch below the surface. To avoid complication
drops were let fall into liquids of the same kind. These liquids were
found to arrange themselves into four classes, distinguishable by the
character of the ring formed, and also by the ratio of the coefficient
of viscosity to the density. In Class I, ether, chloroform, and carbon
disulphide gave rings only very uncertainly, the drop breaking up and
spreading irregularly through the liquid. The ratio is not in this class
greater than 0.7. To Class 11 belong water, alcohol, turpentine, paraf-
fine, etc. These havethe ratio between 1 and 3, and give the best rings.
For Class lI the ratio is between 3 and probably 8 or 10. This class
includes moderately viscous liquids, such as butyl alcohol, amyl alcohol,
fairly strong sulphuric acid, and diluted glycerine. Class Iv includes
all the most viscous liquids like strong solutions of sugar, potash, sul-
phurie acid, glycerine. The ratiohas a value of 15 to 30, and no ring
is formed at all unless special precautions are taken to get large drops.
Capillarity plays no essential part in these phenomena. (Nature, Feb-
ruary, 1856, XXXII, 356.)

Vautier has applied a graphic method to the direct measurement of
the velocity of efflux of liquids. In the flat, horizontal bottom of a
cylindrical vessel full of water is an orifice in a thin plate, for which
an ajutage can be substituted. Inside the vessel and in the line of its
axis is placed a tube containing an emulsion of an insoluble liquid of
the same densityas water. This liquid is a mixture in suitable propor-
tions of nitrobenzine and oil of turpentine. The very fine bubbles of
this emulsion pass along the axis of the jet, of which they take the exact
velocity. The image of the jet, and therefore that of the bubbles, is
formed on a photographic plate, which by means of a suitable mechan-
ism is made to move at right angles to the trajectory of the jet. The
plate is exposed when the liquid begins to flow, so that it receives the
image of the jet during its passage. The plate, when developed, shows
one or more lines, according as one or more bubbles have passed during
340 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

the time of exposure. These lines are oblique, their direction being
made up of two rectangular motions, that of the plate and that of the
bubble. The velocity of motion of the plate is fixed by the vibrations
of a tuning-fork, and the exact direction of its motion by a dotted
line. Knowing the angle which one of the slanting lines in the photo-
graph makes, the velocity of the bubble, and so that of the jet, may be
readily deduced. (C. R., January, 1886, cir, 165; Phil. Mag., March,
1886, V, XXI, 285.)

Subsequently Vautier employed a rotating mirror for the same pur-
pose. The jet as before flows vertically downward and its image is
thrown on the screen by means of a lens; between the lens and the
screen is placed a plane mirror movable about a vertical axis. As the
bubbles fall vertically, the moving mirror causes a horizontal displace-
ment in its image; so that upon the screen an inclined line is seen, the
resultant of the two rectangular component velocities. The tangent of
the inclination angle is the ratio of thése velocities. His results con-
firm Torricelli’s law to within one-eightieth part—(C. R., August, 1885,
CIII, 372.

Amagat has adopted the principle of the differential manometer for
measuring very high pressures, the necessary conditions being that the
pistons be completely mobile and at the same time perfectly tight. The
large piston rests on a cushion of castor-oil which transmits the press-
ure to the mercury. The small piston which receives all the pressure
at the top becomes quite tight if after being soaked in oil and put in
its place it is wetted on its base with a sufficiently viscous liquid, such
as molasses, which answers perfectly. Under these conditions, the pis-
tons even being somewhat free, there is no real leak but only an ex-
tremely slow oozing which does not affect the measurements even up to
pressures above 3,000 atmospheres. The water was compressed in a
steel cylinder 1.2 meter long, hooped for its entire length except a part
of the breech. Its diameter was 3 centimeters and its sides were 8 cen-
timeters thick. The reading of the volumes of the compressed liquid
was effected by means of platinum wires fused into the stem of the
piezometer, by means of which the current from a battery reaches the
mercury in the steel cylinder. The precise moments at which the mer-
cury rising in the stem reaches the platinum wires successively, as the
liquid suffers compression, are thus noted on the galvanometer. The
following are the coefficients of compressibility for water at 17.6° and
for ether at 17.4°: For water between 1 and 262 atmospheres, 0.0000429 ;
between 1,334 and 1,784 atmospheres, 0.0000302 ; and between 2,590 and
2,98 atmospheres, 0.0000238 ; at 3,000 atmospheres therefore the volume
of water is diminished by one-tenth and its compressibility coefficient
by one-half. For ether between 1 and 154 atmospheres, 0.000156; 870
and 1,243 atmospheres, 0.000063 ; and between 1,623 and 2,002 atmos-
pheres, 0.000045. (C. R., August, 1886, cir, 429; Phil. Mag., October,
1836, V, XXII, 384.)

Koenig has calculated the coefficient of interior friction for several
liquids at a mean temperature of about 18°, from comparative ex-
periments made by Maxwell’s method of oscillating disks, and by the
method of flow through capillary tubes. Ether gave by the former
method 0.00274 C. G.S. units ; by the latter, 0.00256 ; carbon disulphide,
0.00451 and 0.00383; light benzine, 0.00627 and 0.00627 and 0.00523 ;
heavy benzine, 0.00862 and 0.00688 ; distilled water, 0.01587 and 0.01096 ;
and turpentine, 0.02836 and 0.01865. Hence the former method gives
somewhat higher results than the latter, and moreover the differences
increase with the coefficients. (Wied. Ann., xxv, 618; J. Phys., No-
vember 1886, I, Vv, 486.)

Ayrton and Perry have communicated to the Physical Society of Lon-
don a paper upon the expansion produced by amalgamation. They
find for example that the amalgamation of brass is accompanied by a
great expansive force. If one edge of a straight thick brass bar be
amalgamated it will be found that in a short time the bar is curved, the
amalgamated edge being always convex and the opposite edge concave.
The authors suggest that a similar action may be the primary cause of
the phenomena presented by the Japanese “‘ magic mirrora.” Japanese
mirrors are made of bronze and havea pattern cast upon the back; and
although to the eye no trace of it’can be discovered upon the polished re-
flecting surface, yet when light is reflected from certain of these mir-
rors on to a screen the pattern is distinctly visible in the luminous
patch formed. ‘This is due to the polished side opposite the thinner
parts of the casting being more convex than the others, a conclusion
verified by the fact that the pattern is reversed when formed by a con-
vergent beam of light. Such a condition of things would evidently re-
sult from a uniform expansive stress taking place over the reflecting
surface, the thinner—and consequently the weaker—parts becoming
more convex or less concave than the others. Hitherto this inequality of
curvature has been attributed toa mechanical distortion to which the
mirrors are intentionally submitted during manufacture to produce the
general convexity of the polished surface; but the authors now think
it possible that the use of a mercury amalgam in the process of polish-
ing may have an effect in the production of this inequality of curvature.

Warburg and Ihmore have experimented to determine the cause of
the layer of water which forms on glass and other bodies. They find:
(1) That above the dew-point no weighable deposit of water could be
detected on bodies with smooth surfaces, insoluble in water, such as pla-
tinum, glass with a coating of silica, glass free from alkali. Had the
thickness of such a layer exceeded one or two millionths of a milli-
meter, the balance was sensitive enough to have detected it. (2) That
the film of water which forms on alkaline glass above the dew-point
arises from a small quantity of free or loosely combined alkali on the
342 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

surface of the glass. It must absorb water until the vapor-pressure
above the solution of alkali is equal to that at the place of the experi-
ment. (3) That this deposit on alkaline glass, which can be weighed,
is the cause of the electrical surface conductivity which such glass shows
in moist air when tried by the eleetroscope. Any glass which showed
no weighable deposit of water with the balance in question was found
to bea good insulator when tested by the electroscope. (4) That rock-
salt showed a deposit of moisture some millionths of a millimeter in
thickness, at temperatures for which the vapor-pressure was greater
over a saturated solution of sodium chloride than the pressure in the
place of experiment. There was, however, in the rock-salt used a small
quantity of magnesium chloride, which would attract moisture, also,
until the vapor-pressure over its solution was equal to the vapor press-
ure in the place of experiment. (Wied. Ann., 1886, No. 4; Phil. Mag.,
May, 1886, V, xx, 452.)

Bunsen has analyzed the glass fibers used in his apparatus for the
condensation of carbon dioxide gas upon the surface of glass, and
which he had already proved to contain moisture. The analysis showed
the concentrated carbonic-acid solution forming these capillary layers
to have attacked the giass very decidedly ; 49.543 grams of glass fiber
yielding to cold water sufficient sodium carbonate to give 0.8645 grain
sodium chloride when evaporated with hydrochloric acid. It further
appeared that during the course of the experiment oue hundred and nine
days, 5.83 per cent. of the glass had been decomposed. However, only
two-thirds of the observed absorption can thus be accounted for, but
it is evident, notwithstanding the residuum, that glass is not a suitable
material with which to try experiments on capillary absorption. (Wied.
Ann., 1886, xx1x, 161; Phil. Mag., December, 1886, V, xx11, 530.)

The subject of capillarity and surface tensions has received consid-
erableattention. Sir William Thomson has discussed the phenomena of
capillarity experimentally in a lecture delivered at the Royal Institu-
tion (Nature, XxxIv, 270, 290, 366). Magie has determined the capil-
lary constants of several liquids by means of a method suggested by
von Helmholtz, which consists in deducing the radius of curvature of
the capillary surface, in a tube of small diameter, from observing the
image of a smail linear object produced by this surface. For mercury,
he obtained the mean value 45.52; distilled water, 7.226; carbon disul-
phide, 3.240; olive oil, 3.235; turpentine, 2.726; chloroform, 2.(:38 ; pe-
troleum, 2.441; alcohol, 2.214 (Wied. Ann., xxv, 421). Reinold and
Riicker have made a careful comparison of the surface tension of black
films (2. ¢., those thin enough to show the black of the first order of
Newton’s colors) with that of colored films whose thickness was from
ten to one hundred times greater. They conelude that when the black
part of a soap-film forms in the normal way, spreading slowly over the
surface, no evidence of any change in surface tension dependent on the
thickness of the film is furnished by a direct comparison of the tensions
PHYSICS. 343

of thin and thick films over a range of thickness extending from 1,350
to 12 millionths of a millimeter (Nature, June, 1886, xxxIv, 160). Magie
has also determined the capillary constant from a formula ef Poisson
which gives its value as equal to the square root of twice the surface
tension divided by the specific gravity. The formula contains, besides
this constant, the height of the summit of the drop above the plate,
the radius of the greatest section of the drop and the contact angle be-
tween the drop and the plate. Since the formula holds for an air-bub-
ble formed in a liquid under a level plate, the author has made the
necessary measurements upon such a bubble, and has obtained for the
capillary coustant of water 15.067 at 20°, absolute aicohol at about 149,
0,764; olive oil at 18°, 7.410; and petroleum (sp. gr. at 16°, 0.808), 6.755
at 15° (Am. J. Sei., March, 1886, III, xxxt, 13:)). Duhem has shown
that in order to treat properly the subject of capillarity and to bring
the investigations of Thomson on the connection between chaiges of
temperature aud changes of the capillary surface into accord with the
older ones, the ordinary mechanical treatment must be abandoned and
general thermo-dynamical methods adopted. He shows, first, that for
a system of bodies touching each other the potential is not to be sought
at a fixed temperature, but the thermo-dynamical potential, which con-
tains the changes of energy for varying temperature. Assuming that
the densilies and the actions of the molecular forces of bodies vary only
in infinitely thin’ surface layers, this supposition is sufficient to prove
that the thermo-dynamic potential consists of two parts, one of which
is a linear function of the content of the various bodies, the other a lin-
ear function of the surface in contact. From the formulas obtained the
laws of Gauss and Laplace for the shape of the surfaces are explic-
itly deduced. (Beiblaitterd. Phys., x,330; Phil. Mag., August, 1886, V,
XXU, 230.)

3d. Of gases.

In an extended experimental memoir on the law of gaseous flow, Hirn
has given the results of investigations made to determine whether a gas
under a constant pressure flows into a reservoir where the pressure also
constant is Jess than its own, with a velocity indefinitely increasing as
the pressure in the reservoir decreases; or whether there exists a limit-
ing velocity which is attained when this second pressure is zero. Rep-
resenting graphically the results of the experiments, it appears that
the maximum value to which the volume-equations point has no exist-
ence, and that so far as the velocity of flow is concerned the limiting
value indicated by Weisbach’s equation equally has no foundation in
fact. Hence it would seem that the true law of gaseous flow produced
by pressure-difference is yet to be discovered. Moreover, the author
calls attention to the discrepancy between his results and those pre-
dicted from the Kinetic theory of gases. According to this theory, dry
air cannot, under a constant pressure, flow into a perfect vacuum with
344 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886

a velocity greater than that of the gaseous molecules themselves at that
temperature, about 485 meters per second. Butin the experiments
now made, even with a notable counter-pressure, velocities of 6,000 me-
ters a second were observed. (Ann. Chim. Phys., March, 1886, Vi, vu,
289.)

Schneebeli has determined the absolute value of the friction-coef-
ficient for air by measuring the volumes which passed through a capil-
lary tube of known length and diameter, between the two extremities
of which a constant difference of pressure was maintained. The values
obtained range from 0.0001690 fo 0.0001734, the mean being 0.0001707,
closely according with that of Obermayer, which was 0.0001706, when
the difference of pressure was variable and 0.0001704 (corrected) when
this pressure was maintained constant. (Arch. de Genéve, 1885, XIV,
339; J. Phys., June, 1886, II, v, 290.)

Tomlinson has studied the viscosity of air by means of the torsional
vibrations of a pair of cylinders or a pair of spheres, suspended verti-
cally from and at equal distances from the center of a horizontal, cylin-
drical bar, the whole oscillating in a sufficiently unconfined space. The
bar was supported by a rather fine wire of copper or of silver. The co-
efficient of viscosity was determined from observations of the logarith-
mic decrement of amplitude of vibration, produced by the resistance of
the air to the oscillating spheres or cylinders, the distance of the eylin-
ders or spheres from the wire being such that the main part of the loss
of energy resulting from the friction of the air was due to the pushing
of this air. Five sets of experiments were made with this apparatus,
giving for the extreme values of the coefficient at 0°, 0.0001720L and
0.00017404, the mean being 0.00017 296, with a probable error of only 0.14
percent. (Nature, February, 1886, xxxI1I, 403.)

A subsequent experiment was made by Tomlinson at the suggestion
of Stokes, in which a hollow paper crlinder about 2 feet in length and
6 inches in diameter was suspended through its axis to a light, hollow,
horizontal bar about seven inches long, to the middle of which the wire
was soldered. The mean value obtained for the coefficient was
0.00017746 at 12.659; that previously obtained having been 0.00017711
at 11.79°. In the latter case the loss of energy is due to the dragging
of the air. (Nature, December, 1886, xxxv, 165.)

Holman has studied the effect of temperature upon the viscosity of
air and of carbon dioxide, using for this purpose capillary tubes about
30 centimeters in length. The results of the measurements seem to
show conclusively, as the author thinks, that the variation of the viscos-
ity with the temperature of the gas, at least in the case of dry ear-
bonie acid and of dry air freed from carbonic acid, which may be taken
as typical gases, is not proportionate either to the square root or to any
numerical power of the absolute temperature reckoned from—2749°.
They point therefore to the inference that all hypotheses yet advanced
to account for the variation of the viscosity of gases and hence also for
PHYSICS. 345

the viscosity itself are incomplete for this phenomenon. (Proc. Am.
Acad., May, 1885; Phil. Mag., March, 1886, V, xxt, 199.)

Krewiteh has communicated to the Russian Physico-Chemical Soci-
ety a paper on the relation between the elasticity and density of the
air in a rarefied condition. His experiments on the velocity of sound
show that at a temperature of 17.5 this velocity decreased from 350
meters at a pressure of 761 millimeters to 171 meters at a pressure of
2.6 millimeters. Ata pressure of 280 millimeters the velocity is about
the same as at the mean air pressure, but it diminishes rapidly below
280 millimeters. He concludes that below this pressure gases do not
obey the law of Boyle-Marriotte. (Science, February, 1886, vi, 161.)

Certain irregularities in the experiments made by Bohr on the loosely
combined oxygen in oxyhemoglobin led him to investigate the accuracy
with which, under low pressures, this gas follows Boyle’s law. The re-
sults of this investigation seem to him to prove indisputably that oxy-
gen varies considerably from the law under these conditions. In the
course of the experiments the unexpected phenomenon was met with
that the curve which expresses the relation between volume and tension
exhibits a strongly marked discontinuity at a certain tension, which
seems to suggest that there is here an alteration in the molecular com-
position of oxygen. He finds that at a temperature between 11° and
14° oxygen deviates from Boyle’s law within the limits in question.
The relation between volume and pressure, when the latter is greater
than 0.70 millimeter, being expressed approximately by the formula
(p+0.109)v=k; while for pressures below this value the formula becomes
(p+0.070)v=k. Moreover, if the pressure sinks below 0.70 millimeter
oxygen undergoes a change of state. By raising the pressure above
0.70 millimeter it may be res: ored toits original condition. (Wied. Ann.,
1886, No. 3; Phil. Mag., April, 1886, V, XxI, 368.)

A paper on the properties of matter in the gaseous and liquid states
under various conditions of temperature and pressure, by the late
Thomas Andrews, las been presented to the Royal Societ#*by its presi-
dent, Professor Stokes. The following are its conclusions: (1) The law
of gaseous mixtures, as enunciated by Dalton, is largely deviated from
in the case of mixtures of nitrogen and carbonic acid at high pressures,
and is probably only strictly true when applied to mixtures of gases in
the so called pertect state; (2) the critical point of temperature is low-
ered by admixture with a permanent gas; (3) when carbonic acid gas
and nitrogen diffuse into each other at high pressures the volume of
the mixture is increased; (4) in a mixture of liquid carbonic acid and
nitrogen at temperatures not greatly below the critical point, the liquid
surface loses its curvature and is effaced by the application of pressure
alone, while at lower temperatures the nitrogen is absorbed in the ordi-
nary way and the curvature of the liquid surface is preserved so long
as any portion of the gas is visible. (Nature, April, 1886, XXXII, 550.)

Winkelmann proposes to show the velocity of diffusion in diiferent
346 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

gases by filling air and hydrogen into two equally long barometer
tubes so that the mercury is aé the same height ineach. If, now, ether
in excess be added to cach tube, the mercury sinks more rapidly in the
tube containing hydrogen, and after a few minutes the tubes show a
marked difference of pressure, proving the vapor to diffuse far more
rapidly in hydrogen than in air. Ultimately, after some hours, the dif-
ference of pressure in the two tubes diminishes and becomes zero.
(Wied. Ann., 1886, No. 3; Phil. Mag., May, 1886, V, xx1, 451.)

Lomme! has described an aerostatic balance, useful for demonstrat-
ing the specific gravity of gases in lecture experiments. Under one
scale-pan of a balance is hung, by means of a wire, a closed glass bal-
loon which is inclosed in a glass vessel having in its cover a small hole
for the wire. This vessel has a side tube near the bottom, provided
with a stop cock. The instrument is balanced, while the vessel is filled
with air. If, now, another gas is allowed to stream in and displace the
air, the balloon rises or sinks according as the gas is heavier or lighter
than air. By adding weights in one seale-pan or the other equilibrium
is restored, and it is then easy to find how much, more or less, a volume
of gas equal to that of the balloon weighs than the same volume of air at
the same temperature and pressure. (Wied. Ann., 1886, No. 1; Nature
February, 1886, xxxIiI, 397.)

Grunmach has reported to the Berlin Physical Society on his baromet-
ric investigations, and has described at length the arrangement of the
normal barometer, the vacuum of which was measured in an electrical
way. A combination of the barometer vacuum with a Geissler tube
permitted the exhaustion to be examined even beyond the limits of the
pressures measurable by the cathetometer. The occurrence of the phos-
phorescent light in the spectrum tube is a standard for the highest de-
gree of rarefaction, in which the vacuum is filled with mereury vapor
having a tension of only 0.01 to 0.02™™, A still better vacuum would
be obtained_when the mercury was satisfactorily absorbed, a condition
which he had in vain tried to accomplish with selenium. <A large num-
ber of normal barometers were compared with this, by a method already
described at length, using the developed reduction formulas. Asa
result it appeared that the impurity of the free mereury-cup increased
the height of the meniscus and so the recorded height of the barometer.
In the subsequent discussion Goldstein proposed for the electrical
measurement of the vacuum, instead of a Geissler spectrum tube, the
employment of a wide tube which lets the phosphorescence become more
evident. But for the determination of the highest degrees of exhaustion
he maintained that the thermometer was better adapted than the phos-
phorescent tube. Ifa thermometer be placed in a vacuum tube whose
positive pole was a point, and whose negative electrode was a steel
plate nearly filling the tube opposite the cathode, then the thermometer,
when the exhaustion reached the point that light appeared on the ca-
thode, would rise 80° to 90° above the temperature of the room, At
PHYSICS. 347

the positive pole the rise was only 3°. This rise of temperature in the
light from the cathode, he thought, might be utilized to determine the
degree of exhaustion. (Nature, March, 1886, xxxtiI, 480.)

ACOUSTICS.

Bakmetieff has investigated the sounds which are produced by rods
of magnetic metal under the influence of intermittent magnetization.
He finds that the intensity of the sound diminishes by longitudinal
compression in the case of iron and of nickel rods. As to tension, it
diminishes indefinitely the intensity of the sound in nickel, but in iron
it causes it to diminish to a minimum only, and then as the tension in-
creases the sound becomes louderagain. But, on the other hand, Joule
has shown that iron submitted to a certain tension no longer elongates
by magnetization; and further that if the tension be still more increased
it actually shortens during magnetization. Barrett has sbown, too, a
diminution of the length of a nickel rod by magnetization. Hence the
author concludes that it is the change of the length which is the cause
of the sound produced by intermittent magnetization. (J. Soc. Phys.
Chim. Russe, 1885, xvu, 65; J. Phys., February, 1886, LI, v, 91.)

Semmola has observed that if a metallic plate or a sonorous cord be
traversed by very frequent discharges from an electric machine, they
give a sound which though very feeble is yet entirely distinct from the
noise of the spark. To hear this sound it is necessary to fix the metal
plate at the end of a sonorous collector of ebonite, which is brought
near the ear. The sounds become more acute in proportion as the dis-
charges succeed each other more frequently. Sound is also obtained
from a metal plate which is placed near to a conductor which is itself
traversed by electric discharges. The plate in this case should be con-
nected to earth, so that it may be said that the sounds which are thus
produeed by induction are like the phenomena of the return shock. (O.
R., May, 1886, cr, 1059.)

Violle and Vautier have studied the propagation of sound in a eyl-
indrical tube 0.70 meter in diameter designed to convey the water of
Rochefort to Grenoble. The portion of the conduit utilized consisted.
of two straight parallel tubes, each 6.375 kilometers in length, which
could be used separately or joined at one end by a semicircular tube of
the same diameter. The receiving apparatus used was in part that of
Regnault, with thinner membranes, and in part the manometric tam-
bours of Marey. The sonorous wave was produced by means of mu-
sical instruments or pistol-shots. When a pistol is fired at one end a
series of reverberations is heard, and in 18.6 seconds the sound reaches.
the bend, returning in 37.3 seconds to the end of the second tubes,
having traversed 12.75 kilometers. It is distinctly perceptible by the
ear as a single, dull sound. Accompanying itis a strong puff of air,
which at somewhat greater distances is the only thing perceived. This,
348 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 18386.

however, is observable even at 50 kilometers distance. Although its
energy is superior to that of the greater number of musical sounds per-
ceivable by the ear, yet absolutely nothing is heard. Substituting a
recording tambour for the ear, with achronometric fork for comparison,
the air-pressure curves for multiple lengths of the tube were obtained,
and from these exact measurements were made. The time required for
the wave front to pass once, twice, thrice through twice the length of
the tube was measured on the Regnault chronograph with the lever-
tambour and with an extremely sensitive membrane having an electric
contact. The first passage through the tube required 37.259 seconds
by the tambour and 37.251 by the membrane; the second required
37.337 and 37.334, respectively, and the third 37.383 and 37.384 seconds.
Hence it would seem that the velocity of propagation diminishes with
the intensity. (C. R., January, 1886, cir, 103.):

Neyreneuf has continued his researches upon the velocity of sound
in gases and has extended his experiments to vapors. The apparatus
used was a modified form of that described in the last report, con-
sisting of a reed and draw tube. The mean of twenty-four accordant
determinations in the case of steam gave a wave-length of 40.63 with
a mean error of 0.18, the value obtained for air in the same apparatus
and at the same temperature, 100°, being 28.5. In the experiments
with alcohol and ether, three reeds were used, the wave-length ratios
in air and alcohol being forthe three 1.239, 1.219, and 1.217, respectively,
while the wave-length in air is to that in ether as 1.71 and 1.706 to 1,
respectively. Assuming as the ratio of the specific heat of air at con-
stant pressure to that at constant volume the value 1.41, the author
calculates this ratio for steam and for the vapors of alcohol and of
ether and obtains the values 1.321 for the vapor of water, 1.14 for that
of alcohol, and 1.093 for ether vapor. Ann.Chim. Phys., December, 1886,
VI, 1x, 535-553.) -

Tomlinson has pointed out the fact that Werthein’s statement that
the velocity of sound in iron and steel is increased by a rise of temper-
ature not exceeding 100°,is erroneous. While it is true that the lon-
gitudinal elasticity of iron, as determined by the static method, will be
found greater at 100° than at 0°, provided we begin with the lower
temperature first and the wire has not, after the original annealing, been
previously raised to 100°; yet this apparent temporary increase of elas-
ticity is a really permanent one; and if the wire be repeatedly heated
to 100° and afterwards cooled, subsequent tests will always show a less
elasticity at the higher temperature than the lower, if sufficient rest
after cooling be allowed. When however we come to such molecular
displacements as are involved in the passage of sound through a wire,
even the apparent increase of elasticity above mentioned vanishes.
He had been able to prove that when an iron or a steel wire is thrown
into longitudinal vibrations, so as to produce a musical note, the pitch
of this note becomes lower as the temperature is raised, even when the

wire is heated for the first time after it has left the maker’s hands. (Na-
ture, April, 1886, XXXII, 582.)

Mach has indorsed von Helmholtz’s theory of sonorous sensations,
and has attempted to render it more complete by supposing that each
fiber of Corti vibrates, not only to its predetermined fundamental note,
but also, though more feebly, to the harmonics and even the subhar-
monies of this note. From this arises an auxiliary sensation of timbre
and a characteristic perception of musical intervals. (Anz. Ak. Wein,
1885, 275; J. Phys., May, 1886, II, v, 243.)

Robin has discussed the theory of the gamut and has given a table
in which are compared the number of vibrations of the notes of the
scale, the logarithms of these, and the lengths of strings giving these
notes, for the tempered gamut, the gamut played by musicians, and
that in use by physicists. An inspection of the table shows: (1} That
the tempered gamut, imposed practically upon all instruments with
fixed keys, differs much less from the gamut of the musicians than from
that of the physicists; and (2) that the differences between the two lat-
ter, notable for mi, la, si, and for almost all the altered notes, are espee-
jally great for re, sol,and la sharp, reaching nearly a semi-tone. (J.
Phys., September, 1886, II, v, 419.)

Boutet has made an experimental study of the best means of produc-
ing pure and constant sounds in tubes, and especially of the influence
of the material, of the form, of the diameter, and of the thickness of
sonorous orifices. The results are given in the form of tables. (Ann.
Chim. Phys., November, 1886, VI, 1x, 406.)

Von Lang has suggested the use of the Hipp chronoscope for the
purpose of determining the pitch of a tuning-fork. To do this the reg-
ulating spring of the chronoscope is adjusted to produce a note very
near in pitch that of the fork. By suitably bowing it, the fork is kept
in vibration for several minutes, and the beats produced by the two
sounds during this interval are counted. The chronoscope itself records
the number of vibrations of its spring; so that by adding to this the
number of the beats during the same time, the number of vibrations of
the fork may be determined to within about one-twenty-fifth of ane
vibration. (Anz. Ak. Wein, 1885, 221; J. Phys., May, 1886, LH, v, 340.)

Doumer has proposed to use manometric flames for the purpose of
measuring pitch. In principle the method is simple. Two manometric
flames are employed, placed near each other, one vibrating under the
influence of a sound whose pitch is exactly known, the other under that
of the sound to be measured. On measuring in the revolving mirror
how many vibrations of the latter correspond to a definite number of
the former, a simple proportion gives the pitch. In practice, however,
it is not easy to obtain in this way exact results. The author has there-
fore made use of a moving sensitive plate and has photographed simul-
taneously the images of the two flames. These flames were of gas
treated with benzine and burnt in oxygen. A lens of short focus pro-
350 _ RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

duced their images on the plate, which was moved by a special mech-
anism. (C. R., August, 1886, cit, 340.)

Fossati has suggested the use of the microphone, in order to deter-
mine the position of the nodes and loops in a sounding aircolumn. The
microphone is connected in the circuit of a telephone and one or two
cells of battery, and is lowered into the vibrating tube. At the nodes
it is thrown into vibration and the telephone sounds strongly. If the
telephone is omitted and the battery increased to five or six Bunsen
cells, then on using a glass tube and lowering the microphone into it in
the dark, bright sparks are observed at the nodes where it is thrown
into vibration, while at the loops it remains dark. This form is striking
as a lecture experiment. (Il Nuovo Cimento xvu, 261; J. Phys., De-
cember, 1886, II, v, 569.)

Thompson has expressed the opinion that the fact that the frequency
of vibration of an electrically-maintained fork is continually changing,
is in consequence of giving the impulses to the prongs at a disadvan-
tageous moment, namely, when they are at the extremities of their
swings. It is desirable, therefore, that the impulse should be given at
the middle of the swing, and to effect this he has suggested that each
fork should make and break the cireuit of the magnet influencing the
other one, and he has showr how the electrical connections can be
made to effect this ina simple manner. (Nature, July, 1886, xxxIv, 283;
Phil. Mag., August, 1886, V, xx1I, 216.)

C. A. Bell has presented a paper to the Royal Society upon the sym-
pathetic vibration of jets, giving the results of extended experiments
npon both gaseous and liquid jets, their vibrations being studied by
placing some portion in circuit with a battery and telephone, thus ren-
dering these vibrations audible. (Science, June, 1886, vit, 494.)

Wead has experimented to determine the actual time of contact
between the hammer and the string in.a piano. The method was sim-
ple. An electric circuit was completed through a cell, a resistance box,
a galvanometer, a fine wire round the stem of the hammer, a slip of
thin gold foil glued to the face of the hammer, the piano string, and
the frame. The contact between the hammer and string produces a
momentary closing of the circuit and a throw of the galvanometer needle,
from the amount of which the time of closing may be calculated. The
observations upon C, which made thirty-four double vibrations per sec-
ond, were very satisfactory and showed that the contact time for a very
soft stroke is about 20 per cent. greater than for an ordinary or hard blow.
The conclusion reached is that for an ordinary blow the time of contact
is one-sixth of the vibration period of the string instead of three-four-
teenths as was estimated by von Helmholtz. (Am. J. Sci., November,
1886, III, xx xu, 366.)

Violle has described to the French Academy an apparatus for show-
ing the two modes in which a vibratory motion is reflected according as
the end of the tube is open to the atmosphere or is closed by a solid

partition. In the latter case the velocity changes sign and the conden-
sation does not; in the former the opposite is the fact. (C. R., Decem-
ber, 1886, C 111, 1255.)

HEAT.
1. Production of heat.—Thermometry.

The values of the solar constant which have been given by Pouillet,
Hagen, Crova, Violle, and Langley have been examined by Maurer.
In his opinion the considerably higher values of Violle and Langley
arise from the assigning by these experimenters of too high a value for
the amount of solar radiation on the earth’s surface. Actimometric meas-
urements have recently been* made with a new apparatus of Weber’s,
under remarkably good atmospheric conditions. Six of these were
made on the terrace of the Polytechnicum at Zurich, two on the top of
the St. Gothard Pass (2,100 meters), and one on the Pizzo Centrale (3,000
meters). According to these, the maximum heat from the sun at mid-
day which a surface of one square centimeter receives in a minute un-
der perpendicular radiation is, in Zurich, from 1.10 to 1.32 thermal unit;
on the St. Gothard 1.38 to 1.41 unit; and on the Pizzo Centrale, 1.52
unit. (Beibl. Phys., X, 82; Phil. Mag., Sept., 1886, V, xx11, 312.)

Keller has sought to measure the increase of temperature produced
by a water-fall. In his experiments at Terni he obtained measurements
varying between 0.08° and 0.73°, while the calculated value was 0.37°.
Hence, while these results seem to prove the transformation of kinetic
energy into heat under these conditions, it is evident that they are
powerfully affected by the sources of error which he discussed. (Beibl.
Phys., X, 333; Phil. Mag., Sept., 1886, V, xxi1, 312.)

The use of gas for heating and motor purposes has rendered the de-
termination of its heating power of great interest. Witz has made
careful experiments in this direction, using a nickel-plated steel explo-
sion cylinder 2.36 inches in internal diameter and 3.54 inches high, the
metal being 0.079 inch thick. The top and bottom covers were screwed
on air-tight. Through the top cover a wire passed, and in the bottom
was a valve for filling or emptying the cylinder. In use it was placed
in a vessel 4 inches in diameter and 8 inches high, which acted as a
calorimeter, and held about 1.76 pints of water. The mixture of air
and gas was placed in the cylinder over mercury and fired by an elec-
tric current. As the result of a large number of experiments it appears
that the gas used in the experiments gives in burning about 5,200 calo-
rics (kilogram-degrees Centigrade) per cubic meter, equivalent to 584
pound-degrees Fahrenheit per cubic foot. This accords fairly with the
values obtained by Dugald Clerk, which are 489,268 and 504,888 foot-
pounds per cubic foot as the mechanical value of London and Manchester
gas, corresponding to 5,372 and 5,640 calorics. The heating power of gas
may be increased 77 percent. by carburation. (Ann. Chim. Phys., 1885,
VI, vi, 256; Science, May, 1886, v11, 467.)

Boltzmann has established theoretically the possibility of basing the
kinetic theory of gases upon the assumption of attractive forces only,
but under the express condition that these forces cease to act at infi-
nitely small distances. (Wied. Aun., xxiv, 37; J. Phys., Nov., 1886, II,
v, 504.)

Potier has discussed the law of freezing mixtures with reference to
the principle of maximum work, and shows that a direct combination
with absorption of heat is possible only when the temperature is supe-
rior to that of dissociation; while at a temperature inferior to that at
which dissociation commences, only combinations which evolve heat can
be formed. The inequality of Clausius establishes thus a connection
between the principle of maximum work ef Berthelot and the fact that
a high temperature is more often required to begin the dissociation ;
and this without giving by itself alone the explanation either of the
principle of maximum work or of the effect of a high temperature. (J.
Phys., Feb., 1886, IT, v, 53.) ;

Pictet, in, his memoirs upon freezing-machines, has called attention
to the remarkable properties, for purposes of refrigeration, of a mixture
of liquefied carbon dioxide and sulphurous oxide gases, obtained by
compressing the product obtained by the action of sulphuric acid on
charcoal. The mixed liquid has this peculiarity, that its vapor press-
ure increases less rapidly with the temperature than that of sulphurous
oxide alone; so that it reaches this pressure between 25° and 30°, and
becomes less beyond it. The vapor pressure of the mixed liquid is not
only much less than that of carbon dioxide, but actually less at temper-
atures above 25° than that of sulphurous oxide. The author thinks that
the two liquids form a compound at high temperature which breaks up
at lowones. Since this liquid not only kills microbes, but extinguishes
fires, it is also useful for many other purposes. (Arch. Sci. Gen., xrx,
570; J. Phys., June, 1886, Il, v, 289.)

Lightfoot has presented a paper on ice-making machinery and appli-
ances to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. He had designed
machinery for producing cold by the expansion of air after compression,
in which a weight of 1,000 pounds of air per hour can be reduced from
60° above to 80° below the Fahrenheit zero, the cooling water being at
60° F., with the expenditure of about 18 indicated horse-powers. A
novel application of freezing-machines was made in Stockholm in ex-
cavating a tunnel through gravel which was mixed with clay and water.
The innermost end of the tunnel was made into a freezing chamber,
and the gravel, ete., frozen; then it was easily removed. In this way it
was driven successfully for a distance of 80 feet. (Nature, May, 1886,
XXXIV, 45.)

Horace Darwin has described an improved form of temperature reg-
ulator, constructed for use in the room at the Standard’s office, where the
comparisons are nade. Its action depends on the variation of pressure
of a saturated vapor caused by a change of temperature. The liquid
PHYSICS. + goa

used as a mixture of methyl and ethyl chlorides boiling at about 2.5°
under normal atmospheaie pressure. The greatest daily change of tem-
perature observed in the room during a fourteen-day test was .04°, and
the least .01°. The details of construction and of management are given
in the paper referred to. (Nature, April, 1887, xxx11II, 596. See also
Pernet, Nature, May, 1886, xxx1rI, 48.)

On thermometric questions Whipple has described the method in use
at the Kew Observatory for the comparison and verification of ther-
mometers at the freezing point of mercury. (Phil. Mag. January, 1886,
V, xxI, 27.) Pickering has published notes on the calibration and stand-
ardizing of mercurial thermometers, and has described a modification of
his own, in delicate thermometers for calorimetrical work. (Phil. Mag.,
March, April, 1886, V, xx1, 180, 330.)

2. Expansion and change of state.

Weber has proposed the use of the pendulum method for determin-
ing the co-efficient of expansion of solids. The time of oscillation of a
solid body in vacuo depends on the form of the body, on its mass, and
on the distance of its particles from the axis of rotation. At two differ-
ent temperatures these distances are different, and hence the times of
oscillation differ. In other words, there is for every body a definite
relation between its temperature wu, its expansion co-efficient a, its di-
mensions d, and its time of oscillation ¢, which is expressed by the for-

2 12

mula a= Se The time of oscillation is to be obtained by noting
exactly the interval between two passages of the pendulum through the
vertical, six hours apart, using for this purpose a Hipp chronoscope
whose hands are put in motion by the pendulum of an accurate clock
and stopped by the pendulum under experiment. The temperature is
determined by means of a thermo-electrical couple. In this way the
author hopes for a precision of one hundred-thousandth part in the co-
efficient, in place of one six-thousandth with the present methods. (C.
R., September, 1886, cr, 553.) Ina subsequent note Guillaume criti-
cises this method, and shows that with the best possible installation a
precision of not over one three-hundredth part is to be expected by its
use; and, moreover, the apparatus is complicated. (C€. R., October,
1886, CIII, 689.)

A simple apparatus for showing that a wire is cooled when it is
stretched has been described by Dorn. Asteel vertical wire, about 0.7"
in diameter, is clamped at the upper end, while at the lower is fixed a
. Scale-pan in which weights can be placed. Round two adjacent portions
_ of this wire pieces of fine German-silver wire and of steel wire are wound,
the ends of which are so connected with a galvanometer that they form
a thermo-element. When weights are placed in the pan the galvanom-
eter shows a cooling effect, and when, after a time, they are removed, a
warming effect. Witha Wiedemann’s galvanometer, almost dead-beat,

arranged for projection with lamp, lens, and scale, a deflection of sev-
eral centimeters was obtained. The contact points of the dissimilar
metals must, of course, be protected from air currents. This may be
done with felt. (Wied. Ann., 1885, xxv1,334; Phil. Mag., January, 1886,
V, xxi, 80.)

Grimaldi has studied the expansion of ethyl oxide at pressures vary-
ing from 1 to 25 meters of mercury and at temperatures from 0° to 105°.
He finds that the equation of Avenarius, representing the expansion
of liquids at the critical pressure, is true approximately for the expan-
sion of ether at various pressures up to this point, provided that ateach
pressure the different co-efficients areemployed. The formula then gives
values differing by only about 1 per cent. from the experimental results.
(J. Phys., January, 1886, LT, Ws 290)

In consequence of Whipple’s communication to the Py aca Society
of London on testing thermometers down to the melting point of mer-
cury, the question was raised as to the uniformity with which this metal
contracted between 0° and —39°. Ayrton and Perry have tested this
matter experimentally, comparing the readings of a mercurial thermome-
ter loaned them by Whipple with those of a constant-volume air ther-
mometer, both immersed in a bath of frozen mercury which was allowed
gradually to become warm. When the results were plotted, they formed
a straight line so nearly that the conclusion may be drawn that mer-
cury expands as regularly below 0° as above 0°, and that there is no
critical point for this substance above its freezing point, as there is for
water. Hence temperatures down to —39° may be correctly measured
by a mercury thermometer the stem of which is graduated for equal
volumes. (Nature, April, 1886, xxx1, 575; Phil. Mag., October, 1886,
V, XXII, 325.)

Roth has proposed to determine fusing points by placing the sub-
stance in a tube of glass and immersing it in sulphuric acid, which is
then gradually heated. The apparent temperature of fusion is noted on
a thermometer placed in the acid, and a small empirical correction gives
the true temperature of fusion. (Ber. Berl. Chem. Ges., July, 1886,
x1x, 1970.)

Raoult has investigated the effect of mixing salts in solution upon the
temperature at which these solutions congeal. Calling the quotient ob-
tained by dividing the actual lowering of the freezing point by the weight
of the anhydrous substance dissolved in 100 grams of water the co-et-
ficient of depression, he enunciates the following law: If several sub-
stances, without chemical action on each other, are simultaneously dis-
solved in 100 grams of water, each substance lowers the freezing point
in the ratio of its weight and of the co-efficient of depression which it
possesses at the temperature of freezing of the mixture. Again, call-
ing the depression which would be produced by a molecule of any sub-
stance in 100 grams of water the molecular depression, the author gives
the following rule for obtaining its value; Trace the curve of the co-
PHYSICS...” 355

efficient of depression of the body supposed anhydrous from 1° to 49;
prolong the sensibly rectilinear part of this curve until it meets the
axis of ordinates; multiply the ordinate of the point of intersection by
the molecular weight of the substance dissolved, supposed anhydrous ;
the product obtained will represent exactly the molecular depression
sought. (J. Phys., February, 1886, II, v, 64.)

Von Helmholtz has communicated to the Physical Society of Berlin
the method by which he determined the minimum diminution of vapor
pressure necessary to produce condensation of vapor, the heat being
constant. A glass cylinder was one third filled with the liquid to be
tested. Its upper portion, containing the mixture of air and vapor, was
connected on one side with a manometer, and on the other with a tap
through which the exhaustion could be effected. The formation of cloud
was detected by directing a beam of light through the axis of the cylinder,
and by looking along aline making a small angle with this axis, the eye
being screened from the direct light. At ordinary temperatures a de-
pression of 10"™ of water was required to produce the cloud, while at
0° a depression of 12™™ was required. The statements of Coulier and
Aitken were confirmed, that the formation of cloud in saturated air was
induced solely by particles of dust. Saturated air, completely free of
dust, might suffer a depression of halfan atmosphere without formation
of any cloud without it. (Nature, April, 1886, XXXII, 552.)

Ramsay and Young have used an improved apparatus to determine
the vapor pressure of mercury. It consisted of a U tube inclosed in a
jacket containing the substance whose boiling point gave the tempera-
ture and connected with a manometer. The U tube was first filled
with mercury and boiled to expel air. Then on heating it and dimin-
ishing the pressure by means of a pump, vapor was evolved from the
mercury, which depressed the level on one side and raised it on the
other. From the difference of level in this tube and in a manometer
gauge connected with it, the vapor pressure was calculated. At 222.159
the vapor pressure of mercury was found to be 34.4°"; at 270.35° it was
124.35""; at 280.60°, 157.15"; 358.479, 767.43", and at 448°, 2904.5",
(J. Chem. Soc., January, 1886, xL1x, 37.)

Vincent and Chappuis have determined in Cailletet’s apparatus the
critical temperature and pressure for two series of gaseous substances,
the members of each of which series differed in composition by CH? and
showed a gradation of similar chemical properties. The first series con-
tained hydrogen chloride, methyl chloride, and ethyl chloride; the second
ammonia, methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine. Forhydro-
gen chloride the critical temperature was 57.5° and pressure 96 atmos-
pheres; for methy! chloride 141.5° and 73 atmospheres ; for ethyl chlo-
ride 54° and 182.5 atmospheres. For ammonia the values were for criti-
cal temperature 131° and pressure 113 atmospheres; for methylamine
155° and 72 atmospheres ; for dimethylamine 163° and 56 atmospheres,
and for trimethylamine 160,5° and 41 atmospheres, Hydrogen chloride

and ammonia seem to follow Dewar’s law, that the ratio between the
absolute critical temperature and the pressure is constant. The other
substances deviate from it, giving ratios which increase with molecular
complexity. (J. Phys, February, 1886, II, v, 58.)

Subsequently these authors extended their observations to intlude
propyl chloride, the three ethylamines, and the two lower normal pro-
pylamines, all liquid at the ordinary temperature. Their results con-
firmed those above mentioned, that the absolute critical temperature
increased with molecular complexity somewhat more rapidly than the
critical pressure. Moreover the critical tempera.ures and pressures of
isomeric substances are far from being equal. (C. R., August, 1886,
CI, 379.)

In a lecture at the Royal Institution, Frederick Siemens discussed
the phenomena of dissociation with especial reference to questions con-
nected with practical heat operation. (Nature, May, 1886, xxxIv, 64.)

Wroblewski has determined the density of liquified atmospheric air
as well as that of its component gases, by measuring the volume of gas
given by a known volumeof the liquid. At the critical temperature —
118°, the density of liquid oxygen is 0.6; while at—200°, at a pressure
of only 2 centimeters, the density is 1.24. Hence its atomic volume is
less than 14. The density of liquid nitrogen at—146.6°, the pressure of
its saturated vapor being 322 atmospheres, was found to be 0.4552 ; while
at—793°, under a pressure of one atmosphere, the density was 0.83 ;
and at—202°, with a pressure of 0.105 atmospheres it was 0.866. The
atomic volume is then about 15.5. Its expansion coefficient is 0.0311
at—153.7°, 0.007536 at —193°, and 0.004619 at—202°. Atmospheric air
on compression behaves like a mixture whose components followed
different laws of liquefaction; and when liquified its composition changes
with change of temperature or pressure. Thevalue of the density found
by experiment at —146.6° and under a pressure of-45 atmospheres was
0.59. Calculation gives 0.60 as the value obtained from liquid oxygen
and nitrogen. (C. R., May, 1886, cr, 1010.)

Nilson and Peterssen have described a new method for determining
the vapor density of volatile substances and at the same time the tem-
perature of the experiment. Four determinations with this apparatus,
of the density of the vapor of glucinum chloride at temperatures vary-
ing from 1080° to 15029, gave 2.77 as the mean value. (Ann. Chim.
Phys., December, 1886, VI, 1x, 554.)

Nodon has utilized the hygroscopie properties of gelatine in the con-
struction of a recording hygrometer. A layer of this substance is fast-
ened to the outside of a helix of Bristol board, the inside being pro-
tected by a non-hygroscopic varnish. An increase in the atmospheric
moisture expands the gelatine and unrolls the helix, as a change of tem-
perature does the helix of Breguet’s thermometer. The result appears
within ordinary limits to be independent of temperature. The hygrom-
eter consists of four such helices grouped in pairs upon the same
PHYSICS. 357

.

frame. One of the ends of each helix is fixed; the other acts on a pul-
ley so arranged that their mechanical actions are added. The two
pullies carry a silk thread attached to a light slide, moving between
vertical guides, and carrying a style which presses against a cylinder
carrying the paper and moved by clock-work. The hygrometric curve
is thus inseribed on the paper. (J. Phys., October, 1886, II, v, 461; C.
R., June, 1886, ci, 1371.)

Luvini has published a series of experiments made by him on the
spheroidal state with distilled water, soap-water, alcohol, and ether.
He has made the interesting observation that in rarefied air the tem-
perature of the spheroidal mass diminishes. On lowering the pressure
from 420™" to 50™", the liquid, always in the spheroidal condition and
near an incandescent wall, falls in temperature from about 83° to near
40°; that is, to a temperature at which the maximum elastic force of
the vapor is equal to the external pressure. In a closed vessel the tem-
perature of the spheroidal liquid rises above the normal temperature of
ebullition. It is common in blowing glass to inject a little water into
the cavity formed in the hot glass. The liquid becomes spheroidal and
its vapor blows out the glass. (Il Nuovo Cimento, 1885, xvi, 15; J.
Phys., December, 1886, II, v, 569.)

3. Conduction and radiation.—Specific heat.

Graetz has given the results of his determinations of the conductibil-
ity of liquids for heat, made by his new method, which consists in caus-
ing the liquid to flow at a given temperature through a narrow metallic
tube whose exterior is maintained at a somewhat lower temperature,
and in determining the mean temperature and the volume of the liquid
which has passed during a given time, when the stationary condition
has been established. Assuming that the flow of liquids in narrow
tubes may be calculated from Poiseuille’s law, the determination of the
coefficient of interval conductivity depends on the solution of an equa-
tion of partial differences of the second order, which contains no other
constants to be determined by experiment than the mean velocity of
flow and the radius of the tube. The values obtained were for glycerine
0.0382, alcohol 0.0327, ether 0.0227, petroleum 0.0213, turpentine 0.0195,
and carbon disulphide 0.0160, The quotient of this coefficient by the
product of the density and the specific heat is nearly constant. This
coefficient increases slightly with the temperature. (Wied. Ann., XXV,
337; J. Phys., November, 1886, II, V, 506.)

The law according to which an incandescent body emits energy has
been studied by Moller. A sheet of platinum carried to incandescence
by a current, is inclined at an adjustable angle: before a Wild photom-
eter, a similar plate of platinum unaltered in position being used for
comparison. Wild’s photometer consists of a double prism which brings
the beams from ¢he two sources into a common direction, the base of
which is covered with ground glass. The emergent and juxtaposed
358 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886

beams traverse a nicol, then a rhombohedron of spar cut of such a
thickness that the ordinary ray from one of the sources of light and the
extraordinary ray from the other issue juxtaposed. The two beams are
received by a telescope, having previously been equalized in intensity
by rotating the nicol. From this rotation the original intensities are
calculated. The results of measurements thus made confirmed very
closely the law of the cosines, and also showed that the amount of emit-
ted energy polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence increases
rapidly with the obliquity. (Wied. Ann., xxIv, 266; J. Phys., No-
vember, 1886, II, v, 574.)

Mereadier has divided radiophones into two classes: (1) those in which
the transformation of radiant energy into mechanical energy in the
form of sound is produced directly, and (2) those in which this trans-
formation of energy is effected indirectly through one or more interme-
diate stages. The original photophone of Bell,in which the intermittent
beam fell on selenium, and thus affected an electric circuit in which a
telephone was placed, was of the latter class. The author has observed
that if a beam of intermittent radiations be allowed to fall upon the di-
aphragm of a microphone, the corresponding note is distinctly heard in
a telephone in circuit with it; and further, such a beam is capable of
producing the same effect when thrown on the diaphragm of a magneto
transmitting telephone. (J. Phys., May, 1886; II, v, 215.)

Langley has continued his researches on radiant energy and has now
published his observations on invisible heat spectra and the recognition
of hitherto unmeasured wave lengths. As radiating surfaces Leslie
cubes were employed, covered with lampbiack and filled with boiling
water giving 100°, or aniline giving 178°. In some cases the cubes were
filled with ice, and even with freezing mixtures, at a temperature of
—20°. The apparatus consisted of a rock salt train, made up of two
rock salt lenses 75™" diameter and 350" focus, and a rock salt prism
64™" on a side. The conclusions reached from an examination of the
curves are (1), that the heat now measured is almost altogether of a char-
acter not observed in that of the sun, the wave lengths not being trans.
missible by glass; (2) that notwithstanding the compression of the in-
fra-red by the prism, these heat curves extend almost indefinitely in that
direction, the Leslie cube, for instance, at 178°, showing very measurable
heat at adeviation of 33°, corresponding to a refractive index of 1.4511;
(3) that an increase of temperature increases every ordinate, but not
equally, those in the more refrangible portions growing most rapidly;
(4) that hence there is a progressive movement of the maximum ordinate
toward the more refrangible end as the temperature rises ; and (5) that
these prismatic curves are not symmetrical, the greater portion of the
area ip every case lying toward the greater wave length. In one of the
plates accompanying the paper the curves of two heat spectra are given,
one from a surface at the temperature of boiling water, the other at that
of melting ice. As first approximations, the author believes that “ the
PHYSICS. 359

minimum wave length assignable to the minimum ordinate of the heat
curve in the spectrum of a source whose temperature varies from 100°
to 0° Centigrade, is a little less than 5y and a little over 6.” In other
words, that ‘some of the heat radiated by the soil has probably a wave
2ength of over 150,000 of Augstrém’s scale, or about twenty times the
wave length of the lowest visible line in the solar spectrum as known
to Fraunhofer.” This research, therefore, has rendered probable the
existence of measurable wave lengths of something greater than one
two-thousandths of an inch and has proved that the heat radiated from
the soil is of an almost totally different quality from that which is re-
ceived from the sun. (Am. J. Sci., Jan., 1886, III, xxx1, 1; Phil. Mag.,
May, 1886, V, xx1, 394; Ann. Chim. Phys., December, 1886, VI, rx, 433.)

In a subsequent paper on hitherto unrecognized wave lengths Lang-
ley gives an extended description of the method employed by him for
measuring these wave lengths, together with an account of the appa-
ratus used in the research. ‘‘ Broadly speaking,” he says, ‘we have
learned through the present measures with certainty of wave lengths
greater than 0.005™", and have grounds for estimating that we have
recognized radiations whose wave length exceeds 0.03", so that while
we have directly measured to nearly eight times the wave length
known to Newton, we have probable indications of wave lengths far
greater, and the gulf between the shortest vibration of sound and the
longest known vibration of the ether, is now in some measure bridged
over.” (Am. J. Sci., August, 1886, III, xxx11, 83.)

Wiedemann and Leudecking have studied the heat changes which
accompany the hydration and solution of colloids. When water is
progressively added to colloids such as gelatine, gum arabic, gum trag-
acanth, dextrine, starch, ete., two-stages of the action are observed. In
the first these colloids become hydrated with an evolution of heat. In
the second the hydrates formed dissolve in the excess of water with
absorption of heat. (Wied. Ann., xxv, 145; J. Phys., Nov., 1886, LI,
v, 495.)

Pickering has pointed out some of the sources of error incident to
calorimetrical work. He finds that the presence of anything but air
between the calorimeter and the jacket is most injurious; the space
should be entirely open and no cover of any sort should be used. .Be-
fore reading the thermometers the top of the stem should be tapped
for some time, otherwise the mercury lags behind the true temperature.
Moreover a thermometer when rising is invariably too low, and when
falling is invariably too high. The error thence arising is avoided by
conducting the entire experiment either with a rising or with a falling
thermometer. In his experiments the thermometers used had a range
of 15° and a total length of 600™". The readings were made at tem-
peratures between —1° and 26°, by the following method: The ther-
mometer was first heated to the highest temperature required in the
experiment, and, by the application of a flame to the mercury column
360 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

just beiow the enlarged space at the end of the tube, that part of the
mercury above the flame was broken off and driven into the space, where
it remained as the thermometer cooled. In this way the same part of
the scale could be used for different readings. The relative value of a
scale division was affected inappreciably while the absolute value
could be obtained by a single comparison with a standard. Further
improvements in calorimetry the author thinks lie in improved methods.
(Nature, Feb., 1886, xxx1, 405; Phil. Mag., April, 1886, V, xx1, 324.)

The ice melted in the calorimeter of Bunsen is estimated in one of two
ways: Hither by reading, on a graduated scale attached to the capillary
tube in which the extremity of the mercury column moves, the amount
of displacement; or by weighing the mercury drawn into the apparatus
during the melting. For this purpose a tube twice recurved and drawn
out like that of a weight thermometer, to a fine point, dips into a vessel
of mercury, and is weighed before and after the experiment. Blumeke
has proposed to combine the two methods and to use the divided scale
to determine the changes in the calorimeter before and after the experi-
ment, while the weighing method is reserved for the experiment itself.
Taps placed at the terminations of the bent tube and the capillary tube
permit communication to be established at the proper time between
either of these tubes and the calorimeter. (Weid. Ann., xxvi, 159; J.
Phys., November, 1886, II, v, 494.)

LIGHT.
1. Production and Velocity.

Auer has invented a lamp in which a cylinder of porous magnesia is
hung in a Bunsen flame. The burner of the lamp is surrounded by an
ordinary cylindrical chimney, and in the flame is hung a hollow cylinder
- of thin organtine impregnated with the magnesia solution. ‘The heat
of the flame destroys the organic matter and leaves the white magne-
sium oxide in the form of an elastic porous cylinder, which becomes
highly incandescent. The lamp is said to give alight of twenty candles
with a consumption per hour of 56 liters of gas. (Science, March, 1886,

Chase has called attention to the fact that Herschel’s high estimate
of the elasticity, or as he called it the “bursting power,” of the ether,
is not that of the simple etherial elasticity itself, as has been assumed
by Wood and others, but is that which is represented by the ratio of
the elasticity to the density; 7. e., is that which would be exerted if the
air and the ether were reduced to the same density. If we substitute
in Herschel’s proportion, the true density-ratio, we obtain 1,636,750 as
the ratio of the elasticity of air to that of the wether. This represents

The weight of the cubic inch of ether would be only sgrs00,000,000,000,000,000
ounce. (Phil. Mag., September, 1586, V, xxt1, 259.)

J. W. Gibbs has given a résumé of the results obtained by Newcomb
(see Nature, May, June, 1886, xxxIv, 29, 170) and by Michelson in their
experiments on the velocity of light. As the final result of his Wash-
ington experiments Newcomb gives 299,360 + 30 kilometers per second
as the velocity of light in vacuo. Michelson’s Cleveland experiments
give 299,853 + 60; a result substantially identical. Combining the first
of these values with Nyrén’s value of the aberration constant (20.492),
the value 149.60 is obtained as the sun’s distance in millions of kilome-
ters. Although both the above experimentors paid especial attention to
the question whether there was any difference between the velocity of
rd and of blue light, not the least indication of any difference was ob-
served. A difference of one-thousandth in these velocities would have
given a well-marked color to the return image of the slit in Newcomb’s
experiments. Butno such effect could be detected. Michelson covered
one-half the slit with a red glass; the two halves of the return image
were exactly inline. Gibbs also gives the values which have been most
recently obtained of the ratio between the electro-magnetic and electro-
static units, which, according to Maxwells electro-magnetic theory of
light, represents the velocity of this agent. These values, as corrected
for the true value of the ohm, are as follows: Ayrton and Perry, 1878,
296.1; Hockin, 1879, 296.9; Shida, 1880, 295.6; Exner, 1882, 291.7 (?);
J. J. Thomson, 1883, 296.3; Klemencic, 1884, 301.88 (?). They should
be compared with the velocity of light in air, expressed in millions of
meters per second—299.778 according to Newcomb. Setting aside Ex-
ner’s and Klemencic’s values, the other four are closely accordant, their
mean being nearly identical with that of J. J. Thomson, which appears
to be by far the most worthy of confidence, and differing by only one
per cent. from the velocity of light. Michelson’s experiments on the ve-
locity of light in carbon disulphide afford, the reviewer thinks, an inter-
esting illustration of the difference between the velocity of waves and
the velocity of groups of waves—a subject to which Rayleigh has called
attention in an appendix to the second volume of his ‘Theory of Sound.”
The quotient of the velocity in vacuo divided by the wave velocity in
carbon disulphide, calculated from Verdet, is for the line D 1.624 and
for E 1.637; while the group velocity, when used as a divisor, gives
1.722 and 1.767, respectively. Michelson’s experimental result was
1.76 + .02, agreeing well with the latter. (Am. J. Sci., January, 1886,
Ili, xxx1, 62.) Subsequently Shuster has argued in support of Ray-
leigh’s conclusion that the velocity measured by the revolving-mirror

method of Foucault is really neither the wave velocity V nor the group

that while the aberration method measures V, and the eclipse of Jupi-
ter’s satellites and Fizeau’s method measure U, Foucault’s revolving-

Ms or ao (Nature, March, 1886,
XXxIII, 439.) In reply to this note Gibbs calls attention to the fact
that it follows from Rayleigh’s formulas that while the individual wave
rotates, in the revolving-mirror experiment, the wave-normal of the
group remains unchanged; or, in other words, that if we fix our atten-
tion on a point moving with the group, and therefore with the velocity
U, the successive wave planes, as they pass through that point, have
all the same orientation. ‘To get a picture of the phenomenon,” he
says, ‘“‘ we may imagine that we are able to see a few inches of the top
of a moving carriage-wheel. The individual spokes rotate, while the
groups maintain a vertical direction.” This consideration, he thinks,
greatly simplifies the theory of Foucault’s experiment, and makes it
evident that the results of all such experiments depend upon the value
of U and not upon that of V. (Nature, April, 1886, Xx xIII, 582.)

Gony has repeated, by means of Foucault’s method, experiments to
determine the relative velocity of red and blue rays in carbon disul-
phide. Several concordant series of obervations show the deviation to
be greater for blue than for red light, the difference being about 5”, or
one-twentieth of the deviation for the red ray. This result he thinks is
in accord with theory. (C. R., July, 1886, crr1, 244.)

Michelson and Morley have repeated Fizeau’s experiment on the in-
fluence of the motion of the medium upon the velocity of light. He
had announced the remarkable result that the increment of velocity
which the light experienced was not equal to the velocity of the medium,
but was a fraction of this velocity, which depended on the index of
refraction of the medium. The formula of Fresnel is equivalent to the
statement that the ether within a moving body remains stationary,
with the exception of the portions which are condensed around the par-
ticles. If this condensed atmosphere be insisted on, every particle, to-
gether with its atmosphere, may be regarded as asingle body, and then
the statement is simply that the ether is entirely unaffected by the
motion of the matter which it permeates. The authors used essentially
the same form of apparatus as Fizeau. Light from a given source falls
on a half-silvered surface where it divides, one-half being reflected
through one of two tubes 28™™ in diameter and 6 meters long and back
through the second, the other half passing through the second tube
directly and being reflected back through the first. The tubes being
filled with distilled water, the light from an electric lamp was directed

toward the central glass of the refractometer, and the latter adjusted
by screws till the light passed centrally down both tubes and then the
right-angled prism at the farther end adjusted till the light returned
and was reflected into the telescope, where generally two images were
observed. These were made to coincide and the fringes at once ap-
peared. Ata given signal the current of water was turned on, moving
in opposite directions in the two tubes. The width of the central fringe
was measured micrometrically and the displacement in one direction:
The current of water was then reversed and the displacement again
measured. This displacement was nearly the width of an entire fringe.
The velocity of the water being determined, the value sought is easily
calculated. The authors announce as the result of their work that the
conclusion obtained by Fizeau is essentially correct, and that the lu-
miniferous ether is entirely unaffected by the motion of the matter which
it permeates. (Am. J. Sci., May, 1886, III, xxx1, 377.) At the next
meeting of the French Academy Cornu thus spoke of the foregoing
research: ‘‘Leur travail concu dans esprit le plus élevé, exéeuté avec
ces puissants moyens d’action que les savants des Etats-Unis aiment a
déployer dans les grandes questions scientifiques, fait le plus grand hon-
neur a leurs auteurs.” Fizeau himself also added his commendations
(C. R., May, 1886, cr, 1207).

The British Association committee on standards of white light have
made a preliminary report. An examination of existing standards, they
say, convinces them that the standard candle as defined by act of Par-
liament is not in any sense of the word a standard. The French “ bec
Carcel” is also liable to variations; and with regard to the molten plati-
num standard of Viollé, it seems that the difficulty of applying it is so
great as to render its general adoption almost impossible. As to pro-
posed standards, the majority are satisfied that for all the present com-
mercial requirements the pentane standard of Vernon Harcourt, which
has no wick and consumes a material of definite chemical composition,
is, when properly defined, an accurate and convenient standard, and
gives a much more accurate illumination than the standard candle. As
to future researches, the electrical direction seems promising, and a
standard of white light might be established defined somewhat as fol-
lows: <A unit of light is obtained from a straight carbon filament, in
the direction at right angles to the middle of the filament, when the
resistance of the filament is one-half of its resistance at 0° C., and when
it consumes 10° C. G. S. units of electrical energy per second. (Nature,
January, 1886, XXxI1I, 236.)

Koenig has described Weber’s photometer to the Berlin Physical
Society. It consists in the main of a small benzine lamp which is
placed in a tube in front of a mirror and which illuminates a milk-glass
plate adjustable in the tube. From this plate the light is carried toa to-
tally reflecting prism and thence into the eye-piece, where it lights up one-
half of the field of vision. The other half receives light from another milk-
364 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

glass plate placed behind the prism and toward the eye-piece, this plate
being Uluminated by the light to be measured. When the lights are
of the same color, the measurements with this instrument are very exact,
but if not, this precision could not be obtained. By placing a red, a
green, and then a blue glass before the eye-piece and taking the mean,
a closely approximate result may be obtained with this photometer.
(Nature, March, 1886, xxx1II, 480.)

Subsequently Koenig described to the society a photometer sent to
him from Dublin, which apparently far surpassed the Bunsen form of
instrument. It consisted of two quadratic prisms of cast paraffin, con-
nected to each other along one side. Between these two prisms was
placed a piece of silver or of tin foil. When light fell on one of the
prisms, this prism appeared clear white on account of the diffused re-
flections. This light was able to reach the other prism only through
the metallic foil, and it therefore appeared dark. But when a second
source of light was placed on the other side, the second prism appeared
also bright. By displacement along a graduated scale the photometer
could be brought into the position where both prisms appeared equally
bright. A reading of the distances enabled the ratio of the intensities
to be readily calculated. (Nature, May, 1886, xxxtIv, 48.)

The Bakerian lecture before the Royal Society was on color photome-
try, and gave the results of Captain Abney’s and Major-General Fest-
ing’s researches in the direction of ascertaining whether it was practi-
cable to compare with each other the intensity of lights of different
colors. They found that by placing arod in front of a patch of mono-
chromatic light thrown on a screen, and by casting another shadow by the
side of the first by means of a candle, the intensities of the two lights
which illuminated the two shadews could be compared by what they
term an oscillation method. As tothe value of mixed light compared
with its components, they give the following law: The sum of the in-
tensities of two or more colors is equal to the intensity of the same rays
when mixed. (Nature, April, 1886, xxx1I, 525.)

The committee appointed by the Trinity House to report on the merits
of electricity, gas, and mineral oil as ligbt-house illuminants have issued
a valuable report giving an account of the investigations carried out
under their directions and the conclusions they have arrived at, which
are as follows: That the electric light as exhibited in the experimental
tower at South Foreland has proved to be the most powerful light under
all conditions of weather and to have the greatest penetrative power
in fog; that for all practical purposes the gas and oil were equal; and
that for the ordinary necessities of light-house illumination mineral oil
is the most suitable and economical illuminant. They believe, however,
that for salient headlands, important land-falls, and places where a very
powerful light is required, electricity offers the greatest advantages.

2. Reflection and refraction.

A new method of reading small angular deflections, like those of gal-
vanometers, for example, has been devised by D’Arsonval. It may be
briefly described as the inverse of Poggendorfi’s (subjective) method.
_ Usually the objective of the observing telescope forms at the conjugate
focus a diminished image of the object—the scale as reflected in the
mirror. D’Arsonval places the scale—a small one reduced by photog-
raphy, giving tenths and twentieths of a millimeter—at this conjugate
focus and obtains a magnified image of it reflected in the mirror and
situated above the objective. This enlarged image, which is enormously
displaced for small angular movements of the mirror, is again observed
by an eye-piece bearing the usual cross wires. (Nature, April, 1886,
mxeKET, 610;)

Mouchez has described a magnified form of mercury bath or artificial
horizon which was constructed by Gautier for the Paris Observatory.
A cylindrical cast-iron vessel, containing mercury, carries an axis at its
center, on which is cut a screw-thread. A second and slightly smaller
cast-iron vessel, having a similar screw-thread tapped through the bot-
tom, is placed within the first, movable up and down on the screw-
thread along the axis. This inner vessel is perforated with a small
hole through which the mercury enters from the outer vessel to form
the reflecting layer when the inner vessel is screwed down. This re-
flecting surface is found to be independent of the vibrations of the earth,
but only under the condition that the screw be neither very tight nor
very loose; since in the former case the two vessels are too firmly
united and the vibrations are communicated from one to the other;
and in the latter the inner vessel simply floats on the mercury, appar-
ently assuming a condition of unstable equilibrium, the variations then
producing in the mercury slow wave motions, thus preventing observa:
tion. The use of this new apparatus has thus far given excellent re-
sults at the Observatory. (C. R., January, 1886, ci, 147.)

The results which have been obtained by Abbé, as the outcome of
several years of experimenting to produce new and better kinds of op-
tical glass, have now been published. These experiments began in Jan-.
uary, 1881, and were prosecuted in connection with Schott, who took
the chemical part of the work, Abbé himself taking the optical. The
progress made justified the building a special laboratory in Jena in
1882, containing furnaces in which 10 kilograms of glass could be melted
at once. Two problems occupied attention during 1883. The first was
the production of pairs of kinds of flint and crown glass, such that the
dispersion in the various regions of the spectrum should be for each
pair as nearly as possible proportional. The second was the produc-
tion of a greater multiplicity in the gradations of optical glass in re-
spect to the two chief optical constants, refractive index and mean
dispersion, In the fall of 1883 the two problems were regarded as sat-
366 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

isfactorily solved, the first with the result that achromatic lenses of a
much more perfect kind than has ever been attainable have been pro-
duced, and as the outcome of the second a whole series of new glasses
of graduated properties have been introduced into practical opties.
Associating themselves now with the eminent microscopists Zeiss
Brothers, new microscopic objectives have been made of the new glass
to which Abbé gives the name apochromatic objectives. These lenses
dry give better definition than the ordinary achromatic water immer-
sion lens, higher eye-pieces may be used with them, and their visual
and photographic foci are identical. The new glass is now produced
in Jena on the large scale. (Nature, October, 1886, XxXIv, 622.)

Vogel has determined the variation of refraction with temperature
both in glass and iceland-spar. The measurements were made by the
method of minimum deviation, and the temperatures were comprised
between 12° and 260°, the three hydrogen lines and the sodium line
being used as points of reference. For 12° the first coefficient for the
line D was for white glass 123 x 10°, and for heavy glass 190 x 10°, the
second being 106x 10" and 147x 10°. For cale-spar the coefficient was
for D, 81x 10° for the ordinary, and 1020 x 10° for the extraordinary
ray. (Wied. Ann., xxv, 87; J. Phys., January, 1886, II, v, 45.)

Bertrand has described a new refractometer, constructed especially for
the optical study of rocks. (J. Phys., May, 1886, II, v, 223.)

Gladstone, in a paper read at the Aberdeen meeting of the British
Association, emphasizes the value of the refraction goniometer in chem-
ical work, and suggests its use far more generally than has hitherto been
the case. (Nature, February, 1886, xxxII, 352.)

Chappuis and Riviére have studied the refractive index of air with a
view to determine its variation with pressure. They find for their ex-
periments at 21° and up to a pressure of nineteen atmospheres the fol-
lowing formula: n-— 1=0.0003554 p (1+ 0.00058 p), in which n is the in-
dex for the line D, and p the pressure in meters of mercury. Hence the
index of air for the line D at 0° and 0.76 meter pressure is 1.0002927,
identical with Mascart’s value. (C. R., June, 1886, cr1, 1461.)

Rayleigh has measured directly the amount of light reflected from
glass, as follows: Light from a cloud was passed through ground glass
in the window of a darkened room, and made to fall at the polarizing
angle on a plate of glass. The transmitted and reflected rays were con-
ducted along different paths by a series of reflectors,-but finally emerged
side by side and of equal intensity. One of these reflectors was the
glass to be tested, the light falling on it at an incidence almost perpen-
dicular. This glass was now removed, and a single mirror was shifted
so as to make the angles and points of incidence of the reflected ray on
the several mirrors the same‘as before. The reflected ray was now
brighter than the transmitted. To re-establish equality a disk with
holes in a ring round the center was rotated in the path. The ratio of
the sum of the breadths of the holes to the whole circumference of the
PHYSICS. 367

ring gave the percentage of the light reflected. A piece of optically-
worked black glass reflected .058 of the total incident light. Repolish-
ing in one case increased the light reflected from .04095 to .0445. (Na-
ture, November, 1886, xxxv, 64.)

Howard Grubb has given a lecture at the Royal Institution upon tel-
escope objectives and mirrors, their preparation and testing, with par-
ticular reference to his own methods and results. (Nature, May, 1886,
XXXIV, 85.)

Stroh has described, in a paper to the Royal Society, a lantern combi-
nation by which stereoscopic effects may be obtained on a screen, asin
ordinary projection. (Nature, May, 1886, xxxrv, 68.)

3. Dispersion and color.

The new spectrometer constructed by Hilger for the physical labora-
tory of University College, Dundee, has proved very satisfactory in its
performance, reading directly to one second of are and giving reliable
results. Its construction is very simple. The collimator stands ona
heavy pillar by itself; and the circle, which is divided to five minutes
of are on a ring 15 inches in diameter with six radial spokes, is carried
on another pillar. The telescope, counterpoised, turns on the same axis
but does not touch the circle at any point, and the reading is thus
managed: From the telescope-bearing a double girder with a semicir-
cular plate tied across its diameter with tubes of brass, stretches hori-
zoutally above the semi-circumference of the divided circle. To theends
of this girder are fixed two long-focus microscopes whose axes produced
intersect the divided circle at the extremities of a diameter. They are
read by means of a pointer and a spider-line micrometer whose head is
divided into three hundred parts, each of which represents one second
of arc. The microscopes are carried at such a height that they easily
pass the collimator, and they can be read in any position. The light
from the collimator passes entirely under the girder. (Nature, May,
1886, XXXIV, 92.)

Cornu has described a method by which he has succeeded in obtain-
ing hydrogen spectrum tubes free from other substances. In the first
place it is necessary that the mercury pump should be as far as possible
from the apparatus which is to be traversed by the electric discharge,
and that the communication between them should be established by
many meters of helical tubes of glass, connecting with tubes of larger
diameter containing first, fragments of sulphur to arrest the mercury
vapor, and then copper turnings to take up the vapor of sulphur. All
the parts of the apparatus should be sealed to each other by fusion.
The hydroget is produced by the electrolysis of dilute phosphoric acid,
in a V-shaped voltameter, one of whose limbs communicates with the
apparatus. The tubes are first exhausted, a few bubbles of gas are
admitted and the rarefaction is continued. The spectrum shows spec-
tra of carbon compounds. The battery current to the voltameter is
368 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

then reversed and ozone is passed into the apparatus to wash it out.
After more or less repetitions of this process, the hydrogen spectrum is
obtained pure. The original paper must be consulted for the details.
(J. Phys., March, 1886, II, v, 100.)

_ In a subsequent paper Cornu gives a description of the method em.
ployed by him for photographing the ultra-violet portion of the diffre~
tion spectrum obtained from these hydrogen tubes, and also desuives
the mode of measurement which he employed to obtain the wave lengths
of the lines from the photographic plate. Ten of the lines thus meas.
ured have wave lengths almost identical with those measured by Hug-
gins in the spectra of white stars. (J. Phys., August, 1886, II, v, 341.)

In studying the photographic spectrum of hydrogen, Cornu has ob-
served that those groups of metallic lines which reappear periodically
with a particular regularity belong to the category of those which re-
verse themselves. Moreover, they get nearer together, and diminish in
intensity toward the more refrangible end of the spectrum. The spec-
tra of aluminum and thallium are excellent examples. Now, in these
metallic spectra certain series of lines spontaneously reversed, present
sensibly the same law of distribution and intensity as that of the hydro-
gen lines. (J. Phys., March, 1886, II, v, 93; Nature, June, 1886, XxxIv,
105.)

Wiedemann has cautioned experimenters engaged in studying spark
spectra against using for this purpose the spark of an induction coil,
because of its composite character. The spectra produced by such a
spark are multiple, their character changing with each of the partial dis-
charges; so that one of these discharges may produce a line spectrum
and another a band spectrum. Moreover, it is not the sum of these im-
pressions that is observed, since the diminution of visual sensitiveness
with time is felt ina way which is quite different for these sparks of dif-
fering intensity. Hence he prefers to use the Holtz spark for spectra.
(Ann. Chim. Phys., January, 1886, VI, vir, 143.)

Bell, under Rowland’s direction, has determined the wave lengths of
thirty of the lines in the ultra-violet spectrum of cadmium. Seven of
the lines measured were in the visible spectrum, and their wave lengths
were determined by direct micrometric measurement. The others were
fixed from measurements of their photographs. The author believes
them correct to one fifty-thousandth part. (Am.J. Sci., 1886, [J], xxx1,
426.)

Macé de Lepinay has sought to determine the absolute wave length
of the line D, by an ingenious and novel method, which consists in de-
termining optically, by means of Talbot’s bands, the dimensions of a
quartz cube as a function of this wave length, and thence its volume
in terms of this wave length, on the one hand. And on the other, in
determining by the balance, from the loss of weight in water, its abso-
lute volume in milliliters. The values obtained for the D, line are, in
vacuo, 5.8917 x 10° (milliliters)! ; and in air 5.38900 x 10° (milliliters)+. As

soon as the exact relation is known of the liter to the cubic decimeter,
these values can of course be converted into centimeters. (J. Phys.,

Pickering has made an extended comparison of the photographed
normal diffraction spectrum, published in 1873, by the late Henry Dra-
per, and of Cornu’s steel plate of the same region, with the photographs
of the solar spectrum recently issued by Rowland. The results of the
measurements show that the maps differ systematically, the wave
lengths according to Draper’s maps being too great for the lines of short
wave length. Applying the proper corrections to the two maps of
Draper and Cornu, the results agree closely with Rowland’s. The
mean difference for the seventy-six lines compared was 0.012, corre-
sponding to about one eight-hundredth part of an inch upon the Draper
map. It may therefore be assumed that the probable error of a wave
length derived from the map of Draper will not exceed one one-hun-
dredth of a unit, if the correction given be first applied. The wave
lengths given on Cornu’s map when thus corrected give an average
deviation of 0.025. (Am. J.Sci., September, 1886, III, xxxn, 223.)

Cornu has devised a simple but very ingenious method for distinguish-
ing those lines in the sun’s spectrum which are solar in their origin from
those which are terrestrial. Fizeau had shown that there is a displace-
ment of solar lines toward the red or the violet, according as the light
came from the receding or the advancing edge of the sun. No such
displacement occurs obviously if the lines are produced by absorption
in the earth’s atmosphere. This displacement is very minute, being
only about 735 of the distance between the D lines asa maximum. But
this Cornu has found quite sufficient. Using a Rowland grating, an
image of the sun is formed on the slit of the spectroscope by a lens, to
which a slight oscillatory motion can be given by the hand. To dis-
tinguish between a line of solar and one of terrestrial origin the line is
brought near the vertical wire of the eye-piece, or better still, near one
of those inevitable grains of dust which are always seen on the horizontal
wire. The lever connected with the lens is then oscillated so as to bring
alternately the two ends of the solar equator tangentially upon the slit.
If the line is of terrestrial origin it remains absolutely fixed; if it is solar
it oscillates with the lever. (Nature, July, 1886, xxxiv, 210; Phil.
Mag., November, 1886, V, xx1I, 458.)

Cornu at once applied this new method to the study of the solar spee-
trum groups a, B and A, and in an extended memoir has given a de-
tailed account of the modifications employed in the research. Fifteen
doublets were observed in the A group, thirteen in B, and eleven in a.
The paper is accompanied by an excellent plate giving all the lines of
the groups drawn to scale, and indicating those which are of solar and
those which are of terrestrial origin. These latter lines the author di-
vides into two classes, one of which is probably due to moisture. (Ann.
Chim. Phys., January, 1886, VI, vu, 5.)

Crookes has examined the phosphorescent spectrum of erbia and finds
that it consists of four green lines of wave lengths 5564, 5450, 5318, and
5197, respectively. Pure erbia is of a beautiful rose-pink color and when *
illuminated by sunlight or by the electric light it gives a spectrum of
black lines as sharp and distinet as the Fraunhofer lines. (Nature,
March, 1886, xxxIII, 474.)

Janssen in a paper to the French Academy, has given an account of
his experiments at the Meudon observatory, upon the absorption spec-
trum of oxygen. The first point noticed was the absorptive action ob-
served by Egoroff, producing the groups a, A and B of the solar spec-
trum. Besides this, however, another system of bands, much more dif-
ficultly resolvable, appeared as the pressure increased. The interesting
fact about this system is the law according to which the absorption
phenomena develop when the density and the thickness of the medium
traversed are simultaneously varied. The increase of effect is much
more rapid than the product of these factors; so that to represent the
facts, thickness of the layer must be multiplied, not by the density it-
self, but by the square of the density. Thus these bands have been ob-
tained in a tube 0.42 meter long, containing oxygen under a pressure of
70 atmospheres; while calculating from the results obtained with a tube
60 meters long, a pressure of 860 atmospheres wouid be required by the
law of the product of length and density solely; in other words, under
the condition that the beam shall traverse the same weight of matter.

Verneuil has given a method for preparing calcium sulphide, showing
a violet phosphorescence on insolation. Twenty grams of dense lime,
such for example as is obtained by the calcination of certain very hard
sea-shells, are finely pulverized and intimately mixed with six grams
of sulphur and two grams of starch. The mixture is then treated with
8c. ¢. of a solution containing 0.5 gram bismuth subnitrate, 100 e. ¢.
absolute alcohol, and a few drops hydrochloric acid, the liquid being
added drop by drop. When the alcohol has mostly evaporated, the mixt-
ure is heated in a covered crucible to a cherry-red heat for twenty min-
utes. After cooling, the mass is pulverized and again calcined for fif-
teen minutes. (OC. R., October, 1886, cr11, 600.)

In a paper read to the Royal Society Gemmell has described and
given the results of a series of experiments on particular specimens of
iron and steel, consisting of wires of soft Scotch iron, common wire,
charcoal iron, and soft steel, and bars of cast-iron and of malleable iron.
The object was to find the difference between these with respect to the
intensities of their total and residual magnetization due to different de-
' grees of magnetizing force. The results represent the effect of a cur-

rent gradually increased from zero tothe maximum gradually diminished
to zero again, and the same process repeated with a negative current.
It was found that the charcoal iron had the highest magnetizability, and
the soft steel the lowest; that of the soft Scotch iron approaching the
former. As toretentiveness, on the other hand, the charcoal iron shows
the least and the soft steel the greatest. Aunealing the latter brings
it very near the common wire in respect to magnetizability and reten-
tiveness both. The cast iron specimens differ considerably also; the
malleable bar shows a much higher magnetizability than the cast-iron
ores, but its residual magnetization was so low that it could not be
measured. (Nature, March, 1886, xxx1II, 473.)

In a series of experiments made to test the Ampére-Weber theory of
magnetism, Lodge subjected various substances to the action of a mag-
netic field, first strong to magnetize it and then weak and reversible to
test the magnetization produced. His observations have led him to the
conclusion that most likely every substance possesses some trace of
permanent magnetizability or retentivity. But in all these experiments
thereis a flaw; and that is that there is no guaranty that no trace of iron
is present in the body operated on. (Nature, March, 1886, xxxttI, 484.)

Bidwell has studied the changes produced by magnetization in the
length of iron wires under tension by means of a special apparatus so
arranged that the effects of magnetization on rods and wires can be ob-
served while they are under traction. Four specimens of iron were
used—a wire of commercial iron 1.2™" in diameter, a strip of annealed
charcoal iron, a piece of hard unannealed wire, and a wire of very pure
soft iron. The results show (1) that under the influence of a gradually
increasing magnetizing force the wire is at first elongated, then it re-
turns to its original length, and finally it contracts; (2) that the max-
imum elongation diminishes as the load increases, but according to a
different law for each quality of iron; (3) that the retraction due to a
given magnetizing force is greater with heavy than with light loads;
(4) that both maximum, elongation, and neutrality occur with smaller
magnetizing currents when the load is heavy than when it is light; and
(5) that the phenomena are greater for thin than for thick wires.
(Nature, April, 1886, xxx1II, 597.)

The question of the influence of temperature upon magnetization has
been examined by Berson. He concludes from the experiments of him-
self and others that iron, steel, nickel, and cobalt behave when mag-
netized in the same general way in regard to temperature. At first
these metals take a magnetic moment, increasing with the temperature,
pass through a maximum limit, and then decrease to zero. The only
differences are (1) in the precise temperature corresponding to the max-
imum (about 220° for nickel), and (2) in the temperature at which the
magnetic power disappears, 340° for nickel, cherry-red for iron and steel,
the point of fusion of copper for cobalt. (J. Phys., October, 1886, IT,
V, 427.) es

Wiedemann has given a résumé of his researches made several years
ago on the relation between the mechanical and magnetic properties of
bodies, especially the torsional effects of magnetism, and has added cer-
tain new experiments in confirmation of his theory. (Wied. Ann., March,
1886; Phil. Mag., July, 1886, V, xx11, 50.) Bidwell has replied to
Wiedemann, giving some experiments of his own which support Max-
well’s theory. If a longitudinally magnetized wire be fixed at the
south end, and if a battery current be passed through it from south to
north, the free north end of the wire, as seen from the fixed end, will be
observed to twist in the direction of motion of the hands of a clock.
Maxwell explains this by the fact that the wire is magnetized both cir-
cularly and longitudinally, and that the resulting magnetization is in
the direction of a right-handed screw round the wire. Since Jule bas
shown that an iron bar is increased in length and contracted trans.
versely when magnetized, aspirally magnetized wire would necessarily
twist. Bidwell has confirmed Barrett’s observation that nickel contracts
in length when magnetized. Hence on Maxwell’s theory it should twist
oppositely to an iron wire when spirally magnetized. This he finds to
be the fact. Moreover, Bidwell’s experiments on iron show that on
increasing the magnetization of iron it ceases to elongate and then
actually contracts. And further that if the iron wire is stretched, the
contraction takes place with smaller magnetizing forces. Now, on mag:
netizing such an iron wire spirally, its free end can be made to twist in
either direction by varying the current through the surrounding helix,
and when the wire is loaded the reversal of the torsion occurs with
smaller currents. (Phil. Mag., September, 1886, V, xxtt, 251.)

Sack has experimented to determine the specific induction constants
of magnets in magnetic fields of different strengths in order to fix the
limits of the effect noticed by Lamont that the change of magnetism is
greater when the force acts in opposition to the previous magnetiza-
tion than when it strengthens it. He finds that the coefficients of
weakening and strengthening are appreciably the same for fields in
which the strength does not exceed 1.2. With stronger magnetie fields
the magnitude of the constant of weakening which is produced by
the magnetic field on closing is greater than the constant of strengthen-
ing. (Wied. Ann., 1886, No.9; Phil. Mag., October, 1886, V, x x11, 386.)

Deprez has given the results of his experiments on the magnetic in-
tensity of the field in dynamo-electric machines, and has observed that
this intensity decreases much less rapidly than the distance between the
pole pieces increases; the intensity of the field in one of his experiments
diminishing to only one-half its value, while the distance separating the
pole pieces was increased from 7.5 to 75 millimeters, or tenfold. (C. h.,
October, 1886. C111, 712.)

Leduc has studied the variation in the resistance of bismuth when
placed in a magnetic field, and finds that this resistance increases by
-more than 15 per cent. in a magnetic field whose intensity is 10,000
PHYSICS. ato

C. G.S. units. He proposes to use this variation in the resistance for
the purpose of measuring the intensity of amagneticfield. Thisincrease
of resistance is in part due to the deviation of the equipotential lines,
and hence the resistance should be divided by the cosine of this devia-
. tion. But since this coefficient does not exceed 1.005, the explanation
of the greater part of the phenomenon is to be sought in the change of
structure of the metal, which produces a deformation in the electric field
of the metallic plate experimented on. (C. R., February, 1886, C11, 358.)

It has long been a question whether the intensity of terrestrial mag-
netism varies with the altitude; Humboldt, Kupffer, Forbes, Bravais,
and Martin maintaining that it diminishes as the altitude increases, and
Quetelet and Hartz holding the opposite view. Maurer has discussed
a series of observations made simultaneously on the summit of the
Senutis, 2,465 meters, and at the Polytechnicum in Zurich by himself
and Bayer, lasting seventy-nine days, and has failed to find any sensible
difference. Hence either the magnetic force is constant with altitude
or the variation is very small. (Arch. Sci. Phys., Gen., xxi, 339; J.
Phys., June, 1886, II, v, 290.)

Balfour, Stewart, and Schuster have discussed the phenomena of
terrestria) magnetism, the former in a paper entitled ‘‘ On the Cause of
the Solar-diurnal Variations of Terrestrial Magnetism,” and the latter
in a paper “On the Diurnal Period of Terrestrial Magnetism.” Both
these investigators conclude that the cause of these variations lies in
the upper atmospheric regions; and we can not imagine, says Stewart,
such a cause to exist in any other form than that of a system of electric
currents. (Phil. Mag., April, May, 1886, V, xxI, 349, 435; Nature,
April, 1886, xxxttl, 614, 620.)

Krueger has proposed to determine directly the vertical intensity of
a magnetic field by measuring the deflection which a disk suspended

‘horizontally by means of a vertical wire in a solution of copper sulphate
experiences when traversed in a radial direction by a current. The
vertical intensity of the earth’s magnetism at G6ttingen thus deter-
mined was 2.2903 times the horizontal intensity ; a value correct to the
svoo part. (Wied. Ann., xxvill, 613; Phil. Mag., September, 1886,
Wi XX, O11):

Nichols, following Remsen, has experimented to determine the chem-

- jeal behavior of iron in the magnetic field. A definite quantity of pow-

dered iron was introduced into a known weight of acid contained in a
beaker placed between the poles of an electro magnet, and the rise of
temperature noted in alternate experiments with the current off and on.
Nitric, hydrochloric, and sulphuric acids were used, and also aqua regia.
In all these both the speed of the reaction and the heat produced was
greater in the magnetic field except in the case of sulphuric acid, where

the heat was decreased. The prompt destruction of the so-called pas-

sivity of iron in the magnetic field was distinctly observed. (Am. J.
Sci., April, 1886, III, xxx1, 272).

2. Electric Generators.

Dorn has proved that when tourmaline is electrified by heating it, the
amount of positive electricity- produced is precisely similar to the
amount of negative electricity. The proof comes from the fact that if
the tourmaline, after being heated, is brought inside aconducting but in-
sulated hollow body, an electrometer connected with this body should
show no signs of electricity as the crystal cools. No deflection was ever
obtained which exceeded the uncertainty of the instrument employed.
(Wied. Ann., November, 10, 1885; Phil. Mag., January, 1886, V, xx1, 78).

Hilliaret has described and discussed the action of an influence ma-
chine of the Wimshurst type constructed by Bréguet. If the charge of
the machine is maintained from an external source the charge is theo-
retically limited ; but if the machine is self-exciting, the charge dimin-
ishes in geometical progression as the operations increase in arithmetical
progression, and the excitation falls rapidly to zero. This is readily
seen by putting the combs of the machine in contact. For practical
use the author thinks this type of machine preferable to any other °
form. (J. Phys., May, 1886, II, v, 208.)

Budde has calculated the quantity of electricity carried by a chem-
ical atom. - Faraday showed that the quantity of electricity carried to
the electrode by an atom of any electrolyte is directly proportional to
its combining power or valence ; and therefore that the quotient of this
quantity divided by the valence is constant for all atoms. The authors
therefore considers that this quotient, since it is the smailest quantity
of electricity which can be set free from any chemical decomposition,
represents an elementary electrical particle. To calculate it we must
know: (1) the electro-chemical equivalent of an electrolyte, and (2)
the absolute number of molecules contained in a unit mass of this sub-
stance. In the case of hydrogen, which is univalent, the electromag- .
netic value of the current which evolves 1 milligram of hydrogen per
second is 957, and its electrostatic value 957 v, or 957 x (3x10). One-
half this sets free 14x10! molecules or twice this number of atoms;
these values being given in milligram-millimeter-second units. Divid-
ing, we get for the value carried by any univalent atom 0.0000005i elec-
trostatic unit. (Wied. Ann., xxv, 562; J. Phys., November, 1886, II, v,
523.)

Lodge’s paper on the seat of the electromotive forces in the voltaic
cell has called forth several replies. In one of these, Ayrton and
Perry object to the assumption which he tacitly makes that there is
a prima facie absurdity in acknowledging a considerable difference of
potentials between two metals such as zine and copper in contact
with each other. Taking Lodge’s definition of electromotive force, as
already given by Maxwell, “the seat of the E. M. F. in any circuit is
the place at which the circuit receives or gives up energy as distinet from
heat due to resistance, and the amount of the H. M. F. is measured as
PHYSICS. 375

the amount of energy which enters the circuit per unit of electricity
passing that point,” and it is not possible to answer Lodge’s question
in any other way than that in which he has himself answered it. The
real question at issue between them is quite another one. It is, is there
an actual contact difference of potential between zine and copper? a
question which Ayrton and Perry answer in the affirmative. (Phil.
Mag., January, 1886, V, xxi, 51.) In his reply Lodge confines his re-
marks to the thermo-electric views put forth in Ayrton and Perry’s paper.
He thus restates their assumptions, every one of which seems to him
gratuitous and unsupported by experiment: (a) The characteristic
function of a simple thermo-electric circuit isan expression for the Volta-
effect between the metals of that circuit; (b) the Volta-effect of two
metals varies with the temperature; (c) the total E. M. F. of a thermo-
electric circuit is equal to the difference between the Volta-effects of its
two metals at the temperatures of the hot and coid junction, respect-
ively ; (d) the specific heat of electricity falls greatly as it flows from
copper to zine and rises a nearly equal amount as it flows from zine to
acid; (¢) the rate of variation of Volta-effect with temperature is a
measure of the Peltier-effect at a junction; (f) heat is generated or de-
stroyed at certain places in a circuit because electricity changes its ca-
pacity for heat there; (g) reversible energy actions may go on in a cir-
cuit when a current passes without producing heat or any other form of
energy on the spot, and without either propelling or retarding the cur-
rent. To accord with-his own view, the above statements should be for-
mulated as follows: (a) The characteristic function of a simple thermo-
electric circuit represents itself and no other physical phenomenon that
has yet been specially observed ; (b) the Volta-effect of two metals cer-
tainly varies with temperature if the heat tends to oxidize one metal
more than another, or in any other way to interpose a barrier between
metal and active medium, but the fact has no thermo-electric interest
whatever; (c) the total HK. M. F. of a thermo-electric circuit is the sum
of the forces in the different parts of that circuit, viz, at the junction
and in the metals, and has nothing on earth to do with Volta’s, or
Crookes’s, or Hall’s, or anybody’s else “effect,” except Peltier’s and
Thomson’s ; (d,e) the Peltier-effect at a junction is a measure and con-
Sequence of the H. M. F. located there; (/,g) heat (or more generally
energy) is generated or destroyed at places where the current does work
or has work done upon it; @. e., wherever it is opposed or assisted by an
EK. M. F., and nowhere else. (Phil. Mag., March, 1886, V, xx1, 263.)
Ostwald, in a letter to Lodge, describes a method based on a statement
by von Helmholtz, by which differences of potential, whether between
two liquids or between a liquid and a metal, may be directly measured.
(Phil. Mag., July, 1886, V, xx11, 70.)

Brown has communicated to the Royal Society an account of some
important experiments on contact action. He maintains that the differ-
ence of potential near two metals in contact is due to the chemical
376 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

action of a film of condensed vapor or gas on their surfaces. Such a
pair of plates is thus similar to a voltaic cell with its electrotype divided —
by a diaphragm of air of other gas; and it is the difference of potential
of the films that is measured in “contact” experiments, the metals
themselves being at one potential. His experiments were made with an
electrometer having quadrants of the metals under consideration. A
reversal of the electro-motive force takes place with pairs of copper-iron
when hydrogen sulphide or ammonia is added te the air surrounding
them; with silver-iron when hydrogen sulphide is added; and with
copper-nickel when either ammonia or hydrogen chloride is added.
Neutral or inert gases have little or no effect. By placing the (appar-
ently) dry plates of copper and zine in close proximity, so that their
films were in contact, a permanent current was produced, which ceased
when the metals touched or were separated to a certain distance. This
‘* film-cell” could be polarized by sending a current through it from
another battery. When the zine plate of a Volta condenser was joined
to the -zine quadrant of the electrometer and the copper of the con-
denser to the copper of the electrometer, on altering the capacity of
the condenser an alteration of the difference of potential near the quad-
rants was produced. (Nature, December, 1886, xxv, 142.)

Knott has examined the resistance and thermo-electric properties of
hydrogenized palladium. He finds that the electro-motive force in a
circuit of pure and of hydrogenized palladium, the temperature of the
junctions being 0° and 100°, is 20 x 104 C.G.S. units, or 0.002 volt. If
a palladium wire be hydrogenized for half its length by immersing that
half in an electrolytic cell, and the ends of the apparently uniform wire
be connected to a galvanometer, then on allowing a flame to play gently
on the central portion of the wire a strong current is obtained, which
increases to a maximum and then decreases to zero. (Nature, Septem-
ber, 1886, XXXIV, 462.)

Bidwell has exhibited to the Physical Society of London a cell with a
solid electrotype thus constructed: Upon a plate of copper a layer of
quite dry precipitated copper sulphide is spread. On this is placed a
clean plate of silver, covered with a slight film of silver sulphide by
pouring on it a solution of sulphur in carbon disulphide and evaporat-
ing the free sulphur by heat. On connecting the cell with a galva-
nometer a considerable deflection is obtained ; far greater than, and in
the opposite direction to, the deflection obtained with a silver plate not
thus treated. The resistance of the cell was very great—6,500 ohms—
but was greatly reduced by compression. The electro-motive force was
0.07 volt. (Nature, July, 1886, xxxIv, 211; Phil. Mag., V, xx, 328; J.
Phys., July, 1886, II, v, 339.)

Toscani bas demonstrated experimentally: First, that if in a battery
cell both surfaces of the zine are active, the contribution made by each
of them to the general useful effect is in the inverse ratio of the square
of their distance from the center of the inactive electrode; and, second,
PHYSICS. _ at

that whatever be the number of surfaces of zinc in metallic communi-
cation in any given element, and whatever be their distances from the
inactive electrodes each of these surfaces contributes to the general
useful action very appropriately in the inverse ratio of the square of
its distance from this electrode. (11 Nuovo Cimento, xvi, 138; J.
Phys., December, 1886, II, V, 573.)

Hopkinson has presented a paper to the Royal Society on dynamo-
machines, the purpose of the investigation being to give an approxi-
mately complete construction of the characteristic curve of a dynamo
of a given form from the ordinary laws of electro-magnetism and the
known properties of iron. Taking the curve already determined for
wrought-iron and constructing a characteristic in this way, he has ob-
tained a theoretical curve which agrees over a long range with the
actual results of observations on a dynamo-machine more closely than
any empirical formula yet published. (Nature, May, 1886, xxxIv, 20).

Gore has examined experimentally the effect of temperature upon the
Peltier effect, and finds that with couples formed of bismuth-antimony,
iron, German silver, and bismuth-silver, the total Peltier effect is greater
in each case at the higher temperature than at the lower one, but with
the antimony-silver couple the eifects at the two temperatures were
about equal. (Phil. Mag., April, 1886, V, xv1, 359.)

3. Electrical units and measurements.

Lorenz has experimented to ascertain whether the resistances of
liquid columns of the same length vary exactly in the inverse ratio of
their sections when these sections are quite small. By measuring di-
rectly the resistances of non-capillary mercury columns and comparing
them with those of capillary columns contained in tubes calibrated with
the greatest care, he findsa difference in the latter of from 14 to 21 per
cent. less than the calculated values. This difference, if real, is too
small, however, tv affect the absolute resistance except in the thou-
sandth’s place. ‘The author’s experiments fix the absolute value of the
ohm at 105.93 centimeters ; differing only by one-thousandth part from
the conference unit. (Wied. Ann., xxv, 1; J. Phys., November, 1886,
II, v, 539.)

Rayleigh has suggested certain criticisms on the details of the meth-
ods employed by Hinstedt in the determination of the ohm. He him-
self has found mercury contacts to be unreliable, and has substituted
platinum contacts for them. Moreover, the question should be consid-
ered whether the axial magnetization of the needle does not alter under
the action of a force having a sensible axial component. And, again,
the methods of winding and measuring the primary and secondary coils
introduce sources of error in his opinion. (Phil. Mag., January, 1886,
Neeson: 10.) .

In a paper on the Clark cell as a standard of E. M. F., Rayleigh has
discussed the relative advantages of various modes of preparation. The
378 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

greatest errors arise from the liquid failing to be saturated with zinc
sulphate, in which case the E. M. F. is too high. The opposite error of
supersaturation is also sometimes met with. If these errors are avoided,
as may easily be done; if the mercury be pure, (profusely distilled i
vacuo); and if the paste be neutralized either originally with zine car-
bonate or by allowing a few weeks to elapse (during which the solution is
supposed to neutralize itself),the electromotive force appears to be trust-
worthy to one-thousandth part. This conclusion is based on the exam-
ination of a large number of cells prepared by the author and by other
physicists. (Nature, February, 1886, XXXII, 357.)

Lippmann has devised an absolute spherical electrometer, which con-
sists essentially of an insulated metallic sphere raised to the potential the
value of which we desire to know. This sphere is so constructed as to
divide into two hemispheres, which are movable with respect to each
other, and which, when the system is electrified, repel with a perfectly
definite force. It can easily be shown that this force is one-eighth of the
square of the potential of the sphere. To measure this force, one of the
hemispheres is fixed, the other is suspended by a tri-filar system—three
vertical wires of equal lengths. Whenrepulsion is produced the movable
hemisphere can be displaced only parallel to itself; the three wires then
make asmall angle with their original vertical position, which angle is
measured by the mirror method. The product of the weight of the
movable hemisphere by the tangent of the angle of rotation is the
force. In the improved form of this instrument the two hemispheres
are contained within a concentric spherical envelope, which is connected
with the earth. By this means not only is the sensitiveness increased,
but the system is protected from air currents as well as from extrane-
ons electrical influences. (C. R., March, 1886, c1r, 666; Phil. Mag, July,
1886, V, xxu, 79; J. Phys., July, 1886, II, v, 323.)

Bichat and Blondlot have described two forms of absolute electrom-
eter, the one adapted to give continuous indications the other for high
potentials. In the former instrument, the attraction between two con-
centric cylinders is measured. One of these is fixed, the other is at-
tached to the beam of a balance; the other end of the beam carries a
disk moving in a cylinder to damp the oscillations. In the other elec-
trometer the movable cylinder is supported at the middle of its length
upon a knife-edge attached to the beam; it is balanced by adjustable
counterpoises. The upper portion of this cylinder is surrounded by a
second and hollow cylinder, which when electrified attracts the inner
eylinder upward. The lower end of the cylinder carries a scale-pan and
a damping cylinder of paper moving in a glass cylinder of slightly larger
diameter (C. R., March, cu, 753; July, 1886, c111, 245; J. Phys., L, v,
325, July ; 457, October.)

Kolacek has suggessed a method of using the gold-leaf electroscope
so as to get a detinite relation between the angle of divergence of the
leaves and the difference of potential between the leaves and the enve-
PHYSICS. oo

lope. The leaves were 8™ long, and were projected, magnified fifteen
times, upon a screen divided into centimeters. The reading of the dis-
tance was made about twenty seconds after the first impulse; and the
deflection is proportional to the square of the potential difference. The
condenser employed consisted of two copper plates 7°" in diameter, the
one screwed on the electroscope only being varnished. The vaiues ob-
tained for Daniell cells, for bichromate cells, and for copper-zine poten-
tial difference are satisfactory. (Wied. Ann., No.7; Phil. Mag., August,
1886, V, xxi, 228.)

Fitzgerald has devised a new galvanometer. Its peculiarities are (1)
the arrangement by which the coils can be measured in their place;
(2) the arrangement by which the circle is read with a microscope by
reflection mirrors attached to the magnet when the instrument is used
either as a sine or tangent galvanometer; and (3) an arrangement by
which a spot of light reads the tangents of deflection. The first ad-
vantage is secured by leaving the two pairs of short and long coils
wound in grooves, closed in outside by a glass plate, through which they
can be seen, and the external and internal diameter of each layer of
wire measured ; the transverse diameter, by looking through small holes
left in the ring that covers the coils outside. The reading is effected by
viewing a scale engraved on the inside of a horizontal ring surround-
ing the needle by reflection in two right-angled prisms attiched to the
needle, which reflect opposite sides of the scale. The corresponding
lines in the two maps, which differ by exactly 180°, is the line at right
angles to the line of intersection of the reflecting planes of the prism.
The exact position of that line can be read by means of a micrometer
in the eye-piece of the microscope. The horizontal graduated ring is
attached through the vertical axis on which the coils, etc., turn, to the
base of the instrument, and so the same circle does for reading when
the instrument is used asa sine galvanometer. By means of a small
mirror attached to the needle at 45° to the line of suspension a spot of
light can be reflected through the glass side of the instrument to a scale,
and then a uniform scale represents the tangents of the deflections.
(Nature, March, 1886, xxx111, 455.) Carey Foster has noted the fact
that Bertin, in 1869, showed that the sensitiveness of the tangent galva-
nometer for stroug currents may be increased and the usable range of
deflection doubled by placing the circle in a vertical plane inclined at
an angle of 45° to the magnetic meridian. (Nature, October, 1886,
XXXIV, 546.) Gray has described a modified form of sine galvanometer,
in which the coil consists of a single layer of wire’wound on a tube of
comparatively small diameter, say, ten centimeters or less, and of great
length, movable about a vertical axis, and carrying within it and at its
center the needle attached to a delicately suspended mirror. (Phil.
Mag., October, 1886, V, xx11, 368.) Thompson has described a modi-
fied form of Maxwell’s galvanometer. <A light frame of copper, upon
which is a coil of wire, is suspended between the poles of a horseshoe
38&QO RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

magnet, and a piece of soft iron is placed within the coil, but free from
it, which concentrates the magnetic force between the poles. The coil
is suspended by two silver wires, by which it is in connection with two
_binding screws on the base of the instrument. This galvanometer is
extremely simple in adjustment and is very dead beat; it has also the
advantage of being affected to an inappreciable extent by neighboring
magnets and currents with a current in its own coils; when no current
is traversing it, it is of course quite unaffected. (Nature, April, 1886,
XXXII, 574.)

Lalande has devised forms of voltmeters and ammeters which might
be called electrical arcometers. They consist of a bundie of soft iron
wires placed inside a metal arcometer, which is immersed in a glass
cylinder full of water, and round which is coiled the wire through which
passes the current to be measured. In the apparatus as constructed a
displacement of 10 centimeters corresponds to a strength of from 10 to
25 amperes at pleasure, or to a difference of potential of 100 volts. (C.
R., Cl, ——; Phil. Mag., February, 1885, V, xxt, 163.)

Blyth has described a new form of current-weigher for the absolute
determination of the strength of an electric current. in one of his in-
struments a current of 1 ampere produces an attraction equal to a
weight of .04818 gram. (Nature, September, 1886, xxxtv, 508.)

Pellat has applied the same principle to the constrnetion of an electro-
dynamometer, by means of which the absolute value of a current may
be determined within one two-thousandth of its value. (C. k., Decem-
ber, 1886, C111, 1189.)

Bidwell has described an improved form of Wheatstone’s rheostat,
which is of great use where it is important to adjust a resistance to a
nicety or to cause a continuous variation. (Nature, May, 1886, xxxIv,
70; Phil. Mag., July, 1886, V, xxIt, 29.)

Roiti has constructed an electro-calorimeter, formed of two Bréguet
spirals placed the one above the other; one having the silver on the out-
side, the other on the inside. Their opposite ends are fixed and receive
the current. Their free ends are connected togetlier and with a metallic
index, which they tend to turn in the same direction. A comparison
with the electric thermometer of Riess showed for the electro-calorime-
ter an equal sensitiveness. This instrument was employed in the elec-
trical exhibition at Turin in measuring the Gaulard and Gibbs second-
ary generator, and with satisfactory results. (Il Nuovo Cimento, XVIII,
1; J. Phys., December, 1886, I, v, 576.)

Ayrton and Perry have communicated a valuable paper to the Lon-
don Physical Society on the construction of voltmeters, particularly on
the best method of winding. (Phil. Mag., February, 1886, V, xx1, 100.)

Wassmuth has suggested that when a galvanometer needle is made
astatic by an auxiliary magnet placed at a distance froin it, there should
be placed in the vicinity of the magnet and perpendicular to its direc-
tion a plate of iron. The sensibility of the galvanometer is notably
PHYSICS. 381

changed by displacing this plate; and this without putting the needle
in a position of unstabie equilibrium. Moreover, the influence of ter-
restrial magnetism on a galvanometer may be materially diminished by
surrounding it with a ringofiron. (Anz. Ak.Wien, 1885, 148; J. Phys.,
May, 1886, II, v, 242.)

Carhart has observed that the equation expressing the electrical en
ergy absorbed by a motor per second as the product of the counter-elec-
tromotive force and the current EK, —EE,= —R W, is an equation of the
second degree, and therefore represents a conic section. On applying
the proper criterion he finds that the locus of this equation is a hyper-
bola. Plotting the curve, he draws important inferences from it, and
shows that Jacobi’s law of maximum rate of working applies only under
the condition of a constant electromotive force. (Am. J. Sci., February,
1886, III, xxx1, 95.)

Mendenhall has repeated and confirmed his experiments on the
diminution of the resistance of soft-carbon disks with pressure. With
a rod of hard carbon 12° long and 1.5™ in diameter, with plated con-
tacts inside of the ends, he observed a decreased deflection whenever
the rod was compressed in a vise. The soft-carbon disk was made to
form a partition between the two halves of a UY tube, and, mercury
being poured in so as to entirely cover the surfaces of the carbon, the
ends of the tubes were closed. On then blowing in through a rubber
tube connected laterally to each leg pressure’could be vroduced on the
carbon disk and the effect on the current passing through the disk
noted. All the experiments without exception showed great diminu-
tion in the resistance of the disk by increase of pressure; this resist-
ance in one case falling to one-half when the pressure was increased by
5 of mercury. (Am. J. Sci.; September, 1887, I11, xxxu, 218.) Tom-
linson has published a note on these experiments, stating that he pre-
fers to believe that the change does not take place in the specific resist-
ance of the carbon itself, but is due to better surface contact; erro-
neously assuming that the Edison soft-carbon disks are formed by com-
pressing a mixture of lamp-black with gum-water. (Phil. Mag., No-
vember, 1886, V, xxl, 442.)

» 4. Electric spark and electric light.

According to the hypothesis of Edlund, a perfect vacuum is a good
conductor of electricity, and the resistance of a gaseous column more or
less rarefied is composed of two terms, one of which represents the re-
sistance proper of the gas which diminishes with the pressure, the
other a resistance of which the surface of the electrodes is the seat, and
which varies according to an entirely different law, increasing as the
density of the gas diminishes and becoming so great at the lowest
pressures that can be produced artificially as to have given the impres-
sion that a vacuum is aninsulator. Homén, under Edlund’s direction,
has made a series of measurements on the resistance of air columus
382 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

under varying lengths and pressures. He finds (1) that the resistance
proper of the air is sensibly independent of the section of the tube,
varies proportional to the pressure nearly, and ceases to be measurable
for very low pressures; (2) that the resistance at the electrodes in-
creases more and more rapidly as the pressure diminishes, becomes
strong enough at the lowest pressures to prevent the electricity from
entering the gas. According to Goldstein the seat of this resistance is
the surface of the negative electrode; according to Hittorf itis in the
luminous aureole which surrounds it, while Wiedemann places it in
the dark space which appears at low pressures. (Weid. Ann., xxv, 85;
J. Phys., November, 1886, IT, v, 543.)

In his memoirs upon comets, Faye has stated his belief that incan-
descent bodies are endowed with an actual repulsive force, and he gives
an experiment which he thinks proves this assumption. Wesendonck
has repeated and varied Faye’s experiment, heating the platinum strip
to incandescence, either by a current or by a flame, and modifying the
form of the apparatus, the nature of the gas within it, and the press-
ure; and he concludes that all the phenomenaobtained can be explained
either by the expansion of the gas in the vicinity of the incandescent
platinum or by the lateral passage of a part of the discharge through
the platinum strip ; and this without resort to repulsion. (Weid. Ann.,
XXVI, 81; J. Phys., November, 1886, II, v, 544.)

Righi has photographed the electric spark in air and in water, under
various conditions. The sparks in water were 7 or 8°" long, rose-red,
with weak discharges, white and very brilliant with strong ones. They
have noaureole. They are often ramified asin air and present over their
whole Jength small sparks, starting to the right and left like a sort of
down. Beautiful photographs have also been obtained of the aureoles
around the positive and negative electrodes, when the spark has not
tension enough to jump. Sometimes fwo images of the aureole are seen,
differing in brilliance, projected the one upon the other, the photographic
impression at the point of crossing being paler than the rest of the
most distinct image. This the author explains by supposing absorption
at a lower temperature by the layers nearest the plate of the light pro-
duced by those back of them. (Il Nuovo Cimento, xvui, 49; J. Phys.,
December, 1886, II, v, 575.)

Kayser has photographed successfully lightning discharges. He has
called attention to oné particular discharge formed of four flashes of
different sizes, parallel through all their sinuosities, decreasing grad-
ually in length and brilliance from the first to the fourth. He regards
it as an oscillating discharge between a cloud and the earth. He esti-
mated the total discharge to have occupied less than a half second.
(Weid. Anns., xxv, 131; J. Phys., November, 1886, I, v, 525.)

Emmott and Ackroyd have exhibited to the London Physical Society
an electric-light fire-damp indicator. It consists of two incandescent
lamps, one with colorless, the other with red, glass, the circuit being so
PHYSICS. 383

arranged that in an ordinary atmosphere the colorless lamp alone shines,
but in fire damp this goesoutand the red one lights up. This is effected
ina simple manner by the motion of a mercury contact opening the
lower part of a curved tube, one end of which is open and the other con-
nected with a porous pot of unglazed porcelain, the motion of the mer-
cury being due to the increased pressure in the pot caused by diffusion.
(Nature, July 1886, xxxiIv, 210; Phil. Mag., August 1886, V, xxu, 145.)

Von Lang has measured directly the counter electro-motive force of
the voltaic are as follows: Two separate sets of light apparatus are ar-
ranged symmetrically in the circuit of a Benson battery so that the
middle of the battery and the middle of the conductor uniting the two
lamps are at the same potential. By the aid of a Wheatstone bridge
the resistance of the two portions of the circuit are determined ; first
when both lamps are in action, again when the carbons have been re-
placed by resistances which restore the current to its primitive value.
The half-difference of the two values thus obtained gives the resistance,
which is compensated by the counter electro-motive force of one of the
voltaic arcs. This is readily calculated by multiplying the difference
obtained by the current strength. The value thus found is 38.6 volts.
(Anz. Ak. Wien, 1885, 89; J. Phys., May, 1886, II, v. 239, November,
542.)

Cross and Shepard have also studied the counter electro-motive force
of the arc, under various conditions. They conclude: (1) That there
is adefinite inverse electromotive force for the whistling arc, whose value
is approximately 15 volts; (2) that the inverse electro-motive force for
both the silent and whistling arcs diminishes slowly as the current in-
creases; (3) that the inverse electro-motive force, at least for the whist-
ling are, is less for the inverted than for the upright arc; (4) that the
great change in equivalent resistance which occurs when volatile salts
are introduced into the arc is chiefly due to a large fall in the inverse
electro-motive force, although there is at the same time a marked dim-
inution in the conductive resistance; (5) that the diminished total re-
sistance of the are in rarefied air is due solely to a diminution in the
conductive resistance; and (6) that there is some evidence to show
that with considerable reduction of pressure there is a slight increase
in the inverse electro-motive force. (Proc. Am. Acad., 1886, xx1, 227.)

Carhart has examined the question of electrical surface transmission
and concludes there is no sufficient scientific basis for making lightning
conductors of large surface, and that large sectional area is essential to
ample conductivity. (Am. J. Sci., April, 1886, ITI, xxx, 256.)

Douglass has suggested the use of fluted carbons 50"" in diameter
for light-house electric lighting. When in use no crater is formed in
either of the carbon points and their form is all that can be desired for
utilizing fully the maximum light of the radiant are. He estimates that
the actual gain in light by their use is not less than 10 per cent. (Na-
ture, July, 1886, xxxiv, 209.)

GENERAL AND PHYSICAL.

Nature and Origin of the Elements.x—Mr. William Crookes, F. R. S.,
president of the chemical section of the British Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science, gave an address at the Birmingham meeting in
September, in which he undertook with great skill and learning to adapt
the doctrine of evolution to the chemical elements. After glancing at
the difficulty of defining an element he noticed the revolt of many phys-
icists and chemists against the ordinary acceptation of the term. He
next considered the improbability of their eternal self-existence or their
origination by chance. He suggested as a remaining alternative their
origin by a process of evolution, like that of the heavenly bodies accord-
ing to Laplace. In this connection he remarks: “ This building up or
evolution is above all things not fortuitous; the variation and devel-
opment which we recognize in the universerun along certain fixed lines,
which have been preconceived and foreordained. To the careless and
hasty eye design and evolution seem antagonistic; the more careful in-
quirer sees that evolution, steadily proceeding along an ascending scale
of excellence, is the strongest argument in favor of a preconceived
plan.” Mr. Crookes then shows that in the general array of the ele-
ments, as known, a striking approximation is seen to that of the organic
world, though he admits this apparent analogy must not be strained.

He then reviews indirect evidences of the decomposition of the so-
called elements, taking into consideration the ight thrown upon this
subject by Prout’s law and by the researches of Mr. Lockyer in solar
spectroscopy. He also reviews the evidence drawn from the distribu-
tion and collocation of the elements in the crust of our earth. He gives
due consideration to Dr. Carnelly’s weighty argument in favor of the
compound nature of the so-called elements from their analogy to the
compound radicals.*

388 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

A study of a special method of illustrating the periodic law, proposed
by Prof. Emerson Reynolds, leads Mr. Crookes to a theory of the genesis
of the elements.

He supposes in the very beginnings of time, before geological ages,
the existence of a primordial matter, which he names protyle(zpo aud 527).
He imagines a ‘ primal stage, before even the sun himself had consol-
idated from the origiual protyle, when all was in an ultra-gaseous state,
at a temperature inconceivably hotter than anything now existing in
the visible universe; so high, indeed, that the chemical atoms could not
have been formed, being still far above their dissociation points. In the
course of time some process akin to cooling, probably internal, reduces
the temperature of the cosmic protyle to a point at which the first step
in granulation takes place—matter, as we know it, comes into existence,
and atoms are formed. As soon as an atom is formed out of protyle it
is a store of energy potential and kinetic. To obtain this energy the
neighboring protyle must be refrigerated by it, and thereby the subse-
quent formation of other atoms will be accelerated. But with atomic
matter the various forms of energy which require matter to render them
evident begin to act; and amongst others that form of energy which
has for one of its factors what we now call atomic weight. The easiest
formed element, the one most nearly allied to the protyle in simplicity,
is first born. Hydrogen (or perhaps helium), of all the known elements
the one of simplest structure and lowest atomic weight, is the first to
come into being. For some time hydrogen would be the only form of
matter (as we now know it) in existence, and between hydrogen and the
next formed element there would be a considerable gap in time, during
the latter part of which the element next in order of simplicity would
be slowly approaching its birth point. Pending this period we may sup-
pose that the evolutionary process, which soon was to determine the
birth of a new element, would also determine its atomic weight, its af-
finities, and its chemical position.”

Space at our command forbids our following the author further in his
sketch of the genesis of the elements. The application of radiant-mat-
ter spectra to the theory is a weighty contribution to the ingenious
argument so interestingly portrayed, and one which the author alone is
qualified to advance. (Nature, XxxIv, 423.)

Valency and the Electrical Charge on the Atom, by A. P. Laurie.—The
author points out the bearing of the facts of electrolysis on the true
nature of valency. Helmholtz has shown that it follows from Faraday’s
experiments on electrolysis, that while a monovalent atom carvies to the
electrode one charge of electricity, a divalent atom carries two charges
of electricity; iu other words, electrolysis proves that differences of
valency mean diiferences in the electrical charge on the atom. The au-
thor remarks that many elements vary in valency ; copper, for instance,
forms two very unlike series of compounds, one in which it is monova-
CHEMISTRY. 389

lent, and one in which it is divalent; since, however, we may pass from
cuprous to cupric compounds we are able to alter the electrical charge
on the atom, increasing it by some simple multiple. He remarks fur-
ther that in the case of the two copper chlorides their heat of forma-
tion per chlorine atom is not very different. It is well known that the
heat of formation of a salt approximates to the heat of formation as
ealeulated from the electro-motive force developed when that salt is
formed in a voltaic cell; hence from the heat of formation of the cuprous
or cupric chloride, an approximate calculation can be made of the
difference of electric potential between the copper atom and the chlo-
rine atom in the two salts. But since the heat of formation per chlo-
rine atom is nearly the same, the difference of potential is nearly the °
same in both salts; whence it follows that in doubling the electric
charge on the copper atom the potential is not also doubled. This sig-
nifies, then, that the capacity of the atom for electricity is increased at
the same time. Laurie then suggests that the idea of atomic weight
may perhaps be replaced by the idea of charges of electricity; that the
atoms of the elements are of the same weight and probably of the same
stuff,” and that only two things condition the properties of the atom,
namely, its electrical charge and its electrical potential. If this be ac-
cepted Mendelejeff’s table becomes a statement of the periodic relation-
ship between these. (Nature, Xxxv, 131.)

Water of Crystallization, by W. W. J. Nicol.— When a hydrated salt
is dissolved does it retain its water of crystallization or does this latter
cease to be distinguishable from the solvent water? Both views have
been held by chemists, but the author shows that the science of thermo-
chemistry clearly demonstrates that water of crystallization can not be
attached to the salt in solution. The argument will be found in the
original note. (Chem. News, LIV, 53.)

A Law of Solubility, by William Ackroyd.—The author announces as
a new law of solubility the following: ‘A body will dissolve in a sol-
vent to which it is allied more readily than in one to which it is highly
dissimilar.” Thus organic bodies, generally speaking, require organic
solvents, inorganic bodies inorganic solvents. Exceptions to the law
are admitted by the author. (Chem. News, LIv, 58.)

Chemical Affinity and Solution.—In a paper before the Royal Society
of Edinburgh, presented in 1878, W. Durham stated his opinion, based
on the results of many experiments, that chemical combination, solu-
tion, and suspension of solids, such as clay, in water, differ in degree
ouly, and are manifestations of the same force; that there seems to be
aregular gradation of chemical attraction from that exhibited in the
Suspension of clay in water up to that exhibited in the attraction of
sulphuric acid for water, which we eall chemical affinity.

More recently Mr. E. Durham endeavored to show that the theory of
3590 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR .1886.

valency as usually held is incorrect in assuming chemical affinity to act
in units or bonds, and insufficient to account for the various phenomena
of varying atomicity, or valency, molecular compounds, crystallization,
solution, alloys, ete., and that all these varied phenomena are simply
due to the chemical affinity of the elementary atoms; the difficulties
disappear if the idea of indivisible units of chemical affinity is aban-
doned. This view is illustrated by reference to the compounds HCl,
NH, and NH,Cl. In HCl we have two monovalent elements combined
and their chemical affinities completely neutralized or satisfied. In
NH, we have N considered as a trivalent element satisfied with three
monovalent elements. Now these twocompleted or satisfied compounds
combine with one another to form the third compound NH,Cl. This is
usually explained by regarding the N as acting with pentavalent force,
and the compound is represented thus:

H
|
H—N—H

ve
ie oar!

Durham thinks this explanatiou most unreasonable and incredible,
because it supposes that N, which has usually such a weak affinity for
Cl, can nevertheless decompose the HCl into its constituent atoms, and
fix the atom of Cl t6 itself. While onthe other hand the Cl leaves the
H, for which usually its affinity is so great, and unites itself to the N,
for which usually its affinity is so small. Durham explains this action
simply thus: The affinity of the Cl acts on all the four atoms of H, and
the affinity of the N does the same; and thus the whole molecule is
held together, aud may be represented thus:

Mr. Durham finds that chemists are apparently coming more and more
to agree with his views, and quotes Pattison Muir’s “ Principles of Chem-
istry” to substantiate this. By reference to Thomsen’s researches in
thermo-chemistry, he obtains data which he regards as demonstrating
the truth of his views on the subject of solution. He regards solution
as due to the affinities of the constituent elements of the body dissolved
for the constituent elements of the solvent ; thus NaCl dissolves in water
on account of the affinity of the Na for the O and of the Cl for the H.
- These affinities are not strong enough to cause double decomposition,
CHEMISTRY. ‘ 391

and therefore an indefinite compound is formed, which we eall a solu-
tion. On examining the heat of formation of chlorides and of oxides
(as obtained by Thomsen) he finds that that oxide (or chloride) which
has the greatest heat of formation is the least soluble. Thus the heat
of formation of the chlorides of Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba increases in the order
of the metals as given; and the solubility of the chlorides of these
metals decreases in the order given; again the heat of formation of the
oxides increases in the order Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, whereas the solubility of
these oxides decreases in the same order.

Mr. Durham contends that if his views be admitted, crystallization
can be satisfactorily explained, and regular structure follows :

In such a compound as BaCl, . 6H,0, the atoms of the molecule must
be arranged somewhat in this way :

Hy. 0
ONL" He°

| |
H,0 — Ba— Cl, = H,O
feo
O H,
EE.

His theory affords also a simple explanation of the freezing of water:
In water attraction exists between the H, of one molecule and the O of
another, and vice versa; now, if the heat of the liquid be diminished suf-
ficiently, that attraction will cause cohesion of the molecules, and will
produce solid water or ice, the regular structure of which is caused by
the symmetrical arrangement of the atoms. Hence the various condi-
tions of matter, solid, liquid, and gaseous, may be due to the chemical
affinity of the constituent atoms, modified in various ways by the kinetic
energy of the system.

These views are opposed to that which depicts chemical affinity as a
sort of arbitrary force acting in units or bonds; on the contrary, affinity
acts between all atoms of matter, whether of the same or different kinds,
in varying degrees of intensity and quantity, producing combinations
of more or less stability, graduating from the so-called meghanical mixt-
ure of clay and water up to the irresolvable molecules of the perma-
nent gas, condensing by its action the gas into the liquid, and the liquid
into the solid. In short, there are no hard and fast lines in nature, but
every phenomenon graduates by almost imperceptible degrees into an-
other. (Nature, xxxuII, 615.)

A General Method for the Determination of Molecular Weights, by F.
M. Raoult.—The author has previously shown that the molecular
weights of organic bodies soluble in water can be determined by the
amount of reduction in the temperature of its freezing point. Further
investigations now enable him to generalize this method and to main-.

tain that the molecular weights of all bodies, inorganic or organic, can
be determined in like manner, provided the bodies are soluble in some
liquid capable of assuming a solid state at a temperature ascertainable
with accuracy. The menstruums employed are acetic acid, benzene,
and water. The methods of procedure and of calculation will be found
in the original paper. (Ann. Chim. Phys. [6], vit, 317.)

On the Constitution of Acids, by W. A. Dixon.—The author proposes a
theory explaining the fact that some acids form with the alkali metals
alkaline hydrogen salts, whilst the similar salts of other acids are acid.
He suggests that, as is the case with organic compounds, the hydrogen
in inorganic acids exists in combination in two states, first, with oxygen
as hydroxyl, and, second, with two oxygen atoms as oxyhydroxyl. He
thinks that where both these exist in one acid the hydrogen of the oxy-
hydroxyl is invariably replaced first, and therefore the principal acid
function is in connection with oxyhydroxyl. Examples are taken from

The Ke-actions between Metals and Acids, by Henry KE. Armstrong.—
In the course of a paper before the Chemical Society of London on the
“action of metals on acids,” in which experiments were described at-
CHEMISTRY. 393

tempting to obtain evidence of definite compounds of metals in alloys
by dissolving the alloys in aliquid capable of acting on both metals and
determining the electromotive force between the alloy and a less pos-
itive metal, the author made the following remarks: ‘“* With reference to
the action of metals on acids generally it is probably impossible for the
chemist to pronounce definitely in favor either of the modern view that
the metal directly displaces the hydrogen of the acid, or of the older
view that the metal displaces the hydrogen from water, the resulting
oxide and the acid then interacting to form a salt; the decision of this
question must apparently depend upon the determination of the nature
of the phenomena during electrolysis of an acid solution. If the acid
alone be the electrolyte, then doubtless the modern view is the correct
one; but if both water and acid are electrolyzed, and in proportions
which vary according to the conditions, then both the old and new views
of the nature of the action between a metal and the solution of an acid
are correct, and the two kinds of change may go on side by side.”
(Chem. News, Lit, 212.)

Chemical Behavior of Tron in the Magnetic Field, by Edward L. Nich-
ols.—When finely-divided iron is placed in a magnetic field of consid-
erable intensity and exposed to the action of an acid, the chemical °
reaction differs in several respects from that which occurs under ordi
nary circumstances. The cause of one such difference may be found in
the fact that the solution of iron in the magnetic field is in a sense
equivalent to its withdrawal by mechanical means to an infinite distance.
Mechanical removal requires the expenditure of work, and the same
thing is doubtless true of what might be called its chemical removal.
In other words the number of units of heat produced by the chemical
reaction should differ, within and without the field, byan amount equiv-
alent to the work necessary to withdraw the iron to a position of zero
potential.

Experiments with aqua-regia and iron show that the speed of reaction
is greater in the magnetic field than without and that the heat of chem-
ical union is much greater. Under the influence of the magnet, aqua-
regia and iron produce nitrous fumes, whereas when the influence of
the magnet is removed only hydrogen is generated.

When experimenting with iron and nitric acid, interesting effects of
magnetism on the passivity of the iron were observed; five grams of
powdered iron lay in a beaker close above the poles of the electro-mag-
net which was in circuit. Some cold nitric acid was poured upon the
iron, but the latter remained passive. Wishing to note the character of
the reaction the author warmed the beaker slightly, then placed it upon
the poles of the magnet and put a thermometer into the solution to get
its temperature. The bulb of the thermometer touched the iron in
Stirring the acid, when the hitherto passive mixture burst almost ex-
plosively into effervescence, and red nitrous fumes were liberated.
Removal of the solution from the field of the magnet restored the pas-
394 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Sivity of the iron, and the action in a few seconds ceased entirely.
When the beaker was brought back into the neighborhood of the mag-
net a touch of a glass rod excited again the violent chemical action.
Further researches are in progress. (Am. J. Sci. XXXI, 272.)

Density of Liquid Oxygen and of Liquid Nitrogen, by S. Wroblewski.—
The author finds that liquid oxygen has a density of 0.6 at —118° ©,
and of 1.24 at —200° under a pressure of 0.02". The following table
gives the constants for liquid nitrogen:

Hence the atomic volume of oxygen is less than 14, and that of nitro-

The density of liquid air at —146.6° C. and 45 atmospheres is equal
to 0.6. (Comptes Rendus, cir, 1010.)

Austrium, a new Hlement.—Dr. EB. Linnemann, professor of chemistry
at Prague, died in April, 1886. Among his papers was found a letter
addressed to the Vienna Academy of Sciences, announcing the discov-
ery of a new element, which he called austrium, Aus. Dr. Linnemann
obtained the new metal from orthite of Arendal; its spectrum shows
two violet lines; the wave lengths were found to be, for Aus. a, A = 416.5,
and for Aus. 6, A=403.0. Prof. F. Lippich, of Prague, who presented
Dr. Linnemann’s paper to the Vienna Academy, called attention to
the fact that three not yet identified lines (A=415,.56, A=416.08, and
A=416.47) are shown in Angstrém’s atlas of the normal spectrum of
the sun in the neighborhood of the Aus, @ line; the last of them might
CHEMISTRY. 395

be supposed to be coincident with the Aus. a line (A=416.5). (Nature,
XXXIV, 59, 1886.)

Germanium, a new Element, by Clemens Winkler.—In the summer of
1835 a rich silver ore of uncommon appearance was found in the Him-
melfuerst mine near Freiberg. It was recognized as a new mineral
species by Prof. A. Weisbach, and named by him “argyrodite.” Th.
Richter subjected the mineral to a preliminary examination with the
blow-pipe, and found it to consist essentially of silver and sulphur. In
_addition to these, he also detected the presence of a small quantity of
mercury, which is remarkable and interesting from the fact that this
metal had never before been found in the Freiberg ores.

In the analyses made, Winkler found that the mereury did not amount’
to more than 0.21 percent. According tothe purity of the material the
silver varied from 73 to 75 per cent., and the sulphur from 17 to 18 per
cent. Small quantities of iron and traces of arsenic were also found.
Though the analysis was often and carefully repeated there was always
a loss of 6 to 7 per cent. without it being possible by the ordinary
methods of qualitative analysis to discover the missing body.

After several weeks of tedious search Winkler found that argyrodite
contains a new element, very similar to antimony, but still very distinct
from the same, which he named Germanium. The detection of this ele-
ment was very difficult, because the argyrodite was accompanied by
minerals containing arsenic and antimony, which, on account of their ~
similar behavior, and a total jagk of a sharp Ls for separation,
caused much difficulty.

Argyrodite, when heated with exclusion of air, preferably in a current
of hydrogen, gives a black, crystalline, quite volatile, readily fusible
sublimate, which melts to reddish-brown drops. In addition to mercury
sulphite it consists essentially of germanium sulphide. Germanium sul-
phide is a sulpho-acid ; it is readily soluble in ammonium sulphide, and
when reprecipitated by hydrochloric acid, in a perfectly pure plate, it
forms a snow-white precipitate, which is instantly soluble in ammonium
hydrate. In the presence of antimony or arsenic the precipitate is
always tinged more or less yellow.

On heating in a current of air or in nitric acid, germanium sulphide
is converted into a white oxide, which is not volatile at a red heat. It
is soluble in potassium hydrate, and the alkaline solution, when acidified
with sulphuretted hydrogen, gives the characteristic white precipitate.
Too great dilution prevents or retards the precipitation.

The oxide, like the sulphide, is reduced by hydrogen, the latter with
greater difficulty on account of its volatility. The element has a gray
color, and perfect metallic luster. It melts at a point somewhat below
silver, say about 900°, and erystallizes in octahedra, which are very
brittle. Its specific gravity is 5,469 at 209.4. It is insoluble in hydro-
chloric acid, readily dissolved by aqua-regia, is converted into a white
396 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

oxide by nitric acid and into a soluble sulphate by concentrated sul-
phuric acid. Its atomic weight is 72.32, and it proves to be Mendele-
jeff’s ekasilicium. It forms two oxides, GeO and GeO», two correspond-
ing sulphides, and two chlorides, both of which are thin colorless fuming
liquids. (J. Prakt. Chem., 1886, passim.)

Atomic Weight of Antimony.—Alfred Popper, of the University of
Graz, has made very careful determinations of the atomic weight of
antimony, and obtains a mean of 120.69, which is an entire unit more
than J. P. Cooke’s result, 119.60. He can find no source of error either
in Cooke’s determinations or in his own, and suggests that the possible
presence of germanium may solve the question. (Ann. Chem., CCXXXJ1.)

On some Probable New Elements, by Alexander Pringle.—The author
states that he obtained the material on which he worked from his own
landed property, situated upon the river Tweed, county of Selkirk,
Seotland. He examined some gravel and other material forming the
débris of an ancient glacier, which he “imagines” to be the ancient
soil of the very ancient mountains in that geologic formation. He de-
scribes more or less fully no less than six probable new elements;
polymnestum is a metal of rather dark color, with an equivalent of
about 74, and forming four oxides of various colors; erebodiwm is as
black as charcoal and has an equivalent of 95.4; gadenium has an equiv-
alent of 43.6 and forms two oxides ; hesperisium is a non-metallic ele-
ment having an equivalent of 45.2, and a red color and a metallic luster
like a sunset sky. Two other nameless elements are briefly claimed by

he author. (Chem. News, LIV, j67.)
t
Dysprosium, a new Element, by Lecog de Boisbaudran.—In October,

1878, Delafontaine announced a new earth, which he called philippium,
but early in 1880 he recognized that it was identical with holmium,
previously studied by Soret and by Cleve. Later in the same year,
however, Delafontaine abandoned this view, because he determined that
philippium had no absorption spectra. Leeoq de Boisbaudran has sue-
ceeded by several hundred fractional treatments in separating holmium
into two bodies, for the first of which he proposes to preserve the name
holmium, and the second he names dysprosium (dvezpéc:ros = hard to
getat). The new holmium has for characteristic absorption bands 640.4
and 536.3, and the bands of dysprosium are 753 and 451.5. The author
has encountered extraordinary difficulties in the separation of holmium,
erbium, terbium, and dysprosium, and the scarcity of material greatly
retards the laborious investigation. (Comptes Rendus, cir, 1003 and
1005.)

New Elements in Gadolinite and Samarskite detected Spectroscopically,
by William Crookes.—Finding that Lecoq de Boisbaudran is pursuing
the spectroscopic study of the rare earths in the same track as himself,
CHEMISTRY. out

and publishing notes of phenomena already known to Mr. Crookes, the
latter gives in this paper a preliminary notice and summary of his
studies, although in an unfinished state. Mr. Crookes holds with other
chemists the opinion that didymium is not a simple body, but has been
unable to split it up into the green praseodymium and rose-red neo-
dymium announced in 1885 by Dr. Auer von Welsbach. Mr, Crookes
thinks didymium will prove to be more complex than this indicates.

The author, referring to his note-book under date March 3, 1886, finds
the statement that the “big blue line (A 451.5) is still unclaimed,” and
this blue line proves to be characteristic of dysprosium discovered by
Lecoqg de Boisbaudran.

As a result of the spectroscopic examination of the fractionated
earths fromsamarskite and from gadolinite the author concludes that the
earth hitherto called yttria is a highly complex body, capable of being
dissociated into several simpler substances, each of which gives a phos.
phorescent spectrum of great simplicity, consisting, for the most part,
of only one line. The author admits that a hitherto unrecognized band
in the spectrum, by absorption or phosphorescence, is not of itself defi-
nite proof of a new element, but if supported by chemical facts, such
as he details, there is sufficient prima facie evidence that a new element
is present. Until, however, the new earths are separated in sufficient
purity to enable their atomic weights to be approximately determined,
and their chemical and physical properties observed, Mr. Crookes thinks
it prudent to regard them as elements on probation. He gives in tab-
ular form a list of these probationary elements, designating them by
the initial letters of the minerals (or bodies) didymium, samarskite,
and gadolinite, from which they are respectively derived, and by the
addition to the initials of Greek ietters. The table also gives the mean
wave lengths of absorption lines in the phosphorescent spectra, and
other data.

Concerning the ‘‘radiant-matter test ” for these phosphorescing bodies
Mr. Crookes says it proves itself every day more and more valuable as
one of the most far-searching and trustworthy tools ever placed in the
hands of the experimental chemist. It is an exquisitely delicate test,
capable of being applied to bodies which have been approximately sep-
arated, but not yet completely isolated, by chemical means; its delicacy
is unsurpassed even in the region of spectrum analysis; its economy
is great inasmuch as the test involves no destruction of the specimen;
its convenience is such that any given test is always available for
future reference, and the quantity of material is limited solely by the
power of the human eye to see the body under examination. Beyond
all these in importance is its trustworthiness, and during the five years
this test has been in daily use in his laboratory Mr. Crookes has found it
well-nigh infallible. Anomaliesand apparent contradictions have arisen,
but a little more experiment has shown that the anomalies were but
finger-posts pointing to fresh paths of discovery, and the contradictions
were due to erroneous interpretation of the facts. (Chem. News, Ltvy,
13.)

On the Atomic Weight of the Oxide of Gadolinium, by A. E. Norden-
skjgld.—The author signifies by “oxide of gadolinium” the mixture
of oxides of yttrium, erbium, and ytterbium first discovered in the
gadolinite of Ytterby. Heshows that this mixture of three isomorphous
oxides, even when derived from totally different minerals found in local-
ities far apart from one another, possesses a constant atomic weight, viz,
about 262. The atomic weights of the three constituents vary greatly—

taking O=16 and calculating as R,O3.

The fact here demonstrated is one altogether new in chemistry and
confirms in a remarkable way the views announced by William Crookes
in his address to the B. A. A. S. on the genesis of the elements. It
would appear that the work of these savants on the rare earths, so called,
will result in revolutionizing views of chemists concerning the elements,
so called. (Comptes Rendus, cr, 795.)

Isolation of Fluorine by Electrolysis of Anhydrous Hydrofluorie Acid,
by H. Moissan.—The preparation of fluorine in its elementary state is
a problem which has long defied the efforts of chemists; the classical
experiments of Davy, Gore, G. J. Knox, Pfaundler, Baudrimont, and
others did not yield results satisfactory to all, and the alleged discovery
of Prat was soon after experimentally refuted by Cillis. At the meeting
of the French Academy of Sciences, held June 28, Monsieur H. Moissan
described the results obtained by electrolyzing anhydrous hydrofluoric
acid, and cautiously stated that fluorine was in all probability isolated ;
this memoir was followed by another on July 19, and soon after by a
CHEMISTRY. 399

third, which finally removed all doubts as to the nature of the gas
separated in the experiments.

Moissan prepared anhydrous hydrofluoric acid after the method of
Frémy, taking great precautions to eliminate water. This acid was
placed in a platinum U-tube, cooled to —50° C. and submitted to the
action of an electric current from fifty Bunsen cells. Under these con-
ditions hydrogen was set free at the negative pole, and at the positive
pole a gas was obtained in a continuous current and having the follow-
ing properties: In the presence of mercury it is completely absorbed,
with formation of mercury fluoride of a light yellow color; the gas
decomposes water, liberating ozone; phosphorus is ignited by it; sul-
phur is heated, melting rapidly ; carbon seems to be without action;
melted potassium chloride is attacked with an escape of chlorine ; erys-
talline silicon, purified by treatment with nitric and hydrofluoric acids,
takes fire in contact with this gas and burns brilliantly, forming silicon
fluoride. The electrode of platin-iridium forming the positive pole is
strongly corroded, while that of the negative pole is untouched.

Moissan pointed out that the simplest explanation of these reactions
is that they are due to elementary fluorine, but he deferred decision
until he could show that the phenomena were not due to hydrogen per-
fluoride or to a mixture of ozone and kydrofluorie acid.

In the second memoir Moissan details the precautions observed in pre-
paring the anhydrous hydrofluoric acid and gives additional data con-
cerning the behavior of the gas. The anhydrous acid is made by heating
to redness in a platinum vessel very carefully dried double fluoride of
potassium and hydrogen (HF KF), the liquid being condensed in a re-
ceiver cooled with a mixture of ice and salt. The anhydrous acid boils
at 199.5, is very hygroscopic, and fumes abundantly in moist air. For
electrolysis the acid was cooled with chloride of methyl to —23°, and a
current of twenty Bunsen cells sufficed. Absolutely anhydrous hydro-
fluoric acid will not conduct electricity, therefore a small quantity of
fused double fluoride of potassium\and hydrogen is added.

The gas liberated at the pace ele not only attacks silicon in the
cold, but adamantine boron as well.

Sulphur takes fire in the gas, as do arsenic and antimony. The
metals are attacked with less energy ; organic bodies, however, are vio-
lently attacked; alcohol, ether, benzene, petroleum, etc., take fire on
contact. :

When the experiment has lasted several hours and the gases are no
longer separated by liquid hydrofluorie acid in the bend of the tube,
the gases H and F recombine in the cold with violent detonation.

In the third memoir the author shows that the same gas can be ob-
tained by the electrolysis of carefully dried and fused double fluoride
of hydrogen and potassium. The temperature maintained is 110°.
He also describes experiments showing conclusively that the gas in
question is free fluorine; under certain conditions the gas was absorbed
406 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

by a weighed amount of iron, and a weight of iron fluoride was obtained
sensibly corresponding to the weight of the hydrogen liberated.

The isolation of fluorine by M. Moissan was regarded by the French
Academy of Sciences as of such prime importance that the subject was
referred to a committee for examination. This committee reported
through its chairman, M. Debray (on the 8th of November), that they
found Moissan’s experiments and statements satisfactory in all respects,
and that the isolation of the element was undoubtedly an accomplished
fact. (Comptes Rendus, ci, 1543, c111, 202, 256, and 8590.)

A New Gaseous Body, Phosphorus Oxyfluoride, by H. Moissan.—The
new compound PF;O, has an experimental density, which oscillates
between 3.68 and 3.75. It is instantly absorbed by anhydrous alcohol,
by solutions of chromic acid, or by the alkalies. ‘The existence of this
compound renders impossible the experiment indicated by Davy, who
proposed to isolate fluorine by burning phosphorus fluoride in an at-
mosphere of oxygen inclosed in a vessel of fluor-spar. Fluorine has the
curious property of tending always to form ternary or quaternary addi-
tion products. (Comptes Rendus, cit, May 31, 1886.)

The Combustion of Carbonic Oxide and Hydrogen, by Harold B. Dixon.—
The author in 1880 published the fact that a mixture of carefully dried
carbonic oxide and oxygen would not explode when electric sparks were
passed through it, but that by the addition of a minute trace of water
or volatile body containing hydrogen the mixture became inflammable.
To account for this fact the author has more recently put forward the
hypothesis that the steam acts as the part of a carrier of oxygen, and
that it undergoes reduction and successive re-formation. Discussion
has arisen* as to the mode in which steam exerts its influence, and the
author herein gives his reasons for maintaining his hypothesis.

Experiments were made with small quantities of various gases added
to the non-inflammable mixture of dry carbon monoxide and oxygen, and
the electric spark passed. In all cases where a gas containing hydrogen
was introduced the mixture exploded; otherwise, not. Steam, therefore,
and bodies which form steam under the conditions of the experiment,
are alone able to determine the explosion, and it is evident that steam
does not act as a mere third body, but in virtue of its own peculiar
chemical properties.

Moritz Traube rejected Mr. Dixon’s explanation of the phenomena
under consideration, claiming that carbon monoxide does not decom-
pose steam at high temperatures, but the author shows that it has been
amply proved by different experiments, notably by Naumann and Pistor
(Berichte d. chem. Ges., 1885, 2894) that the re-action mentioned does
take place. Mr. Dixon also gives experimental data for refuting Traube’s
view that hydrogen peroxide acts as the carrier of oxygen.

*See Report on Chemistry in Smithsonian Report for 1885, p. 651.
CHEMISTRY. AOL

In a note following Mr. Dixon’s paper, Professor Armstrong suggests
that in a mixture of carbon monoxide and oxygen, the former is oxidized
and the latter hydrogenized simultaneously by the steam present, a
view which Mr. Dixon remarks is not opposed to any of the observed
facts. The explanation offered by Professor Armstrong involves the
simultaneous occurrence of two re-actions, which Mr. Dixon regards as
taking place successively. (J. Chem. Soc. [London], 1886, 94.)

On the Combustion of Cyanogen, by Harold B. Dixon.—The author has
examined the conditions under which a mixture of cyanogen and oxygen
gases explodes, and comes to the conclusion that the explosion depends
solely upon the nature of the spark itself. The spark from a Holtz
machine failed entirely to explode dry mixtures of these gases. The
jnduction spark failed to explode the mixture in the eudiometer, where
the wires were 0.25 to 1™™ apart; but the explosion was violent in the
tubes when the wires were 1 to 3™™ apart, and this was the case where the
gases were moist. He then compared the explosion rate of this mixture
with that of carbon monoxide and oxygen, using for the purpose a tube
10 feet long and recording the time on a pendulum chronograph. The
velocities obtained were as follows in meters per second: Cyanogen and
oxygen, dried with phosphoric anhydride, 813; dried with KHO,
808; saturated with moisture at 15° C., 752. Carbon monoxide and
_ oxygen dried with phosphoric anhydride, 36; dried with H,SO,, 119;
saturated with moisture at 10° C., 175; at 35° C., 244; and at 60°, 517.
It is notable that in the latter case the rate of explosion increases
rapidly by the addition of moisture, while with the cyanogen moisture
produces an opposite effect. When a platinum wire is heated to dull
redness in the mixture of cyanogen and oxygen, the coil cooled Without
result when the circuit was opened; but when raised to full redness it
glowed brightly for half a minute after the current was broken, and
orange fumes appeared in the tube. On opening the tube it was found
that about three-fourths of the cyanogen had been converted into car-
bon dioxide, and one-fourth into carbon monoxide. (J. Chem. Soc.,
XLIX, 384.)

Preparation of Hydrogen Dioxide, by James Kennedy.—The author
points out the difficulty of removing the barium chloride by means of
silver sulphate when preparing hydrogen dioxide by Regnault’s method,
and the uncertainties of Fownes’s method, and proposes the following,
for which he claims simplicity and economy.

Place any convenient quantity of tribasic phosphoric acid in a shal-
low porcelain vessel immersed in a freezing mixture (ice and salt), and
when the temperature has fallen to 40° F. or below, saturate with per-
oxide of barium previonsiy made into moderately thick paste with dis-
tilled water; when completely saturated filter through pure filter paper.

Certain wine are to be observed in this process in order to in-

sure success. The use of a shallow vessel to allow a large contact surface
with the freezing mixture; the BaO, must be added very slowly to pre-
vent too great arise in temperature, and stirred constantly. The BaO,
should be added until the mixture shows a slight alkaline reaction to
insure the complete precipitation of BaHPO,, as this compound is solu-
ble in acids. The solution is freed from dissolved barium by addition
of diluted sulphuric acid, and the insoluble precipitate removed by fil-
tration.

In order to prevent the decomposition of the H,O,, the temperature
should not be allowed to rise above 40° or 45° Ff. The reaction in this
process is explained in the following equation: BaO,4+ H,PO,=BaHPO,
+H,0,.

The solution obtained is sufficiently concentrated for most purposes to
which it is applied, and is much stronger than much of that found in
commerce. (Pharm. News, VI, 148.)

Hydrogen Peroxide and its Estimation, by Maurice de Thierry. —Since
its discovery by Thénard in 1818, hydrogen peroxide has remained a
mere chemical curiosity, but it has recently acquired industrial impor-
tance. It is now used not only for restoring blackened oil paintings, but
a large quantity is consumed in bleaching ostrich feathers, silk, and hair.
When pure, peroxide of hydrogen has a density of 1.454, but the com-
mercial product is much weaker; its activity being dependent on its con-
centration the author has devised a method for determining the value
of samples. The method is based on the decomposition by manganese >
dioxide and is conveniently carried out by means of the simple appara-
tus figured in the original memoir. (Comptes Rendus, ctl, 611.)

Hydrates of Sulphuric Acid.—At the January meeting of the Russian
Chemical Society Professor Mendelejeff communicated some results of
his investigations into the thermic effects of dilution of sulphuric acid
with water. The maximum evolution of heat, and the maximum contrac-
tion of 100 parts of the solution both correspond to the solution contain-
ing from 65 to 75 per cent. of H,SO,, which is very near the hydrate
H,SO,=S(OH),;. Together with some other observations this leads the
author to the conclusion that there exist at least five more or less con-
stant hydrates of sulphuric acid, viz, H,SO,, H,SO;, HeSO,;, and two
more containing a large amount of water, as H.SO,+100 HO. (Nature,
XXXII, 591.)

Decomposition of Ammonia by Electrolysis, by the Rev. A. Irving.—
The author electrolyzes a concentrated solution of sodium chloride,
with which is mixed about one-tenth its volume of the strongest solu-
tion of ammonia. The solution is placed in an ordinary three-tubed
voltameter of Hofmann’s form, into which carbon pencils are introduced
(with the aid of corks), to obviate the action of nascent chlorine on plati-
num were this metal used for the electrodes, With four to six Bunsen

erated in the separate tubes in a few minutes. The re-action may be
thus represented :

The HCl is of course fixed by the free ammonia. The experiment is
suitable for the lecture table. (Chem. News, LIv, 16.)

Electrolytic Aluminium.—L. Senet has devised a new process for ob-
taining aluminium, as well as copper, silver, etc., by electrolysis. He
exposes a saturated solution of sulphate of alumina, separated from a
solution of chloride of sodium by a porous vessel, to a current of 6 or
7 volts and 4 amperes. The double chloride of aluminium and sodium
is decomposed, and the aluminium is deposited upon the negative elec-
trode. (Cosmos, August 10, 1885.)

Researches on Titanium and its Compounds, by Otto Freiherr von der
Pfordten—First Part.—The results of this oe investigation are
thus summarized by the author:

(1) Pure sulphuretted hydrogen can be prepared by drying the gas
over phosphorus pentoxide and passing it through chromous chloride,
which removes the oxygen.

(2) The hydrogen evolved in the usual way by zine and acid contains
no oxygen.

(3) With titanium and some other elements having a great affinity
for oxygen the sulphides can best be obtained by the action of sul-
phuretted hydrogen on the chloride. The action of sulphuretted hy-
drogen on the oxide does not give pure products.

(4) At alow temperature sulphuretted hydrogen reduces tetrachlo.
ride of titanium to the dichloride, and at a higher temperature another
compound forms, probably a sulpho-chloride.

(5) On the other hand, at a red heat, a pure crystalline disulphide is
_ obtained, derived trom the product first formed.

(6) Disulphide of titanium is oxidized by carbonic acid gas free from
oxygen. (The only known case of a metallic sulphide decomposing
carbon dioxide.)

(7) Disulphide of titanium in nitrogen is changed to sesquisulphide.
Hydrogen effects the same at a high heat in glass.

(8) The same is reduced by hydrogen in a highly-heated platinum
tube to monosulphide,

(9) The properties of thé three sulphides are fully described and
compared. (Am. Chem., CCXXXIV, 257.)

Occurrence of Titanium in Hruptive Rocks and Clays.—The work done
in the division of chemistry and physics of the U. 8. Geological Survey
during the year 188485 forms Bulletin No. 27 of the series issued by
the Survey. The chemical papers include one on topaz from Stoneham,
Maine, by F. W. Clarke, the chief chemist, a method of separating
titanium and aluminium, by F. A. Gooch, a method of filtration, by the
same author, and a number of miscellaneous analyses of minerals,
rocks, soils, ores, and water. Analyses of several eruptive rocks and
of clays show a considerable percentage of titanium:

A New Oxide of Zirconium and its Utility in the Determination of this
Element, Bailey.—By the action of hydrogen peroxide on zirconium
sulphate the author obtained a white bulky precipitate, which proved to
have the formula Zr,O;. This is a perfectly stable and definite body,
less readily soluble in dilute sulphuric acid than ZrO,, and of positive
utility in analytical determinations. Hydrogen peroxide does not pre-
cipitate iron, aluminium, titanium, niobium, tantalum, tin, nor silicon,
and the zirconium can be separated from all or any of these. With a
moderately concentrated solution of hydrogen peroxide the precipita-
tion is complete. (J. Chem. Soc., XLrx, 149.)

Researches on Uranium, by Clemens Zimmermann; Third Paper, pub-
lished after the authors death by George Alibegoff and Gerhard
Kriiss.—A careful examination of the reactions of the oxide of uran-
ium, U,Og,, has led the author to the conclusion that the oxide U,0; of
Péligot is a mixture, and that a body having this composition does not
exist. Péligot’s results were based on the behavior of U;0, when ig-
nited in the air. Zimmermann finds that U,O, ignited in the air loses”
varying quantities of oxygen, but if ignited in an indifferent gas, like N
or CO,, the uranic oxide is gradually and completely converted into UQ).
U,O, is only absolutely stable when ignited in a current of oxygen.
The color of the UO, varies with the method of preparation, and there-
fore can not be used to control its purity.
CHEMISTRY. 405

Determinations of the atomic weight of the element, conducted in
several ways, lead to the value 239.02. (Ann. Chem., CCXXXII, 273.)

New Compounds of Vanadium, by J. T. Brierley.—By mixing a blue
solution of hypovanadium sulphate with a colorless one of an alkaline
metavanadate the author has obtained the following series of new com-
pounds:

A soluble sodinm salt, 2V204, V20O;, 2Na,O + 13H,0.

A soluble potassium salt, 2V205, V20;, 2K.0 + 6H,O.

An insoluble potassium salt, 2V20,4, 4V.0;, 5K.0 + H.0.

A soluble ammonium salt, 2V20,, 2V20;, (NH,)20 + 14H, O.

An insoluble ammonium salt, 2V204, 4V20;, 3(NH4)2 O +6 HO.

The first named crystallizes well in hexagonal plates of considerable
size, and black color. The last named is a precipitate insoluble in hot
rater. (Ann. Chem., CCXXXI, 359.)

Non-existence of Silver Subchloride, by Spencer B. Newbury.—The
author has obtained the product called silver subchloride (Ag,Cl?) by
the three methods of Cavillier, Wetzlar, and Wohler, and after careful
examination and analysis, finds that there is no evidence whatever of
the existence of such a compound, and believes the substances supposed
to be silver subchloride are nothing but simple mixtures of silver and
silver chloride. He also rejects the existence of the silver subcitrate
obtained by Wéhler and von Bibra, claiming that the loss of weight on
heating silver citrate in hydrogen, the formation of carbon dioxide, and
residue of metallic silver indicate the decomposition of citric acid and
separation of silver rather than the formation of silver subcitrate.
(Am. Chem. J., vit, 196.)

On Berthollet’s Fulminating Silver, by F. Raschig.—Although ‘this.
substance was discovered by Berthollet nearly one hundred years ago,
it has not been since closely studied, and its constitution has been un-
certain. Berthollet obtained it by the action of ammonia on silver ox-
ide. Raschig prepares it as follows: A solution of silver nitrate is pre-
cipitated with sodium hydroxide, and the silver oxide is washed by
decantation in the beaker and then transferred to a small flask. For
each gram of silver nitrate used 2 ¢.¢. of an ammonia solution, contain-
ing 25 per cent. of NH;, is added to the oxide, which dissolves easily
with very slight residue. The solution of fulminating silver thus ob-
tained is divided into several portions, and each dish is covered with
a watch glass and allowed to stand sixteen to twenty hours. The
ammonia evaporates, leaving the fulminating silver as a black crystal-
line mass. After washing it was analyzed by digesting with very di-
lute sulphuric acid, which usually leaves a residue of metallic silver.
The dissolved silver was precipitated with hydrochloric acid, and the
ammonia determined in the filtrate as platinic chloride. The results
406 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

of sixteen analyses gave ratios approximating three atoms of silver to
one of nitrogen, which gives the formula NAg;.

The substance was also prepared by warming the ammonia solution
of the silver oxide on a water bath, and by precipitating it with alcohol,
and these samples gave the same results on analysis. Berthollet’s ful-
minating silver explodes with a very slight concussion when dry, and
even when moist must be handled with precaution. The explosive
character of each sample analyzed was determined. It dissolves in
potassium cyanide solution almost immediately, probably giving the re-
action:

NAg; + 3KCy + 3H,0 = NH; + 3KHO 4 dAgCy
(Liebig’s Annalen, CCXXXIII, 93.)

Compounds of the Nitrates of the Alkalies with Nitrate of Silver, by A.
Ditte—The author describes the preparation and characteristics of
the following double salts: AgNO;, KNO;; AgNO;, RbDNO;; NH,NOs,
AgNO;; and shows that with sodium and lithium analogous double
salts are difficult to obtain in definite compounds. No less than twelve
reasons are presented for dividing the alkaline group of metals into two
sections, one embracing K, Rb, Cs, NH,; and the other, Li and Na.
(Ann. Chim. Phys. [6], vir, 418.)

Decomposition of Potassium Chlorate, by Frank L. Teed.—In a previ-
ous paper the author arrived at the conclusion that the decomposition
of potassium chlorate by heat was represented by the equation:

10KCIO; = 6KCIO, + 4KCl1 + 30,

but later experiments lead him to believe that the following is more
nearly correct :
; 22K C10; = 14K ClO, + 8KCI + 50,

A majority of the author’s results fall within the limits calculated
from these two equations. When the clilorate is heated with manganese
dioxide it decomposes apparently without formation of perchlorate.

In the discussion which followed the reading of this paper at the
Chemical Society of London, Dr. Perey Frankland said experiments
made in the South Kensington laboratory had lead to the equation:

S8KCIO; = 5KCI1O,+ 3KCl1 +4 20,
(Chem. News, Litt, 56.)

The Solvay Process of Manufacturing “ Soda.”—In our reports for 1883
and 1884 we chronicled the decline of the Leblane process and the rise .
of the so-called ‘‘ ammonia process” of manufacturing soda; we now
CHEMISTRY. 407

note the establishment of a manufactory of carbonate of soda by the
latter process in the United States.

Solvay & Co. have established extensive works for conducting the
process with which their name is connected in Belgium, France, Ger-
many, Russia, and Austria; and a company of gentlemen, which has
secured the right to work under all the Solvay patents, has erected
works at Geddes, near Syracuse, New York State. These works pro-
.duced in 1885 14,651,500 kilos. of 98 per cent. carbonate of soda, and
the production for 1886, with increased facilities, is estimated to reach
30,000,000 kilos.

The purity of the product is shown by the following analysis of the
brand known as ‘*“' Pure Soda:”

merable uses to which this adjunct of civilization is continually put.

The product of all the works making soda under the Solvay patents
is over 220,000 tons per annum, and new establishments are rising in

Composition of a Crystalline Scale formed in the Ammonia-Soda Process,
by George W. Leighton.—The crystalline scale, formed on the inner
surface of an iron tank, in which vapors consisting of ammonia, carbon
dioxide, and small quantities of hydrogen sulphide are passed through
brine holding in solution the chlorides of sodium, magnesium, and ¢al-
cium, with a small amount of calcium sulphate, has been examined. It
has the appearance of a boiler scale, from one to two inches thick, with
a vitreous luster and greenish-gray color, although sometimes black on
the surface. The scale is usually covered with crystal planes, which
prove to be the terminations of prisms (probably monoclinic). Analysis
gave results corresponding closely to the formula: MgC ’3, Na,CO,,

* NaCl; and impurities consisting chiefly of CaCO;. This is not a mixt-
ure, but an interesting triple salt analogous to some mineral species.

ORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

On the Formation of So called closed Chains, by Prof. Victor Meyer.—
Carbon atoms possess the marked peculiarity of combining to form
molecules in so-called chains, a property giving rise to the multiplicity
408 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

of organic bodies. In stearone no less than thirty-five carbon atoms
unite to form a chain, which may be indicated thus :

H, (ap) O Hy H;

C= ) co C )~

A limit to the extent of open-chain structure can not be predicted,
but the case is very different when closed chains are considered,
While closed chains of three, four, five, and six links or atoms are
numerous, the problem of forming rings having a greater number of
links has been scarcely attacked by chemists. If bodies hke anthracene
and acridine, having double rings of the benzene type, be excepted, only
two substances are known having seven links in the molecular ring.
These are :

C—C—C | A
| | | CO and C—N—N

Cee

H, H, H;, Carbazostyril.
Suberone.

The author has begun the study of the construction of rings having
a number of links greater than six, and some of the results are as fol-
lows:
Sodium sulphide acts on iodide of methylene in accordance with the
equation :
CH2I,4 Na,S=2NaI+CH,S

Bat A. W. Hofmann has shown that the molecular weight of CH.S is
three times as great as thus indicated, and Meyer formulates this as
follows: C;3H,Ss3 or

By a study of the body formed in the re-action

which is an exampleof a closed chain of nine links. Further researches
led the author to the discovery of a body having the following consti-
tution:

H, H, H, H, H, H,
C—C—C—S—C— C—O

which is the first example of a closed chain of twelve links. These
bodies are quite unstable, as indeed might be anticipated from their
complex structure. (Naturwiss. Rundschau, 1, 2, 1886.)

Products of the Manufacture of Gas from Petroleum, by Henry E. Arm-
strong and A. K. Miller.—This paper gives results of an investigation
which the authors have conducted during several years, on the decom-
position and genesis of hydrocarbons at high temperatures; their main
- object has been to throw light on the nature of the changes resulting
from the decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons at high temperatures.
The authors have thus far recognized among the products of the manu-
facture of oil-gas the following hydrocarbons:

(a) Paraffines, only in traces.

(b) Pseudolefines, or saturated hydrocarbons of the series C,H», such
as occur in Russian petroleum ; present in relatively small amount.

(c) Olefines, viz, ethylene, propylene, normal amylene, hexylene, and
heptylene; higher homologues being absent.

(d) Pseudacetylenes, viz, crotonylene (dimethylenethane) and iso-
allylethylene.

(e) Benzenoid hydrocarbons, viz, benzene, toluene, the three isomeric
dimethylbenzenes, the two trimethylbenzenes (pseudocumene and mesi-
tylene), and naphthalene. (J. Chem. Soc. [London], 1886, p. 74.)

Some Organic Substances of High Refractive Power, by H. G. Madan.—
The author finds that naphthyl-phenyl-ketone has a refractive index of
1.666, which is even higher than that of carbon disulphide (1.63). Its .
dispersive power is almost exactly that of carbon disulphide.

Metacinnamene has a refractive index of 1.593; monobromonaphtha-
lene has a refractive index of 1.662, and the author thinks it may prove
a valuable substitute for carbon disulphide for filling prisms, as it is
much less volatile and inflammable. Mr. Madan mentions as a great
desideratum a substance having all the excellent qualities of Canada
balsam—colorless, neutral, permanent in the air, becoming fluid when
moderately heated, but hard and tough when cold, and with a refractive
index of at least 1.66. Such a substance would be invaluable for mount-
ing microscopic objects. (Phil. Mag. [5], xx, 245.)

A Convenient Method of Preparing Organic Compounds of Fluorine, by
O. Wallach.—The author finds that organic bodies containing fluorine
410 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

can be readily obtained by the action of aqueous hydrofluoric acid on
diazoamido compounds. He describes fluorbenzene (CgH;F1) boiling
at 84° to 85°, parafluortoluene boiling at 116° to 117°, fluornitroben-
zene, fluoranilin, and other bodies. It appears that the replacement of
hydrogen by fluorine changes very little the boiling points of the bodies,
but greatly increases tbeir specific gravities. (Ann. Chem., CCXXXV, 255.)

On Platoso-Oxalic Acid, by H. G. Séderbaum.—Doebereiner formerly
obtained, by the action of oxalic acid upon the sodium salt of platinum
dioxide, a salt of a copper-red color, which he regarded as platinous
oxalate. Souchay and Lenssen assign it the formula PtNa,C,0,4+4H,0.
_ This salt has much analogy with the platinum sulphites, since the solu-
tion gives neither the reactions of platinum nor tbose of oxalic acid.
We may therefore regard this compound as the sodium salt of platoso-
oxalic acid, which has been isolated.

The salts of platoso-oxalic acid are very remarkable, because they
occur in isomeric or rather polymeric forms.

For the preparation of the sodium salt sodium chloro-platinate is
heated with an equal weightof sodium hydrate. The residue is treated
with water, which dissolves out sodium chloride, leaving a yellow pow-
der, Na,O, 3PtO.,6H,0. More of it is obtained by the addition of hydro-
chloric acid to the solution of sodium chloride, avoiding excess. It is
washed with cold water and washed with one and a half parts of erys-
talline oxalic acid. Carbonic acid escapes, and there is obtained a solu-
tion of an intense blue color, from which cold slender brown needles of
a metallic luster are deposited. This salt is collected upon a filter and
repeatedly washed with boiling water. There filters first a yellow solu-
tion, then a greenish or blue one, and lastly a solution of a reddish-
brown. From the last Jiquid the mass of the sodium salt is deposited
on cooling, crystallized in capillary needles of a coppery luster. The
first solution after some time deposits lemon-yellow prisms of an isomeric
salt. The intermediate solutions deposit mixtures of the two salts.
Both salts yield with silver nitrate a yellowish-white precipitate of
microscopic crystals of the silver salt of platoso-oxalic acid. On decom-
posing this silver salt with the calculated proportion of hydrochloric
acid we obtain an indigo-blue solution, containing platoso-oxalic acid.
We may obtain the salts of the acid either by the double decomposition
of the sodium salts or by neutralizing the free acid with bases or ecar-
bonates. With the brown sodium salt there are obtained salts of a
brown, greenish, or blue color; but with the yellow salt we obtain iso.
meric yellow or orange salts. The free acid generally gives salts of the
former class, 7%. e., of a dark color, but by repeated crystallizations yellow
salts may be obtained. Several metals belonging to the zine group form —
dark-colored salts most readily ; others, for instance silver, yield yellow
salts, and others again form with equal ease either dark or yellow salts.
The tri- and tetra-atomic metals give both dark and yellow salts, but of
CHEMISTRY. 411

a different composition. The dark salts are in general less soluble;
their density is lower and they often contain a smaller number of mole-
cules of crystalline water. The difference between the two classes of
salts does not depend on the water of crystallization, because both dark
and yellow anhydrous salts have been obtained, and because there exist
both yellow and dark salts containing the same number of molecules of
crystalline water.

The salts of. platoso-oxalic acid are in general sparingly soluble in cold
dilute acids; they are insoluble in alcohol. In hot water some of them
dissolve readily ; others are sparingly soluble. Most of them contain
crystalline water, which they lose in part or entirely at 100°. They
bear the temperature of 110° to 115° (though the ammonium salt is
decomposed at 100°); but a little above this temperature they begin to
decompose. If suddenly heated they are decomposed with detonation.

Platoso-oxalic acid, PtC,O,H,+2H,O, the preparation of which has
been described above, gives, when its solution has been evaporated in
a vacuum, a red crystalline mass of a metallic luster. It dissolves
readily in water with an indigo-blue color, but this color changes to
yellow on heating or diluting with water. Yet the blue color returns on
cooling or on concentration.

There are two potassium salts, a brown one forming copper-colored
needles of specific gravity 3.01, and a yellow one in hexagonal prisms
of specific gravity 3.03. Both contain the same number of molecules
of crystalline water. With the ammonium salts the case is similar.
The dark sodium salt forms slender needles containing 4 molecules of
crystalline water, whilst the yellow salt forms prisms with 5 molecules
of crystalline water. There are three isomeric calcium salts: the brown
one, with 63H,0; the @-yellow salt, with 4H,O, losing one molecule water
at 100°; and the y-yellow salt, with 8H,O, losing at 100°5H,O. There
are also three strontium salts: a, dark, contains 34H.O and loses 4H.,O
at 100°; 4, also dark, contains 63110, and loses 3H2O at 100°; and
Vy S ilow, contains only 3 molecules of crystalline water and undergoes
no change at 100°.

These researches were made in the laboratory of Prof. P. T. Cléve.
(Bull. Soc. Chim., 1886, 188.)

Iodo-aldehyde is obtained by P. Chautard by acting on an aqueous
solution of aldehyde with a mixture of iodic acid and iodine.

Iodo-aldehyde forms an oily, volatile, non-inflammable, colorless,
limpid liquid, blackening rapidly on exposure to light. It decomposes
at 80° C., but in solution may be heated to high temperatures without
change. It acts as a strong caustic, attackinge eyes and respiratory
organs. Its density is 2.14 at 20°, It is soluble in all proportions in
alcohol, ether, benzene, chloroform, etc. It combines readily with ani-
line and other ammonia derivatives. (Comptes Rendus, c1t, 118.)
A412 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Synthesis of Conine, by A. Ladenburg.—Conine, the volatile alkaloid
which forms the poisonous principle of hemlock (contum maculatum),
was discovered in 1827 by Giesecke, but was first obtained in a pure
state in 1831 by Geiger. It has been often studied by chemists, nota-
bly by Ortigosa, Blyth, Wertheim, and Kekulé and von Planta; the
two latter gave it the formula C,H,;N, but itis now known to be C,H,,N.
It forms a colorless, oily liquid of pungent odor, specific gravity = 0.89;
boiling point 166° to 168°. It is easily soluble in alcohol and ether,
sparingly in water, and forms crystalline deliquescent salts. It is an
active poison. This. natural alkaloid has been formed synthetically by
Ladenburginthe manner to be described. HugoSchiff,in 1871, thought
he had effected this synthesis by the action of alcoholic ammonia on
normal butyric aldehyde and subjecting the product to dry distillation,
but the base thus obtained proved to be paraconine, an isomeric form.

Ladenburg’s researches on the pyridine bases had already yielded
him interesting results. The synthesis of piperidine was noted in our
report for the year 1884. On the 25th of February he read a paper be-
fore the German Chemical Society entitled “Experiments on the Syn-
thesis of Conine,” in which he announced the preparation of a base
very closely resembling this alkaloid, and in October be presented de-
tails of this remarkably interesting synthesis, and proofs of the iden-
tity of the artificial and natural substances. The process is as follows:
Paraldehyde and a-picoline are heated for ten hours in closed tubes
to a temperature of 250° to 260°. The allylpyridine thus obtained was
separated from the unchanged picoline, purified and fractioned until it
distilled at 187°.5 to 192°.5. The exact nature of this body was care-
fully established by many tests. The qa allylpyridine was then sub-
mitted in alcoholic solution to the reducing action of sodium, whereby
a-propylpiperidine was obtained. The hydrochloride of this base,
when purified, melted at 203° to 205°, and erystallized in silky-white
needles.

The base separated from this salt boiled at 166° to 167° and proved
to have the greatest resemblance to conine. After a very careful study
of its toxic and optical properties the author satisfied himself of the
absolute identity of tbis dextro—a-propylpiperidine and conine,
C3H;. C;sHi. HN. (Ber. d. chem. Ges., x1x, 439 and 2578.)

New Synthesis of an Inactive Borneol, by J. Bouchardat and J. La-
font.—Berthelot accomplished the synthesis of the camphor of Borneo
by treating camphor with potassium alcoholate, and Baubigny by the
direct addition of hydrogen. The authors effect the transformation of
terebene, or inactive camphene, C,) Hj, through the medium of an organic
acid into an ether of borneol, which by saponification yields a borneol
having no influence on polarized light. With the exception of its in-
active optical properties, the new body is identical with borneol.

Synthesis of Mellitic Acid and of other Benzo-carbonic Acids by Elec-

By the electrolysis of distilled water with electrodes of pure carbon and
a battery having an electromotive force equal to 1,200 Daniells, the
authors obtained a black insoluble deposit (mellogen) and a very acid
liquid which was found to contain mellitic, pyromellitic, hydromellitic,
and hydropyromellitic acids. During the electrolysis carbon monoxide
and dioxide with very little oxygen were evolved. Mellogen purified
by precipitation from the aqueous solution by hydrochloric acid forms
an amorphous, neutral, black, and friable body, insoluble in alcohols
and soluble in water, to which it imparts an intensely black color. Mel-
logen dried at 140° has the composition C,,H,O,, and has some analogy
with Brodie’s graphitic acid ©,,H,O;, but the two bodies are not iden-
tical. Oxidizing agents convert it into benzo-carbonic acids. (Annales
Chim. Phys. [6], v11, 349 and 364.)

Products of the Electrolysis of a Solution of Ammonia with Coke Elec-
trodes, by A. Millot.—A solution of ammonia containing 50 per cent. was
electrolyzed with electrodes of coke purified by chlorine, and the chief
products are an azulmic matter (which the author is still studying), urea,
ammelide, biuret, and guanidine. The urea and guanidine probably
arise from action of nascent carbon dioxide on ammonia with elimina-
tion of water. Biuret is probably formed by the action of carbon diox-
ide on guanidine, and ammelide from the action of this gas upon biuret
with the co-operation of urea. Cyanuric acid was sought but not found.
These results differ from those of Bartoli and Papasogli, who added salt
to the ammoniacal solution to render it a better conductor, and the nas-
cent chlorine resulting destroyed the above-mentioned products.

Identity of Cadaverine with Pentamethylendiamine, by A. Ladenburg.—
Brieger in the course of his remarkabie researches on ptomaines isolated
from a cadaver a base having the formula C;H,,N2, and which he named
cadaverine. This base was also discovered in decomposing’ fish.
Brieger, noting the resemblance in properties between cadaverine and
pentamethylendiamine, sent a small specimen of the former to Laden-
burg for investigation. The latter chemist found the reactions of the
two bodies similar in all respects except in their behavior with mercuric
414 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886,

chloride; but he succeeded in transforming eadaverine into piperidine
by a known process and thus fully established the identity of the two
bodies. (Ber. d. chem. Ges., x1x, 2585.)

Chlorophyll and the Reduction of Carbonic Acid by Plants, by C. Timi-
riazeft.—On subjecting an alcoholic solution of chlorophyll to nascent
hydrogen (by means of zine and acetic acid) the chlorophyll is reduced,
and forms in dilute solutions a straw-yellow substance and in concen-
trated solutions a substance of brown-red color. This substance has a
well defined spectrum, in which the band in the red portion character-
istic of chlorophyll is wanting. The most important property of this
reduced chlorophyll is its rapid oxidation on exposure to air, with re-
production of green chlorophyll. The author terms this new substance
protochlorophylline, or, more briefly, protophylline.

Solutions of protophylline can be preserved only in glass tubes her-
metically sealed. If a solution of protophylline be sealed up in a tube
together with carbonic acid and preserved in total darkness it retains
indefinitely its color and characteristic spectrum, but on exposure to
sunlight the solution turns green. The author remarks that in the
absence of quantitative details he can not claim that this proves the
reduction of carbonic acid by protochlorophylline in the presence of
CHEMISTRY. 415

sunlight, but he can not find any other explanation of the facts. He
thinks that there is evidence of the existence of vrotophylline in living
plants. He also finds that by pushing the reducing action of nascent
hydrogen further another and colorless substance is obtained, which is
now under examination. (Comptes Rendus, CII, 687.)

Acetophenone, a new Hypnotic.—Acetophenone, also called acetylben-
zene, C,H;.CO.CH3;, has been found to possess valuable hypnotic
properties. It is as yet only a laboratory product, but there should be
no great difficulties in manufacturing it on a commercial scale. It is
- commonly obtained by distilling a mixture of calcium benzoate and cal-
cium acetate, though many other methods are named in hand-books. It
forms at ordinary temperatures a clear, colorless liquid, having a per-
sistent characteristic odor; at a lower temperature it forms large flaky
crystals, melting at 209.5 C. Dr. Dujardin-Beaumetz, who has discov-
ered its hypnotic properties, recommends it for simple insomnia, and
says its use is not followed by disagreeable after-symptoms, such as
nausea, headache, etc. He proposes for this substance the trade-name
“hypnone.” (Bull. Générale de Thérapeutique, 1886.)

On Thionaphthenes, by Victor Meyer.—The author states that the first

On Penthiophene and its Derivatives, by Karl Krekeler.—The existence
of a body analogous to thiophene, but having five carbon atoms and
one of sulphur in a closed chain, has been foreseen by Victor Meyer and
others. The author obtained a methyl derivative by acting on a-methyl-
glutaric acid with sulphide of phosphorus, this acid being derived from
leavulinic acid, a substance on which the author has lately experimented
much. The body has the formula

CH,

#-methylpenthiophene.

This substance forms a colorless oily liquid, boiling at 134° C.; its spe-
cific gravity = 0.9938 at 199 C. It gives the Laubenheimer color-test
and otber colored reactions. (Ber. d. chem. Ges., XTx, 3266.)

Thiocumarine and its Derivatives, by Fred. Tiemann.—By the action

This crystallizes in golden needles, easily soluble in alcohol, ether, and
benzene, insoluble in water, and melting at 101°. By reacting on this
body with hydroxylamine he obtained cumaroxime in long white nee-
dles, melting at 131°. In appropriate ways the following compounds
were obtained: Cumaroximethyl ether, dihydrocumaroxime, and a
phenyl-hydrazine derivative of cumarine. (Ber. d. chem. Ges., XIX,
1661.)

Benzoic Sulphinide, or so-called “ Saccharine.”—Dr. Ira Remsen, assisted
by C. Fahlberg, in the year 1879, when engaged in researches originating
with the former, discovered a substance which he named benzoic sulphi-
nide. This body, which may also be called anhydrosulphaminebenz ic
acid, was obtained by the oxidation of orthotoluenesulphamide, and in
the original paper (by R. and F.) 1s thus described: “ Benzoie sulphi-
nide is difficultly soluble in cold water. It is much more soluble in hot
water, and can be obtained in crystalline form from its aaueous solu-

tion. It erystallizes in short, thick prismatic forms, which are not well
developed. Alcohol and ether dissolve it very easily. It fuses at 220°
(uncorr.), but undergoes at the same time partial decomposition. It
possesses u very marked sweet taste, being much sweeter than cane sugar.
The taste is perfectly pure. The minutest quantity of the substance, if
placed upon the tip of the tongue, causes a sensation of pleasant sweet-
ness throughout the entire cavity of the mouth. As stated above, the
substance is soluble only to a slight extent in cold water, but if a few
drops of the cold aqueous solution be placed in an ordinary goblet full
of water, the latter then tastes like the sweetest sirup. Its presence
can hence easily be detected in the dilutest solutions by the taste.
Orthonitrobenzoie acid has this Same property, but the sweetness is by
no means so intense as in the case of benzoic sulphinide.” (Am. Chem.
J., 1, 430.)

On the 2d of February, 1886, Dr. Ivan Lewinstein read a paper before
the Society of Chemical Industry on * Saccharine,” in which he gives
sole credit of the discovery of this sweet substance to Dr. Remsen’s
assistant. The process of preparing it is the same, though he prefers
for it the name benzoyl-sulphonic-imide, or the trade-name “ saccharine.”
The constitution of this body is thus shown;

sa apenee ies
C,H Giggey NH

Dr. Lewinstein gives the following account of the properties and pros-
pective uses of this substance:

Saccharine presents the appearance of a white powder, and erystal-
lizes from its aqueous solution in thick short prisms, which are with
difficulty soluble in cold water, but more easily in warm. Alcohol,
ether, glucose. glycerole, ete., are good solvents of saccharine. It melts
at 200° C., with partial decomposition; its taste in diluted solutions is
intensely sweet, so much so that one part will give a very sweet taste
to 10,000 parts of water. Saccharine forms salts, all of which possess
a powerful saccharine taste; it is endowed with moderately strong an-
tiseptic properties, and is not decomposed in the huinan system, but
eliminated from the body without undergoing any change. It is about
two hundred and thirty times sweeter than the best cane or beet-root
sugar. According to Dr. Stutzser, of Bonn, who has carefully inves-
tigated the physiological properties of this substance, saccharine, taken
into the stomach in the quantities in which it has to be added te food
asa sweetening material, has no injurious effect whatever on the human
system. Stutzser has given to dogs about 5 grams a day, without ob-
serving any ill effects in them, and when we consider that 5 grams are
equal in sweetening power to rather more than 24 pounds of sugar, a
quantity far larger than any one would like to consume in a day, his
view seems amply corroborated by this fact alone; but, in addition to
this, patients suffering from diabetes have now been treated for several
months in one of the principal hospitals in Berlin, as I am informed,
without their feeling the least inconvenience by its use. Physicians
must be glad to find in saccharine a substance, by means of which di-

418 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

abetic persons may enjoy food which has hitherto not been admissible
in their case. Saccharine does not belong to the class of carbohydrates,
and does not possess nutritious properties. The use of saccharine will
therefore, as indicated by its properties, be not merely as a probable
substitute for sugar, but it may even be applied to medicinal purpose
where sugar is not permissible. The inventor was fully aware that in
order to supply a perfect substitute for cane or beet-root sugar, some-
thing else, viz, a similar substance, was needed for confectionery and
similar purposes, besides sweetening properties, and he has also en-
deavored to solve this problem. Dr. Fahlberg combines glucose with
starch sugar, a substance very similar to cane or beet-root sugar, but
inferior to these in sweetening properties, with saccharine, and thus:
obtains a compound which he ealls “ dextro-saccharine,” which, as far
as the taste is concerned, is scarcely distinguishable from the best sugar.
The quantity of saccharine used is in the proportion of one part to from
1,000 to 2,000 parts of glucose. Now, since the price of saccharine is at
present about 50s a pound, we shall find that even at this price such a
mixture would be very considerably cheaper than real sugar, but we
must bear in mind the fact that there is great likelihood of the process
of manufacture of saccharine being considerably cheapened.

It will then be evident not only that saccharine is a most interesting
compound, but that it may also be destined to become an article of pri-
mary commercial importance. The future must decide as to the rev-
olutions it may bring about in the coal-tar industry, in the cultivation
of the soil now devoted to growing canes or beets, and in the sugar in-
dustry generally and other industries connected with it; but as great
and important commercial interests are in question, it is highly advisa-
ble to look well into this matter, and not allow our foreign competitors
in this and other markets to secure for themselves exclusively the ben-
efit which this discovery may confer. There are in commerce small balls
made from starch, to which has been added .05 per cent. of saccharine,
of which one is sufficient to impart a very sweet taste, very similar to
that of the best sugar, to a large cup of black coffee.

Investigations on the Sulphinides, by Dr. Ira Remsen.—The benzoic
sulphinide described in the preceding note has been further studied by
the author. By the substitution of the ethoxyl group for hydrogen
paraethoxybenzoic sulphinide was obtained, crystallizing in fine white
needles, melting at 257° to 258°. This derivative has not the sweet
taste characteristic of the benzoic sulphinide. Another derivative, para-
brombenzoi¢ sulphinide, crystallizing in long needles and subliming in
feathery flakes at about 200°, has aremarkable taste. When first placed
upon the tongue its taste is extremely sweet, fully as much so as that
of benzoic sulphinide, a single small crystal being able to sweeten halt
a liter of water. After the sweet taste has passed an equally bitter taste
takes its place, reminding one in its extreme bitterness of strychnine.
This peculiarity can not be due to the presence of two substances of
different degrees of solubility, since the purest specimens have this
property. (Am. Chem. J., VitI, 223.)

Paranitrobenzoic Sulphinide, etc., by W. A. Noyes.—This body crys-

Para-amidobenzoie sulphinide, on the other hand, has an intensely swect

escence. The author describes its salts with potassium, barium, anil
silver. (Am. Chem. J., VII, 167.)

On Wrightine, by H. Warnecke.—This alkaloid, first isolated by Sten-
house in 1864, from the seeds of Wrightia antidysenterica, an apocyna-
ceous tree from India. It is the first known solid base oceurring in
nature which is free from oxygen. If a trace of this base, dissolved in
chloroform, is evaporated to dryness ina porcelain capsule, the residue
covered with 2 to 3¢.¢. of water and strong sulphuric acid is added ina
slender stream, a golden-yellow color spreads from the bottom of the
capsule through the whole liquid, and turns to a green on standing for
twelve hours. If 1 milligram of the alkaloid is rubbed up in a watch-
glass with five drops of strong sulphuric acid and let stand exposed to
the air for two hours, the liquid which was at first colorless, turns yellow-
ish green and finally a pale violet. Ifthe above mixture is at once ex-
posed in the neck of a flask to the steam of boiling water the mass turns
dark green, and passes into deep blue on contact with a little water.

Chemical Aspects of Future Food Supply.—The chemical section of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science, at the meet-
ing in Buffalo, August, 1886, was numerously attended. The president
of the section, Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, addressed the members on “The
Economical Aspects of Agricultural Chemistry.” His concluding sen-
tences on the Future Food Supply are as follows: ‘Since, with a proper
economy, the natural supplies of potash and phosphoric acid, as we
have seen, may be made to do duty over and over again, and last in-
definitely, the economist who looks to the welfare of the future need
have no fear of the failure of these resources of the growing plant. In-
deed, it may be said that the available quantities of them may be in-
creased by a wise practice of agriculture, based on the teachings
of agricultural chemistry. But with the increase of population comes
an increased demand for food, and therefore the stores of availiable
nitrogen must be enlarged to supply the demands of the increased
agricultural product. It is certain, that with the new analytical
methods, and the new questions raised by the investigations of which
I have spoken, many serics of experiments will be undertaken, the
420 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

outeome of which will definitely settle the question of the entrance
of free nitrogen into vegetable tissues. If this question be answered
affirmatively, agricultural science will not place bounds to the possible
production of foods. If the nitrifying process does go on within the
cells of plants, and if living organisms do fix free nitrogen in the soil in
a form in which at least a portion of it may be nitrified, we may ex-
pect to see the quantities of combined nitrogen increase pari passu
with the needs of plant life. Thus, intensive culture may leave the
gardens and spread over the fields, and the quantities of food suitable
for the sustenance of the human race be enormously increased. In con-
templating the agricultural economies of the future, however, it must not
be forgotten that a certain degree of warmth is as necessary to plant
development as potash, phosphoric acid, and nitrogen. If it be true,
therefore, that the earth is gradually cooling, there may come a time
when a cosmic athermancy may cause the famine which scientific agri-
culture will have prevented. Fortunately however for the human race
the cereals, the best single article of food, are peculiarly suitable to a
cold climate. Barley is cultivated in Iceland, and oatmeal feeds the
best brain and muscle of the world in the high latitudes of Europe. It
is probably true that all life, vegetable and animal, had its origin in the
boreal circumpolar regions. Life has already been pushed half-way to
the equator, and slowly but surely the armies of ice advance their lines.
The march of the human race equatorwards is a forced march, even if it
be no more than a millimeter ina millennium. Some time in the remote
future the last man will reach the equator. There, with the mocking
disk of the sun in the zenith, denying him warmth, flat-headed and
pinched as to every feature, he will gulp his last mite of albuminoids in
his oatmeal, and close his struggle against an indurate hospitality.”

Recent Progress in the Coal-Tar Industry.— Under the above title Sir
Henry E. Roscoe delivered a most valuable and interesting discourse
at the Royal Institution on April 16, 1886. He refers the numerous
products, whether dye-stuifs, perfumes, antipyretic medicines, or sweet
principles to two great classes of hydrocarbons, the paraffinoid and the
benzenoid hydrocarbons. The first is the foundation of the fats, and
the second of the essences or aromatic bodies. Petroleum is the source
of the first class and coal-tar of the second, The following tables give
an interesting view of the marvellous products of coal and their relative
amounts.

Statisties of the Coal-Tar Color Industry.—In a paper on the scientific
development of the coal-tar color industry, by Prof. R. Meldola, before
the Society of Arts, he gives some statistics showing the magnitude of
the industry under discussion. In Germany a factory of about the third
magnitude consumes at present 500 to 600 tons of aniline per annum.
The Badische Company employ twenty-five hundred laborers and offi-
cials, and the Hoechst Color Works (formerly Meister, Lucius & Briin-
ing) employ :ixteen hundred men and fifty-four chemists. In these
large establishments they manufacture not only aniline, but alizarine,
acids, alkalies, and all the necessary chemicals.

The probable consumption of alizarine by British dye-works in 1836
amounted to 6,900 tons (of 10 per cent. paste), of which perhaps 60
per cent. was manufactured in Germany. The author points out that
although historically the industry is indebted to English discoveries,
commercially the control is leaving England for Germany. (Nature,
XXXIV, 324.)

NOTES. S

Gadolinium is the name definitely given by Marignac to the metal Ya,
which he discovered in 1880. The provisional name was abandoned at
the suggestion of Lecoq de Boisbaudran. This is not to be confounded
with the same word as used by Nordenskj¢ld.

The decomposition of chlorine water in sunlightis shown by A. Popper
to yield, besides the usually admitted oxygen and hypochloric acid,
chloric acid itself, and he shows that this was not formed by the treat-
ment to which the liquid was subjected for analytical purposes. (Ann.
Chem., CCXXXI.)

Phosphorus tetroxide, P,O,, has been obtained by Thorpe and Tutton.
It forms when phosphorus is burned in a limited supply of dry air. It
occurs as transpaient, highly lustrous, very deliquescent crystals, which
do not fuse at 100°, and do volatilize at 180°. On solution in water
they form phosphoroso-phosphorie acid, previously discovered by Salzer.
For reactions of this oxide and other details see original paper. (J.

The thickness of the air layer adhering to glass has been carefully
measured by Otto Schumann and found to be somewhat less than
0.000007. O. E. Meyer estimates the diameter of molecules at
0.000000005; the air layer is therefore more than one thousand times
as large as the diameter of molecules. (Wiedemann’s Annalen, XXVII,
91, ’86.)

Attention is called by Arthur G. Bloxam to the solubility of sulphur
in alcohol, a fact not generally noted in text-books. By slowly cooling
a solution of sulphur in hot alcohol he obtained brilliautly transparent
crystals up to half an inch in length, and so white as easily to be mis-
taken for niter. Chemists using rubber corks in distilling alcohol should
bear in mind this solubility of sulphur as a possible source of lnpurity.

Tyrotoxicon is the name given to a highly poisonous ptomaine dis-
covered by Dr. Victor C. Vaughan in cheese. Its occurrence ii: poison-
ous ice-cream has also been demonstrated by Dr. Vaughan, who pre-
sented a paper on the subject to the Michigan State Board of Health,
July 13, 1886.

Lecog de Boisbaudran remarks the fluorescence of manganese sul-
phate when mixed with a large amount of calcium sulphate and subjected
to electrical action ina vacuum. Sulphate of manganese alone does not
fluoresce under these conditions. (Comptes Rendus, CIII, 463.)

Cresium and rubidium nitrites, according to Th. Rosenblatt, form
with cobalt nitrite crystalline double salts, which are the least soluble
compounds of these alkaline metals yet discovered. Czsio cobaltic-
nitrite requires 20,100 parts of water at 17° C., and the rubidium salt
19,800 parts for solution. Thallium forms similar compound. (Ber. d.

The oxides of gold have been critically studied by Gerhard Krtiss, who

Iodine is reported by J. A. Wanklyn to exist in a free state in the
mineral water of the Woodhall Spa, near Lincoln. Sufficient is present
to impart a brown color to the water and to give the usual reaction with

diseases.) (Chem. News, LIv, 300.)

The complete synthesis of pyrrol has been accomplished by Ciamician
and Silber; the steps in the transformation from succinimide to pyrrol
are as follows: Succinimide, bichlormaleinimide, perchloride of tetra-

Combinations of acetamide with metallic chlorides have been described
by G. André, notably with cupric chloride, cadmium chloride, the chlo-
rides of nickel and cobalt, and mercuric chloride. These bodies are

Prof. A. Michaelis, of Aachen, continues his extended researches on
compounds of the elements of the nitrogen group with radicals of the
aromatic series. In Liebig’s Annalen, Vol. CCXXXIII, in union with A.
Reese, he describes several compounds of antimony with phenyl and
its derivatives, and in union with Paetow he describes compounds of
arsenic with benzyl.

Calcined magnesia, Showing peculiar behavior with reagents, is sup-

The mosandra of Dr. J. Lawrence Smith has been examined by Lecoq
de Boisbaudran, samples being furnished by Dr. Marion, of Louisville,
and found to consist chiefly of terbia and Ya. (Chem. News, L111, 163.)

Sozolie acid, or orthoxyphenylsulphurous acid, discovered by M. Ser-
rant, is a more powerful antiseptic than salicylic or phenic acids. The
corresponding para compound has no antiseptic properties. The author
claims for sozolic acid great benefits to medicine and surgery. (Comptes
Rendus, Ci, 1079.)

A summary of all that is known concerning samarium and its com-
pounds has been published by P. T. Cleve, of Upsala, The subject is
treated under the heads history, separation, mode of occurrence, atomic
weight, spectrum, oxides, and the numerous salts. (Chem. News, LIU,
30 et seq.)

Cerium, yttrium, and glucinum, according to Dr. J. H. Strohecker,
occur in extraordinary quantities in the clays of Hainstadt. One of
the clays analyzed contained as high as 13.4 per cent. cerium hydrox-
ide. The author’s analytical methods and his statements have met
severe criticisms on the part of several chemists, but he insists on
their accuracy. (J. f. prakt. Chemie, 1836.)

Glyecyphyllin is a crystalline substance, which Dr. Edward H. Ren-
nie extracted from the leaves of Smilax glycyphylla, a plant common
in New South Wales. Crystallized from water it has the formula
CHEMISTRY. 425

Cy,H2,0,+4$H,O. On boiling with dilute sulphuric acid it decom.
poses into phloretin and isodulcite, and is therefore closely allied to
phlorizin. (J. Chem. Soc., Trans. 1886, 857.)

According to Dr. F. W. Dafert, starch obtained from Panicum candi-
dum yields with iodine a reddish brown color instead of the usual blue
coloration. (Biedermann’s Centralblatt, 1886.)

The formation of ferrates can be conveniently exhibited in a lecture
by a method described by C. L. Bloxam. Place a fragment of potas-
sium hydroxide in a solution of ferric chloride, add a few drops of bro-
mine, and heat gently. The resulting dark brown mass dissolves in
water, yielding a fine red solution, which may be kept many hours
without decomposition. By boiling ferric chloride with bleaching pow-
der a similar red solution of calcium ferrate can be obtained. (Chem.
News, LIv, 43.)

A new alloy of aluminium and tin (100A1: 10Sn), having a specific
gravity of 2.85, is reeommended by M. Bourbowze for all instruments
requiring lightness. It can be soldered as easily as brass, and resists
reagents almost as well as aluminium itself. (Comptes Rendus, C11,
June 7, 1886.)

‘The third annual convention of the Association of Official A gricul-
tural Chemists was held August 26 and 27, in Washington, D. C., under
the presidency of Dr. Harvey W. Wiley. The members adopted official
methods for determining phosphoric acid and moisture and for potash,
but agreed not to select any single method for the determination of
nitrogen as official. Details of the methods adopted and other papers
of value will be found in the proceedings, published as Bulletin 12 of
the Division of Chemistry, Department of Agriculture.

The Berichte of the German Chemical Society in Berlin grows apace;
the volumes for 1885 contain 3,516 pages of contributions and 1,033
pages of abstracts, making a total of 4,549 pages. The society has
ordered for 1886 an edition of 3,600 copies.

The Tokyo Chemical Society (of Japan), organized in 1878 by the
graduates of the Tokyo University, has eighty-six members. The offi-
cers for 1886 are as follows: President, J. Sakurai; vice-presidents, T.
Isono, M. Kuhara, N. Matsui, J. Takayama, G. Nakasawa; secretary,
T. Uyeda; treasurers, T. Isido and T. Takamatsu. The members are
exclusive.y Japanese (uo foreigners). They meet twice a month and
publish a journal in Japanese entitled Tokyo Kagakkai Kaishi, edited
by J. Sakurai. The eighth annual meeting was held April 10, 1886, at
the botanical garden of the Imperial University, Tokyo, and several
interesting addresses and papers were read.

The Chemical Society of London now numbers fourteen hundred and
fifty-nine fellows, thirty-one of these being honorary foreign members.
During the year 188586 one hundred and four papers were read to the
society, a larger number than for several years past. The income for
the year named amounted to £3,743. A subject catalogue of the library

was recently published. The president for the current year is Dr. Hugo
Miiller, Ff. R.S., and the first vice-president is William Crookes, F. B.S

The twelve principal chemical societies of the world have nearly nine
thousand members, distributed as shown in the following table (froin

The centenary of the death of Scheele was commemorated on May 21,
1886, at the little town of Képing, Sweden, where he passed the last
ten years of his life.

The prodigious activity in all departments of science obtaining in
Germany is well illustrated by statistics of the meeting of ‘*‘ deutscher
Naturforscher und Aerzte” held at Berlin in September, 1886. At this
meeting no less than 5,651 persons took part, including 2,224 members,
1,931 associates, 1,496 women. Nearly every quarter of the globe was
represented. North America by 42 persons, Japan by 16, India by 2,
Egypt by 4, Australia by 4, and the Cape of Good Hope by 2. In the 30
sections into which the association is divided 522 lectures and 155
experimental demonstrations were held in 131 sessions. And those in
attendance were invited to join 48 excursions.

The first meeting of this association was held in 1821, in Leipzig, and
was attended by 13 persons; surely small beginnings are not to be
despised.

By Epwarp 8. Dana, Yale College, New Haven, Conn.

GENERAL WORKS ON MINERALOGY.

The list of mineralogical text-books has received an important addi-
tion during the past vear in the Lehrbuch der Mineralogie * of Bauer.
It is a work of nearly six hundred pages, and covers about the same
ground as the mineralogy of Tschermak, noted in the reports of 1884
and 1885. It is especially strong in the chapters on physical mine-
ralogy, and here gives much valuable matter that has not hitherto
found its place into the text-books. The descriptions of species,
though necessarily brief, give all that the ordinary student requires.
A work of great magnitude and importance is the Index der Krys-
tallformen, by Goldschmidt, the first volume of which was completed
in 1886. This work, which, when completed, will make three large
volumes of six hundred pages each, proposes to give complete lists
of all the crystalline forms identified on the crystals of every species,
with the literature, the symbols of different authors, and soon. The
author has started out with the plan of putting this material in the
form which he regards as most useful for a discussion of the mathemat-
ical relations of the forces involved in the making of the crystal.
With this end in view he has developed a new system of symbols, and
adopts a new plan in regard to the choice of the position of a erystal,
taking that one which gives the simplest symbols and lends itself most
readily to the representation of the forms on a plane of projection. This
system of symbols is worked out with admiral thoroughness, both with
respect to the methods of calculation adapted to it, and its relations
to the other systems of symbols which have been employed from the
time of Haiiy down. The unity of the work, therefore, is a prominent
feature, and the details of the plan have evidently been developed with
great care. The practical student of minerals, however, will be in-
clined, at least at first, to regret the introduction of a new series of
symbols, and he will question further whether the reasons given are
sufficient to justify placing the crystals of the majority of the species
in a new position, and in general not the one which is most convenient
for the study of the crystal itself or for its comparison with those of
_ related species. re

450 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

A supplementary volume to the second edition (1875) of Rammels-
berg’s Handbuch der Mineralchemie has recently been issued. It
contains the new analyses of the past ten years with extended calcula-
tions and discussions of composition after the manner of the earlier
volumes. These discussions are always suggestive and often throw
important light upon knotty points of chemical relations; the sugges-
tions in regard to the connection between species, new and old, are often
‘tothe point, but sometimes arbitrary and not sufficiently considered.
The concluding part of vol. rx of the Materialien zur Mineralogie Russ-
lands, by Kokscharow, including the final pages, has been issued. It
contains a new determination of the form of the variety of xanthophyl-
lite called waluewite; a discussion of the forms of topaz based upon
the work of Des Cloizeaux avd N. von Kokscharow, jr., with a large
number of calculated angles; also a description of the new species
mursinskite alluded to on a subsequent page.

The large volume of chemical and geological essays (second series),
by T. Sterry Hunt, entitled Mineral Physiology and Physiography, con-
tains with other interesting matter an extended chapter giving the
author’s views on mineral classification as applied to the silicates. A
third volume of the Mineral Resources of the United States has been
issued, containing, like its predecessors, a large amount of valuable in-
formation for those interested in the mining industries of the country.
A Catalogue of Minerals, giving synonyms and also a brief statement
of composition, has been prepared by A. H. Chester, and will be found
useful by collectors. A work on the diamond (Le Diamant, etc.), by
M. Boutan, forms a volume of Frémy’s Encyclopédie Chimique. It
gives an excellent summary of the subject, with full descriptions of the
diamond diggings of South Africa and Brazil, illustrated by many plates.

The completion of the tenth volume of Groth’s Zeitschrift fiir Krys-
tallographie und Mineralogie is marked by the publication of a gen-
eral index for the ten volumes. This has been expanded so as to be a
very complete repertorium of mineralogical and crystallographic litera-
ture from 1876 to the beginning of 1885. This forms the first two hun-
dred pages of the volume, the index proper making up the remainder.
A new periodical has been commenced in Vienna, entitled Annalen des
k. k. naturhistorischen Hof-museums; it is edited by the director of
the Vienna Museum, Dr. Franz Ritter von Hauer, and in addition to
the reports and notices connected with the museum it contains articles
on subjects in the various branches of the natural sciences.

CRYSTALLOGRAGHY AND PHYSICAL MINERALOGY.

Among the contributions to crystallography, perhaps the first place
belongs to the monograph on stephanite, by Karl Vrba.* This is a
species which has been carefally studied before, and the early deter-

* For references see the list of papers on mineral species on a following page.
MINERALOGY. A451

minations of the elements by Haidinger (1824) and Schroder (1855) have
been accepted as deserving much confidence. Vrba has had the advan-
tages of a larger supply of material and better instrument, and his
measurements are exceptionally precise; it is interesting, however, as
showing the constancy of the species to note that the axes which he
finally accepts are almost identical with those of Schréder and differ
very little from those of Haidinger. Vrba adds a large number of new
forms, and discusses the crystals from different localities minutely as to
occurring planes and angles. The memoir is accompanied by ten plates,
giving a spherical projection for the species, and a large number (49) of
excellent figures.

Pyroxene and the allied species have been the subjects of several val-
uable memoirs. One of these is by Flink on several of the Swedish min-
erals of this group, including a number of varieties of diopside from
Nordmark, also schefferite and rhodonite from Langban and Pajsberg.
These papers are all published together in Groth’s Zeitschrift; some
of them appeared in the Transactions of the Swedish Academy for
-1885—the paper on rhodonite was noticed in the Report for 1885. The
memoir as a whole is admirably complete, giving not only a descrip-
tion of crystalline form with exact measurements, but also a deter-
mipation of the optical characters, and, not Jess important the chemical
composition, since it has been shown that in this group the optical
constants and composition vary together. La Valle has published an-
extended memoir on the Ala diopside, illustrated by numerous figures,
and giving some valuable additions to our knowledge of the form of the
pyroxene from that famous locality. The same author has earlier (1834)
given an account of the polysynthetic twins of diopside from Ala.
Another paper by Gétz gives the results of a study of erystals of diop-
side from several localities, showing a number of new forms. The paper
closes with a convenient list of all observed planes with the author-

ities. The author wisely decides against accepting the new position
for the species suggested by Tschermak, which, though it brings out
the relation to the orthorhombic members of the group somewhat more
clearly, results in giving the majority of the forms very complicated
symbols. Solly has described axinite crystals from Botallack, and in
his paper he has given a list of planes and also a long series of angles.
The euclase from the Austrian Alps has been described by Koéchlin.
The inexhaustible subject of calcite has been discussed by several au-
thors; an extended memoir is given by Cesaro of crystals from Belgian
localities.

Hichstidt bas given a new description of the gadolinite of Hitteré,
with a new determination of the form, and a number of new planes.
The suite of crystals in hand included the best material for the species
ever obtained, and the axial elements seem, therefore, to be worthy of
more confidence than those of Des Cloizeaux, though not differing very
widely from them. The topaz of Durango, Mexico, has proved a fruit-
452 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

ful field for the discovery of new forms. Notwithstanding the large

number of planes already credited to the species, the labors of N. von
Kokscharow, jr., and Des Cloizeaux have resulted in adding many new
ones to the list, some of them of complex symbols. The calculated
angles for all these forms are given in the concluding part of vol. 1x of
the Mineralogie Russlands, already alluded to. Alling has measured
the unusually perfect colorless topaz crystals from Utah and found
them to agree closely in their elements with the Uralian crystals. Des
Cloizeaux has extended his study of the vanadate bearing his name
(descloizite) and proved conclusively on optical grounds that it is ortho-
rhombic, not monoclinic in crystallization. Huntington has investi-
gated the crystalline structure of native iron as shown by cleavage frag-
ments and etched sections of meteorites, and has extended and devel-
oped our knowledge of that important subject.

Several papers have been published devoted to a crystallographic
study of some American species. The phenacite from Florissant, Col-
orado, IS described by Des Cloizeaux with figures representing a new
form. Penfield has described complex crystals of brookite from Magnet
Cove, Arkansas, and the writer of this report has continued the same
subject, showing the unusual variety in form of the crystals from this
locality ; the latter work was based upon the fine suite of crystals in
the collection of Mr. C. S. Bement, of Philadelphia. The Bement col-
lection has also given, in the hands of the writer, material for an ex-
tended memoir on the crystallization of native copper of Lake Superior.
The specimens from this locality are remarkably complex in form, espe-
cially in the twinning groups, and a series of some sixty figures in four
plates were needed to illustrate the different forms. Another paper is
devoted to the crystallization of gold from California and Oregon, and
others to columbite, diaspore, ete.

The minerals from Alexander County, North Carolina, brought to
light by the explorations of W. E. Hidden, have been crystallograph-
ically studied by vom Rath. The monazite has been figured and meas- |
ured, more particularly the nearly symmetrical cruciform twins, with
the orthopinacoid as the twinning plane, also described by Hidden. The
spodumene (hiddenite) has been measured also, and has yielded a con-
siderable number of new planes ; the same is true of the quartz which
has proved to be remarkably rich in interesting points. The locality
has furnished, among other things, a few crystals showing the rare basal
plane as noted by Hidden and Des Cloizeaux. The beryl is, too, excep-
tionally fine in crystallization, and having, as illustrated by vom Rath,
a novelty and complexity of form surpassing the Uralian specimens.
The same author has measured the North Carolina rutile and xenotime.
The vanadinite of Arizona and New Mexico has been shown by Penfield
to be highly complex in form, and to exhibit the pyramidal hemihedrism
of the group with unusual distinctness for this species.

In the broader subject of physical mineralogy a large number of im-
MINERALOGY. 453

portant contributions have been made, but for the most part they are
of such a nature as not to allow of being mentioned briefly—titles are
given on a following page. Among the more popular articles may be
mentioned several on the subject of the specific gravity. Brauns discusses
the use of methyl iodide for petrographic and optical investigations.
Its specific gravity is 3.33; it has a very high index of refraction (1.7424
for Na at 14° C.) and remains unchanged in the air. It can be used in
much the same way as the Thoulet solution for the accurate determina-
tion of the specific gravity, or the separation of different minerals me-
chanically mixed. It has the disadvantage that it can not be diluted
with water, but with benzol, and moreover its specific gravity changes
rather rapidly with change of temperature. A method of obtaining the
specific gravity of small fragments of a mineral applicable, as the
Thoulet solution is not, to minerals of specific gravity over 4, or, on the
other hand, to porous bodies, is described by Joly. It consists briefly in
determining the specific gravity, as by the Thoulet solution, of a little
ball of paraffin in which the mineral fragments have been imbedded
by careful heating; the weight of the paraffin and its specific gravity
are known by previous observations. Goldschmidt has discussed the
degree of accuracy attainable in the different methods of obtaining spe-
cific gravity and thrown some light upon the subject. In one of* his
papers he shows that the temperature-correction may in all ordinary
mineralogical work be neglected, sinee it is considerably less in amount
than the usual errors of observation. He also urges a point, the impor-
tance of which is too little understood, that the apparent wide variation
in the specilic gravity of a given mineral is in most cases due simply to
the use of poor material, or to faulty determinations.

Miigge has made some additions to a subject previously developed
by him: The existence of secondary twinning and the change in position
of crystailine faces due toit; also the production of a twinning structure
by pressure, as in bismuth, antimony, and diopside. This is a method
of especial interest in the case of diopside, since natural crystals often
show twinning lamell parallel to the basal plane, and in consequence
there is often the distinct parting in this direction which was long called
the basal cleavage. Judd has followed out a related line of investiga-
tion in his discussion of what he has called “ schillerization,” that is,
the production of the peculiar, nearly metallic reflection called ‘‘schiller”
by the secondary formation of inclusions in parallel position. He argues
for the existence of planes of easy solubility (“‘solution-planes”) along
which chemical action takes place more readily, as in the formation of
negative crystals. These planes of chemical weakness, he says, have
with the cleavage planes and gliding-planes (Gleitflichen) a definite
relation to the symmetry of the crystal. These solution-planes are
hence connected with the planes of secondary twinning.

An interesting series of papers have been given by Kundt and Blasius,
Mack and Schedtler, on the pyro-electricity of different minerals. The
454 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

paper of Schedtler on tourmaline is especially exhaustive, describing
in detail the methods and results of the investigation. A series of
plates show the remarkable distribution of the electrical condition over
different crystals as exhibited by the arrangement of the red lead and
sulphur powdered over them, after the method first proposed by Kundt.
The subject of the specific heat of minerals has been investigated by
Oberg and by Joly with interesting results. The latter author has
also attempted to determine the relative fusing points of different min-
erals by means of an electrical current in connection with an apparatus
which he calls a meldometer. He proposes some modifications in the
accepted scale of fusibility (von Kobell’s) based upon the results of his
experiments.
CHEMICAL MINERALOGY.

A series of important papers devoted to an investigation of the chem-
ical composition of some American species has been issued by F. W.
Clarke. One of these embraces the group of minerals of Litchfield,
Maine, and more especially the elzolite, cancrinite, and sodalite, with an
alteration product of the latter called hydronephelite, described on a
following page. The results of the analytical work on these minerals
are accompanied by a discussion of their relation to each other, exem-
plified by structural formule. In asecond paper the same author takes
up the lithia micas, and gives the results of much careful chemical
work upon them. Analyses are given of the lepidolite from several
towns in Maine, viz, Rumford, Paris, Hebron, Auburn, and Norway.
They lead to the generally accepted formula Al,LiKF,Si,;0,, and show
a variation in water and fluorine, probably to be explained by a replace-
ment of the latter by hydroxyl. The iron-lithia micas of Cape Ann,
Massachusetts, including the eryophyllite and lepidomelane (annite), are
also investigated and shown to bear an important relation to each other.
Still another paper, by the same author, in this case associated with J.
S. Diller, is devoted to a chemical and microscopical investigation of
the turquoise of New Mexico. Analyses of three distinct types were
made: the bright blue slightly translucent variety, the pale blue, with
slight greenish cast, and the dark green opaque kind. These analy-
ses are compared with others of the Persian and California mineral by
Church and Moore, respectively, and shown to agree as well as could be
expected, considering the nature of the material. The composition is
made out, as expressed by the formula 2A],0;. P,O;. 5H.O, with variable
amounts of a copper salt, 2CuO. P,O;.4H,0. <A detailed description of
the microscopic appearance of the mineral and of the inclosing rock
follows.

Penfield and Harper discuss at length the composition of beryl and
herderite. The former subject had been earlier studied by Penfield
(see report for 1835), with the result of showing that beryl often con-
tains alkalies to an extent not before imagined, and also water of
constitution. The true formula of the species was, however, left in
MINERALOGY. : 455

doubt. These latter analyses go to show that pure beryl conforms
to the commonly accepted formula of the species, except for the water,
which is uniformly present, corresponding in amount to about one-
half molecule, and going off only upon very strong ignition. The
analysis of herderite by the above authors leads to the formula
CaBe(F,OH)PO,, in which the fluorine is partly replaced by hydroxyl,
the mineral yielding water when strongly ignited. In another paper
these authors discuss the composition of the rare octahedral fluoride
from Greenland, called ralstonite. The results go to show that itis a
hydrous fluoride of aluminium, magnesium, and sodium, with, however,
the fluorine in part replaced by hydroxyl. It is free from lime, which
has been found by other analysts, probably because their material was
slightly impure from the presence of a little thomsenolite. The well-
known pseudomorphs of chlorite after garnet from the Lake Superior
iron region and the superficially altered garnets from Salida, Colorado,
have been investigated by Penfield and Sperry.

Doelter has followed out the synthetic line of investigation mentioned.
in the last report and has succeeded in the formation of pyrrhotite. The
formula obtained on the basis of a new analysis of the Schneeberg
pyrrhotite, as also of the artificial compound, is Fe,,S,.. The author ex-
presses himself as opposed to the common idea that the composition is
variable and regards Fe,,S;. as probably correct; this he separates iato
9FeS+Fe.S; or 10FeS+FeS,. Wheeler has contributed some addi-
tional facts in regard to the artificial lead silicate in hexagonal prisms
from Missouri, describing the circumstances of its formation. The
chemical composition of a number of rare minerals, samarskite, gado-
linite, cerite, and others has attracted attention because of the com-
plex character of the metallic earths obtained from them. A number
of new elements have been named, and the spectroscopic investigations
of Crookes, Boisbaudran, and others on the yttrium group have shown
a complexity which the chemical examination had left unexpected.
The subject is especially important in connection with what Crookes
discusses under the “Genesis of the Elements.” In the same line is
the interesting discovery of a new element, Germanium, in- the silver
mineral argyrodite, an element allied to antimony, in some of its prop-
erties, and corresponding closely to eka-silicium in the periodic series of
Mendelejeff. The properties of this element are summarized in the
Journ. fiir prakt. Chemie, XxxIv, 177. Several contributions have been
made to the micro-chemical study of minerals, by Haushofer, Streng,
and Behrens, to which attention is called, though they hardly allow of
being briefly abstracted here.

NEW MINERAL OCCURRENCES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSE-
WHERE.

Among the recent announcements of new mineral occurrences may be
mentioned the rare species percylite from Caracoles, Chili; molybdenite
456 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

in hexagonal crystals, occasionally of great size (2 inches across) in
Canada, in Renfrew County, Ontario; also large dodecahedral garnets up
to nearly 10 pounds in weight at Salida, Colorado; fine crystallized
celestite from Lampasas County, Texas; phenacite from Florissant,
Colorado. Some of the cases aie alluded toin the preceding pages. An
interesting and novel occurrence is that of garnet and topaz in litho-
physes in the rhyolite of Nathrop, Colorado. The lithophyses are more
or less spherical cavities, partially filled by thin curved walls, concentri-
cally arranged, and producing rose-like forms. These cavities contain
minute crystals of sanidine, garnets of the spessartite variety, and
beautiful prismatic crystals of topaz, usually of a pale bluish or wine-
yellow color. This occurrence of topaz in the rhyolite of Nathrop is
shown by Cross to be similar to the occurrence of the same mineral at
Chalk Mountain, Colorado, and of the Thomas range in Utah.

The well known locality in Sharpe’s Township, Alexander County,
North Carolina, developed by W. E. Hidden, has recently yielded some
remarkable mineral specimens. Among these are some very fine emer-
alds, unique in beauty of color, size, and perfection of form. The largest
weighed 9 ounces, and was 3 inches long and 1? in diameter. 'The
emeralds occurred in a pocket extending 20 feet vertically, 4 feet in ex-
treme length, and a foot across. The associated minerals were green
muscovite, rutile, dolomite, monazite, and quartz. Some large erystals
of spodumene (hiddenite) were also found; one of them was 23 inches in
length, and weighed one-half an ounce; its color was in part of the fine
emerald color which makes the mineral prized as a gem.

NEW MINERALS.

Argyrodite—A new ore of silver, exceptionally interesting, as con-
taining a new element, Germanium. It was found in September, 1885,
at the Himmelfiirst mine, near Freiberg, Saxony, and has been named
and described by Weisbach, It occurs in small crystals mostly grouped
in rounded wart-like or reniform aggregates; also in masses with a flat
conchoidal fracture. They belong to the monoclinic system, showing a
prism of 115°, with a clinodome and one prominent hemi-pyramid. The
axial ratio is a: b: ¢ (vert.) = 0.678: 1: 0.614; also #=70°. Twins
and drillings, sometimes in knee-shaped forms, were observed. The
hardness =2.5; specific gravity = 6.10. Luster metallic, color steel-
gray, with a tinge of red, but becoming slightly violet with superficial
tarnish. The composition has been determined by Winkler, who, after
at first finding a loss of 8§ per cent. in the analysis, succeeded in proving
the presence of a new element, to which he gave the name Germanium.
The analysis, when completed, gave:

Ss Ge Ag Fe Zn
17.13 6.93 74.72 0.60 0.22 = 99.60
MINERALOGY. 457

The e.ement germanium is allied to arsenic and antimony, and has an
atomic weight of 72.3 and a specific gravity of 4.7. The formula of the
mineral is written 3Ag,.S.GeS,.

Arnimite. oh spsertivid by Weisbach as a new hydrous sulphate of cop-
per. It was found on the porcelain jasper of Planitz, near Zwickau,
where it has been formed in the course of the burning of a bed of coal.
It forms a green coating, which, under the microscope, is resolved into
short needles or scales. Several analyses were made by Winkler, but
the material was more or less impure, with gypsum, anhydrite, ete.
Moreover, the assumption was made that the loss of 17 per cent. was
to be taken as water. It is evident, therefore, that the composition set-
tled upon is more or less uncertain, namely, Cu;S,.0; +6H,0. This
requires:

SO; CuO 120
24.07 59.69 16.24 =99.81

This mineral seems to be most nearly allied to herrengrundiie, and
Weisbach suggests that the latter may be considered a calcium variety
of arnimite. The name arnimite is given in honor of the von Arnim
family, who for centuries have owned the Planitz coal works.

Arsenolamprite.—Named by Hintze asan independent form of metallic
arsenic. The specimens under examination were from Chili. They cor-
responded in characters with the arsenglanz from Marienberg, long since
described by Breithaupt, and by him also called hypotyphite. Frenzel, in
1874, examined the Saxon mineral, and arrived at the conclusion that it
was probably a distinct species. The specific gravity is 5.3 to 5.5, or
decidedly lower than that of ordinary arsenic (5.7 to 5.8); the hardness
is also Jess. The luster is brilliant metallic, the color lead-gray with a
tinge of blue, the streak black. The structure is foliated with distinct
cleavage in one direction. An analysis yielded 98 per cent. arsenic,
with small quantities of iron and silica in addition.

Bruwiachite—A name given by Macadam to a mineral found at Loch
Bruithaich, Scotland, incrusting barite. It is stated to be clear, beau-
tifully crystalline, with a tendency to a bluish tinge of color and very
friable. It was mentioned by A. Wallace in a brief description of the
Bruithaich locality. An analysis gave

F CaO NazO Fe203 SiOz
10.01 87.04 1.70 0.59 0.54 — 99.88

A further examination is needed.

Caracolite.—Described by Websky as an oxychloride of copper with
sodium sulphate from Caracoles, Chili. It occurs intimately associated
with the rare nineral percylite in colorless crystals aggregated in crusts.
The crystalline form is made out to be orthorhombic, with pseudohexag-
onal symmetry due to twinning. It appears in obtuse hexagonal pyra-
mids, with prism associated. By an examination in polarized light the
458 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR. 1886.

crystals are shown to be compound in nature. The axial ratio obtained
isd: b: e=0.5843:1: 0.4213; the prismatic angle is 1199 24’, An anal-
ysis of the best material available yielded uncertain results because of
the admixture of pereylite. A definite composition is obtained only
after a series of assumptions, which impair the reliability of the result.
The caracolite and percylite are taken as present in about the ratio of
6:1, and the final formula given for the former is PbCIHO+ NaSo,,
which demands:

Pb Na Cl Ss H oO
51.56 11.46 8.84 7.97 0.25 19.92 — 100

In view of the remarkable nature of the compound a further exam-
ination of purer material is needed.

Dognacskaite.—Briefly mentioned by Krenner as a sulphobismuthite
of copper, occurring at Dognacska, in Hungary. It is massive, with a
single perfect cleavage, and becomes gray or brown on exposure to the
air. An analysis by Maderspach yielded S 15.75, Bi 71.79, Cu 12.23. It
is associated with gold, pyrite, chalcocite, and bismite.

Emmonsite.—A ferric tellurite from the neighborhood of Tombstone,
Arizona, named by W. I’. Hillebrand after S. F. Emmons, of the U. S.
Geological Survey. It occurs in translucent crystalline scales of yel-
lowish-green colur imbedded in a hard brownish gangue, consisting of
lead carbonate, quartz, and a brown substance containing the hydrated
oxides of iron and tellurium. The crystallization is regarded as prob-
ably monoclinic; the specific gravity is about 5. The result of several
analyses, after impurities had been deducted, gave:

Te Se Fe H.20
58.75 0.53 14.29 undetermined.

The conclusion reached is that the mineral is a ferric tellurite, but
the formula is doubtful, and it needs further examination, based on purer
material. <A related, but according to Dr. Smith, a distinct species is
his ferrotellurite.

Harstigite—A new silicate of calcium, aluminium, and manganese,
from Pajsberg, Sweden, named and described by G. Flink. It occurs
with garnet ond rhodonite in small prismatic crystals, having a prismatic
angle of 1099 11’.. The axial ratio is, @ : 6 : c=0.7141 : 1: 1.01495; the
habit is something like that of chrysolite. No cleavage was observed.
The hardness is 5.5, the fracture small eonchoidal or splintery, the spe-
cific gravity 3.049, It is colorless, with vitreous luster. The optic axial
plane is parallel to the brachypinacoid, and the axial angle in air is
90° 27’ for yellow light. An analysis yielded:

Hydronephelite—A_ zeolitic mineral derived from the alteration of
sodalite of Litchfield, Maine; it is named and described by Clarke and
Diller. It is found in seams, yielding specimens 2 centimeters in thick-
ness. It is white, lusterless, with the fracture of sodalite. Optical ex-
amination made it probable that it belonged either to the tetragonal or
hexagonal system. The hardness is 4.5. An analysis yielded:

38.90 33.98 0.05 1.01 13.21 13.12 = 100.27
for which the formula HNa,A1;8i,0,.4+3H,0 is caleulated. The formula
requires silica 39.29, alumina 33.41, soda 13.54, water 13.76. It is allied
in composition to thomsonite, but contains soda.

Kainosite (or C ANOSITE).— Described by A. E. Nordenskidld as a new
yttrium mineral and named from the Greek (xaos, unusual) in allusion
to its remarkable composition. The mineral is known thus far only
from a single fragment of a six sided prism from Igeltjern on Hitter6.
It is said to belong to the orthorhombic or monoclinic system, and
shows two unequal cleavages at an angle of 90°. or nearly 90°. The
color is yellow-brown, the hardness 5.5, the specific gravity 3.413, the
fracture subconchoidal. The mean of two analyses gave:

mixed calcite is said to.be proved to be untrue by microscopic exami-
nation.

Kaliophilite—A mineral allied to nephelite described by Mierisch
as occurring in the masses ejected from Mt. Somma, together with au-
gite and melilite. It forms thick prisms or fine thread-like colorless
crystals, probably belonging to the hexagonal system. An optical ex-
amination showed the mineral to be uniaxial with negative double re-
fraction. The cleavage is basal, distinct; itis very brittle. The specific
evravity is 2.602. An analysis yielded:

Si02 Al0,(Fe,0,) Cad K,0 Na,O

of an anhydrous muscovite, and corresponds to nephelite, anorthite,
and eucryptite, which contain sodium, calcium, and lithium, respectively,

in the place of the potassium. The name has reference to the high
percentage of the last-named element.

Lucasite—Another member of the large group of hydrated micas called
vermiculites. It is described by T. M. Chatard, and named after Dr.
H. 8. Lucas, who has been connected with the emery industry of this
country. Itwas found with corundum at Corundum Hill, Macon County,
North Carolina. The physical characters are like the others of the
group. Of the 10.76 per cent. of water contained, 3.78 went off at 110°
C., and 6.98 at ared heat (blast lamp). An analysis (mean of two) of the
substance, dried at 110°, gave:

The ratio of silica to bases to wateris 7: 6: 2.

Mursinskite—Named after the locality by Kokscharow on the basis of
a crystallographic study of two small crystals found thirty-two years
ago at the beryl locality at Alabaschka, near Mursinsk, Ural. It has
not been possible since their discovery to obtain additional material.
The crystals occurred imbedded in the beryl. They belong tothe tetrag-
onal system and show one pyramid prominently, with two subordinate
of the other series, and several zirconoids. The terminal and basal
angles of the fundamental pyramid are respectively 127° 32’ and 77°
233, corresponding with a vertical axis, c=0.56641, The color is white
to honey-yellow, transparent to semi-transparent. Hardness = 5 to 6,
specific gravity uncertain, though a trial on the crystal weighing .O04
gram gave P. v. Nikoiajew 4.149. Nothing is known of the chemical
composition. Kokscharow calls attention to the fact that the pyramidal
angle corresponds nearly with the pyramid $P% of vesuvianite, but
there appears to be no further relation between the species.

Ptilolite.—A new zeolitic mineral described by Cross and Hakins. The
name is from zr¢dov, down, in allusion to the delicate fibrous nature of the
mineral. It is found in cavities of a vesicular augite-andesite, found in
fragments in the conglomerate beds of Green and Table Mountains,
Jefferson County, Colorado. These cavities are in some cases filled with
chalcedony and quartz, or sometimes only lined with chalcedony, and
upon this is deposited the ptilolite in delicate white tufts or spongy
masses, consisting of short hair-like needles loosely aggregated. They
appear to have parallel extinction. An analysis by Eakins gave:

Pyrrhoarsenite.—A new arseniate of manganese described by Igelstrém,
and related to numerous hydrated ar-eniates of manganese, several of
which (polyarsenite, xanthoarsenite, chondroarsenite) have been named
by the same author. It occurs at the Sj6 mines in the Grythyttan
parish, Sweden, forming small veins and masses with tephroite, calcite,
hausmannite, barite. It shows one cleavage, but has not yet been found
in crystals, Optically it is singly refracting for the most part, with oc-
casional anisotropic portions. The hardness is4. The color is a yel-
lowish red (hence the name from zuppoc, fire, t. e., fire-red), resembling
potassium dichromate. It dissolves readily in hydrochiorie and nitric
acids. An analysis yielded:

As20;(Sb20;) MnO CaO MgO SiOe2 Al203, FeO

The formula given is 3(Mn, Ca, Mg)O. As»(Sb.)O;.

Schungite—A name given (1884) by A. von Inostranzeff to a form of
amorphous carbon found in the crystalline schists of Schunga, in the
Olenetzer government, Russia. It is the same substance that was
named graphitoid by Sauer, as noted in the report for 1885.

Stiivenite—A new alum occurring with other related minerals at
the abandoned mine of Alcaparroso, near Copiapo, Chili, described by
Darapsky. It oceurs in slender acicular crystals 2 or 3 inches in length.
An analysis yielded (mean of two):

SO; AlL0, MgO NaO KO #20
So alo) PE 7 Sa 6 AT

corresponding to (Na,, Mg)SO,+Al,S,0,.424H,O. The name is given
after the mining engineer, Enrique Stiiven.

was assistant in the mineral department of the British Museum. He was an ac-
tive worker in chemical mineralogy, and was especially interested in meteorites.
He published a number of papers on these subjects, among others a chapter on
the History of Meteorites, which ran through a number of issues of the Geologi-
cal Magazine.

ARNOLD VON LASAULX.—Born June 14, 1839; died January 25, 1886. He was pri-
vatdocent at the Bonn University in 1868, then professor (ausserordentlicher) of
mineralogy at Breslau, later (1880) full professor at Kiel, and in the same year
made professor at Bonn, where he spent the remainder of his life. He was an
exceptionally active and successful worker in mineralogy and in petrography,
and the list of his original papers in these and allied subjects is along one. He
was the author of two books, Elemente der Petrographie (1875) and Einfiihrung
in die Gesteinslehre (1885). He also extended his researches into the geological
field, writing of earthquakes and volcanic phenomena.

MARTIN WEBSKY.—Born July 17, 1824; died November 27,1886. He was a student
of Weiss at Berlin in 1846, and later studied at Freiberg and Bonn. From 1850
to 1865 he was engaged in practical work in connection. with the mining com-
mission of Silesia, but during this time made many contributions to science.
From 1865 to 1873 he lectured at the Breslau University, and after the death of
Gustav Rose he was called to be his successor at Berlin, where he remained till
his death. He stood conspicuously in the front rank of German mineralogists,
and his contributions are many and of high grade; they are largely ecrystallo-
graphic, dealing with the description of crystallized minerals or with general
theoretical problems of crystallography; he was also a successful analytical
chemist. During his life at Berlin he devoted himself almost exclusively to the
arrangement of the large collection of the university, and his activity in this di-
rection, while perhaps an equal benefit to science in the end, was a great sacrifice
from a personal point of view. His larger works include the well known ‘‘ Die
Mineralspecies nach den fiir das specifische Gewicht derselben angenommenen
und gefundenen Werthen,” which passed through several editions.

CHARLES UPHAM SHEPARD.—Born in’ 1804; died May IF 1886. During the whole of
his long life zealously devoted to mineralogy. He was graduated at Amherst
College in 1824; in 1827 was assistant to Professor Silliman, at New Haven, in
chemistry, mineralogy, and geology; after 1832 he divided his time between New
Haven, Amherst, and Charleston; from 1845 to 1852 and 1861 to 1877 he was pro-
fessor at Amherst, and in 1854 he was made professor of chemistry at Charleston,
continuing his duties there till 1869, except as interrupted by the civil war. He
was an active collector and student of minerals, and science owes to his keen eye
the discovery of many new and interesting species, such as microlite, warwickite,
danburite, as well as the development of many valuable localities. His large
private collection, which became the property of Amberst College, was unfortu-
nately destroyed by fire in 1880, but he continued to collect until his life ended.
He was also active in collecting and describing meteorites, and brought together
one of the largest collections in the country. In addition to many shorter papers,
he was the author of a Treatise on Mineralogy in 1832, and in 1837 he published a
report on the mineralogy and mineral products of Connecticut.

ZOOLOGY IN 1886.

By Prof. THEODORE GILL.

INTRODUCTION.

The progress of zoology during the year 1886 has been in the same
lines as during the preceding years, and with still greater concurrence.
More and more atiention is being paid to histology and embryology and
perhaps at an undue expense to systematic zoology. Systematic zoology
scientifically treated is simply the co-ordination of all facts derived from
every branch of biology, anatomy, embryology, histology, and physiol-
ogy ; but there appears to be a disposition to relegate it to those who con-
sider that its chief aim is to Serve for identification of specimens, or to un-
duly gencralize from a very few embryological facts. Such tendencies
are hurtful to the welfare of zoology, but undoubtedly the tendencies in
those directions will, in due time, be corrected.

As in the previous reports, the language of the original from which
the abstract is compiled is generally followed as closely as the case
will permit. It has however been found necessary to limit the ab-
stract to the illustration of the prominent idea underlying the original
memoir, and pass by the proofs and collateral arguments. At the same
time, it has been often attempted to bring the new discovery into rela-
tion with the previous status of information respecting the group under
consideration. As to the special discoveries recorded, they have been
generally selected (1) on account of the modifications the forms con-
sidered may force on the system; or (2) for the reason that they are or
have been deemed to be of high taxonomic importance; or (3) because
the animals per se are of general interest; or, finally (4), because they
are of special interest to the American naturalist. Of course, zoologists
cultivating limited fields of research will find in omissions cause for
censure, and may urge that discoveries of inferior importance have
been noticed to the exclusion of those better entitled to it. It is freely
admitted that this charge may even be justly made; but the limits
assigned to the record have been much exceeded, and the recorder has
studied the needs of the many rather than of the few. The summary
is intended, not for the advanced scientific student, but for those who
entertain a general interest in zoology or some of the better-known

classes.

The bibliography which has been heretofore given with these reports
is omitted from the present, as it has been thought that the space which
would be occupied by it might be more profitably used for recording
new discoveries. <A partial bibliography is of little or no use to either
the general reader or the investigator. The former rarely looks at it,
and the latter seeks for information in the very full bibliographies or
records of progress that are especially devoted to the subjects in ques-
tion. For the current literature the “ Zoologischer Anzeiger,” published
by W. Engelmann, of Leipzig, is available, and for the past years ‘“‘The
Zoological Record,” hereafter to be published by the Zoological Society
of London, the “ Archiv fiir Naturgeschichte,” published in Berlin, and
the “ Zoologischer Jahresbericht,” also published in Berlin, are indis-
pensable for the working naturalist. The compiler desires to make
special acknowledgment for most material assistance to the Journal of
the Royal Microscopical Society, whose abstracts of investigations have
been freely drawn upon in the preparation of those for the present
report.

GENERAL ZOOLOGY.

Revivification of animals after desiccation.—It has been repeatedly as-
serted, and with but little contradiction, that certain low types of the ani-
mal kingdom are capable of being revived after having been completely
dried up or desiccated. Those who have questioned the statements
have been comparatively unheeded. But the subject has been recently
again investigated, practically, by Professor Zacharias, and it appears
that the dissent expressed. by the few is justified by the new experi-
ments. Near Professor Zacharias’s residence is a large granite block,
which has lain there for two hundred years, having a cavity which
holds from two to three liters of water that evaporates in from two to
six days, according to the weather. In the water resulting from rain,
which is held in this cavity, ‘a characteristic fauna was found to exist,
notwithstanding the periodical desiccation.” A peculiar variety of the
rotifer named Philodina roseola, a tardigrade, and various protozoans
ZOOLOGY. 479

lived therein. ‘Observations made nearly fifty years ago indicate the
presence at that date of a similar fauna, and there is every reason to
believe that at least for a century similar forms have tenanted the cavity.
Thus the fauna has persisted in spite of complete desiccation—thousands
of times repeated. The problem is, How?”

In order to solve this problem, Professor Zacharias instituted a num-
ber of experiments, and found that the Philodina and tardigrade, “ when
allowed to dry, invariably died,” but the ova were preserved from death
by encystation. The persistence of the fauna is therefore not due to
the survival of the adult animals, and their revivification on the reap.
pearance of rain, but to the peculiar character of the eggs, which de-
velop with the returning rain. In fine, Professor Zacharias has been
led most decicedly to the conclusion that the desiccated forms in their
mature condition, always die, while the eggs may frequently survive.
These results are in accordance with those obtained by other experi-
ments, for example the non-revivification of nematoid worms after des-
iccation, as was proved by Hallez. That which is true for animals is
likewise applicable to plants. Thus, according to Professor Zacharias,
the resting stage of Hamatococcus and the zygospore stage of Stepha-
nosphera ‘‘ explain the persistence of these algoid forms in the pool.”
The conclusion is that ‘‘ there is therefore probably no such thing as a
real fauna and flora rediviva.” (Biol. Centralbl., V1, pp. 230-235; J.
R. M.S. (2), Vi, pp. 799-800.)

Minimum life temperatures.—A series of experiments upon various
animals has been made by Dr. H. von [Ihering in extension of Professor
Pouchet’s researches on the resistance which animals may offer to cold.
About twodozen worms, arthropods, and mollusks were made the subject
of investigation. The results have been summarized in the following
terms:

(1) “Lower animals become frozen at temperatures varying greatly
in the different genera and species. The resistance varies with the
actual body heat of the animal, with its size, structure, and protective
covering, with the freezing point of the blood, etc.”

(2) ‘The resistance usually increases with progressive development,
but sometimes the adults are more sensitive than the young.”

(3) “Nothing can be directly inferred from the geographical distribu-
tion.”

(4) ‘Perfectly frozen animals are never revivified.”

Dr. von Jhering suggests a curve, with the degree and the duration
of the temperature as co-ordinates. These two factors must be consid-
ered together. The absolute minimum is obviously the fatal temper-
ature in unit time. He enumerates the various results, as exhibited by
degeneration, cessation of certain functions, sleep, like paralysis, and
death; and sums up his experiments ina tabular survey.” (Zeitschr,
f, Naturwiss., LIx pp. 183-214; J. R. M.S., 1887, vi, p. 52.)
480 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Physiology of the unstriated muscles of invertebrates.—The physiology
of the unstriated muscles of invertebrates has been investigated by Mr.
H. D. Varigny, and, asa result, he came to the conclusion that ‘no essen-
tial difference exists between the unstriated and the striated muscles.
The unstriated muscles, under certain conditions, even surpass the
striated ones from a physiological point of view. In the invertebrata
their role is an important one, for whilst remaining the active agents of
the movements of nutrition, they become the agents of voluntary move-
ments, and in contact with the nerves of voluntary motion derive such an
energy and acquire such a perfect physiological development that they
occupy in the functional hierarchy a superior rank to that of certain
striated muscles, whilst the striated muscle is the most perfect and most
developed contractile agent, and the one whose evolution is most ad-
vanced.” In fine, ‘there is no ground for dividing the physiology of
muscles into two classes,” the differences existing in certain points being
not essential, but of secondary moment only. (J. R.M.S. (2), V, p. 791.)

PROTOZOANS.
General.

A new classification of protozoa.—tIn an article entitled ‘“* Protozoa,”
published in the Encyclopedia Britannica, Prof. E. Ray Lankester has
given his views as to the best mode of grouping all the protozoa, in
which he includes the mycetozoa. He admits no less than thirteen
classes in the sub-kingdom, which he segregates under two groups or
‘‘orades.” The names and relations of the various classes will appear
in the subjoined tabular enumeration :

PORIFER.
Sponges.

The nervous system in sponges.—A. specialized nervous system was
formerly denied to the sponges, and has only been recognized within a
comparatively few years. The last investigator of the subject has been
Dr. R. von Lendenteld. He has especially studied the muscular and
nervous systems in the horny sponges, especially of Australia, and has
formulated his conclusions and deductions therefrom. Premising that
there are certain structures on the distal margin of the muscular mem-
brane, he interprets them as follows: “The whole thickening, which
is interrupted only here and there, consists of ganglion-cells, the nuclei
of which are distinct in preparations, although their contours do not ap-
pear distinctly. The granular threads which are given off from these
ganglia in a tangential direction, are nerves which establish the con-
nection of the ganglia with more distant and at present still unknown
structures.”

From the description given, *‘ it appears that the zone of sense-cells
runs along the upper margin of the muscular membrane, so that two
bands of sense-cells are formed, bordering the tissue filling the groove
at the surtace.”

Dr. von Lendenfeld believes that “this structure may be directly
compared with the annular nerves of cycloneural meduse (Himer), and
indicates that the sponges, being capable of a development similar to
that of those cnidaria, were not probably so very different from them
as we commonly suppose. It must, indeed, be admitted,” says Dr. von
Lendenfeld, ‘‘ that, by convergent development, a resemblance may here
have been produced which does not justify any phylogenetic conclusions,
especially as these structures in the sponges are mesodermal, and not
subepithelial as in the hydromeduse.”

In conclusion, it is said that ‘‘ both the muscle and nerve cells are
mesodermal. The epithelia of the sponges nowhere appear to be further
developed after the fashion of the higher ccelenterata. Both endoderm
and ectoderm always remain single.” (A. and M. Nat. Hist. (5), XvII,
pp. 372-377.)

CGZLENTERATES.

Polyps.

The coral of madrepores in relation to the soft parts—The compre-
hension of the relations of the hard coral to the soft parts of the ani-
mals which excrete it is rather difficult, and has been facilitated by Dr.
G. von Koch in a special memoir upon the subject. The results are
summarized in the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society.

I. The basal plate. ‘‘This is excreted between the aboral terminal sur-
face of the body and the substratum to which the skeleton is attached.”

H. Mis. 600——31
482 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

II. The external plate or epitheca. ‘This is a continuation of the basal
plate, and yet more or less distinctly separable from it. It incloses the
lateral body wall, but does not otherwise come into contact with the
substratum.”

Ill. The internal plate or theca. “This rises from the basal plate in
the form of a circular ridge, usually parallel to the external plate, and
generally ensheathed in an intruding fold of the body wall. There may
be more than one internal plate.”

IV. The radiai plates or septa. ‘These are represented by numerous
radial ridges, which ascend at right angles to the basal plate, and lie in
radial folds of the body wall, which alternate with the parietes (mes-
enteries).”

In further explanation it is also noted:

(a) **The body wall always lies between the external and internal
plates.”

(b) ‘The parietes always lie between two radial plates, and the latter
are, for some distance upwards, always separated by the internal plate
into a peripheral and central portion.”

(c) ‘* The external plate is only clothed with tissue on its inner surface,
but the internal plate on both surfaces.”

(d) ** Where the radial plates come into secondary contact with the
external plate they penetrate the body wall.”

With these postulates, “taken along with the fact that the skeleton
is excreted by the ectoderm, a nymber of important conclusions may
be deduced as to the origin, growth, and structure of the skeleton.”

(1) “All parts of the skeleton are laid down as plates, and their
growth is effected by the apposition of new particles on those already
formed.”

(2) “As to superficial increase, all parts of the skeleton are alike,
but they vary in the mode of their increase in thickness. The thick-
ening of the basal and external plates is only effected from one side,
while that of the internal and radial plates may take place from both.”

(3) “In the basal and external plates, the oldest portions are thus
obviously on the outer side and the newer portions are inwards.”

(4) ‘‘In the internal plate, the oldest portions are on either side, cov-
ered by successive strata, but the growth on either side may be dispro-
portionate.”

(5) “ In the radial plates, the oldest portion is in the middle, and the
subsequent depositions are symmetrically laid down on either side.”

Acalephs.

New form of fresh-water hydroids.—Fresh-water hydroids are so few
in number that any new species is noteworthy, and one has been de-
scribed lately which is further interesting on account of some phases of
ZOOLOGY. 483

its life history. In 1871 Dr. Owsjannikow made known a peculiar par-
asite discovered in the ova of the sturgeon. This parasite proves now
to be simply ‘‘a stage in the development of a free-living hydroid.” It
was made the subject of investigation by Dr. M. Ussow for two years,
and the results of his researches have appeared in a preliminary notice.
The form in question is related to the hydromeduse in general, and
has been named Polypodium hydriforme. The life history of the newly
discovered hydromedusan is divisible into three stages, first, as a par-
asite in the eggs of the sturgeon, Acipenser ruthenus, wherein it exists
as a cylindrical spirally twisted tube, with numerous lateral buds; then
as ‘a free-living form, equipped with 24, 12, or 6 tentacles,” and finally,
“presumably as a sexual animal.”

The first stage, or that of parasitism, is noteworthy. ‘The youngest
specimen observed had the form of a cylindrical hollow tube, 15 to 17™™
in length, 13 to 2™™ in thickness, and superficially beset with primary
buds. The walls consist of single layers of ectoderm and endoderm,
and of spindle-shaped (mesoderm) cells between. As this muscular
laver develops, the body becomes spirally coiled in the longitudinal
axis of the sturgeon’s egg. The primitive buds become pear-shaped
and the axial cavity of the organism is continued into each bud.

“Hach of the primitive buds soon exhibits a gradually deepening
furrow, dividing it into two pear-shaped bodies—the secondary buds.
These are afterwards developed into free-living forms. The secondary
buds come, in consequence of spiral twisting, to lie on one side of the
whole organism (‘stolon’), on that turned towards the chorion of the egg.
The ectoderm cells next the central yolk are filled with yolk granules,
which they have directly ingested. The yolk substance thus acquired
penetrates through the endoderm into the cavity of the buds and aceu-
mulates as reserve material.

“The upper portion of the secondary bud exhibits a shallow furrow,
and represents the aboral end of the future free-living form; and the
furrow extending parallel to the long axis indicates the direction of a
division which results in the halving of the free generation (or ‘mothers’).

“Tentacles are developed as invaginate tubes, and exhibit all the
three layers. Of the twenty-four tentacles, eight are specially differen-
tiated, as short, strong, terminally swollen ‘Senktaster” They exhibit
numerous stinging cells developed in special cnidoblasts. The other
sixteen are symmetrically arranged in pairs on both sides of the bud;
they are thinner and much longer than the other eight. The tentacles
are gradually and irregularly evaginated, the stolon begins to move,
and eventually effects its liberation during spawning.

‘* After being in water for twenty-four hours or so the whole stolon
falls into thirty-two pieces, representing the thirty-two buds; and this
disruption occurs in a perfectly definite fashion. The buds have
changed their form considerably since their first formation, and after
liberation the old stalk and an adjacent portion of the stolon form a
484 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

movable proboscis, at the end of which a mouth-opening eventually
appears. After the disruption of the stolon the individualized buds
seem to be nourished at the expense of the yolk stored up in their cavi-
ties. These cavities, which extend even to the end oféthe tentacles,
may be justly termed gastral cavities.

‘* The liberated mother bud (B), with twenty-four tentacles, is divided
into two daughter forms (B!), with twelve each. These divide and give
rise to two different forms, B* and B*b. The successive multiplication
of the different generations is fully discussed and tabulated, and the
three forms are described.”

In brief, Dr. Ussow regards the Polypodium as “a hydroid organism,
with a motile ‘ trophosome’ (B) passing through various assexual gen-
erations before attaining the sexual (possibly medusoid) form. The
planula of the latter migrates into the ovum” of the sturgeon, and
‘“‘ oradually develops into the stolon, with primary and secondary buds.”

ECHINODERMS.

Pelmatozoans.

Diversity among the blastoids.—The peimatozoans or crinoids, although
comparatively rare at present, were formerly very abundant, and in the
palezoic seas represented by many diverse types. Among the most
singular of these were the blastoids, which have been by most au-
thors regarded as an order of the pelmatozoans, but recently Dr. P.
Herbert Carpenter has contended that the group is separable from the
crinoids asa class. A monograph of the group has been recently pub-
lished by Mr. Robert Etheridge and Dr. P. Herbert Carpenter as a
“‘ catalogue of the blastoidea in the geological department of the British
Museum.” The authors maintain that “the blastoidea constitute a re-
markably compact group, which is pretty clearly marked off from the
other pelmatozoa.” They find that the perforate lancet plate and the
regular limitation of the hydrospires to the radial and the inter-radial
plates, with their slits parallel to the ambulacra, are characters which
are not as yet known to occur in either the crinoidea or the cystidea.
The group thus distinguished is divided by Messrs. Etheridge and
Carpenter into six families, which are segregated under two orders.

One order, the Regulares, includes “ pedunculate blastoids with a
symmetrical base, in which the radials and ambulacra are all equal and
similar.” This group includes four families: (1) Pentremitide, with three
genera, the chief of which is the genus so well known to American
paleontologists under the name Pentremites, and (2) Troostoblastida,
a new family, with three genera, two of which have been established by
American naturalists; (3) Nucleoblastide, also a new family, including
four genera, one of which is made the type of the subfamily Hleacrinida,
while the other three belong to a second subfamily, Schizoblastide ; (4)
ZOOLOGY. 485

Granatoblastide, with two genera; (5) Codasteride, with four genera,
two of which belong to the special subfamily Phenoschismide, and the
other two te another named Cryptoschismide.

The second order of blastoidea is named Irregulares, and is restricted
to “unstalked blastoids, in which one ambulacrum, and the corre-
sponding radial are different from their fellows,” and the “ base usually
unsymmetrical.” This group includes only one family, long ago called
Astrocrinideé, but amended by Messrs. Etheridge and Carpenter, and
made to include three genera.

According to Messrs. Etheridge and Carpenter, the true blastoids do
not appear previous to the Upper Silurian period, and they appear to
have become extinct long before the close of the Carboniferous, no traces
of blastoids from the Lower Carboniferous (or calciferons sandstone
Series), much less from any of the marine bands of the coal measures,
being recognized.

All the known blastoids of ‘the Upper Silurian period are confined
to American strata, and represent the families Troostoblastide and
Codasteridz.”

In the Devonian period “all the families are represented. The Si-
Jurian Troostoblastide, however, do not appear in the American De-
vonian rocks; but they are well represented in Europe, although the
Devonian blastoids generally are slightly more numerous both in genera
and species in America than in Europe. In Europe the great center of
blastoid life in Devonian times appears to have been in the north of
Spain, whilst in the British isles there is but the scantiest evidence of
their presence in the rocks of that period.” (Etheridge and Carpenter,
op. cit.; An. and Mag. Nat. Hist. (5), xv111, pp. 412-417.)

Asterioids.

Organization of star-fishes.—In the course of investigation of a new
incubating star-fish from Cape Horn, to which the name Asterias hyadesi
has been given, Prof. Edmond Perrier has described a peculiar organ,
and deduced certain conclusions in respect to the taxonomy of the echi-
noderms:

‘On the wall of the sacciform canal which surrounds the hydrophoral
tube there is attached a problematic organ, which is prolonged beyond
the sacciform canal, in such a way as to form two organs connected with
the intestine, and giving off two lateral branches, which are in direct
relation with the genital glands. This problematic organ, which has
lately been called the chromatogenous organ by Hamann, has in young
Asterias hyadesi the form of a lateral conical prolongation of the peri-
toneal membrane of the digestive sac, and it contains a large number of
vitelline bodies identical with those of the wall of thesac. The lobes of
its surface are continuous with the trabecule which form the living basis
of the skeleton of the star fish, and it dilates at its external surface into
membranes, which envelop the hydrophoral tube. This collateral organ
A86 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

of the tube is then not a heart, but the site of the production of elements,
some of which, becoming free, form the corpuscles of the general cavity.
The canaliculi of the madreporite are due to nothing more than the
folding of the walls of the vibratile infundibulum, by which the hydro-
phoral tube opens to the exterior. Prof. Perrier is convineed that the
tube communicates at the point where it unites with the apex of the
funnel with the cavity of the sacciform canal. If the canaliculi of the
madreporic plate only lead into the hydrophoral tube or its upper ex-
pansion, the tube itself opens into the sacciform canal laterally, and
sea water can thus pass into the lacunar spaces, which Hamann con-
siders as a schizocoel, into the subambulacral cavities, and into the
general cavity.”

Professor Perrier concludes that in star-fishes, ‘as in echinids and
comatulids, sea water plays an important physiological part, but
its course is not regulated by as complicated a system of irrigating
canals ; from this it is deduced that the echinoderms are divisible into
two great groups. One of these contains cystoidea, blastoidea, stelle-
ride, and ophiurida, and the other erinoids, echinoids, and_holo-
thurians, and it is added that in this phylum, as in celenterata and
sponges, the penetration of water is a general phenomenon, while it is
rare in worms, arthropods, mollusks, and vertebrates. It is therefore
eoncluded that the old division of De Blainville, with certain modifica-
tions, may be retained, and that all animals may be divided into three
great groups, Protozoa, Phytozoa, and Artizoa.” (Comptes Rendus
Acad. Se., Cll, pp. 1146-1148; J. R. M.S. (2), VI, pp. 624, 625.)

WORMS.

Resemblances and differences of the nervous system of worms.—In con-
nection with the observations on the development of the nemertean
worm named Monopora vivipora, Prof. W. Salensky has considered the
homologies of certain parts, and especially of the nervous system and
proboscis of the nemertean, rhabdoccelous, and annelidan worms, and
gives his views in a tabulated form, contrasting the various groups.

The nervous system of the nemertines is contrasted with that of
the annelids in one table:

Conodonts.

Nature of conodonts.—The peculiar small tooth-like organisms found in
paleozoic rocks, and which have been named conodonts, have been again
subjected to investigation by K. von Zittel and J. V. Rohon. These
little bodies have been regarded, at least by some old authors, as the
remains of vertebrafes related to the myzonts or lampreys and hags. It
is not probable that this view is now entertained by any competent to
have an opinion, but the nature of conodonts is still undetermined. The
authors just referred to conclude that the structures in question are
neither related to the dentine teeth of true fishes or selachians, the
horny teeth of eyclostomes or marsipobranchiates, the teeth of mollusks,
the beaks of cephalopods, nor the spines of crustaceans, but do in form
and structure closely resemble the oral armature of annelids or gephy-
reans. This view has been previously enunciated, but the corroborative
testimony afforded by independent observers is of interest. It is well
added that if the view thus entertained be true, ‘‘ there must have been
in paleozoic times an immense number of very varied worm forms.”

4 Platyhelminths.

Origin of the nervous system of the nemertine worms.—The morphology
of the nemertine worms has been investigated by Prof. A. A. W. Hu-
brecht. The information respecting the origination and development
of the nervous system is of special interest. ‘‘ No portion of the central
nervous system” of the chief species examined, Lineus obscurys, ‘takes
its origin from either primary or secondary epiblast, but the whole
nervous system is of mesoblastic origin. At first the archenteron com-
municates with the enteron by a wide blastophore, but later on the
cavity of that portion of the intestine which grows backwards is closed
anteriorly, and in front of this another portion of the embryonic intes-
tine constantly remains in open communication with the exterior; the
488 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886,

anterior foregut opens by a crescentic slit, and this would seem to be-
come the mouth of the adult; in other words, there is no epiblastic
stomodcum; part of the foregut becomes the cesophagus, and the rest
appears to be converted into the nephridal system. The nephridia
seem to long remain ina more or less embryonic phase, but their history
is very difficult to make out, and is as yet only incompletely known.

“The mesoblast cells, once freely moving about in the blastocecel,
soon accumulate against the inner surface of the plates of secondary
epiblast, and the mass increases in size. The process of differentiation
leads to the appearance of muscle and nerve cells at a very early date ;
the mesoblast cells form a massive group in the prostomium, and a com-
paratively thin cell-sheet in the rest of the body.

‘“‘ Unexpected as is the mesoblastice origin of the nervous system, there
appears to be no doubt about it. Hubrecht, indeed, thinks that Salen-
sky’s figures of Amphiporus viviparus point to the mesoblastic origin of
the nervous system in that animal rather than the mode of origin ap-
proved by Salensky.” (Quart. Journ. Micr. Soc., XXVI, pp. 417-448, 1 pl.;
J. R. M.S. (2), vi, 6, pp. 614, 615.)

Cephalic pits of nemertines.—On the surface of the heads of nemer-
tine worms are developed certain pits whose functions and nature have
been long unknown. It has been recently suggested by M. Rémy de
Saint Loup that the cephalic pits may be “strictly compared to the
essential forms of the segmental organs” of the leeches, from which
they only vary in structure and function” (sic!) It is also suggested
that “they may serve as auditory organs, as an irrigating and respira-
tory apparatus, or as a head-kidney.” (Comptes Rendus Acad. Se., cm,
pp. 1576-1578; J. R. M.S. (2), vi, p. 797.)

Nematelminths.

Relations of hair-worms.—The elongated hair-like animals which are
generally believed by common people to be vivified horse-hairs—the
Gordiide of naturalists—have been investigated by Prof. F. Vejdovsky.
As the result of his investigation the professor concluded that“ although
the external form of the body appears to ally the Gordiide with the nema-
toid worms, the rest of their organization is so different that they ought
to be separated from that class of nemotohelminths, and brought into
closer relations with the Annulata; the presence of a true celom and
of mesenteries, as well as the highly developed central nervous system
and the segmental arrangement of their glands, demand this change.”
The absence of the enteric fibrous layer to the enteric canal, in which
the Gordiidz resemble the nematoid worms, ‘“‘ may be explained by the
fact that the Gordiide take in no food during their free-living stages,
while the conditions of these parts are unkiown in the younger and
parasitic stages. As in the Annulata, the mesenteries arise by the dif-
ferentiation of the epithelial layer of the ccelom.”
ZOOLOGY. ',. 489

As to the nervous system, “both developmentally and histologically,
the ventral cord agrees” with that of the annulates. Although the
peripheral system of the Gordiids is very different from that of the An-
nulata, “it is not difficult to find homologies between the two.” Other re-
semblances are found by Dr. Vejdovsky in *‘ the structure of the body
wall, the hypodermis of the Enchytreide being exactly like that of the
Gordiide; Polygordius, again, has, like Gordius (and the nematoids),
no circular muscular layer.” Also the structure of the muscular tissue
is of the annulate and not of the nematoid types. The characteristics
of the Gordiids, thus briefly hinted at, are sufficient, Professor Vejdovsky
thinks, to entitle the Gordiids to be isolated as an independent order,
and for this the name of Nematomorpha is proposed. (Zeitschr. f. wiss.
Zool., XLII, pp. 369-433, 2 pl.; J. R. M.S. (2), vi, p. 988.)

Myzostomids.

The relations of the myzostomids.—The curious parasites of the crinoids
known as myzostomids. and having some superficial resemblance to
mites, have been examined as to their anatomy and histology by Mr.
F. Nansen. Various peculiarities of the nervous system have been
described as well as characteristic features of other parts, but for a
knowledge of these reference must be made to the original memoir or
to a full abstract in the Journal of the Royal Microscopic Society. It
will be sufficient here to summarize the results of the investigations
upon complemental males and the systematic position of the group.

Complemental males were found in three species, M. giganteum, M. gt-
gas, and M. carpentert. Such males are ‘similar in structure to the her-
maphrodites, except that where the latter have ovaries, the males have
tubes with slightly developed cells, so that they have a certain resem-
blance to young ovaries; the dorsal oviduct (uterus) is feebly, but the
lateral oviducts are well developed. The author disagrees with Beard
as to the secondary origin of the hermaphroditism of Myzostomida, in-
asmuchb as the dicecious species are the most parasitic, and the rudi-
ments of testes in WM. cysticolum appear to be rather remnants of an
androgynous stage than budding developments of male organs.”

The systematic relations of the group, according to our author, are
rather with the chetopods, from which, nevertheless, they are suffi-
ciently distinct. They also show ‘a tendency towards certain arach-
nids (Linguatulida, Tardigrada, and perhaps Pycnogonida) and crusta-
ceans.” On the whole, however, it is believed by Mr. Nansen that the
group is derived “from the Trochophora, and, among archiannelids, are
related to Histriodrilus.” (Bidrag til Myzostomernes Anatomi og His-
tologi, Bergen, 1885; J. R. M.S. (2), V1, pp. 619-621.)

ARTHROPODS.
Crustaceans.

The land isopod crustaceans.—The isopod crustaceans found upon the
Jand, and some of which are known under the name of pill-bugs and
sow-bugs among the English-speaking peoples, have been studied by Dr.
Gustav Budde-Lund, and it seems that the species are quite numerous.
Four families have been admitted by Dr. Budde-Lund for the species,
and are named by him Onisci, Ligiz, Tylides, and Syspastide. By
far the best represented of these families is that of the Onisci, or, as it
is more generally called, the Oniscide. Fourteen genera are recognized
for the species, and these genera are segregated into two sections, (1) the
Armadilloidea, including eight genera, and (2) the Oniscoidea, embrac-
ing six genera, and in addition twoor three genera unknown to the author
have been noticed. The largest of the genera is Porcellio, to which one
hundred and four species are referred, of which eighty-two or eighty-
four are new, and to this succeed, so far as numbers are concerned,
Oniscus, with twenty-six or twenty-eight new species, and Armadillo,
with twenty-seven. The family of the Ligiz or Ligiide has eight gen-
era and thirty-three well-determined and fourteen doubtful species;
that of the Tylides or Tylide, a single genus, with twelve species; that
of the Syspastide includes only asingle species. The total number of
species described as members of the four families is ‘“‘ four hundred and
four or four hundred and ten, of which three hundred and twelve or
three hundred and sixteen are good species, and ninety-two or ninety-
four are species unknown to the author, or reputed species. The total
number of genera is thirty-six, or (if some be accounted subgenera)
twenty-five. (Crustacea isopoda terrestria per familias et genera et
species descripta a Gustavo Budde-Lund, Havnie, 1885; noticed in Ann.
and Mag. Nat. Hist. (5), xvi, pp. 81-84.)

Arachnids.

Ant-like spiders.—The ants are mimicked by representations of va-
rious groups of spiders as well as of other orders of insects. Prof. T.
Bertkau has called attention toa number ofsuch cases. Very frequently
the ant-like appearance is entirely superficial and disappears on close
examination. Numerous hemipterous insects, and especially the Alydus
calcaratus, exemplify this kind of mimicry. The resemblance ih the
case of Alydus is, however, due chiefly to the median constriction of
the body, the dark-brown color, similarity of size, and the slight dif-
ference of development between the head and tail. In the spiders
the resemblance is often quite close. Among the Attide the cephalo-
thorax and the posterior part of the body are often proximately equal.
In the Drasside “there are frequent instances of ant mimicry, as, for
instance, in the genera Phruolithus, and especially Micaria.”. Among
ZOOLOGY. ‘ 491

the Theridiide a beautiful instance of mimicry is furnished by the ap-
propriately named Formicina mutinensis. On elm trees resorted to by
ants of the genera Lasius and Lormica, an ant-like spider named Lascola
procox occurs, but *‘as the mimicry is exhibited only by the developed
males, which eat but little, the resemblance must be” in this case
‘‘ purely protective.”

The spider families Thomiside and Epeiride do not furnish any exam-
ples of such mimicry, and indeed, according to Professor Bertkau, in
those spiders “ant mimicry seems impossible.” (Verhandl. naturh.
Verein Rheinlands, XLiti, pp. 66-69; J. R. M.S. (2), vi, p. 977.)

Insects.

Entomogenous fungi.—Insects are not rare in which appendages of a
cottony or silky structure, or rather reminding one of such, and borne
on long peduncles, are seen growing through the joints of the body.
These appendages are really fungi of various kinds. A genus of large
size, and which, to a considerable extent, flourishes upon insects of
various kinds, is the genus Cordyceps. Forty-seven species of this
genus have been recorded by Professor Saccardo, of which twenty-three,
or about 50 per cent., are found in larve, and sixteen, or about 33 per
cent., in perfect insects. In fact, the fungus is not so common in perfect
insects as in the larve. Of the sixteen species occurring on the imago
or perfect insect noticed by Saccardo, three are noted as having been
found upon various species of ants; they are (1) Cordyceps unilateralis,
found on the Atta cephalota of Brazil; (2) Cordyceps australis on Pachy-
condyla striata, also of Brazil; and, (3) Cordyceps myrmecophila on Myr-
mica rufa (as well as on an ichneumon and a beette), in North America,
Europe, Ceylon, and Borneo. The Cordyceps unilateralis has been also
found infesting another ant of Brazil, as well as two species collected
by Mr. A. R. Wallace at a village on the island of Celebes. The Bra-
zilian ant is Formica sexguttata. Recently a new formicogenous spe-
cies of the genus, named Cordyceps Uoydii, has been described by Mr.
William Fawcett; the ant on which the new Cordyceps was found has
the appearance of being attacked by the fungus while it was alive.
The growth of the fine threads of the mycelium through the body
would in time Eill it. (A. & M. Nat. Hist. (5), xvi, pp. 316-318.)

Luminous beetles—Among the elateroid beetles are some conspicu-
ous for the light which emanates from their bodies. These luminous
elaterids, according to Mr. R. Dubois, are the animals “ which best
lend themselves to physiological analysis,” and consequently facts bear-
ing upon the general theory of biological luminosity may be gathered
from them. The luminous elaterids are mostly found between 30° south
and 30° north latitude and between 40° and 180° of longitude. ‘The
emission of light is intimately connected with an important physiologi-
cal function, but in some rare cases there is no luminosity. The posi-
492 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

tion, form, and powers of the luminous organs vary slightly in different
species, and a few have no such organs. One of the most brilliant is
Pyrophorus noctilucus, which has been especially studied by Mr. Du-
bois.” A preliminary anatomical examination compelled Mr. Dubois to
make certain corrections of statements previously current in regard to
the situation of the stigmata, the distribution of the trachee, and the
relations of the nervous system to the light-producing organs.

The luminiferous organs are “ composed of a special adipose tissue and
of certain accessory organs. Histochemical investigation revealed the
presence of a body which presents the character of guanin. Intense his-
tolysis takes place in the photogenous adipose tissue, the changes being
provoked or stimulated by the penetration of blood into the luminous
organs; the histolytic process is accompanied by the formation within
the photogenic cell of a vast number of small crystalline agglomerations
of special optic properties, and especially remarkable for their double
refraction.”

The blood, however, is * not indispensable for the production of light,
for the ovum is luminous even before segmentation, and the adipose photo-
genic cell, when isolated, exhibits the same property: these facts point
to a similarity between the substance of the adipose body and that of
the vitellus. ‘The larve, hitherto unknown, have been by the author
found te resemble those of other Elaterida, but are luminous. “At
first they have but-a single luminous organ, but this extends over all
the segments, and is localized at the points where histolysis is most
active. In the adult insect there are three luminous spots, which are
so placed as to aid walking, swimming, and flying in obscurity. The
muscles of the luminous organs regulate the supply of blood to the
photogenic organs, and so have an indirect action on the production of
light; the nerves act through the muscles; the photosensitive reflex
action has its seat in the cerebroid ganglia; centrifugal irritation of
the ganglia produces the appearance of light, but this is not the case
with centripetal stimulation. Respiration has only an indirect influence
on the photogenic function, and this by maintaining the vital conditions
of the blood and of the tissues; the nature of the food has no influence
on the production of animal light. The cell (the non-segmented ovum,
or the adipose cell) prepares the photogenic principles under the influ-
ence of nutrition, but the light is not the direct result of the proper
activity of the organized and living anatomical element. When the
structure of this anatomical element and its vitality are destroyed, the
luminous phenomenon can still be produced by a physico-chemical ac-
tion, similar to that which converts glycogen into sugar in the liver.
Though the luminous organs of Pyrophorus are the most remarkable
known to us, the organic expense is almost insignificant as compared
with the effect produced; so, too, the loss of energy is very slight,
whereas in artificial light it may be as much as 98 per cent.”
ZOOLOGY. 493

The causes of “ the admirable economic superiority” are analyzed and
the author summarizes them as follows:

(1) ‘‘There are a number of chemical rays in this light, as may be
shown by photography, but there is only a small proportion of them;
the resnlt must be ascribed to the existence of a fluorescent substance,
which has been discovered in the blood of Pyrophorus, and which, by
penetrating into the organ, gives it the special and brilliant character
which distinguishes the light. The greater number of the chemical
rays are transformed into very brilliant fluorescent rays of a medium
wave length.”

(2) ** Optic analysis shows that the light is in great part composed of
rays similar to those which are found at those points of the spectrum
where experience has fixed the maximum of illuminating intensity.”

(3) **There is no loss by heat radiation; the amount of heat given
off, even at the time of greatest activity, is infinitesimal.”

(4) ** There is no reason for supposing that there is any conversion
of energy into electricity.”

(5) This marvellous light is physiological because it is of vital origin,
and because no other source is as well adapted to the wants of the
organ of vision in the animal series.” (Bull. Soc. Zool. France, X1,
pp. 1-275, 9 pl.; J. R. M.S. (2), v1, pp. 595-597.)

Odoriferous apparatus of the bed-bug.—A large section of insects of
the great order of Hemiptera are notorious for the unpleasant odors
which emanate from their bodies, and not the least notorious is the form
too well known to many under the name of bed-bug. The allies of the
bed-bug have mostly wings. In the early or larval condition they have
three abdominal and dorsal glands, and these persist until the last
change of skin; they then become atrophied; when their wings appear,
a thoracic and sternal glandular apparatus becomes developed. Those
species ‘which suck sap are therefore provided with two systems of
organs of secretion, situated in two opposite parts of the body, accord-
ing as they are in the state of larva or pupa, or in the adult state.”

“The presence, at different ages,” says Mr. Kiinckel, “in the same
insect, of glands having different anatomical relations, but possessing
the same physiological attributes, is a fact which leads us to interesting
deductions.” We need not follow Mr. Kiinckel in these deductions, but
simply record his observations on the bed-bug. ‘‘Some naturalists,”
he remarks, “have thought that these creatures, when adult, repre-
sented the pupa state of other Hemiptera, and that the number of moults
justified their opinion ;” but according to Mr. Kiinckel, “ the disappear-
ance of the larval and pupal odoriferous glands coincides with the ap-
pearance of new odoriferous glands, the exclusive appanage of the adult
Hemiptera; then the Cimices capable of reproduction and regarded as
pupe are not able after another moult to acquire wings; they are creat-
ures which have attained the last term of their development.” In fine,

/
494 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 18386.

according to Mr. Kiinckel, ‘ the bed-bug, from the time of its hatching,
in the state of larva and pupa, possesses three dorsal, abdominal, odor-
iferous glands, which disappear in the last moult, and are replaced in
the adult state by a metathoracic, sternal, glandular apparatus. The
presence of this apparatus is a criterion which enables us to prove that
the Cimex has completed its evolution.” (C. R., 1886, July 5, p. 81; Ann.
and Mag. Nat. Hist. (5), xv1II, pp. 167-168.)

Odoriferous apparatus of butterflies.—The nature of the production of
the various kinds of odors emitted by butterflies has been investigated
and reported upon by Dr. E. Haase. Some odors are common to both
sexes, while others are restricted to one or the other.

Those odors which are common to both of the sexes are of two cate-
gories, (1) ‘‘ those which depend on some definite ethereal oil resulting
from the food of the caterpillar,” and (2) those which are of use in the
protection of the animal, and emitted against its enemies.

The odors which are restricted to one of the sexes are “ the various
attracting and captivating smells of sexually mature males and females.”
These are especially manifested by the Bombycide, containing some of
the large moths, when the odor of the female attracts males from a great
distance. Without their olfactory antenne, itis believed, the males would
be unable to find the females, and it.is to be noted that ‘the males are
odoriferous only when the female is capable of flight.” The fragrance
is * variously disposed, on scales of the wings, in thoracic pouches, in
pouches on the posterior wings, etc. There are small odoriferous scales,
usually occurring. They are generally protected, often associated with
tufts of hair, which diffuse fragrance.” The modifieations of the odorif-
erous apparatus, exemplified in various German and tropical Lepidop-
tera, are noticed. (S.-B. naturf. Gesell. Isis, 1886, pp. 9, 10; J. R. M.S.
(2), VI, pp. 969-970.)

MOLLUSKS.

Acephals.

Poison of the edible mussel.—The poisonous qualities of the common
table mussel have been investigated by Dr. G. Baumert and Mr. HE.
Salkowski. The poison of the mussel was found by Salkowski in a
cold alcoholic extract of the substance of the mollusk; watery extracts
were also poisonous; these results were obtained by physiological ex-
periments.

Chemical investigations were undertaken by Mr. Brieger, and it was
shown that ‘‘there was a non-poisonous base, the specific mussel poison,
an extremely poisonous substance which produced a copious flow of
saliva and diarrhea, but was not mortal, and a decomposition product
of poisonous properties. The mussel poison appears to belong to the
group of ptomaines, and is therefore a decomposition product of the
flesh of the mussel. Dr. Schneidemiih! is of opinion that the liver is the
ZOOLOGY. 495

seat of the poison, therein agreeing with Salkowski.” (Zeitschr. f.
Naturwiss., L1x, pp. 60-62; J. R. M.S. (2), v1, p. 587.)

Pteropods.

The food of pteropods.—In a memoir on the systematic relations and
biology of pteropods, Dr. J. E. V. Boas, of Copenhagen, has given de-
tails as to the food of seven species of pteropods, 7. e., Limacina balea,
L. helicina, Cleodora pyramidata, Hyalea trispinosa, Cuvierina columnella,
and an undetermined species of Tiedmannia. The food of these species
varies according to the temperature of the water in which the species
abound; those found in warm water had a specially rich and varied
assortment of food. The Globigerine and Acanthometre, and other radi-
olarians contributed to the food of most of the species. Infusorians
were also largely partaken of, and especially a goodly portion of Tin-
tinnoidea were found in almost all of the species; cocospheres and dia-
toms were also found in the food of several species. Very few animals
or plants of a higher grade of organization formed any portion of the
contents of the stomach. Only in two species were there found any
remains of crustaceans; in one fragments of a copepod being found, and
in another remains of an undetermined crustacean. (Zool. Jahrbiicher,
I, pp. 311-340.)

Families of gymnosomatous pteropods.—A remarkable gymnosomatous
pteropod was obtained by the U.S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross
off the coast of Carolina, in north latitude 38° 10’, west longitude 74°
15’. It measured 8™™ in Jength, and has been made known by Mr. Paul
Pelsener under the name Notobranchcea macdonaldii. It has the “ body
contracted behind, presenting only a posterior branchia formed by
three crests (one dorsal and two lateral), of which the dorsal one
alone is fringed ;” the anterior and posterior lobes of the foot are long
and narrow and the former free for the posterior two-thirds. These
characters contrast in one or other respects with all the other repre-
sentatives of the suborder, and have been regarded by Mr. Pelsener
as of family value. The family is named Notobrancheide.

The other families of Gymnosomota are as follows:

In the Pneumodermatidea, the visceral envelope presents a specialized
branchial apparatus, and acetabuliferous buccal appendages are de-
veloped.

In the Clionopside, the visceral envelope presents a specialized bran-
chial apparatus, but no acetabuliferous buccal appendages are devel-
oped.

In the Clionide, the visceral envelope presents no special branchial
apparatus, and the body is elongated and pointed behind.

In the Halopsychida, the visceral envelope also presents no*special
branchial apparatus, but the body is ovoid and rounded behind. (Ann,
and Mag. Nat. Hist. (5), x1x, pp. 79, 80.)

Gasteropods.

Nervous system of ctenobranchiate gasteropods.—In a memoir upon the
nervous system of the scutibranchiate gasteropods, Mr. E. L. Bouvier
has directed special attention to the character of the proboscidial com-
missure. In a memoir upon the nervous system of the ctenobranchiate
gasteropods he had maintained that the proboscidial commissure disap-
pears, but that “there is another connective which is very characteristic.
It is that which more or less distinetly connects the right commissural
ganglion with the subintestinal. This connective results from the anas-
tomosis of the right pallial nerves, which issue from the right commis-
sural and from the sub-intestinal ganglia. The author enumerates vari-
ous forms in which this arrangement is found. In the Cerithiidz the
conversion of the anastomosis into a connective may te studied step by
step. When once formed it varies very greatly in dimensions. On the
left-hand side the pallial nerve always retains its origin in the commis-
sural ganglion, except in Ampullaria, when it is converted into a con-
nective, going from the left commissural to the supra-intestinal gan-
glion.” (Comptes Rendus Acad. Se. Paris, CII, pp. 938, 939; J. R. M.
S. (2), 1887, p. 60.)

Nervous system of scutibranchiate gasteropods.—The nervous system of
various diceceous gasteropods of the groups Scutibranchiata, Aspido-
pranchiata, and Cyclobranchiata has been investigated by Mr. E. L.
Bouvier. He found that a number of them agree in certain characters
and consequently proposed to combine them under a general heading as
scutibranchs. The common characters are stated to be as follows:

(1) “The cerebroid commissure is very long, so that the ganglia are
set at the sides of the digestive tube; these ganglia are produced for-
wards and below to form a strong ganglionic projection, which is united
with that of the opposite side by a subwsophageal commissure; this
cord is called the proboscidial commissure.”

(2) ‘The stomato-gastric system arises from the inferior point of the
proboscidian projection and forms a loop; the two sympathetic ganglia °
are generally widely separated.”

(3) “ The pedal ganglia are well developed and form pedal cords,
while the principal nerves, with which they are continuous, are almost
always united by transverse commissures.”

(4) ‘The pallial ganglia are always more or less intimately connected
with the pedal ganglia.”

Of these characters, the first two are regarded as being ‘‘ primitive in
nature,” and the presence of the proboscidian commissure, described
by Lacaze Duthiers in Haliotis tuberculata, is maintained in contradiction
of the statements of Bela Haller, who denied its existence. Other
statements of Haller are likewise traversed by Mr. Bouvier. (Comptes
Rendus Acad. Se., orl, pp. 1177-1180; J. R. M.S. (2), V1, pp. 584, 585.)
ZOOLOGY. AGT

Morphology of the ampullariids.—The ampullariids or apple-snails are
especially interesting on account of the union of a lung-like breathing
apparatus with true branchie, and this peculiarity is combined with
some salient differences from other gasteropods in the development of
various parts of the body. The Shell varies in different forms, being
generally subglobose, but in some discoid and like a Planorbis, and in
others turreted and very much like the shell of the typical viviparids.
The anatomy of such a type must therefore be always of interest. It
has been investigated again by Mr. E. L. Bouvier. An examination of
the nervous system has shown that it is “* both chiastoreurous and zygo-
neurous.” The penis is an appendageof the mantle, and is innervated
by the right pallial nerve,” an interesting fact, as it is ‘a very rare if
not unique arrangement.” The epipodium is supplied by the commis-
sural ganglia, and not, as had been previously stated, by the pedal; it
is consequently a derivative from the mantle, and it becomes thus mani-
fest that “‘ the so-called epipodial structures are not all of the same mor-
phological significance, for some are appendages of the foot, aud others
of the mantle or body wall.”

As in the ctenobranchiates or gasteropods bearing pectinated gilis
generally, “the gill and false gill are innervated by the supra-intestinal
branch of the commissure,” and, on account of this mode of supply, ‘it
may be concluded that in Ampullaria and all other ctenobranchs, the
gills are the homologues of the left gill and so-called olfactory organ
of the zeugobranchs,” and not of the right gill of the latter, as most
anatomists have considered. Mr. Bouvier concludes that the systematic
relations of the ampullariids are with the zygoneurous tenioglossates,
and that the family approaches most nearly tothecalyptreids. Whether
this view will be generally accepted is perhaps doubtful. (C. R. Acad.
Se. Paris, CIII, pp. 162-165; J. R. M.S. (2), V1, pp. 949, 950.)

Cephalopods.

Relations of the cephalopods.—In the discussion of the morphology
and relationship of the cephalopods, Prof. C. Grobben contends that
those mollusks are most closely related to the scaphopods or dentaliids,
and not to the pteropods, as has been thought by many to be the case.
In his latest communication, he has devoted special attention to the in-
nervation of the arms as well as their development, and to a compari-
son of the type with Dentalium.

In Professor Grobben’s opinion, the arms certainly can not be consid-
ered as modifications of the anterior portion of the foot, as is abundantly
proved by the nerve supply. (1) “The cerebral ganglion is continued
downwards round the cesophagus,” and “4a portion of the subasophagus,
more apparently belonging to the pedal ganglion, really belongs to the
cerebral.” (2) ‘Of the nerve fibers supplying thearms, many undoubtedly
terminate in the downward-directed portions of the brain, but others
may be traced through the anterior and posterior lateral commissures

H. Mis. 600——32
498 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

into the posterior basal lobes of the cerebral ganglion.” The arm nerves
and brachial ganglion therefore owe their origin, ‘‘ not to the pedal but to
the cerebral ganglion,” and von Ihering’s suggestion that ‘ the brachial
was really a separate portion of the cerebral ganglion,” is thus cor-
roborated.

The comparison is especially interesting between the structure of
Nautilus and Sepia on the one hand and Dentalium on the other. The
body of Dentaliwm is so oriented that ‘ of the two mantle apertures, the
larger, through which the foot projects, is turned forward and down-
ward, while the narrower lies at the apical pole of the body. The mantle
cavity oecurs at the posterior side of the body.” In connection with
the superior mantle aperture in Dentalium, considerable space is devoted
to the discussion of the origin and development of the mantle cavity
and cleft. Finally, it is contended that the arms of cephalopods are
homologous with and derived from the cirri of the scaphopod or denta-
lioid gasteropods, and special comparison is made with the tentacles of
Nautilus, each tentacle of the nautilus being regarded as homologous
with an arm.of a dibranchiate cephalopod. These conclusions will
doubtless be dissented from by not a few morphologists. (Arbeit. zool.
Inst. Univ. Wien, vil, pp. 61-82; J. R. M.S. (2), V1, pp. 950, 951.)

Living cephalopods.—The recent cephalopods have been investigated
by Mr. William Hoyle in connection with the specimens obtained by the
Challenger expedition, and a monograph of those acquired by the great
expedition, as well as ‘a catalogue of recent cephalopoda,” has been
published.

Mr. Hoyle admits, in his catalogue, “ three hundred and eighty-eight
species, which are disposed in sixty-eight genera, and these into four-
teen families.” Of these species at least sixty to seventy ‘“ have
been inadequately characterized, so that it is unlikely that they could
be recognized from the published descriptions, and the same is true of
several of the genera; hence it may be said in round numbers that we
are acquainted with the fifty or sixty recent genera, containing three
hundred species. It is worthy of remark that twenty-nine, or half the
genera, contain only one species each, while nearly one-half the species
one hundred and seventy, belong to the three genera Octopus, Sepia,
and Loligo.”

The species have been considered by Hoyle with reference to their
distribution and have been referred to three primary groups: (1) the
pelagic; (2) the abyssal; and.(3) the littoral. Those of the first two cat-
egories have been further associated together as “ oceanic” species, and
have been distributed in three groups ‘‘ corresponding to the Atlantic,
Pacific, and Indian (including the Southern) Oceans, rather from con-
venience than from a belief that such a division is natural, although
the great majority are confined to one area. The chief factor limiting
their spread,” according to Mr. Hoyle, ‘‘is probably temperature, though
ZOOLOGY. 499

doubtless other conditions, such as presence of gulf weed, also have their
influence.” ;

The littoral species or ‘ those found in moderately shallow water not
far from thecoasts, whether they be active swimmers, like Loligo, or more
sedentary, like Octopus, are much more restricted in their range than the
oceanic.” Such have been referred to a number of regions, which agree
very closely with those proposed by Dr. Paul Fischer, in his recent
«¢ Manuel de Conchyliologie,” based upon a study of all the mollusks.
Seventeen regions of this character are admitted, and the species, so far
as known, are distributed in the following manner: Confined to one
littoral area, 199 species ; common to two littoral areas, 27; to three lit-
toral areas, 12; to four littoral areas, 4; to five littoral areas, 1; to six
littoral areas, 2; to ten littoral areas, 1. From these indications it ap-
pears that 80 per cent. of the species, so far as known, are confined to
one area, “‘a striking confirmation of the proposition that littoral
forms in general belong to many species, each of which is confined
within narrow limits.” The oceanic types are also limited in their dis-
tribution, as will aprear from the exhibit tabulated by Mr. Hoyle. From
one oceanic area, 66 species are known; from two oceanic areas, 15; from
three oceanic areas, 3. In fine, “ about 75 per cent. of the oceanic forms
are confined to one ocean, and cosmopolitan forms must be regarded as
exceptional.”

Finally, “thirty-five species are recorded from both oceanic and lit-
toral regions, but the majority of these are typically pelagic, and hence
their occurrence in the latter areas must be regarded as accidental.
Furthermore, it will be seen, that almost without exception, the littoral
regions where a species has been found are those bordering upon its
proper ocean, which is precisely what would have been expected.”

PROTOCHORDATES.
Tunicates.

The relations of the twnicates.—The mooted question as to the rela-
tionships of the tunicates, and especially the degree to which they are
connected with the vertebrates, has been again discussed. This ha
been done by Messrs. E. Van Beneden and C. Julin in a memoir on
the morphology of the animals of that class. For knowledge of the de-
tails we must refer to the original memoir and to the full abstract in
the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society. In this place the sug-
gestions as to the systematic position of the group can alone be consid-
ered:

(1) The Urochordata or tunicates form, in connection with the Cepha-
lochordata (i. ¢., Branchiostoma) and Vertebrata, a single primary
group—the Chordata.

(2) “The tunicates have, like the other two divisions. arisen from seg-
mented enterocclous organisms, like the archiannelid worms. Animals
500 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

like Protodrili, but with dorsal chord, and anterior respiratory diverti-
cula from the gut, formed the common starting point for the Chordata.
In these Protochordata the posterior portion of the trunk is adapted
more especially for locomotion, while the caudal region of the ancestral
digestive tube has undergone progressive atrophy and the vegetative
functions have become more localized im the anterior part of the trunk.
The transformation of one part of the segmented body of the vermiform
ancestors has affected all the trunk, except the cephalic extremity and
first segment of the body, in those forms whence the Urochordata have
arisen.”

(3) “‘ The affinities between Uro- and Cephalochordata are much closer
than between either and the Vertebrata.”

The manner in which the various groups have originated and the sup-
posed degree of their relationship are exhibited in a scheme herewith
presented:

Cephalochordata.
Vertebrata.
SY Urochordata.
SS Annulata,

Protochordata.

Protannulata.

(Arch. de Biol., vi, pp. 237-476, 9 pl.; J. R. M. 8. (2), 1887, pp.
62-65.)

Classification of the tunicates.—The tunicates have been variously sub-
divided into orders, but according to M. F. Lahille all of these arrange-
ments are more or less unnatural, and in his opinion the best basis for
a primary classification of the class is furnished by the development of
the gills. ‘The Salpide have a single row of holes on either side of
their gill organs;” the Doliolide are similarly characterized, but the holes
are more developed as well as more numerous. The Didemnidz have
three rows, and, finally, the Leptoclinide have four. In the “higher
types the gill is larger, and is placed beside the intestine. In the Tha-
liacea the respiratory organ is very simple and without papille.”
Those forms, which are characterized by a simple gill, are grouped
together sees the name “ Aplousobranchiata.” Those in which ‘the
gill is provided with longitudinal vessels” are grouped together under
the name “ Phlebobranchiata.” Finally, those which “ have Jongitudi-
nal folds on the gills” are distinguished as ‘‘Stolidobranchiata.” The
progressive complication of the gill, it is affirmed, corresponds ‘‘to 1n-
crease in the differentiation of the whole ascidian organism,” and the
proposed classification, it is urged, is therefore not the outcome of de-
pendence on a single character, but the result of a co-ordination of
ZOOLOGY. 5OL

various systems. (Comptes Rendus Acad. Se. Paris, Cl, pp. 1573-1575;
J. It. M.S. (2), VI, pp. 777, 778.)

VERTEBRATES.
Rishes and fish-like forms.

Factors in the geographical distribution of American fresh-water fishes.— -
Professors Jordan and Gilbert have published a “ List of fishes collected
in Arkansas, Indian Territory, and Texas,” and have concluded with
some general considerations on the distribution of the species:

(1) Many species have been regarded as very local, but research has
shown that some of them have ‘a very wide distribution in the West
and South, and what is true of these species will very likely be found
true of all these now known from only a few localities ;” such is espec-
ially the case with the small percoid fishes named Etheostomine or
Ethiostomatine.

(2) ** As our knowledge of the geographical range of a species widens,
it becomes necessary to extend our ideas of the range of variation in-
cluded by it, and we are compelled to admit under it geographical vari-
eties or subspecies.” Eventually, therefore, a trinomial nomenclature
must be adopted in ichthyology, as has been done in ornithology.

(3) “The environment and cenditions of life being similar, the water
communication being free, we have a similar fauna in regions widely
separated.” For example, the fishes of the Ozark region are substan-
tially identical with those of the hilly regions of Tennessee.

(4) ‘‘ Free water communication is essential to a varied fauna,” and
‘the larger a river system the greater” is the “number of species in
each of its affluents,” while, on the contrary, short streams emptying
into the ocean have a comparatively meager fauna.

The factors “favorable to the production in any stream of a large num-
ber of fishes” are (1) ‘clear water ;” (2) ‘‘a .moderate current;” (3) ‘a
bottom of gravel, preferably covered by a growth of weeds;” (4) ‘‘ water
not too cold and not stagnant;” (5) connection with a large hydro-
graphic basin; and (6) “little fluctuation in the year in volume of the
stream or in the character of the water.”

The conditions enumerated, it is added, are “ well realized in the
Washita River and in certain affluents of the Ohio and the Tennessee,
and in these, among American streams, the greatest number of species
has been recorded.” (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 1886, pp. 1-25.)

Selachians.

Relations of the extinct Hybodonts—The Hybodonts were sharks
numerous in the ancient seas, and which have generally been supposed
to be closely related to the Cestracionts or Heterodontids, although
much doubt has existed in the minds of some ichthyologists as to their
exact affinities. Some remains of the lower jaw and the hyoid arches
502 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 18386.

of a cretaceous species, Hybodus dubrisiensis, have been studied by Mr.
A. Smith Woodward, of the British Museum, with reference to this
question. Without going into details, it may be observed that Mr.
Woodward thinks that ‘‘on the whole, the form of hyoid arch” devel-
oped in this type bore ‘‘a greater resemblance to that of the Notidan-
_ idee than to that of any other living family; it agrees in the fact that
the hyomandibular and ceratohyal are most contracted at their point
of union, but the elements are somewhat stouter than those both of
Heptanchus and Hexanchus.” He concludes that “it must suffice at
present to add that, though there are well preserved pterygo-quadrates”
from both the different geological horizons in which remains of the
skeleton have been found, ‘‘ there appears to be none but the most un-
certain evidence of an articular facette on the otic process in any; and
if this observation can be confirmed it will become of considerable in-
terest when taken in connection with the fact pointéd out by Professor
Huxley, that the postorbital articulation in the living Heptanchus is
only acquired comparatively late in the development of the foetus. It
is also interesting to note that one of the Liassic specimens exhibits
traces of a persistent notochord, with the arches alone calcified, whereas
in the cretaceous form,” as has been shown by Mr. Woodward, ‘there
are well differentiated centra.” The differences between the anterior and
posterior teeth are likewise more marked in Hybodus dubrisiensis than
in any of the earlier species of which satisfactory remains are known.
‘‘¥t would appear indeed that there is distinct evidence of specializa-
tion, as the Hybodonts are traced through the Mesozoic period, and it is
almost certain that future research in regard to structures other than
teeth will lead to the subdivision of the multitudinous forms hitherto
grouped under one generic name.” (Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1886, pp.
218-224, pl. 20.)

The question still remains an open one as to the degree of relation-
ship of the Hybodonts to the Heterodontids, for it is scarcely probable
that there is any close relationship between the former and the Notid-
anids.

Fishes proper, or Teleostomes.

Fishes with males larger than females.—It has been believed by some
ichthyologists, and especially affirmed by Dr. Giinther, that ‘ with re-
gard to size, it appears that in all teleosteous fishes the female is larger
than the male.” This statement is altogether too general, and various
exceptions are known. It is indeed possible that in a large proportion
of those fishes whose males are distinguished by brilliancy of coloration
or other striking secondary sexual characters, while the females are
comparatively plain, the males are larger than the females. Such is
the case at least with certain species of the family of Gobiesocids. These
fishes are common in certain waters, although rather local and rare |
along the coasts of eastern America. Several species are however
ZOOLOGY. 503

found along the British coasts, and in some localities some one or other
may be quite abundant. The external appearance of some is also very
striking. In the words of Mr. W. Anderson Smith, ‘“‘ No brush can give
any adequate conception of the brilliance of Lepadogaster bimaculatus
from eight to twelve fathoms on scallop ground; or the vividness of
coloring of the male of L. Decandolit in the breeding season. The pre-
vailing tone of this fish is a somewhat sober-tinted combination of olive-
greens and grays. At the breeding time the female is much smaller,
less conspicuous in every way, apd commonly marked with a band
across between the eyes, which somewhat resembles the spectacle mark
on the Cornish sucker of Couch—JU. gouanit of Day. More timid, more
active, slighter built, and more sober-tinted, the female might well have
been supposed to be a different species from its brilliant companion,
whose bright carmine spots on the dorsal fin commonly give him a suffi-
ciently distinctive appearance.”

The species of Lepadogaster are known, in common with other repre-
sentatives of the family, as well as those of the family Liparidide, as
suckers, on accaunt of the development on the breast or the ventral
fins as a suctorial apparatus by means of which they attach themselves
to stones and other substances, remaining fixed, as for example, a boy’s
sucker does when likewise applied. This characteristic seems to be a
co-ordinate of other organs in the structure of the species so distin-
guished. ‘It would appear,” says Mr. W. A. Smith, ‘as if a slender
body and weak vertebrate system had developed” a “ habit of clinging
to the sea-ware and sea bottom that stimulated the pectoral region to
meet the necessities of the situation, and in the case of Lepadogaster to
cushion itself, the pectoral fins curving around the swelling bosom of the
fish. Between these cushions depressions were left, and these proving
very advantageous to the fish by their sucker action, the advantage was ~
pursued by nature and transmitted.” Differences prevail and specializa-
tion of various kinds supervene. ‘Although the small eushion-like
disks of Cyclopterus and Liparis are the truest suckers, yet the species of
Lepadogaster are perhaps the most truly sucker fish. This especially
apphes to L. Decandolit (Day), which is really a sucker fish all the way
forward from the sucker proper itself; two-thirds of its length, and prac-
tically three-fourths of its weight and horizontal surface, is a sucker.
By sucking up its lower jaw, and allowing its cartilaginous frame-work
to rest on any object, the front jaw adds its sucking action to the sucker
proper. This is aided by the plentiful discharge of mucus, in which
the species emulates the unctuous sucker, L. linearis [Liparis vulgaris |.”

The movements of the sucker-fishes are uncertain, and it is difficult
to account for their changes. ‘ At one time they will be comparatively
common under stones on a certain piece of foreshore at low spring tide;
and again they may be searched for in vain even in the same season of
the year.” This difference was supposed by Mr. W. A. Smith to be due
to the prevalence or absence of rough water.
504 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

The Scottish species of Lepadogaster spawn in June and July. The
eggs of all are large compared with the fish, and this, Mr. W. A. Smith
adds, “‘may be said as a rule of shore fishes whose ova are compara-
tively few in number and more carefully watched over and tended by
the parents. The eggs indeed of Lepadogaster may be readily counted,
and average about one hundred and fifty.” They are generally depos-
ited in regular layers within the empty shells of seallops, and are usually
“accompanied by the parent, curled up inside the shell, watching over
the progress of their progeny; and if the dredge should bring upa shell
thus supplied with ova from eight to twelve fathoms off scallop ground,
if the fish is not in the shell, it is almost sure to be in the other contents
of the dredge, showing it had either come out in the capture, or been
watching close by.”

It is nearly a month before the eggs of the Lepadogaster Decandolit
are hatched, and the young then has “ no sign of a sucker or the con-
comitant habits;” they are indeed ‘‘extremely active.” The “ develop-
ment of the muscles that act upon the pectoral region are merely em-
bryonic at forty-six days old,” and it is not until some time afterwards
that the suctorial apparatus is completely developed. (Proc. R. Physi-
cal Soc. Edinburgh, 188586, pp. 143-150.)

Variations in oviposition of Callichthyoid jishes.—It had long been
known that the Hoplosternum (or Callichthys) littoralis makes a nest and
takes assiduous care of its young. Additional information has been
recently given by Capt. J. A. M. Vipan, in observations made on
fishes from Trinidad and preserved in the aquarium at his house in
England. Two individuals “commenced making a nest on June 6 but
that” and another they made three days later they soon pulled to
pieces. “On the night of the 11th they began a new one; it consisted
of pieces of Vallisneria, of the leaves of Nymphea that were growing
in the tank, which they bit off close to the roots of the plants, and a
great quantity of river-moss (Fontinalis antipyretica), each piece being
two or three times the size of the fish, so that it must have had hard
work to bring them to the surface. They worked these materials
together by some mucous substance until the outside was hard, the
whole being under a quarter of an inch thick; they next buoyed up the
structure with a quantity of mucous foam until it was raised 34 inches
above the water. The whole nest was 9 inches long and 7 inches wide,
and somewhat resembled a finger-glass turned upside down on the top
of the water, with the interior filled with froth. The fish kept swim-
ming close under it all the time on their backs, and filling it with foam
when finished. On the 12th the female shed her spawn between ber
ventral fins, which were clasped right together, and, when full, swam
to the nest, and, turning on her back, deposited the spawn in it; this
occurred several times, the male each time putting the spawn in its
proper place and covering it with froth. As soon as the female had
ZOOLOGY. 505

dropped all her spawn the male took entire possession of the nest and
would not let his mate go anywhere near it, and treated her so badly ”
that Captain Vipan had to * place her in another tank to save her life.
Unfortunately the spawn was not good, only a few eggs hatching,
and the young fishes dying soon afterwards.”

Captain Vipan adds some interesting information relative to a small
species of a genus allied to the Hoplosternum, the Corydoras (or Callich-
thys) punctatus. He bred large numbers of that little fish obtained from
the Amazon, but “they never made the slightest attempt at making a
nest, always depositing their spawn all over the tank, and even on the
floating thermometer kept in it.” He does not mention whether the
male guarded the eggs, and it might be inferred indeed that such was
not the case. Such neglect, however, would be exceptional among the
Nematognathous fishes, inasmuch as the male almost always takes care
of the eggs during maturation. (Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1886, pp. 330,

331.)

The constituents of white bait.—The nature of the famous English lux-
ury known as ‘ white-bait” was for along time doubtful. In the earlier
part of the century it was generally referred to a peculiar species of the
family of Clupeids, and the English naturalist Yarrell described it as a
new species under the name Clupea alba, and by even such adistinguished
ichthyologist as Valenciennes this view was not only accepted but the
supposititious species was regarded as being a representative of a dis-
tinct genus, Rogenia, and consequently the Rogenia alba was inscribed
for some time in the books as a specific name of the white-bait. Later
the white-bait was very generally considered to be simply the young of
the common herring. Still later observations, however, indicated that
the problem was not to be so easily solved, and that the name white-
bait, instead of indicating any specific fish, was rather a generic term
under which various small fishes were combined, and recent investi-
gation has been made by Prof. J. C. Ewart, who examined specimens
obtained in the London markets for several months, from the middle
of February to the middle of August, 1885. The results of this inves-
tigation are interesting and noteworthy. During February, out of
fourteen hundred specimens examined, 93 per cent. were sprats and
only 7 per cent herring; during March, of twelve hundred specimens
examined, 95 per cent. were sprats and 5 per cent. herring; in April,
of eight hundred specimens 86 per cent. were sprats and 14 per cent.
herring; in May, of six hundred specimens 70 per cent. were sprats and
30 per cent. herring; in June, of eight hundred specimens 87 per cent.
were herring and 13 per cent. sprats; in July, of six hundred specimens
75 per cent. were herring and 25 per cent. sprats; and in August, of
five hundred specimens 52 per cent. were herring and 48 per cent. sprats.
The specimens varied in length from about 1 inch to 3, but averaged in
the neighborhood of 2.
506 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

The results thus obtained conclusively demonstrate that the nature
of white-bait varies considerably; sometimes it consists almost entirely
of sprats, while at other times it consists chiefly of herring; and not
only does it vary as to the number of sprats and herring, but also in the
size of these fish. ‘‘In February and March the white bait in the Lon-
dlon market was almost entirely made up of about half-grown sprats; in
April the white bait was smaller and the number of herring had cen-
siderably increased; in May, June, and July the white bait was almost
entirely composed of small fish, many of them with only a few scales,
and undoubtedly young herring.” In August the herring were larger
and fewer in number, while the sprats were considerably smaller. From
the figures given, it will be evident that the white bait examined during
the six months consisted of about 60 per cent. of sprats and about 40
per cent. herring, the sprats diminishing from 93 per cent. in February
to 13 per cent. in June, and rising again to 48 per cent.in August; the
herring rising from 7 per cent. in February to 87 per cent.in June, and
falling to 52 per cent. in August.” It is also noteworthy thatin all the
lots examined by Professor Ewart, there were a few small fish that be-
longed to neither the herring nor sprat species; there were, e. g., gobies,
small pipe-fish, sand-eels, and conger-eels, and, in addition to both, there
were often shrimps and specimens of Beroe, and on one occasion a small
octopus.”

In view of these facts, it is evident that white bait can be enjoyed
wherever the young of the clupeids can be obtained in sufficent abund-
ance, and that even small fish or the young of other fishes can be admin-
istered as white bait. If it is desirable, then, white-bait dinners can be
as readily provided for in the United States as in England. The white-
bait dinner is indeed simply a matter of fashion, but the strength of
this is shown by the fact that in Scotland, for example. when they were
“spreading tons of absolutely fresh white-bait taken from the Forth”
on the fields and ‘‘ sending still larger quantities from the Tay to be
manufactured into manure at Montrose,” they were at the same time
importing white bait at a considerable cost from London. (Proc. R.
Physical Soc. Edinburgh, 1885-’86, pp. 78-81.)

A new Pediculate fish of the family Ceratiide.—A group of remarkable
deep-sea fishes of the order Pediculati, to which a number of forms have
been added within the past few years, has received another notable ad-
dition during the past year. A single specimen, about 2 inches (49™™)
long, was obtained by Capt. P. Andresen, a Norwegian sailing-master,
in May, 1877, ‘floating in the sea,” near the island of Madeira, and was
presented to the museum of the Christiania University. It has, how-
ever, only been lately described by Prof. Robert Collett. Like so many
of the other deep-sea forms, the new fish, has a very deeply cleft mouth
armed with enormously long teeth at the front; its head is very large,
and the deeply cleft mouth but moderately oblique; the body is com-
ZOOLOGY. BOW

pressed and the ‘‘skin smooth; the spinous dorsal fin, is reduced to a
single cephalic tentacle, the basal part of which is erect, not procum-
bent;” the soft dorsal and anal are very far back near the caudal and
even more reduced than usual, the dorsal having only three unbranched
rays and the anal two. But what especially distinguishes the new
fish from its relations is the development of a long tentacle from the
throat; the tentacle originates between the rami of the lower jaw ‘at
a distance from the symphysis about equal to half the length of the
jaw,” and is “ nearly three times and a half as long as the tentacle on
the snout,” extending a distance equal to that “from the front of the
eye to the root of the caudal fin; it is thinner than the cephalic spine,
.and divides itself at the end into two short, pointed blades, the length
of each being 6™™, Whilst the tentacle otherwise is black, the inner
edges of these blades are white, like the upper half of the snout ten-
tacle, and are furnished with a row of round papillae, about thirty
on each, resembling a chain of pearls. These small bodies undoubtedly
have a use, either as organs of sense or as the source of a phosphor-
escent light.” As usual in the family, the color of the new fish is “jet-
black, with the exception of the upper half of the bulb of the tentacle
on the snout and the inner margins of the ends of the guttural tenta-
cle, which are white, but which in the living fish have probably been
silvery and phosphorescent.”

The fish thus distinguished has been named by Prof. Collett Linophryne
lucifer, and would be regarded by some ichthyologists as the represent-
ative of a new subfamily within the family Ceratiid, to be named Lino-
phrynine.

Captain Andresen was on a voyage to the West Indies when he saw
the fish. “He was capturing turtle in his boat; there was a heavy
swell, but the water was smooth. After a time he caught sight of this
little black fish, which lay on the surface quite alive, but almost mo-
tionless, which was not surprising when it was discovered that it had
just swallowed a fish larger than itself. It did not lie on its side, but
was apparently unabletoswim. By getting the bailer under it he lifted
it out with ease, and in order to keep it fresh he gave up his search for
turtle and rowed back to the ship, where it was placed in spirit for
preservation.” The fish contained in the stomach was “ one-half
longer” than its captor, and belonged to the family Scopelide. (Proc.
Zool. Soc. London, 1886, pp. 138-143, pl. 15.)

Amphibians.

Recent additions to the amphibians.—In 1882 Dr. -G. A. Boulenger pub-
lished his catalogues of all the existing amphibians. Recently he has
given the “first report on additions to the batrachian collection in the
Natural History Museum,” and it appears therefrom that sixty-three
species of ecaudate amphibians (frogs, toads, etc.), four species of cau-
date (salamanders), and seven species of apodal amphibians (ccecilians)
508 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

have been added since that time. The largest proportion of them have
been described since 1882. Forty-five of the new species are represented
by the types in the British Museum. (Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1886,
pp. 411-416, pl. 39.)

Varieties of ovipositon among the tailless amphibians.—Great variety
of oviposition is manifested by the tailless amphibians, and a very use-
ful résumé of the information that has been collected up to the present
time has been published by Dr. G. A. Boulenger, in connection with
some observations by Dr. H. von Ihering ‘on the oviposition in Phyl-
lomedusa.” Most of the anurans lay their eggs in the water, but the
exceptions are numerous and some of them very singular. Dr. Boulenger
groups the eggs primarily into those in which the ovum is very small,
in contradistinction from others in which the yelk-sack is very large.

In some ‘the ovum is smali, and the larva leaves it in a compara-
tively early embryonic condition.” Such are the ova of the great ma-
jority of the anurans. (1) Further, in most cases, they are laid di-
rectly in the water; all of the European types except of the genus Alytes
display this mode of oviposition. (2) But by a few species ‘the ova
are deposited out of the water.” (a) Certain South- American species
deposit them “in holes on the banks of pools, which become filled with |
water after heavy rain,” whereby the larve are liberated. The species
so distinguished, as far as known, are Leptodactylus ocellatus, Leptodac-
tylus mystacinus, and Paludicola gracilis. (b) A couple of other species
likewise deposit their eggs out of the water, but instead of in holes, on
the leaves of trees hanging over the water, so that the larve may drop
down into the water after leaving the egg. One of the species thus
distinguished is the Chiromantis rufescens, of West Africa, and another
the Phyllomedusa Iheringii, of southern Brazil.

In other anurans ‘the yelk-sack is very large and the young under-
goes the whole er part of the metamorphosis within the egg; at any
rate, the larva does not assume an independent existence until after the
loss of the external gills.”

In some of these “the ova are deposited in damp situations, or on
leaves, and the embryo leaves the egg in the perfect air-breathing
form.” Such are a true frog, Rana opisthodon, of South America, and
a tree-frog, Hylodes martinicensis, of the island of Martinique.

In other cases “ the ova are carried by the parent.”

The parent in some instances is the male. (a) By the male of one
species the eggs are carried in a chain “around the legs,” while “the
young leaves the egg in the tadpole state.” Such a phase is manifested
by the Alytes obstetricans of Europe. (b) In another instance the male
takes care of the egg, but in another and very remarkable manner, for
the eggs are carried about in a gular sack, which is simply a modification
of the vocal, and “ the young is expelled in the perfect state,” such as
the Rhinoderma.
ZOOLOGY. 509

In other cases it is the female that assumes the réle of custodian to
the eggs.

In one case the female carries the eggs ‘ attached to the belly ;” the
Rhacophorus reticulatus of India is the only known species in which this
method is manifested.

In another and long known species, the Pipa surinamensis, the eggs
are ‘¢attached to the back of the female by the male, and her skin
develops into cells for their reception, wherein the young complete their
metamorphosis within the egg.”

Equally remarkable instances of the carriage of the eggs on the back
of the mother are furnished by the toads of the family Hylide and genus
Nototrema. In all of these a special dorsal pouch is developed, and it is
in allusion to this that the name Nototrema has been given. The species
vary, however, in the extent to which they carry the young. In one
form, the Nototrema marsupiatum, “the young leaves the pouch in the
tadpole state,” while in two other species, Nototrema. testudineum and
Nototrema oviferum, the young remain in the pouch until they have at-
tained their natural form and are only then expelled. (Ann. and Mag.
Nat. Hist. (5), Xvi1, pp. 461-464.)

Reptiles.

A remarkable Tortoise.—The fauna of Papua, or New Guinea, has fur-
nished within the last decade some very remarkable previously unknown
types to naturalists, and not the least interesting of them is a new gen-
eric type of tortoises made known during the past year by Prof. E. P.
Ramsay, of Sydney, New South Wales. The new type is referred to the
family Trionychide, and, indeed, in a preliminary communication, the
species was noticed as a member of the genus Cyclanosteus. The
perusal of the description and an examination of the plate, however,
show that its affinities to any of the known tortoises are very slight, and
that it is not only not referable to any previously described genus, but
should be kept apart from the family Trionychide at least. The cara-
pace, or upper shell, is“ shield-shaped, rounded, and high in front, pointed
and keeled behind, and the plastron, or lower shell, is composed of
*‘nine shields rounded anteriorly and posteriorly, the second and third
pairs anchylosed to the marginals.” In detail,‘ the plastron or ventral
shield is flat, of nine plates,” and the second, third, and fourth pairs of
plates have a straight median suture, while the second and third pairs
are anchylosed to the fourth and seventh marginals; ‘‘ the whole of the
plates of the carapace and sternum are covered with small round, raised
rugations, or wavy irregular raised lines between shallow sculptures,
towards the lower borders on the sides. These take an elongated form,
sometimes parallel to the sutures.” There are no scutes.

The head of the animal is “large, subquadrangular, narrowed ante-
riorly,” and covered by six (?) plates, which are “anchylosed” and
510 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

‘“‘rugose;” the nostrils are “anterior,” and the “jaws naked, with sharp
cutting edges, the lower curved,” and not notched.

What is especially remarkable, however, is the character and form of
the members. The arms are “elongate, narrow, compressed, ridged
on their rounded anterior portion, with narrow plates,” and the nails
are *“‘free on first two digits only,” the rest being “without nails and
strongly webbed, the tips flattened,” and “the third the longest.” The
hind legs are ‘‘ short,” and the first two toes have “ strong, sharp nails,”
which nails are alone free, the rest of the toes being “strongly webbed
to the tips.”

The tortoise thus distinguished was obtained in the Fly River, and
was a female of large size, the total horizontal length of the carapace
being 18 inches,and along the curve of the back 19 inches, while the
head and neck were about 7 inches long.

From the paragraphs of the description thus selected, it is not evident
why the new tortoise should have been referred to the family of Triony-
chide. Apparently the only reason was because the scutes were not
developed, and consequently a rudimentary or tense skin alone invested
the bones. The differences manifested from all the Trionychide, how-
ever, are very great, and in the classification lately proposed or adopted
by Professors Cope and Dollo it would belong to a different section of
the order. In fact, assuming that the tortoise is a cryptodire, according
to the classifications adopted by those gentlemen it would enter into
the group of Clidosterna or Clidoplastra, inasmuch as the plastron
unites ‘ with the costal bones of the carapace by suture, with ascending
axillary and inguinal buttresses.”

But the assumption that the tortoise is a eryptodire is itself some-
what violent, and in view of the geographical distribution of the order
to which it belongs it may quite likely prove to be a cryptodire.

But whatever may be the relations of the new genus, whether to the
cryptodirous or pleurodirous tortoises, it has many quite peculiar char-
acters. From all known forms it is apparently distinguished by the ab-
sence of seuta, the peculiar feet, and other characters. Undoubtedly,
therefore, the new genus does not belong to any of the established mod-
ern families, and apparently not to any of the extinct ones named, 4l-
though when more is known of Carettochelys, as well as the extinct forms,
it may turn out that the Papuan animal is related to one of the fami-
lies now regarded as extinct. Meanwhile, it will be better to isolate
the genus, and regard it as the type of a peculiar family. This family
of Carettochelyidz has a ‘“clidosternal” shell destitute of scuta; the
carapace has six vertebral plates separated from each other by inter-
vening costals, eight costal plates, the last two of which are connected
mesially by the entire borders (no vertebral plates intervening), and
ten pairs of marginal plates, as well as a nuchal and a pygal. The
plastron is composed of nine plates, completely ossified and leaving no

fontanelle, an ‘‘interclavicle” or mesosternal being well developed. The
ZOOLOGY. 511

head is wide and blunt in front, and the jaws are uncovered by lips.
The feet are pinniform, with the first and second digits short and en-
tirely involved in the skin, leaving only the claws exposed, while the
third (which is the longest) and the succeeding have the last two pha-
langes elongated and exserted, but connected by an extensive web, and
destitute of claws. (Proc. Linn. Soc. N. S. Wales (2), 1, pp. 158-162,
pl. 3-6.)*

A family of Lizards new for the American fauna.—In Asia there are a
few lizards having the eye entirely concealed by the skin, and with the
tongue scaly, constituting the family of Anelytropide. Their life is
mainly subterranean, and consequently they rarely come within the field
of observation, unless specially sought for. In the examination of a
collection of reptiles made by the geographical and exploring commis-
sion of the Republic of Mexico, Professor Cope detected a specimen evi-
dently belonging to this family, which he has described as a new generic
type, under the name Anelytropsis papillosus. The importance of this
discovery, he thinks, ‘‘is considerable, as it shows that the scincoid
lizards have undergone in the New World the same degenerative pro-
cesses as in the Old World, and in the same way. This is a new fact,
even supposing that the Aniellidz of America are a degenerate form of
the same family, which is not probable. Dr. Boulenger believes that
that family is a degenerate type of the Anguid stem,” and with this
view Professor Cope is disposed to concur. Anelyptropsis, according to
Professor Cope, is ‘‘a degree further down in the scale than Aniella, in
having the epidermis absolutely continuous over the eye, as in other
members of the family of Anelytropide, and as in the Typhlopoid family
of snakes.” (Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., 1886, p. 196.)

The feat of an amphisbenoid lizard.—A singular instance of the ex-
cavating powers and vitality of an amphisbenoid has been noticed by
Dr. Boulenger, the keeper of the department of reptiles in the British
_ Museum. A coral snake (Hlaps lemniscatus) was found with an amphis-
beenoid, a species known as Lepidosternon polystegum, projecting from a
hole in the anterior half of the body, while the posterior part protruded
from the mouth of the snake. ‘Tne Lepidosternon had been swallowed
headforemost by the snake, and had, apparently by means of its sharp-
edged cutting snout, partly forced its way out of the body of its enemy,
making its escape 3 inches from the mouth.” (Proc. Zool. Soc. London,
1885, pp. 327-328; Am. Nat., xx, p. 178, Feb., 1886.)

Earth-Snakes of India.—A group of curious snakes is found in India
and are peculiar to the main-land and the island of Ceylon, where they

* Postscript.—After this report had been prepared, the “Annals and Magazine of
Natural History” for March, 1887, was received, and in it is an article by Dr. Boulenger
‘On a new family of Pleurodirian turtles” (x1x, pp. 170-172), in which Carettochelys
is declared to be a Pleurodirian, and the representative of a peculiar family (Caret-
tochelydidw). The more correct form is Charettochelyde, (yeAvc, yeAvoc.) Dr. Bou-
lenger only knew the form through the description and figure above referred to.
512 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

are chiefly known as earth snakes; the scientific name is Uropeltide.
They are almost worm-like in appearance and have a cylindrical body
and asmall head not distinct from the neck, small eyes, and the cleft of
the mouth is of moderate width or much more restricted than in ordi-
nary snakes. The tailis very short and truncated and terminates in “a
rough shield, which is rounded, square, and more or less bicuspid, or
flat with the caudal scales more or less keeled, or somewhat tapering,
with a small terminal scute, which is 1—2 pointed, or with a horizontal
ridge.” It is in allusion to this terminal shield that the name Uropel-
tide owes its origin. The species of the family have their headquarters
in “the western ranges of mountains from the Canara to Cape Comorin,
only one species having been found on the mountains of the east coast,
and only three north of the Kudra Mukh in South Canara, on the west
side; some few only are widely distributed, others are exceedingly local
and appear to be very rare in their localities.” The species are further
“peculiar to the mountainous districts or to the heavy forests at the
immediate foot of the mountains.” In such places, ‘they burrow into
the ground, and are often dug up about coffee and tea estates; but they
can always be collected by turning over logs and large stones in the
forest, and even on the grass land at high elevation, and during the
rainy season they are not unfrequently found along the roads. They
are generally of small size (about 1 foot long) with a girth of scarcely
an inch.” The greatest length as yet known was reached by a Silybura,
and was 24 inches. The maximum girth (3 inches) was realized in an-
other species of the genus Uropeltis. ‘They never attempt to bite, how-
ever much they may be handled or teased; they will at once twine them-
selves tightly round a stick, and can be carried along without their at-
tempting to escape. They are all ovoviviparous; they live almost en-
tirely upon earth worms.” The various species have been collected and
comparatively studied by Col. R. H. Beddome, and he recognizes seven
generic types and thirty-nine species ; of these most have the tail trun-
cated, but in severalit tapers backwards. The genera are chiefly marked
by peculiarities of the caudal or terminal shields. Nineteen of the spe-
cies belong to one genus (Silybura), while only one is recognized of the
typical genus (Uropeltis). (Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist. (5), xv, pp.
3-33.)

Birds.

The cubital coverts of birds.—Along the preaxillary portions of the
wings of birds, or close by the bones of the arm, are developed small
feathers more or less imbricated, known as cubital coverts. ‘ A refer-
ence to the wing of the Golden Plover, a central type, and one that
in itself represents all the leading modifications,” says Mr. Goodchild,
‘‘may help to make the nomenclature” used by him the ‘more intel-
ligible.” The “terms used referred mainly to the relations of various
parts of the wings to each other and to the body axis, when the wing is -
\

ZOOLOGY. ito

extended and is viewed from the dorsal or upper surface. The wing-
surface is primarily divided into the manual (primary) region and the
cubital (secondary) region, this last embracing all the feathers that
originate from any part of the forearm or cubitus.” Of the manual re-
gion, Mr. Goodchild has nothing to say. “In the cubital region the
remiges, and the greater coverts that come on next above them, are uni-
form in disposition in all carinate birds. In these feathers the overlap
is uniformly distal; that is to say, the several feathers are disposed in
such a manner that the outer free edges of those nearer the vertebral
axis overlap the inner edges of those originating near the distal-ex-
tremity of the wing. The same observation applies also (but with some
minor modifications of detail) to the lesser coverts, or those feathers that
mainly originate in the patagium, and that extend along the anterior
border of the wing from the humeral fold to the carpal joint. The re-
maining feathers, which are generally comprehended under the term
median coverts, vary considerably in both their direction of imbrication
and in the number of rows that run parallel to the greater coverts in
each case.” The object of Mr. Goodchild was to consider “the nature
and the extent of the variation referred to, without regard to the
morphological details of any other kind soever.” Many of the facts
signalized by him “have either not been noticed, or else, if they
have been noticed, their significance appears to have been missed.”
For convenience of description, the tract occupied by the median cov-
erts has been divided by Mr. Goodchild into “three areas by lines
parallel to the main direction of the cubital quills.” (1) The area near-
est the vertebral axis is referred to as “the proximal area;” (2) that
next is called the “middle area,” and (3) the remaining ‘up to the
distal border next the manual region” is distinguished as the “distal
area.” The “rows of feathers composing the median coverts range, in
a general way, parallel with the greater coverts; the number of rows
varies from one to six, or even more, in different forms of birds; and
the row nearest the greater coverts is the one most subject to variation
in the disposition of the feathers composing it.”

Many of the results reached by Mr. Goodchild in his investigations
are interesting. While some bring additional confirmation to the views
accepted by systematists of the relations of various birds, others con-
travene such views and may possibly indicate affinities other than have
been accepted.

The passerine style of imbrication represents one system of arrange-
ment well exemplified by the wing of the’'thrush or migratory robin.
In the crows, “an approach toward a somewhat different mode of ar-
rangement is made,” and “another minor modification is seen in the
Alaudide” or larks. ‘The swallows all appear to follow the normal
passerine type,” but that of the swifts appears to be essentially different.

With reference to the mooted question of the propriety of the group-

514 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

ing of the humming-birds with the swifts, Mr. Goodchild has something
to say.

Mr. Goodchild examined the whole of the Gould collection of hum-
ming-birds, and “ checking the results by comparing them with those
made on a large series of other specimens,” he was “ convinced that one
general type of wing-pattern characterizes the whole of these birds; it
is of a very simple character,” and distinguished by the fact that ‘ the
proximal lapping row of median coverts found throughout all the pas-
seres is absent entirely” in the humming-birds. These “ might, indeed,
be described as possessing no median coverts at all, the place of these
being taken up by feathers having the same mode of imbrication as the
lesser coverts. All the feathers of each series overlap outwards and
backwards from the vertebral axis towards the distal end of the wing
in these birds.”

Comparison of the swifts with the humming-birds was significant.
‘Observations on the order of overlap in the wing of freshly killed
specimens of Cypselus apus, afterwards extended by an examination of
the whole series of swifts in the national collection, showed that in these,
as in the humming-birds, no one series of feathers overlaps backward.
In fact the wing-pattern in the genera Cypselus, Acanthylis, Chetura,
and Collocalia” seemed to him to ‘differ in no essential respect from
that found throughout the trochilide. So far as the disposition of the
wing coverts is concerned, the swifts and humming-birds agree among
themselves, and differ from all of the Passeriform birds, with the pos-
sible exception of the birds of paradise.”

The gallinaceous birds, according to Mr. Goodchild, rank “near to
the accipitrine,” and ‘perhaps leading away from them somewhere
near the Polyborine birds.” In the case of the turkey (Meleagris)
“proximal overlap characterizes nearly all the mediau cubital coverts,
as in the Accipitrines,” and in this respect ‘the turkey stands alone
amongst the Galline;” but neither in the turkey “nor in any one of the
Alecteropods do any traces of the upper wing-coverts exist.”

Among the pigeons it is interesting to note that the large goura is
distinguished from the ordinary pigeons by some well-marked charac-
ters. The cubital covering exemplified in the goura approaches that of
the curassows and is very different from that of the typical pigeons.
The differences appears to Mr. Goodchild to be ‘ both striking and sig-
nificant,” and he has correlated the differences observed in the cubital
coverts with other characters.

(1) “In the normal pigeons an oil-gland is present; but is absent in
Goura.”

(2) “In the normal pigeons the tail-feathers are 12 in number; while
there are 16 in Goura.”

(3) ‘Inthe normal pigeons the pterylosis is columbine; and is galline
in Goura.”

(4) “In the normal pigeons ceca are present; but are absent in
Goura.” .

a

ZOOLOGY. 515

(5) **In the normal pigeons a gall-bladder is present; no gall-bladder
in Goura.”

(6) “In normal pigeons incubation lasts 16 days, but extends to 28
days in Goura.”

In view of these characters there seems to be no doubt that Goura is the
type of a family quite distinct from the Columbide and the rest of the
columbine birds. It is noteworthy that, excepting Goura, the ptero-
graphic characters of the Columb are remarkably uniform throughout.

The family Pteroclide has been generally approximated to the co-
lumbine series. Pterocles arenarius “shows an arrangement of the
wing-feathers somewhat like that of the pigeons, especially so far as
the proximal and the distal areas of the cubital region are concerned.
But the distal imbrication of all the feathers next the manual region is,
in the Pterocletes, carried to excess. In this respect the Pterocletes
stand as far removed from the pigeons as these are from the Galline.”

With regard to the shore or wading birds, it is remarked that “if we
start with the Plovers as the representatives of the order,” the ptero-
graphical characters ‘nearly approach those of the pigeons.” And
‘from the central forms of the Limicole, nearly all the modifications of
style observable in the Carinate could be traced without difficulty.”
Thus, ‘in one direction, and at no remote distance from the Plovers,
we come to the Rails;” in another “ gradations equally gentle conduct
us to the Gulls and the Terns.” Again, ‘“‘along another line of modifica-
tion we arrive at the Cranes. The Storks again stand at no great dis-
tance.” Further, ‘each of the forms here mentioned, in turn, leads to
others more distantly removed from the central type.”

Sometimes curious resemblances appear; thus, ‘‘ between the style
of the median cubital coverts in Leptoptilus,” one of the Storks, and
that of the turkey buzzards, or cathartids, Mr. Goodchild ‘failed to de-
tect any difference of importance in respect of the feature specially un-
der notice. ‘So far as the imbrication of the wing-coverts is concerned,
Leptoptilus and the Cathartide might even stand in the same family.”

On the other hand, some forms which agree closely with others in
structure differ considerably in the eubital covering. One of these is
the common Osprey or Pandion and another is the Kite or Milvus.

The conclusions of Mr. Goodchild are very temperate and judicious.
“In regard to any conclusions connected with taxonomy that may be
drawn from a study of the facts herein referred to, there will probably
be much difference of opinion.” But ‘“‘ there can be little doubt, also,
that up to a certain point there is a remarkable correlation of particu-
lar styles of imbrication of the cubital coverts with certain structural
characteristics—osteological, myological, visceral, and pterographical;
so that, within certain limits, the disposition of the cubital coverts may
be taken as a kind of index to the presence, or the absence, of deeper
seated characters whose importance in relation to taxonomy is gener-
ally recognized.” (Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1886, pp. 184-203.)

A new check-list of North American birds.—When the “American Or-
nithologists’ Union” was organized, in September, 1883, a resolution was
passed “ that the chairman appoint a committee of five, including him-
self, to which shall be referred the question of a revision of the classifi-
cation and nomenclature of the birds of North America.” The gentle-
men appointed on this committee were Dr. Elliot Coues, Mr. J. A. Allen,
Mr. Robert Ridgway, Mr. William Brewster, and Mr. H. W. Henshaw.
These were also materially assisted by Mr. Leonhard Stejneger. The
result of the deliberations of the committee was published in 1886 un-
der the title of “The Code of Nomenclature and Check-list of North
American Birds, adopted by the American Ornithologists’ Union.” The
work thus published differs considerably from its predecessors. The
‘‘ principles, canons, and recommendations” for nomenclature were con-
sidered at length and have been published as a portion of the volume.
Those most essential are three. ‘Canon 13” premises that ‘“zodlogical
nomenclature begins at 1758, the date of the tenth edition of the ‘Systema
nature’ of Linneus;” “ Canon 42” provides that ‘the basis of a generic or
subgeneric name is either (1) a designated, recognizably described spe-
cies, or (2) a designated, recognizable plate or figure, or (3) published di-
agnosis;” “Canon 43” further proclaims that ‘“ the basis of a specific or
subspecific name is either (1) an identifiable published description, or
(2) a recognizable published figure or plate, or (3) the original type,
specimen, or specimens absolutely identified as the type or types of the
species or subspecies in question.”

It was likewise provided that a system of trinomial nomenclature
should be adopted, where such was required, under the regulation of
canon 11. That canon states “ Trinomial nomenclature consists in ap-
plying to every individual organism, and to the aggregate of such or-
ganisms known now to undergrade in physical characteristics, three
names, one of which expresses the subspecific distinctness of the organ-
isms from all other organisms, and the other two of which express re-
spectively its specific indistinctness from or generic identity with certain
other organisms; the first of these names being the subspecific, the
second the specific, and the third the generic designation; the three,
written consecutively, without the intervention of any other word, term, |
or sign, constituting the technical name of any subspecifically distinct
organism.”

The names adopted in consonance with these several canons are ar-
ranged in a different sequence from any previous list, and in fact the
lists previously published by the Smithsonian Institution and Dr. Coues
are practically inverted, the intention being to commence with the gen-
eralized types, and proceed to the more specialized and highly devel-
oped ones. It has for this purpose been assumed that the previously
recognized relations were approximately correct, and that only an in-
version was needed to present the system in its new phase. It will
probably be found hereafter, however, that the exigencies of classifica-
ZOOLOGY. 51%

tion have not been yet successfully disposed of. The species embraced
within the North American fauna are referred to sixty-six families and
seventeen orders. These orders, it must be always remembered, have
much less taxonomical value than the orders of other classes of the ani-
mal kingdom, and are in fact probably more nearly of the value of what
have been called super-families. It may also be added that the families
of passerine birds have been accepted with approximately the limits gen-
erally conceded to them, and consequently the species of the passerine
group occurring within the limits treated of are referred to as many as
twenty families, but of these few have tangible characters. The series
of families commences with the three of the order Pygopodes and termi-
nates with the Passerine. As many as seven hundred and sixty-eight
species of birds are recognized as belonging to the North America
fauna, and besides these there are numerous subspecies. A so-called
“hypothetical list” is added, including the names of twenty-six species
which have been at various times ascribed to the North American fauna,
but which, for varions reasons, are now excluded, although some of them

may hereafter be legitimately added.

Recent abundance of a little-known Shearwater.—Only a few years ago
(in 1881) a previously unknown species of Shearwater was discovered off
the coast of Massachusetts, and made known from a single specimen
by Mr. Cory. It was named Puffinus borealis and it has become popu-
larly known as Cory’s Shearwater. Not a single other specimen had
been obtained since, until the summer of 1886.. Towards the end of
September, however, herring approached the shore in great numbers,
from Point Judith to Buzzard’s Bay, and Vineyard Sound, and in their
wake were enormous numbers of Shearwaters and Jaegers, and singu-
larly enough the Shearwater proved to be aimost exclusively the rare
Puffinus borealis ; among them, however, werea few of the Puffinus Strick-
landi, but none of the Puffinus major. “The Shearwater occurred in
flocks of perhaps from fifty to two or three hundred, the bunches being
generally found quietly resting on the water, and feeding, while swim-
ming, upon the herrings that were so abundant in the vicinity. They
were very tame, but approach to them could be best made by a steam-
launch, which would almost run over them before they would start to
fly. A dozen birds were killed by the discharge of two guns from a
Jaunch. About a hundred specimens were secured, and thousands
could easily have been killed if necessary.” Subsequently, the Shear-
water remained along with the herring and occurred “ abundantly off
Gay Head, Menemsha Bight, Cuttyhunk, and elsewhere, both in Vine-
yard Sound and Buzzard’s Bay.” The previously excessively rare
Shearwater will consequently be hereafter in most of the principal
ornithological cabinets, for large numbers were obtained for that pur-
pose. (Auk IV, pp. 71-72.)

Mammals.

The eggs of Tachyglossus.—It was noticed last year that the spiny ant-
eater or Tachyglossus of Australia has been found to be oviparous and
ZOOLOGY. 519

to carry a single egg in a marsupium or pouch. Professor Ramsay has
given some additional information in regard to the egg, the pouch, and
the characteristics of the mother at the time of ovulation. His observa-
tions were based upon four females. On examining the pouch of one
he found therein “an egg, white in color, and about half an inch in
length, having a rather tough skin,” and with very little lime in it, and
on the whole, much like a reptile’s egg; it is oval and equally rounded
at the respective ends. ‘The pouch was much warmer than the body
of the echidna generally,” and Prof. Ramsay was surprised to notice the
degree of warmth when he put his fingers in it. ‘The pouch entirely
disappears, or rather does not appear at all, until the parent is about
to lay her egg.” The mother “showed great resentment at being ex-
amined,” and, ‘“‘on placing her in a cask of sand she at once burrowed
out of sight, covering herself with sand to a depth of 4 inches.” In
captivity all animals were “fed on fresh milk, sweetened with a little
sugar, and some bread crumbs added.” Some became tame very soon,
and readily went after the milk; others did not drink except when their
keeper was out of sight. (Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist. (5), xv1, p. 479.)

The embryo of the armadillos.—Until comparatively lately but little
was known concerning the embryology of the edentate mammals, but
information has been gradually accumulating, and we are now aec-
quainted with the outlines of the development of each living type of the
order.

Some additional information respecting the foetal stages of the arma-
dillos has been published by Dr. H. von Ihering. Dr. von Ihering’s
researches were chiefly based upon the Praopus hybridus, a southern
Brazilian species. It appears that ‘** several foetuses—six or more—are
inclosed in a single chorion, which is surrounded by as many zonary
placentz as there are foetuses;” the zones thus constituted are not,
however, perfect. It appears that the ungual phalanges in the embryo
differ from those of the adult in that they are “ wide and hoof-shaped
with a trilobate margin,” instead of being long and claw-shaped, as they
are in later life. This fact is of special interest, inasmuch as it recalls
characteristics exemplified in the gigantic extinct relations of the arma-
dillos known as Gyptodonts. Another very interesting feature is the
apparent development of a male organ in every individual of the litter,
thus apparently corroborating a popular idea that the young are always
males. Perhaps however in this case we have an analogy of a feature
exemplified in the striped hyena, in which the clitoris is so excessively
developed as to simulate the male organ. (Kosmos, —; and Am. Nat.,
XX, pp. 667-678.)

Alternation of generations in armadillo.—Dr. H. von Ihering has
shown that in the armadillos known as Praopus eight embryos result
from a single germ; and having considered this fact in connection with
520 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

others furnished by the animal kingdom, he has enunciated some rather
curious propositions to which he was led.

According to Dr. von Ihering, “in all groups twins may oecur from
one ovum; the polar bodies are morphologically nothing less than
abortive germs; in fact, the origin of the multiple embryos from a sin-
gle ovum is the primitive condition; the development of only one is
the secondary and adaptive. Now if this be pressed to its logical con-
clusion,” continues Dr. von Ihering, ‘one would be forced to the para-
doxical conclusion that the Praopus, for instance, brings forth grand-
children, and that the mother of twins trom one ovum is really their
grandmother.” If this beso, the categories previously admitted in the
schemes of development are evidently insufficient, and Dr. von Ihering
has proposed a revised classification, as follows:

I. ‘*Hologenous Development (Haeckels’ hypogenesis). The fertil-
ized ovum develops with or without metamorphosis into a single indi-
vidual.

II. “* Merogenous Development. The fertilized ovum develops into
two or more individuals, which

A. “return directly to the parent form and mode of reproduction
( Temnogenesis), or,

B. * exhibit an antithesis of diversely reproducing individuals or gen-
erations (Metagenesis, or Alternation of Generations)

(a) * Calycogenesis in Salpe and Medusa,

(b) ‘+ Pedogenesis in Cecidomye,

(c) “‘ Heterogenesis, in which either both generations reproduce sex-
ually or one or several multiply parthenogenetically.” (Biol. Centralbl.,
VI, pp. 532-539; J. R. M.S. (2), vu, p. 44.)

The species of Manatee.—A few years ago a species of Manatee was
described as peculiar to the headwaters of the Amazon. The speci-
mens on which the species was based were obtained in the early part
of the century by Dr. Natterer, but for many years it had remained unde-
scribed. This species and the other representatives of the genus have
been recently investigated by Dr. C. Hartlaub. The result of Dr. Hart-
laub’s examination of all the specimens accessible to him of the family of
Manatees is a confirmation of the species indicated, Manatus (rather
Trichechus) trunguis and the ascertaining of good characters. Two
other of the formerly recognized species are admitted, and for them the
names senegalensis and latirostris are retained. The former, as is of
course indicated by the name, is of African origin, and the latter oc-
curs in the West Indies and along the Florida coast. For the details
of the differences between the various species, reference must be made
to the memoir of Dr. Hartlaub in the ‘“ Zoologische Jahrbiicher.”
Here it can only be stated that the differences are well marked in the
young as well as in the adult. Some of the most salient are the differ-
ences in the width and extension of the facial bones, the character of
ZOOLOGY. 521

the ribs and zygomatic arches, and the size of the teeth. The molars
of T. senegalensis are especially remarkable on account of the large size
and the extension of the series forwards, while in the American spe-
cies they are much smaller and the series terminate considerably in
frontof the antorbital foramina or under the zygomatic processes. There
can be no question that the three species thus recognized at least are
perfectly distinct. (1) Under the African species for which the name
Manatus senegalensis is retained, the Trichechus manatus of Linneus
and the Manatus nasutus and M. Vogeliti are embraced. (2) The com-
mon American species is called Manatus latirostris, aud to the species
for which this name is retained are referred the Manatus americanus
and M. australis of most authors, but not the 7. australis of Shaw. (3)
The third species is the Manatus inunguis. _ Individuals of the species
have been known but have been confounded by previous authors with
the common American species. (Zool. Jahrbiicher, 1886.)

ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1886.

By Oris T. Mason.

INTRODUCTION.

In this introduction to the progress of anthropological work in 1886,
attention will be drawn to comprehensive suinmaries, courses of lect-
ures, and description of instrumentalities. It is well known that origi-
nal investigation, instruments of precision and research, and philosoph-
ical discussions are three distinct elements of progress in any science,
which are mutually dependent, which severally move forward in a line
marked out by the other two, and whose momentum is decided by
dynamic and kinetic forces regulated by the other two. The final
stage of progress is instruction, whereby the results of investigation
are popularized and became part and parcel of universal thought and
action.

Instruction in anthropology is better organized in Paris than in any
other city. By this it is not designed to say that anthropological re-
search of the highest order is confined to the French capital. What is
emphasized is this, that in the Ecole d’Anthropologie and other public
lectures the French anthropologists have come to realize the crowning
function of any science.

The course in the Keole in 1885~86 included the following subjects
and lectures:

(1) Zoological anthropology, by Dr. Mathias Duval. Programme:
Anthropogeny and comparative embryology; the blastoderm and the
first phases of development.

(2) General anthropology, by Dr. Paul Topinard. Programme: Type
and race. Part I, races of Europe from prehistoric times to our day;
Part II, succession and transformation of races in time, their past and
their future.

(3) Ethnology, by Dr. Dally. Programme: Ethnic craniology; nor-
mal and abnormal skulls; prehistoric anthropology, by M. Gabriel de
Mortillet; tertiary man; origin of man; medical geography, by Dr.
Bordier. General action of environment.

(4) History of civilizations, by Dr. Letourneau. Evolution and eth-
nology of ethics. The course of linguistics had been given in the pre-

vious summer.

The minister of public instruction added to the course in the Ecole
des Hautes Etudes a fifth section on the science of religion. To show
the scope of these lectures the programme is added:

Religions of India, by M. Bergaigne. Religion of Egypt, by M.
Lefebure. Religions of the Far East, by M. de Rosny. Semitic Re-

The Inconographic Encyclopedia.—The second volume of this publi-
cation is based on von Eye’s Culturgeschichte, but has a chapter on pré-
historic archeology, by Prof. Daniel G. Brinton, which doubles the value
of the original work. We have no hesitaticn in placing this article at
the head of all compendiums upon this subject. The method of treat-
ment is historical. The introductory chapter is devoted toa sketch of
the science and the methods and problems which have for the past
quarter of a century engaged the minds of archeologists. The char-
acteristics and art production of the European age of stone in its two
periods, the palzolithic and neolithic; the age of bronze and the age
of iron are treated in the first fifty pages.

ARCH HZ OLOGY.

One of the most thorough archeological investigations ever under-
taken is that of Professor Putnam, of Cambridge, and Dr. C. L. Metz,
in the mounds of the Little Miami Valley, especially in the Marriott and
the Turner Group. The minute account of these diggings will occupy
a Separate memoir, but in the eighteenth and nineteenth annual report
of Peabody Academy enough is told to give a clear outline of the work.
The scientific value of this exploration is due to the method, to the ap-
plication of detailed biological processes throughout. Not only is every
ounce of earth passed backward through a screen or sieve, but the ex-
plorers have made some of their best finds beneath the original surface.
Dr. Whitney has made a study of the human bones and reports the
lesions to belong to three classes: (1) Anomolies or variations from
type; (2) those that have followed from injuries; (3) those resulting
from disease.

The archeolgical explorations of the Bureau of Ethnology were still
under the direction of Mr. Cyrus Thomas, and not only embraced the
United States, but extended southward through Mexico and Central
America,

Recognizing the value of geographical distribution as a concept in
dealing with archeological phenomena, Major Powell has devised a
scheme of conventions for the archexologic cartography of North Amer-
ica. This is published in his fourth annual report of the Bureau of
Ethnology and should be adopted at once by all who write upon Amer-
ican archeology.

A work on archeology of which the year may justly feel proud is
that of M. Emile Cartailhae upon the prehistoric age of Spain and
Portugal, the result of a scientific mission under the patronage of the
minister of public instruction of France. The Iberian peninsula is one
of the most favored spots in the world for gaining a view of the whole

industrial history of humanity. Let us commence by following M. Ri-

biero, who in 1866 found in the tertiary beds of the valley of Otta white
and colored quartzites, some showing that spalls had been knocked off,
others worked or fashioned. These are described at length and figured
by M. Cartailhac.

The paleolithic periods of the quaternary shell-heaps, the caverns and
lake dwellings of the neolithic period, and the extraordinary structures
of the bronze and early iron age, bridge over the time between the man
of Otta and the historic period.

Professor Virchow reports in Archiv fiir Anthrop. (xvi, 275-475) the
result of the investigation by the Anthropological Society of Germany
on the color of the skin, the hair, and the eyes among school children.
In the second meeting of this society (1871) at Schwerin a plan was
adopted for collecting statistics of crania. The next year Dr. Ecker pro-
posed the study of the size of the body and the color of hair and eyes.
Finally, in 1873, Dr. Virchow proposed, at Weisbaden, the consideration
of the subject of blondes and brunettes, through the schools. ‘The fol-
lowing scheme was sent out:

A series of volumes is being published in Paris entitled Bibliothique

Ethnologique.

The first of this series printed in 1886, though bearing

date of the following year, is by de Quatrefages, and bears the special

title “‘ Introduction a ’étude des races humaines.”

Though apparently

a work on ethnology simply, it really covers the whole field of antbro-
pology, as the following headings of chapters will show :

(1) Regne humain. Does man form a kingdom of nature ?
(2) Unity of the human species.
(3) Origin of the human species.

(4) Antiquity of the human species ; fossil races; survival of fossil races.

(5) Geographical origin of the human species.
(6) The peopling the globe.

(7) Acclimation of the human species.

(8) Primitive man, antiquity of ethnic types.
(9) Formation of human races.

(10) General ethnic characteristics.

(11) Physical characteristics.

(12) Intellectual characteristics.

Being a pronounced monogenist the author brings his theory into
gzontrast with that of the polygenists in the scheme.

MONOGENISM.

All men belong to one and ithe same
species.

The differences which distinguish hu-
man groups are racial characters.

At what epoch did this single species
appear on the surface of the globe? The
question of antiquity is simple.

The human species first occupied only a
circumscribed area of the globe. Thereis
then a question of geographic origin to
resolve.

The globe was peopled by migrations of
which we have to search the traces and
reconstruct the history.

To-day there probably exists no au-
techthonous people. America in partic-
ular and Polynesia were peopled only by
colonists.

The human species inhabit to-day the
3ntire globe, the pole as well as the equa-

H. Mis. 600 ot

POLYGENISM.

There are several species of men.

These differences are like specific char-
acters.

At what epoch have appeared the dif-
ferent human species? Have they arisen
simultaneously or successively? The
question of antiquity is multiple.

The different species have first appeared
on the spots where history announced
their discovery. The question of geo-
graphic origin does not exist.

Migrations count for nothing in the
general peopling of the earth. The ques-
tion of primitive migration does not exist.
The emigrations of which history has
preserved the memory are exceptional
and have exercised only an insignificant
influence over the geographical distribu-
tion of peoples.

Excepting the European colonies
founded in our day and those recorded in
history, almost the entire globe has been
peopled by autochthones. Specially, all
the peoples of America and Polynesia
were and could only be the products of
the soil where modern explorers have
found them.

The human peoples constituting somany
species originating on the spot were made
530

tor. It has, therefore, subjected itself to
the most diverse environments. The ques-
tion of acclimation in its widest and in its
most special sense is necessarily raised.

In these migrations the human species
exposed tothe action of new environments
could but be modified. This explains the
forma‘ion of a certain number of races.
Facts of the same nature passing in our
day ought to arrest in a special manner
the attention of anthropologists.

Crosses between human races in the past
have given rise to races whose origin has
been revealed by mixed characters im-
printed by the parent types. We have to
search the ethnic elements combined in
peoples of this class.

Crosses between human races most di-
verse take place under our eyes. They
have given birth to population, which en-
larges from day to day and becomes more
and more developed. The study of these
populations presents a double and serious
interest in that it teaches us concerning
the past and permits us to look into the
future.

All present populations have been more
or less modified, either by environments
or by crossing. The primitive type of
humanity is lost. Even did it now exist
we could not recognize if in default of
knowledge. Nevertheless, is it not possi-
ble to trace out some of the marks which
would characterize it?

M. de Quatrefages justly draws attention to the fact that the argu-—
ment between the monogenists and polygenists seems to leave out of ©

PSYCHOLOGY.

Dr. Alexander Bain read at the last meeting of the British Associa-
tion, a paper on the scope of anthropology and its relations to the science
of mind. Says this distinguished authority: ‘The mode of research
grounded on discriminative sensibility, and working up from that, ac-
cording to the best known principles of our intellectual nature may be
contrasted with another mode which has always been in vogue, namely,
finding out and noting any surprising feats that animals can perform
out of all proportion to what we should be Jed to expect of them.

“The spirit of such inquiries is rather to defy explanation than to pro-
mote it. They delight to nonplus and puzzie the scientific investigator
whe is working his way upward by slow steps to the higher mysteries.
Before accounting for the exceptional gifts of animals—the geniuses of a
tribe,—we should be able to prove the average and recurring capabil-
ities.

‘‘Tf is an error to suppose the mental qualities do notadmit of measure-
ment. No doubt the higher complex feelings of the mind are incapable
of being statea vith numerical precision, yet by a proper mode of ap-
proaching the suv,°ct a very considerable degree of accuracy is at-
tainable,
532 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

“ As to the present position of the science of mind in the British Asso-
ciation, it is nowhere. Taken in snatches, it appears in several places ;
it would come in under zoology, which embraces all that relates to
animals; under physiology, in connection with the nervous system and
the senses, and it figures still more largely, although in an altogether
subordinate and scarcely acknowledged fashion, in the section on an-
thropology. Indeed, to exclude it from this section would beimpossible;
man is nothing without his mind. Now, while zoology and physiology
would keep the study of mind within narrow limits, there is no such
narrowness in the present section. In the ample bosom of anthropology
any really valuable contribution to the science of mind should have a
natural place.

‘¢ Psychology has now a very large area of neutral (non-eontroversial)
information; it possesses materials gathered by the same methods of
rigorous observation and instruction that are followed in the other
sciences. The researches of this section exemplify some of these. If
these researches are persisted in they will go still further into the heart
of psychology as a science and the true course will be to welcome all
the new experiments for determining mental facts with precision and to
treat psychology as an acknowledged member of the section. To this
subdivision would then be brought the researches into the brain and
nerves that deal with mental functions; the experiments on the senses
having reference to our sensations; the whole of the present mathe-
matics of man, bodily and mentally; the still more advanced inquiries
relating to our intelligence; and the nature of emotion as illustrated
by expression in the manner of Darwin’s famous treatise. Indeed, if
you were to admit such a paper as that contributed by Mr. Spencer to
the Anthropological Institute you would commit yourself to a much
further raid on the ground of psychology than is implied in such an
enumeration as the foregoing.”

Experimental psychology is the application of instruments of precis-
ion to human thinking and acting, and in the last few years has become
one of the most fascinating branches of anthropology. Professor
Wundt, in Leipzig, has pursued this study most systematically in a
laboratory especially fitted up for the purpose. A quarterly publication,
Philosophische Studien, is devoted mainly to publishing the work of
this laboratory.

The studies relate to the powers of the mind in various directions, as
memory, judgment, ete., but especially to the re-action time of various
operations. Dr. J. M. Cattell, an American student, has examined this
class of phenomena in three groups: (1) The re-action time, which is sim-
ply the time after the application of a sense stimulus necessary for an
individual to record the fact that he has received the sersation; (2) the
distinction or perception time, which is the addition?” time necessary for
him to appreciate the nature of the sensation; e. g., whether a light was
red or blue; (3) the choice or will time, which is the additional time

necessary to react in a certain way on the reception of a certain sensa-
tion; e.g, to press a key with the right hand when the red light appears,
with the left hand or not at all for the blue light. The following sum-
mary gives results:

The most extensive contribution is that of Dr. J. M. Cattell, recount-
ing experiments made in the Psychological Laboratory of the University
of Leipzic. (v. Psychometrische Untersuchungen [Doctor’s Disserta-
tion], von James McKean Cattell, pp. 72. Reprinted in Wandt’s
Philosophische Studien, 111, 2 and 3, and abridged in Mind, 1886; v.
also Brain). This observer has re-investigated almost the entire field ,
has improved the method of research, and introduced new variations
in the experiments. (1) For simple re-action-times Dr. Cattell uses
a iagnetic falling screen which at a definite point in its fall reveals a
card or a color, conveys a shock to the finger, or arouses any sense-
organ that is desired; it simultaneously releases the magnet of a Hipp
chronoscope (strictly regulated by finding the most suitable electric
currents for its release), while the observer re-acts by closing a key, or
speaking into a tube, which, like the hand-key, instantly stops the clock.
The time to see daylight was found quite constant and 1516 (o= 7,55 of
a second) in one observer, 147¢ in the other, if the hand-key is used in-
differently with the right or left hand; the lip key takes 300 longer.
’ He can also measure how long a coior, etc., must be seen to make any
impression; this latent time is for orange, .80; yellow, lo; b'ue, 1.20;
red, 1.30; green, 1.40; violet, 236. Distracting the attention by dis-
turbing sounds had little effect on the time, which unusual result is ex-
plained by the great automaticity of the process. Add’ng numbers
lengthens the time; extreme attention maintainable for only one second
shortens it. (2) Perception-times. The additional time necessary for
recognizing whiteness and sending out the voluntary impulse was for
’ the two observers 61o¢ and 9506, which time is divided equally between
the two operations, as in (1) the closing of the key was automatic. To
see that acolor is or is not black requires a slightly longer time. To
distinguish one of two colors required 100 and 110¢ in the two observers;
one of ten colors, 105and 1176. It thus takes 5.8o longer to distinguish
one of ten than one of two colors, but 33¢ longer to say what the color

38o. HE is the most difficult letter to read; M A ZB E was the order
of ease in the five letters used. The time for short English words was
1426, being slightly longer for longer or for foreign words. The word
is the reading unit, requiring only a slightly longer time for its recog-
nition than for that of a single letter. It takes less time to recognize
a small picture than a short word. (3) Choice-time. To act with the
right hand for one color, and with the left for another, lengthens the time
by 266. To re-act by naming (7. é., reading) a letter requires 4000; a
one-place numeral 3606, 3936 for a two-place, and 4186 for a three-place,
the increase in time diminishing. It takes longer to read (not pro-
nounce) long than short, foreign than vernacular words. It actually
takes only 1116 or 500 less to name a short word than a letter, indicating
the closeness of the association between the name and the word. A
color is seen quickly, but to name it requires 3430; a picture can be
named in about equal time. By way of summary we have:

Dr. Cattell also shows that extreme attention can shorten central pro-
cesses; that the effect of practice is marked at first, but soon reaches a
limit as automatism sets in; that fatigue is not so easily induced or so
disturbing as usually thought. In a later research (Mind, January,
1837) he adds the following: To give the name of the picture of an ob-
ject in a foreign language (English for German, and vice versa) took
6496 and 6946, respectively, or 172¢ and 149¢ longer than in the ver.
nacular. This suggests a mode of gauging one’s acquaintance with a
foreign tongue. It similarly takes longer to translate from the foreign
to the vernacular than the reverse. Given a city to name the country in
which it is situated required 4000; given a month to name the following

“month, 3676; to name the preceding month, as muchas 798o6. Given a
“month to name its season, 3630; the reverse, 4980; showing that it is
easier to go from part to whole than the reverse. To give an action for
a substantive (é. g., swim-fish), 6460; an object for a verb (write-letter),
dl7c. Tojudge the length of a line took nearly one second. In general —
the closer the association the shorter the time; and the more complex
the operation the greater the individual variation.

Tambroni and Algeri observed (L) the time of feeling a contact on the

with various kinds of insanity. The paranoiac re-acts more quickly, all
other forms of alienation more slowly, than normal. When the normal

time is 1836 the paranoiaced time is 1740, the maniacal type is 312<¢,
the demented 3446, the epileptic 3620, the melancholic 374¢—a very

suggestive table.

Guiceardi and Cionini studied the effect of repetition in shortening
the time of simple acts, and conclude that the more complicated the
act the greater abbreviating power has repetition. A simple touch
re-action was shortened 186 by 250 repetitions; distinguishing that a
single point was in contact by 121o0; the time of writing three letters
by 1,956c¢ in 500 repetitions; in associating a word,a difference of
nearly five seconds between the shortest and longest.

Dr. Joseph Jastrow (Science, September 10, 1886, Proceedings of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, XXXV, p. 272)
proposes a simplification of the methods of measuring simple re-action
time, distinction time, choice time, and association time that dispenses
with all apparatus except a watch, packs of cards, and slips of paper,
and is well suited for a class demonstration. The principle throughout
is to have a continuous series of the processes, the time of which is to be
measured, and by dividing, to get the time of a single act. For simple
re-action-times a circle of- persons touch hands, and the time it takes for
a pressure to pass around the circle divided by the number of persons
(after considerable drill) gives a normal re-action time. [This was pre-
viously suggested by Dr. O. W. Holmes.] The perception time is meas-
ured by the difference in time necessary to throw down a pack of cards
one by one, and the time necessary to notice the color, suit, or the like
while throwing. The cards must be held with the backs towards the
subject. The additional choice time is gotten by subtracting the unre-
duced perception-times from the time needed for sorting the cards into
heaps according to suit, color, and so on. For the association time you
first get the sum of the association-times of two observers by subtract-
ing (a) the time for each to call a certain number of words from (b) the
time for one to call 2 word to which the other replies with an associa-

_- tion-word, and in turn gives acall-word to the first, etc., and then group

a third person with each of the two in the same process. This gives
Six equations, from which all the values may be ascertained. ‘The
method is found to be satisfactorily accurate and admits of much varia-
tion and adaptation.

Mr. Francis Galton (A descriptive list of Authropometrical Appa-
ratus) describes an instrument which by the release of a failing rod
on the presentation of the stimulus (to eye, ear, or touch), and by its
being caught again when the subject re-acts to the signal, measures
Simple re-action-times very conveniently and without the need of an
assistant.

In announcing the publication of a journal of psychology, Prof. G.
Stanley Hall outlines the study as it now stands in the minds of ad-
vanced anthropologists.

speculative character have been so widely scattered as to be Jargely
naccessible save to a very few, and often to be overlooked by them.
Several departments of science, often so distinet from each other that
their contributions are not mutually known, have touched and enriched
psychology, bringing to it often their best methods and their ripest in-
sight. It is from this circumstance that the vast progress made in this
department of late years is so little realized and that the field for such
a journal is so new and the need believed to be so great. The journal
will contain original contributions of a scientific character. These will
consist partly of experimental investigations on the functions of the
senses and brain, physiological time, psychophysic law, images and their
association, volition, innervation, ete., and partly of inductive studies
of instinct in animals, psycho-genesis in children, and the large fields of
morbid and anthropological psychology, not excluding hypnotism and
the field vaguely designated as that of psychic research; and lastly,

cially as developed by the latest methods of staining, section, ete.

ETHNOLOGY.

Ethnology and nationality.—The testimony of ethnology is invoked by
diplomatists with reference to European boundaries and polities, nota-
bly in the settlement of the Turkish problem. What are the bounda-
ries of nationality? To this question various answers have been given.

(1) A nation is an ensemble of people under the same government.

(2) A nation is all the inhabitants of the same region.

(3) A nation comprises all who speak the same language.

(4) A nation includes people of the same race.

At present, says Mr. Topinard, the liviig question is the principle of

nationality resting upon race, words of pleasant sound which flow —

gracefully from the pen of the daily journalist. The same writer
utters a timely caution against the excessive application and draws
attention to the complicated elements which go to make up that
community of right and interest called a nation. (Rev. d’Anthrop.,
38., 1, 24.)

Major Powell, in the preface to the fourth annual report of the
Bureau of Ethnology, divides the work of his bureau into three classes:

(1) A series of charts showing the habitat of all tribes when first met
by Europeans and at subsequent eras.

(2) A dictionary of tribal synonymy, which should refer the multi-
plied and confusing titles, as given in literature and in varying usage,
to a correct and systematic standard of nomenclature.

(3) A classification on a linguistic basis of all known Indians of
North America (remaining and extinct) into families or stocks.

TECHNOLOGY.
‘ Technology, in the anthropological sense, is the natural history of

human arts. Whatever men habitually think about gives rise to spe-
cific industries and arts. The study of the progress of mind through
these arts is a proper study for anthropologists.

An excellent example of research in this direction is afforded by Mr.
Holmes’s papers on pottery in Major Powell’s fourth annual report—
notably by the one on the origin and development of form and ornament
in ceramic art.

Forms of pottery arise as follows:

by adventition
by imitation
by invention

of natural models
of artificial models

Modification of form may arise in many ways:

Suggestions of ideographic features or pictorial delineation.—Professor
Morse’s Japanese Homes is an excellent example of the application of
scientific methods to a human art. Among the elaborations of culture
the habitation has kept itself steadily in harmony with progress,
climate, material, and the ruling ideas of different peoples. A descrip-
tion of the houses and house-life of the races of men would furnish
abundant material for the reconstruction of past history in that regard.

Prof. E. S. Morse has made the method of arrow-release throughout
all times and places a subject of ethnic study. Proceeding to trace the
migrations of men by the movements of a habit, the methods of release
are as follows:

(1) Primary.—The nock of the arrow is grasped between the end of
the straightened thumb and the first and second joints of the bent fore-
finger. It is practiced by children universally, and by the Ainos,
Demeraras, Utes, Navajos, Chippewas, Micmacs, Penobscots.

(2) Secondary.—The nock of the arrow is grasped with the straight-
ened thumb and bent fore-finger, while the ends of the second and third
fingers are brought to bear on the string to assist in drawing. It is
practiced by Zunis, Chippewas of Wisconsin, Ottawas.

(3) Tertiary.—In this release the fore-finger, instead of being bent, is
nearly straight with its tip as well as the tips of the second and third
fingers, pressing or pulling on the string, the thumb, as in the primary
and secondary release, active in assisting in pinching the arrow and |
pulling it back. It is practiced by Sioux, Arapahos, Cheyennes, As-
siniboins, Comanches, Crows, Blackfeet, Navajos, Siamese, Great An-
damanese.

(4) Mediterranean.—The string is drawn back with the tips of the first,
second, and third fingers, the balls of the fingers clinging to the string
with the terminal joints of the fingers slightly flexed. The arrow is
lightly held between the first and second fingers, the thumb straight
and inactive. Practiced by nations around the Mediterranean, by mod-
ern archers, Flemish (using first and second fingers only), Eskimo, Little
Andamanese. |

(5) Mongolian.—In this release the string is drawn by the flexed
thumb bent over the string, the end of the fore-finger assisting in hold-
ing the thumb in position. ‘The thumb is protected by a guard of some
kind. It is practiced by Manchus, Chinese, Coreans, Japanese, Turks,
Persians.

COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGY.

Colonel Mallery’s paper on the pictographs of the North American
Indians fills a gap in the study of the natural history of languages. In
a former paper he discussed the gesture language as perhaps the earliest
method of thought-transference. In the author’s own words, ‘a picto-
graph is a writing by picture.” The execution of the pictures of which it
is composed often exhibits the first crude efforts of graphie art. When  —

‘4
ANTHROPOLOGY. 539

pictures are employed as writing the conception intended to be pre-
sented is generally analyzed, and only its most essential points are in-
dicated, with the result that the characters when frequently repeated
become conventional, and in their later forms cease to be recognizable as
objective portraitures.

A striking example of the interdependence of language and arts is
afforded by Mr. Cushing’s paperon Pueblo pottery. Following up Mr.
Holmes’s investigations into the origin of decoration, the author finds
that these theories are justified by an intimate study of language. In-
deed, the names of certain forms of pottery and decoration as well as of

_ building do not refer to the things as they now exist, but are the ver-

‘

itable designations of things and forms out of which the modern forms
are thought to have sprung.

Origin of languages.—The vice-presidential address of Hon. Horatio
Hale before Section H of the American Association at Buffalo was
upon the origin of languages and the antiquity of speaking man. It
contains views so original and novel that it is eminently proper to pre-
sent a condensed scheme of the argument.

Among the puzzling questions in anthropology which we are bound
to notice are these two: When did linguistic stocks originate? When
did man acquire the faculty of speech? It will be seen that the origin
of languages and the origin of language are two very different questions.

Mr. Hale, rejecting the old theories which rely upon time, the disper-
sion of a monosyllabic parent stock, or the dispersion of speechless man,
and the origination of languages in different centers, avers that the ori-
gin of linguistic stocks is to be found in what may be called the language-
making instincts of very young children... To insure the creation of a
speech which shall be the parent of a new linguistic stock, all that is
needed is that two or more young children should be placed by them-
selves in a condition where they will be entirely, or in a large degree, free
from the presence and influence of their elders, and that they should con-

_ tinue in this condition long enough to grow up and form a household, and

to bave descendants to whom they can communicate their new speech.

This theory is elaborated with great care, and the multiplicity of
stocks in California made a camping-ground of the argument.

The second part of the argument is also accompanied with the revival
of startling doctrines, namely, that while the antiquity of man is incal-
culable, the speaking man is of recent origin, having occupied this
planet not over ten thousand years at most,

If we are willing to give the name of man to a half-brutish being, in-
capable of speech, we must allow to this being an existence of vast and.as
yet undefined duration, shared with the mammoth, the woolly rhinoce-
ros, and other extinct animals. But if we term the beings of that race
the precursors of man and restrict the name of man to the members of
the speaking race that followed them, then the first appearance of man,
540 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

properly so styled, must be dated at about six thousand or ten thousand
years ago. And this man who thus appeared was not a man of feeble
powers, a dull witted savage. He possessed and manifested from the
first intellectual faculties of the highest order, such as none of his de-
. Scendants have surpassed. His speech, we may be sure, was not a
mere mumble of disjointed sounds; it was a full, expressive, well-organ-
ized speech, complete in all its parts. The first men spoke because
they possessed along with the vocal organs the cerebral faculty of
speech; ‘that faculty was an instinct of the mind, as irresistible as any
other instinct.”
MYTHOLOGY AND FOLK-LORE.

The folk-lorists of England have been wrestling for the last three
years with the following questions :

(1) The definition, the inclusions and exclusions of the term folk-lore.

(2) The establishment of classific concepts for the material included.
It is very easy to say, put things together that are alike, but it is most
difficult to settle upon that characteristic of likeness which will combine
our examples into what may be called natural genera, species, etc. Con-
nected with this idea of classific concepts is the associated one of ter.
minology.

(3) The anatomy of tales, customs, practices, etc., and the invention
of a glossary of their organic parts, their dramatis persone, their essen-
tial incidents.

In vol. m1 of the Folk-lore Journal (pp. 1-16), Mr. G. L. Gomme un-
dertakes to answer these questions. He had previously in (vol. 1, pp.
285, 3511) advocated a systematic effort of folk-lorists in the same diree-
tion. <A few definitions are given below to indicate the mental drift of
the gentlemen interested:

‘Volk lore is anthropology dealing with primitive man.” (Alfred Nutt.)
‘ Folk-lore is anthropology dealing with the psychological phenomena
of uncivilized man [meaning unlettered as well as savage], and em-
braces both folk-thought and folk-wont” (practice). (E. Sidney Hartland,
Folk-l., 11, 340.) ‘That portion of anthropology which deals with the
psychological phenomena of primitive man.” (C.Staniland Wake, Folk-1.
J., 11, 345.)

‘ Folk-lore is the unwritten learning of the people. Folk-lore is not
ascience; it isthe thing itself. One ofthe chief objects of the collection
and arrangement of the facts of folk-lore is to generalize and philoso-
phize; but the generalizations which we arrive at will not be folk-lore.”
(Henry B. Wheatley, Folk-lore J., 11, 347.)

“ Wolk-lore deals primarily with the survival of primitive customs and
beliefs among civilized races, and is comparable with, not identical with,
the living primitive customs and beliefs of savage races. The sanction
back of folk-lore is tradition. Folk-lore is the science which treats of
the survivals of archaic beliefs and customs in modern ages.” (G. L.
Gomme, I c. 11, 14.)
ANTHROPOLOGY. 541

“‘Folk-lore, ‘the folk’s learning;’ all that the folk believe or practice on
the authority of inherited tradition and not on the authority of written
records.” (Charlotte S. Burne, Folk-lore J., 011, 103.)

“ Folk-lore is the science which has for its object the study of undif-
ferentiated or anonymous humanity from an epoch which may be con-
sidered its infancy down toourown day.” (Antonio Wachadoy Alvarez,
Folk-lore J., m1, 113.) This whole essay must be read. QOne can not
afford to omit a sentence.

“ Folk-lore is knowledge of folk-life or the life of uncultured classes,
as distinguished from culture lore, knowledge of individualized life,
the life of the cultured classes, and the generalizations arising from
these two knowledges or the sciences of folk-life and of culture-life are
complementary and mutually corrective divisions of the same mental
and moral sciences, the historical sciences, namely, or mental develop-
ment and of civil progress.” (T.S. Stuart Glennie, Folk-lore J., rv., 75.)

We come now to tle second series of questions, the subject of classific
concepts, the study of ** What should go where,” as Miss Charlotte S.
Burne happily puts it.

Mr. E. Sidney Hartland divides folk-lore into two departments, fvlk-
thought and folk-practice, or, still better, folk-wont. I like folk-wont for
the reason that folk-lore does not so much include practice. For in-

- stance, I may tell you how an arrow-maker or potter produces his

ware, and do it so graphically that a mechanic may counterfeit them.
But I have omitted the thousand and one dispensables which the lowly
artisan considered indispensable, leaving them for the folk-lorist to
glean.

Folk-lore is thus divided:

1. Folk-thought: (1) tales of ail kinds, sagas (world-god, hero, elf,
ghost-sagas, etc.), nursery tales drolls, cumulative tales, apologues;
(2) folk-songs; (3) weather-lore; (4) proverbs; (5) local and personal
saws and prophecies; (6) riddles; (7) folk-speech.

2. Folk-wont: (1) worship, every practice designed to propitiate the
powers influencing man’s destiny; (2) folk-law; (3) folk-leechcraft;
(4) games; (5) folk-craft.

Mr. Gomme gives the following scheme:

1. Traditional narratives: (a) folk-tales; (%) hero-tales; (¢c) ballads
and songs; (d) place legends.

2. Traditional customs: (a) local customs; (b) festival customs;
(c) ceremonial customs; (d) games.

3. Superstitions and beliefs: (a) witchcraft; (b) astrology ; (c) super-
stitions, practices, and fancies.

4. Folk-speech: (a) popular sayings; (6) popular nomenclature; (c)
proverbs; (d) jingle rhymes, riddles, ete.

This is amended by Miss Charlotte S. Burne as follows:

Group 1. Traditional narratives: class a, folk-tales; class b, hero-
tales; class c, ballads and songs; class d, place legends and traditions.
542 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Group 2. Superstitions, beliefs, and practices: class a, goblindom;
class 6, witchcraft; class ¢c, astrology; class d, superstitions connected
with material things.

Group 3. Traditional customs: class a, local customs; class b, fes-
tival customs; class c, ceremonial eustoms; class d, games.

Group 4. Folk-sayings: class a, jingle, nursery rhymes, riddles, ete. ;
class b, proverbs; class ¢, old saws, rhymed and unrhymed; class d,
nicknames, place rhymes and sayings, folk-etymology.

Mr. J.8. Stuart Glennie divides the study of man’s history into that
of folk-lore and of culture life. ‘The classification of folk-lore is iden-
tical with the psychological elements of folk-life corresponding (A)
with the most general facts of human consciousness: (1) an external
world, (2) other beings, (3) an ancestral world; (B) and with the most
general facts of human faculty: (1) imagination, (2) affection, (3) mem-
ory. Corresponding with these facts of consciousness and of faculty
the three psychological elements of folk-life are (1) folk-beliefs, (2) folk-
passions, (3) folk-traditions, and the expressions of these are to be
found in (1) customs, (2) sayings, (3) poesy. Folk-customs, as expressive
of fulk-life, may be nore especially expressive of folk-belief or of folk-
passions or of folk-traditions, and hence folk-customs may be classified
as (1) festivals, (2) ceremonies, (5) usages (religious, sexual, and socia)}).
Folk-sayings may be classified as (1) recipes (magical, medical, and
technical), (2) saws (proverbs, tests, riddles), (3) forecasts (omens,
weather signs, and auguries). Folk-poesy may be classified as (1)
stories, (2) songs (mythological, affectional, and historical), and (3)
sagas.

Elements of folk-lore and subjects of folk-lore: (1) Folk-beliefs, (2)
folk-passions, (3) folk-traditions.

The expressions of folk-life and records of folk-lore: (1) folk-customs,

We are not prepared to accept Mr. Glennie’s dictum that folk-lore is
our lore about the folk, for that would really be culture lore, according
to his own definition. Several of the gentlemen have wisely started
their study with the two inquiries, Who are the folk and what is lore?
Senor Alverez remarks, ‘The word folk, German volk, Latin vulgus,
Italian volgo, Sanish vulgo, signifies not the whole of humanity, but a
portion of the human race, who possess a series of common signs, and
are really anonymous in contradistinction from that other series of men
who possess a notable personality.” He would include practically all

savages and the untutored herd of civilized society. It is very certain
that what constitutes the knowings, the sayings, dnd the ways or wonts
of the untutored, the unthinking, and the unprogressive among us, re-
mind us much of savagery. It is also very certain that each age of the
world, each gradus of society, resembles the geological ages; that is, each
one in addition to all that it has added of new, embraces or includes
much of all the antecedent ages, grades, or epochs. The folk-lorists are,
therefore, altogether scientific in collecting the lore of savages en masse,
the lore of barbaric and civilized peoples, so far as they are survivals
of times not their own.

Practically, therefore, what do the folk-lorists wish us to collect, and
how shall we name and classify our material after it is gathered? Just
at this writing we are inclined to use Miss Burne’s modification of Mr.
Gomme’s scheme. For the filing of tales the folk-lore society has adopted
a scheme with printed headings as follows:

1. Generic name of story (not to be filled up).
2. Specific name.
3. Dramatis persone.
4. Thread of story.
5. Incidental circumstances.
6. Where published.
7. Nature of collection.
(1) Original or translation.
(2) If oral, state narrator’s name,
(3) Other particulars.
8. Special points noted by the editor of the above.
(Signed)

Including all human thought and wont, or creed and cult respecting
the spirit world under the term religion, we necessarily view the medi-
cine man of savages as a priest rather than asa physician. It is hard
to tell whether in America orin Australia more is being done to under-
stand the social and intellectual condition of the aborigines.

The men and women who in lower tribes stand for the clergy, as dis-
tinguished from the laity, or uninitiated, are variously styled doctors,
wizards, or witches, sorcerers, seers, or prophets, mediums, soothsayers,
necromancers, rain-makers (better weather makers), magicians, augurs,
fortune tellers, enchanters, priests, personators, diviners, ete.

Now, these can readily be divided into two classes or functions, viz,
those who see into, understand, and reveal the spirit world; and those
who have more or less control over it, compelling it to do their bidding.

The medicine man, doctor, sorcerer, wizard, fetish man are all of the
latter class. Whatever disease and death may be, whether merely the
person or spirit of some noxious thing, or an independently existing
spirit, one of the powerful charmers can induce or compel it to do his
bidding, either by direct command, or by some diplomatic action called
magic,
544 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR ‘1886.

In the collection of material for a scientific investigation of this class
of persons I have found it convenient to adopt the following questions:
(1) What are the actors called and what social rank do they hold?

(2) By what rites or initiations do they attain to the privileges of their
class ?

(3) What do they profess to do? What are they believed to be able
todo? Thatis, to which class above named do they claim to belong?

(4) What do they actually perform? What is their mode of treat-
ment? Do they sing, dance, go into eestasy, suck the wound, spit out
the disease in the form of a bone, stone, etc.? That is, not what they
claim to do, but what do they, actually? What dress, paraphernalia,
implements, and dramatic performances do they resort to? What fees
do they charge?

(5) What is the area of their operations, both in the spirit and in the
mundane world? Some cause, others cure, disease. Some have influ-

AN INDIAN MUMMY.

By JAMES LIsLx, Long Pine, Nebraska.

West of Fort Casper, in central Wyoming, is Poison Spider Creek,
a tributary of the North Platte River. The valley of this stream is
bounded on the northwest and north by a ridge of sand-rock, forming
the water-shed.

In places this rises precipitously to the height of 40 to 50 feet, with a
width at the top of 100 to 300 feet. Elsewhere the rock barely shows
at the surface. In a cave in the west face of one of these precipices
was found by S. D. Helm and D. W. Moffatt, the mummified body of
an Indian. The cave is open to the weather—a mere recess about 14
feet long, 7 feet high, and 8 feet deep. Inside this is a second cave or
recess, the floor of which is about 24 feet above the main floor. This
recess is about 7 feet long, 4 feet high, and 4 feet deep. The whole
opening is natural.

The body, evidently that of some important personage, was placed in
the inner cave in a kneeling posture, quite erect, with a very slight bend
at the hip-joints to balance. The head is thrown well back, the chin
high, and both head and face turned a little to the right. The hands
are joined across the bowels, the right hand outermost. The face was
to the front, looking westward. Originally there must have been some
kind of stay or prop to support the body in its position, but this had
long since disappeared, and the body had fallen to the left, the limbs

and feet being slightly twisted in consequence.

' he clothing was entirely rotted away, except fragments under the
bracelets; the bits remaining here are of cotton. A leather belt, much
decayed, is around the loins. Around each wrist is a coil of brass wire,
forming a bracelet. That on the left wrist makes forty to fifty turns
and extends about 6 inches. On the right wrist the coil is about 2 inches
shorter. On the fingers are several coarse brass rings. In the ears are
rings made of brass wire, the metal being very much corroded.

570 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

Around the neck is a necklace or collar made of pieces of quills cut
from the wing-feathers of some large bird. The pieces are about an
inch long, and the size about that of the wing-quills of a chicken. There
is no pattern proper. The pieces extend lengthwise of the collar, about
ten of them being placed side by side, making the width of the collar,
about 23 inches. Underneath this collar is another of similar work-
mmanship considerably decayed. No weapons were found save pieces of
nine or ten arrows, some with metal points, the others pointed with
flint. Fragments of a bridle and saddle were found, the leathered work
reduced to dust. The bridle-bit was a very primitive affair, but appar-
ently made by a white man. The saddle was of Indian workmanship—
a sort of “tree” made of bones. The man was of middle height and
fifty to fifty-five years of age at his death. His hair, which is about 15
inches long, is slightly streaked with gray in front. He evidently died
of an acute disease, since there is no sign of wasting sickness nor of
bodily injury. The body was not embalmed nor was any special effort
made to preserve it. The brain and internal organs have not been
touched, the preservation of the body being due to the climate, aided
to some extent possibly by chemical agencies within the cave itself (in
places in the reef near by, the rocks are impregnated with petroleum,
etc.). The flesh has dried up and shrunken to the bones. The weight
of the body is about 25 pounds,
MOUND IN JEFFERSON COUNTY, 'TENNESSEE.

By Dr. J. C. McCormick, Strawberry Plains, Tennessee.

The mound of which this paper is the subject is on the left or east
bank of the Tennessee River (Holston) 4 miles north from Strawberry
Plains, Jefferson County, Tennessee. It is much larger than any other
in this valley. It is about 30 yards from the river’s bank, and its re-
markable size and well-defined contour is such as will attract the atten-
tion of the most casual observer. Flints, broken stone, shells, and pieces
of broken pottery all attest that it is the work of the mound-builders.
The river at this point follows a course south 20 degrees east. No
ditches or signs indicating that this mound was used as a place of de-
fense are visible. Had these formerly existed the continued cultivation
of the land for so great a period would most assuredly have obliterated
them. i

The mound is circular in outline, and is, properly speaking, an earthen
burial mound. No stones of any size or in any considerable number
were used in its construction. Inthe immediate vicinity are the remains
of broken bowlders, but they do not occur in great numbers, neither do
they enter into the “‘make-up” of the mound. In outline the mound is
nearly a perfect circle. Measured from the base on one side to a cor-
responding’ point on the opposite side, on a horizontal plane, it is 120
feet in diameter. Its present diameter is somewhat greater than when
completed. This is easily explained when we take into consideration
the repeated plowings it has from time to time received for a century.
Aside from this, the wearing and washing away produced by natural
causes were sufficient to increase its natural diameter to a slight extent,
while its perpendicular height has been greatly reduced. Its present
height is 12 feet.

On Tuesday, November 2, 1886, I began an exploration of the mound.
A trench was dug on a level 3 feet above the bottom of the mound. This
trench extended in a direction north and south through the mound and
was about 5 feet wide. Another trench of like dimensions and on the
same level was begun on the west, and carried forward to a point where
it intersected the trench running north and south. Ata point near the

junction of these, and 3 feet below the surface, was found the first skel-

eton. It had been buried with the head toward the east; had evidently
been placed upon its right side, the face toward the north. The thigh
bones were to some extent flexed upon the body, and the arms had been
placed in front of the body and were somewhat extended. The cranium,
teeth, tarsal, and metatarsal, carpal and metacarpal bones were in a
fair state of preservation. No relics were found with this individual.
Further exploration led to the discovery of five other skeletons during
the day. These were found with their heads towards the east. Beads
were found, and from their position it is evident they had been worn
around the neck. During the day a skeleton was discovered near the
apex of the angle formed by the south and west trenches.

On the second day the first skeleton observed was that of a child,
evidently less than two years old. It had not passed the period of first
dentition. The cranium was broken down and decayed to such an ex-
tent as to render any measurement of it utterly impossible. Of the long
bones, the following linear measurements were taken at the time: Fe-
mur, 8.12 inches; tibias, 6.62 inches; humerus, 6 inches; radius, 4.55
inches. The others were in a very bad state of preservation and accu-
rate measurement was impossible. Another skeleton, that of a large
sized individual, presented some interesting peculiarities. The skull of
this skeleton was the first part met with in the process of unearthing.
The bones of the cranium were in a fair state of preservation, aS were
those comprising the vertebral column and those of the upper extremity.
The pelvic bones, also, were almost entire; but on searching for the
bone of the thigh I was somewhat surprised when, after a careful search,
only a small portion of the right femur was discovered. The remaining
bones of both the lower limbs were entirely missing. That portion of ;
the right femur exhumed presented all the characteristic signs of dis-
eased bone, and the individual to whom it belonged had evidently been
the subject of necrosis. It is not unfair, neither is it unreasonable, to
assert that this disease prevailed among the mound builders as well as
among races of mankind at the present day. But what was most per-
plexing was the absence of the other bones belonging to the lower ex-
treimities.

Of the remaining fifteen skeletons that were removed from the mound
during the three days of my exploration, there was not one that pre-
sented this peculiarity. In all of them the bones of the lower extremi-
ties, or at least some portions, were found. Six skeletons were taken
from the mound during the second day. Among this number were
several in which some of the bones were in a good state of preserva-
tion. One of these gave the following measurements: Cranium, ver-
tical heigbt inside, 4.90 inches; occipito-frontal arch, 13.50 inches; pari-
etal diameter, 6 inches; horizontal circumference, 20 inches; length, 7
inches; length of femur, 18.50 inches; length of tibias, 15 inches; tibial
circumference in middle, 3.75 inches; tibias, least circumference, 3.25
inches; humerus, 12.85 inches; radius, 10.12 inches; clavicle, 6.25 inches.
MOUNDS IN JEFFERSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE. 573

Four skeletons were found during the third day. My assistant while
removing one of them found a pipe and gorget that had been placed in
front of it. The gorget is a circular disk 4 inches in diameter. It is
made from a large and heavy shell. Both sides have been smoothly
dressed, but are now somewhat roughened and stained, no doubt by
the action of the soil in which it has lain. There are two perforations
near the margin of the disk. They are considerably worn, thus indi-
cating its long-continued use. The convex surface is plain and pre-
sents nothing for examination worthy of mention. The lines are well
defined, and are clearly and deeply cut. The design is no doubt in-
tended to represent a bird; in fact, the profile is plainly to be seen. Its
resemblance to the cedar bird, Ampelis cedrorum, is very marked. The
eye is represented by a smal] circlet; within this there is a small de-
pression or pit that is intended to represent theiris. The mandibles are
short and conical in outline. A pointed crest that arises from the back
of the head is plainly discernible. The incisions are clearly and cleanly
traced, and the entire design exhibits the skill of the mound builder
artist in a remarkable degree.

Among the objects obtained from the mound were several hundred
beads of various sizes. The greater number of these are made of shell;
some are of bone. Many are in a good state of preservation. Several
flints were found that had apparently never been used, as their sharp
edges and points would seem to indicate. Three whole vessels were
taken from the mound. Several small disks of shell were found; these
presented no particular ornamentation that is worth mentioning. Two
pipes were recovered; these were uninjured and are without ornamen-
tation. Three implements of bone are smoothly and evenly finished.
They are hollow throughout their entire jlength. They are bevelled on
one side for about half their length, and near the circular end there is a
perforation on one side extending to the cavity within. They are no
doubt made from the tibias of some animal, perhaps that of a deer. In
addition to those already mentioned, there were found several pins, awls,
and stones of various shapes and sizes.

In structure the mound consists of alternate layers of clay, sand, and
ashes, varying in thickness, the material of which was probably ob-
tained near by. The clay used in the construction of the mound was
most likely taken from the river bank. Sand is found along the river.
Stone was not used in the construction of this mound. Both land and
fresh water shells are found scattered throughoutits extent. The fresh
water species largely predominate. Among them are found Helix spi-
nosa, H. alternata, H. appressa, H. elevata, Campeloma ponderosa, C. de-
cisa, Io spinosa (the latter abundant), Angetrema verrucosa, Plewrocera
anthonyi, P. filum, Anculosa prerosa, Unio verrucosus, besides many
others which I am unable to determine.

Sixteen skeletons were taken from the mound. Of the crania,
several were saved in fair condition. The bodies were usually interred

with the heads to the east. In almost all cases, the limbs were
flexed. Two skeletons I found had evidently been buried in a sitting
position. In these the lower limbs had been flexed so that the knees
were drawn up nearly as high as and in front of the chin. The bodies had
been placed on a layer of soil; above this was a layer of sand, and above
the sand a layer of ashes. Very few pieces of charcoal were observed,
and it is fair to suppose from this that cremation had not been practiced
here. Aside from this there were no bones found that showed any evi-
dence of the action of the fire. In the northern half of the mound I
discovered what had formerly been posts or timbers placed on end.
These were very much decayed ; upon close examination they proved
to be of black walnut, Juglans nigra, which is common in this locality.
They did not occupy a perpendicular position, but had been placed
about 12 feet apart at an angle of perhaps 60 degrees to the north. I
examined carefully around these for anything that might have been
placed there, but nothing was found. I very much regret that inclem-
ent weather and other unavoidable circumstances prevented any further
investigation of the mound at that time. At some time in the near
future I hope to resume the work of a more thorough and minute ex-
amination of the mound and its contents.

Iowa, are among the most fertile portions of the State. The region is
watered mainly by the Shellrock and Cedar Rivers and their tributa
ries. The surface of the country is a gently undulating prairie with
only narrow belts of timber along the streams and a few isolated groves
or ‘patches of timber” adjacent to them.

The west side of the valley of the Shellrock and Lime Creek sometimes
rises to a height of from 70 to 123 feet above the water in the stream,
thus affording a beautiful and extensive view of the surrounding
country. The soil of the entire region is a rich deep black loam, mostly
of drift deposit, easily cultivated, and remarkably well suited to the
production of the cereals. When first settled by the white man mueh
less timber occupied the surface than now.

In early times this region, especially the Shellrock and Cedar valleys,
was the seat of populous settlements of the red men; but not so (except
in the Cedar valley), of the mound-builders, the remains of which are
mostly their burial mounds and earth-works.

On the south bank of Lime Creek, at Hackberry, Cerro Gordo
County, a small mound is located. This mound occupies a position on
the edge of a bluff, which at this place rises abruptly to a height of 70
feet above the water in the stream, and commands a beautiful and ex-
tensive view of the region to the north, northwest, and east. By the
caving away of portions of this bluff about two-thirds of this mound
has been destroyed ; but, judging from the portion which still remains,
it must have been, originally, about 15 feet in diameter, and from 14 to
2 feet in height, circular at the base, and with a gently rounded top.
Excavations revealed a horizontal layer of broken pottery, the frag-
ments almost always lying with the concave side upward. The surface
of the pottery had been ornamented by rude impressions, and had been
broken before being placed in the mound. This pottery occupied a
position slightly below the natural surface of the ground around the
mound. Associated with the pottery were numerous flint arrow-
points (finished and unfinished), of various designs. In the extreme

southeast portion of the mound, and occupying a position a few inches
above the layer of broken pottery, were several plates from the lower
portion of the carapace of a turtle. It is possible that these plates may
have gained this position long subsequent to the formation of the
mound. No human bones, or other relics than those mentioned, were
found.

About the center of the southeast quarter of section 5, township 95,
range 17 north, and half a mile west from Flood Creek, in the western
part of Floyd County, a peculiar mound is located. The topography of
the country immediately adjoining this creek, in this region, is rather
low and level, but not usually wet. This mound is situated on the
margin of a belt of timber, bordering a low, wet depression of the gen-
eral surface of the land. It was about 16 feet in diameter, and 1 foot
high at the center, with a circular basilar outline and flat top, except a
rounded ridge 8 or 10 inches high and 1 foot wide at the base, which
occupied the outer edge of the surface area. All round the base was a
trench, about 10 inches deep and 1 foot wide, from which earth had no
doubt been taken to form the ridge, and, in part, the mound itself. The
surface of the mound was densely covered by poplars (Populus tremu-
loides), wild plum (Prunus americana), and hazel brush (Caylus ameri-
cana).

Mr. Merton T. Webster and the writer together made a partial ex-
ploration of this mound by extending an excavation part of the way
through it, 2 feet wide and 14 feet in depth, with the following result:
First there was a layer of decomposed plant remains and earth, and
then a layer of charcoal, then a bed of ashes, and afterwards a layer
of soil. Below this layer of soil was another bed of charcoal and ashes,
occupying the same position relative to each other as those above.
This bed of ashes rested directly upon the natural surface of the ground,
which did not show any particular evidence of strong heat.

This description may be illustrated by the following cut, Fig. 1:

Fig. 1.—Section of ancient mound near Flood Creek, Floyd County, Iowa.

A careful examination of the charcoal, whjch was mostly in large
pieces and finely preserved, convinced us that the fuel had been largely
poplar wood. No burned bones or remains of artificial objects were
found.

In the eastern part of Floyd County, near Charles City, a large and
very interesting group of ancient mounds occur, most of which have
been explored by the writer.

All these mounds, thirty-one in number, are located, with one excep-

tion*, two miles northwest from Charles City, near the center of section
26t, township 96, range 16.

These mounds occur (except the three isolated ones) in a nearly
straight line, running about 20 degrees west of north, on the summit of
a low, broad ridge.

By referring to the accompanying map it will be seen that a spring

brook flows past the south end of this line of mounds, and the Cedar
River about half a mile to the west; while a quarter of a mile to the ©
east is located a slough, and a longitudinal depression occurs at the
base of the ridge on the west.

These mounds are in reality situated in the valley of the Cedar River,
the true valley side being from half to three-fourths of a mile to the
east.

This entire ridge was originally covered with a heavy growth of oaks,
poplars, ete.; but most of it has long since been cleared away in the
opening up of the land for cultivation.

Mound No. 1 (counting from the south end of the line), 63 feet in
length, and 48 feet in width, and 3 feet in height. This appears to have
been a natural elevation to which dirt has been brought and so com-
pleted the mound. This was partially explored, but nothing found.
Seventy-five feet to the west from No. 1 is a circular mound 21 feet in
diameter and 14 feet in height. Unexplored.

Fifteen feet northwest from the last is another circular unexplored
mound, 20 feet in width and 2 feet in height.

Ten feet from No. 3 is a large curved mound 163 feet in length (follow-
ing the outer basal curvature), and varying from 20 to 25 feet in width
and from 24 to 3 feet in height. This mound tapers, and decreases in
height toward the northwest, where, at the extremity, it has a height of
14 feet and a width of 8 feet.

Not far from the northwest extremity of this mound occurs a spur or
extension of the main mound. This spur is 27 feet long, and quite
rapidly diminishes in height and width (especially in height), until at
. the end it is less than 1 foot high and only 10 feet in width. This ap-
pears to have been an original mound with additions made to it by
human hands. Excavations were made in this mound at different points
down to the level of the ground at the base of the mound, but without
finding anything.

The north part of this mound is still covered with hazel brush, while
the south part has been plowed over for many years.

This mound, as well as mound No. 1, seems not to have been raised
for sepulchral purposes, as nearly all others of the group have been.

No. 5, a circular mound, 300 feet from No 4, 14 feet in height, 21 feet in
diameter, and surface occupied by hazel brush. Unexplored.

No. 6, a mound 200 feet from the base of No. 5, circular, 15 feet in
height, and 21 feet in diameter. This has been degraded by the plow.
Unexplored.

Between Nos. 5 and 6 there is another mound; but as there is some
uncertainty regarding its origin, it is not represented on the map.

No.7, a mound about the same in all respects as No.6. Unexplored,
degraded by the plow, and 100 feet or more from No. 6.

No. 8, a circular mound, 45 feet in diameter, 3 feet in height, and 50
feet distant from No. 7. Degraded and unexplored.

No. 9, a mound 10 feet distant from No, 8, is about 30 feet in diameter,
MOUNDS IN IOWA. 579

and 24 feet in height. An exploration of this mound was made by an
excavation in the center, 8 feet square, and extending down to the level
at the base. From 20 inches below the surface and downward frag-
ments of pottery were found. Lyiug on the natural surface of the
ground was found a closely packed bundle of human arm and leg bones,
lying due east and west. On the east end of these bones reposed a
crushed and somewhat separated cranium, some portions of which were
very thick, and the teeth large and strong. The bones and skull were
those of a young adult person. Two feet to the northeast from the
first bundle of bones was another similar bundle, lying directed a few
degrees south of east. On the east end of this bundle lay a portion of
a crushed skull. The skull and bones were somewhat charred by fire,
which appears to have been done after being placed in the mound. A
few feet to the southeast from the last bundle of bones, was found
another similar closely packed bundle, lying directed about 13 degrees
south of east. No skull was found with this bundle. <A few feet to
the northwest from the first bundle of bones was found another like
bundle, lying due east and west; no skull was present. Scattered
through the mound were a few small pieces of charcoal, hard-burned
clay, and pieces of limestone showing the action of fire. Some years
ago an excavation was made in the center of this mound, and a skull,
together with one or two bundles of bones, was taken out. All the
bones in this mound showed more or less evidence of calcination. With
one exception, all the remains had been elsewhere cremated before
being placed in this mound. Formerly an oak tree, 12 inches in diam-
eter, occupied the surface of the center of this mound, only the stump
now remaining.

No. 10, a circular mound, 36 feet in diameter and 3 feet in height, and
12 feet from No.9. Degraded by the plow. An examination of this
mound was made, but without finding anything.

No. 11, a mound 4 feet from No. 10, circular, 45 feet in diameter and
24 teetin height. Degraded. An excavation 8 feet square and 2} feet
in depth was made in the center of this mound. Ten inches below the
surface and slightly east of the center a piece of broken pottery and a
few small fragments of charcoal alone were found. No evidence of fire
was observed save the charcoal, which appears to have been brought in.

No. 12 is similar to No. 11, but slightly smaller, and 12 feet distant
from it. A partial exploration of this mound was made, and numerous
pieces of hard-burned clay were found scattered through it, all of which
had been brought in. Ten inches below the surface of the mound a
portion of a calcined femur was found. No trace of fire was noticed in
the mound.

No. 13, a mound 15 feet from No. 12, circular, 45 feet in diameter and
2 feet high. Degraded and unexplored.

No. 14, a mound 16 feet from No. 13, circular, 51 feet wide and i feet

peculiar, imperfect skull, apparently that of a dog, was found, facing the
southwest. Nearthis skull, and 7 inches below, were found quite closely
associated five bundles of leg and arm bones similar to those found in
other mounds of this series already described. In three cases a skull
(crushed) had been placed on the west end of the bundles of bones,
and in one instance a skull had been placed between two of these bun-
dles. Underneath the west end of the north bundle was one-half of a
lower jaw still retaining the teeth. The skull betweer the bundles had
been placed on its right side, with mouth wide open, facing the north-
west; scattered in the soil near it were numbers of its teeth, indicating
that they had dropped out before being covered with earth. All the
bundles of bones lay directed in an east, northeast, or southeast direc-
tion, none of them outside of the radius of the rising sun at some period
of the year. In all but two instances the bones occupied a horizontal
position; but in two cases they sloped upward in an easterly direction
at an angle of several degrees. Seven inches below the dog skull, nu-
merous pieces of ribs and other small bones were found, which had been
thrown in promiscuously. All the skulls were rather thick, jaws and
- teeth large and strong. Some of the bones were those of very old in-
dividuals, while the majority were those of. young adult persons. As-
sociated with the human remains, and scattered through the mound,
were numerous pieces of burned clay and charcoal which had been
brought in. This charcoal was of oak of the same species as now
grows in the region. Six inches below the surface of the mound two
large slabs of water-worn (Devonian) limestone were found. These
were obtained from the Cedar River, near by.

The human remains had all been cremated before being placed in the
mound.

The accompanying diagram (Fig. 3) will illustrate this description, as
well as show the general method of interment practiced here by these
ancient people.

No. 15, a mound 10 feet from No. 14, circular, 30 feet in diameter and
- 1} feet in height. A partial exploration of this mound failed to show
any indications of fire or to yield relics of any kind.

No. 16, 16 feet from No. 15, is; .other mound of the same character.
A partial exploration of this mound revealed the presence of human
leg and arm bones, 17 inches below the surface of the mound, ap-
parently thrown in promiscuously. No trace of fire or other relics
than those mentioned were found.

No. 17,a mound 3 feet from No. 16, circular, 14 feet in height, and
25 feet in diameter. An oak stump 8 or 10 inches in diameter still
occupied a position on the edge of this mound. Degraded and unex-
plored.

No. 18, a mound 20 feet from No. 17, circular, 42 feet in diameter and
24 feet in height. A trench 2 feet wide and 24 feet deep was made
through the center of this mound from east to west, but no trace of fire
or relics of any kind was found. The material of the mound was homo-
geneous throughout. Degraded by cultivation.

No. 19, a mound 20 feet distant from No. 18, circular, 42 feet in diam-
. eter and 24 feet in height. Occupying the surface of the mound was
some hazel brush, and growing on the edge was a burr-oak tree 1 foot in
diameter. Near the center of the mound three large oaks had recently
been grubbed up; on the stump of one was counted sixty-three annual
rings. In the center of this mound an excavation 8 feet square and 24
feet deep was made. Lying at length, ona level with the ground around
the mound, a skeleton of an adult person was found. This skeleton
lay with the head 11 degrees south of east.. The body had been placed
on its back, head lying on its left side, mouth open about 1 inch, left
shoulder drawn up and cbin resting on the clavicle, and arms at the side.
The cranium was large and well formed, the jaws and teeth strong and
rather large, and judging from the worn condition of the crowns of the
teeth, it was thatof a personsomewhatadvanced in years. Thisskeleton
indicated a person over 6 feet in height. As this skeleton, together with
others, was stolen soon after being exhumed, it has made it impossible
to give cranial measurements here as was desired. All the bones were
in a poor state of preservation. No trace of fire was observed in the
mound, or relics of any description found with the bones. The earth
around and for 14 feet above the body had been tamped very hard.

No. 20, 21 feet trom No. 19, was another mound of the same form and
dimensions, and covered with a growth of hazel brush, the young oaks
and poplars which but a few years ago occupied it having been cut
down and removed. An exploration of this mound was made with the
582 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

following result: In the center of the mound, and 26 inches below the
surface, was found three bundles of leg and arm bones, five skulls in
a crushed condition, and what appeared to be two pelvis bones much
decayed. In thecenter of this assemblage of bones was a small earthen
vase or urn, set upright. Associated with and distributed in the earth
above the bones were numerous pieces of charcoal, burned clay, and one
or two pieces of broken pottery. The bundles of bones, with one excep-
tion, all lay in an easterly and westerly direction, while the skulls and
other bones were placed here without apparent order. Mostof the crania
were those of young adult individuals, one of them a babe with milk
teeth. Some of them however were those of very old persons, the crowns
of the teeth (the teeth in all the skulls were very large) all having been
worn down to and sometimes deeply into the dentine. The urn, which
was of the rudest form the writer has ever seen from any mound, was
nearly perfect. The bones, which were all in a poor state of preserva-
tion, were more or less calcined, some before and some after having been
placed in the mound. The charcoal (one piece found was 21 inches in
length and 4 inches in diameter) was of oak, and of the same species as _
now abundantly occupies the region and the surface of some of the
mounds. The soil above and around the bones had been packed very
hard.

No. 21, a circular mound, about 30 feet in diameter and 2 feet in height,
and 25 feet distant from No. 20. The surface of this mound was covered
by small hazel brush, and until recently by a growth of young oaks and
poplars. Anexploration revealed a circular, Gval mound of red burned
clay, 1 foot in thickness at the center and about 10 feet in diameter, 1
foot below the surface of the rest of the mound. Near the center of the
mound, and underneath the burned clay, were three bundles of bones,
similar to those found in other mounds of this series. Two of the bundles
lay directed 11 degrees east of south; the third bundle lay directed due
northwest and southeast. On the north end of the two first bundles
of bones reposed a crushed skull, and on the southeast end of the third
bundle was also a crushed cranium. These bones were all very much
charred by fire. Associated with these bundles of bones were large
quantities of other human bones, almost entirely consumed by burning.
In the black soil above the burned clay a few small pieces of oak char-
coal were found. Neither charcoal nor ashes, bones nor other relics, were
found in the burned clay. The following section (Fig. 2) wil) illustrate
the above description:

This mound appears to have been used not only as a burial mound,
but as a cremation mound as well. It is known that the human remains
found in the majority of the mounds of this group had been elsewhere
cremated before being placed in the mounds.

No. 22, a mound of the same dimensions as the last, and 30 feet dis-
tant from it. Surface occupied by a few hazel brush and young oaks.
Near the center, and 2 feet below the surface of the mound, a bundle of
bones was found, together with a portion of a skull; all of which were
in a much decayed condition. The bundle of bones lay due northeast
and southwest. Distributed through the mound were pieces of oak
charcoal and burned clay which had been brought in. There was no
evidence that fire was used at this burial here. The soil around and
for some inches above the bones had been beaten hard.

No. 23, 25 feet from No. 22, was a circular flattened mound, 30 feet in
diameter and 1 foot high. The surface was occupied by hazel brush and
a few small and medium-sized oak trees. <A partial exploration of this
mound was made, but no relics were found or evidence of fire observed.

No. 24, a mound, 25 feet from No. 23, circular, 45 feet in diameter and
14 feet in height. Surface occupied by the same class of vegetation as
the last. Three feet south of the center of the mound came upon a bun-
dle of bones lying due east and west. Lying one on the east end and one
on the west end of these bones, were two skulls. The skull occupying
a position on the east end, lay on its left side facing south by southwest.
Skull large, of moderate thickness, forehead low and sloping abruptly
backward; teeth large and strong, and with crowns of molars and pre-
_ molars worn smooth, indicating an old individual. As this skull soon
crumbled in pieces on exposure to the atmosphere, definite measure-
ments were not taken. The second skull was in a crushed condition,
although a partial reconstruction of its parts was possible. Through
the back part of the skull (left parietal bone) were three circular holes
arranged in a line (the smaller one in the center), 5, 8, and 11 millime-
ters in diameter respectively. Whether these perforations were made
by human hands or by the agency of some insect or its boring larva,
after the burial of the bones and their softening by decay, we are unable
tostate. The latter supposition, however, seems to us the most probable.

No. 25, a circular mound, 45 feet wide, 3 feet high, and 20 feet distant
from No. 24. Surface occupied by the same, but more dense, arboreal
vegetation and undergrowth as occupies the surface of many of the other
mounds. An exploration of this mound revealed nothing save a few
scattered fragments of charcoal and burned clay, which had been brought
in from some other locality. The material ofthe mound had been tramped
hard.

No. 26, a mound about 53 feet distant from the last, circular, 33 feet
in diameter, and 3 feet in height. Surface occupied by a few brush and
the stumps of three oaks, one showing forty-eight and another sixty-one
annual rings. Nothing was found in this mound except a few small
pieces of charcoal of oak wood.
584 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

No. 27, a mound 5 feet from No. 26, and of the same form sut some-
what smaller. Surface occupied by hazel brush. Unexplored.

No. 28, a mound 40 feet from the last, circular, 1 foot in height, and
24 feet in diameter. Surface partially occupied by small hazel brush
and the stumps of a few small trees. Unexplored.

About one-third of a mile to the northwest from this line of mounds
an isolated circular mound occurs. It is located on the brow of a some-
what higher and much narrower ridge, and about 40 rods from an aban-
doned portion of the channel of the Cedar, marked 1 onthemap. This
mound, we were informed by Mr. Capron, the present owner of the land,
was originally about 14 feet in height and 20 feet in diameter, but as
it had been industriously plowed over for more than thirty-five years,
its greatest height when examined by the writer was only about 6 inches.

A thorough exploration of this mound was made and with the following
result: One foot below the surface of the mound, and 6 inches below
the natural surface of the ground around the mound, was found a large
quantity of broken pottery, charcoal, two sinkers, one rude arrow point,
and a few flint chippings. All these relics showed evidence of having
been burned after having been placed in the mound. One foot below
. the pottery, portions of a human skeleton were found. The bones (which
appeared not to have been placed in a bundle) were too few and too
badly decayed to allow of any definite knowledge as to the original
placing of the body. <A portion of the pottery found here presents a
combination of net or basket markings and of separate cord markings.
The regularity of the impressions upon the subglobular bodies indicates
almost unbroken contact with the interior surface of the woven vessel. .
The rims have been ornamented by separately impressing coarse twisted
cords. The rims of two of the vessels were ornamented exactly like the
“Ancient British Vase” figured on page 399 of the Third Annual Re-
port of the Bureau of Ethnology, except that the three upper and. the
three lower parallel lines are wanting.

Some of the vessels were smooth; all ofa very moderate thickness, of
a yellowish-red color, and made of pounded granite of drift origin, fine
gravel, and clay. Portions of six vessels were found, and all, with one
exception, having the rim variously molded and artistically decorated
by the impressions of coarse twisted cords. One of the largest vessels,
which was less fractured than the rest, and which admitted of a partial
reconstruction of its parts, had an aperture diameter of 205 centimeters,
and a diameter of the large and abruptly flaring portion near the base
of 31, and a height of 16 centimeters.

The neck of this vessel was sharply constricted. With one or two ex-
ceptions, all the other vessels were of the same general form but some-
what smaller.*

*In a future paper we desire to give a more detailed description, accompanied by
cuts, of the pottery found in tuese mounds, together with that of the pottery (now in
the writer’s possession) showing the impressions of textile fabrics, from ancient
mounds in other parts of Iowa.
MOUNDS IN IOWA. 585

Some years ago Mr. Capron made an excavation in this mound and
took out numerous small pieces of pottery, and one sinker larger and
finer than either of those obtained by the writer.

About 6 feet to the northeast from the mound was a saucer-shaped
depression 10 feet in diameter and 14 feet in depth, from which dirt had
been taken in the construction of the mound. Itis stated by Mr. Capron
that this excavation was originally much larger.

On a much lower and level space (marked A on the map) on the bank
of the now abandoned channel of the river, and about 40 rods to the
northwest from the mound, considerable quantities of broken pottery
some of it differing greatly in decoration from any found in the mounds,
has been plowed up. Considerable numbers of arrow points, together
with lance points, drills, hammers, flint chippings, etc., have also been
found.

It seems quite probable that this was the site of a village of these an-
cient people who erected the mounds.

About half a mile to the northeast from the above described mound
another isolated circular mound occurs. This is located upon the ex-
tremity of the brow of a rather high and abruptly truncate ridge, which
here approaches to within a few rods of the Cedar. From this point a
tine view of a considerable portion of the valley may be gained. This
mound, which was opened by parties from Charles City some years ago,
was said to have been circular, 20 feet in diameter, and 2 feet in height.

But little information as to the result of the exploration of this mound
has been obtained by the writer, save that a considerable quantity of
fabric and cord marked pottery, much of it similar to that obtained trom
the mound on the Capron farm, was found, and that it had been sub-
jected to the action of fire after having been placed inthe mound. Sev-
eral fine specimens of this pottery were sometime afterward presented
to the writer by one of the party making the exploration. The larger
fabric-marked specimen is of peculiar interest from the fact that in the
manufacturing of the vessel the hand was used in pressing the plastic
clay into shape,* the interior of the vessel (that portion of it known)
showing deep depressions or indentations made by pressure of the hand
or fingers, this giving both the interior and exterior of the vessel an
uneven surface.

This vessel appears to have been formed by placing the material in
some subelastic mold (perhaps of willow) and pressing into form by
the hand; but prior to which the mold had been lined with some coarse
weven fabric, for, perhaps, the purpose (1) of facilitating the removal
of the vessel from, the mold, and (2) for the purpose of ornamentation.
Near this mound was found (by Mr. Burt Harwood, one of the explorers

of the mound) and presented to the writer numerous arrow points, a
fish-spear (according to Abbot), knife, and a fine plumb-bob.

The point of special interest regarding the arrow heads is their (in

*Tn all other observed examples some smooth instrument was used for this purpose.

some cases extreme) rudeness of form. The knife, which is the most
beautiful specimen of its kind that we have ever seen, is of milky quartz,
73 centimeters in length, about 3 centimeters wide at the middle, and
tapers to a point at either end.

The fish spear has a length of 54 centimeters and width at the base
of 2 ceutimeters; this Spear point tapers gradually to the front, the
forward half very thick and heavy, the breadth and thickness being
about equal.

The plumb-bobis a beautiful symmetrical specimen, ovatein form, with
a length of 54 centimeters and diameter of 54 centimeters. Running
longitudinally around this specimen is a rather profound groove.

The three last named implements, knife, spear, and plumb, are, so far
as known to me, of very rare occurrence in lowa.

On the second ridge, west (which is slightly lower) from the line of
mounds, and directly opposite mound No. 14, is another isolated mound.
This mound is 42 feet long from north to south, and 30 feet wide and 1
foot high at the center. Formerly a fair-sized oak tree occupied the
surface in the center of this mound. Many years’ working of the plow
has reduced the height to a considerable degree.

About 3 feet from the base of the northeast part of the mound was
a saucer-shaped depression (originally larger and deeper) about 22 feet
in diameter and 1 foot deep. Along the entire east side at the base
was a depression somewhat shallower than the first one. From these
depressions dirt had been taken for the construction of the mound.

Near the northeast part of the mound, and 2 feet below the surface
of the mound and 1 foot below the natural surface of the ground around
the mound, was found part of a calcined skull and several leg and arm
bones. These bones had the appearance of having been placed here
in a loose, careless manner, most of them lying directed north and
south. Five feet to the south of the remains of the first body were the
remains of a second body. This body was represented by a somewhat
larger number of calcined leg and arm bones than the first one. The
condition of the few well-preserved teeth found with these bones would
indicate that they belonged to a person somewhat past middle life.
The long bones, with one exception, all lay directed north and south.

Both bodies found here had been cremated at some other locality be-
fore being placed in the mound. From near the surface of the mound
was obtained a few pieces of charcoal, flint chippings, and a small piece
of pottery.

The bones in this mound, as well as the bones in many of the other
mounds examined, had been considerably gnawed, and some of them
destroyed, by the pouched gopher (Geomys bursarius). These burial
mounds being usually located upon the highest and dryest portion of a
region offer special inducements for these troublesome rodents to ap-
propriate them for their domiciles, which they often have done.

The charcoal found in this mound and in the mound on Mr. Capron’s

farm as well was of a very fine-grained compact wood, differing widely
from the oak.

Judging from the great difference (in many respects) in the mode of
burial, the state of preservation of the bones, ete., it seems not improba-
ble that they are the remains of a different tribe of the mound-builders
from those who erected the line of mounds, and that the interments
were made at a period considerably prior to those interments in the
line.

The material of all the mounds, except the charcoal and burned clay
mentioned, is a black, homogeneous drift soil, such as every where occu-
pies the surface of the region. No ‘dugholes,” ditches, or excavations
of any kind (with the two exceptions noted) were observed near or ad-
jacent to the mounds, from which earth might have been taken for
their construction. The diameter of the mounds and their distance
apart has been ascertained by pacing.*

One-third of a mile to the south of the line of mounds, and at a lower
level, are situated several circular mounds (now nearly obliterated by
the cultivation of the soil) similar to those already described, none of
which have been explored.

At Floyd, 4 miles farther up the Cedar from these mounds, there are
several other ancient.mounds which in general form and appearance
approach those already described.

About 8 miles to the northeast from Charles City, on the southwest
part of the northwest quarter of section 36, township 96, range 15,
Floyd County, an ancient earth-work or fortification occurs on the east
side of the Little Cedar River.t The topography of the region in the
immediate vicinity of this stream is broken and possessed of considera-
ble beauty of natural scenery. The valley of this stream is from one-
fourth to one-half a mile in width, and its sides rise to a height of from
50 to 300 feet above the stream.

This tortitication, as will be observed by reference to the accompanying
map, is located about 150 feet distant from the bank of the abandoned
channel ot the Littie Cedar River, and about the same distance from a
ravine, which is located near the southeast extremity of the fortification
and which is tributary to the Little Cedar. The bottom of this ravine
and the abandoned channel of the Little Cedar, is from 18 to 20 feet
lower than the base of the fortification. This fortification is located in
the valley of the Little Cedar, the east valley side being one-fourth of a
mile from it and, as before stated, rises many feet above it. The earth-
work itself is 124 feet in length, 16 feet in width at the base, and 23
feet in height. The top is gently oval, sides gradually sloping to the

north, and is composed of the ordinary drift soil of the region.

No “dug-holes,” or other excavations, were observed, from which earth
might have been taken for the construction of the fortification.

Several excavations had been made in different parts of this earth-
work by various parties, but no relics were discovered. Flint arrow
points are not unfrequently found on the surface in this region.

So far as is at present known to me, this is the first mound-builder
fortification discovered in northern Iowa. It is reported that there oc-
cur in what is known as the “big woods,” on the west side of the Little
Cedar, 7 miles below the above locality, three mounds. These mounds
are composed of drift bowlders and soil, are about 24 feet high, 2 feet
wide, and from 4 to 7 feet in length.

POSTSCRIPT.

At the time the preceding account of ancient mounds in Floyd and
Cerro Gordo Counties was prepared, a portion of the surface near the
southern extremity of the line of mounds was covered by an almost im-
penetrable growth of brush, vines, and weeds. Here were observed
what appeared to be several artificial mounds; but, under the condition
stated, there was so much doubt regarding their origin that no mention
MOUNDS IN IOWA. 589

was made in the article regarding them ; neither were they represented
in the map accompanying the paper. A few weeks ago however we
made another examination of the region. The brush, ete., had been
cleared from the surface and burned, thus fully exposing the mounds.
They were shown to be the work

of human hands, and are repre-

sented in the accompanying dia- {

gram. No. 2 is accurately repre-

sented in the map given, and is
here introduced simply to show “i 3 3

to the south. The distance between No.1 and 2, at B, is between 4 and
5 feet. No. 3.is along mound, 81 feet in length, 15 feet wide at the base,
and 2 feet in height at the center. The distance between this mound
and No. 2, at C, is 24 feet. At A, an excavation, 14 feet in depth, had
been made; this excavation was much the deepest at the base of No. 2.
Here doubtless was where a portion of the material for the construction
of No. 2 was obtained. The material for the other mounds was appar-
ently scraped from the surface in the immediate vicinity.

These three mounds were apparently reared for the purpose of de-
fense. Running north by northwest (in a line) from No. 1 are several
small circular mounds from 8 to 10 feet indiameter. For what purpose
these were raised, we are at present unable to state, as no exploration
of them has been yet made,
INDIAN GRAVES IN FLOYD AND CHICKASAW COUNTIES,
IOWA.

By CLEMENT L. WEBSTER, Charles City, Towa,

Our Indians, like the wild buffalo, are fast disappearing before the ad-
vance of civilization. Only a few generations hence and the last ves-
tige of this once noble race will have disappeared, and nothing be left
to mark their occupancy of this broad and beautiful land of ours save
the few graves of their dead which dot our hills and valley sides. And
even these silent records of a fast vanishing race are rapidly disappear-
ing with the march of time. So it seems fitting and well that whatever
of interest they may possess be recorded now.

On a low but dry piece of ground, in what was known as “ Carman’s
Woods,” near the confluence of Beaver Dam Brook* with the Shellrock
River, one-half mile north from Rockford, in Floyd County, a peculiar
Indian grave is located.

This grave is 7 feet long, 24 feet wide, 14 feet in height, and 3 feet in
depth.

Mr. Merton T. Webster and the writer together made an exploration
of this grave, but without finding human remains or relics of any kind.
‘the grave had been excavated in the soil down to the underlying lime-
stone strata. Running lengthwise through the center of the grave,
from bottom to top, was a row of limestone slabs from 2 to 3 inches iu
thickness set up edgewise.

For the first foot the grave had been filled in with small fragments
and blocks of limestone; the rest of it was then filled by laying in, ob-
liquely, slabs of limestone on each side of the central row, one edge rest-
ing in the outer portion of the grave and the other against the central
row of stones. The surface slabs were so large and heavy as to require
the entire strength of one man to remove them.

The following section (Fig. 7) will illustrate this description.

Two miles northwest from Charles City, in Floyd County, are located
a group of four Indian gravest This group of graves is situated on

* This is now called ‘‘ Whisky Creek” by some.

tThe exact location of this group and the isolated one above described are indi-
cated on the map (Fig. 2) which accompanies the preceding paper entitled “Ancient
Mounds and Earthworks in Floyd and Cerro Gordo Counties, Iowa,” (Ante, p.577.)

high, dry ground, back to the north from a small creek which comes
in here from the east.

Fic. 7.—Transverse section of Indian grave near Rockford, Iowa.

These graves are apparently made like ordinary graves of the whites.
With one exception they all lie directed northeast and southwest, the
exceptional one lying due north and south. They all occur close to-
gether. Three of them are nearly 7 feet in length; the fourth one is
that of a small child, and is only about 34 feet long.

It is said by old settlers that these graves have been known here ever
since the country was first settled, over thirty years ago, and that “they
probably belong to Winnebagos.”

About one-fourth of a mile to the west-southwest from the above de-
scribed group an isolated grave might hava been seen a few years ago.
The history of the death of the one whose resting-place it was has been
furnished me by some of the old pioneers of the section who were per-
sonally acquainted with the facts. The history, in brief, is this: In the
winter of 1849~’50 a band of Winnebago Indians came in here from the
east (?) on a hunting expedition; among the number was the son of the
chief of the tribe, eighteen or twenty years of age. In chasing a bear
this young Indian became over-heated, took cold, a fever setting in, and
he soon died. His body was wrapped in his blanket and placed on the
ground in the timber on a level space back from the creek a short dis-
tance. He was laid at length, with head to the northeast and feet to
southwest. Slabs of green wood, 3 feet long, were then split out and
placed over the body in an inverted V-shaped form, meeting at the top.
The ends of this inclosure were then closed up by other slabs. At the
head of this a post of green wood 6 inches in diameter was firmly driven
into the ground, after the bark had been carefully removed, This post
592 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

extended 3 feet above ground, and on it was rudely painted with some
red pigment figures resembling Xs, Ys, etc. Around this inclosure a
tight log crib was made. This crib was 10 feet long, 7 feet wide, and
slightly over 3 feet in height, and was made of green unpeeled logs,
from 6 to 7 inches in diameter, laid up in log-house style, and so notched
at the ends as to leave but little if any space between them, this being
intended to keep the wolves and other wild animals from the body.
Over the top of the crib were tightly fitted other logs. The skull of
this Indian is now in the possession of Dr. J. W. Smith, of Charles City.

One mile below the above-described grave, in the timber on the south
bank of an elbow of the Cedar River, which extends out here to the east,
there might have been seen a few years since the graves of several
Winnebago Indian children. The bodies had apparently been placed
on the surface of the ground, and on all four sides logs 12 inches in
diameter had been arranged, the space inclosed being filled in with
earth, and a mound 13 inches or more in height raised over the body.
These graves were situated on the bank, 10 feet above.and 10 or 15
yards distant from the stream.

On the brow of the hills, which here torm the east valley side of the
Little Cedar River, at Bradford, in Chickasaw County, and where a
beautiful view of the surrounding region is afforded, formerly existed a
Winnebago burial ground. Here more than twelve Indians were buried.
Their bodies were wrapped in their blankets; a quantity of provisions,
their guns, and other things, supposed to be needed in the “happy hunt-
ing ground,” were placed at their sides. Over the body an inclosure was
formed by driving staves into the ground obliquely on each side, meet-
ing at the top, as described in the burial north from Charles City.

As these graves were located on the prairie, no log crib was placed
around this inclosure; but imstead, clods of earth were arranged all
around the outside, completely covering the slabs from view save a
slight portion at the top. In the heavy timber on the west side of the
stream at this place numerous other graves existed. Here tight log
cribs, similar to the one already described, were placed around the inner
inclosure. In one instance the body of the dead was putin a rude slab
coffin and placed on crotched poles, 10 feet from the ground. In an-
other instance the body of a papoose was laid in a rough slab box, and
this placed in the crotches of a tree.

Whether the two last burials were those of the Winnebagoes, or those
of some other tribe, I am unable to state with certainty, although the
settlers living in the region at the time affirm that they were those of
the Winnebagoes.

The Indians in passing up and down this stream during the summer
and fall ‘ would place wisps of June grass on the graves of their dead.”
ANCIENT MOUNDS IN JOHNSON COUNTY, IOWA.

By CLEMENT L. WEBSTER, Charles City, Iowa.

Johnson County occupies a position in the southeastern portion of the
State. Its topography is peculiarly that of loess regions, being for the
most part a very rolling and (along the streams) broken prairie country.
This area is watered by the Iowa River and its tributaries. The Iowa
is a beautiful meandering stream. Entering the county near its north-
west corner, it flows almost due east to the center of the county, where
it abruptly turns and continues its course through the region in a south
by southeast direction. The valley of the lowa River and its tributaries
is relatively narrow and deep, and bordered by more or less steep
acclivities and flanked at frequent intervals by deep but narrow and
rapidly ascending ravines.

The immediate valley of the lowa River attains an average width of
slightly over one-half of a mile, and its channel has been eroded to a
depth varying from 50 to over 175 feet below the valley borders: The
small tributaries have also eroded their course to a depth of from 10 to
80 feet. There are no extensive marshes or swamps.

The soil of the area is for the most part a yellow homogeneous loess,
and is of quite inferior quality for farming and the production of the
cereals compared with the rich black drift soil of other portions of the
State to the north.

The valley of the Lowa, especially in the northern half of the county,
with its heavy skirting of timber, fluted sides, and often bold escarp-
ments of Devonian rock, is perhaps one of the most beautiful regions in
the State. ;

This valley was once the seat of a populous settlement of the mound-
builders, as is evidenced by their remains. Of these silent records of a
long vanished race the most importaut as well as the most legible are
the earthen mounds which cover the bones and dust of their dead.
They crown many of the peaks and ridges of the blutfs, most of them
assuming only moderate proportions while large numbers are mere
swellings of the surface not readily recognized as being of artificial ori
gin—this arising mainly from the degradation by the plow.

H. Mis. 600-——38 593
594 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

Along the Iowa in this county there are known to be, or have
been, at least one hundred of these mounds. It would be useless labor
and waste of time to attempt to locate on a map the situation of each
mound in Johnson County, and a tedious and unprofitable repetition to
detail minutely the examination of each separate mound.

For brevity of description they can be readily grouped in two classes
according to their form, and the description of one will answer generally
for all of its particular class.

The first class of mounds, and by far the largest in number, are cir-
cular at the base and have an oval or flattened top, a diameter varying
from 12 to 24 feet, and a height of from 14 to 3 feet. The second class
of mounds are long and narrow, sometimes forming an extension to one
of those of the first class. These mounds have, so far 4s observed, a
length varying from 45 to 130 feet, with a width of from 12 to 13% feet,
and a height varying from 14 to 2 feet.

Near Mr. Iker’s, 5 miles north from Iowa City, occurs an interesting
group of these ancient mounds, eighteen in number, located in a line on
the summit of a high, narrow ridge, which forms the east bank of the
Iowa and the west bank of Sanders Creek, and extends nearly paraliel
to them.

The highest point of this ridge rises about 100 feet above the bed of
the Iowa River, but to a lesser height above the bed of the creek. From
this ridge a beautiful and more or less extensive view of the valley is
obtained. The mounds are arranged in a slightly curved line, tollow
ing the crest of the ridge. The surface of the summit of the ridge has
a slope of several feet from the south to mound No. 5. From mound
No. 12 the surface gradually rises until within about a quarter of a mile
an altitude varying from 25 to 30 feet is attained above the base of this
mound.

The accompanying map will illustrate the position and relation of the.
mounds to one another, while the table will give their dimensions, ete.

Most of the mounds have been partially, and a few thoroughly, ex- |
plored by Mr. M. W. Davis, of Iowa City, who has taken much inter-
est in their study and the securing of their relics, of which he has now
quite a large and valuable collection obtained from this county.

. 8.—Map showing position of Mounds.

To Mr. Davis I am indebted for most of the notes on the exploration
of these mounds.

In mound No. 1 (counting from the south) a skeleton of an adult in-
dividual, in a sitting posture, was unearthed ; near this was also found
a small peculiar shaped vase of burned clay, made apparently to repre-

-gsent some horned ruminant. These relics were found at or slightly below
the natural surface of the ground around the mound. In mound No. 2
was found the skeleton of a child, “apparently about seven years old.”
The bones in this mound, as well as the bones in mound No. 1, were in
a poor State of preservation.

It is reported by Mr. Davis that in nearly all other mounds examined
by him fragments of human bones were found, and in nearly all mounds ~
a layer of charcoal and ashes occupied a horizon a few inches above the
596 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

human remains. He also reports the finding of several burned drift
bowlderettes in some of the mounds.

Mound No. 11 was partially explored by tie writer by making a trench
2 feet wide and 24 feet deep through it from north to south. Nothing
was found save an arrow point, a few flint chippings, and several bowl-
derettes of drift origin, probably placed here by human hands. No evi-
dence of fire was noticed.

Mound No. 6 is of peculiar form, and for what purpose it was origi-
nally constructed is difficult to conjecture. The large expansion at the
south end is circular in basal outline, with a diameter of 40 feet and
height of 14 feet. Extending north from this portion is a long, oval,
or slightly flattened mound. The entire length of this mound, as in-
dicated in the table, is 130 feet. Some feet north from the large ex-
pansion the writer made a trench 2 feet wide across this mound, but
without finding any trace of fire or relics of any kind.

Mound No. 12 is another peculiar form, and appears to have been
raised for the same purpose as mound No. 6, whatever that may have
been. This is unexplored.

The material of all the mounds (except the ashes and charcoal men-
tioned) is a yellow homogeneous loess, with a dark humus stained layer
at the top, such as everywhere occupies the surface of the country. No
.“ dug-holes” or excavations of any kind were observed near the mounds
from which their material might have been taken. The ridge and
mounds here are covered by a heavy growth of young oaks, hickories,
poplars, ete.

On the opposite side of the valley, and slightly below this group, is
another group of five circular mounds. These occupy a position on the
brow of a ridge which commands a beautiful view of the valley and
country to the east.

As these mounds are in the main identical in form and structure with
the circular ones of the first group, a delineation of. them here is un-
necessary.

These mounds have been partially explored and the finding of human
bones in them reported. Near the mouth of Turkey Creek, 2 miles
north from the first group of mounds described, an isolated circular
mound occurs. This mound is situated on the brow of a perpendicular
cliff of Devonian limestone which rises to a height of 100 feet (by esti-
mate) above the water of the Iowa, and constitutes one of the highest
and most sightly localities of the vicinity. This mound is somewhat
higher than any of those previously described. It has been partially
explored, but with what result is unknown to the writer.

Near the flouring mill, halfa mile north from Iowa City, there occurs,
on the top of a high but rather narrow ridge, two series or lines of  cir-
cular mounds. This point commands a fine view of the surrounding
country. The mounds are usually low and from 20 to 21 feet in diame-
ter and 30 feet distant from one another. They occupy the center of
MOUNDS IN IOWA. of
the ridge, and in doing so are sometimes de ‘ected from a true north and
south line. There are from fourteen to sixteen of these mounds, a large
number of them having become almost obliterated in the cultivation of
the soil.

A portion of these mounds was explored many years ago, but with
what result we have been unable to learn.

About one-half or three-quarters of a mile to the northwest from the
mill, a row of from fourteen to sixteen long and circular mounds existed,
but most of them have now disappeared before the plow. The form
and dimensions of these mounds were about the same as those already
described at other localities.

As these mounds were long since explored, it is unknown to us what
relics, if any, were obtained.

At various other points along the Iowa River, in Johnson County,
circular and linear mounds occur. At no locality have ‘“ dug-holes,”
trenches, or other excavations been observed near the mounds which
would indicate where the material was obtained for their construction.

Aithough stone relics are rarely found in the mounds, yet field relies,
such as stone axes (sometimes very large), drill- arrow- and lance-
points, etc., are common.

It is a matter of regret that a complete record of the results obtained
in the exploration of these interesting mounds has not been kept.

ANCIENT MOUNDS IN IOWA AND WISCONSIN.

By CLEMENT L. WEBSTER, Charles City, Iowa.

Along the shores of the ‘‘ Father of Waters” in lowa and Wisconsin
there once existed large numbers of that deeply interesting but little
known race, the mound-builders. How long the shores of this mighty
river continued to be the home of portions of this race, can not even be
conjectured. But the valleys and blufts of this cliff-bound river are
dotted with the monuments of these departed people.

Large numbers of these ancient mounds have been explored and the
record given to the world of science, while perhaps a still larger num-
ber have been explored and the records and relies lost.

In this paper is chronicled the result of explorations in a few of these
ancient mounds. These explorations were made by Dr. W. T. Knapp,
now of Charles City, lowa, and to whom I am indebted for most of the
following facts :

In the town and vicinity of Guttenberg, which is located on the level
flood-plain of the valley of the Mississippi, on the west or Iowa side of
the river, are located large numbers of small circular and long mounds,
most of which were reared apparently by the present Indian race.

Large numbers of these mounds have been opened by those incited
merely by curiosity, and many valuable facts and relics obtained only
to be so on irreparably lost.

Nearly, if not quite all, these mounds contained, in greater or less
abundance, implements, ornaments, etc., of copper, silver, and stone, as
well as human remains.

Some of the mounds here are 124 feet in length, and contain great
quantities of human bones. Numbers of these burials have been made
in recent time and have been witnessed (so claimed) by white men now
living. Most of the burials are those of Indians.

One mound at Guttenberg opened by Dr. Knapp was circular, 16 feet
in diameter at the base, and 3 to 4 feet in height. In the center, 2 feet
below the surface of the ground at the base of the mound, was discov-
ered a human skeleton, the bones being in a fairly well preserved con-
dition. On each side of the head was found a large circular silver
ornament, 2 inches in diameter, which, from their position, would indi-

598

cate that they had been worn suspended from the ears. With the body
was also found a number of flint arrow points. There was no evidence
that fire had been employed at this burial. The material of the mound
was rather soft, moist soil. There seems to be no doubt but that this
burial was that of an Indian.

About 44 miles west from Guttenberg, on the steep side of a deep
ravine, through which Miners Creek courses its way, was a burial mound,
This mound was located about 60 feet above the bed of the creek, and
was some 7 feet wide and 10 feet long. Excavations in this mound re-
vealed the presence of a well-preserved human skeleton, together with
stone arrow points, pestle, pipe, and other implements of stone. The
pipe (which the writer has personally examined) was a beautiful and
finely wrought specimen, made from red pipe-stone. The soil from
which this mound was constructed was soft—considerably softer than
the earth surrounding it. This was doubtless an Indian burial.

On the brow of a bold perpendicular bluff, which rises some 250 feet
above Buck Creek, near where it empties into the Mississippi and be-
tween 5 and 6 miles southeast from Garnavillo, Iowa, an earthen mound
occurs. This mound had a circular basal outline and oval top; was 34
feet in height and nearly 24 feet in diameter. In the center and 24 feet
below the surface of the soil sur i ding it a finely preserved human
skeleton was discovered. The body had been placed at length, with the
head to the north and the feet to the south. The temple of this indi-
vidual had been crushed in as if by a heavy blow from some blunt in-
strument, and which had doubtless been the cause of death. No imple-
ments or ornaments were reported found with this body.

The material from which this mound had been made was not packed,
as is frequently the case with many other ancient mounds in different
portions of the State. The summit of this bluff was covered with tim-
ber, and one large “‘hard maple” tree, about 2 feet in diameter, occupied
the surface of the mound.

Near Buena Vista, in Clinton County, lowa, between 3 and 4 miles
west from the Mississippi, there occurs on the summit of a high hill
a very interesting ancient mound. On exploring it a rude. box, con-
structed out of large stone slabs, was discovered, and in it the remains
of a human skeleton. The body had been placed at length, with the
head to the nerth and the feet to the south. In the box with the body
a large quantity of stone implements, as arrow points, axes, etc., were
found.

Near Cassville, Wis., a sub-circular mound, 40 feet in diameter and 5
feet in height, is situated. This mound is located on the flood-plain
(above the reach of high water) of the Mississippi, and less than 100
feet back from the margin of the stream. A partial exploration of
this mound was made, and human bones discovered, some 2 feet be-
jow the base. With the human remains was found a considerable quan-
tity of stone implements, among the most interesting of which were

a number of hoes or spades, two of the finest of which are now in the
author’s collection. ‘These hoes were made from chert, probably derived
from the Silurian rocks of the region, which in places contain great
quantities of nodules of this material. The largest hoe in the writer’s
possession has been rather roughly chipped out; is 4 inches in length
and 2 inches in width; the lateral margins nearly straight or slightly
curved, the anterior end rather broadly rounded, and the posterior trune-
ate. The smaller specimen is cordate in outline, 2? inches in length,
~4 inches in greatest width, and abruptly truncate posteriorly. Grow-
ing on the surface near the center of the mound was an oak tree 24 feet
in diameter.

Near the last mound was another circular mound, 15 feet in diameter
and between 3 and 4 feet in height. Close to the center of the mound,
and 24 feet below its base, a single human skeleton was unearthed.
The body had been placed on its back with the head to the north. The
knees were drawn up to the breast, the elbows bent, and the hands
brought to the sides of the face. With the body were found large num-
bers of copper ornaments, which, from their position, showed that they
had been used as Jeg and arm ornaments. Judging from the structure
and delicacy of the bones, this body was that of a woman. Fire had
apparently not been used at this burial.

On the Mississippi, 6 miles north from Glen Haven, Wisconsin, are
situated four or five ancient burial mounds. These mounds are com-
posed of sand and are from 18 to 20 feet in height and from 20 to 30
feet in diameter.

Owing to the fact that the owner of the land on which two of these
mounds are located was unwilling that these works should be disturbed,
the internal structure and contents of them is unknown. Onue of this
group of mounds, partially explored by Dr. Knapp, contained large
quantities of human bones.

Near Glen Haven is an interesting Indian grave. This grave is
located on a flat ledge of rock on the bank of the Mississippi, 50 feet
above the stream and at the base of the bluffs which form the valley
side, and which rise from 200 to 300 feet above the water in the stream.
A few feet from this grave a spring of water issues from the rocks.
The body had been placed at length in a rude box made of slabs of
limestone and with the head to the north and feet to the south. Over
this box a small earthen mound had been raised. With the body were
found (lying near the breast) large numbers of stone implements, as
axes, arrow points, skinners, pestles, ete., some of them objects of much
interest. One or two old pioneers of the region, who claim to have been
present at the burial of this Indian, assert that it was that of the half-
brother of Black Hawk. As to the truthfulness of this statement,
however, we do not vouch.

The measurements of the mounds and their exact position relative to
known points given in the foregoing description may be regarded as only
approximate,

Method of flint-chipping.—Some years ago Dr. Knapp, while making a
reconnaissance of ** Twelve-mile Island,” in the Mississippi near Gutten-
berg, lowa, made the acquaintance of a roving band of the Pottawatomie
Indians who were encamped for the time on this island. While among
them he witnessed the process of flint arrow-point manufacturing as
carried on by this band, and as the writer has not observed a descrip-
tion of this process in print before, a short account of it is here given.

A tree from 12 to 20 inches in diameter was selected and a large
notch or cavity 6 inches in depth was made in one side of the trunk at
a sufficient distance from the ground to allow of a person occupying a
sitting posture on the ground to work this “instrument” with facility.
The upper portion or roof of this cavity sloped obliquely downward;
the farther side was perpendicular and the bottom horizontal. On the
bottom of this cavity a small even slab of rock of some hard material
was placed. A short distance above this rock a small hole or notch
was made in the farther side of the cavity. Into this notch was in-
serted the “leg bone of a deer,” and under this was placed, edgewise
and resting on the basal rock below, the piece of stone to be wrought,
this possessing the quality of conchoidal fracture. The implement was
then deftly worked out by pressure of the carefully manipulated cylin-
drical bone.

The size of the instrument to be wrought was regulated by moving
the specimen farther from or near to the outer margin of the basal rock.

This description may be further illustrated by the following cut (Fig.
9) from a rude sketch of the “instrument” made by Dr. Knapp:

Fig. 9.—(a) Cavity cut in the tree; (b) cylindrical bone of “ deer’s leg;” (c) stone

Another method of flint arrow-point making (which we have not
seen noted elsewhere) practiced by some of the existing tribes of In-
dians was described to the writer by Hon. 8. P. Leland, of Charles City.
This method was observed by Mr. Leland as he was among some of the
Indian tribes of the Western Territories a few years since.

This process consisted in the application of heat and pressure. First,
three stones of some hard material not easily acted upon by heat, of a
rounded form, about 5 inches in diameter and 6 inches in length, were
placed in the fire and heated hot. Then a fragment of stone of suit-
able size and quality was selected to be wrought. One of the stones
was then taken from the fire and applied with pressure to the edge of
the piece of stone to be worked, this causing chips or flakes to be broken
from the piece. While the first stone was still hot it was replaced in
the fire and a second one taken out and used as the first. This process
was repeated until the work in hand was finished. By this method
beautiful arrow points were wrought.
MOUNDS OF THE WESTERN PRAIRIES.

By CLEMENT L. WEBSTER, Charles City, Iowa.

In travelling over the beautiful prairies of the West the attention of
the traveller is struck by the beauty and number of the flowering plants
which are presented to view on every hand, their bright yellow, blue,
pink, and other varied colors and hues being in happy contrast to the
rich green of the prairie grass among which they mingle. The differ-
ent portions of this emerald expanse, as high and low, wet and dry,
support, to a greater or less extent, their own peculiar flora. The fine-
ness, coarsness, richness, or sterility of the soil of its different parts
have often a marked effect upon the distribution of many of its species.

Regions much trodden over by the cattle, on the large Western
ranges, present beautiful fields of gold, in the latter portion of the sea-
son, by the blooming of myriads of plants of the order Composite,
many of which are represented by the genera Vernonia, ete.

Another characteristic which attracts the attention of the traveller
who for the first time passes over this beautiful region is the searcity or
absence of all arboreal vegetation, the only timber of this region being
confined to the margins of some of the streams which meander through
it and the small isolated groves which occur upon it.

But a widely prevalent feature, which attracts perhaps no less in-
terest but more speculation, even among many of those who have long
inhabited these prairies, is the great number of isolated or grouped
mounds which are seen over the surface, and which are often denomi-
nated by the inhabitants as Indian mounds. These mounds are gen-
erally circular and have an oval or flattened top with a diameter at the
base of from 4 to 20 feet, and commonly rise to a height of from 1 to 3
feet.

Although the marginal outline of these mounds is usually circular,
still at times some of them are oblong or have a gently flowing contour.
These mounds are either isolated from 5 rods to 1 mile from one another,
or are closely and irreguiarly grouped, or grouped into rude circles, semi-
circles, or even straight lines. In some instances, as many as sixteen
of these mounds have been counted in an area containing about 2 acres.

The location of these mounds is almost exclusively in the prairie
regions and may be found on high and dry or low and rather moist

land. In Iowa and southern Minnesota, where these mounds have been
most studied by me, they may be seen for many miles over the level
prairies of these regions.

During the summer and early autumn they are usually clothed with
a very luxuriant and rank growth of perennial plants, most prominent
among which are observed Calamagrestis canadensis, Vernonia pascicu-
lata, ete. These rise to a heigit of from 4 to 13 feet above the surface
of the ground at the base of the mound, and thus constitute a very con-
spicuous feature of the surface.

Although the external appearance of these mounds is analogous to
that of some of the Indian mounds of Iowa and other States, still they
may be distinguished from those of the mound-builders by their rel-
ative position and the region occupied, as well as by their greater irreg-
ularity of contour.

For more than twenty-five years [ have resided in the prairie regions
of the West, and have thus been afforded a fine opportunity to study the
origin and development of these ‘‘singular” mounds. By far the greater
number of them owe their origin to the pouched gopher (Saccomyide
bursarius), that year by year has made additions to them by dirt brought
forth in the extension of their under-ground channels until they finally
assume the proportions now seen. Upon the death of the animal, or
for some other cause, these mounds and channels are finally abandoned
and the mounds left to be taken possession of by the indigenous plants
of the region, which are always, under such circumstances, of much
ranker growth than is usual under other conditions.

-Others of these mounds are developed by the American badger (Taride
americana) and the prairie wolf (Canis latrans), The mounds formed by
the badger and wolf may be distinguished from those of the pouched
gopher by their large and partially filled burrows. The burrows of the
badger are always located upon the highest and dryest portions of the
region, and those of the prairie wolf usually upon the border of ** runs”
or general surface drainage depressions of the country. These mounds
have sometimes been described and published as works of the “‘ mound-
builders.”

THE TWANA, CHEMAKUM, AND KLALLAM INDIANS, OF
WASHINGTON TERRITORY.

By Rev. Myron EELLs.

NAMES AND SITUATIONS OF THESE TRIBES.

Twanas.—The name of the Twanas is spelled Too-au-hooch, in their
treaty. The Klallams pronounce it Tu-an’-hu. The Twanas say Tu-
ad-hu. The difference between the Klallam and the Twana language
here exemplified is often observed—the Klallam being the more nasal.
These various pronunciations have been shortened into Twana, now
used in all governmental reports. It is said to mean a portage, and to
be derived from the portage between the head of Hood’s Canal and the
main waters of the Sound, where the Indian, by carrying his canoe 3
miles, avoids rowing around a peninsula 50 miles long.

These Indians originally occupied both sides of Hood’s Canal, and
were divided into three bands, the Du-hle-lips, Skokomish, and Kolsids.
The Du-hle lips lived at the head of the canal, where a small stream
empties into it, now called Du-lay-lip. Fifteen miles below them were
the Skokomish, who lived around the mouth of the river of that name,
now their reservation. This word is pronounced Ska-ka-bish by the
Twanas and Ska-ka-mish by the Klallams. The Americans have
changed it to Skokomish, and thus they universally spell the name of
the river, reservation, and post-office. Dr. Gibbs, in vol. 1, “‘Contribu-
tions to North American Ethnology,” gives this as the name of the tribe,
but it was originally the name of only one band. Yet even now, because
of its being the name of the reservation and river, these Indians are
known fully as well by the name Skokomish to the whites on the Sound
as by the name Twana. Skokomish means the “River People;” ka, sig-
nifying fresh water, is doubled to denote one form of the plural, proba-
bly because of the size of the river, which is by far the largest that
empties into the canal. The termination ish is very common for the
Indian names of tribes and streams on the Sound. Lincline to the opin-
ion that it comes from what is called the oid original form of plural in
the Twana language—the suffix obish.

There are two ways of forming the plural—one by reduplication, the
other by adding this termination; both seem to be combined in this
word. The prefix letter o is, I have often noticed, in other words.

605
606 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS,

In conversation I have heard them pronounce the names of the tribes
Makah and Haidah, S’ma-kah and S’haidah, and yet when I have asked
how they pronounce the names of those tribes they would reply Ma-kah
and Haidah. Many times, too, in collecting common words they have
been pronounced as beginning with an s, and in a second pronunciation
the letter would be dropped. After careful inquiry I have gererally
concluded to drop the s as the more correct. When first used by the
whites the whole word was written ‘S’Kokomish.

Thirty miles below this band were the Kol-sids, as pronounced by
themselves (or Kol-sins by the Klallams), who lived around the bay of
that name and the mouth of the Dos-wail-opsh River. Their name is
now variously spelled by the whites: Colcins, Colcene, Colseed, and
Quil-cene. These three bands were not always at peace, but sometimes
waged petty war with each other. For twenty years, however, they have
mostly been collected on the same reservation, have been on good terms
with one another, and have intermarried, so that the band distinctions
are rapidly becoming obsolete. Yet, when the older Du-hle-lips have
the reservation for fishing they are apt to go to their old waters, and
the same is true of the Kol-sids.

The dialects of the different bands formerly varied a little: Thus the
word for go in Du-hle-lip was bi-se-dab, but in Sko-ko-mish bi-hé-dab. At
‘the present time, not finding it practicable in collecting the vocabulary
to separate the dialects, I have gathered most of the words from older
school-boys who have been brought up on the reservation and familiar
with the ditferent dialects which are now rapidly merging’ into one.

At present most of these Indians live on the reservation. A few fami-
lies live between it and Seabeck, 30 miles north of the reservation; about
thirty persons make Seabeck their home, where the men earn their
money mainly by working in the saw-mill and the women by washing.

Although the Skw-aksin tribe by treaty and language belong to the
Nisqually Indians, yet about thirty of that tribe, since the selection of
the Skokomish reservation, have moved to it and become incorporated
with the Twanas. They have done so because their own people are
scattered and nearly extinct as a tribe and because of the nearness of
the reservation to their old haunts and numerous marriages between
them and the Twanas, They use their own language for the most part,
but the majority understand the Twana, and the Twanas undérstand
them.

Chémakums.—In the treaty their name is written Chemakum; George
Gibbs writes it Tsemakun; J. G. Swan spells it Chem-a-kum, which rep-
resents the way in which both the Indians and whites of this region
pronounce it. The whites calla prairie by this name. Its origin or
meaning I can not learn. These people call themselves A-hwa-ki-lu.
They occupied the land from the mouth of Hood’s Canal to Port Dis-
covery Bay. According to their tradition and that of the Kwilleuts,
they originally came from the latter tribe, who live on the Pacific coast
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 607

south of Cape Flattery, 125 miles distant, and from whom they are now
separated by the Clallams and Makahs. In regard to this, J. G. Swan
says that the Kwilleuts have a tradition that a long time ago there was
a very high and sudden tide, which took four days to ebb, after which
a portion of the tribe made their way to the vicinity of Port Townsend,
and are known asChemakums. The latter tribe have a similar tradi-
tion. The Chemakum numerals seem to corroborate this legend. They
are said to have been originally a war-like tribe, not very numerous, but
strong and brave. They had a village at the head of Port Townsend
Bay called Tséts-i-bis, which was a kind of a capital for nearly all the
tribes on the Sound, where they occasionally collected. George Gibbs,
in 1852, states that their number is ninety, but they are now virtually
extinct, there being only ten left who are not legally married to white
men or into other tribes. Of these ten there is only one complete fam-
ily, four in number. With the exception of two or three very old per-
sons, they now mainly speak the Klallam language. They say that their
diminution was caused by small-pox, but probably war had something
to do with it, as Gibbs says they have been engaged in wars with the
Makah, Klallam, Twana, Snokomish, and Duwamish. Indians, by whom
their power has been broken.

Klallams.—In the treaty this name is spelled S’Klallam, but I am in-
clined to think that the ‘‘s” is the same as that in S’kokomish. Other
tribes now call them Klallam, from which the whites have derived this
word ; but it evidently originated from their own name for themselves,
Nu-sklaim, meaning a strong people, for they were formerly a strong
tribe. Their territory at one time extended from Port Discovery Bay
to the Hoko River, on the northern coast of Washington Territory. The
treaty expected them to go to the reservation, and the Government was
to furnish the means for this purpose. This was never done, and they
have never been moved, except that some have occasionally been taken
there for a limited period as punishment for crime. At present many
of them have moved further up the Sound to obtain work. Their vil-
lages are now as follows:

(1) Opposite Seabeck, where for a long time about thirty have lived,
but of late all but about a dozen have moved to Port Gamble. Their
main dependence for money is from their work at the saw-mill.

(2) Opposite Port Gamble, across the bay, 20 miles north of Seabeck,
are about one hundred who earn their money principally at the saw-
mills there. This village is enlarging and has a small Catholic church.

(3) Around Port Ludlow, 6 miles north of the last place, are nine
who depend on the saw-mill there for their living.

(4) In and around Port Townsend, 13 miles north of Port Ludiow, are
about twenty. More would live there, as from the size of the place they
could easily find work, but the facilities for obtaining whisky are so
great the agent has forbidden them to come there.

(5) Around Port Discovery, 14 miles west of the last place, are nearly
608 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

forty Indians who gain their livelihood mainly from the saw-mills at that
place.

(6) Fifteen miles northwest of them is Sequim, where there are forty
more. Most of these are old or infirm people who get their food chiefly
from the water, but make some money by canoeing for the whites to
Port Discovery and Port Townsend.

(7) Six miles north of Sequim is Jamestown, near Dunginess, in and
near which are about one hundred. Six years ago these Indians were
so worthless (being almost constantly drunk) that the surrounding
whites were considering the subject of petitioning the agent to remove
them. Hearing of this the leading ones, as they did not wish to be
taken from the home of their fathers, determined toreform. Gathering
together their money they bought 210 acres of land, divided it among
themselves according to the amount of money furnished by each, and
have been steadily improving it. They have also improved in morals
until they are now the most civilized and prosperous band of the whole
tribe. Their village fronts the water and the houses are on one street,
which is straight and presents quite a neat appearance. This is the
home of the head chief of the tribe, and they have a school, church,
and jail. They gain their living by agriculture and by working and
canoeing for the neighboring farmers.

(8) Eighteen miles farther west is Port Angeles, where there are about
thirty-five Indians nominally resident. Many years ago the United
States custom-house was at this place, work abundant, and the Indian
village lively; but the custom-house was afterwards removed to Port
Townsend, the whites left, and employment became searce. Many of
them live at other places a good share of the year, and when at home
they make some money by canoeing for the few whites to Dunginess,
Port Discovery, Port Townsend, and Victoria.

(9) Eight miles west of them is Elkwa, Elwhah, or Elwah, a village
of seventy-five. These once formed a very strong band of the tribe,
being almost independent of the others, but they are not so now. They
live largely on fish, but canoe considerably to Victoria and Dunginess
for the few whites near them, and some of them spend considerable
time at other places working, and go to the Makah waters for seals.
Three men here and one at Port Angeles have taken homesteads a mile
or two back from the salt water, and are the only members of the tribe
who live so far away from it.

(10) Thirty miles farther west is Pisht, with thirty Indians.

(11) Ten miles still farther west are Klallam Bay and Hoko, with
forty more. These live more on fish and after the old Indian style than
the rest of the tribe. They, however, canoe and seal some and gather
salmon and halibut for a cannery recently established there. { can
learn of only two dialects spoken by this tribe; the Elkwas and those
west of them being said to speak as if with thicker tongues than those
east of them, and so to pronounce some words somewhat differently.

The vocabulary which I have obtained is from the eastern members
of the tribe, but I do not understand that there is enough difference to
make it advisable to do anything with the other.

Besides the Indians just mentioned there are about seventy-five more
in various places who properly beiong to the tribe. Many of these are
pow on the northern side of the Straits of Fuca, in British Columbia.

The three tribes here spoken of are so nearly alike in their manners
and customs that I have thought it best to describe them together,
simply noticing the points in which they differ. To have described
them separately would have involved much useless repetition.

The Klallams believe that they were all, except the Chemakums,
created where they now are; and also that nearly all other tribes and
nations were created each one where it now lives. They have no relia-
ble knowledge of their own history earlier than the recollections of the
oldest Indian.

In obtaining their names for various articles I have often found that
persons of eighteen or even twenty-five years of age do not know the
names for stone arrow-heads, axes, chisels, anchors, rain-stones, and the
like, which went out of use soon after the whites came. This shows
how quickly the past is forgotten with them. The following stories
were mostly written for me by a Twana school-boy, as they were told
him by his father:

*“ Quecn North and the Colcine Indians.—While the Colcine Indians
were at peace in their habitations, a girl went out and looked into a
house and saw many of their enemies (in her mind) getting ready to go
into every house of the Colcines. She returned and told her master’s
family, but they would not believe her. The same day a boy went to
get some water; when he looked into the water he saw some shadows,
which were smiling, and these were the Queen North Indians; so he
went home in haste to tell his parents, but they would not believe him.
The girl took one of her master’s sons and hid in the woods. Hence
these Indians were not afraid, and so were all killed, except the girl, the
little boy, and one man, for the Queen North Indians went into every
house and slew the Colcines. One man took his small babe and ran
away. His enemies pursued him, and when he saw they were about to
overtake him he laid down his child and began to swim the bay. The
Queen North Indians knew that they could not swim after the man, so
they took his child and cut it in pieces. When the girl came back she
found her master dead, because he would not believe her.”

** The Victoria Indians and two families.—Two families were travelling
together, and at night they lodged. While they were there some one
shot from the woods, and when they looked they saw some Indians.
One family went off as fast as they could, but the other had left their
child near a log. The Victoria Indians tvok him, but his father got
ready and fired at them, and they restored the child. My father thought

H, Mis. 600-———39
610 ANTILROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

that if they should shoot at their enemies they would think them brave
and be afraid. The child that was taken captive is still living, and the
daughter of the brave man is also alive.”

< Queen North again.—A fter the battle the Colcines went out to search -

for their enemies, whom at last they found. Then they made a great
shelf over their own beds. Their enemies came and were placed under
the shelf, and one of them took a wife from the daughters of the Col-
cines. After a long time they laid themselves down on their beds, and
the Colcines cut the ropes which held up the shelf. It fell down on the
heads of the Queen North Indians,and none of them escaped. Once
the Colcines bored some holes in the bottom of their canoes wheu their
enemies came to see them. As they went home the Colcines started to

take them across the bay. When they were in the middle of the bay ~

they took out the sticks, the water came into the canoesand filled them.
The Queen North Indians were drowned, but the Colcines were saved,
because their neighbors went to them and helped them. So the Col-
cines prevailed over their enemies, and there was peace.”

‘‘ Story of another family.—There was a man with his wife and chil-
dren. One woman, who was very fair, was walking with a babe and
some boys and girls. This was the daughter of the sick man, but when
she came home she found some other Indians slaying the family, and
her father was killed. These took hold of her; one wanted her, another
wanted her, and all wanted her, and so they killed her, and none had
her. The man’s wife dug deep in the ground, put one of her daughters
there and covered her over; she did also the same for herself, and an-
other person climbed a tree, and none saw her, so three were Jeft alive.
The man was sick, and yet they showed him no mercy.”

“A fight with a grizzly bear.—A long time ago a man came to the
canal to marry a wife. He found one, and gave some things to her
father. The woman loved the man, but her father did not like his son-
in-law, but threw away the things which the man gave him, hence the
mai went home. After awhile this woman and some others went to
gather berries. My mother’s mother was among them. The woman
had a companion, and the two went away from their comrades where
they saw the bear, but they did not fear it, they simply talked ‘about it,
and made fun. The bear went off, but after a time they saw it again,

wher. they talked just as at first. The bear went around tothe woman -

who wished to marry the man and suddenly jumped at her. The other
woman went to help her, but soon received some wounds, so that she left
and went to tell her other comrades, while the woman kept fighting
with the bear. Poorwoman! Sheecalled aloud to her companions to help
her, but they ran home to tell the news. She was soon killed, but her
friends told her parents, and that night very many people gathered

together with spears, arrows, and knives to fight the bear. When they °

reached the place they told the woman’s parents to stand on a fallen
tree, so that they would be safe, Then they surrounded the bear and

———.
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 611

had a great fight. They shot the bear and wounded her on each side,
but after a while she ran away and they ran after her. But after a time
they had ne more arrows or spears, with the exception of two or three
young men, who still followed her. When they reached a muddy place
the bear stood on her hind legs and danced. The young men became
frightened and ran back. When they looked at the dead woman they
found very many wounds in her.”

Notr.—Thus far I have given the stories just as they were written
for me by the sehool-boy. The last one I presume is true in the main,
as I have heard it from several parties.

The Twanas relate that a long time ago they were camped in a scat-
tered condition on Hood’s Canal, nearly 10 miles south of Seabeck.
The Klallams came and killed those farthest north, taking some girls
captives. Those farthest south were afraid, and some wished to flee,
but others said no. The Clallams, however, did not come to them, but
returned. Four or five captives were taken.

History by the whites.*—George Gibbs says the first visit by the whites
of which we have any knowledge was in 1789, by Captain Hendrick, of
the Washington, orin 1790 by Lieutenant Quimper, Spanish, in the Princess
Royal. They came as far as Dunginess. Two other vessels came a year
or a year and a half later, but they did not go above Port Discovery.
In 1792 came Vancouver, who gives the first account extant of these
Indians. He visited the three tribes, Skokomish (Twana), Tsemakumg,
and Klallams, and was probably the first who ascended Hood’s Canal.
After that, until within about thirty years, the greater part of their in-
tercourse was with the Hudson Bay Company, who had no fort in their
land, though it had one to the north at Victoria and another to the
east at Nisqually. During these thirty years the Americans have sup-
planted the British traders. We have erected saw-mills, stores, and
towus, and have cultivated farms in the midst of these Indians.

In 1855-56 the Indians on the eastern part of the sound were engaged
in war with the whites, but neither of these tribes, as tribes, engaged
in it, and they have never been at war with us. <A few of the Twanas
crossed the sound and joined the other Indians in that war, but white
men lived among the Twanas during the whole war in safety. January
_ 26,1855, atreaty was made with the three tribes at Point No Point, which

was ratified by the Senate March 8, 1859, and proclaimed by the Presi-
dent on the 29th of the following April.

The Indians chose a place near the mouth of the Skokomish River in
the Twana land for their reservation. By the terms of the treaty a
blacksmith, carpenter, farmer, physician, and school-teacher, with an-
nuity goods, were to be furnished them for twenty years. An agent or
sub-agent has also been furnished to them. The first agents were ap-
pointed under the political plan, which lasted until 1869, when the mil-

itary took charge for about a year, and then another political agent
was appointed. In 1871, under General Grant’s religious or peace policy,
the nomination of the agent was assigned to the American Missionary
Association, since which time there has been no change.

The census for 1578, the last full one taken, gives their population as
follows:

Twanas: Men 68, women 84, children 78, unknown 20; total, 250.

Klallais: Men 149, women 171, children 147, unknown 80; total, 597.

Chemakums: Men 5, women 4, children 4; total, 13.

Total of three tribes, 800.

Gibbs, in the volume of North American Ethnology already referred
to, gives as the census for 1852, or thereabouts, Twanas 290, Chema-
kums 90, and Klallams 926; total, 1,306. 1 have some reasons for think-
ing his estimate too low.

Mr. H. C. Hale, whose father was for a time superintendent of Indian
affairs in this Territory, has informed me that he at one time, many years
ago, soon after the treaty was made, issued rations to twenty-eight hun-
dred Indians at this agency; but probably there were more present than
belonged to the three tribes, as other Indians would be likely to come
at such atime. Again, I get no estimate from any old settler that there
were less than two and a half times as many twenty years ago as now,
and some estimate them at five times as many then as now.

A census of the Indians is very difficult to obtain, and this may be
one reason why Gibbs placed them so low. In the winter of 1877-78
the agent traveled from Skokomish to Elkwa and obtained the names of
four hundred and fifteen Klallams between Seabeck and Hoko, and esti-
mated that there were one hundred more of them on the British Colum-
biaside. Two months later I was at Dunginess to observe a potlatch,
where every village of the tribe was well represented, and obtained the
names of abont forty-five more, and most of these lived between Elkwa
and Hoko, in the region where the agent had not traveled. The Elkwa
Indians, although living not more than 40 miles from the most distant
of these tribes, had failed to remember many of them.

I see no reason why the country might not have supported a large
number of Indians, for while they get quite a share of their living from
the waters of the sound now, the whites are exporting to California and
other places salmon, halibut, and clams from their waters.

Mr. Finlayson, of the Hudson Bay Company, made a count of the —

Klallams in 1845 and ascertained their number to be 1,760.

Gibbs* (1852-1855) gives 926 Klallams, 90 Chemakums, and 290
Twanas. In 1870 a census was taken by the Indian Department which
gives the names of 194 men, Klallams and Chemakums, 233 women, 97
boys, 81 girls, 15 infants, unknown 11; total, 631. Twenty-seven of these
were Chemakums, 291 Twanas.

These Indians have undoubtedly decreased greatly since their first

INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 613

intercourse with the whites. The Klallams and Chemakums have de-
creased more rapidly than the Twanas. An accurate census of the
Twanas in 1875 gave 259 in all the families which I am now able aceur-
ately to trace. In 1879 there were in the same families 259 persons.

Until within a few years intemperance has been one of the greatest
foes to the lives of these Indians. The Klallam head chief has said that
five hundred Indians have been killed by the saloons of Dunginess
within twenty years. This is probably an exaggeration, but nota very
wide one. The diseases consequent upon licentiousness and consump-
tion have caused the death of many. Atavery early day, too, small-
pox undoubtedly worked great destruction, and whooping cough and
measles have made havoc among the children. All of these diseases
except consumption were introduced by the whites.

As the subject of the increase and decrease of the Indians has been
quite widely discussed of late, I submit the following suggestions: On
the first contact with the whites they decrease, but if the tribes are
large and keep together somewhat compactly, ana there is comparatively
little intercourse with the whites, except on the outer edge, and whole-
some efforts are made to civilize them, they do not diminish rapidly, and
when somewhat civilized they begin to increase, as Drs. Riggs and
Williamson, of Dakota, state. But where the tribes are small and the
intercourse with worthless whites is considerable their decrease is rapid,
and sometimes a tribe will become extinct before it has time to rally.
This has been the case with the Chemakums.

Progress —This has not been uniform in all localities and with all
classes, those on the reservation and near the whites having pro-
gressed the most, while in the most favored places the older Indians
have not changed much. Asa whole, these tribes may now be called
more than half civilized. The Twanas have progressed more than the
Klallams, chiefly because they have had more instruction and help from
the Government; yet, many of the latter tribe have made as strong
individual efforts as their more fortunate brethren to improve their con-
dition.

In regard to food, the estimate of the agent for 1878 is that 75 per
cent. is obtained by Indian labor in civilized pursuits and 25 by hunting,
fishing, and by gathering roots and berries. The Twanas generally
have tables and some have table-cloths.

I was lately present at one feast where tables, white table-cloths,
chairs, dishes, and civilized food had entirely superseded the old style
equipments and provisions. On the Ist of July, 1878, they prepared a
long table out-doors, with seats and a stove near by to warm tea, coffee,
etc., with a full suppiy of dishes and food, much the same as the whites
on this coast would have done at a feast.

Many have abandoned the old way of smoking the salmon, their native

food, and have adopted the American style of salting it. Potatoes, flour,
614 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

and sugar are almost as indispensable to them as to the whites, while
they also purchase pork and beef, rice, beans, coffee, tea, butter, yeast-
powders, saleratus, salt, lard, spices, sirup, dried and green apples,
crackers, cherries, and pears; and raise in their gardens corn, peas,
beans, onions, turnips, beets, carrots, parsnips, cabbages, and rasp-
berries.

Medicines.—They are slow to use the white man’s medicine (although
on the reservation they are furnished free of charge), often preferring
their old remedies in slight cases of illness, and in severe cases their
tamanous. Ifa medicine cures quickly they like it; butif after a few
days they are not well, they abandonit. Those who live off the reserva-
tion seldom have any treatment except in the old style.

Houses.—Most ot the Twanas and a large number of the Klallams east
of Port Angeles build their houses in the style of the whites, with floors
and stoves or fire-places, and often their houses have two or three
rooms. These now dislike the ground and dirt floor, the smoke and the
communal room. Some of the women regularly wash their floors, but
with the majority there is room for improvement in this respect. The
rooms have been almost entirely changed from the old one-sided shed
style of long boards to two-sided roofs of shakes or shingles. Whenever
they can they buy sawed lumber, locks, and windows. Brooms, chairs,
and benches are in common use. It seems still, however, somewhat
difficult for many of the women to sit on chairs when sewing; they then
prefer a mat on the floor. Many have some kind of civilized bedstead,
but there are still a large number of the old-fashioned kind fastened to
the wall all around the room. Carpets or rugs are very scarce. Mats,
baskets, and ladles are in common use, and still manufactured, but are
steadily yielding to American articles for similar purposes, while dishes,
knives, forks, cups, lamps, and buckets are used by a large number.
When they are logging they live very nearly as well as their white
neighbors in the same business.

Clothes.—I have never seen one of these Indians dressed in the old
native style, but there are some of the older ones and those more re-
mote from the towns who wrap themselves in a blanket when at home,
only putting on their civilized clothes when going abroad. This is more
common among the Clallams than among the Twanas. On the Sabbath
and on public occasions they appear well dressed, mostly clean, and
some quite tastily robed. At such times hats, linen coats, white shirts,
broadcloth coats, woolen and calico dresses and good shawls are com-
mon. The only exceptions in respect to dress reform are among the
women, who have been slow to adopt shoes, and still seldom wear any
head covering, except a shawl. The ornaments formerly worn in the
nose have been entirely abandoned. Other ornaments, such as finger-
rings, ear-pendants, bracelets, and the like, except among the aged and
conservative, are mostly purchased of the whites. Tattooing is going
out of practice, many of the older Indians being ashamed of the figures
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 615

on themselves. Painting of the face is not common, except at the tam-
anous feasts and potlatches, and sometimes when gambling. Mirrors,
brushes, combs, and soap of American manufacture are commonly in
use.

Implements.—The native articles for general use, war and the chase,
fire-making, building, and agriculture are almost entirely abandoned,
and those of civilized make have taken their places. In fishing they
use many ‘of the old style articles, as they see no advantage in giving
them up; but when they see something that is an improvement and
they can obtain it, they are not slow to do so. Native tools for leather-
working and working fiber are more common than American ones, but
knitting, carding wool, and sewing are entirely reformed. Paints and
ropes are mostly American.

Travelling.—They cling to their canoes, for they are lighter and swifter
than American boats.

American standards are used in measuring and valuing. Their music
is mostly native, and so their art-work.*

Social customs.—Most of the Twanas under forty years have been mar-
ried in our style as well as theirs, but none of the Klallams, except
those who are land owners, as otherwise the property would not descend
to their children. Permanent marriages is becoming quite common, and
polygamy is dying out. New polygamous marriages are not allowed,
and there are but ten men in both tribes who have more than one wife
each. Slavery is dead. Potlatches are said to be growing somewhat
less frequent than formerly, some having abandoned them entirely.
The custom, though, has a strong hold on the northern Klallams.- The
majority of the able-bodied men among the Twanas and those of the
Klallams who live at Seabeck, Port Gamble, Port Discovery, and around
Jamestown, and a few others are engaged in civilized labor, the
Twanas being occupied as farmers, loggers, and day laborers, and the
Klallams mainly in saw-mills and as day laborers. They raised in 1878
1,125 bushels of vegetables, 120 tons of hay, and 20 bushels of grain;
cut 100 cords of wood; owned 72 horses and 68 cattle, and cultivated
150 acres of land—an inerease over 1872 of 900 bushels of vegetables,
30 tons of hay, and 18 cattle, and a decrease of 30 bushels of grain and
28 horses. Their principal crops are hay and potatoes.

In 1878 a number of them voluntarily gave a day’s work each as their
contribution to the road taxes of the country. Children are cradled
mainly in the old style, but the custom of flattening the head is dying
out.

Morals.—There is progress here, but it is slow. There is very little
theft among the Twanas, more among the Klallams, but not a large
amount. Falsehood and profanity are common, and it is difficult to in-
duce them to abandon either. In regard to chastity they also improve.

SURROUNDINGS.

Outline and size of Territory, elevation, and water systems.—Reserva-
tion near the head of Hood’s Canal on Puget Sound in Washington Ter-
ritory, and at the mouth of the Skokomish River. It is nearly square,
and comprises about 5,000 acres; two-thirds of it but a few feet above
tide- water, the other third mountainous and several hundred feet high.
The Skokomish is the only river which, coming from the north in the
Olympic range of mountains, flows east on the south side of the reser-
vation and north on the east side, when it empties into Hood’s Canal.
There are several sloughs running from the river to the canal across the
reservation.

Geological environment, both stratigraphical and economic.—The strat-
igraphical environment has not been thoroughly studied. Both lava
and granite evidently lie at the bottom; the granite I think to be
the oldest. Since the granite, evidently there has been a long wash-
ing either by salt water or fresh, I do not know which, but presume it
was Salt, as the upland is mostly a gravel-bed. As the sea then went
down, the river formed most of the soil good for cultivation.

Economie condition.—The soil of about two-fifths of the reservation
is black rich bottom land, very excellent for cultivation when cleared
of the timber which covered it. One-fifth of the land is swampy, and
1,800. acres, nearly two-fifths, is gravelly and covered with fir timber
and is almost useless except as timber land.

Climate.—Chiefly a dry and wet season as in western Washington
and Oregon, but little snow and cold weather generally during the win-
ter, but a large amount of rain, which continues at intervals during the
summer. The spring is generally backward, as the Olympic Mountains,
some of which are snow-capped during the summer, are but 20 miles
distant to the north Frosts in the fall, generally not early, coming from
the Ist to the 25th of October usually.*

The following is a list of the mineral substances which are of prac-
tical value to them; they are, as far as I know, fourteen in number, be-
sides the soil for cultivation.

Iam indebted to Prof. T. Condon, of the Oregon State University,
for many of these named:

Agate is used for arrow-heads; basalt for the same and for hammers;
beach stones for anchors, hammers, sinkers in fishing, and for slinging
and tanning stones ; black mud of salt marshes for dyeing ; chalcedony
for arrow-heads; clay stones for pipes and rain stones; clay of a red
and a clay color for paints; jasper for arrow-heads; metamorphic stones
for axes and adzes; quartzite for hammers and whetstones; sedimen-

tary rock for hammers; slate for knives, and trap rock for hammers and
tanning stones.
PLANTS.

The following fifty varieties of native plants are of practical use, be-
sides cultivated plants and grasses for stock :

Alder.—The wood is used for fire-wood and for making dishes, plates,
ladies, bailers, and masks, and for the building of fish-traps and rough
houses. The bark is used for medicine, strings, ropes, and dyeing.

Barberry.—The bark is used for medicine.

Blackberry.—The berry is used for food, the juice for paint, the young
leaves for tea, and the roots for medicine.

Cat-tail rush.—The blades for making one kind of baskets and partly
in making several other kind; ; for mats, which are among their most
useful articles, and for strings and ropes. The head was formerly used
in making blankets.

Cedar.—This is the most useful vegetable production of their country,
its woods being used for planks for houses, burial inclosures, and the
like; for canoes, oars, baby-boards, buoys, spinning-wheels, boxes,
torches, arrow-shafts, rails, shingles, fish-traps, tamanous sticks, and
fire-wood. The limbs for baskets and ropes; the bark for baskets, mats,
sails, baby-head covers, springs, bailers, women’s skirts, and, when
beaten, beds for infants, wadding to guns, napkins, head bands, blank-
ets, and for gambling purposes; the gum and leaves for medicine.

Cherry.—The bark is used for strings and medicine.

Cottonwood.—The wood is usefal for fire-wood, the bark for medicine
and strings, and the buds for medicine.

Cranberry.—The berry is employed for food, the juice for paint, and the
young leaves for tea.

Crab apple.—The wood is used for wedges, hoes, and fire-wood; the
fruit for food, and the bark for medicine.

Currant.—The berry for food.

Dogwood.—The wood is manufactured into gambling disks and hollow
rattles, andis used for fuel.

Lilder.—The wood is made into arrow-heads, used as Pee gs; the
bark used for medicine, and the berry for food.

Pir (red).—The wood is valuable for fire-wood, boards, masts, spear-
handles, spits, and oars ; the bark is preferred to everything else for fire-
wood, asitis often 2.or 3 inches thick and pitchy. The pitch wood is
good for torches, fire-pots, and kindlings, and for the latter use it is sold
to the whites. The pitch is used for fastening on arrow-heads and spear-
heads, and as acement.

Gooseberry (two varieties).—The berry is used for food and the juice for
paint.

Grass, specific name unknown, is used extensively in making and or-
namenting baskets of several kinds.
618 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS

Hazel.—The nuts used for food, the wood for rims for snow-shoes, nets,
and the like, and the bark for strings.

Hemlock.—The wood serves for fire-wood and halibut hooks, the leaves
for tea, and the branches for covers in steaming food.

Huckleberry (black)—The berry is used for food and the juice for
paint.

Huckleberry (blue).—Same purpose.

Huckleberry (red).—Same purpose.

Ironwood.—The wood is used for arrow-shafts, arrow and spear heads,
and mat needles, and the bark for medicine.

Indian onion.—The bulb is eaten.

Kelp.—Strings and ropes are made from the root.

is easily carved ; the leaves are medicinal.

Licorice.—The root is used for medicine.

Maple.—The wood is utilized for hacklers, mat-blocks, paddle oars, _

bobbins, and blocks for making seines, combs, fish and duck spear-heads,
fish clubs, rails, and fire-wood. The leaves are used in steaming.

Maple (small variety).—The wood for fire-wood.

Rush (round).—For making mats.

Rush (small).—Roots for food.

Sallal berry.—The berry used for food, the juice for paint.

Salmon berry.—The berry and young shoots are eaten.

Skunk cabbage.-—The leaves used as medicine and the roots for food.

Spruce.—The wood is carved and the leaves employed medicinally.

Strawberry.—The berry is gathered for food.

Thimble cap.—The berry and young shoots are good for food.

Vine maple-—The wood is burned for fuel.

Willow.—The wood is occasionally used for fire-wood and the bark for
strings.

Yew.—Paddles, bows, and fish-clubs are made froin this wood.

BEASTS.

Fifteen kinds of animals are useful to them, as follows:

Bear (black).—The flesh is used for food, the skins for robes and quiv-
ers, and the teeth for ornaments.

Bear (grizzly).—The skin is dressed for robes, but it is a scarce animal ;
supposed to be used by medicine men for making people sick.

INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 619

Beaver.—The meat for food, the skins for furs, and the teeth employed
in games.

Cat (wild).—The flesh is eaten; the skins are made into robes.

Dog (common) is of use for domestic purposes, hunting, and the like.

Dog (wool).—The hair used in making blankets. The breed now ex-
tinct.

Deer.—This is probably the most useful wild animal known to them.
The flesh used for food, skins for robes, strings, fringes, moccasins,
clothes, and shot-pouches. The fawn-skins are sometimes made into
buoys, used in whaling. Formerly they made shirts, which answered
the purposes of shields or suits of armor, out of buckskin. Of the
sinews they make thread, and of the hoofs, rattles used in religious
dances. The brains employed in tanning.

Elk.—Tie flesh serves for food ; the skins for robes, shield-shirts, and
when dressed, for strings and clothes ; of the horns they make chisels,
wedges, and paint.

Musk-rat.—The skins are used for furs, and the teeth they gamble
with.

Otter.—The flesh is eaten.

Otter (sea).—The fur valuable.

Panther.—The skins are made into robes and clothes.

Raccoon.—The skin is used for furs, and the flesh for food ; the bones
for dishes and ladles.

Wolf.—The skin is used for robes, quivers, and caps.

The intestines of several of these are used for holding oil, and the
bones for various articles, such as awls, arrow and spear heads, combs,
fastenings, and the like.

BIRDS.

There are seventeen kinds of birds, which they utilize as follows:

Crane.—The flesh is used for food; the feathers for beds and pillows,
and also for orpamenting the hair at festivals.

Ducks.—Seven varieties of these, viz: The mallard, pin-tail, scoter (7),
wood-duck, teel, diver, and canvas-back, are used for food, and the
feathers for the same purposes as the crane feathers.

Eagle.—The feathers are used for feathering arrows andin tamanous
head-bands.

Grouse.—The flesh for food.

Goose.—The flesh for food.

Gull.—The flesh serves for food for old people occasionally, and the
feathers for beds.

Hawk.—The feathers are worn in tamanous head-bands.

King-fisher.—A piece of the skin, where the tail or wing feathers en
ter it, was used in fishing attached to the line near the hook, as it was
superstitiously supposed to attract fish.

Loon.—Two kinds, the light and dark, were used for food, and the
feathers were made into beds.
620 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

Woodpecher (red-headed).—The feathers are employed for feathering
arrows and in tamanous head-bands.
Pheasant.—The flesh 1s eaten.

FISH AND OTHER MARINE ANIMALS.

Five kinds of these are used as follows:

Abalone.—The shells for money and ornaments.

Clam.—Three kinds of clam are used for food, and the large shells as
drinking dishes.

Cod-fish.—The flesh and eggs of two kinds are used for food.

Crab.—Two varieties are used for food.

Dog-fish.— Oil obtained from it; occasionally the flesh is eaten; the
bones are used for ornaments, and a part of the skin as a substitute
for sand-paper.

Dentalia.—The shells for money and ornaments.

Flounder.—Two varieties are used for food.

Halibut, herring, and mussels —Al1so used as food.

Olivella.—'Lhe shells used for ornaments and sometimes money.

Oyster.—Food.

Porpoise.—¥ood and oil.

Salmon.—YVive varieties, viz: Silver, dog, red, black, and hump-
backed; both the eggs Sena flesh are used for food, and the eggs for
bait.

Seal (fur).—Is highly esteemed.

Seal (hair).— Buoys used in whaling, small sacks, pouches, etc., are
made from the skin; oil is made from the blubber, and the flesh is
eaten.

Shark.—From this oil is obtained.

Smelt and sea-eggs.—Used as food.

Scallop.—The shells are used for rattles in Gathancusine) and the flesh
for food.

Skate and trout.—Food.

Whale furnishes food and oil, bones for war clubs, sinew for thread,
and whale bone for a part of the cod-fish hook.

Cuttle-fish.—F ood.

SOCIAL CUSTOMS.

Travels.—These are confined chiefly to places where those reside
among whom they inter-marry. A few however of each tribe have
been on sailing vessels to California.

Commerce.—I have seen dishes made from the horn of the mountain
sheep or goat, which are said to have come from the Stikine Indians of
British Columbia, 600 or 800 miles to the north; baskets and pipes
from the Klikitats of eastern Washington, 150 miles to the east; bask-
ets from the Chehalis and Cowlitz Indians, 100 miles to the south; and
baskets from the Quinaielt Indians, on the Pacific coast, 50 miles to the

west. The articles from these distant tribes are, however, limited in
number, but there is considerable traffic among Indians who live inside
these limits. The distances spoken of above are in a direct line; the
way by which the articles come is much farther.

The traffic with the northern nations is by water, and therefore over
amore circuitous route than the traffic with other tribes, which is by
land.

CULTURE.

Means of subsistence.—Food formerly consisted solely of fish, roots,
berries, and game, the spontaneous products of land and water.

The fish and marine mammals formerly used are still eaten, and are
of at least nineteen kinds, namely, two varieties of cod-fish, two of floun-
ders, five of salmon, the silver, dog, red, black, and humpbacked, and
one each of dog-fish, smelt, skates, hair-seal, trout, whale, halibut, her-
ring, porpoise, and cuttle-fish. The dog-fish is used ouly occasionally
when other food is scarce. The salmon, halibut, herring, aud smelt are
dried as well as eaten fresh, the salmon being split open and the back-
bone being taken out. The halibut is cut into strips, and the herring
and smelt are dried whole. Salmon are now also sometimes salted.
Besides the flesh of the dog-fish, porpoise, seal, and whale, the oil was
formerly eaten. The eggs of the cod-fish and salmon are aluxury. The
porpoise, from its resemblance to pork, is called Indian pork.

Ten kinds of shell-fish are used for food, four of them being different
varieties of clams, two of crabs, and one each of oysters, mussels, sea
eggs, and scallops, the latter two being found only in the Klallam waters.
Clams alone are dried. In drying them the Indians first build a large
fire, in which they heat a number of stones, and when the fire has nearly
burned down, they remove the coals, pour on the clams, perhaps bushels
of them, and cover the whole with several thicknesses of mats. They
are thus steamed until they are cooked and opened, when they are
taken from the shell, spitted on slender sticks 2 or 3 feet long, and put
over fires in their houses to dry.

Fish eggs are dried by being placed on smal! wooden frames, a foot or
two square, and placed over the fire. Salmon was formerly their staff
of life, and their chief business in the summer was to dry it for winter.
There are some kinds of fish in their waters all the year round, though
some varieties they do not eat unless food is scarce.

Roots and branches.x—The kamass was formerly the most prized, but
as it does not grow in their land, having been imported from quite a
distance, they seldom use it now.

The root of the skunk cabbage, steamed, the Indian onion, a kind of
rusb root, that of an unknown plant, and of fern were also eaten. The
fern roots were dried, laid on a rock, beaten with a bone club into a
kind of flour, which was mixed with fish eggs and made into a cake
called by the Klallams skive-u,
622 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

The young shoots of the thimble-cap, salmon berry, and a plant, name
unknown, were and are still eaten; of all these the kamass and fern
cakes, as far as I know, were alone put up for future use; neither is now
much used.

Wild fruits.—The blackberry, three kinds of huckleberry (black, red,
and blue), sallal berry, cranberry, gooseberry, hazel-nut, salmon berry,
strawberry, raspberry, crab-apple, currant, elderberry, and a small red
berry from their tobacco plant, are all used for food. The blackberry,
two varieties of huckleberry, and sallal berry are dried for storage, the
first being often pounded up and made into cakes. Between the young
shoots, roots, and fruits they have some kind of vegetable food most of
the time.

Land mammats.—The beaver, black bear, deer, elk, otter, wild cat, rac-
coon, and mountain sheep were: used for food, all except the mountain
sheep and wild cat being still in use. When a bear is killed it is very
common to invite friends and have a feast. The flesh of the deer, elk,
and bear is dried.

The crane, grouse, goose, gull, light and dark loon, pheasant, and
seven varieties of ducks, viz, the mallard, pin-tail, scoter, wood, teal,
diver, and canvas-back, are eaten. The grouse and mallard duck were
not eaten until the whites came; the mallard because it fed on snails.
None of these were put up for future use, but now ducks are sometimes
salted down by the barrel.

Salt was never used until the whites came, and even now they do not
salt much of their food. There is no place in this region where salt can
be obtained, except in the sea. They did not even have in their lan-
guage a word for salt, though they had terms designating its quality
and also one for salt water. I have occasionally seen them drink salt
water with relish, and they may have thus satisfied the demands of
nature.

Cooking.—Birds and oysters are now generally boiled. Young sprouts
are eatenraw. Muscles are roasted in the fire. Fish, when eaten fresh,
are boiled or roasted on spits before the fire. Other animal food is
roasted on the spit, boiled, or steamed. Berries are eaten raw, stewed,
andin pies. In steaming food in large quantities they follow much the
same rules as when cooking and opening clams, but dry branches
of trees are used in connection with the mats. Formerly in boiling
they heated stones and placed them in water in their water-tight
baskets. '

Storing.—Cultivated roots when stored are commonly “cached” in
the ground and covered with boards and earth, regular cellars being
uncommon.

Drinks.—Tea and coffee are now very common, but when not able to
obtain these they have occasionally made a tea from the leaves of the
cranberry, blackberry,and hemlock. They use but little milk, for while
they have some cows they think dairying teo much trouble,

MEDICINES.

I have been unable to obtain a complete list, but give the following
remedies, some of which were given in my article on the Twanas:

‘Alder buds.—Used for colds and biliousness. They eat them and
afterwards drink salt water as an emetic.

Alder bark.—This they grind in water and drink the infusion as a
tonie.

Barberry bark is prepared in the same way as the last, and used to
purity the blood.

Blackberry root is used for colds.

- Cedar gum chewed for toothache.

Cedar leaves are chewed and bound on cuts.

-Cherry bark prepared as alder bark for a physic and tonic.

Cottonwood bark, from the body of the tree, after having been soaked
in salt water, is ground and used as a medicine.

Cottonwood buds are also used as a medicine.

Crab-apple bark.—A cold tea is made from this as a wash for the eyes.

Elder bark.—An infusion taken internally and in a vapor bath is used
for diarrhea.

Licorice.—Used for colds.

Oregon grape.—The root and bark are used in the same way as alder
bark for skin diseases.

Rose bark and roots, used as medicine.

Potatoes, scraped, for burns and sealds.

Skunk cabbage leaves.—They heat rocks, throw water over them, place
leaves on them, and get over the steam for strengthening general de-
bility.

EHarthis sometimes bound on bruises.

Cautery.—Rheumatism is sometimes treated by taking a red-hot iron,
stick or small bunch of cedar bark, and burning the flesh to the bone.

Blood-letting is done by searifying the body in various places.

HABITATIONS.

Dwellings.—Their houses are of nine kinds. The potlatch houses are
the only public houses which they have. They are not constructed on
a uniform plan. In the account of potlatches will be found a descrip-
tion of a house on the Skokomish Reservation and another at Dungi-
ness. One built by the Twana Indians, ten years ago, was somewhat
similar, to the one on the reservation, but was larger, being about 50
feet wide and 300 feet long. One at Port Angeles was also somewhat
‘similar, and these were used very little as dwellings after the potlatch.
Those at Sequin and Port Gamble are more nearly like the one at
Dunginess, and have since been used as dwellings.

Sweat houses are very uncommon; the only ones which I have seen
have been used by the medicine men, They are 3 or 4 feet in height
624 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

and a little morein diameter, being conoidal. Sticksare driven into the
ground near together, bent over, covered with large leaves, as those of
the maple tree, and then covered with dirt. They are only intended for
one person at a time. ;

Large dwelling houses.—These are usually 25 or 30 feet wide by 40
or 50 long, though occasionally they are made 80 or 100 feet long.
They are each owned by one man, but intended for several families,
usually his friends and relations, who pay no rent. There is no floor.
The doors are either at each end or in the middle of one side, and in-
side the house there are small walls on each side of the entrance, similar
to that in the potlatch house, to guard against the wind. Each corner
is intended for one family, but sometimes more oceupy it. On the in-
side, all around the building, there is a bed platform about 34 feet wide
and 2 feet high. <A part of this is used for storing their effects. Under-
neath it, also, many things are kept. Below and in front of it is a low
seat about 6 inches high and 3 feet wide, which is also sometimes used
as a place for sleeping. The fire is on the ground in front of this and
the smoke escapes by holes in the roof immediately over the fire and
about 7 feet above the ground. Sticks are placed in various posi-
tions where food, especially fish and clams, are hung to dry. This
class of houses is now used very little by the Twanas,

Flat-roofed dwelling-houses.—The sides of such houses are made both
of upright and horizontal boards, and the roof is composed of two parts,
that made of split cedar boards or clap-boards, which generally have a
steep pitch, and another part made of long boards. Such a house is in-
tended for only one or two families, and the inside arrangement is very
similar to that of the large dwelling-house.

House with roof wholly on one side.—In this the roof is similar to that
of the last. This is said to have been anciently the almost universal
mode of building all permanent houses, and the boards for the roof were
hollowed out. This form of house is now seldom used.

The Government houses.—These were built on the reservation for the
Twanas by the Government carpenter, the Indians having been in-
duced to use a part of their annuity money to purchase the lumber, and

are now the dwellings most in use. A number of the Klallam Indians .

have also built similar structures for themselves. These houses are
mostly 16 by 22 feet, with a shed kitchen 8 or 9 feet wide added on
one side. Inside they are generally divided into a bed-room, sitting-
room, and kitchen. Some of the rooms are papered and are furnished
with beds, tables, chairs, benches, a cupboard, and a stove or two, and
a few either have mats, a few rugs, or pieces of carpet on the floors.
They have also clocks, dishes, looking-glasses, ete., and in one there is
a bureau.

The mat house.—These are made of mats, and of late some boards are
also used in their construction. They are intended as temporary houses
and are generally put up at fishing places during the summer, Inside,

— ee
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 625

the beds are laid around the side on boards a few inches from the ground.
The fire is in the middle; most of the space overhead is occupied with
fish which are being dried. People and things are stowed where any
room can be found, and the whole atmosphere is filled with smoke.

The half-circle camp.—When traveling in stormy weather they often
place poles in the ground in the form of a semicircle to the windward
and fasten mats to them, the whole standing so as to answer both as
wall and roof. Under this shelter they sleep. The fire is to the lee-
ward, which is open.

Tents of cotton cloth are now often used in travelling, and sails are
also spread Over poles so as to form a kind of low tent.

Outbuildings.—These consist of barns, stables for horses, stables for
oxen when they are logging, cellars and caches for roots (chiefly pota-
toes), woodsheds, which are also rather scarce. They often take their
canoes into their large houses. These outhouses are all built after the
style of those of the whites, though not usually as substantial. None
of them were in use, as far as I know, before the coming of the whites.
Their houses were originally near the beach in small villages, but
arranged withno order. Those at Jamestown are now on one straight
street and those on the reservation on their farms.

APPURTENANCES TO DWELLINGS.

Doors.—These are opened or closed by sliding boards over the aper-
ture. At present all doors are made after the civilized style. Some-
times only mats are hung over the entrance.

Fire-places.—These are of five kinds, two of which are ancient and
three modern. (1) Anciently the Klallams, at least, dug a place about
a foot deep and 5 or 6 feet in diameter in some of their houses, heap-
ing up the dirt around the edge. There are none of these now in use.
(2) They build their fires on the ground without any preparation but
a smoke-hole. This is usually about 3 feet square and often has a
cover which may be used when a severe rain occurs or the occupants
are absent. In the Government houses a hole is sometimes cut in the
floor about 3 feet square; the space from the ground to the floor filled
with earth, and perhaps the edges of the boards around the fire lined
with tin. In the flat-roofed houses a board or two is removed at one
end, or for the whole length, in order that the smoke may escape. A
board chimney is sometimes used, which is the connecting link between
the fire on the ground and our chimney. The hearth is of earth, the
sides simply of boards nailed up. Its peculiarities are its size and ma-
terial. It is built large for two reasons: First, that the boards may not
take fire, and as an additional preventive sometimes an old piece of iron
is placed against the sides of the chimney. Second, that the occupants,
especially when sick, may lie inside the chimney near to the fire.

A common-sized chimney of sticks and dirt is sometimes built similar

H. Mis. 600-——40
626 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

to those of the whites in the new-.settlement. Another form from the
logging camps of the whites is a truncated pyramid placed so that the
base, which is about 5 feet square. hangs some 5 feet above the fire and
the smaller end passes through the roof. The draught through this is
sufficient. Such a chimney is placed near the center of the room, so
that occupants can gather aronnd the fire.

Material for building in all permanent buildings is of wood, and of late
years sawed boards are usually obtained. Barns are often sided with
split cedar boards from 3 to 5 feet long, called roof-boards, clap-boards,
orshakes. Formerly their large planks were split from cedar trees, and,
as cedar decays slowly, this is still in use in many plaves. The largest I
have seen were among the Klallams at Elkwa, and they were 24 feet

wide and 40 long, and 35 wide and 20 long. ‘These were split, and

afterwards trimmed by hewing.
FURNITURE AND UTENSILS.

Mats.—These are of seven kinds. Three kinds are made of ecat-tail
rush. The plants are cut by the women in July and August, dried in
the sun, and tied in bunches as large as can be comfortably carried.
When a woman finds that she has time to make mats she assorts her
rushes according to size into three lots. Of the largest rushes she makes
the largest mats, about 5 feet wide; of rushes of medium length she
forms mats about 3 feet wide, and of the smaller stalks she weaves
mats about 2 feet wide. All these may be of any desired length.
The largest mats are used chiefly for lining wooden houses and in con-
structing mat houses. Those of medium size are used at times for the
same purpose, for the half-circle camps, for beds, pillows, seats, table
covers, and as substitutes for umbrellas and oil-cloth, two layers form-
ing an almost complete protection from the rain. The narrowest mats,
usually from 3 to 4 feet long, are used mostly for cushions, as in canoes,
and for the paddlers to kneel on. These cat-tail mats are thus made:
The ends of the rushes are first fastened together in the shape of the
mat, then strings made of the same material, shredded and twisted, are
passed transversely through these rushes, and about 23 inches apart.
This is done with a needle of hard wood 3 feet long, Lalf an inch wide,
three-cornered, and with an eye in one end, in which the string is placed.
After the string is passed through, a small piece of wood with a crease
in it, is pressed over the mat where the strings are, to render it firm and
of good shape. The edges of the mats are fastened by weaving the ends
of the transverse threads firmly together.

Another mat is made and used in a manner similar to the medium.
sized cat-tail mat, but it is made from a round rush which usually
grows to a height only sufficient to make mats about 3 feet wide.

A rough mat is made from the inner bark of the cedar, split into strips
half an inch wide or thereabouts and woven together at right angles.
It is used chiefly to lay fish upon when, they are cleaned,

———EE—————— ee
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 627

A mat is also made from the inner bark of the cedar, which is split
into strips a quarter or a third of an inch wide and woven in a manner
similar to the last, but much more firmly and with more carefully fin-
ished edges. Sometimes a portion of the strips are colored black and
woven in at regular distances, or else a border is made of the black strips.
These mats are usually about 4 feet by 7 or 8, and were formerly used
for sails, but are now used for house lining, matting, and to place food
on at feasts.

Smail table mats are also manufactured, much more as an article of
commerce for the whites than for their own use.

Baskets.—These are of eleven kinds. They are woven and sewed,
and are made of grass. They usually hold from a pint toa half bushel
and are used for the following purposes:

(1) Carrying water and juicy berries, and formerly for cooking by
placing heated stones in them.

(2) A stiff basket, but not water-tight, about the same size as the last,
is made from nearly the same material, but not sewed. These are for
more delicate use.

(3) Baskets made of cedar limbs split, the bark usually taken off,
are woven. They hold commonly from a half bushel to a bushel. Those
whose capacity is only a half bushel are ordinarily used for rough work,
such as carrying fish, potatoes, clams, muscles, and roots. The upper
loops are made also of cedar twigs twisted, and in these the carrying
strap is fastened.

(4) The fancy basket is made of small grass and usually ornamented
by figures. It holds from 2 quarts to3 pecks, and is generally used by
the women for storing clothes and fancy articles of the house.

(5) A basket made of a bush split and shaved on both sides. The
pieces are a third or half an inch wide, and are woven together at right
angles. It is used more by the whites than the Indians as a clothes
basket, and seems a copy of some American baskets.

(6) Baskets made of the cat-tail woven, and usually holding about a
bushel each. They are not durable and not much used, and chiefly for
storing their effects.

(7) A large carrying basket somewhat angular and used in much the
same way. :

(8) Small baskets, usually holding not over 2 quarts; they are made of
small grass, obtained by the Makahs, and used by women for holding
sewing materials and similar small articles.

(9) Baskets made of the inner bark of the cedar, split into strips a
half or third of an inch wide and woven. They are of various sizes,
holding from 2 quarts to a bushel or more; used for storing purposes.

(10) Baskets made of some kind of grass, holding about a bushel,
and really more of a sack than a basket; used as the last.

(11) Another similar to the last, but made of another kind of grass;
also used for storing purposes.
628 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

Of these Nos. 1, 2, and 3 are common to these tribes, both in manu-
facture and use. Nos. 2, 4, and 6 I have only seen among the Twanas,
No. 10 is made by the Quinaielt Indians, and is imported by the Twanas.
No. 11 is made by the Klikitat Indians, and is also imported by the
Twanas. I have never seen the Klikitat baskets among the Klallams
or Chemakums.

Boxes.—I have only seen two kinds of boxes which are peculiar to
these Indians. The water-box, which is made perfectly tight with the
exception of a hole in the upper part, where the water is poured in, and
the one from which it is poured out or drunk. The size of this is usually
about 8 inches square and of the same length. This and the water-
tight baskets are the only native water vessels, as far as I know. The
box has the advantage of keeping out the dust. The second kind is
used to keep shell money and small valuables. This consists of two
parts—the box proper and the cover, which fits over it to the bottom.
Such boxes were formerly made large enough to contain blankets. The
construction of both of these boxes is similar and somewhat peculiar.
The sides and ends are made of one board; where the corner is to bea
small miter is cut, both on the inside and outside, partly through. Then
the corners are steamed and bent at right angles, and the inside miter
is cut so perfectly that it fits water-tight when the corners are bent. The
corner where the two ends of the board meet are then fastened with
wooden pegs driven in diagonally. The top and bottom of the box are
fastened with pegs similarly inserted. (See Kell on the Twana Indians,
p- 69.)

Dishes are used mainly for holding fish and seal oil. They are made
of wood, alder being preferred. One made by the Indians of British
Columbia, and which found its way among the Twanas, is made of the
horn of the mountain sheep. There is no paint on it, but all the figures
are made by carving, the darker shade representing the deeper cut.
Some of these dishes were evidently made for holding food as well as
oil. The intestines of seals, deer, and some other large animals are
also sometimes used for holding oil. At present the Klallams chiefly
use them.

The water-tight baskets already described were formerly used for
stone boiling. Two kinds of spits are now in use for roasting. One is
a simple straight stick, nearly round, half an inch or less in diameter,
from | to 24 feet long, and sharpened at both ends. By using several
of these, some set at right angles to the others, a salmon is stretched
out so as to be either dried or roasted. On a single one clams are im-
paled and dried, and smelt or other small fish are roasted. The other
is a stick about three-fourths of an inch wide, 14 inches thick, and 3 or
34 feet long, which is split for about 2 feet and then tied with grass to
prevent its splitting further. The three ends are sharpened. On the
two smaller ones the fish is fastened, and the other is stuck into the
ground before the fire.
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 629

For serving and eating food, the following utensils are commonly em-
ployed:

Mats.—Some of these are often placed on the ground during feasts
aad the food placed on them, the guests seated on the ground on each
side.

Baskets.—Berries are often served in the water-tight baskets.

Plates and troughs.—These are made of wood and are quite shallow.
Alder wood is preferred. They are generally from 9 to 12 inches wide,
and from 16 inches to 6 feet long and 10 inches wide. Of late years,
since lumber has become common, troughs 6 inches wide and from 8 to
12 feet long are made of boards. They are for use during the large
feasts, food being placed uponthem. Rice, boiled fish, and semi-liquid
food are now generally served from American kettles, plates, and pails.

Trays.—Oceasionally trays are made. I have seen one 40 inches
long, 25 wide, and 7 deep, and others smailer.

Ladles.—These are made both of wood (maple) and horn. Theseladles
are used for semi-liquid food; but are not always placed in the mouth,
but near the mouth, and the food is pushed from them into the mouth
with a small stick, or taken from them with a smaller ladle, which is
placed in the mouth.

Stone dish.—The only stone dish I have seen was obtained from the
Klallam Indians of Port Angeles. It is said to have been used for
holding oil while eating it. It is a quarter of a sphere and quite reg-
ular. Another one was found while plowing at Port Angeles. It is a
half-sphere, made of clay stone, and the Indians are not certain that it
was ever used as a dish, as many similar ones are found at Klallam Bay.
Its upper edge seems to have been trimmed for use.

Pipes.—The only two stone pipes which I have seen, appear to have
been made from a soft grayish stone, perhaps clay stone.

I can not learn that pipes or narcotics were used by these Indians
previous to the coming of the whites. When tobacco is scarce they
often mix with it the leaves of a small bush which has a red berry,
called ska-wail-dai by the Twanas; ské-wad, by the Skwaksins, and
stain-swot-man-ish, by the Klallams. Tobacco is used by the majority of
this people, but they are not as much addicted to it as some other In-
dians. I have seldom seer them chew it. The Twanas rarely smoke it
except at some gatherings. The Klallams use it much more freely than
the Twanas. I have never known of their smoking the pipe of peace.

Napkins are seldom used except at great feasts. One form is made
of cedar bark, slightly beaten, about 2 feet long and tied into bunches
an inch in diameter. I have seen also a piece of calico stretched by
two individuals from end to end along a row of feasters, near their
mouths, on which they wipe their hands and mouths when done eating,

Miscellaneous.—Fir pitch wood is generally used for torches, and when
this is wanting, cedar is split somewhat fine and a handful of it lighted,
but the lights of the whites have nearly taken the place of these rude
lights, except for fishing and duck bunting night.

CLOTHING.

 Hats.—A hat made by the Makahs, but which finds its way among

the Twanasand Klallams, is water-tight and seems to be made in a man-
ner somewhat sivvilar to that of the water-tight baskets. Other hats
somewhat like these, but with flat tops, are made by Indians of Brit-
ish Columbia and imported. None are made by the Twanas, Klallams,
or Chemakums. They commonly go bareheaded.

Body clothing.—Pantaloons, shirts, and coats were formerly made of
buckskin by these Indians, but are notnow. The only buckskin clothes
I have seen were imported from the Chehalis and Takania Indians.
Short skirts for the women were made of cedar bark finely split and
bound together at the upper edge where they were fastened around the
waist.

Blankets.—Three kinds of blankets were formerly in use. One was
made of dogs’ hair, geese feathers, and the head of the cat-tail rush,
twisted and woven together on aloom. A kind of dog, rather small, was
kept specially for its hair, which was very long, and a woman’s wealth
was esteemed by the number of such dogs owned.

Another blanket was made by them from the inner bark of the cedar,
slightly beaten and woven, the strings made of geese feathers. Skins
were often used, especially those of the bear, deer, and wild cat, sev-
eral of the latter being sewed together. Hardly any of these articles
of native clothing are now worn, the civilized style being adopted.

Mat coats.—One kind of coat made of mats was short in front, ex-
tending only about as far as the elbows, but long behind, with a hole
for the neck, it being put on over the head.

Arm clothing.—I have not been able to learn of any special covering
for the arms, as some part of the body clothing already described would
naturally extend over the arms.

Leg and foot clothing.—Moceasins were occasionally used, but the eli-
mate is too wet to admit of their being worn with comfort. They gen-
erally went barefooted, and the old ones still adhere to this custom.

Parts of dress.—A few women have of late learned to make lace from
thread.

There is a native-made iron fastening for shawls and blankets. Such
fastenings are also made in a little different shape and of brass and
wood. Formerly they were made of bone. Fringes are appended to
the leather coats, shirts, and pantaloons already mentioned. This is
made of leather an inch or two long.

Receptacles for dress.—Baskets, described in the previous section, are
all used for receiving clothing, except the eighth one mentioned, which
is for thread and nicknacks.

PERSONAL ADORNMENT.

Tattooing.—In tattooing they use a needle and thread, blackening the
thread with charcoal and drawing it under the skin as deeply as they
can bear it.
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 631

Head ornaments.—Wead-bands made of dentalium shell. Threads are
run through the shells, then through the leathers which keep the shells
in their places.

Ear pendants.—There are two kinds, one of dentalium shells, a num-
ber of which are fastened together in a bune». Small pieces of black
or red cloth are often fastened to the lower part of the shell for greater
ornament. Another is made of abelone shells. Both of these were
formerly used as money.

Neck ornaments.—Necklaces were formerly made by stringing both the
dentales and olivella shells, but such are little used now. Sometimes
these strings were 5 feet long, and were doubled several times. Beads
of various colors, Shapes, and sizes, some being very large, have now
taken the place of shells. Blue ones are the most common, being pre-
ferred when the whites first came; but of late their taste is changing,.
and other colors are being used. Dog-fish bones and bears’ claws were
also strung for necklaces, the latter being used as charms.

Ornaments for the limbs.—Bracelets are made of washed iron and brass
of native make, and of silver and other material made by the whites.
Ido not know that any were used previous to the coming of the whites.

Toilet articles.—Single wooden combs are common. I have seen only
one double one; this was found on a grave at Elkwa, and the handle

yas partly gone, the whole being decayed. One was found near Port
Augeles of horn.

WORKING IMPLEMENTS.

Knives.—A knife in very common use and of native make has the
blade of steel and the handle bone. It is especially convenient in fin-
ishing canoes or anything hollow.

Another hunting-knife of native make has a double-edged steel blade;
and the handle is of two pieces of bone rivetted around the steel, which
extends beyond the handle.

Axes and adzes.— At present they use the American adzes and axes,
with one exception. Stone axes belong tu the archeology of the coun-
try. One of this class I have seen, which was obtained in a shell-bed
at Dunginess among the Klallams. It was of metaphoric rock, three-
fourths of a pound in weight, nine-sixteenths of an inch in thickness,
and the edge is ground twice as much on the flat side as on the other.
Another specimen found near the same place was of the same thickness;
weight one-half pound, and the edge ground a little more on the flat
side than on the other.

Some Indians say that these axes were used as hatchets or axes for
ordinary chopping and there are trees near Dewater and Doswailopsh,
on Hood’s Canal in the Twana country, that have been partially or
wholly cut by such axes. Others say they were used as hand adzes with
which to finish canoes after they had been hollowed by burning. Such
adzes are now in common use, only they are invariably made of old
632 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

rasps and hafted with wood fastened together by a thong. All but
one appear to be flattened at least on one side and some on both sides,
and evidently intended to be hafted in that way. They are all well
polished.

Wedges.—Large wedges were and are still made of wood. At present
those of iron regularly made for the purpose, or old iron ax-heads, are
very commonly used.

Chisels. —Those of American manufacture are now wholly used. I
have seen only two of native make. Hammers of American make are
also chiefly used, though occasionally stone tools are employed.

Implements of special use.-—The number of stone axes, hammers, ete.,
which still remain among them show that some tools were used in
their construction, but I have seen no such tools and heard of none, ex-
cept that some say one stone was used to break, grind, and polish
another. Their bone knives must have been used for making bows and
arrows. There was but little need of implements for straightening ar-
rows, aS both cedar and iron-wood are naturally straight enough. For
fastening the feathers and heads to the shafts a string of some thin
bark like the hazel bark is used, and in securing the heads the string
is covered with pitch of the red fir. Their fish-spear heads are fastened
in the same way. The ends of the bows are bent by being wrapped in
sea-weed or moss and buried in the warm ground very near the fire,
where they steam, after which they are easily bent. Nettlestrings and
entrails of deer and the like, properly prepared, were used for bow-strings
previous to the coming of the whites.

WEAPONS.

Striking arms.—Clubs were used for striking, especially when the
Indians creep up by night in some stealthy way and surprise their
enemies. One found near Dunginess had a whale-bone handle. The
carvings are intended to represent the head of the thunder-bird, an
emblem of power. Wooden clubs were also used.

Slings and shots or stones are used only by boys as playthings, and
formerly by young men in killing ducks.

Fire-pots, filled with pitch wood, were formerly used to set houses
on fire into which the enemy had fled. <A part of the besieging force
would attack one side of the house in order to draw the attention of the
besieged away from the opposite side, when the party with these fire-pots
would approach, set fire to the pitch wood, throw it on the roof, and as
the besieged attempted to escape they were killed with spears, clubs,
knives, or were shot.

Thrusting arms.—Spears for hunting ducks have usually a handle 15
or 20 feet long, and the prongs so far apart as not to injure the body
of the bird. The teeth of the prongs are on the outside so as simply to
catch in the feathers. These were formerly made both of bone and
hard wood, but iron has been substituted for bone. A school-boy wrote
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 633

me that ducks are caught with these spears at night by the light of a
fire kindled in the back of the boat, which is generally occupied by two
men, one to use the spear and the other to paddle. Geese and fish are
also caught in the same way. Sometimes in foggy weather these In-
dians cover their canoes over with green boughs, among whiclr they
hide, then they paddle quietly among the ducks and shoot them.

Bows and arrows were formerly their only weapons of the projectile
class, but they have been almost entirely superseded by guns. The
shaft of the arrow is either cedar or iron-wood; of late many of the
heads are made of wire of about three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter
and 5 or6inches long. Chalcedony and basaltic rock were also used in
their manufacture, but stone arrow-heads are very scarce. The Indians
have a tradition that they were made by the wolf or panther while those
beasts were men, before being metamorphosed by Dokibatt. They
also say that when broken into small pieces and shot at men or animals
they are sure to cause death. This tradition, taken in connection with
those of Dokibatt, is about all that seems to point to the existence of
a race inhabiting this country previous to these Indians.

Armor.—The only bodily protection against the missiles of enemies
of which I bave heard is a kind of shirt made of dried buckskin cover-
ing the body.

FISHING IMPLEMENTS.

Spears and hooks.—Living as they,do on Puget Sound, a great por-
tion of their food has always been obtained from its water. The Klal-
lams practice nearly all the methods which the Twanas have for catehing
fish, and also have some additional devices, as there are halibut, seal,
and whale living in the waters of the lower sound which are not found
in Hood’s Canal. They have now adopted most of the methods prac-
ticed by the whites, especially the use of the hook and line. They buy
hooks of European make, and also forge them from iron or steel.
They have fish-spears made with three prongs, and sometimes with
only two. The handles of such spears are usually of fir, it being both
strong and straight, and the prongs are of some hard wood, as maple
or iron. They are used for spearing flounders, crabs, salmon, and the
like, and bringing up fish eggs. When doing so one person paddles
while another uses the spear, and, because of long practice, they will
see a fish partly buried in the mud, and having seen one, they hardly
ever miss spearing it. There is a book made of iron, but which is fast-
ened to a pole 15 or 20 feet long by a thong or two. The end of the
pole fits into a piece of wood which is fastened around the hook. By
means of the pole the hook is moved around in the water and hooked
into a fish, but when the fish is caught the pole is pulled out and the
strain is on the thongs. The double herring spear or rake is made of
wood, 15 or 20 feet long, with nails fastened into the lower end, usually
only on one side, making a single herring spear, but occasionally on
both sides. The nails are all sharpened. Another form of spear-head
634 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

or native hook is worked in much the same way as the last. It con-
sists of two spear-heads, the sharp point of each being of iron (formerly
bone was used). This is fastened to two bones or pieces of hard wood
by strings covered with pitch, and the whole is then fastened by strings
or thongs to poles which also fit into the hooks.

There are several fishing implements used only by the Klallams, since
the prey they are designed to capture, viz, halibut, whale, and seal,
valuable for its furs, are not found in the Twana waters. One is a hali-
but hook made of apiece of bone and fastened by strings of cedar bark
to a piece of hemlock wood bent by steaming to the required shape.

There is also a cod-fish hook. The head is of bone fastened with
bark to a piece of whalebone. The bait, which is often a small fish, is
slipped over the end; hence the necessity of a loop by which it is fast-
ened to the line. The lines used with this hook are often of fine root-
lets of the kelp, which when dry are brittle, but when wet are very
strong.

These lines are used for various kinds of fishing by the Klallams,
but are not used by the Twanas, as the kelp does not grow in their
waters. Another, used for seal and whales, has a steel head which
fits over a wooden handle to which it is fastened by thongs. The
lower Klallams alone know the process of catching seal, and they
have to go to the Makah waters for this purpose.

Traps and nets.—A way of taking salmon in rivers is to build a
trap across the river. A number of small sticks three-fourths of an
inch in diameter and 63 feet long are fastened together 2 inches apart.
Long sticks are placed across the stream and secured by braces. The
small sticks or weir are placed so as to lean against these larger ones,
the upper end slanting down-stream and tied to the poles; while for
additional security the gravel of the bed of the river is shoveled on
around the bottom of them. The weir prevents the fish from ascending
the stream. Nets are then provided, about 6 feet broad and 2 feet deep,
made of strings and secured to arim of wood. Native strings of this
sort are made of nettle or alder bark twisted, but American twine is
now often used. During the day-time these nets are pulled up, but let
down at night, when the fish are running, one man watching each net.
The fish striving to ascend get into these nets, and their presence is im-
mediately known by the moving of the string. The net is then pulled
up, the fish killed with a club and laid on a platform. These clubs are
often common sticks, but are sometimes fancifully carved. There are
usually fonr nets let down at once to form the trap. Another trap is
made in a similar way as regards the weir, but otherwise differing
across the stream. Up-stream from the weir several pens are built, in
which doors are made V-shaped, opening from below. The fish easily
enter this, but, unable to find the way out, are speared.

Salmon in the salt water are also taken with seines, either bought or
made by the Indians. In making them they wind the twine on a frame

Se -  eC
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 635

or bobbin of wood, which is open at the ends so as to receive the twine.
The kuots are tied over a block so as to secure interstices of uniform
size. Another form of net, for gathering sea eggs and small fish, has a
handle about 10 feet long and the rim of hoop-iron.

A sinker of stone is not manufactured, but a water-worn stone of the
right kind is found on the beach and bark is fastened around it, to
which the line is attached.

INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES.

Leather-working.—The deer or elk hide is soaked for two days and
the hair removed by scraping it with a rough iron. It is then soaked
a half day with the deer brains in hot water over the fire, the brains
being rubbed over something like soap. It is then stretched and rubbed
with rocks until it becomes soft and pliable, when they dig a hole in
the ground, build a fire of rotten wood or cedar bark, stretch the skin
over it and cover it with blankets, thus smoking it, after which it is fit
for use. The stick on which the skin is placed to remove the hair is 4
inches in diameter, but on the under side about Linch is taken off. An
irregular broken stone, fastened to a wooden handle, is used for rubbing
the skin to render it pliable. The handle is about 34 feet long. Some-
times, though. the stone is used without being fastened to a handle,
being simply held in the hand. This one is about an inch thick.

Sticks of various kinds, and sometimes irons about 2 feet long, are used
for digging roots, clams, ete. .

Basket-working.—A bone implement is used for pressing the parts
closely together in weaving baskets. Such tools are also made of hard
wood. Thisand an awl for sewing the water-tight baskets are the only
tools I have seen used in this work.

Implements for working fiber.—There is a wooden hand-spindle used
now for making woolen yarn, but formerly for making yarn of other
materials to be woven into blankets. This implement consists of a slen-
der stick fixed in the center of a circular disk or wheel about one-fourth
ofan inch thick. The material to be spun is fastened to one end of the
stick, the opposite end is taken in one hand and rolled over and over in
the lap, while the other hand holds the yarn, which made in this way
is very uneven. Occasionally very inferior yarn is made in this way by
twisting the material with the hand on the lap. American cards are
now used, and spinning-wheels have been introduced to some extent.

A loom secured to the ground by its pointed feet was formerly used
in weaving blankets, but it is now occasionally used in weaving rugs.

Painting.—Before the introduction of American paints, black paint
was made from coal, which is still used as a cheap paint, especially
when painting the face; one kind of red paint was made from a red clay
obtained by the Twanas about 6 miles below the reservation on the east
side of the canal. There is a tradition about that clay as follows:
“Long ago, before Dokibatt came, this bank was the Klikitat Indians
636 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

and the opposite side of the canal was the Twanas. There was a gam-
bling contest between the two tribes, and the Klikitats won the game.
When Dokibatt came he changed them all to land. For this reason
the Twanas use the red paint as a charm in dancing, gambling, and
tamanous; for this reason also the Twanas are still beaten in such
contests with other tribes; 7. e¢., once overcome, always overcome.” An-
other red paint was made from the gnarls of a certain kind of tree found
in the mountains; the wood passed through some kind of process under
the ground.

The juice of berries is also sometimes used for painting faces.

A white or yellowish paint is said to have been made by burning
elk horn, powdering it, and mixing it with oil. A clay-colored paint
was made from a kind of earth in the Twana land. The Klallams ob-
tain their red paint from a red clay in the Makah land; it is burned
and mixed with dog-fish oil.

Dyes.—Cedar bark and grass is dyed black for ornamenting baskets
by being buried in the black mud of the salt marsh for two days. To
color the same yellow they are boiled with the bark of the root of the
Oregon grape for a short time. To color them a deep red they are
soaked with alder bark. Baskets are imported from the Makahs in
which the grass is dyed purple, crimson, blue, and two shades of slate.

Sand-paper.—The skin of the dog-fish is used for this, and it is very
serviceable.

Ropes and strings.—The largest ropes I have seen made by these In-
dians are of cedar twigs twisted in much the same style as our own
hemp ropes, but they look coarser. These are very strong and lasting.
The largest are made on the buoys employed in catching seal, and are
three fourths of an inch in diameter. Some one-half inch in diameter
are used for fastening canoes, and those three-sixteenths of an inch are
utilized in fastening cross-pieces to canoes. Of braided cat-tail they
make a flat rope, not very durable, about three-eighths of an inch thick
by three-fourths of an inch broad, which is used for tying paddles into
bundles, and of the beaten fiber of the same material twisted they
make strings from an eighth to three-sixteenths of an inch thick, which
are used in sewing mats together. They are not very strong, but for
this purpose are good enough.

The ropes at the ends of the head-bands used in carrying baskets are
made of the bark of the alder braided. They are about three-eighths
of an inch thick and five-eighths broad. Of the inner bark of the alder
split and twisted a kind of string is made which is manufactured into
fishing nets. Another string one-sixteenth to one-eighth inch in di-
ameter, also used in making nets, is made by hackling and twisting the
outer fiber of the nettle. This is strong and looks much like linen twine.
The Klallams make, without special preparation, lines out of the smaller
part of the help root of about one-eighth inch diameter. When dry it
is brittle, but when soaked a short time in water it becomes quite
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 637

strong. Flat grass and strips of bark from an eighth to a half inch
wide are also used in various ways, especially in making arrows and
fishing implements.

Ropes used as hitching ropes, bridles, ete., for horses are made by
braiding the long hairs from the horses’ manes and tails. They are
made about a half inch in diameter and are very strong and durable.
Elk, deer, and other skins, both dried and tanned, are cut into thongs
which are used for various purposes. Fibrous tissue from the deer,
the elk, and the whale is used in sewing.

Other processes.—Obtaining oil from the liver of the dog-fish by boil-
ing has become quite a business, as the oil is in demand by the loggers.
Gathering oysters and clams, halibut and salmon for American canne-
ries occupies anumber. The Twanas are engaged in farming more than
the Klallams and more in logging, but the latter work more in saw-
mills than the former.

LOCOMOTION AND TRANSPORTATION.

Travelling by water.—This is the chief mode of travel by these Indians,
as their land is all situated on the shores of the sound, with its bays
and inlets. The Klallams are more confined to it than the Twanas,
owing to the mountainous character of their country, which makes it
impracticable to visit by way of land any other Indians, while the
Twanas are obliged to travel at least 10 miles southeast by land in
order to reach the waters on which the Skwaksins live, and 30 or more
to the south to reach the Chehalis Indians, with both of which tribes
they have considerable intercourse. Trips to these tribes, and ocea-
sionally to Olympia and the Nisqually country, 40 miles to the south-
east, together with their hunting excursions, constitute the sum of their
land journeys. All other travel is by water. The Klallams own larger
canoes and are better navigators than the Twanas, as they live nearer
the mouth of the Straits of Fuca, where there is less protection from
the ocean winds than in the Twana waters.

On January 30, 1878, I started with about sixty-five Twana Indians,
in seven canoes, to attend a potlatch. We paddled until it began to
rain, and also to blow favorably, so that nearly all, except those who
steered, spent the time in trying to keep dry. A few had oil-cloth
coats, a few umbrellas, but the most of them used their common mats,
which are almost water-proof. It was rather comical to see a number
of persons, mostly women and children, sitting in a canoe with a mat
stretched over them, extending almost from one end of the canoe to the
other. From aside view, only their heads were visible. Towards even-
ing, after travelling seven and a half hours, and making a distance of
30 miles, we arrived at Seabeck. The next day it rained heavily until
noon, and they decided not to start again on the voyage until the fol-
lowing day, as there was a head wind which would prevent their reach-
ing a shelter -before night, and moreover they did not wish to be the
638 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

first at the potlatch. Some of them made a fire of pitch wood and cedar
on a board, then putting their canoes on blocks, about a foot high, they
placed the fire underneath, moving it along the whole length of the
canoes, so as to burn off the moss and other material which might have
accumulated on the outside of them, but not leaving the fire long enough
in one place to burn the canoe. They do this to make the canoe run
more easily. On Friday morning the messenger came to me at 7
o'clock, saying they were about to start. I hurriedly ate a part of my
breakfast, and taking the remainder in my hand I started to their ca-
noes. Four of them had gone, but the one in which I was travelling had
not even been loaded. This it took them fifteen minutes todo. Then
it was said one of the company was sick, so they stopped to tamanous
over him, and it was half past 8 before we started. One more canoe,
with ten persons, was here added to our company. The wind blew favor-
ably and strongly, as much so as our crafts would bear. There was a
fellow-feeling among all, for no single canoe of either set of four was
allowed to be far away from the rest, for fear of some accident. If one
could not keep up, the rest waited for it.

In eight hours we travelled about 35 miles, and arrived at some Indian
houses, where all camped within 3 miles of Port Townsend. It had
rained most of the day. We did not stop for dinner, but all ate a
little dry lunch at noon. At morning and night they had warm meals.
The next morning they had a short tamanous to obtain fair wind and
weather. It consisted of singing, pounding on the drum, and on sticks.
About 8 o’vlock we started and reached Port Townsend in about an
hour. Here they spent nearly two hours in purchasing things to pre-
sent to the principal men at the potlatch, and the day being pleasant
we went on, having a race in which nearly all the canoes took part.
As there was little wind it was a trial of strength and endurance, and
was engaged in for mere sport. It was kept up for 2 or 3 miles, until
one canoe had passed all the rest and the losers were satisfied that it
was useless to contest further. At about half past 5 we reached our des-
tination, having made the entire trip in twenty-two traveling hours.

We set out on our return to Skokomish on the 11th of February at
11 o'clock. They intended to travel only 6 miles, camp at Sequim and
visit these Indians, but the wind and weather proving favorable, they
passed Sequim Bay without going into it, and encamped within 5 miles
of Port Townsend. They would have gone farther, but the wind was
blowing so strongly they were afraid to round Point Wilson, which is a
dangerous place when the sea is rough. Here they camped out, away
from houses, for the first time on the trip. This they often do in summer,
but not so in winter if the women and children are along. It was a
calm night, and they did not make much preparation for camping.
Some slept in their canoes, but most of them lay on the ground, and
some fixed up their sails and mats so as to shelter themselves from the
wind.
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 639

The next morning I was up at 6 o’clock and called them, but they
heard the wind blowing and thought it would not yet be safe to go
around Point Wilson, so they did not get up, but in an hour it had
calmed down and they concluded to start; fearing though that it would
rise again (as it did soon after), they rose and started without any
breakfast. Reaching Port Townsend they remained there until about
noon. Then most of them went 3 miles farther and camped; but the
owners of the smaller canoes feared to go across the bay, as it was very
rough.

About 8 o’clock the following morning we again started and to shorten
the distance some of our party took a route where we were obliged to
make a short portage. Often in doing this, when there are but few
persons along, they uuload the canoes and take the articles and canoes
separately across, but this time there were so many along that they
were able to pull the loaded canoes across, having first laid down sticks
over which they were dragged. During the day there was another
race. Wereached Port Gamble about 2 o’clock in the afternoon and
some thought it best to proceed, but the Port Gamble Indians invited
my companions to spend the night with them and partake of a small
feast, which invitation they concluded to accept. The feast consisted
chiefly of potatoes and rice, cooked in kettles, around which they sat,
taking the food out with their large ladles. After dark the women as-
sembled in one house and sat down in two rows opposite each other,
singing for an hour or more, accompanied by the drum and the pound-
ing of sticks. When this was over, two of the Port Gamble women
made presents of from 5 to 12 yards of calico to each of Twana women,
and after 10 o’clock some of the Twanas and Klallams began to gamble
and kept up their game until 5 o’clock in the mormng.

The next morning there was another feast of bread, crackers, and
coffee, some of which was carried away. It was half past 10 o’clock
before we left Pert Gamble, hoping to reach Seabeck, 20 miles dis-
tant, by night. But soon after starting we met a strong head wind
which grew stronger. Sometimes, especially in rounding small points,
we used poles to push the canoes. The Indians seldom carry poles for
this purpose, but generally use spears. About 3 o’clock in the after-
noou the Indians got tired and encamped, only one canoe reaching Sea-
beck that night, and that was the one which belonged there. The rest
were scattered, singly and in groups of from two to four, for a distance
of about 4 miles, and were not together again after this; but the In-
diaus were now in familiar waters and no longer felt uneasy concerning
the safety of each other. [was camped with a party having four ea-
noes. The wind blew violently that night, the trees constantly falling
near us, and it rained so that it was almost impossible to make a fire.
A few had tents, others used their sails as shelter, and the rest arranged
their mats on poles placed in a slanting direction so as to keep off most
of the rain and wind, About 3 o’clock the next morning an unusually
640 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS,

high tide arose, covering all the beach where we were encamped, com-
pelling us to leave. The water was from 6 to 12 inches deep in our
camp before we could get our things into the canoes. So we went back
to Seabeck for breakfast, reaching the place about 7 o’clock. It was
a cold ride, as we were wet, and the wind blowing somewhat against us.
We had to take turns at paddling, to prevent our suffering from cold.
Other canoes came in later. Remaining here until half past 10 o’clock
we again started, and though there was some head wind, we traveled
15 miles more before 5 o’clock, about which time we made camp. Six
of our canoes were in company, the other having remained at Seabeck
until the next day. That night I witnessed a silent tainmanous over a
sick woman.

We encamped onas high ground as we could find along the beach,
but next morning about 4 o’clock the tide was so high as to compel us
to run for fear of being again submerged. The water came only tothe
edge of our beds. A

Some of the canoes started about 5 o’clock and with a fair wind part
of the time they reached Skokomish about half past 10 o0’clock. Others
waited until after daylight and did not arrive until two or three hours
later. Thirty-three hours were occupied in our return trip.

In July, 1876, | made another trip over the same route with these
differences in circumstances: The latter trip was with one canoe and
in the summer. With one man to steer, one to row, and two women to
paddle, we left Skokomish about 6 o’clock in the morning and at 60’clock_
we camped on the beach without tents, having traveled 35 miles. The
next day, the crew wishing to start early, [ gave them permission, and
we were off about 3 o’clock in the morning. They took a cold lunch at
about 7 o’clock, and at 4 P. M. we were at Port Townsend, 35 miles from
the last camp; but the wind was so strong around Point Wilson that
they did not dare to venture there, although they were accustomed to
the place, for they were Klallams and were at home in these waters.
We were obliged, therefore, to remain at Port Townsend ali day. The
following day the wind died down and they wished to go, but as it was
Sunday [forbade them; but on Monday, at 2 o’clock A. M., we contin-
ued our journey and arrived at Dunginess about 8o’clock, having rowed
20 miles that day. We had no favorable wind during the whole trip
and made 90 miles in thirty-one travelling hours, though there was little
head wind to oppose us.

In returning we started at half past 4 0’clock, and were at Port Town-
send by 10 o’clock, where we remained four hours and then set out for Port
Gainble, which place we reached by half past6P.M. There we remained
for the night with the Indians of that place. The next morning, on
account of missionary work, we did not leave until 9 o’clock, and during
the day we were detained about two hours in the same work, so that
we traveled only 52 miles. The next day by 1 o’clock Pp. M. we reached
home, 18 miles farther. Having had a favorable wind most of the time,
we made the whole distance in twenty-three traveling hours.
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 641

The quickest trip I ever made in one of their canoes was 30 miles in
five hours, before a strong wind, and with two sails a part of the time.
. But at last the wind was so strong we only dared to have one sail. At
this time I had a good canoe and experienced navigators, or it would
not have been safe. Few of the Twanas would have dared sail in such
a wind.

In addition to the tamanous for wind, mentioned in the account of
former trips, they would, especially in a calm, when they wished for
a fair wind, pound on the canoe with their paddles or strike the water
with them, spattering it forward. They also whistled for wind.

Canoes.—These are dug-outs made from cedar trees. In making them
they formerly burnt them out, and finished them with the hand adzes
of stone, but now they universally use American axes and adzes for the
first part of the work and the hand adzes of rasp for the second part,
although the finishing touch is put on sometimes with the curved knife.

- After this they are steamed, spread apart at the sides, and fastened
with round cross-pieces or thwarts about an inch and a quarter in
diameter. Holes bored through the ends of the cross-pieces aud the
sides of the canoe admit ropes of cedar which keep the cross-pieces in
position. A rim or gunwale is often made for the upper edge of the
canoe, about an inch in diameter, which can be replaced when worn
out. ‘Those in use are of three kinds. Large canoes, which are made
chiefly by the Indians of British Columbia, and imported, are used
very extensively by all the Indians on Puget Sound for carrying large
loads and for dangerous travelling.

One that I saw was 35 feet long, 5 feet wide in the center, with a per-
pendicular height from the ground of 3 feet at one point, 2 feet 3 inches
at another, 1 foot 104 inches at another, and 4 feet 1 inch at the end.
There were two places for masts, and a seat for the one who steers. The
head of this kind of a canoe is a separate piece of wood. Such vessels
are made both larger and smaller than this one, the largest I have
known being the one exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition, which is
60 feet long and 8 feet wide. None as large as these are, however, owned
by these Indians, but a few of the Klallams have some very large ones
for whaling. The smallest I have seen was about 10 feet long.

Shovel canoes.—These are very scarce, even among the Twanas, and
J have seen none of them among the Klallams. They are used in muck
the same manner as the next kind.

Small canoes.—These are very common, are made by both tribes en-
tirely of one piece of wood, except that some have the movable rim
mentioned. and are used for fishing, river travel, and even for going on
the sound when it is calm and they wish to take only a smail load. I
have travelled 30 miles in this kind on the salt water, but we seldom
venture far from shore.

Very few of these Indians own any skiffs or boats of American make,
as their canoes are much lighter and easier for them to handle, and be-

ing accustomed to them from infancy they fear no danger, although a
white person entering a small one for the first time is apt to be upset,
and they have no keels. |

Sometimes two of the large ones are fastened together side by side
and covered with boards in order to carry a large amount of hay or
ferry a horse for a long distance on the sound, but not for crossing
rivers, aS there are none in the country so wide that a horse can not
SWIM aACross.

Poles.—In travelling against a strong wind, especially around points
ef land near shore where the water is shallow, or where ascending a
swift shallow river, poles about 12 or 15 feet are often used very-ef-
fectively for pushing; generally they are poles connected with the sail.

Paddles.—The most common form in use is a man’s paddle and the
woman’s paddle, a little shorter in the blade and about an inch wider,
as the stroke of the men is deep and long, and that of the women
quick and more superficial. These are generally made of maple, but
occasionally of yew.

The river paddle which is made by the-Chehalis Indians and ocea-
sionally by the Twanas has the advantage that in rivers where logs are
numerous the end fits onto the log and enables the rower to push the
canoe where he can not paddle it.

Oars.—They knew nothing of these until the whites came. Row-
locks of either wood or iron are now fitted into most of the large canoes
so that oars can be used, but paddles are also used in connection. In
dangerous waters they lay aside the oars and use the paddles entirely.
They often make oars of fir, sometimes of cedar, and sometimes purchase
them made of hard wood. The small canoes are propelled exclusively
with paddles.

Sails —These are used with the larger sized canoes, and the largest
often have two. Formerly the cedar-bark mats were used, but these
have now entirely gone out of date, aud those of cloth fastened and
fashioned in shape and style by the American skiff sails have taken
their place. Many sails are made entirely of flour sacks.

Rudders.—Very few canees have rudders fitted to them according
to the American style. Most Indians prefer the old way of steering
with the paddle, for they can steer and paddle at the same time, and
the shape of the stern ofa canoe is not well adapted to a rudder. Usu-
ally the best paddle is used for this purpose. Formerly, when slaves
were owned, it was the business of one of them to steer, for when the
wind was fair the others could rest while he was compelled to remain
at his post. Otherwise I have not been able to learn that there is or
was any place of distinction observed by paddlers. Now the steerer is’
selected according tocircumstances. If the water is rough and the
paddling easy, the strongest person and best navigator steers, but if
the rowing is hard the strongest persons are put at this work.

Anchors.—These were formerly made of stone, but now some kind of
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 643

iron is used. Most of the smaller canoes have no anchors, being tied
with ropes or hauled on shore.

Bailing vessels for canoes are of several kinds, sometimes carved out
of alder wood and without handle. Some are made of cedar bark, the
handle only being of wood. Thisis used but very little now. Often the
water is bailed out with the hand, and old tin vessels of American man-
ufacture are used.

TRAVELLING ON FOOT.

They generally travel only short distances on foot, seldom more than
10 miles, except in hunting. Incoming to the Twana potlatch of 1878,
however, the Quinaielt Indians came about 100 miles, chiefly on
foot. In this short journey they often, the women especially, carry
large loads. The way they usually prefer to do this is to take the ear-
rying strap, tie the ends, which are several feet long, around the load,
when it is of wood, mats, and such articles, or into the handles of bas-
kets filled with potatoes, fish, apples, and other small objects. They then
place the load on the back, and the flat part of the strap around the
forehead. Formerly these straps were made of some tough bark, such
as that of alder, braided. Now they use straps woven of strings and
rags.

Snow-shoes.—These are very scarce and are not often used, except
for hunting in the mountains in the winter, as the snow is not usually
deep nor does it lie long on the shores of the sound.

Land conveyances.—Horses are used much more by the Twanas than
by the Klallams, but so little by either tribe that they take very little
pride in adorning their saddles and trappings. Common American or
Spanish saddles are generally used; occasionally their horses shod.
For some reason the word for horse, ste-a-ké-o, is evidently derived from
the Nisqually word stik-ai-o, meaning wolf, but from what resemblance
to that animal [ have never been able tolearn. Thesame word, stiakeo,
is found, as I am told, in the Chehalis language, and in all languages of
the Sound except the Makah and the almost dead Chemakum.

MEASURES AND VALUES.

Counting.—The vocabularies for the first ten numerals of the Twana,
Nasqually (Skwaksin dialect), Chemakum, and Klallam, are here given;
to which for the sake of comparison are added those of the languages
of several neighboring tribes which I have gathered from the members
of these tribes who are either inter-married or have visited at Skoko-
mish. These comprise most of the languages spoken on the Sound.

These languages are arranged in about the order in which the tribes
speaking them live. In the Twana schitich-ha-chi, and in the Nisqually
ska stik-a-chi means hand, hence we have from the same root, for six
i-a pa-chi in the Twana, and dzil-4-chi in Nisqually, and a word for six
of similar derivation may be found in the Snohomish, Skagit, and
Kwinaielt ; Tukachi, eight, from the same root, is found in Twana, Nis-
qually, Snohomish, and Skagit; kl-tats is the Klallam word for hand,
and tats for eight, and this is found in the Cowichan of British Colum-
bia and Sim-mi, hul-kwunt is the Chemakum word for fingers, and
it is seen as the origin of their words for seven and eight.

Sa-li, two, runs with a littie variation through the Twana, Nisqually,
Snohomish, Chehalis, Kwinaielt, Cowichan, and Skagit, and an exami-
nation of vol. 1, Contributions to American Ethnology, pp. 262 and 280,
shows that a similar sound is in the Shooswaap, Okinaken, Shwoyelpi,
Skoyelpi, Spokan, Kullispelm, Cour D’Alene, Flathead, Tait, and
Kuwalitsk. The Hoh, Kwilliut, and Chemakum would would fall into
a separate class in regard to this word.

Kle-hu-for, three, sligbtly varied, is in the Nisqually, Snohomish, Klal-
lam, Cowichan, Summi, and Skagit, while in Major Powell’s work,
quoted above, the Tait and Kuwalitsk agree with them. In this word
the Hoh, Kwil-li-ut, and Chemakum are again similar. The Chehalis
and Kwinaielt also agree with one another, and in Major Powell’s work
the Shiwapmakh, Shooswaap, Nikutemukh, Okinaken, Wa ky-na-kaine,
Shwoyelpia, Skotyelpi, Spokan, Piskwans, Kalispelm, Kulluspelm,
Cour D’Alene, Flathead, Silowab, and Ko-mookhs are similar.

The word for four, however, in slightly varied forms, easily traced,
combines more of the languages given than any other numeral; baies,
bu-sus, bos, boh, nos, mos, me-es, and similar variations are seen in all
but the Chinook. It is the only numeral which connects the Makah
with the others, and it shows relationship in all of the tongues, adding
the Belhoota above, quoted from Major Powell’s work, with the excep-
tion of the Silowat, Tait, and Kuwalitsk; in all, fifteen out of the eight-
een dialects there given.

The Chinook is connected with the Chehalis only by the word for siz.
Singularly, the words for one and ten vary more than most of the
others.
646 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

There had been considerable discussion as to whether words which
sound alike show a similarity of origin in the tribes speaking them;
but Prof. W. D. Whitney says that numerals and words indicating re-
lationship are of more value as evidence on this point than any others.
A further comparison of the four languages which accompany this shows
that the Twana and Nisqually agree in many points, and the Klallam
is similiar to them in some, but the Chemakum, except in a few instances,
is different from all the others, and these instances are such that the
words may have been adopted from the Klallam, their neighbors. Dr.
Gibbs* is doubtful whether the Chemakums ought to be included in the
Selish family or not. There is no doubt but they are connected with
the Hohs and Kwilliuts, judging from the numerals and their traditions.
Dr. Gibbs is also of this opinion.

In this connection I would say that a comparison of the manners and
customs of all the above-named tribes, as far as I have been able to
learn them, show that they are much the same, varying only as their
different environments compel them.

Whether or not similarity of customs shows a similarity of origin
seems to be an open question. If any customs do, it is tomy mind their
religious rites, for experience and observation prove that they are less
likely to change these than any other. In customs there is little differ-
ence among these tribes, the more northern Indians being a little more
savage.

The Twana language has another form of numerals for counting
money, stones, and small round things, which differs from the form
given mainly in adding to if lis, ellis, alis, or ta lis as a final termina-
tion. The Skwaksin a second series, used mostly for counting money,
which is made by adding els. ‘The Klallam has also a second form, used
in the same way as the Twana and formed by annexing tit-hu or aift-
hu; and also a third form for counting animals, which annexes to the
original eks, tiks, or e-iks. In counting large numbers they cut notches
on sticks to assist their memories. I am not aware that any of them
knew anything about multiplication before the whites came, except by
repeated additions.

Time.—The year was divided into thirteen moons, for each of which
they had names, but I have not been able to learn that they had any
names for particular days. The day-time was divided into dawn, sun-
rise, forenoon, noon, afternoon, sunset, and dusk, and the night had
only the division of midnight. The present names of the days of the
week have been adopted since the whites came among the Twanas.
They signify holy day, one day past, two days past, ete.

Length.—They had four standards of measurement of length: (1) from
end to end of the middle finger outstretched; (2) from the shoulder to
the end of the corresponding hand, arm extended; (3) from the shoulder

*Vol. 1 Contributions to American Ethnology, pp. 159-177.
tSee Swan’s Indians of Cape Flattery, p. 57.
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 647

to the end of the opposite hand, arm extended, and (4) the fathom. In
travelling the standard was the distance which a person could travel in
one day.

I do not know that land was measured, but in all square measure the
above linear measures were used.

Quantity.—In measuring articles in bulk their baskets were used, but
I know of no basket of standard size being used. A person making a
bargain for a certain number of basketfuls would have to see the bas-
ket.

Currency.—The dentalia shell and the abelone shell, or parts of it,
were the nearest thing to money which they had, the former being the
most valuable. A species of olivella shell, found in Klallam waters,
was sometimes brought to the Twanas, by whom it was used partly for
money. Slaves, skins, and blankets were also used for a similar pur-
pose, or rather for barter, but I have been unable to learn what value
they put upon them or on the shells, as their values have changed
greatly since the whites came. The value of the dentalia shell de-
pended on the size as well as number, a long one being much more
valuable than a short one..

WRITING.

They had no system of writing previous to the coming of the whites.
Since that time a small vocabulary of the Klallam language, by G. Gibbs,
has been published as No. 11 of Shea’s Library of American Linguis-
tics; another, of the Nisqually language, by the same author, may be
found in Major Powell’s Contributions to North American Ethnology,
vol.1. A number of vocabularies of the Chinook jargon have been pub-
lished, a list of which is given in Gibbs’s Dictionary of Chinook Jargon,
published by the Smithsonian Institution.* A small Chinook hymn
book has been pubiished in connection with the mission of the Ameri-
can Missionary Association at this reservation, and about two hundred
words of the Twana language are published in Eells on the Twana In-
dians, p. 93. Otherwise I know of no writings or publications in any
of the languages used among these tribes.

GAMES AND PASTIMES.

Gambling.—This is very common, there being but few who do not en-
gage init. There are also professional gamblers, who, like the whites,
generally visit large gatherings, especially potlatches, to ply their trade.
Among the women it is not so common.

There are three native modes:

(1) With one or two bones. This is played mostly by young men
and boys, but sometimes a large game is played by experienced gan-
blers. The players sit in two rows about 6 feet apart and facing each

*Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, vol. VIL.
648 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

other with a long pole in front of each. There are from one to six
played on each side, but rarely more. Then one person takes one or both
of these bones and rapildly changes them from one hand to the other.
One person on the opposite side guesses in which hand it is, or if both
bones are used he guesses in which hand a certain marked oneis. If
he guesses aright he wins, and he or some one on his side plays next;
but if not, he loses, and the other side continues to play. While one
man is playing the rest of his party beat with a small stick upon the
pole in front of them, and keep up a continuous sing-song noise in reg-
ular time. The sums bet on this game are generally small, say from
50 cents to $1.50, but sometimes the stakes are much larger.

Some grow so expert at this game that even if the guess of the oppo-
nent is right the player can afterward change the bone to the other
hand without its being detected.

The tally is usually kept by two of the players, one for each side,
with sticks 8 or 10 inches long, sharpened at one end and stuck in the
ground. These sticks are moved according to the success of either
party. A modified form of this game is played by using two larger
bones or pieces of wood. One of these is marked in some way, either
with a string tied around the middle of it, a carved circle, or if it be of
wood the bark may be removed except in the middle, where a zone is
left. When the small bones are used, it is optional whether one or two
be employed, but when they play with the larger ones it is necessary
that both be used, for if the player has but one it would plainly be
seen in which hand it was.

(2) With round disks. This is the men’s game, as a general thing,
but sometimes all engage init. There are ten of these disks in a set.
All bat one have a white or black and white rim. Five of them are
kept under one hand of the player on a mat, and five underneath the
other hand, covered with cedar bark, beaten fine. After being shuffled
rouud and round for a short time, one of the opposite party guesses
under which hand the disk with the black rim is. He tells this without
a word, but with a peculiar motion of one hand. If be guesses right, he
wins and plays next; but if his conjecture is incorrect, he loses, and
the other side continues to play. The two rows of players are 10 or
12 feet apart. Generally they have six or more sets of these blocks, so
that if, as they suppose, luck does not attend one set they can try an-
other. These different sets are marked on the edges to distinguish
them from other sets. Another way of distinguishing them is by hav-
ing them of slightly different sizes. They are made very smooth of
hard wood, sand-papered, and then by use are worn still smoother. In
this game they keep tally with a number of sticks, used as checks,
about 3 inches long. The number of these varies according to the
amount bet, twelve of them being used, it is said, when $20 is wagered.
I have never seen more than forty used. They begin with an equal
number of checks for each party, and then each side tries to win all,
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 649

one being transferred to the winner each time the gameis won. If
there is a large number used, and fortune favors each party nearly
alike, it takes a long time, sometimes three or four days, to finish a
game. This game is sometimes played by only two persons, but usu-
ally there are many engaged in it. In the latter case, when one player
becomes tired, or thinks he is in bad luck, another takes his place.

Another form of this game is called the tamanous game. A large
number of people, who have a tamanous, including the women, take
part in it, but the men only shuffle the disks. The difference between
this form of the disk game and the other form consists in the tamanous.
While one man plays the other members of his party beat a drum, clap
their hands, and sing, each one, I believe, singing his or her own
tamanous song to invoke the aid of his special guardian spirit. I was
lately present at one of these games where forty tally blocks or checks
were used, and which lasted for four days, when all agreed to stop,
neither party having won the game. Very seldom do they play for
mere fun. There is generally a small stake, and sometimes from $100
to $200 is bet.

The Indians say that they now stake less money and spend less time
in gaming than formerly. It is said that in former years as much as a
thousand dollars was sometimes staked and that the players became so
infatuated as to bet everything they had, even to the clothes on their
backs. At present they seldom gamble except on rainy days, or when
they have little else to do.

There is no drinking in connection with it. Outside parties some-
times bet on the game as white people do.

There is a tradition that when Dokibatt “came a long time ago he
told them to give upall their bad habits and things, these among others ;
that he took the disks and threw them into the water, but that they
came back. He then threw them into the fire, but they came out. He
threw them away as far as he could, but they returned, and so he threw
them away five times, and every time they came back, after which he
told the people that they might use them for fun or sport.”

(3) The woman’s game. This is played with implements made of
beaver or muskrat teeth. It is played much after the manner of dice.
There are two pairs of them. Generally two persons play, one on each
side, but sometimes there are two or three on each side. The teeth are
taken quickly in one hand and thrown down ona blanket. Onehas a
tring around the middle. If this one is down aad all the rest up, or up
and all the rest down, it counts four; if all are up or down it counts two.
If one pair is up and the other down it counts one, but if one pair is
up or down and the other divided (unless it be as above when it counts
four), then it counts nothing. Thirty is a game, but they generally
‘play three games and bet more or less money, dresses, or other things.
They sometimes learn very expertly to throw the one with the string
on it differently from the others by arranging them in the hand so that
650 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

they can hold this one, which they know by feeling a trifle longer than
the others. They often keep tally with small sticks 3 or 4 inches long
and about the size ofa lead-pencil. But if they can they use the bones
of birds’ legs of about equal size. Each one keeps tally for herself. It
is seldom that I have seen this game played, as the women have so
much to do they have less time at their disposal than the men. They
can make mats and baskets on rainy days.

(4) In addition to this a considerable number of the men have
learned to play cards on which they bet considerable amounts. This,
as yet, is the only mode of civilized (?) gambling which they have
learned.

FIELD SPORTS AND FESTIVE GAMES.

Dancing.—This is usually a religious performance. It is, however,
sometimes practiced for mere sport, and I have seen them thus dance
until exhausted by their laughing and efforts.

Horse-racing.—As far as I know the Klallams have none of this. but
a few times during each year the Twanas engage init. It is usually
conducted after the manner of the whites as far as they can do so.

Shooting.—A field sport which is now entirely out of date was the
shooting of arrows, the object being to see who could shoot the farthest, «
and large bets were made.. The winning arrow wouid sell for a large
price.

Children’s plays.—Indian children, like white children, have their own
special plays, and also imitate the ways of their superiors. Among the
former are ball, shuttle cock, shinny, and a native game in which there
are two parties. One side holds some article, while a person from the
other side advances to get it. The members of first side say all the
funny things they can, and the opposite can not have the article unless
their representative can get it without laughing.

In games of imitation they go through all the motions of gambling
and tamanous, and these seem to be the principal ways in which they
mock the older Indians.

In imitating whites they sometimes have several post-offices a short
distance from each other, with as many postmasters, and a mail carrier
who carries bits of paper from one to the other, or they will holda
council in remembrance of the time when some distinguished person
from Washington has been here, when they will make speeches, have
an interpreter, and all things in regular order. Again it will occa-
sionally be achurch, while they go through with the services, or a court
with judge, jury, lawyers, witnesses, and a criminal. An odd occur-
rence took place at one of these mock courts some time ago which
happened to be overheard by their teacher. A boy was on trial for
drunkenness. When the proper time came the criminal arose and said
substantially as follows: ‘Gentlemen, I am a poor man and not able
to employ a lawyer, so I must plead my own case. The court has been

slightly mistaken about the case. lama white man; my name is Cap-
tain Chase (a white man living near the reservation). I came to church
on Sunday. The minister did not know me; as I was well dressed he
thought I was a good man, and might have something to say, hence he
asked me to speak. I knew I was not a suitable man to address the
congregation, but I could not well refuse. So I rose and went to the
platform, but I had some tobacco in my mouth. I tried quietly to take
it out and throw it down without being seen, but the Indians noticed it,
and thought a minister should not chew tobacco, and beside I did stag-
ger a little. These are the reasons I am on trial here.”

MUSIC.

Music among these Indians consists more of noise than melody. Asa
rule the Klallams are far more musical than the Twanas. The women
sometimes sing alone when at work, at funerals, and when tending the
children; but in nearly all their gambling, war, boat, and religious
songs the men take the lead. All persons sing the same melody, but
sometimes the pitch varies considerably with different persons.

Their instruments are also intended more for rhythm than anything
else. Indeed, no single one can vary the tone, the only modifications
being loud and soft. They are used chiefly in their religious perform-
ances. They consist of the drum, deer-hoof rattles, scallop-shell rattles,
and hollow rattles made from wood. Those who have no instruments
pound with small sticks on larger ones, and clap their hands.

Songs.—These consist of work, patriotic, and boat songs, and songs
for gambling and the nursery, for love and war, for funeral and relig-
ious ceremonies. I have known of instruments being used only with
those for war and gambling, the boat songs, and religious songs, and in
all of these the aid of their spirits or tamanous was invoked.

' When gambling the singing is universal in the first method described,
and is accompanied by the pounding on large sticks with smaller ones,
different songs being sung by opposing parties. The words have no
meaning. When gambling in the second method there is usually no
singing unless it becomes a tamanous game, when a drum, one for each
party, is brought in, and there is pounding on sticks and clapping of
hands and singing. In this singing I understand that each one is in-
voking the aid of his or her tamanous, so as to win the game. I was
present at such game not long since, and when in the house the singing
was a confused medley on different keys and I could catch nothing of
it, but when I was a few hundred yards away the sounds had mainly
blended into song.

Drums.—These with the Twanas have a square rectangular head, the
sides of which vary in length from 1 to 2 feet or a little more. They
are made of deer-skin stretched over a wooden frame. Each one has
only one head, and on the reverse side two leather thongs or straps are
crossed at right angles, so as to form a handle. The drum is held with
652 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

one hand and the drum-stick in the other. They are only from 3 to 6
inches deep, but vary in tone according to size. The Klallams use the
same kind of drums, and also have another, which is similar in all re-
spects except that the head is round instead of rectangular.

Rattles—One variety of rattle is made of deer-hoofs, sometimes in
large bunches. These bunches are held in the hand or fastened to the
waist while dancing. The Klallams sometimes also use rattles made of
the scallop-shells which are found in their waters. <A hole is made near
the hinge of each shell, and a number of them are strung on @ stick
about the size of a lead-pencil, which is bent in a circular form and
serves for a handle. These are shaken edge downwards. If shaken
side downwards they are likely to be broken, in which case the person
holding them will, according to their belief, die soon.

It has been found impracticable to translate American hymns into
Chinook or to compose hymns in this language which will rhyme. The
chief peculiarity which I have noticed in making hymns in this language
is that a large proportion of the words are of two syllables, and a large
majority of these have the accent on the second syllable, which renders
it almost impossible to compose any hymns in long, common, or short

meters.
ART.

There is no special class of artists among them as there is among the
tribes to the north in British Columbia, still they make considerable
work that is quite artistic on baskets, cloth, leather, wood, etc.

Their work as a general thing does not equal that of more northern
tribes, but is fully equal to that of the tribes east and south. All the
figures on baskets are woven in with colored grass.

LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.

Six languages are in use by these Indians to a greater or less degree.
The Twana is spoken by those who originally constituted the tribe.
The Skwaksin dialect of the Nisqually language is employed by a num-
ber who have become incorporated into the Twana tribe and who now
constitute about one sixth of it. It is understood also by nearly all of
the original Twanas, and is used besides by a large number of the
tribes on the Sound as a means of intercommuniecation.

The Chemakum is used partly by a few members of that tribe. The
Klallam is used by all the members of the Klallam tribe, and dialects
of the language extend into British Columbia.

The Chinook jargon has been ably compiled by Hon. G. Gibbs. I
know of but three words in this locality of Indian origin which are not
in that dictionary. (1) Sa-by,a long time, found in Swan’s vocabulary ;
(2) Sté6-blo, the north wind, from the Nisqually stob-la; (3) Whilom, a
thread or rope, which is of Klallam origin. Out of about 800 words and
phrases which answer for words given by him, only about 470 are used
here, which shows how the same language will vary in different localities.
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 653
MYTHS.

Thunder and lightning.—The general belief has been that these are
. caused by a great bird flapping its wings, and some point to trees that
have been struck by lightning and say that the bird touched these
trees and hence they were torn to pieces. Some say they have seen the
bird, but others do not believe this. A fable by the Indians says that
the Doswailopsh mountain had two wives: Mount Ranier was one, and
a mountain near Hood’s Canal was the other; Mount Ranier and this
mountain quarrelled and Mount Ranier moved away, and now they
always fight by thunder and lightning.

The sun.—In addition to those traditions given in ‘ Kells on the
Twanas,” I give the following from the Klallams:

‘¢ A long time ago there was only one woman in the world, but no man.
She made a man of gum and set him up and wished him to become alive
and to be her husband. She went to sleep and life cametohim. Being
of gum, he was very sensitive to the heat of the sun, which was much
hotter then than now. He worked when it was cool and rested in the
shade when it was hot. He had some children. One day he went fishing
and told his wife to look out for him if it became hot; but she went to
sleep and did not do so, and the heat grew intense and melted him, and
hedied. His sons were very angry at the sun for this ; one of them made
a bow and very many arrows. He shot them up towards the sun and
they formed a chain or rope on which the boys ascended, and found a
prairie land. They asked the geese, who could then talk, ‘ Where is the
man who killed my father ? and the geese pcinted in one direction and
said * Yonder.” The boys went in the direction indicated, and came to
a house where two blind women lived, and they sat down. As one
woman gave some food to her companion one of the boys took it.
‘Have you received your food?’ said the first woman to the other.
The latter replied ‘ No,’ and both wondered what had become of it.
Soon one of the boys said he had taken it and asked ‘ Where is the
man who killed my father?’ The woman replied, ‘Farther on,’ and
gave them a very small basket, in which were six salmon berries. The
boys went on and soon found some swallows which could talk, and
again they asked, ‘Where is the man who killed my father?’ The
swallows said ‘In yonder house.’ The pair went to the house and found
an old man piling pitch wood on a very hot fire, so hot it nearly roasted
the boys, and this was what made it hot on the earth. They gave the
old man the six salmon berries, which became very many and swelled
within him and killed him. The fire then went down somewhat, and it
has not been so hot on the earth since.”

FABLES OF THE TWANAS.

The pheasant and the raven.—The raven had a trap and caught very
many fishes, but would not give any to the pheasant. At last the
pheasant went to hunt deer. While he was on his way a deer met
654 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

him, driven by aman. The pheasant killed it, and when he was skin-
ning it the man stood watching him and said, ‘* Well, pheasant, you
can shoot straight;” but the pheasant thought it was not so. So;
when the man saw that the pheasant was not proud, he said that the
latter would be able to carry the deer nearly home, only when he should
almost reach his house that it would become very heavy. And so it
was; for when he was almost home it became so heavy that he could
not carry it. He laid it down, and his wife came and helped him.
When the raven heard that the pheasant had killed a deer he sent his
sons to carry some fishes to the pheasant, so that he might receive
some meat in return; but when they were going into the pheasant’s
house the pheasant drove them out. Then the raven told his children
to fight with the children of the pheasant, and they had a battle. The
raven’s children threw fishes at the pheasant’s children, who, in return,
threw the grease of the deer at the raven’s children. The raven sat
between the two armies, and when the little pheasants threw any
grease the raven caught it and ate it. After a time the raven went to
hunt deer. While he was travelling he met and shot a deer, driven by
the same man whom the pheasant had met. While he was skinning it
the man, acting as if he was surprised, said, ‘‘The raven can shoot
straight.” The raven was proud, and said, ‘I can shoot straight, be-
cause Iam araven.” When he was about to carry the deer home the
man said that when he should nearly reach his house it would turn
into something else. So, when the raven had almost got home, he
dropped his game and went and told his wife where to find it. She
went to the place where he had left the deer, but when she arrived she
found it had all turned to rotten wood.

A woman and her husband.—At one time there was a woman living
at ber father’s house, and after awhile a man came by night and took
her for his wife, but soon afterwards he deserted her. After a time she
took some of her father’s slaves and went to the other side of the water
to hunt for the man, but was unable to find him. So she started for
home, but after having gone some distance she looked down on the
bottom of the canoe and saw aman smiling at her. She knew it was
her husband; he pulled her Gown, and the slaves saw her no more.
Some time afterward she made a visit to her parents. At a second
visit a child was born to her. On a third visit her face was covered
with some kind of moss. During her second visit her parents wished
to deceive the man, hence they took a slave with a face exactly like
that of the married woman aud started to carry her to the man, but a
sea-gull cried out and said it was not the right woman, so they took
the true wife and restored her to her husband. This man killed a
great many fishes and sent them to his father-in-law. After a time
the woman died and there was afterwards heard a voice crying, which
was the woman’s voice. When this woman’s tribe go off to sea they
always capsize. (Some Indians believe this to be true.)

A Colcine Indian and a wolf.—One day a woman espied a wolf swim-
ming across Colcine Bay. She told her husband, who, wishing to have
the skin, went to kill the wolf, but his wife begged him not to do so.
The man rowed out to the wolf and patted him on the head with his
paddle. The wolf looked at him and threw his ears back as if he would
beg for his life. At last they both reached the shore, when the wolf
did not run away from the man, but stood on the shore and looked at
him with his ears back. The man, then wishing to deceive the wolf said,
“J do not want to kill you but was afraid you might drown, so I came
to help you across. Now, for a reward, I ask this: You must drive as
many deer to meas you can.” So the wolf went into the woods and
drove home deer until the man’s house was filled with meat. Every
time the wolf came home he would drive home a deer.

The taming of two young wolves.—There was once a great hunter (who
the narrator sal was his father’s brother), at one time when out hunt-
ing who found two young wolves which he thought he might tame, so
that they would assist him in hunting deer. He brought them home,
and when they were partly grown he took them out. While they were
going along they found the mother wolf, and as the man wished the
cubs to grow fast he took her too. After that this hunter never failed
to kill deer. ‘* This,” said the narrator, ‘‘only shows how animals can
understand and act well to those who are kind to them.”

Although there is something fabulous in the former of these last
two stories, if not in both, they may show how the indian dogs were
first obtained by domesticating wolves.

DOMESTIC LIFE.

Marriage.—Among these Indians marriage by purchase was formerly
the universal custom, and even now they are loath to abandon it. It
is customary for a man to seek for a wife within a certain circle of his
relatives. I knew a widower of perhaps forty-five or fifty years who
sought to marry a woman properly related, but being refused he was at
liberty to seek for one wherever he wished. He found a girl not over
fifteen years of age among the Skwaksins, not as old as one of his daugh-
ters, and married her. Her father consented to the marriage and she,
aithough reluctant, was obliged to submit. It is not often that a mar-
riage takes place where either party strongly objects, but oftentimes
the relations consult the parties to some extent, doing at the same time
most of the courting for them.

Usually a man’s relatives help him to pay for his wife from $100 to
$400 worth of money, blankets, guns, horses, and such articles, which
are given with many speeches and much ceremony, something being
said as each article is presented, the whole occupying one or two days.
Occasionally the parties live together for some time, even a year, be-
fora this formal ceremony takes place.

Marriages with other tribes are common. The Twanas are intermar-

ried with the Chehalis, Skwaksin, Nisqually, Puyallup, Snohomish,
Port Madison, Lummi, Chemakum, and Klallam Indians, and the Klal-
lams with the Twana, Snokomish, Chemakum, Makah, Kwilleut, Nitti-
nat, Cowichan, Sook, Victoria, and Summi Indians. It is very common
when an Indian begins to speak of his ancestry to find that there is the
blood of some other tribe in his veins, through either the parents or
grandparents. The children belong to the tribe of the father usually,
and the mother is adopted into the same tribe, though there are occa-
sional exceptions to this rule. At one time I saw a Klallam man who
had just married a Nittinat woman, and when they were married the
man could talk the Klallam and Chinook languages but not the Nitti-
nat, and the woman could not speak either Chinook or Klallam. The
Twanas, Klallams, and Chemakums are also intermarried with the
whites. Very few of either tribe have more’than one wife each, the
custom of the whites and the law of the agent preventing new cases of
polygamy, although those who formerly had more than one wife have
not been compelled to give them up.

Children and their cradles.—A few have adopted cradles on rockers,
similar to the poorer ones of the whites, but the old way of bedding in-
fants is by far the most common. For this they take a board a little
longer and a little wider than the child, or hollow out a thick cedar
board, about the same size, to the depth of aninch. In eithercase they
place on this board beaten cedar bark, on which they lay the child,
who is then covered with cloth and tied to the board by strings which
pass through the holesin it. The hollowed form is more common with
the Klallams, and the other withthe Twanas. A cap of cedar bark,
usually of Makah make, is sometimes used by the Klallams as a cover
to protect the babies from the smoke.

The practice of flattening the head, which was formerly common, is
now ceasing. It hasso often been described that I can say nothing new
about it. Some who have had the head flattened in infancy seem to
make as good scholars as those who have not been thus treated. One
Indian attributes much headache to this cause.

Naming children.—Usually they are not named at as early an age as
with the whites, but when one, two, or three years old. Formerly,
when the name was given, a feast was made and presents given to the
guests. An Indian may change his name once or several times during
his life; sometimes he does so when one of the same name dies, as it is
not good etiquette to pronounce the name of the recently dead. Two
or three years after death the name of the deceased may be mentioned;
and with the Klallams, at least, a person may take the name of his de-
parted father, grandfather, or other direct paternal ancestor. Often
when this is done, the person thus changing the name makes a feast
and gives presents. Nearly all the men, women, and children have
‘¢ Boston” names which they have received in various ways. Some of
these are a combination of Indian and American names and constructed
utterly regardless of taste.

SOCIAL LIFE AND CUSTOMS.

Eating.—Generally they eat three times aday. At a visit of seventy-
five Twanas to the Klallams of Port Gamble, they feasted three times
during one night, closing at 2 or 3 o’clock in the morning. The feast-
ing was interspersed with gambling, conversation, and the giving of
presents. In December, 1878, the Dunginess Indians and some In-
dians from Port Discovery were invited to a feast at Sequin, which
lasted two nights. They feasted first at one house, where they taman-
oused in a manner similar to that described as occurring at the same
place two years previous, and made presents; after this they went to
another house and did the same, then they repeated the same perform-
ances at a third house, and closed about 2 in the morning. On the
next night they went through the same acts and ceremonies; fourteen
boxes of biscuitand « barrel of sugar were consumed or carried away by
about one hundred and twenty-five persons, men, women, and children 3
quite an amount was carried away by them, this being customary.
Very often their feasts occur in the day-time, and consist of only one
meal if the guests are few. There is more or less feasting at all their
large gatherings, including those for religious purposes.

Potlatches.—A peculiar custom with the Indians in this region is the
potlatch, which takes its name from the Chinook word, meaning to give,
as the most prominent feature in it is the distribution of gifts. I have
never heard of this custom existing farther south than the Columbia
River or farther east than the Cascade Mountains, but on the west it
extends to the Pacific Ocean, and on the north into Alaska, a rich
chief there having in 1877 made one at which four thousand Indians
are said to have been present. It seems to be chiefly confined to
those Indians who live near the salt water, as it would be difficult
for those who have to travel on horseback to carry the amount of
articles which they have need of on such occasions. How old the
custom is no one seems to know. A part of the ruins of a very old
potlatch house were found while digging below Port Gamble. The
origin of the custom is supposed to be as follows: A chief wishing to
gain the favor of his people gathered them together and made presents to
them; after a time this was repeated and people of other tribes were in-
vited onaccount of friendship, and the compliment was returned; chiefs
or other persons who wished to become prominent followed the example
until the custom grew to its present proportions. Now nearly all the
surrounding tribes are invited and almost every individual, both man and
woman, feels bound once, at least, to have a share in giving a potlatch;
the potlatches now become so expensive that seldom doesa single person
feel able to make one, hencé many combine their resources for this
purpose.

Often a persen will save everything possible for years in order to give
it away on such occasions, and when one feast is done they will begin

H, Mis, 600 42

658 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

to save for another. In the distribution all do not receive equal
amounts, but special friends, the young and strong and those who are
planning to make a potlatch, generally receive the most in the hope that
they may return the compliment at some future time, but the old and
those not likely to give such an entertainment receive but little, it
being a poor investment to give to such persons. Potlatches are the
greatest festivals of these Indians.

Tamanous ceremony and social intercourse, including feasting and the
distribution of presents, are the prominent features of the occasion,
while as side shows they have courting and gambling, the latter being
very prominent.

These feasts do not occur with any regularity, and there are many
old persons who have not taken part in giving more than one potlatch
in their lives. About the year 1868 one was given by a number of
Twanas. In 1876 another was given to a totally different set of the
same tribe, and in 1878 another was given by them in which only one
man participated who was present at one ten years previously. Others
of those engaged in 1868 had intended to take part, but some of their
children having died they gave way so much at their funerals that they
had nothing left to share in the potlateh.

I was present at a potlatch given by several Twanas on the Skoko-
mish reservation in October, 1876. For many years they had been pre-
paring for it. Old women went in rags, while filling trunks with
calico to give away at this time. Of these boxes of dry goods some had
been deposited in my hands for more than a year. In the winter of
1874~75 they began the erection of the house, working only a day or
two at it now and then; but in the summer following the leader of the
affair died and nothing more was done until the spring of 1876, when
others took hold of it and half finished it. They set the time for the
potlatch in August, but because they were not ready deferred it for one
mouth and then for another. Two or three weeks previous to the event
they again went to work at the house and finished it. It was by no
means large enough for all who were present, but mat houses, tents,
and other temporary shelters were put up around it by various persons.
About the 14th of October they sent runners to the various surround-
ing tribes and on the 29th the first instailment arrived, consisting of
about a hundred Chehalis Indians. They came in wagons and on
horseback to within about 4 miles of the house—as near as they could
because of water. Here they were met by a leader of the potlatch, and
after considerable speech-making they camped for the night. The next
day the Twanas sent six large canoes to take them to the house. At
noon they rowed past the agency, 1 mile from camp, abreast, singing a
solo and chorus, accompanied by drumming on two drums and pound-
ing on canoes. After passing the agency they broke line and so went
on for a mile or more until they came in sight of the potlatch house,
when they again formed abreast and rowed to the house in alignment

with their music. At landing there was more ceremony, for the visit-
ors had brought many presents. Each present was held by the donor
while he made a speech, after which he gave it to a Twana, who replied
to the speech, when the gift was handed to the one for whom it was
intended.

These presents consisted of calico, blankets, two beeves, dried meat,
and money ($60 having been counted as coming from one canoe), and
seemed to be given tothe prominent Twanas. The Chehalis then landed
and went to one part of the house assigned them, where they took
lodgings. The whole performance occupied three hours and was longer
than that of any other tribe. Two days afterwards the Klallams came
in sight and when about 3 miles away a member of the Twanas went
into a canoe to meet them and learn their wishes about landing, this
being the common custom. .

They learned however that while the Klallams were coming, a child
had been killed by the caving of a bank. The child had some relations
among the Twanas, who immediately begana mourning. The Klallams
stopped on the beach at a Twana burying-ground, a mile from the pot-
\laten house, where they left the corpse in a box on a log, covered with
mats and blankets, as they intended to take it home with them on their
return Here a canoe-load of the Twana relations of the child came,
and there was mourning again, but it did not last very long, and after
it was done the Klallams entered their canoes, went a half mile farther
and camped, most of the afternoon having been thus consumed. The
next morning they all came abreast close to the shore near the house in
about fifteen canoes, singing and dancing and pounding on drums, ca-
noes, and boards.. It was intended that this should be the grand re-
ception, as the Klallams are about the best musicians and performers
on the Sound, but a strong wind arose so that it was hardly possible
for the canoes to remain long near the water’s edge. While they were
in front of the house they sung solos and choruses, some of them
holding guns and paddles in their hands and jumping up and down.
One had a rattle. Some had on cedar-bark bands, which had eagles’
and hawks’ feathers and wings in them. ‘The faces of the majority were
painted—many black, a few red. After a few minutes of this perform-
ance the Twanas replied to them from the beach in a somewhat similar
way. Some of the faces of the Twanas were blackened a little, but not
as much as those of the Klallams, and they had neither rattles, head-
bands, guns, or paddles.

Thus, the salutation and reply were kept up tor about half an hour,
when the Klallams landed with no further ceremony and went to their
quarters in the house.

The ceremonies of landing were a slight part of the black tamanous
and the only performance of the kind during the potlatch, and this was
the only reception in which the Twanas replied to the songs of their
guests.
660 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

Other tribes kept coming every day or two for two weeks, and the
reception was much like that already described. Generally, they were
met 2 or 3 miles before reaching their destination by some of the Twa-
nas, who learned their wishes about landing and directed preparations
to be made accordingly, and commonly they brought some presents of
cloth, food, and money and danced and sung, but a few landed without
any ceremony. When they had all arrived it was estimated that there
were from a thousand to twelve hundred present, comprising, besides
those already mentioned, Skwaksins, Nisqually, and Port Madison In-
dians and a few from the Snohomish, Lummi, and Puyallup reservations.

They who lived farthest off had come a distance of about 150 or 175
miles, but these had relations by marriage among the givers of the pot-
latch. Generally the evenings were occupied with dancing of some
kind, either serious or comic. Frequently one whole evening was al-
lotted to the dancing of one tribe. These dances were accompanied
with drumming, singing, and clapping of hands. In dancing they
jumped up and down, sometimes joining hands in a circle, and some-
times each one dancing singly, jumping the whole length of the house.
At times the men alone danced, and again the women joined them,
generally having a part of the circle to themselves. Once almost all
joined in the dance, having green branches in their hands. On this
occasion they danced at one time without progression, and at another
time they moved around from one end of the house to the other. The
Klallams gave one dance, difficult to describe, in which men only par-
ticipated. In this a leader, painted, with eagle wings and feathers
dangling from his head, and arrayed in a long blanket, played very
curious antics with contortions of his neck, hands, and entire body,
while the rest stood near him, jumping up and down to their music, and
afterwards all dressed in striped shawls and blankets, danced the whole
length of the floor with many absurd maneuvers. I think this was a
war dance. One dance was said to be in memory of a deceased child,
after which presents were made by friends of the child to some of the
Twanas. Thus almost every evening was occupied from the time of the
arrival of the first until the close of the affair, a period of three weeks.

There was more or less gambling during the day-time and occasionally
at night, but few, comparatively, being engaged in it at any one time.
Sometimes the gambling was accompanied by music. Once it was said
there was a bet on a game of $200 in money, together with several horses
and guns, but the parties played until 6 o’clock in the morning and then
stopped, neither party winning.

Generally they gambled with disks, but sometimes with the pairs of
bones or cards already described. There are said to be professional
gamblers among them who visit such gatherings, without an invitation,
in order to ply their avoeation.

There was much of tamanous in connection with the dancing, and
one evening was wholly occupied in a tamanous over a sick woman and
child, There was some of this in the day-time also,
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 661

The Twanas, from their own resources or from the presents which
they received, were expected to feed their guests most of the time.
Sometimes they gave the food to the visitors, who cooked it for them-
Selves, but once or twice a day commonly they both cooked and dis-
tributed the food. When this was done, they seated their guests in
the middle of the house in two rows on mats. When the meal con-
sisted of boiled rice, wheat, or fish it was placed before them in large
kettles, from which they helped themselves with their native ladles;
but when it consisted of berries and crackers, bread, apples, potatoes,
and dry food it was placed in troughs, made of 6-inch boards, 8 or 10
feet long and three-sided. Sometimes, when the meal was over, two
persons would stand, one at each end of a long row of eaters, holding
tightly before their faces a piece of calico on which all would wipe their
mouths. They then arose and departed.

The potlatch or distribution of gifts took place in the day-time, two
days after all had arrived. The women first gave away their things,
and afterwards the men did the same. The gifts of the women were
chiefly new calico, with a few dresses and a little money. Each giver
gathered those to whom she wished to make presents in two rows fac-
ing each other, in the middle of the house; next she placed her trunks
at one end of the rows, took out the pieces, laid them in a pile or two,
counting them over, then, taking one or two things at a time, she carried
one to each woman. Each piece contained, commonly, between 5 and
9 yards. Occasionally two or three women combined together and gave
at the same time, if they were not very wealthy, but the richer ones
gave each by herself. About thirty women thus distributed their gifts.
Often several gave to the same person; though every woman present
did not receive gifts, only those who were preferred. Three of the
more prominent women gave away about one hundred pieces each, and
I am not aware that any woman gave to more than this number of per-
sons. If all averaged half as much, they gave away nearly 10,000
yards, and this was the best estimate I was able to make of it. This
occupied about two days and ahalf. A day and a half was then
consumed by the men, who gave money chiefly, but occasionally blankets
and a few guns. The recipients were arranged much as with the
women, but were all men, and the distribution was conducted in much
the same style. There were ten male donors, each of whom gave, gen-
erally, from $1 to $2 to each of his friends, so that most of the latter
received from $2 to $10 each; some got more, and one who was ex-
pected to make a large potlatch in a year or two received $40. They
gave on an average a little over $300 each, and the whole sums given
away amounted to about $3,300. A few of the donors borrowed some
of this money from their friends with considerable ceremony, promis-
ing torepay. One Indian who received a nice beaded cloak and some
other articles put them on a fire, where they were consumed, in mem-
ory, it was stated, of a deceased child.
662 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

The distribution of gifts was the last scene, for then the visitors put
their things in their canoes and left with very little ceremony as quickly
as possible, and in three weeks from the first arrival the house was de-
serted by the visitors. It is considered by them a breach of etiquette
to remain in the house any longer than absolutely necessary after the
gifts are distributed. A few of the T'wanas remained in the house,
using it as a dwelling, for a month or two, after which it was deserted
for nearly two years, and some things about it suffered to go to ruin.
This whole affair occurred 3 miles from my residence. I was not able
to be there all the time, but was present a few evenings and a part of
nearly every day and gathered what information I could from others
who were there in my absence.

Another potlatch took place at Jamestown, in Olallam County, and
was given from February 2 to February 10, 1878, by a part of the In-
dians of that place. The house was built for a large dwelling a year
or two before, the potlatch, however, being in contemplation, and was
about 32 by 84 feet. It was by no means large enough to hold all of
the Indians who attended, but in the village there were about a dozen
dwellings, in which some of the visitors were received. The beds and
seats of this potlatch house were much the same as that of the Twanas,
but the shelves overhead for the storing of articles were differently
arranged. Instead of being all around the house over the beds, they
were along the side walls, with one shelf across the middle of the house.
The two at the ends were used chiefly for storing articles belonging to
the visitors, and the central one was for storing food, which included
sixty sea-biscuit and a few half barrels of sugar, brought by the guests
and presented to their hosts. In one cornera blanket was fastened up,
evidently to make a screen for a dressing-room. I was present nearly
all of the time, having been requested by the Twana and Klallam chiefs
and the Indian agent to go, in order to oversee the festivities and pre
vent any conduct that might tend to produce a disturbance.

The invitation was received at Skokomish on the 26th of January,
and on the 30th we started, and arrived at Dunginess on the evening
of February 2. The morrow being Sunday, [induced them to land
at once, instead of postponing it until next day as is usually their cus-
tom when reaching a potlatch place in the evening. My companions
preferred that I should not be with them during the reception and hence
I went ashore in a Klallam canoe which came to meet us.

About ten canoes from Sook, in British Columbia, had arrived that
morning, with perhaps one hundred and twenty-five Indians; twenty.
five persons from Port Discovery, the same number from Port Town-
send, and forty from Sequim had arrived during the day; sixty from
Port Gamble had also arrived within a day or two.

That evening was given to the Twanas, who sang and danced the
black tamanous. In the dance each remained in one place, and, to keep
time to the music, jamped up and down a little or bent the knees. Their
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 663

faces were also blacked in various ways. In fact, from this time for
five days the faces of most of the Indians present, men, women, and
children, were blacked more or less, some during the whole time. The
paint was laid on in diverse patterns of stripes and spots, and some
were wholly in black, others in red or black. The next day being Sun-
day, most of them attended divine service; but they were too much
excited to give up the whole day to rest, so in the afternoon a number
of the women assembled in one of the large dwelling-houses in the vil-
lage, sat down on mats in two long rows, facing each other, and pounded
with small sticks (14 or 2 feet long) on larger sticks and boards in front
of them, and sang for some time. There was a second performance in
another house afterwards by the women, in which they sang much as
before, only they were accompanied with the drum, and were seated in
a large circle. Within this circle two women and four girls danced.
These six dancers, being graduated in size, arranged themselves accord-
ingly, from the tallest to a child about eight years old. Their shawls
were pinned behind their backs so as to-cover their hands, which were
extended about a foot and a half from their bodies, and they danced
around a circle § or 10 feet in diameter. The evening was given to the
Sook Indians in the potlatch house. For a time they danced in one
end of the house in a manner similar to that of the Twanas the previous
evening, but with more jumping, and their singing was more varied and
quite wavy. After a time two of them stripped to the waist, and, with
their drawers rolled above their knees, ran forward the whole length of
the house, striking at everything and everybody within their reach,
their arms constantly swinging around them; sometimes they went
down on all fours, and, having snuffed the ground, rose again. Around
the waist of each was tied a rope which extended back 6 or 8 feet, and
was held by another Indian, who frequently jerked it, sometimes throw-
ing the tied man to the ground.

Another dancer had a hideous mask on his face and a blanket on his
shoulders, but his actions were not so fierce as those of the other two.
He often sat down. When these were done, other Sook men came,
shaking rattles, beating drums, singing, and going back and forth in
the house and scattering the people who were standing around. This
performance was kept up until late at night.

Monday forenoon was spent at a feast, to which men only were bid-
den. Beef and potatoes were cooked thus: A large number of stones
were placed in a fire out of doors, and when hot the food was placed
on them, covered with small dry bushes and mats, and so kept until it
was cooked. At this feast the Indians did not eat in the main pot-
latch house, but at the residence of one who helped to give the pot-
latch, and who was the sole giver of this particular feast. The Indians
all ate around the house on the piatform made for beds, and the long
troughs for food were placed in front of them on the same platform.
Most of these troughs or plates were similar to those used in the Twana
664 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

potlatch already described, but some were dug out of wood, were 5 or
6 feet long, 2 or 3 inches deep, and about 10 inches wide. There was
one which was dug out roughly, about 24 feet long and the same width
as theothers. Whatever food was not eaten was carried away, and
after the feast was over crackers were given the guests on purpose to
be carried off.

For napkins they used small bundles of beaten cedar bark about 2
feet long, which are very desirable, as in these feasts they eat with their
hands. As soon as the meal was finished there was to be some kind
of performance by the medicine men, and no other persons were allowed
to remain. In the afternoon, as I returned from my dinner, I saw a
masked Indian, the same I suppose that was masked the night before,
and three others similar to the two half-naked men of the previous
night, dancing backward and forward for a distance of about 100 yards
on the beach in front of the houses. The masked dancer went through
some performances not fit to be described. Their dance consisted
chiefly in running around with ropes encircling them, held by others, as
on the previous night.- This dance continued until about 2 o’clock
Pp. M., when they danced off into the woods, followed by forty or fifty
of their friends, with the singing, etc. They all formed a large circle
as they moved off, and did not return until 5 o’clock, when they reached
the beach a quarter of a mile from where they left it. Some three of
them, apparently tired out, were each jerked up by six men wrapped in
blankets and carried into the potlatch house. One walked in supported
by attendants. Ihave inquired frequently the meaning of this cere-
mony, and could get only the answer, ‘‘ Itis their tamanous.” I infer
it was an initiatory custom with the black tamanous. Some .of them,
I heard, were starved a part or all of the time. One young Klallam half-
breed, it was said, was told that he would be obliged to go through
some such initiatory ordeal at this potlatch, and he delared he would
rather run awayand hide until it was over, but the Port Discovery
Indians took him some time before the festival, guarded him closely,
and compelled him to submit. I suppose this was true, as he was not
seen anywhere until the ceremony was over. While these scenes were
being enacted the women met and sang in their usual way, and when
I asked why they did so I was told that they were tamanousing in order
to get strong minds towards the men.

Towards evening the Indians of Elkwa, Pisht, and Klallam Bay
arrived, and landed with considerable ceremony, dancing, drumming,
rattling, singing, and making presents. The presents were generally a
blanket or a few dollars to each one making the potlatch. One man
gave the head potlatches eight or ten small sticks about 3 feet long, a
promise, it was said, that he would, after reaching the house, give his
host $150 in money. There were also a few more large presents given
to the same man, which were kept, and returned to the givers at the
close of the potlatch, so that the presenting was a mere form,
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 665

Many of them had the down of ducks on their heads and blankets.
Before they reached the house a few Elkwa Indians, who had previ-
ously arrived, ran along the beach and entered the Elkwa canoes, so as
to land with their own people. This was the last arrival. Some were
invited from Victoria, but did not come. Those present were, as near
as I could estimate: Twanas, from Shokomish, 90 miles distant, eight
canoes, seventy-five persons; Sook Indians, from British Columbia,
from 40 to 75 miles away, ten canoes, one hundred and twenty-five per-
sons; Klallams, from Elkwa, Pisht, and Klallam Bay, 25 to 75 miles
distant, five canoes, seventy-five persons; from Port Angeles, 20 miles
distant, twenty persons; from Port Discovery, 7 miles, twenty-five per-
sons; from Sequim, 6 miles, forty persons; from Port Townsend, 25
miles, twenty-five persons; from Port Gamble, 49 miles, five canoes,
sixty persons; at Dunginess, one hundred. Total, five hundred and
forty-five.

The evening was given to the Elkwas, and their performances were
similar to those described. On Tuesday I was not present, but was in-
formed that gambling and the giving away of calico were the principal
features of the day.

On Wednesday forenoon the Indian who was to give the feast, Tenas
Joe, made his potlatch in his own house, and in the afternoon there
was a dance given by four girls, graduated in height. These were led
by two old men. Some handkerchiefs and other articles were burned
on a fire in memory of the wife of Tenas Joe, deceased. In the evening
the Klallams danced their war dance, which was rather pretty and was
said to be an imitation of the Makah dance. There were nearly twenty-
five dancers, mostly men, who were dressed in American style, except
that they had no shoes and wore parti-colored shawls and blankets
thrown around them. One man carried an open umbrella. Their heads
were bound with head-bands of cedar bark or kerchiefs, in which were
long white or gray feathers generally tipped with red. Much feathery
down was sprinkled over them. They had hollow wooden rattles and
tails and wings of hawks or eagles in their hands. Their faces were
blacked in various ways. With the music of the drum and singing
they jumped around in a space 20 feet in diameter, throwing their arms
wildly about, now up, now nearly to the ground, with movements quick
as those of a cat in the midst of hot fire. That evening six of the prin-
cipal potlatches gave me $7.50 to pay for my.board while watching over
them.

About 11 o’clock A. M. the finale of the black tamanous began. First,
five men came out of the potlatch house to an open space in front of it.
They were stripped to the waist, with no pantaloons on, but with
drawers rolled up above their knees, and with shawls thrown over their
shoulders. Each wore a head-dress consisting of a band, from which
hung a large number of strips of cloth of various colors, but mostly
red, about an inch wide and 12 or 15 inches long. So many of these

strips hung in front that it was impossible to catch a glimpse of the
face. Their legs were painted with stripes of red, and wet with water
to imitate blood. They jumped around in many ways, high and low,
sometimes running and clapping their hands, while the other Indians
accompanied them with the usual chanting and black tamanous music.
After a few moments they ran back into the house. Then about as
many more came out in much the same garb as those seen on Sabbath
evening and Monday afternoon, with ropes around their waists held by
others. These had cut themselves slightly under their tongres and
chins, so that the blood ran down their arms and breasts a little, and
their faces were so black that it was impossible for me to recognize
them, although well acquainted with some of them. They jumped
around much as the previous set had done, and then went back to the
house. Then the first set again came and performed in the same way
as before, and ere they returned the second set were out again, but
some of them were not held this time by the ropes. Such actions as
these were kept up for nearly three quarters of an hour, when one set ran
off up the beach for 200 or 300 yards, accompanied by their friends, both
men and women, and soon the other set foliowed in a similar manner.
I judged from appearances that L was not wanted, so did not go. They
remained there about two hours, while I went to dinner, and the per-
formers, it was said, were washed by the others. After this they came
back. The first set were in front, surrounded by their friends, who
kept up the usual noise. They ran towards the water as they advanced
and then away from it a few rods, so that they moved along the beach
very slowly. After them the second set came in a similar way and
three women had by this time become so excited that they also danced as
the men did, but in their usual dress. After them came a third com-
pany following one boy. He had on a shirt and pair of pantaloons,
rolled up above his knees, and on his head a band with a very long
feather standing upinit. He walked into the water knee deep, bowed
his head until he dipped the tip of his feather in the water, then he
walked slowly up the beach for about 2 rods, then went into the water
again as before, and so advanced along the beach very slowly towards
the house. This was said to represent a crane, and is called the crane
tamanous. I understood that this boy, who was about fourteea years
old and was a Klallam, was being initiated into this kind of tam-
anous. When each company came near the house each dancer was
seized by two or three persons and hurried, half running and half ear-
ried, into the potlatch house. Two or three times I asked them what
this was intended to teach and could only get the answer, “ It is their
tamanous.” So I could only look on and gather most of my informa-
tiou in this way. As these are the rites of a secret society it is not
strange that the members do not explain them to the uninitiated. After
all went into the house two companies were formed, one at each end,
and there was a strife tosee which should conquer ; but the house was
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 667

so crowded it was impossible to see what had become of the dancers
who were outside. A new dance was now performed. In this a num-
ber of men, taking hold of each other’s hands, formed a circle about 12
feet in diameter and ran around a pole which was set in the ground.
Outside of this circle was another running in an opposite direction, and
outside the second was a third going in the same direction as the first.

There was no confusion and they kept good time to the usual noises.
After this they formed sides to push against one another, each endeavor-
ing to push the other from its position. There was not room inside for
any one who did not wish to be pushed, so I stepped outside. The fun
continued about two minutes and ended ina hearty laugh, which closed
the scene for the afternoon. In the evening all daacing was carried on
in one-half of the house. <A large fire was built in the center of that
half. At the end of the house I saw four of the heads adorned with
head-dresses of cloth strips which I had seer during the day. I sup-
pose they belonged to the first set of dancers. Their bodies lay prone
underneath the bed platform. Hach one, held down by a single man,
kept his head constantly moving from side to side, and one groaned
most of the time. They evidently struggled to rise, and during the
evening one did get up, and it required two or three men to put him
down again. Most of the company were seated around the side walls.
Soon ove man of the company arose, took a hollow wooden rattle, said
a few words, and walked around the fire, frequently makingsome motion
towards the men who were held down. Having gone around the fire
once or twice, he shook the rattle towards some one, whereupon ten or
fifteen men jumped up, ran around, threw their arms wildly about them,
bent down almost to the ground, and went through various antics; at
times two or three would catch hold of each other and jump up and
down together; then one or two woul 1 seize the one with the rattle with
feigned violence and exertion, feigned, I suppose, because only once dur-
’ ing the evening did I see him brought to the ground, while he seemed
to make little effort tostand up. This would occupy about five minutes,
during which the music ceased not, when all would return to their seats,
and the leaders would lay down the rattle. Then another would take
the rattle, and the performance would be repeated, and this was kept
up for an hour or more. After this was done, two of those nearly naked
arose and danced the whole length of the house and back again, held
with the ropes around their waists as before, and accompanied by others;
then they were taken out with a great shout and, as I suppused, re-
leased. This done a company of half-dozen men took one of those who
had been held down and slowly carried him outside where with a whoop
he was let go; after him three others were taken out and released in a
similar manner, the whole act being accompanied with the usual music.
That ended the black tamanous scene as far as I know. By the next
day nearly all the black paint was washed from their faces, and I saw
but very little more of it during the potlatch. As far asI have learned
668 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

the northern tribes on the Sound practice this black tamanous in a more
savage manner than their brethren of the south, and I am told that in
British Columbia it is marked by still greater severity. Friday fore-
noon was occupied by Dick Sooks and his father in potlatching money
in the potlatch house, for the residence of the former was 5 miles away,
and he was a relation of the head potlatcher. In the afternoon Port
Discovery John gave sea-biscuit to the men, twenty-five toeach. Inthe
- evening fifteen or twenty Klallam young men came dancing into the
house where I was sitting. For a time they stood in arow and danced
backward and forward the length of the house, but at last they stood
at one end, dancing to the usual noises, except that of the hollow wooden
rattle, for this instrument was laid aside when the black tamanous
ceased. One Indian put on a shawl, took another sort of rattle made
by the Clyoquot Indians, and danced in front of the rest shaking his
rattle, jumping up and down and around and squatting. While this
was in progress a small company of Twana young men were dancing in
the doorway and on the outside, mostly out of my sight, but there was
evidently some rivalry between the two companies. There was consid-
erable merriment in these dances.

Saturday forenoon, Port Discovery John, son-in-law to.the principal
potlatcher, gave away his money and blankets. It was the first time
I had witnessed all the ceremonies connected with the donation. He
first arranged all the men around the house on the bed platform, and
then, with five or six friends, spent some time in counting his money.
Next, twelve or fifteen women came to serve as a choir, and sat down
on mats near the money. Then came four girls, arranged according to
size, as before described, with faces painted completely red, hair covered
with down, hands extended, as on the previous Sunday, under shawls
or blankets pinned behind them, who danced the whole length of the
house and back a few times, the tallest going first, led by an old man—
“Old Slaze”—and followed by one still older. The choir sang, accom-
panied witha drum. These ceremonies occupied about fifteen minutes,
after which the potlatch began. The giver told a man who acted as
crier the name of the person to whom the money or article was to be
given; the crier then took the gift, heralded forth the amount of the
same, with the name of the receiver, and carried it to the latter. Pre-
vious to this, however, certain amounts, varying from $20 to $50, tied
up, were given to several persons, which I was told was to pay them for
certain articles brought, or was money which they had brought and was
now returned to them. These things occupied all the forenoon, and in
the afternoon Old Slaze gave about twenty-five sea-crackers to each man.
The next day being the Sabbath, I was with them but a very short time.
The ceremonies, I was told, were about as those of the preceding day.
This ended the affair, and after it, all left as soon as possible.

They left about noon, but the greater part of them went only 5 or 6
miles away, as they were reduced to sea-biscuit and sugar, which was
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 669

very dry, and they wished to go where they could get clams and fish.
The Twanas only remained with me until next morning, when we left.

The amounts given by the men, as near as I could learn, were as fol-
lows:

Wednesday: Money, $:00; one beef, $30; one gun, $8; total, $138.

Thursday: Money, $170; one canoe, $20; twenty blankets, $40;
total, $230.

Friday: Money, $270; one gun, $10; twenty-seven blankets, $54;
total, $354.

Saturday: Money, $430; twenty-five blankets, $50; total, $480.

Sunday: Money, $420; twenty blankets, $40; total, $460. Total:
Money, $1,390; blankets, $184; miscellaneous, $68; whole amount,
$1,542.

One hundred dollars of Old Slaze’s money belonged to his wife, but
they combined together.

The men present received various sums, generally about $10 each,
but some received as much as $30. Besides this, seventeen women gave
to the other women calico at different times from Monday until Friday,
each piece containing generally 5 yards, but varying from 4 to 9 yards.
A rough estimate made the whole of this amount to 5,000 yards. There
was only one case each of drunkenness and quarrelling that came to my
knowledge.

During most of the time there was a large amount of gambling among
the men, and some among the women, with disks and bones.

FUNERAL AND BURIAL CUSTOMS.

Their sepulchers, as far as I can learn, represent five different ages
and have, to some extent, co-existed. There are places where skeletons —
and parts of them have been plowed up or still remain in the ground,
and near together in such a way as to give ground for the belief that for-
merly Indians were buried in the ground and not in regular cemeteries.
Such deposits exist at Doswailopsh, among the Twanas, and at Dun-
giness and Port Angeles, among the Klallams. These graves were
made so long ago that the Indians of the present day profess to have
no knowledge of the occupants, but believe them to have been their
ancestors. They care so little however about the remains that fifteen
years ago the land containing bones at Doswailopsh was taken by a
white man, and they were told to remove the dead before all traces of
the graves were obliterated, but no one went there to do so, nor were
they angry when the underbrush of the cemetery was burned and the
ground plowed and levelled. 3

Formerly when a person died, the body was placed in a box which
was put in a canoe, and the canoe placed in the forks of two trees and
left there. There was no particular cemetery, but the body is said to
- have been left near where the death occurred. The Skokomish Valley
was once, I am told, full of sepulchral canoes. An oid resident informs
670 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

me that the Klallams always buried their dead in a sitting posture, and
I am satisfied that the Twanas at least bent theirs up ean the knees
nearly touched the chin.

The following is an account of a modern burial of this kind which I
witnessed in Cetober, 1877: The deceased was about thirty-five years
of age and was a widow. Her father took charge, and being an old
man there was more of the old Indian style than I ever saw before.
She died about 9 o’clock in the morning and at 3 o’clock in the after-
noon I was invited to go to the house and hold a religious service.
When I arrived she had been placed in a Hudson Bay Company’s

box, which was only about 34 feet long, 13 wide, and 14 high. She was
' much emaciated when she died or they could hardly have put her in
the box, even by doubling her so that her knees nearly touched her
chin. A fire was still burning where many of her things had been con-
sumed according to their custom. Her mother was singing a mourn-
ing song, others joining in it at times, often saying, “ My daughter, my
daughter, why did you die?” About thirty persons were present and
all out of doors, the coffin box being under an old shed. I held a fu-
neral service and returned home, having been invited to go to the grave
the next day. About 9 o’clock the next morning they called for me
and we went in a canoe 3 miles to the cemetery, two other canoes
having preceded us, one carrying the corpse. Sometime previous a
medicine man had asked the deceased to become his wife, but she had
refused, and he had said if she did so, he would kill her by his ‘“ tama-
nous.” This, her friends believed, was the cause of her death, and
they compelled him to give the canoe (25 feet long and worth $30) in
which she was buried. Four boards of old Indian make, about a foot
wide and 74 feet long, used as posts, were secured in the ground to the
depth of a foot and a half. Before being erected a hole was cut in
each post 2 feet from the upper end, and 5 inches square, in which
cross-pieces were placed for the canoe to rest on. As each hole was
cut, and the board laid aside until the rest were ready, a handful of
green leaves was placed over it which was allowed to remain until the
post was ready to set up, when the leaves were thrown aside. Leaves
were not however put on the last board, tor as soon as the hole in it
was cut, they were ready to set all of them in their places. Two other
boxes, which I presume contained many articles belonging to the de-
ceased, or brought by her friends, were placed in the canoe, together
with the coffin box, and the whole was elevated to its position and
braced. Over the central part of the canoe, a roof of boards covered
with white cloth so as to more than cover all the boxes, was placed, and
holes cut in the canoe so as to render it valueless for travelling. On the
two posts nearest the water the head-board and foot-board of her bed-
stead (American make) were nailed, and on each of these a dress was
fastened. I then said a few words to them and pronounced the bene-
diction, when all went down from the hill to the beach except her father,
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 671

mother, and brother, who remained for ten or fifteen minutes mourning
and pounding on the canoe.

It was now half past 1 P. M., and a little food was given to all, there
being twelve men and three women present, after which the father and
mother of the departed made presents to all. One man received a gun,
two persons a blanket each, and the rest $1.50 each. After this four
men made short speeches in their native language which I did not un-
derstand.

They said she was buried in this way because she was a prominent
woman, and that in about nine months a potlatch would take place very
near where she was buried, and that as each tribe should come, a few of
their prominent men would be sent to the grave with presents, after
which she would be put under ground. The predicted potlatch took
place about thirteen months afterwards, but she still remains in the
canoe.

Scaffold burial i cemeteries.—Unprincipled white men having stolen
many of the canoes in which their dead were placed, induced these In-
dians to adopt a different mode of burial. Instead of placing them in
forks of trees they collected their dead in cemeteries, placing them in
boxes or canoes on scaffolds. The ruins of such a grave-yard now re-
main about 2 miles from the agency, but nearly all the dead were re-
moved some years ago.

In March, 1878, two Twana children, related to one auother, died
almost at the same t:me—one was the child of a medicine man. All of
the tribe, it is said, were invited to the funeral; about fifty went, but
not a single child among them. They went to the cemetery, 34 miles
distant, in canoes, with much mourning. When they arrived at the
cemetery the medicine man tore down an inclosure where two of his
children had been buried with four other children, relations. Another
medicine man, belonging to the same clan, also tore down an inclosure
where the bodies of two of his children were pla-ed along with those
of two others, their relations. Two of these corpses were above ground
and two below. The coffins beneath the ground could not be taken up,
but the clothes around the bodies were so well preserved there was no
difficulty in removing them. One of the coffins was large enough to
hold two children, and other rude boxes were made of such capacity as
to admit of twelve children being put into eight of them. In one case
it was found impossible to place two of the bundled bodies in the same
coffin, whereupon the cloth which was wrapped around one was roughly
torn off, a little calico wrapped around the skeleton, and then it was put
in with ease.

A large grave was dug near by, about 12 feet long and 5 feet wide
and 4 feet deep, lined with mats, and all the boxes and coffins were
placed in it, completely covering the bottom of the grave. Several of
these boxes were wrapped with many thicknesses of calico, and quilts,
blankets, shawls, calico, and a few fancy articles of bead- work and a few
672 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

small boxes were placed in the coffins with the bodies. All the coffins
were next covered with several layers of calico, blankets, mats, and
cedar boards to the depth of about 8 inches. An old man then made
some remarks, followed by a speech from the child’s father, and when
this was concluded the grave was filled with earth, a little new calico
having been thrown in with the dirt. Next all gathered on the beach,
a fire was built on which two or three pieces of cloth were burned, a
few men made presents to the fathers of the children just deceased,
some calico was given by the women to the mothers, and the two
fathers, with another medicine man, presented small sums of money to
the men.
RELIGION.

The practical part of their religion is a compound of Shamanism and
Spiritism, called in Chinook’s jargon tamanous, tamahnous, or tamana-
mus, and the word expresses their idea so completely that it has been
somewhat adopted into English, for the word expresses a combination
of ideas for which we have no exact English equivalent. Tamanous is
a noun, and as such refers to ary spiritual being, good or bad, more
powerful than man and less powerful only than God or Satan. Hence
the being may be a good or bad tamanous. It is also used to express
the work of influencing any of their spirits by incantation. The word
is also an adjective, and as such is used to describe any stick, stone, or
Similar article in which spirits are at times supposed to dwell, and also
any man, aS a medicine man, who is supposed to have more than ordi-
nary power with these spirits; hence we often hear of tamanons sticks
and tamanous men. It is likewise a verb, and to tamanous is to per-
form the incantations necessary to influence these spirits. In some
cases it is done mainly by the medicine men, but in others by any one.

Objects and implements of worship.—I do not believe that these Indians
ever had any idea of the Great Spirit before the coming of the whites.
They have however a plain idea of a great being, perhaps mythologi-
eal, who has much to do with the world as it now is, and who is called
in Twana and Nisqually Do-ki-batt, and in Klallam Mi-ki-matt. The
word means a changer, and considering his work, it is an appropriate
name. When he was here he was supreme, and they think he may have
a second coming at any time.

Demons.—They firmly believe in the presence and power of malignant
spirits, and much of their tamanous is to conquer them and to gain
their favor and aid. The chief of these demons, according to the
Twanas, is Skwai il, who resides below, but in another place from the
disembodied human spirits. Often a parent tells a child, ‘* You must
not steal or do wrong; if you do, Skwai-il will see you and take you to
his dwelling-place.”

Angelic spirits they believe to be constantly around. Every man and
nearly every woman formerly was thought to have one which was called
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 673

his or her tamanous. Such a spirit was supposed to guard the man or
woman who often communed with it in the dark, when alone in the
woods, and, by various incantations, invoked its aid in time of need.
These angels were the most useful deities they had.

- Inanimate objects, images, pictures, ete.—They believe that these spirits,
both good and bad, may dwell at times in certain sticks or stones, hence
these sticks and posts become objects of reverence. The sticks are gen-
erally reverenced at all times, for, although the spirit dwells there only
a small portion of the time, yet after it has been given to the spirit by
its earthly owner that spirit is supposed to always watch over it and
be angry with any one who treats it disrespectfully.

Tamanous water.—It was believed that formerly the Klallam Indians
of Elkwa possessed a mysterious power over all other Indians; that if
they wished to call a person a long distance off, 20, 30, or 50 miles away,
they simply, talking low, called him and he came; that if they talked
thus about a person, his heart was in a complete whirl, and that if they
talked ill and wished to do evil to any one thus distant, his eyes were
made to whirl and the evil wish came to pass.. Tbe cause assigned for
this was as follows: Far up in the mountains at the head of the Elkwa
River are basins in the rocks; one of these is nearly full of black water
and it is always as full whether the weather is wetordry. In this water,
which is thought to be tamanons, the Elkwa [ndians washed their hands
and arms and thus, it was believed, gained their dreaded power.

Tdols.—The sticks, posts, and the like just described are made by the
Indians consecrated to this tamanous, and hence contain the principle
of idolatry.

The sun.—An old Klallam man informed me that before the coming
of the whites they knew nothing about God, but worshiped the sun as
their God and they prayed to it daily, saying, “Sun, take care of me,”
and they gave food to it at noon. Another Klallam told me that
they also believed the sky to be supreme, and that it was a common
saying of the old ones to their children, ‘* You must not do wrong
or the sky will see you.” Such ideas come to the surface but very little
in their intercourse with the whites, yet I think my informant spoke
the truth, and I quote the following from Swan’s “Indians of Cape
Flattery ” in corroboration: “ Every night we wash and rub ourselves
with cedar and every morning talk to the great chief or his represent-
ative, the sun, whose name is Kle-sea-kark-tl,” while the following note
is added by Mr. Gibbs: “Among the western Selish or Flathead tribes
of the Sound I have not detected any direct worship of the sun, though
he forms one of their mythological characters. He is by them repre-
sented as the younger brother of the moon.” According to Father Men-
garini he is, however, the principal object of worship among the Flat-
heads of the Rocky Mountains or Selish proper, as well as by the
Blackfeet. Among both tribes he. was supposed to be the creation of
a superior being.

Sacred legends.—They have a distinct tradition of the flood which I
modify a little from the one given in Eells on the Twanas: ‘The flood -
was sent because the people were wicked, and it overflowed all the
jand except one mountain. The people fled in their canoes to the high-
est mountain in their country—in the Olympic range—and as the water
rose above it they tied their canoes with long ropes made of cedar limbs
to the highest tree; but the water rose above them. While they were
there some of the canoes broke from their fastenings and floated away,
so far that they never returned, which accounts for a few being left in
the tribe (Twanas) now.”

Ecclesiastical organization—Medicine men are numerous, and are
feared because of the power they are supposed to have witn spirits.
They demand large fees, and sometimes in advance, for healing the
sick. Ifthe medicine man does not consider the amount offered suffi-
cient, he will do nothing until enough is given to satisfy him; but if he
fails to heal he gets nothing, and sometimes has to pay the relations of
the deceased for his failure. He also receives pay for other work he is
supposed to do, such as making a person sick at the request of an
enemy. The calling is confined to the men among the Twanas; but at
a Twana potlatch a Skwaksin woman acted as doctress, and there is
at least one medicine woman among the Klallams at Elkwa.

There are no rain makers; but at Eneti there is on the reservation
an irregular basaltic rock about 3 feet 4 inches in diameter and 14 feet
high. On one side there has been hammered a face, said to be the face
of the thunder bird, which could also cause storms. The two eyes are
about 6 inches in diameter and the nose about 9 inches long. ‘tis said
to have been made a long time ago by a man who felt very badly and
went and sat on the rock and with another stone hammered out the
eyes and nose. [For a long time they believed that if the rock was
shaken it would cause rain; because the shaking made the thunder
bird angry. They have now about lost faith in it, so much so that
about two years ago they formed a boom of logs around it, many of
which struckit. That season was stormy and many of the older Indians
said ‘‘ No wonder, as the rock is shaken all of the time.” It is on the
beach facing the water where it is flooded at high tide, and the impres-
sion is being gradually worn away by the waves. :

Finding tamanous.—The first thing for a young man to do in the way
of a sacred rite is to get his tamanous. In order to accomplish this I
am told that a father would send his son into the woods a long way
from home, where he was not allowed to eat or drink during a period
of from ten to thirteen days, though he was allowed to bathe often and
keep up a good fire. At last his tamanous revealed itself to him in the
shape of some animal, either a bird or beast, which was afterwards
sacred to him. They think that ordinarily such fasting would killa
man, but that he is kept alive by his tamanous.

Using tamanous.—After this the Indian tamanouses for what he wishes
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 675

very earnestly on somewhat the same principle that the Mohammedan
prays. Hence they tamanous for wind, for gambling, and to cure the
sick or cause sickness.

A wicked medicine man can, as they believe, in an invisible manner
shoot a stone, ball, or poison into the heart of a person to make him
sick. They believe this so firmly that they say when the heart of one
who died was opened the stone or bone has been found in it. He is
also supposed to be able to send a woodpecker, squirrel, bear, or any
treacherous animal to the heart of his enemy to eat his heart, plague
him, make him sick, or kill him. The good medicine man finds out from
his sickness what kind of an animal itis and then tries to draw it forth,
and while the common people make a noise, pounding on a rough drum,
on sticks, halloing, singing, etc., the medicine man places his hands on
some part of the body and draws forth, or says he does, the evil spirit,
and when he says he has it he holds it between his hands, invisible, and
blows it up or takes it to another man who throws a stone at it and
kills it. When the sick person is not cured they say there are several
evil spirits, but sometimes the person dies before they are all drawn out
or else the opposing medicine man is stronger than he and so he can
not draw them all out. Sometimes the good spirit of the person is gone
and he is sick. Then the medicine man draws them all out.- Some-
times the good spirit of the person is gone and he is sick. Then the
medicine man tries with hi: hands to draw it back and so cure him.

The first time I ever saw an Indian doctor perform over a sick per-
son was in October, 1876. The patient was a woman of perhaps fifty
years. As I went to the house a prominent Indian came out and told
me that although they had sent to the agency physician for medicine,
yet they were not certain where she was sick. At times she could not
see, she would know almost nothing, and could not tell where she was
sick, and they were tamanousing to find out what was the difficulty,
and when they had learned this they would send and obtain the right
kind of medicine. They say that they often do tamanons, first in order to
learn what is the difficulty and afterwards to cure. Having asked per-
mission, I went in and took my seat, as directed, behind the doctor, so
that he was between me and the patient. The house was about 20 feet
square, a summer house, built on the gravelly beach of the Skokomish
River. There were about fifteen persons in the house, both men and
women, all of whom while the doctor was performing beat with small
sticks on larger ones and sang in regular time. I was in one corner of
the house, the patient (female) in the opposite corner facing me, sitting
up and held by another woman. There were two fires near the middle,
and the doctor was between them on his knees on the gravel. He was
stripped to the waist, having only pantaloons and boots on, and faced
the woman. He had a small tub of water-near the woman. As he be-
gan he almost laid down on the gravel and sang and kept swinging his
head up and down, constantly singing, while the other Indians joined

in the singing for about twelve minutes, when he began to vomit
violently over himself and the ground. Then came a rest of a few
minutes, When he rested and washed himself off. But soon all began
again, when he worked up to the woman and, as near as I could see,
placed his mouth on her chest or shoulders and sucked very strongly
and then blew out of his mouth with all his force, making a great noise,
sometimes blowing into the air, always remaining on his knees. This
was kept up about fifteen minutes longer, when [ left during another
respite. But this was neither the beginning nor end of the tamanous.
Sometimes they kept it up for most of the day and night or longer.
The agency physician said she had disease of the brain, but at no time
was very dangerously ill. He afterwards attended her very faithfully,
and the Indians tamanoused as faithfully, aud she recovered. The fol-
lowing account was given me by a school-boy in regard to his brother:

‘¢ When I was at the Indian doctor’s house they tamanoused over my
brother, for that is the reason my parents went tohis house. First, he
learned what was the kind of sickness. The doctor took it and soon
atter that my brother, about nine or ten years old, became stiff and
while I sat I heard my father say that his breath was gone. I went out,
for I did not wish to see my brother lying dead before me; when I
came back he was breathing just a little but his eyes were closed; the
doctor was taking care of his breath with his tamanous and waiting for
more persons to come, so that there should be enough to beat on the
sticks when he should tamanous so as to learn the kind of sickness.
Then he went on and saw that there was another kind of sickness be-
sides the one he had taken out and it went over my brother and almost
immediately killed him. The doctor took it and travelled (in his spirit)
with another kind of temanous to see where my brother’s spirit was;
he found it at Humhummi (15 miles distant), where my parents and
brother had camped in arecent journey. So my brother became better
after a hard tamanous.

‘¢ There is a class of persons which we can not see; they are poor look-
ing persons; they take young people from these and other Indians;
when they take a certain person that person always gets crazy. Another
brotherof mine heard their dog barking; the people thought it was from
some white people, but there was no white man near and they knew it
belonged to these people.”

I once witnessed a performance which I have been inclined to call a
silent tamanous. I was camped with five canoes of Indians one night
in February, 1878, one of our number being a medicine man; after supper
some water was poured into a bowl not far from a woman who I had
not learned was iil, but she must have been ailing a little; she was sit-
ting perhaps 10 feet from me. The doctor went to the bowl but no one
else seemed to take any notice of it; the woman’s husband went away.
Another woman lay unconcerned in the camp, it being a half-circle mat
house, and other Indians were about, but they did not come near; there
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 677

was no noise or singing, or pounding on sticks or drumming; the doctor
put his hands in the water, warmed them a little, and then placed them
on the woman’s side, her dress having been opened and partly taken
down for the purpose, and he acted as if he were trying to draw out
something. This was done a second time, when he plunged them into
water, placed his mouth next to them and blew suddenly and power-
fully a few times; this was done two or three times, when he left, the
performance being ended.

Tamanousing for lost souls.—Sometimes before a person dies, it may
be months, it is supposed that a spirit comes from the spirit world and
carries away the spirit of the person, after which the person wastes away
or dies suddenly. If by any means it is discovered that this has been
done, and there are those who profess to doit, then they attempt to
get the spirit back by a tamanons, and if it is done the person will live.
Sometimes a person who has much intercourse with the other world
persuades one who is in the best of health that he has visited the
spirit land and seen the spirit of his dupe there, and the latter is thus
frightened into having a tamanous. Again, when some credulous indi-
vidual has been ailing a little for a long time, but not sufficiently to feel
that he needs to employ a medicine man, one of these arrant humbugs
takes a fancied journey to the land of shades to search for the lost soul
of the invalid, the discovery of which he soon announces, and once
more there must be a tamanous. Frequently in the winter when time
hangs heavily on their hands and they are at a loss for amusements
these soul searchers pretend that they have received tidings of a num-
ber of errant spirits and they get ap a general spirit hunt.

In January, 1878, a tamanous of the last kind took place among the
Twanas, and I learned the following facts concerning it from one white
man and some schooi-boys who were present :

The performance is carried on mostly in the night, as it is said that
day-time with us is night-time in the spirit world, and vice versa. The
breaking of the ground is an important part of the ceremony. The sur-
face of the earth is often actually broken in order, they say, that the
spirits of those who are performing can descend into the other world.
When, as they pretend, the descent is accomplished, they represent
pantomimically that they travel along a road, cross at least one stream,
and travel on until they come toa place where the spirits dwell. These
they surprise and engage in fight (a great noise is here kept up by all pres-
ent), and ‘having captured they bring back to this world the spirits of
three persons which they pretended to roll over up in cloth and work
for some time, after which they seemed to give them to their real own-
ers. When they put the spirit of one man on him, he sang his tamanous
song, and when a medicine man received his, he cried very much. Only
men enact the part of travellers in the nether world, although women
and children are present at the tamanous. When they are supposed to
cross the stream they actually set up some boards against opposite sides
678 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

of a beam in the house which is about 10 feet from the ground, thus A,
to represent the bridge. They crawl up the board on one side and
down the other. If, in going down, a man slips they believe he will
die within a year. Several years ago it is said a man did slip on such
an occasion, and as he died within a year. they are convinced of the
truth of this belief. Only eight men went through this journey at one
time, but the rest of the numerous body in attendance pounded sticks
and sang their tamanous songs to the accompaniment of the drum.

While performing they danced with the hand sticks around the idol.
They also wore the head-band. The house in which this took place was
built the previous season for this purpose, and was similar to the large
dwelling-house. I am told that when they are professing to fight with
the underground spirits and conquering them they break through the
sides of the house, which are not very strong, and run outside accom-
panied by all the spectators. At times they also profess to bring ber-
ries from the other world, and if so, the bushes in this world will bear
abundantly the next season.

Black tamanous rattle—In the black tamanous a hollow rattle is
used. Too make one pieces of wood are carved and hollowed, small
stones or shot are placed between them, and they are fastened together
with bark at the handle and strings at the sides. Such rattles are
usually painted black, and are shaken in the hand with a circular move-
ment. They are not now used by the Twanas.

Purification —When a young man went forth to obtain his tamanous
he washed himself, much as already described, this cleansing being
very essential. A Klallam doctor told me that the children, if they
wished to become strong tamanous men, were accustomed daily, both
summer and winter, to bathe, remaining in water a long time, some-
times, he said, for hours, supposing they thereby gain the favor of the
tamanous. He said that he did so when young.

BELIEFS.

Dreams.—The following story of a dream was told me by the medi-
cine man who dreamt it: A child of his died and he felt very sorry about
it, crying much of the time. One night he went to sleep and dreamed
that some one came to him, similar to the picture of an angel which I
had shown him, and took him off to the other world, leading him at
first by the finger-nails. They went till they came to where the roads
forked, one going up towards the good land and the other downwards.
He was led in the lower one where there was no fire and where it was
very dark. A tree or stick stood between the two roads, and his leader
jumped on it and thence to the upper road and laughed at him, saying
he could not jump so, but if he did try he could not get into the good
road and go to his child. He however made the attempt, and in two
jumps reached the upper road, and they went up until they came to a
house, at which his leader knocked. They were admitted, but there was
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 679

no one in the house save an old man, who told them that the child was
farther on. They proceeded until they came to a prairie where was
excellent grass and some sheep, which were very lean and did not eat.
Next they came to a barren Jand where were some fat sheep, and again
to a good grass country with lean sheep. After a time they reached a
hill where were some children and persons singing, and his leader told
him that his child was among them, but that he must not go over the

_hill and see the child. The spirit then gave the dreamer some maple
leaves and huckleberry leaves, tell.ng him that the maple leaves would
be a girl and the others a boy, as children for him. He was also told
that he must not ery for his child as he now knew that it was safe, and
that he must not ery for other friends, as his wife or mother, if they
should die; but if he felt very sad he might ery for three days.

The man says that since that time, when a friend of his has died, he
only mourns for three days. His leader also told him that this world
would come to an end in three years.

Snakes.—There is a tradition among the Twanas that a long time ago
they were not afraid of snakes, but that one man killed several, and at
last killed the king of snakes. Then all the small snakes gathered to-
gether and attacked the man, fastening themselves to his mouth, eyes,
ears, nose, face, and in many other places, and bit him, and killed him,
and now they are afraid to kill or even approach a snake.

Future existence.—Their belief was that the next world was neither
above or below, but somewhere within the earth. There was only one
place for all, both good and bad.

Incarnation.—The tribes under consideration, as wellas the others in
this region, have a tradition that a great being called the changer went
all through this region and did many wonderful things. Whether this
be a dim tradition of the incarnation of Christ, or not, I can not de-
termine; but I have thought it might be. When the Indians first
heard of Christ they associated him at once with the changer, whom
they said they believed to be the great Creator. When I have been
teaching them about the coming of the Savior they have said they al-
ways knew of this, and have repeated some of their legends about the
changer, our God and this mythical being having the same name in
the Chinook jargon, Saghalie Tyee, but in the native language they
have different names.

God is called, in Twana, Wis-sé-wul-us; in Nisqually, Shuk-si-ab;
and in Klallam, Tsilt-si—-all of which, as well as the Chinook, Saghalie
Tyee, means the above chief, while the changer is called by the Twanas
and Nisquallies Do-ki-batt, and by the Klallams Nu-ki-matt.

The following are the traditions concerning him:

Klallam traditions express some uncertainty as to who this being
was, but they usually consider that it was a woman who came from the
south and changed human beings into lower animals and inanimate
objects. Protection Island, at the mouth of Port Discovery Bay, was
680 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

once, they say, a part of the main-land, and it and the main-land were a
man and his wife, but the man became vexed with the woman and
kicked her away, and when Nukimatt came she changed them into land
as they are now.

The mountain back of Freshwater Bay, about 9 miles west of Angeles,
was, according to tradition, a woman, and Mount Praher, in British Co-
lumbia, was her husband, both living near Freshwater Bay, while the
large rock off the cape at the western end of the bay was their daugh-
ter. The woman was bad and abused her husband ; he bore it for along
time, but at last took his things, put them in his boat, and went across
the Sound to where the mountain now stands. When Nukimatt came
she changed them all into what they now are.

One Klallam has told me that they supposed that the sun was the
creator of the world and that when Nukimatt came she was the sun in-
carnate. Another name for her was I-nach-tin-ak.

Dokibatt, the Twanas say, was the creator of all things, making birds
beasts, and all lower creatures before he made man. According to one
Indian he made the moon and sun, the moon first and in the night, in-
tending it to be the sun. In the morning it rose, but it shone too hot
and caused the water to boil, killing the fish and also many animals on
land, and did much damage generally, so then he made the sun as it
now is to rule the day, and condemned the moon to shine at night.
This tradition differs only a little from one given in Eells on-the
Twanas. He created man out of the ground and a woman out of his
rib and gave them a good land, telling them they might eat of all the
fruit except one kind of berries. But the woman, tempted by the king
of evil spirits, Skwai-il, ate of those berries, and when Dokibatt came
he said, “Have you been eating of those berries?” She said “No.”
He replied, “Yes, I know you have.” On account of this they think
that her children became Indians, ignorant, foolish, and dark-skinned.
But the man did not eat of the berries, and to his children were given
letters, the knowledge of books, and a white skin.

A long time after this Dokibatt came again to this world because
things were not good, and rectified them by changing them, hence his
name, which means a changer. The man, knowing that Dokibatt was
coming, sat down and began to whet his knife on a stone, saying, “1 will
kill Dokibatt when he comes.” Soon he came and asked the man, “ What
are you doing?” ‘ Nothing special,” was the reply. Again the same
question was asked, with the same reply. Then Dokibatt said, “I
know what you have said; you want to kill me. Let me take your
knife.” He took it and felt of its edge; it was very sharp. He plunged
it into the leg of the man up to its handle, when the man began to jump,
and jumping away became a deer; and that knife slightly sticking out
is still seen in the legs of the deer (the small part behind, as I under-
stand). Acting similarly with his knife he was changed into a beaver,
his knife becoming the tail.
INDIANS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 681

Another person was pounding against a cedar tree, and Dokibatt
asked him what he wished to do. The reply was, ‘‘To break or split
the tree.” Dokibatt said, “‘ You may stop and go away and I will help
you.” As the person went wings came to him, also a long bill and a
strong head, and he became the woodpecker.

A boy who knew that Dokibatt was coming to make great changes
was in mortal fear, as he did not wish to be changed; so he began to
run away, carrying with him a water-box with some water in it; but
as he ran wings came to him and he began to fly. The water shaking
sounded something like pi-pt-pti repeated rapidly, and the sound was
changed into the present noise of the bird as it begins to fly. So the
dove then began its present mourning cry, “him-6-hiim-6.” And the
Twanas to this day call the turtle-dove “ him-6.”

Other men had painted themselves in various ways, and when they
were changed the colors partially remained; hence the different colors
of various birds.

About a mile above Silanwofs are two large impressions in the
basaltic rock, somewhat similar to large foot-prints, 2 or 3 inches deep.
These, they say, are his tracks. They are between high and low tide,
and were evidently formed by the water.

At Skwaksin a man was crying, and the tears running down his
face he was changed into a stone, and the lines of tears are lines on the
stone, still visible.

He taught them how to catch fish, how to make the fish-traps, and
when to fish. ,

He went to all lands, gave to each tribe their language, and to some
tribes special kinds of food. To one tribe he gave crows, to another a
special kind of fish, and to one beyond the Cascade Mountains snakes.
He came from the south or west, where they suppose the sky comes
down to the earth, as it appears’ to do, and that is his dwelling place.
He came once to create, a second to change, and will come again to
make the world over again when it becomes old.

ANCHOR STONES.

By B. F. Snyper, M. D., of Virginia, Cass County, Illinois.

In the study of American antiquities we meet with many objects of
pre-historic art that baffle our comprehension, for the reason that we
are ignorant of many of the methods of life and the superstitious ob-
servances and religious rites of the ancient people who wrought them.
Of this class the so-called “plummets,” ‘‘discoidal stones,” “ gorgets,”
“amulets,” and ‘‘ banner stones ”are mysteries to us, because their
original purpose is unknown, our civilization admitting of no use or
necessity for them. The names we have assigned to them are some-
times misleading, and even the uses to which recent Indians have applied
them can not be relied upon as correctly indicating their true design.
Thus, Adair, Lawson, Timberlake, and others have described the game
of Chungke which they saw played by the Mandans, and by the Cherokees,
Creeks, and other Southern Indians, with discoidal stones; but neither
they nor any other white persons have ever seen an Indian manufactur-
ing a discoidal stone; and because recent Indians utilized them in their
games, it is by no means conclusive that they may not have found them
already made, as we do, or that they were not as ignorant of the spe-
cific service for which their remote ancestors made them as we are.

But, on the other hand, it is reasonably certain that many of the ways
and means of obtaining subsistence employed by the earlier aborigines
were identical with those practiced by the Indians here who first met
the invasion of Europeans and sullenly receded before it. In securing
food by hunting and fishing all primitive people, the world over, yet
unacquainted with the use of metals, resorted to very much the same
arts and appliances. The bow and stone-pointed arrows and spears,
bone fish-hooks and harpoons, rude traps, nets, and seines were the in-
ventions and contrivances alike of peoples widely separated and un-
known to each other. To savages who had progresséd so far as to
venture upon the water, on rafts or in canoes for catching fish, the neces-
sity of remaining stationary while so engaged would soon become ap-
parent, and the means for accomplishing this would naturally suggest
the employment of some heavy substance resting on the bottom of the
lake or stream as an anchor. A stone would the most readily and con-
veniently supply this want, and almost anywhere along the shores of

683
684 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

our rivers and lakes stones of requisite dimensions for such use could
be easily obtained. Rough stones, demanding no labor for their prep-
aration, were probaby so used since the first canoes were launched.
Taken from the nearest point when needed, they were cast aside at any
place when no longer wanted, bearing no mark or sign of their service.
In some instances the same stone was repeatedly used as an anchor
during the fishing season, and received from the fisherman some modi-
fication of form to better fit it for its office, and in a few exceptional
cases the anchor stone was completely and artistically fashioned from
the rough, angular rock. In one respect the aboriginal American did
not materially differ from a numerous class of his civilized successors 5.
he had no especial fondness for manual labor. Consequently, it is not
surprising that he expended so little work on his stone anchors when
he found them to answer his purpose as well or better without it.

Of the very few manufactured anchor stones, presumably of pre-his-
toric date, of which we have any account, I have been so fortunate as
to secure a fine specimen, which is figured on page 194 of the elabor-
ate monograph on Prehistoric Fishing, by the late learned curator of
the department of antiquities of the Smithsonan Institution, Dr. Charles
Rau, accompanied by a brief description of it by myself in a note I ad-
dressed to the author. Before reproducing that description here I will
describe the first specimen of the kind that came into my possession,
and which was also mentioned in my note referred to.*

This anchor stone, represented by Fig. 1 (accompanying Plate I), I
stated to Dr. Rau, was “apparently natural in its form; a smooth, water-
worn river rock, etc.” A subsequent careful inspection of the stone
proves this statement to be not altogether correct. By attrition and the
force of water currents it had probably approximated its present shape
in general outline; but it is plainly to be seen that its smooth, rounded
edges and uniform surfaces have been wrought with patient labor guided
by consummate skill. There is little doubt that this stone was designed
to serve a double purpose; or, having been made for a specific use, in
which it did duty for a time, was afterward converted, by cutting the
groove across it, into a canoe anchor. In diameter it is 12 inches, in thick-
ness 24 inches, and weighs 26 pounds. It is nearly circular, and its sur-
faces are concavo-convex; the one side convex to the extent of rising in
the center three-fourths of an inch above the plane of its circumference,
and the other side has been hollowed out to a corresponding depth.
Across its face and over the edges a groove has been cut an inch and a
quarter wide, but not deep; sufficiently deep, however, to clearly indi-
cate its use—or one of its uses—as an anchor. It is a white, crystal-
line iimestone, from one of our local carborniferous strata that crop out
in many places on the Illinois River. But for the vertical groove in this
specimen it would not differ materially from many others found here and

elsewhere in the Mississippi Valley, having on one side, and sometimes
on both, shallow, basin-like depressions artificially scooped out. Stones
of this character are found of various dimensions and different kinds, and
are commonly known as ‘“‘ mortars,” the general belief being that they
were used in some inexplicable way for grinding grain with the aid of pes-
tles, somewhat as the metate is still employed by the Pueblos and Mex-
icans. Fig. 2 (Plate I,) represents a typical specimen of the objects
mentioned, now in my collection. It was found near the bank of the
Illinois River in excavating a cellar in the city of Beardstown, in this
county, on the site of an ancient Indian camping ground. Itisasmooth,
water-worn bowlder of hard greenstone (diorite), with both sides hol-
lowed out dish-like to the depth of almost an inch at the center below
the edges. It weighs a fraction over 15 pounds, is 94 inches in length,
7 inches wide, and 34 in thickness at the circumference; with rounded
borders smooth, excepting at both ends, and on one side for a space the
stoue is roughened and battered as though it had been used as a maul
for breaking other stones, or as an anvil upon which hard substances
had been hammered. Fig. 3 (Plate II) is another so-called mortar of
the class most frequently found, from one of the counties in the south-
ern part of this State (Illinois); a rough block of granite weighing 16
pounds, with smoothly-worn depressions on both sides. The excava-
tions in all the objects of this class, including Fig. 1, are so insignificant,
so shallow and broad, as to preclude their supposed use as mortars.
*“ Dished ” stones of this character are comparatively common in south-
ern Illinois and farther east on both sides of the Ohio River. And in
the same territory stone mullers, of which Fig. 4 (Plate [1) is the ordi-
nary type, are also frequently met with. The correlation of the two im-
plements is a natural inference at first sight, but the experiments [ have
tried with those in my collection satisfied me that the two implements
were not used together. I could find none of the pestles to fit the mor-
tars. The pestles have broad, flat bases not adapted to concavities,
and must have been used, if used as pestles at all, on plane surfaces, as
our painters of a generation ago employed similar stone mullers for
grinding their paints on broad, flat slabs of marble. The “dished”
stones, in my opinion, are simply the rubbing-stones, or whetstones
upon which, with the aid of sand and water, the diorite axes and celts
received their cutting edges.

The anchor stone I was describing when led into this digression was
found in a small sand mound, 15 feet in diameter and 2 feet high, a
short distance from the Illinois River, in the suburbs of the city of
Beardstown. The mound covered the much-decayed skeleton of a
large, middle-aged individual, who had been laid on the surface of the
ground, on his back, at full length, with feet to the west and arms ex-
tended down his sides. The back of the skuli rested in the concavity
of the stone, which had been placed as a pillow under the occiput of
the corpse. Under each shoulder and under each elbow, each hip and
each heel of the skeleton, was found a common, smooth, water. worn
686 ANTHROPOLOGICAL PAPERS.

pebble, of the average size of a hen’s egg; in or near one hand, seven
flint arrow points; and in or near the other hand, three large scales of
the alligator gar—that perhaps had also served as arrow points—com-
pleted the sepulchral deposit.

My second anchor stone, Fig. 5 (Plate II), the one figured in Prehis-
toric Fishing, was brought up from the bottom of the Hlinois River,
half a mile below the confluence of the Sangamon, by one of the Gov-
ernment boats employed in improving the channel for navigation. It
is of compact, yellow sandstone, the most prominent rock of the coal
measures underlying the Sangamon and Illinois bluffs in this county.
It weighs 344 pounds; is symmetrically proportioned; circular in con-
tour; 12 inches in diameter by 64 in thickness at the center, with neatly
rounded edges, and is encircled by a groove, 14 inches wide and three-
fourths of an inch deep, cut across the face equally on both sides. The
surface of the stone is not smooth, but presents the appearance of hav-
ing been ‘‘ bush-hammered ”—to use a term of modern stone-entters—the
result of pecking with sharp-pointed flints or other hard stones. The
groove around it is-regularly and skillfully cut, and shows throughout
the pitting of the pointed stone instrument that shaped it.

Not long after the recovery of this anchor stone the dredge brought
up another one from the bottom of the river, at a point 2 miles farther
down stream, that was almost an exact copy of the one I have just
described, in material, dimensions, and form. Unfortunately it escaped
the notice of any one capable of properly appreciating its value, and
fell into the possession of an ignorant German who at the time was
employed as a laborer on the boat. His estimate of this interesting
nautical relic was more practical than scientific; and carrying it to his
home he there utilized it as a weight in the family kraut barrel that
stood in a corner of his kitchen. In this ignoble service I found it
and attempted its deliverance ; but, suspicious that my desire to obtain
the stone sprung from a secret knowledge of some extraordinary in-
trinsic value it possessed, neither price nor persuasion would induce
the kraut-eating plebeian to part with it, and I sadly left it in its
vulgar obscurity. Before another opportunity was presented for re-
newing my efforts to secure it the Teuton’s hovel was accidentally
destroyed by fire, and the much-coveted anchor stone was shattered
in fragments by the intense heat.

A few years later, in the same locality, I discovered another anchor
stone near the door-step of a small farm house at the foot of the bluffs
on the west side of the Tilinois. ‘The farmer, who was also a fisher-
man, found it at the river’s edge at low water, and, noticing its peculiar
shape and surface marks and the encircling groove, he was intelligent
enough to recognize it as as “Indian relic” and mercenary enough
to hold it for a good price. This stone anchor had not been finished
when it was lost or abandoued by its ancient owner. The rough
angles of the rock had been pecked away and rounded with sharp
flists and the block reduced to an irregular oval, as shown in Fig. 6

(Plate III). The groove around it is not completed, but cut suffi-
ciently deep to securely hold the anchor line. It is of the same yellow,
massive sandstone from which the two last-described anchors were
wrought. It weighs 43 pounds; is 12 inches in length, 104 inches in
width, and 6 in thickness. This stone, like Fig. 1, had served in more
than one capacity. Though in general contour each side approaches
regular convexity, there is in the middle of each surface a slight, sau-
cer-like depression worn on the side shown in the cut, perfectly smooth;
but on the reverse side the hollow is rough and incomplete. The stone
bears all over, excepting in the front depression, the pitting marks of
the sharp-pointed flints used in its reduction.

The extended researches of Dr. Rau throughout both hemispheres*
in the arts and artifices employed by primitive peoples for catching
fish, with all the facilities afforded him by the Smithsonian Institution
and his mastery of several languages, have brought to light a very
limited number of wrought stones designed to serve especially as boat
anchors. The conception of making an anchor of a rock was as natural
to savages unacquainted with metals as was the expediency of making
weapons and tools of stone; but as the rocks in their natural condition
were the most efficient as anchors, it is difficult to comprehend why so
much labor was expended in cutting any of them to prescribed patterns
for this service. The sculptured rounded anchor stones perhaps were
port of the equipment of bark canoes, so thin and fragile as to be en-
dangered by carrying rough stones heavy enough to answer as safe
anchors; hence cutting down projecting points and angles became
necessary as a precautionary measure to guard against accidental scut-
tling of the craft. If this explanatory suggestion is rejected as improb-
able or inadequate, we must then ascribe the exceptional flint-chiseled
anchor stones to the esthetic element inherent in the Indian. In point
of age there is little doubt that these interesting relics ante-date the ad-
vent of Europeans, They are certainly the product of Indian art, for
the negative reason, if no other, that white men had no incentive and
were under no necessity for wasting so much useless labor on such ob-
jects. ‘Stones are still employed,” remarks Dr. Rau.t ‘instead of an-
chors for small craft in Europe as well as in North America, and prob-
ably all over the world. With regard to North American anchor stones,
therefore, some discrimination is required to discover whether an object
of this class is a relic of the former inhabitants or of their white suc-
cessors, and there may be cases in which a proper distinction becomes
well-nigh impossible. Our fishermen on the great lakes and rivers al-
most universally use stones in lieu of anchors.”

In this respect there can however be no uncertainty as to the an-
tiquity of my first specimen, Fig. 1. Its inhumation with the body of
the fishermen who probably made and used it, and its association in
the mound tumulus with flint arrow points, are sufficiently conclusive.

But with the others their claim to pre-historic origin rests more on pre
sumption and assumption than upon positive evidence. They were
sculptured in symmetrical form from rough blocks by precisely the
same method employed by pre-historic makers of stone celts and grooved
axes, who reduced fragments and small bowlders of igneous rocks to
the required shapes of finished impiements by pecking them down with
pointed pieces of flint or quartz. Of all the stones used as anchors in
the historic period (of North America) there is not an instance recorded
of one of them having been wrought tiroughout by this method. But
stones are at this day modified by the pecking process for use as anchors
by Indians, and it may be, by whites also.

A few summers ago my collection was visited by Dr. W. H. Daly, an
eminent physician of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as he was returning
from one of his annual hunting and fishing excursions, this time to the
northern lakes. The anchor stones attracted his notice, and he told me
that a few days ago he had seen quite a number (fifty or more) ‘stones
like those, with grooves cut around them,” scattered along the lake
shore near the town of Bayfield, in Wisconsin. Here indeed was a rev-
elation; enough anchor stones to stock all the museums of our coun-
try. I lost. no time in writing to a friend at Bayfield, and the corre-
spondence in due time fructified in my receipt of two of the anxiously
expected objects, one of which is represented by Fig. 7 (Plate III), ac-
companied by a brief account of them as follows: ‘‘ The stones you inquire
about, two of which I to-day express to you as requested, are not pre-
historic, but very recent. They are the common water-worn bowlders of
primitive rocks found everywhere on our lake shores by thousands. The
Indians (Chippewas) living up north come down here every spring to
fish, and use these stones to anchor their bark canoes while fishing near
the lake shore. As the bowlders are quite smooth, and mostly round,
the fishermen have to cut grooves around them to hold the anchor lines.
This they do very quickly and expertly by pecking the groove out with
sharp-pointed pieces of quartz and other hard rocks. When they get
done fishing here they leave these grooved bowlders on the shore for
use again the next spring. Some are lost by rolling into the lake and
others are carried away by floating ice; so they have to be replenished
by making new ones every year.” Fig. 7, [ was assured, was fairly rep-
resentative of the entire lot. Itis a polished bowlder of dense, bluish
trap, weighing 32 pounds, and is 11 inches in length by 94 inches in
diameter at the middle. The groove is an inch wide and three-fourths
of an inch deep, and presents the same pitting that marks the entire
surfaces of Figs. 5 and 6.

On receiving the grooved bowlders I immediately wrote to my la-
mented friend, Dr. Rau, giving him a minute description and drawings
of them, and inclosing a copy of the foregoing letter. But his Prehis-
toric Fishing had then passed through the press, and he answered:
‘‘ What a pity that your valuable discovery of modern anchor stones,
came post festum.”

ANTIQUITIES IN MEXICO.

By S. B. Evans.

The town of Tezcoco in Mexico, though uninteresting in general ap-
pearance, contains within its limits and vicinity several large mounds,
one of which is reputed to be the site of the palace of Nezahuyucoatl,
and upon it is a female chapel. An Indian is the owner of one of the
tloletes or mounds and in leveling the base or lower terrace on the
western side, for the purpose of increasing the area of his kitchen
garden, he recently encountered a large stone which interfered with
his plans and set him to work clearing off another portion of the mound.
Hearing of this stone, and obtaining permission to lift it from its rest-
ing place, I found it to be a section of ar ancient monument of por-
phyry, sculptured in bas-relief. Itis 8 feet in length and 6 feet 9 inches
at the greatest diameter, the sculpture representing a colossal human
figure, a portion of which is visible on this fragment. It appears that
it was broken off at the neck and divided down the trunk to the hips,
leaving intact the left side, the arm, and a calendar beneath the arm 2
feet in diameter. The left hand is shown with palm turned inward.
The calendar, which is near 6 feet in circumference, is provided with an
index, which points to a certain place on the dial, indicating probably
the time of the dedication of the monument. The surface of this stone
shows marks of violence, as is indicated in the drawing (Fig. 1), given
on the following page.

There is a gorget on the neck, a decoration on the breast, and hiero-
glyphics on the arm, representing, according to Mexican authority,
phases of the moon. Upon the index of its calendar is a well-defined
Maltese cross. The pedestal of this monument was perhaps in the tem-
ple, built on the summit of this mound, from which it was hurled by
the Spaniards at the time of the conquest.

The mound was about 60 feet in height and had three terraces or
stages, traces of which are to-day plainly perceptible.

Itis probable that the Tezcoconians whom Cortez found here were
the sculptors of this monument. They, as well as the Aztecs of Mexico,
were but a wandering tribe of barbarians three hundred years previous
to the advent of the Spaniards. They entered the valley in the begin-

ning of the thirteenth century and settled on the eastern border of
the lake opposite Mexico. The descendants of these people live in
the vicinity of Tezcoco to-day and for three hundred and sixty years
have been in contact with European civilization without having ae-
quired much knowledge of civilized arts. They are still the Indians
whose highest works of art are the feathered pictures which their an-
cestors made at the time of the invasion.

Fic. 1.—Fragment of sculptured porphyry.

If these Indians, whom Cortez found in. possession of the soil, were
not the authors of these monuments, who did make them? It is quite
the fashion to ascribe to the Toltecs everything which is not under-
stood and about which there is a doubt; but there is a grave doubt as
to the Toltees themselves and as to the time when they occupied this
valley. It is certain however as to the date of occupation of the
Aztecs. Itis certain, too, that Tenochlitlon or Mexico was their highest
achievement in art or architecture, and Mexico at the time of the con-
quest, instead of being such a city as Prescott pictures it, was but a
collection of mud houses. There were no palaces and there are no re-
mains of palaces in the city of Mexico. Wearied with wandering, the
Aztecs finding the remains of a civilization adapted ‘themselves to it the
best they could, adopting the idols and blending the religion of the
people who preceded them with their own rude idolatry. This is per-
haps the cause of the strange contradictions in Aztec remains. In no
other way can we account for the defacement of the so-called sacrificial
stone by the cutting of a rude channel through its finely sculptured
ANTIQUITIES IN MEXICO. 691

surface, in which the blood of victims flowed in honor of the fierce
Aztec deities. The same theory will also account for the presence of
such a work of art as the sculptured slab of Tezcoco in the midst of a
collection of mud huts, such as Cortez found and dignified with the
name of a city.

The drawing of this “find” (represented in the foregoing figure), was
made by Mr. W. H. Bishop, and the following is the translation of the
certificate of discovery issued to me by citizen Eugenie Villadosola,
political chief of the district of Tezcoco, in the State of Mexico, June 3,
1882:

I certify that Seftor S. B. Evans, chief of the expedition sent by the director of
the newspaper called the Chicago Times, has presented himself in this town for the
purpose of examining the ancient monuments that exist in this district which is
under my direction, and having discovered in an excavation that had already been
begun a stone that is said to be the ancient calendar stone of Tezcoco, the dimensions
and drawings of which he has in his possession, I hereby issue to said Sefor Evans
this certificate of discovery this 5th day of June, 1882.

The monument, by order of Senor Mendoza (since deceased), director
of the national museum at Mexico, has been removed to the city.
BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR OF ARNOLD GUYOT.*

By JAMES D. DANA.

It is a remarkable fact in the history of American science that. forty
years since, the small Republic of Switzerland lost, and America gained,
three scientists who became leading men of the country in their several
departments—A gassiz in Zoology, Guyot in Physical Geography, and
Lesquereux in Paleontological Botany ; Agassiz coming in 1846, Guyot
and Lesquereux in 1848. <A fourth, Mr. L. F. De Pourtalés, who ae-
companied Agassiz, also merits prominent mention; for he was “the
pioneer of deep-sea dredging in America.”t The Society of the Nat-
ural Sciences at Neuchatel lost all four. As an American Academy of
Sciences we can not but rejoice in our gain; but we may also indulge
at least in a passing regret for Neuchatel, and recognize that in the
life and death of Agassiz, Pourtalés, and Guyot we have common inter-
ests and sympathies.

My own acqnaintance with Professor Guyot commenced after his ar-
rival in America, when half of his life was already passed. In prepar-
ing this sketch of our late colleague I have therefore drawn largely from
others, and chiefly from his family, and from a memorial address by Mr.
Charles Faure, of Geneva, one of his pupils, which was published in
1884 by the Geographical Society of Geneva.t

Youth—EHducation in Switzerland and Germany, 1807 to 1835.—To ob-
tain a clear insight into the character of Professor Guyot it is impor-
tant to have in view, at the outset, the fact that the Guyot family, early
in the sixteenth century, became Protestants through the preaching of
the French reformer, Farel, the cotemporary of Luther; and also the
sequel to this fact, that at the revocation of the edict of Nantes, the
Guyot family was one of the sixty that ‘moved into the principality of
Neuchatel and Valangin from the valleys of Pragela and Queyraz in
the high Alps of Dauphiny. Thus the race was one of earnestness and
high purpose, of the kind and origin that contributed largely to the
foundations of the American Republic.

694 MEMOIR OF GUYOT.

Professor Guyot’s father, David Pierre, esteemed for his *‘ prompt
intelligence and perfect integrity,” married, in 1796, Mademoiselle
Constance Favarger, of Neuchatel, ‘¢a lady of great personal beauty
and rare nobility of character.” Arnold Henri, one of twelve children,
was born at Boudevilliers on the 28th of September, 1807, and was
named after the Swiss patriot of the fourteenth century, Arnold von
Winkelried. About 1818 the family moved to Hauterive, 3 miles from
Neuchatel, where his father died the following year. From the house
at Hauterive young Guyot had before him, to the southeastward, the
whole chain of the Alps from Mt.Blanc to Titlis; and his sensitive nature
must have drawn inspiration from the glorious view—the same deep
draughts that he attributed to young Agassiz in his academic memoir
of his friend, with reference to the same circumstance—the snowy Bern-
ese Oberland, the Jungfrau, the Schreckhorn, the Finsteraarhorn, the
EKigers, and other summits to Mt. Blane, ‘‘ looming up before his eyes
in the view from his house.” Such views are calculated to make phys-
ical geographers and geologists of active minds. Guyot early found
pleasure in the collection of insects and plants, and evinced in this and
other ways the impress that nature was making upon him.

Previous to the year 1818, and for a while after, Guyot was at school
at La Chaux-de-Fonds, a noted village “at the foot of a narrow and
savage gorge of the Jura,” 3,070 feet above the sea. In 1821, then
fourteen years of age, he entered the College of Neuchatel, where he
was a classmate of Leo Lesquereux, the botanist. ‘‘ Guyot and I,” says
Lesquereux, ‘‘ were, for some years, brothers in study, working in com-
mon and often spending our vacations together, either at Guyot’s home,
at Hauterive, or with my parents at Fleurier; and I owe much in life
to the good influences of this friendship.” His studies were classical,
Latin, Greek, and philosophy, arranged for preparing a boy for the
profession of the law, medicine, or theology, with almost nothing to
foster his love of nature.

In 1825, then eighteen, he left home to complete his education in
Germany. After spending three months at Metzingen, near Stuttgart,
in the study of the German language, he went to Carlsruhe, where he
became an inmate of the family of Mr. Braun, a man of wealth and sci-
entific tastes, the father of the distinguished botanist and philosopher,
Alexander Braun, the discoverer of phyllotaxis—terms of intimacy
with the family on the part of several of his relatives having been of
long standing. The family comprised also a younger son and two
daughters. Agassiz was then a student at Heidelberg along with
young Alexander Braun and Carl Schimper, but he spent his summer
vacations at the Carlsruhe mansion. A vacation soon came. ‘The
arrival of the eldest son of the house,” says Guyot, ‘‘already distin-
guished by scientific publications, with his three university friends—
Agassiz, Schimper, the gifted co-laborer of Braun in the discovery of
phyllotaxis, and Imhoff, of Bale, the future author of one of the best
MEMOIR OF GUYOT 695

Entomological Faunas of Switzerland and Southern Germany—was a
stirring event, which threw new life into the quiet circle. After a
short time devoted to a mutual acquaintance, every one began to work.
The acquisition of knowledge was the rule of the day, and social en-
joyment the sweet condiment to more solid food.” ‘‘My remembrance,”
remarks Guyot, ‘‘of those few months of alternate work and play, at-
tended by so much real progress, are among the most delightful of my
younger days.” ‘Add to these attractions the charm of the society of
a few select and intimate friends, professors, clergymen, and artists,
dropping in almost every¢evening, and you will easily understand how
congenial, how fostering to all noble impulses, must have been the
atmosphere of this family for the young and happy guests assembled
under its hospitable roof.” ‘Months were thus spent in constant and
immediate intercourse with nature, the subjects of investigation chang-
ing with the advancing season. Botany and entomology had their
turn,” and “demonstrations of phyllotaxis,” he says, ‘now reduced to
definite formula by Braun and Schimper, and shown in various plant
forms, but especially in pine-cones, were of absorbing interest., The
whole plan of the present animal kingdom in its relations to the ex-
tinct paleontological forms was the theme of animated discussions.”
He adds, “It would be idle to attempt to determine the measure of
mutual benefit derived by these young students of nature from their
meeting under such favorable circumstances. It certainly was great,
and we need no other proof of the strong impulse they all received from
it than the new ardor with which each pnrsued and subsequently per-
formed his lifework.” *

Guyot took in, equally with Agassiz, the newly developed views in
botany, embryology, and zoological classification that were the subjects
of thought and discussien, and became profoundly HOBTESEES thereby,
as his later work shows.

From Carlsruhe, Guyot went to Suttgart and took the course at the
gymnasium, where he made himself a proficient in the German language.
Returning to NeuchAatel in 1827, and there quickened in his religious
faith and feelings by the preaching of the Rev. Samuel Petit-pierre, his
benevolent impulses, under a sense of duty, led him to turn from science
to theology and commence serious preparation for the ministry. In
1829, then twenty-two years of age, having this purpose still in view,
he went to Berlin to attend the lectures of Schleiermacher, Neander,
and Hengstenberg, and there remained for five years—1830 to 1835.
In order to meet his expenses he accepted the invitation of Herr Miiller,
privy counselor to the King of Prussia, to live with him and give his
children the benefit of conversation in French, The position brought
him into intercourse with the highest of Berlin society, and was in
many ways of great benefit to him.

While pursuing theology in earnest, his hours of recreation found

696 MEMOIR OF GUYOT.

him making collections of the plants and shells of the country, and
otherwise following his scientific leadings. Humboldt introduced him
to the Berlin Botanical Garden, where the plants of the tropics were
a source of special gratification and profit. Moreover, other courses of
lectures attracted him, as those of Hegel, of Steffens, on psychology and
the philosophy of nature, Mitscherlich on chemistry, Hofmann on geology,
Dove on physics and meteorology, and especially those of Carl Ritter,
the eminent geographer, whose philosophical views were full of delight
to his eager mind and touched a sympathetie cord. Under such influ-
ence he found his love for nature-science rapidly gaining possession of
him, and, yielding finally to his mental demands and to his conscience,
which would not permit him to enter the ministry with a divided pur-
pose, he determined to drop theology and make science his chief pursuit.

Ritter, of all his Berlin teachers, made the profoundest impression on
his course of thought; and his biographical sketch of him, presented
to the American Geographical Society in 1860, four years after his death,
exhibits the admiring affection of a pupil who was like Ritter in his
profounder sentiments. A paragraph from the memoir will show the
tenor of Ritter’s geographical teaching and something of the mental
affiliation between them. Guyot says (p. 48):

“Ritter, in the introduction to the ‘Erdkunde,’ declares that the
fundamental idea which underlies all his work, and furnishes him a new
principle for arranging the well digested materials of the science of the
globe, has its deep root in the domain of faith. This idea, he adds,
was derived from an inward intuition, which gradually grew out of his
life in nature and among men. It could not be, beforehand, sharply
defined and limited, but would become fully manifested in the comple-
tion of the edifice itself. That noble edifice is now before us, and, un-
finished though it be, it reveals the plan of the whole and allows us
clearly to perceive that fundamental idea on which it rests. Itisa
strong faith that our globe, like the totality of creation, is a great or-
ganism, the work of an all-wise Divine Intelligence, an admirable struct-
ure, all the parts of which are purposely shaped and arranged and
mutally dependent, and, like organs, fulfill, by the will of the Maker,
specific functions which combine themselves into a common life. But
for Ritter that organism of the globe compries not nature only; it in-
cludes man, and, with man, the moral and intellectual life.” ‘‘ None be-
fore him perceived so clearly the hidden but strong ties which mutually
bind man to nature—those close and fruitful relations between man and
his dwelling place, between a continent and its inhabitants, between a
country and the people which hold it as its share of the continent—
those influences which stamp the races and nations each with a charac-
ter of their own, never to be effaced during the long period of their ex-
istence.” We have here ideas that took, in Guyot, a still larger expan-
sion.

Guyot derived great profit also from the works and the friendship of
MEMOIR OF GUYOT. 697

Humboldt. His address at the Humboldt Commemoration of the
American Geographical Society, in 1859, was a beautiful tribute to this
model student of nature.*

The five years of study at the Berlin University terminated with an
examination which brought him the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.
His graduating thesis, written in Latin, as was then the rule, was on
“The Natural Classification of Lakes.”

To Paris, the Pyrenees, Ttalu, ete., 1835 to 1839.—F rom Berlin, Guyot, in
his twenty-eighth year—June of 1835—went to Paris to take charge of
the education of the sons of Count de Pourtalés-Gorgier, and continued
with the family four vears. Letters of introduction from Humboldt led -
to much intercourse with Brongniart and other savants of the great city.
For the summer he accompanied the family to Eaux Bonnes, in the
Pyrenees. While there he made ascents of the higher peaks and took
excursions in various directions—to the amphitheater of Gavarnie, to
the borders of Spain by the Pont d’Espagne and the pass beyond, to
the valley of the Eaux Chaudes, etc.—in order to study the features
and flora, and compare the mountains in these respects with the Alps.
In the autumn he went with his pupils to Belgium, Holland, and the
Rhine to study the characteristic features of these countries. The fol-
lowing year he visited Pisa, and there, besides enjoying the new scenes,
made various barometrical measurements, determining the elevation of
the observatory at Florence and of other points.

Trip to the glaciers in 1838.—In the spring of 1838 Agassiz found
Guyot still at Paris. During the summer preceding Agassiz had
startled the scientific world by his declarations as to a Universal Gla-
cial Era, contained in a paper read before the Helvetic Society of Nat-
ural Sciences assembled at Neuchatel. His work in 1837—prompted
in 1836 by Charpentier’s discoveries proving the fact of a former epoch
of immense glaciers in Switzerland—had led him to the bold conclu-
sion, and he was full of his new idea when he met his old companion.
He urged Guyot, who hesitated at accepting his views without exami-
nation, to study the facts, and obtained the promise that he would visit
the glaciers that summer.

In his memoir of Agassiz, Guyot states that his six weeks of investi-
gation that season in the Central Alps (nearly two years before Agas-
siz commenced his investigation on the Glacier of the Aar) were fruit- .
ful beyond expectation. He says that from the examination of the
glaciers of the Aar, Rhone, Gries, Brenva, and others, he learned (1)
the law of the moraines; (2) that of the more rapid flow of the center
of the glacier than the sides; (3) that of the more rapid flow of the top
than the bottom; (4) that of the laminated or ribboned structure (‘ blue
bands”); and (5) that of the movement of the glacier by a gradual mo-
lecular displacement, instead of by a sliding of the ice-mass, as held by
de Saussure.

*Journal of the American Geographical Society, October, 1859; vol. 1, p. 242,
698 MEMOIR OF GUYOT.

The facts and conclusions were communicated to the Geological So-
ciety of France at a meeting at Porrentruy, in September, 1838. The
communication is mentioned in the bulletin of the society for that year,*
but no report of it is given because the manuscript remained in his
hands unfinished, in consequence of his protracted illness the winter
following. The portion then finished (which was withheld from publi-
cation because, by special arrangement between them, Agassiz in 1840
entered upon the special study of the glaciers, and Guyot on that of
the Swiss erratic phenomena, for their separate parts of a general] sur-
vey) has recently been printed in volume x1II (1883) of the Bulletin of
. the Neuchatel Society of Natural Sciences. In 1842 this manuscript was
deposited, by motion of Agassiz, in the archives of the Neuchatel So-
ciety, and in 1848 it was withdrawn by Guyot when he left for America.
It is to be regretted that publication was not substituted in 1842 for
burial. Its recent publication was made by the request of Guyot, early |
in 1883, from a certified copy of the original manuscript.

This paper gives the facts on which Guyot based his conclusions,
and since these conclusions comprise some of the most important of
the views now accepted relating to glacial motion and structure, and
antedate the observations of Agassiz, Rendu, and Forbes, they have
special interest.

The fact of a less rapid movement of the bottom ice than the top, owing
to friction, he ascertained by the observation that in glaciers of steep
descent, like the Rhone at its rapids, and the Gries, the transverse
crevasses and the masses they cut off are at first vertical or nearly
so; but below the rapids, where the slope is gentle and the crevas-
ses become mostly closed, the masses are inclined with the pitch up
stream, and this up-stream inclination is reduced at the termination
of the glacier to a few degrees. The crevasses,-although closing
up below, are still traceable. He says the so-called layers are not
Strictly layers; but great numbers of cracks remain, which give to the
mass the appearance of being made up of beds several yards thick,
as may be seen in the glaciers of the Grindelwald valley, Aar, and
others.

Further: To this pitch in the stratification at the lower extremity,
the beds rising outward, Guyot attributes also the origin of the ma-
jestic ice chambers, whence in most cases flow great streams, as that
of the Rhone, of the Arveyron at the foot of the Mer de Glace, of the
Liitschinen from the glaciers of Grindelwald.

The more rapid movement of the center than the sides also was learned
from the Rhone glacier and others of steep descent. The crevasses,
at first transverse, were found to be arched in front below the rapids,
and increasingly arched to the extremity, and the successive crevasse-
lines were very nearly concentric with the semicircular outline of

the extremity of the glacier. He gives a figure of the Rhone glacier
as seen from the Maienwand in illustration, and other later glacial-
ists have appealed to the same evidence of lateral friction.

The semicircular outline of the terminal moraine was found to be
another result of the cause just mentioned; and so also the ‘“ even-
tail” arrangement of the several moraines immediately above the ter-
mination. The greater height and breadth of the central moraine is
made a consequence of the greater velocity of the ice at the middle
of the upper surface, more transportation taking place consequently in
a given time.

Again: The conclusion that the movement of the glacier was largely
through molecular displacement was supported by his observation that
the ice, instead of breaking up and rising into an accumulation of
masses on its passage by an isolated rock, or rocky islet, in its course,
spread around and enveloped it without fracturing; and he refers to
a fine example of this at the two isolated islets of rock in the midst
of the great Brenva glacier, called the “eyes of the glacier.” The
same thing is observed “at the Jardin du Taléfre, a true islet in the
midst of a mer de glace, having a border of blocks of rock, or of a
moraine, cast upon its sides by the march of the glacier, just like the
coast dunes of an island in the ocean.”

In view of such facts, Guyot observes: “If itis true that the differ-
ent parts of a glacier move with different velocities; if the glacier
adapts itself to the form of a valley and fills all depressions without
ceasing to be continuous; if it can bend around an obstacle and closely
inclose it without the fracturing of its mass, like a spreading liquid,
we may affirm that the movements take place through a molecular dis-
placement, and we must abandon, at least as the only cause, the idea
of a slow sliding of the mass upon itself as incompatible with the phe-
nomena presented.”*

The “ blue bands” of the glacier were first described by Guyot. He
called the structure stratification, and observed it in the ice of the sum-
mit of the glacier of Gries, at a height of about 7,500 feet. A peculiar
furrowing of the surface of the ice, the furrows 1 or 2 inches broad, at-
tracted his attention; and this result of weathering he found to have
come from the unequal firmness of the layers constituting it, layers of
a softer “ snowy ice” alternating with those of firm bluish glassy ice.
The stratification was found by him to extend over hundreds of square
meters, and downward, on the sides of crevasses, 20 to 30 feet deep, or
as far down as the eye could penetrate; and it was evident that “ the
layers of the two sides of a crevasse were once continuous, like the

*In French his words of 1838 are: ‘‘On peut affirmer que ces monvements ne
peuvent avoir lieu qu’en vertu d’un déplacement moléculaire, et il faut abandonner,
au moins comme cause unique, lVidée dun glissement lent de la masse sur elle-
méme, comme incompatible avec les phénoménes que présente la marche des gla-
ciers.”
700 MEMOIR OF GUYOT.

strata of the opposite sides of a tranverse valley.” He compared the
stratification to that of certain coarsely schistose limestones.*

He remarks, in conclusion: ‘‘We should say that the layers were —

not annual layers, but rather a series made day by day from small suec-
cessive snow-falls that were melted in part by the sun of the day, and
covered each night by the thick frost-glazing which envelops all the
snowy summits of the high Alps.”t

He further observes that ‘these beds were evidently formed at a
greater height and in a different position from that where observed.”
He adds, in closing his remarks on the subject: ‘ Do the beds, at first
horizontal, or at least parallel to the surface of the glacier, accomplish,
during its movement, evolutions, as yet imperfectly understood, analo-
gous to those before mentioned [that is, those occasioned by differences
in velocity of the middle, sides, and bottom, owing to unequal friction].
This is a point which should have further examination, with observa-
tions as minute, numerons, and universal as possible. Unfortunately a
thick fog and threatening weather forced me to stop work before I had
ascertained whether this structure was general for the whole mass of
the glacier at that altitude, or whether restricted to that locality not-
withstanding the proof of so large an extension of it.”

Guyot had some confidence in his conelusions, but he also felt, as he
states, the importance of more detailed investigation in order to decide
on their real value.

On the 1st of December, 1841, Guyot communicated the results of his
observations of 1838, so far as relates to the “ blue bands,” ata meeting
of the Neuchatel Society of Natural Sciences, “reading some passages
from his note written in 1838.” This communication contains the addi-
tional fact that the layers of the stratification in the Gries glacier were
inclined about 45 degrees, were nearly transverse to the principal gla-
cier, and appeared also to have sinuosities due to lateral compression.t

Agassiz, in his Systeme Glaciare (1847), cites from Guyot’s manu-
script (then deposited with the Neuchatel Society) the part relating to
the “ blue bands” (the only part he ever cited), and in this citation there
is a paragraph on the inclination or pitch of the layers, with Guyot’s
additional suggestion that the pitch of the layers looked as if a result

* His words are: ‘‘Stratifié a la fagon de certains calcaires grossiérement schis-
teux,” and he explains it himself as implying a lamellar structure.

tIn the original, the words are: ‘‘On aurait dit, non pas des couches annuelles,
mais une série de couches plut6t journaliéres de neige tombée successivement par
petites quantités, puis fondue en partie par le soleil de la journée, et couverte chaque
nuit de cet épais verglas qui, au-dessus de la région des glaces, recouvre toutes les
sommités neigeuses des hautes Alpes.”

} The report of the meeting of the Neuch&tel Society is contained in the Verhand-
lungen of the ‘‘ Schweiz. Nat. Gesellschaft,” Altdorf, 1842. The abstract of Guyot’s
communication there given (pp. 199-200) says: ‘‘La position de ces couches etait in-
elinée d’environ 45° dans le sens de la pente générale du glacier. Leur direction sem-
blait presque transversale 4 celle du glacier principal, mais longitudinale a celle de
son penchant méridional. Elle présentait quelquefois des sinuosités qui semblaient
un effet de compression laterale.”

of the advance of the surface portion over that below, a point already
explained by him [by reference to friction at bottom].*

Guyot opens his account of the blue bands with the remark that, as
he had seen them only on one occasion, he dares not hazard an explana-
tion; but his later sentences show that he was inclined to regard them
as a result of deposition. and to consider the varying inclinations in the
layers as due to subsequent disturbing action—that is, to the irregu-
larities of glacier movement, caused by friction and pressure under the
varying conditions of the glacier valley as to form and size.

Whether right or wrong m these suggestions as to the bands, Guyot’s
six weeks’ work in the summer of 1838 was indeed fruitful. He had the
satisfaction of seeing his conclusions for the most part confirmed by the
faets collected by Agassiz, Forbes, and others, but not of receiving
credit for his work and original conclusions, except on one point, and
chiefly because of the want of proper publication.t

*The cited paragraph in the Systeme Glaciaire (p. 209) is as follows: ‘‘ La direction
de ces coaches coupait & angle droit la ligne de marche (de pente) du glacier, leur
inclination déviait de 30° a 40° de la perpendiculaire vers la partie inférieure, comme
si la pente superficielle gagnait de l’avance sur la partie inférieure ainsi que je lai
décrit plus haut.” The writer learns from Mrs. Arnold Guyot that this paragraph is
a part of the original manuscript, and that it was by oversight that it was not sent
to the Neuchatel Society in 1883 with the rest.

+ Rendu’s ‘‘ Théorie des Glaciers de la Savoie” was published in 1841 (Mem. Soc.
Roy. Savoie, Chambéry, vol. x). Forbes’s first letter from the Alps, announcing his
discovery in August, 1841, of the ‘‘ blue bands” in the Aar Glacier, was communicated
to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, December 6, 1841, and published in January in
Jameson’s N. Phil. J., vol. xxxu, 1242. Agassiz’s first work on glaciers, ‘‘ Etudes
sur les Glaciers,” was published in 1840. Neither of these publications mentioned
Guyot or his observations.

Guyot’s communication of 1841, published in the Altdorf Verhandlungen, was
drawn out by a discussion between Forbes and Agassiz relating to priority as to ob-
servations on the blue bands, and it was made just five days before Forbes’s first letter
was read in Edinburgh. Agassiz claimed credit for Guyot at the meeting in 1841, as
aset-off against Forbes’s claim, and again, in the N, Phil. Journ., XXXII, 265, 1842.
Forbes, in the following volume of that journal, xxx1v, 145, 1843, gives Guyot credit
for original discovery as regards the ‘‘ blue bands,” and speaks of his corresponding
with him on the subject; and he repeats the acknowledgement to the “ingenious
professor of Neuchatel,” in his Travels through the Alps of Savoy, 1843 (first edition)
and 1845 (second edition), page 28. Desor, in the same jourpal, xxxvV, 308, 1843, ina
paper on Agassiz’s recent glacier researches, introduces a translation of Guyot’s ac-
count of the banded structure, but cuts it short at the words, ‘‘opposite sides of a
transverse valley,” leaving off the explanatory remarks which follow.

Tyndall, in his ‘‘ Forms of Water” (1872, page 183), gives Guyot credit for pri-
ority ; and he cites, both in this work and in his earlier ‘‘ Glaciers of the Alps” (1856),
a trauslation of Guyot’s account, ending it a sentence short of Desor’s citation, with
the words, “certain calcareous slates” in place of Guyot’s ‘‘ certain schistose lime-
stones” ; and on page 187 of “‘ The Forms of Water,” knowing only a part of what Guyot
had written, he does him more than justice (admitting Tyndall’s view to be estab-
lished) in saying that he ‘“‘ threw out an exceedingly sagacious hint when he compared
the veined structure to the cleavage of slate rocks,” for the comparison in Guyot’s
paper implies rather stratification from deposition.

702 MEMOIR OF GUYOT.

Having attended at Berlin the lectures of Dove on physics and
meteorology and those of Ritter on physical geography, Guyot knew
when he went to the mountains what to look for in case the glaciers
were great flowing streams of ice, as had often been supposed ; he knew
that the flow of a stream is retarded along the sides and bottom by frie-
tion, and he naturally looked also for something in the encounter of the
glacier with rocks answering to molecular displacement. Hence, in his
six weeks of observations on the glaciers, he reached, without waste of
time, good conclusions—the conclusions of a physical geographer. His
investigation did not enable him to appreciate the interior fracturing
that works along with molecular displacement in the flow of the ice,
but his conclusion was still far in the right direction and decisive
against the hypothesis he opposed. That he did not continue his study
of the glaciers to thoroughly established results was owing to his yield-
ing the subject afterward to Agassiz. Fidelity to his friend and his
volunteered agreement curbed in and silenced him ; and so his paper,
excepting the paragraphs on the “ blue bands,” remained buried until
after A gassiz’s decease.

At Neuchatel, Professor in the Academy, 1839 to 1848.—In 1839, at the
age of thirty-two, Guyot left Paris and returned to his native town.
He became at once an active member of the Society of the Natural
Sciences (which had been initiated by Agassiz in 1332), and was made
by the Society one of a committee—including also M. d’ Osterwald, and
H. Ladame—for the organization of asystem of meteorological observa-
tions in Switzerland and the selection of the best instruments for the
purpose. On the establishment of the ‘Academy ” at Neuchatel, for
the purpose of furnishing a university education to the graduates of the
college or gymnasium, he was appointed to the chair of history and
physical geography, and became a colleague of Agassiz. He hesitated
about taking charge of the department of history, as this had not been
one of his special lines of study ; yet, once committed to it, he plunged
into the subject with great earnestness. He says he groped on among
the details for two years before he began to distinguish its grand pe-
riods, and the light as it broke in upon him caused so intense excitement
that he was made ill.

Instruction was a great pleasure to him, because of his deep interest
both in his subject and in his pupils. His two departments called out
from him thirteen general and special courses of lectures. With re-
gard to the lectures, Mr. Faure says: “From the first, in spite of his
apprehensions, he captivated his audience by his easy, elegant, sympa-
thetic words, by the breadth of his views, and the abundance and happy
arrangement of his facts. He had, each winter afterward, the pleasure

position, and origin appears to have been made by Prof. Henry D. Rogers at the Cam-
bridge meeting of the American Association in 1849 (Proc. Am. Assoc., 1, 181). But
Rogers attributed the structure in both to conditions of temperature and not, like
Tyndall, to pressure.
MEMOIR OF GUYOT. 703

of seeing men of cultivation of all classes in Neuchatel pressing into
the large hall of the college and listening to him with riveted attention.”
His pupil adds: “ What zeal he inspired! what ardor for work! The
fire with which he was filled passed to us. He was more than a pro-
fessor; he was a devoted friend, a wise counselor, associating himself
with us and encouraging us in our work.”

Guyot, besides lecturing and instructing, did all he could of outside
work—meteorological, barometric, hydrographic, orographic, and
glacialistic. The hydrographic work was the careful sounding of Lake
Neuchatel (in all eleven hundred soundings) as the commencement of
a study of the annual variation in the temperature of the waters of the
Swiss lakes. His chief research—that on the distribution of the bowl-
ders or erratics over Switzerland—oceupied him, “single-handed, seven
laborious summers, from 1840 to 1847,” he allowing himself only, “at the
end of his working season, the pleasure of a visit of a few days to the
lively band of friends established on the Glacier of the Aar, in order to
learn the results of their doings and communicate his own to them.”*
Switzerland in the ice period was his subject; and the sources of the
bowlders and the courses of ice transportation were the chief inquiries.
The investigation involved excursions on foot and careful examination
of the whole range of the Swiss Alps, the slopes into Italy, the plains
of Switzerland, and the mountains on the northern and western borders,
including the Juras—in all an area of 190 by 310 miles—in order to
trace the erratics to their high sources among the snowy summits, ex-
amine the rocks of all peaks, ridges, and valleys for comparison with
those of the erratics, measure the heights along the lines and limits of
the erratics from plain to mountain peak, and note all glacial markings.
The task was accomplished with the greatest possible fidelity ; “ thou-
sands of barometric measurements” were made in the course of it, and
between five and six thousand specimens were gathered in duplicate.

Thus, says Guyot, “ Hight erratic basins were recognized on the
northern slope of the Alps—those of the Isére, the Arve, Rhone, Aar,
Reuss, Limmat, Sentis, and Rhine; and four on the southern slope—
that of the Adda, including Lake Como, of Lugano, of Ticino, including
L. Maggiore, and that of the Val d’Aosta.

‘‘ Moreover, a question left hitherto untouched—the distribution in
each basin of the rocks special to it—was minutely examined, and the
final results of all the laws observed in the arrangement of the erratic
fragments were shown to be identical with the laws of the moraines.
This identity, and the absolute continuity of the erratic phenomena
from the heart of the Alps down the valleys and beyond to the Jura
left no alternative but to admit the ancient existence of mighty glaciers
as vast as the erratic regions themselves, and having a thickness of
over 2,000 feet.”

Brief notes on his work were published in the Bulletin of the Neuchatel

1845, and January, 1547.*

Guyot reserved the complete report for the second volume of Agas-
siz’s great work on glaciers. But, unfortunately, after the first volume
by Agassiz appeared at Paris, ip 1847, there came the revolution of
1848, which put an end to their plans.

The study of the geological structure of the Jura Mountains, in
which he worked out the system in the flexures of the strata and proved
that it must have been produced by lateral pressure, was another of
Guyot’s labors soon after his return from Neuchatel, although not re-
ported on until 1849, at the Cambridge meeting of the American Asso-
ciation.t

Guyot had been teaching at Neuchatel nine years when suddenly the
“Academy” was suppressed by the grand revolutionary council of
Geneva of 1848. The 13th of June brought the tidings, and on the
30th the end came “without any indemnity to the professors.” Letters
from Agassiz urged him to come to America. Though reluctant to take
the step because of the many ties of friendship and association that
bound him to Switzerland, and especially on account of the family
under his charge, consisting of bis mother, then seventy years old,
and two sisters, which he should have to leave behind, he had the de-
cision of his mother, after her careful reading of Agassiz’s letter, in favor
of it,t and in the following August he left friends, home, and Europe.

In America.—The Lowell Lectures at Boston—“ Earth and Man”~—
1848, 1849.—Without English speech, with no plans ahead, and with
more than forty years of his life behind, a crowd of apprehensions con-
tinued to haunt Guyot until he reached the American shores. Once
landed in New York, he was soon after at Cambridge with his friend
Agassiz; and from that time the calamity that had befallen him, com-
menced to prove itself a blessing. It was for him, falling in with the
‘‘ geographical march of history,” and coming to the land and “ people
of the future,” where no political or religious shackles were in the way
of success, and where an audience as wide as the continent was ready
for whatever he had to communicate.

In September, a fortnight after his arrival, Agassiz took Guyot to the
meeting of the American Association at Philadelphia. At its close he
made his first journey to the Alleghanies, spending a week in crossing

t August 8th, 1848, the day of his departure from Neuchatel, he writes: ‘Ma
mére a été toujours si forte et si confiante qu’elle m’a soutenu jusqu’au dernier mo-
ment, mais son dernier sanglot, en me quittant, m’est allé au c@ur: Oh! que Dieu
me donne de la revoir et d’embellir ses derniers jours.” This desire was realized. In
the autumn of 1849 he had the happiness of welcoming his mother, two sisters, and
a niece to the new home which he had prepared for them in Cambridge.

the region in Pennsylvania to Bedford and Cumberland. On his re-
turn he stopped in Princeton to deliver a letter of introduction to Dr.
Charles Hodge, and found there friends who later welcomed him as a
colleague.

Returning to Cambridge, he was soon afterward invited by Mr. Low-
ell to deliver one of the winter courses of lectures at the Lowell Insti-
tute, and in January he resumed in Boston his academic work, taking
for his subject Comparative Physical Geography. He spoke in French,
almost without notes, to a large and appreciative audience, and from
that time the Swiss professor had an American reputation. These lect-
ures, written out after the delivery of each, were translated by Pro-
fessor Felton “with rare kindness and a disinterestedness still more
rare,” says Guyot,* and published under the title—now familiar—of
“‘ Karth and Man.”

The views of Ritter, which had put life and humanity into geography,
are used by the author as the basis of still wider generalizations bearing
on the earth and human history. Guyot first draws out in admirable
Style the distinctive physiographic features ot the continents and seas,
and then proceeds to consider the physiology of the continental forms,
by which he meant the interactions of the continents in their own his-
tory, and in that of man as their tenant. Having finished the physio-
graphic portraiture in the first seventy pages, he says: ‘ We must
now see these great organs in operation; we must see them in life,
acting and reacting upon each other,” that is, “their physiological
phenomena.”

In order to exhibit the “living” action between these “organs” in
its true relations, he first explains the fundamental law of progress in
all growth or development; then exhibits the application of the law to
the earth in its genesis, and in its later progress through the ages, and
finally draws out and puts into order the grander facts in the conditions
of the earth connected with the development of man in his social, polit-
ica], and moral relations. -

Guyot makes all historical progress a development, carried forward
through the incessant action and reaction of differences or unlike con-
ditions; he speaks of it as a gradual specialization of parts and fune-
tions, comparable to the progress in germ development and having the
same general formula; as beginning in a homogeneous unit, which has
real but unmarked differences of parts, advancing through various
changes and individualizations, and ending in the complex “ harmonic
unit.” He finds the law exemplified in the development of the earth
after the nebular theory of La Place; in the slow progress of the earth’s
continents from the condition of scattered islands in a large, shallow
sea to that of united distinctively featured lands; in the progress of
the earth’s life, as made known by geology; the progress in the devel-
opment of the races of men, and in the origin of human societies.

706 MEMOIR OF GUYOT.

The three phases recognized in the process are that of undistinguishable
parts, germ-like; that of diversification; that of unity, which “allows
all differences, all individualities, to exist, but co-ordinates and subjects
them to a superior aim.” Further, the final product or “ harmonic
unit,” be it an organic species, or a continent, or societies, or whatever
condition, has its purpose fulfilled not in existing, but in preparing for
and producing other development beyond.

As differentiation goes forward increasing differences, inter-actions
become more energetic. The greater the variety of individualities and
relations in a society of individuals the greater also is the sum of life,
the more universal, more complete, and more elevated the develop-
ment.

Further, besides the unfolding of life “in all its richness of kinds
and forms by diversity, there is involved an exhibition of it in its util-
ity, in its beauty, in its goodness, by harmony; and this also for the
entire globe, collectively considered as a single individual.” ‘This last
point was the special subject of the larger part of his lectures.

Here was development for all history. All was put under one
formula, that which is expressed in embryonic development, and was
illustrated by details sustaining the application of the law.

With regard to the geological succession of life, he had learned,
from Agassiz’s announcements in his *‘ Poissons Fossiles” (the first
volume, published in 1834), that the geological succession in species
was analogous in many respects to embryonic succession,* and he had
gathered other ideas from the philosophical thoughts of Goethe and
Steffens, as well as Ritter; but in his special application of the prinei-
ple to the earth’s early and later history, and to human progress, he
went beyond his teachers.

In reply to an inquiry as to the originality of his views, he wrote me,
December 6, 1856, as follows:

“The putida at the basis of development is at the bottom of all
the modern philosophy of Germany, especially the philosophy of nature,
but in what an abstract and indigestible form will be seen on opening
any one of their uninviting volumes. Goethe, the poet and philoso-
pher, has, in a more concrete and tangible form, the beautiful law that
the more homogeneous, the lower the organism, and the more diversi-
fied in its parts, the higher the grade. Steffens, of Berlin, acted more
directly on my mind, and from him I got a distinct view of the impor-
tance of the internal contrasts and differences as regards the process
of life” - - - ‘All these notions of the law were taken, as was
natural, from the organized being; I do not recollect to have seen it
danni as I have applied it, to inorganic nature; to astronomy; to
geology—I mean to the growth of continents, and to the successive
and increasing diversifications’ of the surface keeping pace with the
wants of an increasing development of life; to physical geography, in

eee eee

MEMOIR OF GUYOT. 707

which the law of internal contrasts, as conditions of a more active life,
plays so great a part. Hence the whole scheme of that part of earth
and man. This law thus became for me the key for the appreciation
and understanding and grouping of an immense number of phenomena
both in nature and history. My views of the human races and of uni-
versal history are, in great part, on the same base. So also the idea of
the true sense of the first chapter of Genesis as a characteristic of the
great organic epochs.”

His recognition of the same principle in organic nature is expressed
as follows in a letter of March 17, 1856, referring in the first paragraph
to the view ot Agassiz that the sub-kingdoms among animals and the
grander divisions among plants represent so many plans of structure:

“ But do we not too much forget that even structure is but a means—
the expression of a mode or function of life, which mode or function is
the idea of it, and in one sense its cause? If so, then structures only
express various aspects and functions of life, animal or vegetable, and
they are related and connected together as the various aspects, modes,
and functions of organic life are with the essential idea of life itself.

‘“* Now, life is essentially (I mean phenomenally) growth, develop-
ment, movement from phase to phase, from birth to death, and it seems
to me that I can find no principle which gives me a more clear, natural,
and connected idea of the innumerable types and forms of vegetables
aud animals than to consider them as typical of so many phases of life,
whether of growth, or mode of life, or function of life.”

Guyot endeavored to find the expression of the formula of develop-
ment in the details of the systems of life, animal and vegetable, as ex-
hibited in the progressive life of the globe as well as the existing
species; and the preceding sentences in his letters were introductory
to further explanations with regard to this system. His philosophical
ideas were broad and deep enough to embrace the results of all dis-
covery, although his illustrations manifested something of the limited
knowledge of species and groups of thirty years since.

In 1862 he delivered a course of lectures at the Smithsonian Institu-
tion on this subject, or “The Unity of Plan in the Systems of Life, as
exhibited in the Characteristic Ideas and Mutual Relations of the great
groups of the Vegetable and Animal Kingdoms;” but, although publi-
cation was desired by the Institution and urged by others, the manu-
script was never ready. Full stenographic reports were made, which
he never found time to revise.

It is interesting to note, in both Agassiz and Guyot, this full faith in
a system of development as the best and truest expression of the order
of succession in the progress of life, and, in Guyot, the application of the
principle to all progress, while, at the same time, neither doubted the
constancy of species or the necessity of divine acts for originating spe-
cies and carrying forward the development. Agassiz declares, in his
‘¢ Poissons Fossiles :” ‘* More than fifteen hundred species of fossil fishes
708 MEMOIR OF GUYOT.

with which I have become acquainted, say to me that the species do not
pass gradually from one to the other, but appear and disappear sud-
denly, without direct relations with their predecessors.” To each the
system of progress was as orderly a system as that which evolutionists
now recognize. The successional relations made known by paleontology
were welcomed for the same reason as now—because they illustrated
the true system of progress. The difference was not as to these rela-
tions, or the system of progress, but as to the means of carrying for-
ward the development.

Guyot also gives a brief explanation of his views with regard to the
Geographical March of Human History, and this is all he ever published
of his historical course. In the expression “ geographical march” he
refers to the fact that human progress took place not by gradual eleva-
tion at one center of civilization, but by successive transfers from one
nation or center to another. He points out and illustrates three stages
in the progress:

First. The stage characteristic of the old Onent—that of subjection ;
Subjection not only to the despotism of rulers and of society through
castes, but also to that of nature’s forces through fear and superstition,
and to the despotism of priests, exerted over both people and rulers
through the superstitious element, and to priests and rulers conjoined,
making the subjection complete. It was ‘‘ the subjection of human lib-
erty to the yoke of nature,” “to the immutable, blind laws of necessity,
which regulate the courses of the celestial bodies and the life of nature ;”
to the ‘inflexible, unloving, inexorable gods of the early East.”

Secondly. The stage of growth in individual freedom, worked out in
and characterizing Greece—a land “ neighboring still the East,” but ad- *
mirably organized by its very features, by the combination within it of
all the contrasts of the continent for the development of individuality ;
a free people full of the energy of youth and the conscious strength of
freemen, converting ‘the world of nature” into “that of the human
soul,” where “ all the riches of poetry, of intellect, of reason, which are
the heritage of the human mind, display themselves without obstacle
and expand in the sun of liberty”; where “religion is a deification of
the faculties and affections of man”; where “ the forces of nature, the
trees of the forests, the mountains, the springs, and the rivers appear
as objects of worship,” ‘under the form of gods, of goddesses, and of
nymphs, endowed with all the affections and subject to all the weak-
nesses of common mortals.”

But, he says, the Empire of Alexander, and of individuality, and of
fratricidal wars was not for the future. The Greek principle wanted
the addition of association, ‘‘a principle determined by nature and not
by voluntary agreement.”

Thirdly. The third stage was that of Rome, its center a little farther
toward the west, which, through the spirit of association, became the great
empire and law-giver for the world. But selfish and corrupt, ‘“ one-half
MEMOIR OF GUYOT. 709

of the men slaves to the other half,” “‘ exacting only one worship, that
of the emperor, who personifies the state,” the Roman world, an aggre-
gate of nations without a common faith, “ perishes, like the rest, of its
own vices.”

At that time, when tke principle of association under human enact-
ments was proving itself a failure, and despair was settling over the
people, then, says Guyot, “‘ the meek form of the Saviour appeared upon
the scene of the world,” to “recall man to the only living God,” and
“proclaim the equal worth of every buman soul,” “the unity and
brotherhood of human kind.” ‘It was upon this new basis that hu-
manity, recommencing its task, goes on to build a new edifice.” The
task was not committed to the corrupt Roman; the Roman Empire
broke before the Germans from the North, and the center of civilization
passed to the north of the Alps, and soon embraced all Europe. The ~
new influences tended to harmonize the conflicting nationalities and
bring about finally ‘* a family of states so closely bound together that
they are only members of the same body.” And while liberty was thus
gained for man, nature, as never before, opens herself to him and be-
comes his aid in all progress. Not only Europe, but, through her peo-
ple, all the world receives the new light and commences to participate
in the new progress.

But Europe and all the old nations, “ through historical ties of every
kind, ancient customs, acquired rights,” encounter almost insurmounta-
ble difficulties in the way of adaptation to the exigencies of a new prin-
ciple—that of “liberty, equality, and fraternity ” rightly interpreted ;
and the carrying out of this work to reality demanded for its full devel-
opment, as the law of history shows, that it should be transferred “ to
a new people ;” transferred, as ‘‘ the geographical march of civilization
tells us, to a new continent west of the Old World—to America ”—a
land wonderfully adapted to this purpose by the simplicity and unity
of its features, by its great plains and rivers, and by its commanding
position between the oceans.

He says, in conclusion, referring to the historic nations: ‘Asia,
Europe, and North America are the three grand stages of humanity in
its march through the ages. Asia is the cradle where man passed -his
infancy under the authority of law, and where he learned his depend-
ence upon a sovereign master. Europe is the school where his youth
was trained; where he waxed in strength and knowledge, grew to man-
hood, and learned at once his liberty and his moral responsibility.
America is the theater of his activity during the period of manbood,
the land where he applies and practices all he has learned, brings into
action all the forces he has acquired, and where he is still to learn that
the entire development of his being and of his own happiness are only
possible by willing obedience to the laws of his Maker.”

When Carl Ritter received a copy of the work ‘ Earth and Man”
from his old pupil, he sent Guyot a letter of congratulations, with the

strongly underscored word, excellent, thrice repeated; and more than
once he wrote him that the whole conception earried out in the volume
was a marked progress. He also told Guyot that he had made the
volume his vade mecum on a long summer journey.

The work has passed through several editions in Great Britain, and
has been translated into German and Swedish; and a translation into
French, by Mr. Faure, will be published this year in Paris.

Guyot’s views put the earth’s genesis or development, as a sentence
cited from him shows, under his general formula for historical progress;
and although the subject is not dwelt upon in his Earth and Man, a
brief statement of his argument and conclusions is, therefore, in place
here.

The subject came under his consideration at Neuchatel, in 1840, while
preparing a lecture for his course in Physical Geography. Looking
only to the suggestions of science, under which the so-called nebular
theory had in his mind a place, he made out a scheme of the successive
stages in the earth’s development. After its completion it “ flashed ”
upon him that the succession arrived at was just that of the cosmogonic.
record in Genesis, and this led later to a critical comparison of the two.
Harmonizing the Bible and science was, hence, far from his original
purpose.

The succession in the scheme so derived was (as I learned it from
him) as follows:

(1) The endowing of matter and space with forces, whence the begin-
ning of its activity.

(2) The stage of specialization, or that of the subdividing of the origi-
nal matter or nebula through the forces communicated, and thus the
development of systems of spheres in space.

(3) The stage of the individualized worlds—the earth among them—
and the commencing preparation of the earth for new bg
pertaining to organic nature.

- The events thus far are those of the inorganic part of the cosmogony.

In the organic period there was:

(1) Life, manifested in the simpler kinds of plants. Next, animal or
sentient life under simple forms—the Protozoans. These simple kinds
of plants and animals represented the first or germ-like or homogeneous
stage in the development of the system of life. He believed it to be
probable that both existed before the close of Archean time.

(2) The stage of specialization, or that of the development of plants
and animals of higher and higher grade, under various types or sub-
divisions, based severally on different structural and physiological
qualities.

(3) The stage of the synthetie or harmonic type. Among plants, that
of the Dicotyledons, in which the different kinds of tissues in plants,
and the stem, leaf, and flowers are for the first time harmoniously com-
bined; and among animals, that of the vertebrates, in which the ner-
MEMOIR OF GUYOT. 711

vous system has first its proper commanding position; and, lastly,
among mammals, that of man, eminently the “ harmonic unit” for the
system of life, combining the highest of structural qualities and phys-
iological characteristics under the most perfect harmonious development.

It is not surprising that after the conception of such a scheme he
should have recognized a relation in it to the record in Genesis. Look-
ing to this record, which announces, the grand stages in a few brief
sentences, he observed that the “fiat” of the first day, “Let light be,”
indicated, since light is a result of molecular action, the imparting of
activity to matter as the first step in the development of the universe ;
that the dividing of the waters on the second day appeared to have its
only befitting explanation in the subdividing or specialization of the
primal nebula, as stated above; and that the fiat ‘Let the dry land
appear,” on the third day, indicated the defining of the earth and the
preparation of it by the appearance of dry land for its new work. Thus
he found the first three works in Genesis to correspond essentially with
the first three in the scheme taught him by science. The following
works, the creation (a) of plants, (b) of the invertebrates and inferior
vertebrates, (c) of mammals—the remaining vertebrates, (d) of man, have
in the record the order of their first appearance as made known by
science. It has to be admitted that doubt at present exists as to the
earliest birds having preceded the marsupial mammals, but none as to
their long preceding ordinary mammals. Future discovery may place
them before the marsupials. Remains of birds are the rarest of fossi]
veterbrates.

Guyot recognized also a still deeper concordance between Genesis
and science, namely, that not only in the opening verses, but through-
out the chapter, the idea of a system of development is taught. The
fiat “ Let light be” was the commencement of developments before the
earth or other spheres had existence, not the creation of an entity,
With regard to the earth, the first verse announces that it was formless,
empty, waste, or, as the Septuagint translation describes it, “ uncom-
posed and invisible.” Then, on the third day, where the second men-
tion comes in, the words are not Let the earth be, but “‘ Let the dry land
appear,” implying that the specializing changes had gone forward
eventuating in the earth and making it ready for further developments.
The fiat creating plants was not Let plants be, but *‘ Let the earth bring
forth,” which words imply development in some way; and a similar
idea is to be derived from the fiats “‘ Let the waters bring forth” for the
invertebrates and lower vertebrates on the fifth day, and “ Let the earth
bring forth ” for mammals on the sixth day.

Such a system of developments, which, after an initiating fiat, con-
tinued on their progress through the ages following, was not consistent
with the idea that the days of Genesis were definite periods of time.
It teaches that they simply mark the beginnings of new phases or new
grand stages in the history of creation.
712 MEMOIR OF GUYOT.

Guyot’s critical eye further discovered that the two triads of days in
the record—the first, the inorganic, including days one to three, the sec-
ond, the organic, days four to six—have three parallel features which
emphasize strongly this subdivision of the chapter, and indicate paral-
lel stages in the developments: first, in each triad, the work of the first
day was light; second, in each, the work of the last day comprised two
great works; third, the second work of the last day in each triad was
the introduction of an element that was to have its full development in
the following era; in the first triad this element was life, plants being
the second work and lite having its chief display in the succeeding era;
in the second triad it was spiritual life, that of man, a planting of the
moral world in the material, for the exaltation of the latter in aim and
character.

Guyot thus shows that the old document is philosophical in its ar-
rangement, true to the principles of development in history, and essen-
tially true in the order of its announcements, and that the best explana-
tion which science is now able to give on the great subject of cosmogony
is also that which best explains, in all its details, the first chapter of
Genesis and does it justice.

I have said that Guyot, while adopting the law of development and
applying it to all history, still believed that true species came into ex-
istence only by divine act. In his later years, as his work on “ Crea-
tion” shows, he was led to accept, though with some reservation, the
doctrine of evolution through natural causes. He excepted man, and
also the first of animal life; for in the case of both, while science speaks
undecidedly, the record in Genesis teaches, by the use of bara for create
and by not using the word elsewhere subsequent to the first verse in
the chapter, that actuai creation was intended. Healso held that there
might be other exceptions; and he objected, moreover, on other grounds
to the development of man through nature alone. Still, as always with
Guyot, God’s will was the working force of nature, and secondary causes
simply expressions of it.

Guyot’s views on Genesis, although dating from 1810, and presented
by him since that time in occasional courses of lectures, were not pub-
lished in detail until the last year and hours of his life. With the pub-
lication of the volume his work and life ended.*

Educational Work—1849 to 1584.—I pass now.to Guyot’s work in
America. His lectures at Boston were ‘a brief epitome of his teach-
ing in Neuchatel,” and they were, therefore, a part of European Guyot.
He now becomes, though European in equipment, an American in his
labors.

most elevated kind. From Agassiz’s home at Cambridge his acquaint-
ance extended rapidly, and he was soon known also as a man of prac-
tical ideas with regard to school instruction in geography and in other
subjects. It was at once accepted from him that the starting point in
geographical education should be nature and not books; that teachers
should take their pupils to the hills and show them the valleys and
streams and mountains, and aid them in tracing out the general feat-
ures, so that they might make themselves geographers of the region
about them and lay a foundation for broader geographical study; that
the study of the geography of nature should precede that of man and po-
litical geography ; that maps showing in strong lines the reliefs, or the
mountains and plains, and then those showing the river systems and
other natural features, should come before thoseof Statesandtowns. The
idea commended itself that each country should be presented to the
mind of the pupil by such groupings of prominent features, inanimate
and animate, as would, so far as possible, re-produce the reality of
nature; and that waters, lands, and climates should not merely be de-
scribed, but also displayed in their mutual inter-actions and relations,
and in their inter-actions with the living tribes of the waters and land,
that thereby the activities of the earth and their varied consequences
might be understood, and also the influences thence arising that bear
on man and human history.

These views he had learned from his teacher, Cari Ritter, and the
latter in part directly from Pestalozzi. They were so obviously good
that they spread rapidly. Guyot was soon under appointment from the
Massachusetts board of education, lecturing on geography and methods
of instruction to the normal schools and teachers’ institute; and this
engagement took him to all parts of the State and gave him each year,
for the six years he held the position, aggregate audiences of 1,500 to
1,800 teachers. His friend Agassiz, moreover, was associated with him
in the work, giving a like and equally strong impulse to studies in
natural history.

Guyot lived to see his methods of instruction become universal. He
furthered this end by preparing, on his plan, between the years 1861
and 1875, a series of school geographies of different grades, six in num-
ber, ending in a school physical geography, and also a series of wall
maps, physical, political, and classical, thirty in number, all of which
passed into wide use.* These books forced the old books and atlases
to change about or succumb, and they led also to many imitations among
book-makers.

His plan for the completion of the series in a general treatise on
physical geography, unfortunately, was never carried out. His failure
is to be attributed in part to the difficulty he felt in putting his ideas

* Guyot had a valuable aid in map-making in his nephew, Mr. E. Sandoz, who came
‘to America with him, after having previously spent two years at Gotha with the
geographer and publisher, Herr Petermann.
714 MEMOIR OF GUYOT.

down in English. He writes in 1882 to his Swiss friend, M. F. Godet:* —
“ Quene donnerais-je pas pour avoir la facilité d’écrire et de dicter! Mais
cette malheureuse langue, qui n’est pas la mienne, est un obstacle tou-
jours renaissant. La phrase m’entrave et me coiite dix fois plus que les
idées.” _ That Guyot understood the language well is evident from his
memoirs of Ritter and Agassiz, and his tribute to Humboldt, as well as
from his scientific papers. —

Besides the geographical works already mentioned, Guyot was the —
author of the Treatise on Physical Geography in Johnson’s Family
Atlas of the World, and editor, with President Barnard, of Johnson’s
New Universal Encyclopedia, in which are several papers by him on geo-
graphical and other subjects. His school atlases and geographies re-
ceived the medal of progress at the Vienna Exposition in 1873, and the |
gold medal, the highest honor awarded, at Paris in 1878.

In 1854 Guyot received an appointment to the professorship of Phys-
ical Geography and Geology at Princeton, then established for him on
an endowment from one who had learned to admire him as a Christian
philosopher, Mr. Daniel Price, of Newark, New Jersey,} and in 1855 he
removed with his family from Cambridge to Princeton, where he found
his tastes, his social instincts, his desires to impart ideas as well as ac-
quire them, all fully gratified. To the duties of his professorship he
permitted himself to add other educational work, becoming and continu-
ing for several years lecturer on physical geography in the Statenormal
school at Trenton, and from 1861 to 1866 lecturer extraordinary in the
Princeton Theological Seminary, on the Connection of Revealed Re-
ligion and Physical and Ethnological Science, and also giving courses
of lectures for a time in the Union Theological Seminary, New York,
and in connection with a university course in Columbia College, New
York. At the Smithsonian Institution he delivered a course of five
lectures in 1853 on the Harmonies of Nature and History, and in 1862
six lectures on the Unity of Plan in the System of Life, as previously
mentioned.

Besides class instruction at Princeton, Guyot did important work for
the college in the establishment of amuseum. He found nothing there
of the kind, but by effort at home and while on a trip to Europe, and
with the aid of students inspired by him, and the generosity of friends,
the museum became, under his care, rich both paleontologically and
ethnographically, and in foreign as well as American specimens. It
derives special interest, moreover, from possessing, through his gift,
the five thousand rock specimens collected in his study of the erratic
phenomena of the Alps which he brought with him to the country. The
specimens are so displayed in cases that, in connection with maps in
the room, they teach “the extent, thickness, limits, and courses of the

great ice-mass that orice covered all Switzerland.” Guyot, besides,
found much gratification in the successful work of his pupils in Rocky
Mountain exploration and the large additions to the collections thus
secured. The memoir of Guyot, by William Libbey, jr., vice-director
of the museum, speaks of the museum as the most substantial monu-
ment that Professor Guyot has left behind him in Princeton.

Meteorological and Geographic Work, 1849 to 1881.—At the Philadelphia
meeting of the American Association in 1848, where Guyot went with
Agassiz soon after reaching the country, he met Professor Henry, of the
Smithsonian Institution, and this meeting was soon followed by the
perfecting of plans fora national system of meteorological observations.
Guyot was charged by Professor Henry with the selection and ordering
of the improved instruments that were required; and among his changes
he rejected the old barometers in favor of the cistern barometer of Fortin
as improved by Ernst and further improved in accordance with his own
suggestion as regards safety of transportation, making what is now the
Smithsonian barometer. He also prepared directions for meteorolog-
ical observations, which were published by the Institution as a pamphlet
of forty pages in 1850, and a volume of meteorological and physical
tables, which was printed and distributed in 1852. The latter very im-
portant work was afterward enlarged and became, in the edition of
1859, a volume of 634 pages, containing over 200 tables admirably ar-
ranged and adapted for the best meteorological and hypsometric work.*
A letter of his to Professor Henry in 1858 says that two-fifths of the
pages of tables, representing 68,000 computed results, were wholly new
and were prepared for the volume. He adds: ‘It is essentially a work
of patience, in doing which the idea of saving much labor to others and
facilitating scientific research is the only encouraging element.”

One important part of Guyot’s meteorological labors consisted in the
selection and establishment of meteorological stations. With this ob-
ject in view, he made in 1849 and 1850, under the direction of the regents
of the University of New York, in conjunction with the Smithsonian
Institution, a general orographic study of the State of New York in
order to ascertain the best locations for such stations. Thirty-eight
stations were then located by him at points widely distributed over the
State; and, at the same time, patient, earnest Guyot took pains to in-
struct observers at the stations in the use of the meteorological instru-—
ments. Similar work was also done under like auspices in the State
of Massachusetts. The report of the regents of the University of New
York for 1851 contains the topographical results of the exploration,
giving an excellent sketch of the high plateaus and the larger valleys
of the State.t The exploration in 1849 extended into the depth of

*The volume of tables is No. 538 of the Smithsonian Publications. In 1859 it re-
ceived from its author a further addition to its tables of 70 pages, and in 1884 a new
and enlarged edition, in preparation since 1879, was issued; forming vol. xxvii, of
the ‘‘Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.” ;

winter, and his long journeys in that inclement season were often over
unbroken roads and in the roughest of conveyances.

Thus Guyot went almost immediately to work in his favorite fields,
laying the foundations not only for geographical education, but also for
geographical investigation, and for a national system of meteorological
observations and records. The national plan was not then inaugurated ;
but the work thus carried forward under the Smithsonian Institution
was the initiator, in fact, of the United States Signal Service Bureau.

In the summer of 1861 Guyot had oceasion to visit Europe, and he
took advantage of the opportunity, observes Professor Henry, “to de-
termine, by his own observation, the relations of the standard barom-
eters used by the Smithsonian Institution with the most important
standards of the European observatories; and it is believed that these
comparisons establish a correspondence of the European and American
standards within the narrow limit of one or two thousandths of an
inch.”*

Besides the general survey of New York topography, Guyot carried
forward, during his leisure weeks of the summer and autumn, a study
of the altitudes and orography of the Appalachian chain, or the mount-
ain system of eastern North America, in which work he had encour-
agement from appropriations by the Smithsonian Institution. Hecom-
menced, as early as 1849, a barometric exploration of the White Mount-
ain system of New Hampshire, and continued his work at the North
until he had spent five years over New Hampshire, the Green Mount-
ains in Vermont, and the Adirondacks, and other parts of New York.

From these more northern portions of the Appalachian system he
went to Virginia and North Carolina. In July of 1856 he measured
barometrically twelve of the highest peaks of the Black Mountains in
North Carolina, all of them higher than the White Mountains of New
Hampshire. He was occupied with this southern part of the system
from that time till late in the summer of 1860, when his measured
heights in that region of endless forests and great altitudes had in-
creased in number until they exceeded one hundred and eighty; how
much exceeded his paper does not say, as the altitudes determined in
1860 remain still unpublished. Besides these measurements, he made
his survey complete by extending a net-work of triangles over the area
(nearly 150 miles in length), so fixing the positions of the peaks and
ridges.

In a letter of October 3, 1859, he writes, speaking of his work of that
season in the Smoky Mountains, ‘‘the culminating range of North Car-
olina”: “My trip to the Smoky Mountains was a long and laborious

*Professor Henry’s report to the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution for the
year 1862. The observatories with which the comparisons were made were that of
Kew, then under the direction of Stanley ; that of Brussels, under Quetelet; that of
Berlin, under Encke, and that of Geneva, under Plantamour, who had already com-
pared the Geneva barometer with that of the Collége de France and that of the Ob-
servatory of Paris.

one. Much rain, great distances, imperviable forests, delayed me two
months. I camped out twenty nights, spending a night on every one
of the highest summits, so as to have observations at the most favor-
able hours. The ridge of the Smoky Mountains I ran over from begin-
ning to end, viz, to the great gap threugh which the Little Tennessee
comes out of the mountains.”

Having thus far finished his study of the mountain system, a new
map of the whole Appalachian chain, made under his direction by his
nephew, Mr. Sandoz, was published in 1860, in the July number of
Petermann’s “ Mittheilungen.” This map, with some emendations, was
republished in 1861, in volume xxxI (second series) of the American
Journal of Science, in illustration of an accompanying paper on the
Appalachian system. This paper, after a brief history of his work, pre-
sents his results in an orographie description of the mountain region
and an explanation of the laws which he had deduced, together with
tables of more than three hundred altitudes.

His * thousands of measurements” in the Alps had prepared him for
accurate and thorough work here. As evidence of exactness, his
barometric measurement of Mt. Washington in 1851 gave tor the height
6,291 feet; the measurements by spirit-level made by N. A. Godwin,
civil engineer, in 1852, gave 6,285 feet, and a similar levelling under the
direction of the Coast Survey in 1853 gave 6,293 feet. So, again, the
Black Dome of North Carolina, made 6,707 feet by him, was measured
with a spirit-level by Maj. J. C. Turner, civil engineer, setting out
from Guyot’s point of departure, and the height made 6,711 feet.

There was still left unmeasured the heights of the Catskill Mountain
range. In 1862 he went to work in this region, ana continued it, as
before, during his summer and autumn vacation months until the close
of the summer of 1879, excepting the year 1871, when he took a trip to
California for his health and some barometric work in the Rocky Mount-
ains and the Coast Range. Gray’s Peak, in Colorado, was one of the
heights ascended and measured—an easy walk for him, said the young
men of the party.

The Catskill region, a plateau of ‘“ piled-up strata owing its mountain
forms chiefly to sculpturing waters,” had its difficulties. Although so
near New York and the Hudson River, and frequented each summer by
thousands of tourists, it was to a large extent, especially over the south-
western part, an untracked wilderness of forests. In several cases his.
only chance for making his triangulation was by climbing to the tops
of the highest trees, and then there was difficulty in identifying the dis-
tant, featureless, forest-buried summits. Moreover, many peaks had
no names, and again the same name was often found to be used for
two or three different peaks. He accomplished his work nevertheless,
and when finished had gratifying proof of his great accuracy in spite
of the difficulties. One point in the triangulation, the extreme western,
was in common, as he afterwards found, with that of the State survey
718 MEMOIR OF GUYOT.

of New York, under Mr. James T. Gardiner; and “in the position of
this station,” he says, writing August 12, 1849, “‘we agree perfectly.”

He discovered, by his explorations in the Catskills, nineteen summits
that were higher than the highest previously known, three of them over
4,000 feet above tide-level. For the highest, called “ Slide Mountain,”
he found the elevation 4,205 feet, while that of “High Peak,” which
had been thought the highest, proved to be only 3,664 feet.

This work, closing so grandly Guyot’s study of the Appalachian sys-
tem—begun by him when he was forty-two years of age, was finished
in 1881 when seventy-four. It was his “ vacation” work. His memoir
on the Catskills was published in 1880 in volume XIx (third series) of
the American Journal of Science, with two illustrating maps. The oro-
graphic structure of the range is described, its origin briefly and
judiciously considered, and the heights given for over two hundred
points. A larger map (14 by 20 inches) was issued the year before as
a pocket map. And thus his orograpnic labors have already contrib-
uted greatly to the convenience of tourists as well as to geographical
science.

Guyot’s first scientific work, fifty years since, and his last was mount-
ain work. And I think I am safe in saying that no one before him, if
any since, can claim to have made with the barometer more numerous
and more accurate hypsometric measurements; his field books make
the number of such measurements by him over twelve thousand. In
all his explorations he manifested that unflagging energy and thor-
oughness which are required for accurate work. At the same time his
acuteness of intellect and well-furnished mind, while demanding the
fullest investigation for final results, led him quickly and surely in the
path toward right conclusions, as was strikingly manifested in the out-
come of those six weeks in 1838 over the glaciers. Besides these qual-
ities of the careful and judicious observer his ever-searching mind, as
shown by his comprehensive views on the earth, living nature, and
man, was remarkable for its powers of philosophical analysis and gen-
eralization. The combination of the thorough student of facts in nature
with the far-seeing student of principles and fundamental law has sel-
dom been more complete, and we may therefore well describe him as in
a remarkable degree —using his own language—“ a harmonic unit.”

The two friends from Switzerland, Guyot and Agassiz, were both
needed by the country when they reached its shores. Each performed
a work among us of great service to education as well as to science,
and we owe them lasting gratitude. But their change of base in com-
ing to America gave them a position for wider influence over the world,
and American gratitude is not all that is due them.

In recognition of Guyot’s services to science he was elected to hon-
orary membership in several learned societies, among them the Geo-
graphical Society of London, and that of Paris; and sinee his decease
a geographical society has been organized at Neuchatel, this being, in

the words of Prof. Louis Favre, “the finest monument that could be
erected to the memory of a savant who had brought so much honor to
his native land.”

In 1867 Guyot married a daughter of the late Governor Haines, of
New Jersey, a lady of intelligence and refinement, who made for him
the happiest of homes; and his gentleness, consideration, and warmth
of heart fitted him to contribute his share to that happiness.

Guyot’s face and manner betokened deep and earnest thought rather
than enthusiasm and quiet self-possession without self-assertion. A
man of medium height, deep-set eyes, and spare figure, he looked as if
made more for thinking than for acting, and yet his power of walking
and climbing seems to have had no bounds, and scarcely failed him at
all until after his three-score and ten had been passed. The greatest
ascents gave his well-trained muscles no more fatigue than a walk in
his garden; and pathless tangled forests for weeks in succession, with
nights in the wild woods, were a source of great enjoyment. On the
29th of December, 1883, hardly six weeks before his decease, he wrote
to the president of the Society of Natural Sciences of Neuchatel, M.
Coulon, after congratulating him on keeping up his walks to Chau-
mont, although then eighty years of age, ‘‘ Even last vear I could have
told you of my seventy-six years and my ability still to climb our
mountains, but unhappily it is not so now.”*

His special weakness was a virtue in excess, an unobtrusiveness
that disinclined him to assert himself, that made him too easily content
with work without publication. Hence his results and original views
often failed of recognition, and but one of his projected works of the
higher series was ever completed. In a letter of November 15, 1858,
in replying to one who had urged him to publish, he says: “Aud I am
A. G., who thinks a good deal and delights in it, but is too easily satis-
fied with that selfish pleasure.” Yet much of this reluctance was, as
before said, owing to the hesitation of his critical mind in the use of the
Knglish language. Besides, he was ever waiting for more facts. And,
too, he was overburdened, as he often said, with his educational labors.
In accordance with his unassuming ways, he did not become a natura-
lized citizen of his adopted country until 1860, he feeling, rather than
reasoning, that a foreigner should not hasten to intrude himself into
political affairs.

Although indisposed to push himself, still, when in conversation with
a man of like intelligence, he was sure tocommand eager attention, and,
without other effort, to find places of honor and congenial work open to
him. Within six months of his arrival in the country, a talk in Phila-
delphia with Professor Henry gained for him the position of a virtual
manager in the meteorological department of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, and, by similar means, there came about his connection with the

720 MEMOIR OF GUYOT.

Massachusetts board of education. Through his wealth of ideas, not
selt-effort, he secured the several high positions occupied by him in the
country.

Guyot was a man of devoted friendships. He manifested this deeply
in his tribute to his old teacher, Carl Ritter, and in that to his compa-
triot, Agassiz. There was no limit to his good-will. Children of his
acquaintance knew this, and all who had the privilege of intercourse
with him. On the 7th of November, 1864, he writes from Princeton,
“Tf have bought the house in which I live, and my care has been to
prepare and shape the garden for the next season according to my taste.
A quiet green retreat to study and write, and good friends visiting me
in it and filling it with the warm rays of affectionate friendship, is an
ideal for which, if realized, I should heartily thank God.”

Guyot was a fervently religious man, living as if ever in communion
with his heavenly parent; a Christian, following closely in the foot-
steps of his Master. His search into nature’s phenomena and laws was
a search for divine truth and a divine purpose. His field-notes of 1850
contain theentry: ‘On n’est fort qu’avec la vérité, et ce que m’importe
cest de avoir de mon coté. Dieu sait que je la désire avant tout, et
il me fera la grace de la reconnaitre.” In his trip to Europe in 1861,
he went as a delegate from the Presbyterian Church of America to the
convention of the Evangelican Alliance which met that year in Geneva.
He writes from Paris under date of October 24, just before his return,
of his “ great pleasure in attending, in that old stronghold of Protest-
ant faith, the large and exceedingly interesting meeting,” and in wit-
nessing the * grand spectacle ot so many sympathizing Christians from
all quarters of Christendom uniting in the services with perfect free-
dom and unanimity.” And then he shows his kindly nature in allu-
sions to ‘the testimonies of love and true friendship” which had greeted
him everywhere in his journey through Europe and the land of his
youth, and in expressions of thankfulness ‘ for those old affections” and
those ‘‘deep sympathies which are destined, by their very nature, to
outlive our mortal frames.”

His Neuchatel pupil, Mr. Faure, well observes: ‘He cared little for
renown, but much for the study of nature and for the education of man.”
As fellow-students, we have special reason to admire in Guyot—as he
wrote of Humboldt— that ardent, devoted, disinterested love of nature
which seemed, like a breath ot life, to pervade all his acts; that deep
feeling of reverence for truth so manifest in him which leaves no room for
selfish motives in the pursuit of knowledge, and finds its highest reward
in the possession of truth itself.”

Arnold Guyot died at Princeton on the 8th of February, 1884. Funeral
services were held in the church, where the officers and students of the
college and other friends were gathered with the relatives of the de-
ceased, and excellent memorial discourses were pronounced by Rev.
Horace Hinsdale and Dr. James Murray, dean of the college. His re-
mains lie buried in the Princeton cemetery.
