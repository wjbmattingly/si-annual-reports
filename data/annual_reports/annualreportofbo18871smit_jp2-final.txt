JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

WASHINGTON, January 12, 1887.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution fixing the time of the annual session on the second
Wednesday in January of each year, the Board met this day at 10:30
o’clock A. M.

Present: The Chancellor, Chief-Justice MoRRISON R. WAITE; Hon.
JOHN SHERMAN, Hon. JusTIN S. MorRILL, Hon. SHELBY M. CULLOM,
Hon. OTno R. SINGLETON, Hon. WILLIAM W. PHELPS, Dr. ASA GRAY,
Dr. HENRY CoPpPpbeE, Dr. JAMES C. WELLING, General MONTGOMERY -
C. MEIGS, and the Secretary, Prof. SPENCER IF’. BAIRD.

Excuses for non-attendance were read from Dr. NoAH PORTER and
Hon. WILLIAM L. WILSON.

The Chancellor announced that since the last meeting of the Board
one of its most valued and eminent members had deceased, Rev. Dr.
JOHN MACLEAN, of Princeton, N. J.; whereupon Dr. Welling, chair-
man of the Executive Committee, offered the following:

THE LATE DR. MACLEAN.

I trust that without too much presumption I may venture to offer a
brief minute in humble tribute to the memory of our honored and la-
mented colleague, the late Dr. Maclean, not because I chance to hold the
place he lately filled with so much dignity and usefulness on your Ex-
ecutive Committee, but because it is perhaps my good fortune to have
known that venerable man for a longer period than has fallen to the lot
of any other member of this Board. And yet I do not come with any
words of formal eulogium. This is not the hour and this is not the
place in which to essay anything like an elaborate delineation of the
character which was expressed in the life and services of our late dis-
tinguished friend, a character no less remarkable for its beauty than
for its strength.

The memoir of his long and useful career has already been written else-
where in the record of a well-spent life, dedicated to the glory of God and
the welfare of man. It is written in the annals of the great College,
whose story he has told so well that for all the sons of Princeton it must
remain ‘a possession forever,” and which he was called to serve in every

XI
XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

post of duty and honor, from the humblest to the highest, rising by
easy gradations, because by a natural ascent, from the chair of Tutor
to that of Professor, from the chair of Professor to that of Vice-Presi-
dent, and from the chair of Vice-President to the honors of the Presi-
dency in a critical period, when he was able to lay broad and deep the
solid foundations on which others have builded. It is written in the
anvals of the Church to which he gave his sincere adhesion, whose pul-
pit he adorned no less by the sanctity of his life than by the steadfast-
ness of his faith, and for the defense of whose doctrine and order he was
called again and again to stand in its courts of highest judicature. It
is written in the annals of the Smithsonian Institution, for whose pros-
perity he was willing to spend and be spent till the last day of his
mortal career. And above all it is written in the pious recollections of
a countless host of scholarly men, scattered in all parts of the land, who
from year to year went forth from Nassau Hall carrying with them the
name and memory of John Maclean embalmed in their hearts by a
thousand acts of kindness and of love which transmuted the temporary
ties of academic relation into ‘‘ hooks of steel,” binding to him a suc-
cessive swarm of youth during two generations of men.

Of the ripeness and range of Dr. Maclean’s scholarship tliere is no
room to speak within the limits of this brief chronicle. He preferred
to read the Bible of the old dispensation in the original Hebrew, not
only that he might get as near as possible to “the lively oracles of
God,” but because Hebrew was to him a familiar tongue. In the Greek
language and literature he was a master and for long years an expert
professor. The Latin tongue he wrote with a facility and grace which
caused his pen to be put in frequent requisition whenever, for the pur-
poses of academic disquisition, a draught was to be made on the stately
speech of ancient Rome. As a preacher, he was sound and logical.
As a teacher, he was solid and thorough, looking rather to the substance
than the form of his instruction. As an executive officer, he had that
““wisdom of business” which Lord Bacon praises, because he never
sought an end which he did not believe to be right, and therefore he
was able to pursue all the ends he aimed at with the directness in-
spired by a clear intelligence and a pure heart. In all things he was
the very soul of Christian honor.

Great and good as teacher, preacher, and ruler, the man in Dr. Mae-
lean was something greater, better, and broader than any of the forms
or manifestations under which he was officially called to reveal himself
in the performance of his public functions. The man should always be
greater than the functionary. As the altar which sanctifies the gift is
greater than any gift that ean be laid upon it, so Dr. Maclean was
greater in the sweetness and light of his gentle and candid nature than
was apparent to those who never knew the “hidden man of the heart;”
for high and holy as were his gifts in the sigat of men, those gifts re-

ceived their best consecration from the altar of the sanctified manhood
on which he reverently laid them.
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XIII

Under the inspiration of these sentiments, I respectfully submit the
following resolutions:

Whereas, since the date of the last meeting of the Board of Re-
gents of the Smithsonian Institution, its members have been called to
mourn the loss of their venerable and distinguished colleague, the late
Rey. John Maclean, D. D., LL. D., sometime President of Princeton
College, who held the office of Regent for the term of eighteen years,
during seventeen of which he served on its Executive Committee with
no less credit to himself than usefulness to the Institution: Therefore,
be it

Resolved, That with a high appreciation of the varied, abundant, and
intelligent labors which the late Dr. Maclean brought to the cause of cul-
ture, of truth, and of righteousness throughout the whole of his long,
useful, and honorable career; with a grateful sense of the manifold.
services he rendered to the Smithsonian Institution, for whose welfare
he worked without weariness and watched without flagging, even after
he had begun to feel the burden of age; with profound sorrow for his
death, mingled with reverence for his beautiful memory, and with
thanksgivings for the serene and peaceful close of a finished life, as full
of years as it was full of honors, we hereby testify and record our ad-
miration of the exalted Christian character with which he dignified and
adorned every station that he was called to hold in the eyes of men;
our respect for the solidity of the learning which supported him in the
high discharge of every professional duty, whether in the pulpit, the
academic chair, or the post of executive administration; and lastly,
in special recognition of the grateful savor which his genial presence
never failed to shed on the deliberations of this council-chamber, our
cheerful and loyal homage to the dignity of bearing and amenity of
manners which made him as courteous in debate as he was wise in coun-
Sel, as gracious in all the relations of private life as he was inflexible in
the maintenance of Christian honor and conscientious in the perform-
ance of public duty.

Resolved, That this preamble and resolution be spread on the min-
utes of the Board in respectful tribute to the services and memory of
our venerated colleague, and that a copy of these resolutions be trans-
mitted to the family of our deceased friend in token of the share we
fain would take with them in this bereavement.

The resolutions were unanimously adopted by a rising vote.

The Chancellor announced the election, by joint resolution of Con-
gress, of Dr. James B. Angell, President of the University of Michi-
gan, to fill the vacancy in the Board occasioned by the death of Dr.
Maclean.

The annual report of the Executive Committee for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1886, was presented by its chairman, Dr. Welling, who
Stated that it gave him pleasure to inform the Board that his colleagues,
Dr. Coppée and General Meigs, and himself, after making a thorough
and minute examination of the accounts, looking at every voucher and
verifying the books and certificates, had not found a single error of
omission or commission, and he was therefore able to say that there was
the most gratifying evidence of the efficiency of the financial manage-
XIV JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

ment of the Institution, a fact especially noteworthy when the great
magnitude and the variety of its transactions are considered.

He also called attention to a slight change in the form of the report,
as now presented, from the reports lately presented to the Board. It
was, however, a recurrence to the old practice, which had been changed
a few years ago at the suggestion of a former member of the committee.
It is the custom of the Institution every year to make advances for cer-
tain operations, which are subsequently refunded, and these advances,
with the amounts received from sales of publications, re-payments for
freight, etc., have been deducted from the gross expenditures. The
statements in the report of the Executive Committee, as recently com-
piled, gave only the net or actual outlay from the income of the
Smithson fund. But now it is thought better to spread the actual ag-
gregate of these transactions on the record, so as to exhibit the full
magnitude and distinctive nature of the operations. A statement is
therefore made in the present report of the Executive Committee under
the head of “ Receipts for conducting special researches and collections,”
and ‘* Repayments,” to which we would direct attention.

He also stated that the committee had deemed it advisable to make
a statement of all the moneys received and handled by the Institution
on account of trusts committed to it by Congress, and on the last page
of the report it would be seen that an exhibit was presented giving an
abstract of everything under this head.

On motion of Mr. Sherman the report was received and adopted.

The Secretary presented his annual report for the year ending June
30, 1886, which in accordance with a resolution of the Board had been
printed in advance of the meeting.

General Meigs asked if there was any point in the report that Pro-
fessor Baird wished to emphasize or to ask action on, particularly in
regard to additional buildings for the Museum.

Professor Baird replied that there was not; thatin regard to the new
building for the Museum the Board had already taken action and rec-

Ethnological researches.—An appropriation of $40,000 was made by
Congress for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1887, for the prosecution
of ethnological researches under the direction of the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution. The actual conduct of these investigations
has been placed by the Secretary in the hands of Maj. J. W. Powell,
director of the Geological Survey. The abstracts of expenditures and
balance sheets for this appropriation have been exhibited to us; the
vouchers for the expenditures are, however, transmitted, after approval
by the Secretary, to the accounting officers of the Treasury Department
for settlement.

The balance available to meet outstanding liabilities on the 1st of
July, 1887, as reported by the official disbursing agent, is $6,553.08.

WASHINGTON, July 21, 1887,
REPORT OF PROFESSOR BAIRD,
SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1887.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith the report of the
operations and condition of the Smithsonian Institution for the year
188687.

There is also given, in accordance with established usage, a summary
of the work performed by the branches of the public service placed by
Congress under its charge, namely, the National Museum and the Bu-
reau of Ethnology.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

By the organic law of August 10, 1546, the Vice-President of the
United States is made a member of the Board of Regents; and in the
absence of a Vice-President, it has been held that the President of the
United States Senate occupies the same position. At the date of the
last annual report, Hon. John Sherman, by virtue of his office as the
acting Vice-President pro tempore, was a Regent of the Institution. In
consequence of his resignation of that office, the Hon. John James In-
galls was elected by the United States Senate its President, February
26, 1887; and is accordingly a Regent.

The only other change in the Board since the last annual report is the
vacancy occasioned by the death of the Rev. Dr. John Maclean (fer-
merly president of Princeton College), who was so long identified with
the history of the Institution and so closely associated with its late Sec-
retary, Professor Henry. Dr. Maclean died August 10, 1886, and as a
just mark of respect to his memory the building was closed on the day
of his funeral, August 13, 1586.

The action of the Board in regard to Dr. Maclean was the adoption of
the following resolutions after an eloquent and feeling tribute had been
paid to his memory by Dr. James C. Welling, chairman of the Execu-
tive Committee, whose remarks in full will be found in the journal of
proceedings of the Board of Regents:

‘“¢ Whereas since the date of the last annual meeting of the Board of
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, its members have been called

H. Mis, 600-——1 hes |
2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

upon to mourn the loss of their venerable and distinguished colleague,
the late Rev. John Maclean, D. D., LL. D., sometime president of Prince-
ton College, who held the office of Regent for the term of eighteen years,
during seventeen of which he served on its Executive Committee with
no less credit to himself than of usefulness to the Institution: There-
fore, be it :

‘Resolved, That with a high appreciation of the varied, abundant, and
intelligent labors which the late Dr. Maclean brought to the cause of
culture, of truth, and of righteousness throughout the whole of his long,
useful, and honorable career; with a grateful sense of the manifold serv-
ices he rendered to the Smithsonian Institution, for whose welfare he
worked without weariness, and watched without flagging even after he
had begun to feel the burden of age; with profound sorrow for his death,
mingled with reverence for his beautiful memory, and with thanksgiv-
ing for the serene and peaceful close of a finished life, as full of years
as it was full of honor, we hereby testify and record our admiration of
the exalted Christian character with which he dignified and adorned
every station that he was called to hold in the eyes of men; our respect
for the solidity of the learning which supported him in the high dis-
charge of every professional duty, whether in the pulpit, the academic
chair, or at the pest of executive administration; and lastly, in special
recognition of the grateful savor which his genial presence never failed to
shed on the deliberations of this council chamber, our cheerful and loyal
homage to the dignity of bearing and amenity of manners which made
him as courteous in debate as he was wise in council, as gracious im all
the relations of private life as he was inflexible in the maintenance of
Christian honor and conscientious in the performance of public duty.

‘“‘ Resolved, That this preamble and resolution bespread on the minutes
of the Board in respectful tribute to the services and memory of our
venerated colleague, and that a copy of these resolutions be transmitted
to the family of our deceased friend in token of the share we fain would
take with them in this bereavement.”

Congress by joint resolution, approved by President Cleveland Jan-
uary 19, 1887, filled the vacancy on the Board of Regents occasioned

by the death of Dr. Maclean by the election of Dr. James B. Angell,
president of the University of Michigan.

FINANCES.

The Smithson fund in the Treasury of the United States remains the
Same as stated in the last report, $703,000.

The vouchers and account-books have been examined quarterly by
the Executive Committee, who report them all correct, and that the

United States. A more detailed account of the expenditures of the
Institution is given in the report of the Executive Committee.

ASSISTANT SECRETARIES.

Having consulted with Prof. Samuel P. Langley, director of the
Allegheny Observatory, Pennsylvania, with a view of securing his
services as Assistant Secretary of the Institution, without asking from
him the abandonment of his great scientific researches or a withdrawal
from his observatory, I ascertained that he was willing to devote a con-
siderable portion of his time to the object mentioned.

Accordingly, at the last annual meeting of the Regents, after repre-
senting to them the onerous nature of the duties of the Secretary, from
their increasing range and importance, I requested permission to ap-
point two assistant secretaries, which appointment would be in a cer-
tain sense a return to the organization of the Institution in 1850, when
Mr. Charles C. Jewett was assistant in charge of the library, and my-
self assistant in charge of the museum collections, and later of the ex-
changes as well. I therefore asked leave to nominate Prof. Samuel
P. Langley Assistant Secretary in charge of the exchanges, publications,
and library, and Mr. G. Brown Goode Assistant Secretary in charge of
the National Museum. These nominations were unanimously confirmed
by the Board; and the two gentlemen named were, on the 12th day
of January, 1887, appointed Assistant Secretaries of the Smithsonian
Institution.

Subsequently, in consequence of my enforced absence from the In-
stitution by reason of sickness, Professor Langley was appointed by
the Chancellor, February 10, 1887, Acting Secretary, under the provis-
ions of the act of Congress of May 13, 1884, and this position he contin-
ues to occupy at the date of the present report.

PORTRAIT OF SMITHSON.

A water-color portrait of James Smithson, in the possession of Mr.
James Gunn, of 49 Bedford street, Strand, London, having been offered
to the Institution for 30s., our agent, Mr. Wesley, of London, was au-
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

thorized to conclude the purchase if found satisfactory. By letter dated
May 19, i887, the purchase of the likeness, at £1 10s., was approved ;
and the Elona drawing was forwarded to this Teenie ree where it
will be deposited with the other relics of Smithson. The nae color
is 7 inches by 6 inches in size, representing Smithson in his academic
cap and gown (at the age of probably twenty-five years), and is ina
fresh and excellent condition. ’

BUILDINGS.

Smithsonian Building.—The western corridor, or range, connecting the
main building of the Institution with its extreme western wing, in
which have been deposited of late years all the large alcoholic collec-
tions of the National Museum and of the Fish Commission, not having
its floors, ceilings, and roof originally built fire-proof, representation has
several times been made to Congress that the United States national
collections were thereby seriously endangered, and that a moderate ap-
propriation for providing against such risk was eminently just and ad-
visable. At the last session of Congress an appropriation of $15,000
was granted for putting this range in good fire-proof condition. Pro-
posals for the work were at once published, and the desired repairs
have been commenced and will be vigorously pushed forward.

National Museum Building—The building erected by Government for
the National Museum, at a remarkably small cost, continues to give sat-
isfaction in every particular excepting in its extent. The overflowing
wealth of the collections cannot at present be properly displayed or
protected; and the necessity of additional accommodations becomes
every year more pressing. The Regents having authorized some years
ago an application to Congress for relief, the present opportunity should
not be neglected for again respectfully and urgently pressing upon the
attention of Senators and Members of the House of Representatives
the claims of the National Museum for an additional building, at least
as large as the present one.

Armory Square.—A communication dated June 1, 1887, was received
from Col. John M. Wilson, in charge of the public buildings and grounds,
informing me that it was proposed to re-name Armory Square (extend-
ing from Sixth to Seventh streets, and from B street north to B street
south), after our late distinguished Secretary, the “ HENRY PARK.”
The adjoining triangular reservation, extending eastward from Sixth
street to Third street, is now known as the Seaton Park.

To this communication an expression of cordial approval was re-
turned to Colonel Wilson, through the Acting Secretary, Professor
Langley.

CORRESPONDENCE.

This important branch of Smithsonian operations embraces a wide
range of applications and of topics in addition to the necessarily large
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

number of business and routine letters constantly required in the trans-
action of its daily work. From all portions of our country inquiries
and proposals are continually received, varying from modest requests
for information on subjects frequently common-place, sometimes ab-
struse, to magisterial announcements of new philosophies and cosmolo-
gies, destined to revolutionize science or to entirely supersede the laws
of Newton. Agreeably to its established policy, all correspondents re-
ceive a respectful attention and reply, and if the information sought is
not immediately accessible, either reference is given to other establish-
ments or sources, or specialists are addressed upon the subject, and the
Institution itself becomes a solicitor of knowledge.

The number, however, of those ambitious of having their visionary
speculations published by the Institution has been so considerable that
for several years past the following circular has been largely employed
in response:

‘¢ SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, WASHINGTON, D. C.

“This Institution being in frequent receipt of communications an-
nouncing discoveries or theories supposed by the writers to be both
new and important, it may be well to inform these correspondents that
owing to the number of such papers the usual course is to refer them
to one or more specialists in the particular subject discussed, and to
communicate briefly by letter to the authors the result of such exami-
nation. This may sometimes involve a delay of several weeks before
the expected answer is returned.

“In order to correct a very common misapprehension, it is proper to
state that the Institution has not offered any standing prizes for the
solution of difficult problems, or for the discovery of new scientific prin-
ciples. The proper course for those who wish to obtain pecuniary ad-
vantage from their supposed contributions to knowledge, is to make
some practical application thereof, for which they may secure a patent
from the United States Patent Office. It may also be remarked that a
rule adopted by the Board of Regents forbids the Secretary or his as-
sistants giving, for personal benefit, an official opinion as to the merits
or demerits of inventions or other projects.”

EXPLORATIONS.

A full account of the explorations and accessions resuliing therefrom
undertaken during the past year under the auspices of the Institution
will be found in the report of Mr. Goode, upon the Museum, forming
the second part or volume of the Regents’ Report. Only a brief refer-
ence, therefore, to one or two subjects appears necessary in this place.

Exploration for American bison.—An unsuccessful attempt having
been made the previous year to procure specimens of the buffalo (now
being rapidly exterminated), at the request of Mr. W. T. Hornaday
another attempt was approved and determined upon.

Early in the spring of 1886 the attention of the Secretary was called
to the fact that the work of exterminating the American bison had
made most alarming progress, and also that the representatives of this
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

species then in the National Museum were far from being what they
should be. A careful inventory revealed the fact that the collection
contained only two male specimens which were very old and in a sadly
dilapidated condition, a single cow, an unmounted cow-skin, and one
mounted male skeleton. The efforts which had been made by corre-
spondence during the previous year had signally failed to produce any
specimens. Realizing the imperative need of securing at once and at
all hazards a complete and unexceptional series of fresh skins for
mounting, before it should become too late, the Secretary directed
the chief taxidermist, Mr. Hornaday, to take immediate steps toward
the accomplishment of that end.

At first all inquiries in regard to the presence of wild buffalo were met
by the assurance that those animals had all been killed, and that none
remained outside of the Yellowstone Park. Eventually, however, re-
ports were received to the effect that a few individuals still remained
in Montana, and a few more in the panhandle of Texas. Inasmuch as
the task of finding specimens threatened to be the most serious part of
the undertaking, and might possibly require two or three months’
search, it was decided not to wait until the proper hunting season in the
fall and winter months, but to send the party at once on its quest.
Accordingly Mr. Hornaday started immediately for Montana, and by
following up the most reliable information he obtained, had the exceed-
ing good fortune to find a locality, about 75 miles northwest of Miles
City, which contained about fifty or sixty head of buffalo. Owing to
the fact that the people along the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers
were generally quite ignorant of the existence of those animals in that
wild and uninhabited region, the bison had found safe shelter there
ever since the great northern herd was swept out of existence in the
years 1881, 1882, and 1883, and were breeding there in fancied security.
But the settlement of that country by the ranchmen, which had just
then taken place, doomed every one of those animals to destruction at
the hands of the cowboys, and the sequel has proved that Mr. Horna-
day’s efforts were put forth only just in time to snatch a few specimens
from the total annihilation that has overtaken the millions.

Mr. Hornaday’s party prosecuted its search until three buffaloes were
actually taken, one a very young calf, which was caught alive and so
taken to Washington, and two old bulls, which were killed and pre-
served, As was fairly expected, they had so far shed their winter
pelage that their skins were worthless, but their heads and entire
skeletons were taken. Having thus actually located a band of bison
the party returned to the Smithsonian without delay, to go out again
in the fall to accomplish the remainder of its task.

In the latter part of September, Mr. Hornaday again took the field,
and in a little over two months succeeded in finding about twenty-eight
head of buffalo. By dint of hard work and no small amount of personal
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. : 7

risk twenty-two specimens were killed and preserved in the finest pos-
sible condition, and at the same time the chief taxidermist was afforded
a fine opportunity for making life studies of the species. The finest
and largest of the eight bulls was actually studied and sketched as he
stood on the prairie, wounded and at bay, only 30 yards distant.

In addition to the splendid series of skins of all ages and sexes thus
collected, which in view of the almost complete extinction of the species
we may fairly consider of almost priceless value, the party collected
sixteen complete skeletons, fifty-one dry skulls, two feetal young in
alcohol, and a very fine series of skins and skeletons of prong-horn
antelope, coyote, and a fewdeer. A fine collection of skeletons of birds
of all species found was also made for the department of comparative
anatomy.

This exploration has not only yielded a collection of great value to
the National Museum, and such as could not have been obtained in any
other way, but it has also secured to science a large number of valuable
duplicates such as will be eagerly sought after a very few years hence,
when the last specimen of Bos americanus has been slaughtered. In-
deed, so rapidly is the destruction of our great game animals being
prosecuted in every part of the United States, it is a sad certainty that
in a very few years the elk, mountain sheep, goat, deer, moose, and
other forms will have totally disappeared. In view of this prospect,
more stringent measures of game protection and preservation are loudly
called for.

A full report of the above exploration and its results will be found
in the Report of the U.S. National Museum, already referred to.

Other fields of exploration—A proposal was made (August 2, 1886) to
Mr. C. H. Townsend that he undertake an exploration of the Swan Isl-
ands, in the Caribbean Sea (belonging to the Pacific Guano Company),
said to abound in land birds in great variety, and also in large iguana
and other reptiles, in the belief that the exploration of these islands
will afford an excellent opportunity for a naturalist to make a mono-
graph of great interest. Messrs. Glidden & Curtis having made a cour-
teous offer to accommodate a naturalist on board of one of their vessels
about to sail for that region, due acknowledgment was made for the
favor; and later, additional thanks were called for (November 15, 1886)
by their placing one of their vessels at Mr. Townsend’s disposal, for the
reception of such collections as he might secure for the National Mu-
seum.

An appropriation was made to assist Mr. J. A. MeNiel in collecting
antiquities from the Isthmus of Panama for the National Museum.

The acquisition for the ethnological collections, of the Easter Island
idol, and of other interesting articles, will be fully detailed in the Re-
port, Part Il, devoted te the condition of the National Museum.
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
PUBLICATIONS.

The publications of the Institution may be said to now comprise four
series. First, the “Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge” in quarto
form, presenting the results of original research (corresponding gen-
erally with the transactions of learned societies), of which 25 vol-
umes have been published. Second, the “Smithsonian Miscellaneous
Collections,” in octavo form, presenting papers, tabulations, classi-
fications, and other compilations, generally of a more technical and
practical character, of which 30 volumes have been published. Third,
the “annual reports of the Board of Regents of the Institution” to
Congress, in octavo form, containing, in addition to the exposition of
the operations and condition of the Institution, papers from corre-
spondents illustrating the progress of scientific investigation, of which
40 volumes have been published. Fourth, the more recent series of
“Annual Reports of the Bureau of Ethnology” in imperial octavo
form, of which 4 volumes have been published.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge—The only memoir of this
series actually issued during the past fiscal year, is ‘“* Researches upon
the Venoms of Poisonous Serpents,” by S. Weir Mitchell, M. D., and
Edward T. Reichert, M. D. This forms a quarto volume of 196 pages,
illustrated by 4 cuts inserted in the text and 5 colored plates. This
work was leaving the printer’s hands at the close of the last fiscal year, .
though it was not actually published until the beginning of the present
fiscal year, and it was fully described in the last annual report.

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections—Numerous papers belonging
to this series have been published during the past year, and 3 com-
plete volumes have been collected from the published papers on
hand. ‘These have been selected without reference to their chronolog-
ical order, but mainly with regard to the average size of the resulting
volume, and also with some attention to congruity of compilation. The
numbers prefixed to the following titles indicate merely their order in
the official catalogue of publications.

text. The second volume contains vili+559 pages, including index,
and is illustrated by 48 cuts inserted in the text. This work is fully
described in the Smithsonian report for 188586.

558. *‘ Miscellaneous Collections. Vol. XXX.” The ‘Scientific Writ-
ings of Joseph Henry.” This edition of the work just above referred
to is reprinted on medium octavo paper, for the * Miscellaneous Collec-
tions” series, from the same stereotype plates. It forms a single
octavo volume of 1105 pages.

645. ‘“‘ Miscellaneous Papers relating to Anthropology.” By George
Ercol Sellers; Charles Whittlesey ; J. P. MacLean; Charles C. Jones,
jr.; James Shepard; Mark Williams; and the late Henry Rh. Sehool-
craft. (Reprinted from the Smithsonian report for 1885.) An octavo
pamphlet of 44 pages; illustrated by 19 cuts. °

Bulletins of the National Museum.—This series consists of monographs
of biological subjects, check-lists, taxonomic systems, ete., designed to
illustrate the mineral, botanical, zoological, and ethnological material
of the Museum, and are originally printed under the authority of the
honorable Secretary of the Interior. These papers, prepared under the
direction of the Smithsonian Institution, are necessarily of great variety
in size and range: Bulletin No. 17, for example, covering but 51 pages;
and Bulletin No. 27 occupying 1279 pages. A supplementary edition
of the bulletins from the stereotype plates is issued by the Institution,
and from time to time the issues are arranged or combined in volumes
of its Miscellaneous Collections. Thus Bulletins Nos. 1 to 10, inclusive,
formed Volume XIII of the Miscellaneous Collections. Bulletins Nos.
11 to 15, inelusive, formed Volume X XIII; and Bulletin 16 formed Vol-
ume XXIV. Bulletins 17 and following have not yet been gathered
into the Miscellaneous Volumes.

625. “Bulletin of the U.S. National Museum, No. 30. Bibliography
of Publications relating to the Collection of Fossil Invertebrates in the
U.S. National Museum, including complete lists of the writings of

653. “Bulletin of the U. S. National Museum, No. 31. Synopsis of
the North American Syrphide.” By Samuel W. Williston. Octavo,
335 pages; illustrated by 12 plates of outline cuts.

Proceedings of the National Museum.—This series, like the preceding,
are primarily printed under the authority of the honorable Secretary of
the Interior. The papers, however, are shorter and less elaborate, and
are designed to give early accounts of recent acquisitions to the Museum,
or of freshly acquired facts relating to biology, ete. And to this end
such papers are promptly published in single “signatures” as soon as
matter sufficient to fill 16 pages has been prepared, the date of issue
being given on each signature. The publication thus partakes of
the character of an irregular periodical, the numbers of which, con-
tinuously paged, form a regular annual volume. These volumes, like
the bulletins, are from time to time included in the Miscellaneous Col-
lections. The “ Proceedings,” Vol. I, for 1878, and Vol. II, for 1879, to-
gether formed Vol. XIX of the Miscellaneous Collections, ‘' Proceed-
ings,” Vol. UI, for 1880, and Vol. IV, for 1881, together formed Vol.
XXII of the Miscellaneous Collections. ‘“ Proceedings,” Vol. V and
following have not yet been collected into the ** Miscellaneous” series.

637. ‘Circular for the Guidance of Persons desiring to make Ex-
changes of Birds or Birds’ Eggs with the National Museum.” A one-page
octavo circular (No. 34).

page octavo circular (No. 35). These circulars are inserted as an ap-
pendix to the volume of ‘“‘ Proceedings.”

650. *‘ Proceedings of the U. 8. National Museum, Vol. IX, 1886.”
The volume contains descriptive and systematic papers by James E.
Benedict, T. W. Blackiston, George H. Boehmer, Charles H. Bollman,
Edward D. Cope, W. H. Dall, George E. Doering, Charles L. Edwards,
Carl H. Eigenmann, Barton W. Evermann, Fernando Ferrari-Perez,

W. True, and John Grant Wells. An octavo volume of v+ 714 pages,
illustrated by 25 plates (1 colored, the rest cuts).

Smithsonian Annual Reports——These reports being submitted to Con-
gress as required by the organic law, are printed by order of that body.
Much of the contents, however, are reprinted by the Institution at its
own expense.

fortunately delayed in its issue by the Government Printing Office; the
first part, that relating to the Institution, having been published in the
preceding year. The Museum Report forms an octavo volume of ix+
458 pages, illustrated by 105 wood-cut plates.

649. “Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, showing the operations, expenditures, and condition of the
Institution to July, 1885. Part I.” Owing to the change made by the
Regents in the period of, the Secretary’s report, from the civil or calen-
dar year to the fiscal year of the United States Government, this report °
of the condition of the Institution embraced only the first six months
of the year 1885; or from January to June, inclusive. The volume
contains the Journal of Proceedings of the Board of Regents, the re-
port of the Executive Committee, the report of the Secretary of the
Institution for six months, supplemented by the report on Exchanges,
followed by the ‘General Appendix,” in which is given a record of
scientific progress for 1885, in astronomy, by William C. Winlock; with
a list of astronomical observatories, by George H. Boehmer; in vulean-
ology and seismology, by Charles G. Rockwood; volcanic eruptions and
earthquakes in Iceland within historic times (from the Icelandic of Th.
Thoroddsen) ; geography, by J. King Goodrich; physics, by George F.
Barker; chemistry, by H. Carrington Bolton; mineralogy, by Edward
S. Dana; bibliography of North American invertebrate palzontology,
by J. B. Marcou; zoology, by Theodore Gill; and anthropology, by
Otis T. Mason ; concluding with miscellaneous anthropological papers by
correspondents; observations on stone-chipping, by George E. Sellers;
copper implements from Bayfield, Wis., by Charles Whittlesey ; ancient

plan for American ethnological investigation, by the late Henry R.
Schoolcraft; index to the literature of Uranium, by H. Carrington
Bolton ; and price-list of the publications of the Smithsonian Institution.
The whole forms an octavo volume of xviii + 996 pages, illustrated by
19 figures.

651. “‘ Report of Prof. Spencer F. Baird, Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, for the year 1885~86.”,  Octavo pamphlet of 83 pages.

The volume containing the above report, with its accompanying pa-
pers, together with the second part containing the report of the Museum,
has not yet appeared. The usual concurrent resolution of Congress
directing the printing of 16,000 copies of the reports for 1885~86, failed
to pass the House at its last session although it had passed the Senate
in time. This has unfortunately delayed the issue of these volumes.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

Next in importance to the promotion of original research, and the
propagation of its results in the Smithsonian series of publications,
ranks the system of international exchanges, early established by this
Institution, and continuously prosecuted by it until its operations have
expanded beyond the unaided capabilities of its resources.

During the past fiscal year the receipts for foreign transmission
amounted to 30,046 packages, weighing 83,902 pounds; the receipts for
domestic distribution comprised 10,294 packages, weighing 34,861
pounds, and for Government exchanges the receipts were 21,600 pack-
ages, weighing 22,500 pounds, making the total of 61,940 packages re-
ceived, weighing 141,263 pounds.

A comparison of the receipts for exchanges during the past fiscal year
with those of the preceding year is given in the following table:

It is shown by the above that the receipts on account of Government
exchanges for the past year have fallen off about one-half from those of
the preceding year. This is mainly due to the diminished number of
United States public documents printed during the “ short session ” of
Congress.

During the past year two accessions have been made to the list of
foreign Governments accepting the system of international exchange

with the United States, namely, the Empire of Austria and the Republic
of Peru.

countries which they respectively represent.

Government Exchanges.-The Smithsonian Institution, as is well
known, has been made by law the agent of the United States Govern-
ment for conducting the international exchanges of public official docu-
ments between it and foreign Governments. By joint resolution of
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Congress (approved March 2, 1867), it was ordered that “ fifty copies
of all documents hereafter printed by order of either house of Congress,
and fifty copies additional of all documents printed in excess of the
usual number, together with fifty copies of each publication issued by
any Department or Bureau of the Government, be placed at the disposal
of the Joint Committee on the Library, who shall exchange the same;
through the agency of the Smithsonian Institution, for such works
published in foreign countries, and especially by foreign Governments,
as may be deemed by said committee an equivalent; said works to be
deposited in the Library of Congress.” And by supplemental joint
resolution to carry the same into better effect (approved July 25, 1868),
the Congressional Printer, whenever he shall be so directed by the
Joint Committee on the Library, is required to print fifty copies in ad-
dition to the regular number of all documents hereafter printed by order
of either house of Congress, or by order of any Department or Bureau
of the Government, and whenever he shail be so directed by the Joint
Committee on the Library, one hundred copies additional of all docu-
ments ordered to be printed in excess of the usual number; said fifty
or one hundred copies to be delivered to the Librarian of Congress, to
be exchanged under the direction of the Joint Committee on the Library,
as provided by joint resolution approved March 2, 1867.

Since the international movement, commencing with the Paris con-
vention of 1875, for promoting the free reviprocal exchange of public
documents, there has. been a growing interest in the subject manifested
abroad. International conferences, for agreeing upon details, were held
at Brussels, Belgium, in 1880, in 1883, and finally in 1886—March 15.
There are now thirty-nine Governments in exchange with the United
States, or, counting the duplicate sets sent to the Dominion of Canada
(deposited at Ottawa and Toronto), there may be said to be forty foreign
recipients. These are: The Argentine Confederation, Austria, Bavaria,
Belgium, Brazil, Buenos Ayres, Canada, two sets (one for the parlia-
mentary library at Ottawa, the other for the legislative library at To-
ronto), Chili, Colombia (United States of), Denmark, France, Germany,
Great Britain, Greece, Hayti, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico,
Netherlands, New South Wales, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Portugal,
Prussia, Queensland, Russia, Saxony, South Australia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Tasmania, Turkey, Venezuela, Victoria, and Wiirtemberg.

Assistance by the Government.—In view of the great public and national
services rendered by the exchange system, in the distribution of Gov-
ernment publications, and in the large accessions of valuable works
annually made through its instrumentality to the Congressional Library,
an appropriation has for some years past been granted by Congress in
aid of this enterprise. And without this support the operations of the
exchange service would be very seriously restricted. The usual appro-
priation of $10,000 was granted to the Institution by the last Congress.

Insufficiency of the Government Exchanges.—W hile the system of inter-
national exchanges inaugurated by the Smithsonian Institution is in a
highly satisfactory condition, the same can not, unfortunately, be said of
the system of Government exchanges intrusted to it. N otwithstanding
the urgent and repeated efforts made by this Institution, it stiil fails to
receive for foreign distribution a large portion of the United States
official publications required for this service by law. Some more effect-
ual legislation appears still necessary to secure the operation of existing
statutes.

Still more unsatisfactory has been the condition of receipts from
abroad in return for the valuable works actually sent from our Govern-
ment. From the indifference of the agents of foreign Governments in
the matter of securing and systematically appropriating their public
documents to the service voluntarily undertaken by these Governments,
the representation of such documents received by us has been meager
in the extreme. The entire receipts from Europe during the past year
have been contained in 5 boxes (with some books and pamphlets by
mail), as against 163 Government boxes forwarded by the Institution.
While it is recalled that when the officer in charge of our exchanges
was sent abroad in 1884, on a tour of inspection and inquiry, the re-
turns from 14 European Governments amounted for that year to 44
boxes and 160 packages of books, numbering in all about 7,000 vol-
umes, the present inadequacy of foreign reciprocity becomes painfully
apparent. Iam constrained to here repeat the earnest recommenda-
tion made by the diligent librarian of the Congressional Library, di-
rected to this matter. In his report for 1885 Mr. Spofford well re-
marks:

‘‘ The experience of years has amply proved the impossibility of secur-
ing any complete or adequate return from foreign Governments for the
full and costly series of Ainerican Government publications so long fur-
nished them, without direct and persistent effort, through an agency
upon the ground furnished with adequate credentials, to attend per-
sonally to the whole business. One of the chief benefits of the initial
effort already made has been the discovery of the practical obstacles in
the way of a thoroughly suecessful system of exchanges. These, it is

believed, could be removed by following up the work with each Govern-
ment, while if neglected or left to the very uncertain medium of cor-
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

respondence the United States will continue to reap very inadequate
returns for our publications sent abroad. It is recommended that the
Joint Committee on the Library consider the expediency of providing
an appropriation to defray the necessary expenses of an agent of inter-
national exchanges, to be sent abroad for a term of at least six months
during the present vear.

“It is also recommended that the act directing the printing of fifty
copies of each publication ordered by any Department or Bureau, to be
devoted to international exchanges, be so amended as to render its pro-
visions more effective.”

The success of the experiment made by us in 1884 would appear to
show that only the employment of an experienced agent of the Institu-
tion, in the work of visiting foreign countries and personally securing
from their authorities the due transmission to our Government of pub-
lic documents as soon as published, is likely to be effective in obtain-
ing the desired result.

LIBRARY.

The fact should constantly be borne in mind that the distribution of
the publications of the Institution secures in return a large amount of
valuable material for the Library of Congress. Whatever cost, there-
fore, there may be to our Government for Smithsonian or Museum re-
ports, ete., it is many times repaid by the exchanges received, in addition
to which the returns for the many volumes of publications printed en-
tirely at the expense of the Smithsonian fund find the same depository.
By the joint resolutions of 1867 and 1868, above referred to, the “ works
published in foreign countries, and especially by foreign Governments,”
that may be obtained by our international exchanges, are directed ‘to
be deposited in the Library of Congress.” This great national institu-
tion thus becomes the beneficiary of this branch of the service, and it is
a matter of public interest that such returns should be placed on their
broadest basis.

The following is a statement of the books, maps, and charts received
by the Smithsonian Institution from July 1, 1886, to June 30, 1887:

U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The National Museum, though supported by Government appropria-
tions, has since 1846 been under the direction of the Institution. Itsrapid
growth during the last few years has shown how impossible it would
be for the Smithsonian Institution to adequately maintain it, even by
the devotion of its entire resources to the task. Indeed, the spacious
building so recently erected by the Government for its accommodation
is already quite insufficient to display its accumulation of valuable ma-
terial, and unless a due provision be early made for the erection of addi-
tional buildings (as urgently asked for in my report for 1883, and in
subsequent reports) there will be a serious hinderance to the proper
administration of the establishment in the insufficiency of space which
can be allowed to its several scientific departments.

In the report of the Museum for 1884 (at page 20), the number of
Specimens is estimated at 1,471,000; this number is now increased by
more than a million, and it is evidently a matter of great importance
that some means of storing and exhibiting this vast quantity of incom-
ing material should be provided without delay. The growth of this
Museum has been exceedingly rapid. Until the beginning of this decade
there was only 1 curator with a few “assistants.” At the present time
there are 31 regularly-organized departments and sections under the
care of 26 curators and numerous assistant curators and aids. Only 9
of the curators receive salaries from the Museum appropriations. Of the
remaining 17,4 are detailed from the U. S. Fish Commission, 2 from
U.S. Army, 1 from U. 8. Navy, 5 from the U.S. Geological Survey, and
1 from the Bureau of Ethnology. Prof. O. C. Marsh has been appointed
honorary curator of the department of vertebrate fossils, and Mr. 8.
R. Koehler, of Roxbury, Mass., has accepted a commission as acting
curator of the section of graphic arts.

There have been no important changes in the administrative staff, a
classification of which is given in full in the report for 1885-1886,

Hi, Mis, 600—-2
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

It is estimated that there are now in the Museum 2,592,732 ‘ lots” of
specimens, an increase of 1,121,732 during the last two and a half years.
The catalogues of the various departments show that in the aggregate
36,595 entries of accession “lots” have been made during the year. In
Speaiine of the accessions to the Museum, I desire to present the cordial
thanks of the Smithsonian Institution to the various Departments and
Bureaus of the Government through whose valuable co-operation a
great deal of interesting material has been received.

The increased popularity of the Museum is plainly evidenced by the
fact that during the year it has bee.. visited by 216,562 persons, while
98,592 visitors were registered in the Smithsonian building, giving a
total of 315,114 visitors to both buildings during the year. This is an
increase of 51,929 over the number recorded for the last fiscal year.

Mr. A. H. Clark has been appointed editor of the Proceedings and
Bulletins in place of Dr. T. H. Bean, who for many years has carried
on this work with great ability. This change was made at Dr. Bean’s
request, since the demands on his time as curator of fishes, left very
little opportunity for him to attend to editorial work. During the year
the Museum report for 1884 was issued, and the manuscripts for both
the 1885 and 1886 reports are now in the hands of the printer. Vol.
VIII of the ‘‘Proceedings of the National Museum” was issued in Oc-
tober, and the signatures of Vol. 1X are all in print. In addition 6
signatures of Vol. X were distributed before the close of the fiscal year.
Bulletin 31, ‘Synopsis of the North America Syrphide,” by Dr. Samuel
M. Williston, appeared in May. Bulletin 32, ‘‘Catalogue of the Batra-
chia and Reptiles of Central America and Mexico,” by Prof. E. D. Cope,
is now intype. The manuscript for Bulletin 33, ‘Catalogue of Minerals
and Synonyms,” by Mr. Thomas Egleston, as well as that for Bulletin
34, ‘Catalogue of the Batrachia and Reptiles of North America,” by
Prof. EK. D. Cope, has gone to the Government Printing Office. <A bib-
liography of papers published by officers of the Museum and by co-op-
erators in Museum work is included in the report of the assistant
secretary. This embraces 345 titles by 84 authors, 32 of whom are
officially connected with the Museum.

In the library, the total number of publications received during the
year, exclusive of regular periodicals, was 1,511. The most valuable
contributions to the library were those made by the Secretary of the
Institution.

There were received 2,055 forms of labels, from the Government Print-
ign Office, each form containing 24 copies, 12 or which are printed on
card-board and 12 on paper.

As in previous years, several students in various branches of natural
history have enjoyed the privilege of access to the collections in which
they were especially interested. Courtesies of this kind have been ex-
tended: notably by the departments of birds, insects, mollusks, marine
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

invertebrates, minerals, mammals, ethnology, and fishes. Instruction
in taxidermy and photography has been given to several applicants.

The regular Saturday lectures, 12 in number, were given in the lec-
ture hall between March 12 and May 7. The national convention ot
Superintendents of Schools (March 15-17) and the Dental Association
(July 27-29) held their meetings in the same hall. The Biological
Society of Washington also used this room for their regular fort-
nightly meetings during the winter.

The Museum preparators have been kept constantly employed during
the year. The chief taxidermist was sent by this Institution to Montana
for the purpose of obtaining skins and skeletons of American bison,
and the results of this expedition were successful. The details of the
work accomplished in the various preparators’ shops will be found in -
the report of the assistant secretary, on the condition of the Museum.

The work accomplished in the scientific departments is described at
length in the reports of the curators, given in the Museum Report,
which forms Part II of the Smithsonian Report. As this work is briefly
reviewed by the Assistant Secretary in the said Museum report it is
unnecessary to enlarge upon it here.

It seems proper that I should here pay a tribute of respect to a de-
parted collaborator—Capt. Hubbard C. Chester—who, as connected
with the U.S. Fish Commission service, has contributed tothe accessions
of the Museum. Captain Chester was born at Groton, Conn., July 6,
1835. Devoted to a sea-faring life from his earliest manhood, he joined
the ship Leander in 1857, under the command of his uncle, Capt. Brad-
dock Chester, on a whaling voyage. In 1860 he sailed in the schooner
Cornelia to the southern Indian Ocean in pursuit of elephant seals. In
1864, as mate of the whaling vessel, Monticello, he made a voyage to
Hudson Bay. In 1871, as mate of the ill-fated Polaris, under command
of Capt. Charles F. Hall, he joined in the Arctic expedition ; and it
was to his skill and courage that the survivors of this expedition owed
their preservation. In 1874, Captain Chester attached himself to the
Fish Commission, in which service he remained during his life. In
1883 he superintended the packing of the collections sent by the U.S.
Commission to the International Fisheries Exhibition at London, as-
sisted in the installation of the exhibition at London, and also in re-
packing the exhibit for return to this country. In 1885 he was made
superintendent of the new station at Wood’s Holl.

After an illness primarily induced by his exposures he died at his
home in Noank, Conn., July 19, 1886. His varied services—faithfully
rendered—inspired all who knew him with a high appreciation of his
abilities and a strong regard for his mauly worth,
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

The prosecution of ethnologic researches among the North American
Indians, under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution and in compliance with acts of Congress, was continued during the
year 1886~87, under the charge of Maj. J. W. Powell, who has furnished
the following account of operations.

The work of the year may be conveniently reported upon under the
two general heads of ficld work and office work.

1. Field work.

The field work of the yearis divided into (1) mound explorations and
(2) general field studies, embracing those relating to social customs, in-
stitutions, linguistics, and other divisions of anthropology.

Mound explorations.—The work of exploring the mounds of the east-
ern United States was, as in previous years, under the charge of Prof.
Cyrus Thomas.

Although Professor Thomas and his assistants have devoted a large
portion of the year to the study of the collections made in the division
of mound exploration and to the preparation of a report of its opera-
tions for the past five years, yet some field work of importance has been
done.

Professor Thomas, in person, has examined the more important an-
cient works of New York and Ohio. He has given special attention
to the latter, with a view of determining where new and more accu-
rate descriptions, surveys, and illustrations are necessary. It was
found requisite to undertake a careful re-survey and description of a
number of the well-known works in Ohio. This re-examination, which
is still in progress, is deemed. the more necessary in view of the light
shed on the origin and use of these monuments by the explorations
which have been carried on in West Virginia, western North Carolina,
and eastern Tennessee.

Mr. J. P. Rogan continued his work as assistant until the close of
November, when he voluntarily resigned his position to enter upon other
engagements. A portion of his time during the first month was occu-
pied in arranging and preparing for shipment the collection purchased
of Mrs. McGlashan, in Savannah,Ga. The rest of his time was em-
ployed in exploring mounds along the upper Savannah River in Georgia
and South Carolina and along the lower Yazoo River in Mississippi.

Mr. J. W. Emmert continued to act as field assistant until the end of
February, when the field work closed. His labors, with the exception
of a short visit to central New York, were confined to east Tennessee,
chiefly Blount, Monroe, and Loudon Counties, where numerous extensive
and very interesting groups are found in the section formerly occupied
by the Cheroki. Professor Thomas has thought it necessary to devote

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. aT

considerable attention to the ancient works of that region, as it is prob-
able that there and in western North Carolina is to be found the key that
will materially assist in solving the problem of the singular works of
Ohio. The results of these explorations are of unusual interest, inde-
pendent of their supposed bearing on the Ohio mounds.

Mr. J. D. Middleton, who has been a constant assistant since the or-
ganization of the division, after completing some investigations begun
in southern Illinois, visited western Kentucky for the purpose of inves-
tigating the works of that section, but was soon afterwards called to
Washington to take part in the office work. During the month of
June he visited and made a thorough survey of the extensive group of
works near Charleston, West Va., of which Colonel Norris had made a
partial exploration, the latter having been prevented from completing it
by the sickness which immediately preceded his death. During the
same month Mr. Middleton commenced the survey of the Ohio works
before alluded to, securing some valuable results in the short time be-
fore the close of the year.

Mr. Gerard Fowke was also engaged for a short time in field work in
western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky, but was called early in
autumn to Washington to assist in office work.

General field studies.—During October and December Mr. Albert S.
Gatschet was engaged in gathering historic and linguistic data in
Louisiana, Texas, and the portion of Mexico adjoining the Rio Grande,
this region containing the remnants of a number of tribes of whose lan-
guage and linguistic affinity practically nothing is known. After a
long search Mr. Gatschet found a small settlement of Biloxi Indians
at Indian Creek, 5 or 6 miles west of Lecompte, Rapides Parish, La.,

_where they gain a livelihood as day laborers. Most of them speak

English more than their native tongue. In fact about two-thirds of
the thirty-two survivors speak English only. The vocabulary obtained
by him discloses the interesting fact that the Biloxi belong to the Siouan
linguistic family.

Mr. Gatschet heard of about twenty-five of the Tunica tribe still
living in their old homes on the Marksville Prairie, Avoyelles Parish,
La. An excellent vocabulary was obtained of their language at Le-
compte, La., and a careful comparison of this with other Indian lan-
guages shows that the Tunica is related to none, but represents a dis-
tinct linguistic family.

He was unable to collect any information in regard to the Karankawa
tribe, concerning which little is known except that they lived upon the
Texan coast near Lavacea Bay.

Leaving Laredo County, Texas, he visited Camargo in Tamaulipas,
Mexico, finding near San Miguel the remnants of the Comecrudo tribe,
or, as they are called by the whites, Carrizos. Only the older men and
women still remember their language. The full-blood Comecrudos seen
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

by Mr. Gatschet were tall and thin, some of them with fairer complexions
than the Mexicans. Subsequently the Cotoname language, formerly
spoken in the same district, was studied and found to be a distantly
related dialect of Comecrudo. Both of them belong to the Coahuilte-
can‘family. From the Comecrudo Mr. Gatschet obtained the names of
a number of extinct tribes who formerly lived in their vicinity, but of
whom no representatives are left. These are the Casas Chiquitas, Te-
jones (or “raccoons ”), Pintos or Pakawas, Miakkan, Cartujanos. Mr.
Gatschet next visited the Tlaskaltec Indians, who livein the city of Sal-
tillo. Of these Indians about 200 still speak their own language, which
is almost identical with the Aztec, although largely mixed with Spanish.

Mr. Josiah Curtin was engaged from the middle of March to June 1
in completing investigations begun the previous year into the history,
myths, and language of the Iroquois Indians at Versailles, Cattaraugus
County, N. Y. The material secured by him is of great interest and
value.

2. Office work.

The Director, Maj. J. W. Powell, has continued the work of the lin-
guistic classification of the Indian tribes in North America north of
Mexico, and in connection with it is preparing a map upon a linguistic
basis showing the original habitat of the tribes. The work is now so far
advanced that it is expected to be ready for the printer before January
next. It will form a part of the seventh annual report.

As previously stated, Professor Thomas has devoted much of his time
during the year to the study of the collections made, and in preparing
for publication the account of field work performed by himself and his
assistants. That account will form the first volume of his final report,
and will consist wholly of descriptions, plans, and figures of the ancient,
works examined, narrative and speculation being entirely excluded.
The report will be ready for publication so soon as the illustrations
shall be prepared and some verifications and supplemental surveys now
being made, shall be completed.

The second volume, which will be devoted to the geographic distri-
bution of the various types of mounds, archologic maps and charts,
and a general discussion of the various forms and types of ancient works,
iswellunderway. Thepreliminary list of the various monuments known,
and of the localities where they are found, together with references to
the works and periodicals in which they are mentioned, which Mrs. V.
L. Thomas, in addition to her other duties as secretary to Mr. Thomas,
has been engaged upon for nearly three years, is now completed, and is
being used in the preparation of maps. It will form a part of the sec-
ond volume.

Mr. Middleton’s office work has consisted entirely in the preparation
of maps, charts, and diagrams. These are of two classes: (1) Those
made entirely from original surveys, which constitute the larger portion,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

and (2) the archeological maps of States and districts, showing the dis-
tribution of given types, which are made from ali the data obtainable,
including additions and verifications made by the mound exploration
division of the Bureau.

Mr. Gerard Fowke, in addition to assisting in the preparation of the
report on the field work which is to constitute the first volume, has made
a study of the stone articles of the collection, and Mr. H. L. Reynolds
jr. has made a study of the copper articles collected, both with a view
of preparing papers for the third volume of the report. The paper by
Mr. Reynolds is nearly completed.

Mr. Pilling continued his bibliographic studies during the year, with
the intention of completing for the press his bibliography of North
American languages. After consultation with the Director and a num-
ber of gentlemen well informed on the subject, it was concluded that
the wants of students in this branch of ethnology would be better sub-
served were the material to be issued in separate bibliographies, each
devoted to one of the great linguistic stocks of North America. The
first to be issued related to the Eskimo, forming a pamphlet of 116 pages.
The experiment proved successful, and Mr. Pilling continued the prep-
aration of the separates. Late in the fiscal year the copy of the bibliog-
raphy of the Siouan family was sent to the Public Printer. It is Mr.
Pilling’s intention to continue this work by preparing a bibliography
of each of the linguistic groups as fast as opportunity will permit.

Mr. Frank H. Cushing continued work, so far as his health permitted,
upon his Zui material until the middle of December. At that time
he gave up office work and left for Arizona and New Mexico, intending
to devote himself for a season to the examination of the ruins of that
region with the view of obtaining material of collateral interest in con-
nection with his Zuni studies as well as in hope of restoring his impaired
health. .

Mr. Charles C. Royce, although no longer officially connected with
the Bureau, has devoted much time during the past year to the com-
pletion of his work upon the former title of Indian tribes to lands within
the United States and the methods of securing their relinquishment.
This work, delayed by Mr. Royce’s resignation from the Bureau force,
is now nearly completed and will soon be ready for publication.

Dr. H. C. Yarrow has continued the preparation of the material for
his final report upon the mortuary customs of the North American
Indians. The collection of data from various sources has been practi-
cally completed, and nothing now remains but the classification and
elaboration of the great amount of material into its final form, which
work is in an advanced state.

Mr. William H. Holmes has continued the archeologic work begun
in preceding years, utilizing such portions of his time as were not ab-
sorbed in work pertaining to the Geological Survey. A paper upon
the antiquities of Chiriqui and one upon textile art in its relation to
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

form and ornament, prepared for the sixth annual report, were com.
pleted and proofs were read. During the year work was begun upon a
review of the ceramic art of Mexico. A special paper, with 20 illus-
trations, upon a remarkable family of spurious antiquities belong-
ing to that country, was prepared and turned over to the Smithsonian
Institution for publication. In addition, a preliminary study of the
prehistoric textile fabrics of Peru was begun, and a short-paper, with
numerous illustrations, was written.

Mr. Holmes has general charge of the miscellaneous archeeologic and
ethnologic collections of the Bureau, and reports that Dr. Cyrus Thomas,
Mr. James Stevenson, and other authorized agents of the Bureau have
obtained collections of articles from the mounds of the Mississippi
Valley and from the ruins of the Pueblo country. A number of inter-
esting articles have also been acquired by donation. Capt. J. G.
Bourke, of the U. S. Army, presented a series of vases and other
ceremonial objects obtained from cliff dwellings and caves in the
Pueblo country; Mr. J. B. Stearns, of Short Hills, made a few addi-
tions to his already valuable donations of relics from the ancient graves
of Chiriqui, Colombia; and Mr. J. N. Macomb presented a number of
fragments of earthenware from Graham County, N.C. Some important
accessions have been made by purchase. A large collection of pot-
tery, textile fabrics, and other articles from the graves of Peru was
obtained from Mr. William E. Curtis; a series of ancient and modern
vessels of clay and numerous articles of other classes from Chihuahua,
Mexico, were acquired through the agency of Dr. E. Palmer; a small
set of handsome vases of the ancient white ware of New Mexico was
acquired by purchase from Mr. C. M. Landon, of Lawrence, Kans., and
several handsome vases from various parts of Mexico were obtained
from Dr. Eugene Boban.

As in former years, Mr. Holmes has superintended the preparation
of drawings and engravings for the Bureau publications. The number
of illustrations prepared during the year amounted to 650.

During the fiscal year Mr. Victor Mindeleff has been engaged in the
preparation of a report on the architecture of the Tusayan and Cibola
groups of pueblos, which is nearly ready for publication. This report
will contain a description of the topography and climate of the region,
in illustration of the influence of environment upon the development of
the pueblo type of architecture. It will also contain a traditionary ac-
count of the Tusayan pueblos and of their separate clans or phratries.
A description in detail of the Tusayan group will treat of the relative
position of the villages and such ruins as are connected traditionally or
historically with them. A comparative study is also made between the
Tusayan and Cibola groups and between them and certain well pre-
served ruins in regard to constructive details, by which means the com-
paratively advanced type of the modern pueblo architecture is clearly
established. Maps of the groups discussed and of the topography of
Sn ee ee

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

the country and ground plans of houses and apartments will illustrate
the report and give effect to the descriptions and discussion.

Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff devoted the early part of the fiscal year to the

. preparation of a report upon the exhibits of the Bureau of Ethnology and
the Geological Survey at the Cincinnati Industrial Exposition, 1884;
the Southern Exposition at Louisville, 1884; and the Industrial and
Cotton Centennial Exposition at New Orleans, 1884~’85. The report
includes a descriptive catalogue of the various exhibits. As these con-
sisted largely of models, and as the locality or object represented by
each model was described in detail, the report was lengthy. It was
finished in October and transmitted to the commissioner representing
the Interior Department. During the remainder of the year the por-
tion of time which Mr. Mindeleff was able to devote to office work was
employed in assisting Mr. Victor Mindeleff in the preparation of a pre-
liminary report on the architecture of Zuni and Tusayan (Moki). The
portion assigned to him consists of an introductory chapter, which will
include a review of the literature of the subject and a chapter devoted
to traditionary history of Tusayan, from material collected by Mr. A.
M. Stephen, of Keam’s Cafon, Ariz.

The modeling room has remained in charge of Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff.
The preparation of a duplicate series of the models made in the past
few years and now deposited in the National Museum was continued, a
large portion of the time being given to that work. During the year
the following models were added to this series, which now consists ot
eighteen models: (1) Relief map of the high plateaus of southern Utah;
(2) model of Leadville and vicinity; (3) model of Shimopavi, Tusayan,
Arizona; (4) model of Etowah mound, Georgia; (5) model of Mishon-
ginivi; (6) model of Zuni; (7) model of Penasco Blanco; (8) models of
Etruscan graves (series to illustrate Etruscan graves, from material

_ furnished by Mr. Thomas Wilson).

During 1886, and continuously to the end of the fiscal year, Mr. E.
W. Nelson has devoted much time to preparing a report upon the Hs-
kimo of northern Alaska, for which his note-books and large collections
obtained in that region furnish ample material. During 1886 the vo-
cabularies, taken from twelve Eskimo dialects for use in Arctic Alaska,
were arrangéd in the form of an English-Eskimo and Eskimo-Eng-
lish dictionary. These dictionaries, with notes upon the alphabet and
grammar, will form one part of his report. The other part, upon
which he is at work at present, will consist of chapters upon various
phases of Eskimo life and customs in Alaska, and will be illustrated by
photographs taken by him on the spot, and by specimens collected dur-
ing his extended journeys in that region. Mr. Nelson’s notes upon
Eskimo legends, festivals, and other customs will form an important
contribution.

Mr. Lucien M. Turner is also engaged in the preparation of a similar
report upon the Eskimo, in the form of a descriptive catalogue of the
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

large amount of material collected by him during a residence of several
years at Saint Michaels and in the Aleutian Islands. When these two
reports shall be completed the amount of accurate information concern-
ing the singular people to whom they relate will be materially in;
creased.

Mr. H. W. Henshaw has continued in charge of the work upon the
synonymy of the Indian tribes of the United States, which was alluded
to in some detail in the report of last year. This work has been sus-
pended for a period, and Mr. Henshaw has assisted the Director in the
preparation of a linguistic map of the region north of Mexico, and in
the classification of the Indian tribes, a work which properly precedes
and forms the basis of the volume on synonymy.

Col. Garrick Mallery was steadily occupied during the year in the
work of the synonymy of the Indian tribes, his special field being the
Troquoian and Algonquian linguistic stocks, and his particular respon-
sibility being the careful study of all the literature on the subject in the
French language. He also, when time allowed, continued researches
in and correspondence concerning sign language and pictographs.

Mr. James Mooney also has been occupied during the entire year in
conjunction with Colonel Mallery in that portion of the work of the In-
dian synonymy relating to the Algonquian and Iroquoian families.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt has continued the work left unfinished by Mrs.
Erminnie Smith. During the year he has been engaged in recording,
translating, and tracing the derivation of Tuscarora-English words for
a dictionary. He has thus far recorded about 8,000 words.

Mr. Albert S. Gatschet has devoted almost the entire year to the
synonymy of Indian tribes and has practically completed the section
assigned to him, viz, the tribes of the southeastern United States.

Rev. J. Owen Dorsey continued his work on the Indian synonymy
cards of the Siouan, Caddoan, Athabascan, Kusan, Yakonan, and Ta-
kilman linguistic stocks. He resumed his preparation of the dictionary
cards for Contributions to North American Ethnology, Vol. VI, Part
II, and in connection therewith found it necessary to elaborate his ad-
ditional Gegiha texts, consisting of more “than two hundred and fifty
epistles, besides ten or more myths gained since 1880. This work was
interrupted in March, 1887, when he was obliged to undertake the ar-
rangement of a new collection of Teton texts for publication. Mr.
George Bushotter, a Dakota Indian who speaks the Teton dialect, was
employed by the Director, from March 23, for the purpose of recording
for future use of the Bureau some of the Teton myths and legends in
the original. One hundred of these texts were thus written, and it de-
volved on Mr. Dorsey to prepare the interlinear translations of the
texts, critical and explanatory notes, and other necessary linguistie
material as dictated by Mr. Bushotter. Besides writing the texts in
the Teton dialect, Mr. Bushotter has been able to furnish numerous
sketches as illustrations, all of which have been drawn and colored ac-

cording to Indian ideas. His collection is the most extensive that has
been gained by any collector among the tribes of the Siouan family,
and it is the first one contributed by an Indian.

Dr. W. J. Hoffman and Mr. Josiah Curtin, as heretofore, have con-
tinued to assist in the work of the synonymy of the Indian tribes.

[In consequence of severe illness, Professor Baird had not extended
and completed his report, as he doubtless had contemplated; and the
Acting Secretary respectfully submits the same, without feeling called
upon for further comment. |]

REPORT ON SMITHSONIAN EXCHANGES FOR THE YEAR
ENDING JUNE 30, 1887.

By Gro. H. BoEHMER.

I. SMITHSONIAN EXCHANGES.

Personnel and duties.—In prosecuting the plans recommended for
the execution of the duties devolving on the exchange division, the
services of some of the clerks became superfluous, and on the Ist of
April, 1887, they were assigned to duty in other departments of the
Institution.

The assistants to the exchange clerk now are:

1. Mr. F. V. Berry, who receives, receipts for, acknowledges by
postal card, verifies, and journalizes all incoming exchanges; who ships
all foreign and government exchanges, and writes out the shipping
orders and announcements to the transportation companies and dis-
tributing agents.

2. Mr. H. A. Parker, who assists Mr. Berry, and in addition keeps a
card catalogue of the titles of official publications received from the
Public Printer as provided for by law.

3. Mr. C. W. Shoemaker, who records all exchange transactions by
(a) entering in day-book; (b) posting on ledger cards; (¢) making ont
invoices; (d) recording acknowledgments; (e) entering letters.

4. Mr. A. F. Adams, who assists Mr. Shoemaker in the execution of
the above duties.

5. Mr. M. A. Tolson, who attends to the shipping of packages for do-
mestic distribution, and in addition assists Mr. Berry in shipping
foreigu exchanges.

My own regular duties are:

(a) The supervising of the service in all its branches.

(b) The receiving of all exchange letters, acting on the same accord-
ing to instructions, and preparing replies or memoranda for replies, by
the corresponding clerk.

29
30 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

(c) The translation of foreign letters and documents.

(ad) The verifying of requests from abroad, for Smithsonian publica-
tions, including the issuing of orders for the same and the keeping of
an account of every Smithsonian publication sent abroad. A quarterly
abstract of this account is submitted to the Chief Clerk.

(e) The preparation of a card catalogue, from the old records, show-
ing the distribution of the volumes of Contributions to Knowledge and
of the Miscellaneous Collections since the establishment of the Institu-
tion.

(7) The preparation of a scientists’ directory.

(g) The preparation, for ready reference, of bibliographical informa-
tion relating to the titles of the publications of foreign establishments
in correspondence with the Institution.

(h) The execution of any work assigned by the Secretary, the Assist-
ant secretaries, and the Chief Clerk.

A very important duty, under this last head, intrusted to me by Pro-
fessor Langley, the acting and assistant secretary, was that of collecting
and arranging all the information relating to the proposed plan for the
increase of the Smithsonian library, and to report on the results of the
inquiry.

The report submitted on the subject represents two divisions: I. In-
quiry. Il. Result.

The first division, that of inquiry, is again subdivided into two sec-
tions, of which the first shows, in brief; abstracts of all transactions of
consequence connected with the scheme, to the number of two hundred,
including the report, and representing, as recorded in full in the jour-
nal, 475 folio pages of manuscript. Part 2 represents a list of persons
addressed on the subject, by circular letter or otherwise, and their re-
spective replies, as indicated by the number corresponding to each
document in the journal. Three hundred letters were written and 174
replies received, as follows:

As shown by the geographical arrangement, 3,594 distinct titles, rep-
resenting 5,730 references, were reported by the collaborators, and it was
part of my instructions to ascertain how many of these were already
correspondents of the Institution.

Subtracting from the number of titles the 400 approximated trom the
unclassified list of books in the west room of the Patent Office Library, °
and the 866 published in the United States, 2,328 foreign serials remain,
and of these 792, or 34 per cent., occur in our list of foreign correspond-
ents, which number, however, will be increased to some extent by the
correction of titles, given in many cases but very indistinetly, and by
the assigiment to the proper society on the list of correspondents of
magazines and journals properly to be designated under the name of
the society; and it is believed that upon that correction nearly one-half
of all the foreign titles given may be considered as correspondents of
the Institution.

I beg here to state that owing to the press of routine duties all the
work connected with the library inquiry has been performed by me in
my leisure hours.

Work performed.—During the past year 61,940 packages, represent-
ing a weight of 141,263 ponnds, were received. Of these 10,294 were
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 33

for domestic distribution, and these were sent out through the United
States Post-Office. The remainder was for foreign and Government
distribution, requiring 692 packing-boxes with a bulk of 4,122 cubic feet.

The total number of entries were, for domestic exchanges 20,590, and
for the foreign branch 51,917 entries.

The ledger shows 9,561 running accounts, of which 7,396 are with cor-
respondents abroad and 2,165 with domestic establishments and individ-
uals.

For foreign transmission 15,298 invoices required to be written, of
which 12,430 were returned properly receipted, and which had to be
credited on the respective accounts. Of domestic invoices 4,924 were
returned by consignees and entered.

Letters received during the year 1,131, and 1,217 were written.

In the following table I beg to give a detailed statement of the
amount of work performed during each month of the year:

34 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

Transportation companies.—The only change which has taken place in
the relations of the Institution to the transportation companies extend-
ing the privilege of free freight on all Smithsonian exchanges was caused
by the dissolution of the Monarch Line, plying between London and
New York. Satisfactory arrangements, however, have been made with
Messrs. Barber & Co., of New York, to forward the cases to London
at a mere nominal charge, while the incoming cases from England con-
tinue to be transported free of cost, by the Cunard and Inman Lines.

A full list and account of the transportation lines to which the Insti-
tution is indebted for the privilege of free freight was given in the
Smithsonian Report for 1886.

Centers of distribution.—No changes have taken place among the dis-
tributing agents abroad, all of whom deserve the warmest thanks for
the prompt and efficient manner in which they have discharged their
mostly voluntary duties.

For a complete list of agents for the distribution of Smithsonian ex-
changes, I beg to refer to the report for 1886.

Shipments made to foreign countries.—With the increase in the busi-
ness a more rapid method of intercourse had to be devised, and now
the shipments have become very frequent, with but very short inter-
vals.

The following table exhibits the dates of transmissions during the
present year to each of the foreign countries corresponding with the
Institution :

36 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

It has been suggested that the intervals between the receipt, by the
Smithsonian Institution, of packages and their delivery to the consignee
might perhaps be lessened by some improved method of transmission.
If there is ground for complaint of tardiness in the delivery, such charge
can certainly not be made against the exchange office, in which but
very small delays occur between the receipt of exchange packages and
their transmission.

In order to illustrate this assertion I now beg to submit the follow-
ing tables of transmissions to France, Germany, Great Britain, and
Italy. In each case twenty invoices have been selected at random, ex-
tending over a period of almost three years, and their history has been
traced from the ledger accounts as follows:

IL.—GOVERNMENT EXCHANGES.

The Smithsonian Institution, charged by the Government of the
United States with the duties required for the execution of an exchange
of official public documents with foreign Governments, as provided for
by the laws of March 2, 1867, and July 25, 1868, has, during the past
year, received from the Public Printer three hundred and seventy-one
sets (of fifty copies each) of official publications. These were distrib-
uted in the usual manner to the contracting Governments of thirty-
eight countries. .

The Governments of Peru and Austria were added to the list, thus
increasing the number of recipients to forty.

EXCHANGE WITH AUSTRIA.

The first step toward establishing exchange relations with the Gov-
ernment of Austria was taken in 1876, by the transmission of the first
two boxes of official publications, which were depostied in the Imperial
Library at Vienna.
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 39

In 1884 the subject was again taken up on occasion of my mission to
Europe, as described in the Smithsonian Reports for 1884 and 1885, but
no definite arrangement could be decided on.

On the 14th of December the following letter was received by the
Smithsonian Institution:

The chargé Waffaires of Austria-Hungary to the Secretary of the Smithso
nian Institution.

WASHINGTON, D. C., December 14, 1886.

Sir: Having been instructed to transmit to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution a case which reached this legation yesterday, and which con-
tains thirty-four volumes (and one register) of stenographie reports
referring to the ninth session of both houses of the Imperial Parliament,
I have the honor to inform you that said case shall be forwarded with
out delay to your address.

Please to acknowledge the receipt of said publications, and accept,
sir, the renewed assurance of my high consideration.

Yours, very respectfully,
LIPpPE- WEISSENFELS.

The first advance toward the accomplishment of the proposition for
an exchange made by the United States having thus been made by the
Imperial Government in Vienna, it was decided to make an immediate
return in official publications of the United States Government, result-
ing in the following correspondence:

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to the consul-general of Aus-
tria-Hungary in New York.

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 8, 1887.

Str: The Smithsonian Institution, on behalf of the United States
Government, is about presenting to the Imperial Government at Vienna
a set of the United States official documents published since January
1, 1868, comprising twenty-five packing-boxes, with an approximate
bulk of 160 cubic feet, and an aggregate weight of about 6,000 pounds.

In this transaction we desire the Imperial Government to be at the
least possible expense, and we therefore propose to deliver the cases,
freight prepaid, at an Austrian sea-port easy of access to Vienna, such
as Trieste or Fiume, provided we could arrange for the shipment of the
lot by some sailing vessel bound direct for one of those ports.

We are not cognizant of any regular sailing communication between
the United States and Austria, and therefore beg to request your kind
co-operation in the matter, by informing us of the existence of a regular
line plying between New York and one of the above-named Austrian
ports, or of the possibility of arranging with some Austrian vessel for
the shipment, at reasonable rates, of the lot of books mentioned, which
could be délivered in New York within forty-eight hours of any informa-
tion received.

Very respectfully,
SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution.
40 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.
In reply to this letter the following communication was received :

The Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian consulate-general, New York, to
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

NEw YorRK, January 17, 1887.

Str: In receipt of your esteemed favor of the 8th instant, I beg to say
that I shall be most happy to co-operate with you in the matter of the
shipment of a set of United States official ducuments to the Imperial
Government at Vienna,

There is, unfortunately, no regular sailing communication between
the United States and Austria, nor is there at this moment any sailing-
vessel or steamer in port bound direct to Trieste or Fiume.

It may be that an opportunity will before long offer itself to ship the
books by an Austrian sailing vessel to a home port, and in that case I
shall not fail to communicate with you at once.

I have also given instructions to be promptly advised of the loading
of any sailing vessel or steamer for Austrian ports, so as to make ar-
rangements for this shipment.

I shall have the pleasure of reporting progress as soon as possible;
and remain,

Very respectfully, ete.,
Hueo FRITSCH,
Consul.

The Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian consulate-general, New York,

NEw York, May 2, 1887.

Sir: Referring to my last of January 17, a. ¢., | am to-day enabled to
comply with your favor of January 8.

There is no Austrian vessel as yet for Trieste, but the Italian bark
rags Mignano is now loading for that port and will sail in about two
weeks.

The agents are Messrs. Funch, Edye & Co., 27 South William street.

WASHINGTON, D. C., May 9, 1887.
Str: I have the honor inclosed to submit a copy of a communication
addressed by the Smithsonian Institution on the 12th of October, 1885,
to Count Lippe Weissenfels, the Imperial Austrian chargé d’affaires (this
communication will be found on page 109 of the Smithsonian Annual
Report for 1886, Part I), explanatory of the steps taken for the final
REPORT ON EXCHANGES, 41

settlement of the question of an exchange of the official publications
between the Government of His Majesty and that of the United States,
proposed bythe Smithsonian Institution, as the authorized agent of the
Government in 1884.

Since then, on the 14th December, 1886, the first advance was made
by the Austrian Government by the transmission, through His Majesty’s
legation, of a case containing the *‘ stenographic reports referring to the
ninth session of both houses of the Imperial Parliament,” and being
desirous of making an immediate return, we placed ourselves in com-
munication with the Austrian consul-general in New York, relative to
the best mode of forwarding our exchanges to the Austrian port most
convenient to Vienna.

In compliance with our request, Consul-General Fritsch of New York
now informs us that the Italian bark Peppino Mignano is about to sail
for Trieste. Therefore, unless your excellency is prepared to provide
for a channel of transmission, we propose to utilize the opportunity
thus offered, and to send by this bark, freight prepaid, to Trieste the
twenty-seven boxes of official documents (with a bulk of about 160 cubic
feet and a total weight of about 7,000 pounds) required, additional to the
two boxes already deposited in the Imperial Public Library in Vienna,
to complete the series comprised in the exchange proposition, and now
beg you to kindly arrange or have the Imperial Government arrange
for their delivery to some responsible party in Trieste.

The annual addition to this collection will be about three boxes, and
we desire instructions to deliver the same hereafter to the consul-general
in New York for transmission to Vienna.

As provided for in the stipulations of exchanges proposed through
Mr. Boehmer in 1884, we trust that the minister of foreign affairs in
Vienna may be pleased to arrange for the collecting from the various
departments and bureaus of the Government and from the scientific es-
tablishments and institutions under their care, of one copy each of allthe
publications made by them or under their direction, and to have the
same forwarded to the agent of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr. Felix
Fliigel, 39 Sidonien Strasse, Leipzig, who has received instructions
relative to their transmission to the United States.

With the assurance of my high consideration, etc.

SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary.

EXCHANGES WITH PERU.

On the 16th of May, 1867, the Smithsonian Institution, as the agent
of the United States Government for the exchange of official public
documents with foreign nations as provided for by act of March 2, 1867,
invited, among others, the Government of Peru to participate in- the
proposed exchange. The proposition was favorably received, and the
acceptance, on the part of the Peruvian Government, expressed in a let-
ter emanating from the foreign office in Lima, Peru, on the 380th De-
cember, 1867, and transmitted to the Smithsonian Institution through
the United States Department of State. (See Smithsonian Annual Re-
port for 1881, p. 760, 761; also History of Smithsonian Exchanges,
Washington, 1882, pp. 58-59.)

By some inexplicable oversight this subject was completely lost sight
of until in the beginning of the present fiscal year, when it was again
brought to notice by Mr. Elmore, then the representative of the Peru-
vian Government at Washington, and chief clerk of the Peruvian for-
eign office in 1867, at the time of the acceptance of the proposition on
the part of his Government. :

In consequence relations were at once established, of which the fol-
lowing correspondence is a portion, and which terminated in the trans-

mission, by the Smithsonian Institution, of a set of twenty cases, ad-
dressed to the Government of Peru at Lima:

Prof. Spencer F. Baird to the Secretary of State.

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 2, 1886.

Str: During the administration of my predecessor in office, the la-
mented Professor Henry, a letter dated February 8, 1868, was received
from the then Secretary of State, Hon. William H. Seward, transmit-
ting a note from the foreign office at Lima with reference to a proposi-
tion from this Institution for an exchange of official documents with the
Republic of Peru. Printed copies of this correspondence I inclose.

In some inexplicable way the subject has been entirely lost sight of and
has only just been brought to the light; and I beg to state that the In-
stitution is now anxious to resume negotiations with the Peruvian Gov-
ernment relative to the proposed exchange.

The Smithsonian Institution as the agent for international exchanges
on the part of the United States Government is prepared to furnish the
Government of Peru with a collection of several thousand volumes of
documents published by the United States since 1868. These can be
delivered to the Peruvian consul at New York free of charge. The re-
turns of publications on the part of Peru, which should be full and in
as complete series as possible, should be delivered free of charge to the
United States consulat Callao. The returns will be placed inthe Library
of Congress in accordance with existing law. The Peruvian Govern-

‘Inent, if desirous of renewing its acceptance of the proposition of the

Institution, should, of course, furnish us with the name of the depart-
ment designated to receive the books transmitted on behalf of the
United States.

We should also be pleased to have the Peruvian department to which
the business of the exchange is assigned take charge of and distribute
the miscellaneous scientific exchanges presented by societies and indi-
viduals, through the Smithsonian Institution, to correspondents in that
country, the Institution guaranteeing a like service for any parcels of
Similar character for the United States and Europe.

WASHINGTON, July 31, 1886.
My Drar Sir: I take the liberty to call your attention to a matter of great inter-
est and of much importance for Peru, and which, if the suggestion Iam about to
make is carried out, will be a source of real joy among all Peruvians who desire to

study and know better the United States and who wish to develop their own coun-
try by the arts of peace. I refer to the execution of the agreement in 1867 between
Peru and the United States to exchange their respective Government publications.

This system of international exchanges, authorized by an act of Congress, Mareh
2, 1867, proposed to foreign nations, through the State Department, in a circular by
the Smithsonian Institution, May 16, 1867, was ‘‘accepted in all of its terms” by a
decree of the President of Pern on 27th December, 1867. (See pages 58 and 59 of “A
History of the Smithsonian Exchanges,” by George H. Boehmer, from the Smith-
sonian Report for 1881.)

Through causes too long to state in this letter the exchange with Peru was imper-
fectly carried out, or not at all. Of course Peru, under any circumstances, would be
benefited by the exchanges more than the United States; but it is precisely on this
account that I now beg to be allowed to address you on the subject, because my ob-
ject is to request you to do Pern a great service, now needed more than at any time
before.

It is known that one of the first acts of the Chilians when they occupisd Lima in
1881 was to sack and destroy or carry away completely the whole of the old and
valuable library of Lima. The Peruvian Government in 1383 began to take steps to
form a new library, which has been created, having at present about 30,000 volumes,
mostly the gift of foreign governments and institutions and of literary men and
other private individuals.

During Secretary Frelinghuysen’s time I made some etforts to obtain a few works
of interest from this country, which in 18384 I presented to the new national library
of Lima. But most of the United States publications destined for Peru since 1868
are kept in deposit, packed up in boxes, in the Smithsonian Institution, awaiting the
order of your Government to be sent to the Peruvian Government, who will in return
send to the Smithsonian Institution, for the Library of Congress, a full set of the offi-
cial and other publications of Peru.

As now, after many years of disorder, Peru has a regularly elected constitutional
government, the opportunity to send the Smithsonian exchanges to Peru is most
admirable, and the benefit you will confer on Peru will be very great and will be
fully appreciated.

On the 9th of August, probably, a gentleman of New York, intimately connected
with the commerce of Peru, and whose firm (that of Messrs. W. R. Grace & Co., Han-
over Square, New York) holds important contracts with the Peruvian Government,
leaves for Lima. During a very long time no opportunity so good as this will pre-
sent itself to have the valuable Smithsonian collection sent to Peru. The books are
ready, packed up in about eighteen cases (measuring about 50 cubic feet), and con-
taining over 1,000 volumes.

The United States Government would have no expense in this matter. As usual,
the Smithsonian Institution would forward the cases to. New York, and Messrs. W.
R. Grace & Co. would attend to the shipping for account of the Peruvian Govern-
ment.

I earnestly beg you, Mr. Secretary, to let the books be sent at once to the Govern-
ment of Peru,-as, going as they would, under the personal care of Mr. W. R. Grace,
they would arrive with the greatest safety. The Smithsonian Institution only awaits
your directions to forward the cases to New York.

Believe me, etc.,
J. F. ELMORE.

Sir: Referring to your communication of August 2, in reply to a
letter from this Institution on the same subject, I beg to say that your
suggestion with reference to the publications of the United States for

Minister of foreign relations, Lima, to Hon. T. F. Bayard, Secretary of State.

Lima, Seplember 13, 1886.

Mr. MrnisTER: I have had the honor of receiving the very polite dispatch of your
excellency relative to the exchange of publications between Peru and the United
States.

In reply, I have the pleasure of manifesting to your excellency that my Govern-
ment has a lively desire to maintain the arrangement celebrated in 1867 with the
Smithsonian Institution, having to that end authorized the director of the national
library to make remittances of Peruvian works with such exactness as is possible.

My Government appreciates and esteems at its value this literary exchange between
two sister peoples of similar political institutions, in which is illustrated a spirit re-
dounding in benefits to society.

The library of Lima, which was destroyed by the invading army, has been re-
established through the generous co-operation of friendly Governments and foreign
scientific societies, among which the Smithsonian has distinguished its efforts superior
to all.

My Government desires, in making this expression of its gratitude, that through
the worthy medium of your excellency it be placed in the knowledge of the Secretary
of that Institution, manifesting at the same time that it will not omit efforts to per-
petually comply with the arrangement to which I have referred.

Reiterating with this motive to your excellency assurances of my most high and
distinguished consideration.

M. M. Rivas.

DEFECTS OF THE EXCHANGE SYSTEM.

In carrying on the operations of an international exchange of official
publications, the Smithsonian Institution, as the agent of the United
States Government, experiences two difficulties, which it has for many
years endeavored to overcome, without, however, fully accomplishing
the desired end. é

These obstacles are—

(1) The failure to procure the fifty copies of each and every public
document for exchange purposes; and

(2) The inability to secure, by means of correspondence alone, the
entire fruits of the wise provision of Congress in the way of adequate
returns from foreign Governments for the books sent by us.

The first point has been the subject of repeated appeal to Congress,
and I now beg to present the correspondence illustrating our last effort
in that direction :

The Smithsonian Institution to the Hon. A. R. Spofford, Librarian of
Congress.

WASHINGTON, D. C., February 21, 1887.

Sir: On the 7th of March, 1884, and on October 7, 1885, the Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution had the honor to address the Hon.
John Sherman, chairman of the Joint Library Committee of Congress,
as follows:

‘““After overcoming many obstacles, the Smithsonian system of ex-
changes has now been placed upon a most satisfactory basis, the only
difficulty of any magnitude yet remaining being inability on the part
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 47

of the Smithsonian Institution, as the Government intermediary, to
secure the entire fruit of the wise provision of Congress in the way of
fifty copies of each and every public document for exchange purposes,
and to this extent the system is yet imperfect. In the absence of strict
compliance with the stipulation that all works published by the United
States—its Congress, Executive Departments, Bureaus, etc.—shall be
furnished for the purpose, the Institution can hardly exact from foreign
Governments that have entered into an international exchange alliance
copies of everything they, respectively, issue.

“ T would therefore ask you respectfully to consider the several enact-
ments upon the subject of international exchange, and that such supple-
mentary legislation be provided as will enable us to surmount the diffi-
culty referred to.”

In the absence of any action on the subject as requested, Professor
Baird, on the 18th of January, 1886, addressed himself to the Hon.
William J. Sewell, chairman of the Joint Library Committee of Con-
gress, as follows:

“It again becomes the duty of the Smithsonian Institution, as the
agent for the Government exchanges under appointmentof Congressional
actof March 2, 1867, to suggest a review by the Library Committee of
the several enactments upon the subject of international exchanges, to
the end that such additional legislation be provided as will render the
Institution able to enforce strict compliance (on the part of the Public
Printer and the various Departments aud Bureaus of the Government)
with the order of Congress that all works published by the United States
of America, whether by its Congress, its Executive Departments, or its Bu-
reaus, and whether printed at the Public Printing Office or elsewhere, be
furnished the Smithsonian Institution in fifty copies of each of the three
distinct series, as specified in the acts of March 2, 1867, and July 25, 1865,
and without which the Government of the United States, through the
Library of Congress, will fail to reap the full benefit of that complete
exchange which was intended and desired when the American Congress
first exhibited its enlightened liberality in the wise provision for an ex-
change of United States official publications for those of foreign na-
tions.”

The letter was accompanied by a memorandum specifying the various
enactments ou international exchange, and illustrating the defects of
existing laws on the subject.

No attention, however, was given by the Joint Library Committee to
the request for a consideration of the requirements as pointed out by
the Institution, and the present session of Congress drawing to a close
without any action having been had in relation to it, I beg to invite
your co-operation—as the party most interested in the results of the
' service—by requesting you to bring the matter before the proper com-
mittee, for whose information and guidance, in connection with any new
legislation which it may deem proper to suggest for the consideration
of Congress, I inclose herewith a brief sketch of existing laws on the
subject.

In order to obtain for the international exchange the advantages de-
sired by Congress, the laws governing it should be amended so as to
make it obligatory on the part of the Public Printer, the Executive De-
partments and Bureaus of the Government to furnish the fifty copies
of each and every publication made by them, of whatever class or de-
ae called for by the original acts of March 2, 1867, and July 25,

48 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

{Inclosure.

On the 2d day of March, 1867, Congress passed the following reso-
lution (Stat. at Large, vol. 14, p. 573):

‘Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled, That fifty copies of all documents here-
after printed by order of either House of Congress, and fifty copies ad-
ditional of all documents printed in excess of the usual number, together
with fifty copies of each publication issued by any Department or
Bureau of the Government, be placed at the disposal of the Joint Com-
mittee on the Library, who shall exchange the same, through the agency
of the Smithsonian Institution, for such works published in foreign
countries, and especially by foreign Governments, as may be deemed
by said committee an equivalent; said works to be deposited in the
Library of Congress.”

This resolution provides, as plainly and distinctly expressed, for three
times fifty copies of certain official publications, or, rather, for fifty
copies each of three different and distinct issues into which the publi-
cations of the United States Government may be classed:

I. The Congressional issue, consisting of series of journals, reports of
committees, miscellaneous documents, and executive documents.

IT. The annual reports of the Executive Departments and Bureaus of
the Government.

ITI. The memoirs, monographs, and special reports published by the
Executive Departments and Bureaus of the Government.

Of the first issue (the Congressional), the wsual number printed is, as
prescribed in section 3792 Revised Statutes, ‘fifteen hundred and fifty
copies of any document ordered by Congress,” ete., increased to nineteen
hundred, which includes the installments for distribution by the Con-
gressional Library and for exchange in foreign countries.

Section 3799 provides that ‘“‘of the documents printed by order of
either House of Congress there shall be printed and bound fifty addi-
tional copies for the purpose of exchange in foreign countries.”

The second series is formed by the “ extra copies” ordered to be
printed by Congress in addition to the usual number, and represent the
annual report of the Executive Departments and Bureaus of the Gov-
ernment, Reports on Foreign Affairs, Commerce and Navigation, Com-
mercial Relations, etc., and as such form each an independent series of
Government publications.

Relative to this issue, section 3796 Revised Statutes provides: ‘ The
Congressional Printer shall, when so directed by the Joint Committee
on the Library, print in addition to the usual number either fifty or one
hundred copies, as he may be directed, of all documents printed by
either House of Congress or by any Department or Bureau of the Gov-
ernment.

Resolution No. 72, second session Fortieth Congress (approved July 25,
1868), a resolution to carry into effect the resolution approved March 2,
1867, providing for the exchange of certain public documents, specifies :
‘* That the Congressional Printer, whenever he shall be so directed by
the Joint Committee on the Library, be, and he hereby is, directed to
print fifty copies in addition to the regular number of all documents
hereafter printed by order of either House of Congress, or by order of
any Department or Bureau of the Government, and whenever he shall

_be so directed by the Joint Committee on the Library, one hundred
copies additional of all documents ordered to be printed in excess of the
usual number ; said fifty or one hundred copies to be delivered to the
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 49

Librarian of Congress, to be exchanged under the direction of the Joint
Committee on the Library, as provided for by joint resolution approved
March 2, 1867.”

The third series, the memoirs, monographs, or special reports pub-
lished by the Executive Departments and Bureaus of the Government,
is provided for by section 2 of the above joint resolution No. 72, sec-
ond session Fortieth Congress, approved July 25, 1868—a resolution to
carry into effect the resolution approved March 2, 1867, providing for
the exchange of certain public documents, as follows: ‘ And be tt further
resolved, That fifty copies of each publication, printed under the direc-
tion of any Department or Bureau of the Government, whether at the
Congressional Printing Oftice or elsewhere, shall be placed at the dis-
posal of the Joint Committee on the Library to carry out the provision
of said resolution.”

Subsequent to this resolution becoming a law the Hon. EH. D. Morgan,
chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library, addressed the fol-
lowing letter to the Public Priater, J. D. Defrees, esq. :

‘““ WASHINGTON, D. C., October 24, 1868.

‘““T have the honor to eall your attention to the provisions of the reso-
lution of Congress inclosed, approved July 25, 1868, and to request that
the fifty copies of all documents now being printed and hereafter to be
printed at the Congressional Printing Office, whether by order of either
House of Congress or any of the Departments or Bureaus of the Gov-
ernment, be furnished by you, as fast as each edition is printed and
bound, to the Librarian of Congress, for the purpose specified in the
resolution.

‘““T would also request that of the Patent Office report and Agricult-
ural report now being printed one hundred copies additional (or one
hundred and fifty copies in all) be delivered to the Librarian for the pur-
pose indicated.”

On September 22, 1869, the Librarian of Congress addressed the
Public Printer, on the subject of books required by law for the inter-
national exchange of official documents as follows:

‘“ Your attention is respectfully called to the provisions of the reso-
lution of Congress approved July 25, 1868, requiring the Congressional
Printer to furnish to the Librarian of Congress fifty copies of all docu-
ments printed under whatever authority for the purpose of exchanging
the same for the publications of foreign Governments, which are to be
deposited in this Library.

‘“ The official direction from the chairman of the Joint Committee on
the Library, to printand deliver these documents required by the resolu-
tion, was communicated to your predecessor, Mr. J. D. Defrees, on the 24th
of October, 1868. (See letter of Hon. E. D. Morgan, chairman, of that
date.) The only reply received was a verbal one from Mr. Defrees, to
the undersigned, that the documents should be regularly forwarded,
and that the one hundred and fifty copies (fifty regular and one hundred
extra) of the Agricultural and Patent Office reports for 1867, then on
the press, would also be supplied. Not having received any documents
whatever under this act of Congress, and the purpose of the same being
to enrich the Library with as large a number and variety of the docu-
ments of foreign Governments as can be procured in exchange for our
own, you are requested to have placed at my disposal fifty copies of
each book, pamphlet, circular, army order, or other publication, by
whatever authority printed, and one hundred copies additional of all

50 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

documents printed in excess of the usual number, to enable me to carry
out the resolution of Congress referred to.”

And again in reply to an inquiry on the part of the Public Printer,
the following communication was addressed to that official on Septem-
ber 30, 1869:

“In reference to the documents not of Congress, but of the Depart-
ments and Bureaus of the Government, of which fifty copies are required
by resolution of Congress to be furnished to the Library for interna-
tional exchange, I have to say that all such documents as are printed
at the public expense (with the single exception of printed instructions
or confidential official communications) are important and will properly
be furnished. The foreign Governments with which the exchanges are
made furnish us with great fullness the specially printed documents they
print in each department of their public service, and itis desired to
make a return in kind.”

Owing to the failure of the Public Printer to comply with those por-
tions of the law relating to the second and third series of the United
States official publications, the annual reports of the Executive De-
partments and Bureaus of the Government, and the memoirs, mono-
graphs, and special reports by the Executive Departments and Bureaus
of the Government, although ovcasionally some few of the works of
these classes have been received, a circular letter was addressed by
the Smithsonian Institution on the 15th of February, 1884, to all the
Departments and Bureaus of the Government, soliciting co-operation,
in compliance with the existing laws, to enable the Institution, as
agent of the Government, to carry out the provisions of the Congres-
sional resolutions.

Among the replies received, that of the Hon. Secretary of State
Says:

I have ventured to suggest to the Joint Committee on the Library
the desirability of a permanent provision for the printing of these re-
quired copies.

Appended to the letter of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti.
tution of March 7, 1884, is a list of the more important documents not
furnished to the Smithsonian Institution although they are embraced
in the series intended by Congress for exchange purposes.

Among the documents not furnished by the Public Printer may
again be mentioned the following (assuming series I, the Congressional
issue, to be complete as delivered, although even therein are many de-
ficiencies) :

Series Il. The annual reports of the Executive Departments and Bu-
reaus of the Government, together with the papers accompanying such
reports. (Section 3796, Rev. Stat., and Resol. 72, second sess. Fortieth
Congr.)

Series IIT. The memoirs, monographs, or special reports published by
the Executive Departments or Bureaus of the Government, whether
printed at the Government Printing Office, or elsewhere. (Section 2,
Resolution No, 72, second session Fortieth Congr.)
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 51

This last series comprises, among many others, the following valuable
publications :
Patent Office :
Official Gazette—thirty-two volumes published.
Specifications and Drawings—two hundred volumes published
since 1872.
Growth of Industrial Art—two volumes, folio. Of this only fifty
copies were printed.
U. S. Geological Survey : :
Bulletins—thirty numbers issued.
Monographs—eleven volumes issued, of which only Vol. 11 and At-
las were received. :

A letter was addressed to the Director of the Survey, February 18,
1884, claiming fifty copies of all the publications of that office for ex-
change purposes under the law. In reply the Director states, Febru-
ary 26, 1884:

Under the law of March 2, 1867, fifty copies of everything published
by us should be sent to the Library of Congress, and thence to the
Smithsonian Institution by the Public Printer, and such copies are re-
served for’ that purpose, and do not come into our possession.

Under the statutes relating to the publication of the monographs of
the Geological Survey it would be impossible to spare any copies from
the three thousand received by this office from the fact that it is neces-
ary for the Survey to render an account of its publications, either as
sold, exchanged, or on hand.

Ethnological Bureau :
Contributions to North American Ethnology. Only vols. 1, 3, and
4 received.
Pilling: Proof-sheets of North American Languages. Of this only
one hundred copies were printed.

Tenth Census of the United States :
Monographs. Not one has been received.

Fish Commission :
Bulletins, vols. 1-5.

State Department:
Consular Reports. Only the first twenty-two have been received,

Coast and Geodetic Survey:
Publications.

American and Foreign Claims Commissions:

France, Hayti, Spain, Alabama, etc., neither of which has been re-
ceived.

And, in fact, all the publications of the Departments and Bureaus of
the Government, as independent series, although they may have been
furnished as Congressional (miscellaneous) documents, which, however,
constitute a distinct series (I) in themselves.
52 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

The second point, the inability to secure the entire fruits of the pro-
visions of Congress, in the way of adequate returns, was fully discussed
by Professor Baird on page 20 of the Annual Report of the Smithson-
ian Institution for 1885, by Mr. Spofford, the Librarian of Congress, on
pages 25 and 26 of the Smithsonian Report for the fiscal year 1885~86,
and by myself, in the appendix to each of these reports.

The remedy suggested in the case was based on the experience of my
mission to Europe, and the predictions ventured that, without the es-
tablishment of a permanent agency on the ground to attend personally
to the whole business, only temporary results would be obtained, are
fully borne out by the experience of the past year.

While the returns secured by my personal efforts comprise 44 cases
and 160 packages of books, numbering about 7,000 volumes, collected
from fourteen European Governments, the returns of the present year
received from European Governments through the medium of the ex:
change service represent only 3 boxes and about 250 volumes of books.
GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1886-87.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX is to furnish summaries of
scientific discovery in particular directions; occasional reports of the
investigations made by collaborators of the Institution; memoirs of a
general character or on special topics, whether original and prepared
expressly for the purpose, or selected from foreign journals and proceed-
ings; and briefly to present (as fully as space will permit) such papers
not published in the “‘Smithsonian Contributions” or in the “ Miscella-
neous Collections” as may be supposed to be of interest or value to the
numerous correspondents of the Institution.

5d
RECORD OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS.

INTRODUCTION.

While it has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution, from a very early date in its history, to enrich
the annual report required of them by law, with scientific memoirs illus-
trating the more remarkable and important developments in physical
and biological discovery, as well as showing the general character of
the operations of the Institution, this purpose had not been carried out
on any very systematic plan. Believing however that an annual report
or summary of the recent advances made in the leading departments
of scientific inquiry would supply a want very generally felt, and would
be favorably received by all those interested in the diffusion of knowl-
edge, the Secretary had prepared for the report of 1880, by competent
collaborators, a series of abstracts showing concisely the prominent
features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology, physics,
chemistry, mineralogy, botony, zodlogy, and anthropology.

The same general programme has been followed in the subsequent
reports, until the last, that for 1886, when the incompleteness of the
record obtained, the discouragement from the increasing delay encoun-
tered in the printing of the annual summaries, and other considera-
tions, induced the temporary suspension of the project. The postponed
contributions are herewith presented, with the regret that the expected
articles on meteorology and on botany are unavoidably omitted by
reason of the pressing occupations of Professors Abbe and Farlow,
their accustomed expositors, having prevented the undertaking.

With every effort to secure prompt attention to the more important
details of a general survey of the annual progress of scientific discov-
ery, experience has shown that various unexpected delays render it
impracticable to obtain all the desired reports in each department within
the time prescribed ; and the plan attempted of bringing up the defi-
ciencies in subsequent reports has not proved entirely satisfactory.

An appropriate introduction to the annual record is found in Professor
Huxley’s excellent sketeh of the Advance of Science in the Last Half
Century, which is herewith reprinted by permission of the publisher
and of the author. This paper is one of a series setting forth the legis-
lative, political, and civil condition of England during the reign of Queen
Victoria, the progress of the nation in industrial arts, education, sci-

56 RECORD OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS.

ence, literature, arts, etc., as a memorial of the jubilee year of the
Queen, which was celebrated June 20, 1887. This semi-centennial cor-
responds—not, indeed, with the period of the life of the Smithsonian
Institution, but with the interval from the time of secaring the Smith-
son fund to the United States. The formal organization of the Insti-
tution was not effected till nearly ten years later.

Notwithstanding the acknowledged educational value of these gen-
eral summaries of the annual advances of scientific investigation, and the
popular interest that has been manifested in this feature of the Smith-
sonian Reports, varions difficulties in the practical execution of the
scheme have arisen to render the continuance of the experiment of
doubtiul expediency. In view of the numerous important fields of
scientific inquiry which have been necessarily omitted from the pro-
gramme, for lack of space for their presentation, (such as mathematics,
physiology, microscopy, ete.,) as well as of the entire domain of the
more popular topics embraced in the practical applications of science,
(such as horticultural and agricultural economy, engineering, mechanics,
and technology in general,)—the policy of attempting so inadequate a
survey of intellectual and industrial advancement, with its ever-increas-
ing range and complexity of development, may well be questioned. To
all this must be added the consideration that the numerous demands
upon the limited Smithsonian fund render it unable to bear the burden
that a just award to the collaborators engaged would require from it.

Accordingly after perhaps another year of the more systematic treat-
ment of scientific progress as latterly undertaken, it is probable that it
may be thought advisable to revert to the earlier plan of publishing
each year a number of papers possessing a popular interest—selected
from foreign and domestic scientific journals or the Proceedings and
Transactions of learned societies, together with such original articles as
may appear to deserve general attention.
ADVANCE OF SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.*

By lan Buximy, 1. 5R. 8:

The most obvious and the most distinctive feature of the history of
civilization during the last fifty years is the wonderful increase of in-
dustrial production by the application of machinery, the improvement
of old technical processes and the invention of new ones, accompanied
by an even more remarkable development of old and new means of lo-
comotion and inter-communication. By this rapid and vast multiplica-
tion of the commodities and conveniences of existence, the general
standard of comfort has been raised; the ravages of pestilence and
famine have been checked; and the natural obstacles, which time and
space offer to mutual intercourse, have been reduced in a manner and
to an extent unknown to former ages. The diminution or removal of
local ignorance and prejudice, the creation of common interests among
the most widely separated peoples, and the strengthening of the forces
of the organization of the commonwealth against those of political or
social anarchy, thus effected, have exerted an influence on the present
and future fortunes of mankind the full significance of which may be
divined, but can not as yet be estimated at its full value.

This revolution—for it is nothing less—in the political and social as-
pects of modern civilization has been preceded, accompanied, and in
great measure caused by a less obvious, but no less marvellous, increase
of natural knowledge, and especially of that part of it which is known
as physical science, in consequence of the application of scientific
method to the investigation of the phenomena of the material world.
Not that the growth of physical science is an exclusive prerogative of
the Victorian age. Its present strength and volume merely indicate
the highest level of a stream which took its rise, alongside of the primal
founts of Philosophy, Literature, and Art, in ancient Greece ; and, after

sages of antiquity who for eight centuries, from the time of Thales to
that of Galen, toiled at the foundations of physical science. But, with-
out entering into the discussion of that large question, it is certain that
the labors of these early workers in the field of natural knowledge were
brought to a standstill by the decay and disruption of the Roman Em-
pire, the consequent disorganization of society, and the diversion of
men’s thoughts from sublunary matters to the problems of the super-
natural world suggested by Christian dogma in the Middle Ages. And,
notwithstanding sporadic attempts to recall men to the investigation of
nature here and there, it was not until the fifteenth and sixteenth cen-
turies that physical science made a new start, founding itself at first
altogether upon that which had been done by the Greeks. Indeed, it
must be admitted that the men of the Renaissance, though standing on
the shoulders of the old philosophers, were a long time before they saw
as much as their forerunners had done.

The first serious attempts to carry further the unfinished work of
Archimedes, Hipparchus, and Ptolemy, of Aristotle and of Galen,
naturally enough arose among the astronomers and the physicians.
Hor the imperious necessity of seeking some remedy for the physical
ills of life had insured the preservation of more or less of the wisdom
of Hippocrates and his successors, and, by a happy conjunction of cir-
cumstances, the Jewish and Arabian physicians and philosophers
escaped many of the influences which at that time blighted natural
knowledge in the Christian world. On the other hand, the supersti-
tious hopes and fears which afforded countenance to astrology and to
alchemy also sheltered astronomy and the germs of chemistry.
Whether for this or for some better reason the founders of the schools
of the Middle Ages included astrenomy along with geometry, arith-
metic, and music as one of the four branches of advanced education,
and in this respect it is only just to them to observe that they were far
in advance of those who sit in their seats. The schoolmen considered
no one to be properly educated unless he were acquainted with—at any
rate—one branch of physical science. We have not even yet reached
that stage of enlightenment.

In the early decades of the seventeenth century the men of the Re-
naissance could show that they had already put out to good interest the
treasure bequeathed to them by the Greeks. They had produced the
astronomical system of Copernicus, with Kepler’s great additions; the
astronomical discoveries and the physical investigations of Galileo; the
mechanics of Stevinus and the “De Magnete” of Gilbert; the anatomy
of the great French and Italian schools and the physiology of Harvey.
In Italy, which had succeeded Greece in the hegemony of the scientific
world, the Accademia dei Lyncei, and sundry other such associations
for the investigation of nature, the models of all subsequent academies
and scientific societies, had been founded, while the literary skill and
biting wit of Galileo had made the great scientific questions of the day
not only intelligible, but attractive, to the general public.
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 59
FRANCIS BACON.

In our own country Francis Bacon had essayed to sum up the past of
physical seience, and to indicate the path which it must follow if its
ereat destinies were to be fulfilled. And though the attempt was just
such a magnificent failure as might have been expected from a man of
great endowments, who was so singularly devoid of scientific insight
that he could not understand the value of the work already achieved by
the true instaurators of physical science, yet the majestic eloquence
and the fervid vaticinations of one who was conspicuous alike by the
greatness of his rise and the depth of his fall, drew the attention of all
the world to the ‘‘new birth of Time.”

. But it is not easy to discover satisfactory evidence that the ‘* Novum
Organum” had any direct beneficial influence on the advancement of
natural knowledge. No delusion is greater than the notion that method
and industry can make up for lack of mother wit, either in science or
in practical life, and it is strange that, with his knowledge of mankind,
Bacon should have dreamed that his or any other ‘ via inveniendi sci-
entias” would “level men’s wits” and leave little scope for that inborn
capacity which is called genius. As a matter of fact, Bacon’s “ via”
has proved hopelessly impracticable, while the “ Anticipation of Na-
ture,” by the invention of hypotheses based on incomplete inductions,
which he specially condemns, has proved itself to be a most efficient,
indeed an indispensable, instrument of scientific progress. Finally,
that transcendental alchemy, the superinducement of new forms on mat-
ter, which Bacon declares to be the supreme aim of science, has been
wholly ignored by those who have created the physical knowledge of
the present day.

Even the eloquent advocacy of the chancellor brought no unmixed
good to physical science. It was natural enough that the man who, in
his better moments, took ‘ali knowledge for his patrimony,” but, in his
worse, sold that birthright for the mess of pottage of court favor and
professional success, for pomp and show, should be led to attach an
undue value to the practical advantages which he foresaw, as Roger
Bacon and, indeed, Seneca had foreseen, long before his time, must
follow in the train of the advancement of natural knowledge. The
burden of Bacon’s pleadings for science is the “ gathering of fruit ”—the
importance of winning solid material advantages by the investigation
of nature and the desirableness of limiting the application of scientific
methods of inquiry to that field.

THOMAS HOBBES.

Bacon’s younger contemporary, Hobbes, casting aside the prudent
reserve of his predecessor in regard to those matters about which the
Crown or the Church might have something to say, extended scientific
methods of inquiry to the phenomena of mind and the problems of
60 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

social organization; while, at the same time, he indicated the boundary
between the province of real, and that of imaginary, knowledge. The
‘Principles of Philosophy” and the “Leviathan” embody a coherent
system of purely scientific thought in language which is*a model of
clear and vigorous English style.

DESCARTES.

At the same time, in France, a man of far greater scientific capacity
than either Bacon or Hobbes, René Descartes, not only in his immortal
“Discours de la Méthode” and elsewhere, went down to the foundations
of scientific certainty, but, in his ‘* Principes de Philosophie,” indicated
where the goal of physical science really lay. However, Descartes was
an eminent mathematician, and it would seem that the bent of his mind
led him to over-estimate the value of deductive reasoning from general
principles, as much as Bacon had under-estimated it. The progress of
physical science has been effected neither by Baconians nor by Cartes-
ians—as such, but by men like Galileo and Harvey, Boyle and Newton,
who would have done their work just as well if neither Bacon nor Des-
cartes had ever propounded his views respecting the manner in which
scientific investigation should be pursued.

PROGRESS WITHOUT “FRUITS.”

The progress of science, during the first century after Bacon’s death,
by no means Verified his sanguine prediction of the fruits which it would
yield. For, though the revived and renewed study of nature had spread
and grown to an extent which surpassed reasonable expectation, the
practical results—the ‘‘good to men’s estate”—were at first by no
means apparent. Sixty years after Bacon’s death, Newton had crowned
the long labors of the astronomers and the physicists by co-ordinating
the phenomena of molar motion throughout the visible universe into one
vast system; but the “ Principia” helped no man to either wealth or
comfort. Descartes, Newton, and Leibnitz had opened up new worlds
tothe mathematician, but the acquisitions of their genius enriched only
man’s ideal estate. Descartes had laid the foundations of rational
cosmogony and of physiological psychology; Boyle had produced models
of experimentation in various branches of physics and chemistry; Pascal
and Torricelli had weighed the air; Malpighi and Grew, Ray and Wil-
loughby had done work of no less importance in the biological sciences;
but weaving and spinning were carried on with the old appliances;
nobody could travel faster by sea or by land than at any previous time
in the world’s history, and King George could send a message from
London to York no faster than King John might have done. Metals
were worked from their ores by immemorial rule of thumb, and the
center of the iron trade of these islands was still among the oak forests
of Sussex. The utmost skill of our mechanicians did not get beyond
the production of a coarse watch.
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 61

The middle of the eighteenth century is illustrated by a host of great
names in science—English, French, German, and Italian,—especially in
the fields of chemistry, geology, and biology; but this deepening and
broadening of natural knowledge produced next to no immediate prac-
tical benefits. Even if,at this time, Francis Bacon could have returned
to the scene of his greatness and of his littleness, he must have re-
garded the philosophic world which praised and disregarded his pre-
cepts with great disfavor. If ghosts are consistent he would have
said, “These people are all wasting their time, just as Gilbert and Kep-
ler and Galileo and my worthy physician Harvey did in my day.
Where are the fruits of the restoration of science which I promised?
This accumulation of bare knowledge is all very well, but cui bono?
Not one of these people is doing what I told him specially to do, and
seeking that secret of the cause of forms which will enable men to deal
at will with matter, and super-induce new natures upon the old founda.
tions.”

LATER PRACTICAL EFFECT.

But, a little later, that growth of knowledge beyond imaginable utili-
tarian ends, which is the condition precedent of its practical utility,
began to produce some effect upon practical life; and the operation of
that part of nature we call human upon the rest began to create, not
‘new natures,” in Bacon’s sense, but a new Nature, the existence of
which is dependent upon men’s efforts, which is subservient to their
wants, and which would disappear if man’s shaping and guiding hand
were withdrawn. [Every mechanical artifice, every chemically pure
substance employed in manufacture, every abnormally fertile race of
plants, or rapidly growing and fattening breed of animals, is a part of
the new Nature created by science. Without it the most densely pop-
ulated regions of modern Europe and America must retain their primi-
tive, sparsely inhabited, agricultural or pastoral condition: it is the
foundation of our wealth and the condition of our safety from submer-
gence by another flood of barbarous hordes; it is the bond which unites
into a solid political whole, regions larger than any empire of antiquity ;
it secures us from the recurrence of the pestilences and famines of
former times; it is the source of endless comforts and conveniences,
which are not mere luxuries, but conduce to physical and moral well-
being. During the last fifty years, this new birth of time, this new
Nature begotten by science upon fact, has pressed itself daily and

hourly upon our attention, and has worked miracles which have modi-
fied the whole fashion of our lives.

What wonder, then, if these astonishing fruits of the tree of knowl-
edge are too often regarded by both friends and enemies as the be-all
and end-all of science? What wonder if some eulogize, and others
revile, the new philosophy for its utilitarian ends and its merely ma-
terial triumphs ?
62 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

In truth, the new philosophy deserves neither the praise of its eulo-
gists, nor the blame of its slanderers. As I have pointed out, 1ts disciples
were guided by no search after practical fruits during the great period
of its growth, and it reached adolescence without being stimulated by
any rewards of that nature. The bare enumeration of the names of the
men who were the great lights of science in the latter part of the eight-
eenth and the first decade of the nineteenth century, of Herschel, of
Laplace, of Young, of Fresnel, of Oersted, of Cavendish, of Lavoisier,
of Davy, of Lamarck, of Cuvier, of Jussieu, of Decandolle, of Werner,
and of Hutton, suffices to indicate the strength of physical science in
the age immediately preceding that of which I have to treat. But of
which of these great men can it be said that his labors were directed
to practical ends? I do not cail to mind even an invention of practical
utility which we owe to any of them, except the safety-lamp of Davy.
Werner certainly paid attention to mining, and I have not forgotten
James Watt. But, though some of the most important of the improve-
ments by which Watt converted the steam-engine, invented long before
his time, into the obedient slave of man, were suggested and guided by
his acquaintance with scientific principles, his skill as a practical mech-
anician and the efficieucy of Bolton’s workmen had quite as much to
do with the realization of his projects.

LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE.

In fact, the history of physical science teaches (and we can not too
carefully take the lesson to heart) that the practical advantages, attain-
able through its agency, never have been, and never will be, sufficiently
attractive to men inspired by the inborn genius of the interpreter of
nature, to give them courage to undergo the toils and make the sacri-
fices which that calling requires from its votaries. That which stirs
their pulses is the love of knowledge and the joy of the discovery of the
causes of things sung by the old poets; the supreme delight of extend-
ing the realm of law and order ever farther towards the unattainable
goals of the infinitely great and the infinitely small, between which our
little race of lifeisrun. In the course of this work, the physical philos-
opher, sometimes intentionally, much more often unintentionally, lights
upon something which proves to be of practical value. Great is the
rejoicing of those who are benefited thereby; and, for the moment,
science is the Diana of all the craftsmen. But, even while the cries of
jubilation resound, and this flotsam and jetsam of the tide of investi-
gation is being turned into the wages of workmen and the wealth of
capitalists, the crest of the wave of scientific investigation is far away
on its course over the illimitable ocean of the unknown.

SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY RECIPROCALLY DEPENDENT.

Far be it from me to depreciate the value of the gifts of science to
practical life, or to cast a doubt upon the propriety of the course of ac-
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 63

tion of those who follow science in the hope of finding wealth alongside
truth, or even wealth alone. Such a profession is as respectable as any
other. And quite as little do I desire to ignore the fact that, if industry
owes a heavy debt to science, it has largely repaid the loan by the inm-
portant aid which it has, in its turn, rendered to the advancement of
science. In considering the causes which hindered the progress of
physical knowledge in the schools of Athens and of Alexandria, it has
often struck me* that where the Greeks did wonders was in just those
branches of science, such as geometry, astronomy, and anatomy, which
are susceptible of very considerable development without any, or any
but the simplest, appliances. It is a curious speculation to think what
would have become of modern physical science if glass and alcohol had
not been easily obtainable; and if the gradual perfection of mechanical
skill for industrial ends had not enabled investigators to obtain, at com-
paratively little cost, microscopes, telescopes, and all the exquisitely
delicate apparatus for determining weight and measure and for estimat-
ing the lapse of time with exactness, which they now command. If
science has rendered the colossal development of modern industry pos-
sible, beyond a doubt industry has done no less for modern physics and
chemistry, and for a great deal of modern biology. And as the captains
of industry have at last begun to be aware that the condition of suc-
cess in that warfare, under the forms of peace, which is kuown as in-
dustrial competition lies in the discipline of the troops and the use of
arms of precision, just as much as it does in the warfare which is called
war, their demand for that discipline, which is technical education, is
re-acting upon science in a manner which will assuredly stimulate its
future growth to an incalculable extent. It kas become obvious that
the interests of science and of industry are identical; that sciencé can
not make a step forward without sooner or later opening up new
channels for industry, and on the other hand, that every advance of
industry facilitates those experimental investigations upon which the
growth of science depends. We may hope that at last the weary mis-
understanding between the practical men who professed to despise
science, and the high and dry philosophers who professed to despise
practical results, is at an end.

Nevertheless, that which is true of the infancy of physical science in
the Greek world, that which is true of its adolescence in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, remains true of its riper age in these latter
days of the nineteenth century. The great steps in its progress have
been made, are made, and will be made, by men who seek knowledge
simply because they crave it. They have their weaknesses, their follies,
their vanities, and their rivalries, like the rest of the world; but what-
ever by-ends may mar their dignity and impede their usefulness, this

* There are excellent remarks to the same effect in Zeller’s Philosophie der Griechen,

pp. 138 et seq.
64 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

chief end redeems them.* Nothing great in science has ever been done
by men, whatever their powers, in whom the divine afflatus of the
truth-seeker was wanting. Men of moderate capacity have done great
things because it animated them; and men of great natural gifts have
failed, absolutely or relatively, because they lacked this one thing
needful.

TRUE OBJECT OF RESEARCH.

To any one who knows the business of investigation practically,
Bacon’s notion of establishing a company of investigators to work for
“fruits,” as if the pursuit of knowledge were a kind of mining opera-
tion and only required well directed picks and shovels, seems very
strange.t In science, as in art, and, as I believe, in every other sphere
of human activity, there may be wisdom in a multitude of counsellors,
but it is only in one or two of them. And in scientific inquiry at any
rate, it is to that one or two that we must look for hight and guidance.
Newton said that he made his discoveries by “intending” his mind on
the subject; no doubt truly. But to equal his success one must have
the mind which he “intended.” Forty lesser men might have intended
their minds till they cracked, without any like result. It would be idle
either to affirm or to deny that the last half century has produced men
of science of the caliber of Newton. It is sufficient that it can show a
few capacities of the first rank, competent not only to deal profitably
with the inheritance bequeathed by their scientific forefathers, but to
pass on to their successors physical truths of a higher order than any
yet reached by the human race. And if they have succeeded as New-
ton succeeded, it is because they have sought truth as he sought it, with
no other object than the finding it.

PROGRESS FROM 1837 TO 1887.

IT am conscious that in undertaking to give even the briefest sketch
of the progress of physical science, in all its branches, during the last

* Fresnel, after a brilliant career of discovery in some of the most difficult regions
of physico-mathematical science, died at thirty-nine years of age. The following pas-
sage of a letter from him to Young (written in November, 1824), quoted by Whewell,
so aptly illustrates the spirit which animates the scientific inquirer, that I may cite it:

‘‘For a long time that sensibility, or that vanity, which people call love of glory
is much blunted in me. I labor much less to catch the suffrages of the public than
to obtain an inward approval which has always been the mental reward of my efforts.
Without doubt I have often wanted the spur of vanity to excite me to pursue my re-
searches in monients of disgust and discouragement. But all the compliments which
I have received from MM. Arago, De Laplace, or Biot, never gave me so much pleas-
ure as the discovery of a theoretical truth or the confirmation of a calculation by ex-
periment.”

t ‘“Mémorable exemple de ’impuissance des recherches collectives appliquées a la
découverte des vérités nouvelles,” says one of the most distinguished of living French
savants, of the corporate chemical work of the old Académie des Sciences. (See Ber-
thelot, Science et Philosophie, p. 201.)
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 65

half century, I may be thought to have exhibited more courage than
discretion, and perhaps more presumption than either. So far as phys-
ical science is concerned, the days of Adntirable Crichtons have long
been over, and the most indefatigable of hard workers may think he
has done well if he has mastered one of its minor subdivisions. Never-
theless, it is possible for any one who has familiarized himself with the
operations of science in one department, to comprehend the significance,
and even to form a general estimate of the value, of the achievements
of specialists in other departments.

Nor is there any lack either of guidance, or of aids to ignorance. By
a happy chance, the first edition of Whewell’s “ History of the Induce-
tive Sciences” was published in 1837, and it affords a very useful view
of the state of things at the commencement of the Victorian epoch. As
to subsequent events, there are numerous excellent summaries of the
progress of various branches of science, especially up to 1881, which
was the jubilee year of the British Association.* And, with respect to
the biological sciences, with some parts of which my studies have fa-
miliarized me, my personal experience nearly coincides with the pre-
ceding half century. I may hope therefore that my chance of escap-
ing serious errors is aS good as that of any one else who might have
been persuaded to undertake the somewhat perilous enterprise in which
I find myself engaged.

There is yet another prefatory remark which it seems desirable I
should make. It is that I think it proper to confine myself to the work
done, without saying anything about the doers of it. Meddling with
questions of merit and priority is a thorny business at the best of times,
and, unless in case of necessity, altogether undesirable when one is
dealing with contempdéraries. No such necessity lies upon me; and
I shall therefore mention no names of living men, lest perchance I
should incur the reproof which the Israelites, who struggled with one
another in the field, addressed to Moses, ‘ Who made thee a prince and
a judge over us?”

AIM OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE.

Physical science is one and indivisible. AJthough for practical pur-
poses it is convenient to mark it out into the primary regions of Phys-
ics Chemistry, and Biology, and to subdivide these into subordinate
provinces, yet the method of investigation and the ultimate object of
the physical inquirer are everywhere the same.

The object is the discovery of the rational order which pervades the
universe; the method consists of observation and experiment (which
is observation under artificial conditions) for the determination of the

*I am particularly indebted to my friend and colleague Professor Riicker, F. R. S.,
for the many acute criticisms and suggestions on my remarks respecting the ultimate
problems of physics, with which he has favored me, and by which I have greatly
profited.

H. Miss. 600-——5
66 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

facts of nature, of inductive and deductive reasoning for the discovery
of their mutual relations and connection. The various branches of
physical science differ in the extent to which, at any given moment of
their history, observation on the one hand, or ratiocination on the
other, is their more obvious feature, but in no other way; and nothing
can be more incorrect than the assumption one sometimes meets with,
that physics has one method, chemistry another, and biology a third.

POSTULATES.

All physical science starts from certain postulates. One of them is
the objective existence of a material world. It is assumed that the
phenomena which are comprehended under this name have a “sub-
stratum” of extended, impenetrable, mobile substance, which exhibits
the quality known as inertia, and is termed matter.* Another postu-

late is the universality of the law of causation; that nothing happens
without a cause (that is, a necessary precedent condition), and that the
state of the physical universe, at any given moment, is the consequence
of its state at any preceding moment. Another is that any of the rules,
or so-called ‘‘laws of nature,” by which the relation of phenomena is
truly defined, is true for all time. The validity of these postulates is a
problem of metaphysics; they are neither self-evident nor are they,
strictly speaking, demonstrable. The justification of their employ-
ment, as axioms of physical philosophy, lies in the circumstance that
expectations logically based upon them are verified, or, at any rate,
not contradicted, whenever they can be tested by experience.

HYPOTHESES.

Physical science therefore rests on verified or uncontradicted hypoth-
eses; and such being the case, it is not surprising that a great con-
dition of its progress has been the jnvention of verifiable hypotheses.
It is a favorite popular delusion that the scientific inquirer is under a
sort of moral obligation to abstain from going beyond that generaliza-
tion of observed facts which is absurdly called ‘“ Baconian ” induction.
But any one whois practically acquainted with scientific work is aware

*Iam aware that this proposition may be challenged. It may be said, for exam-
ple, that, on the hypothesis of Boscovich, matter has no extension, being reduced to
mathematical points serving as centers of ‘‘forces.” But as the ‘‘forces” of the
various centers are conceived to limit one another’s action in such a manner that
an area around each center has an individuality of its own, extension comes back in
the form of that area. Again, a very eminent mathematician and physicist, the late
Clerk Maxwell, has declared that impenetrability is not essential to our notions of
matter, and that two atoms may conceivably occupy the same space. I am loth to
dispute any dictum of a philosopher as remarkable for the subtlety of his intellect as
for his vast knowledge; but the assertion that one and the same point or area of
space can have different (conceivably opposite) attributes appears to me to violate
the principle of contradiction, which is the foundation not only of physical science,
but of logic in general. It means that A can be not-A.
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 67

that those who refuse to go beyond fact rarely get as far as fact; and
any one who has studied the history of science knows that almost every
great step therein has been made by the “ anticipation of nature,” that
is, by the invention of hypotheses, which though verifiable, often had
very little foundation to start with; and not unfrequently, in spite of a
long career of usefulness, turned out to be wholly erroneous in the
long run.

HYPOTHESES FRUITFUL EVEN WHEN ERRONEOUS.

The geocentric system of astronomy, with its eccentrics and its epi-
cycles, was an hypothesis utterly at variance with fact, which never-
theless did great things for the advancement of astronomical knowledge.
Kepler was the wildest of guessers. Newton’s corpuscular theory of
light was of much temporary use in optics, though nobody now believes
in it; and the undulatory theory, which has superseded the corpus-
cular theory, and has proved one of the most fertile of instruments of
research, is based on the hypothesis of the existence of an “ wether,” the
properties of which are defined in propositions, some of which, to ordi-
nary apprehension, seem physical antinomies.

It sounds paradoxical to say that the attainment of scientific truth
has been effected, to a great extent, by the help of scientific errors.
But the subject-matter of physical science is furnished by observation,
which can not extend beyond the limits of our faculties; while, even
within those limits, we can not be certain that any observation 1s abso-
lutely exact and exhaustive. Hence it follows that any given generali-
zation from observation may be true, within the limits of our powers of
observation at a given time, and yet turn out to be untrue, when those
powers of observation are directly or indirectly enlarged. Or, to put
the matter in another way, a doctrine which is untrue absolutely, may
to a very great extent be susceptible of an interpretation in accordance
with the truth. Atacertain period in the history of astronomical science
the assumption that the planets move in circles was true enough to
serve the purpose of correlating such observations as were then possible ;
after Kepler, the assumption that they move in ellipses became true
enough in regard to the state of observational astronomy at that time.
We say still that the orbits of the planets are ellipses, because, for all
ordinary purposes, that is a sufficiently near approximation to the truth ;
but, as a matter of fact, the center of gravity of a planet describes
neither an ellipse nor any other simple curve, but an immensely compli-
cated undulating line. It may fairly be doubted whether any generali-
zation, or hypothesis, based upon physical data is absolutely true, in
the sense that a mathematical proposition is so; but, if its errors can
become apparent only outside the limits of practicable observation, it
may be just as usefully adopted for one of the symbols of that algebra
by which we interpret nature, as 1f 1t were absolutely true.

The development of every branch of physical knowledge presents
63 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

three stages which, in their logical relation, are successive. The first is
the determination of the sensible character and order of the phenomena.
This is Natural History, in the original sense of the term, and here
nothing but observation and experiment avail us. The second is the
determination of the constant relations of the phenomena thus defined,
and their expression in rules or laws. The third is the explication of
these particular laws by deduction from the most general laws of matter
and motion. The last two stages constitute Natural Philosophy in its
original sense. In this region, the invention of verifiable hypotheses
is not only permissible, but is one of the conditions of progress.

Historically, no branch of science has followed this order of growth;
but, from the dawn of exact knowledge to the present day, observation,
experiment, and speculation have gone hand in hand; and, whenever
science has halted or strayed from the right path, it has been, either
because its votaries have been content with mere unverified or unveri-
fiable speculation (and this is the commonest case, because observation
and experiment are hard work, while speculation is amusing); or it has
been because the accumulation of details of observation has for a time
excluded speculation.

The progress of physical science, since the revival of learning, is.
largely due to the fact that men have gradually learned to lay aside
the consideration of unverifiable hypotheses; to guide observation and
experiment by verifiable hypotheses; and to consider the latter, not as
ideal truths, the real entities of an intelligible world behind phenomena,
but as a symbolical language, by the aid of which nature can be in-
terpreted in terms apprehensible by our intellects. And if physical
science, during the last fifty years, has attained dimensions beyond all
former precedent, and can exhibit achievements of greater importance
than any former such period can show, it is because able men, animated
by the true scientific spirit, carefully trained in the method of science,
and having at their disposal immensely improved appliances, have de-
voted themselves to the enlargement of the boundaries of natural knowl-
edge in greater number than during any previous half century of the
world’s history.

THREE GREAT RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS.

I have said that our epoch can produce achievements in physical
Science of greater moment than any other has to show, advisedly ; and.
I think that there are three great products of our time which justify the
assertion. One of these is that doctrine concerning the constitution of
matter, which, for want of a better name, I will call “molecular;” the
second is the doctrine of conservation of energy; the third is the doc-
trine of evolution. Each of these was foreshadowed, more or less dis-
tinctly, in former periods of the history of science; and, so far is either
from being the outcome of purely inductive reasoning, that it would be
hard to over-rate the influence of metaphysical, and even of theological,

’
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 69

considerations upon the development of all three. The peculiar merit
of onr epoch is that it has shown how these hypotheses connect a vast
number of seemingly independent partial generalizations; that it has
given them that precision of expression which is necessary for their
exact verification; and that it has practically proved their value as
guides to the discovery of new truth. All three doctrines are intimately
connected, and each is applicable to the whole physical cosmos. But,
as might have been expected from the nature of the case, the first two
grew, main ly, out of the consideration of physico-chemical phenomena
while the third, in great measure, owes its rehabilitation, if not its origin,
to the study of biological phenomena.

1. S'RUCTURE OF MATTER.

In the early decades of this century, a number of important truths
applicable, in part, to matter in general, and, in part, to particular
forms of matter, had been ascertained by the physicists and chemists.

The laws of motion of visible and tangible—or molar matter had been
worked out to agreat degree of refinement and embodied in the branches
of science known as Mechanics, Hydrostatics, and Pneumatics. These
laws had been shown to hold good, so far as they could be checked by
observation and experiment, throughout the universe, on the assump-
tion that all such masses of matter possessed inertia and were suscep-
tible of acquiring motion in two ways, firstly by impact, or impulse
from without; and secondly, by the operation of certain hypothetical
causes of motion termed ‘ forces,” which were usually supposed to be
resident in the particles of the masses themselves, and to operate at a
distance, in such a way as to tend to draw any two such masses to-
gether, or to separate them more widely.

With respect to the ultimate constitution of these masses, the same
two antagonistic opinions which had existed since the time of Democ-
ritus and of Aristotle were still face to face. According to the one,
matter was discontinuous and consisted of minute indivisible particles
or atoms, separated by a universal vacuum; according to the other, it
was continuous, and the finest distinguishable, or imaginable, particles
were scattered through the attenuated general substance of the plenum.
A rough analogy to the latter case would be afforded by granules of
ice diffused through water; to the former, such granules diffused through
absolutely empty space.

In the latter part of the eighteenth century the chemists had ar-
rived at several very important generalizations respecting those prop-
erties of matter with which they were especially concerned. However
plainly ponderable matter seemed to be originated and destroyed in
their operations, they proved that as mass or body, it remained inde-
Structible, and ingenerable; and that so far, it varied only in its per-
ceptibility by our senses. The course of investigation further proved
that a certain number of the chemically separable kinds of matter were

~

unalterable by any known means (except in so far as they might be
made to change their state from solid to fluid, or vice versa), unless
they were brought into contact with other kinds of matter, and that
the properties of these several kinds of matter were always the same,
whatever their origin. All other bodies were found to consist of two
or more of these, which thus took the place of the four ‘“ elements” of
the ancient philosophers. Further, it was proved that in forming
chemical compounds, bodies always unite in a definite proportion by
weight, or in simple multiples of that proportion, and that, if any one
body were taken as a standard, every other could have a number as-
signed to it as its proportional combining weight. It was on this foun-
dation of fact that Dalton based his re-establishment of the old atomic
hypothesis on a new empirical foundation. Itis obvious that if ele-
mentary matter consists of indestructible and indivisible particles,
each of which constantly preserves the same weight relatively to all
the others, compounds formed by the aggregation of two, three, four, or
more such particles must exemplify the rule of combination in definite
proportions deduced from observation.

In the meanwhile, the gradual reception of the undulatory theory of
light necessitated the assumption of the existence of an “ ether” filling
all space. But whether this ether was to be regarded as a strictly ma-
terial and continuous substance was an undecided point, and hence the
revived atomism escaped strangling in its birth. For it is clear that
if the ether is admitted to be a continuous material substance, Demo-
critic atomism is at an end, and Cartesian continuity takes its place.

The real value of the new atomic hypothesis, however, did not liein the
two points which Democritus and his followers would have considered
essential, namely, the indivisibility of the ‘“‘atoms” and the presence
of an inter-atomic vacuum; but in the assumption that, to the extent to
which our means of analysis take us, material bodies consist of definite
minute masses, each of which, so far as physical and chemical processes
of division go, may be regarded as a unit—having a practically perman-
ent individuality. Just as a man is the unit of sociology, without refer-
ence to the actual fact of his divisibility. so such a minute mass is the
unit of physico-chemical science—that smallest material particle which
under any given circumstances acts as a whole.*

The doctrine of specific heat originated in the eighteenth century.
It means that the same mass of a body, under the same circumstances,
always requires the same quantity of heat to raise it to a given temper-
ature, but that equal masses of different bodies require different quan-
tities. Ultimately, it was found that the quantities of heat required to
raise equal masses of the more perfect gases through equal ranges of
temperature were inversely proportional to their combining weights.

*“ Molecule” would be the more appropriate name for such a particle. Unfortu-
nately chemists employ this term in a special sense as a name for an aggregation of
their smallest particles, for which they retain the designation of ‘‘atoms.”
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. (Ay

and heat. The phenomena of electrolytic decomposition showed that
there was a like close relation between these units and electricity. The
quantity of electricity generated by the combination of any two units
is sufficient to separate any other two which are susceptible of such
decomposition. The phenomena of isomorphism showed a relation
between the units and crystalline forms; certain units are thus able to
replace others in acrystalline body without altering its form, and others
are not.

Again, the laws of the effect of pressure and heat on gaseous bodies, the
fact that they combine in definite proportions by volume, and that such
proportion bears a simple relation to their combining weights, all har-
monized with the Daltonian hypothesis, and led to the bold speculation
known as the law of Avogadro—that all gaseous bodies, under the same
physical conditions, contain the same number of units. In the form in
which it was first enunciated this hypothesis was incorrect-—perhaps it
is not exactly true in any form; but it is hardly too much to say that
chemistry and molecular physics would never have advanced to their
present condition unless it had been assumed to be true. Another
immense service rendered by Dalton, as a corrollary of the new atomic
doctrine, was the creation of a system of symbolic notation, which not
only made the nature of chemical compounds and processes easily in-
telligible and easy of recollection, but, by its very form, suggested new
lines of inquiry, The atomic notation was as serviceable to chemistry
as the binomial nomenclature and the classificatory schematism of
Linneus were to zoology and botany.

Side by side with these advances arose another, which also has a close
parallel in the history of biological science. If the unit of a compound
is made up by the aggregation of elementary units, the notion that
these must have some sort of definite arrangement inevitably suggests
itself; and such phenomena as double decomposition pointed, not only
to the existence of a molecular architecture, but to the possibility of
modifying a molecular fabric without destroying it, by taking out some
of the component units and replacing them by others. The class of
neutral salts, for example, includes a great number of bodies in many
ways similar, in which the basic molecules, or the acid molecules, may
be replaced by other basic and other acid molecules without altering
the neutrality of the salt; just as a cube of bricks remains a cube so
long as any brick that is taken out is replaced by another of the same
shape and dimensions, whatever its weight or other properties may be.
Facts of this kind gave rise to the conception of “types” of molecular
structure, just as the recognition of the unity in diversity of the struct-
ure of the species of plants and animals gave rise to the notion of bio-.
logical “types.” The notation of chemistry enabled these ideas to be
represented with precision; and they acquired an immense importance
when the improvement of methods of analysis, which took place about
T2 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

Thus a definite relation was established between the hypothetical units
the beginning of our period, enabled the composition of the so-called
“organic” bodies to be determined with rapidity and precision.* A
large proportion of these compounds contain not more than three or
four elements, of which carbon is the chief; but their number is very
great, and the diversity of their physical and chemical properties is as-
tonishing. The ascertainment of the proportion of each element in
these compounds affords little or no help towards accounting for their
diversities; widely different bodies being often very similar, or even
identical, in that respect. And, in the last case, that of isomeric com-
pounds, the appeal to diversity of arrangement of the identical compo-
nent units was the only obvious way out of the difficulty. Here again
hypothesis proved to be of great value; not only was the search for
evidence of diversity of molecular structure successfal, but the study
of the process of taking to pieces led to the discovery of the way to put
together, and vast numbers of compounds, some of them previously
known only as products of the living economy, have thus been artifi-
cially constructed. Chemical. work at the present day is, to a large
extent, synthetic or creative; that is to say, the chemist determines,
theoretically, that certain non-existent compounds ought to be pro-
ducible, and he proceeds to produce them.

It is largely because the chemical theory and practice of our epoch
have passed into this deductive amd synthetic stage, that they are en-
titled to the name of the ‘*‘ New Chemistry,” which they commonly re-
ceive. But this new chemistry has grown up by the help of hypotheses,
such as these of Dalton, and of Avogadro, and that singular conception
of “ bonds” invented to colligate the facts of ‘ valency ” or “ atomicity,”
the first of which took some time to make its way; while the second
fellinto oblivion for many years after if was propounded for lack of em-
pirical justification. As for the third, it may be doubted if any one
regards it as more than a temporary contrivance.

But some of these hypotheses have done yet further service. Com.
bining them with the mechanical theory of heat and the doctrine of the
conservation of energy, wbich are also products of our time, physicists
have arrived at an entirely new conception of the nature of gaseous
bodies and of the relation of the physico-chemical units of matter to
the different forms of energy. The conduct of gases under varying
pressure and temperature, their diffusibility, their relation to radiant
heat and to light, the evolution of heat when bodies combine, the ab-
sorption of heat when they are dissociated, and a host of other molecu-
lar phenomena, have been shown to be deducible from the dynamical
and statical principles which apply to molar motion and rest; and the
tendeney of the physico-chemical science is clearly towards the reduc-
tion of the problems of the world of the infinitely little, as it already

plished before Liebig’s time in a whole year.”—Hofmann, Faraday Lecture, p. 46.
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 73

has reduced those of the infinitely great world, to questions of me-
chanics.*

In the meanwhile, the primitive atomic theory, which has served as
the scaffolding for the edifice of modern physics and chemistry, has
been quietly dismissed. I can not discover that any contemporaryy,
physicist or chemist believes in the real indivisibility of atoms, or in ‘
an inter-atomic matterless vacuum. ‘ Atoms” appear to be used as
mere names for physico-chemical units which have not yet been sub-
divided, and “molecules” for physico-chemical units which are aggre-
gates of the former. And these individualized particles are supposed
to move in an endless ocean of a vastly more subtle matter—the ether.
If this ether is a continuous substance, therefore, we have got back
from the hypothesis of Dalton to that of Descartes. But there is much
reason to believe that science is going to make a still further journey,
and in form, if not altogether in substance, to return to the point of
view of Aristotle.

The greater number of the so-called “‘elementary” bodies, now known,
had been discovered before the commencement of our epoch; and it had
become apparent that they were by no means equally similar or dis-
similar, but that some of them, at any rate, constituted groups, the sev-
eral members of which were as much like one another as they were
unlike the rest. Chlorine, iodine, bromine, and fluorine thus formed a
very distinct group; sulphur and selenium another; boron and silicon
another; potassium, sodium, and lithium another, and so on. In some
cases the atomic weights of such allied bodies were nearly the same, or
could be arranged in series, with like differences between the several
terms. In fact, the elements afforded indications that they were sus-
ceptible of a classification in natural groups, such as those into which
animals and plants fall.

PERIODIC SERIES OF ELEMENTS.

Recently this subject has been taken up afresh, with a result which
may be stated roughly in the following terms: If the sixty-five or sixty-
eight recognized “elements” are arranged in the order of their atomic
weights—from hydrogen, the lightest, as unity, to uranium, the heavi-
est, as 240—the series does not exhibit one continuous progressive
modification in the physical and chemical characters of its several
terms, but breaks up into a number of sections, in each of which the
several terms present analogies with the corresponding terms of the
other series.

Thus the whole series does not run

So that it 1s said to express a periodic law of recurrent similarities. Or

the relation may be expressed in another way. In each section or the
series, the atomic weight is greater than in the preceding section, so
that if wis the atomic weight of any element in the first segment,
w+ «will represent the atomic weight of any element in the next,
and w+ 2+ y the atomic weight of any element in the next, and so on.
Therefore the sections may be represented as parallel series, the cor-
responding terms of which have analogous properties; each successive
series starting with a body the atomic weight of which is greater than
that of any in the preceding series, in the following fashion:

This is a conception with which biologists are very familiar, animal
and plant groups constantly appearing as series of parallel modifica-
tions of similar and yet different primary forms. In the living world,
facts of this kind are now understood to mean evolution from a com-
mon prototype. It is difficult to imagine that in the not-living world
they are devoid of significance. Is it not possible, nay probable, that
they may mean the evolution of our “elements” from a primary un-
differentiated form of matter? Fifty years ago such a suggestion
would have been scouted as a revival of the dreams of the alchemists.
At present it may be said to be the burning question of physico-chemi-
cal science.

In fact, the so-called “ vortex-ring ” hypothesis is a very serious and
remarkable attempt to deal with material units from a point of view
which is consistent with the doctrine of evolution. It supposes the
ether to be a uniform substance, and that the ‘elementary ” units are,
broadly speaking, permanent whirlpools, or vortices, of this ether, the
properties of which depend on their actual and potential modes of
motion. It is curious and highly interesting to remark that this hy-
pothesis reminds us not only of the speculations of Descartes, but of those
of Aristotle. The resemblance of the “vortex-rings” to the ‘tour.
billons” of Descartes is little more than nominal; but the correspond-
ence between the modern and the ancient notion of a distinction be-
tween primary and derivative matter is, to a certain extent, real. For
this ztherial ‘‘Urstoft” of the modern, corresponds very closely with
the zpwry bay of Aristotle, the materia prima of his medieval follow-
ers; while matter, differentiated into our elements, is the equivalent
of the first stage of progress towards the éoydéry &dy, or finished mat-
ter, of the ancient philosophy.

If the material units of the existing order of nature are specialized
portions of a relatively homogeneous materia prima—which were orig-
inated under conditions that have long ceased to exist and which remain
unchanged and unchangeable under all conditions, whether natural or
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. (5

artificial, hithertc known to us—it follows that the Speculation that
they may be indefinitely altered, or that new units may be generated
under conditions yet to be discovered, is perfect] y legitimate. Theoret-
ically, at any rate, the transmutability of the elements is a verifiable
scientific hypothesis; and such inquiries as those which have been set
afoot, into the possible dissociative action of the great heat of the
sun upon our elements, are not only legitimate, but are likely to yield
results which, whether affirmative or negative, will be of great impor-
tance. The idea that atoms are absolutely ingenerable and immutable
‘manufactured articles” stands on the same sort of foundation as the
idea that biological species are “manufactured articles” stood thirty
years ago; and the supposed constancy of the elementary atoms, dur-
ing the enormous lapse of time measured by the existence of our uni-
verse, is of no more weight against the possibility of change in them,
in the infinity of antecedent time, than the constancy of species in
Egypt, since the days of Rameses or Cheops, is evidence of their im-
mutability during all past epochs of the earth’s history. It seems safe
to prophesy that the hypothesis of the evolution of the elements from
a primitive matter will, in future, play no less a part in the history of
Science than the atomic hypothesis, which, to begin with, had no greater
if so great an empirical foundation.

It may perhaps occur to the reader that the boasted progress of phys-
ical science does not come to much, if our present conceptions of the
fundamental nature of matter are expressible in terms employed, more
than two thousand years ago, by the old “ master of those that know.”
Such a criticism, however, would involve forgetfulness of the fact that
the connotation of these terms, in the mind of the modern, is almost
infinitely different from that which they possessed in the mind of the
ancient philosopher. In antiquity, they meant little more than vague
Speculation; at the present day they indicate definite physical concep-
tions, susceptible of mathematical treatment, and giving rise to innu-
merable deductions, the value of which can be experimentally tested.
The old notions produced little more than floods of dialectics; the new
are powerful aids towards the increase of solid knowledge.

2. CONSERVATION OF ENERGY.

Every-day observation shows that of the bodies which compose the
material world, some are in motion and some are, or appear to be, at
rest. Of the bodies in motion, some, like the sun and stars, exhibit a
constant movement, regular in amount and direction, for which no ex-
ternal cause appears. Others, as stones and smoke, seem also to move
of themselves when external impediments are taken away; but these
appear to tend to move in opposite di rections, the bodies we call heavy,
such as stones, downwards, and the bodies we call light, at least such
as smoke and steam, upwards; and as we further notice that the earth
below our feet is made up of heavy matter, while the air above our
76 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

heads is extremely light matter, it is easy to regard this fact as evi-
dence that the lower region is the place to which heavy things tend—
their proper place, in short—while the upper region is the proper place
of light things; and to generalize the facts observed by saying that
bodies which are free to move tend towards their proper places. All
these seem to be natural motions, dependent on the inherent faculties
or tendencies of bodies themselves; but there are other motions which
are artificial or violent, as when a stone is thrown from the hand or is
knocked by another stone in motion. In such cases as these, for ex-
ample, when a stone is cast from the hand the distance travelled by the
stone appears to depend partly on its weight and partly upon the exer-
tion of the thrower. So that the weight of the stone remaining the
same, it looks as if the motive power communicated to it were measured
by the distance to which the stone travels;—as if (in other words) the
power needed to send it a hundred yards was twice as great as that
-needed to send it fifty yards. These, apparently obvious, conclusions
from the every-day appearances of rest and motion fairly represent the
state of opinion upon the subject which prevailed among the ancient
Greeks and remained dominant until the age of Galileo. The publica-
tion of the “ Principia” of Newton in 1686~87 marks the epoch at which
the progress of mechanical physics had effected a complete revolution
of thought on these subjects. By this time it had been made clear that
the old generalizations were either incomplete or totally erroneous; that
a body, once set in motion, will continue to move in a straight line for
any conceivable time or distance, unless it is interfered with; that any
change of motion is proportional to the ‘‘ force” which causes it and
takes place in the direction in which that ‘“‘ force” is exerted, and that
when a body in motion acts as a cause of motion on another the latter
gains aS much as the former loses, and vice versa. It is to be noted,
however, that while, in contradistinction to the ancient idea of the in-
herent tendency to motion of bodies, the absence of any such spon-
taneous power of motion was accepted as a physical axiom by the mod-
erns, the old conception virtually maintained itself in a new shape.
For, in spite of Newton’s well-known warning against the “ absurdity ”
of supposing that one body can act on another at a distance through a
vacuum, the ultimate particles of matter were generally assumed to be
the seats of perennial causes of motion termed “attractive and repulsive
forces,” in virtue of which any two such particles, without any external
impression of motion or intermediate material agent, were supposed to
tend to approach or remove from one another; and this view of the
duality of the causes of motion is very widely held at the present day.

Another important result of investigation, attained in the seventeenth
century, was the proof and quantitative estimation of physical inertia.
In the old philosophy, a curious conjunction of ethical and physical
prejudices had led to the notion that there was something ethically bad
and physically obstructive about matter. Aristotle attributes all irregu-
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. fir

larities and apparent dysteleologies in nature to the disobedience, or
sluggish yielding, of matter to the shaping and guiding influence of
those reasons and causes which were hypostatized in his ideal ‘‘ Forms.”
In modern science, the conception of the inertia, or resistance to change,
_of matter is complex. In part, it contains a corollary from the law of
causation: A body can not change its state in respect of rest or motion
without a sufficient cause. But, in part, it contains generalizations from
experience. One of these is that there is no such cause resident in any
body, and that therefore it will rest or continue in motion so long as no
external cause of change acts upon it. The other is that the effect which
the impact of a body in motion produces upon the body on which it im-
pinges depends, other things being alike, on the relation of a certain
quality of each which is called “mass.” Given a cause of motion of a
certain value, the amount of motion, measured by distance travelled in
a certain time, which it will produce in a given quantity of matter, say
a cubic inch, is not always the same, but depends on what that matter
is;—a cubic inch of iron will go faster than a cubicineh of gold. Hence,
it appears, that since equal amounts of motion have, ex hypothesi, been
produced, the amount of motion ina body does not depend on its speed
alone, but on some property of the body. To this the name of * mass”
has been given. And since it seems reasonable to suppose that a large
quantity of matter, moving slowly, possesses as much motion as a small
quantity moving faster, ‘‘ mass” has been held to express ‘*‘ quantity of
matter.” it is further demonstrable that, at any given time and place,
the relative mass of any two bodies is expressed by the ratio of their
weights. |
When all these great truths respecting molar motion, vr the move-
ments of visible and tangible masses, had been shown to hotd good not
ouly of terrestrial bodies, but of all those which coustitute the visible
universe, and the movements of the macrocosm had thus been expressed
by a general mechanical theory, there remained a vast number of phe-
nomena, such as those of light, heat, electricity, magnetism, and those
of the physical and chemical changes, which do not involve molar mo-
tion. Newton’s corpuscular theory of light was an attempt to deal with
one great series of these phenomena on mechanical principles, and it
maintained its ground until, at the beginning of the nineteenth century,
the undulatory theory proved itself to be a much better working hy-
pothesis. Heat, up to that time, and indeed much later, was regarded
as an imponderable substance, caloric; as a thing which was absorbed
by bodies when they were warmed, and was given out as they cooled;
and which, moreover, was capable of entering into a sort of chemical com-
bination with them, and so becoming latent. Rumford and Davy had
given a great blow to this view of heat by proving that the quantity of
heat which two portions of the same body could be made to give out, by
rubbing them together, was practically illimitable. This result brought
philosophers face to face with the contradiction of supposing that a
-

78 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

finite body could contain an infinite quantity of another body; but it
was not until 1843, that clear and unquestionable experimental proof was
given of the fact that there is a definite relation between mechanical
work and heat; that so much work always gives rise, under the same
conditions, to so much heat, and so much heat to so much mechanical
work. Thus originated the mechanical theory of heat, which became
the starting point of the modern doctrine of the conservation of energy.
Molar motion had appeared to be destroyed by friction. It was proved
that no destruction took place, but that an exact equivalent of the
energy of the lost molar motion appears as that of the molecular motion,
or motion of the smallest particles of a body, which constitutes heat.
The loss of the masses is the gain of their particles.

Before 1843, however, the doctrine of the conservation of energy had
been approached. Bacon’s chief contribution to positive science is the
happy guess (for the context shows that it was little more) that heat
may be a modeof motion; Descartes affirmed the quantity of motion in
the world to be constant; Newton nearly gave expression to the com-
plete theorem, while Rumford’s and Davy’s experiments suggested,
though they did not prove, the equivalency of mechapical and thermal
energy. Again, the discovery of voltaic electricity, and the marvellous
development of knowledge in that field, effected by such men as Davy,
Faraday, Oersted, Ampére, and Melloni, had brought to light a num-
ber of facts which tended to show that the so-called “ forces” at work
in light, heat, electricity, and magnetism, in chemical and in mechani-
cal operations, were intimately, and in various cases, quantitatively
related. It was demonstrated that any one could be obtained at the
expense of any other; and apparatus was devised which exhibited the
evolution of all these kinds of action from one source of energy. Hence
the idea of the “correlation of forces” which was the immediate fore-
runner of the doctrine of the conservation of energy.

It is a remarkable evidence of the greatness of the progress in this
direction which has been effected in our time, that even the second edi-
tion of the “ History of the Inductive Sciences,” which was published in
1846, contains no allusion either to the general view of the “ Correlation
of Forces” published in England in 1842, or to the publication in 1843
of the first of the series of experiments by which themechanical equiva-
lent of heat was correctly ascertained.* Such a failure on the part ofa

*This is the more curious, as Ampére’s hypothesis that vibrations of molecules,
causing and caused by vibrations of the zther constitute heat, is dis¢ussed. See vol.
li, p. 587, 2d ed. In the Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, 2d ed., 1847, p. 239,
Whewell remarks a propos of Bacon’s definition of heat, ‘‘that it is an expansive, re-
strained motion, modified in certain ways, and exerted in the smaller particles of
the body; ” that “ although the exact nature of heat is still an obscure and contro-
verted matter, the science of heat now consists of many important truths; and that
to none of these truths is there any approximation in Bacon’s essay.” In point of
fact, Bacon’s statement, however much open to criticism, does contain a distinct ap-
proximation to the most important of all the truths respecting heat which had been
discovered when Whewell wrote.

contemporary, of great acquirements and remarkable inteliectual pow-
ers, to read the signs of the times, is a lesson and a warning worthy of
being deeply pondered by any one who attempts to prognosticate the
course of scientific progress.

I have pointed out that the growth of clear and definite views re-
specting the constitution of matter has led to the conclusion that so far
as natural agencies are concerned, it is ingenerable and indestructible.
In so far as matter may be conceived to exist in a purely passive state,
it is, imaginably, older than motion. But as it must be assumed to be
susceptible of motion, a particle of bare matter at rest must be endowed
with the potentiality of motion. Such a particle however, by the sup-
position can have no energy, for there is no cause why it should move.
Suppose now that it receives an impulse, it will begin to move with a
velocity inversely proportional toits mass on the one hand, and directly
proportional to the strength of the impulse on the other, and will pos-
sess kinetic energy, in virtue of which it will not only continue to move
forever if unimpeded, but if it impinges on another such particle it will
impart more or less of its motion to the latter. Let it be conceived that
the particle acquires a tendency to move, and that nevertheless it does
not move. It is thenina condition totally different from that in which
it was at first. A cause competent to produce moticn is operating upon
it, but, for some reason or other, is unable to give rise to motion. If the
obstacle is removed, the energy which was there but could not manifest
itself, at once gives rise to motion. While the restraint lasts, the en-
ergy of the particle is merely potential; and the case supposed illus-
trates what is meant by potential energy. Inthis contrast of the po-
tential with the actual, modern physics is turning to account the most
familiar of Aristotelian distinctions—that between ddvaprs and évgpyera.

That kinetic energy appears to be imparted by impact is a fact ot
daily and hourly experience: we see bodies set in motion by bodies,
already in motion, which seem to come into contact with them. It is
a truth which could have been learned by nothing but experience, and
which can not be explained, but must be taken as an ultimate fact
about which, explicable or inexplicable, there can be no doubt. Strictly
speaking, we have no direct apprehension of any other cause of mo-
tion. But experience furnishes innumerable examples of the produc-
tion of kinetic energy in a body previously at rest, when no impact
is discernible as the cause of that energy. In all such cases, the
presence of a second body is a necessary condition ; and the amount of
kinetic energy, whichits presence enables the first to gain, is strictly de-
pendent on the relative positions of thetwo. Hence the phrase energy of
position, which is frequently used as equivalent to potential energy. Ifa
stone is picked up and held, say, 6 feet above the ground, it has potential
energy, because, if let go, it will immediately begin to move towards the
earth ; and this energy may be said to be energy of position, because it

stone is solicited to move, but can not so long as the muscular strength
of the holder prevents the solicitation from taking effect. The stone,
therefore, has potential energy, which becomes kinetic if it is let go,
and the amount of that kinetic energy which will be developed before
it strikes the earth depends upon its position,—on the fact that it is, say,
6 feet off the earth, neither more nor less. Moreover, it can be proved
that the faiser of the stone had to exert as much energy in order to
place it in its position as it will develop in falling. Hence the en-
ergy which was exerted, and apparently exhausted, in raising the stone
is potentially in the stone in its raised position, and will manifest it-
self when the stone is set free. Thus the energy, withdrawn from the
general stock to raise the stone, is returned when it falls, and there is
no change in the total amount. Energy, as a whole, is conserved.

Taking this as a very broad and general statement of the essential
facts of the case, the raisicg of the stone is intelligible enough, as a
ease of the communication of motion from one body to another. But
the potential energy of the raised stone is not so easily intelligible.
To all appearance, there is nothing either pushing or pulling it toward
the earth, or the earth toward it; and yet it is quite certain that the
stone tends to move toward the earth, and the earth toward the stone,
in the way defined by the law of gravitation.

In the currently accented language of science, the cause of motion,
in ail such cases as this, when bodies tend to move toward or away from
one or another, without any discernible impact of other bodies, is termed
a ‘“¢ force,” which is called “ attractive” in the one case, and “ repul-
sive” in the other. And such attractive or repulsive forces are often
spoken of as if they were real things, capable of exerting a pull, ora
push, upon the particles of matter concerned. Thus the potential
energy of the stone is commonly said to be due to the force” of gravity
which is continually operating upon it.

Another illustration may make the case plainer. The bob of a pend-
ulum swings first to one side and then to the other of the center of the
are which it describes. Suppose it to have just reached the summit of
its right-hand half-swing. It is said that the “attractive forces” of the
bob for the earth, and of the earth for the bob, set the former in motion ;
and as these ‘“ forces” are continually in operation, they confer an ac-
celerated velocity on the bob; until, when it reaches the center of its
Swing, it is, so to speak, fully charged with kinetic energy. If, at this
moment, the whole material universe, except the bob, were abolished,
it would move forever in the direction of a tangent to the middle of the
are described. Asa matter of fact, it is compelled te travel through
its left-hand half-swing, and thus virtually to go up hill. Consequently
the “ attractive forces” of the bob and the earth are now acting against
it, and constitute a resistance which the charge of kinetic energy has to
overcome. But as this charge represents the operation of the attractive
torces, during the passage of the bob through the right-hand half-swing
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 81

down to the center of the are, so it must needs be used up by the pas-
sage of the bob upward from the center of the are to the summit of the
left-hand half-swing. Hence, at this point, the bob comes to a momen-
tary rest. The last fraction of kinetic energy is just neutralized by the
action of the attractive forces, and the bob has only potential energy
equal to that with which it started. So that the sum of the phenomena
may be stated thus: At the summit of either half-are of its swing, the
bob bas a certain amount of potential energy; and as it descends it
gradually exchanges this for kinetic energy, until at the center it pos-
sesses an equivalent amount of kinetic energy; from this point on-
wards, it gradually loses kinetic energy as it ascends, until, at the
summit of the other half-are, it has required an exactly similar amount
of potential energy. Thus, on the whole transaction, nothing is either
lost or gained; the quantity of energy is always the same, but it passes
from one form into the other.

To all appearance, the phenomena exhibited by the pendulum are
not to be accounted for by impact; in fact, it is usually assumed that cor-
responding phenomena would take place if the earth and the pendulum
were situated in an absolute vacuum, and at any conceivable distance
from one another. If this be so, it follows that there must be two
totally different kinds of causes of motion; the one impact—a vera causa,
of which, to all appearance, we have constant experience; the other,
attractive or repulsive ‘‘foree”—a metaphysical entity which is phys-
ically inconceivable. Newton expressly repudiated the notion of the
existence of attractive forces, in the sense in which that term is ordi-
narily understood ; and he refused to put forward any hypothesis as to
the physical cause of the so-called “attraction of gravitation.” As a
general rule, his successors have been content to accept the doctrine of
attractive and repulsive forces, without troubling themselves about the
philosophical difficulties which it involves. But this has not always
been the case; and the attempt of Le Sage, in the last century, to show
that the phenomena of attraction and repulsion are susceptible of ex-
planation by his hypothesis of bombardment by ultra-mundane par-
ticles, whether tenable or not, has the great merit of being an attempt
to get rid of the dual conception of the causes of motion which has
hitherto prevailed. On this hypothesis, the hammering of the ultra-
mundane corpuscles on the bob coufers its kinetic energy on the one
hand, and takes it away onthe other; and the state of potential energ)
means the condition of the bob during the instant at which the energy
conferred by the hammering during the one half-are has just been ex-
hausted by the hammering during the other half-arc. It seems safe
to look forward to the time when the conception of attractive and re-
pulsive forces, having served its purpose as a useful piece of scientific
scaffolding, will be replaced by the deduction of the phenomena known
as attraction and repulsion, from the general laws of motion, .

82 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

The doctrine of the conservation of energy, which I have endeavored
to illustrate, is thus defined by the late Clerk Maxwell:

“The total energy of any body or system of bodies is a quantity
which can neither be increased nor diminished by any mutual action of,
such bodies, though it may be transformed into any one of the forms of
which energy is susceptible.” It follows that energy, like matter, is in-
destructible and ingenerable in nature. The phenomenal world, so far
as it is material, expresses the evolution and involution of energy, its
passage from the kinetic to the potential condition and back again.
Wherever motion of matter takes place, that motion is effected at the
expense of part of the total store of energy.

Hence, asthe phenomena exhibited by living beings, in so far as they
are material, are all molar or molecular motions, these are included un-
der the general law. A living body is a machine by which energy is
transformed in the same sense as a Steam-engine is So, and all its move-
ments, molar and molecular, are to be accounted for by the energy which
is supplied to it. The phenomena of consciousness which arise, along
with certain transformations of energy, can not be interpolated in the
series of these transformations, inasmuch as they are not motions to
which the doctrine of the conservation of energy applies. And for the
same reason, they do not necessitate the using up of energy; a sensa-
tion has no mass and can not be conceived to be susceptible of move-
ment. That a particular molecular motion does give rise to a state of
consciousness is experimentally certain; but the how and why of the
process are just as inexplicable as in the case of the communication of
kinetic energy by impact.

When dealing with the doctrine of the ultimate constitution of mat-
ter, we found a certain resemblance between the oldest speculations and
the newest doctrines of physical philosophers. But there is no such
resemblance between the ancient and modern views of motion and its
causes, except in so far as the conception of attractive and repulsive
forces may be regarded as the modified descendant of the Aristotelian
conception of forms. In fact, it is hardly too much to say that the es-
sential and fundamental difference between ancient and modern phys-
ical science lies in the ascertainment of the true laws of statics and
dynamics in the course of the last three centuries; and in the invention
of mathematical methods of dealing with all the consequences of these
laws. The ultimate aim of modern physical science is the deduction of
the phenomena exhibited by material bodies from physico-mathematical
first principles. Whether the human intellect is strong enough to at-
tain the goal set before it may be a question, but thither will it surely
strive.

3. EVOLUTION.

The third great scientific event of our time, the rehabilitation of the
doctrine of evolution, is part of the same teudency of increasing kuowl-
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. $3

edge to unify itself, which has led to the doctrine of the conservation of
energy. And this tendency, again, is mainly a product of the increas-
ing strength conferred by physical investigation on the belief in the
universal validity of that orderly relation of facts, which we express by
the so-called ‘‘ Laws of Nature.”

The growth of a plant from its seed, of an animal from its egg, the
apparent origin of innumerable living things from mud, or from the
putrefying remains of former organisms, had furnished the earlier sci-
entific thinkers with abundant analogies suggestive of the conception of
a corresponding method of cosmic evolution from a formless “chaos”
to an ordered world which might either continue forever or undergo
dissolution into its elements before starting on a new course of evolu-
tion. Itis therefore no wonder that, from the days of the Ionian school
onwards, the view that the universe was the result of such a process
should have maintained itself as a leading dogma of philosophy. The
emanistic theories which played so great a part in Neoplatonic philos-
ophy and Gnostic theology are forms of evolution. In the seventeenth
century, Descartes propounded a scheme of evolution, as an hypothesis
of what might have been the mode of origin of the world, while pro-
fessing to accept the ecclesiastical scheme of creation, as an account of
that which actually was its manner of coming into existence. In the
eighteenth century Kant put forth a remarkable speculation as to the
origin of the solar system, closely similar to that subsequently adopted
by Laplace and destined to become famous under the title of the “neb-
ular hypothesis.”

The careful observations and the acute reasonings of the Italian
geologists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the specula-
tions of Leibnitz in the *“* Protogeea” and of Buffon in his *‘ Théorie de
la Terre,” the sober and profound reasonings of Hutton, in the latter
part of the eighteenth century,—all these tended to show that the
fabric of the earth itself implied the continuance of processes of natural
causation for a period of time as great, in relation to human history, as
the distances of the heavenly bodies from us are, in relation to terres-
trial standards of measurement. The abyss of time began to loom as
large as the abyss of space. And this revelation to sight and touch,
of a link here and a link there of a practically infinite chain of natural
causes and effects, prepared the way, as perhaps nothing else has done,
for the modern form of the ancient theory of evolution.

In the beginning of the eighteenth ceutury, De Maillet made the first
serious attempt to apply the doctrine to the living world. In the latter
part of it, Erasmus Darwin, Goethe, Treviranus, and Lamarck, took up
the work more vigorously and with better qualifications. The question
of special creation, or evolution, lay at the bottom of the fierce dis-

- putes which broke out in the French Academy between Cuvier and St.-
Hilaire; and, for a time, the supporters of biological evolution were

84 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

the age with their ecclesiastical opponents. Catastrophism, a short-
sighted teleology, and a still more short-sighted orthodoxy, joimed
forces to crush evolution.

Lyell and Poulett Scrope, in this country, resumed the work of the
Italians aod of Hutton; and the former, aided by a marvellous power
of clear exposition, placed upon an irrefragable basis the truth that
natural causes are competent to account for all events, which can be
proved to have occurred, in the course of the secular changes which
have taken place during the deposition of the stratified rocks. The
publication of “The Principles of Geology,” in 1830, constituted an
epoch in geological science. But it also constituted an epoch in the
modern history of the doctrines of evolution, by raisingin the mind of
every intelligent reader this question: If natural causation is compe-
tent to account for the not-living part of our globe, why should it not
account for the living part?

By keeping this question before- the public for some thirty years,
Lyell, though the keenest and most formidable of the opponents of the
transmutation theory, as it was formulated by Lamarck, was of the
greatest possible service in facilitating the reception of the sounder
doctrines of a later day. And in like fashion, another vehement op-
ponent of the transmutation of species, the elder Agassiz, was doomed
to help the cause he hated. Agassiz not only maintained the fact of
the progressive advance in organization of the inhabitants of the earth
at each successive geological epoch, but he insisted upon the analogy
of the steps of this progression with those by which the embryo ad-
vances to the adult condition, among the highest forms of each group.
In fact, in endeavoring to support these views he went a good way be-
yond the limits of any cautious interpretation of the facts then known.

Although little acquainted with biological science, Whewell seems
to have taken particular pains with that part of his work which deals
with the history of geological and biological speculation ; and several
chapters of his seventeenth and eighteenth books, which comprise the
history of physiology, of comparative anatomy and of the paletiological
sciences, vividly reproduce the controversies of the early days of the
Victorian epoch. But here, as in the case of the doctrine of the con-
servation of energy, the historian of the inductive sciences bas no pro-
phetic insight; not even a suspicion of that which the near future was
to bring forth. And those who still repeat the once favorite objection
that Darwin’s “ Origin of Species” is nothing but a new version of the
** Philosophie zoologique” will find that, so late as 1844, Whewell had
not the slightest suspicion of Darwin’s main theorem, even as a logical
possibility. In faet, the publication of that theorem by Darwin and
Wallace, in 1859, took all the biological world by surprise. Neither
those who were inclined towards the “ progressive transmutation” or
“development” doctrine, as it was then called, nor those who were
opposed to it, had the slightest suspicion that the tendency to variation

in living beings, which all admitted as a matter of fact, the selective
influence of conditions, which no one could deny to be a matter of fact
when his attention was drawn to the evidence, and the occurrence
of great geological changes which also was matter of fact, could be
used as the only necessary postulates of a theory of the evolution of
plants and animals which, even if not, at once, competent to explain all
the known facts of biological science, could not be shown to be incon-
sistent with any. So far as biology is concerned, the publication of the
‘Origin of Species,” for the first time, put the doctrine of evolution, in
its application to living things, upon a sound scientific foundation. It
became an instrument of investigation, and in no hands did it prove
more brilliantly profitable than in those of Darwin himself. His pub-
lications on the effects of domestication in plants and animals,.on the
influence of cross-fertilization, on flowers as organs for effecting such
fertilization, on insectivorous plants, on the motions of plants, pointed
out the routes of exploration which have since been followed by hosts
of inquirers, to the great profit of science.

Darwin found the biological world a more than sufficient field for
even his great powers, and left the cosmical part of the doctrine to
others. Not much has been added to the nebular hypothesis since the
time of Laplace, except that the attempt to show (against that hypoth-
esis) that all nebule are star clusters, has been met by the spectro-
scopic proof of the gaseous condition of some of them. Moreover, phy-
sicists of the present generation appear now to accept the secular cool-
ing of the earth, which is one of the corollaries of that hypothesis. * In
fact, attempts have been made, by the help of deductions from the data
of physics, to lay down an approximate limit to the number of millions
of years which have elapsed since the earth was habitable by living
beings. If the conclusions thus reached should stand the test of further
investigation, they will undoubtedly be very valuable. But, whether
true or false, they can have no influence upon the doctrine of evolu-
tion in its application to living organisms. The occurrence of succes-
sive furms of life upon our globe is an historical fact which can not be
disputed, and the relation of these successive forms, as stages of evoln-
tion of the same type, is established in various cases. The biologist
has no means of determining the time over which the process of evolu-
tion has extended, but accepts the computation of the physical geologist
and the physicist, whatever that may be.

Evolution as a philosophical doctrine applicable to all phenomena,
whether physical or mental, whether manifested by material atoms or
by men in society, has been dealt with systematically in the ‘‘Synthetic .
Philosophy” of Mr. Herbert Spencer. Comment on that great under-
taking would not be in place here. I mention it because, -so far as I
know, it is the first attempt to deal on scientifie principles with modern
Scientific facts and speculations. For the ‘ Philosophie positive” of M.
Comte, with which Mr. Spencer’s system of philosophy is sometimes
86 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

compared, though it professes a similar object, is unfortunately per-
meated by a thoroughly unscientific spirit, and its author had no ade-
quate acquaintance with the physical sciences even of his own time.

The doctrine of evolution, so far as the present physical cosmos is
concerned, postulates the fixity of the rules of operation of the causes
of motion in the material universe. If all kinds of matter are modifica-
tions of one kind, and if all modes of motion are derived from the same
energy, the orderly evolution of physical nature out of one substratum
and one energy implies that the rules of action of that energy should
be fixed and definite. In the past history of the universe back to that
point, there can be no room for chance or disorder. But it is possible
to raise the question whether this universe of simplest matter and defi-
nitely operating energy, which forms our hypothetical starting point,
may not itself be a product of evolution from a universe of such matter,
in which the manifestations of energy were not definite,—in which, for
example, our laws of motion held good for’some units and not for
others, or for the same units at one time and not at another,—and which
would therefore be a real epicurean chance-world ?

For myself, J must confess that I find the air of this region of speeu-
lation too rarefied for my constitution, and I am disposed to take refuge
in ‘“‘ignoramus et ignorabimus.”

OTHER SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS.

The execution of my further task, the indication of the most im-
portant achievements in the several branches of physical science during
the last fifty years, is embarrassed by the abundance of the objects of
choice; and by the difficulty which every one, but a specialist in each
department, must find in drawing a due distinction between the dis-
coveries which strike the imagination by their novelty, or by their
practical influence, and those unobtrusive but pregnant observations
and experiments in which the germs of the great things of the future
really lie. Moreover, my limits restrict me to little more than a bare
chronicle of the events which I have to notice.

In physies and chemistry, the old boundaries of which sciences are
rapidly becoming effaced, one can hardly go wrong in ascribing a pri-
mary value to the investigations into the relation between the solid,
liquid, and gaseous states of matter on the one hand, and degrees of
pressure and of heat on the other. Almost all, even the most refrac-
tory, solids have been vaporized by the intense heat of the electric arc ;
and the most refractory gases have been forced to assume the liquid,
and even the solid, forms by the combination of high pressure with
intense cold. It has further been shown that there is no discontinuity
between these states—that a gas passes into the liquid state through a
condition which is neither one nor the other, and that a liquid body
becomes solid, or a solid liquid, by the intermediation of a condition in
which it is neither truly solid nor truly liquid.
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 87
KINETIC THEORY OF GASES.

Theoretical and experimental investigations have concurred in the
establishment of the view that a gas is a body, the particles of which
are in incessant rectilinear motion at high velocities, colliding with one
another and bounding back when they strike the walls of the containing
vessel; and, on this theory, the already ascertained relations of gaseous
bodies to heat and pressure have been shown to be deducible from
mechanical principles. Immense improvements have been effected in
the means of exhausting a given space of its gaseous contents; and
experimentation on the phenomena which attend the electric discharge
and the action of radiant heat, within the extremely rarefied media
thus produced, has yielded a great number of remarkable results, some

‘of which have been made familiar to the public by the Gieseler tubes

and the radiometer. Already these investigations have afforded an —
unexpected insight into the constitution of matter and its relations
with thermal and electri¢ energy, and they open up a vast. field for
future inquiry into some of the deepest problems of physics. Other
important steps, in the same direction, have been effected by investiga-
tions into the absorption of radiant heat proceeding from different
sources by solid, fluid, and gaseous bodies. And it is a curious ex-
ample of the inter-connection of the various branches of physical
science, that some of the results thus obtained have proved of great
importance in meteorology.

SPECTROSCOPY.

The existence of numerous dark lines, constant in their number and
position in the various regions of the solar spectrum, was made out by
Frauvhofer in the early part of the present century, but more than
forty years elapsed before their causes were ascertained and theif im-
portance recognized. Spectroscopy, which then took its rise, is proba-
bly that employment of physical knowledge, already won, as a means
of further acquisition, which most impresses the imagination. For it
has suddenly and immensely enlarged our power of overcoming the
obstacles which almost infinite minnteness on the one hand, and almost
infinite distance on the other, have hitherto opposed to the recognition
of the presence and the condition of matter. One eighteen-millionth
of a grain of sodium in the flame of a spirit-lamp may be detected by
this instrument; and, at the same time, it gives trustworthy indica-
tions of the material constitution not only of the sun, but of the far-
thest of those fixed stars and nebule which afford sufficient light to
affect the eye, or the photographic plate, of the inquirer?

ELECTRICAL ADVANCES.

The mathematical and experimental elucidation of the phenomena of
electricity, and the study of the relations of this form of energy with

chemical and thermal action, had made extensive progress before 1837.
But the determination of the influence of magnetism on light, the dis-
covery of diamagnetism, of the influence of crystalline structure on

city, all belong tothe present epoch. To it also appertain the practical
execution and the working out of the results of the great international
system of observations on terrestrial magnetism, suggested by Hum-
boldt in 1836; and the invention of instruments of infinite delicacy and
precision for the quantitative determination of electrical phenomena.
The voltaic battery has received vast improvements; while the inven-
tion of magneto-electric engines and of improved means of prodacing
ordinary electricity has provided sources of electrical energy vastly
superior to any before extant in power, and far more convenient for.
use.

It is perhaps this branch of physical science which may claim the
palm for its practical fruits, no less than for the aid which it has fur-
nished to the investigation of other parts of the field of physical sci-
ence. The idea of the practicability of establishing a communication
between distant points, by means of electricity, could hardly fail to
have simmered in the minds of ingenious men, since well-nigh a cen-
tury ago, experimental proof was given that electric disturbances could
be propagated through a wire 12,000 feet long. Various methods of
carrying the suggestion into practice had been effected with some de-
gree of success; but the system of electric telegraphy, which, at the
present time, brings all parts of the civilized world within a few min-
utes of one another, originated only about the commencement of the
epoch under consideration. In its influence on the course of human
affairs, this invention takes its place beside that of gunpowder, which
tended to abolish the physical inequalities of fighting men,—of print-
ing, which tended to destroy the effect of inequalities in wealth among
learning men,—of steam transport, which has done the like for travel-
ling men. All these gifts of science are aids in the process of levelling
up; of removing the ignorant and baneful prejudices of nation against
nation, province against province, and class against class; of assuring
that social order which is the foundation of progress, which has re-
deemed Europe from barbarism, and against which one is glad to think
that those who, in our time, are employing themselves in fanning the
embers of ancient wrong, in setting class against class, and in trying
to tear asunder the existing bonds of unity, are undertaking a futile
Struggle. The telephone is only second in practical importance to the
electric telegraph. Invented, as it were, only the other day, it has
already taken its place as an appliance of daily life. Sixty years ago
the extraction of metals from their solutions, by the electric current,
was simply a highly interesting scientific fact. At the present day
the galvano-plastic art is a great industry; and, in combination with
photography, promises to be of endless service in the arts. Electric

lighting is another great gift of science to civilization, the practical
effects of which have not yet been fully developed, largely on account
of its cost. But those whose memories go back to the tinder-box pe-
riod, and recollect the cost of the first lucifer matches, will not despair
of the results of the application of science and ingenuity to the cheap
production of anything for which there is a large demand.

The influence of the progress of electrical knowledge and invention
upon that of investigation in other fields of science is highly remark-
able. The combination of electrical with mechanical contrivances has
produced instruments by which not only may extremely small intervals
of time be exactly measured, but the varying rapidity of movements,
which take place in such intervals and appear to the ordinary sense in-
stantaneous, is recorded. The duration of the winking of an eye is a
proverbial expression for an instantaneous action; but, by the help of
the revolving cylinder and the electrical-marking apparatus, it is possi-
ble to obtain a graphic record of such an action, in which, if it endures
a fraction of a second, that fraction shall be subdivided into a hundred
or a thousand equal parts, and the state of the action at each hundredth
or thousandth of a second exhibited. In fact, these instruments may be
said to be time-microscopes. Such appliances have not only effected a
revolution in physiology by the power of analyzing the phenomena of
muscular and nervous activity which they have conferred, but they have
furnished new methods of measuring the rate of movement of projectiles
to the artillerist. Again, the microphone, which renders the minutest
movements audible, and which enables a listener to hear the footfall of
a fly, has equipped the sense of hearing with the means of entering
almost as deeply into the penetralia of nature as does the sense of sight.

PHOTOGRAPHY.

That light exerts a remarkable influence in bringing about certain
chemical combinations and decompositions was well known fifty years
ago, and various more or less successful attempts to produce permanent
pictures by the help of that knowledge had already been made. It was
not till 1839, however, that practical success was obtained; but the
“‘daguerreotypes ” were both cumbrous and costly, and photography
would never have attained its present important development had not
the progress of invention substituted paper and glass for the silvered
plates then in use. It is not my affair to dwell upon the practical appli-
cation of the photography of the present day, but it is germane to my
purpose to remark that it has furnished a most valuable accessory to
the methods of recording motions and lapse of time already in exist-
ence. In the hands of the astronomer and the meteorologist it has
yielded means of registering terrestrial, solar, planetary, and stellar
phenomena, independent of the sources of error attendant on ordinary
observation; in the hands of the physicist not only does it record spec-
troscopic phenomena with unsurpassable ease and precision, but it has

revealed the existence of rays having powerful chemical energy, or be-
yond the visible limits of either end of the spectrum; while, to the
naturalist, it furnishes the means by which the forms of many highly
complicated objects may be represented, without that possibility of error
which is inherent in the work of the draughtsman. In fact, in many
cases, the stern impartiality of photography is an objection to its em.
ployment,—it makes no distinction between the important and the un-
important; and hence photographs of dissections, forexample, are rarely
so useful as the work of a draughtsman who is at once accurate and in-
telligent.
ASTRONOMY.

The determination of the existence of a new planet, Neptune, far be-
yond the previously known bounds of the solar system, by mathematical
deduction from the facts of perturbation ; and the immediate confirma-
tion of that determination, in the year 1846, by observers who turned
their telescopes into the part of the heavens indicated as its place, con-
stitute a remarkable testimony of nature to the validity of the principles
of the astronomy of our time. In addition, so many new asteroids have
been added to those which were already known to circulate in the place
which theoretically should be occupied by a planet, between Mars and
Jupiter, that their number now amounts to between two and three hun-
dred. I have already alluded to the extension of our knowledge of the
nature of the heavenly bodies by the employment of spectroscopy. It
has not only thrown wonderful light upon the physical and chemical
constitution of the sun, fixed stars, and nebule and comets, but it holds
out a prospect of obtaining definite evidence as to the nature of our
so-called elementary bodies.

ASTRONOMIC GEOLOGY.

The application of the generalizations of thermoties to the problem of
the duration of the earth, and of deductions from tidal phenomena to
the determination of the length of the day and of the time of revolution
of the moon, in past epochs of the history of the universe; and the
demonstration of the competency of the great secular changes, known
under the general name of the precession of the equinoxes, to cause
corresponding modifications in the climate of the two hemispheres of
our globe, have brought astronomy into intimate relation with geol-
ogy. Geology, in fact, proves that in the course of the past history
of the earth, the climatic conditions of the same regions have been
widely different, and seeks the explanation of this important truth from
the sister sciences. The facts that, in the middle of the Tertiary epoch,
evergreen trees abounded within the arctic circle; and that, in the long
subsequent Quaternary epoch, an arctic climate, with its accompaniment
of gigantic glaciers, obtained in the northern hemisphere, as far south
as Switzerland and central France, are as well established as any truths
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 91

of science. But, whether the explanation of these extreme variations
in the mean temperature of a great part of the northern hemisphere is
to be sought in the concomitant changes in the distribution of land and
water surfaces of which geology affords evidence, or in astronomical
conditions, such as those to which I have referred, 1s a question which
must await its answer from the science of the future.

BIOLOGY.

Turning now to the great steps in that vast progress which the bio-
logical sciences have made since 1537, we are met, on the threshold of
our epoch, with perhaps the greatest of all,—namely, the promulgation
by Schwann, in 1839, of the generalization known as the “ cell theory,”
the application and extension of which by a host of subsequent investi-
gators has revolutionized morphology, development, and physiology.
Thanks to the immense series of labors thus inaugurated, the following
fundamental truths have been established:

All living bodies contain substances of closely similar physical and
chemical composition, which constitute the physical basis of life, known
as protoplasm. So far as our present knowledge goes, this takes its
origin only from pre-existing protoplasm.

All complex living bodies consist, at one period of their existence, of
an aggregate of minute portions of such substance, of similar structure,
called cells, each cell having its own life independent of the others,
though influenced by them.

All the morphological characters of animals and plants are the results
of the mode of multiplication, growth, and structural metamorphosis of
these cells, considered as morphological units.

All the physiological activities of animals and plants—assimilation,
secretion, excretion, motion, generation—are the expression of the ac-
tivities of the cells considered as physiological units. Each individual,
among the higher animals and plants, is a synthesis of millions of sub-
ordinate individualities. Its individuality, therefore, is that of a “ civ-
itas” in the ancient sense, or that of the Leviathan of Hobbes.

There is no absolute line of demarkation between animals and plants.
The intimate structure, and the modes of change, in the cells of the two
are fundamentally the same. Moreover, the higher forms are evolved
from lower, in the course of their development, by analogous processes
of differentiation, coalescence, and reduction in both the vegetable and
the animal worlds.

At the present time the cell theory, in consequence of recent inves.
tigations into the structure and metamorphosis of the ‘ nucleus,” is
undergoing a new development of great significance, which, among
other things, foreshadows the possibility of the establishment of a phy-
sical theory of heredity, on a safer foundation than those which Buffon
and Darwin have devised.
92 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

The popular belief in abiogenesis, or the so-called “ spontaneous”
generation of the lower forms of life, which was accepted by all the
philosophers of antiquity, held its ground down to the middle of the
seventeenth century. Notwithstanding the frequent citation of the
phrase, wrongfully attributed to Harvey, ‘‘ Omne vivum ex ovo,” that
great physiologist believed in spontaneous generation as firmly as Aris-
totle did. And it was only in the latter part of the seventeenth century
that Redi, by simple and well-devised experiments, demonstrated that
in a great number of cases of supposed spontaneous generation, the
animals which made their appearance owed their origin to the ordinary
process of reproduction, and thus shook the ancient doctrine to its foun-
dations. In the middle of the eighteenth century it was revived in a
new form, by Needham and Buffon; but the expeyiments of Spalianzani
enrorced the conclusions of Redi, and compelled the advocates of the
occurrence of spontaneous generation to seek evidence for their hypoth-
esis only among the parasites and the lowest and minutest organisms.
It is just fifty years since Schwann and others proved that even with
respect to them, the supposed evidence of abiogenesis was untrust-
worthy.

During the present epoch the question whether living matter can be
produced in any other way than by the physiological activity of other liv-
ing matter has been discussed afresh with great vigor; and the problem has
been investigated by experimental methods of a precision and refinement
unknown to previous investigators. The result is that the evidence in
favor of abiogenesis has utterly broken down in every case which has
been properly tested. So far as the lowest and minutest organisms are
concerned, it has been proved that they never make their appearance
if those precautions by which their germs are certainly excluded are
taken. And, in regard to parasites, every case which seemed to. make
for their generation from the substance of the animal or plant which
they infest has been proved to have a totally different significance.
Whether not-living matter may pass, or ever has under any conditions
passed into living matter, without the agency of pre-existing living
matter, necessarily remains an open question; all that can be said is
that it does not undergo this metamorphosis under any known condi-
tions. Those who take a monistic view of the physical world may fairly
hold abiogenesis as a pious opinion, supported by analogy and defended
by our ignorance. But, as matters stand, it is equally justifiable to re-
gard the physical world as a sort of dual monarchy. The kingdoms of
living matter and of not-living matter are under one system of laws,
and there is a perfect freedom of exchange and transit from one to the
other. But no claim to biological nationality is valid except birth.

In the department of anatomy and development a host of accurate
and patient inquirers, aided by novel methods of preparation, which
enable the anatomist to exhaust the details of visible structure and to
reproduce them with geometrical precision, have investigated every

important group of living animals and plants, no less than the fossil
relics of former faune and flor. An enormous addition has thus been
made to our knowledge, especially of the lower forms of life, and it may
be said that morphology, however inexhaustible in detail, is complete in
its broad features. Classification, which is merely a convenient sum-
mary expression of morphological facts, has undergone a corresponding
improvement. The breaks which formerly separated our groups from
one another, as animals from plants, vertebrates from invertebrates,
cryptogams from phanerogams, have either been filled up or shown
to have no theoretical significance. The question of the position of
man, aS an animal, has given rise to much disputation, with the result
of proving that there is no anatomical or developmental character by
which he is more widely distinguished from the group of animals most
nearly allied to him, than they are from one another. In fact, in this
particular, the classification of Linnzeus has been proved to be more in
accordance with the facts than those of most of his successors.

ANTHROPOLOGY.

The study of man, as a genus and species of the animal world, con-
ducted with reference to no other considerations than those which
would be admitted by the investigator of any other form of animal
life, has given rise to a special branch of biology known as Anthropol-
ogy, which has grown with great rapidity. Numerous societies devoted
to this portion of science have sprung up, and the energy of its devo-
tees has produced a copious literature. The physical characters of the
various races of men have been studied with a minuteness and accu-
racy heretofore unknown; and demonstrative evidence of the existence
of human contemporaries of the extinct animals of the latest geological
epoch has been obtained; physical science has thus been brought into
the closest relation with history and with archeology ; and the striking
investigations which, during our time, have put beyond doubt the vast
antiquity of Babylonian and Egyptian civilization, are in perfect har-
mony with the conclusions of anthropology as to the antiquity of the
human species.

Classification is a logical process which consists in putting together
those things which are like and keeping asunder those which are un-
like; and a morphological classification, of course, takes notes only of
morphological likeness and unlikeness. So long, therefore, as our mor-
phological knowledge was almost wholly confined to anatumy, the
characters of groups were solely anatomical; but as the phenomena of
embryology were explored, the likeness and unlikeness of individual
development had to be taken into account; and at present, the study of
ancestral evolution introduces a new element of likeness and unlike-
hess which is not only eminently deserving of recognition, but must
ultimately predominate over all others. A classification which shall
represent the process of ancestral evolution is, in tact, the end which
é

the labors of the philosophical taxonomist must keep in view. But it
is an end which can not be attained until the progress of paleontology
has given us far more insight than we yet possess into the historical
facts of the case. Much ofthe speculative “ phylogeny,” which abounds
among my present contemporaries, reminds me very forcibly of the
speculative morphology, unchecked by a knowledge of development,
which was rife in my youth. As hypothesis, suggesting inquiry in this
or that direction, it is often extremely useful; but when the product
of such speculation is placed on a level with those generalizations of
morphological truths which are represented by the definitions of natural
groups, it tends to confuse faney with fact and to create mere disorder.
We are in danger of drifting into a new “ Natur-Philosophie” worse
than the old, because there is less excuse for it. Boyle did great serv-
ice to science by his ‘‘Sceptical Chemist,” and I am inclined to think
that at the present day a *‘ Sceptical Biologist” might exert an equally
beneficent influence.

PHYSIOLOGY.

Whoso wishes to gain a clear conception of the progress of physiology
since 1837, will do well to compare Miiller’s ‘“ Physiolog;,” which ap-
peared in 1835, and Drapiez’s edition of Kichard’s “ Nouveaux Hléments
de Botanique,” published in 1837, with any of the present hand-books
of animal and vegetable physiology. Miiller’s work was a masterpiece,
unsurpassed since the time of Haller, and Richard’s book enjoyed a
great reputation at the time; but their successors transport one into a
new world. That which characterizes the new physiology, is that it is
permeated by, and indeed based upon conceptions which, though not
wholly absent, are but dawning on the minds of the older writers.

Modern physiology sets forth as its chief ends: TVirstly, the ascertain-
ment of the facts and conditions of cell-life in general. Secondty, in
composite organisms, the analysis of the functions of organs into those
of the cells of which they are composed. Thirdly, the explication of
the processes by which this local cell-life is directly or indirectly con-

trolled and brought into relation with the life of the rest of the cells

which compose the organism. Fourthly, the investigation of the phe-
nomena of lifein general, on the assumption that the physical and chem-
ical processes which take place in the living body are of the same order
as those which take place out of it; and that whatever energy is exerted
in producing such phenomena is derived from the common stock of en-
ergy in the universe. In the fifth place modern physiology investigates
the relation between physical and psychical phenomena, on the assump-
tion that molecular changes in definite portions of nervous matter stand
in the relation of necessary antecedents to definite mental states and
operations. The work which has been done in each of the directions
here indicated is vast, and the accumulation of solid knowledge, which
has been effected, is correspondingly great, For the first time in the
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 95

history of science, physiologists are now in the position to say that they
have arrived at clear and distinct, though by no means complete, con-
ceptions of the manner in which the great functions of assimilation,
respiration, secretion, distribution of nutriment, removal of waste prod-
ucts, motion, sensation, and reproduction are performed; while the op-
ération of the nervous system, as a regulative apparatus, which in-
fluences the origination and the transmission of manifestations of. ac-
tivity, either within itself or in other organs, has been largely elucidated.

] have pointed out, in an earlier part of this chapter, that the history
of all branches of science proves that they must attain a considerable
stage of development before they yield practical “fruits;” and this is
eminently true of physiology. It is only within the present epoch that
physiology and chemistry have reached the point at which they could
offer a scientific foundation to agriculture, and it is only within the
present epoch that zoology and physiology have yielded any very great
aid to pathology and hygiene. But within that time they have already
rendered highly important services by the exploration of the phe-
nomena of parasitism. Not only have the history of the animal para:
sites, such as the tapeworms and the trichina, which infest men and
animals, with deadly results, been cleared up by means of experimental
investigations, and efficient modes of prevention deduced from the data
so obtained, but the terrible agency of the parasitic fungi and of the
infinitesimally minute microbes, which work far greater havoc among
plants and animals, has been brought to light. The “particulate” or
‘‘verm” theory of disease, as it is called, long since suggested, has ob-
tained a firm foundation, in so far as it has been proved to be true in
respect of sundry epidemic disorders. Moreover, it has theoretically
justified prophylactic measures, such as vaccination, which formerly
rested on a merely empirical basis; and it has been extended to other
diseases with excellent results. Further, just as the discovery of the
cause of scabies proved the absurdity of many of the old prescriptions
for the prevention and treatment of that disease, so the discovery of
the cause of splenic fever, and other such maladies, has given a new
direction to prophylactic and curative measures against the worst
scourges of humanity. Unless the fanaticism of philozoic sentiment
overpowers the voice of philanthropy, and the love of dogs and cats
supersedes that of one’s neighbor, the progress of experimental physi-
ology and pathology will indubitably, in course of time, place medi-
cine and hygiene upon a rational basis. Two centuries ago England
was devastated by the plague; cleanliness and common sense were
enough to free us from its ravages. One century since small-pox was
almost as great a scourge; science, though working empirically, and
almost in the dark, has reduced that evil to relative insignificance. At
the present time, science working in the light of clear knowledge, has
attacked splenic fever and has beaten it. It is attacking hydrophobia
with no mean premise of success; sooner or later it will deal in the
96 SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

same way with diphtheria, typhoid and scarlet fever. To one who has
seen half a street swept clear of its children, or has lost his own by
these horrible pestilences, passing one’s offspring through the fire to
Moloch seems humanity compared with the proposal to deprive them of
half their chances of health and life because of the discomfort to dogs
and cats, rabbits and frogs, which may be involved in the search for
means of guarding them.

EXPLORATION.

An immense extension has been effected in our knowledge of the dis-
tribution of plants and animals; and the elucidation of the causes which
have brought about that distribution has been greatly advanced. The
establishment of meteorological observations by all civilized nations,
has furnished a solid foundation to climatology ; while a growing sense
of the importance of the influence of the “ struggle for existence” affords
a wholesome check to the tendency to overrate the influence of climate
on distribution. Expeditions, such as that of the Challenger, equipped,
not for geographical exploration and discovery, but for the purpose of
throwing light on problems of physical and biological science, have
been sent out by our own and other Governments, and have obtained
stores of information of the greatest value. For the first time, we are
in possession of something like precise knowledge of the physical feat-
ures of the deep seas, and of the living pepulation of the floor of the
ocean. ‘The careful and exhaustive study of the phenomena presented
by the accumulations of snow and ice, in polar and mountainous regions,
which has taken place in our time, has not only revealed to the geologist
an agent of denudation and transport, which has slowly and quietly
produced effects, formerly confidently referred to diluvial catastrophes,
but it has suggested new methods of accounting for various puzzling
facts of distribution,

PAL AONTOLOGY.

Paleontology, which treats of the extinct forms of life and their suc-
cession and distribution upon our globe, a branch of science which
could hardly be said to exist a century ago, has undergone a wonderful
development in our epoch. In some groups of animals and plants the
extinct representatives, already known, are more numerous and impor-
tant than the living. There can be no doubt thaf the existing Fauna
and Flora is but the last term of a long series of equally numerous con-
temporary species, which have succeeded one another, by theslow and
gradual substitution of species for species, in the vast interval of time
which has elapsed between the deposition of the earliest fossiliferous
strata and the present day. There is no reasonable ground for believ-
jng that the oldest remains yet obtained carry us even near the begin-
nings of life. The impressive warnings of Lyell against hasty specula-
tions, based upon negative evidence, have been fully justified; time
SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. 97

after time, highly organized types have been discovered in formations
of an age in which the existence of such forms of life had been confi-
dently declared to be impossible. The western territories of the United
States alone have yielded a world of extinct animal forms, undreamed
of fifty years ago. And wherever sufficiently numerous series of the re-
mains of any given group, which has endured for a long space of time,
are carefully examined, their morphological relations are never in dis-
cordance with the requirements of the doctrine of evolution. and often
afford convincing evidence of it. At the same time, it has been shown
that certain forms persist with very little change, from the oldest to the
newest fossiliferous formations; and thus show that progressive devel-
opment is a contingent, and not a necessary result, of the nature of liv-
ing matter.

GEOLOGY.

Geology is, as it were, the biology of our planet as a whole. In so
far as it comprises the surface configuration and the inner structure of
the earth, it answers to morphology; in so far as it studies changes of
condition and their causes, it corresponds with physiology; in so far as
it deals with the causes which have effected the progress of the earth
from its earliest to its present state, it forms part of the general doc-
trine of evolution. An interesting contrast between the geology of the
present day and that of halfa century ago is presented by the complete
emancipation of the modern geologist from the controlling and pervert-
ing influence of theology, all-powerful at the earlier date. As the geol-
ogist of my young days wrote, he had one eye upon fact and the other
on Genesis; at present he wisely keeps’ both eyes on fact and ig-
nores the pentateuchal mythology altogether. The publication of the
“Principles of Geology” brought upon its illustrious author a period
of social ostracism ; the instruction given to our children is based upon
those principles. Whewell had the courage to attack Lyell’s funda-
mental assumption (which surely is a dictate of common sense) that we
ought to exhaust known causes, before seeking for the explanation of
geological phenomena in causes of which we have no experience. But
geology has advanced to its present state by working from Lyell’s *
axiom; and to this day the record of the stratified rocks affords no proof
that the intensity or the rapidity of the causes of change has ever varied
between wider limits than those between which the operations of nature
have taken place in the youngest geological epochs.

An incalculable benefit has accrued to geological science from the
accurate and detailed surveys which have now been executed by skilled
geologists employed by the Governments of all parts of the civilized

*Perhaps I ought rather to say Buffon’s axiom. For that great naturalist and
writer embodied the principles of sound geology in a pithy phrase of the Théorie de
la Terre: “ Pour juger de ce qui est arrivé, et méme de ce qui arrivera, nous n’avons
qua examiner ce qui arrive.”

world. In geology the study of large maps is as important as it is said
to bein politics; and sections, on a true scale, are even more important,
in so far as they are essential to the apprehension of the extraordinary
insignificance of geological perturbations in relation to the whole mass
of our planet. It should never be forgotten that what we call “catas-
trophes” are, in relation to the earth, changes, the equivalents of which
would be well represented by the development of a few pimples, or the
scratch of a pin, on a man’s head. Vast regions of the earth’s surface
remain geologically unknown; but the area already fairly explored is
many times greater than it was in 1837, and in many parts of Europe
and the United States the structure of the superficial crust of the earth
has been investigated with great minuteness.

The parallel between Biology and Geology which I have drawn is
further illustrated by the modern growth of that branch of the science
known as Petrology, which answers to Histology, and has made the
microscope as essential an instrument to the geological as to the bio-
logical investigator.

The evidence of the importance of causes now in operation has been
wonderfully enlarged by the study of glacial phenomena, by that of
earthquakes and voleanoes, and by that of the efficacy of heat and cold,
wind, rain, and rivers as agents of denudation and transport. On the
other hand, the exploration of coral reefs and of the deposits now tak-
ing place at the-bottom of the great oceans has proved that in animal
and plant life, we have agents of reconstruction of a potency hitherto
unsuspected.

There is no study better fitted than that of geology to impress upon
men of general culture that.conviction of the unbroken sequence of the
order of natural phenomena throughout the duration of the universe,
which is the great, and perhaps the most important, effect of the in-
crease of natural knowledge.
RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR. 1886.

ASTRONOMY, FOR 1886.

By WILLIAM C. WINLOCK,
Assistant Astronomer, United States Naval Observatory,

In preparing the review of Astronomy for 1886, the method and ar-

* rangement adopted by Professor Holden from i879 to 1884 have been

adhered to without essential modification. The record is intended pri-

marily to serve as a series of notes for those who have not access to a

large astronomical library, but it is hoped that the bibliography will be

found useful to the professional astronomer as a reference list of tech-
nical papers.

Much assistance has been derived from the reviews and abstracts in
the Bulletin Astronomique, the Observatory, Nature, the Atheneum,
and other periodicals, and the writer is indebted to the directors of
many observatories for the communication of information not otherwise
available.

A subject-index to the review has been effected by inserting the nec-
essary page-references in the bibliography.

DISTRIBUTION OF STARS.

Distribution of the stars in Schinfeld’s Durchmusterung.—The comple-
tion of the Durchmusterung to — 23° of declination by Argelander’s
successor, Dr. Schonfeld, has given Professor Seeliger the opportunity
of extending his counts of stars to a considerable portion of the south-
ern hemisphere. Professor Seeliger’s paper “ Uber die Vertheilung
der Sterne.auf der siidlichen Halbkugel nach Schinfeld’s ‘ Durehmus-
terung,’” has been published in the Proceedings of the Bavarian Acad-
emy of Sciences, and résumés may be found in the Bulletin astrono-
mique (3: 593-6), the Observatory (9: 399), and Nature (34: 627). An
abstract of Professor Seeliger’s previous work was given in the “Ac-
count of the Progress in Astronomy” for 1884, and his present discus-
sion has been carried out on a plan similar to that there described.

99
100 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

The stars are divided into eight classes, one more than previously
used, as Schénfeld has included stars of the tenth magnitude, whereas
Argelander stopped at 9.5.

Schénfeld’s zones begin at — 2°, but the ‘ counts” may be carried up
to the equator by utilizing Argelander’s work ; the slight difference in
limiting magnitude will not affect materially the result. The stars
embraced in each degree of declination have been divided into groups
of twenty minutes in right ascension, though only the sums for each
forty minutes have been published.

The number of stars in each of the eight classes is as follows:

The numbers in column A comprise Schoénfeld’s stars only ; column
B includes Argelander’s stars, from 0° to —2°, for the first seven
classes: to complete Class VIII about 3,600 should be added. The
number of stars thus counted in the “Southern Durchmusterung” proper
is, therefore, 133,580, and adding to this 79 objects which are classed as
nebule or variables, there results the grand total, 133,659.

In order to investigate the influence of the Milky Way on the distri-
bution of these stars, Professor Seeliger proceeds, as in his, former
paper, to form the “ gradient,” which expresses for each class the
rapidity of increase in the number of stars as we approach the Milky
Way. Comparing the values of the gradient with these found for
Argelander’s Durchmusterung, it is seen that, as far as Schénfeld’s
work can be considered typical of the southern hemisphere as a whole
(it must be remembered, however, that it only embraces one-third
thereof) the influence of the Milky Way on stellar distribution, at least
for stars down to the eighth magnitude, appears to be less marked for
the southern than for the northern bemisphere. But it may well be
that, especially in the higher classes of stars, local and accidental irreg-
ularities are the cause of this apparent difference. With regard to the
question as to which hemisphere is the richer in stars, it appears that
there is no decided difference shown by the two surveys under consider-
ation. When Argelander’s numbers are corrected so as to be compara-
ble with Shéufeld’s, taking stars down to the ninth magnitude, inclu-
ASTRONOMY. 101

sive, the totals are, for the former, 34,324, and for the latter, 34,119,
a difference which may reasonably be attributed to accidental cireum-
stances.

The whole discussion of the distribution of the stars will no doubt
be mach facilitated by the application of photography.

A writer in L’Astronomie has concluded that the total number of
stars in ‘our nebula”—on the assumption that the combined light of
the stars is equal to one-tenth that of the full moon—must be sixty-six
thousand million.

NEBULAi AND STAR CLUSTERS.

New nebule.—Two lists, embracing 476 new nebule discovered with
the 26-inch equatorial of the Leander McCormick Observatory, have
been published in the Astronomical Journal (7: 9, 57) by Professor
Stone. The observers were Professor Stone himself, Mr. Leavenworth,
and Mr. Muller. In the earlier observations Herschel’s abbreviations
were used to designate brightness and size. Afterwards numerical
magnitudes were employed to indicate brightness, assuming that the
faintest nebula visible in the 26-inch refractor with power 167, is 16.3,
that being the theoretical limit for stars. The magnitudes given refer
to the nucleus, or, in case there is no nucleus, to the brightest part.
Still later the custom was instituted of estimating the diameters of the
nebul in fractions of the diameter of the field, and from these deducing
their dimensions in minutes of are.

Dr. Swift has published (Astron. Nachr., 115: 153, 257; 116: 33) eata-
logues 3, 4, and 5 of nebule discovered at the Warner Observatory. He
States in the report of the observatory that 540 nebule have been dis-
covered up to January 1, 1887. Mr. Muller has found that fifteen of
“Catalogue No.5” have already been announced by other observers.
(Sid. Mess., 6: 83.)

The Pleiades.—M. Kayet, in order to test the penetrating power of
the 14-inch Bordeaux equatorial, has made a revision of Wolf’s chart
of the Pleiades, and has determined accurately the positions of 143
Stars, most of them of the fourteenth or fifteenth magnitude, not given
by Wolf.

The Henry brothers have also compared their photographs of the
Pleiades with Wolf’s chart, and have been able to detect 1,421 stars
where Wolf shows but 625, the telescopes used being of nearly the same
aperture. In order to avoid errors which might arise from impurities
in the photographic plate, three exposures, of an hour each, were made,
and the plate was shifted between exposures, so that three images of
each star are obtained, forming an equilateral triangle. Stars as faint

“as the sixteenth maguitude are depicted. All the stars of Wolf’s chart
are found upon the photograph except ten, and these the Messrs. Henry
have been unable to find in the sky. A number of faint companions
haye been detected close to several of the brightest stars of the group,
102 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

and in several cases where M. Wolf has observed a faint companion to
a bright star, the photograph has shown that the magnitude of the
former was underestimated. One of the advantages of photography
seems to be that it brings out faint objects which are lost to the eye, on
account of their proximity to bright stars. Besides the nebula discov-
ered about Maia, a nebulous streak has been seen near Electra, and
details of the Merope nebula have been made out, which had not been
recognized before, except by Common.

Dr. Weiss has expressed a strong suspicion that all of the region to the
north and west of Aleyone is a vast nebula, only the brightest portions
of which are shown by our best telescopes. He recalls a statement by
Schmidt in 1863, that a small planet seemed to lose a part of its light
in traversing the region between Alcyone and Electra.

Dr. Kammermann has been able to see the new Maia nebula with
the 10-inch refractor of the Geneva Observatory by masking the bright
star, and by using a special eye-piece provided with diaphragms, and
a plate of uranium glass, to increase the intensity of the chemical rays.

A paper by Dr. Elkin upon **A comparison of the places of the Pleiades
as determined by the Kénigsberg and Yale College heliometers” was read
at the Buffalo meeting of the American Association. Provisional results
show unguestioned change of position with reference to 77 Taurisince 1840.
Most of the brighter stars of the group, as shown by Neweomb in his
‘‘ Standard Stars,” go with 7 Tauri, but among the smaller stars there
are departures from this community of proper motion. Professor Pick-
ering has pointed out that the agreement of the spectra of certain of
these stars strongiy confirms the probability of their physical connec
tion.

ASTRONOMICAL CONSTANTS.

Lewy’s method of determining the elements of refraction—M. Lowy
has elaborated his method of determining the elements of refraction by
means of a reflecting prism placed in front of the object-glass of an
equatorial, and has submitted the problem to a careful mathematical
analysis in several papers communicated to the French Academy. The
full titles of these important papers are given in our “biobligraphy.” Dr.
till speaks very highly of the plan, and has suggested some modifica-
tions of the details which he thinks would increase the ease and accu-
racy of observations.

Onpolzer’s astronomical refraction—The late Dr. von Oppolzer pub-
lished in the Transactions of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, of
Vienna, a paper containing a theoretical discussion of the problem of
astronomical refraction followed by numerical tables intended to facil-
itate the practical application of the results at which he arrived. When
the approximations are carried far enough, the method seems capable ~
of giving results of great accuracy, even for large zenith distances.

A correction for gravity in the use of refraction tables.—Proft, Cleve-
ASTRONOMY. 103

land Abbe has directed attention to a neglected correction in the use
of refraction tables, which appears as a function of the latitude.
Thirty inches of mercury in the barometer at the equator indicate a
less density of the atmosphere than 30 inches at the poles, consequently
the barometer readings should be corrected for differences of lati-
tude. This is accomplished by simply adding to the formula one more
factor for gravity. Professor Abbe shows that the difference of latitude
between Pulkowa and Washington makes a difference of 0’. 1 in the
refraction at 45° zenith distance, and increases with the zenith distance.
We have here a partial explanation, at least, of systematic differences
in declination shown by different catalogues.

Correction for differential refraction in declination.—Professor MeNeill,
of Princeton, has devised (Astron. Nachr., 114:385) a method of correct-
ing micrometer observations for refraction, applicable to the diagonal-
square micrometer, the ring micrometer, and others of the same class.
The correction to the observed difference of declination is not deter-
mined by a special separate computation, but the true difference -is
directly determined, the corrections being applied to the logarithms in
the course of the computation. Tables are given which will be found
very useful to observers.

In a “Zusatz” to this communication, Dr. Krueger gives a résumé of
differential refraction formule for ring and filar micrometers.

M. Radanu suggests (Bull. astron., 3:373) that Professor MeNeill’s prin-
cipal table may be replaced by a simple graphical table which will give
at a glance the correction sought.

The diurnal nutation of the earth’s axis.—M. Folie, about three years
ago, submitted to the Paris Academy a theory of the diurnal nutation
of the earth’s axis, based upon the assumption that the earth has a
fluid nucleus; and he has recently given (Compt. Rend., Dec. 13, 1886)
some practical illustrations of his formule. These formule contain
two constants to be determined by observation: the constant of diurnal
nutation itself, and the longitude, referred to an initial meridian. Very
accordant results are obtained from the rather meager observational
material available, the value of the diurnal constant being about 0.2.
The new correction applied to a series of observations of Polaris made
at Pulkowa, smooths out the discordant observations in a most surpris-
ing manner. Further investigation of this subject seems highly desir-
able.

An abstract of the paper read by Prof. J. C. Adams at the Phila-
delphia meeting of the American Association, September 11, 1884, “On
the general values of the obliquity of the ecliptic, and of the precession
and inclination of the equator to the invariable plane, taking into ac-
count terms of the second order,” has appeared in the Observatory for
April, 1886, vol. 9, p. 150-154,

STAR CATALOGUES, ETC.

Schinfeld’s Southern Durchmusterung (1855.0).—This catalogue con-
talus the approximate positions of 153,659 stars between 2° and 23° of
south declination—that is, all stars between those limits down to the
tenth magnitude. It carries Argelander’s ‘ sweeps” as far south as the
latitude of Bonn will permit, and is on essentially the same plan as the
Northern Durchmusterung, Inthe details of the work, however, several
improvements have been made: Instead of Argelander’s little 3-inch
glass, magnifying nine times, Dr. Schénfeld used a telescope by Schroder
of 64 inches aperture with a magnifying power of twenty-six, and with
the field slightly i]luminated. The width of the zones was 14°, instead
of 2°, the width of the older zones. This invoived more hours of obser-
vation, but the accuracy of the work and the certainty of catching faint
stars were increased, since the observer was not obliged to take in every-
thing up to the limit of visibility. A further advantage which the
Southern Durchmusterung possesses 1s that Dr. Schénfeld Las himself
made all of the observations and revisions, so that the work is more
homogeneous than the Northern Durchmusterung. The observations
were begun, after some preliminary experiments, on the 6th of June,
1876; by the 28th of March, 1881, the zones had all been observed for
the second time. There are, including sixteen zones subsequently re-
observed, 363,922 observations, all reduced to 1855.0. The revision,
also by Dr. Schénfeld and with the same instrument, embraced 5,700
positions, and was finished between April, 1881, and March, 1884.

From the summary of the stars in each square degree it appears that
the Southern Durchmusterung is richer in stars than the Northern, in
the ratio of 1.21to1. The fainter stars (under the ninth magnitude)
are much more thoroughly observed than before, the limit being the
tenth magnitude instead of 9.5, that adopted by Argelander. The prob-
able error of a single estimation of magnitude for stars of the 9.5 mag-
nitude is only 0.11 magnitude, and for the seventh magnitude, 0.26
magnitude. The charts accompanying the catalogue contain an hour
each in right ascension. .

The Argentine General Catalogue.—The observations from which this
catalogue was formed were made with the meridian circle of the Cor-
doba Observatory during the years 1872~80. During these years the
zone observations were the chief object of attention, and the catalogue
contains the places of 32,448 stars whose positions were more elabo-
rately determined during the progress of that great work, and consti-
tutes an addition to our knowledge of southern stellar positions of per-
haps not less importance than the Cordoba Zone Catalogue. The Gen-
eral Catalogue gives the positions for the epoch 1875.0 of most of the
southern stars brighter than magnitude 84, the deficiencies in this re-
spect being chiefly found north of the parallel of 23°, at which the zone
begins. These omissions will be of comparatively small importance,
ASTRONOMY. 105

inasmuch as the Durchmusterung of Professor Schéutfield comprises all

the southern stars within this region, while accurate determinations of
the brighter ones will have been made in the re-observation of Lalande’s
stars now nearly completed at the Paris Observatory.

Pulkowa catalogue of 3,542 stars for 1855.0.—Volume vu of the Pul-
kowa Observations is to contain two catalogues of stars deduced from
observations made with the meridian circle from 1840 to 1869. The first
of these—the one that has just been published—contains, with the ex-
ception of the Pulkowa fundamental stars (observed with the transit
instrument and vertical circal), all Bradley’s stars between the north
pole and 15° south declination, and also a comparatively small number
of other stars down to the sixth magnitude, inclusive, given in the
Uranometria Nova of Argelander, in the same part of the sky. A few
fainter stars have also been taken into the catalogue. The whole work
has been in the hands of Dr. Backlund. (Bull. astron., November, 1886.)

Kam’s catalogue of ** Nachrichten” stars for 1855.0.—* Dr. N. M. Kam
of Schiedam has published in Verhandelingen der Koninklijke Akademie
van Wetenschappen, Deel. 24(Amsterdam), a star catalogue compiled
from the places of stars determined by meridian observations, which
have been extracted from volumes 1 to 66 of the Astronomische Nach-
richten, and reduced to the epoch 1855.0. The positions of the stars
contained in this catalogue were determined in connection with obser-
vations of planets and comets, and it was in compliance with Arge-
lander’s express desire that the work of collecting them and reducing
the positions to a common epoch was commenced by Hoek, then di-
rector of the Utrecht Observatory. Dr. Kam, who was Hoek’s assist-
ant, continued the work after the death of the latter, and has at length
been able to publish his results. The principal catalogue contains the
completely determined places of 4,350 stars, and is followed by two
subsidiary catalogues, the first giving the places of 236 stars, and the
second those of 335 stars; all of the latter, however, are incomplete,
i. é., the place is given in one element only. The catalogues are followed
by a comparison of the places, of the stars contained in them with
their places as given in the Bonn Durchmusterung, or, for stars south
of — 2° declination, with other authorities. Notes on proper motions,
corrigenda, etc., are appended, which are of considerable interest and
value.” (Nature, June 3, 1886.)

Romberg’s catalogue of * Nachrichten” stars (1855.0)—Herr Romberg,
of the Pulkowa Observatory, has compiled a catalogue of about 8,000
stars extracted from the Astronomische Nachrichten, volumes 67 to 112,
and his work now appears as Publication xvii of the Astronomische
Gesellschaft. This is a continuation of a similar compilation (Pub. VIII,
Astron. Gesellsch.), by Schjellerup, from the first sixty-six volumes of
the Nachrichten, and is prepared on much the same plan. The stars
have appeared in the Nachrichten as comparison stars for planets, com-
ets, etc., and have been collected by Romberg and reduced to 1855.0.
106 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 18386.

Right ascensions are given to seconds of time, declinations to the nearest
tenth of a minute of are. The catalogue proper is followed by several
useful pages of notes.

Jdinburgh catalogue.—Prof. Piazzi Smyth has given in volume xv of
the Edinburgh Astronomical Observations the results of observations
made from 1833 to 1872 upon some 3,890 B. A. C. stars, reduced to the
epochs 1830, 1870, 1880, and 1890. The catalogue begins with 4" 0 of
right ascension, the first four hours having appeared nine years ago as
volume xIv. The notes contain information in regard to the proper
motion, color, or duplicity of the stars.

Second Armagh catalogue of 3,300 stars for 1875.0.—After the comple-
tion of the observations of Bradley’s stars, the results of which were em-
bodied in the catalogue commonly known as the “ Armagh Catalogue,”
Dr. Robinson formed the plan of re-observing a number of stars from
Lalande’s “‘ Histoire céleste,” occurring in Baily’s catalogue. Observa-
tions were commenced in 1859 with the 33-inch mural circle and transit,
but were stopped after 1860 in order to change the mural into a 7-inch
transit circle. Work was resumed in 1863, and continued with more or
less regularity till 1883. The right ascensions of this catalogue depend
on the standard stars of the ** Nautical Almanae;” the north polar dis-
tances upon observations of the nadir. Dr. Dreyer, who succeeded Dr.
Robinson in 1882, found from 400 observations of 80 stars between 30°
and 100° N. P. D., that the probable error of a single observation in
right ascension was + 08.081, (the single errors having been multiplied
by cos 6); and in north polar distance -+-0’.85. For systematic errors
Armagh has been compared with Glasgow, and, indirectly through the
latter, a comparison is obtained with Auwers’ fundamental system.
From this comparison it appears that the north polar distances are in
fair agreement with Auwers’ catalogue, while the right ascensions
show considerable discordances.

Reliability of the star-places of Auwers’ Fundamental Catalogue.—Mr.
Chandler, having pointed out the possibility of error in the places of
certain stars (Observatory 8: 387), as given in the Berlin “ Jahrbuch,”
Herr Auwers has been induced to publish (Astron. Nachr., 114: 1-20)
some valuable and interesting remarks on the reliability of the places
of his Fundamental Catalogue (Pub. d. astron. Gesellsch., 14), from which
those given in the Berlin “ Jahrbuch” are derived. Herr Auwers ex-
plains the provisional character of the data on which some of his star-
places depend, and repeats in a more definite manner what he has already
said on the subject in Publication xtvy. In facet the proper motions
adopted for some of the stars are merely provisional, as has been pointed
out in the introduction to the catalogue. The proper motions employed
have been, as a rule, obtained from a comparison of Bradley’s places
with those of Greenwich, 1561, and in those cases in which Bradley has
only one observation, or observed the star in one element only, the
proper motion is given to one decimal place less than usual. The reader
ASTRONOMY. 107

is thus put on his guard, and knows that he should use the places of
certain stars with circumspection. Herr Auwers thinks that it would
be premature to attempt any correction of the catalogue-places before
the completion of the general revision, which has been undertaken by
the observers of the zones and by the Pulkowa astronomers. He, how-
ever, takes this opportunity of publishing the results of investigations
he has made as to the mean errors of the different catalogues employed
in the formation of the Fundamental Catalogue, viz, Pulkowa, 1845 and
1865; Greenwich, 1861 and 1872; Cambridge (U.S8.), 1872; Leipzig,
1868; and Leiden, 1868, for the principal'stars ; and in addition to these,
Pulkowa, 1871, for the supplementary stars.

The following are, in the mean (for declination — 10° to + 90°), the
mean errors, referred to the unit of weight, for the principal stars :

| P. 1845. | P. 1865. | G. 1861. me G. 1872. | C. 1872. | Lp. 1868. | L. 1868.

We have then, finally, for mean error of the right ascensions 0°.033
(for supplementary stars 0°.042), and for the declinations 0.59 (for sup-
plementary stars 0.67). The somewhat considerable difference in the
results for principal and for supplementary stars arises from the cir-
cumstance that Herr Auwers gave relatively too much weight to Pul-
kowa 1871, at least for the right ascensions. For the catalogue-places,
the mean errors are 0°.009 and 0.14 in R. A. and Decl., respectively, for
the principal stars, and 0°.026 and 0/.19 for the supplementary stars ;
where the mean error in R. A. refers to the total number of stars be-
tween — 10° and + 50°. Atthe present time, in Herr Auwers’ opinion,
the probable error of the star-places is not greater than 05.02 in R. A.
(for moderate declinations), and 0.15 in Decl. (Observatory, 9: 202,
May, 1886.)

In response to a suggestion by Dr. Gill, a number of astronomers
have expressed their willingness to co-operate in the systematic observa-
tion of stars which have been used in comet comparisons, faint stars
whose occultations have been observed, zones of stars used for scale or
screw values, orstars that have been used for geodetic purposes. Among
the observatories ready for this work are, the Cape of Good Hope,
Neuchatel, Bruxelles, Cointe, Taschkent, and Cordoba,
108 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Professor Holden, while at the Washburn Observatory, compiled a
list of all published corrections to his star catalogues, inserting the
errata in the bodies of the books themselves. The original sources from
which the errata were copied are given in the fourth volume of the
Publications of the observatory. The value of this list will be appre-
ciated by all astronomers who have occasion to make use of star cata-
logues.

The catalogue of stars of the British Association has been advertised
recently at 170 mark, or about $43. °

STELLAR PARALLAX.

Prof. A. Hall has given in Appendix 11 to the Washington Observa-
tions for 1883 the results of recent observations made with the 26-inch
equatorial to determine the parallaxes of a Lyre, 61 Cygni, 40 (0°)
Eridani, and 6  Cygni. The results are as follows:

Dr. W. Schur has published in the Astronomische Nachrichten (vol.
114, p. 161), a discussion of the parallax of the double star > Aurigze
from measures of position, angle, and distance made with 6-inch Strass-
burg refractor, in 1883-85. The final value for the parallax of the
fainter (ninth magnitude) star is + 0/111 4+ 0” 034. ‘Herr Schur
thinks that he is justified in asserting that the parailax of this star is
at least 0/’.1—a remarkable result, considering the fixity of the object.”

40 (0°?) Hridani.—Mr. J. E. Gore, using Professor Hall’s parallax,

DOUBLE STARS.

Two recent papers on personal equation in double-star observations
will be found of especial interest to those engaged in this class of work.
The first paper forms the subject of a thesis by M. Bigourdan, of the
Paris Observatory, submitted for the degree of doctor of physical
ASTRONOMY. 109

science. M. Bigourdan reviews the work of others in this field, gives
a description of apparatus which he has devised for investigating the
problem by means of artificial stars, and deduces his own personal
equation from a large number of measures made with this apparatus.
He finds that his personal equation is not affected by the position of
the eyes with respect to the line joining the stars nor by the altitude;
‘the brightness of the stars, on the other hand, does affect his measures.

The second paper referred to is by Mr. H. C. Wilson; formerly of the
Cincinnati Observatory, and is published in the Sidereal Messenger
(vol. 5, pp. 174, 211). Mr. Wilson gives an interesting sketch of the
history of the subject, together with an investigation of his personal
errors, obtained from observations made between 1882 and 1886, with
the equatorial of the Cincinnati Observatory. He finds that his meas-
ures, both of position angle and of distance, are slightly influenced
by the inclination of the head.

Spectroscopic method of determining the distance of a double star.—Mr.
A. A. Rambaut, of the Dublin Observatory, in a paper communicated to
the Royal Irish Academy on May 24, 1886, discusses at some length the
possibility of determining the distance of a double star by measures of
the relative velocities of the cemponents in the line of sight. Dr.
Huggins having demonstrated that it was practicable to measure the
rate of approach or recession of a star, it was seen that it would be
at least theoretically possible to determine the distance of a star by
this method. Mr. Rambaut’s critical examination of the conditions of
the problem shows however that the method can have but little prac-
tical application.

Orbits of double stars.—The following table gives the “ period of revo-
lution” in years, and “semi-axis major,” in seconds of arc, obtained for
a number of binary stars in recent determinations of elements:

VARIABLE, NEW, OR TEMPORARY STARS—COLORED STARS.

Observations of variable stars in 1885.—Professor Pickering prints in
the twenty-first volume of the Proceedings of the American Academy
his third annual report upon observatious of variables, giving particu-
110 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

lars of nearly two hundred stars for 1885. The work has been done by
co-operation. All who are willing to assist (a field-glass is sufficient
instrumental equipment), are requested to send accounts of their work
to the Harvard Observatory as soon as possible after the close of each
year. Professor Pickering undertakes to make photometric observa-
tions of all comparison stars needed.

Mr. Espin, the special observer of tbe Liverpool Astronomical Society,
has commenced the issue of a circular calling attention to various vari-
able stars or stars suspected of variability.

Several interesting cases of variability have been discovered by
Messrs. Chandler and Sawyer, of Cambridge. The most interesting case
is a new variable of the Algol type discovered by Mr. Chandler in the
coustellation Cygnus (R. A. 20" 48"; Decl. + 34° 14’). The range is from
7.1 magnitude to 7.8 magnitude, the whole variation taking place in
about six hours. The only doubt is in regard to the interval during
which the star remains at its normal magnitude. Mr. Chandler sus-
pects that the whole duration between two successive periods of change
will be found to be about one day, twelve hours.

Gores new variable near y' Orionis (Nova Orionis)—A mass of obser-
vatious by skillful observers has accumulated, and will repay a thor-
ough study.

It seems to be clearly established that this interesting star is a sim-
ple variable, and not one of the class to which the title “ temporary ”
can properly be applied. M. Dunér, who observed the star at inter-
als from December, 1885, to April, 1886, found (Astron. Nachr., No.
2755), on renewing his observations at the end of October and the
beginning of November, 1886, that it had unmistakably increased
in brightness in the interval, and was cuntinuing to do so. Herr
Fr. Schwab and Mr. Espin confirm this conclusion, the former having
observed the star early in last July, and having found it then fainter
than the twelfth magnitude. Its period would appear to be not far
from one year; Herr Schwab gives it as one or two weeks longer than
one year, and asranging in brightness from the sixth magnitude to 123,
whilst M. Dunér assigns a period of 359.5 days. (Nature.)

According to Dr. Vogel and others who have examined its spectrum,
it belongs to Type II] a, resembling the spectrum of a Orionis.

The new star in the great nebula of Andromeda.—Professor Seeliger
has published (Astron, Nachr., No. 2710) an interesting paper contain-
ing an attempt to represent the observed variations of the light of the
Nova in Andromeda by a formula expressing the rate of cooling of a
hotsphere. Supposing that such a body has its temperature suddenly
increased to an enormous extent by some shock, its brightness will of
course be increased also. And assuming that the latter is proportional
to the xth power of the temperature, and using Pogson’s seale for trans-
forming brightness into stellar magnitude, Professor Seeliger (making
ASTRONOMY. tl

some further more or less probable assumptions) deduces an expres-
sion for the magnitude of the cooling star at any time. In order to
compare this formula with Herr Miiller’s photometric measures of the
Nova, extending from 1885, September 2, to October 13, Professor Seel-
iger assumes that n=1, and that the epoch for which the time t=0,
is 1885, August 27,8" Berlin mean time. Using quite approximate
values of the constants involved in his formula, it appears that there is
a good general agreement (the mean discordance being 0.11 of a stellar
magnitude) between the computed and observed values. The computed
magnitude corresponding to the epoch for which t=0, is 7.73. The fair
agreement shown by this comparison induces Professor Seeliger to
think that the form of the expression which he has deduced is such as
would. accurately represent the observations, provided that it were pos-
sible to determine the necessary constants with sufficient precisicn.
And as there is evidence to show that the nebula in Andromeda is,
partly at least, composed of a vast number of faint stars, it appears, in
Professor Seeliger’s opinion, not unreasonable to suppose that a collis-
ion was the cause of the sudden development of heat and light which
revealed itself to us as the appearance of a *“‘ new” star.

With reference to the point thus raised by Professor Seeliger, Herr
Auwers points out (Astron. Nachr., No. 2715) that the great similarity of
the outburst in Andromedain 1885 to the phenomenon observed by him
in 1860 in the cluster 80 Messier in Scorpio is a strong confirmation of
Professor Seeliger’s views. The probability that two variable stars of
such exceptional character should be projected, in one case on a close
star-cluster, in the other case on an object which appears to be, in
part at least, a close star-cluster, is So small that it is almost necessary
to refer these outbursts to physical changesin the nebule in which they
respectively appeared. (Observatory, April, 1886.)

Dr. Milis (Nature 33 : 440) in criticising Professor Seeliger’s collision
hypothesis suggests that the blazing out of the Nova may be merely a
physico-chemical consequence of cooling; and it has been pointed out
by Mr. Castell-Evans (Nature, 33: 486) that practically the same expla-
nation was suggested in 1878 by Prof. R. Meldola in a paper published
in the Philosophical Magazine for July of that year. Professor Mel-
dola says: “‘ It is conceivable that in certain cases the composition of
a Star’s atmosphere may be such as to permit a considerable amount of
cooling before any combination takes place among its constituents; un-
der such circumstances a sudden catastrophe might mark the period of
combination, and a starof feeble light would blaze forth suddenly, as
occurred in 1866 to zt Corone Borealis. In other cases, again, it is
possible that the composition of a star’s atmosphere may be of such a
nature as to lead to a state of periodically unstable chemical equilib-
rium ; that is to say, during a certain period combination may be going
on with the accompanying evolution of heat, till at length dissociation
112 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

again begins to take place. In this manner the phenomena of many
variable stars may perhaps be accounted for.”

Dr. von Kévesligethy observing with a 7-inch Merz equatorial at the
observatory of Baron Podmaniezky at Kis Kartal, in Hungary, an-
nounced the re-appearance of the Nova on September 26, 1886. From
this date he found that it became more star-like, and up to the evening
of Octeber 2 both nucelus and new star were visible. From October
2 to October 17 the old nucleus was invisible. By October 23 the nu-
cleus had assumed its normal state, but the new star was not seen.
A number of telescopes were immediately turned upon the nebula, but
in the main failed to detect the changes suspected. (See Astron. Nachr.,
2750-2752.) Itis probable that the object seen was one of the very
faint points of light known to exist near the nucleus of the nebula.

A very complete series of observations of Nova Andromede is given
by Dr. Copeland, of the Dun Echt Observ aoe in the Monthly No-
tices for December, 1856.

Catalogue of colored stars.—Mr. W.S. Franks has presented to the
Royal Astronomical Society a catalogue (not printed, apparently) of
1,730 colored stars situated between the pole and —20° of declination,
and including all stars down to the 6.-5 magnitude. The introduction
to this catalogue, giving a tabular. analysis of the colors recorded, is
published in the Monthly Notices for April, 1886.

We should mention also a list of thirty-one prominent colored stars of
the southern hemisphere published by Mr. A. S. Williams in the Astro-
nomical Register for October.

Mr. Chambers stated at the meeting of the Royal Astronomical So-
ciety on March 12, 1886, that he was preparing a catalogue of red stars.

STELLAR PHOTOMETRY.

Photometric observations at Harvard College Observatory.—Professor
Pickering, in his annual report, states that 59,800 separate photometric
comparisons were made with the meridian photometer in 1886, The in-
strument has been found to give entire satisfaction both in the accuracy
and the rapidity of its work. Various tests have been applied to de-
tect the presence of systematic errors, but so far with negative results.
“A comparison of the seven hundred stars common to the observations
of Wolff, Pritchard, and the Harvard Photometry, showed that our re-
sults differed on the average from Wolff, after allowance for systematic
differences, by 0.140 of a magnitude; from Pritchard by 0.145; while
Wolff and Pritchard differed from each other by 0.192. A comparison
of the fifty five stars proposed by Professor Pritchard as standards, and
measured by him on several nights, showed that the average deviation
from the Harvard Photometry was only 0.104. - - - A comparison
between the results obtained at Pulkowaand Cambridge shows that the
average deviation of a measurement of the difference in brightness be-

tween two stars observed at both places does not exceed one-tenth of
a magnitude.”

The principal work of the meridian photometer, the revision of the
Durchmusterung magnitudes, is now approaching completion, nine-
tenths of the observations having already been made. During 1887 the
observing list will be extended to include stars in the first 20° of south
declination.

Observations of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites, comparison stars
for variables, ete., are made with the photometer attached to the 15-
inch equatorial.

A comparison of photometric methods.—Mr. 8. C. Chandler, jr., pre-
sented at the Buffalo meeting of the American Association an important
paper on ‘A comparative estimate of methods and results in stellar
photometry,” in which he reaches the conclusion (also reached by Dr.
G. Miiller, of Potsdam,—Vrtljschr. d. astron. Gesellsch., 20 : 261-267),
that the photometers now in use give no advantage, in point of accu-
racy, over direct eye-estimates of differences in magnitude made accord-
ing to Argelander’s well known method. With regard to accidental
errors, Mr. Chandler concludes that ‘‘ eye-estimates” are nearly three
times as accurate as photometric measures, and he also points out that
several variables have been detected and their periods and light-curves
well determined by careful eye-estimates, whose whole range of bright-
ness is no greater than the range of error in photometric observations.
Reference should be made to Mr. Chandler’s paper in the Astronomische
Nachrichten, vol. 115, p. 145, merely an abstract of his communication
having been published in the Proceedings of the American Associa-
tion.

A proposed new catalogue of magnitudes of southern stars.—Mr. E. F,
Sawyer, of Cambridge, has been at work since 1882 upon a determina-
tion of the relative magnitude of the stars included between the equa-
tor and 30° of south declination, and not fainter than the seventh mag-
nitude. The observations are made with an opera glass (magnifying
two and a half times) put slightly out of focus. The number of stars
comprised will approximate 3,500, and the average number of observa-
tions for each star will be about three and‘ one-half. Mr. Sawyer finds
from 593 stars, each observed twice, that the average difference between
two independent determinations of a magnitude of a star is 0.112 of a
magnitude, which corresponds to a probable error of a single observa-
tion of +0.065. It is expected that the work will be completed and
ready for publication within a year.

STELLAR SPECTRA.

Photographic study of stellar spectra at Harvard College Observatory.—
Professor Pickering has announced in his annual report an extensive
investigation in stellar spectra, by means of photography, undertaken

H. Mis. 600-—-—8
114 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

at the Harvard Observatory. Provision has been made by Mrs. Dra-
per for meeting the expenses of this work, as a memorial to her hus-
band, the late Dr. Henry Draper.

Three researches are now in progress.

The first includes a general survey of stellar spectra. Each spectrum
is photographed with an exposure of not less than five minutes, and
these photographs generally exhibit the spectra of all stars brighter
than the sixth magnitude with sufficient distinctness for measurement.
The greater portion of the sky north of —30° has been surveyed in this
work, which will be repeated during the coming year. One hundred
and fifty-one plates have been measured and 5,431 spectra examined
and classified. Of these 4,148 have been identified and the name and
position of the corresponding star entered opposite each. The com-
pleted work will form a catalogue probably containing three or four
thousand stars, each photographed on several plates.

The second research relates to a determination of the spectra of the
fainter stars. Each photograph taken in the course of this research
receives an exposure of one hour, so that the spectra of ali the stars
not fainter than the eighth or ninth magnitude, and included in a region
ten degrees square, are represented upon the plate. On fifty-eight
plates 2,416 spectra have been measured, and of these 2,359 have been
identified.

In both of these investigations the 8-inch Bache telescope has been
employed.

The third research relates to a more careful study of the spectra of
the brightest stars. For this work Mrs. Draper has lent the 11-inch
photographic lens employed by her husband. She has also furnished
an admirable mounting for the instrument and a small observatory to
contain it. Two prisms have been constructed to place in front of the
object-glass, the large one having a clear aperture of 11 inches square
and an angle of nearly 15°, the other being somewhat smaller. The
preliminary results attained with this apparatus are highly promising.

A recent photograph of the region in Cygnus where four stars were
known, exhibiting the interesting peculiarity of bright-line spectra,
brought out four more spectra of the same kind. One of these is the
comparatively bright star P Cygni, in which bright lines, apparently
due to hydrogen, are distinctly visible. This phenomenon recalls the
circumstances of the outburst of light in the star T Coron, especially
when the former history of P Cygni's considered. According to Schon-
feld, it first attracted attention as an apparently new star in 1600, and
fluctuated greatly during the seventeenth century, finally becoming a
star of the fifth magnitude, and so continuing to the present time.
Another of the stars shown by the photograph to have bright lines is
DM. + 37°, 3821, where the lines are unmistakably evident.

ASTRONOMICAL PHOTOGRAPHY.

The improvements in astronomical photography during the past two
years, following the introduction of the modern dry plates, have at-
tracted wide-spread attention, and the great merits of the new method
scarcely call for any exaggeration in order to establish photography
permanently as a means for astronomical research. We find Greenwich,
Harvard, Paris, Cape of Good Hope, and Lick taking steps to make
stellar photography a part of their routine work, and arrangements have
been made by Admiral Mouchez for holding an international conference
at Paris in April, 1887, for the purpose of elaborating a plan of co-op-
eration in photographing the whole sky. It is hoped that ten or twelve
observatories will be ready to co-operate and that all will be supplied
with instruments of the same power, so that the work will form a homo-
geneous whole. It will require 11,000 plates of 4° each to cover the sky,
and ten years will probably be necessary for the completion of the un-
dertaking. ,

Stellar photography at the Paris Observatory.—An article in Nature
(May 13, 1886), which gives a wood-cut of the apparatus used by tie
Messrs. Henry, gives also the following table of the time of exposure re-
quired (with the Monckhoven gelatino-bromide plates) to obtain stars
of different degrees of brightness:

These figures represent a minimum. To secure good reproductions
on paper the time of exposure would have to be increased threefold. A
two hours’ exposure gives stars much fainter than Herschel’s debilissima.

The Henrys have successfully photographed the clusters in Hercules,
Sobieski, Ophiuchus, and Perseus, and the major planets. They have
obtained the trail of an eleventh-magnitude asteroid—a fine line among
the stellar points. The new method seenis well adapted, also, to the
search for a trans-Neptunian planet.

The observatories at Algiers and Rio Janeiro are to be supplied with
instruments similar to those at Paris, and an equatorial coudé of 0.6
meter (24 inches) apertue provided with a photographie objective is
to be constructed for the Paris Observatory, to test the adaptability of
this form of instrument for photographie work.
116 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Stellar photography at Harvard College Observatory.—Professor Pick-
ering’s investigations, which were briefly referred to in last year’s re-
port, have been published in full in the Memoirs of the American
Academy (vol. 11, pp. 179-226). His paper contains a sketch of the
history of the subject, description of the apparatus, discussion of
theoretical considerations, and some results obtained in the three depart-
ments of “star-charting, photographing star trails, and spectrum pho-
tography.” His work on the photography of stellar spectra we have
already alluded to in the present review.

In the report of the Harvard Observatory for 1886 it is stated that
the investigation in stellar photography undertaken with the aid of
the Bache fund is now nearly completed. The principal results ob-
tained include photographs of the entire sky north of — 30°, on which
all stars bright enough to leave trails without the aid of clock-work are
depicted. One series of plates exhibits the effect of atmospheric ab-
sorption on nearly every night of observation for a year; and among the
miscellaneous observations may be mentioned some experiments in the
application of photography to transit instruments, which showed that
the accidental errors did not reach one-half of those affecting eye-
observations. Various photographs were taken of the nebula of Orion
to show the relative brightness of different portions of this object.
The nebule in Andromeda, in Lyra, and in the Pleiades were also
photographed. An attempt was made to photograph a satellite of
Jupiter while undergoing eclipse, and thus to determine the time of this
phenomenon.

Astronomical photography at the Lick Observatory.—In a very interest-
ing article upon astronomical photography, published in the Overland
Monthly for November, 1886, Professor Holden thus summarizes the
facilities of the California observatory for investigations in this field:
“We expect to have a photographic objective as large as 36 inches in
aperture, if the glass for this can be obtained. This will be mounted
in the most perfect manner, and we shall employ the 12-inch Clark
telescope, now at the observatory, as a pointing telescope for the large
objective. The 12-inch telescope will be mounted alongside the other.
An electrically-controlled driving clock will keep the two telescopes
accurately directed during the exposure. Our objective will collect nine
times the light of any other photographic telescope now made. - - -
The focal length of the combination will be about 580 inches, and 1” on
the plate will therefore be 0.002 inch. This is a quantity whose =}, part
can easily be measured. A single exposure will give us a map of the
sky comprising four square degrees on a plate 24 by 24 inches. - - -
The sun’s image unmagnified will be 6 incies in diameter; a large sun-
spet will be the size of one’s finger-nail. - - - The photographs of
the moon in the focus of the Lick equatorial will be 6 inches in diam-
eter, and will probably stand an enlargement of twelve times, so as to
be 6 feet finally.”
ASTRONOMY. Ly

Stellar photography at Cordoba.—Dr. Gould, in a paper read at the
Butfalo meeting of the American Association, has described the photo-
graphs taken at Cordoba from 1872 to 1882. About seventy southern
clusters and more than a hundred double stars were repeatedly photo-
graphed. Some sixteen plates of the Pleiades and five of Presepe
were obtained; the total number of photographs being somewhat less
than thirteen hundred. Dr. Gould lays great stress on the necessity
of promptly converting the photographs into a permanent numerical
record: and considerable uneasiness is aroused by the discovery that
the collodion or gelatine films are readily detached from the plates.
Some progress has already been made in the reductions, under Dr,
Gould’s immediate supervision at Cambridge.

Pritchard's *‘ Researches in stellar photography.”—In a paper with the
foregoing title, read at the meeting of the Royal Society, May 27, 1886,
Professor Pritchard gives an account of a number of photographs of
the Pleiades which he has submitted to a critical examination, with the
following objects in view:

(1) To ascertain, by means of definite and accurate measurement, the
relation between the diameter of a star-disk impressed on a photo-
graphic plate with a given exposure, and its photometric magnitude;
a simple formula seems to connect the two. (2) To ascertain whether
the photographic plate remains an absolutely accurate picture of the
actual relative positions of the stars in the sky itself, and, moreover,
whether these are measurable with that extreme degree of precision
which is attainable with the best instrumeutal means. The satisfactory
accordances of measures of different plates have afforded a sufficient
answer to this inquiry. (3) The third subject of investigation was the
relation between the areas of the impressed star-disks and the time of
exposure of the plates. As far as at present appears, these areas vary
as the square root of the time, though the investigation is not to be
regarded as complete. Bond, in 1858, considered that the areas varied
directly as the time.

In the course of his work Professor Pritchard noticed what appeared
to be a distortion of the photographic film on a small portion of the
plate, and he detected a somewhat similar distortion upon one of eight
plates of 61 Cygni and neighboring stars. He has hopes that in the
course of a year the parallax of certain stars will be re-determined by
photography, even to a greater degree of accuracy than has hitherto
been achieved by direct instrumental application.

Professor Harkness has suggested that great increase in the accuracy
of transit observations of the sun would be gained by inserting a sensi-
tive photographic plate just behind the wire system of theinstrument, and
making an instantaneous exposure at the time of the sun’s transit.
This would avoid the disturbance of adjustments of the instrument
arising from the exposure to the sun for several minutes, which is nec-
essary in the present mode of observing. Stars would be observed and

the instrumental constants determined by using the eye-piece in the
usual way.
COMETS.

Professor Bredichin in continuing his researches upon the mathe-
matical theory of comets has re-determined the repulsive forces which
produce the tails of different types. Making use of some forty comets in
his discussion, he has found for tails of type I, a mean value, 1— 4 = 14;
but the comet of 1811, by far the most favorable for the determination
of the repulsive force of this type, gave 17.5, and this represents quite
well the tails of other comets. In this type the initial velocity g varies
from 0.1 to 0.54, the mean being 0.23 (0.1=1.9 miles per second, about).
In type I1 the forces vary from 0.5 to 2.2, and the initial velocities from
0.03 to 0.07, mean 0.05. For the axis of the tail 1—y=1.1. In type
I the repulsive forces lie between 0.1 and 0.3, and the velocities be-
tween 0.01 and 0.02. ‘

Dr. Holetschek’s investigation upon the conditions of visibility of a
comet have been followed up by Dr. W. Meyer, who finds that if the
great comets of 1845, 1880, and 1882 had reached perihelion in May
they would have escaped unobserved. The orbit of the comet seen
during the total eclipse of May 16, 1882, must have been very much
like that of the comet which appeared four months later (1882 II) ; it
seems, indeed, that the observed position can be represented to half a
degree by the elements of the September comet, merely changing the
time of perihelion of the latter and fixing it for the 17th of May. The
ephemeris computed by Dp. Meyer with these elements shows very
plainly why the Sohag comet could not be found after the eclipse, or
had not been detected before; it was too faint when in a position favor-
able for observation. The comet is probably one of a regular stream of
comets with small perihelion distance, such as 1845 I, 1880 I, 1882 II.
If the orbits of the comets of 1845 and 1880 were sufficiently alike in
other respects, the failure in repeated returns would be no objection to
their identity, for if the returns have taken place in the month of May,
the comet must have been invisible. A revolution in thirty-seven
years is hardly to be reconciled, however, with the observations of
1843, and for the great comet of 1882 Frisby has found a period of
seven hundred and ninety-four years.

Mr. Monck, in the Observatory for August and September, brings
out some interesting statistics in support of his view that there exists
a sort of “‘companionship ” among comets—that is, cases in which the
elements show a striking similarity; but it is improbable that the
bodies are identical. Several of the comets of short period exhibit a
family likeness which can hardly be attributed to their capture by
Jupiter unless they previously formed members of a system. The ques-
tion derives further interest from its bearing upon meteoric showers,
for, if a family of comets can be supposed to be accompanied by a
ASTRONOMY. 119

family of meteors, a shower from nearly the same point might continue
for a considerable time, giving rise to stationary radiants to which Mr.
Denning has called attention.

It may not be out of place here to point out the value of physical
observations of cometary phenomena—accurate observations of jets,
tails, brightness, ete.—which may furnish data for testing any theories
of their origin and constitution that may be put forward.

Encke’s comet.—The progress of investigations upon Encke’s comet
may be briefly stated thus: The comet which has now been observed at
twenty-four apparitions since its first discovery in 1786 ‘‘ was shown
by Encke to be subject to a remarkable decrease in the length of its
period, a decrease which could not be accounted for by the attract-
ive force of the sun and planets. Encke surmised that this was pro-
duced by the effects of a resisting medium. His calculations, which
extended up to 1848, were continued by von Asten, who in a great
measure confirmed Encke’s conclusions, but found the curious anomaly
that between the apparitions of 1865 and 1871, the acceleration of the
mean motion which had been exhibited until the former of these years
ceased to appear. Since the death of von Asten the work has been con-
tinued by Dr. Backlund, who has succeeded in showing that the appar-
ent anomaly in question was due to an error in the formule of pertur-
bations employed, and vanished when this was corrected. He was led
however to the remarkable and interesting result that the acceleration
of the mean motion of the comet is subject to a progressive diminution,
and amounted between 1871 and 1885 to scarcely one-half of what it
was between 1819 and 1865.” It was reduced from 0/.104 to 0.062.
It seems very probable that about the year 1868 the acceleration under-
went a change, due no doubt to some unknown modification in the
physical condition of the comet.

Dr. Backlund has recently resumed his labors, which were inter-
rupted by illness, and the first memoir, relating to the return in 1885,
has just been printed; the second, treating of the comet’s motion since
1865, will soon be presented to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences;
while the third, which is in preparation, will comprise the period 1819-
1868. For these researches the author has been awarded the Lalande
prize of the Paris Academy.

Comet Tempel-Swift.—Bossert has given in the Bulletin astronomique
an elaborate discussion of the orbit of the comet discovered by Tempel
in 4869, but not recognized as periodic till its rediscovery by Swift in
1880. The period is about five and one-half years, but the comet es-
caped notice in 1875 and again in 1856.

Comet 1873 VII.—M. Schulhof has published (Bull. astron., 3: 125 et
Seq.) a discussion of the orbit of this comet, and has gone into the ques-
tion of its possible identity with 1818 I and 1457 I (the observations of
which by Toscanelli have recently been discussed by Professor Celoria).
120 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

His conclusion, expressed with some reserve, is that 1873 VII and 1818 [
are distinct bodies, with a short period of revolution but having a com-
mon origin. Comet 1457 Lis probably identical with 1873 VII, but it is
also possible that the two comets 1873 VII and 1818 I are fragments of
1457 I.

Comet 1877 V1.—Dr. Larssén, of Upsala, has completed the definitive
determination of parabolic elements of the comet discovered by Coggia
at Marseilles on September 14, 1877, and observed to December 10 of
that year. The observations have been newly reduced and combined
in five normal places, with a very satisfactory result. (Astron. Nachr.
116 : 23-26.)

Comet 1881 V.—The close agreement of the elements with those of the
orbit of a comet discovered by Blanpain on the 28th of November, 1819,
has led to a conjecture that the two comets are identical, although Blan-
pain’s was computed to have a period of less than five years and Den-
ning’s of nearly nine, it being supposed that planetary perturbation
had lengthened the period between the appearance of 1819 and that of
1881. It has been noticed both by Mr. Plummer and by Mr. Denning
that the longitude of the ascending node of the 1881 comet corresponds
almost exactly with that of the descending node of Biela’s comet, which
has not been seen as a comet (or rather double comet) since 1852, though
it has been supposed to be connected with a very brilliant meteoric dis-
play seen on the 27th of November, 1872. The other elements of Den-
ning’s comet exhibit a remarkable agreement with those of Biela’s
comet; and the suggestion in question is that these comets are identi-
cal, or rather that Denning’s is identical witb the principal remaining
portion of Biela’s, which underwent violent perturbation through near
approach to the earth in 1872, sufficient to lengthen its period and
reverse the nodes (a necessary consequence of altering the inclina-
tion through zero). Colonel Tupman, whose calculations well confirm
this theory, remarks “that on the 27th of November, 1872, it is prob-
able that the comet was very near the earth and mixed up with the
meteoric shower.” The comet passed its perihelion on the 13th of Sep-
tember, 1881; the computed length of its period was 8.83 years, or about
3,225 days; and this was almost exactly the interval which had elapsed
since the meteoric display of the 27th of November, 1872. If this theory
be true, we can not expect another similarly brilliant display on that
day until the year 1916, five periods of the comet’s revolution in its or-
bit being very nearly equal to forty-four of the earth’s. (Athenzeum.)

Comet 1881 VIII.—Olsson finds a period of 612 years; that found by
Oppenheim was 2,740 years, though Oppenheim remarks that 900 years
would satisfy the observations almost as well.

Comet 1882 II.—The valuable series of observations of this comet
made at the Cape of Good Hope, including the remarkable observation
of the disappearance of the comet at the limb of the sun, has been pub-
lished as vol. 11, part 1, of the Annals of the Cape Observatory. Inter-
ASTRONOMY. ; A boa

esting observations of the tail, accompanied by numerous sketches, are
found in vol. 1 of the Publications of the McCormick Observatory, the
observers being Messrs. Leavenworth and Jones.

Comets of 1886.—Nine comets passed perihelion in 1886; three of them
visible to the naked eye. One was a well-known periodic comet return:
ing at the appointed time, and two of the new-comers appear to be
periodic, one of them identical possibly with De Vico’s lost comet of
1844. Olbers’s comet of 1815 was not detected, but as an uncertainty of
some three years exists in the period of revolution, it may be picked up
during the coming year. The Tempel-Swift comet due at perihelion on
May 9 seems to have escaped notice on account of its excessive faint-
ness. Of these nine comets, three belong to Barnard, three to Brooks,
two were found by Finlay, and one by Fabry; two were discovered in
1885, one in 1887; leaving six discovered in 1886. Comet 1886 IX was
picked up by three observers independently, on three successive morn-
ings in October, showing what a careful watch is kept by comet-hunt-
ers. Warner prizes to the amount of $800 were paid for the captures.
Comet 1886 I: | This comet, as noted in last year’s report, was dis-

=Comet d1835. | covered on December 1, 1885, at Paris. From a

=Fabry’s comet. faint little patch of nebulosity it grew steadily in
size and brightness, and on March 29, 1886, Fabry described it as hav-
ing a diffused nucieus about 15” in diameter, comparable with a star of
the seventh magnitude; a tail about 20’ long and 4’ broad, was thrust
out in a position angle of 325°, while the nebulosity extended about 1’. 5
beyond the head. It became rapidly more prominent, and on April 3
was visible without difficulty to the naked eye. On April 23 the head
was as bright as a third-magnitude star, and the tail 4° long. The
greatest length of the tail was probably about 9°, but the comet was not
aw very conspicuous object on account of its slight elevation above the
horizon before sunrise, ayd also on account of the moon-light. Itis said
to have remained visible to the naked eye from the early part of April
to beyond the middle of May. Observations were continued in the
southern hemisphere until about the end of July.

The determination of the orbit presented some difficulties, and the
elements from early observations were not entirely accordant. Dr. S.
Oppenheim’s elements (Astron. Nachr., 2722), derived from observa-
tions extending to March 28, placed perihelion passage on April 5, 1886;
the nearest point to the earth and greatest brilliancy (about four hun-
dred and seventy-five times as bright as when discovered) were reached
about May 1.

The spectrum was studied by Trépied, Perrotin, Rayet, Vogel, and
others. The three bands common to comets and hydrocarbons were
found—the central band, perhaps, somewhat intensified ; and besides
these bands there was also a continuous spectrum.

Dr. Muller, of Potsdam, has published in the Nachrichten (No. 2733)

ea RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

a very interesting series of photometric observations of this comet and
of the comet discovered by Barnard on December, 18385. ‘ The observa-
tions extended over the months of March and April, 1886; and both
comets were increasing in brightness. Reducing the measures to a dis-
tance unity, the intrinsic brilliancy seems to have been tolerably con-
stant; from which it may be concluded that the comets shone almost en-
tirely with borrowed light. This conclusion is confirmed by Dr. Miiller’s
spectroscopic observations, according to which the continuous spectrum
predominates. Trépied, on the other hand, found thatin Fabry’s comet
the proportion of reflected sunlight was small, gaseous elements pre-
dominating and the bands being much brighter than the continuous
spectrum. Dr. Miiller remarks that his observations show no effect of
phase, and he suggests that this may be due to a variation in the in-
herent light of the comet as it approaches the sun and earth, or we may
assume that the nucleus is made up of discrete particles by which the
phase phenomena must to a great extent be modified.

Comet 1886 IT: A brief account of this eomet was given last year,
=Comet e 1885. as it was discovered by Barnard on December 3,
=Barnard’s comet. | 1885, with a 6-inch Cooke equatorial. A small tail

about 15’ long was detected by Tempel as early as December 31. In

April and May the comet developed into quite a fine object with stellar

nucleus and fan-shaped tail, 2° or 3° in length. It was seen with the

naked eye on May 7 and 12 by Mr. Barnard, at Nashville, and on May

31 and June 3 by Mr. Tebbutt, at Windsor, New South Wales. The

last observation published was made on July 19, at Cordoba. <A care.

ful series of ‘extinction observations” is given by Dr. Holetschek in

the Nachrichten, No. 2739. The spectroscope showed the three ordi-

nary cometary bands, with faint, continuous spectrum of the nucleus.
The latest elements computed by Thraen from observations between

December 5, 1885, and May 10, 1886, place perihelion passage on May

3, and give aslightly hyperbolic orbit (eccentricity =1.0004). Whether

the curve really differs from a parabola can not be decide] until all the

observations, including those from southern observatories, can be taken
into account. Morrison has obtained hyperbolic elements agreeing
tolerably well with those of Thraen. Earlier elements showed a slight
resemblance to comet 1785 11, but it is not probable that the comets are

identical. .

Comet 1886 III: | This was discovered by Mr. W. R. Brooks,
—Comet b 1886. | at Phelps, New York, on April 30, 1886, or
=Comet 1886..-.(Brooks 2). | in civil reckoning on the morning of May

1; his second comet within four days. Mr. Brooks described it as hav-

ing a small but bright and star-like head, and a conspicuous tail. On

May 4 there was a tail 10’ or 12’ long; very bright near the origin.

Engelhardt, on May 6, found the tail 40’ long and nearly straight, while

8’ from the nucleus there was a faint secondary tail bending towards

the south. Pechiile, observing from May 3 to May 12, detected two

nuclei or condensations in the head. Barnard says it was a most sin-
gular looking telescopic comet—‘ a perfect miniature of the naked-eye
appearance of a great comet.” It does not seem to have been observed
beyond the last week of May, when its theoretical brightness was about
half that at the time of discovery.

According to Wendell’s elements the comet passed perihelion on May
5. Dr. Weiss called attention to the fact that at the ascending node
the orbit approached quite near the orbit of the earth, so that when the
earth passed the line of nodes, July 9, a meteoric shower visible in the
southern hemisphere might result from particles following in the wake
of the comet. We believe, however, that no unusual display was re-

ported.

orbit with a period of about nine years. Dr. Hind makes the period
very much shorter, not much more, in fact, than six and a quarter years,
according to which the comet would return in the autumn of 1892. The
perihelion passage took place on June 6 or 7. A new discussion of the
orbit has been undertaken by Drs. Oppenheim and Bidschof, of Vienna.

was of the eighth magnitude, and May 21 and 25, sixth to seventh mag-
nitude with nearly circular coma 2’ 20’ in diameter. Dr. Krueger's ele-
ments show that the comet’s nearest approach to the sun, 0.27 (the

ion was passed on August 19, about twelve days earlier than predicted
by Dr. A. Palisa. An attempt was made at Paris to photograph the

in diameter, with some central condensation, and no tail.” The pos-
sible identity with ‘De Vico’s lost comet,” 1844 I, (for which Briin-
now found a period of 5.5 years), immediately attracted attention, and
elliptic elements have been calculated by Boss, Krueger, Oppenheim,
and Holetschek. The computation of the orbit presents some difficul-
ties, and it is impossible to settle the question of identity until all ob-
servations at this return have received a thorough discussion—if it can
be settled then. The last set of elements obtained by Professor Boss
(Asiron. Journ., v. 3, p. 43) place perihelion passage on November 22,
1886, and give an approximate period of 6.675 years. With tuis period
the comet, if undisturbed, should return to the sun in July, 1893, under
conditions quite favorable for observation. It is still visible, nearly
five months after discovery.

was an easy object in the telescope, and developed a tail early in

October. By October 29 the nucleus was as bright as a star of the

eighth magnitude, and the comet was visible to the naked eye as an ill-

defined spot. Two distinct tails were detected about this time, and

Barnard found a third on November 23. The comet was now easily

seen with the naked eye, as conspicuous as a star of the fourth magni-

tude, with a slender train traceable for 7° or 8°. The tail seems to
have reached a maximum length of about 10° during the first week of

December, the theoretical brightness of the comet being then about

twenty-five times that at discovery.

Ricco, of Palermo, found the spectrum composed of the three hydro-
carbon bands, of which the middle one (green) was longest and bright-
est. The spectrum of the nucleus was continuous, but re-enforced at
the bright bands.

Elements computed by Lieutenant Allen from observations reaching
to December 10 show that perihelion was passed on December 16, 1886.

METEORS AND THE ZODIACAL LIGHT.
a

The Biela meteors of November 27, 1885.—Professor Newton has col-
lected all the published data in regard to this great shower, and has
submitted it to a thorough discussion in an article of nearly twenty
pages of the American Journal of Science for June, 1886.

We quote merely his summary statement of conclusions :

1, The maximum of the shower was near 6 15" Greenwich mean time.

‘©2. Three hours after the maximum the number of meteors had dimin-
ished to one-tenth the maximum number, and it is not unreasonable to
assume six hours as containing the principal part of the shower.

‘3. The total hourly number of meteors visible at one place in a very
clear sky to some one or other of a very large group of observers may
at maximum be regarded as 75,000.

‘4, In the densest part of the meteor stream, where and when the
earth encountered it, the space that corresponded to each meteoroid
was equal to a cube whose edge was about 20 English miles.

‘‘5, The dense part of the stream was not over 100,000 miles in thick-
ness.

“6, The zenithal attraction of the Biela meteors was about one-tenth
of the observed zenith distance of the radiant.

“7, The radiant was an area several degrees across.

“8, It is reasonable to suppose that the meteoroids, while in the upper
part of the atmosphere, before the paths become luminous, change di-
rection by a glancing due to irregularity of form. After the resistance
has developed heat enough to melt or burn off projecting angles of the
stones, and the tracks become luminous, the forms of the bodies become
rounded in front and the paths described are straight lines.

“9. The meteoroids encountered by the earth on the 27th of Novem-
ber, in 1872 and in 1885, did not leave the immediate neighborhood of
the Biela comet earlier than 1841-45, and may be treated as having at
that time orbits osculating that of the comet. The determination of the
paths of these meteoroids through their five and seven last revolutions
about the sun seems to be a problem capable of complete solution.”

Professor Newton’s presidential address at the Buffalo meeting of the
American Association, on “ Meteorites, meteors, and shooting stars,”
has been published in Science (8 : 169-76), and in Nature (34 : 532-36).

M. P. F. Denza reports that a careful watch maintained on the night
of November 27, 1886, at seven observatories on the Italian peninsula,
showed no repetition of the great shower of 1885. This would indicate
that the stream is of small extent but very dense, and would tend to
strengthen the hypothesis that it originated in the recent disintegra-
tion of Biela’s comet. »

Herr Forster finds for the radiant points of the great meteor showers
of 1872 and 18°35:

1872 R. A. 23°.3 Decl. + 43°.8.
1885 239.5 + 43°.3.
126 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

A recent bulletin of the New Eugland Meteorological Society gives
a discussion, b¥ Professor Newton, of a meteor seen on September 6,
1886, height, time and place of appearance and disappearance, ete. It
is desired that observers should report the position of bright meteors,
noting their paths among the stars, and trails, if any, with as much
accuracy and detail as possible.

Mr. Denning publishes in the Monthly Notices for November some
interesting results he has obtained from the study of a catalogue of
more than 82,000 meteors from 3,035 radiants. Mr. Denning himself
contributes to his catalogue no less than 7,000 meteors. He also, in
another place, calls attention to the marked agreement between the
orbit of Halley’s comet and a pronounced meteor shower with radiant
close to y Aquarii. The maximum shower occurs about May 6. This
radiant needs further observation.

Relation of the zodiacal light to Jupiter.—Dr. Geelmuyden, speaking
of Professor Searle’s researches upon the zodiacal light, says: “If the
zodiacal matter has the same position among meteoric matter in general
as comets of short period among comets, it is to be expected that the
fundamental plane of the zodiacal light will have some relation to Jupi-
ter as the principal motor in deflecting the orbits, and therefore in col-
lecting the matter. Now it is worth remarking that the most north-
erly point of Jupiter’s orbit has the heliocentric longitude 188°, or with
60° east elongation 178° geocentric longitude; and for matter in the
same plane, but nearer the sun, the approximation to coincidence with
160° is still greater.”

THE SUN.

Motion of the solar system in space.—Several attempts have lately been
made to obtain the direction and rate of motion of the solar system in
space. These results are discordant among themselves, and, as the in-
vestigators have remarked, are not entitled to very great weight, on
account of the meagerness of the data available, but it may not be with-
out interest to give the values obtained.

Herr Homann, from a discussion of the spectroscopic observations
made at Greenwich, and from the observations of Huggin and Sea-
broke, finds:

ASTRONOMY. 127

There is only a rough sort of agreement, but all three unite in
placing the apex considerably in advance, in right ascension, of the
apex as found from the proper motions of stars by Struve, Airy, Dun-
kin, and others (the mean position generally assigned is, R. A. 260°;
Decl. +35°), while Struve found a velocity of translation of only
about 44 miles per second.

Herr Homann is inclined to think that the velocity of translation of
the sun does not differ very much from the velocity of the earth in its
orbit, that is, 184 miles per second. Dr. von Koévesligethy in 1883 found
from spectroscopic observations that the rate of motion of the solar
system was 8.6 geographical miles per second. The spectroscopic ob-
servations were insufficient to determine the direction, and he assumed
the apex in R. A. 2169.0, Deel. +35°.1.

Dr. Ubaghs, of Liege, in making a preliminary examination of the
aberration due to the motion of the solar system, pointed out by M.
Folie, has obstained a result which would give a velocity of only about
180 feet per second.

The velocity of light and the solar parallax.—Professor Newcomb has
published in vol. 2 of the ** Astronomical papers prepared for the use
of the American Ephemeris” the details of his researches on the velocity
of light, made during the summer months of 1880, 1881, and 1882. The
apparatus used, to which the name “ photo-tachometer” has been given,
is a modified form of Foucault’s revolving mirror. The result obtained
for the velocity of light in vacuo is 299,860 kilometers, or 186,327 miles
per second, with a probable error of 50 kilometers. Michelson found
in 1879 a velocit:7 of 299,910 kilometers, and repeating his work at Cleve-
land in 1882, he obtained 299,853. Accepting the value 299,860 as the
true one, it becomes of interest to consider the value thereby deducible
for the parallax and distance of thesun. The latest and probably the
most accurate determination of the constant of aberration is that of
Dr. Nyrén, 20.492. Combining this with the above velocity of light and
Clarke’s value of the earth’s equatorial radius (6,378.2 kilometers), we
obtain 8.794 for the value of the solar parallax, almost exactly the same
as that obtained from heliometer observations of Mars in 1877. The cor-
responding distance of the sun is 92,960,000 miles.

With regard to a possible difference between the velocities of rays of
different colors, it is pointed out that the phenomena of variable stars
seem to be conclusive-against the hypothesis of any such difference.
Were there a difference of one hour in the times of the blue and the red
rays reaching us from Algol, this star would show a well-marked color-
ation in its phases of increase and decrease. No such effect, however,
has been noticed. Recent researches by Professors Michelson and Mor-
ley have led to a similar result.

Transit of Venus Commission is being rapidly carried to completion

under the immediate supervision of Prof. William Harkness. The re-
ductions of observations made at the various stations for time, latitude
and longitude are finished, the determination of longitudes having re-
quired a thorough examination of all the great chains of telegraphic
longitude. A volume containing all of the observations for 1874—all of
the 1874 work except the discussion of the photographs—is now in press.

Dr. Auwers reports, under date of January 11, 1886, that the reduc-
tions of the German heliometer measures are well advanced and that
the printing has been begun; and M. Bouquet de la Grye announces
for the French commission that the photographic plates, 1,019 in num-
ber, have been measured, and that the reductions are now half done,
and will be finished about the end of 1887.

Theory of sun-spots.—Professor Young, in an article on “ Recent ad-
vances in solar astronomy,” makes the following comments upon an
important paper by M. Belopolsky, of the Moscow Observatory. pub-
lished in the Astronomische Nachrichten, No. 2722:

‘Some recent investigations upon the rotation of fluid masses, by
Jukowsky, of Moscow, as applied to solar conditions by his colleague Bel-
opolsky, seem to warrant a hope that the phenomena of surface-drift in
longitude, and even the periodicity of the spots, may soon find a ra-
tional explanation as necessary results of the slow contraction of a non-
homogeneous and mainly gaseous globe. The subject is difficult and
obscure; but if it can be proved, as seems likely, that on mechanical
principles, the time of rotation of the central portions of such a whirl-
ing mass must be shorter than that of the exterior, then there will be
of necessity an interchange of matter between the inside and outside of
the sphere, a slow surface-drift from equator toward the poles, a more
rapid internal current along and near the axis from the poles toward
the equator, a continual ‘ boiling up’ of internal matter on each side of
the equator, and, finally, just such an eastward drift near the equator as
is actually observed. Moreover, the form of the mass, and the intensity
of the drift and consequent ‘boiling-up’ from underneath might and
probably would be subject to great periodic variations.

‘This theory falls in well with the facts established by Spoerer
respecting the motion of the sun-spot zones, and the general though
slow poleward movement of sun-spots.”

Sun-spot observations at Kaloesa.—A summary (Astron. Nachr., 116:
31) of sun-spot observations at Kaloesa, 1880-1885, shows the predom-
inance of spots in the southern hemisphere of the sun over those in the
northern hemisphere, particularly well marked, since the beginning of
1883. <A similarresult is shown in the Greenwich observations, and has
also been pointed out by Dr. Spoerer; on the other hand, from 1880 to
1883 the northern hemisphere had the greater number of spots. It has
been noticed, furthermore, that since 1880 the spots show a tendency
towards the equatorial zones.
ASTRONOMY. 129

Observation of sun-spot spectra.—Professor Young mentions a some-
what curious observation of sun-spot spectra, which he has recently
made. He finds that under high dispersion the spectrum of the darkest
part of the spot is not continuous, but is made up of countless fine,
dark lines, for the most part touching or slightly overlapping, but leay-
ing here and there unoccupied intervals which look like (and may be)
bright lines. ‘‘It seems to indicate that the principal absorption which
darkens the center of the sun-spot is not such as would be caused by
minute solid or liquid particles—by smoke or cloud, which would give
a continuous spectrum ; but itis a true gaseous absorption, producing
a veritable dark-line spectrum, in which the lines are countless and con-
tiguous.”

Solar activity in 1886.—According to Professor Tacchini’s observa-
tions (Comptes Rendus, 103: 120; 104: 216), it appears that there was a
decided falling off in the number and size of sun-spots during the year
1886. In March, however, there was a considerable temporary increase }
and on the 8th of May a magnificent group of spots was visible in the
sun’s northern latitude. A well-marked minimum occurred in November,
and rather peculiar ‘‘secondary minima” seem to have fallen in the
months of February, May, and August. Prominences also showed a
diminution in number and size compared with those seen in 1885, but
the fluctuations were much fewer than in the case of the spots. <A par-
ticularly remarkable eruption was observed on March 9 and 10.

Professor Tacchini places the last great minimum of spots in March,
1879, and the last maximum in February, 1884; if then the decrease
in the number of spots during the latter part of 1886 corresponds to a
new minimum, we shall have an interval from the last maximum of
only 2.8 years, whereas the mean interval is Seven years. So short an
interval between maximum and minimum is very exceptional, for the
shortest known since 1750 is 4.3 years; the longest is ten years.

Lotal eclipse of the sun, August 28-29, 1886.—A party consisting of
Lockyer, Tacchini, Schuster, Maunder, Perry, and others, was sent out
by the British Government to the island of Grenada, in the West Indies,
to observe the total eclipse of August 28-29, 1886. A full review of
the results of the expedition can not be given until the detailed report
is ready. Preliminary accounts show that only one division of the
party, that with Mr. Lockyer at Green Island, failed entirely on ac-
count of clouds, though the observations at some of the other stations
were more or less interfered with. Photometric observations and pho-
tographs of the corona and of its spectrum were obtained, and also
good spectra of the prominences, showing the bright lines of highly
incandescent vapors. In this respect the result resembles that obtained
in the two previous eclipses, though it was thought possible that this
year, being one when sun-spots were tending to a minimum, would be
marked by the more continuous spectrum that bespeaks lower tempera-

ture.

130 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 18886.

Prof. W. H. Pickering, of Boston, observing from Fort Green, ob-
tained a number of photographs and some interesting photometric
observations. He also organized aseries of observations of the shadow
bands.

Observations of the partial phase were made at the Azores, Mar-
tinique, Port au Prince, and at several points along the eastern coast
of the United States. No parties were sent out by the United States
Government.

Photography of the solar corona.—Dr. Huggins’s method of photograph-
ing the corona in full sunshine seems to have failed when submitted to
a crucial test in the eclipse of last August. In a letter to Science,
dated September 11, 1886, Dr. Huggins says: “The partial phases of
this eclipse furnished conditions which would put the success of the
method beyond doubt if the plates showed the corona cut off partially
by the moon during its approach to and passage over the sun. As the
telegrams received from Grenada, and a telegram I have received this
day from Dr. Gill, at the Cape of Good Hope, state this partial cutting
off of the corona by the moon is not shown upon the plates, I wish to
be the first to make known this untoward result. I regret greatly that
a method which seemed to promise so much new knowledge of the
corona, which, under ordinary circumstances of observation, shows it-
self only during total eclipses, would seem to have failed. At the same
time I am not able to offer any sufficient explanation of the early favor-
able results.”

Mr. Common thinks it probable that this failure to get a picture of
the moon projected on the corena was due entirely to the state of the
sky ; and Professor Langley, in a recent letter to Nature (35: 53), adds
his testimony as to the great effect of atmospheric diffusion upon the
visibility of the corona. Moreover, Dr. Huggins says that he has not
himself been able to obtain any satisfactory results since 1883, and
that the plates taken by Mr. Ray Woods in 1884, in Switzerland, are
inconclusive. The failure may be due to the abnormally large amount
of air-glare from finely divided matter of some sort which has been
present in the higher regions of the atmosphere since the autumn of
1883. :

It is interesting to note that Professor Wright, of New Haven, in ex-
perimenting upon the visibility of the corona, succeeded in obtaining
what he believed to be a coronal image upon a screen, when he, too,
was brought to a standstill by these same “white skies” and “ red
sunsets.” Professor Wright’s method was to admit the sun’s rays re-
flected from a heliostat, into a darkened room, and to cut out all but
the blue and violet rays by a suitable absorbing cell, and then to form
an image of the sun and its surroundings upon a sensitive fluorescent
screen, stopping out the sun’s disk itself.

Professor Young seems to have some slight hope of ultimate success
of these efforts to reach the corona without an eclipse,
ASTRONOMY. 131

Langley’s observations of hitherto unrecognized wave-lengths.—Profes-
sor Langley having traced the solar spectrum in the infra-red as far as
wave-length =0.0027 of a millimeter, where it suddenly ceased, has
since, with more delicate instruments, examined the emission spectra
of various terrestrial substances at temperatures from that of fusing
platinum to that of melting ice, and more particularly of temperatures
corresponding to the ordinary conditions of the soil. The result has
been to show that the maximum of heat from cold and black bodies has
in every case a wave-length greater than 0.0027—greater, that is to say,
than that of the lowest solar heat which reaches us. Professor Lang-
ley thus sums up (Am. J. Se., 132: 84-106) his investigation: “ Broadly
speaking, we have learned through the present measures with certainty
of wave-lengths greater than 0.005 millimeter, and have grounds for es-
timating that we have recognized radiations whose wave-length ex-
ceeds 0.03 millimeter, so that while we have directly measured to nearly
eight times the wave-length known to Newton, we have probable indica-
tion of wave-lengths far greater, and the gulf between the shortest vi-
bration of sound and the longest known vibration of the «ther is now
in some measure bridged over.”

The visual solar spectrum in 1884.—Professor Piazzi Smyth made a
careful map of the solar spectrum in 1884 in order to determine whether
any perceptible effect had been produced by the “ white skies” so prev-
alent in that year. His observations have lately been published in a
series of sixty plates, in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edin-
burgh, vol. 32. He finds that the red and violet ends of the spectrum
show a marked general dulling, such as should arise from the upper
air being laden with minute opaque particles—whether from the Kra-
katoa explosion or any other source.

Lhollon’s map of the solar spectrum.—M. Thollon, in the Bulletin as-
tronomique for July, gives some interesting details in regard to the
great map of the spectrum for which the Lalande prize of the Paris
Academy was awarded him about a year ago. An earlier map from A
to H was finished by Thollon in 1879, but he determined to go over
the work again with improved instruments, and to make a chart
representing, with all the accuracy attainable, the positions, breadths,
and relative intensities of the lines, a chart which will enable us to
determine in the future whether any changes have taken place. For
even now, from the comparison of M. Thollon’s chart with that of Angs-
trém, there is a strong suspicion that some change has occurred in the
intensity of several lines between B and C.

M. Thollon has carried the map from A to b, and it is to be continued
to the violet by M. Trépied. It is now more than 33 feet long (though
it covers little more than one-third of the spectrum), and contains
about 3,200 lines, nearly 900 of which are distinguished as of telluric
origin. The instrument employed was a large spectroscope with bi-
132 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

sulphide of carbon prism, kept at an even temperature by running
water. The measures were made with a fine glass pointer.

Cornws device for distinguishing the telluric lines in the solar spec-
trum.—At the meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society, cn June 11,
1886, M. Cornu gave a description of an ingenious method he has de-
vised for distinguishing between those lines of the solar spectrum which
are atmospheric and those which are due to solar absorption. The east
and west equatorial limbs of the sun are alternately thrown on the slit
of the spectroscope by means of an oscillating mirror. As one limb of
the sun is approaching us and the other receding, there is a real differ-
ence of wave-length in the same radiation as obtained from the two
limbs, and consequently the solar lines appear to oscillate while the
atmospheric lines remain perfectly stationary. “It is as if you shook
the spectrum; and if a line were a solar one it moved, if a terrestrial
one it remained steady.”

The absorption spectrum of oxygen.—About three years ago M. Egoroff
was able to show that the great groups A and B in the solar spectrum
were due to the absorption of oxygen. More recently the a band was
also found to be due to the same gas. M. Janssen, studying the ab-
sorption of oxygen, has now discovered that, under certain conditions,
the gas yields another spectrum, composed no longer of lines easily
separated, but of shaded bands, which can only be resolved with great
difficulty. This system of bands appears for moderate pressures much
later than the spectrum of lines, but it shows itself very quickly with in-
crease of the density; the two systems are so different that it is possible
to obtain either the first without the second, or vice versa. M. Janssen
was at first unable to explain how it was that these bands were not
visible in the solar spectrum when they were easily obtained by passing
light through thicknesses of oxygen far less than the sun’s light has to
traverse before reaching us. But further experiments showed that
these bands did not develop in proportion to the thickness of the stratum
of oxygen producing them, multiplied by its density, but in proportion
to the thickness multiplied by the square of the density. The density
of our atmosphere being small as compared with some of the pressures
at which M. Janssen worked, the non-appearance of these bands amongst
the telluric lines of the solar spectrum is readily explained.

M. Janssen is continuing his experiments at Meudon, and is building
tubes which can be loaded with 1,000 atmospheres of hydrogen, oxy-
gen, or carbonic acid. In this last case the real density of the gas will
be superior to the density of water. (Nature.)

For a thorough and authoritative review of recent advances in our
knowledge of the sun the reader should consult Professor Young’s ar-
ticle which appeared in the Popular Science Monthly for November,
1886 (30: 24-33), and also his “Ten Years’ Progress in Astronomy,” in
vol. 5 of the Transactions of the New York Academy of Sciences.

THE PLANETS.

Mercury: The mass of Mercury.—Dr. Backlund has published in the
Bulletin astronomique for October a new mass of Mercury, obtained in-
cidentally in his eiecasion of the motion of Encke’s comet. The new
result in question is 5,¢4705, the sun’s mass being unity, and this is the
largest value of the mass of the planet yet obtained. Dr. Backlund
states that, even supposing the acceleration of the comet’s mean motion
to have been constant during the entire period, 1871-85, it is not pos-
sible to represent satisfactorily the five apparitions of the comet gure
that period on the assumption of a mass of Mercury less than z554505.

VENUS: Semi-diameter of Venus.—Mr. Thackeray, discussing the ob-
servations of Venus made at Greenwich from 1866 to 1884, finds that
the amount of personality in the measures is much greater than the cor-
rection due to the instrument, and that, though a greater number of
observers by compensating one another might give increased accu-
racy to the value of the semi-diameter, it is just as likely that they
should not.

THE EARTH: Geodetic Congress.—We learn from Nature that the In-
ternatioral Geodetic Conference met at Berlin in October, 1886, to settle
the organization of the central geodetic bureau (which is to have its per-
manent seat at Berlin), and to determine upon the best method of exe-
cuting the resolutions passed at Rome and Washington in 1883 and
1884, respecting the actual measurement of a degree on the earth’s sur-
face. The adoption of Greenwich as a first meridian is to be strictly en-
forced, but the introduction of international normal time is postponed
on account of insuperable practical difficulties.

The proposed change in the beginning of the astronomical deny —Itis to
be regretted that no agreement has yet been reached by astronomers
upon the proposition to change the beginning of the astronomical day
from noon to midnight.

The general sentiment is opposed to making any change until it is
clear that it will be adopted by a majority of astronomers, and until the
proper modifications have been introduced into our principal ephemeri-
des. The new day has been provisionally adopted by Mr. Christie, at
Greenwich, and the board of visitors have recommended that it be in-
troduced into the Nautical Almanac for 1891. On the other hand, the
superintendents of the German and American ephemerides oppose any
change; and there seems to be great danger that the agitation of the
question by the Washington Meridian Conference in 1884 may introduce
new confusion rather than remove the old. At present there is little
prospect of the plan meeting with anything like a general acceptance
before the beginning of the next century.

Theory of the moon’s motion.—Several valuable papers upon the lunar
theory have been published by Hill and others. Reference should be
made to the papers themselves, cited in our Bibliography.

134 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Mr. Hill has received the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical
Society for his laborious and masterly researches upon this difficult
subject.

An interesting historical note ou the inequalities of the motion of the
moon which depends on the figure of the earth, is given by Professor
Hall in the Annals of Mathematies, vol. 2, No. 5.

Mars: The ‘‘ canals” of Mars.—M. Perrotin and his colleagues at
Nice succeeded in recovering many of Schiaparelli’s enigmatical “‘ canals”
at the last opposition of Mars, although the planet was seen under very
unfavorable conditions. Its apparent diameter at this opposition was
only 14”, against 25’ at the opposition of 1877, when the canals were
discovered. The canals were made out by several observers at Nice,
and were recognized as having the same general outline and position
attributed to them by Schiaparelli in 1882. They seem, therefore, to be
essentially permanent, forming a sort of network of grayish lines pro-
jected against the brighter equatorial regions of the planet. Compared
with the thickness of the spider lines of the micrometer, the finest of
these lines appear to have a width which corresponds to an are of 2°
or 3° on the surface of Mars. Some of them measure from 50° to 60°
in length, and several are double, composed of lines strictly parallel,
separated, according to Schiaparelli’s estimate, by intervals of from 6°
to 12°. All of this speaks well for the purity of the atmosphere at
Nice, the excellence of the 15-inch Henry refractor, and the keenness
of the observers.

During the study of the planet (from the end of March to the middle
of June) some change seemed to be taking place near Kaiser Sea. On
May 21 this region, from 10° to 55° north latitude, was hidden by a
luminous veil somewhat softer in color than the continents, very much
as if clouds in regular parallel bands were stretched across the planet
from northeast to southwest. At moments these clouds became trans-
pareiit, exposing the outline of the prolongation of Kaiser Sea. Other
similar cloud phenomena were observed on subsequent days. M. Per-
rotin suggests that these phenomena were really produced by clouds
or mists circulating in the atmosphere of Mars, and concludes that they
are, in such case, the act of an element belonging to the atmosphere,
or to the surface of the planet, susceptible of motion and modification
in a comparatively short time.

Mr. Denning, who has been an attentive observer of Mars, has not
been able to make out the canals in the detail assigned to them by
Schiaparelli, although he has distinguished a large number of appear-
ances highly suggestive of these configurations. Mr. Denning con-
cludes a review of his recent observations of the planet (Nature, 34:
105) as follows :

‘“‘Many of our leading treatises on astronomy attribute a dense atmos-
phere to Mars, but nothing has been observed during my recent obser-
vations to corroborate this theory. It seems to me far more plausible
ASTRONOMY, 135

to assume that the atmosphere of this planet is extremely attenuated.
The chief spots are invariably visible, and the phenomena, occasionally
observed are rather to be imputed to the vagaries of our own atmos-
phere than to that of Mars.

“ Jupiter aud Saturn are doubtless enveloped in dense vapors shroud-
ing their real surfaces from terrestrial eyes. Their markings are atmos-
pheric, though in some cases very durable, and constantly undergoing
changes of aspect and displacements of position by longitudinal cur-
rents. On Mars a totally different nature of things prevails.. Here
the appearances described are absolute surface markings displaying
none of the variations which are so conspicuously displayed on J upiter.
It seems to me that the very pronounced character of the
markings and their great permanency are quite opposed to the idea that
the planet is surrounded by a dense cloud-laden atmosphere.”

Dr. Lohse has used, in observing Mars, a double-refracting prism,
achromatized for the extraordinary ray; this prism, placed before the
ocular of the telescope, brings out more sharply the details of the
planet’s surface by reducing the polarized light reflected from its at-
mosphere.

Satellites of Mars.—Professor Hall was able to observe the outer
satellite, Deimos, on four evenings in March, 1886, but the inner satel-
lite was seen only once, and was then so faint that no measurements
could be made. Both little bodies were near their predicted places.

THE MINOR PLANETS.—Eleven minor planets were added to the list
in 1886, the last one bearing the number 264; the brightest was of the
eleventh magnitude. Seven of the new-comers belong to Dr. Palisa,
making the total number discovered by him fifty-seven. Dr. Peters has
now discovered forty-six and Dr. Luther twenty-three.

The dates of discovery and the names, as far as assigned, are given
in the following table:

Number 253, discovered by Dr. Palisa on November 15, 1885, has been
named Mathilde.

The influence of phase on the brightness of the minor planets.—Dr. G.
Miiller, of the Potsdam Observatory, is led to believe from observations
of seven asteroids with a Zéllner photometer, that there is a real con-
nection between the phase of these bodies and their apparent bright-
ness, and that Lambert’s law of phase brightness does not apply to
them. The planets are separated into two classes. In the first class,
class, which embraces Vesta, Iris, Massilia, and Amphitrite, the changes
in brightness are only perceptible as the planet approaches opposition,
thus resembling Mars in their behavior ; in the second, which contains
Ceres, Pallas, and Irene, the changes in brightness seem to be coexten-
sive with the changes of phase, giving a light curve, like that of the
the moon or Mercury.

The asteroid ring.—M. A. Svedstrup gives in the Nachrichten, Nos.
2740-41, an interesting abstract of a recent investigation, for which he
received the gold medal of the Royal Danish Academy—a statistical —
examination of the orbits of 198 of the small planets, considered as
part of a cosmical ring around the sun. The orbit obtained for the
‘‘mean planet” shows an inclination of about 6° and a mean distance
of 2.64. The mass of this fictitious planet corres to an apparent
magnitude, at opposition, of 6.7.*

Relation of the asteroid orbits to that of Tipe. —Professor Newton
points out the interesting fact that the plane of Jupiter’s orbit coincides
almost exactly with the mean plane of the orbits found for the first 251
asteroids, understanding by the mean plane, the plane whose pole is the
center of gravity of the poles of the asteroid planes ; the difference be-
tween the poles is, indeed, only 30’.

JUPITER: The “red spot..—The “ great red spot,” some 30,000 miles
in length by 8,300 in width, has now been the principal object of inter-
est on the planet for eight years. It was faint during the last season,
but far more conspicuous than in 1885. Professor Young obtained,
from eight observations made between March 17 and June 29, 1886, a
rotation-time of the spot of 9 55™ 408.74 0%2, showing that the
remarkable retardation of the period still persists. This is brought
out by the following figures:

In 1879 Mr. Pratt made the period.... 98 55™ 348.9

1880-81 Mr. Hough made the period ..- - 37 .2
1882~83 Mr. Hough made the period.. - 38.4

Professor Young, on re-reducing Mr. Pratt’s observations of 1879, ob-
tains 9" 55™ 348,05, and he finds from a series of observations fae by
Prof. C. W. Pritchett, in 1882, 95 55™ 388.15. A small round white spot

observed at Princeton in March and April, 1885, gave a period of 9
557 118.14. “Itis noteworthy that although this spot was in a higher
latitudé (about 50°south) than the red spot, it yet rotates more rapidly.”
Professor Young remarked the apparent overlapping of the southern
belt and the red spot which took place towards the end of March and
the beginning of April, and which was seen by many Engiish observers
(Observatory, May, 1886, vol. 9: p. 188); but whilst admitting that it
was impossible to say which was uppermost, he was inelined, in oppo-
sition to Mr. Denning’s view, to believe the red spot to be the lower.
Mr. Denning has pointed out that the apparent partial coalescence of
the two markings was simply due to an arm of the southern belt over-
taking the red spot, the former having a rotation period shorter by
about 19* than the latter.

Mr. Denning finds evidence of regular recurrence in many of the
prominent markings on this planet.

SATURN: The satellites of Saturn.—Professor Hall has finished a very
important discussion of the six inner satellites of Saturn, and his work
has been published as Appendix I to the Washington Observations for
1883. The observations of Professor Newcomb in 1874, and Professor
Hall’s own observations from 1875 to 1884, are given in detail; these are
followed by the formation of equations of condition and their solution,
and the work concludes with useful tables of the satellites’ motions.

A remarkable result of the discussion is that the Washington obser-
vations of the five inner satellites can be satisfied within the limits of
their probable errors by circular orbits. It was hoped that the observa-
tions would determine the positions of the lines of apsides with such
accuracy that the motions of these lines would be known, and that thus
we might obtain data for a new determination of the mass of the ring
and of the figure of the plant. But the resulting circular orbits for the
inner satellites make the position of a line of apsides indeterminate, and
for the present the mass of the ring remains unknown.

The mass of Saturn has been computed from the elements found for
Titan, Rhea, Dione, and Tethys with the separate results for the re-
ciprocal of the mass, —

In a paper in the Astronomische Nachrichten (No. 2743) entitled
“ Comparison of the five inner satellites of Saturn made at Toulouse in
138 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 18386.

1876 and 1877,” Professor Hall discusses the old method of observing
these difficult objects by noting their conjunctions with the ends of the
ring, or with some other marked feature of the Saturnian system, but
concludes that the filar micrometer measures are at present among the
best we have. He is inclined to think that the heliometer, if it can be
made large enough, must be one of the best instruments for dealing
with measurements of such objects as Saturn and Jupiter. This sug-
gestion is being carried out by Mr. Asaph Hall, jr., in a series of obser-
vations of Titan with the 6-inch heliometer of the Yale College Obser-
vatory.

The following table represents the results of Professor Hall’s inves-
tigations upon these satellites. The elements of Titan, however, and
the values of the node and inclination of the ring aie adopted from
Bessel. Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, and Rhea are assumed to
move in the plane of the ring, and Hyperion in the plane of Titan.

The motion of Hyperion.—Tisserand in investigating the case of two
satellites moving around their primary in orbits but little inclined to
each other has shown that ifthe mean motions are very nearly com-
mensurable, and if the motion of one was originally circular and uni-
form, the perturbations caused by the other would have for their princi-
pal effect to transform this motion into motion ina Keplerian ellipse
with a uniform rotation of the major axis. Applying this to the case of
Hyperion perturbed by Titan, which has been investigated by Hall and
Newcomb, and in which there is one of the nearest approaches to com-
mensurability of mean motions to be found in the solar system, M.
ASTRONOMY. 139

Tisserand finds that his results agree closely with the facts of observa-
tion, the computed rate of retrograde motion of the perisaturnium of
Hyperion being 18°.8 per annum, whilst the observed quantity is 20°,
and he also finds that his value of the mass of Titan (,,4,,) differs little

from that obtained by Newcomb. (Observatory, November, 1886,
9: 360.)

URANUS.—Observations of the planet made by Dr. H. ©. Wilson at
the Cincinnati Observatory in 1883 (recently published in Astron.
Nachr., 2730), seem to confirm Professor Young’s observations (As-
tron. Nachr., 2545), that the equator of the planet does not coincide
with the plane of the satellites’ orbits.

NEPTUNE: Satellite of Neptune.— Marth calls attention (Month. Not.,
46: 507) to what appears to be a remarkable change in the position of
the plane of the orbit of Neptune’s satellite. He noticed that the orbit
from the Malta observations of 1863~64 did not agree with that from
the observations of 1852. The node and inclination obtained by New-
comb in 1874 showed a movement in the same direction, and the motion
of these elements is still further confirmed by the orbit recently pub-
lished by Professor Hall from his own observations at Washington.
The probable errors are so small that it seems hardly plausible or pos-
sible to attribute the change to systematic errors of observations. Mr.
Marth calls for careful observations to strengthen the evidence.

REPORTS OF OBSERVATORIES.

The following account of the recent activity of astronomical observa-
tories is compiled from all available sources, the “ Vierteljahrsschrift”
furnishing, as usual, the data for most of the observatories, although the
latest reports there published are for the year 1885. I am indebted to
the directors of many observatories for the direct communication of
information in regard to the institutions under their control.

An alphabetical list of astronomical observatories, compiled by Mr.
Boehmer, will be found in the Smithsonian Report for 1885.

M. Lancaster, of the Bruxelles Observatory, has published a useful
directory of observatories and astronomers.

Algiers Observatory (1886).—The French Government has granted the
funds necessary for. the completion of the observatory, and two assist-
ants have been sent to join M. Trépied. A time service has been organ-
ized for the cities of Algiers and Tunis, and the observatory will co-
operate in geodetic work with field parties. Stellar photography will
receive special attention. The observatory possesses a spectroscope by
Thollon giving a spectrum 10 meters in length.

Allegheny Observatory (1886).—The work during 1886 has consisted of
an extension of former researches on invisible radiations, and on the
absorption and radiation of .heat by the earth’s atmosphere, and also of
researches upon the absolute temperature of the lunar surface. In con-
140 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

nection with this latter investigation a new field of exploration has
been opened in spectral regions, where the planet’s own radiations to-
wards space, of very great wave-lengths—exceeding one one-hundredth
of a millimeter—are now for the first time found.

Professor Langley, in giving a portion of his time to the Smithsonian
Institution, has not resigned the active directorship of the observatory,
and all communications relative to the scientific or business affairs of that
institution should be addressed to him at Allegheny as usual. Mr. F.
W. Very continues at the observatory as senior assistant. Mr. Keeler
is now at the Lick Observatory, and has been succeeded at Allegheny
by Mr. James Page, jr.

Amherst (1885).—This observatory, named in honor of the Hon. Abbot
Lawrence, was built in 1847, and has been employed chiefly for purposes
of instruction. Professor Todd was appointed director in July, 1881,
and his report covers the years 1881-1885, inclusive. The instruments
of the observatory are: A 74inch Clark equatorial, a 3-inch Gambey
transit cirele, and a 63-inch Pistor & Martins transit instrument, with
mean-time and sidereal clocks, chronograph, and subsidiary appara‘us.
The equatorial is provided with two small cameras for celestial photog-
raphy. Observations are made of sun-spots, of the phenomena of Jupi-
ter’s satellites, occultations of stars by the moon, etc. The provision-
ally adopted position of the observatory is: Latitude, +42° 22/ 17/.1;
longitude, 4° 50™ 48.67 west of Greenwich.

Amn Arbor (1886).—The observatory is known as the Detroit Observa-
tory, having been founded through the liberality of citizens of Detroit.
Valuable additions and improvements have been made by means of
further contributions from the same source and from the city of Ann
Arbor, and also by appropriations made by the board of regents of the
University of Michigan, to which the observatory is attached. The
building consists of a main part, with a movable dome, and two wings.
The east wing contains the large meridian circle by Pistor & Martins
and a sidereal clock by Tiede, of Berlin. The west wing contains the
library of the observatory, a chronograph with Bond’s new isodynamic
escapement, and the smaller instruments. This wing connects with the
residence of the director. In the dome is mounted a large refracting
telescope, with an object-glass 13 inches in diameter, constructed by
the late Henry Fitz, of New York.

Much attention is given to instruction in astronomy, and through the
liberality of the legislature a small observatory for the purpose of in-
struction has been erected on the observatory grounds near the main
building. It contains an equatorial telescope of 6 inches aperture and
a transit instrument of 3 inches aperture, with zenith telescope attach-
ment. A building near by contains computing rooms and rooms for
observers, and a workshop where necessary repairs and attachments
for the instruments can be made. A set of self-registering meteorologi-
ASTRONOMY. 141

cal instruments has recently been added. It consists of Hough’s baro-
graph and thermograph and an anemograph.

The observatory is under the direction of Prof. M. W. Harrington,
who is assisted by Mr. J. M. Schaeberle and a meteorological observer.
Professor Harrington has devoted considerable time during the past
few years to photometric observations, especially of the asteroids. Mr.
Schaeberle has made observations with the meridian circle.

The observatory plant is valued at about $40,000, and the annual ex-
penditures amount to about $3,000. It should be mentioned that the
American Meteorological Journal is edited here by Professor Harring-
ton.

Armagh (1886).—-Under the direction of Dr. Dreyer the Armagh e¢at-
alogue of 3,300 stars has been published.

Bamberg (1886).—This observatory, founded by the will of the late
Dr. Kemeis, of Bamberg, who died in 1882, will be provided with a 7-
inch heliometer, the largest instrument of its kind made. Dr. Hartwig
proposes to take up the systematic investigation of Stellar parallax, and
the investigation of the physical libration of the moon.

Berlin (1885).—With the meridian circle, Dr. Kiistner has observed a
series of comparison stars for planets and comets, stars which have been
occulted by the moon, stars for heliometer investigations, ete. There
have been made in all 2,096 observations of right ascension and 1,936 of
declination; the reductions are up to date. A new observing list, con-
taining the Pulkowa “ Zusatzsterne” and Argelander’s proper motion
stars—about 1,000 objects in all—was started in 1886. The transit has
been used for observations of cireumpolars, and also for continuing the
observations upon seven selected pairs of stars, which are to furnish
data for determining the constant of aberration. With the 9-inch re-
fractor Dr. Knorre has observed a large number of comets and planets,
and with the aid of his ‘‘declinograph” he has determined the positions
of about a thousand stars, some as faint as the thirteenth magnitude.
Dr. Battermann observed occultations with the 4.6-inch refractor. The
investigations upon the movements of piers have given interesting re-
sults, and the clock which has been for four years in a hermetically
sealed case, continues to perform most satisfactorily.

Bonn (1885).—The meridian circle was devoted, mainly, to continu-
ing the Gesellschaft zone observations. Volume vit, the Southern
Durchmusterung, was published during 1886, and the printing of the
twenty-four charts which are to accompany this work has been begun.
The reduction of the zone work is not quite finished. The director, |
Dr. Schénfeld, has been assisted in observing by Drs. Scheiner, Deich-
miiller, and W. Luther. Dr. Scheiner was absent a considerable por-
tion of the year, serving a term of military duty.

Breslau (1885).—The observatory, under the charge of the veteran
Dr. Galle, is engaged in meteorological and magnetic work. Assistant,
Dr. Lachmann.
142 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Buchtel College Observatory (1886).—Professor Howe has devoted his
time to instruction in practical astronomy. The cost of the observa-
tory was about $5,000.

Bucknell University Observatory.—Mr. William Bucknell has given
the sum of $10,000 for an observatory at Lewisburgh, Pa. A 10-inch
equatorial has been ordered from Clark and a 3-inch transit from
Ertel. The building is of brick, 25 feet by 150 feet, a dome 164 feet in
diameter surmounting the central tower.

The observatory, under the direction of Prof. W. ©. Bartol, is to be
used for instruction in practical astronomy, and will be ready in. June,
1887. ;

Chabot Observatory (1886).—This new observatory, the gift of An-
thony Chabot, esq., to the city of Oakland, Cal., is under the direction
of Mr. F. M. Campbell. The instruments are, an 8-inch equatorial,
with micrometer and spectroscope, a 44-inch transit, chronograph,
clocks, ete. The geographical position given (Sid. Mess., 5:286) is:
Latitude, +37° 48’ 5”; longitude, 3" 0™ 548.3 west of Washington.

Cineimnati (1886).—The Cinema Observatory was founded in 1842
by an astronomical society, and was afterward transferred to the Uni-
versity of Cincinnati, of which it now forms one of the departments. A
new building was erected in 1870 upon Mount Lookout, about 4 miles
east and 2 miles north of the central portion of the city. The observa-
tory grounds comprise 4 acres on the summit of the hill. The building
is of brick; it consists of a central portion supporting the dome, and two
wings, the western being furnished with meridian shutters, and the east-
ern containing the library.

The observatory possesses the Mitchel refractor of 11 inches aper-
ture, made by Merz & Mahier, and supplied with a filar micrometer and
a double-ring micrometer. The magnifying powers range from 90 to
1,500. There is also a portable equatorial of 4 inches aperture by Clark,
with magnifying powers ranging from 15 to 250. The transit instru-
ment, by Buff & Berger, has an aperture of 3 inches and is furnished
with a latitude level and an eye-piece micrometer for measuring differ-
ences of declination. The total value of the instruments is estimated to
be about $12,000. The library contains over fifteen hundred bound vol-
umes pesides a large number of pamphlets.

The financial support is derived from a city tax, ee yearly income
from which is about $5,000. This provides for the eae of the diree-
tor, one assistant, and a janitor, the payment of the ordinary expenses,

-and the publication of results. The purpose of the observatory is both

educational and scientific. Instruction in astronomy is given in con-
nection with the university, and the observatory is also open to the
public for the first hour of each evening.

The principal work of the past year (1886) has been the prosecution
of the zone observations with the 3-inch transit instrument. In these
zones about 4,000 stars between the declinations —19° and —22° have
ASTRONOMY. 143

been observed, most of them three times or more. The work of pre-
paring this catalogue for publication is already commenced, and in the
progress of the work Professor Porter has detected a number o£ inter-
esting cases of proper motion. The catalogue will probably be issued
during the coming year. A few observations of nebule, double stars,
and comets were also made during the early part of the year, but were
suspended owirg to the resignation of Mr. H. ©. Wilson, assistant
astronomer.

The work proposed for 1857 is the completion of the observations
required for the zone catalogue, and after-that the continuation of
a series of charts of southern nebule.

Cointe (1886).—The new observatory attached to the University of
Liége, Belgium, is under the direction of M. Folie, the director of the
Brussels Observatory. The instruments are a 10-inch equatorial and 6-
inch meridian circle (diameter of circle about 31.5 inches), both by
Cooke, with numereus smaller astronomical and geodetic instruments,
and a set of magnetical and meteorological instruments. M. Folie is
assisted by Dr. L. de Ball and M. P. Ubaghs.

Columbia College Observatory (1886).—The observatory is upon the
top of the college library building, 100 feet above the level of Forty-
ninth street, New York City. The13-inch Rutherford equatorial, 3-inch
transit, and zenith telescope are mounted in a room about 24 by 30 feet.
The instruments rest upon solid piers of masonry, which are supported
by heavy iron girders, the floors and ceilings nowhere touching the
girders. The instrumental equipment embraces also a 5-inch equatorial
(not mounted at present), a Troughton & Simms transit, spectroscope
and subsidiary apparatus, clock, chronometers, portable transit, per-
sonal-equation machine, etc. The dome is by Waters & Son, of Troy,
New York, and consists of a paper covering with wooden ribs. The
shutters of the transit slits are also paper, and open by the action of
springs.

Some trouble is caused by vibrations from the railroad trains (over
one hundred a day) constantly passing within 100 feet of the building,
but at times the instruments are very steady.

A careful redetermination of the geographical position of the observ-
atory will be made, as the old Jongitude seems to be somewhat in error.
It is also hoped to devote the Rutherford equatorial, which is supplied
with a photographie corrector, to astronomical photography.

Professor Rees, the director, has but one assistant, and the greater
part of his time is required to carry on a very complete course of in-
struction ip practical astronomy, designed especially for training engi-
neering students.

Dearborn Observatory (1886).—The Dearborn Observatory is the prop-
erty of the Chicago Astronomical Society, but is upon ground leased to
it by the now extinct University of Chicago, and may at any time be
required to vacate. A new site has not yet been selected, Observa-
144 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

tions of Jupiter and of double stars have been made with the equato-
rial during 1886, and the necessary observations for furnishing time to
the city of Chicago have been made with the meridian circle. A cata-
logue of two hundred and nine new double stars has been sent to the
Nachrichten. It is expected that observations of double stars, Jupiter,
and the satellites of Uranus will be kept up during the coming year.
The instruments of the observatory are valued at $30,000. There is
no permanent endowment, and Professor Hough carries on his work
without assistants.

Deutz (1885).—Herr Emil Mengering established in 1884 a private
observatory, the principal instrument being a 5-inch refractor by Rein-
felder & Hertel. Physical observations of the moon and Jupiter have
been made, and attention is being directed to astronomical photography
and spectroscopy. Approximate geographical position: Latitude, +50°
56/ 33’; longitude, +05 25™ 45*.0 west of Berlin.

Die nicn (1885).—At Baron von Engelhardt’s observatory observa-
tions were made of comets, nebulz, double stars, the phenomena of Ju-
piter’s satellites, occultations by the moon, ete.

Dresden (1885)—Dr. Drechsler, of the “ Mathematischer Salon,” con-
tinues a series of meteorological observations begun in 1828.

Diisseldorf (1885).—Since 1847, 1,271 observations of 157 asteroids
have been made.

Frankfort-on-the-Main (1885).—Herr Epstein continues his star-gauges
and his observations of sun-spots.

Geneva (1885).—Four hundred and ninety-eight chronometers were
tested during 1885, some of them showing an uncommon degree of ex-
cellence. Forty-two chronometers were entered on December 1, 1885,
for a twelve- weeks’ special trial of temperature compensation. M.Kam-
mermann has employed the 10-inch equatorial in observations of com-
ets, nebulz, and satellites. Meteorological observations are continued
as in former years.

Gotha (1885).—Dr. Becker has given up the greater part of his time
to.the reduction of his zone observations. The equatorial which has
received anew 44-inch objective by Reinfelder & Hertel, and has been
thoroughly repaired, was remounted in October. <A series of observa-
tions was made with the meridian instrument.

Greenwich (1886).—The annual report of the astronomer royal, Mr.
Christie, was submitted to the board of visitors of the Greenwich Ob-
servatory on June 5, and gives an account of the progress and activ-
ity of the observatory for the year ending May 20, 1886. The regular
work of the transit circle and the altazimuth has been continued, and
very satisfactory results have been obtained with the apparatus for de-
termining absolute personal equations brought into use with the former
instrument some months ago. Spectroscopic observations include a
considerable number made of the new star which burst out in the great
nebula of Andromeda. The spectroscopic observations of Sirius indi-

cate, as in the last three years, a displacement of the F line towards
the blue; this displacement would correspond to a motion of the ear th
towards Se at arate of something more than 20 miles per second,

though, from the nature of the observations, the amount of such a mo-

tion can not be considered as very accurately determined. For the year
1885 a photographic record of the sun’s surface can be made out for
three hundred and sixty days by filling up the gaps in the series of
Greenwich photographs from photographs obtained in India and the
Mauritius. Observations of comets and of casual phenomena have been
made with the equatorials; and the magnetie and meteorological ob-

servations, the time-service, ete., have been kept up as in previous years.

The full import of the feeemeut that the reductions of the observations
are keeping pace with their registration will be appreciated by all who
are engaged in routine astronomical work.

In regard to the new equatorial Mr. Christie says: “The construe-
tion of an object-glass of 28 inches aperture and 28 feet focal length,
with suitable tube, to be mounted on the southeast equatorial, has been
authorized oy the Goyernment, and the necessary funds have been pro-

vided in the estimates. The work has been intrusted to Mr. Grubb,
with whom I have arranged the details of the tube, which is to be of
special construction, adapted to the conditions of the mounting, and
available for spectroscopy and photography as well as for eye observa-
tions. Mr. Grubb proposes to provide means for readily separating the
lenses of the object-glass to such a distance as will give the proper cor-
rection for photographic rays.”

It is proposed to refit the 123-inch refractor for astronomical pho-
tography by placing a combination of a convex flint and a concave
crown lens about 2 feet within the focus, in order te correct the chro-
matic aberration of the ebjective for the photographic rays without
alteration of the focal length.

Grignon (1885).—Observations of sun-spots and of the physical ap-
pearance of planets, ete.

Hamburg (1885).—Only one hundred and nineteen nights in the year
were favorable for observing. Besides the meridian observations and
the observations of planets and comets, a large number of chronom-
eters have been tested. Dr. Schrader has left the observatory to take
part in a scientific exploring expedition, and his place is filled tempo-
rarily by Dr. Wilhelm Luther. The time-balls at Cuxhaven and Bremer-
haven have worked satisfactorily, the former having failed only four
times and the latter five. The Hamburg ball has given more trouble,
having failed, from various causes, twenty-one times during the year.

Harvard College Observatory (1886).—The forty-first annual report of
the director covers the year ending November 1, 1886. About half the
Paine bequest, or $164,198, has become available for the support of the
observatory ; and the funds, which in 1875 amounted to $164,067 and
in 1885 to $226,958, have now risen to $398,046. This increase must for

the present be devoted to the publication of observations already made,
and to effecting repairs in the buildings and instruments. A new
mounting for the 15-inch equatorial is required, and Professor Pickering
expresses the hope that at no distant day means may be found for re-
placing the present building by one better adapted to the requirements
of modern astronomy.

The most important extension of the work of the observatory which
has recently been made is in the field of stellar photography. With the
aid from the Bache fund almost the entire visible sky has been photo-
graphed, and a large number of photographs of stellar spectra have
been obtained. For continuing the researches upon a stellar spectra
Mrs. Draper has lent the 11-inch photographic lens employed by her
husband, the late Dr. Henry Draper, and has provided means for a new
mounting at Cambridge, and for the proper reduction and publication
of the results. This investigation has been referred to under “Astro-
nomical photography.”

The 15-inch equatorial has been used for photometric observations,
observations of new comets, and of the new stars in Andromeda and
Orion, and for experiments in photography.

The work projected for the meridian circle is now completed, and
the reductions are being pushed as rapidly as possible. Volume
XV, part I, containing the annual results for the fundamental stars,
1870-79, and the individual results, 1883-86, has been published ; it
includes also the results from the separate observations of stars belong-
ing to various special classes, and the catalogue of 1,213 stars, sepa-
rately issued in 1585. The second part of this volume will contain the
catalogue of zone stars. Volume Xvi (published) contains a tabular
statement of the instrumental constants and a journal of the observa-
tions. A volume corresponding to volume xVI, but relating to the zone
stars instead of the fundamental stars, and another, containing the obser-
vations for absolute right ascension and declination made from 1879 to
1883, will complete the work of the meridfan circle still requiring publi-
cation. The resignation of Prof. William A. Rogers, who has had charge
of this instrument since it was mounted in 1870, is greatly to be re-
gretted. Professor Rogers has accepted the position of professor of
astronomy at Colby University, Waterville, Maine, but will, however,
superintend the reduction of his meridian observations and their publi-
cation.

The meridian photometer, Professor Pickering states, has given en-
tire satisfaction, both in accuracy and in rapidity of work. (See Pho-
tometry.) A time-ball is dropped at the Boston post-office, and the
telegraphic announcement of important discoveries has been continued
under the management of Mr. Ritchie. The report concludes with a
list, embracing twenty-two titles, of contributions to astronomical litera-
ture made by officers of the institution during the year.

The available annual income, including gifts for immediate use, is
$22,000. The salary of the director is $3,400, the use of the house being
estimated at $600 more. The sale of time signals brought in nearly
$3,000 during the year. The principal items of expenditure are—

The personnel includes Professor Pickering, the director; assistant,
Prof. W. A. Rogers (resigned September 1, 1886); assistant, Prof. A.
Searle; and Messrs. Wendell, Edmands, Ritchie, Gerrish; Gifford, and
Metcalf; with six computers, ladies.

The Boyden fund, which was left for the purpose of astronomical
research ‘“ at such anelevation as to be free, so far as practicable, from
the impediments to accurate observations which oceur in the observa-
tories now existing, owing to atmospheric influences,” has been trans-
ferred to Harvard College and will be administered at the observatory.
The fund at present exceeds $230,000. Professor Pickering proposes to
establish an experimental observing station in Colorado, but desires to
occupy ultimately some high mountain peak in the southern hemisphere
where observations—largely photographic, probably—ean be carried on
in co-operation with Cambridge. Information in regard to eligible sites
south of the equator is much desired.

Heidelberg (1886).—Private observatory of Dr. Wolf. The principal
instrument is a 6-inch equatorial; objective by Reinfelder & Hertel,
mounting by Sendtner, of Munich. <A photograph of the observatory
is given in Sirius, vol. 19, Heft 12.

Helsingfors (1885).—Dr. Donner has continued to observe the moon,
moon-culminating stars, and planets, with the large transit instrument.
This instrument is to be remodeled by Repsold into a meridian circle.
A portable transit of 6.9°™ (2.7 inches) aperture by Repsold has been
mounted in the prime vertical. The equatorial has been used for ob-
serving comets.

Herény (1885).—The mirror of the 104-inch reflector having been re-
Silvered by Professor Safarik, the instrument has been arranged for
experiments in celestial photography. Herr von Gothard has succeeded
in photographing several constellations, star-clusters, nebule, and stel-
lar spectra, but the work is still regarded as experimental. Spectro-
148 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

_ scopic observations and drawings of the planets have been continued
as heretofore.

Hillsborough, Ohio.—Private observatory of Henry A. Pavey. Ap-
proximate position: Latitude, +39° 12’; longitude, 5" 34" west of
Greenwich. The instruments are a 4-inch equatorial by Benjamin
Pike’s Sons, with mean-time clock and chrouometer, and other accesso-
ries. Physical observations of the sun and Jupiter have been made,
and observations of the zodiacal light. Variable stars have been ob-
served in accordance with the plan proposed by Professor Pickering.

Kalocsa Observatory (1886).—Dr. C. Braun has published a report of
the observatory founded by Cardinal Haynald, archbishop of Kaloesa.
The instruments are a refractor, by Merz, of 7 inches; another of 4
inches; a transit, by Cooke, of 2.3 inches; altazimuth, clocks, spectro-
scopes, photometers, etc. The latitude from geodetic observations is
+46° 31/ 41.92; astronomical methods give it 0.07 greater. The lon-
gitude is 1" 15™ 545.343 east of Greenwich. A valuable series of sun-
spot observations has been made and discussed.

Karlsruhe (1886).—The observatory at Karlsruhe (Baden) is still in
a small, temporary, wooden building, the instruments having been re-
moved in 1881 from Mannheim to the present quarters in Karlsruhe,
where the observatory forms a part of the “‘Techniche Hochschule.”
Unfortunately the financial condition of the Grand Duchy of Baden bas
thus far precluded the establishment of a thoroughly equipped observa-
tory, which has been in contemplation. The temporary building has
two small meridian rooms, and a dome. The instruments are: (1) a
6 inch refractor by Steinheil, lately remounted by Fecker & Co., of
Wetzlar; (2) an old repeating circle by Reichenbach some years ago
changed into a meridian circle by Hildebrandt & Schramm, of Freiberg ;
the telescope. has an aperture of 84 millimeters (3.3 inches); the divided
cirele is 3 feet in diameter; (3) a large portable transit instrument by
Bamberg, of Berlin; (4) two fine clocks by Hohwii, of Amsterdam—
one with break-circuit attachment; (5) chronographs, chronometers,
ete,

The personnel consists, at present, of the director, one regular assist-
ant, and a temporary assistant. The director, Dr. W. Valentiner, has
begun with the meridian circle a series of observation of all stars down
to the eighth maguitude between 0° and 20° of south declination, each
star will be observed six times. So far about nine thousand observa-
tions have been made, and most of these have been reduced and pub-
lished in parts 1 and 2 of the “ Veroffentlichungen ” of the observatory.
The assistant, Dr. von Rebeur-Paschwitz, uses the refractor for observa-
tions of comets, occultations, ete.; his principal work is the micromet-
rical measurement of star-clusters; two groups will Soon be finished.
The filar micrometer has been carefully investigated. Herr von Kebeur
has also completed an exhaustive discussion of comet 1582 I (Wells).
The second assistant, Herr L, Stutz, makes regular observations with
ASTRONOMY. 149

the transit instrument for the time-service of the observatory, and
also observes moon-culminations and right ascensions of the fundamen-
tal stars for the southern zones of the “ Astronomische Gesellschaft.”

Kew (1886).—The magnetical and meteorological observations and
observations for time are kept up. Sketches of sun-spots projected on
the photo-heliograph screen are made in order to continue Schwabe’s
enumeration.

Kiel (1885).—Observations with the meridian circle and equatorial
‘are continued, the equatorial having been provided with a new regis-
tering apparatus. The catalogue founded on the Helsingfors Gotha
zones is still unfinished.

Lawrence Observatory.—(See Amherst.)

Kis-Kartel (1886).—Private observatory of Baron Podmanicezky, near
Budapest, Hungary. The principal instrument is a 7-inch refractor
by Merz, with a mounting by Cooke. The work commences next year
with double-star measures and physical observations of the sun, moon,
and planets.

La Plata Observatory (1886).—The Government of the province of
Buenos Aires is fitting up in La Plata an observatory which is to have
a 31.5-inch reflector, an equatorial coudé of 17 inches, an 8-inch transit,
a large Thollon spectroscope with objective of 9.8 inches, apparatus for
celestial photography, and numerous smaller instruments. A time-
Service will be instituted, and a large amount of geodetic work will be
done, including the measurement of an are of a meridian. The ob-
Servatory is to be under the direction of M. Beuf, late an officer in the
French navy. i

Leipzig (1885).—Dr. Harzer has gone to Pulkowa, and has been suc-
ceeded at Leipzig by Herr Schnauder. The zone observations and
necessary reductions are being advanced as rapidly as possible. The -
equatorial has been used on comets and star-clusters.

Leyden Observatory (1885).—Prof. H. G. van de Sande Bakhuyzen’s
report is for the year ending September 15, 1885. The new 104-inch
equatorial, with objective by Clark, and mounting by Repsold, is ready
for use. The 7-inch refractor was used for observations of comets. A
series of measurements of artificial disks was made with Airy’s double-
image micrometer for the purpose. of determining the systematic errors
of the measures of the diameters of Mars and Uranus obtained in for-
mer years. The meridian circle was devoted to observations of fairly
bright cireumpolar stars. Some progress has been made with the re-
ductions of the zone observations, 1874~76.

Lick Observatory (1886).—The Lick Observatory will soon ke counted
as one of the active observatories of America. The formal opening
and transfer to the University of California can not take place until the
great telescope is mounted (probably in the summer of 1887), but Pro-
fessor Holden already has one assistant at work—Mr. Keeler, who has
been Professor Langley’s assistant at Allegheny for a number of years.
150 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR .i886.

The crown and flint lenses for the 36-inch objective arrived safely at
Mount Hamilton on December 27, 1856, and have been packed away
in a fire-proof vault in readiness for the mounting.

It is the intention to provide three lenses, the third a ‘‘ photographic
corrector” which can be slipped on in front of the other two. The
Clarks found that the first piece of glass sent them for this lens showed
signs of internal strain due to insufficient annealng, and the work of
figuring was only undertaken at the risk of the makers, Feil & Co.
The suspicion of strain proved well founded, for the disk burst into
three pieces while upon the grinding tool. Another disk will be pro-
cured and should be ready by June 1, 1887. The cost of the objective
was $52,000. The photographic lens will add several thousand dollars
to this. The recent death of Feil pére may cause serious delay in ob-
taining the glass for the third lens.

The mounting is under way in the workshops of Messrs. Warner &
Swasey, of Cleveland, Ohio, and will be delivered at Mount Hamilton
in June, 1887, for $42,000. It will contain many novel devices, among
them an application of a modified form of the bicyele ball-bearings to
the right ascension and declination axes, which will insure great ease
of movement. The driving clock will have an electrical control.

The hemispherical dome of 70 feet interior diameter has been built
by the Union Iron Works, of San Francisco, for $56,800. Tbe question
of an observing chair has been met by adopting Grubb’s plan of mov-
ing the floor vertically 16 feet. Some such arrangement becomes ab-
solutely necessary when we consider that the ‘‘ spectroscopic length”
of the telescope is some 5 feet more than the visual length, and the
photographie length some 8 feet less; the eye-piece may be 7 feet from
the base of the dome when the telescope is pointed to the zenith, or it
may be 35 feet in the horizontal position. The floor will be raised in
four minutes with a perfectly parallel motion, by hydraulic rams. The
cost of the floor will be $14,500. A star spectroscope is to be made by
Brashear, of Pittsburgh, for $1,000, and the micrometer by Fauth, of
Washington, for $750.

The total cost of the observatory will be a little over $500,000, leav-
ing nearly $200,000 available as a permanent endowment. The annual
income of the observatory from all sources will be about $20,000.

In the summer of 1886 Prof. G. C. Comstock made an investigation
of the Repsold meridian circle and a preliminary determination of the
latitude. The resulting latitude of the north dome is + 37° 20/ 25/2 ;
the longitude given by the U.S. Coast Survey is 8" 6™ 348.35 west of
Greenwich. A time-service is in operation over the whole Pacific sys-
tem of railways from Ogden to El Paso. Volume1 of the observatory
publications is in press, and will be distributed in the early summer.

Professor Holden’s plan for utilizing to the utmost the magnificent
equipment under his charge must commend itself to every one. The
plan is to relinquish the use of the 36-inch equatorial for certain hours
ASTRONOMY. 151

of each day to distinguished astronomers, specialists, who may wish to
turn its enormous power upon some one of the many unsolved prob-
lems of astronomy. Such astronomers may be invited to visit the
observatory for periods of several months, and will be given every
possible facility. The legislature of California has provided money for
a permanent support of the observatory.

Lund (1885).—Dr. Dunér is principally occupied with stellar spectra
and variable stars. Herr Laurin has observed with the meridian in-
strument a number of stars with large proper motion.

McCormick Observatory.—Professor Stone’s report for the year end-
ing June 1, 1886, states that the 26-inch equatorial has been employed
chiefly in examining and sketching southern nebulae. The nebula in
Orion and the Trifid and Omega nebule have received special attention;
many others have been studied, and two hundred and thirty-three new
nebulz have been discovered. “The features seen indicate that the
performance of the instrument employed surpasses that of any of the
great reflectors which have been used in the examination of nebulae.”
Double stars, comets, and occultations by the moon have also been ob-
served. Observations with the small equatorial for the revision of the
23° zone are now practically completed. Electric lamps are used for
illuminating the circles and field of the great equatorial, and have
proved most useful. The 45-foot dome revolves as easily as when first
erected.

The cost of the observatory building and instruments was about
$70,000, of which $64,000 was the gift of Leander J. McCormick. A
working fund of $25,000 was given by William H. Vanderbilt, and an
endowment of the directorship of $50,000 was subscribed by thealumni
of the University of Virginia.

Professor Stone is assisted by Mr. F. P. Leavenworth and Mr. F. Mul-
ler. Part 2 of volume lI, on the great comet of 1882, and part 3, on the
nebula of Orion, have been issued during the year.

MeGill College Observatory (1886).—A most thorough discussion of a
series of longitude observations by Professor McLeod, at MeGill Col-
lege, and Professor Rogers, at Harvard College Observatory, has been
published: the resulting longitude of the pier of the transit instrument
at McGill Observatory being 4" 54™ 188.543 + 08.043 west of Greenwich.
The center of the dome of the Harvard Observatory is assumed to be
in longitude 45 44™ 30°.993 + 08.041 west of Greenwich.

Melbourne (1886).—Mr. Ellery has published the first installment of
observations of southern nebulae made with the great Melbourne re-
flector from 1869 to 1885. A description of the great 4-foot Cassegrain-
ian reflectoris given; and there are several lithographs of small nebule.
Some fine results have been obtained in photography both of the moon
and of stars and nebule.

Milan.—The 18-inch Merz-Repsold refractor was mounted and ready
152 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

for work in May, 1886. The 8-inch glass has been used for double stars,
comets, ete. Messrs. Rajna, Porro, and Abetti have been engaged in —
geodetic work.

Morrison Observatory (1886).—The work of the equatorial for 1886
has consisted of a series of observations on comets Fabry, Barnard,
and Finlay (reduced and published or ready for publication); physical
observations of Jupiter and phenomena of Jupiter’s satellites, with a
few observations of occultations by the moon. The meridian circle can
be used, at present, only for time observations and for the determina-
tion of such star-places as are needed in equatorial work. <A daily and
efficient time-service is maintained on railroads extending to St. Louis,
Chicago, and Kansas City, and thence south and southwest. Meteor-
ological observations are kept up with regularity.

Professor Pritchett has prepared a small volume of the unpublished
observations of former years. This is now passing-through the press,
and will be distributed as soon as practicable. The expense of publi-
cation is borne by Mrs. Berenice Morrison-Fuller, the founder of the ob-
servatory.

The annual income of the observatory is $2,160. This covers all ex-
penses, including salaries. The director has no assistance, except that
rendered by his daughters, and such as is afforded by a boy in handling
the instruments and caring for the rooms.

Munich (1885).—The revision of Lamont’s catalogue is progressing
favorably. A number of stars from the southern Durchmusterung have
been added to the observing list, to fill up gaps. Dr. Seeliger has fin-
ished a count of the stars in this southern extension of the Durchmus-
terung similar to the one already published for stars. of the northern
hemisphere. Dr. Bauschinger was obliged to devote two months of
the year to “ Militérische Verpflichtungen.”

Nice (1886).—The refractor of 30 inches was provisionally mounted in
August, and it is stated that the trials with it have given most excel-
lent results.

O’Gyalla (1885).—The main work of the observatory has been the ex-
perimental determination of the mechanical energy of the radiations
of thirty-four stars of the first and second magnitude. The spectro-
scopic * Durchmusterung” of a zone 0° to 15° is nearly completed.
Sun-spots are observed regularly.

Oxford University Observatory (1886).—Professor Pritchard’s report
was read to the board of visitors on June 16. The photometrie meas-
urement of the magnitudes of an equatorial zone of stars has been un-
dertaken. Attention will be given to astronomical photography—a
department of work for which the observatory is well equipped—di-
recting investigations to, first, the relation which exists between the
photometric and the photographic magnitude of stars; second, the re-
liable uniformity of the photographie film; third, the amount of astro-
nomical accuracy attainable on the same.
ASTRONOMY. 1538

Palermo (1885).—New comets, shooting stars, solar spots, and pro-
tuberances have been observed; drawings have been made of the
planets, and atmospheric phenomena have been studied.

Paris (1885).—The report of Admiral Mouchez, presented to the
council on the 22d of January, 1886, gives especial prominence to the
work in astronomical photography. A reproduction is given of a pho-
tograph of the Pleiades taken by the Henry Brothers, and also an il-
lustration of the instrument employed. We have already referred to
many of the interesting results obtained. Three instruments have
been used for photography; the first (aperture 6.3 inches), the exper-
imental instrument used in 1884, has been employed in photometric
researches. The second is a smaller instrument, aperture 4.3 inches,
for photographing large comets and extended groups of stars. The
tbird is the equatorial of 13 inches aperture, with which the more im-
portant work has been done.

The routine work has not, however, suffered; in the meridian service
over sixteen thousand observations -have been made by sixteen differ-
ent observers; the instrument devised by M. Lowy, the equatorial
coudé, has been used for the observation of comets and minor planets,
and the time-service, meteorological department, etc., are all in a most
satisfactory condition. The reductions for the great catalogue were
completed up to 8 right-ascension. The catalogue has been printed up
to number 3,800.

Plonsk (1885).—Comets, double stars, ete., have been observed, and
an interesting study of the atmospheric lines of the spectrum has been
undertaken. Dr. Jedrzejewicz, the director, has made a new deter-
mination of the geographical co-ordinates of the observatory with the
following result: Latitude, +52° 37’ 40”; longitude, 27" 578.07 east
of Berlin.

Potsdam (1885).—Dr. Vogel’s most interesting report occupies more
than ten pages of the Vierteljahrsschrift (vol. 21, pp. 132-142). The
instruments have been improved in many minor details, and several
pieces of subsidiary apparatus have been added. Drs. Miiller and
Kempf have devoted considerable time to finishing the new determina-
tion of wave-lengths of the Fraunhofer lines. Drs. Vogel and Wilsing
have been at work upon the spectra of new stars, spectra of comets, and
spectra of solar spots and protuberances. Dr. Miiller has made a num-
ber of photometric observations of the major and minor planets, while
Dr. Wilsing has observed variable stars. Dr. Lohse has made a series
of drawings of Jupiter, and has obtained one hundred and forty-six
photographs of the sun; these latter, taken in connection with Dr.
Spoerer’s telescopic observations, will furnish ample material for the
history of the spots. Dr. Lohse has also continued his series of photo-
graphs of star-clusters with gratifying success. Dr. Wilsing hascarried
on a very interesting series of experiments to determine the density of
the earth. The third part of volume four and the fifth volume of the
154 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Annals have been published. The library has inereased to about thirty-
seven hundred volumes.

Prague (1885).—Professor Safarik has devoted his attention to varia-
ble stars.

Princeton (1886).—The 23-inch equatorial has been used by Professor
Young in micrometrical work upon close double stars, the satellites of
Uranus and Neptune, the surface markings of Jupiter, and the details
of Saturn. Comets are observed when they have become difficult ob-
jects for smaller instruments. Occasional spectroscopic observations
are made of sun-spots, prominences, and comets. The institution has
no endowment which would make it possible to undertake any extensive
or continuous programme of work. The small observatory is used
almost entirely for instruction in practical astronomy, this part of the
work being under the immediate supervision of Professor McNeill.

Pulkowa (1886).—The annual report of Dr. Struve is for the year
ending May 25,1886. The great routine work, the determination of
star-positions, has been continued as in former years. The 30-inch re-
fractor, in the hands of Dr. Hermann Struve, has been employed in
observing the faint double stars of Burnham’s catalogue, the satellites
of Mars, Saturn, and Neptune, the Maia nebula and Nova Andromede,
which was easily visible on January 27. Dr. Hermann Struve speaks in
the highest terms of the instrument, both as regards its optical power
and its mounting, the movement of the dome, etc. Backlund has meas-
ured with the 4-inch heliometer the positions of Jupiter’s satellites, for
a determination of the mass of the planet and the orbits of the satellites.
Hasselberg has been experimenting upon photography of the solar spee-
trum. The observatory has met with a severe loss in the recent death
of Herr Wagner.

Radcliffe Observatory (1886).—Observations have been made of the
sun, the moon throughout: the lunation, occultations by the moon, and
the phenomena of Jupiter’s satellites. Volume 41, containing results
for 1883, has been published.

Rio Janeiro (1886).—M. Cruls announces that the observatory is to
be transferred to a new site, nearly on the same parallel as the present
observatory, but two minutes of time farther west. M. Cruls has been
commissioned by the Emperor of Brazil to have a photographic appa-
ratus constructed similar to that at Paris, in order to co-operate in the
proposed photographic survey of the heavens.

Rousdon (1886).—A_ private observatory erected in 1884 and 1885 by
Mr. Cuthbert E. Peek at Rousdon, near Lyme Regis, Devon, England.
The principal instruments are, a 6.4-inch equatorial objective by Merz,
mounting by Cooke, a 2-inch Troughton & Simms transit, chronometers,
ete. Beneath the equatorial room is a laboratory which is also fitted
for photography. In 1886 the comets of the year and a list of long-
period variables were observed, and transit observations were made for
rating the chronometers. A volume containing observations of comets,
ASTRONOMY. 155

Nova Andromede, etc., and meteorological observations from 1882 to
1885 has been published.

Smith College Observatory.—Professor Todd includes in his report of
the Amherst Observatory a brief account of an observatory, the con-
struction of which he has supervised for the trustees of Smith College
(for young women), at Northampton, Massachusetts. A one-story brick
building is divided into an equatorial room, photographic dark-room,
library, clock-room, and transit-room. The equatorial is of 11 inches
aperture, the objective by the Clarks, and mounting by Warner &
Swasey. Incandescent lamps are provided for the illumination of the
circles and micrometers. The transit-room will contain a 4-inch merid-
jan cirele. The approximate position of the new observatory is: Lati-
tude, + 42° 19’ 7”; longitude, 4" 50™ 328.9 west of Greenwich.

South Evanston (1886).—Dr. Marshall D. Ewell has erected a small
private observatory at South Evanston, Cook County, Llinois, 10.8
miles north of Chicago. The equatorial is a 64-inch Clark refractor
mounted on a pier made of Portland cement and fine gravel so as to
form practically a single piece of rock from top to bottom. The dome
is 12 feet in diameter, built with ash ribs covered with tin, and turns
on six iron wheels. The observatory is also provided with a 24-inch
Troughton & Simms transit, sidereal and mean-time chronometers,
and minor apparatus.

Stockholm (1885).—Investigations upon the motions of the different
members of the solar system have absorbed the attention of the director
and his assistants. The mean motions of the apsides of the planets
Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are found to differ sensibly from the
values assigned by Leverrier. Herr Shdanow has continued Gyldén’s
researches upon the lunar theory, and Dr. Harzer has contributed a
valuable memoir upon the motion of Hecuba.

Strassburg.—Dr. Schur, previous to his departure for Gottingen, where
he takes Klinkerfnes’ place, published a report, dated May 6, 1886, sup-
plementary to his annual report of July, 1885. The principal meridian
work was upon southern stars in the extension of the Durchmusterung,
and Auwers’ eighty-three southern fundamental stars and refraction
stars. The moon was observed with the altazimuth; comets with the
refractor. Dr. Kobold succeeds Herr Schur. Dr. Winnecke has been
retired, at his own request, on account of ill health.

Tacubaya (1885) —The Observatorio Nacional, formerly at Chapulte-
pec, is now at Tacubaya, about 6 miles from the city of Mexico. The
final value of the longitude of the large meridian circle, from exchanges
in 1885 with St. Louis, is 6? 36™ 468,54 + 08.02 west of Greenwich.
(Astron. Jour., 7: 62.)

Taschkent (1885).—The refractor was employed principally in observ-
Ing sun-spots; comets and occultations were also observed. The merid-
ian circle furnished the places of a number of comparison stars for
156 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

comets and planets. Geographical positions were determined for six
towns in central Asia.

Temple Observatory (1886).—Observations of double stars have been
continued, and spectroscopic observations to determine the motion of
stars in the line of sight. :

United States Naval Observatory (1886).—No material change has
been made in the character of the work. Professor Hall has used the
26-inch refractor in observations of Saturn, of double stars, and of
satellites; and also for determinations of stellar parallax. No deteriora-
tion of the objective has been noticed since it was repolislfed ten years
ago.

The transit circle has been employed in observations of the sun,
moon, planets, and such stars as are necessary to complete the data
for a transit-circle catalogue, which will contain all of the miscellaneous
stars observed since the instrument was mounted, twenty years ago.
The reductions are somewhat behindhand on account or the inade-
quate computing force. The 9.6-inch equatorial has been used in the
observation of comets, asteroids, and the occultation of stars by the
moon; and the Repsold meridian circle at Annapolis temporarily, under
the direction of the Superintendent of the Washington Observatory, in
the observation of a list of southern stars. The revision of Yarnall’s
catalogue and the reduction of recent observations with the prime
vertical instrument are progressing favorably. Photographs of the sun
have been taken with the photo-heliograph used during the transit of
Venus. Ninety-eight negatives showing spots were secured between
January 11 and September 30, 1886.

The extensive time-service of the observatory is in an efficient state,
and the chronometer tests inaugurated a few years ago have proved of
great benefit to the naval service. Considerable attention has also
been given to the examination of nautical instruments, thermometers,
etc., for the Navy.

The volume for 1882, and Appendices I, U1, and 111 to the volume for
1883 have been distributed.

Commodore Belknap was relieved from duty as Superintendent on
June 7, 1886, by Commander A. D. Brown, and Commander Brown on
November 15 by Capt. Robert L. Phythian.

The expenses of the observatory are met by annual appropriations
from Congress, the naval officers (including professors) receiving the
pay of their respective ranks. The pay of fourteen officers attached to
the observatory December 1, 1886, aggregated $31,400.

The specific appropriation for the observatory for the year ending
June 30, 1886, contains the following items: For pay of three assistant
astronomers, $3,600; one clerix, $1,800; instrument maker, $1,500; four
watchmen, $4,880; assistant for the 26-inch equatorial, $720; gardener,
$1,000 ; seven laborers, $4,620; for miscellaneous computations, $1,200 ;
purchase of apparatus and material for repairs of instruments, $2,500;
ASTRONOMY. 157

library, $1,000 ; repairs to buildings, fuel, gas, furniture, stationery, and
contingent expenses, $3,900; freight on observatory publications sent
to foreign countries, $366. The entire annual cost of the maintenance
of the observatory may, therefore, be put at about $58,500 ;—$50,700
being for salaries and wages, and nearly $7,800 for other expenses. The
item of salaries- will vary considerably, of course, with the number and
rank of line officers on duty, and it should be borne in mind that sev-
eral of the officers are engaged upon work carried on at the observatory
as a naval institution.

The sum of $100,000 is now available for the erection of a new obser-
vatory, and the plans prepared six or eight years ago are being revised,
with a prospect of beginning work upon the new buildings in the course
of afew months. The total cost of the buildings is limited to $400,000.

Warner Observatory.—Dr. Swift has confined himself to the discovery
of new nebulz and the search for comets. The instruments are: A
16-inch Clark equatorial, provided with a filar micrometer and many
convenient accessories ; a 44-inch comet-seeker, and a sidereal clock by
Howard. <A spectroscope, to cost $1,000, has been ordered from Alvan
Clark & Sons. A description of the observatory, with its instruments
and work from 1885 to 1886, has been published as volume If of the ob-
servatory publications. This volume contains a list of four hundred and
nine nebule discovered since July 9, 1883 (it is stated that five hundred
and forty have been discovered in all), a list of the Warner astronom.
ical prizes, and the full text of the Warner prize essays on comets and
on the red ‘“‘ sky-glows.”

Vanderbilt University Observatory, Nashville, Tenn.—This observa-
tory is supplied with the following instruments:

Six-inch equatorial refractor, by T. Cooke & Sons, 8-foot focus, with
hour circle divided to single minutes, and subdivided to 28 by opposite
verniers ; and declination circle divided to 10/ and read by two verniers
to 10”. There is also a third vernier reading to 15’, used for setting
in declination, and read by the observer at the eye-piece with a small
telescope. The instrument is supplied with eight eye-pieces, ranging
from 60 to 600, and filar micrometer (bright field, dark wires only). A
revolving disk with colored glasses gives a change of color of field,—a
red one being found most useful, as it seems to permit observations of
fainter objects with sufficient distinctness of the wires. A ring microm-
eter (not belonging to the observatory) is also used with the equatorial.
A good driving clock gives a steady motion to the telescope. Two
spectroscopes belong to this instrument—one, a direct-vision spectro-
scope by Merz & Mahler, the other by Grubb.

The equatorial room is surmounted by a hemispherical dome, revolv-
ing readily by hand on twelve pairs of wheels. The shutter is of light
corrugated iron, in two sections; the upper section, two-thirds of the
entire length, passes through the zenith to the back of the dome; the
other part is drawn to one side, running on two light wheels, upon
158 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

a projecting platform. This instrument has been used during the past
year in the observation of comets, nebule, and the planets, and other
miscellaneous work. Positions of all the comets have been obtained
with either the ring or filar micrometer. Some experiments in celestial
photography have been carried on, and good views of the moon obtained.
The instrument cost about $1,900.

A 4-inch meridian circle, by Ertel, with circles 26 inches in diameter,
divided to 3’. On the east pier is mounted a frame carrying four micro-
scopes which read the circle to 0.5. The reticule consists of thirteen
vertical and two horizontal wires. The field or threads are illuminated
at will. This instrument is reversible, and cost about $1,400.

The chronograph is one of Warner & Swazey’s | latest designs, and
is used with either the equatorial or meridian circle. Cost, $375. The
sidereal clock, by Dent, cost $500. The mean time clock, by Howard,
cost $400.

There is also a 3-inch altazimuth, by Cooke; and a 5-inch portable
refractor, by Byrne. This latter instrument is not the property of the
observatory. With it Professor Barnard has discovered a large num-
ber of comets.

The observatory building consists of a transit room, an equatorial
room, and two computing rooms. The equatorial room is on the second
floor, and is reached by a spiral staircase.

Washburn Observatory (1886).—This fine observatory possesses a 154-
inch Clark equatorial, with filar micrometer, a Repsold meridian circle,
one sidereal and two mean-time clocks, a chronograph, chronometers,
etc., besides the excellent 6-inch equatorial which formerly belonged
to Mr. S. W. Burnham, and with which his first observations and
measurements of double stars were made. This latter equatorial,
together with a Fauth 3-inch transit, is mounted in a separate build-
ing of wood, called the students’ observatory. The main building
has, besides the rooms for the meridian circle and the large dome
for the equatorial, a separate clock and computing room, a room for
the electrical switch-board, time relays, ete., and a well furnished
room for a library and director’s study. There are also sleeping
rooms for two assistants, one of whom is the meteorological observer’
whose records are printed in the annaal volumes of the observatory.
The officers of the observatory are a director, two assistant astromoners
(one of whom is a lady), the meteorological observer, and a janitor.
The library of the observatory is maintained by the generosity of the
Hon. Cyrus Woodman, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, who has given,
for this purpose, the sum of $5,000. One half the yearly interest from
this sum is available for the purchase of new books, the other half
going to increase the principal until it reaches a specified sum. The
“publications” are printed at the expense of the State, and are issued
when circumstances warrant. Four volumes have already been issued,
and a fifth is nearly ready for publication.
ASTRONOMY. 159

The entire outfit of the observatory, in instruments and buildings, is
due to the munificence of the late Governor Cadwallader C. Washburn,
and cost not far from $50,000. <A detailed list of the cost of some of
the instruments is given in the volumes of publications of the obserya-
tory. All salaries and running expenses are paid by the regents of
the university from the general fund. These have heretofore amounted
to about $5,000 annually.

After the departure of Professor Holden, in December, 1885, the as-
sistants of the observatory, Mr. Milton Updegraff and Miss Alice Lamb,
completed the observations and reductions of the three hundred and
three star list, and the reading of the proof-sheets for the publication of
volume Ivy (1885) of the observatory reports. During the early sum-
mer of 1866 a careful study of the division errors of special diameters
of the meridian circle was undertaken; also of its horizontal flexure.
Observations of the latitude made with the meridian circle since its
first mounting show a discordance between circle east and circle west
of about 1’. Tne cause of this is now an object of study, and is be-
_ lieved to be mainly due to flexure. The large equatorial has been kept
employed upon double stars, and in January, 1887, a series of measure-
ments was made with its filar micrometer upon the position of Sappho
(80) at opposition. An index to those stars in the six Greenwich cata-
logues not occurring in Flamsteed, has been prepared by Miss Lamb,
and will be published in volume y.

The usual routine work of the observatory, such as controlling the
clocks in the city of Madison, the time bells in the university recita-
tion rooms, and the daily furnishing of time-signals to the railroads
entering Madison, has been faithfully attended to. Professor Holden’s
successor as director of the observatory is Prof. John E. Davies.

Washington University Observatory, St. Louis (1886).—Instruction in
theoretical and practical astronomy is the main object of the obsery-
atory. An extensive time-service is maintained, and the observatory
co-operates with Government field parties in geodetic work. Prof. H.
S. Pritchett has one assistant. The income is derived from the general
university endowment and from the time-service.

* Woodside Observatory.—Mr. Charles L. Woodside has a small private
observatory at East Boston, Massachusetts, its approximate position
being latitude +42° 22/ 39”; longitude 4 44™ 9° west of Greenwich.
The, principal instrument is a silvered-glass reflector of 64 inches aper-
ture and 5 feet focal length; the mirror is by Brashear, of Allegheny,
and the mounting by Mr. Woodside himself. This is to be devoted for
several years to a careful and systematic study of the colors of all stars
brighter than the sixth magnitude visible at Boston. Mr. Woodside
has devised a method of computing occultations which he has described
jn the Sidereal Messenger for Ju-y, 1886.

Yale College Observatory (1886).—For the year ending June 1, 1836,
Dr. Elkin reports progress in his work of triangulation in the Pleiades

with the 6-inch heliometer. He proposes to observe ten of the brightest
stars in the northern hemisphere for parallax. Mr. A. Hall, jr., has been
engaged in observations of Titan with the heliometer, with a view to a
new determination of the mass of Saturn.

Ziirich (1885).—Dr. Rudolf Wolf is occupied almost entirely with sun-
spot statistics. He fixes the last ‘‘maximum” of spots at 1883.9.

ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS.

Barometer coefficients for clocks.—Dr. Hilfiker has determined the
barometric coefficient—or the variation in rate for a change of 1 milli-
meter in the atmospheric pressure—for.a Winnerl clock with gridiron
pendulum comparing the Winner! clock with the H'pp normal electric
clock at Neuchatel on each night of observation.

These comparisons, made between August, 1884, and September,
1885, give an idea of the influence of the mode of compensation upon
the value of the barometric coefficient. The following table shows the
results obtained at Geneva and at several other observatories for their
normal clocks:

The new optical glass.—Nature for October 28, 1886, contains an in-
teresting account of the experiments of Professor Abbé and Dr.
Schott in their endeavors to produce a glass of such chemical compo-
sition that it may be possible to make lenses free from the secondary
chromatic aberration and other defects. For the microscope lenses
already made of the new glass Professor Abbé claims great superiority
in many important respects.-

Hlectric illumination.—Prof. Ormond Stone, of the McCormicke Ob-
servatory, uses for illuminating the circles and micrometer wires of
the great equatorial, Edison incandescent lamps of one-candle power,
run by what is known as the ‘‘Orne motor battery,” or by the *‘ Edeo
battery,” the latter being used where a more continuous light is re-
quired. The success of the experiment here has resulted in the uso
of electricity, at least for circle illumination, at West Point, Yale and
other observatories.

In the Greenwich spectroscopic observations, ‘a slip of metal coated °
ASTRONOMY. 161

with Balmain’s luminous paint, inserted immediately behind the meas-
uring pointer, has been frequently employed to give a phosphorescent
illumination of the field.”

Gautier’s mercury-basin for nadir and reflection observations, de-
scribed in last year’s report, has been tried at the Melbourne Observa-
tory, and gives highly satisfactory results.

We have already referred, in the report of the Lick Observatory, to
the completion of the 36-inch objective and its removal to Mount
Hamilton.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Astronomical prizes.—At the meeting of the Paris Academy of Science
on December 27, 1888, the Lalande prize was awarded to Dr. Backlund
for his work on Encke’s comet; the Valz prize to M. G. Bigourdan for
investigation of personal equation in the measurement of double stars;
the Damoiseau prize to M. Souillart for his theoretical researches on
Jupiter’s satellites, and an “encouragement” of 1,000 franes to .M.
Obrecht for his study of the application of photometry to the eclipses
of Jupiter’s satellites. The Bordin prize was awarded to M. RK. Radau
for his work on the theory of astronomical refraction.

The gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society was awarded to
Mr. G. W. Hill for his researches on the motion of the moon.

The Rumford medal of the Royal Society, the Rumford gold and silver
medals of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Draper
medal of the National Academy were awarded to Prof. 8. P. Langley
for his researches with the bolometer.

The Watson medal of the National Academy, with an honorarium of
$100, was awarded to Dr. B. A. Gould.

The Royal Society of Edinburgh awarded the Makdougall-Brisbane
prize to Dr. Edward Sang for his communication on the need for decimal
subdivisions in astronomy and navigation.

The Warner prizes, $100 for each comet discovered (and announced
under certain conditions), were conferred, in 1886, as follows: Mr.
Brooks, $300; Mr. Finlay, $100; Mr. Barnard, $100.

The American Astronomical Society of Brooklyn.—Among the papers
read in 1886 were: “The Earth’s Temperature,” by H. M. Parkhurst;
“ Faye’s Nebular Speculations,” by G. P. Serviss; ‘Origin of Meteor-
ites,” by G. W. Coakley and H. M. Parkhurst. The president of the
society is Mr. S. V. White, the secretary, Mr. G. P. Serviss, Brooklya,
New York.

Baltimore Amateur Astronomical Society.—A number of gentlemen
of Baltimore have organized an amateur astronomical society, meet-
ing each month for the presentation of papers and discussion of obser-
vations. Dr. Hooper, 1425 Linden avenue, the secretary, has a 5-inch
Clark equatorial; Mr. Gildersleeve a 6-inch equatorial with object-
glass by Dr. C. S. Hastings; Mr. Stahn a 4inch glass, a'so by Dr.

H. Mis. 600——11
162 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1886.

Hastings, and Mr. Numsen a 4-inch Cooke equatorial, mentioned in the
report last year under the ‘“ Denmore Observatory.” Physical obser-
vations are made of the sun, moon, planets, and comets. Mr. Stahn
has kept a record of sun-spots, and has devised numerous ingenious
accessories for his instruments.

Astronomical Journals.—The reissue of the “Astronomical Jour.
nal” by Dr. Gould is cordially welcomed, particularly by American
astronomers, who are thereby furnished with a more prompt means
of intercommunication than has been heretofore available. An inter-
val of twenty-five years occurs after No. 144; and No. 145, bearing the
date of November 2, 1886, begins volume vil. The Journal is edited
by Dr. Gould, as before, at Cambridge, Massachusetts.

A new monthly astronomical review, Revista do Observatorio, has
appeared, under the editorship of Dr. Luis Cruls, of the Imperial Ob-
servatory of Rio Janeiro. The journal will be found interesting and
valuable by amateurs and those interested in the progress of astron-
omy, as well as by professional astronomers.

We are at the same time obliged to record the discontinuance of the
Astronomical Register, with the completion of its twenty-fourth vol-
ume, December, 1886, No. 288.

The Influence of astigmatism on Astronomical Observations.—It ap-
pears from Professor Seeliger’s researches that this malformation in the
eye, which is far from uncommon, exerts a greater influence on astro-
nomical measurements than is generally supposed. Thus, he shows
that a systematic error in a series of observed declinations amounting
to 0/’.26 may very well be due to it; and it appears that the discordances
in observed position angles of double stars—depending on the inclina-
tion of the line joining the components to the vertical—with which the
measures of some observers are affected, may be referred to the same
cause. (Nature, November 18, 1886.)

Determination of time.—Dollen has described in the Nachrichten
(114: 289) an expeditious method of obtaining a clock correction where
great refinement is not necessary. The observation is made in the ver-
tical of the pole-star, and tables have been published by the Pulkowa
Observatory giving for some sixty odd stars all the quantities which
are independent of the latitude, required in the formule. The work of
reduction is made as brief as possible.

An astronomical directory.—M. A. Lancaster, the librarian of the
Brussels Observatory, has published a very useful list of observato-
ries, their geographical co-ordinates, and the astronomers attached to
them; of astronomical societies and institutions, and of reviews and
journals specially devoted to astronomy. The little book contains also
a list of names and addresses of astronomers not attached to any ob-
servatory, and of amateurs, as well as a list of makers of astronomical
instruments.

Miss Olerke’s admirable ‘ Popular History of Astronomy during the
ASTRONOMY. 163

Nineteenth Century” has been so widely reviewed that it seems unnee-
essary to do more than merely to mention it by title here. The book
is “ untechnical,” and the “ terse and vigorous ” style makes it most in-
teresting from beginning to end. There are numerous references to
the original sources of information.

ASTRONOMICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, 1886.

The following bibliography is arranged by subjects, and contains jour-
nal articles and reprints from transactions of societies, as well as more
formal publications. No pretense is made to completeness, even to the
extent of including all titles that have come under the compiler’s no-
tice, and, in some cases, where it has not been possible to examine the
publications themselves, the imprints, etc., may be imperfect. The
prices quoted are generally taken from Friedlinder’s Naturz Novitates,
in German “mark” (lL mark = 100 pfennige = 1 frane 25 centimes = 25
cents, nearly).

it is hoped that the abbreviated titles of journals will be intelligible
without special explanation. (‘*Compt. Rend.” is, of course, the
Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l’ Académie des sciences,
Paris, and *“ Month. Not.” the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronoin-
ical Society.) Among the imprint and other abbreviations there occur:

Bd. = Band. n. F. =neue Folge.
d.= die, der, del, ete. n. Ss. = new series.
ed. = edition. p. = page.
hrsg. — herausgegeben. Pp = page of this summary.
il. = illustrated. pl. = plates.
k. k. = kaiserlich kéniglich. pt. = part.
Lfg. == Lieferung. Rev. = Review.
M. =mark. 8. =series.
n. d.=no date. sh. = shilling.
n. p.=no place of publication. v. = volume.

The alphabetical arrangement is made to serve as an index to the
present record, by inserting after the subject-heading, the pages of this
review (p*—) on which the different subjects are noticed.

In the references to journals the volume and page are simply sepa-
rated by a colon; thus: 5:81 indicates volume 5, page 81.

By NEtson H. DarRTON.

INTRODUCTORY.

The preparation of this review was undertaken by the writer with
serious misgivings as to his ability either to complete it in the time al-
lotted, or to reduce the results of a year’s activity in the various branches
of geologic research to the space assigned ; and the outcome is in sev-
eral respects unsatisfactory.

It was originally intended to inelude a bibliography of North Amer-
ican geology for the year 1886; but as the work progressed, this was
found to be impossible without greatly exceeding the space assigned
to the review. It was, however, believed that the bibliography would
be of such value to the geologists of this and other countries as to war-
rant its separate publication. Accordingly, it was annotated, so mod-
ified as to include a subject-index under the same alphabetic arrange-
ment as the author’s bibliography, and so extended as to become ex-
haustive for North America; and thus modified it will form Bulletin No.
44 of the U. S. Geological Survey.

It was originally intended, also, to include in this review a résumé of
the foreign contributions of the year to geologic philosophy; but this,
too, finally proved impracticable, partly on account of the inaccessibil-
ity of much of the literature, and partly on account of the limits of
space and time.

By reason of hurried preparation, the abstracts in this review are
often less full than seems desirable, and by reason of the character of
the material the abstracts are generally presented more or less discon-
nectedly. It is believed, however, that all important publications dis-
tributed during 1886, or bearing that date and received early in the
present year, are noticed in the following pages. With the exception
of a few words of introduction or connection, the writer has acted sim-
ply as an abstractor, and has endeavored to avoid bias or partiality.

QUATERNARY.

1. No subject in American geology is now receiving more attention
than that including the many interesting problems of the Quaternary.
Each year brings forth a considerable mass of literature in which con-

tributions are made to this subject. In an address before the Ameri-
can Association in 1886, Chamberlin* summarized the results attained
up to that time, especially those relating to drift phenomena. The
following is a very brief abstract of his conclusions: Three phases
are recognized in the course of the undulatory drift border: (1) a
thickened edge or terminal moraine; (2) a thin margin; and (3) an
attenuated border of scattered pebbles. The morainic border prevails
from the Atlantic to the Ohio, while attenuated borders reach thence
to the Rocky Mountains. Attenuated borders delimit an earlier ice-
incursion, and the morainic border a later one. The interval be-
tween the two principal glacial epochs is represented by changes
of orographic attitude and drainage ; by different degrees of erosion,
decomposition, and ferrugination; and by vegetal accumulations and
lacustrine oscillations. The chief interglacial epoch was marked by
great erosion. The drifts are grouped into the earlier, embracing two
or more subdivisions, and the later, embracing several subordinate
phases; also a third series, embracing the Great Basin deposits of
aqueous origin. Of bowldery clays at least three genetic classes are
recognized: (1) the subglacial; (2) the englacial or superglacial; (3)
the subaqueous ; and perhaps (4) tills ridged transversely by the thrust
of the margin of the ice. Of moraines, terminal, lateral, medial, and
interlobate are described; and of forms cf ~vound moraine the following
are enumerated: (1) till tamuli; (2) mammillary and lenticular hills; (3)
elongated parallel ridges; (4) drift billows; (5) crag and tail; (6) pre-
crag and combings; and (7) veneered hills; the first three being grouped
under the term “drumlins.” Of the assorted drifts, two classes com-
monly embraced are excluded: (1) the “orange sands,” commonly
regarded as Champlain deposits, because there is great uncertainty in
regard to their age, and good reason to believe that they are not Cham-
plain; (2) drifts reworked by non glacial agencies. Omitting these, two
classes there are recognized; (1) those that gathered immediately within
and beneath the ice body itseif, or against its margin, and (2) those
borne to distances beyond its limit by glacial drainage. Of the first,
there are the products (a) of superglacial streams; (b) of moulins ; (¢) of
subglacial streams; (d) of streams in ice-canons; and (e) debouchure
deposits at the glacial margin. The importance of the distinction be-
tween kames and osars is urged. Of valley drift the intermediate
phases are passéd over, and attention is directed to two extreme
phases: (a) the moraine-headed valley trains and (b) the loess, the
former the deposit of vigorous glacial floods, the latter inferred to be
the product of slack drainage. Attention is directed to the ice-blocked
ancient lakes, especially of the greater basins, to the overflow phenom-
ena, and to the difference between ancient and existing water levels.
Finally, the current interpretations of glacial phenomena, and specula-

NORTH AMERICAN GEOLOGY. += Sit

tions respecting the origin of the glacial epoch are discussed, and the
hypothesis that the regional refrigeration of the glacial time was
brought about by shifting of the terrestrial poles is favorably presented.

2. In a paper on “ North America in the Ice Period” * Newberry dis-
cusses the iceberg theory and glacial climate, and states very forcibly
the objections to the former and to Whitney’s theory of the latter. It
is shown that the iceberg theory is inapplicable to the mountainous
districts of the West, and can not be reconciled to such phenomena in
the Hast as (1) the widely different altitudes of glaciation within short
distances ; (2) the entire independence of the principal glacial features
of altitude in the vicinity of the terminal moraine ; (3) the driftless area
of Wisconsin; (4) the complete absence of marine shells in the inland
drift deposits; and (5) the characteristic effects of the erosion when
compared with glaciers now in existence.

3. Branner makes some very interesting observations on the relation
of topography to the glacial flow in the Wyoming and Lackawanna
valleys, Pennsylvania, a district of sharp relief and numerous rock
outcrops. Two systems of striz are found, one parallel to the general
southward slope of the country, and produced by the flow of the great
mass of ice in that direction, and another system determined entirely
by the local topography, and apparently due to the effect cf the latter
upon the ice sheet when it was greatly reduced in thickness.t

The same writer{ discusses the greatest elevation of glaciation in
northeastern Pennsylvania, finding that the glacier overrode peaks
2,200 feet in height, which White and Lewis considered islands above
the level of glaciation. These peaks are the Elk Mountains. Careful
search has revealed unquestionable glacial striz on one of their sum-
mits.

4. Britton § finds driftless areas at a moderate height on the serpen-
tine hills of Staten Island, a few miles north of the terminal moraine,
which indicate a thickness of the ice of less than 200 feet.

5. Ina paper on the geology of Cincinnati,|| James gives some in-
teresting information on the local surface geology of that district, and,
in view of the absence of glacial drift from the tops of some of the hills,
doubts White’s estimate that the glacial dam of the Ohio stood 645 feet
above low water, as these hills are only 460 feet above at the highest
point.

6. Salisbury discusses the distribution of drift copper in the Northwest.
As far as reported, it occurs over an area of nearly half a million square
miles, extending as far as 600 miles south, and several hundred miles
east and west, of Lake Superior. Fragments are especially plentiful at

Grand Traverse Bay, at the mouth of the Llinois River, and along the
lower part of the Wabash; but this may be due to fuller records from
these places. In general, it is found that the size of the masses de-
creases as their distance from the Lake Superior region increases, and
it is thought that, with some possible local exceptions, the latter has
been its source.*

7.In apaper on the geology in the vicinity of the Northern Pacific
Railroad, Newberryt gives an account of his observations on the drift.
In the Yellowstone Valley he was unable to find the evidences of the
eastern drift reported by C. A. White, and considers the drift of the
upper Missouri local in character.

8. Comstock describes some features of the drift in the Rocky Mount-
ains of Wyoming and Colorado. All the glacial action is inferred to
have been local, but intense. In the San Juan district, and to a less
extent elsewhere, a ‘distinct peculiarity lies in the duplex character cf
the erosion; that is to say, there are two zones of glaciation vertically,
the upper largely representing the transportative action, the lower
being eroded without removal of the débris to any extent. The imper-
fect drainage had fastened the ice sheet so that it could move as a unit
only in the superficial portion, while the lower part acted like a slowly
working plow, which cut deeply but not so extensively as the overlying
mass. In the more elevated tracts, therefore, the lower portion often
lies in grooves like cwls-de-sac, and many of these exist to-day, connected
with the main drainage often by reversed or indirect drainage.” ¢

9. In his paper on the Post-tertiary elevation of the Sierra Nevada,
‘ Le Conte incidentally discusses the later history of the Mississippi
Basin. He coneludes that during the Champlain period it was filled
with 400 feet or more of deposits; that in the terrace period elevation
took place, and the present wide channel was cut,—not by cliff erosion
as in the Grand Cajon, but by shifting of the stream from side to side,
and that in the present epoch there has been subsidence and, as shown
by Hilgard, a refilling with about fifty feet of alluvium.§

10. Ina paper on the Geology of Long Island, F. J. H. Merrill makes the
interesting statement that the morainal hills owe their elevation in great
part to a series of folds at right angles to the course of the glacier, and
involving the pre-glacial deposits. The deep bays in the north shore
of the island appear to have been plowed across these flexed beds, and
are found to be heavily flanked by ridges and hills. From the thinness
of the till deposits south of Long Island Sound (except opposite its
western extremity) it is thought that the depression was pre-glacial,
and the ice sheet lost the loads of detritus in its lower portion and
attached to its base in passing over the broader part of the Sound,
only carrying across the bowlders and débris upon its surface. The

stratified beds composing the greater mass of the formations of the
island are unconformably overlain by the drift, but although they yield
* some fossils, their age is considered uncertain. Some of the clays ex-
posed along the north shore may be Cretaceous, and other clays and
sands are thought to be Tertiary, while the greater mass of the strati-
fied sands and gravels are thought to represent the Post-pliocene of
Sankaty Head and Gardiner’s Island.*

11. The same author reports the preliminary results of a detailed study
of the Quaternary and recent formation of the coast region of New Jer-
sey, made under the direction of the State geologist, Professor Cook.t
An account is given of the subsidence of the coast and the variations in
its rate. It is found also that the ocean shore is wearing away and the
winds and waves cause its recession westward. Beach and strand
formation is discussed, and descriptions are given of the several beaches
and their recent changes.

12. In the introduction to this report t Professor Cook discusses the
terraces of the coastal plain. They occur from 40 to 60 feet above tide,
and it has been determined that they slope southward at the rate of
three inches to the mile. It is thought that the higher terraces mark
the position of the ocean level at the close of the glacial period, and
that there has been an uplift between that time and the present subsi-
dence.

13. On the northeastern corner of Staten Island Britton finds the
morainal beds capping the finely stratified sands and clays along a line
of contact between 25 and 30 feet above tide, indicating at least that
amount of elevation since the glacial period, but there are other de-
posits of pre-glacial drift of much greater elevation on the island, and
some other areas have been recently discovered.§

14, In a paper on the geology of Washington and vicinity, McGee
gives an account of the Quaternary formations of that district. The city
lies on the terraces of an amphitheater extending back from the Poto-
mac. Up to an elevation of about 160 feet there is found a well-defined
Quaternary deposit to which the name Columbia formation is applied.
Its upper portion consists of loam or brick clay, varying from nothing to
20 or 30 feet in thickness; and its lower, of sand, gravel, and bowlder
beds, from a trifle to 20 feet in thickness, all more or less stratified
throughout. It is thought that it represents a subaqueous delta of the
Potomac River, deposited during the period of formation of the terraces.
Its absence from above tide on the eastern side of the amphitheater is
attributed to a dislocation bounding the coastal plain, of which other
- evidence is also found.||

15. Smith describes a bed of clay inclosed in the Delaware gravels
near Philadelphia. It contains remains of trees of species now living,
and appears to be similar in age to the other clay beds farther up the
Delaware valley.*

16. Dwight describes some very curious structural features in Cham-
plain depesits in the Hudson valley near Newburgh. At the locality de-
scribed there are three huge clay-filled pot-holes in a sand bed. These
holes are in line, close together and elliptical in outline, with their
longer axes at right angles to the Hudson. They appear to be in a
faulted block of the sand, and the fault line on one side is marked by a
hard wall composed of sand cemented by carbonate of lime.t

17. Ashburner and Hill¢ describe the buried valley of the Susque-
hanna between Pittston and Kingston, in Luzerne County, Pa., and
discuss the former channel of that river and its peculiarities: Ash-
burner describes the Archbald pot-holes in the same vicinity, and from
their position considers them either due to water flowing beneath the
glacier or over its edge.§

18. Dawson describes the bowlder drift and sea margins at Little
Metis, Lower St. Lawrence. The bowlder drift occurs in belts exposed
at low tide, and extending out to some distance from the shore. The first
or shore terrace seldom holds bowlders, but farther inland there is a ter-
race 30 feet higher, consisting of sand resting on hard bowlder clay or
till, the latter sometimes being filled with bowlders and at others with
marine shells. Higher up huge bowlders are found perched upon the
bare rocks, the latter being rough and showing no sign of polishing
except near the second terrace. It is thought that these phenomena
can not be ascribed to land ice, and are similiar to those of the Lower
St. Lawrence generally, except in some lateral valleys on the northern
shore, where local glaciers appear to have descended. ||

19. Lamplugh describes the glacial shell beds of British Columbia,
adding detail to Dawson’s previous descriptions. The beds at Esqui-
mault, Vancouver’s Island, lie in a gully in polished and striated dio-
rite. The shells are abundant in the lower layers of the clays, and
decreasing in number upward, are absent ten feet from the surface. It
is thoug!t that the beds were shoved up into this gully by the ice in
its flow down the channel, as they dip steeply shoreward and are often
disturbed.

20. Gilbert has discussed two instances of post-glacial deformation.
First, in a paper on the inculeation of scientific method by example,
he incidentally investigates the cause of the elevation of the center
of the Bonneville Basin. It is supposed that this great Quaternary

lake slightly depressed the earth’s crast, and that on its evaporation
the normal conditions were resumed and the lake bed and terraces
elevated.* The same writer called the attention of. the American As-
sociation to several small anticlinal ridges in the rocks of western
New York, which are believed to have resulted from horizontal expan-
sion of superficial strata consequent on post-glacial amelioration of
climate.t

21. Niagara Falls.—At the Buffalo meeting of the American Associa-
tion there was a general - discussion of the various questions connected
with the chronology of Niagara Falls, which was taken part in by Gil-
bert, Chamberlin, Hall, Pohlman, Claypole, Woodward, Wright, Davis,
Comstock, and Holly. It wasshown by Gilbert that the Niagara River
probably began its work at the close of the glacial period, when the
retreating ice opened the St. Lawrence Valley and separated the two
lakes, Erie being held back by the Niagara escarpment. Consequently
the age of the Niagara River is a measure of Post-quaternary time.
The rate of recession determined by comparison of a recent survey by
Woodward with those of Hall in 1842 and the United States Engi-
neers in 1875 would require seven thousand years for the excavation
of the 6 miles of gorge. A number of considerations, however, qualify
this estimate, and they are summarized as follows:

“‘ At stages of recession earlier than the present there was a thinner
body of limestone to be undermined and removed; there was a deeper
exposed body of shale; the water plunged from a greater height; the
water was concentrated in a narrower channel; it carried more floating
ice; and all these differences tended to make the rate of recession faster,
The rate may also have been influenced by variations in the amount of
detrital load (a tool of erosion), by variations in the solvent power of
the water, and by variations of its volume due to changes of climate or
catchment basin. The catchment basin was formerly ‘extended by in-
cluding part of the area of the ice sheet, but it may have been abridged

by the partial diversion of Laurentian drainage to other courses.
“The problem admits of expression in an equation :

22. Pohlman advances the opinion that in pre-glacial time a small lake
occupied the valley between the Niagara and Corniferous escarpments,
and drained northward along the line of the present Niagara gorge as
far as the whirlpool, and thence down the now drift-filled valley to St.
David’s. There appears to have been no great cataract, but three
small falls over the ledges of hard beds, and the stream was joined at
the whirlpool by a branch from the present lower channel. The chan-
nel of the Niagara above the Falls was apparently in part cut by the
reversal of this drainage into Lake Erie by some agency of the ice age.

These opinions lead to the conclusion that after the lakes were sepa-
rated at the close of the glacial period the Niagara River had only to
clean out the drift-filled channels of the main pre-glacial streim to the
whirlpool and thence of its branch to the present outlet. This explana-
