REPORT

UPON THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U.S, NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1889,

By G. BRowN GOODE,
Assistant Secretary Smithsonian Institution, in charge of U. S. National Museum.

A.—ORGANIZATION AND SCOPE OF THE MUSEUM.

The National Museum is under the charge of the.Smithsonian In-
stitution, and its operations are supervised by the Board of Regents of
the Institution.

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is by law the keeper of
the collections.

In the act of Congress establishing the Smithsonian Institution are
contained the following provisions concerning the scope of the museum
to be placed under its charge:

(1) The law specifies certain classes of objects which shall come
into the custody of the Institution, viz: All objects of art; all objects
of foreign and curious research (7. e., ethnological collections); all
objects of natural history; all plants; all geological and mineralog-
ical specimens belonging or hereafter to belong to the United States,
which may be in the city of Washington—including the “ National
Cabinet of Curiosities,” at that time in one of the halls of the Patent
Office building—in whosesoever custody they may be.

(2) It provides that in proportion as suitable arrangements can be
made for their reception these objects shall be delivered to such per-
sons’as may be authorized by the Board of Regents to receive them.

(8) It provides that they shall be arranged in such order and so
classed as best to facilitate their examination and study.

(4) It provides that they shall thus be arranged in the building to be
inclosed for the institution. :

(5) it authorizes the Regents to obtain new specimens, by exchange
of duplicate specimens, and by gift, and directs that they shall be also
appropriately classed and arranged,

(6) It constitutes the Secretary of the Smithsonian. Institution the
keeper of the museum.

4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF COLLECTIONS.

The coilections of the Museum are made up, in large part, of the fol-
lowing materials:

(1) The natural history and anthropological collections accumulated
since 1850 by the efforts of the officers and correspondents of the Smith-
sonian Institution.

(2) The collections of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, the Perry ex-
pedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions.

(3) The collections of the scientific officers of the Pacific Railroad
survey, the Mexican boundary survey, and of the surveys carried on by
the Engineer Corps of the Army.

(4) The collections of the United States geological surveys under the
direction of the United States geologists, Hayden, King, and Powell.

(5) The collections of the U. 8. Fish Commission.

(6) The gifts by foreign Governments to the Museum or to the Pres-
ident or other public officers of the United States, who are forbidden by
law to retain such gifts in their private possession.

(7) The collections made by the United States to illustrate the ani-
mal and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of the na-
tive races of the country, on the occasion of the International Exhibi-
tion at Pliiladelphia in 1876, and the fishery collections displayed by
the United States in the International Fisheries Exhibition at Berlin
in 1880 and at London in 1883. .

(8) The collections given by the Governments of the several foreign
nations, thirty in number, which participated in the exhibition at Phila-
delphia.

(9) The industrial collections given by numerous manufacturing and
commercial houses of Europe and America, at the time of the Phila-
delphia Exhibition and subsequently.

(10) The material received in exchange for duplicate specimens
from the museums in Europe and America, at the time of the Phila-
delphia Exhibition and subsequently.

B.—SPECIAL TOPICS OF THE YEAR.
CLASSIFIED SERVICE OF THE MUSEUM.

A schedule representing the present actual needs of the service was,
in response to a Senate resolution, submitted by the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution. By this it was shown that the sum of $200,000
at least was required to pay the salaries of the necessary scientific
assistants, the clerical force, mechanics, and laborers, for the construc-
tion of suitable cases, and for the employés connected with the heating,
lighting, electrical, and telephonic service.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5

A COLLECTION OF BUSTS OF STATE GOVERNORS IN 1860.

A collection of thirty-two busts, including one of James Buchanan,
has been presented to the Museum by Mrs. Anna E. Douglass. The
busts were executed by Mr. Henry Dexter, of Cambridge. After the
series was completed in plaster, it was placed on exhibition in the Dorie
Hall of the State House at Boston. The lapse of time and the celeb-
rity of several of the governors have made this collection of great value
from an historical stand-point. It is also probable that the sculptor’s
efforts indicate the best work of the kind produced i in the United States .
up to the year 1860.

AERONAUTIC COLLECTION.

It is intended to establish in the Museum a Department of Aero-
nauties, in which will be established (1) balloons and apparatus lighter
than air, and (2) models of aerostats heavier than air. The co-operation
of the Aeronautic Society of Great Britain has been invited by the
Secretary of the Institution, who is especially interested in the subject.

INCREASE OF THE COLLECTIONS.

A careful estimate of the number of specimens in all the departments
of the Museum places the total at 2,864,244. In 1882 the total was
estimated at about 192,000. At that time, however, some of the largest
collections in the Museum, such as the ethnological collection, had not
been brought under control, and no estimate of their extent was then
possible; so that the difference between the totals for 1882 and 1889
can not be accounted for solely by the number of specimens received
during these years, but includes also the material which was already
in the possession of the Museum, but which had not been eee at
the time of the first census of ie: collections in 1882.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION.

The American Historical Association was founded in 1884 for the pro-
omotion of historical studies, for the collection and preservation of his-
torical manuscripts, and for kindred purposes in the interest of Amer-
ican history. By an act of Congress approved January 4, 1889, the
regents of the Smithsonian Institution are authorized to permit the
American Historical Association to deposit its collections, manuscripts,
books, etc., in the keeping of the Smithsonian Institution. Under this
Act the American Historical Association reports annually to the Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution concerning its proceedings and the
condition of historical study in America.

VISITORS DURING INAUGURATION SEASON,

On March 2 and 5 the Museum and Smithsonian buildings were vis-
ited by 106,075 people.
6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

CINCINNATI EXPOSITION.

The Exposition closed on November 8, 1888. The appropriation
available for the use of the Museum was $40,000. The space occu-
pied by the Museum exhibits was 12,000 square feet. Sixteen depart-
ments of the Museum prepared exhibits. The total attendance at the
Exposition was 1,055,276, the daily average being 9,595.

TRANSFER OF DISBURSEMENT OF MUSEUM APPROPRIATIONS.

A statement relating to this matter is made on page 20 of the report
for last year. Congress has sanctioned the proposed transfer, and the
Museum appropriations will henceforth be disbursed under the direc-
tion of the Smithsonian Institution.

FORMATION OF A FORESTRY COLLECTION.

Through the courtesy of the Secretary of Agriculture Dr. B. E Fer-
. now, Chief of the Forestry Division of the Department of Agriculture,
has accepted the charge of the Section of Forestry in the National Mu-
seum. The Section of Forestry was established in April, 1889.

C.—THE CONDITION OF THE COLLECTIONS.
INCREASE OF THE COLLECTIONS.

The total number of specimens as estimated in the appended table
is now not far from three millions. The increase during this year is
much smaller than in any previous year since the completion of the
Museum building. At the close of 1882 there were about 192,000 speci-
mens in the collections. The increase during 1883 was about 170,000;
during 1884, more than 1,200,006. It was during this year that the
extent of the ethnological collection was first estimated and also of the
collections of mollusks, insects, aboriginal pottery, birds’ eggs, reptiles
and batrachians, and mesozoic fossils. During 1835 no estimate was
made, this being the year when the fiscal year was adopted in place of
the calendar year, and the report for 1885 covered only six months.
In 1886 a careful] estimate showed a further increase of about 950,000.
In 1887 the increase was nearly 250,000, and in 1888 nearly 140,000.
The increase during the fiscal year covered by this report is only
60,000. This may be accounted for to a large degree by the fact that,
the exhibition halls and storage rooms being filled to their utmost ca-
pacity, it has become necessary to cease to a large degree the cus-
tomary efforts for the increase of the collections.

In order that the tabulated results here presented may not be mis-
leading, it is proper to repeat what has elsewhere been alluded to,
namely, that the classification of some of the largest collections, such as

ri

the ethnological collection, had not been made in 1882, and that there-
fore no figures appear under the head of ethnology for that year or for
1883, although the ethnological collection was at that time probably

half as large as it is now.

Some of the other collections had not been

classified, and thus an increase in the collections more apparent than
real appears to have taken place in 1885-86.

8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

MUSEUM CATALOGUES.*

The following exhaustive account of the manuscript catalogues of
the Museum has been prepared by Mr. Randolph IJ. Geare:

The catalogue system of the Museum was devised and commencea
in April, 1839, by Professor Baird, at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, while en-
gaged in work upon bis private collection of birds. The book in which
the specimens in this collection were recorded is now Vol. I of the Bird
Catalogue, and is in the custody of Mr. Ridgway, Curator of Birds.

When Professor Baird became Assistant Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution in 1850, he brought with him and presented to the Na-
tional Museum his private collection of birds, and a large general nat-
ural history collection, filling an entire baggage car. The bird collection
was catalogued between 1839 and 1848.

- After Professor Baird accepted the position of Assistant Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution, his system of cataloguing was adopted
for the Government collections.

When the cataloguing of the Museum specimens was commenced, it
was found more convenient to keep the records of the several collec-
tions in one book. For many years allobjects other than specimens of
- natural history were entered in the ‘‘ Ethnology ” series. Vol. xt of this
series is the first that was set apart for the entry of material of a
specified character, and in it are recorded materia medica specimens.
Musical instruments, fishery implements, foods, textiles, and other
classes of specimens are also included in this volume. A catalogue for
mineral and metallurgical specimens was opened in 1859, for fossils in
1859, for vertebrate specimens in 1840, for birds in 1839, for mammals
in 1852, for mollusks in 1859. This early system of cataloguing was,
although not entirely satisfactory, under the circumstances necessary ;
but during later years every special collection has been provided with its
own catalogue book, and in some instances the curators have found it con-
venient to assign a different book to the several groups of objects un-
der their custody. The total number of catalogue books in the Museum,
entirely or partly filled, is 151, as shown in the following enumeration:

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 9

The history of the system of cataloguing in tbe various departments
is given in the following detailed statement :

CATALOGUES OF THE DEPARTMENTS IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.
ETHNOLOGICAL SERIES.

This series contains thirty-one volumes, with 150,400 entry spaces.
The earlier volumes were devoted to the entry of all objects accruing
to the Museum other than objects of natural history.

From time to time separate volumes or portions of volumes have
been set apart for the entry of material of a specified character.

Vol. I, Nos. 1 to 3500.—The first material entered bears date of
March 9, 1859, and is a collection of Japanese ethnological objects, pre-
sented by the Emperor of Japan, through Commodore Perry.

The last entry is dated February 4, 1867.*

Vol. II, Nos. 3501 to 8300.—This volume covers the period between
February, 1867, and February, 1869. Many of its pages are devoted
to the entry of material gathered by the Wilkes Exploring Expedition.
The entries have not been carried beyond 8277, from 8278 to 8300,
both inclusive, having been left for some reason blank.*

Vol. ITI, Nos. 8301 to 14100.—This volume covers the period be-
tween February, 1869, and June, 1874.*

October, 1875—a year prior to the last entry in Vol. V, and the vol-
ume was completed a year subsequent to the opening of Vol. VII, the
next of this series. This volume was probably set apart for the use of
some collector in the field.*

Vol. VII, Nos. 29701 to 34600.—This volume covers the period be-
tween September, 1876, and January, 1879.*

this series. Much material already entered in the earlier volumes of
this series has been re-entered in the later volumes. In the Depart-
ment of Metallurgy-and Economic Geology an endeavor seems to
have been made to enter all material of a like nature in separate cata-
logues ; thus, in the year 1889 three catalogues (Vols. XI, X1I, and XIV)
were in use in this department. All of these books are as yet unfilled.

MOLLUSK SURIES
\ In the Report of the National Museum for 1885* Mr. W. H. Dall,
- Curator of the Department of Mollusks, presents a statement of she
_ registration of specimens from 1859 to 1885, from which it appears
that'42,440 entries had been made. During the fiscal year ending June
30, 1886, 18,638 entries were made. In the next fiscal year 10,530
entries were PS gine, the latest being No. 83534, in Vol. xvilt. On

18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

June 30, 1888, the catalogues show that 11,799 entries had been made, the
last one being No. 98677, in Vol. xx1. From Mr. Dall’s report for 1889
it appears that 6,523 entries had been made during the fiscal year end-
ing June 30, 1889, the last number taken up being 102074, in Vol. Xxt.
Entries were also made during the same year in Vols. XVIII and Xx.
During the six months ending December 31, 1889, 1,159 additional en-
tries had been made in Vol, XXII.

With a view to economy of time two other catalogue books are kept
for the use of assistants working in other offices of the department.
This series therefore comprises in all twenty-four volumes.

REPTILE AND BATRACHIAN SERIES.

Cataloguing in this department was commenced in 1856, This cata-
logue consists of four volumes.

Vol. 1, from 1 to 2900, covers the period between January, 1556, and
July, 1858.

Vol. 1, from 2901 to 7875, covers the period between July, 1850, and

Vol. Iv, is now in use. On January 20, 1890, the entries had been
carried as far as 15619—to the end of June, 1889, to 15525.

INSECT SERIES.

The Department of Insects has a special catalogue in which are
recorded all the additions to the collections since May 18,1883. A
single entry may include several hundred specimens. Up to the end
of June, 1889, 486 entries had been made. No attempt has been made
to affix catalogue numbers to the immense amount of material belong-
ing to the Department of Agriculture. The material has been classified
according to relationship, the several orders, families, genera, etc., be-
ing kept in separate trays. The force of this department is now en-
gaged in the preparation of a catalogue based on relationship, in which
will be indicated the number of examples of each species in the Museum
collection.

BOTANICAL SERIES.

As has already been stated in connection with Vol. x11 of the Eth-
nology series, Nos. 53926 to 54015 of that volume were taken up in
cataloguing (July, 1881) a collection of Japanese plants received from
the University of Tokyo. This is the first collection of plants entered
under a consecutive series of numbers.

RECENT PLANT SERIES.

In 1865 the Herbarium of the Smithsonian Institution, already of
great extent and value, which had for many years been under the care
of Dr. John Torrey in New York City, was placed under the care of
the Department of Agriculture, with the understanding that the
appointment of the Botanist of the Department of Agriculture (to be
charged with its administration) should be subject to the approval of
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Constant additions have
been made to the Herbarium since that time by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, and the collection has been also greatly increased through special
efforts made by the Botanist of the Department of Agriculture and his
assistants.
20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

In 1881, when Prof. Lester F. Ward took charge of the collection of
fossil plants in the Museum, he found that the separation of the fossil
plants from the recent plants caused him much inconvenience in con-
nection with the identification of the former. Since that time, there-
fore, it has been customary to retain in the Museum such accessions of
recent plants as were needed by Professor Ward and other students in
connection with their paleo-botanical work. A second collection of
recent plants has thus been formed in the Museum building. It became
evident that the existence of two herbaria, each a part of the National
Herbarium, and each entirely separate in administration from the other,
was undesirable. Dr. George Vasey, Botanist of the Department of
Agriculture, has therefore, at the request of the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, and with the consent of the Secretary of Ag-
riculture, accepted the position of Honorary Curator of the National
Herbarium. The Secretary of Agriculture has also agreed to the prop-
osition of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution that, as soon as
proper accommodation can be afforded to the National Herbarium in
one of the buildings of the National Museum, the portion of the Her-
barium now in the Department of Agriculture may be transferred and
combined with the collection now in the Museum building.

In Dr. Vasey’s report covering the remainder of the fiscal year (March
1 to June 30, 1889,) he states that no catalogue of the plants contained
in the Herbarium has yet been made, but that they are properly ar-
ranged in orders, genera, and species, and are labeled so as to be read-
ily accessible. ‘i

In March, 1889, the catalogue of recent plants received in the Na-
tional Museum, contained 175 entries. No idea, however, of the extent
of the collection can be formed by this statement, since the first two
entries comprised 25,000 specimens, these representing the Ward and
Joad collections. With the beginning of the fiscal year 1889-1890 a
new catalogue will be opened by Dr. Vasey for the entry of recent
plants.

FOSSIL PLANT SERIES.

The cataloguing of fossil plants was first systematically commenced
in the year 1881 (?) by Prof. Leo Lesquereux, of Columbus, Ohio.

Several entries of fossil plants are found in the early volumes of
the “ Fossil Series ” of catalogues.

There is an extra catalogue kept, in which is entered the material
that had accumulated in the interval between the time at which
Professor Lesquereux discontinued the work of cataloguing and the
period at which it was resumed by Mr. Knowlton. This catalogue is
only provisional, the specimens when identified being re-entered in the
regular catalogue of the department.

GRAPHIC ART SERIES.

The Section of Graphic Arts has a special catalogue, in which up to
January 7, 1890, 3,233 entries had been made.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 21

FOOD AND TEXTILE SERIES.

In the custody of this department are two volumes of a special cata-
logue. In these, special series of numbers have been set apart for the
various kinds of material placed in the department. The two volumes
contain about 9,900 numbers, about two-thirds of which have thus far
been utilized. It will be observed that a part of Vol. x11 of the Eth-
nology series (Nos. 54751 to 55550) is devoted to the entry of a collection
of foods and other specimens. This appears to have been the first set
of numbers devoted to the cataloguing of this material.

TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING SERIES,

To this section a special catalogue has been assigned. The first en-
try is dated March 10, 1885, and has reference to the locomotive “ John
Bull,” the gift of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Up to the end
of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1889, 125 entries had been made. In
this section the work of cataloguing has never been carried on system-
atically, owing to the pressure of other work.

LIVING ANIMAL SERIES.

This department has a special catalogue. The first entry is in Octo-
ber, 1887. On June 30, 1889, 341 entries had been made.

FORESTRY SERIES.

The cataloguing of specimens in the forestry collection has not yet
been commenced.

CATALOGUE ENTRIES DUEING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1889.

A catalogue entry, as explained in previous reports, may relate to a
single specimen or to several hundred or even several thousand speci-
mens, as frequently happens in regard to mollusks, plants, marine in-
vertebrates, fossil and other groups of objects. The total number of
entries made by the curators of the several departments in the Museum
catalogue books during the year is 23,442, as shown in the accompany-
ing table: .

ARRANGEMENT OF COLLECTIONS AND ASSIGNMENT OF SPACE.

The development of the collection of objects illustrating the graphic
arts has been so rapid that it has been found necessary to enlarge the
limits of the space assigned for its display. In 1888 one-half of the
northwest range was assigned to this collection. During the year it
has been found necessary to devote the entire range to the Section of
Graphic Arts, the casts of Mexican sculptures having been removed to
the Smithsonian building. The east side of the northwest range is de-
voted to the technical collection, and on the west side are shown the
methods of drawing and painting and the historical collection of relief
engravings, intaglio engravings, and lithographs. Mr. Koehler in his
report discusses at some length the need of additional space, in view
of the fact that the space now provided is not sufficient for the installa-
tion of the material already on hand.

Mr. J. EK. Watkins, Curator of Transportation and Engineering. has
re-arranged the collection under the following classes: (1) Objects
and implements for burthen-bearing by man and animals; (2) Objects
and implements of human and animal traction (street railway cars ex-
cepted); (3) Originals, models, and drawings of stationary steam-engines;
(4) Originals, models, and drawings of locomotives; (5) Models and
drawings of passenger-freight cars ; (6) Originals, models, and drawings
illustrating the development of the American rail and track; (7) Models,
relics, and drawings showing the beginnings of the steam-boats and

development of marine steam engineering; (8) Maps, showing the be
ginning and extension of the American railway system; (9) Electrical
machine ; (10) Air-ships, etc. In view of the progress which has been
made in solving problems that have arisen in connection with electric
propulsion, both on land and water, during the last few years, it would
seem proper to begin to collect objects illustrating the early history of
the devices which have gradually been developed into the motors, ete.,
now practically successful and in commercial use.

In February space was assigned to the Section of Oriental Antiqui-
ties on the north side of the west hall, and Dr. Cyrus Adler, Assistant
Curator, has commenced the installation of specimens.

In April a section devoted to forestry collections was organized. Dr.
B. E. Fernow, chief of the forestry division in the Department of Agri-
culture, has been appointed Honorary Curator. He has proposed the
following classification for the exhibition series of specimens :

(1) Relation of forestry to other industries and conditions of life;
(2) Description of the objects upon which forestry is to be applied, and
of the raw material; (3) Methods of utilization and application ; (4)
Methods of production and management; (5) Bibliography. A few
objects have already been placed on exhibition on a panel 12 feet by 14
feet. These are described in Dr. Fernow’s report. *

The materia medica collection is installed in the southeast range
of the Museum, and occupies a floor space of about 1,600 square feet.

The collection comprises the following exhibits :

(1) Medicinal forms; to illustrate the forms in which medicinal sub-
stances appear in commerce or are prepared for administration by the
pharmacist.

(2) Officinal drugs. The crude medicinal articles, and their deriva-
tives, authorized by the pharmacopceias, including non-official varieties
of official drugs; the whole arranged under the following heads:

Animal Products. Vegetable Produets. Organic Chemical Prod-
ucts. Inorganic Products. Mineral Waters and their constituents.
Indigenous, or Domestic Drugs. Medicines of the North American
Indians. Mexican Drugs. West Indian Drugs. South American
Drugs. East Indian Drugs. Chinese, Japanese, and Corean Medi-
cines.

In the Department of Ethnology has been organized a collection of
charts, maps, lay figures, busts, portraits, and photographs, designed
to illustrate the spread of various types of mankind. Professor Mason,
the Curator of this department, has also prepared an ethnographical
collection illustrating the arts and industries of the Koloshan, Haidan,
and Tsimshian stocks of Indians, based upon the report of Ensign A.
P. Niblack upon the Coast Indians of Alaska, published in the Museum
report for 1888. Mr. Walter Hough, of this department, has brought

24 ’ REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

together and arranged in the exhibition hall a series of the fire-making
tools of most of the American aborigines. The Curator has extended
his studies on the subject of human transportation.*

Mr. Thomas Wilson, Curator of Prehistoric Anthropology, has pro-
posed a re-arrangement of the exhibition hall on the second floor of the
Smithsonian building. His plans are set forth in his report.t

Mr. True, Curator ot Mammals, has continued the work of arranging
the hall under his charge. Groups of prairie dogs and opossums have
been thus treated during the year. Several special cases have been
constructed for this department. Some important changes in the ar-
rangement of the exhibition series have been effected. These are ex-
plained in detail in the report of the Curator.

The systematic arrangement of special bird exhibits has been accom-
plished by Mr. Robert Ridgway, Curator. These are described at length

in his report.t The arrangement of the collection of skins is considered’

by Mr. Ridgway to be exceedingly unsatisfactory, on account of the
lack of storage room. An apartment in the south tower has been as-
signed to this department.

Capt. Charles E. Bendire, Curator of Birds’ Eggs, has continued the
arrangement of the reserve series and also of the series of eggs of for-
eign birds.

A thorough re-arrangement of the entire collection of reptiles and
batrachians has been found necessary, and Dr. Leonhard Stejneger,
Curator, has already made a beginning with the reserve series of North

American species. Lack of proper accommodations necessarily ren-

ders any work of this kind slow and difficult.

The collection of fishes is very inadequately provided for. Dr. T. H.
Bean, Curator, states that it has become necessary to place the
jars containing the specimens on the floor, thereby putting them in

danger of being broken, and causing much extra labor and confusion. ©

Mr. William H. Dall, Curator of Mollusks, has arranged for exhibi-
tion the Lea collection of Unionidae, and he hopes to be able to com-
plete during the summer the arrangement of this magnificent collection
of fresh water mussels.

In the Department of Insects there has been unusual activity in the
arrangement and preparation of collections for exhibition. Work upon
a general exhibition collection to be permanently placed in the Museum
has been earried on. An additional laboratory has been completed for
the use of this department by the construction of a room over the Pub-

lic Comfort room. The arrangement of the reserve collection is pro-—

gressing. The re-arrangement of the Coleoptera has been continued,
and the family Carabidie has been entirely re-arranged, occupying sixty-
eight boxes in the reserve collection and eighteen double boxes in the
duplicate series.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 7 25

Mr. Richard Rathbun, Curator of Marine Invertebrates, has care.
fully examined the alcoholic collection, and has arranged in systematic
order the crustaceans, worms, holothurians, ophiurans, crinoids, hy-
drvids, molluseoids, and sponges. It is his intention to bestow the
Same care upon the other groups during next year. He has also found
time to revise the collection of duplicate specimens. Mr. Rathbun re-
ports the entire collection to be in an excellent state of preservation,
and available for reference or study.

Definite plans for the formation of an exhibition series of anatomical
preparations of soft parts of specimens have been prepared by Mr. True,
Acting Curator of Comparative Anatomy. It has, however, been
found necessary to postpone the execution of this plan until next year.
The large wall case in the exhibition hall of this department has been
enlarged by the addition of a wing extending toward the west. This
has made possible an improvement in the arrangement of the mounted
skeletons of Primates and Carnivores. The arrangement of the collec-
tion of Vertebrate Fossils has occupied a considerable portion of the
time of the Curator and of Mr. Lucas, Assistant Curator.

Mr. C. D. Walcott, Curator of Paleozoic Fossils, has, on account of
his work as paleontologist of the Geological Survey, been unable to
devote much time to the arrangement of the Museum collection. The
space allotted to the exhibition series of this department is now nearly
filled. The arrangement is, however, in a large measure provisional,
and will require modification. Mr. R. R. Gurley has commenced the
arrangement of the graptolites. Itis Mr. Walcott’s intention to arrange
as soon as possible the large series of Lower and Middle Cambrian
fossils which he has collected from Newfoundland.

Dr. C. A. White, Curator of Mesozoic Fossils, states that the collec-
tions under his care are in better shape than they have ever been be-
fore. Early in the year 1889 this department was furnished with ten
glass top frames. These are now filled with specimens consisting
chiefly of types of species, descriptions of which have been published in
the reports of the U. S. Geological Survey.

The Herbarium is under the care of Dr. George Vasey, Botanist
of the Department of Agriculture. He states in his report that the
collection of herbarium specimens in the Department of Agriculture,
forming a part of the National Herbarium, is exhibited in wall cases,
occupying a space of about 85 running feet. This collection is mounted
on 120,000 sheets. These are arranged according to orders, genera,
and species, and are readily aceessible. There are still a large quantity
of specimens to be mounted and added to the collection, besides a great
number of duplicates for distribution and exchange.

The collection of building and ornamental stones, as now installed,
fills thirteen door screen cases, one wall case, two pyramids, and the
tops of three table cases. The collections of rock and rock-forming
minerals are arranged on one pier case and seven slope-top table-cases.
26 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

The systematic arrangement of the collections of dynamic and historical
geology has not yet been commenced, owing to the lack of cases.

The entire southwest court is now reserved for the exhibition series
of metals and ores. The space is still insufficient for the proper exhi-
bition of the collection, and it has been found necessary to withdraw
fully one-third of the specimens intended for exhibition, and divide them
between the reserve and duplicate series.

The wooden structure adjoining the Smithsonian building on the
south has become so overcrowded with specimens of living animals that
numerous offers of additional specimens have necessarily been declined.

A room for tropical reptiles, quadrupeds, and other animals has been
added.

The establishment of a National Zoological Park has been authorized
by Congress, and the specimens now exhibited in this wooden shed will
doubtless be removed to the park as soon as the necessary arrange-
ments for their reception shall have been completed.

During the month of May the general storage room was removed
from the Armory building, to make room for the offices of the U.S.
Fish Commission, to the storage shed, west of the Armory building,
and the storage separated into three sections.

with the consent of the Secretary of Agriculture, Dr. B. E. Fernow,
chief of the Forestry Division of the Department of Agriculture has
been appointed curator of the collection.
28 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

On April 5 Mr. L. O. Howard, of the Entomological Division of the
Department of Agriculture, was appointed Acting Curator of insects
during the absence of Professor Riley, Honorary Curator, in Europe.

On April 21 Mr. F. H. Knowlton, Assistant Curator of fossil plants,
was furloughed for one year without pay, in order to enable him to
prosecute some special botanical work, and to serve upon the editorial
staff of the Century Dictionary. Mr. Knowlton has, however, kindly
offered to continue assisting in the care of the collections until an

appointment has been made.

Dr. H. ©. Yarrow, who for many years has served as Honorary >

Carator of the Department of Reptiles, resigned on February 9, and
Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, Assistant Curator of birds, was on March 1
appointed Curator of the Department of Reptiles.

Dr. George Vasey, botanist of the Department of Agriculture, was
appointed honorary Curator of botany in March, and in that capacity
controls the botanical collections in the National Museum and in the
Department of Agriculture forming the National Herbarium. Prof.
Paul Haupt, Honorary Curator of the Section of Oriental Antiquities,
has been designated representative of the Smithsonian Institution at
the Eighth International Congress of Orientalists, to meet in Stockholm
and Christiania from September 2 to 13. Prof. Otis T. Mason has been
detailed to visit the principal ethnological museums in France, Ger-
many, Denmark, and England for the purpose of making arrangements
for exchange of specimens and incidentally of studying the methods of
installation adopted in them. Mr. Thomas Wilson will also visit the
principal archeological museums in France for similar purposes, and
will attend the meetings of the International Anthropological Congress.

Mr. J. B. Smith, Assistant Curator of the Department of Insects,
resigned in April to accept a professorship in Rutger’s College, New
Brunswick, New Jersey, and the position of entomologist of the State
Agricultural Experiment Station, and Mr. Martin Linell has been
appointed aid in this Department.

THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF.

The administrative affairs of the Museum are under the direct charge
of the Assistant Secretary. The arrangement of the administrative of-
fices is as follows:

Department of accounts, W. V. Cox, chief clerk.

Department of correspondence and reports, R. I. Geare, executive clerk.
Department of registry and storage, 8S. C. Brown, registrar.

Department of property and supplies, J. Elfreth Watkins, engineer of property.
Department of publications, A. Howard Clark, editor of Proceedings and Bulletin.

The care of the buildings, the supervision of the mechanics, watchmen, laborers,
and cleaners, and many related matters, are under the charge of Mr. Henry Horan,
superintendent of buildings. Mr. C. A. Steuart is assistant superintendent.

The preparation and mounting of specimens for the exhibition series consumes the
time of several skilled employés. Casts of specimens have often to be made, when

—_—e Te ee

the original objects can not be retained in the Museum. Protograpbs of objects not
infrequently supply the place of the object itself in the exhibition cases. The work
incidental to such preparation is now of great importance and a department or prep-
aration has been formed as here indicated :

Department of preparation: Taxidermists, W. T. Hornaday in charge, Joseph Pal-
mer, William Palmer, Henry Marshall, George Marshall, A. J. Forney. Osteologist,
F. A. Lucas. Photographer, T. W. Smillie. Draughtsmen, W. H. Chandlee and W.
H. Burger. Modeler, J. W. Hendley. General preparators, E. H, Hawley and T. W.
Sweeny.

Statements of the work accomplished in these departments during the
‘year are given further on ip this report.

CLASSIFID SERVICE OF THE MUSEUM.

In response to a resolution* of the Senate asking for a schedule of the
classified service of the officers and employes of the National Museum,
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution addressed the following
letter to the Hon. John J. Ingalls, president pro tempore of the Senate,
transmitting a schedule which, upon very careful consideration, seemed
to represent the actual needs of the service.

*U. 8S. SENATE, October 9, 1888.

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

* * *

Mr. WILsoN, of Iowa. Loffer the following resolution, and ask for its present consid-
eration:

Resolved, That the Regents and Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and Di-
rector of the United States National Museum be, and hereby are, directed to formulate
and transmit to the Senate at their earliest convenience, a schedule of classified sery-
ice of the officers and employés of the National Museum, arranged according to duty
and salary, as the same is required for the proper working of the Museum.

Mr. Hoar. From what committee does that come ?

Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. From none. It is a resolution that I introduced in order to
get the information,

Mr. Hoar. I should like to inquire for information—I have no doubt it is all right
—have we authority to impose directions on the Regents of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and the Director of the National Museum?

Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. The resolution relates mainly to the National Museum, which,
I suppose, we have a right to call upon for information. It might be different as to
the Smithsonian Institution, but as the resolution relates to the Museum, I presume
we have that authority. There is no reason why we should not have it.

Mr. Hoar. We have authority to give such directions to the heads of Departments,
which rests on unbroken usage from the beginning of the Government, but I am not
aware that one House of Congress has aright to order an executive officer of the Goy-
ernment to do anything for its convenience, especially that we have such control over
the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution. It may be there is such authority re-
served by statute. I shall not interpose an objection to the resolution, because I know
personally the officers referred to would be anxious to communicate the information,
and it is the desire of the Senator from Iowa,

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. If there be no objection to the present consideration
of the resolution, the question is on agreeing to the same.

The resolution was agreed to.
30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
March 2, 1889.

Sie: In response to the Senate resolution asking for *‘ a schedule of
the classified service of the officers and employés of the National Mu-
seum,” I have the honor to transmit the accompanying schedule, which
represents the present actual necessities of the service.

The service for the fiscal year of 188788 was reported upon in a let-
ter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, dated December 1,
1888 (H. R. Mis. Doe. No. 55, Fiftieth Congress, second session).

In this the aggregate expenditures for service were shown to have
been $122,750.47, of which sum $97,493.32 was paid from the appro-
priation for preservation of collections, $19,203.79 from that for furni-
ture and fixtures, and $6,053.36 fiom that for heating, lighting, and
electrical and telephonic service.

A schedule of the number of persons employed in the various depart-
ments of the Museum was also given in this letter (pages 4, 9, 11).
This schedule should, however, be regarded only as an approximate
one, since many of the employés were actually engaged only a part of
the year, and others were temporarily transferred to the pay-rolls of
the Cincinnati Exhibition and were engaged in special work in connee-
tion with that exhibition.

It is estimated that the aggregate expenditures for services for the
present fiscal year (1885—89) will be $129,710, of which amount $103,000
will be paid from the appropriation for preservation of collections,

20,000 from that for furniture and fixtures, and $5,710 from that for
heating, lighting, and electrical and telephone service.

In the schedule herewith transmitted it is shown that for the proper
working of the Museum the amount required for services would be as
follows:

The increase in the total expenditure, as indicated, is due partly to
the addition of a number of officers to the scientific staff, and also to
the necessity for a few additional clerks, and a considerable number of

yatchmen, laborers, cleaners, and messengers, whose services are essen-
tial to the safety of the collections, as well as to provide for the clean-
liness and proper care of the buildings and for the comfort of visitors.

The rates of pay indicated are in most cases considerably lower than
are customarily allowed for a similar service in the Executive Depart-
ments.

In the schedule now presented, expenditure for services only is taken
into consideration.

No attempt has been made to present the needs of the Museum in
regard to the purchase or collecting of specimens, the purchase of gen-
eral supplies, preservatives, materials for mounting and installing col-
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ol

lections, books, exhibition cases, furniture, fuel and gas, the main-
tenance of the heating and lighting appliances, freight and cartage,
traveling expenses of collectors and agents, ete.

or these various purposes the expenditure in the last fiscal year
amounted to $45,249.53, and that for the present fiscal year will, it is
estimated, amount to about $48,000, a sum very inadequate to the needs
of the service.

It does not include the expenditures for printing the labels and blanks,
and proceedings and bulletins of the Museum, for which the appropri-
ation for many years past has been $10,000, and for which I have asked
$15,000 for the coming fiscal year.

I must not omit to call your attention to the fact that owing to the
peculiar constitution of the Museum as a scientific establishment, it has
hitherto been possible to secure a special economy, owing to the fact
that its officers and employés are not scheduled as in the Executive De-
partments.

In thus presenting, in obedience to the request of the Senate, a
schedule of a durable organization of the service, I wish to remark,
emphatically, that there are pressing needs in other directions—needs
that merit the serious consideration of Congress, in order that the
National Museum may be enabled to maintain a satisfactory position in
comparison with those of European nations.

I have the honor to be, your most obedient servant,
Ss. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
Hon. JOHN J. INGALLS,
President pro tempore of the Senate.

The rapid growth of the Museum renders a more definite classification
of its employés and in some instances larger salaries desirable, and it is
hoped that this schedule, or one similar in its general features, will be
ultimately accepted by Congress. There are, however, so many other
considerations for which money is needed, as for instance the purchase
of specimens, that it seems doubtful whether it is wise to bring this
matter yet to a final issue.

34 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

BE.—REVIEW OF WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENTS.

Department of Ethnology.—Prot. O. T. Mason, Curator, mentions in
his report nine collections, received during the year, as being of more
than usual value. He has paid much attention during the year to the
formation of several special exhibits, by which it is intended to bring
before the eye of the visitor at a glance the entire collection from a defi-
nite locality, or to explain, within as limited a range as possible, a
given art or industry of a particular tribe of Indians. This plan is in
continuation of the method of installation of the Eskimo collection by
Lieut. T. Dix Bolles in 1886. The subjects of fire making, heating, and
lighting have been carefully studied by Mr. Walter Hough.

Special attention has also been paid to the study of transportation on
the backs of men and women, to aboriginal hide dressing, to aboriginal
cradles, and to the evolution of common tools, the knife, the hammer,
the saw, ete. To interest the boys who visit the Museum a series of
‘‘iack-knives” has been arranged for public inspection, and the interest
which such a case excites is shown by the gifts made constantly to the
series.

In the latter part of the year the Curator commenced to collect for
public reference a card catalogue of the resources of anthropology, to
serve as a reference to the resources of the science, so that a special
student, a lecturer, or a college professor can be put at once into com-
munication with the chief sources of information.

Several exchanges of specimens have been effected during the year
with other museums, notably the Peabody Museum at Cambridge, The
Cincinnati Art Museum, and with Dr. Gosse, of Geneva, Switzerland,
with the Royal Ethnological Museum in Berlin, and with Mr. Edward
Lovett, of Croydon, England. The accessions of the year in this depart-
ment were from sixty localities, and eight hundred and sixty specimens
were received. The catalogue entries during the year were seven hun-
dred and twenty-one in number.

Section of Oriental Antiquities—Dr. Cyrus Adler, Assistant Curator,
has devised an excellent plan for making copies of the smaller Assyro-
Babylonian objects preserved in this country. These consist, for the
most part, of seals, and are of much importance in the study of the his-
tory of Assyro-Babylonian religion and art. The primary object of the
establishment of this section in the Museum was to collect copies of
these seals and specimens of similar import. The history, archeology,
languages, arts and religions of the peoples of Western Asia and Heypt
are included in the scope of the section.

In common with several other departments in the Museum, this sec-
tion was called upon to prepare an exhibit for the Cincinnati Exhibi-
tion. ‘This work occupied several weeks, and a report upon the exhibit
has been prepared by Dr. Adler and will be published in a future re-
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 35

port... Prof. Paul Haupt, Honorary Curator, has secured from the
Royal Museum of Berlin and the British Museum several valuable
casts of Assyrian and Egyptian objects. Labels have been prepared
for the Assyro-Babylonian seals, and also for the Assyrian photographs
from the British Museum, the Bonfils photographs, and the Assyrian
and Egyptian objects from the Royal Museum of Berlin. . Dr. C. John-

"son, jr., of the Johns Hopkins University, has made an examination of
an interesting Persian astrolabe, and has presented a paper entitled
“The Chaldean Astronomy.”

it may not be improper in this connection, to call attention to the
proposed edition of the “ Life and Writings of Edward Hincks,” by the
Semitie Seminary of the Johns Hopkins University. In July the Smith-
sonian Institution consented to make the Institution a depository for
papers and manuscripts sent to this country to further the prosecution
of the work. Prof. F. Max Miiller, of the University of Oxford, under
date of September 27, forwarded manuscript letters of Dr. Hineks in
his possession; and under date of October 20 he kindly offered to per-
manently deposit these letters in the Smithsonian Institution.

Section of Transportation and Engineering.—W ork in this section has
been. seriously interrupted by the necessarf absence of the Curator,
Mr. J. E. Watkins, at the Cincinnati Exposition, where a collection of
objects was exhibited illustrating the development of the various
systems of transportation. The exhibit was arranged in seven series,
and is fully described in a special paper prepared by Mr. Watkins for
publication in a future report.

- Among the important accessions during the year may be specially
noticed the following objects: A. Japanese kago (or palanquin), ob-
tained through Mr. Hieromich Shugio, made of wood, beautifully lac-
quered and elaborately ornamented ; and a model of a Japanese jin-
rikisha. Several interesting relics have been received, as, for instance,
the bell of the locomotive “ Rahway,” cast in 1838, and a section of the
first heavy iron rail rolled in America, presented to the Museum by the
Baltimore and Ohio Railway Company. A number of valuable draw-
ings, illustrating the development of marine steam engineering, have
been added to the collection.

A re-arrangement of the exhibition series has been commenced, and
is described in detail in the report of the Curator.

Section of Graphic Arts.—Mr. 8S, R. Koehler, Curator, states in his re-
port that his special aim is ‘‘to represent art as an industry.” This may
perhaps be more intelligibly rendered by the statement that art pro-
ductions of all kinds, considered primarily from their technical side, are
included in the scope of this section. The Section of Graphic Arts was
organized in January, 1887, and, no report having yet been submitted
by the Curator, the one now published in Section 11 of this report relates
to the work accomplished since that date. The contributors of material
to this collection number one hundred and six, some of whom had been
36 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

invited to assist the Curator in the preparation of a special exhibit for
the Cincinnati Exposition. The catalogue of this section now contains
2,894 entries, of which 294 represent objects which were purchased for
the collection, chiefly old prints, and such other material as could not
be obtained by gift. On March 31, 1888, there had been made 936
entries in the catalogue. At this time the first arrangement of the
collection in the Museum had just been completed.

The thanks of the National Museum are due esecially to Mr. Peter
Moran, Messrs. L. Prang & Co., the Photo-Engraving Company, W. H.
Whitcomb & Co., Mr. John Durand, and Mrs. Ednah D, Cheney for
their generous co-operation and contributions.

Mr. Koehler has prepared a catalogue of the collection prepared for
exhibition at the Cincinnati Exposition. A full list of the names of all
who have contributed to the collection since this section was organized
may be found in the report of the Curator.*

Department of Prehistoric Anthropology—The number of specimens
added to the collection during the year has been 6,972, making a total
number of 116,472 specimens in the collection. Mr. Thomas Wilson,
Curator, states in his report that a great deal of his time has been con-
sumed in examining and reporting upon objects sent for determination.
The work of classifying and placing upon exhibition the specimens
which were assigned to the exhibition series, has been rapidly pushed
forward. <A re-arrangement of the anthropological collection, which is
still exhibited in the large hall on the second floor of the Smithsonian
building, has been commenced, and Mr. Wilson’s plan of re-arrangement
is given in detail in his report.*

Fourteen of the collections received during the year have been con-
sidered by Mr. Wilson sufficiently valuable to receive special notice.
The contributions of the U.S. Fish Commission from Patagonia, Straits
of Magellan, Lower California, and California, have been numerous and
of great importance. These collections were made by the steamer Al-
baross during the voyage from Virginia to California in 1837-1888.

Mr. Wilson has continued his researches in regard to the existence
of paleolithic implements in the United States. There have been 14,000
entries made in the catalogue of the department. A special exhibit,
intended to indicate the existence and geographic distribution of pre-
historic man, as shown by the implements and objects which he manu-
factured and used, was prepared by the Curator for the Cincinnati
Exposition. This exhibit is described by Mr. Wilson in a paper which
will be published in a future report.

Section of Aboriginal Pottery.—Among the more important additions to
this section may be mentioned a collection of pottery from a mound near
Lake Apopka, Florida, made by Dr. Featherstonehaugh, and a collection
from a mound near Perdido Bay, Alabama, made by Mr. F. H. Parsons.

* See Section I,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 3

Mr. William H. Holmes, Honorary Curator, regards the latter col-
lection as one of the most important yet received from the Gulf coast.
Mr. Holmes has found time to make a study of the pottery of the
Potomac tide-water region during the year, and has prepared a paper
upon this subject, which will appear in the ‘American Anthropologist.”

The number of specimens added to the collection during the year is
1,100, necessitating 634 entries in the catalogue.

The Forestry Collection.—This section was established in April, 1889.
Dr. B. E. Fernow, chief of the Forestry Division in the Department of
Agriculture, has been appointed Honorary Curator. It has not been
possible to accomplish very much during the three months of the
existence of this section before the close of the fiscal year, but Dr. Fer-
now has submitted a report,* in which he gives a brief outline of the
scope of the collection which he hopes to make, and of the manner in
which it may best be classified. A series of pictures illustrating the
work of the French Forest Administration, and other objects, have
already been placed on exhibition on a panel 14 by 12 feet. The Secre-
tary of Agriculture has expressed his interest in the formation of this
collection, and the Smithsonian Institution is greatly indebted to him
for his co-operation in this branch of the Museum work.

Department of Mammals.—Special attention has been given in this
department to providing better storage facilities for the study series
of specimens, which has been largely increased by the collection of
North American mammals deposited in the Museum by the Division
of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy in the Department of Agri-
culture. Groups of prairie-dogs and opossums have been mounted for
exhibition and placed in new cases of special design.

The following contributors are mentioned in Mr. True’s report as
having presented material of especial value to the collection: Mr.
William Wittfield, who presented two specimens of the Florida musk-
rat, Neofiber alleni; Mr. Loren W. Green, from whom was received a
series of skins of the northern variety of Tamias striatus; Dr. R. W.
Shufeldt, who presented 4 specimen of Hesperomys truei; Mr. James G.
Swan, from whom was received a specimen of Vespertilio longicrus.
Dr. Arthur Edwin Brown, of the Zoological Society of Philadelphia,
contributed a small deer, probably of the species Cariacus gymnotus.
The skin of a full-grown moose was obtained by Col. Cecil Clay for the
Museum. Several exotic mammals were also secured by gift and pur-
chase. Capt. J. L. Gaskell, keeper of the life-saving station at
Atlantic City, forwarded to the Museum a specimen of Sowerby’s
whale, Mesoplodon bidens. Mr. True states in his report that this is the
second specimen ever taken in American waters, and is the first fresh
specimen ever seen by American naturalists. A few South American
mammals were obtained by the naturalists of the U.S. Fish Commis-
sion steamer Albatross. The most important were the skeleton of a

en

38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

porpoise, Prodelphinus longirostris, obtained between Panama and the
Galapagos Islands, and several skins of the sea-lions inhabiting those
islands. During the year there were added to the collection of skins
192 specimens, and to the alcoholic series 35 specimens. . The catalogue
of the department has been increased by 633 entries.

A series representing all the existing families of mammals was pre-
pared for exhibition at the Cincinnati Exposition, and a descriptive
guide to the collection has been prepared for publication.

Department of Birds.—Mr. Robert Ridgway, Curator of this depart- |
ment, states in his report that the re-arrangement, labeling, and gen-
eral improvement of the exhibition series has been actively contin-
ued. Nine special exhibits of birds and eggs have been completed. —A
considerable portion of the time of the Curator has been devoted to
committee work in connection with the revision of the check-list of the
American Ornithologist’s Union. Special investigations have also been
made by the Curator, on the genera Psittacula, Accipiter, Xiphocolaptes,
and Sclerurus. A large collection from Costa Rica has been studied,
and also the extensive collection made by the naturalists of the Fish
Commission steamer Albatross in Alaska and in various portions of.
South America. Dr. Leonhard Stejneger has continued his work on
Japanese ornithology.

Dr. J. A. Allen, of New York City, Dr. P. L. Sclater and Mr. Osbert
Salvin, of Londbh, England, Count von Berlepsch, of Miinden, Ger-
many, and several other active workers, have received material from the
Museum to aid them in their studies of particular groups of American
birds.

In March Dr. Stejneger severed his relations with this department,
having been appointed Curator of the Department of Reptiles and Ba-
trachians. .

The accessions of the year number 1,490 specimens, of whivh 996 have
been placed in the reserve series, 147 assigned to the duplicate series,
while 347 specimens have been added to the exhibition collection.
There are now 6,714 specimens on exhibition. Mr. Ridgway has made
special mention in his report of 47 of the more important accessions
received during the year.

Section of Birds’ Eggs.—Capt. Charles HE. Bendire, U.S. A., Hon.
Cvrator, has continued the classification and arrangement of the new
material, and has made considerable progress in re-labeling the reserve
series of eggs in accordance with the revised check-list of the American
Ornithologist’s Union. He has also arranged a series of foreign eggs, of
which there are now 4,913 specimens. Six collections of more than usual
value have been received during the year. There are now more than
50,000 specimens in the collection. In the catalogue book 118 entries
have been made.

Department of Reptiles and Batrachians.—Dr. H. ©. Yarrow, U.S.
A., who for several years has been in charge of this department,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 39

having resigned, Dr. Leonhard Stejneger was in March appointed Cura-
tor of the department. He has commenced making a complete exami-
nation of the entire collection, and reports that at the close of the fiscal
year he was still at work on the reserve series of North American spe-
cies. The cataloguing of the new material and of specimens previously
received but not catalogued, has been continued. The most important
accession during the year was the collection made by the naturalists of
the U.S. Fish Commission Steamer Albatross. It contains three hun-
dred and nineteen specimens, which have been sent to Prof. . D. Cope,
of Philadelphia, for special report. Four other accessions are mentioned
in the Curator’s report as of especial interest.

The types of eight species have been identified and re-labeled. Dur-
ing the year Professor Cope has finished his work on the North
American Batrachians, published as Bulletin 34 of the U.S. National
Museum, and has commenced a study of North American snakes. Dr.
G. Baur, of Yale College, has had for study a number of Chelonians,
and some of the results of his studies are referred to in the Bibliog-
raphy.*

Dr. Stejneger reports that the condition of the collection is good, but
that the re-numbering and re-labeling of specimens is constantly found
to be necessary. During the year 741 specimens have been added to
the collection, and 784 entries made in the catalogue. The excess of
the latter over the former is accounted for by the fact that some of the
material received before this fiscal year had not been catalogued.

The Curator has been unable to devote much time to scientific study
of the collection during the few months he has been in charge. What
little he has been able to do has been in connection with an investiga-
tion of the status of the boiform snakes of North America, with special
reference to individual variation.

Department of Fishes.—It has been necessary for Dr. Tarleton H.
Bean, Honorary Curator of this department, to spend the greater part
of the year on special work pertaining to the Fish Commission. Dr.
Bean has recently taken charge of the editorial work of the Fish Com-
mission, leaving very little time to be devoted to Museum matters.’ Dur-
ing his absence from the city Mr. Barton A. Bean, his assistant, was
left in charge of the department. The entire collection of fishes has
been overhauled and the jars supplied with fresh alcohol. In addition
to the large and valuable collections received from the U.S. Fish Com-
mission, several other important collections have been added to the col-
lection. Ten of these are especially referred to in the report of the Cu-
rator.

During the last six months of the year Dr. Bean prepared and had
published in various journals numerous papers upon the Salmonidw and
other species of fishes. A list of these papers is given in the Bibliog-
raphy.*

* See Section Iv.
40 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

The number of specimens received during the year was about 6,000,
and 1,476 catalogue entries have been made. There are now, according
to Dr. Bean’s report, about 30,000 specimens in the exhibition series,
60,000 specimens in the reserve series, and 25,000duplicates. The Cu-
rator calls attention in his report to the inadequacy of the case and
storage room provided for the collection, and states that it has on this
account become necessary to arrange the jars containing recent addi-
tions upon the floor.

Department of Mollusks.—The labeling, determining, and registration
of old and new material has occupied a large share of the time of Mr.
William H. Dall, Honorary Curator, and his assistants. Seven cases,
containing a part of the Lea collection of Unionidae, have been arranged
for exhibition. Much progress has been made in cleaning and assort-
ing the fossils. Considerable time has been devoted to the arrange-
ment of the collection representing the fauna of the southeastern shores
of the United States and adjacent waters. A check-list of this fauna
is now being printed. The collection contains about fifteen thousand
specimens. Dr. R. E. C. Stearns, Adjunct Curator, has devoted a por-
tion of his time to the land and fresh water shells, especially of North
America. He has also pushed forward the revision and labeling of old
material. The Curator has supplied information of various kinds to
forty-three correspondents, necessitating a large amount of labor and
correspondence.

Mr. Dall has found time to finish bis investigation of the Mollusca
obtained by the United States steamer Blake under the supervision of
Professor Agassiz in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and
has continued work on the dredgings obtained by the U.S. Fish Com-
mission in the same region, and also upon the collections obtained
last year by the U.S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross during its
voyage to California. He has also been occupied in anew systematic
arrangement of the bivalve shells, and has studied the correlation of
the tertiary fossils of the southeastern Atlantic coast with the recent
fauna. Dr. Stearns has prepared for publication a paper on prehistoric
shell money.

Next in importance to the accessions received from the Fish Commis-
sion during the year is a collection consisting of about five thousand
specimens of shells from all parts of the world. This was presented by
Messrs. F. B. and J. D. McGuire on behalf of the heirs of the late J. C.
McGuire, of Washington. A collection containing about three hundred
species was received from the Auckland Museum, New Zealand. Inter-
esting series of specimens have been received from Messrs. HE. W.
Webster and J. J. White. Small though valuable collections have
been presented by Mr. Henry Hemphill and Lieut. J. F. Moser, U.S.
Navy. Large collections of fossil shells have been received from the
U.S. Geological Survey, and of almost equal importance is the coliec-
tion from the fossiliferous deposits of Florida, presented by Mr. Joseph
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 41

Willcox. The entries in the catalogues of this department during the
year are 6,323 in number. About 13,000 specimens have been received,
giving a total of 468,000 specimens in the entire collection.

Department of Insects.—More time than in any previous year has been
devoted by Dr. C. V. Riley, Honorary Curator of this department, to the
preparation of collections for exhibition. A special series, designed
rather for educational use than for museum purposes, was prepared for
the Cincinnati Exposition. The installation of a permanent exhibition
series has been commenced in the southeast range. In April Mr. J. B.
Smith, Assistant Curator, resigned his position to accept a chair in
Rutgers College, New Brunswick. During the Curator’s absence, from
April to the close of the fiscal year, Mr. L. O. Howard, of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, took charge of the department, and the thanks
of the Museum are due to him for his energetic administration of its
affairs. Mr. Martin Linell has been appointed aid.

The work of naming specimens for collectors, the arrangement and
selcetion of material to be sent to specialists for determination, the ar-
rangement in permanent shape of the reserve series, and the preserva-
tion of the general collection, have received as much attention as op-
portunity would allow. =

Several researches of a special character upon Museum material have
been made during the year. These are nine in number, and are re-
ferred to in the report of the Curator.*

Twenty collections of more than ordinary interest have been received.
About 8,000 specimens have been added to the collections during the
year, and 78 catalogue entries have been made. The entire collection
now contains, as estimated, 603,000 specimens. :

Department of Marine Invertebrates.—Myr. Richard Rathbun, Honorary
Curator, has been unable to devote much of his time during the year to
the work of this department, owing to the pressing duties which have
been placed upon him in connection with the work of the U.S. Fish
Commission. The exhibition hall of this department, in the west end
of the Smithsonian building, has been repaired and repainted, and is
now open to visitors. The principal accessions have, as usual, been
obtained from the Fish Commission, although these have been far less
numerous than in any previous year, since the Fish Commission has
lately retained its collections of marine animals with a view to their
being studied and reported upon before being transferred to the Mu-
seum. for this reason probably not more than three hundred speci-
mens have been added tothe collection during the year. Interesting
collections have been received from Lieut. J. F. Moser, U.S. Navy;
Mr. Henry Hemphill; Dr. Lonis F. H. Birt, of the Nicaragua Canal
Construction Company; Mr. Romyn Hitchcock, who presented a small
collection of crustaceans and sponges from Japan, and from Mr, James
G. Swan, of Port Townsend, Washington.

42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

A collection of marine specimens was prepared and transmitted to the
Cincinnati Exposition. It consisted mainly of large specimens, and also
contained examples of fish food and many microscopical preparations.
Upon its return from Cincinnati the more interesting portions of the
exhibit were placed in the exhibition hall.

Mr. Rathbun has found it impracticable to devote very much time to
original research, but has given a limited amount of study to the Madre-
porarian corals, and particularly to those collected by the steamer Al-
batross in the Gulf of Mexico and on the voyage from Norfolk to San
Francisco.

Prof. A. E. Verrill and Prof. 8. I. Smith have continued their work
upon the invertebrate collections of the Fish Commission. Prof. Edwin
Linton is making a special study of internal parasites of fishes. <Ar-
rangements have been made with Prof. Walter Faxon to prepare a report
upon the crayfishes added to the department since 1885, and Mr. J.
Walter Fewkes has completed a paper on certain of the Medusz ob-
tained by the Fish Commission steamer Albatross in the region of the
Gulf Stream. Several of the groups of marine invertebrates obtained -
by the Albatross during its voyage around South America have been
assigned to specialists outside of Washington for study and report.

Nineteen sets of marine invertebrates have been distributed to schools
and colleges during the year. Each set contained about one hundred
and ten species, the greater part of which are preserved in alcohol.

Mr. Rathbun in his report briefly reviews the marine explorations of
the steamers Albatross and Fish Hawk and of the schooner Grampus.

The number of catalogue entries has been 3,214.

Department of Comparative Anatomy.—My. F.W. True, Acting Curator
of this department, reports that his activities have been principally
directed towards reducing the accumulations of osteological material.
A large number of skulls and skeletons have been cleaned and made
available for use. The skulls of about five hundred specimens of small
animals, deposited by the Department of Agriculture, have also been
prepared. Mr. F. A. Lucas, Assistant Curator, has been occupied in
the arrangement of the collection of vertebrate fossils, and in mount-
ing a cast of the skeleton of Dinoceras, received from the Yale College
Museum. Mr. Lucas also had charge of the preparation for shipment
of the collection of mammals for exhibition at the Cincinnati Expo-
sition.

The preparation of a card catalogue of alcoholic birds has been com-
menced, and is well advanced, and a large amount of work has been
done in classifying and caring for this valuable portion of the collec-
tion.

Some work has been done in the preparation of specimens of soft
anatomy and of the invertebrate material. The preparation and ar-
rangement of the vertebrate fossils have also received some attention.

The principal accessions during the year were of mammals and birds.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 43

No attempt has yet been made to acquire invertebrate specimens for
this department. The most important addition to the exhibition series
of skeletons was an Atlantic Right whale, Balena biscayensis. This °
was purchased from Prof. H. A. Ward, of Rochester, N. Y. A skele-
ton of Sowerby’s whale, Mesoplodon bidens, was prepared from the speci-
men obtained from Capt. J. L. Gaskell, keeper of the life-saving station
at Atlantic City. The U.S. Fish Commission furnished skins of dol-
phins, askeleton of the Fork-tailed gull, Creagus /wreatus, and a collee-
tion of birds and Elephant tortoises from the Galapagos Islands and the
Straits of Magellan. An alcoholic collection of typical New Zealand
birds was obtained from the Auckland Museum, and a similar ecollee-
tion of Australian birds was obtained from the Australian Museum at
Sydney. In all 195 specimens have been added to the collection dur-
ing the year, The number of catalogue entries during the same period
has been 1,054... The excess of this number over the total number of
specimens received is accounted for by the large amount of work ac.
complished upon accumulations of osteological material from past years.

Department of Paleozoic Fossils—By far the larger portion of the
accessions to this department has been obtained through the U.S.
Geological Survey. Mr. C. D. Walcott, Honorary Curator, has. con-
tributed to the Museum collections, through his official connection
with the Geological Survey, a large series of Lower Middle Cambrian
fossils from Newfoundland. He reports that. the Lower Cambrian
genera and species have been worked over and named, and that a large
quantity of new material has been added to the collection. | Krom
Newfoundland alone not less than 3,000 specimens have been transferred
to the Museum during the year. Mr. Walcott in his report makes
special mention of nine accessions. The material in the collection has
been increased during the year by the addition of 6,477 specimens. The
number of catalogue entries during the same period was 583.

Department of Mesozoic Fossils.—The official duties of Dr. C. A. Whits,
Honorary Curator, in connection with the Geological Survey, has pre-
vented him from devoting more than a small share of time te work upon
the Museum collection. A great deal has, however, been accomplished,
and the collection of Mesozoic Fossils is now in far better condition than
it has ever been before. Numerous type specimens of species which
have been published in various Government reports, have been installed
and are now on exhibition in the south-east court. ‘Che principal acces-
sions during the year have, as usual, been obtained through the U. 35.
Geological Survey. In addition, type specimens of twelve species of
cretaceous fossils were transmitted to the Museum by President D. 35.
Jordan, of Indiana State University. from the Fish Commission has
been received an interesting collection of cretaceous fossils from the
Straits of Magellan. Altogether, 311 specimens have been added to the
collection during the year, and 117 entries have been made in the cata-
logue.
44 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

Department of Botany.—Dr George Vasey, of the Department of Ag-
riculture, has been appointed Honorary Curator of this department, and
in that capacity has control of the collections both in the Department
of Agriculture and in the National Museum. A brief statement of the
early history of these collections, and of the resulting conditions which
led to this combination of the two collections, is given on pp. 19 and
20. By this union of interests in the development of the National Her-
barium, a great many good results will undoubtedly be effected.

There are already in the Department of Agriculture arranged on
shelves, in wall cases, occupying altogether a wall space of about 85
running feet, not less than 120,000 sheets of botanical specimens. The
general catalogue of the combined herbarium has not yet been made.

The Department of Agriculture has employed for a part of the year
three agents to collect botanical specimens and information respecting
the vegetation of little known regions. One of these agents has oper-
ated in western Texas, one in California (southern and lower), and one
in Washington. From these agents we have received a large quantity
of botanical specimens.

Among the additions to the herbarium received during the year
through the Smithsonian Institution, have been a collection of plants
from South America and Alaska, made by officers of the U.S. Fish
Commission steamer Albatross. Several packages containing plants
and pertified wood were collected by Lieut. Pond in Lower California
and the adjacent islands. A valuable collection of four hundred species
of Japanese plants has been received from the Tokyo Educational Mu-
seum. Five collections of duplicate specimens have been distributed
to foreign herbaria. The number of specimens received during the
year has been estimated at 459.

Fossil plants.x—Prof. Lester F. Ward, Honorary Curator, has been
able to devote but little time to the work of the department, owing to
the pressure of his duties as paleontologist of the Geological Survey,
but as far as his time permitted he has been engaged in the study of the
fossil plants of the Laramie group. He is preparing a monograph of the
flora of this group, and hopes to complete it before very long.

During the field season, between July and the latter part of October,
Prof. F. H. Knowlton, Assistant Curator, visited the Yellowstone Park,
where he made a collection of fossil plants and fossil woods which filled
twenty-one boxes. After his return to Washington the boxes were
opened, and the assortment of the collections was begun. Considera-
ble time was spent in the study of this material, as well as upcn the
material obtained during the previous season from the same region.

Professor Lesquereux, of Columbus, Ohio, has completed the identifi-
cation and elaboration of the large collection of fossil plants belonging
to the National Museum, and collected by Capt. Charles E. Bendire in
John Day Valley, Oregon. The material is very interesting, and con-
tains many new species.

i -
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 45

On account of the pressing nature of Professor Ward’s duties in con-
nection with the Geological Survey, he has not been able to prepare a
report for this year, and this brief statement is therefore submitted in
lieu of a formal report in Section II.

Department of Minerals.—The growth of the collection during the
year has, through the energetic administration of its Curator, Prof. I’.
W. Clarke, been very satisfactory. The two most important accessions
were received from the U. S. Geological Survey. These collections
were made by Prof. 8. F. Penfield and by Dr. W. F. Hillebrand, who
visited Colorado and the adjacent States and Territories for the purpose
of making mineralogical investigations and collections. <A series of
specimens of wood opal, collected by Dr. A. C. Peale in Montana, has
also been contributed by the Geological Survey. Professor Clarke in
his report* makes mention of eleven accessions as of especial interest.

It is to be deeply regretted that Mr. Joseph Willcox has found it
necessary to withdraw his collection of minerals from the Museum,
where it had been deposited for more than four years. Mr. Willcox
had oftered to sell this collection to the Museum for an exceedingly
modest sum, but this offer could not be entertained, the Museum having
no fund for the purchase of specimens, and thus the Museum has sus-
tained an irreparable loss.

A series of specimens, illustrating the gems and precious stones of
North America, was prepared for exhibition at the Cincinnati Exposi-
tion.

During the year 5,794 specimens were added to the collection, and
631 entries were made in the catalogue.

Department of Lithology and Physical Geology.—There has been un-
usual activity in the work of this department during the year. The
Curator, Mr. George P. Merrill, has visited certain localities in North
Carolina, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, and
Maine, for the purpose of collecting specimens. These expeditions have
resulted very advantageously to the Museum. Among the new mate-
rial received sixteen collections have been selected as worthy of special
mention in the report of the curator.*

One of the objects of the expeditions already alluded to was for the
purpose of collecting material for distribution to educational establish
ments. It has been quite impossible to fill the numerous applications for
lithological specimens from museums, colleges, and schools throughout
the country. Mr. Merrill has succeeded in obtaining a very large quan-
tity available for this purpose, and during the coming winter it is ex-
pected that a sufficient number of sets of specimens can be prepared to
fill the applications now on file. From material on hand at the begin-
ning of the year covered by this report, twenty-two sets of minerals
were prepared and distributed. The determination of material sent for
examination and report has occupied no inconsiderable portion of the

*See Section II,
46 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

Curators time. During the year twenty-five “lots” of material have
been forwarded for this purpose.

The collection of building and ornamental stones now fills thirteen
door-screen cases, one wall case, two large pyramids, and the tops of
three table cases. The collections of rocks and rock-forming minerals
are now as extensive as can be taken care of in the limited space at the
command of this department. These collections now comprise about
two thousand specimens. The collections of dynamic and historical
geology have received important additions during the year, but no at-
tempt has yet been made to arrange them systematically.. The total
number of specimens received during the year has been 4,500, and
1,135 entries have been made in the eatalogue.

Department of Metallurgy and Economic Geology.—The Curator, Mr, F.
P. Dewey, has devoted his time chiefly to the preparation and arrange-
ment of the exhibition material, which is now installed in the south-
west court.. During the year the Curator made a visit to Providence,
R. L., for the purpose of examining a collection of petroleum specimens
and related materials which had been prepared by Prof. S. F. Peckham
in connection with his work for the Tenth Census. This collection num-
bers three hundred and sixty specimens, and illustrates very fully the
occurrence of crude petroleum in this country. It is in the Museum,
and will be placed upon exhibition as soon as practicable. . Several
valuable collections of ores have been added to the collection during
the year, among which may be mentioned three series of foreign ores;
one from the Australian Museum at Sidney, one from the Auckland
Museum in New Zealand, and one forwarded by the Hon. Otto E. Rei-
mer, United States consul at Santiago de Cuba.

During the year the Curator has made an examination of the produc-
tion of pig-iron at the Muirkirk Furnace, near Washington, and nickel
from Russel Springs, Kansas. This was undertaken at the request of
the Hon. J. J. Ingalls.

The collection has been increased during the year by the addition of
664 specimens, and 413 catalogue entries have been made.

Department of Living Animals.—This department was organized in
May, 1888, and Mr. William T. Hornaday, who has recently been ap-
pointed Superintendent of the National Zoological Park, retains charge
of the collection. Owing to the limited space available for exhibiting
these specimens, consisting of a wooden shed adjoining the Smithsonian
building on the south, it has become necessary to decline several offers
of valuable contributions to the collection. Mr. Hornaday has prepared,
durivg the year, an exhaustive memoir relating to the discovery, life
history, and extermination of the American Bison. Owing to the delay
attending the printing of the Museum report, it was found possible
to include this paper in the report for 1887, proof of which is now being
received from the Printing Office. In order to emphasize the rapid ex-
termination of this and several other animals indigenous to the United
¥

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY, AT

States, a large collection of objects illustrating this subject was pre-
pared for the Cincinnati Exposition. Amongst the animals which have
become extinct were shown the buffalo, the Californian sea-elephant,
and the West Indian seal. In the series of species which are likely to
disappear very soon were the mountain sheep, mountain goat, elk, ante-
lopes, moose. caribou, black-tail deer, beaver, otter, sea-otter, walrus,
and grizzly bear. :

Among the most important accessions received during the year were
three specimens of the American elk. presented by the Hon. W. F.
Cody; a young Gray wolf, presented by Mr. C. A. Dole, of Glendiva,
Montana; a collection of living tortoises from the Galapagos Islands,
collected by the U.S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross; and four
Angora goats, received from Misses Grace and Maude Parsons. Of
especial interest is a young Rocky Mountain sheep, Ovis montana, for-
warded to the Museum by Mr. George Bird Grinnell, editor of ‘ Forest
and Stream.”

Special cages have been constructed on the reservation south of the
Smithsonian building for the grizzly bear, puma, and the eagles. A
buffalo-yard has also been completed on the same reservation, and from
it sections have been cut off to afford protection for the deer, mountain
sheep, and other animals.

In addition to Mr. Hornaday’s other duties he has retained the super-
vision of the taxidermic work of the Museum. There are now 491 speci-
mens in the collection of living animals, represented by 341 entries on
the catalogue of the department.

F.—REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK.

PROGRESS OF GENERAL AND INCIDENTAL WORK.

LIBRARY.

Mr. John Murdoch, librarian, has furnished the following state-
ment of the operations of the library during the year:

The total number of publications added to the library during the
year is 6,052 (648 volumes of more than 100 pages, 903 pamphlets, 4,343
parts of regular serials, and 158 charts). Of these, 441 volumes, 617
pamphlets, and 3,752 parts of serials were retained for the use of the
Museum from the accessions of the Smithsonian Institution.

The remainder were obtained as usual by gift, exchange, and pur-
chase.

The most important accession to the library during the year was the
gift of the heirs of the late Dr. Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, consisting of
137 volumes, 276 parts and 693 pamphlets, selected from his scientific

48 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

library, and comprising many works of the greatest value. Another
important accession is a nearly complete series of the ‘ Proceedings of
the Zoological Society of London.” This gift was received so late in
the fiscal year that it has been impossible to enter and catalogue the
books. When this can be done, most of them will be assigned to the
sectional library of Mollusks.

Apart from the regular exchanges, the following donations to the
library are also worthy of notice:

From Dr. Paul Haupt, Baltimore, 44 pamphlets on oriental subjects;
from Prof. P. H. Carpenter, Eton College, England, 19 pamphlets, sci-
entific papers by his distinguished father; from Mr. John Murdoch,
Washington, 18 volumes, 2 pamphiets; from Prof. Alpheus Hyatt,
Boston, 12 pamphlets.

During the year 7,583 books were borrowed from the library.

Ninety-four persons are now authorized under the regulations to
draw from the Museum library, and of these seventy-five are also au-
thorized to obtain books from the library of Congress through the Mu-
seum library. During the year 245 orders were sent to the library of
Congress.

The method of keeping the records of loans and returns of books, re-
ferred to in a previous report, has been used throughout the year with
complete satisfaction.

The card-catalogue by authors has been continued, and 1,442 titles
have been added to it during the year.

Through the kindness of the librarian of Congress, an order was ob-
tained for binding 300 volumes of the books belonging to the Smith-
sonian deposit in the Museum library. These books were therefore
sent to the Government bindery on June 20, 1889.

The work of covering and arranging the large collection of pamphlets
has been continued, whenever the pressure of routine work would allow.

No material change has been made in the force employed in the
library since the last report.

SECTIONAL LIBRARIES.

The regular inspection of the sectional libraries by the librarian
was begun May 22 and completed June 7. Since the last report, the
name of the section of archeology has been changed to Prehistoric
Anthropology, and a new sectional library, that of Oriental Archzol-
ogy, in charge of Dr. Cyrus Adler, Assistant Curator of the Section of
Oriental Antiquities, has been established. The Assistant Secretary
has commenced the organization of his sectional library, that of Admin-
istration.

The following is the result of the inspection:

TRANSPORTATION, STORAGE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF DUPLICATES.

The total number of boxes, packages, barrels, tanks, ete., received
during the year is 16,625, of which 2,182 contained specimens for the
Museum, the remainder being distributed to the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and the other persons addressed.

The registrar, Mr. 8. C. Brown, has continued to act as transportation
clerk for the Smithsonian Institution, and this has entailed a consider-
able addition to the routine work of his office.

During the fiscal year 261 packages were entered upon the storage
records, and 203 packages were removed from storage and turned over
to the curators for study, and to aid in making up sets for distribution.

Forty-eight boxes of duplicate and reserve material have been sent
to general storage, and 57 specimens were sent out in exchange.

Durivg the month of May the general storage room was removed
from the ‘Old Armory” building to the storage shed west of the Armory
building, and the storage separated into three sections.

First. General storage, which is now confined to the large shed
proper, and is used for the storage of Museum specimens only.

Second. The south track of what is known as the “car shed” has been
set aside for the accommodation of specimens collected by the U.S.
Geological Survey and Bureau of Ethnology. All such specimens are
entered in the Museum storage record, but are kept by themselves for
convenience in handling.

Third. A new shed, “8 by 18 feet, has been erected west of the old
one. The south end of it, 10 by 18 feet, is reserved for the department
of Lithology and Physical Geology, for the storage of its duplicate ma-
terial; the remainder of the new shed (78 by 18 feet) has been assigned
to the property division of the Museum, for the storage of cases, draw-
ers, ete.

The total number of packages sent out during the year is 2,552, of
which 1,302 contained Museum material, transmitted as gifts or loans,
or in exchange.

The Museum has continued to lend photographs of exhibition cases
to all who have made .formal application, and to send sample trays and
boxes and copies of labels to applicants.

The distribution of specimens for the year, from the several depart-
ments of the Museum, is shown in the appended table.

Duplicate sets* of marine objects have been sent out, as in the past,
in response to applications received from museums and educational in-
stitutions.

This number added to the total number of specimens sent out from
1854 to June 30, 1888, which was 564,090, gives the grand total of 575,472
specimens distributed by the Smithsonian Institution up to June 30,
1889.

In addition to the regular sets of duplicates five special collections
were also sent out.

Thirty-four applications for duplicate specimens other than marine
invertebrates have been received during the year and entered upon
the register. A majority of these have been favorably acted upon.

Mr. George P. Merrill has collected a large amount of material,
which, together with duplicate specimens in the Museum, will be cut
up and made into sets for distribution to educational establishments.
Prof. F. W. Clarke has for a similar purpose made large collections of
minerals. - ;

Kight hundred specimens of minerals were sent out to over twenty
establishments, and sixteen sets of duplicates were distributed to col-
leges and schools.

“Series iv. Each set in this series contains 108 species. Six universities, five colleges, five schools,

and one. society have each received a set during the year. A list of these is given in the report of the
Curator of marine invertebrates. (Section II.)

52 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

It is probable that during the next fiscal year sets of bird-skins will
also be prepared for distribution.

From the duplicate collections of the department of botany, distribu-
tions have been made to the Imperial Academy of Sciences, St. Peters-
burg, Russia; the Herbarium of the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, France;
the Herbarium of the British Museum, London, England; the Royal
Herbarium, Kew, England; and the Botanic Garden, Natal, South
Africa.

Several special requests for material for study have been complied
with. Among these were unmounted prints of photographs of the
Charnay casts for the Bureau of Ethnology; pieces of the vertebral col-
umns of Chimera and Gymnotus for Prof. John A. Ryder; ethnological
material for the Cincinnati Museum Association ; cast of jade adze for
Mr. Kunz; a loan of bird skeletons for Dr. J. L. Wortman, of the Army
Medical Museum, to aid in the preparation of a monograph upon the
anatomy of the fish hawk; two enlarged negatives and prints of the
Red River Dam views for Commodore J.G. Walker, chief of the bureau
of navigation, Navy Department; a collection of fishes for the College ;
of the City of New York; skull of Flat Head Indian for Prof. E. de Bois
Reymond, director of the Physiological Institute in Berlin.*

EXCHANGES.

PUBLICATIONS.

The publications of the National Museum consist of four series:

(1) The ANNUAL REPORT, submitted to the Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution, and by him transmitted to Congress as a part of
the report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

From 1850 to 1866 and from 1881 to 1883 the series was printed as an
appendix to the report of the Secretary.

From 1867 to 1873 no report was published, except in passing refer-
ence in the Secretary’s report on the Administrative work of the year.

From 1874 to 1877 the report of the Assistant Secretary on the Mu-
seum was quoted in the Secretary’s report, and from 1878 to 1880it was
incorporated in the report of the Secretary.

Since 1884 the report on the Museum has been printed as a separate
volume, constituting Part 11 of the report of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, and the fifth volume of this series—that for 1887~88—is now being
printed. Inthe appendix of this report are printed each year certain
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 55

papers illustrative of the work of the Museum and descriptive of its
collections, selected with reference to their general interests, as being
suited for publication in a large edition and calculated to excite interest
in the work of the Museum.

An edition of 7,000 copies of the Smithsonian Report, Part 1 and
Part 1, is placed in the hands of the Smithsonian Institution for dis-
tribution.

(2) The BULLETIN OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.—This series was
begun in 1875, and thirty-seven numbers have been printed, Bulletin 35
being now in the hands of the printer.* The aggregate number of
pages is 9,939+-616 plate pages, in all 10,555 pages, or 6595+ signatures.
The number, character, and size of these bulletins is given in the accom-
panying table.

(3) The PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.—This series was
begun in 1878 and the twelfth annual volume—that for 1889—is now
being printed.*

In the first eleven volumes were printed seven hundred and sixty
scientific papers in addition to thirty-four administrative papers printed
from time to time in the appendix.

The total of pages in the first ten volumes, excluding the appendices,
is 6,112, 410 of plates, or 6,522 pages, constituting 4063 signatures.

Of Vol. xt there have been printed 671 pages of text with 60 plates.
The total number of pages when the volume is complete will be about
725+120 plate pages.

In the table here introduced is shown the number of pages, text fig-
ures and plates, in Vols. I to x of the “ Proceedings.”

This series was established for the purpose of securing prompt
publication of discoveries in the Museum, and in order to secure this,
the printing has been done signature by signature as fast as matter was
prepared, and a certain number of signatures have always been dis-
tributed, as soon as published, to scientific institutions and special-
ists, these being dated by stamp in the Smithsonian Institution. The
number of signatures of each volume thus distributed has been in the
neighborhood of two hundred.

This method of publication has seemed to be to some extent wasteful,
and it is thought that good resuits may be secured by distributing a
certain number of the advance copies in the form of authors’ extras;
consequently, in making the requisition for the printing of Vol. xII the
following assignment was made: Out of an edition of 1,200 copies, 100
to be delivered in signatures as fast as printed, and 300 in extras or re-
prints, in paper covers, of which 50 are to be given to the authors and
the remainder distributed to specialists, in the various departments to

se Vol: XI an iwolee papers Of Vol. x11 have Boon Sshaten meonees the end of the
fiscal and the calendar year.

REPORT O« ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 59

which the papers relate, who are not otherwise provided with the pnb-
lication. The 800 remaining volumes to be bound and distributed in
this form.

In special instances, where a given paper in the ‘“‘ Proceedings” is
believed to be of great general interest and to require a larger distribu-
tion, it has been customary to print from one hundred to one thousand
extra copies.

(4) The MusEuM CIRCULARS: Of these, forty-one have now been
printed. The first thirty three numbers of the cirulars were included
as appendices to the Proceedings. Circulars 34 and 35 were printed in
the report of the Museum. Cireular 36 was issued only as a separate
and what should be No. 37 was printed without a number in Vol. x of
the “ Proceedings” (page 701). It is believed that hereafter it will be
more satisfactory to reprint them in the annual report of the Museum,
since they are more of an administrative than of a scientific character.
The object of printing them as appendices to the ‘‘ Proceedings” was to
provide for the expense out of the fund for printing the “ Proceedings,”
but since the printing fund is now more directly under the control of
the Museum, it is quite practicable to print such editions as may be
needed of these administrative papers, and instead of having them
electrotyped, they can be reset when the time comes for printing them
in the report—a method which is rather less expensive to the Museum
than the former one.

HISTORY OF THE MUSEUM PUBLICATION FUND.

16

ioe)

39

The publication of the Proceedings and the Bulletin was at first paid
for from the printing fund of the Interior Department, with which the
* Museum was at that time in close relations in respect to financial mat-

ters.

Subsequently it was paid for from a fund for printing the labels

of the Museum, estimates for which were annually submitted by the
Secretary of the Interior at the request of the Secretary of the Institu-

tion.

The amount asked for was usually $10,000, but in 1882~83 the

estimate was for $20,000, which sum, however, was not allowed.
Although in the book of estimates, the Museum appears as asking a

—e

certain sum for printing, no reference was made in making the appro-
priation for the Museum, but the money was given in the gross sum
allotted to the Interior Department as a Printing Fund.

In 1888, however, a separate appropriation was made for the first
time in these words: “ For the National Museum, for printing labels
and blanks and for the Bulletins and Annual Volumes of the Proceed-
ings of the Museum, $10,000. ”

In 1889 the appropriation for the fiscal year 1890 was made in the
same words, but was not included as heretofore in the appropriations
for the Department of the Interior.

The edition of the earlier volumes of the Proceedings and Bulletins
was usually only 1,000, of which a portion was distributed by the De-
partment of the Interior and a portion by the Museum, the number
received being sometimes as many as 500, and sometimes as few as 250.*
The edition placed at the disposal of the Museum being so small and
withal so uncertain as to number, the distribution was always of neces-
sity informal, and no effort was made, except in the case of the signa-
tures of Proceedings, already referred to, to provide for supplying
copies to a regular list of institutions and specialists. A considerable
number were used up in the work of the Museum, and the others were
sent to correspondents of the Museum in exchange for publications, for
specimens, and incidentally to such institutions as might apply for
copies, as well as to individuals, especially students who made it evi-
dent that they were in a position to make good use of the books.

In some cases, as, for instance, that of the catalogues of the Animal
Products and Fisheries Collection at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876
(Bulletin 14); the catalogue of the Exhibit of the Fisheries and Fish
Culture of the United States of America at the International Fishery
Exhibition at Berlin in 1880 (Bulletin 18), and the catalogue of the col-
lection exhibited by the United States at the International Fisheries
Exhibition at London in 1883 (Bulletin 27), the entire edition, and
indeed an extra large number of copies also, were entirely absorbed in
special uses in connection with the exhibition work. In other instances,
such as Coues and Prentiss’s “ Catalogue of the Birds of the District of
Columbia” (Bulletin 26) and Ward’s “Guide to the Flora of Washing-
ton and Vicinity” (Bulletin 22) the books were largely distributed to
supply a local demand.

It was, in fact, not intended that formal publication of these docu-
ments should be made from the advance edition to which I have re-
ferred.

Formal publication was undertaken by the Smithsonian Institution, it
being the intention that, the first cost of composition and electrotyping
having been provided for by the special Congressional appropriation,
the Smithsonian Institution should avail itself of the electrotype-plates

* The records show that of Bulletin 32, 250 copies were received; of Bulletin 29,
244; of Bulletin 25, 390; of Bulletins 27 and 30, 450.

and use them in making up certain volumes of the Miscellaneous Col-
lections. The papers published in the “ Proceedings” and “ Bulletin”
of the Museum were of precisely the same character which since 1862
had made up the great majority of the most important papers in the
Miscellaneous Collections. The Institution then undertook to print
an edition of 1,200 copies in the form of volumes of the Miscellaneous
Collections, and to distribute them to the principal libraries of the
world. ‘This was at the time regarded as advantageous, since the cost of
composition and electrotyping was always at least two-thirds of the cost
of an edition of 1,200, and in addition to this the miscellaneous distribu-
tion, for which the Institution in the case of similar publications printed
at its own expense had been accustomed to provide, was now already
provided for out of the preliminary issue of several hundred copies
paid for from the Museum fund.

The practice was in effect from 1878 to 1883, and five volumes of the
Miscellaneous Collections were made up entirely of the “* Proceedings”

and ‘ Bulletin” of the Museum, as is shown in the accompanying
table.

In this manner the first four volumes of the “ Proceedings” and the
first sixteen numbers of the “ Bulletin” were published, constituting in
each instance about one-third of the entire series up to the present date.

Since 1883 no publication of the “ Bulletin” has been made, and none
has been made in the ease of the “Proceedings” since 1882.

There remain unpublished, then, eleven volumes of the ‘“‘ Proceedings”
and twenty-one numbers of the “Bulletin,” in all sufficient to make
ten thick volumes of the Miscellaneous Collections. Possibly, by con-
densation and omissions the number might be reduced to nine volumes.

If the Institution were to undertake to print the edition of 1,000, now
customary in the case of the Miscellaneous Collections, the cost would
be not less than $9,000.

The same amount expended by the Institution in printing fresh mat-
ter would probably not produce one and a half volumes, or at most
two volumes, of Miscellaneous Collections.

As a matter of fact, however, the publication of the edition of 1,000
copies by the Smithsonian Institution would not really meet the neces-
sities of the case, since it would leave unsupplied a very large number
of libraries quite as deserving as those already on the list.

In view of all these facts, it seems not desirable that the Institution
should undertake hereafter the publication of the Museum “ Bulletin”
and “ Proceedings,” since it is evident that these will increase in bulk
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 63

from year to year, and that the demand upon the Institution would
very soon become too burdensome.

The desired result could be attained by obtaining from Congress an
increase in the appropriation for the Museum printing. It would then
be practicable to publish an edition of 2,000 copies in addition. A
volume of Proceedings not exceeding 800 pages could then be printed
each year, and an indefinite number of bulletins, not to exceed in the
aggregate 1,600 pages, with the necessary illustrations.

It is estimated that an edition of at least 3,000 copies is needed in
order to place these publications in the hands of those libraries which
ought to receive them.

Two tables are appended, one giving a list by States of the insti-
tutions to which it would seem proper that distribution should first be
made, and another, giving a schedule of the number required to supply
not only the institutions in the United States, but also scientific socie-
ties and speciailists at home and abroad.

The issue of the enlarged edition would begin with Vol. x11 of the
“ Proceedings ” and with Bulletin 40 or 41.
When the question of the publication of the back volumes is considered,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 65°

Vols. 1to Lv of the ‘* Proceedings” and Bulletins 1 to 16 may be regarded
as published; although not to the extent to which it would seem desirable
in the way of supplying localinstituticns. Of the following there are in
hand enough to make a very fair distribution, viz: ‘* Proceedings” Vol.
x and xi, and “ Balletins” Nos. 33 to 37. Of Vols. Vv. to 1x of “Pro-
ceedings” and of Bulletins 17 to 32, however, no systematic publication
can be made without the printing of an additional number of copies.

There are, apparently, three ways in which the necessities of the case
may be met.

(1) For the Smithsonian Institution to assume the publication in the
Miscellaneous Collections of all the volumes of the Proceedings up to
Vol. x11 and of the Bulletins up to No. 40. Then toclose the series and
to begin the publication of two new series of “ Proceedings” and “ Bul-
letin” with a new set of numbers, in each instance to begin with No. 1.

(2) For the Smithsonian Institution to publish Vols. v torx of the
‘* Proceedings,” and * Bulletins ” 17 to 52, to make as judicious as pos-
sible a distribution of the subsequent volumes, and to begin with the
year 1890 the publication of two series, as already suggested.

(3) To ask Congress in 1890 to appropriate a sum sufficient to complete
the back sets of the “ Proceedings” from Vol. I to x11, and in 1891 to
make a similar request for the printing of back numbers of the ** Bulle-
tin ;” in each case, if possible, securing an edition of 3,000 copies.

Appended to this part of the report are three lists of institutions, and
foreign and domestic libraries to which it is desired to send the future
publications of the Museum.

This is, of course, independent of the lists of special institutions and
of specialists, who are provided with papers relating to their own pecul- °
iar lines of work, and also of institutions or individual specialists and
correspondents of the Museum, with whom exchange is in progress,
since such lists are constantly varying.

PUBLICATIONS DURING THE YEAR.

Proceedings of the U. S. National Museum.—Vol. x of this series, for
i887, was issued in December, 1888, and contains viii+771 pages and
39 plates. The first signature of the volume printed in this year was
No. 32 (p. 497). In Vol. x are included seventy-eight papers* by
twenty-nine authors, ten of whom are officers of the Museum; namely,

Bulletin of the U. 8. National Museum.—No, 33 of this s
titled “ Catalogue of Minerals and Synonyms Alphabetically Arri
for the Use of Students,” by T. Egleston, Ph. D., was issued in 4
1889. The preparation of the catalogue was first undertaken
view to using it in the arrangement of the mineral collections of the
Sehool of Mines of Columbia College, New York City, but the vapid
growth of the collections impressed the author with the desirability
of enlarging the scope of his labors so that it could be used gener.
ally in museum work. ‘The catalogue contains 195 pages, thé names of
_ minerals being printed in double columns. This is the last bulletin of
the Museum printed by the authority of the Secretary of the Interior
Department. After the close of this fiscal year the Maseum will, in ae-
cordance with the sanction of Congress, superintend the printing of its
own publications and pay for them out of the special appropriation for
that purpose.

Mr. A. Howard Clark has continued his duties as editor of Proceed.
iugs and Bulletin. In April, 1889, he was ranted leave of absence,
the President having commissioned him Assistant to the United States
Commissioner-General to the Paris Exposition, and Mr. R. B. Baril
was appointed to act as editor in his absence.

The Public Printer has courteously expressed his interest in the mat-
ter of improving the appearance of the Museum publications, and has
permitted the use of a better quality of paper and of new type,

The manuscript for the following bulletins of the National Museum
has been transmitted to the Government Printing Office on the dates

mentioned :

70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

“Olinical study of the skull undertaken in connection with the morbid
conditions of the jaws and nasal chambers.”

During the year the following-named societies have, by permission,
held meetings in the Museum lecture hall:

The National Dental Association met on July 24, 25, and 26. On the
evening of September 20 was held one of the meetings of the Medical
Congress. The American Ornithologists’ Union held its sixth congress
on November 13, 14, and 15. Meetings of the Department of Superin-
tendence of the National Educational Association were held on March
6,7, and 8. The National Academy of Science held its meetings on
April 16,17, and 18. The council of the American Geological Congress
held business meetings on April 19. The American Historical Associa-
tion held its fifth meeting in Washington during Christmas week ; the
evening sessions being held at the Columbian University, the morning
sessions at the Museum.

STUDENTS.

Free access has as usual been given to students in the various branches
of natural history. The Museum has also received valuable assistance
from the volunteered co-operation of several specialists. In several in-
stances special groups of objects have been studied and identified by
naturalists, and in this way both they and the Museum have received
benefit.

Ensign A. P. Niblack was assigned by the Secretary of the Navy to

duty in the Smithsonian Institution on October 3, for the purpose of

preparing a report on the Coast Indians of Alaska and Northern British
Columbia. The report was made chiefly from notes taken by Ensign
Niblack, in connection with the survey of Alaska, 1885-1587. This re-
port was completed in time to include it as one of the Special papers in
the Museum report for last year.

Dr. C. Johnston, jr., of the Johns Hopkins University, has undertaken
the study of a Persian Astrolabe, obtained by the Museum, and at the
May meeting of the American Oriental Society presented a study, sug-
gested by this instrument, entitled “The Chaldean Astronomy.”

Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of the Department of Agriculture, has made
extensive studies of the arvicoline mice in the collection of mammals,
as well as of other groups of North American mammals.

Prof. D. K. Shute, of the Medical Department of the Columbia Uni-
versity, was afforded facilities for study in the laboratory of the De-
partment of Comparative Anatomy, and free access to the study series
of specimens.

A portion of the collection of batrachians was lent to Prof. E. D.
Cope to aid him in completing the illustrations for his work on the Ba-
trachia of North America, since published as Bulletin 54 of the National
Museum.

Dr. John A. Ryder, of the University of Pennsylvania, has been en-

4
—_we
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 71

gaged in a study of the vertebral column, and in this connection pieces
of the vertebral column of Chimaera were lent to him. Dr. Ryder has,
in a letter dated April 11, 1889, stated that every step can now be
traced of the process by which the axial column of vertebrata has be-
come what it is in the highest types.

Messrs. Frank Burns and Charles B. Greene have, by permission of
the Director of the U. 8. Geological Survey, rendered valuable assist-
ance by their studies of the collections of Tertiary Mollusks.

The collection of Materia Medica has been studied by several students
of medicine in the District of Columbia.

Dr. J. A. Allen, of New York, Dr. P. L. Sclater, and Mr. Osbert
Salvin, of London, Count von Berlepsch, of Miinden, Germany, and
several other active ornithologists, have received from the National
Museum material to aid them in their studies of particular groups of
Ameriean birds.

Dr. G. Baur, of Yale College, New Haven, Connecticut, has had for
study a number of the Chelonians belonging to the Museum. ‘The re-
sults of his studies have been published in Vol. xt of ‘ Zoologischer
Anzeiger,” Vol. xx1t of the “‘ American Naturalist,” Vol. m1of ‘“ An-
nals and Magazine of Natural History,” Vol. 1x of ‘ Biologisches Cen-
tralblatt,” and Vol. x1 of ‘‘ Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum.”

The undetermined Myriapoda in the collection of insects were sent
to Mr. C. H. Bollmann, of Bloomington, Ilinois, for study. The material
in the genera Oediomychis and Disonycha were sent to Dr. George H.
Horn, of Philadelphia, who is engaged in working up the genera of the
Halticide. Capt. T. L. Casey, of New York City, is studying the
Staphylinid group of beetles, and the Museum material in certain genera
was sent to him for examination.

Prof. A. E. Verrill and Prof. S. I. Smith have continued their work
upon the collections made by the U. S. Fish Commission, and for the

_ present stored at the Peabody Museum of Yale College. Prof. Edwin

Linton is studying the internal parasites of fishes collected chiefly by
himself at Wood’s Holl. Prof. Walter Faxon, of the Museum of Com-
parative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, has promised to report
upon the eray fishes received since 1885, and Mr. J. Walter Fewkes has
completed a paper on some of the Medusz collected by the Fish Com-
mission steamer Albatross in the region of the Gulf Stream. Prof. Les-
lie A. Lee, chief naturalist of the Fish Commission steamer Albatross,
has assorted the collections made by that vessel during the voyage
around South America, and several groups of marine objects have been
sent, for study and report, to different naturalists. These are referred to
at greater length in the report* of Mr. Richard Rathbun, curator of the
Department of Marine Invertebrates. Dr. T. H. Bean, curator of
Fishes, has rendered assistance to several students of ichthyology in
this and other cities.

* See Section It.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 73

The average amount paid this year on the monthly roll for furniture
and fixtures is $1,472.02, The greatest number of employés in any one
month is 33; the smallest, 20; the average, 27. The highest salary is
$150, paid to the Engineer of Property; the lowest pay on this roll, to
a cleaner of glass, is $30; the average being $54.18.

STANDARD CASES AND OTHER MUSEUM FURNITURE.

Among the various items of standard museum furniture there are
none, perhaps, that fill the purpose for which they were designed more
satisfactorily than the unit-tables, storage cases and drawers for the
storage of specimens.

The standard round columns, which support forty-eight wing-frames,
are of great utility where space is limited, since they admit of the dis-
play of a large superficial area (480 square feet) of drawings and other
illustrations upon 35 square feet of floor space.

These facts seem to be recognized, as we have frequent requests from
persons interested in museum administration in this and other coun.
tries for drawings of these styles of cases. To comply with sueh
requests, cyanotypes and specifications showing the details of construe-
tion have been prepared by Mr. J. E. Watkins, the engineer of prop-
erty, for transmission to applicants.

The following is a detailed list of cases, bases, frames, stands, appa-
ratus, general appliances, fittings, etc., made or furnished during the
year by persons outside the Museum:

much needed and important changes in different parts of the building,
whereby the number of rooms which could be used for office work was
increased, and the space available for study series of specimens, stor-
age of books, documents, etc., largely extended.
Partitions were built in the third floor, northwest pavilion, and extra
ceilings were put in; in the southeast pavilion a ceiling with flooring

above was built, thus giving an additional room for the accommodation
of the Entomological Department. Much new shelving was put up in
the different departments, the stationery room was re-arranged, new
files and boo«-cases were built for the Department of the Library, and a
large number of cases, bases, frames, pedestals, ete., was built and re-
remodeled.

In various places repairs have been found necessary in the flooring
of the Museum, on account of the dry rot, which is becoming so exten-
sive as to be a serious detriment. The bases of the cases standing
direetly upon the floor have also been found to be so much injured by
the prevailing dry rot as to make it necessary to raise them upon blocks,
pending the time when the bottoms of the cases can be repaired and
strengthened, and, when practicable each article permanently raised
upon casters. In order to prevent so far as possible any accumulation
of dampness, which might cause this decay, the trenches below the
building -hhave been thoroughly cleaned, and have received several coats
of whitewash, but the fact that the floors throughout the building were
laid in the damp concrete renders this precaution of little avail. It
has, however, been taken every year since the Museum has been oe-
cupied. .

HEATING AND LIGHTING.

The appropriation for heating and lighting for the fiseal year ending
June 30, 1889, was $13,000.

The services of telephone clerk, engineer and firemen for this year
amount to $5,435; $4,188.43 has been spent for coal and wood;
$1,188.57 for gas; $625.24 for electric work ; $800.16 for telephones ;
$120 for rental of call boxes; $638.81 for heating repairs; making a
total of $12,996.01, which leaves, May 1, 1890, an unexpended balance
of $3.99.

The average amount paid this year on the monthly roll for heating
and lighting is $453. The greatest number of employés in any month
is 9; the smallest, 6; the average, 8. The highest salary is $120, paid
to the engineer; the salaries of telephone clerk and firemen being uni-
formly $50; the average salary is $59.08.

The number of telephone calls made during the year is 31,377.

ELECTRICAL SERVICE.

A change, which proves satisfactory, has been made in the electrical
service, by substituting for the clocks formerly used others which are
run by the Gardiner system, and which, being connected with the U.S.
Naval Observatory, are automatically regulated each day at noon.

An important improvement in the engine-room has been the repairing
of the boiler, many of the tubes of which had become defective by long
use. New ones were obtained, and put into position by the regular
firemen, who, being practical mechanics, were able to accomplish these
repairs at a saving of a considerable expense to the Museum,

88 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORTS.

This department of the administrative work is under the charge of
Mr. R. J. Geare, executive clerk.

The office force includes a stenographer, a type-writer, an indexer, a
record clerk, and a messenger.

There has been prepared for the signature of the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution and of the Assistant Secretary in charge of the
Museum, 5,349 official papers, including 2,323 letters on miscellaneous
Museum matters; 263 reports on material transmitted for examination ;
1,138 acknowledgments of specimens given or lent to the Museum; 374
letters transmitting specimens to museums, colleges, schools, and indi-
vidual investigators. In addition, nearly a thousand letters in regard
to Museum publications have been written.

A special feature of the Museum correspondence is in connection with
requests for technical information upon various subjects. The letters

Among those which have been accepted, and which have resulted most
favorably to the Museum, may be mentioned the explorations of Mr.
Talcott Williams, Dr. John M. Crawford, Mr. Jeremiah Curtin, Mr. W.
W. Rockhill, Prof. I. C. Russell, and Lieut. E. H. Taunt.

Special reference to the results of their work is made under the head
of “ Exploration.”

A special feature of the routine work of this department is the
method of indexing letters written. A card has been prepared on
which is written the name and address of each correspondent, together
with the number of the letter-books and pages in which all letters to a
given person have been copied, including the date of each letter. By
this means can be ascertained at a glance the amount of correspondence
with any person. This has been found exceedingly convenient. More
than five thousand of these cards have been filled up during the year
relating to letters written since 18587. These cards are arranged alpha-
betically and kept in long boxes divided into compartments, one or more
of which are devoted, as required, to a single letter of the alphabet.
Cross references are made under the name of the Government depart-
ment or private establishment with which the person addressed may be
connected. For instance, all letters written to any official in the Treas-
ury Department are recorded on cards headed “Treasury Department,”
and another card is filed under the name of the person addressed.
This is particularly convenient in the case of the Government depart-
ments where changes of officials are more or less frequently ocurring.

BUILDINGS AND LABOR.—POLICE AND PUBLIC COMFORT.

The staff employed for police and inspection has remained under the
charge of Henry Horan, superintendent of buildings.

From the reports of the superintendent are quoted in brief the follow-
ing statements, which will serve to show in part the character of the
work accomplished by the laboring force during the year :

1sss.

July.—During the first part of the month the mechanics and laborers were occupied
in making preparations for the shipment of exhibits to the Cincinnati Exposition,
which were finally shipped in twelve car-loads. Later in the month twenty-two
boxes, containing the photographie exhibit, were forwarded by freight. This com-
pleted the work of packing and shipping the exhibit from the Smithsonian Institu-
tion.

On July 9, the work of preparing material, packing and shipping an exhibit to the
Marietta exposition was begun. This was completed on July 14.

On July 16, additional mechanics and laborers, who had been hired for work in
connection with the Cincinnati exposition, were discharged. In order to afford better
light in the main hall of the Smithsonian building, one end of each of the galleries
was cut off.. The fence inclosing the buffalo yard was painted. New steps were made
and placed in the annex east entrance leading to the basement.

Storage-cases for specimens were built for the Department of Ethnology ; two card-
catalogue boxes for the executive clerk’s office, aud two cases for the metallurgical
department.

August.—Scaftolding was erected in the main hall of the Smithsonian building to
facilitate the preparation of the walls and ceiling for painting. The painting of the
exhibition hall of the Department of Fishes was finished. In the carpenter and paint
shops, the following work has been completed: Construction of one large storage-
case for unit trays, one frame for mounting tiles, cutting and fitting glass for cable-
frames, putting mahogany casing around plaster casts; making pedestals for the de-
partment of mammals; construction of two large tubs for holding trees in the rotunda.
New mahogany label-frames were made. Mahogany panel ends have been put in
four door-screen cases in the department of lithology.

The alteration of the galleries in the main hall of the Smithsonian building has
been continued this month.

The following work has also been completed: Putting new floor in the café; shel-
lacing and painting wall cases; extending wall-cases and polishing specimen blocks
for the department of comparative anatomy; repairing broken cases and making
frames for the department of ethnology. For the executive clerk’s office there has
been made one case of drawers with shelving, and one case for letter-books. The
refitting of doors to cases in several departments has been continued from day to day.

September.—Several repairs in different parts of the Museum building and in the
Armory building were rendered necessary by the results of a severe storm which oc-
curred on September 10. The cases formerly occupying the wall space at the south
entrance of the Smithsonian building, were removed to the northeast court of the
Museum building. A great many blocks for specimens have been painted and ebon-
ized for the various departments, and the work of fitting shelves to cases has been
continued. ;

The platform in the lecture room has been repaired, and a large book-case made for
the Department of Buildings and Labor. Five pier upright cases have been remod-
eled for the Department of Ethnology, and several catalogue boxes have been made
for the executive clerk’s office. Oak frames for transparencies have been made. The
office of the engineer of property has been furnished with a brass wire screen. The
extension and remodeling of the bird cases still continue.

October.—The stained glass in the circle over the south entrance of the Smithsonian
building has been removed and replaced with plain glass. The radiators in the
southeast court were removed from the walls to make room for wall cases, and were
placed further back towards the center of the hall. This work necessitated some ex-
cavating in connection with the fitting of the steam-pipes. A new shed was built
for the collection of living turtles and other specimens. Repairs were made to the
floor in the southeast court. Oneof the upper rooms of the north tower in the Smith-
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 101

sonian building has been assigned to the Department of Mollusks, and shelving has
been erected therein for the storage of trays, etc., belonging to that department.
The halls and galleries in the Smithsonian building have been scoured and cleaned,
and the furniture placed in order after the confusion incident to the painting of the
walls. The mechanics have also been occupied on the following work: making five
hundred blocks for the exhibition of medals; making frames for Assyriau slabs, and
mahogany shelves for the Department of Mammals; remodeling pier cases, and fitting
them with shelves; fitting drawers and locks to cases; making drawers for storage
eases; fitting mahogany table tops to wooden pedestals; constructing a platform for
the steam-steering machine in the Department of Transportation and Engineering;

case; beveling one thousand blocks for the Department of Minerals; making a desk
and case of pigeon-holes for the registrar’s office; making frames for plaster casts ;
painting the window frames of the Museum building; painting walls in the lecture’
room; kalsomining the east front of the annex building; ebonizing blocks for the
Department of Minerals.

November.—Early in the month the Superintendent left Washington with six skilled
laborers for Cincinnati for the purpose of packing and returning to the Museum the
exhibits and cases sent to the Exposition. A force of men has been engaged in clean-
ing out the sheds at the Armory and re-arranging the vast amount of material there
stored. The tender belonging to the engine ‘‘ John Bull” was brought over from the
Armory and placed at the east entrance of the Museum building. The lecture hall was
cleared to make room for the return of the exhibits from Cincinnati, which began to
arrive on the 26th. On December 15, all this material was safely housed, and the
superintendent with his men returned to their duties in the Museum. The work of
unpacking and returning the exhibits to their proper departments occupied the time
of the entire laboring force for many days. After most of the above work was com-
pleted, the Graphic Art exhibit, recently returned from Cincinnati, was installed in the
lecture hall. During the latter part of this month many of the cases in the Anthropo-
logical hall were re-arranged. Thecarpenters completed remodeling pier cases for use
in the Department of Arts and Industries. The following work was also accomplished :
One book-case, with shelves, was made for the Department of Botany ; changing
doors in unit tables in the Department of Botany ; making two oak book-cases for
the Executive Department; constructing pigeon-holes for the Department of Building
Stones; also counter, drawers, and pigeon-holes for the office of the engineer of prop-
erty; adjusting locks and doors in floor cases in the southwest hall. The painters
have been engaged in covering and painting diaphragms, lettering screens, and var-
nishing picture frames ; painting tubs for plants in the rotunda; painting the walls
of the public comfort room ; glazing windows in the Smithsonian and Museum build-
ings ; painting walls over the stairway in the east pavilion; finishing in hard oil a
large book-case for the executive clerk’s office ; painting cases for the Department of

been made. The west hall has been re-arranged and the lecture hall put in order for
the meetings of the American Historical Association. Eleven door screen cases have
been furnished to the curator of birds. These will take the place of the old white
cases in the center of the hall, which will be condemned as soon as the specimens have
been removed. Theold storm doorat the north entrance to the Museum building has
been removed to the east entrance, and larger and more serviceable ones have been
placed at the northentrance. The following work has also been accomplished ;: Con-
struction of base for statues; painting trays; repairing Japanese clock; construction
of card catalogue shelves for cases ; putting strips in case for medals; painting bases ;
making two large walnut bases; setting glass in the antelope case, and finishing and
shellacing pedestals; painting pedestals and putting locks on cases in the Department

March.—During the early part of this month almost the entire force was required
to remain after the regular hours in order to complete the re-arrangement of cases in
the exhibition halls. On March 2, eight of the force were sworn in as special police-
men, this being thought advisable for the better protection of the collections during
the inauguration season. Several of the laborers, carpenters, and painters were re-
quired to do duty as watchmen on this occasion. The arrangement of the Lorillard

THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS,.

The preparation of specimens for exhibition in the Museum and for
the study series has been satisfactorily continued. The work of mod-
eling is in charge of Mr. W. T. Hornaday, chief taxidermist.

TAXIDERMISTS AND MODELERS,

The operations of the department in preparing groups of mammals
have been greatly hampered by the vast amount of other necessary
routine work, but considerable progress has been made with several
groups which it is expected will be completed during the coming year.

These groups are: é

Gray Squirrels.—Part of this group was completed for the Cincinnati
Exposition, but owing to lack of space it was not sent. It has now
been decided to increase its size, incorporating in it all that it is pos-
sible to exhibit of the life history of the squirrels, thus making it more
comprehensive and instructive.

Red Squirrels —What is stated of the gray-squirrel group applies
to this group also.

Red and Gray Foxes.—Some work has been done on these groups, but
more material has yet to be collected.

Rabbits.—Material has been collected for this group, and it will be
one of the first finished.

Moose.—Considerable work has been done on this large and important
group. The manikins for three of the six animals of which this group
will be composed, have been made, and it is the intention to bring it to
completion at an early date. The group will occupy a special case of
the same dimensions as that containing the group of buffaloes.

In addition to the work mentioned above, a portion of the necessary
materials for several other groups have been collected and designs
drawn. These groups will include the Rocky Mountain Goat, Rocky
Mountain Sheep, Musk-ox, Beaver, Raccoon, and Woodchuck.

The Opossum and Prairie-Dog groups have been put in their new
cases and the Orang-outang group retouched. The Antelope group
was sent to the Cincinnati Exposition. When a new case for this group
has been made, it isintended to add several specimens of different ages,
and to rearrange it for exhibition.

Sixty fresh specimens of mammals received during the year and fifty
alcoholic specimens were skinned and preserved. Of the sixty fresh
animals skinned, thirty-three were collected by the taxidermists, fif-
teen were received from the Department of Living Animals, and twelve
from the Mammal Department. Thirty-eight skins were also received,
dry and alcoholic. There has been some progress in making up into
good dry skins the duplicate material on hand. A beginning has also
been made in reducing the number of alcoholic specimens by working
them over into dry skins for the reserve collection.

The following statement relates to dry skins which have been made
during the year:

A number of porpoise casts sent to the Cincinnati Exposition having
been returned more or less injured, it was decided to put them in good
condition, and also to overhaul others on exhibition and in storage.
This work has been done almost entirely by Mr. Joseph Palmer and
Mr. A. H. Forney. A list of these is as follows, about a dozen remain-
ing to be completed another year :

MISCELLANEOUS WORK OF THE TAXIDERMISTS.

Collection of domestic animals.—For many years it has been custom-
ary to include in the exhibits of the Mammal and Bird Departments
such specimens of domestic animals as may be received. During the
past year it has been decided to form a separate collection under the
above name, and the various specimens on hand have been brought
together, renovated, and exhibited in a large wall case in the Section
of Animal Products.

The collection is composed as follows: 6 mammals (llama, sheep,
dog, cat, etc.), 31 ducks and geese, 86 domestic fowls; a total of 12
specimens.

These have all been thoroughly cleaned, poisoned, and placed on new
stands. A number of other animals have also been received for this
collection and will be placed on exhibition as soon as they are mounted.

In connection with the return of the exhibi ts from the Cincinnati Ex-
position considerable work was done by the taxidermists. Mr. A. H.
Forney was sent to Cincinnati to unpack and install the exhibits of
mammals. This consisted of some sixty boxes, with over one hundred
and fifty specimens, which, on their return, were unpacked, cleaned, and,
when vecessary, repaired.

The space in the Museum occupied by the taxidermic exhibit was
needed for the collection of domestic animals, and it became necessary
therefore to remove it. This has been done, but the collection does
not show to good advantage in its present position. New and larger
cases are desirable. When more room is obtained, it is intended to
make the collection far more complete than at present.

The following gentlemen have been instructed in taxidermy during
the year, especially in the art of making good dry skins: Mr. William
Taylor, of San Diego, Texas; Lieut. Emory H. Taunt, U.S. N., repre-
sentative of the United States in the Congo region; and Mr. Harry
Perry, who expects to spend several years in Honduras.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 10%

A tanned skin of an albino buffalo calf was received from Lieut.
Colonel Kellogg. It was cleaned, poisoned, and placed on exhibition
in the fur collection. Five boxes of specimens were packed for ship-
ment. Nine mounted mammals have been repaired, poisoned, and put
in good condition. Two seals and a large walrus were placed on new
stands. Casts have been made of six bodies or parts of bodies of mam-
mals received in the flesh. These are often of great assistance in
mounting, since they furnish the best idea of the size and shape of
the species. Quite a number of these are now on hand and form a
very interesting and instructive collection.

Congress having provided for the fitting up of the Armory building
for the use of the Fish Commission, the third floor of that building has
been reserved for the modelers and taxidermists of the Museum. It
became necessary therefore to remove this department from the second
and fourth floors to new rooms on the third floor. This department
now occupies three rooms in the Armory building, a shed outside, con-
taining the collection of pickled skins, and a number of storage rooms
in the Smithsonian basement, containing molds and easts.

MODELING AND PAINTING.

Mr. J. W. Hendley has continued his work during the year. For the
Department of Transportation he has made two lay figures, an In-
dian hunter on snow shoes with gun in one hand and three birds in the
other, and an Eskimo seated on a sled. He has repainted a Japanese
carrying-box. For the food collection he has cast and painted a beef-
steak, a platter of butter, two loaves of bread, and repaired a num-
ber of articles. For the Department of Ethnology he has repaired and
cleaned seventy small statuettes, cast and painted thirteen implements,
made ten casts of Assyrian seals, together with numerous flat impres-
sions of the same. For other departments: Eight casts of fossil shark’s
teeth, nine casts of fossil bones, casts of contents of two jars of phos-
phorus, repaired and painted cast of skull of the fossil bull (Bos wrus),
made fourteen casts of a rare trilobite, and of numerous minor objects.

Mr. Joseph Palmer has done very little taxidermic work during the
year, most of his time having been taken up in work on the series of
porpoise casts, and in casting and setting up large casts of antique
objects. A statement of the most important work accomplished is as
follows: Several weeks were spent in changing and repairing the orna-
mentation of the columns in the Smithsonian building. A complete set
of casts was made from the molds of Assyrian antiquities, taken at the
Fairfax Seminary, Virginia. He repaired and set up for exhibition a
series of Assyrian and Egyptian casts, received from Berlin, twenty-five
large and small specimens ; repaired and painted a bust of the King of
Siam, and made a cast of the Indian chief Osceola; made a mold and
108 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

cast of the Siloom inscription, and made a cast of the memorial medal-
lion of Prof. Joseph Henry. Only a few molds of animals have been
made during the year, but these have been very important.

A Bottle-nosed whale (Mesoplodon bidens) was received whole, and a
complete mold of both sides was made, as also a separate mold of the
head with the mouth open. The largest of the specimens of the Gala-
pagos tortoises, collected by the Fish Commission steamer Albatross,
died in the Department of Living Animals, and a mold was made from
it. These molds are stored with others, and will be cast in due time.

OSTEOLOGICAL PREPARATOR.

Mr. F. A. Lucas, Assistant Curator in the Department of Compara-
tive Anatomy, reports that the work of the past year has been very
largely devoted to the preparation of material, and to the care of that
already in the collection.

The enlargement of the large exhibition case in the osteological hall,
and necessary alterations in the small case, have necessitated the mov-
ing of the entire series of specimens on exhibition and their complete
re-arrangement.

The preparation of a much-needed card catalogue of alcoholic birds
has been commenced and is well advanced, and a large amount of work
has been done in classifying and caring for this valuable portion of the
collection.

Some work has been done in the preparation of specimens of soft
anatomy, and some on invertebrate material, while the greater portion
of one month was passed in arranging vertebrate fossils, and in pre-
paring them for exhibition.

The cast of a skeleton of Dinoceras, received from the Yale College
Museum has been mouted.

At the close of the Cincinnati Exposition the entire labor of packing
all the zoological material there exhibited by the Departments of Mam-
mals, Birds, Insects, and Comparative Anatomy was performed under
Mr. Lucas’s direction, and the collections reached Washington in good
condition.

The skeleton of a whale exhibited at Cincinnati was, on its return,
again hung from the ceiling of the Museum. Another whale skeleton
acquired by the Museum has also been put in place, and a third has
been moved to a new location in the osteological hall, and there sus-
pended from the wall on a plan devised by Mr. Lueas.

The following table gives a summary of the material received and of
the work of preparation during the year:

PHOTOGRAPHER,

Mr. T. W. Smillie reports that 253 negatives have been added to the
permanent files. Of these, 58 related to ethnology, 116 to prehistoric
anthropology, 11 to mammals, 3 to osteology, 21 to transportation, 10
to graphic arts, aud 181 to miscellaneous subjects. Thirty-nine trans-
parencies were also made.

The number of prints made during the year is 2,199, distributed as
follows: ethnological, 190; anthropological, 138; mammals, 22; osteo-
logical, 3; transparencies, 77; graphic arts, 10; miscellaneous, 1,759.
In addition to this 25 enlargements have been made; 39 cyanotypes
have been printed, and a collection of misceilaneous photographs, 113
in number, have been mounted.

The following special work for the U. 8S. Fish Commission has also
been performed: Negatives made, 22; silveralbumen prints, 22 ; cyan-
otypes, 476.

The usual routine work of numbering and filing negatives, making
up outfits for expeditions, ete., has been continued.

By request of the Postmaster-General and by order of the Assistant
Secretary, a number of samples of canceling inks have been tested
for the Post-Office Department.

The illustrating of the lectures given in the National Museum has
been conducted by means of the stereopticon operated by the photog-
rapher and his assistants.

A collection intended to show the uses of photography was pre-
pared for exhibition at the Cincinnati Exposition. This collection in-
cluded valuable contributions of photographs from Prof. E. C. Picker-
ing, of Harvard University, Mr. J. W. Osborne, of Washington, and
from several officers connected with the Government service, notably,
the Geodetic and Coast Survey; the Light-House Board; the Army
Medical Museum, and the proving ground at Annapolis. At the close
of the Exposition this collection was returned to the Museum and is
now being prepared, in connection with additional material which has
since been received, for permanent exhibition. It is intended that the
scope of this exhibit shall be enlarged so as to take the form of an
110 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

historical collection in which shall be shown examples of every photo-
graphic process that has been invented, together with the appliances
used, beginning with the photograph of the solar spectrum, as made
by Scheele in 1777, and showing each step in the evolution of photog-
raphy from that time to the present day. Considerable material has
already been gathered which will be incorporated in this collection.

The first camera made inthe United States has been acquired by
purchase. A stereoscope, containing daguerreotypes and transparencies
by the old albumen process on glass, was presented by Mrs. E. J. Stone.
The Scoville Manufacturing Company of New York, presented a series
of cameras showing the latest improvements, and from the Eastman
Dry-Plate Company of Rochester, New York, has been received a
Kodak camera, together with a series of enlarged photographs, illus-
trating its use.

The following students have been instructed in photography: Lieut.
EK. H. Taunt, U.S. N., Mr. W. H. Perry, Miss Frances B. Johnston,
Dr. T. H. Bean, Mr. Howard, and Professor J. B. Daish.

In the year 1887, Mr. Smillie was transferred from the U. S. Fish
Commission to the National Museum as chief photographer. From
that time the photographic work of the Fish’ Commission has been
done in the Museum on the following conditions :

The Commissioner furnishes an assistant, as well as the material and
apparatus necessary for the work of the Commission. The work of the
assistant is under the supervision of the photographer of the Museum,
who makes the requisitions for material, and keeps a record of the
work done. In return, the assistant paid by the Fish Commission is
expected to assist in work for the Museum, when not occupied in the
interest of the Commission.

COLORIST.

Mr. A. Zeno Shindler has spent « considerable part of the year in
repainting a collection of fish casts for the Cincinnati Exposition.
He has painted for use in the Department of Birds two maps, repre-
senting the two hemispheres. For the Ethnological Department he
has painted eighty-five photographs of Indians, and also sixty-four
photographs of Indians and negroes of Surinam, from the collection of
Prince Roland Bonaparte. Life-size busts of the King of Siam, King
Kalakaua of the Sandwich Islands and Miss Fairchild, have also been
painted.

In connection with the formation of a collection of oil paintings repre-
senting the races of man, the following types have been finished : Eskimo
Dyak of Borneo; Apache (Arizona); Niam Niam (Africa); Chief of the
Clallam Indians, Washington; Aborrigine of Australia; portrait of the
Secretary of the Chinese Legation in Washington,

DRAUGHTSMEN.

Beginning with the year 1884, the report of the National Museum
has consisted of a separate volume, and a section of each report has,
since and including that year, been devoted to the publication of papers
illustrative of collections in the National Museum. Many of these
papers have been illustrated by both photographs and drawings.
The former have been made by Mr. T. W. Smillie, photographer. It
has been more satisfactory in certain cases to have drawings of the ob-
jects prepared in the Museum, especially in connection with the illustra-
tion of the following papers: In Report for 1884: ‘‘Throwing-sticks in
the National Museum”, by Otis T. Mason (17 plates) ; ‘‘ Basket-work of
the North American Aborigines,” by Otis T. Mason (64 plates); ‘A
study of the Eskimo bows in the U.S. National Museum,” by John Mur-
doch (12 plates); “The West Indian Seal,” by Frederick W. True and
F. A. Lueas (3 plates). In Report for 1886: ‘ How to collect Mammal
skins for purposes of study and for mounting,” by William T. Hornaday
(9 figures). In Report for 1887: ‘“ Cradles of the American Aborigines,”
by Otis T. Mason (45 figures); ‘‘The Human Beast of Burden,” by Otis
T. Mason (54 figures); ‘“‘ Ethno-Conchology--A Study of Primitive
Money,” by Robert E. C. Stearns (9 plates and 39 text figures); “The
Extermination of the American Bison,” by William T. Hornaday (12
platesand 1 map). In the Report for 1888: “The Indians of the North-
west Coast,” by Ensign A. P. Niblack (70 plates and 48 text figures) ;
‘‘ Fire-making apparatus in the National Museum,” by Walter Hough
(8 plates and 60 text figures).

Illustrations for papers on “ Eskimo Strike-a-Light,” by Walter Hough;
“ Skin Scrapers,” by Otis T. Mason; and ‘“‘ Easter Island,” by Paymaster
William J. Thomson, U.S. Navy, are now being prepared.

The drawings for the greater part of these illustrations have been
made by Mr. W. H. Chandlee and Mr. W. H. Burger, both of whom are
in the employ of the Museum, and have been especially assigned to the
Department of Ethnology, from which department have emanated the
larger proportion of illustrated papers,

A great deal of time has been occupied in piece work connected with
general administration and covering the entire field of draughting, em-
bracing topographical and architectural work, tracings and sketch maps,
engrossing, lettering, table designing, sketching of articles temporarily
in the Museum, coloring of maps and charts, and artistic color work.
For these purposes the following mediums were required: oil-colors and
water-colors (transparent and opaque), pens and ink, lead pencils, cray-
ons (Conté and lithographic), charcoal, and lamp-black.

The decrease in the number of the accessions this year may be ac-
counted for in part by refusals of collections which have been necessi-
tated owing tolack of both storage and exhibition room.

A geographical statement has been prepared, showing the sources of
the more important accessions.

GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW OF THE MORE IMPORTANT ACCESSIONS.

During the year, material has been received from nearly every part
of the world, although as usual the greater number of the accessions
have come from the United States. The following statement has refer-
ence to the most important accessions. These have, as far as possible,
been arranged under the localities from which they were gathered
rather than the place of residence of the sender.

AFRICA.

I.—CO-OPERATION OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND BUREAUS
OF THE GOVERNMENT.

The National Museum has continued to enjoy the friendly co opera-
- tion of the departments and bureaus of the Government, and many of
them have contributed very liberally to the collections of the Museum
during the year. In addition to the contribution of specimens, a wide
interest in the affairs of the Museum has been manifested. The most
extensive aid to the Museum, as far as the receipt of collections is con-
cerned, has been rendered by the U. 8. Geological Survey, whose work
is in many ways closely allied to that of the Museum. The co-operation
of officers of the War and Navy Departments has been especially con-
spicuous and gratifying, and the Department of State, particularly
through the agency of its consuls, has contributed largely to the inter-
esting material received during the year.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE.

Hon. 'T. F. Bayard, Secretary of State, sent photographs of Indians
of the Goajira Peninsuia, which forms the extreme northwestern part
of Venezuela.

Hon. A. L. Rives, First Assistant Secretary of State, sent a collec-
tion of water-color sketches and photographs of Samoan scenery and
life.

Iron ore, coal, coke, and specimens of shale from Brazil were re-
ceived through Hon. A. A. Adee, Assistant Secretary of State.

A valuable and interesting collection of textile fabrics of wool,
worsted, silk, cotton, mohair, and alpaca was received through Hon.
William Grinnell, United States consul, at Bradford, England.

Twenty-four specimens of ores were transmitted by Hon. Otto E.
Reimer, United States consul at Santiago de Cuba.

Consul Mason, at Marseilles, sent an interesting series of samples of
ramie.

The United States consul at Sydney, New South Wales, sent samples
of Australian wool.

A package of engravings illustrating the breeds of foreign cattle,
sheep, and swine, were received from Mr. J. Fenner Lee, chief clerk.

Through the courtesy of the Department facilities have been ex-
tended to collectors for the National Museum by means of letters of
introduction to ministers and other officials in the countries to be visited,
and in other ways.

TREASURY DEPARTMENT.

The Treasury Department has bestowed the usual courtesies in pass-
ing, free of entry, material sent from abroad and intended for the
Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum. The thanks of the
138 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

Museum are due to the Department for its friendly offices in affording
facilities to collectors and explorers in behalf of the Museum. ‘The
Light-House Board, the Life-Saving Service, the U. S. Coast and Geo-
detic Survey, and the Revenue Marine Division have eavh contributed
interesting specimens to the Museum, and have in various ways facili-
tated the work of some one or more of the departments in the Museum.

Life-Saving Service.—Hon. 8. I. Kimball, Superintendent of the Life-
Saving Service, has aided the Museum by giving instructions to the
keepers of Life-Saving stations to forward to the Museum any marine
specimens captured in their vicinity which might be desired. As a
result of this co-operation the following material has been received: A
fresh specimen of Sowerby’s whale (Mesoplodon bidens), from Capt. J.
L. Gaskill, keeper of the Absecom Life-Saving station, Atlantic City.
William H. Gaskill, keeper of the Cape Lookout Life-Saving station,
North Carolina, transmitted a fresh specimen of Sunfish (Mola mola).

LTight-House Board.—A collection of blue prints of lamps and flames,
illustrating the illuminating system of the Light-House Service, was
sent, at the request of the Museum, for exhibition at the Cincinnati
Exposition, and formed an important feature of the photographic ex-
bibit of the Museum on that occasion. W. M. Quinn, keeper of the
Cape Sanbias Light-House station, Florida, sent a collection of turtles.

Revenue Marine Division —A valuable and interesting collection of
photographs of the natives and scenery of Alaska, taken by the officers
of the revenue steamer Bear, was lent to the Museum by Mr. Peter
Bonnett, chief of the division.

Secret Service Division.—A collection of photographs of counterfeiters
was, through the kindness of Mr. John S. Bell, chief of the division,
lent to the Museum for exhibition at Cincinnati, for the purpose of illus-
trating the uses to which photography had been applied in connection
with the requirements of the Government service.

‘The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Mr. J. S. Miller, presented
two living Black bears from West Virginia.

Dr. J. W. Jewett, examiner of drugs, Custom-House, New York City,
sent a collection of drugs.

U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey presented a series of photographs,
showing the methods of mounting photographic exhibits. Specimens
of marine invertebrates, fishes, mollusks, and insects collected at Cape
Sable, Florida, were transmitted to the Museum.

Several specialists engaged in making collections for the Museum
have, through the courtesy of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey,
been supplied with charts of the regions along the coast to be explored.

WAR DEPARTMENT.

The Museum has received valuable aid from this Department in many
ways, especially through the Quartermaster’s Department of the Army.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 139

Through its medium collections of living animals and other objects in-
tended for the Museum have been promptly forwarded, which might
have been injured by the ordinary methods of transportation.

Six photographs of Hell Gate explosion were sent by Maj. W. R.
King, Willetts Point, New York, for exhibition at the Cincinnati Ex-
position.

Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U. 8. Army, Fort Snelling, Minn., sent a small
collection of reptiles, fishes, and batrachians from Arizona.

Dr. J. L. Wortman, U.S. Army Medical Museum, presented four liv-
ing rattlesnakes and a Bee-eating buzzard.

Lieut.-Col. S. C. Kellogg, U.S. Army, deposited a buffalo robe.

Dr. John S. Billings, Curator of the Army Medical Museum, pre-

in the mountains near Lima, Peru, and three pieces of pottery from
Ancon, Peru.

Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, U.S. Army, stationed at Fort Wingate, New
Mexico, presented the following specimens : a hawk, a long-billed marsh
wren, a living rattlesnake, a pigeon hawk, field mice and pocket mice,
two bird skins, eight batrachians, and a skin of a western red-tailed
hawk.

Capt. Charles E. Bendire, U.S. Army, has continued his valuable
service as Honorary Curator of the collection of birds’ eggs.

U.S. Signal Office—Generat A. W. Greely, Chief Signal Officer, sent a
specimen of flexible sandstone, collected by the stgnal observer at Char-
lotte, North Carolina. A Secchi meteorograph and two sections of Beck’s
pantograph,and Myers’ autograph telegraphic instrument were deposited
in the Museum, and have been added to the collection of scientific ap-
paratus. Photographs of meteorological records were contributed to the
exhibit of photography prepared by the Museum in connection with the
Cincinnati Exposition. Through the kindness of the Chief Signal Officer
a large number of correspondents and collaborators of the Museum
have been supplied with Mr. Lucian M. Turner’s ‘Contributions to the
Natural History of Alaska.”

° NAVY DEPARTMENT.

The principal accession has been a collection of fifty-nine mounted
birds, transmitted by the U. 8S. Naval Academy, at Annapolis, Md.

Several pieces of bronze and copper from the Washington Navy-Yard
were obtained through the kindness of Commodore M. Sicard, Chief of
the Bureau of Jrdnance.

The Ordnance Office of the Naval Academy sent, through Lieut.
Albert Gleaves, several photographs of a projectile in flight from a
Hotchkiss magazine-rifle.

Through the courtesy of Commander ©. F. Goodrich, several photo-
graphs of torpedo experimental work were obtained.
140 REPORT OF NATJONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

At the request of the Museum, Lieut. George L. Dyer, hydrographer,
furnished a copy of the British admiralty chart, and also charts of
Queen Charlotte Islands, Hecate Straits, and Dixon Entrance, for use
in the Ethnological Department of the Museum.

Dr. J. M. Flint, U. S. Navy, has contributed valuable services as
Honorary Curator of the section of Materia Medica.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.

U. S. Geological Survey.—The Museum acknowledges with gratitude
and pleasure the valuable assistance of the Survey, whose operations
are in many respects closely related to the work of the Museum. The
researches of the geologists connected with the Survey are of especial
value by reason of the large collections which are made, and which
after being worked over and described are transferred to the Museum
collections. The past year has been, perhaps, as notable as any in the
acquirement by the Museum of valuable and interesting collections
from this source, as will be seen from the appended statement.

The U. 8. Geological Survey presented several pieces of Indian pottery, and
a number of stone relics found in Prentiss County, Mississippi; a specimen of native
platinum from Washington Territory ; rock specimens from California, collected by
J. 8S. Diller; a large collection of rocks (comprising about 2,000 specimens) of the
Comstock Lode and Washoe District, Nevada, gathered by S. F. Emmons and G. F.
Becker. This collection is more fully described-in Mr. Becker’s report of the geology
of this region (Monograph 11, U. 8. Geological Survey), and also in Messrs. Hague
and Iddings’s paper on the Development of Crystallization in Igneous Rocks (Bul-
letin U. S. Geological Survey, No. 17); a collection of minerals, made by Dr.
W. F. Hillebrand from various localities; a mineral from Yellowstone National
Park, Wyoming, collected by Walter H. Weed; a collection of 1,371 minerals, col-
lected by S. L. Penfield in St. Lawrence, Lewis, and Jefferson Counties, New York,

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 141

The Director of the Geological Survey has, on several occasions, ex-
tended very important assistance to the geological departments of the
Museum, and has inspired the geologists of the Survey in the matter of
advancing the interests of the Museum in every possible way, both in
connection with their field-work and while on duty in Washington.

Several officers of the Geological Survey are officially connected with
the Museum in the capacity of honorary curators of collections. These
are Dr. C. A. White, in charge of Mesozoic fossils; Mr. C. D. Wal-
cott, in charge of Paleozoic fossils; Mr. William H. Dall, in charge
of mollusks and tertiary fossils, with Dr. R. E. C. Stearns as adjunet
curator; Prof. U. C. Marsh, in charge of vertebrate fossils; Mr. Les-
ter F. Ward, in charge of fossil plants; Prof. F. W. Clarke, in charge
of minerals. To all of these gentlemen the National Museum offers its
sincere thanks for their services during the year.

U. 8. Patent Office—Through the Commissioner of Patents were re-
ceived specifications and patents illustrating the development of pho-
tography and the graphic arts in the United States and in Germany.

Bureau of Education —Hon. N. H. R. Dawson, Commissioner, pre-
sented to the Museum a series of very interesting publications relating
to the subject of American educational history.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

Col. Cecil Clay, chief clerk, collected in Canada and presented to the
Museum the skin and skeleton of a full-grown moose.

POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT.

By the direction of the Postmaster-General, the Superintendent of
the Dead-Letter Office has been requested to inform the Museum of the
receipt in his office of specimens which might be of value to the Mu-
seum collections.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.

Four departments of the Museum are under the charge of specialists
connected with the Department of Agriculture; namely, the Section of
Forestry, Dr. B. E. Fernow, Honorary Curator; Departmentof Inseets,
Prof. C. V. Riley, Honorary Curator; Department of Botany, Dr.
George Vasey, Honorary Curator; and the Section of Foods, Prof. W.
O. Atwater, Honorary Curator.

and California. Dr. Merriam also presented a valuable collection of
birds’ skins from the old world.

The Secretary of Agriculture has expressed his willingness to co-op-
erate with the Museum in the establishment of a Department of For-
estry, and, as already stated, the collection will be under the charge of
Dr. B. E. Fernow.

The Department purchased from Dr. Taylor Townsend a large series
of insects. This has been incorporated in the Museum collection.

Through the courtesy of the Secretary of Agriculture, Dr. George
Vasey has been appointed Honorary Curator of the Department of
Botany in the National Museum, in connection with his duties as_bot-
anist of the Department of Agriculture.

UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION.

The chief source of material contributed during the year by the Fish
Commission has been from the cruise of the U. 8. Fish Commission
steamer Albatross in the West Indies and on the Pacific coast. The
most important accessions to the Museum -resulting from the expedi-
tion are: a large collection of geological and archeological specimens,
coins, mammals, reptiles, batrachians, insects, arachnids and myrio-
pods, birds’-eggs, skeletons of birds, mammals, fossils, plants, lichens,
mosses, fungi, and fossil woods. These were collected during the voyage
from Norfolk, Virginia, to California, in 1887 and 1888. A collection
of birds, reptiles, stone implements, plants, ethnological objects, and
fossil woods was gathered in Alaskan waters. Several reports on these
collections are being prepared by curators in the Museum and will be
published as separate papers, forming parts of Vol. x11, Proceedings
of the National Museum. These will be issued in advance of the bound
volume.

The Commission also transmitted to the Museum twelve living ele-

phant tortoises from the Galapagos Islands, seven living amblystomas,
three painted terrapins, and three specimens of sting-ray fish (Zrygon
centura) from Chesapeake Bay; a collection of fishes made by Prof. C.
H. Gilbert and Dr. J. A. Henshall, from the tributaries of the Ohio
tiver; three Marble cat- fish, collected by Mr. Rogan, of Russellville,
Tennessee, through Col. Marshall McDonald, U. 8S. Commissioner, two
living opossums, and six living turtles; a skin and skeleton of Spotted
porpoise, collected by the Fish Commission schooner Grampus.

Mr. J. Frank Ellis presented four living alligators from Tampa,
Florida.

of Marine Invertebrates; Dr.T. H. Bean, as Honorary Curator of Fishes;
and Capt. J. W. Collins, as Honorary Curator of Naval Architecture,
have been continued through the courtesy of the Commissioner, and a
erateful acknowledgment of the same is here made.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 143

W. Powell, the Department of American Prehistoric Pottery in the
National Museum, which was established several years ago, was placed
under the direction of Mr. W. H. Holmes, who has since acted as Hon-
orary Curator. Through his efforts this department has attained a
prominent place in the development of the work of the National
Museum.

J.—HXPLORATIONS.

The collections of the National Museum have received valuable ad-
ditions through the co-operation of several gentlemen who have offered

:
144 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

to make special researches in its behalf, or who have allowed the Mu
seum to share the results of their explorations. The most important-
of these are here briefly referred to.

Early in the present year Mr. Talcott Williams, of Philadelphia, vis:
ited the northern part of Africa, and kindly offered in behalf of the
Smithsonian Institution to make special inquiries in regard to the civ-
ilization of the modern Arab and the natural history of the region;
also to collect linguistic specimens. His plan was to go direct to
Tangiers, thence to Fez and Mequinez, continuing, if possible, as far
as Mogador and Morocco. Mr. Williams’s knowledge of the Arabic
language aided him greatly in his investigations in the country, and
through his endeavors the Institution will no doubt obtain collec-
tions, as well as information, of extreme value. Botany, geology, and
archeology are the special studies to which Mr. Williams intends to
devote himself. At the time of his arrival the North African flora was
in flower, and, as his plan was to travel for two or three weeks on horse-
back, his opportunities in the first direction were excellent. The geol-
ogy of north Africa is imperfectly represented in the National Museum,
therefore characteristic rocks and photographs of features of physical
geology will be of great value. The archeology of this region is, how-
ever, the subject of the highest importance to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and to which Mr. Williams has promised chiefly to direct his
attention. He hopes to visit El Kutel, one of the most striking mono-
lithic remains in north Africa, and other interesting ruins. He has
been furnished with a photographic outfit, photographs and measure-
ments being particularly desired. He has been provided with a com-
plete outfit of instruments for taking observations of temperature and
altitudes. A preliminary report of the work accomplished has been
received in the form of a letter to the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, and is here printed :

TANGIERS, MOROCCO, June 17, 1889.

Sir: I have the honor to make a preliminary report upon the commission intrusted
to me in Morocco.

(1) The collection of musical instruments of north Morocco is, I trust, complete.
It includes every instrument in use, making six stringed instruments, six wind, and
four of percussion, with varieties of each ranging from the rudest bayi whistle to
stringed instruments which require the utmost skill in manufacture. In each instru-
ment the native name and the native names of all its parts have been noted, the pitch
of each string in the stringed and the range of each wind instrument, as tuned and
played by professional native musicians, has been taken and the air and melody of
a native tune played on each instrument has been noted by a competent musician in
our own musical notation.

Aside from this incidental contribution to folk music I know no instance where a
museum catalogue or label gives the particulars I have mentioned of Oriental musical
instruments.

(2) With reference to the Arab tent, I found, after careful examination, that the
Arab tribes whom I visited have been so altered by a semi-sedentary life, living half
and sometimes all the year in one place, and raising grain, that a tent would be mis-
leading and reflect only the current agricultural life of thiscountry, I therefore did
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 145

not procure one. The fringe of unsettled region which separates the true Arab from
settled regions is here a wide one, and this plan of the Museum, which is altogether
feasible, can only be carried out at some point like Aden and the upper Nile, say at
Wady Halfa-Tripoli or near the present work of the Babylonian Expedition, of Penn-
sylvania University, where the true nomad Arab is within a few hours of an Amer-
ican agent. Modification in this type is in rapid progress, and in a few years it will
be too late.

(3) Ihave been able to find but one book in the Berber language in the possession
of an European. Nearly every one, including native scholars and European residents
of long standing, have told me that they have neverheard of one. The utmost Ihave
been able to secure is a leaf or two of an old Berber manuscript on Moslem law, which
is, I think, unique.

(4) A large share of my purchases has therefore been of ‘simple utensils.” A
fulllist, giving in each case the native name of each article, will be transmitted later.
The chief objects I have sought to illustrate are, in brief—

The lamp in ordinary use here is the ‘‘ Roman lamp” form, and I have this from a
rude metal up through a series of elaborate brass forms.

Fires are built in small pots. These range from earthenware shaped by hand,
through successive additions to a tall iron stove.

The preparation of food is illustrated among other phases by a complete set with
samples of the plant used in making cooscoosu, the national dish.

The ground palm, Chamerops humile, plays a most important part in domestic
economy, nowhere noted, and this is illustrated in all stages of its leaf and fiber.

Comb manufactures, giving carpenter’s tools, form a single compact exhibit with
photographs, and this is supplemented by a primitive lathe.

The Fry pottery offers an unusual instance of a local pottery unaffected by modern
methods, and a full set of its patterns are included.

There are also a number of lesser articles, of which an interesting one is the sur-
vival of the wooden sword, unnoticed by any previous traveler.

Three costumes have been purchased: (1) Fry woman; (2) mountaineer man; (3)
mountaineer woman.

In each case the native name of each article is noted, an omission which robs many
museum costumes of an important linguistic value.

I send in addition three hundred species of flowering plants and fossils from three
localities, from none of which have they been collected before.

A small shipment was made from Teheran and another from here will be sent later
of seven boxes and one bundle, the invoice’, etc., of which I have transmitted to Mr.
G. Brown Goode.

146 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

The list which I will also send later will give careful notes on each article. The
notes on the musical instruments may not be sent until I return.

When transportation, etc., is paid, the sum in my hands will be exhausted, and an
account of the same will be duly transmitted.

I am, very respectfully, yours truly,
TALCOTT WILLIAMS.

Hon. 8. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

At the request of Mr. Williams the examination of the contents of
his collections will be deferred until he arrives. In the next report.a
complete list of the collection will probably be published.

Mr. W. W. Rockhill, formerly of the American Legation of Pekin, has
recently undertaken a journey through Thibet, with a view to making a
special study of the ethnology of that region, having already made him-
self familiar with the customs of the natives. The Smithsonian Institu-
tion has supplied him with a barometer and other instruments desired by
him for his journey. His previous investigations have resulted in an
exceedingly valuable collection of objects, illustrating the religious oce-
cupations and amusements of the various peoples in different parts of
China, Thibet, and Turkestan. Among those from Thibet are a number
of prayer-wheels, a divination bowl made from a human skull, a sprink-
ler for holy water, a Lama’s drum, a bell and score-book used in re-
ligious worship, an exercising flute made from a human femur, a rosary
of one hundred and eight beads made from bones of human skulls, a
charm box and sacred books, images and scroll pictures of gods. From
Western China and Mongolia are carved rosaries, and figures of gods
supposed to preside over medicines, riches, ete. From Northern Tur-
kestan is a scroll picture showing the occupations and sports of the
people.

Dr. James Grant Bey, who some years ago established a sanitarium
at Cairo, Egypt, attended the International Medical Congress held in
Washington in 1887, and was much interested in the work of the Na-
tional Museum. He has, since his return to Egypt, devoted his leisure
time to special studies of the arts of the ancient Egyptians. Several
very valuable collections have been received from him, among which
are the following objects: Fifteen fragments of the Egyptian “ Book of
the Dead” in Hieratic, seven water-color sketches of ancient lamps,
many ancient coins of various sorts, a modern Arabic almanac for the
year Hegira 1300, containing autograph, two gold ornaments of Thoth-
mes III, flower of the Nymphaea cerulea, the lotos of Upper Egypt, a
beetle from Thebes, and many other objects of value and interest.

Mr. Jeremiah Curtin was sent, during the summer, by the Bureau of
Ethnology to the Hupa Reservation in California, in order to study the
languages and mythology of the tribes of Indians inhabiting the reser-
vation. The Smithsonian Institution was fortunate enough to secure
the assistance of Mr. Curtin in investigating their arts and industries
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 147

as well. A small sum of money was placed in his hands for the pur-
chase of objects to complete the series of the Museum collection from
this region.

Dr. John M. Crawford, United States Consul-General at St. Peters-
burgh, expects to make extensive ethnological researches in Russia and
Finland, and has generously offered to allow the National Museum to
participate in the results. Dr. Crawford is well known as the author of
the English translation of the Finnish epic ‘‘The Kalevala,” as a philol-
ogist and a student of Scandinavian antiquities. His acquirements in
these directions led to his being appointed Consul-General at St. Peters-
burgh, from which place he would be able to carry on his studies of the
Finnish race, and related peoples. Letters of introduction to several
correspondents in Russia and Finland, have been furnished by the
Smithsonian Institution iv order to facilitate his work.

Rey. Frederick H. Post, late rector of St. Paul’s Church, Salem, Ore-
gon, has recently assumed charge of the mission of the Episcopal
Church at Anvik on the Yukon River, Alaska. He is. very much inter-
ested in the study of natural science and history, and has offered to
serve the Smithsonian Institution in collecting information relating to
the tribes of the Upper Yukon, and also in transmitting to the Museum
specimens of the mammals and birds of that region. It is probable
that Mr. Post will, next year, be furnished with an outfit of alcohol,
guns, and ammunition.

Lient. J. F. Moser, commanding the U.S. Coast Survey steamer Bache,
has continued his explorations for the Museum and has sent a collection
of fishes, mollusks, insects, and marine invertebrates from the vicinity
of Cape Sable, Florida.

Prof. O. P. Jenkins, of De Pauw University, Indiana, proposes to visit
the Hawaiian Islands during the summer for the purpose of collecting
fishes, and has kindly offered to present a duplicate series of specimens
to the Museum. ‘To aid him in this undertaking the Smithsonian Insti-
tution has supplied him with seines, giving Lim also a letter of intro-
duction to the curator of the National Museum in Honolulu.

During the summer of 1888, Mr. George P. Merrill, Curator of Geology,
made a collecting trip to North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New York, Ver-
mont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Maine. Large collections
of rock were obtained for the Museum.

Mr, Thomas Wilson, Curator of Prehistoric Anthropology, visited

mounds in Ohio, and made interesting collections.
_ In August Dr. W.F. Hillebrand, of the U. S. Geological Survey, vis-
ited some of the Western States ana Territories, partly with a view to
making collections of minerals. These will eventually be incorporated
with the Museum collections. '

In order to further the work of those who have expressed their willing-
ness to collect specimens for the Museum, as well as those who have been
sent ouf as collectors by the Museum, outfits of apparatus, tanks, al-
148 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

cohol, ete., have been supplied. During the year the outfits here indi- |

cated have been furnished to the following-named collectors:

Tess:

August 3.—Mr. W. A. Stearns, of Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, was supplied with
a large outfitof tanks, dredge-nets, tin tags, pig bladders, bottles, vials, cheese-cloth,
heavy paper, and a double-barrel shot-gun, for use in collecting natural history speci-
mens for the National Museum in northern Labrador. It has been found necessary
to postpone this expedition until next summer.

December 19.—Lieut. J. F. Moser, commanding the U. 8. Coast Survey steamer
Bache, has been furnished with tanks, packing-boxes, jars, etc. He has transmitted
a coilection of fishes, mollusks, insects, and marine invertebrates to the National
Museum from the vicinity of Cape Sable, Florida, and has kindly signified his will-
ingness to make additional collections, as opportunity may offer.

1889.

January 15.—Capt. W. L. Carpenter, who for many years has sent to the Smith-
sonian Institution collections of natural history specimens, is uow stationed at Pres-
cott, Arizona. He has kindly promised to continue his efforts in behalf of the Museum,
in collecting fishes, reptiles, marine invertebrates, etc., for the preservation of which
tanks and alcohol have been furnished.

January 18.—Lieut. E. H. Taunt, of Washington, District of Columbia, has offered
to coilect mineral specimens in connection with his cruise to the Congo River, South
Africa. He has been supplied with a photographic apparatus by the Smithsonian
Institution,

February 4.—Dr. L. F. H. Birt, of Greytown, Nicaragua, Central America, having
in the past sent large collections of mammals, reptiles, fishes, birds, etc., to the
National Museum, has been supplied with tanks and alcohol for the continuance of
hisservices. Dr. Birt proposes to direct his attention later to the fishes and crustacea
of the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts of this country, the results of which he will share
with the Smithsonian Institution.

March 28.—Lieut. W. L. Howard, of San Francisco, California, offered to collect
fishes and ethnological objects in Alaska for the Smithsonian Institution. To aid
him in this undertaking the Institution has supplied him with tanks, alcohol and
trade-supplies.

May 22.—An outfit of alcohol, a gun, and ammunition was supplied to Mr. I. C.
Russell, of San Francisco, California, to aid him in his Alaska Expedition. The
Alaska Commercial Company also afforded facilities to Mr. Russell, introducing him
to its agent at St. Michael.

May 27.—Hon. Charles Bartlett, United States consul at Guadaloupe, West Indies,
sent a number of brilliantly luminous insects, among them the ‘“Cuenjo” (Pyropho-
rus noctilucus) for purposes of analysis. A number of insect-boxes were sent to him,
and also to Senor José C, Zeledon of San José, Costa Rica, and Sefior Ferrari Perez,
City of Mexico, for the same purpose.

June 8.—Tanks and alcohol were sent to Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, of Tacoma, District
of Columbia, in which place, he states, the opportunity is excellent to collect a num-
ber of embryo birds, many of which will greatly assist him in working out the mor-
phology of the group. Dr. Shufeldt kindly offers to collect specimens for the National
Museum.

June 11.—An outfit of tanks, alcohol, and shellac was sent to Mr. Frank Burns, of —

the U. 8. Geological Survey.
James Mooney, of Cherokee, North Carolina, was supplied with tanks and alcohol.
No collections haye as yet been received.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 149

Mr. C. R. Orcutt, of San Diego, California, has, from time to time, transmitted to
the National Museum yaluable collections of fishes, reptiles, fossils, marine inverte-
brates, ete., from California. During the past year he has been supplied with tanks,
aleohol, jars, and a seine for this purpose.

Mr. W. Harvey Brown, of the National Museum, was appointed naturalist to ac-
company the United States Eclipse Expedition to South Africa. Being in the employ
of the Smithsonian Institution he was furnished with a large outfit of tanks, alcohol,
jars, oil, linen, and tools. It is probable that the next report will contain an account
of the results of this expedition.

June 13.—Prof. O. P. Jenkins, of De Pauw University, Indiana, intends to visit the
Hawaiian Islands, and has been supplied with seines to aid him in collecting fishes,
a duplicate set of which he has expressed his intention of presenting to the National
Museum.

December 29.—Dr. John I. Northrup received an outfit of tanks and alcohol to use
during his visit to the Bahama Islands, where he expects to collect plants and ani-
mals, especially marine invertebrates and fishes. He offers to present a duplicate set
of specimens to the Smithsonian Institution.

K.—REPORTS UPON THE PARTICIPATION OF THE SMITH-
SONIAN INSTITUTION AND THE NATIONAL MUSEUM
IN THE EXPOSITIONS HELD AT CINCINNATI AND
MARIETTA IN 1888.

Letter from the Assistant Secretary to the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, relating to the participation of the Institution in the Cin-
cinnati Exposition.

MAy 7, 1888.

Sir: I have the honor to report that all work in connection with the
participation of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum
in the Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States,
held in Cincinnati in 1888, has now been completed. All objects sent
to Cincinnati have been returned to their proper places and damages
suffered by specimens and furniture have been repaired to as great
an extent as has been found practicable under the arbitrary and un-
usually stringent rulings of the Treasury officials in charge of the dis-
bursements and account.

I transmit herewith a report (Appendix A) upon the Smithsonian
participation in the Exposition, which has been prepared by Mr. R.
Edward Earll, who was placed in charge of the administrative work at
Cincinnati, it having been impossibie for me to be absent from Wash-
ington during the continuance of the Exposition, and who performed
the responsible and difficult duties of his position in an exceedingly
efficient and faithful manner.

In his report a history of our work is given, and also a history of
what was done by the various departments of the Museum and by the
Bureau of Ethnology. In addition to what is stated in this report, ref-
erence should be made to the willing and efficient aid rendered by the
_ curators of the Museum, who prepared a very instructive and impres-
sive collection in a remarkably short time, notwithstanding the fact
150 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

that the work was done in the hottest part of the summer. Prof. Otis _
T. Mason contributed a comprehensive ethnological collection, Mr.

Thomas Wilson a synoptical series of objects, illustrating prehistorie

anthropology, the remains of primitive man in the new world and the

old being shown side by side. Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, who was detailed

for this work by the director of the Bureau of Ethnology, prepared a

display of the arts and architectures of the Pueblo Indians of the south-
west. Dr. Cyrus Adler selected from the treasures of the section oi

Oriental Antiquities an exhibit of Biblical archeology.

The history of transportation by land and water was happily and suc-
cessfully shown by Mr. J. E.Watkins, who received most important aid
from the Baltimore and Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad Companies,
anda supplementary display of models of ships and boats was arranged
by Capt. J.W. Collins. Mr. S. R. Koehler, with great energy and en-
thusiasm, brought together a most instructive collection, illustrating
the history and methods of the graphie arts, supplementing the collec-
tions already in the Museum by loans from his private collection and
from those of his friends and correspondents. Mr. T. W. Smillie
gathered a similar collection to illustrate the history and present condi-
tion of theart of photography. .Mr. F. W. True, assisted by Mr. F. A.
Lueas, prepared a collection showing the classification of mammals.
Mr. W. T. Hornaday, by means of specimens and pictures, preached a
sermon upon the extermination of the native animals of North America.
Mr. Robert Ridgway exhibited an attractive collection of birds; Prof.
C. V. Riley, aided by Mr. John B. Smith, prepared a collection showing
the classification of North American insects. Dr. R. E. ©. Stearns and
Mr. Rathbun contributed a few cases from the departments of Mollusks
and Marine Invertebrates. Mr. F. H. Knowlton prepared an exhibit
from the botanical collections, and Mr. W.S. Yeates, under the super-
vision of Professor Clarke, arranged a case of North American gems
and precious stones. <All of these contributions are, as I have said,
somewhat fully described in Mr. Earll’s report, and this passing refer-
ence is made solely for the sake of making proper acknowledgment to
those to whom the success of our work at Cincinnati is entirely due. —

Special reference should be made to the work of Mr. W. V. Cox, who
in addition to his regular duties in the Museum, undertook the financial
administration of the work and carried through without a single disal-
lowance from the Treasury the complicated and perplexing expenditures
of the exposition’s service. This was a task of much difficulty owing to
the loose wording of the Congressional act providing for the participa-
tion of the Government departments, and still more to the capricious and
unprecedented decisions of the special auditor appointed by the Presi-
dent to audit the exposition accounts. In this work Mr. W. W. Karr,
who also rendered volunteer service, and Mr. W. H. Kimball, were ex-
ceedingly faithful coadjutors.

Mr. Cox was also charged with the preparation of a special display to

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 151

be sent to the Exposition at Marietta, Ohio, a report upon which, pre-
pared by him, is hereto appended (Appendix Bb).

In conclusion I submit a brief review of the financial history of the
work.

The entire appropriation for the Smithsonian Institution, National
Museum, and U. 8. Commission of Fish and Fisheries, for the Centen-
nial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States, as mentioned in
the act of Congress authorizing the same, was $50,000. Of this amount
the sum of $10,000, by agreement between the Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution and the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries, was set
apart for the use of the Commission, leaving $40,000 to cover all ex-
penditures of the Smithsonian and Museum for the purchase of new
material to complete series as well as all charges for services, and for the
transportation and subsistence of employés sent to Cincinnati and Mar-
ietta for the preparation, installation, and maintenance of exhibit.

The first step was the preparation of an estimate of probable expendi-
tures, leaving a general contingent fund of about $4,000, which was set
aside to be drawn upon when necessary.

The act of Congress making the appropriation did not become a law
until May 28, and the exposition was to be opened on the 4th of July.
It therefore became necessary to make our selections and purchases
with all possible haste. The Museum schedule rates were, however,
taken advantage of when practicable. In cases where this could not
be done, and where the amount involved was considerable, when the
articles were such as are usually found in the market, competitive bids
were obtained. The expense of this hurried work was proportionately
great, and a considerable waste of time and effort was inevitable.

This extra exposition work crowded into the hot summer months
made it necessary for the chief clerk and his assistants to be at their
desks early and late, a demand which they cheerfully complied with,
giving up their much needed vacations in order to keep up their regular
and extra duties.

Vouchers had to be prepared in quadruplicate, one copy for the
Smithsonian files, one for the special auditor, one for the disbursing
officer, and one for the Treasury Department. This involved much
clerical work, as the number of original vouchers was over three hun-
dred, making it necessary, in order to fulfill all requirements, to pre-
pare a total of more than twelve hundred copies of vouchers.

While the nature and amount of the disbursements could not be ex-
actly determined in advance, it is gratifying to be able to report that a
provisional schedule of classified expenditures, which was prepared in
the beginning, was at least approximately correct, and would have been
still more accurate but for the postponement of the time of closing the
Exposition. As it is, the contingent fund of $4,000 more than covers
all differences between estimated and actual expenditures.

Although the Exposition was closed as long ago a3 November 8, 1888,
152 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

our accounts only became ready for final settlement on April 15, 1889.
This delay was in part due to the fact that the regular routine of for-
warding, signing, and returning the vouchers for articles purchased in
foreign countries, necessarily consumed much time. Delay has also
been caused by the retention and questioning of many vouchers in the
office of the special auditor of Cincinnati accounts at the Treasury De-
partment, although in every case his objections have been finally with-
drawn, and all vouchers have, after protracted delays, been approved
by that official. These delays, which seemed to us quite unnecessary,
caused us much annoyance, as many of those who had furnished mate-
rials or labor, almost daily, either in person or by letter, urged upon us
their need of funds and the great inconvenience they were compelled
to undergo by the delays which were entirely beyond our control, but
for which they were disposed to hold us responsible.

The Auditor raised many trivial points, which necessitated the writing
of numerous letters in answer to uncalled for questions. This, together
with long waiting for replies, which were usually transmitted verbally
by aclerk, has greatly impeded action. In view of this experience it is
urged that, should Congress decide to have the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and National Museum participate in future expositions, the law beso
framed as to require the appointment of an auditing officer familiar with
the demands of exhibition work, in order to prevent the unnecessary
retardment of public business, and the consequent incurring of extra
expense by the Government.

If such a course be not adopted, responsibility of selecting and decid-
ing upon exhibits should be understood to rest entirely with the repre-
sentatives of the various departments, and the auditor’s province lim-
‘ited to the careful examination of accounts, which, of course, should be
sufficiently detailed to prevent errors. Experience has proved that
only by some similar division of responsibility can successful results be
obtained.

Another fruitful cause of delay in our work has been the payment of
all the accounts by a disbursing officer stationed at Newport, Kentucky,
instead of Washington, where, as is always the case, nine-tenths of the
bills are contracted. The paymaster drew checks upon the Cincinnati
depository only, a method very unjust to employés and workmen, who
were obliged to wait many days before receiving their checks, and then
to lose something of their hard earned money by the refusal of the
Treasury in Washington to honor the same. The only alternative for
them was to present the checks to local banks, paying the usual dis-
count rates.

APPENDIX “AC

REPORT UPON THE EXHIBIT OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, INCLUDING THE U. 8.
NATIONAL MUSEUM, AT THE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION OF THE OHIO VALLEY AND CEN-
TRAL STATES, HELD AT CINCINNATI, OHIO, IN 1888.

By R. EDWARD EARLL.
1. HISTORY OF THE MOVEMENT.

The series of industrial exhibitions which culminated in the recent
Centennial Exposition at Cincinnati had their origin in the annual fairs
of the Ohio Mechanics’ Institute. These fairs, though limited in scope,
and depending largely both for their exhibits and patronage on the im-
mediate vicinity, were very successful. They were held regularly for
about twenty years prior to the war of the rebellion, but owing to the
nearness of the city to hostile territory it became neeessary to tempo-
rarily abandon them during this period. When revived in 1868 it was
decided to greatly enlarge their scope. The Mechanics’ Institute invited
the co-operation of both the Chamber of Commerce and the Board of
Trade, the result being the Cincinnati Annual Industrial Exposition,
with a board of fifteen directors consisting of five representatives from
each of the bodies named. The expositions, which from that date were
held almost yearly, met with much encouragement, not only from the
local population, but from residents of other portions of Ohio and of the
adjoining States. This encouragement led to the erection of perma-
nent buildings in the center of the city at a cost of more than a million
dollars.

As early as 1883 it was decided that the exposition for the centennial
year (1888) should exceed any of those previously held, and that an
attempt should be made to show the progress ‘‘ of art, science, and in-
dustry” in the States comprising the original Northwest Territory dur-
ing the first century of their occupation by civilized man. This was
in accord with the action taken at the semi-centennial celebration of
the settlement of Cincinnati in 1838, when a committee was appointed
to see that “the one-hundredth anniversary of the settlement of Cin-
cinnati, occurring in 1888, be properly celebrated.” An organization
was soon perfected and plans developed for holding “ the Centennial
Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States,” including * the States
of the Northwest Territory and those which border upon the Ohio and
even farther to the south.” After considerable discussion it was de-
cided, in view of the central location of the permanent buildings, that

154
—
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 155

these should be used as a nucleus, and that additional space be secured
for the erection of other buildings. Application was made to the board
of public affairs, which granted the use of Washington Park on the east,
and of certain streets bordering the Miami Canal on the west. In this
way floor space aggregating 400,000 square feet, with 142,500 additional
feet of wall space, was secured in the heart of the city. To place the
project on a sound financial basis a guaranty fund of $1,050,000 was
raised among the citizens of Cincinnati.

The movement was indorsed by the city councils of Cincinnati, Cov-
ington, and Newport, and by the Ohio State legislature, which author-
ized the appointment of honorary commissioners, voted a small sum of
money for State representation, and directed the governor, in behalf of
the State, to invite ‘‘ the assistance and co-operation of the Federal Gov-
ernment, our sister States, and especially the Central States of West Vir-
ginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Illinois, and Michi-
gan, and that they be requested to appoint five honorary commissioners
each to assist in the organization and carrying on of this Centennial Ex-
position.” These States passed formal resolutions of acceptance and
appointed honorary commissioners, but, as a rule, little was attempted
in the way of preparing State exhibits.

Copies of the resolutions extending an invitation to the Federal Gov-
ernment were sent to the President and to Congress; and after con-
siderable delay the initiative was taken by the Appropriations Committee
of the House of Representatives, the chairman of which addressed let-
ters to the heads of the several Departments with a view to ascertaining
what could be done, and the amount of money needed by each for mak-
ing a suitabie display. This correspondence resulted in the draughting
of a bill by members of said committee, which, after slight amendment,
passed both Houses of Congress and received the President’s signature.
The bill as passed read as follows:

AN ACT making an appropriation to enable the several Executive Departments of the Government
and the Bureau of Agriculture and the Smithsonian Institution, including the National Museum
and Commission of Fish and Fisheries, to participate in the Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Val-

ley and Central States, to be held at Cincinnati, Ohio, from July fourth to October twenty-seventh,
eighteen hundred and eighty-eight.

Whereas the States which comprise the Northwest Territory and the adjacent
States will hold at Cincinnati, Ohio, from July fourth to October twenty-seventh,
eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, a centennial exposition commemorative of the
organization of the Northwest Territory under the ordinance of seventeen hundred
and eighty-seven, in which exposition all the States and Territories of the United
States and the GeneralGovernment have been invited to participate, the object being
in said exposition to present a panorama of the nation’s resources and present state of
progressive development, by an exhibition of the products of agriculture, of the
various industries and fine arts; also the results of advancement made in the sciences ;
the whole illustrating the opportunities secured to and the possibilities which wait
upon the citizens of this Republic; and

Whereas the citizens of the Ohio Valley and the several States adjacent thereto
have made suitable and adequate preparation and arrangements for holding said ex-
position, and are desirous,and it being fit and proper, that the several Executive
Departments of the Government, the Department of Agriculture, the Smithsonian
156 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

Institution, including the National Museum and Commission of Fish and Fisheries,
should participate in said exhibition: Therefore,

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress assembled, That the head of each of the several Executive De-
partments of the Government, the Commissioner of Agriculture, and the Smithsonian
Institution, including the National Museum, and Commission of Fish and Fisheries,
under the direction of the President of the United States, be, and they are hereby,
authorized and directed to prepare and make suitable exhibits at the said Centennial
Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States to be held at Cincinnati, beginning
on the fourth of July, and closing October twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred and
eighty-eight.

That there shall be appointed a committee of Congress composed of ten members,
five to be appointed by the President of the Senate and five by the Speaker of the
House of Representatives. Said committee is authorized and directed to visit said
exposition, and make such report to Congress in that behalf as they may deem need-
ful and proper: Provided, That the President may, in the exercise of his discretion,
allow such documents and exhibits as relate to early settlement at Marietta, Ohio,
and the establishment of civil government in the Territory Northwest of the Ohio
River, to be taken to Marietta and exhibited during the time from July fifteenth to
nineteenth, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, inclusive, under such restrictions and
custody as he may direct.

That to enable the several Executive Departments of the Government, the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and the Smithsonian Institution, including the National
Museum and the Commission of Fish and Fisheries, to participate in said exposition
to be held as aforesaid, there is hereby appropriated out of any money in the Treasury
not otherwise appropriated one hundred and forty-seven thousand seven hundred
and fifty dollars, apportioned as follows:

For the War Department, seven thousand one hundred and fifty dollars

For the Navy Department, fifteen thousand dollars.

For the State Department, two thousand five hundred dollars.

For the Treasury Department, seven thousand five hundred dollars.

For the Interior Department, thirty-six thousand one hundred dollars.

For the Department of Agriculture, twenty thousand dollars.

For the Post-Office Department, five thousand dollars,

For the Department of Justice, two thousand dollars.

For the Smithsonian Institution, including the Commission of Fish and Fisheries,
fifty thousand dollars.

For the expenses of the committee of Congress, two thousand five hundred dollars.

That the President may, if in his judgment it shall be deemed necessary and expe-
dient in order to secure the best results with greatest economy, transfer a part of the
fund hereby apportioned to one Department or Bureau to another Department or Bu-
reau. The term Bureau wherever used herein shall be construed to include the Agri-
cultural Department, the Smithsonian Institution, and Commission of Fish and
Fisheries.

That the President of the United States is hereby authorized to detail an officer of
the pay department of the Army or Navy to disburse the fund appropriated by this
act.

The payments on account of the expenses incurred in carrying out and into effect
the provisions hereof shall be made on itemized vouchers approved by the représenta-
tive of the Department incurring the liability, and a person to be designated by the
President to make final audit of said accounts: Provided, That payment of the ex-
penses incurred by the committee of Congress shall be made on vouchers approved
by the chairman of said committee.

That the head of each of said Executive Departments and of the Department of
Agriculture, Smithsonian Institution, and Commission of Fish and Fisheries shall,
from among the officers or employees thereof, appoint a suitable person to act as rep-
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 157

resentative of such Department or Bureau, and said representative shall, under the
direction and control of the head of the Department or Bureau, supervise the prepa-
ration and conduct of the exhibits herein provided for.

That no officer or employee appointed as aforesaid shall be paid extra or additional
compensation by reason of services rendered in virtue of such employment; but noth-
ing herein shall be so construed as to prevent the payment of the just and reasonable
expenses of any committee, officer, or employee appointed or employed under or by
virtue of the provisions of this act.

That all articles imported from the Republic of Mexico or the Dominion of Canada
for the purpose of being exhibited at said exposition shall be admitted free of duty,
subject, however, to such conditions and regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury
may impose and prescribe.

Approved May 28, 1888.

Shortly after the passage of the above bill the President, in accord-
ance with its requirements, designated one of the officials of the Treas-
ury Department as special auditor. This gentleman at the outset
questioned the right of the various Departments under the act to pur-
chase any specimens for the completion of their exhibits, claiming that
the collections must be made up of materials already on hand. This
necessitated further action on the part of Congress which took the
shape of a joint resolution declaring the meaning of the act. The reso-
lution read as follows:

JOINT RESOLUTION declaring the true intent and meaning of the act approved May twenty-eighth,
eighteen hundred and eighty-eight.

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That it is the true intent and meaning of the act of Congress
approved May twenty-eighth, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, by the President of
the United States, entitled ‘‘An act making appropriation to enable the several
Executive Departments of the Government, and the Bureau of Agriculture, and the
Smithsonian Institution, including the National Museum, and the Commission of Fish
and Fisheries, to participate in the Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Cen-
tral States to be held at Cincinnati, Ohio, from July fourth, to October twenty-seventh,
eighteen hundred and eighty-eight,” that the President of the United States may, in
his discretion make an order directing that any documents, papers, maps, not origi-
nal, books or other exhibits which properly and pertinently relate to the establish-
ment of civil government in the territory northwest of the Ohio River, may be sent
upon an Executive order from any of the several Departments in said act named, or
from the exhibits now at Cincinnati; and that the appropriation of money in said
act to defray the expenses of such exhibits, may be made applicable, in so far as the
President of the United States may direct, to the payment of the expenses, of the care,
transportation to, and return of, such exhibits from Marietta. And the same shall be
paid from such fund heretofore set apart for each Department as the President may
order. Nor shall anything in said act be so construed as to prevent the purchase of
suitable materials, and the employment of proper persons, to complete or modify
series of objects, and classes of specimens, when in the judgment of the head of any
Department, such purchase or employment or both is necessary in the proper prepara-
tion and conduct of an exhibit. Nor to authorize the removal from their places of
deposit in Washington of any original paper or document or laws or ordinances what-
ever.

Approved, July 16, 1888.

The original bill received the President’s approval May 28th and on
the following day in accordance with its requirements the Secretary of
-158 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

the Smithsonian Institution appointed Dr. G. Brown Goode the Assist-
ant Secretary in charge of the U.S. National Museum, as its represent-
ative.

The item of $50,000, appropriated for the Smithsonian institution in the
pill, included the U.S. Fish Commission, and, by an agreement with the
Commissioner of Fisheries, $10,000 was set apart for the use of said Com-
mission, leaving $40,000 to be expended under the direction of the Insti-
tution. As little more than a month remained before the exposition was
to open, it was impossible for the Smithsonian, or, in fact, for any of the
Departments to prepare suitable exhibits, ship them to Cincinnati, and
have them properly installed by the opening day. However, as no time
was to be lost, a meeting of the representatives of the various Depart-
ments was called with a view to the organization of a board, and the set-
tlement of questions relating to the amount and location of the space
to be assigned to each Department. At the first conference it was found
that at least 100,000 square feet of floor space would be required to accom-
modate the exhibits which the several representatives proposed send-
ing, but upon inquiry it was learned that the exposition officials, owing
to the delay in the passage of the bill, and to the uncertainty as to the
final action upon it, as well as to their lack of information concerning
the amount of space required by the Government, had reserved only
one short wing of the park building, aggregating about 13,000 square
feet, for its use, the remainder having already been assigned to private
exhibitors. As this amount was wholly inadequate, they at once con-
sented to erect additional buildings in the park adjacent to, and com-
municating with, the wing already reserved. But as the unoccupied
space in the park was limited, it was impossible, notwithstanding their
very generous disposition, to find room for new buildings of sufficient
size to furnish the additional accommodations desired. It was finally
decided to erect two annexes, one on either side of the Government
wing of the main building, and in this way 29,000 feet additional were
secured making a total of about 42,000 square feet available for the use
of the Government.

This space was divided approximately as follows:

It will thus be seen that the space oceupied by each Department
was very much less than that desired, in some cases only a little
more than one-third of the amount asked being assigned.

2. PREPARATION AND INSTALLATION OF THE SMITHSONIAN EXHIBIT.

Immediately on his appointment Dr. Goode commenced active op-
erations. He soon outlined an exhibit which would require at least
20,000 feet of floor space, and it was not until the work was well under
way that it became known that only 12,000 feet could be secured. This
necessitated considerable change in the plans, and it was finally decided
to omit entirely certain subjects and to substitute pictures and models
for the more bulky specimens in other groups, in order to bring the
exhibit within the space assigned.

In deciding upon the general character of the exhibit and the sub-
jects to be represented, he was governed largely by the objects of the
exposition as set forth in the preamble to the bill—viz: “To present a
panorama of the nation’s resources and present state of progressive
development, by an exhibition of the products of agriculture, of the
various industries and fine arts; also the results of advancement made
in the sciences; the whole illustrating the opportunities secured to and
the possibilities which wait upon the citizens of this Republic.”

As the National Museum has an averageattendance of about 300,000
visitors yearly, it was necessary that its interests also should be consid-
ered; and it was decided to interfere as little as possible with those
departments, the exhibits of which were fairly complete and properly
arranged, but in so far as might be practicable, to select the specimens
for Cincinnati from the newer departments, and from theduplicate ma-
terials, and to secure from other sources such additional articles as
might be necessary to complete the exhibits, By this plan the eduea-
tional value of the Museum was largely preserved, and its most inter-
esting series were left intact for comparison and study byits numerous
visitors.

Having outlined, in a general way, the plan of the exhibit, Dr.
Goode called to his aid the curators of the several Museum depart-
ments which were to be represented. These officials were charged with
the responsibility of preparing the necessary collections for their respect-
ive departments; and, as only four weeks remained before the opening
of the exposition, they were obliged to neglect their regular museum
duties and to devote their entire time and energies to the Cincinnati
work. A large force of laborers and mechanics was at once employed
in packing such articles as were ready for shipment, and in mounting
specimens, making models, cases, and other necessary articles, while
the curators busied themselves with the selection and arrangement of
the available museum specimens, and in securing such new material as
was required for completing the collections under their charge.

The first car-load of exhibits left on June 22, and others followed in
rapid succession, so that by the 30th of the month eight of the twelve
car-loads had been forwarded, all of the remainder, with the exception
of the photographie exhibit, which was of necessity considerably delayed,

leaving by the 12th of July.
160 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

To save time, articles obtained from other parts of the country and
from abroad, were sent direct to Cincinnati without coming to Wash-
ington at all.

Owing to the departure of Professor Langley for Europe, in June,
for an absence of some months, the duties of Acting Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution devolved upon Dr. Goode. This rendered it
quite impossible for him to go to Cincinnati, and the writer was desig-
nated deputy representative. He left Washington in company with
Mr. James S. Morrill, who was to act as clerk, on the 26th of June,
arriving in Cincinnati the following day. He was soon joined by a
number of the Museum curators who came on to superintend the instal-
lation of their respective exhibits. About the same time Mr. Henry
Horan arrived with several skilled mechanics and laborers to assist
in the general work.

The space assigned to the Semcon was located in the northern
annex to the park building near the Race street entrance. It consisted
of a rectangular space 125 feet long by 95 feet wide, an uninterrupted
wall space 13 feet high, extending along one entire side, this being
practically continued around the remainder of the area by means of
partitions which were built to separate it from the adjoining departments.
This gave a floor space of 11,875 square feet with about 6,000 additional
feet of wall space, the latter being increased to over 10,000 feet by
means of screens and partition, which it was found desirable to put up.
After setting off a strip 174 feet wide through the center of the space
in its longest direction for a main aisle or thoroughfare, the remainder

was assigned to the sectional exhibits as follows:
Square feet.

The first four car-loads of exhibits reached the exposition on the 28th
of June, but, as the annex in which they were to be placed was not com-
pleted, they were temporarily stored on adjoining space in the main
building. Two days later the workmen completed the annex and the
boxes were at once moved into it. Forty-five men, including the Wash-~
ington party, were soon at work unpacking and arranging the exhibits,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 161

and while it was wholly impossibie to have everything ready for the
opening day an effort was made to have the installation as far advanced
as possible, and by working early and late the work was rapidly ad-
vanced, so that by 10.30 on the morning of July 4, when at the request
of the Commissioners work was temporarily suspended, enough had
been accomplished to give the visitor an idea of the character of the
exhibit, and of what might be expected when finally completed. Equal
activity prevailed in the other departments, and though none had their
collections permanently installed, the progress made was very gratify-
ing. After the opening ceremonies were over, work was resumed, and as
the articles arrived, they were rapidly put in place, but owing to soot
which filled the air and settled upon the exhibits in such quantities as
to seriously injure them, and also to the tendency of the visitors to
handle the specimens, it became necessary to put many articles under
glass, which otherwise would have remained uncovered. In this way
the work of installation was somewhat prolonged, and it was more than
four weeks before it was fully completed, though the public was ad-
mitted to all of the Government departments during the progress of
the work.

The private exhibits in the various classes were as a rule in place on
the opening day, and all of the available space was occupied.

The Exposition, while in every way creditable to the management, did
not receive that support from the public which its merits justified. The
attendance during the first two months, possibly owing somewhat to
the warm weather and the demands upon the time of the agricultural
classes during the harvest season, was very light. However, as the
weeks passed, it gradually improved, and during the months of Septem-
ber and October was fairly satisfactory; but the lack of co-operation
on the part of the railroads unquestionably had a marked influence on
the attendance of people residing at a distance. Thinking that possibly
the high price of admission had kept many away, it was decided to con-
tinue the exposition for a few days beyond the 27th of October, which was
the time set for closing, and to reduce the entrance fee to 25 cents, thus
giving all classes the opportunity of seeing and studying the exhibits.
But this did not result in any marked increase in the number of vis-
itors, and when the doors were finally closed to the publi¢ on November
8, the turnstiles showed a total attendance of only 1,055,276, or an aver-
age of 9,593 daily, as against a daily attendance of 55,061 at Philadel-
phia in 1876. It was, however, considerably in excess of the daily
attendance at New Orleans in 1885, which averaged (Sundays included)
only 6,438. When it is remembered that Cincinnati is in the center of
@ very prosperous country, with a population of nearly five millions of
people within easy access, the figures are certainly far below what
might reasonably have been expected. Yet it should not be inferred
that the Exposition was a failure, for the visitors as a rule appeared to
be greatly interested, and the collections were studied with very great

care by various classes, notably by students from the institutions of
learning in Ohio and adjoining States, and the educational influence
upon these can not be overestimated.

Governmental participation in the expositions of the past has usually
been urged on the ground of the great educational value of such under-
takings to the intelligent visitors. No one who has given the slightest
thought to this subject or who has observed the crowds in their examina-
tion of the collections, will for a moment deny this, nor will they fail to dis--
cover that the exhibits ofthe General Government attract by far the most
attention. If these departmental exhibits, when properly installed in
Washington, were accessible to all, there would certainly be no excuse
for ever sending them to other localities ; but as such a vast majority
of the people of the country never visit the National Capital, the prac-
tice of sending educational collections to the larger centers of population
is perhaps justifiable.

On November 8, the day set for closing, a party of eight arrived from
Washington to assist in the work of packing the exhibits. It consisted
of Mr. F. A. Lucas, who was to superintend the packing of the natural
history collections, and Mr. Horan, who, with six skilled workmen, was
to assist in the general work. A number of local mechanics and laborers
were also employed and the work of packing was vigorously pushed.
Five car-loads of exhibits were ready for shipment on the 20th of the
month, and others were forwarded at intervals during the next two
weeks, the last starting on December 4. They arrived with less than
the usual amount of breakage, and by the middle of the following Feb-
ruary, a very large percentage of them had been unpacked, repaired, and
returned to their places in the Museum collections.

In accordance with the provision of the law, the President on July 11,
authorized the sending of an exhibit to Marietta, Ohio. Most of the
material for this exhibit was sent direct from Washington, though a few
articles were forwarded from the collections at Cincinnati. This collec-
tion was under the direction of Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk of the Mu-
seum, who has prepared a detailed report on the subject.

&. REVIEW OF THE SMITHSONIAN EXHIBIT.

The collective exhibit of the Smithsonian was, as already intimated,
made up of separate collections prepared by the curators of several of the
departments of the Museum. The general display may be divided into
three groups, namely: Anthropological exhibits, natural history col-
lections, and series belonging to the department of arts and indus-
tries. A detailed description of the separate exhibits, or in fact, even
a list of the objects exhibited, would extend this paper far beyond the
proper limit. It, however, seems desirable to give a brief statement of
the general character of the exhibits of the various sections. Such a
statement will be found in the following pages, When fuller informa-

tion is desired, it can be found in the reports of the curators, under
whose direction the separate exhibits were prepared.

SECTION OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY.

Mr. Thomas Wilson, Curator of Prehistoric Anthropology, was re-
quested to prepare an exhibit which should illustrate the methods em-
ployed in the study of prehistoric man, and the present state of our
knowledge of his manners and customs, and of his geographical distri-
bution during the different periods. To accomplish this purpose, he
selected about two thousand specimens which would best represent man’s
progress during the early centuries of his existence. These included
objects from all parts of the world. They were arranged in continuous
series in cases placed end to end to represent the stream of time during
the prehistoric ages. The entire series of cases was divided longitudi-
nally, each separate division being devoted to a different country or group
of countries. At the top was Great Britain, next below came France
and Belgium, then Italy, Switzerland, the Scandinavian countries, Asia,
Africa, Oceanica, and at the bottom the United States. Perpendicular
divisions were also made to represent the various epochs of prehistoric
civilization. By this arrangement it was easy to compare the progress
of man in the different countries, and to show the variations in the im-
plements used in each. Special attention was given to demonstrating
that our own country was inhabited during the earliest periods. This
was done by the exhibition of large series of specimens similar in all
important particulars to those belonging to the earlier epochs from the
Old World.

The collection began with the Chellian epoch, when man used but
one implement, a crudely chipped stone, and followed down through
the different divisions of the stone age, then through the age of
bronze to that of iron, showing clearly the steps in human progress from
a lower to a higher civilization. Charts showing the distribution of pre-
historic man and the location of his settlements during different epochs
were exhibited ; also drawings and models of the Swiss Lake dwellings;
a Skeleton of the cave bear; and a series of crude stone, ivory, bone, and
metal implements, used by Indians of modern times, to illustrate the
various methods of fastening them to handles.

SECTION OF ETHNOLOGY.

The Curator of Ethnology, Prof. O. T. Mason, was asked to prepare
an exhibit to illustrate in a general way the leading characteristics of
the different races of men; and to show the tribal relations of the North
American Indians and the progress made by them in civilization. His
exhibit occupied more than 1,100 square feet of floor space, and at-
tracted much attention. It was divided into two series, namely: the
general ethnological exhibit, which ineluded all of the principal races
of men, and the collections illustrating the life and habits of the various
164 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

Indian tribes. The first series contained diagrams showing the classi-
fication of mankind into races, and maps indicating, by colored areas, the
distribution of the various races over the face of the earth. These were
followed by models in plaster of the heads of many of the semi-civilized
people of the Old World, and by full-sized figures showing the character-
istic costumes of the various nationalities.

The exhibit relating to the North American Indians was naturally
more extensive. It ineclu‘led a large number of hand-colored photo-
eraphs showing both profile and front views of prominent members of
each of the more important tribes. The life and habits of these Indians
were iliustrated by means of carefully selected collections of their im-
plements, utensils and costumes. Among the specimens shown were
war-clubs, bows, arrows, spears, tomahawks, scalping-knives, cooking
utensils, samplesof weaving, dressed skins and agricultural implements.
Collections illustrating the art, religion, and pastimes of the Indians
were also exhibited.

In the center of the space occupied by this department was a collec-
tion showing the chemical composition of the human body. The series
was based upon aman weighing 154 pounds, the exact quantity of each
of the various solids, liquids, and gases being represented. On the
opposite side of the same case were series showing the daily income and
expenditure of the human body, and the amount of food required during
a day of twenty-four hours by a man of moderate work, based upon the
latest investigations by physiological chemists ; also a series showing
the chemical constituents of a pound of wheat bread.

Adjoining the general ethnological exhibit was a collection prepared
by Mr. Walter Hough, to show the development of the lamp. It was
not limited to the United States, but contained objects from various
other countries as well. The series began with the fire-fly cage from the
West Indies and the candle-fish of the Eskimo, and ineluded the more
interesting forms of torches, candles, lanterns, and the various stone,
metal, and glass lamps adapted to both animal and mineral oils and to
electricity. ;

EXHIBIT OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

In addition to the exhibit made by the department of ethnology in
the National Museum, already referred to, the Director of the Bureau of
Ethnology, Maj. J. W. Powell, was requested to furnish a sappiemental
exhibit which should illustrate the methods employed by said Bureau
in the study of the North American Indians. This exhibit, which was
prepared by Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, related chiefly to the Pueblo In-
dians and the mound-builders. It contained plaster models from life,
by Theo. A. Mills, of six of the leading members of the Zuni tribe.
These were dressed in their characteristic costumes, including the orna-
ments worn by them. In an adjoining case was a relief map of a sec-
tion of the Zuni country showing the location of their settlements.
Next came a series of scale models and photographs of many of their
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 165

dwellings, both ancient and modern. Among these were some of the
most noted ruins as well as several of their most populous villages.
The largest model, which was about 15 feet square, represented the vil-
lage of Zuni on a seale of 1 to 60, all of the important details being
carefully reproduced. The arts and industries of these people were
represented by cases containing large collections of their textiles, bask-
etry, pottery, agricultural implements, and household utensils. The
mound-builders were represented by several carefully prepared models
of noted mounds from different parts of the country ; among these were
the Great Elephant Mound of Grant County, Wisconsin, and the Large
and Small Etowah Mounds of Bartow County, Georgia, with samples
of pottery and other articles taken from them.

EXHIBIT OF BIBLICAL ARCHEOLOGY.

Owing to the wide-spread interest in biblical studies, Dr. Cyrus Ad-
ler, Assistant Curator of the Section of Oriental Antiquities, was called
upon to prepare an exhibit which should enable Bible students (of
whom it is estimated that there are already more than four millions
in the Sunday-schools of the United States) to see something of the
results of the work of the numerous specialists who have devoted their
time and energies to the study of the people of Bible lands, and to be-
come familiar with some of the interesting objects which have been col-
lected and studied, with a view to the better understanding of the lan-
guage, history, art, social life, and religion of these people. Nearly
all of the most interesting objects secured by archeologists are in for-
eign museums, and the time was too short to have casts of them made
and forwarded ; but by the co-operation of a number of people in this
country who had articles in their possession, and by the liberal use of
photography, it became possible to get together considerable material,
which with the articles already in the possession of the Museum made
a very instructive exhibit. The collection was not confined to the Is-
raelites, but included all of the people with whom they came in contact.
“ Owing to the unparalleled conservatism of these people,” says Dr. Ad-
ler, ‘ proper names, dialectic forms, architecture, costumes, and, what
is more surprising, considering the changes of faith, even religious
practices have persisted in the East through thousands of years,” and
the collections therefore properly included many objects still in use.
The exhibits were arranged by countries, including Assyria and Baby-
lonia, Egypt, Elam, and Palestine. They contained objects from a
period beginning 3800 years B. C., and continuing to the present time,
including royal seals and impressions of same, casts of obelisks and
tablets containing pictorial and historical inscriptions, photographs of
the Egyptian pyramids, sphinxes, sculptures, mummies of noted kings,
with specimens of plants, shells, lamps, and costumes collected in the
several countries named. Among the more interesting objects were the
easts of the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser IL, the Rosetta Stone, the
Moabite Stone, and the Siloam Inscription.

166 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSETM, 1889.
SECTION OF MAMMALS.

The Curator of the Department of Mammals, Mr. F. W. True, was
asked to prepare an exhibit which should illustrate the principles on
which the present classification of mammals was based. The family
was selected as the division which would best represent the general
theory of classification, and it was decided to send a collection which
should include one or more characteristic specimens of every known
family. As quite a number of the families were not represented in the
museum collection it became necessary to secure specimens from other
sources, and when such could not be obtained, to represent the family
by means of pictures. Owing to the fact that classification rests partly
on external and partly on internal characters, both skeletons and stuffed
specimens were included. The families, excepting only a few of the larg-
est forms, which from their size had to be separated from the systematic
series, were arranged in zoological order in one continuous case 140 feet
long, beginning with the highest order, man, and ending with the lowest
or egg-laying mammals, thus affording excellent opportunities for study
and comparison. The collection naturally included many animals with
which the public had thus far had little opportunity for becoming ac-
quainted. Among these were the gorilla, chimpanzee, aye-aye, panda,
walrus, coney, tapir, saiga, antelope, almiqui, shrew, tana, chinchilla,
coypu, whale, porpoise, manatee, aard-vark, pangolin, armadillo, ant-
eater, duck-bill, and many other forms seldom found in expositions
in this or any other country.

MAMMAL EXTERMINATION SERIES.

Adjoining the systematic mammal collection was a special exhibit pre-
pared by Mr. W. T. Hornaday, Curator of Living Animals, to direct the
attention of the public to the rapid destruction of many of the larger
animals which are fast disappearing from the country, and are already
in great danger of extermination. The series included the bison, or
American buffalo, moose, elk, antelope, mountain goat, mountain sheep,
walrus, elephant-seal, and the beaver. The bison was the object of
special attention, and a large series of pictures were shown to illustrate
the numerous methods employed by both Indians and whites in its de-
struction. In the center of the exhibit, upon a sod-covered pedestal,
was a skeleton of a bison from which the hide had been removed, show-
ing the condition in which the carcasses are left upon the plains by the
hide-hunters; and on adjoining screens were specimens of the various
grades of commercial hides, with a schedule of their past and present
market values. There was also on exhibition a very instructive map of
North America, showing by colored areas the original territory covered
by the buffalo, and its narrowing range from time to time during the
past quarter of a century, due to the destructive agency of man. In
the rear of the exhibit was a case containing samples of the hides of

other animals which have been eagerly sought by the hide-hunter, and
an exhibit of the different weapons used in the destruction of the va-
rious species.

SECTION OF BIRDS.

An instructive exhibit of birds was prepared by the Curator of Birds,
Mr. Robert Ridgway. It consisted of an extensive collection of finely
mounted and carefully labeled specimens of the birds of North America,
and of smaller series of the principal birds of foreign countries.

The collection of North American birds was very complete, including
examples of every known genus excepting onlyafewof the larger water
birds and birds of prey, which were omitted for lack of space. They
were arranged in proper sequence, thus affording an excellent oppor-
tunity for the study of the latest scientific classification. In a few in-
stances, where the birds were too rareand valuable to warrant the send-
ing of specimens, they were represented by means of original water-color
paintings by the curator. The coliection of foreign birds, though much
smaller, consisted of the characteristic types of various countries selected
for the purpose of showing something of the bird fauna of the principal
zoo-geographical regions of the earth. Among those represented were
the Australian, Indo-Malayan, and Ethiopian regions, and the principal
birds of Europe. Another series which attracted much attention from
the exposition visitors was a collection of the principal birds of litera-
ture, with the names by which they are known in poetry and appropriate
quotations from the leading authors regarding them. A collection of
birds’ eggs and casts of same to represent the various sizes, from the
egg of the extinct epyorius or giant ostrich of Madagascar, with a ea-
pacity of two gallons, to that of the humming-bird, and a set of fac-
simile reproductions of the plates of Audubon’s books on the birds of
North America were also exhibited.

SECTION OF INSECTS.

This exhibit was prepared by Dr. C. V. Riley and Mr. John B. Smith.
It consisted of a systematic collection illustrating the various families
of insects, and economic series showing separately the species injurious
to agriculture and to forests. Thesystematic series represented, either
by specimens or detailed drawings, all of the families of American in-
sects. Where practicable, care was taken to select large and showy
specimens to represent the different families, thus attracting the atten-
tion of the public as well as that of the specialist to the exhibit. This
was notably true in the case of the Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, which
contained many attractive forms. Each family was accompanied by a
descriptive label calling attention to its peenliar characters, and in
many instances was illustrated by several species. This series con-
tained several thousand specimens, and was much admired both by the
168 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

public and by students interested in this branch of natural history,
The economic exhibit contained separate series, each being devoted to
a particular species, including insects that feed upon the different
grains, the cotton plant, the apple, the grape, and the various species
of ornamental and forest trees. It was prepared for the benefit of the
agricultural classes, and contained specimens and drawings illustrating
the development of the various species, their methods of feeding, and
samples of roots, stalks, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits that had
been injured by them. The descriptive label accompanying each speci-
men contained information of practical value to the farmer and fruit-
grower, and suggested methods by which they could to a greater or less
degree protect their crops from the ravages of these pests.
SECTION OF MOLLUSKS.

The Department of Mollusks in the Museum forwarded a collection,
prepared by Dr. W. H. Dall and Prof. R. E. C. Stearns. The object,
as in the case of the other natural history collections, was to illustrate the
principles on which the present system of classification was based.
The exhibit, though occupying only about 250 feet of floor space, was
very complete, and contained specimens representing all of the impor-
tant families of marine mollusks not only of this country, but of other
parts of the world. No attempt was made to show the land shells, as the
time was too short to get up a collection, and there was not sufficient
space for displaying the same, even if it had been prepared.

SECTION OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES.

A collection of marine invertebrates was prepared by Mr. F. A. Lucas,
osteologist of the Museum. It consisted of a carefully selected series of
typical representatives of the various families of sponges, corals, jelly-
fishes, echinoderms, and star-fishes. As a rule, the species were repre-
sented by dried and carefully mounted specimens of the animals them-
Selves; but such groups as could not be preserved in this way were
Shown by means of glass models obtained from Europe. The collection
of sponges contained full series of both the ornamental and commercial
Species of our own country and a number of the more important com-
mercial species trom the Mediterranean Sea. The families of corals
were represented by numerous species from the off-shore banks of the
North Atlantic, by a number of the more attractive forms from the Gulf
of Mexico, and by a collection of the typical forms from Polynesia.
The growth of the red or precious coral of commerce was shown by
means of models. The exhibit illustrating the families of jelly-fishes
was made up exclusively of glass models, by means of which a number
of the more delicate forms, including the Portuguese man-of-war, were
represented.

SECTION OF BOTANY.

The botanical exhibit was prepared by Mr. F. H. Knowlton, Assist-
ant Curator of Botany. It consisted of a collection of ehromo-litho-
graphs of the flowering plants and ferns of the country, and of an ex-

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 169

hibit of specimens of marine alge. The series illustrating the flower-
ing plants included about two hundred and fifty plates, each repre-
senting a different species. It contained examples of all the princi-
pal orders, the specimens selected being such as, on account of their
beauty or curious form, would be most likely to attract the attention
of the public. In many of these plates all of the parts of the plant
were represented, and in some instances the parts of the Hower were
enlarged to show the important characters of the species.

The collection of ferns was more complete. It contained eighty-one
plates, on which one hundred and fifty, out of one hundred and sixty
species of North American ferns were represented. These plates
were taken largely from the published works of Eaton, Meehan,
Sprague, and Goodale.

The collection of alge included nearly all of the species known to
oceur on the Atlantic coast of the United States and many of the
common species from the Pacific. It was originally intended, in addi-
tion to the above, to show separate collections of the flowers and
ferns of the Ohio Valley, and also to prepare a comprehensive forestry
exhibit, which should include sample woods and herbarium specimens
of the principal trees of the Ohio Valley, photographs of the forest
trees of the United States, and maps locating the present forest areas
of the country; but the delay in the passage of the bill authorizing
the exhibit and the lack of space made it impossible to do so. A
collection of fossil plants to show the progress made in the study of
paleontological botany was omitted for a similar reason.

SECTION OF MINERALOGY.

This exhibit was prepared by Prof. Ff. W. Clarke, Honorary Curator of
the Department of Minerals, with the aid of the Assistant Curator, Mr.
W.S. Yeates. It was at first intended to send a complete collection of
the minerals of North America, the floor space required being estimated
at 1,200 square feet, and negotiations were begun for the purchase of a
collection, valued at $5,500, belonging to Mr. Joseph Willcox, of Phil-
adelphia, which was especially rich in North American materials, to
serve as a nucleus of the exhibit. The auditing officer for the Govern-
ment, however, objected to the proposed expenditure, and the plan of,
making a systematic exhibit was therefore of necessity abandoned. The
exhibit as finally sent consisted of a single case, containing such gems
and ornamental stones as were available from the collections already in
possession of the Museum, with the addition of a smallamount of gem
material from other sources. It was limited almost exclusively to North
American specimens.

SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION.

Some months prior to the passage of the exposition bill, Mr. J. E.
Watkins, formerly with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, was ap-
pointed curator of a newly-formed section of transportation in the Na-
170 REPORT OF NATIONA?T. MUSEUM, 1889.

tional Museum, and considerable interest was already manifested by the
public in the small collection which he had succeeded in getting together.
He was requested to secure additional material to supplement this col-
lection, and to send to Cincinnati a comprehensive exhibit which should
illustrate so far as practicable, the development of the principal
systems of transportation in the various countries of the world.

He outlined a scheme based on the different motive powers, including
man, the various animals, wind, steam, and electricity. In the division
of steam transportation, special attention was given to the development:
of the railroad, and numerous models were secured illustrating the
growth of the locomotive, the car, and the track, including rail, road-
bed, and bridge. These were supplemented by a map, showing by de-
cades the progress of railroad construction in the United States. The
track exhibit was especially complete, containing scale models of nearly
every style used in this country since the introduction of railroads, and
also much interesting material from foreign lands. The collection con-
tained many articles of historic interest, including models or drawings
of many of the earliest locomotives and steam-boats, chief among which
were Murdock’s high-pressure locomotive, 1784; Trevithick’s locomotive,
1804; Stevens’s experimental locomotive, 1825; ‘ Rocket” and *Stour-
bridge Lion,” both of 1829; Hull’s steam-boat, 1739; Rumsey’s steam-
boat, 1787; steamer ‘“ F. R. Stockton,” 1839; also, the original papers,
signed by Louis XVI of France in 1791, granting a patent to John Fitch
for steam-boat propellers.

The systematic exhibit already referred to was supplemented by an
independent series showing the early methods of transportation in the
original Northwest Territory. This collection, as was expected, proved
of special interest to the exposition visitors, a majority of whom were
residents of Ohio and adjoining States. It included a model of the
**Sandusky,” 1837—the first locomotive in the State of Ohio, and of the
* Orleans,” 1812—the first steam-boat on the Ohio River.

While numerous collections had previously been prepared to illus-
trate the progress of one or another of the various systems of trans-
portation, this was, so far as we know, the first attempt ever made to
bring them all together, and to treat them systematically in one com-
prehensive series.

Much assistance was rendered by the Baltimore and Ohio, and Pennsyl-
vania Railroad Companies, both of which furnished valuable collections
showing the progress made on their respective lines; and by the officers
of the Stevens Institute at Hoboken, N. J., who loaned various objects
of historical interest and allowed photographs and models of others to

be made.
SECTION OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE.

This exhibit was sent for the purpose of showing the various types
of vessels of the world, especially those of North America. It was pre-
pared by Capt. J. W. Collins, Curator of the Section of Naval Archi-
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. tT

tecture, and was arranged in such a way as to direct attention to the
improvements in vessels of modern times over those of earlier years.
The exhibit consisted chietly of rigged models, builders’ models, and pict-
ures. Itcontained many objects of historic interest which attracted much
attention. The historical series began with the viking ship, dating back
to 800 A. D., and included the famous Columbus fleet of 1492, the Car-
rack of the Sixteenth century, the Spanish Galleon of the Sixteenth
and Seventeenth centuries, the “Sally Constant” (the ‘“ Mayflower” of
the Virginia Colony), the *‘ Mayflower” of 1620, and the “Cumberland”,
sunk at Hampton Roads during the late war. The other series contained
models of the kyack or skin-boat of the Eskimo, the various types of
fishing vessels of different periods, the principal kinds of merchant ves-
sels and other sailing craft, and both river and ocean steamers of mod-
ern pattern.

SECTION OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

The photographic exhibit was prepared by Mr. T. W. Smillie, the
photographer of the National Museum. The original plan was very
comprehensive, the intention being to show, in so far as practicable, the
origin and growth of the science, the various processes and appliances,
the different uses of photography, and the literature of the subject;
but the limited time remaining after the passage of the bill made it im-
possible to fully carry out the scheme. The representation of origin
and growth was therefore practically neglected, and the collection of
appliances was of necessity somewhat limited, Mr. Smillie’s attention
being devoted chiefly to showing the more important processes and the
various uses of the science. The collection of apparatus included por-
trait and landscape cameras of former years, both single and stereo-
scopic, a complete daguerreotyper’s outfit, and a number of the more
satisfactory portrait, enlarging, landscape, and detective cameras of the
present day. The series of processes included the Daguerreotype, Tal-
botype, albumen, collodion, and gelatine negative processes ; also series
showing samples of plain, albumen, bromide, and other silver prints, as
well as prints by the platinum, carbon, uranium, asphalt, and the nu-
merous iron processes. Enlarged prints by the use of whey, platinum,
and bromide, the collodion transparency, and transferotypes on paper,
canvas, and porcelain were also exhibited.

In addition to the ordinary uses to which photography is applied, at-
tention was directed to its great value in other directions. One series
of photographs illustrated its use, in connection with the microscope, in
the study of disease germs, embryology, lithology, mineralogy, ete.; and
another in connection with the telescope, in making astral charts, in
studying eclipses, stellar spectra, and the like. Examples were also
displayed showing its value for other purposes, such as the study of
botany, zodlogy, architecture, lam p flames, explosives, in the detection
of criminals, in map and chart making, in recording the fluctuations in
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889.

various scientific instruments, as thermometors, barometors, and mag-
netic needles, in the study of special industries, in the illustration of
of books, and as an aid to the artist and engraver. ‘The literature of the
science was represented by a series of photographs of the title-pages of
more than three hundred books and pamphlets relating to photography.
A small collection of photographs, forwarded by Mr. A. Howard Clark,
curator of the section of personal and historical relies, was exhibited in
this space. It consisted of a series of photographs of Washington and
Grant relies in the possession of the Museum, and a collection of por-
traits of men prominent in the various branches of science during the
past three centuries.
SECTION OF GRAPHIC ARTS.

This exhibit, prepared by Mr. 8. R. Koehler, Curator of the Section of

xraphie Arts, was intended to illustrate the various methods employed

in the preparation of blocks and plates for pictorial printing. It was
divided into four groups as follows:

(1) The various processes of engraving and printing from the begin-
ning of the Sixteenth century to the present time, exclusive of the mod-
ern photo-mechanical processes; (2) The history of wood-engraving in
the United States; (3) The history of etching in the United States ;
(4) The modern photo-mechanical processes. The first group contained
prints illustrating all of the most important processes of this division,
twenty-four in number, and in the case of the principal ones an attempt
was made to give some idea of their history by the exhibition of care-
fully selected series showing the progress made in several of the lead-
ing countries including England, Germany, France, the Netherlands,
and Italy, during different periods.

As both wood-engraving and etching owe much of their present popu-
larity to American artists either by nativity or adoption, and as the
Exposition was largely for the purpose of showing the progress made
in the arts and sciences, it was thought desirable to prepare extensive
exbibits showing separately the growth of these processes in the United
States. Considerable space was given to these collections in which
specimens of the work of all prominent artists in either branch were
displayed. The series of wood-engravings began with samples of the
earliest work of Dr, Alexander Anderson, 1818, and included engrav-
ings by no less than sixty different artists. The earliest etchings shown
were those by Chapman in 1852, the bulk of the collection being made
up of work executed within the past ten years. ‘ Special stress” says
Mr. Koehler was “laid upon the painter etchings (#. e. original work),
and the smaller reproductive plates made from about 1877 to about a
year or two ago, while the large plates of a more commercial character
which have appeared lately were represented only by a few selected
specimens.” In this collection over fifty of the leading etchers of the
country were represented, thirteen of them being women.

The fourth group was devoted to the modern photo-mechanical proe-

esses which are playing so important a part in the pictorial printing of
the present time. Photography proper, being a photo-chemical process
in which the print is made by the action of the sun’s rays, was excluded,
the exhibit being limited to those processes in which the printing-press
is necessary to the manifolding of the picture, even though the block or
plate may have been made wholly or in part by the chemical action of
light. The various relief, photo-lithographic, zincographic, calographic,
and intaglio processes were grouped separately, and an effort was made
to show, by means of prints, the improvement made in each since its
discovery ; though, as the processes are usually either wholly or in part
secret, no attempt was made to illustrate the methods by which the
blocks were produced. Mr. Koehler has prepared a detailed catalogue
of the exhibit, in which the various processes are briefly described and
much valuable information regarding their history is given.

4. REVIEW OF THE EXHIBITS OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF THE
GOVERNMENT.

State Department.—The State Department exhibit was under the di-
rection of Mr. Haughwout Howe. It was prepared for the purpose of
illustrating the work of that Department. It contained many papers
and other objects of great historical interest. The series of diplomatic
papers included the letter addressed by Benjamin Franklin to the pre-
mier of France in December, 1776 (this being the first official communi-
cation ever sent toa foreign court by an officer of our Government) and
many other equally interesting papers, among which were letters bear-
ing the signature of many of the leading sovereigns of the world during
the past century, and of almost every one now in power. The original
treaty of 1782 with Great Britain, which secured to us our independence,
was exhibited, as were also a number of other treaties with Great Britain,
France, The Netherlands, and Turkey, each bearing the seal of its
respective government, and a whale’s tooth sent asa treaty by the King
of the Fiji Islands. There was also a complete series of portraits of
the Presidents of the United States, and another of the Secretaries of
State from the time of Jefferson; also photographs of the principal
Government buildings of Washington, and of certain of our foreign
offices, with maps showing the location of our diplomatic and consular
stations in all parts of the world. To the above were added many
interesting historical relics from the library of the department, series
of medals awarded to the United States, to officers of the Army and
Navy, and to private citizens, and a full set of the department publica-
tions, including United States laws, diplomatic correspondence, foreign
relations, consular reports, consular regulations, commercial relations,
and reports on various expositions.

War Department.—The exhibits of this Department, prepared by
Capt. H. A. Russell, Bureau of Ordnance, assisted by Lieut. EK. 5.
Benton, Third Artillery, were among the most interesting of the Govern-

ment exhibits. They occupied a floor space of about 4,000 square feet
in the eastern part of the south annex adjoining the space oceupied by
the Navy Department. The collections were made up of materials
obtained from different sources to show the various implements of war
and the improvements in tic same during recent years. The older forms
consisted chiefly of war relics from different parts of the world, the
greater part of them being objects captured from, or surrendered by the
enemy during the wars with Great Britain, Mexico, the various In.-
dian wars, and the War of the Rebellion. These were supplemented by
a large series showing many of the older styles of weapons used by our
own army during the earlier years of 1ts existence. The series of war
relics contained a great variety of objects from all parts of the world,
including spears, pikes, lances, bayonets, halberds, daggers, creeses,
sabers, swords, scimeters, shields, armors, small-arms, and mounted
and unmounted guns of various kinds. The collections showing the
modern war implements were furnished in large part by the Bureau of
Ordnance, and contained a sufficient number of primitive forms to show
the origin and development of many of the implements of the present
day. The series of small-arms began with the old match-lock, which
was in turn followed by the wheel-lock, flint-lock, pereussion-lock, and
the breech-loading rifle. The series of larger guns contained mounted
and unmounted specimens of various forms, including the muzzle-
loading cannon, Napoleon gun, breech-loading steel field-piece, Gatling
gun, volley gun, Krupp gun, Hotchkiss gun, and numerous other forms.
There was also a large series of projectiles of various styles, a collection
of fuses, and samples of the uniforms worn by soldiers of different rank
in the various branches of the Army.

Navy Department.—The Naval exhibits, prepared under the direction
of Lieut. Richard Rush, assisted by Ensigns E. A. Clements and John
Gibson, occupied about 4,750 square feet of floor-space fronting on the
main aisle of the Government wing of the Park building, and extending
backward for some distance into the south amnex. They consisted of
separate collections forwarded by the Bureau of Ordnance, Bureau of
Construction and Repairs, Bureau of Navigation (including the Hydro-
graphic Office, Office of Compasses and Naval Observatory), and by the
U.S. Naval Academy.

The exhibit of the Bureau of Ordnance consisted of steel breech-load-
ing rifle guns of various sizes, Parrot rifle gun with fittings, howitzers,
Gatling guns, small-arms of different patterns, specimens of projectiles
and fuses, and a fully equipped torpedo-boat. The Bureau of Construc-
tion and Repair sent a very valuable collection of models of our largest
and most modern war vessels, including several now building. The
Bureau of Navigation exhibited a complete set of day and night signals,
and the flags of all nations. The Hydrographic Oftice forwarded a series
of instruments used in its survey work, a portable observatory with the
necessary equipment for the telegraphic determination of longitude, a
collection illustrating the methods of chart construction from the first

rough survey plottings to the completed chart, relief models in plaster
showing the contour of the ocean-bed in various localities, and wind,
current, thermal and other charts issued by this office as aids to navi-
gation. The Office of Compasses sent a full set of mariner’s compasses
and other instruments for determining magnetism. The Naval Observa-
tory exhibited a complete outfit of apparatus for astronomical work, pho-
tographs of the heavenly bodies, and a set of instruments and electric
apparatus to illustrate the operations of the Observatory time system,
and to show its relation to the various commercial interests of the coun-
try. During the continuance of the Exposition this department, through
its Washington office, operated a time-ball by means of which the cor-
rect time was furnished daily.

Treasury Department.—The exhibits of this Department were made
up of separate collections by several bureaus, including the Depart-
ment proper, the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Bureau of Print-
ing and Engraving, and the Life-Saving Servite. The collective ex-
hibit, which occupied an area of 4,250 square feet at the farther end
of the south annex, was under the general direction of Maj. Herman
Kretz, representative, assisted by Lieut. C. H. McClellan of the Life-
Saving Service, and Capt. C. O. Boutelle and Dr. J. H. Clark of the
Coast and Geodetic Survey.

The exhibit of the Treasury proper consisted of a complete collection
of portraits in oil of the Secretaries of the Treasury from the organiza-
tion of the Department. The exhibit of the Coast and Geodetic Survey
was composed in large part of the scientific instruments and other
apparatus used in its magnetic, hydrographic, geodetic, and topographic
work, with a full set of the maps, charts, and publications of the sur-
vey, and a set of standard weights and measures, and of the weights
and measures of the metric system.

The Bureau of Printing and Engraving sent an exhibit illustrating
the various kinds of work done by its employés, including the different
styles of engraving, and samples of printing by both hand and steam
presses. The objects selected for showing the processes were United
States bonds varying in size from $100 to $50,000, currency notes and
silver and gold certificates ranging from $1 to $10,000, internal rev-
enue certificates and a collection of vignette portraits of two hundred
of the leading American statesmen and inventors.

The collections sent by the Life-Saving Service consisted of a care-
fully selected series, illustrating by means of pictures, apparatus, and
models, the methods employed by it in the saving of both life and prop-
erty. It contained a complete station outfit, including self-bailing
life-boat and carriage, cannon, projectile, shot-line, life-car, breeches-
buoy, and a complete set of lines, ropes, blocks, and signals; also a
beach wagon fully equipped for service, samples of the life-jackets and
Swimming-suits worn by the crew, and statistical summaries of the
work accomplished during the past few years.

Department of the Interior.—The exhibits of this Department occupied
the east front of the park building and the eastern side of the north
annex. They were made up of separate collections from the Patent
Office, General Land Office, Census Office, Geological Survey, Bureau
of Education, Indian Bureau, Railroad Bureau, and Pension Office.
The representative of this Department was thelate Marcellus Gardner,
who died after a brief illness while the exposition was still in progress,
Prof. F. W. Clarke being designated as his successor. The bulk of the
collections were sent by the Patent Office and the Geological Survey.
The former sent upwards of two thousand five hundred models, which
were arranged systematically by classes of inventions. Among the
number were several of historic interest, including the original models
of the Howe sewing-machine, the Morse electric telegraph, and the
Whitney cotton-gin. This office also exhibited enlarged photographs
of the public buildings of Washington, portraits of all ex-Commissioners
of Patents, and se Ie ADULTE tale LUO ES The Geological Survey ex-
