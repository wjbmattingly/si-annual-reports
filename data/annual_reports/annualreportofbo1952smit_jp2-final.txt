Report of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution

ALEXANDER WETMORE
For the Year Ended June 30, 1952

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

Gentiemen: I have the honor to submit herewith my report show-
ing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and its
branches during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1952.

GENERAL STATEMENT

The period covered in the present annual report has been one of
steady and progressive activity along the established lines that have
become the functions of the Smithsonian Institution as the years
since its foundation in 1846 have multiplied. Although no additional
responsibilities have been assumed beyond those entailed by the
steady increase in the national collections of history, science, and
art, in visitors to the public exhibitions, and in requests for infor-
mation and other assistance, there has been much consideration and
effort given to improvement in methods of operation and to better
coordination of our affairs. Having held administrative positions
concerned with the direction of the Smithsonian Institution since
1925, first as Assistant Secretary, and since 1945 as Secretary, I find
it of interest to examine the current status of the Institution and
its position at the present time, when I have requested release from
these responsibilities in order to be free for the scientific investigations
that have been a major activity throughout my life.

It should be stated clearly that whatever has been accomplished in
betterment in the Institution during this period of years has been
due to the combined interest and devotion of all the Institution’s per-
sonnel and not to the work of any one individual alone. The staff of
the Smithsonian throughout its modern history has been the dynamic
part of the organization, in contrast to the material holdings of land,
buildings, and collections that form its possessions. The staff, while
constantly changing in individual members, in its entirety has been
the firm foundation of the structure. The varied forces exerted in
this staff form a steadily flowing stream of effort whose force and
direction have changed from decade to decade, but whose impetus as a
whole does not slacken. It is this working group that is the heart

1
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

of the Smithsonian Institution at any given moment in its operations.
In my quarter-century and more with the Smithsonian it has been
repeatedly impressed upon me that it has been the loyalty and spirit
and abilities of these workers that have helped most to achieve the In-
stitution’s prime purpose—“the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.”

The original endowment fund received under the will of James
Smithson, with several later additions, is held in the United States
Treasury as a permanent trust and stands as official recognition of the
position held by the Smithsonian in relation to our Nation. The
Institution has deep and increasing pride in its position as guardian
of historical and scientific treasures that belong to all who now are
citizens of our country and that, equally, belong to the generations
of the future. It is our great responsibility to maintain these hold-
ings safely, to investigate and make known their values for the public
good, and to add to them in those ways that will enhance their worth
for the increase of knowledge. This responsibility is particularly
acute in times of national emergency, as during World War II or at
the present time when many peacetime activities must give place in
the Federal budget to matters of national defense. Smithsonian
administrators would not be faithful to their trust if even during
such periods they relaxed in their efforts to assure adequate support
through public funds for safeguarding and preserving for future
generations the treasures entrusted to them by the American people.

Growth in the responsibilities of the Smithsonian since 1925 may be
better understood when it is known that the collections in its charge
have more than doubled during that time, while their value has
increased in even greater degree because they include so many
thousands of unique objects. It is not practicable to place a definite
monetary value on all these things, since for most there is no true
market in the sense of ordinary barter and sale. For many, partic-
ularly in the historical field, no real price in dollars may be set, as
their actual worth—for example, the relics of Washington, Jeffer-
son, and other national heroes—lies in the patriotic sentiment in which
they are held. It is sufficient to say that the more than 33,000,000
catalog entries now found in these collections may be valued at upward
of a billion dollars, but with the further explanation that no sum of
money, regardless of how great it might be, could ever replace these
materials should damage come to them.

Many shifts and changes in our administrative alignment have been
made for improvement in procedures, for more efficient assignment of
staff, and for better utilization of the space available to us for housing.
The result has been an increased efficiency without which we would not
be able to meet the demands now laid upon us. The scope of all

SECRETARY’S REPORT 3

Smithsonian bureaus and their constituent units is now described in
a detailed account of the work of the Institution, prepared in January
1951, which includes a survey of the duties and responsibilities that
pertain to each.

Present needs of the Smithsonian remain those that have been of
perennial pressure, namely, additional personnel, increased space for
housing, and further support for operation. All require funds if they
are to be adequately met. Through increased pay, necessary and
greatly deserved under present-day living costs, and through changes
in work hours, the annual payroll of the Institution has more than
doubled in the past 20 years. At the same time the available man
hours of service per week now actually are less. In 1942 we had
90,592 man hours available. For the same service now in 1952 (with
greatly increased work load) we may command only 20,200 man hours.
This situation is one that needs remedy without delay, or the Institu-
tion will lag decidedly in its required duties and in its services to our
people.

As for space, through careful planning we are now utilizing fully
all that is available to us. Additional buildings for the United States
National Museum and the National Air Museum, for the collections in
art, and for our research operations in natural history and other fields
are essential whenever funds may be provided. For a number of years
it has become increasingly important that a research center of consid-
erable size be built in the area outside of but reasonably near Metro-
politan Washington, to which the study collections of the National
Museum might be removed and where laboratory space would be avail-
able for our scientists. ‘The present buildings in the Mall area would
then be accessible to the public to be used wholly for exhibition. The
research area should be arranged to provide storage for the most im-
portant objects in the exhibition series, should threat of war demand
their removal to safety. It will be a great day in the history of the
Smithsonian and in the history of American science when plans for
these buildings materialize. They have been the dream of many who
believe that the Smithsonian Institution is one of the great American
traditions that not only must be preserved but must be accorded the
physical facilities to meet its obligations of leadership in this modern
age of science.

Through the income of its endowments the Smithsonian has a per-
manence in parts of its operation that it may maintain in no other
way. Its activities under most of its endowment funds are now far
too modest, since only in a few instances of special funds does it have
the income that it requires. We should look forward also to sub-
stantial growth here, to provide larger funds for research and publi-
cation and for the general maintenance of central administration.
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

What lies ahead in the next century for the Smithsonian Institution
no one can safely predict. It was my privilege in 1946 to help cele-
brate the one-hundredth anniversary of the Institution’s founding,
and at that time I wrote: “The Smithsonian had a definite beginning
but has no foreseeable end. Its stated purpose knows no time or
space limits, and it will go on through the centuries, changing with
a changing world and so adjusting itself that it may fill a useful role
in the upward struggle of mankind.” It has been one of the greatest
satisfactions of my life to have served an organization with such a
prospect and with such potentialities.

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846,
in accordance with the terms of the wil! of James Smithson, of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian
Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting the trust,
Congress determined that the Federal Government was without au-
thority to administer the trust directly, and, therefore, constituted an
“establishment” whose statutory members are “the President, the Vice
President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive depart-
ments.”

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

No changes in personnel occurred on the Board of Regents in the
past year. The vacancy in the class of citizen regents still exists. The
roll of regents at the close of the fiscal year, June 30, 1952, was as fol-
lows: Chief Justice of the United States, Fred M. Vinson, Chancellor ;
Vice President Alben W. Barkley; members from the Senate: Walter
F. George, Clinton P. Anderson, Leverett Saltonstall; members from
the House of Representatives: Clarence Cannon, John M. Vorys, FE. E.
Cox; citizen members: Harvey N. Davis, Arthur H. Compton, Van-
nevar Bush, Robert V. Fleming, and Jerome C. Hunsaker.

On the evening of January 17, preceding the annual meeting, an
informal dinner meeting of the Board was held in the main hall of
the Smithsonian Institution, with the Chancellor, Chief Justice Vin-
son, presiding. This occasion gave opportunity for members of the
Smithsonian staff to make a fuller presentation of the scientific work
of the Institution than was practicable at the regular meeting the
next day.

The Board held its regular annual meeting in the Regents’ Room
on January 18, 1952. The Secretary presented his annual report cov-
ering the activities of the Institution and its bureaus, including the

SECRETARY'S REPORT 5

financial report of the Executive Committee, for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1951, and this was accepted by the Board. The usual reso-
lution authorized the expenditure by the Secretary of the income of
the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1953.

At the Chancellor’s suggestion, the meeting of January 18 was re-
cessed until April 9, at which time the report of the special committee
to select a successor to the Secretary was given before the full Board.
Robert V. Fleming, chairman of the special committee, presented the
resolution electing Dr. Leonard Carmichael, president of Tufts Col-
lege, Medford, Mass., as Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
effective on January 1, 1953.

Dr. Wetmore, who retires from administrative duties at his own
request, will continue his scientific work with the Institution, under
the title of research associate.

A statement on finances, dealing particularly with Smithsonian
private funds, will be found in the report of the executive committee
of the Board of Regents, page 169.

In addition, $1,240,000 was appropriated to the National Gallery of
Art, a bureau of the Institution but administered by a separate board
of trustees; and $620,800 was provided in the District of Columbia ap-
propriation act for the operation of the National Zoological Park.

Besides these direct appropriations, the Institution received funds
by transfer from other Federal agencies, as follows:

From the Department of State, from the appropriation Interna-
tional Information and Educational Activities, 1952, a total of $42,000
for the period July 1 through December 81, 1951, for the planning and

During the last 4 months of the fiscal year a special record was
kept of groups of school children visiting the Smithsonian. The count
showed that 159,784 school children came in 4,289 groups, or at an
average of 37 to each group. By months the figures are: March, 420
groups, 12,066 children; April, 1,022 groups, 38,286 children; May,
2,207 groups, 85,881 children; June, 640 groups, 23,551 children. For
the 4-month period, therefore, 10.7 percent of all visitors were in this
category.

SECRETARY’S REPORT vé
NINETEENTH ANNUAL JAMES ARTHUR LECTURE ON THE SUN

In 1931 the Institution received a bequest from James Arthur, of
New York, a part of the income from which was to be used for an
annual lecture on some aspect of the study of the sun. The nine-
teenth Arthur lecture was delivered in the auditorium of the Natural
History Building on April 3, 1952, by Rear Adm. L. O. Colbert,
director of the Washington office of the Arctic Institute of North
America, formerly Director of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey.
The subject of Admiral Colbert’s address was “The Sun, the Moon,
and the Tides.” This lecture will be published in full in the General
Appendix of the Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution for 1952.

HALL OF NAVAL HISTORY

Special ceremonies were held on the evening of June 19, 1952, in
connection with the opening of the hall of naval history in the Arts
and Industries Building. In this new exhibit, designed and assem-
bled under the direction of Mendel L. Peterson, National Museum
curator of military and naval history, the story of American naval
development, from the privateer of the War of Independence to the
present-day battleship, is told by means of ship and other models,
paintings, prints, and original objects relating to celebrated naval
craft and leaders. Through the years collections of such material
have come to the Smithsonian. Now, for the first time, they are
exhibited as an organized whole. Outstanding ship models in the
collection, illustrating the advances from one war to another, are the
Bon Homme Richard, Constitution, Kearsage, the Olympia of Ad-
miral Dewey, the cruiser Wéchita, and the battleship Missour7.

Speakers at the opening ceremonies included Rear Adm. John B.
Heffernan, United States Navy; Dr. Remington Kellogg, Director of
the United States National Museum; and Dr. Alexander Wetmore,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Instiution.

POLICING OF SMITHSONIAN BUILDINGS

On October 24, 1951, the President approved a bill passed by the
Eighty-second Congress (Public Law 206) “relating to the policing
of the buildings and grounds of the Smithsonian Institution and its
constituent bureaus.” Among other provisions, this act authorizes
the Secretary of the Institution to designate Smithsonian employees
as special policemen with power to enforce regulations and make
arrests in connection with the policing of our buildings and grounds.
This authorization places us in a firm position relative to the protec-
tion of the many thousands of visitors who come to the Institution

236639—53——2
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

annually and serves to safeguard the tremendously valuable materials
in our collections that by law are our responsibility.

MARY VAUX WALCOTT FUND FOR PUBLICATIONS IN BOTANY

Acting upon a proposal by the Secretary, the executive committee
of the Board of Regents during the year authorized the establishment
of the Mary Vaux Walcott Fund for Publications in Botany. This
fund, amounting to $60,000, is derived from the sales of “North Amer-
ican Wild Flowers,” the 5-volume quarto portfolio of 400 water-color
plates of wild flowers painted from nature by Mrs. Charles D. Walcott.
The plates were reproduced in color by a special process and were pub-
lished under her supervision and generous subsidy. A large number
of sets of the plates have been sold by the Institution in the 27 years
since their publication, and it seems especially fitting that the income
from the proceeds of their sale should now be used for publication by
the Smithsonian of contributions to the science of botany, in which
Mrs. Walcott had a deep interest. It is planned that the publications
issued under this fund will be principally technical in nature and will
relate to the researches of the United States National Herbarium.
They will appear from time to time in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous
Collections.

SUMMARY OF THE YEAR’S ACTIVITIES OF THE BRANCHES OF THE
INSTITUTION

National Museum.—More than 607,000 specimens, twice as many as
last year, were received and distributed among the Museum’s six de-
partments, bringing the total catalog entries to 33,184,494. Some of
the year’s more noteworthy accessions included: In anthropology, an
eighteenth-century wampum belt of the Wyandot Indians, a collection
of Javanese puppets, and 78 Indian skeletons from burial sites on
Buggs Island in the Roanoke River, Va.; in zoology, important mam-
mals from Borneo, Alaska, and the United States, birds from Colom-
bia and Panama, reptiles and amphibians from Egypt and Borneo,
and large collections of fishes, insects, marine invertebrates, and mol-
lusks from many parts of the world; in botany, gifts of plants espe-
cially from Honduras, Colombia, Pert, Ryukyu Islands, Florida, and
Canada, and many others received in exchanges with other institu-
tions; in geology, five minerals heretofore unrepresented in the min-
eralogical collections, a collection of 250,000 fresh-water Mesozoic and
Cenozoic mollusks, and vertebrate fossils from Washington, Montana,
Wyoming, South Dakota, and North Dakota; in engineering and in-
dustries, a fanning mill used in West Virginia about 75 years ago, a
corn planter of about 1860, an 1878 oil engine, a collection of early
radio apparatus, and a series of stones and prints illustrating the mak-

SECRETARY'S REPORT 9

ing of a lithograph; and in history, a walnut chest of drawers once
owned by Jonathan Edwards, an unusual group of ship models for
the new hall of naval history, and the saddles and equine equipment
and the library of Gen. John J. Pershing.

Members of the staff conducted field work in Honduras, Dominican
Republic, Panama, Colombia, British North Borneo, Brazil, Ryukyu
Islands, México, Alaska, and many sections of the United States.
The Museum issued 27 publications during the year.

National Gallery of Art.—Visitors to the Gallery during the year
numbered 1,522,596, a slight increase over the previous year. The
Gallery received 1,891 accessions, by gift, loan, or deposit. Works of
art accepted included paintings by Winslow Homer, J. J. and J. W.
Audubon, Thomas Stephens, Tintoretto, Corot, Healy, Turner, Trum-
bull, Hogarth, Sargent, and Alvan Clark; 15 bronzes by Daumier ; and
several groups of prints and drawings. Ten special exhibits were
held at the Gallery during the year. Traveling exhibitions of prints
from the Rosenwald Collection were circulated to 19 galleries and
museums in this country, and one exhibit traveled in Germany.
Exhibitions from the “Index of American Design” were shown 78
times in 20 States and the District of Columbia and also in Europe.
More than 36,000 persons attended the Gallery’s special tours and the
“Picture of the Week” talks; more than 14,000 the Sunday afternoon
lectures. ‘The Sunday evening concerts were continued. Construction
of five new galleries, begun in 1950, was completed.

National Collection of Fine Arts—The Smithsonian Art Commis-
sion met on December 4, 1951, and accepted for the National Collection
2 oil paintings, 2 sculptures, 5 pieces of ceramics, several items of
glassware, and 1 water-color miniature on ivory. Eight miniatures
were acquired through the Catherine Walden Myer fund. Fifty-four
oil paintings by Edwin Scott were added to the Alice Pike Barney
Memorial Collection, and $5,000 was added to the Barney fund.
The Gallery held 10 special exhibits during the year. Under the
direction of Mrs. John A. Pope, a Smithsonian traveling exhibition
service was inaugurated, financed partly through the Barney fund
and partly from a grant made by the Department of State.

Freer Gallery of Art.—Purchases for the Freer collections included
Chinese bronzes, paintings, and pottery; an Egyptian bronze incense
burner; Persian metalwork; an Indian painting with Persian verse;
and a seventh-century Japanese bronze sculpture. The staff members
studied new accessions, examined objects contemplated for purchase,
and pursued their researches in oriental and Islamic art. A technical
research laboratory, with Rutherford J. Gettens in charge, was com-
pleted and began a new phase of Gallery activity—the investigation
’ of material and techniques of the artists and craftsmen represented
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

in the Freer collections. Dr. Ettinghausen continued his work abroad,
particularly in the Near East. The final number of Ars [slamica,
under Dr. Ettinghausen’s editorship, was published in August 1951.
Visitors to the Gallery numbered approximately 75,000.

Bureau of American Ethnology—Members of the Bureau staff
continued their ethnological and archeological researches, Director
Stirling on Mexican and Panamanian archeology, Dr. Collins on the
Eskimo and on the archeology of Cornwallis Island, Dr. Harrington
on the Maya language, Dr. Fenton on the Iroquois, and Dr. Drucker
on Meso-American archeology. Dr. Roberts continued as Director of
the River Basin Surveys. Since the beginning of this project 7 years
ago, 3,105 archeological sites have been located and recorded, and
578 of these have been recommended for excavation or limited testing.
This year’s excavation work covered 18 reservoir areas in 11 States,
with 22 excavating parties in the field.

The Institute of Social Anthropology, an autonomouse unit of the
Bureau financed through transfer of funds from the Department of
State, carried on its field programs in Brazil, Colombia, México, and
Pert. During the year activities of the Institute were integrated
with those of the Institute of Inter-American Affairs, whereby ISA an-
thropologists participated in ILAA public-health programs in Latin
America.

International Exchange Service—The International Exchange
Service is the official United States agency for the interchange of
governmental, scientific, and literary publications between this coun-
try and other nations of the world. During the past year the Ex-
change Service handled 1,001,614 packages of such publications,
weighing 825,627 pounds—9,386 packages less than last year but
36,854 pounds more. Consignments are now made to all countries
except China and Rumania. The number of sets of United States
official publications sent abroad in exchange for similar publications
of other countries is 104 (62 full and 42 partial sets). Eighty-seven
copies of the Federal Register and 94 of the Congressional Record are
also sent abroad through the Exchange Service.

National Zoological Park.—Visitors to the Zoo totaled approxi-
mately 3,300,000 for the year. At the close of the fiscal year there
were 2,675 animals in the Zoo collections, the removals during the
year (1,721) somewhat exceeding the additions (1,575). Fourteen
species of animals were received that had not previously been ex-
hibited in the National Zoological Park. Among these were an Aus-
tralian copperhead, an albino great gray kangaroo, a Bornean porcu-
pine, and a pair of MacQueen’s bustards. The United States Fish
and Wildlife Service and the United States Army Medical Unit in

SECRETARY’S REPORT Li

Malaya continued to send desirable specimens. In all, 142 creatures
were born or hatched at the Zoo—72 mammals, 55 birds, and 15
reptiles.

Astrophysical Observatory—tThe research work of the APO pro-
gressed in both of its divisions—astrophysical research and radiation
and organisms. In addition to their regular programs, both divisions
are conducting cooperative projects under contract with other Gov-
ernment agencies. Solar-radiation studies continued at the Observa-
tory’s two field stations, one at Table Mountain, Calif., and the other
at Montezuma, Chile. Five silver-disk pyrheliometers were con-
structed and furnished at cost to institutions in France, Finland, Cen-
tral Africa, Greece, and Rhode Island. The division of radiation and
organisms continued its investigations of the biochemical reactions
involved in the absorption of light energy in green plants.

National Air Museum.—Owing to the necessity of vacating all the
NAM’s storage facility at Park Ridge, Ill., space had to be found
elsewhere in order to preserve the storage collection. Through the
assistance of the National Capital Planning Commission, a plot was
made available at Suitland, Md., near Washington, D. C. Several
prefabricated buildings will be erected there to house the nearly
4,000 specimens in the storage collection until the permanent National
Air Museum Building is provided. Accessions for the year brought
additions to many phases of the aeronautical collection, including
full-sized aircraft, engines, instruments, experimental and _ scale-
model aircraft, parachutes, and trophies. In all, 110 specimens from
21 sources, comprising 30 separate accessions, were received during
the year. These are listed in the full report of the Museum (Appen-
dix 9,p.136). Members of the staff made special surveys for materials
desirable for the collections. As space and facilities permitted, im-
provements were made in the public exhibits in the Arts and Indus-
tries and Aircraft Buildings.

Canal Zone Biological Area.—The new laboratory building begun
last year at the Barro Colorado Island station was completed. Dur-
ing the year, 602 visitors came to the island; 48 of these were scientists
who used the facilities of the island to carry on studies in various bio-
logical fields. One such study, carried on over a period of years, by
Dr. Eugene Eisenmann, resulted during the year in the publication
“Annotated List of Birds of Barro Colorado Island, Panama Canal
Zone,” issued by the Smithsonian Institution. This lists 306 species.
Other than birds, seven species of vertebrate animals have been added
to the known fauna of the area since the list was published in the 1950
report—two mammals, four reptiles, and one amphibian—making in
all 486 vertebrate forms known from the island.
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952
PUBLICATIONS

The publications of the Smithsonian Institution are in two cate-
gories—those issued from federally appropriated funds (particularly
the publications of the National Museum and the Bureau of American
Ethnology, and the Smithsonian Report) and those issued under in-
come from the Institution’s various endowment funds (Smithsonian
Miscellaneous Collections, publications of the Freer Gallery of Art,
and special publications). Eight regular series are issued, plus six
others that appear less frequently. Publications are distributed free
to more than a thousand libraries, both in this country and abroad, as
well as to a large list of educational and scientific organizations and
specialists in various fields. The Smithsonian publications program is
a major part in the Institution’s endeavor to fulfill the diffusion-of-
knowledge function prescribed by its founder. In all, 144,166 copies
of Smithsonian publications were distributed during the year.

Seventy-six publications appeared under the Smithsonian imprint
during the year. Outstanding among these were: “Biological Investi-
gations in Mexico,” by Edward A. Goldman; “Middle Cambrian
Stratigraphy and Faunas of the Canadian Rocky Mountains,” by
Franco Rasetti; “The Butterflies of Virginia,” by Austin H. and Leila
F. Clark; “The Mysidacea of the United States National Museum,” by
Walter M .Tattersall; and “Symposium on Local Diversity in Iroquois
Culture,” edited by William N. Fenton. A complete list of the year’s
publications will be found in the report of the chief of the editorial
division, Appendix 12.

Smithsonian tables—There were also issued two numbers in the
Institution’s series of tables—the sixth revised edition of the Smith-
sonian Meteorological Tables, compiled by Robert J. List, of the United
States Weather Bureau; and Smithsonian Logarithmic Tables, pre-
pared by G. W. Spenceley, Rheba M. Spenceley, and E. R. Epperson,
of Miami (Ohio) University, presenting 23-decimal-place values of
common and natural logarithms. In addition, the ninth revised edi-
tion of the Smithsonian Physical Tables, compiled by W. E. Forsythe,
of Cleveland, was partly in galley proof at the end of the year.

First Ladies’ Gowns.—A\so in press at the close of the fiscal year was
a book on “The Dresses of the First Ladies of the White House,” by
Margaret W. Brown, National Museum historian. The book (8 x 10
inches in size) describes this popular collection of costumes as they are
displayed in the Arts and Industries Building. Each of the 35 gowns
of the First Ladies, from Martha Washington to Eleanor Roosevelt,
is reproduced in full color from color photographs. There are also
brief biographies and portraits of the First Ladies. Because of the
high cost of producing the volume, it will not be sent free to the

SECRETARY’S REPORT 13

Institution’s regular mailing lists but will be on sale in Smithsonian
buildings in Washington and may also be purchased by mail.

LIBRARY

A major organizational change in the Smithsonian library was
effected during the year when the largest of its branches, the National
Museum library, was physically merged with the general library for-
merly located in the Smithsonian Building, and all major library
functions were consolidated. The consolidated library and offices are
housed in the Natural History Building. The library received 60,512
publications during the year, mostly by gifts and through exchanges
with other institutions and organizations. Noteworthy among the
gifts were more than a thousand volumes from the library of the late
Gen. John J. Pershing and more than 1,500 publications on stamps
from Franklin R. Bruns, Jr., National Museum curator of philately.
Nearly 23,000 publications were transferred to the Library of Con-
gress, about 8,000 to the Army Medical Library, and 425 to other
Government libraries. From the library’s huge collection of dupli-
cates, 11,420 pieces were sent to the United States Book Exchange.
At the close of the year the library’s holdings totaled 938,740 volumes,
including 584,213 in the Smithsonian deposit at the Library of Con-
gress but exclusive of incomplete volumes of serials and separates
and reprints from serials.
APPENDIX 1

Report on the United States National Museum

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the condi-
tion and operations of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1952:

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

Construction was completed on the conversion of the southwest
court in the Arts and Industries Building to a modern storage facility,
providing 8,000 square feet of space on the ground, mezzanine, second,
and third floors. Outside contracts amounting to $13,582 were let
for the construction of wooden frames for storage cases and drawers.
The frames of the storage cases will be covered with sheets of thin
steel by the Institution’s own mechanics.

COLLECTIONS

During the year 607,354 specimens (approximately twice as many
as last year) were added to the national collections and distributed
among the six departments as follows: Anthropology, 4,852; zoology,
251,290; botany, 62,476; geology, 279,968; engineering and industries,
1,638; and history, 7,180. Most of the accessions were acquired as
gifts from individuals or as transfers from Government departments
and agencies. The complete report on the Museum, published as a
separate document, includes a detailed list of the year’s acquisitions,
of which the more important are summarized below. Catalog entries
in all departments now total 33,184,494.

Anthropology—A well-documented symbolic wampum belt, which
had served as a token of peace and friendship after the eighteenth-
century wars between the Seneca and Wyandot (Huron) Indians,
was presented by Howard W. Elkinton. An outstanding addition
to the archeological collection is the gift by Robert C. Cook of a
carved and painted wooden cup, which was referred to as a kero
(wooden beer cup) by the Inca Indians.

By a bequest from the late Mrs. Emily V. Taylor, the Museum re-
ceived a Philadelphia high chest or highboy of unusual design and
workmanship of the period 1760-70. A recent noteworthy gift
from Mr. and Mrs. Robert ©. Pierson, Jr., consists of a complete

14

SECRETARY’S REPORT 15

miniature theater set of 130 appurtenances of the Javanese puppet
show, wayang, which they obtained from a puppet master in the
Sundanese village of Tjiawi, West Java. Mrs. Hoffman Philip gave
a collection of religious objects, weapons, jewelry of silver filigree,
and accessories of dress, obtained in Abyssinia by her husband, the
late Hoffman Philip, while in the diplomatic service. John Smithson
and John Smithson, Jr., presented a George II silver tankard, a George
III basting spoon, a traveler’s silver wine cup, and two English
silver luster teapots.

By transfer from River Basin Surveys, the division of physical
anthropology received 78 Indian skeletons selected from 106 burials
on Buggs Island in the Roanoke River, near Clarksville, Va. This
burial area will be inundated when the dam for the reservoir is com-
pleted.

Zoology.—Received during the year were more than 251,000 zool-
ogical specimens, obtained in Alaska, Algeria, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan,
Arabia, Assam, Australia, Belgian Congo, Bolivia, Borneo, Canada,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, French West Africa, Gilbert
Islands, Japan, Manchuria, Martinique, México, Mozambique, North-
ern Rhodesia, Panamaé, Philippines, Southern Rhodesia, Turkey,
United States, and Venezuela.

The fishery investigations of the United States Fish and Wildlife
Service vessel Oregon in the Gulf of Mexico, under the leadership of
Stewart Springer, resulted in the transfer to the Museum of im-
portant and diverse collections of fishes, crustaceans, and other marine
invertebrates from the deeper waters of the gulf.

An important accession of 579 mammals, including many forms
previously not represented in the collection, from Mount Kinabalu,
northern Borneo, was received by transfer from the Army Medical
Service Graduate School. With the aid of funds furnished by the
Office of Naval Research, Dr. Henry W. Setzer of the Museum staff
obtained 141 mammals along the Arctic slope of Alaska. Charles O.
Handley, Jr., presented nearly 600 mammals, chiefly from the eastern
United States. Several shipments of mammals, totaling 133 speci-
mens, were received from Dr. W. L. Jellison, of the Rocky Mountain
Laboratory, United States Public Health Service. A collection of
183 mammals from Labrador was purchased from Dana P. Snyder
under the income from the Spencer Fullerton Baird fund. The
Biological Surveys collection was increased by 685 specimens, includ-
ing a series of Alaskan sea otters, of which a family group will be used
in the preparation of a habitat group for display in the Natural
History Building.

Ornithological field work in northern Colombia by M. A. Carriker,
Jr., financed for several years by the income from the W. L. Abbott
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

fund, came to a close during the past year. The Abbott fund also
financed in part the continuance of the Panamanian ornithological
survey by Dr. A. Wetmore and his assistant, W. M. Perrygo. The
Colombian collection comprised 1,073 bird skins, 9 skeletons, and 8
eggs; the Panamanian, 675 skins, 9 skeletons, 5 alcoholics, 9 eggs,
and 1nest. Worthy of mention this year are the 379 bird skins from
Mozambique received from Donald W. Lamm, the gift of 675 skins
of birds from Colombia by Father Antonio Olivares, and the presenta-
tion by the Musée du Congo Belge, Tervueren, of 2 specimens of the
Congo peacock, Afropavo congensis. The KE. J. Brown bequest pro-
vided funds for the purchase of 60 bird skins from the Algerian
Sahara. From the Arctic Health Research Center the Museum re-
ceived by transfer 302 skins of birds from northern Alaska which
had been collected by Dr. Laurence Irving and his assistants.

A large collection, comprising 1,165 reptiles and amphibians col-
lected by Dr. R. E. Kuntz in Egypt and adjoining countries, was
received from the Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3, and 75 reptiles
and amphibians from Mount Kinabalu, northern Borneo, were trans-
ferred to the Museum from the Army Medical Service Graduate
School. Types and paratypes of new forms of salamander, toad, and
snake were received, respectively, from M. B. Mittleman, Ottys San-
ders, and W. Auffenberg.

The generous gift of 16,417 fishes from eastern United States by
Dr. E. A. Lachner, associate curator, represents the largest single
accession received by the division of fishes during the year. Dr.
Lachner, with the assistance of William T. Leapley, also obtained
more than 15,000 fishes, as well as crustaceans, insects, amphibians, and
reptiles, in the southeastern States. As exchanges there were ob-
tained from the Museum of Comparative Zoology, through William
C. Schroeder, 104 holotypes, cotypes, and paratypes of fishes; from
Dr. George Moore, Oklahoma A. & M. College, 5,115 named fresh-
water fishes from the Arkansas and Red Rivers; from Dr. J. J.
Hoedeman, Zoologisch Museum, Amsterdam, 11 paratypes of 3 West
Indian species; from Dr. N. B. Marshall, British Museum of Natural
History, 5 paratypes; and from Drs. J. Béhlke and John C. Briggs, of
Stanford University, 7 paratypes of new species of fishes being de-
scribed by them. Dr. Clark Hubbs, University of Texas, sent a gift
of 88 fishes, and Cecil Miles, Ministeria de Agricultura, Bogota,
Colombia, donated the holotype of a new pomadasid fish from the
Colombian Caribbean. Through Stewart Springer, Harvey R. Bullis,
Jr., Isaac Ginsburg, and Dayton Lee Alverson, the United States Fish

EXPLORATION AND FIELD WORK

Through the cooperation of the National Geographic Society and
the United States Air Force, Frank M. Setzler made a survey of the
human and animal effigies located along the Colorado River near the
towns of Blythe and Ripley, Calif., and near Topock, Ariz. During
the year Dr. W. W. Taylor, Jr., directed six trips for the prehistoric
Pueblo ecology survey in the Four Corners district of Arizona, Utah,
Colorado, and New Mexico. As the representative of the Smithsonian
Institution, H. W. Krieger attended the Fifth Interamerican Congress
of Municipal History at Ciudad Trujillo, Dominican Republic, and
subsequently revisited and examined the site of the first planned set-
tlement in the New World, which had been established by Christopher
Columbus in December 1498, on his second voyage, at La Isabella. A
Neosha grant enabled John C. Ewers to continue his field studies of
Blackfoot crafts on reservations in Alberta, Canada, and Montana.
Dr. Waldo R. Wedel was detailed to the Smithsonian River Basin Sur-
veys for an archeological field investigation of the Oahe Reservoir area
along the Missouri River in Stanley County, S. Dak.

Field work of recent years on the distribution and variation of the
bird life of the Republic of Panama, by Dr. Alexander Wetmore,
Secretary, assisted by Watson M. Perrygo, of the United States Na-
tional Museum, was continued during February and March. Follow-
ing several days occupied with business matters relating to the Canal
Zone Biological Area, Dr. Wetmore crossed to the Caribbean side of
the Isthmus where his field outfit, through the cooperation of the
United States Air Force at Albrook Field, was transported by truck
to the road end at the mouth of the Rio Salud, west of the Canal Zone.
Here porters were hired for transport along the beach trail to the
mouth of the Rio Indio in the western edge of the Province of Coldén.
’ The Rio Indio is one of the longest rivers in western Panama, as it
22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

heads in the mountains to the north of El Valle de Anton, where col-
lections were made on the headwaters last year. Field work begun
on February 14 covered the coastal area inland to Chilar, and on
February 21 the party moved inland to the head of canoe navigation
at El Uracillo in northern Coclé Province. After two weeks’ work
there, and a further week at the mouth of the river, work terminated
on March 12.

The region is still one of forest, though clearing and cultivation are
going forward rapidly. Vegetation was heavy, and although this
was the dry season there were daily rains except in the immediate
area of the coast. The collections obtained give much valuable data
on distribution, particularly since the region has been unknown
ornithologically.

Following this, the party worked from March 14 to 24 on Taboga
Island, opposite the Pacific end of the Panama Canal, a region as dry
as the Caribbean area was humid. The avifauna is extremely limited
but has yielded interesting and unexpected information that will be
embodied in a short paper covering Taboga and the adjacent islands
of Taboguilla and Urava, to be published during next fiscal year in
the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.

The ornithological survey of Colombia, carried on for several years
through M. A. Carriker, Jr., opened this season at the end of January
in the southern part of the republic near Puracé. Operations in the
main covered regions accessible from Popayan, with one excursion to
the lowland areas in the Territory of Caqueta. The work has been
highly successful, and this season completes the survey. The speci-
mens obtained this year from the Departments of Cauca and Huila
will be especially important in assistance in the study of the earlier
collections from farther north.

The detail of Dr. David H. Johnson to the Army Medical Service
Graduate School research unit, engaged in a study of mammalian and
other hosts involved in the transmission of scrub typhus in the vicinity
of Mount Kinabalu, British North Borneo, was continued from June
to August 1951. The ecological survey of the mammals of the Arctic
slope of Alaska, commenced by Dr. Henry W. Setzer under a coopera-
tive arrangement with the Arctic Research Laboratory, Office of Naval
Research, Point Barrow, Alaska, was concluded in August 1951.
Charles O. Handley, Jr., in continuation of his studies on the mammals
of eastern United States, especially of the southern Appalachian high-
lands, conducted field work in the Great Smoky Mountains National
Park during April 1952. On June 15, 1952, Mr. Handley sailed from
New York as a member of an expedition, sponsored and led by
Laurence K. Marshall, of Cambridge, Mass., which will be engaged

SECRETARY'S REPORT 23

in anthropological and zoological field work over a period of several
months in the Kalahari Desert region of South-West Africa.

During April 1952, Dr. E. A. Lachner and William T. Leapley in-
vestigated the ecology and life history of fresh-water fishes in the
streams draining the mountain and Piedmont plateau sections of the
Atlantic slope from Virginia southward to Georgia and thence west-
ward in the streams of the Gulf coast drainage to Alabama. After
crossing the Mississippi flatlands, field work was continued in the
river systems of northeastern Texas and Oklahoma. On the return
trip collections were made in the streams of the Ozark uplands in
Arkansas and also in those of Kentucky. <A collecting trip which
extended from near Shreveport, La., to Kerrville and Laredo, Tex.,
and thence down the Rio Grande Valley to Padre Island and eastward
along the Gulf coast, to procure insects prevalent only in the fall
months, was made by Oscar L. Cartwright during September—October
1951. At the request of the Pacific Science Board, National Research
Council, Dr. Joseph P. E. Morrison of the division of mollusks was
detailed early in June 1952 to make an ecological survey of Raroia
Atoll in the Tuamotu Islands.

From February to May 1952, Dr. Lyman B. Smith, through the
cooperation of the Rockefeller Foundation and various Brazilian
agencies, notably the Servigo Nacional de Malaria, the Herbario
“Barbosa Rodrigues,” the Museu Nacional, the Jardin Botanico do
Rio de Janeiro, and the Instituto de Botanico do Sao Paulo, carried
on a field study of the relation of the Bromeliaceae to malarial control
in eastern Brazil between Para and Santa Catarina. Dr. Egbert H.
Walker returned to Washington, D. C., on September 30, 1951, after
the completion of the botanical field work on the Ryukyu Islands spon-
sored by the Pacific Science Board, National Research Council. In
October 1951, Jason R. Swallen arrived in Honduras where, as the
guest of the Escuela Agricola Panamericana, he was provided trans-
portation that enabled him to collect grasses in the pine forests, open
grasslands, and cloud forests, principally in the Departments of
Morazan and El Paraiso.

During the year seven field trips were made for the purpose of col-
lecting fossils and studying geological strata. A. L. Bowsher and
William T. Allen, with the assistance of members of the staff of the
New Mexico Bureau of Mines, assembled invertebrate fossils from the
Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and Permian strata in the Sacramento
Mountains, N. Mex. In the latter half of October, Dr. G. A. Cooper
joined Dr. B. N. Cooper, of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, in a
study of the facies relationships of nonmarine Ordovician beds in the
southern Appalachians. Late in October 1951, A. L. Bowsher accom-

236639—53 8
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

panied Dr. Edwin Kirk, of the United States Geological Survey, to
Alabama and Tennessee to obtain Mississippian crinoids. Dr. A. R.
Loeblich, Jr., secured foraminiferal samples from the uppermost
Lower Cretaceous and basal Upper Cretaceous beds in northern Texas.
Mississippian and Pennsylvanian invertebrate fossils were collected
in northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania by A. L. Bowsher and
William T. Allen in April 1952. Dr. C. L. Gazin continued his investi-
gation, during the summer of 1951, of the mammalian faunal horizons
of the lower Eocene Knight formation in the Green River or Bridger
basins of southwestern Wyoming and the lower Oligocene deposits in
the Wind River basin. During October 1951, Dr. David H. Dunkle
examined briefly reported occurrences of Cretaceous fishes at Xilitla,
San Luis Potosi, and Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca, México.

A grant of funds from Edwin A. Link, of Binghamton, N. Y., en-
abled Mendel L. Peterson to join Mr. Link at Marathon, Fla., and
participate in a survey of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Spanish
and British ships which had been wrecked on the reefs between
Tavernier Key and Vaca Key, and on West Sambo Reef lying off Key
West. The 65-ton diesel-powered boat, Sea Diver, owned and equip-
ped by Mr. Link for this survey, afforded a base for diving operations.
Cannon barrels and balls, iron hull fittings, iron nails, cast-iron ingots,
and fragments of wood hulls were recovered from the wrecks on these
reefs.

The attendance for the general, congressional, and special tours
and the “Picture of the Week” totaled 36,756, while the attendance
at the 48 auditorium lectures on Sunday afternoons was approximately
14,284 during the fiscal year 1952.

Special tours, lectures, and conferences arranged for by appointment

Education functioning under the point-4 program of the Department
of State, groups from various other governmental departments, high-
school and college students, women’s clubs, Brownies, Scouts, Sunday
school classes, and groups from national conventions meeting in the
city. This service also included the training of Junior League vol-
unteers who thereafter conducted tours for art students in the Wash-
ington high schools and a training program for members of the
Arlington American Association of University Women who served
as volunteer docents and conducted tours in the Gallery for all the
Arlington public-school children in grades two through six.

The monthly Calendar of Events announcing all the Gallery activ-
ities, including notices of exhibitions, new publications, lectures,
gallery talks, tours, and concerts, was mailed to more than 4,000
persons.

ceived on exchange. A total of 301 copies of the illustrated catalog
of “Paintings and Sculpture from the Kress Collection,” and 299
copies of the catalog “Renaissance Bronzes from the Kress Collection”
were sent on exchange to other museums. The Library is the deposi-
tory for photographs of the works of art in the collections of the
National Gallery of Art. A stock of reproductions is maintained for
use in research occupations by the curatorial and other departments
of the Gallery ; for the dissemination of knowledge to qualified sources;
for exchange with other art institutions; for publicity; and for sale
at the request of any interested individual.

The photographic collection has grown with new bequests and
loans made to the National Gallery of Art during the year. A sub-
stantial addition has occurred in the instance of the new loans from
Chester Dale. The photographic file continues to present a complete
pictorial record for reference to all the objects in the Gallery as well
as to provide limited quantities of 8-x-10’’ prints for distribution.

During the year 641 persons other than the Gallery staff used the
Library for research.

INDEX OF AMERICAN DESIGN

During the fiscal year 1952 a total of 9 new exhibits containing 396
renderings were completed. Permission was granted for the repro-
duction of 183 plates, while 743 photographs were distributed for
use by designers, possible publication, research, study, and publicity.
A total of 1,016 slides were circulated and several designs from the
Index were adapted for commercial use on drapery material, furni-
ture, and playing cards. The entire collection of 1,666 2-x-2’’ color
slides was organized into 20 loan sets and 1 miscellaneous group for
loan to individual lecturers, museums, schools, and colleges.

MAINTENANCE OF THE BUILDING AND GROUNDS

The usual work in connection with the care and maintenance of
the building, its mechanical equipment, and the grounds was continued
throughout the year. Considerable redecorating was done, including
the painting of several galleries and offices. Flowering and foliage
plants, totaling in number 5,869 and valued at approximately $7,700,
were grown in the moats and were used for decoration in the garden
courts throughout the year.

The lawn-sprinkler system was extended to include several grass
areas between Constitution Avenue and the sidewalk adjacent thereto.

During the winter months, all the refrigeration machines were given
an annual overhauling which included the balancing of the rotors,
the cleaning and testing of new parts, and the necessary repairs in

SECRETARY’S REPORT 39

order to place them in condition for the summer months. During
the process laboratory tests revealed that two of the machines needed
certain replacements. This condition was called to the attention of
the manufacturers, and the Gallery was informed by them on June
20, 1952, as well as by the Vermilya-Brown Co., that the condition
was serious and it would be necessary to replace the condensers, com-
pressors, and coolers in all three machines. Estimates obtained
indicated that this work would cost about $187,500. These funds were
made available in a supplemental appropriation bill by the Eighty-
second Congress for use for this purpose during the fiscal year 1953.

Two sections of skylight, representing an area of approximately
850 square feet, were completely overhauled, and this work of skylight
repair is being continued.

The American District, Telegraph Co.’s automatic fire-alarm sys-
tem was extended to the two storage areas on the 81-foot level north
and south of the rotunda.

The Gallery’s staff did a considerable amount of work in connection
with the new storage vault, especially in the installation of steel storage

racks.
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW GALLERIES

Work under the contract entered into on July 31, 1950, for the con-
struction of galleries 35, 354A, 40, 41, and 41A in the southwest end
of the building was completed in January 1952. Private funds were
made available for this purpose.

CONSTRUCTION OF STORAGE FACILITIES

The completion of the work under the contract entered into March
1, 1951, for building a storage room adjacent to the Gallery building
in the southeast moat, has been delayed because of the difficulty en-
countered in obtaining certain materials called for in the specifications,
and it is now anticipated that this project will be completed late in
the summer of 1952.

Work under the contract entered into on March 2, 1951, to build
a storage building and reconstruct a cottage on the site of Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College, Lynchburg, Va., was completed in April
1952. Both of these projects were made possible by private funds
donated for these purposes.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

A total of 48 Sunday evening concerts were given during the fiscal
year in the West Garden Court. The National Gallery Orchestra,
under the direction of Richard Bales, played 11 concerts at the Gallery

236639—53——4

40 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

with 4 additional performances in Charlottesville and Middleburg,
Va. Two of the orchestral concerts at the Gallery were made possible
by the Music Performance Trust Fund of the American Federation
of Musicians. The orchestra also gave two children’s concerts at the
Corcoran Gallery of Art. During April the Sunday evenings were
devoted to the Gallery’s Ninth Annual American Music Festival,
featuring 34 works by 15 American composers. Most of the concerts
were broadcast in their entirety by Station WCFM, Washington, and
those of the National Gallery Orchestra and the American Music
Festival were carried by the Continental FM Network. The Na-
tional Gallery Orchestra made two long-playing records, one of which
was selected by the New York Times for its list of outstanding record-
ings of the year 1951. During August and September 1951 the Na-
tional Gallery Orchestra played the first regular series of symphonic
music on television as part of the NBC “Heritage” programs of art
and music originating in the Gallery. This was selected by the New
York Times as the finest serious music program of 1951 on television.

The photographic laboratory of the Gallery produced 14,028 prints,
390 black-and-white slides, and 928 color slides during the fiscal year,
in addition to 8,214 negatives, as well as X-rays, infrared, and ultra-
violet photographs.

During the fiscal year 1952, a total of 2,698 press releases were issued
with respect to Gallery activities, while 161 permits to copy paintings,
and 240 permits to photograph in the Gallery were issued.

OTHER GIFTS

Report on the National Collection of Fine Arts

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the National Collection of Fine Arts for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1952:

THE SMITHSONIAN ART COMMISSION

The twenty-ninth annual meeting of the Smithsonian Art Commis-
sion was held in the Regents’ Room of the Smithsonian Building on
Tuesday, December 4, 1951. ‘The members present were: Paul Man-
ship, chairman; Alexander Wetmore, secretary (member, ex oflicio) ;
Robert Woods Bliss, Gilmore D. Clarke, George H. Edgell, David
E. Finley, George Hewitt Myers, Archibald Wenley, Lawrence Grant
White, Andrew Wyeth, and Mahonri Young. Thomas M. Beggs,
Director, National Collection of Fine Arts, and Paul V. Gardner,
curator of ceramics, National Collection of Fine Arts, were also
present.

The Commission recommended the reelection of George H. Edgell,
Lloyd Goodrich, and Lawrence Grant White for the usual 4-year
period. As James E. Fraser had been unable to attend the meetings
for several years, his status was changed to that of member emeritus.
The secretary was instructed to send a letter on behalf of the Com-
mission expressing thanks for Mr. Fraser’s services and a desire for
his presence at its future meetings. The Commission recommended
to the Board of Regents the appointment of Walker Hancock to
membership.

The following officers were elected for the ensuing year: Paul
Manship, chairman; Robert Woods Bliss, vice chairman, and Dr.
Alexander Wetmore, secretary. The following were elected members
of the executive committee for the ensuing year: David E. Finley,
chairman, Robert Woods Bliss, Gilmore D. Clarke, and George Hewitt
Myers. Paul Manship, as chairman of the Commission, and Dr.
Alexander Wetmore, as secretary of the Commission, are ex officio
members of the executive committee.

Mr. Beggs reported that gifts received during 1951 include a fund
established by Mrs. Laura Dreyfus-Barney for the purpose of main-
taining a lending collection to advance the appreciation and creation

-of art throughout the United States. The capital of $15,000 is to

41
42 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

be increased during the next 3 years by annual additions of $5,000.
Ultimately the fund will help substantially the National Collection
of Fine Arts in carrying out the authorization in its act of estab-
lishment for the circulation of traveling exhibitions.

The Barney fund, in conjunction with a grant made last June by
the Department of State for the assembling of 12 exhibitions to be sent
to West Germany and Austria, has permitted the Institution to obtain
the services of Mrs. John A. Pope and Miss Gladys E. Acton, who
will handle, under the direction of the National Collection of Fine
Arts, the details of the new Smithsonian Traveling Exhibition Service.
With the National Gallery of Art and the Freer Gallery of Art serving
as national repositories for rare and valuable paintings, sculptures,
and art objects of the best periods of European and oriental art, it is
now the acknowledged responsibility of the National Collection of
Fine Arts to encourage contemporary art and artists.

The Commission accepted the following objects for the National
Collection of Fine Arts:

Oil, Nancy, by George DeForest Brush, N. A. (1855-1941). Henry Ward
Ranger bequest.

ment of the technical research laboratory with its specialized library
and new field of subject headings and bibliography problems has
increased and broadened the work of the library.

REPRODUCTIONS

During the year the photographic laboratory made 4,547 prints,
506 glass negatives, and 144 lantern slides.

BUILDING

The general condition of the building is good, both inside and
out, and the maintenance and operation continue satisfactory; the
mechanical equipment, though inadequate, continues in working order.
A temporary painter again helped out with the most urgent work,
but the lack of a full-time painter is reflected in the gradual deteriora-
tion of the appearance of the exhibition galleries and other interior
areas.

The major project of the cabinet shop was the completion and fur-

closet, bookcases, specimen cases, instrument cases, microscope table,
and examining table were built and installed to meet the specifications
of the associate in technical research.

Eight new exhibition cases are under construction, and miscella-
neous odd jobs in care of office and Gallery equipment, crating, etc.,
continue as usual.

ATTENDANCE

The Gallery was open to the public from 9 to 4: 30 every day except
Christmas Day. The total number of visitors to come in the main
entrance was 74,940. The highest monthly attendance was in August,
10,714, and the lowest was in December, 2,507. There were 1,498
visitors to the office during the year.

HERZFELD ARCHIVE

Mrs. Charlotte Bradford, sister of the late Ernst Herzfeld, pre-
sented to the Herzfeld Archive further manuscripts and notes pre-
pared by Professor Herzfeld. The Herzfeld material continues to
be used by experts in Near Eastern archeology throughout the world.

STAFF ACTIVITIES

The work of the staff members has been devoted to the study of
new accessions, of objects contemplated for purchase, and of objects
submitted for examination, as well as to individual research projects
in the fields represented by the collections of Chinese, Japanese,
Persian, Arabic, and Indian materials. Reports, oral or written, and
exclusive of those made by the laboratory which are listed below,
were made upon 4,385 objects as follows: belonging to private in-
dividuals, 1,749; belonging to dealers, 485; belonging to other
museums, 2,151. In all, 654 photographs of objects were examined
and 504 oriental language inscriptions were translated for outside
individuals and institutions. By request 10 groups totaling 357 per-
sons met in the exhibition galleries for docent service by staff mem-
bers; and 2 groups totaling 24 persons were given docent service in
the study-storage rooms.

With the completion of the technical research laboratory and
the appointment of Rutherford J. Gettens as associate in technical
research, a new phase of Gallery activity was inaugurated. Its
purpose is to carry on a continuing investigation of the methods
and materials used by the artists and craftsmen in the ancient civili-
zations represented by objects in the Gallery collections. The labora-
tory was ready for occupancy in March, and Mr. Gettens carried out
the installation of new equipment and materials, including a large

SECRETARY'S REPORT 53

binocular microscope on extendable arm, a chemical microscope, a
metalographic microscope with vertical illuminator, and a photo-
micrographic camera. Also included is a wide selection of standard
chemical apparatus, reagents, and supplies, including ovens, furnaces,
and equipment for glassworking and electrolysis. Reference files,
technical library, and the collection of specimens of pigments, min-
erals, polished metals, and microscopic slide mounts were put in
order. Certain research projects were undertaken while the settle-
ment was still in progress, and by the end of the fiscal year work had
begun on the Gallery collections and 40 reports had been made on
objects submitted for technical examination by outside individuals and
institutions.

Dr. Ettinghausen continued his work abroad. Leaving Afghani-
stan early in July, he spent 3 weeks in Pakistan and India and then
returned to Iran for 5 weeks, during which time Mrs. Ettinghausen
completed her photographic work on the Ardebil Chinese porcelains
for Mr. Pope’s publication of the material he studied there in 1950.
Continuing westward Dr. Ettinghausen spent 6 weeks in Turkey
and 2 weeks each in Morocco and Spain, with shorter visits to Leba-
non, Syria, Jordan, Greece, Tunisia, and Algeria on the way. He
returned to the Gallery in December after an absence of 14 months
during which he studied most of the important monuments of Islamic
culture.

By invitation the following lectures were given outside the Gallery

APPENDIX 5
Report on the Bureau of American Ethnology

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1952, conducted
in accordance with the act of Congress of April 10, 1928, as amended
August 22, 1949, which provides for continuing “independently or in
cooperation anthropological researches among the American Indians
and the natives of lands under the jurisdiction or protection of the
United States and the excavation and preservation of archeologic
remains.”

Information was furnished during the year by members of the
Bureau staff in reply to numerous inquiries concerning the American
Indians, past and present, of both continents. The increased number
of requests from teachers of primary and secondary grades and from
Scout organizations indicates a rapidly growing interest in the Ameri-
can Indian. Various specimens sent to the Bureau were identified
and data on them furnished for their owners.

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

Dr. M. W. Stirling, Director of the Bureau, devoted most of his
time during the fiscal year to administrative affairs and to the prep-
aration of manuscript on previous field studies in Panama and
southern México. During the year he prepared three reports for
publication: “Stone Monuments of the Rio Chiquito, México,” “The
Use of Jade in Aboriginal America,” and “An Archeological Survey
of Southern Veracruz, Tabasco, and Northern Campeche.”

Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., Associate Director of the Bureau
and Director of the River Basin Surveys, devoted most of his time dur-
ing the year to the management and direction of the River Basin Sur-
veys. In August he went to Lincoln, Nebr., to inspect the Missouri
Basin headquarters. From Lincoln, accompanied by Paul L. Cooper,
field director, he proceeded to the Fort Randall Reservoir area near
Chamberlain, S. Dak., and visited a number of archeological sites that
were being excavated by field parties of the River Basin Surveys and
also the excavations being conducted by the Nebraska State Historical
Society. He also took part in a conference on local archeological
problems held at the field camp of the University of Kansas party

56

SECRETARY'S REPORT 57

which was excavating an Indian village site as part of the cooperative
program of the National Park Service. From the Fort Randall area
he proceeded to the Oahe Reservoir area north of Pierre, S. Dak.,
where he visited two River Basin Surveys excavating parties. From
Pierre he proceeded to Cody, Wyo., in company with Dr. Waldo R.
Wedel, curator of archeology, United States National Museum, to in-
spect an archeological site on Sage Creek where remains of early man
had been found. The purpose of that trip was to assist in planning
a series of investigations to be carried on there during the field season
of 1952 as a cooperative project between the Smithsonian Institution
and Princeton University. Returning to Pierre, Dr. Roberts held
a number of conferences with staff members to discuss the plans and
operations of the salvage program in that area. During the fall and
winter months he made several trips to the Missouri Basin headquar-
ters at Lincoln. In March he went to Columbus, Ohio, and delivered
a lecture on “Early Man in the New World” before the Ohio State
Historical Society at the State museum. He returned to Columbus in
May to attend the annual meeting of the Society for American Archae-
ology and to take part in a symposium dealing with the carbon-14
method for dating archeological remains. During the year Dr.
Roberts completed two manuscripts: “River Basin Surveys: The
First Five Years of the Inter-Agency Archeological and Paleonto-
logical Salvage Program” and “The Carbon-14 Method of Age Deter-
mination,” both of which were published in the 1951 Smithsonian
Annual Report. During the year Dr. Roberts received the Viking
Fund Medal and Award of the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthro-
pological Research for his work in American archeology.

Dr. Henry B. Collins, anthropologist, continued his research on the
Eskimo and other Arctic activities. Through arrangements with the
National Museum of Canada, his assistant of 1950, William E. Taylor,
returned to Cornwallis Island in the Canadian Arctic for further
excavations. Mr. Taylor’s collections, including Thule and Dorset
culture materials, with notes and photographs, were received by Dr.
Collins for inclusion in the final report on the Cornwallis Island work.
Preliminary reports on the first two seasons’ excavations on Cornwallis
Island were published in the annual reports of the National Museum of
Canada for the fiscal years 1949-50 and 1950-51. A general article,
“The Origin and Antiquity of the Eskimo,” summarizing the present
evidence of archeology, physical anthropology, and linguistics, was
published in the 1950 Smithsonian Annual Report. A paper on the
present status of the Dorset culture, with special emphasis on new
evidence from Greenland and Alaska, which was presented at the
December 1951 meeting of the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, will be included in a volume on American archeology
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

being published by the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological
Research. At the meeting of the Society for American Archaeology
in May 1952 Dr. Collins presented a paper summarizing and evaluating
the results of radiocarbon dating in the Arctic in the light of the arche-
ological evidence, and including an interpretation of the ancient
Denbigh Flint Complex of Alaska, its Old World connections and age,
and its relationships to Folsom, Yuma, and Eskimo. The paper will
appear in the January issue of American Antiquity. An article on
the progress of anthropology in 1951 was prepared for the Encyclo-
paedia Britannica and another on the Races of Asia for the Ency-
clopaedia Hebraica. He also edited Science in Alaska, a volume of
selected papers presented at the First Alaskan Science Conference held
in Washington in November 1950 under the auspices of the National
Academy of Sciences-National Research Council. The volume was
published by the Arctic Institute of North America and contains
papers on Alaskan anthropology, agriculture, botany, geology and
geography, geophysics, meteorology, public health, and zoology. Dr.
Collins continued to serve as chairman of the directing committee
supervising preparation of Arctic Bibliography, a comprehensive, an-
notated, and indexed bibliography of English and foreign-language
publications in all fields of science relating to the Arctic and sub-Are-
tic regions of America, Siberia, and Europe. The bibliography is
being assembled by the Arctic Institute of North America under con-
tract with the Office of Naval Research with funds from the Depart-
ments of the Army and the Navy, and the Defense Research Board
of Canada. At the end of the fiscal year material for a supplemental
volume of about 900 pages was completed and ready for the printer.
Proofreading continues on the initial six volumes of similar size now
at the Government Printing Office.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Dr. John P. Harrington was
in México engaged in studying the Maya language. On his return
to Washington he completed the preparation of a grammar and dic-
tionary of the Maya language, with the assistance of a Maya informant,
Domingo Canton Aguilar, whom he brought to Washington for that
purpose. He also completed a monograph on the numeration sys-
tem of the Valladolid Maya Indians of Yucatan. Another paper
he completed during the fiscal year was on the first vocabulary of
the Virginia Indians, compiled by William Strachey in 1612. The
original of this vocabulary is in the Bodleian Library at Oxford,
England.

At the beginning of the fiscal year and until after Labor Day, Dr.
William N. Fenton was visiting professor of anthropology at the
University of Michigan. During his stay in Ann Arbor he examined
important historical papers relating to the political history of the

SECRETARY'S REPORT 59

Six Nations, or Iroquois, in the William L. Clements Library of the
University of Michigan. Returning to Washington in September,
Dr. Fenton resumed his research at the Bureau of American Ethnol-
ogy. He organized and conducted the Seventh Conference on Iro-
quois Research held at Red House, N. Y., October 5-7. In November
he participated in a symposium on the training of professional anthro-
pologists, which was held on the occasion of the annual meetings
of the American Anthropological Association. Late in November
Dr. Fenton was called to the National Research Council to organize
a national conference on disaster studies, in which he participated
on December 6. He resigned his position with the Bureau to accept
an appointment as executive secretary of the Division of Anthro-
pology and Psychology at the National Research Council and began
his duties on January 1, 1952.

Dr. Philip Drucker reported for duty as general anthropologist
on January 8, 1952, immediately following his release to inactive duty
by the United States Navy. On February 15 he proceeded to México
D. F., for a period of 6 weeks, which he spent studying the large
offering of artifacts of jade and similar materials excavated in 1941
at Cerro de las Mesas by the National Geographic-Smithsonian
Institution archeological project. This collection is housed in the
National Museum of Mexico. On his return to Washington he pre-
pared a descriptive monograph on the collection, which was ready
to be submitted to the Director of the Bureau at the end of
the fiscal year. In addition, Dr. Drucker continued his studies of
Meso-American archeology in general.

RIVER BASIN SURVEYS
(Report prepared by FRANK H. H. Rozerts, Jr.)

The River Basin Surveys, organized in the autumn of 1945 as a unit
of the Bureau of American Ethnology to carry into effect a memo-
randum of understanding between the Smithsonian Institution and
the National Park Service, continued its operations throughout the
year. The memorandum provides for the salvage of archeological
and paleontological materials that would otherwise be lost as a resuit
of numerous projects for flood control and irrigation, hydroelectric
installations, and navigation improvements in the river basins of the
United States. As in the past, the investigations were conducted in
cooperation with the National Park Service and the Bureau of
Reclamation of the Department of the Interior, the Corps of Engi-
neers of the Department of the Army, and a number of nongovern-
mental local institutions. The operations as a whole are called the
Anter-Agency Archeological and Paleontological Salvage Program.
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

The work of the River Basin Surveys in the past fiscal year was
financed by a transfer of $156,403 to the Smithsonian Institution
by the National Park Service. Of that amount $120,783 was for
investigations in the Missouri Basin and $35,620 was for all other
areas where projects were under way. The money comprising those
funds was derived in part from the Bureau of Reclamation and in
part from the National Park Service. Carry-over of previous funds
provided an additional $77,576 for the Missouri Basin and $350 for
other areas. The total of all funds available for the year was $234,329.
Because of a delay in the passage of the appropriation bill it was
necessary to suspend operations outside the Missouri Basin during
July and August.

Activities in the field consisted of reconnaissance or surveys for
the purpose of locating archeological sites and paleontological
deposits that will be involved in construction work or are so situated
that they will be flooded, and in the excavation of sites observed and
recorded by previous surveys. In contrast to former years there was
greater emphasis on excavation. This was because of the fact that
the survey parties were finally catching up with the over-all program
and there were fewer proposed reservoir areas needing attention.
Archeological survey parties visited 10 new reservoir basins located
in 6 States and a paleontological party made preliminary investiga-
tions at 6 reservoirs in 8 States. In addition a number of reservoirs
where previous preliminary surveys had been made were revisited
for further checking. At the end of the fiscal year excavations were
completed or under way in 13 reservoir areas in 11 States. There
were 22 excavating parties in the field during the course of the year.
Six of the excavating projects were in areas where there had been no
previous digging, but the remainder were a continuation of investi-
gations at reservoir projects where there had been other operations.
At the close of the fiscal year the total of the reservoir areas where
archeological surveys had been made or excavations carried on since
the start of the actual field work in the summer of 1946 was 235
located in 25 States. The survey parties have located and reported
3,105 archeological sites, and of that number 578 have been recom-
mended for excavation or limited testing. Preliminary appraisal
reports were completed for all the reservoirs surveyed. Some,
together with others finished near the end of the previous fiscal
year, were mimeographed for limited distribution to the cooperating
agencies. During the year 15 such reports were distributed, bring-
ing to 149 the total issued since the start of the program. The
discrepancy between the latter figure and the total number of reser-
voirs is due to the fact that in some cases a series of reservoirs is
included in a single report covering a subbasin, while in others the

SECRETARY'S REPORT 61

completed manuscripts had not yet been mimeographed at the close
of the year. Excavations made during the year brought the total
for reservoir basins where such work has been done to 38, located in
17 States. Reports on some of that work have been published in
various scientific journals, and eight such papers are now in press
as a Bulletin of the Bureau of American Ethnology. The technical
reports on two other excavation projects have been finished. Paleon-
tological surveys have been made in 121 reservoir areas, 86 of them
being those where archeological work has also been done. Eventually
the other 35 will be visited by archeological parties. The total of all
reservoir basins surveyed, including those where archeological work
still remains to be done, is 270.

As of June 30, 1952, the reservoir projects which had been surveyed
for archeological remains were distributed by States as follows:
California, 20; Colorado, 24; Georgia, 4; Idaho, 11; Illinois, 2;
Towa, 3; Kansas, 7; Kentucky, 1; Louisiana, 1; Minnesota, 1; Mon-
tana, 15; Nebraska, 28; New Mexico, 1; North Dakota, 18; Ohio, 2;
Oklahoma, 7; Oregon, 27; Pennsylvania, 2; South Dakota, 9; Tennes-
see, 1; Texas, 19; Virginia, 2; Washington, 11; West Virginia, 2;
Wyoming, 21. Excavations have been made or were being made in
reservoir areas in: California, 5; Colorado, 1; Georgia, 3; Kansas, 1;
Montana, 1; Nebraska, 1; New Mexico, 1; North Dakota, 3; Okla-
homa, 2; Oregon, 2; South Carolina, 1; South Dakota, 3; Texas, ae
Virginia, 1; Washington, 3; West Virginia, 1; Wyoming, 2. The
foregoing figures refer only to the work of the River Basin Surveys or
that which was done in direct cooperation with local institutions.
Projects carried on by local institutions alone or in direct cooperation
with the National Park Service are not included because complete
information about them was not available.

Throughout the year the River Basin Surveys continued to recelve
helpful cooperation from the National Park Service, the Bureau of
Reclamation, the Corps of Engineers, and numerous State and local
institutions. Ata number of projects guides and transportation were
furnished to staff members in the field. ‘Temporary office and labora-
tory space was provided at others, and on several occasions labor and
mechanical equipment were made available by the construction agency.
Such assistance speeded up the work of the field men and made pos-
sible greater accomplishment than would otherwise have been the
case. The National Park Service continued to serve as the liaison
between the various agencies both in Washington and through its
several regional offices and provided the Smithsonian Institution with
necessary information about the locations for proposed dams and
reservoirs and construction priorities. Furthermore, the National
Park Service primarily was responsible for obtaining the funds which
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

made the operations possible. The progress of the program as a
whole was greatly furthered by the enthusiastic help of Park Service
personnel,

General direction and supervision of the work in California, Geor-
gia, and Virginia were from the main office in Washington. In the
Columbia Basin the program was directed from a field office and
laboratory at Eugene, Oreg.; that in the Missouri Basin was under
the supervision of a field office and laboratory at Lincoln, Nebr.; and
that in Texas was under a field office and laboratory at Austin. The
materials collected by the survey and excavating parties in those three
areas were processed at the respective field laboratories. The collec-
tions made in Georgia were processed at a laboratory in Athens.

At the end of the fiscal year a change was made in the plan of
operations for the Inter-Agency Salvage Program. The work of the
River Basin Surveys was terminated in the Columbia Basin and Pacific
coast areas, in the Southwest including Texas, and in Georgia and
other portions of the Southeast. With the beginning of the new
fiscal year the direction and supervision of the investigations in those
areas were to be under the National Park Service with its respective
regional offices in direct charge. At the close of the year arrange-
ments were being made to transfer certain of the River Basin Surveys’
personnel to the National Park Service and for the latter agency to
take over the various field headquarters.

Washington office —Throughout the fiscal year the main headquar-
ters of the River Basin Surveys continued under the direction of
Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr. Carl F. Miller, Joseph R. Caldwell, and
Ralph S. Solecki, archeologists, were based on that office. Because of
lack of funds for work outside the Missouri Basin, however, Miller
was assigned to the Missouri Basin project during July, August, and
September, and Caldwell was on leave without pay until Septem-
ber 10, 1952. Solecki was on leave of absence with an expedition to
Iraq for most of the year, returning to duty with the surveys in May.

Mr. Miller’s activities in the Missouri Basin are discussed in that
section of this report. During the fall and winter months at the
Washington office he completed his technical paper on the excavations
he supervised at the Allatoona Reservoir in Georgia during an earlier
fiscal year and processed specimens from sites which he dug at the
John H. Kerr (formerly called Buggs Island) Reservoir the latter
part of the previous fiscal year. In May he returned to the John H.
Kerr Reservoir area on the Roanoke River in southern Virginia and
carried on test excavations at a number of sites. That work was
completed on June 30 and Mr. Miller returned to Washington. The
gates of the dam were scheduled to be closed early in July, and no
further investigations are planned for that area.

SECRETARY'S REPORT 63

Early in August Mr. Caldwell received word that an important
site located a short distance above the Clark Hill Dam on the Savan-
nah River, Ga., would be inundated well in advance of the date
originally indicated by the engineers. With funds provided by the
Smithsonian Institution and the University of Georgia and with the
help of the resident engineer of the Corps of Engineers, he started
excavations on the 18th of the month and continued to dig until he
and his party were driven out by water at the end of October. When
Federal funds became available in September the River Basin Sur-
veys took over the financing of the project. During January and Feb-
ruary Mr. Caldwell carried on test excavations at the remains of Fort
Charlotte at the upper end of the Clark Hill Reservoir in South Caro-
lina. While at his headquarters at Athens, Mr. Caldwell completed
five preliminary reports and made considerable progress on the final
technical report of his part of the excavations at the Allatoona Reser-
voir. The report on Fort Charlotte was mimeographed and ready
for distribution at the close of the fiscal year. An article on work
completed a previous fiscal year, “The Booger Bottom Mound: A
Forsyth Period Site in Hall County, Ga.,” was published in Ameri-
can Antiquity, volume 17, No. 4, April 1952. Mr. Caldwell’s employ-
ment by the River Basin Surveys was terminated as of June 30, 1952,
by his transfer to the National Park Service.

Dr. Theodore E. White, geologist, divided his time between the
Washington office and the Missouri Basin. He spent the winter and
early spring months in Washington cleaning, identifying, and cata-
loging specimens he had collected during the field season. He also
identified four lots of mammal bones from archeological excavations
along the Columbia River, and four lots of bones from the Missouri
Basin which were sent to Washington for that purpose. He com-
pleted a manuscript, “Preliminary Analysis of the Vertebrate Fossil
Fauna of the Canyon Ferry Reservoir Area,” which was accepted for
publication in the Proceedings of the United States National Museum,
and two papers on observations on the butchering techniques of ab-
original peoples as indicated by the bones from the refuse deposits at
archeological sites. One paper, “Preliminary Analysis of the Verte-
brate Fossil Fauna of the Boysen Reservoir Area,” was published in
the Proceedings of the United States National Museum, volume 102,
No. 3296, April 1952. Another, “Observations on the Butchering
Technique of Some Aboriginal Peoples, I,” appeared in American
Antiquity, volume 17, No. 4, April 1952. A third, “Suggestions for
Facilitating Identification of Animal Bone from Archeological
Sites,” was printed in the Plains Archeological Conference News
Letter, volume 5, No. 1, May 1952. In May Dr. White left Washing-
_ton to continue his field investigations in the Missouri Basin.
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

After his return to active duty Mr. Solecki spent the time until
June 30 working on manuscripts and reports. He also made prepara-
tions for an aerial survey of certain reservoir areas in the Missouri
Basin and was to proceed to the latter area at the beginning of the
new fiscal year.

California.—The only work in California during the fiscal year was
at the Cachuma Reservoir on the Santa Ynez River in Santa Barbara
County. From April 28 to June 30 Albert D. Mohr, field assistant,
supervised excavations at two sites. At one of them a cemetery be-
longing to what is called the Hunting Culture, the middle stage of a
three-culture sequence, was dug, and in addition the remains of a house
belonging to the same horizon were uncovered. ‘The latter are of par-
ticular interest because only two such structures were known pre-
viously and the one discovered this year has added considerable
information with respect to construction methods. Opening of graves
in the cemetery produced skeletal material useful in determining the
physical characteristics of the people and also good data on burial
customs. The other site, also mainly a burial ground, belongs to a
later horizon probably attributable to the Chumash.

A report by Martin A. Baumhoff, field assistant the previous year, on
the investigations at the Cachuma Reservoir in late fiscal 1951 was
completed early in June 1952 and the manuscript is now available for
publication. A summary report on the results of the excavations
made at the Terminus Reservoir on the Kaweah River in Tulare
County was completed by Franklin Fenenga, archeologist, during the
autumn months and was published in American Antiquity, volume 17,
No. 4, April 1952.

As indicated in the preliminary section of this report, the River
Basin Surveys will have no further projects in California, as the
operations there are to be under the direction and supervision of the
Region Four office of the National Park Service.

Columbia Basin.—The field oflice at Eugene, Oreg., was closed from
July 1 to September 10 because of lack of funds, and during that
period there were no activities in the region. After the office was
reopened and until the close of the fiscal year the operations for the
Columbia Basin were, as in the previous year, under the supervision
of Joel L. Shiner. Office and laboratory work during the fall and
winter months was mainly concerned with the processing, study, and
cataloging of materials from the surveys and excavations of the pre-
vious year. Most of the materials and data were from a habitation
site in the McNary Reservoir area which had been buried beneath a
thick mantle of volcanic ash which is estimated to be several thousand
years old. A summary report on the results of that excavation was
finished, mimeographed, and distributed to the operating agencies.
Study of the materials from another site in the McNary area, a village

SECRETARY’S REPORT 65

of late prehistoric and early historic times, was also completed and a
summary report finished. The latter was mimeographed and dis-
tributed in June.

Late in October Mr. Shiner made a brief investigation at the site
of The Dalles Dam on the Columbia River and in March made an
exhaustive survey of the area to be flooded. A brief preliminary re-
port was issued after the first visit, while a second and more detailed
one was written and mimeographed following the investigations in
March. The survey showed that there were 10 sites and that 3 were
worthy of further investigation. One of them is a very large mound
with stratified deposits some 15 feet in depth. It offers one of the best
opportunities along the Columbia River for obtaining evidence on the
sequence of cultural development. This mound, the Wakemap, is in
danger from two sources, flooding and looting by private collectors.
The situation with respect to unauthorized digging was so critical that
plans were being made to start excavations there shortly after the be-
ginning of the new fiscal year. Two other sites in the area were tested
later in the spring and one of them proved to be much deeper and
richer in artifacts than had been anticipated. One test pit, 5 feet
square, yielded large numbers of flaked-stone tools and “fetish” stones
and reached a depth of 13 feet. More extended excavations at that
location are indicated.

From April 7 to 19 Mr. Shiner carried on test excavations at three
sites in the McNary area. One of them consisted of an occupation
level underlying the same layer of volcanic ash as that covering the
site worked the previous year. The findings corroborated those oi
the previous year and in addition the digging produced several new
artifact types. At another it appeared that the Indians who had
occupied it moved in shortly after the fall of the ash. The interval
represented by the ash layer will help to explain certain differences
in the artifacts and provides a good basis for establishing relative
dating in the district. Excavations at the third site proved fruitless.
The latter part of April Mr. Shiner moved his field party to the Albeni
Falls Reservoir project on the Pend Oreille River in Idaho for the
purpose of testing a number of sites in that basin. The occupational
debris at the various locations was found to be so shallow, however,
that extensive digging was not warranted. Consequently the party
spent several days making surface collections. A good series of
specimens was obtained which will be useful in extending the known
distribution of types. The data collected indicate that the area
never had a permanent population. It apparently was a place where
various groups of Indians spent their summers hunting, fishing, and
gathering food.

_ After returning to the office Mr. Shiner devoted most of his time
to processing the artifacts collected in the field. Over 1,500 were
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

cleaned and cataloged. A report on the investigations at Albeni
Falls was completed and one on the test digging at The Dalles was
practically finished by the end of the year. A collection of specimens
from a previous year’s digging in the McNary Reservoir was packed
and shipped to Washington.

Four articles pertaining to the results of previous work in the
Columbia Basin were published in American Antiquity, volume 17,
No. 4, April 1952. They were: “The 1950 Excavations at Site 45BN6
McNary Reservoir, Wash.,” by Joel L. Shiner; “Material Culture of
an Upper Coulee Rock-shelter,” by John E. Mills and Carolyn
Osborne; “Archeological Investigations in the Chief Joseph Reser-
voir,” by Douglas Osborne, Robert Crabtree, and Alan Bryan; and
“Archeological Investigations in O’Sullivan Reservoir, Grant County,
Wash.,” by Richard D. Daugherty.

Mr. Shiner’s affiliation with the River Basin Surveys terminated on
June 30 by transfer to the National Park Service. The River Basin
Surveys office at Eugene was to be kept open, however, by the National
Park Service, and Mr. Shiner was to be permitted to complete his
reports on the work he did for the Smithsonian Institution. The
River Basin Surveys will have no further operations in that area.

Georgia.—As in the case of the Columbia Basin, field work in the
Georgia area was handicapped by the delay in obtaining funds and
the limited amount of money available for the project. During the
period from August 18 until the end of October an emergency co-
operative excavation project, as described in an earlier section of
this report, was carried on at the Lake Springs site on the Savannah
River just above the Clark Hill Dam. A large sample of archaic
material representing a prepottery horizon called the Savannah River
Focus of the Stalling’s Island Culture was obtained there together
with a small series of contemporary crania showing a population of
both round- and long-headed individuals. The most important dis-
covery at the site, however, was a new early culture deep below the
archaic levels. This new manifestation, which has been designated
the Old Quartz Culture, showed an artifact assemblage similar to
those which had been found at a large number of open stations in
Piedmont Georgia and South Carolina. They have been regarded
as probably early but could not be so proven until the discovery of
the stratigraphy at Lake Springs. Unfortunately, the rising waters
of the Clark Hill Reservoir flooded the excavation pits before as
much work had been done as was desired, but the results obtained
are a definite contribution to the archeology of the region.

In late January and February test excavations were carried on in
the remains of Fort Charlotte at the upper end of the Clark Hill
Reservoir in South Carolina. Although located in the latter State

SECRETARY’S REPORT 67

the investigations were considered as part of the over-all Georgia
project. The outline of the fort was traced and a few minor arti-
facts were recovered. The fort had been a masonry structure erected
in 1765 as a defense against the Creek and Cherokee Indians who were
prone to raid the Scotch-Irish, French Huguenot, and German settle-
ments in the Long Canes region of upper Carolina. Its seizure by
patriot forces in 1775 was the first overt act of revolution in the
southern colonies. American possession of the fort throughout the
struggle was of considerable importance in holding the loyalties of
the inhabitants of upper Carolina during the troubled times that
followed. The recent excavations there give information about the
physical nature of the fort and its location which was not available
in documentary records. Underlying the occupation level of the
fort were Indian materials indicating that the location had also been
a place where the aborigines held forth. Pottery fragments suggest
that the Creeks were the tribe involved. There is no question but
what the Indian material is some years, possibly a good many, older
than the fort and that the site was deserted at the time it was chosen
for the location of Fort Charlotte.

There will be no further work in Georgia under the direction and
supervisions of the River Basin Surveys, unless there are further
changes in present plans. As indicated earlier in this report Mr. Cald-
well’s employment terminated on June 30 and he was transferred to
the National Park Service. He will be permitted, however, to com-
plete his technical reports on work done under the Smithsonian Insti-
tution and the manuscripts will be turned over to the River Basin
Surveys.

Missouri Basin—The Missouri Basin project as in previous years
continued to operate from the field headquarters at Lincoln, Nebr.
Paul L. Cooper served as director for the program in that area from
July 1 until February 28 when, in accordance with his request to
be relieved of administrative duties, Ralph D. Brown took charge.
Certain changes were made in the organization at that time and Mr.
Brown was designated as chief of the Missouri Basin project, the old
title of field director being dropped. Mr. Cooper remained with the
organization and was assigned to the position of consulting archeolo-
gist. The trend toward more excavation and less reconnaissance or
survey work, started the previous year, continued and increased in
fiscal 1952. This is attributable to the fact that much has been ac-
complished in the survey portion of the program and there is less
need for that kind of activity than in previous years. Furthermore,
the available funds were sufficient to provide for extensive excavations.
During the course of the year the staff was able to devote a greater
“proportion of its time to the study of data and specimens and in the
preparation of technical reports.
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

During the year archeological surveys were conducted in five new
reservoir areas of which three were in Wyoming, one was in Montana,
and one in Nebraska—South Dakota. Others where the preliminary
reconnaissance had not been completed were revisited and a total of
115 new sites was recorded. In the 1951 field season archeological
excavations were made in four reservoir areas by seven different units.
By the end of June 1952 there again were seven archeological excava-
tion parties working i in four reservoir areas, three of them the same
as in the previous year. Digging at the Keyhole Reservoir in Wyo-
ming was completed in 1951 and excavations in the Jamestown Reser-
voir in North Dakota were started in 1952. The other three are
Fort Randall and Oahe in South Dakota, and Garrision in North
Dakota. During the year there were paleontological investigations
in 12 reservoir areas. An archeological survey party was scheduled
to start for the field in late June but because of an emergency was
delayed and its departure rescheduled for the first week in July.

At the Fort Randall Reservoir in South Dakota the 1951 excava-
tions were at an Indian site and at a historic trading-post site. The
Indian site is of particular interest because it represents three occupa-
tional periods. One was a fortified earth-lodge village, one an unfor-
tified earth-lodge village, and the third an occupational area under-
lying both of the others. In the fortified area 7 earth lodges, a smaller
structure, 450 feet of stockade trench, 11 cache pits, and 22 refuse
areas were exposed and excavated. In the unfortified earth-lodge
area, one circular earth lodge, one cache pit, and four refuse pits were
unearthed. In May 1952 excavations were resumed in the unfortified
area and before the end of June had exposed 2 earth lodges, a refuse
midden, and 19 exterior pits. The date of the fortified village was
earlier and the occupational area beneath much older still. Comple-
tion of the work at that location will provide an excellent sequence
of materials leading up to the development of fortified villages in
that district.

The historic work in the Fort Randall Reservoir in 1951 was at the
location of the Fort Lookout trading post. The occupational level
of the post was established. Charred beams used in construction,
sections of vertical posts still in place, and other architectural fea-
tures were uncovered, along with numerous specimens of trade goods.
Two Indian occupational levels antedating the establishment of the
trading post and the nearby fort were found beneath the ruins of
the post. They are of interest because they produced materials not
previously known in that part of South Dakota. In May 1952 historic
investigations were resumed, but they were at the site of the Whetstone
agency which was established for the Brule and Ogallala bands of
Sioux from the Fort Laramie region by a treaty drawn in April

SECRETARY’S REPORT 69

1868. By 1869 about 1,000 Indians were living there, and by 1870 the
number had increased to about 2,250. One year later the Indians
were moved to a new location but the agency buildings continued in
use through the later 1870’s as a steamboat landing for supplies to be
conveyed overland to Indian agencies in the interior. Little is known
about the physical characteristics of the agency or of the Indian
camp, and digging there should provide interesting data to augment
the documentary records. By the end of June floor areas had been
uncovered and cedar post butts in palisade trenches were exposed.
Work at that site is scheduled to continue until it is completed, which
probably will be at about the end of the current field season.

In the Oahe Reservoir area during the 1951 field season excavations
were carried on at two Indian sites. One of them is located just
below the dam in an area which will ultimately be destroyed by con-
struction activities, while the other is several miles upstream on the
west bank just below the point where the Cheyenne River empties into
the Missouri. At the first location, known as the Phillips Ranch site,
5 earth lodges and 47 cache pits were uncovered, 2 trenches were dug
across the fortification ditch which surrounded the village, and the
refuse-bearing overburden was stripped from approximately one-
eighth of the village area. During the previous year 5 lodges and
46 cache pits had been dug, so the total for the village was 10 houses
and 96 cache pits. A large collection of specimens was obtained there,
the most outstanding probably being a few small fragments of coiled
basketry. The latter is extremely rare in archeological sites in the
Plains area. The data obtained from the site provided the basis for
establishing a previously unrecognized cultural complex for the dis-
trict. It appears to date from the early part of the eighteenth cen-
tury and almost certainly represents the protohistoric Arikara
occupation of the area. Excavations at the Phillips Ranch site have
been completed.

The other site, known as the Cheyenne River village, was only par-
tially dug and will be completed at a later date. The work there
consisted of the excavation and mapping of four house sites (a fifth
was nearly finished when heavy storms flooded it so badly that it had
to be abandoned) and the digging of cache pits. Cultural materials
from house sites and cache pits were recovered in large quantities
and preliminary studies indicate that they will provide much new
information about the arts and industries of their makers.

The 1952 excavations in the Oahe Reservoir were started at new
sites. One of them, which had been partly destroyed by construction
activities, is on the east bank of the Missouri River opposite the
Phillips Ranch site, while the other, which represents a large village,
is located not far downstream from the Cheyenne River village.
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

Work had not progressed sufficiently at either location by the end of
the fiscal year to indicate what results might be expected.

At the Garrison Reservoir in North Dakota two excavating parties
spent the 1951 field season digging in Indian and historic sites. At
one Indian village location the remains of 8 circular houses, 4 sweat
lodges, 48 cache pits, and numerous other miscellaneous features were
uncovered. The artifact yield was good, including uncommon stea-
tite fragments from bowls made from that material. The bowls
probably reached the area by trade from the west. They may have
come up the Columbia and down the Missouri as that was a main
aboriginal trade route. During the 1950 field season at that location
five houses were excavated and the palisade and moat were traced.
The combined data for the two seasons give a satisfactory story of the
village and its material culture. The village was reputedly occupied in
the late eighteenth century by the Hidatsa Indians and is particularly
interesting because it presumably was the most northerly of the forti-
fied earth-lodge communities belonging to the period preceding the
replacement of aboriginal material culture by trade goods obtained
from the white man. The other site investigated had also been a
fortified village. Five houses and parts of a sixth were excavated
there, and a ceremonial structure 72 feet in diameter, a large village
gateway, and several other features were found. Cross sections were
taken of the surrounding defensive ditch. This site, believed to have
been occupied chiefly by the Arikara Indians, produced relatively
few artifacts but it throws valuable light on the architecture and
community plan of the period. In June 1952 an excavating party
proceeded to the Night Walker’s Butte to begin digging the remains
of one of the few known Indian villages located on top of a butte.

The historic-sites party spent the period from July 1 to October 7,
1951, in the excavation of Fort Stevenson, a mile above the Garrison
Reservoir dam site. The foundations of five of the more important
military buildings and of several minor ones were traced and a con-
siderable quantity of materials was obtained. Fort Stevenson was a
typical Missouri River frontier post and was built to keep the river
open for navigation and to protect the Fort Berthold Indians from the
Sioux. In addition the post served as one of the main points on the
overland mail route which ran from St. Paul to Montana. Although
the fort was started in 1867 and was completed late in 1868 and there
are considerable documentary data about it, useful new information
pertinent to the actual character of the post and certain Indian rela-
tionships was obtained during the course of the work. Before stop-
ping for the season the Fort Stevenson party made tests in a trading-
post site at the mouth of the White Earth River and obtained some
trade goods. The historic-sites party returned to the Garrison area
in June 1952 and began work at a site in the Fort Berthold district.

SECRETARY'S REPORT 71

From July 1 to September 25, 1951, six key sites were excavated in
the Keyhole Reservoir on the Belle Fourche River in Crook County,
Wyo. The excavated sites include one large protohistoric camp with
pottery remains, three prehistoric camp sites, and two stratified rock
shelters. The lowest levels in both rock shelters are manifestations
of a new early-man complex. The data indicate that the aboriginal
occupation of the Keyhole area may have started about 5,000 years ago.
Much more recent materials were found in the upper levels and in a
few cases there were potsherds from vessels of the so-called Woodland
types. The latter are significant because they extend considerably
westward the known range of that kind of Indian pottery. ‘The in-
vestigations at the Keyhole Reservoir have been completed.

The Jamestown Reservoir on the river of the same name in North
Dakota was listed for investigation for the first time since the start
of the program. A survey party was supposed to make a reconnais-
sance there in the fall of 1951 but because of bad weather was unable
to do so. As a consequence a combined survey and excavating party
went there in May 1952. After 3 weeks’ preliminary examination of
the area and 18 sites had been located, excavations were started in a
mound 75 feet in diameter and 10 feet in height located on a bluff,
and in some house remains on the bottom lands. The mounds in that
portion of North Dakota show considerable similarity to those in
northern Minnesota and southern Manitoba and all probably belong
to the same cultural complex. The actual people involved have not
been identified as yet, and as little is known about the character of
the remains the results of the investigations there should add mate-
rially to knowledge about the Indians. The work there had not
progressed sufficiently by June 30 to permit a statement about the
findings.

During the 1951 field season the paleontological party visited and
collected in five reservoir areas, two in Montana, one in North Dakota,
and two in South Dakota. In exploring the Oligocene and Miocene
deposits in the Canyon Ferry Reservoir basin in Montana the party
added two genera of small mammals to the known fauna of the Oligo-
cene and six genera of those of the Miocene. While the sediments of
the Montana group of the the Upper Cretaceous were being studied
near the dam for the Oahe Reservoir, S. Dak., the first nearly complete
skeleton of one of the pygmy species of mosasaur, genus Clidastes,
ever obtained was found. The 1952 field season’s work started with
a preliminary reconnaissance of the Tuttle Creek and Lovewell Reser-
voir basins in the Kansas River drainage, Kansas, and was followed
by surveys of three reservoir areas in the Platte Drainage. They
were the Narrows in Colorado, and the Ashton and Trenton in
-Nebraska. Preliminary prospecting was also carried on at the Gavins
236639536
72 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

Point Reservoir on the Missouri River in Nebraska and South Dakota.
The first of June found the party at the Keyhole Reservoir in Wyo-
ming exploring Cretaceous sediments and the latest report is that
most of the skeleton of a small plesiosaur was found in the New-
castle member of the Granerose shale, the first record of vertebrate
remains from that formation. On June 25 the party moved to the
Canyon Ferry Reservoir in Montana and was just starting work there
at the end of the fiscal year.

During the course of the year seven preliminary appraisal reports
were completed, mimeographed, and distributed to the cooperating
agencies; four were completed and are ready for mimeographing;
and two supplements to previous reports were finished and are await-
ing mimeographing. Four short articles on specific subjects in Plains
archeology were prepared by members of the staff and published
in the Plains Archeological Conference News Letter. Two articles
were published in American Antiquity and one report appeared in
the Proceedings of the U. S. National Museum. One technical report
on excavations in the Oahe area was completed and the first drafts
of those on two others have been finished.

The laboratory at Lincoln processed 87,935 specimens from 170
sites in 18 reservoir areas and 2 sites not in reservoir areas. The
work in the laboratory also included: reflex copies of record sheets,
91,444; contact prints made, 8,826; negatives, 2,036; enlargements,
1,326; specimens drawn for illustrations, 872; color transparencies
cataloged, 321; drawings, tracings, maps made, 112.

Robert B. Cumming, Jr., archeologist, was in charge of the survey
and excavation of aboriginal archeological sites at the Fort Randall
Reservoir in South Dakota from July 1 to November 6 and from
May 19 to the end of the fiscal year. During the winter months at
the Lincoln headquarters Mr. Cumming worked on the technical re-
port on the Oldham site, the scene of most of his activities during the
1951 summer field season.

Paul L. Cooper, archeologist, served as field director for the Mis-
souri Basin activities during the period from July 1 to February 28.
On the latter date he became consulting archeologist for the project.
During the spring months Mr. Cooper devoted considerable time to
discussing the project with Mr. Brown, the new chief, and in con-
sultation with other members of the staff on archeological procedures
in the laboratory. He completed a report of progress for the period
from the beginning of the project in 1946 through April 1952 for
the Interior Missouri Basin Field Committee. He also worked on
a more detailed report covering the calendar years 1950 and 1951. He
met with the Interior Missouri Basin Field Committee at its April
session where he evaluated the progress made to that date by the

SECRETARY'S REPORT 73

River Basin Surveys of the Smithsonian Institution and took part in
a discussion of the future needs of the salvage program. Mr. Cooper
served as the chairman of the Ninth Conference for Plains Arche-
ology, which met at Lincoln in April. On June 6 he left Lincoln
for the Oahe Reservoir in South Dakota and at the end of the fiscal
year was directing a party excavating aboriginal sites along the Mis-
souri below the mouth of the Cheyenne River.

Franklin Fenenga, archeologist, was in charge of a reconnaissance
party from the beginning of the fiscal year until September when he
returned to the Lincoln office. During the field season his party
visited 15 proposed reservoir areas. Probably the most interesting
part of the season was that devoted to a boat trip down the Bighorn
River Canyon in Wyoming-Montana to examine the area of the pro-
posed Yellowtail Reservoir. On June 8 he went to the Oahe Reservoir
and started a series of excavations near the dam site a few miles above ‘
Pierre, S. Dak. Those activities were well under way by June 30.
During the months spent at the headquarters in Lincoln Mr. Fenenga
prepared preliminary appraisal reports for seven reservoir projects.
He presented two papers before the Ninth Conference for Plains
Archeology, and served as editor of the News Letter for that contfer-
ence. He was reelected to that office for the year 1952-53. He also read
a paper before the 62d annual meeting of the Nebraska Academy of
Sciences. During the 1952 meeting of the Academy he served as acting
chairman of the anthropological section and was elected its chairman
for 1953. Mr. Fenenga had two papers published during the year:
“The Archeology of Slick Rock Village, Tulare County, California,”
American Antiquity, volume 17, No. 4, April 1922, and “The Wabino,
a One-time Rival of the Midewiwin,” Proceedings of the Nebraska
Academy of Sciences, 62d Annual Meeting, 1952.

Donald D. Hartle, archeologist, was in charge of an excavating
party at the Rock Village site in the Garrison Reservoir area of North
Dakota from July 1 to August 20. From August 20 to October 27
he directed the excavations at the Star site in the same reservoir basin.
The latter part of October, in collaboration with James H. Howard of
the North Dakota State Historical Society, he recorded 12 Indian
songs, including several of those known as “Custer” songs. Two
Arikara Indians, Jonie Fox and Davis Paint, did the singing for
Hartle and Howard. From November 1 to June 1, Hartle spent his
time at the Lincoln headquarters studying his materials from the Rock
Village and preparing a technical report on the results of his investi-
gations. Further work was contemplated at Rock Village and the
manuscript could not be finished until that was done. Hartle left
Lincoln on June 2 with a party to continue his studies at Rock Village
_ and by the end of the month had completed the additional excavations.
74 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

Mr. Hartle presented a paper on the investigations at Rock Village
before the Ninth Conference for Plains Archeology at Lincoln in
April.

Donald J. Lehmer, archeologist, conducted excavations from July 1
to September 10 at the Phillips Ranch site in the Oahe Reservoir near
Pierre, S. Dak. Returning to Lincoln from South Dakota Mr.
Lehmer devoted the period to December 31, when his appointment
with the River Basin Surveys terminated, to completing a technical
report on the results of two seasons’ work in the Oahe area. This
report, consisting of 250 manuscript pages, presents in detail the infor-
mation obtained from the Dodd and Phillips Ranch sites. Publica-
tion of the report is planned for the next fiscal year. In addition Mr.
Lehmer completed two shorter articles which were published in
American Antiquity for April 1952. One was “The Fort Pierre
Branch, Central South Dakota.” The other was on an Oklahoma
project and is referred to in a later section of this report.

George Metcalf, field and laboratory assistant, worked with the
Hartle party in the Garrison Reservoir during July and August. In
addition to taking an active part in the excavations he made a series
of surveys in the area and located a number of new sites. In Septem-
ber he joined the Smith party in the investigations at Fort Stevenson
and in October participated in a reconnaissance of the region adjacent
to Fort Stevenson. During the winter months he checked the survey
records and prepared a supplemental report on the archeological
resources of the Garrison Reservoir. He assisted in the analysis of
artifacts from the Rock Village and collaborated in the preparation
of the section of a technical report dealing with trade materials and
pottery. In May Mr. Metcalf made a survey of the Big Sandy Reser-
voir in the Eden Valley, western Wyoming. In June, during an
emergency, he took charge of one of the parties in the Oahe area for a
9-week period. On June 30 he was en route to join the party under
G. H. Smith in the Garrison Reservoir, N. Dak.

Carl F. Miller, archeologist, transferred to the Missouri Basin for
the season, spent the latter part of July, August, and until September
13 digging in a historic site in the Fort Randall Reservoir near Cham-
berlain, S. Dak. When the excavations were completed Mr. Miller
proceeded to Lincoln where he spent two weeks completing field records
and other data. From Lincoln he returned to his base at the Washing-
ton office where he finished his report on the summer’s activities.

John E. Mills joined the staff of the Missouri Basin project as
an archeologist on April 10, 1952. During April and May he ex-
amined and studied all the records and artifacts pertaining to historic-
site research in the Fort Randall Reservoir area and in May made a
brief survey trip through the reservoir basin with National Park
Service representatives of Region Two to determine what historic

SECRETARY’S REPORT 75

sites merited excavation. In early June he started excavations at
the site of the Whetstone Agency and was continuing operations
there at the end of the fiscal year.

James M. Shippee, field and laboratory assistant, spent the early
part of July with the Wheeler party at the Keyhole Reservoir in
Wyoming. The last 2 weeks of the month he joined the Fenenga
party for the boat trip through the Bighorn Canyon. He returned
to the Keyhole area in August and remained with the Wheeler party
until it returned to Lincoln in September. During the fall and win-
ter months he was occupied with various duties at the field head-
quarters. In March he spoke before the Great Bend chapter of the
Missouri Archeological Society and in May read a paper at the annual
meeting of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences on salvage work at an
archeological site destroyed by flood prevention work near Kansas
City, Mo.

G. H. Smith, archeologist, spent the period from July 1 to October
1, 1951, excavating in the remains of Fort Stevenson. During that
period five of the more important building sites were completely or
largely excavated and there was some digging in a few lesser ones.
In October Mr. Smith, accompanied by George Metcalf, made a recon-
naissance in a previously unsurveyed part of the Garrison Reservoir.
Some test excavations were made at that time at the supposed site of
the fur-trading post of James Kipp. From October 28 to June 2, Mr.
Smith was at the Lincoln headquarters where he prepared a report on
the results of the Fort Stevenson investigations. The first draft was
completed and referred to the Chief for review. In May Mr. Smith
accompanied a party of National Park Service historians on a visit
to historic sites in the Gavins Point, Fort Randall, Oahe, and Garri-
son Reservoirs. In June he returned to the Garrison Reservoir and
started excavations at the supposed site of the original Fort Berthold,
and at Fort Atkinson, its successor, which is also known as Fort Ber-
thold II. By June 30 a section of the site of the latter had been
opened and considerable information was being obtained concerning
the post and Indian trade in general.

Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, curator of the division of archeology, U. S.
National Museum, was detailed to the River Basin Surveys for the field
season of 1951. He directed excavations at the Cheyenne River
village site in the Oahe Reservoir area from June 21 to September 14.
During the winter months at his regular station in Washington Dr.
Wedel worked on the materials and data from the site. As there is
considerable more digging to be done there, however, it will not be
possible to write the detailed technical report until that has been
accomplished. :

Richard Page Wheeler, archeologist, spent the period from the start
of the fiscal year through September 25 excavating at sites in the Key-
76 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

hole Reservoir area in Crook County, Wyo. Returning to Lincoln,
Wheeler spent the autumn and winter months analyzing field data
and preparing a number of reports. He published a paper, “A Note
on the ‘McKean Lanceolate Point’ ” in the Plains Archeological Con-
ference News Letter, volume 4, No. 4, based on materials from sites
in the Keyhole Reservoir area. He presented a report on the Keyhole
investigations before the Ninth Conference for Plains Archeology in
April. Before starting for the field in June he completed two manu-
scripts: “Excavations and Survey in the Boysen Reservoir Area, Cen-
tral Wyoming” and “Plains Ceramic Analysis: A check-list of Fea-
tures and Descriptive Terms.” From the middle of June until the
end of the year Mr. Wheeler was in charge of a survey and excavation
party at the Jamestown Reservoir in North Dakota.

Dr. Theodore E. White, geologist, spent the period from July 1
to 8 exploring the Oligocene and Miocene deposits in the Canyon
Ferry Reservoir area in Montana. From July 10 to 21 he was at the
Tiber Reservoir in the same State studying the Colorado group of the
Upper Cretaceous. From July 22 to August 13 he examined the ex-
posures of the Paleocene Fort Union formation on the south side of
the Missouri River in the Garrison Reservoir in North Dakota. The
period from August 15 to September 8 was spent exploring the sedi-
ments of the Montana group of the Upper Cretaceous near the dam in
the Oahe Reservoir area. He then moved on to the Fort Randall
Reservoir and spent September 8 to 16 in the area near the dam. That
completed Dr. White’s field investigations for the 1951 season. His
activities during the winter months have already been discussed in con-
nection with the section on the Washington office. From May 15 to 21,
1952, he made a preliminary survey of the Tuttle Creek and Lovewell
Reservoirs in the Kansas River drainage, the Narrows, Trenton and
Ashton Reservoirs in the Platte drainage, and Gavins Point on the
Missouri River. From June 2 to 25 Dr. White examined the Cre-
taceous sediments in the Keyhole Reservoir and then moved on to the
Canyon Ferry Reservoir for further explorations in that area.

Oklahoma.—No field work was done in Oklahoma during the last
fiscal year. The technical report on the excavations of the previous
year at the Tenkiller Ferry Reservoir on the Illinois River, 15 miles
south of Tahlequah, was completed by Donald J. Lehmer. The report,
“The Turkey Bluff Focus of the Fulton Aspect,” was published in
American Antiquity, volume 17, No. 4, April 1952. No further work
will be done in Oklahoma by the River Basin Surveys of the Smith-
sonian Institution since it falls within one of the areas where the
investigations will be under the direction and supervision of the
National Park Service after July 1, 1952.

Texas.—The River Basin Surveys in Texas continued to operate
from the headquarters at Austin. The office, which was closed tempo-

SECRETARY’S REPORT 71%

rarily at the beginning of the fiscal year because of lack of funds, was
reopened on September 10 and functioned until June 30, 1952. Edward
B. Jelks, acting field director, was in charge during that period.

Field work in Texas consisted of surveys and excavations. Prelimi-
nary surveys and appraisals were made at the Colorado City Reservoir
on the Colorado River in Borden and Scurry Counties, at the Oak
Creek Reservoir in the same drainage in Coke County, at the Paint
Creek Reservoir on the Clear Fork of the Brazos River in Haskell
County, and at the Cooper Reservoir on the South Sulphur River in
Delta County. A total of 62 sites was found. In the Colorado City,
Oak Creek, and Paint Creek areas none of them appeared to be of
sufficient importance to warrant further investigations. At the Cooper
Reservoir, however, are a number of small mounds and several village
sites which give surface evidence of occupation by two cultural phases.
Six of the sites have been recommended for excavation.

Excavations were carried on in three sites at the Belton Reservoir
on the Leon River in Coryell County. Some work had been done there
in a previous year, but the current digging added much new informa-
tion. Artifacts from the Caddoan area to the east were found in asso-
ciation with material from the Central Texas and Edwards Plateau
cultural aspects. Analysis of the specimens makes it possible, by
cross-dating, to place the Central Texas aspect in its proper place in
the relative chronology for Texas.

In April, May, and June an excavating party investigated three
sites at the Texarkana Reservoir on the Sulphur River in Cass and
Bowie Counties. Adequate data were obtained to reconstruct the cul-
tural history of each. Twelve burials were found at one of the sites,
nine at another, and five at the third. The skeletal material will pro-
vide good information on the physical characteristics and possible
relationships of the people. When all the data from the excavations
have been studied and the report is completed a gap in the knowledge
of that Texas-Arkansas area will be filled. The results should have
an important bearing on the problem of Caddoan influences in the
eastern Texas region.

Four survey reports were completed for mimeographing during the
year. <A technical report, “Archeological Excavations at the Belton
Reservoir, Coryell County, Texas,” by Edward B. Jelks and E. O.
Miller, has been completed and will be published this fall in the
Bulletin of the Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society. A
general paper, “The River Basin Surveys Archeological Salvage Pro-
gram in Texas,” was prepared by Edward B. Jelks for the Texas
Journal of Science. One technical report, completed the previous
year, “The Hogge Bridge Site and the Wylie Focus,” by Robert L.
‘Stephenson, was published in American Antiquity, volume 17, No. 4,
April 1952.
78 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

The River Basin Surveys will do no further work in Texas since that
is one of the projects being taken over by the National Park Service
on July 1. Arrangements have been made, however, for the com-
pletion of the reports on the investigations made under the direction
and supervision of the River Basin Surveys and when the manuscripts
are received they will be published in accordance with previous plans.

Virginia.—All the work in Virginia during the past year was con-
cerned with the John H. Kerr Reservoir (formerly called Buggs
Island) on the Roanoke River. During the period from May 19 to
June 30, 1952, test excavations were made in seven sites. One had been
partially dug the previous year but a stratigraphic test as a counter-
check against the earlier results was deemed advisable. Data ob-
tained during the current activities augment those from other seasons,
filling in certain gaps and clarifying some obscure features. From
all the information now available a complete sequence of cultural de-
velopments from a relatively early prepottery stage to the late pre-
Colonial period can be described. No further work will be possible
at the John H. Kerr Reservoir as the gates of the dam will be closed
in July and the various sites will soon be flooded.

Sections of the technical report pertaining to sites that were exca-
vated in previous years have been completed. The writing of the
report on the current investigations and the summary and conclusions
should be completed before the end of the present calendar year.

Future work in Virginia depends upon the program of the Corps of
Engineers. There are proposed projects for the James and Shenan-
doah Valleys and when they are authorized investigations will be
needed in both. Indications are that two small reservoirs in the upper
James drainage may be started within the next year or two.

Cooperating institutions.—Various State and local institutions co-
operated with the River Basin Surveys as in previous years. The Uni-
versity of Washington and State College of Washington cooperated
in excavations in the Columbia Basin. Space for field offices and
laboratories for units of the surveys was provided by the Universities
of Nebraska, Oregon, Texas, and Georgia.

The program developed by the National Park Service whereby
various scientific agencies carried on salvage operations on the basis
of agreements between those agencies and the Service was continued
throughout the year. In some cases the agreements were signed in
the preceding year and in others the work provided for did not start
until after the close of the fiscal year. However, during fiscal 1952
such agreements were in force with the University of California, Uni-
versity of Washington, University of Oregon, State College of Wash-
ington, Montana State University, University of Missouri, University
of South Dakota, Nebraska State Historical Society, University of
Kansas, University of Wyoming, State Historical Society of North

INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY
(Report prepared by Grorcre M. Fosrrr)

During the period under review one phase in the history of the In-
stitute of Social Anthropology drew to a close, and a new one began.
The Department of State informed the Smithsonian Institution on
September 28, 1951, that it would terminate its support on December
31, 1951. Following the abolition of the Inter-Departmental Com-
mittee on Scientific and Cultural Cooperation in 1949, under whose
auspices the Institute of Social Anthropology was established and its
work carried out, the Institute was placed under the Division of Inter-
national Exchange of Persons. Since the Institute did not form an
organic part of this program, the Department of State’s decision to
terminate support was not entirely unforeseen. During the period
July 1-December 31, 1951, operations were financed with a grant of
$42,000 from Public Law 402.

For some time there had been a growing feeling on the part of the
Institute personnel that the general factual knowledge it had accumu-
lated since 1944 should be put to some practical use. Therefore, in
the spring of 1951 anthropological analyses of health centers sponsored
by the Institute of Inter-American Affairs and the Ministries of
Health in México, Colombia, Pert, and Brazil were carried out. The
results of this investigation were made available in mimeographed
form in July in a paper entitled “A Cross-Cultural Anthropological
Analysis of a Technical Aid Program,” which demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the ITAA that the anthropological knowledge and tech-
nical methods used by anthropologists would be useful in carrying
out United States Government technical aid programs in Latin
America. Accordingly, in a letter dated September 28, 1951, Dr.
Henry G. Bennett, Administrator, Technical Cooperation Administra-
tion, asked the Institute of Social Anthropology to integrate its activ-
ities with those of the ITAA, effective January 1, 1952. In response
to this request the ITAA made a grant of $45,705 to enable the ISA
to continue its activities in all four countries, with the understanding
that Smithsonian anthropologists would be available for program
analyses of technical aid projects.

Individual activities of staff members are described in the separate
country sections. The largest single enterprise consisted of participa-
tion in a general survey of ILAA public-health programs in Latin
America. During the spring of 1952 the ITAA decided to utilize
80 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

anthropologists on a permanent basis and requested that plans be
made to incorporate ISA personnel directly into that organization.
This, of course, signaled the termination of ISA activities as such.
Accordingly, the Department of State was requested to notify the
Ministers of Foreign Relations of the cooperating countries that the
United States would make use of the escape clauses in its memorandum
agreements, bringing to a close as of June 30 the agreements that have
governed ISA operations during past years. Late in June 1952, the
IIAA asked to extend its grant to the Smithsonian Institution for
an additional 3 months, to give time for an orderly transfer of person-
nel. An additional $15,725 was included in the amended grant, which
was to terminate September 30, 1952.

Operations during the period July 1, 1951, to June 30, 1952, were
as follows:

Washington.—Dr. George M. Foster continued as Director of the In-
stitute. In September he concluded arrangements with the United
States Public Health Service and the ITAA whereby certain Institute
of Social Anthropology staff members, as indicated below, would be
detailed for varying periods to participate in health-program analyses.
He spent most of October in El Salvador as a member of the team that
was initiating this work, and gathered data from a country little
known anthropologically. During January and February 1952, he
visited field personnel in Brazil, Peri, Colombia, and México and
participated in the health survey in Chile. In May he went to Geneva,
Switzerland, as an adviser on cultural problems to the American
Delegation to the Fifth Assembly of the World Health Organization.
In June he undertook the editorship of the full USPHS-IIAA report
on the Latin-American health survey.

Early in October the Smithsonian Institution brought Dr. Julio
Caro Baroja, director of the Museo del Pueblo Espafiol in Madrid,
to Washington for a 3 months’ stay. During this period he and Dr.
Foster were engaged in the preliminary steps of writing a major mono-
graph on Spanish ethnography, designed to make available Hispanic
background data to make more intelligible the modern cultures of
Hispanic America. Dr. Caro’s passage was taken care of by the
Smithsonian Institution; his stay in the United States was made
possible by a grant from the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthro-
pological Research.

Miss Lois Northcott, administrative assistant to the Director since
1947, resigned to take a position with the Technical Cooperation Ad-
ministration in Egypt, and her place was taken by Mrs. Virginia
Clark, formerly with the Bureau of American Ethnology.

Brazil—Both Dr. Donald Pierson and Dr. Kalervo Oberg contin-
ued their teaching activities at the Escola de Sociologia e Politica in
Sio Paulo. Dr. Pierson, as in former years, served as dean of grad-

SECRETARY'S REPORT 81

uate work, as co-editor of the quarterly Sociologia, and as editor of
the book series Biblioteca de Ciencias Sociais. In addition, he was
occupied in developing long-range plans for an elaborate cultural
research program in the Sao Francisco Valley. The sum of 500,000
cruzeiros was made available to the Escola by the Brazilian Govern-
ment to carry out this work, and Dr. Pierson was asked to plan and
direct the research. In the spring of 1952 he made several short trips
to this area to organize field teams and initiate work. ‘The services of
Dr. Oberg were requested by the ILAA for analyses of some of their
health and health-education programs in Chonin, Minas Gerais, dur-
ing the months of July and August 1951. After concluding formal
teaching obligations in December he again returned to Chonin, re-
maining until April 1952. His assignment in Sao Paulo being con-
cluded, Dr. Oberg was brought to Washington in June, preparatory
to reassignment to Rio de Janeiro by the ITAA. Dr. Pierson elected
not to transfer to the ITAA, and on June 30, 1952, his connection
with the ISA was severed.

Colombia.—Charles Erasmus continued his collaboration with the
Colombian Government’s Instituto Etnolégico in Bogoté. In August
he initiated a community analysis of the mestizo village of Tota in
the Province of Boyacé. In this work he was aided by Dr. Silva
Celis, director of the anthropological museum in Sogamosa, and Sr.
Silvio Yepes, member of the staff of the Instituto Etnologico. In
November he was detailed to the United States Public Health Service
and sent to Ecuador where he remained until January 1952. In this
capacity he participated with the health survey group which at that
time was working in Ecuador. He was detailed to the ITAA in May
1952, and sent to Haiti for 6 weeks to participate, with a team of
experts, in surveying the Artibonite Valley for planning of agricul-
tural programs.

M éxico—Dr. Isabel Kelly taught two courses during the fall semes-
ter at the Escuela Nacional de Antropologia, in Mexico City. During
October she made a brief visit to El Salvador to consult with the
director of the Institute regarding analyses of ITAA projects (see
Washington), and to make comparative observations in that country.
In November she initiated additional research on health problems in
the Federal District, in which work she was assisted by students from
the Escuela Nacional. This research continued until March 1952.
In May and June of that year Dr. Kelly carried out research in ap-
plied anthropology in the village of Cadereyta, Querétaro, where the
ITAA desired information on the sociological effects of a new water-
supply system.

Dr. William Wonderly continued teaching activities through Au-
gust, at which time he asked to be placed on leave status for the re-
mainder of the year. In December the decision was made not to
82 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

continue linguistic training asa part of the Institute of Social Anthro-
pology program, and he left the staff to accept a position at the Uni-
versity of Oklahoma.

Both Drs. Kelly and Wonderly represented the Smithsonian Insti-
tution at the Mexican Government’s “Round Table” anthropological
conference in Jalapa, Veracruz, in August.

Pert.—Ozzie Simmons continued his teaching activities at the In-
stituto de Estudios Etnolégicos in Lima, and continued to direct
research in the mestizo village of Lunahuana in the Canete Valley
south of Lima. In December Mr. Simmons was detailed to the United
States Public Health Service and sent to Chile to participate in the
evaluation of ITAA health projects in that country. This work con-
tinued until late January 1952. Mr. Simmons was brought to Wash-
ington in April 1952, following which he took leave to defend his
dissertation at Harvard University, where he was awarded his doc-
torate. He returned to Lima in May to conclude his study in the
Lunahuan4 Valley.

ARCHIVES

Miss Mae W. Tucker, archivist for the Bureau of American Eth-
nology, retired at the end of February 1952 after nearly 27 years’
service with the Institution.

Notable additions to the collections during the fiscal year were the
diaries of John K. Hillers, who accompanied Maj. J. W. Powell on
his famous voyage through the Grand Canyon of the Colorado in
1871 and 1872. Mr. Hillers, who became photographer for the ex-
pedition, kept a full daily record of the expedition, which constitutes
a most valuable addition to our knowledge of this famous adventure.
The diaries were presented to the Bureau by Mrs. J. K. Hillers of
Washington, D. C., daughter-in-law of the author.

Mrs. Alice Norvell Hunt, of Washington, D. C., presented to the
Bureau an interesting collection of early photographs of western In-
dians collected by her father while an army officer in the West and
Southwest. Comprising photographs made by Baker and Johnston;
Addison of Fort Sill, Oklahoma Territory; O. S. Goff, Dickinson,
N. Dak.; A. S. Goff, Fort Custer, Mont.; Chr. Barthelmess, Fort
Keogh, Mont.; and Chase Thorne, El Paso, the 46 prints, including
a number of famous Indians, are all new to the collections.

William H. Myer, of Washington, D. C., and Mrs. Annie Lee
Myer Turner, of Carthage, Tenn., presented a book containing 75
drawings by Indians of the Southern Plains. The book was acquired
about the year 1880 by Capt. David N. McDonald and was later
purchased by W. E. Myer, father of the donors.

Mrs. J. C. Cardell, of Lenoir, N. C., presented a Mohawk dictionary
of 973 pages with French equivalents. It is in the dialect spoken at
Lake of Two Mountains, Caughnawaga and St. Regis in the Province
of Quebec, Canada, and is the work of Rev. J. A. Cuoc. It was
obtained later by Jeremiah Curtain, father of the donor.

Henry Lookout, of Pawhuska, Okla., son of the late Fred Lookout,
last principal chief of the Osage Nation, sent to the Bureau on
indefinite loan a group of papers relating to the history of the Osage
Nation, passed down from father to son for generations. Among the

SECRETARY'S REPORT 85

documents is a treaty of peace between the United States, the Osage
Nations, and the Missouri and Arkansas Tribes, signed in 1815 at
Portage des Sioux in what is now St. Charles County, Mo. In addi-
tion to the many Indian seals and signatures, it carries the signatures
of William Clark, of Lewis and Clark expedition fame, Ninian
Edwards, governor of the Territory of Illinois, and Auguste Chouteau,
principal figure of the early fur trade in the West. Also included in
the material from Mr. Lookout is a Jefferson medal of 1801, made
for presentation to Indian leaders. These are extremely rare since
they were usually buried with their recipient.

Report on the International Exchange Service

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the International Exchange Service for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1952:

The Smithsonian Institution is the official United States agency
for the exchange with other nations of governmental, scientific, and
literary publications. The International Exchange Service, initiated
by the Smithsonian Institution in the early years of its existence for
the interchange of scientific publications between learned societies and
individuals in the United States and those of foreign countries, serves
as a means of developing and executing in part the broad and compre-
hensive objective, “the diffusion of knowledge.” It was later desig-
nated by the United States Government as the agency for the
transmission of official documents to selected depositories throughout
the world, and it continues to execute the exchanges pursuant to con-
ventions, treaties, and other international agreements.

Although the number of packages received for transmission during
the year decreased by 9,386 to the yearly total of 1,001,614, the total
weight of the packages increased by 36,854 pounds to the total of
825,627 pounds. The average weight of the individual package
increased to 13.18 ounces as compared to the 12.46-ounce average for
the fiscal year of 1951. The publications received from both the
foreign and domestic sources for shipment are classified as shown in
the following table:

SECRETARY’S REPORT 87

The packages of publications are forwarded to the exchange bu-
reaus of foreign countries by freight, or where shipment by such
means is impractical, to the addressees by direct mail. The number
of boxes shipped to the foreign exchange bureaus was 3,058, or 174
more than for the previous year. Of these boxes 867 were for de-
positories of full sets of United States Government documents, these
publications being furnished in exchange for the official publications
of foreign governments which are received for deposit in the Library
of Congress. The number of packages forwarded by mail and by
means other than freight was 205,666.

Transportation rates continue to increase and are primarily re-
sponsible for the 148,014 pounds of publications that remained un-
shipped at the end of the fiscal year.

No shipments are being made to either China or Rumania. Pub-
lications intended for addresses in Formosa and formerly sent through
the Chinese Exchange Bureau at Nanking are now forwarded by
direct mail.

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

The number of sets of United States official publications received
by the Exchange Service for transmission abroad in return for the
official publications sent by foreign governments for deposit in the
Library of Congress is now 104 (62 full and 42 partial sets), listed
below. Changes that occurred during the year are shown in the

APPENDIX 7

Report on the National Zoological Park

Sir: Transmitted herewith is a report on the operations of the
National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1952.

There were 590 accessions, comprising 1,575 individual animals,
added to the collection during the year by gifts, deposits, purchases,
exchanges, births, and hatchings. Among these were many rare
specimens never before shown in this Zoo. The addition of new kinds
of animals enhances the value of the collection, which is maintained
not only for exhibition, but for research and education, thus fostering
the Smithsonian’s established purpose of “the increase and diffusion
of knowledge.” Valuable opportunities for research are afforded
students of biology, particularly vertebrate zoology, as well as artists,
photographers, and writers. Only methods of study that do not
endanger the welfare of animals or the safety of the public are
permitted.

Services of the staff included answering in person or by phone, mail,
or telegraph questions regarding animals and their care and trans-
portation; furnishing to other zoos and other agencies, public and
private, information regarding structures for housing animals; co-
operating with other agencies of Federal, State, and municipal gov-
ernments in research work; and preparing articles for publication.

The stone restaurant building, which was constructed in the Park
in 1940, is leased at $23,052 a year. This money is deposited in the
general fund of the United States Treasury. The concessionaire
serves meals and light refreshments and sells souvenirs.

THE EXHIBITS

Animals for exhibition are acquired by gift, deposit, purchase, ex-
changes, births, and hatchings, and are removed by death, exchange,
or return of those on deposit. Although depositors are at liberty to
remove their specimens, many leave them permanently.

As in any colony of living things, there is a steady turn-over, and
so the exhibits are constantly changing. Thus, the inventory list
of specimens in the collection on June 30 of each year does not show
all the kinds of animals that were exhibited during the year; some-
times creatures of outstanding interest at the time they were shown
are no longer in the collection at the time the list is prepared.

94

SECRETARY’S REPORT 95

The United States National Museum is given first choice of all speci-
mens that die in the Zoo. If they are not desired for the Museum they
are then made available to other scientific institutions or scientific
workers. Thus the value of the specimen continues long after it is
dead.

Professional workers of the National Institutes of Health frequently
perform autopsies on animals for the information thus obtained that
might be of use in the study of human diseases. They frequently
diagnose causes of death and make suggestions for treatment of liv-
ing animals. In particular, acknowledgment is made for the excellent
assistance and advice given the Zoo from time to time by Dr. W. H.
HKyestone, of the National Cancer Institute, and by Miss Frances
Dobell, biclogist in his laboratory.

Zoos are constantly striving to take such good care of their animals
that they may live out their maximum life spans. Therefore when
fair success is attained and animals live in captivity longer than they
usually do or when they appear to have established outstanding
longevity records, it is gratifying. In the National Zoological Park
there are many animals that continue to thrive after relatively long
periods in captivity. A few of these are listed below. Though none
of them has established a maximum longevity record, all are note-
worthy.

Mammals.—A ringtail, or cacomistle (Bassariscus astutus), received
as an adult in August 1941, is still living and in good condition.

A digger pine pocket gopher (Z’homomys bottae mewa), received on
May 19, 1949, lived until June 27, 1952. Pocket gophers do not ordi-
narily survive so long in captivity.

Birds.—The bird that has been in the zoo collection the longest is
a Siberian crane (rus leucogeranus), which was received in 1906. It
is still thriving and appears to be in good condition.

A white-naped crane (Grus leucauchen) received in 1916 appears to
be in good health.

A wood ibis (Mycteria americana) and a lesser adjutant stork
(Leptoptilus javaniecus) were both received in 1928 and are still doing
well.

East African crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum gibbericeps)
received in 1926 and West African cranes (Balearica pavonina) re-
ceived in 1931 are thriving.

A single-wattled cassowary (Casuarius unappendiculatus), re-
ceived in 1928, and other cassowaries received in 1937 are still alive.

Small birds that are still thriving are white-cheeked bulbuls
(Pycnonotus leucogenys) and mourning finches (Phrygilus fruticetz)
received in 1940.

_ Reptiles—The oldest animal in the collection is a Galapagos turtle
(Testudo vicina), which was collected by the Lord Rothschild Expedi-
96 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

tion to the Galapagos Islands in 1898, the first scientific exploration
of these islands. Since its receipt it has continued to thrive and grow.

An African water turtle (Pelomedusa galeata), obtained in 1926
by the Smithsonian-Chrysler Expedition, is still alive.

Other reptiles with interesting records are: A soft-shelled turtle
(Amyda ferox) received in 1930; flat-headed turtles (Platemys platy-
cephala) received in 1931; two African crocodiles (Crocodylus niloti-
cus) received in 1929; four spectacled caimans (Caiman sclerops) re-
ceived in 1931; and a pike-head snake (Oxybelis acwminatus) received
in 1943.

Among the amphibians are Argentine horned frogs (Ceratophrys
ornata) received in 1939 and giant toads (Bufo marinus) received
in 1981.

Two South American lungfishes (Lepidosiren paradoxa), received
in 1931, are still living.

The most serious loss of the year from both a financial and senti-
mental standpoint was the death on June 30, 1952, of the African
elephant “Jumbina,” which had been with the Zoo since August 8,
1913. She was never the docile soul that endears some elephants to
children, but she was admired by many for her active, alert ways as
well as for her stature and remarkable form. When she was obtained
from the Government Zoological Garden at Giza, Egypt, she was 4
feet 3 inches high at the shoulders and weighted 875 pounds. An
arthritic-like condition apparently caused her decline.

ACCESSIONS

By extensive correspondence with persons in foreign lands the Zoo is
frequently able to acquire by gift, exchange, or purchase highly de-
sirable animals that are not ordinarily available through animal deal-
ers or other zoos.

OUTSTANDING ACQUISITIONS

The Commonwealth of Australia presented to the President of the
United States an albino kangaroo and a pair of the beautiful Crown
Prince Rudolph’s blue birds-of-paradise. ‘These are quartered in the
Zoo and are most interesting additions to the exhibits, as the kangaroo
is believed to be the only one of its kind in captivity, and the birds
are the first of this species that this Zoo has ever had.

In exchange with E. J. L. Hallstrom, president of the Taronga
Zoological Park Trust, Sydney, N. S. W., an outstanding collection
was received from Australia, consisting of gang-gang cockatoos (Cal-
locephalon fimbriatum), Barraband’s parakeets (Polytelis swainsont),
Leadbeater’s cockatoos (Kakatoe leadbeatert), bare-eyed cockatoos
(Kakatoe sanguineus), sulphur-crested cockatoos (akatoe galerita),
emus (Dromiceius novachollandiae), bowerbirds (Ptilonorhynchus

SECRETARY'S REPORT 97

violaceus), Cape Barren geese (Cereopsis novaehollandiae), black
swans (Chenopis atrata), 4 long-eared opossums (7'richosurus vul-
pecula), 6 phalangers (Petaurus norfolcensis), 2 wallabies (Wallabia
agilis) ,2 wallaroos (Macropus robustus), 2 red kangaroos (Macropus
rufus), 2 great gray kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), 7 White’s
skinks (Hgernia whitti), 4 carpet pythons (Python variegatus), 5
black snakes (Pseudechis porphyriacus), 2 green snakes (Dendrophis
punctulatus), and 4 tiger snakes (Spilotes pullatus pullatus). Other
specimens are stil] to be received inthisexchange. In return, a young
giraffe, 2 pygmy hippopotamuses, and 1 grizzly bear were sent to
Australia.

The United States Fish and Wildlife Service, through various mem-
bers of its staff, has continued to assist us in maintaining an interesting
collection during the year. A pair of MacQueen’s bustards (Chlamy-
dotis undulata macqueenii) was presented through Gardner Bump «and
the State of New Mexico. The first Ross’s snow geese (Chen rossi)
received since 1915 were sent by Vernon Ekedahl, superintendent of
the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, from Willows, Calif. He
also sent other North American waterfowl, which are enumerated in
the list of donors. Other members of the Fish and Wildlife Service
who assisted are given in the list of donors.

W. W. Dornin, of Phoenix, Ariz., continued from time to time
to send choice specimens of reptiles of the southwestern United States.

Valuable specimens were received during the year from J. D. Hand-
man, Nyasaland Railways Ltd., Monkey Bay, Nyasaland, Africa. As
this is a region little known zoologically, all the specimens are unusual
in collections. Outstanding among these was a file snake (Smoce-
phalus capensis).

The United States Army Medical Unit in Malaya, under the leader-
ship of Lt. Col. Robert Traub, again brought to the United States
particularly interesting animals that were made available to the Na-
tional Zoological Park after they had served their purpose with the
Medical Unit. Although the collection was not large, all the specimens
were very desirable. They included 2 baby orangutans (Pongo
pygmaeus abelii) ; 2 young small-toothed civets (Arctogalidia trivir-
gata); 4 ferret-badgers (Helictis everetti) ; 2 tree shrews (T'upaz
montana baluensis) ; 4 choice specimens of the big black rat of Mount
Kinabalu, North Borneo (Rattus infraluteus) ; 1 Bornean porcupine
(Trichys lipura) ; and 1 remarkable tiny spineless hedgehog (Hylo-
mys suillus dorsalis). On the long trip from Asia the animals were
cared for by Charles Wharton, a zoologist who had been with the
Medical Unit.

The Johns Hopkins Research Center deposited in the Zoo a group
of young chimpanzees that have proved to be a fascinating exhibit.
98 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

The National Institutes of Health, through Samuel Poiley, pre-
sented 13 minks and a number of ferrets.

Fourteen species of animals were received that had not previously
been exhibited in the National Zoological Park, and some of them
probably had not previously been on exhibition in the United States.

BIRTHS AND HATCHINGS

Animals that are kept on exhibition are usually not under conditions
that are most favorable for breeding and raising young. However,
occasionally young are born or hatched that are outstanding in their
interest. The following were produced in the Zoo during the fiscal
year:

it is gratifying to note that the pair of mole rats (Cryptomys
lugardi) from southeastern Africa raised two young that were born
106 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

last year. These are little-known burrowing creatures that somewhat
resemble the pocket gophers of South America but are dark lead color
with a large white blotch on the forehead. Their front teeth project
even more than in most rodents and are used in burrowing.

MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS

The work of rehabilitating the large-mammal house, which was
begun in the previous fiscal year, was completed December 10, 1951.

Contract was let for the installation of zone heat regulators in the
small-mammal and reptile houses. These should result in better con-
trol of the temperature than has heretofore been possible and should
effect enough of a saving in heat to more than pay for the
installation.

Every working day of the construction and maintenance depart-
ment involves not only the routine work of cleaning the buildings and
grounds, unstopping sewers and drains that have become clogged,
repairing leaky faucets, broken windows, cages, cage doors, cage locks,
and innumerable other small items, but also additional jobs of some-
what greater scope. The more important of these during the fiscal
year were:

1. Remodeled bear cage, between monkey house and lion house.

2. Dismantled four old wooden animal shelters and replaced them with new
brick-concrete shelters, in the line of cages above the reptile house.

3. Made extensive repairs to all outside cages attached to the bird house, and
painted them.

4. Remodeled nine cages in the finch room at the bird house in new design, with
plate glass covering upper half and electric-weld wire fabric covering lower half
of cages.

5. Applied bituminous concrete to areas between road curbing and sidewalks
along main roadway to prevent erosion, eliminate mud, and lessen danger of
visitors’ stumbling into trafiic.

6. Installed new electric water heaters in annex No. 1 and in the lion house.

7. Made general repairs to 100 wooden park benches.

8. Cast new concrete bench legs and arms and concrete picnic-table tops.

9. Repaired iron work and placed new where needed, and applied three coats
of paint on large outdoor eagle cage.

10. Dismantled old wooden shelters and replaced them with new brick-concrete
shelters in large outdoor flight cage.

11. Made general repairs to boilers in the central heating plant, conduit system,
and heating systems within the buildings. In the central heating plant this in-
volved replacement of all fire-box tubing in the three boilers; cleaning and paint-
ing the interior and exterior of the boilers; renewal of parts in the blow-off
valves ; replacement of baffle walls, grates, and side bars. All steam and electric
pumps and traps in the boiler room were overhauled, repaired and worn parts
replaced, and the interior of the boiler room was painted. Throughout the
heating system unserviceable steam lines were replaced. Worn parts in steam
traps were repaired and steam traps that were beyond repair were replaced with
new ones. Worn parts in the vacuum pumps were replaced where needed.

SECRETARY'S REPORT 107

The fight to eradicate poison ivy in the Zoo grounds is being con-
tinued. This pest has been almost completely eliminated in those parts
most frequented by the public, and control measures are being ex-
tended to more remote sections to keep it from spreading to areas
used by the public. Otherwise the long-established policy of leaving
the woodlands undisturbed is being followed.

Over a period of years there has been a gradual increase in the
amount of trimming of trees along the roads, walks, and paths, and in
the exhibition area. Because of their great age, some of the trees
are dying and must be cut down. Others must be trimmed to re-
move dead or broken limbs which might fall and injure people or
animals, or damage automobiles or structures within the grounds.

During the year a system was inaugurated of appointing tempo-
rary intermittent policemen to serve on Saturdays, Sundays, and holi-
days during the seasons of unusually heavy attendance or to relieve
regular men when necessary. This plan is proving highly satisfac-
tory, as it makes more men available for the few days of the year
when they are most urgently needed without maintaining a large
permanent force.

As in previous years the Zoo received gifts of various kinds of
foed that could not be sold for human consumption but was suitable
foranimals. This helps considerably to hold purchases to a minimum.
Among the many kinds of such foods were 37,000 pounds of frozen
skinned rabbits, frozen strawberries, frozen kale, and butter. Out-
standing aid in supplying such material was given by W. Bruce
Matthews, United States Marshal, who turned over food that was
condemned through the courts. A considerable assortment came
also from the Safeway Stores, Inc., which had suffered a fire at one
of its establishments. From other sources there came 21 bags of
English walnuts, 600 pounds of candy, 3,200 pounds of dog food, 25
cases of assorted baby food, 46 cases of egg noodles, 15 cases of maca-
roni, 100 cases of assorted dog and cat food, 450 pounds of turnips,
and some avocados. The General Services Administration donated
36 cases of prunes no longer suitable for human consumption. The
Fish and Wildlife Service sent the Zoo more than 200 four-week-old
chicks that had been used in certain experiments but were still suit-
able for animal food. The National Institutes of Health, Navy Med-
ical Center, and Army Medical Center gave mice, rats, guinea pigs,
rabbits, and other animals no longer suitable for their purposes.
The practice has been continued of picking up from grocery stores
in the vicinity of the Zoo quantities of discarded green material such
as cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, beet tops, and celery stalks. This
provides an abundance of greens for the animals and helps reduce
purchases of such foods.

VISITORS

The estimated number of visitors to the Zoo was 3,294,569, or
165,831 less than for the year 1951, a decrease due mainly to incle-
ment weather in the spring of 1952, particularly on week ends and
holidays, which deterred persons from the District of Columbia, Mary-
land, and Virginia from visiting the Zoo. There was little change,
however, in the record of automobile attendance and groups coming
by bus.

Groups came to the Zoo from schools in Canada and 32 States, some
as far away as Maine, Florida, Oklahoma, Kansas, and South Dakota.
This was an increase of 31 groups and 7,874 individuals in groups
over last year.

About 2 p.m. each day the cars then parked in the Zco are counted by
the Zoo police and listed according to the State, Territory, or country
from which they came. This is, of course, not a census of the cars
coming to the Zoo but is valuable in showing the percentage of attend-
ance, by States, of people in private automobiles. Many of the District
of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia cars come to the Zoo to bring

guests from other States. The tabulation for the fiscal year 1952 is as
follows:

The cars that made up the remaining 11.2 percent came from every
one of the remaining States, as well as from Africa, Alaska, Australia,
Austria, Canal Zone, Cuba, E] Salvador, England, Germany, Guam,
Guatemala, Hawaii, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Newfoundland, the
Philippines, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

On the days of small attendance there are cars parked in the Zoo
from at least 15 States, Territories, the District, and foreign countries.
On average days there are cars from about 22 States, Territories, the
District, and foreign countries; and during the periods of greatest
attendance the cars represent not less than 34 different regions.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

Replacement of antiquated structures that have long since ceased to
be suitable for the purposes for which they are used is still the prin-
cipal need of the Zoo. The more urgently needed buildings are: (1)
A new administration building to replace the 147-year-old historic
landmark now in use as an office building but which is neither suitably
located nor well adapted for the purpose; (2) a new building to house
antelopes and other medium-sized hoofed animals that require a
heated building; and (3) a fireproof service building for receiving
shipments of animals, quarantining animals, and caring for animals in
ill health or those that cannot be placed on exhibition.

It would be good economy in the long run to extend the steam
conduit from the large-mammal house to the bird house, at an esti-
mated cost of about $35,000. This would not only bring about a re-
duction in actual heating cost but would obviate boiler repairs and
replacements that may be necessary very soon, as two of the boilers
are 25 years old.

There is need for a veterinarian who can devote his entire time to
assisting the animal department in selecting suitable foods, presenting
foods to the animals in a satisfactory manner, practicing preventive
medicine, and making autopsies to determine causes of death. The
salary and operating cost for a veterinarian would be a good invest-
ment, for with professional care the lives of many animals in the Zoo
would undoubtedly be lengthened.
110 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

The steadily increasing popularity of the Zoo, as a source of both
entertainment and education, has developed such a volume of requests
for information that there is now need for an additional scientist to
share the load of answering queries and to assist in other administra-
tive work so that the Director and Assistant Director can devote more
time to general supervision of the Zoo and attention to visitors.

Report on the Astrophysical Observatory

Srr: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1952:

The work of the Astrophysical Observatory is divided between
two units: the division of astrophysical research, for the study of
solar radiation problems, and the division of radiation and organisms,
established “to undertake those investigations dealing with radiation
bearing directly or indirectly upon biological problems.” In addi-
tion to their regular programs, both divisions are conducting coopera-
tive projects with other Government agencies. The division of astro-
physical research at its Chilean field station maintains certain seismo-
graphic records for the Coast and Geodetic Survey and also records
solar radiation received upon exposed fabrics, under contract with the
Office of the Quartermaster General. The division of radiation and
organisms has in progress special experiments for the Atomic Energy
Commission and for the Biological Department, Chemical Corps,
Camp Detrick, Md.

During the year the metal and glasswork shops serving both divi-
sions of the Observatory were materially improved by the installation
of modern lighting equipment, re-arrangement of the machines, re-
painting, reflooring, and the addition of specially built cabinets for
storing raw materials. The instrument makers now operate with
less eye strain, more convenience, and greater safety.

In August 1951 the Director of the Observatory attended meetings
of the Sub-Commission on Actinometry of the World Meteorological
Organization held at Brussels, Belgium. In the resolutions adopted
by the Sub-Commission, the Smithsonian silver-disk pyrheliometer,
designed and developed by Dr. C. G. Abbot, is recommended as an
instrument for the measurement of direct solar radiation.

DIVISION OF ASTROPHYSICAL RESEARCH

The question of establishing a field station in the Clark Mountain
(Calif.) region, mentioned in previous reports, is still undetermined.

W. H. Hoover, chief of the division, spent July and part of August
at the Table Mountain (Calif.) field station, directing the work pro-
gram and testing several new devices.

SECRETARY'S REPORT 131

The ninth revised edition of the Smithsonian Physical Tables is in
press. At the end of the fiscal year, Dr. Forsythe, who prepared the
manuscript, had corrected approximately one-third of the galley
proof.

Work in Washington.—The checking and appraisal of observations
of sun and sky radiation made at two high-altitude field stations,
Montezuma (Chile) and Table Mountain (Calif.), have continued
under the direction of Mr. Hoover. Some progress has been made in
the preparation of material for a new volume of the Annals of the
Astrophysical Observatory.

Incident to the review of results during the past decade, an exam-
ination was made to determine what, if any, relationship is apparent
between the solar-constant record and the number of sunspots. During
the last maximum of sunspots in 1947, the total number of spots was
greater than during any maximum since 1778. In 1947 the number
averaged 151.6. In 1778 it was 154.4. The next greatest maximum,
139.1, occurred in 1870. A curve is here presented showing monthly
mean values of the solar-constant compared with monthly means of
sunspot numbers for the same days. It includes all solar constants
graded fair or better during the 11-year period 1940 to 1951. A fairly
regular increase in solar constants is apparent with increasing sunspot
numbers.

(The number near each point
indicates the number of monthly
means included in each group.)

132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

Orders for silver-disk pyrheliometers, built in our shops and cali-
brated against the Smithsonian standard pyrheliometer, have con-
tinued to come in. During the year five instruments were prepared
and sold at cost, as follows:

S. I. No. 84 to Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris, France.
S. I. No. 87 to Helsinki, Finland.

S. I. No. 88 to Institute for Scientific Research, Central Africa.

S. I. No. 89 to National Observatory of Athens, Greece.

S. I. No. 90 to University of Rhode Island.

As of now, a total of 89 silver-disk pyrheliometers have been fur-
nished by the Astrophysical Observatory to interested observatories
and institutions in many lands, thus making available throughout the
world the Smithsonian standard scale of radiation. In addition, five
Angstrom compensation pyrheliometers, modified in certain details as
experience has dictated, were built and calibrated. ‘Three were sold
at cost to the Belgium Consulate General for use in the Belgian Congo.

During the year certain electronic devices were procured as funds
permitted. These include a photopen recorder, Golay detector, and
electron multiplier photometer. Tests are in progress to determine
their most advantageous application to our special needs.

For five years, 1926 to 1931, the Astrophysical Observatory occupied
Mount Brukkaros in Southwest Africa as a field observing station.
At the request of the Meteorological Service of South Africa, the
Smithsonian observations of total solar radiation during this period
on Mount Brukkaros were summarized and made available for publica-
tion in a new compendium of South African solar-radiation data.

The Smithsonian standard water-flow pyrheliometer, against which
substandard comparisons were last made on Mount Wilson (Calif.) in
1947 by Dr. Abbot and Mr. Aldrich, has been overhauled and tested
by Mr. Hoover. It is planned to mount this standard instrument
at Table Mountain in the near future for a new series of comparisons
against our silver-disk substandards.

An important study by Mr. Hoover is in progress, designed to clear
up certain elusive characteristics of the silver-disk pyrheliometer,
such as the cause of the temperature correction which it is found
necessary to apply.

A special pyranometer was prepared for future testing at Table
Mountain. Its vestibule permits the rapid insertion of four suc-
cessive filters, transmitting different wavelength bands. Such a device
should indicate variations in haze more certainly than does the
pyranometer without filters as ordinarily used. It is hoped that this
filter pyranometer may prove an important aid in determining atmos-
pheric transmission values required in short-method solar-constant
observations.

SECRETARY’S REPORT 133

At the request of the United States Weather Bureau, another special
pyranometer was prepared and calibrated for use in standardizing the
Weather Bureau’s network of Eppley pyrheliometers. A leveling
device and automatic shutter control were added to the pyranometer.

Last year’s report mentioned a cooperative arrangement with the
Meteorological Division, Chemical Corps, Camp Detrick, Md., to de-
velop a new improved type of melikeron, for the measurement of out-
going radiation from the earth to space. One of these instruments
has been completed and tested at Camp Detrick. A paper describing
this development was read by Dr. S. C. Stern of Camp Detrick at the
July meeting of the American Meteorological Society.

Dr. C. G. Abbot, research associate, has continued his studies of
relationships between solar and terrestrial phenomena. His results
are described in several papers in volume 117 of the Smithsonian
Miscellaneous Collections.

Work in the field.—In May 1952 a new series of tape exposures was
started at the Montezuma station, under contract with the Office of
the Quartermaster General. These exposures are a continuation of
the Quartermaster studies to determine the causes of the deterioration
of tentage materials. The tapes include samples of various textiles,
and the exposures and radiation measurements are similar to those
described in former years.

At the Table Mountain station, the interesting study discussed in
last year’s report, to determine the quantity of ozone in the upper
atmosphere from our daily bolographic records, continued under the
direction of Dr. Oliver R. Wulf, of the U. S. Weather Bureau and
the California Institute of Technology. Dr. Wulf has improved the
means for obtaining absolute values of the ozone from long-method
days. He then uses the long-method results to calibrate the relative
values obtained from the short-method observations at air mass 2.5.

In July 1951 Mr. Hoover tested the double spectroscope set up in
the new tunnel at Table Mountain. He reports that, unfortunately,
the device is not sufficiently rigid to give satisfactory results. Con-
siderable alteration will be necessary. Mr. Hoover also prepared and
installed a very satisfactory device for recording the steadiness of
the sky during each bolograph. It consists of a sensitive thermo-
element mounted in the coelostat beam. The resulting galvanometer
deflection, recorded upon a rotating drum, is an index of the steadiness
of the sun and sky radiation during each bolograph. This record
has proved helpful in appraising pyrheliometer and pyranometer
readings at Table Mountain, where sudden changes in water vapor
content and quality of haze occur fairly frequently.

DIVISION OF RADIATION AND ORGANISMS
(Report prepared by R. B. WitrHROWw)

In last year’s report the developmental responses of seedlings to
light were discussed as to the possible biochemical reactions involved
in the absorption of the light energy and the subsequent regulatory
mechanism responsible for the development of seedlings into normal
plants. The indications were that these growth or photomaturation
responses were not directly associated with either chlorophyll syn-
thesis or photosynthesis, but no strong photomaturation response had
been obtained without detectable traces of chlorophyll. The problem
remained, therefore, to secure leaf expansion and stem development
approaching the normal occurring in sunlight without chlorophyll
synthesis or photosynthesis.

During the past year bean seedlings were grown under a series of
seven irradiances respectively of blue (436 mp), red (630-700 mz), and
far red (710-1100 mp and 725-1100 mp) radiant energy. The extent
of the photomaturation response was measured by taking weights of
the leaves, and weights and lengths of the hypocotyl] and epicotyl por-
tions of the plants. Analysis for protochlorophyll, chlorophyll,
carotenoid, and anthocyanin pigments were made in order to obtain
a picture of the photosynthesis and photodecomposition of these pig-
ments.

The maximum photomaturation response occurred in the red where
the maximum chlorophyll synthesis and anthocyanin synthesis also
occurred. With blue of the same energy as the red, the leaf expansion
and decrease in hypocotyl length were much reduced. Although the
amount of chlorophyll was less in the blue than the red, it was not
decreased in proportion to the decrease in photomaturation response.
In the far red, very marked photomaturation occurred at the lower
irradiances employed without any measurable synthesis of chloro-
phyll, which first appeared with this region at 10? microwatts per
square centimeter. Since all measurements were made with 10-cm.
cells in a Beckman spectrophotometer, it is safe to assume that prac-
tically no chlorophyll was synthesized under these low-irradiance far-
red conditions. Therefore, the evidence is conclusive that the photo-
maturation responses are not directly concerned either with chloro-
phyll synthesis or photosynthesis, but are due to a regulatory mech-
anism associated with a pigment having absorption in the far red.
Absorption of this pigment also occurs in the blue, with the maximum
in the red.

In addition, there is clear evidence that the synthesis of anthocyanin
is also a photochemical response, separate and distinct from photo-
synthesis. Anthocyanin was always present in plants grown in com-
plete darkness, but very marked increases occurred with the addition

SECRETARY'S REPORT 135

of all wavebands employed. Anthocyanin synthesis was maximal in
the red, which was from ten to one hundred times as efficient as the
blue. At 10° microwatts per square centimeter, the anthocyanin
content of plants grown with the red was doubled as compared to
that of those in complete darkness. In the far red, where no photo-
synthesis could have occurred because of the absence of chlorophyll,
the anthocyanin increased eighteen times with the 710-1100 my region
and ten with the 725-1100 my region at the 10-microwatt energy level.
This appears to be strong evidence that, contrary to previous theories,
the light effect on anthocyanin synthesis is only indirectly related
to photosynthesis and that anthocyanin synthesis can be the conse-
quence of an independent photochemical reaction.

A second phase of the research has been concerned with the effect
of growth regulators on the uptake of various nutrient salts by bean
seedlings. It was reported previously that the nitrates, chlorides,
and sulfates of potassium, calcium, and magnesium were absorbed
less rapidly by plants treated with 10 y of ammonium 2,4-D on the
leaf or bud than by untreated plants. The reduction in uptake occurs
within 24 to 48 hours after the application of the growth regulator as
measured by a continuously recording electronic conductance bridge.
These reduced uptake patterns appear to be chiefly related to decreased
growth of the plants treated with the growth regulator. Unlike the
other nutrient salts tested potassium acid phosphate, while eventually
absorbed less rapidly when 2,4—D is used, is taken up by the treated
plants at an increased rate for a short period beginning about 6 hours
from the time of application of the regulator. Other work has indi-
cated that about 6 hours is approximately the length of time required
for the ammonium 2,4-D to reach the roots of bean seedlings. This
increased rate of absorption has not as yet been correlated with any
change in metabolism of the seedling.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 9

Report on the National Air Museum

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the National Air Museum for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1952:

GENERAL STATEMENT OF CONDITIONS

The phase of Museum operations that caused the greatest con-
cern and required most concentration of effort throughout the year
was the care of the storage collection at Park Ridge, Ill. It will be
recalled from previous annual reports that the former Douglas DC-+4
Transport Airplane Plant there was the collecting depot for signifi-
cant and historic aircraft selected for preservation by General of
the Air Force H. H. Arnold. When these were turned over to the
National Air Museum in 1949, it was believed most economical to
leave them there until an adequate building could be provided in the
Washington, D. C., area for the entire collection. An efficient or-
ganization was brought together by the Museum to preserve and guard
these stored aircraft. Meanwhile that locality became designated
as O’Hare Field, Chicago International Airport, and several United
States Air Force units were established there, the Museum paying
rent to the Air Force for the space it occupied in Building T-6. To
that storage facility the Museum brought other aircraft and mate-
rials that could not be exhibited or cared for on the Washington prem-
ises in the Smithsonian buildings. It was believed that this facility
would continue to operate until Congress gave further consideration
to the report presented to that body by the Smithsonian, in re-
sponse to the section in the Act of Establishment which authorized
the planning of an adequate building.

With the advent of war in Korea it became evident that Govern-
ment resources must be concentrated upon the production of combat
aircraft instead of applied to the care of historic ones, and early in
the fiscal year the international situation reacted directly upon the
Air Museum when, on July 12, 1951, an eviction notice was served
by the Air Force requiring removal of all Museum stored material
from the premises in Building T-6. Because of the national emer-
gency the needs of the Air Force required expanded manufacturing
facilities for aircraft and it had been decided to reactivate Building

136

SECRETARY’S REPORT te?

T-6 for aircraft production. While efforts were being made by the
Museum to obtain use of premises in the northwest corner of the air-
port, it was learned that temporary housing for part of the storage
collection could be provided in Building T-7, an adjacent hangarlike
structure where Bays 5 and 6 totaling 60,000 square feet could be rented
to the Museum. With winter approaching, this move to 'T-7 was
better than undertaking the project of rehabilitating the quarters in
the northwest corner of the airport, but because the space in T-7
would provide less than half of the area required it was necessary to
place the remainder outdoors between Buildings T-6 and i-7. The
problem of protection was partly met by choosing those specimens that
could best withstand exposure, covering them with protective coat-
ings and surrounding the area with a fence, so arranged that the
largest boxes provided windbreaks for the aircraft. By moving to
T-7 the eviction from T-6 was complied with 5 weeks ahead of the
deadline of January 15.

Hardly had this move been started, however, before the Museum
was served with notice to vacate Building T-7 by February i, in
order that those bays could be used for a fighter-interceptor squadron
that is part of the air defense of the city of Chicago. This could
not be complied with because no place could be located or prepared
to receive the Museum material. Meanwhile the disassembling and
packing project was expedited and more material was moved outdoors.

Modifications in Air Force decisions involving the use of these
premises relaxed the pressure on the Museum to move and permitted
planning on a more efficient, longer-range basis. Because the ultimate
destination of this stored material is Washington, D. C., or vicinity,
The National Capital Planning Commission was asked to assist.
Following previous application for a site for a permanent National
Air Museum Building, the Commission had recommended using a
part of the Suitland building area. The Commission agreed to assign
a 21-acre plot of this area for a storage site.

Using funds that had been saved for the most part by reduced
rental charges at Park Ridge, the area at Suitland was surveyed, a
roadway and building areas were cleared, and six prefabricated But-
ler buildings were purchased. Remaining funds for 1952 sufliced
for the erection of only two buildings. With granting of the 1953
appropriation the other four buildings can be erected, and a portion of
the material at Park Ridge can be shipped. The efforts made at Park
Ridge by the Museum manager and assistants to preserve the material
there in spite of these conditions are detailed in another section of this
report.

The enforced concentration upon storage problems has necessarily
‘reduced the amount of time that could be applied by the Washington
office to local requirements. Here the exhibition program continues
138 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

to suffer from lack of space, and activities are limited by the relatively
small force of personnel, yet every effort has been made to keep a
high standard for the displays and informational services that are
the two principal ways in which the Museum serves the public. ‘These
and other activities of the bureau are covered further in this report.

There have been changes and reductions in personnel, the most im-
portant being the retirement on April 30, 1952, of Carl W. Mitman
after 41 years with the Smithsonian, closing his career in the position
of Assistant to the Secretary for the National Air Museum. His
thorough knowledge of museum techniques, educational methods, and
Government procedures, combined with excellent administrative
ability, gave to the National Air Museum a firm foundation during
the critical days of its establishment. Paul E. Garber was made head
curator on April 10.

Following the retirement of Mr. Mitman, the bureau gave up its
administrative quarters in the northeast corner of the Arts and In-
dustries Building, concentrating the offices in the group of rooms
erected several years ago in the opposite corner of the same building.

The accessions for the year have brought additions to many parts of
the collection, including full-sized aircraft, engines, instruments,
experimental and scale-model aircraft, parachutes, and trophies.
They also are evidence of a growing recognition of the function of
the National Air Museum by other Government departments, the air-
craft industry, and individuals who with confidence can entrust their
significant treasures to the bureau’s custody, enabling the Museum
to not only keep abreast of recent developments but also to fill gaps
in the background story.

ADVISORY BOARD

No meetings of the Board were held during the year; there was
one change in personnel, Maj. Gen. Donald L. Putt, U.S. A. F., being
replaced by Maj. Gen. Laurence C. Craigie, U. S. A. F. He and
members of his staff have been particularly helpful in enabling adjust-
ments to be made between the limited resources of the Museum and
the eviction schedule of the Air Force at Park Ridge; and also in
effecting the preparation of the site for the new storage area at Suit-
land, Md. The naval member of the Board, Rear Adm. Thomas S.
Combs, and his civilian assistant for Museum liaison, Alfred V.
Verville, have cooperated closely with the Museum officials in pre-
paring and transferring selected naval specimens to the Museum and in
preserving other significant naval air items on naval premises until
the Museum can take custody of them. The civilian presidential
appointees to the Board, Grover Loening and William B. Stout, have
been of frequent assistance in recommending that certain desirable
objects be procured and in offering other helpful suggestions.

SECRETARY’S REPORT 139
STEPHENSON BEQUEST

Separate mention was made in the previous report of the bequest
of George H. Stephenson of Philadelphia, Pa., to provide for the Air
Museum an appropriate statue of Maj. Gen. William Mitchell.
During this fiscal year Smithsonian officials with the cooperation of
the Fine Arts Commission gave consideration to the designs and
capabilities of a number of sculptors.

SPECIAL EVENTS AND DISPLAYS

For the annual meeting of the Smithsonian Board of Regents, held
on January 18, the Air Museum prepared a display based on the recent
development and use of helicopters, featuring as the central unit the
prototype example of the “Hoppi-Copter,” designed by Edward Pen-
tecost as a manually supported helicopter for individual transporta-
tion. With this was shown a scale model of the Sikorsky KR-4,
which accomplished the first cross-country helicopter trip in America,
1942. The original XR-4 is in the Museum collection but is stored
for lack of exhibition space. Grouped with the scale model were a
number of photographs illustrating the other full-sized helicopters in
the collection. Of this group of eight, space is available for exhibit-
ing only two.

The twenty-fifth anniversary of Col. Charles Lindbergh’s trans-
Atlantic flight in the Spirit of St. Louis increased the normally high
interest in thisairplane. Assistance was given to a number of authors,
historians, and photographers who were recording the anniversary
and to managers of radio and television programs who included ref-
erences to this occasion in their broadcasts. Colonel Lindbergh him-
self visited the Museum during this period and sat once again at the
controls of his plane as he made some notes on the flights in 1927; his
commendation upon the excellent condition of this airplane, which has
been in the Museum continuously since 1928, was most gratifying.

In connection with construction of the shop in the Aircraft Build-
ing last year a broad space was provided on its outer wall, adaptable
for pictorial displays. With the cooperation of Consolidated Vultee
Aircraft a series of photographic enlargements was selected and
mounted there, illustrating the progress of design throughout the
history of that company, ranging from the PT-1 of 1925 to the huge
B-36 of today. The Museum intends to rotate this type of exhibit and
will be pleased to make this same space available to other aircraft
companies for similar displays.

SURVEY

The search for desirable specimens to add to the collection, and con-
tacts to determine their characteristics and significance were carried
140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

out this year largely by correspondence, most of the Museum’s funds
for travel being utilized for trips between Washington and the stor-
age facility at Park Ridge, for administrative purposes. The results
of survey are reflected in the list of accessions which is in the last
pages of this Report. The following trips were primarily for survey
purposes:

July 17, by the associate curator, Robert Strobell, to Lancaster, Pa., to inspect
at the factory of Valley Frocks, Inc., a group of early parachutes and other
equipment dating back to World War I.

August 14, by the curator, to Detroit, Mich., and vicinity, to check progress
on scale models of aircraft under construction and inspect aeronautical material
assembled for the Air Show display.

March 20, by the associate curator, to Dayton, Ohio, to confer regarding details
of drawings of the Wright Brothers’ Kitty Hawk aeroplane, and to discuss cur-
rent projects at the Air Force Technical Museum.

March 24, by the curator, to Philadelphia, Pa., and vicinity, to examine a group
of aircraft engines offered to the Air Museum by the Navy, to inspect a Fairchild
FC-2 photographic airplane offered by Virgil Kauffman and to discuss develop-
ments in air photography with officials and technicians of the Aero Service
Corporation.

IMPROVEMENTS IN SPECIMENS AND EXHIBITS

One of the outstanding specimens received during the year is the
original experimental radio-controlled model which, through free-
flight test, provided vital data for the design, construction, and op-
eration of the Consolidated XP5Y-1 flying boat. Unfortunately this
model, 1:10 size, had been badly damaged in transit. Its repair con-
stituted a problem that required a knowledge of the original proce-
dures as well as the skill of expert modelmakers. This combination
of talents was embodied in the designer who was responsible for de-
veloping this progressive method of aircraft testing, Ernest Stout,
and the exhibits workers of the Museum, Winthrop Shaw and assist-
ant Peter Bisio. Working together they have restored the model to
its original appearance. Another model restored in the shop is an
original small glider of E. C. Huffaker, who worked as assistant to
Professor Langley and made a brief visit to the camp of the Wright
Brothers at Kitty Hawk in 1901. In the wall cases surrounding the
outer wall of the new shop in the Aircraft Building, displays of na-
tural flight, early concepts of human flight, lighter-than-air craft, and
parachutes are being placed. Because these are elementary phases
of aeronautics and the cases are near the entrance to the building they
constitute an interesting introduction to the exhibits. Other exhibi-
tion cases that have been improved during the year include the one in
which an early airfield is shown with aircraft of the period 1908-16,
the case containing famous trophies that have inspired progress in
aircraft design and performance, the memorial case to Amelia Ear-
hart, and the three large cases in which progressive types of airplanes

SECRETARY’S REPORT 141

used by the Navy, Air Force, and Air Mail are grouped in chronologi-
cal sequence. Several additional models, listed in the lot of acces-
sions at the end of this report, have expanded these groups.

Usual cleaning and preservation treatments were given to the Lilien-
thal glider, the Kitty Hawk, Spirit of St. Louis, Fokker D-7, Grum-
man F3F Gulfhawk-2, and Republic F-84 Thunderjet. Manne-
quins with clothing resembling that of Otto Lilienthal and Orville
Wright were prepared with the cooperation of the L. A. Darling
Co., and placed in the glider and Kitty Hawk, making their methods
of control much more understandable to the public. The progres-
sive line-up of power units along “Engine Row” in the Aircraft
Building continued to be improved by rearrangements, additions, and
selective substitutions. Two important specimens were put on dis-
play; namely, original rockets developed by Robert Goddard
(1882-1945) who, in some of his earlier experiments was assisted by
grants from the Smithsonian and later by the Daniel and Florence
Guggenheim Foundation. These rockets, showing types of 1934-35
and 1939-41, were conditioned and labeled with the helpful assistance
of Mrs. Goddard; additions to this group will soon be added. The
display of the Hispano Suiza engine of World War I has been im-
proved by placing with it two large photographs received from S. E.
M. Hispano Suiza, Colombes (Seine), France, illustrating the orig-
inal Birkigt design of 1916, and the engine used by the renowned
French ace George Guynemer.

Each of the accessions received during the year that could be ex-
hibited provided an improvement in the displays; it is regretted that
lack of space prevents showing all of them. The Navy Department
was responsible for adding 10 engines to the collection, several of them
from the earliest years of human flight; but the outstanding addition
was received from the Curtiss-Wright Corporation, with grateful ac-
knowledgment to George Page, prominent aircraft designer, who
has helped to protect this wonderful relic throughout the years until
it could be placed in permanent care. This famous engine is the
prototype for those made by Glenn Curtiss for the early airships of
Thomas Baldwin and the pioneer airplanes then being developed by
the Aerial Experiment Association headed by Alexander Graham
Bell. Curtiss decided to test this engine in a motorcycle, and at Day-
tona Beach, Fla., January 24, 1907, established a world record for
human speed that lasted for many years—137 miles per hour. As
a motorcycle, this specimen is unique, but as a test bed for an airplane
engine it is one of the most renowned in aeronautical history. The
collection of trophies was greatly improved this year by the receipt
of one of the most famous, the Collier Trophy, which since 1911 has
inspired progress. Of the 35 awards of the Collier Trophy to date,
25 of them are now represented among the Air Museum’s collections,
142 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

The Collier Trophy, together with the Brewer Trophy and the Klemin
Plaque, will be withdrawn briefly each year for succeeding presenta-
tions and then returned to the Museum for continued public view;
but the Wright Brothers’ Memorial Trophy is the original replica
example and will remain permanently in the Museum. Two examples
of impressive contrast are provided by new accessions; these are the
“Gibson Girl” radio, used for emergency rescue in World War II, com-
pared to the Lear automatic pilot and radio equipment used by Capt.
C. F. Blair, Jr., in his polar flight from Norway to Alaska in 1950;
and the reproduction of the original Wright Brothers’ wind tunnel,
1902, compared with a modern precision steel wind-tunnel model of
the Grumman F7F 7igercat. Other accessions supplement existing
exhibits. These are the model of the Cloudster received from Douglas
Aircraft as an auxiliary specimen to their World Cruiser Chicago; and
the droppable landing gear used in the take-offs for Wiley Post’s
substratosphere flights. Both the Chicago and Post’s Winnie Mae
have been in the collection for many years. Also in this category
are the original telemetering and film instruments used in the super-
sonic flights of the Air Force’s Bell X-1, which, now that they have
been released by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,
can be placed with the plane in the Aircraft Building. Among
the year’s accessions, perhaps the most prophetic specimen is the
Delta wing model, one of the basic concepts of this design. Further
mention of each new specimen is given in the last part of this report.

STORAGE

Some of the difficulties encountered in finding quarters for housing
the Air Museum’s storage collection have been described. Among the
assembled aircraft five were maintained flyable and of those, two—
the B-29 Enola Gay and the B-17-D Swoose—were flown to other
storage areas. The Beechcraft Bonanza Waikiki Beech was, at the
request of the donors, Beech Aircraft, returned to them. The Douglas
XB-42 Mixmaster was disassembled and moved away by truck to an
Air Force storage area. Even after most of the boxed material had
been moved into Building T-7, another partial move had to be made
within the building when the roof developed serious leaks, and speci-
mens had to be kept away from the dripping and puddling water.
Following a careful scrutiny by the Advisory Board and officials of
the Air Force and Air Museum of the aircraft that had been gathered
at Park Ridge, 16 were scheduled during the fiscal year for separation
from the collection. The handling of these planes as they left for
other Air Force Bases or educational institutions and elsewhere was
a large task. Disassembly of nine full-scale aircraft preparatory to
boxing presented unique problems because many of these were obsolete

SECRETARY’S REPORT 143

or of foreign make with little or no printed data available to govern
procedure. Twenty-five aircraft were boxed during the year, each
one presenting its own problems of handling, placing, bracing, and
enclosing; 30 boxes were required for the total, some planes needing
extra containers for wings and components. Many of the boxes in
which aircraft had originally been received required repair during the
year, and all those that were placed outdoors had to be roofed with
waterproof covering and sprayed with heavy Abesto liquid. This
exterior protection supplemented the careful coating of the aircraft
and engines inside with Parelketone, Cosmolene, and other applica-
tions, each best suited to the surface being protected. Nine engines
were boxed during the year, but at the close of June all 151 engines
were due for another inspection, preservative coating, and dehydra-
tion treatment. In many instances the handling, disassembly, and
preservation of specimens required special study and care by the staff
to determine best procedures.

Because of the precarious status of the storage housing, few items
of new material were brought to Park Ridge. Enforced concentra-
tion on other aspects of the work left no opportunity for inventory-
ing, but guarding was maintained on a 24-hour schedule, even through
severe winter nights. During one particularly bad blizzard all hands
had to drop other assignments and make a powered snow shovel to clear
paths to the outdoor boxes and aircraft. With it all some time was
found to assist research workers using the collection for study purposes
and to prepare some educational displays requested by the Air Force
for recruiting purposes.

ASSISTANCE TO OTHER AGENCIES

The tangible evidence of aeronautical progress and history em-
bodied in the collection, the extensive files maintained as auxiliary data
for the material on display and in storage, and the expert knowledge
of the staff are frequently called upon to be of service to government
and industry and to students, engineers, authors, historians, and
others. This is one of the most interesting phases of the work and
pays a direct return to the nation for the maintenance of the collection.

It is particularly gratifying when the possibility of accident can
be forestalled. The Bell Supersonic airplane X-—1 became a source
for such service during the year. The National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautics, the Navy, and Air Force are continuing to use similar
aircraft for high-speed and extreme-altitude research. In July the
National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics was faced with the
problem of determining the safety factor and life expectancy of the
high-pressure nitrogen spheres in supersonic aircraft that were flying
-at Edwards Air Force Base on regular test hops. When NACA
144 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

found that the only spheres available at that base for tests were in
their operational airplanes they turned to the National Air Museum
for assistance rather than ground their airplanes and interrupt their
essential research. The Museum agreed to lend the spheres from
the X-1. The test consisted of pressurizing the spheres to their maxi-
mum of 1,500 p. s. i. and then reducing the pressure to zero, thus com-
pleting one cycle. The spheres indicated failure at approximately
1,800 cycles. It was found that NACA’s airplane was very close to
the safety factor established as a result of these tests; therefore, their
airplane was grounded for overhaul. At the close of the year ar-
rangements had been made to reinstall the spheres in the Museum’s
Bell X-1.

The Department of Justice, in connection with patent claims, has
been investigating basic types of attachments used in parachute gear
and found interesting examples among the early parachutes in the
collection. This Department was also assisted in looking up original
types of engine mounts and shieldings. The technical-data office of
the Bureau of Aeronautics was assisted in compiling records of
trophies and awards, in which naval personnel were represented.
The historical office of the Air Force was given assistance in setting
up forms and methods for recording historic specimens, based on pro-
cedures proven through the years in Museum practice. The Signal
Corps was helped in tracing types of kites used to support radio
antennae, and the Coast Guard consulted the Museum specimens and
records to trace techniques used in air-borne human pick-up gear.

Educational institutions that benefited from Air Museum assistance
included local schools that were advised regarding their aeronautical
curriculum. The University of Pittsburgh was helped in tracing
details of the aerodynamic testing devices constructed and used by
Prof. S. P. Langley, third Secretary of the Smithsonian, when he was
at the Allegheny Observatory in 1886 before coming to this Institu-
tion. The Jam Handy organization of Detroit, engaged in prepara-
tion of training films and texts for the Navy and other users, turned
to the Air Museum for help in compiling a history of helicopter de-
velopment. The Musée de l’Air, Paris, France, through its distin-
guished conservateur, Charles Dollfus, requested aid in improving its
files on the NC, U. S. Navy flying boat, 1919, first to fly across the
Atlantic; and the RB-1, racing plane of advanced design entered in
the Gordon Bennett Race of 1920. It was a particular pleasure to
assist Mr. Dollfus, in view of his many kindnesses to the National
Air Museum.

Assistance to industry has been in connection with filling in lost
records of past accomplishments in a variety of instances. The con-
tacts that are most gratifying are those in which the Museum recog-
nizes the significance of some treasured object preserved from the

SECRETARY'S REPORT 145

days of the company’s pioneer origin, and it is agreed to place it in
the Museum where it can take its deserved place in the collection.

Over 700 correspondence requests for information have been an-
swered during the year and 256 photographs distributed.

The committees upon which the head curator served during the
year include the Brewer Trophy Committee for the National Aero-
nautic Association which annually chooses an outstanding person
who has contributed to youth education in aeronautics; the National
Science Fair board of judges, which selects deserving students to
receive higher education in science; and the Kill Devil Hills Memorial
Association Committee, which is planning to erect at Kitty Hawk,
N. C.,a museum to commemorate those accomplishments of the Wright
Brothers that were performed at that location.

The head curator gave several lectures during the year on various
phases of aeronautics, including kites, the air mail, development of
airports, and different aspects of the history of aeronautics; and the
associate curator, Robert Strobell, has conducted tours of the collec-
tion for different groups, notably the international exchange group
of flight cadets from 16 nations who were guests of the Civil Air
Patrol.

IMPROVEMENTS IN REFERENCE MATERIAL

Great improvement in the reference material this year was accom-
plished by the associate curator and two clerical assistants. This
material includes the Air Museum’s library of books and periodicals,
the original correspondence and source records for specimens, exten-
sive data on all phases of aeronautics in the form of scaled dimensioned
drawings, illustrations, texts, catalogs, clippings, and excerpts from
correspondence in which detailed information was received or given;
and the photograph file which is a numbered and cross-referenced
collection of mounted prints for which negatives are maintained and
from which prints can be supplied at cost. During the year this
collection has increased substantially with particular emphasis upon
aircraft of World War II. The process of indexing, captioning, and
mounting was improved so that all material received during the year
was indexed and filed, and the backlog reduced. Improvements were
also made in the system of recording accessions and specimens.

For several years the National Air Museum has been collecting pe-
riodicals in an effort to establish a functional reference library. Indi-
vidual collections received from the National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics, R. M. Kinderman, Scott Appleby, Smithsonian Institu-
tion duplicate stacks, and other sources remained in storage until it
was indicated that sufficient material was available to establish the
periodical library. Further impetus was given to the project when
it was learned that the Division of Aeronautics, Library of Congress,

146 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

was planning to dispose of its large collection of duplicate periodicals.
Arrangements were made to screen these duplicates, select issues re-
quired to fill gaps in the National Air Museum collection, and transfer
the material to the Museum. Accordingly the first step was taken in
March when the National Air Museum’s collections were screened and
cataloged so that the required issues could be selected from the Library
of Congress. About 6,000 periodicals were selected. Early in May
the integrating of all the collections was started, with an estimated
18,000 periodicals on hand. Space was provided in the east room of
the office suite. By the first week in June the periodicals had been
placed in chronological order ready for reference use. This periodical
library now consists of all the major aeronautical titles published in
the United States and two titles published in England. While some
volumes are incomplete, all years are covered by at least one title.
The intention is to establish a ready reference library of major titles
only. The periodicals are now being cataloged on cards which will
serve the usual record purposes and in addition list shortages for in-
tensified search to complete the volumes.

Detailed drawings of the Wright Brothers’ Kitty Hawh aeroplane
were prepared by the Musical Arts and Educational Foundation, Day-
ton, Ohio, under the direction of L. P. Christman.

Other additions to the reference files were received from W. B. Stout,
who lent drawings of the famous Ford-Stout airliner of the 1980's;
Ivan Jerome, who improved the file on helicopters; Maj. Kimbrough
Brown, long a friend of the Museum who, now in Europe, sent en-
riching material on foreign aircraft and some rare books; Capt.
Holden C. Richardson, U. S. N., who, under assignment from the
Navy Department in the interests of the Museum, prepared data from
which a model of the Navy 82—A seaplane could be constructed, this
being the first plane designed by the Navy and Captain Richardson’s
original project in 1916. At the close of the fiscal year Captain Rich-
ardson was preparing drawings and data on the NC-4. E. H. Heine-
mann of Douglas Aircraft sent illustrations of Douglas types,
performance charts, and other very informative drawings; Fred Wise-
man, of Berkeley, Calif., sent copies of contemporary accounts of his
pioneer flight with air mail in 1911; R. W. Griswold I was very help-
ful in improving the files on delta wing configurations; and Capt.
Charles F. Blair supplied descriptions of his renowned flight over the
North Pole, May 29, 1951.

The following reference material, considered especially noteworthy,
has been separately entered in an acknowledgment file:

Warren M. Bodie and James J. Sloan, Aero Historical Society, Van Nuys, Calif. :

A collection of 16 photographs and 7 negatives of racing aircraft and other
significant types.

SECRETARY’S REPORT 147

RESEARCH

The many requests for information received during each year require
extensive research by the staff, while the preparation of displays
entails extended study in order to prepare correct labels and present
the material in its best and most complete form. In addition, the
staff members, when other obligations permit, engage in separate
research projects with a view to improving the collections and files.
A study of biographical material on noted airmen of World War I
has yielded interesting facts and exhibition material. The develop-
ment of helicopters is a project undertaken in connection with the
Aviation Industries Association and several manufacturers and has
brought in significant specimens, photographs, and texts. Apprecia-
tion is expressed to those authorities who have assisted with other
research undertakings; these include Mrs. Esther C. Goddard, who
personally checked labels to be exhibited with the rockets developed
by her late husband; Burdette Wright, who supplied helpful refer-
ences on the Curtiss P-40; and James Ray and his son, who gave
information on autogiro theory and operation.

ACCESSIONS

This year the bureau received 110 specimens from 21 sources, com-
prising 30 separate accessions. ‘Those from Government departments
are recorded as transfers; others were received as gifts, except as noted.

APPENDIX 10

Report on the Canal Zone Biological Area

Sir: It gives me pleasure to present herewith the annual report of
the Canal Zone Biological Area for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1952.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

Construction of the new 2-story laboratory begun last year was
completed. The entire ground floor is now of reinforced concrete,
extending 5 feet beyond the building on all four sides. The ground
under the concrete was treated with sodium arsenite, as a protection
against termites; all four sides were walled in with terra-cotta blocks
faced with cement; and the building was surrounded by a concrete
ditch. The lower windows are in aluminum frames, and all windows
are provided with plastic screens. A photographic dark room, 15 x 11
feet, is included. Two laboratory rooms, 15 x 23 feet, were built, each
to accommodate two to four scientists. These rooms will be provided
with beds and dressers, and it is hoped to install dry closets in each.
Funds to install sinks, work tables, and shelves will need to be supplied
later.

The ground behind the building was leveled and a pit dug for an
additional concrete water tank to store the runoff from the roof of the
building. Since this reservoir is urgently needed, it is hoped that
it can be completed during the next fiscal year.

The ground floor of the zinc-meta-arsenite building, just below the
main laboratory building, was covered with reinforced concrete and
will be available for laboratory use. The building has two rooms,
each with a separate entrance, which will comfortably accommodate
two persons in each room. The lower floor of the main laboratory
has been cleared of miscellaneous storage material, and this has
about doubled the available working space for scientists.

The library and herbarium now in the Haskins building are being
transferred to rooms on the upper floor of the new building. When
this change is completed, the kitchen equipment will be moved into
the larger, fireproof Haskins building. The toilets and showers,
now in the main laboratory building, will then be moved into the
old kitchen building.

The large main building, which accommodates six persons, is in
satisfactory general condition but will soon need repairs to screening

150

SECRETARY’S REPORT 151

and the addition of a dry storage room. To reduce the fire risk, the
attic is no longer used for drying purposes.

The resident manager’s house and the building used for the East-
man Kodak Co.’s research on deterioration and corrosion are both in
good shape. The Barbour cottage, which can accommodate two to
four persons, is in good repair. The old Chapman building is serv-
iceable but not in too good condition; with some repairs it can last
about two years more. It accommodates four persons, and all the
ground floor is used for laboratory purposes.

The building now occupied by the caretaker and the dormitory
for the cook are in good shape; but the dormitory for the laborers
needs repairs.

The trail-end houses on Barbour Point and Burrunga Point now
are usable only as temporary shelters from rain. The treated-wood
house at the end of the Drayton Trail and the Z-M-A house (Fuertes
House) are in good condition. The shelter at the end of Zetek Trail
is in fairly good condition but needs some repairs.

The old generators for light and power are no longer in shape to
operate, except one 5 KVA, and that one is far from satisfactory.
The new 15 KVA Diesel-driven generators, now on order, should
give satisfactory service for at least 10 years.

The floating equipment is in good condition.

MOST URGENT NEEDS

The most pressing need is for a concrete platform building at the
dock to house the two new generators soon to arrive and the Diesel-
oil storage tank, with loading and unloading equipment at Frijoles.
Next in order is the concrete water-storage tank behind the new
building.

There is a real need for suitable dry closets; these should be made
during the coming fiscal year. Reducing the humidity to control
corrosion and deterioration cannot always be accomplished by heat.
In some cases the use of dehumidifiers is preferable, especially in
the photographic darkroom and where chemicals are to be stored.

In the new building, sinks, shelves, and closets should be installed.

SCIENTISTS AND THEIR STUDIES

The principal purpose of the Canal Zone Biological Area is to
provide a safe tropical environment for research. In view of the far-
flung interests of our nation, it is of vital importance that problems
related to tropical conditions be solved in advance of the need for
information on those conditions in defense operations. Work of this
character is done by many scientists from universities and institutions,

236639—53——11
152 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

and at no expense to the Government. This research should receive
every encouragement.

During the 1952 fiscal year, 48 scientists were on the island. The
high cost of transportation to the Canal Zone still keeps many from
coming, and some of those who do come cannot spend as much time
on the island as they would like. A list of the season’s investigators,
with a brief summary of their researches, follows:

set of the Journal of Parasitology, and a long series of complete
bound volumes of the Experiment Station Record; also considerable

laboratory glassware.
RAINFALL

In 1951, rains of 0.01 inch or more fell on 48 days (154 hours)
during the dry season (January to April), and on 194 days (764
hours) during the wet season (8 months); a total for the year of
242 days, 918 hours. Rainfall was 5.44 inches above the 27-year
average. During the dry season the excess amounted to 7.56 inches,
and during the wet season there was a deficiency of 2.12 inches. Five
of the eight wet-season months registered deficiencies, amounting to
a total of 11.24 inches. October was the wettest month, with 19.43
inches (27 days, 128 hours). March was the driest month, with 0.30
inch (4 days, 11 hours). A new 1-hour record was established on
October 12, 4.11 inches. The previous high was 3.68 inches.

The maximum yearly rainfall of record on the island was 143.42
inches, and the minimum was 76.57 inches. For short periods the
following were the maximums: 5 minutes, 0.85 inch; 10 minutes, 1.40
inches; 1 hour, 4.11 inches; 2 hours, 4.81 inches; 24 hours, 10.48 inches.

FISCAL REPORT

During the fiscal year 1952, $11,558.12 in trust funds was available.
This sum included a balance of $226 from 1951 and $3,000 contributed
by the Smithsonian Institution from its private funds. Of this
amount $11,294.09 was spent, leaving a balance of $264.03.

The following items are paid out of trust funds: Food, wages,
freight and express, office expenses, and miscellaneous expenses such
as parts for the automobile, kitchen equipment, and general upkeep.
This year food represented 41.8 percent of the total expended, and
wages, 53.8 percent.

The Smithsonian Institution allotted $16,646.96 from Government-
appropriated funds, of which $16,600.38 was expended. Of this
amount $7,580 was for two new 15-KVA Diesel-driven generators, and
$4,217.78 for contracts to complete the lower floor of the new building
erected this year. Approximately $1,850 from allotted funds was used
for the purchase and transportation from Frijoles to the island of
gravel, sand, cement, and reinforcing steel for the completion of this
lower floor.

SECRETARY’S REPORT 157

During the year fees from scientists totaled $3,722, more than four
times as much as the amount received for the fiscal year 1951. Visitors’
fees amounted to $1,503. Reimbursements for supplies furnished
amounted to $756.72.

The rates for scientists and visitors have not been raised since the
laboratory started in 1928, despite the rising costs of food, wages, ma-
terials, and services; but increased costs have reached the point where
the laboratory is now reluctantly forced to increase its rates. The
new rates now in effect are $3 per person for 1-day visitors, $4 a full
day for scientists from institutions that support the laboratory
through table subscriptions, and $5 a full day for all others. A 1-day
visit includes the use of the launch to and from the island, the noon
meal, and the guide in the morning. A full day for scientists in-
cludes three meals and lodging.

The following institutions continued their support to the laboratory
through the payment of table subscriptions:

Report on the Library

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the Smithsonian Library for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1952.

Probably not since 1866, when the Smithsonian Deposit in the
Library of Congress was established by Act of Congress, has there
been an event in the history of the Smithsonian Library more epoch-
marking than the transfer, after more than a hundred years, of the
librarian’s office from the Smithsonian Building to the Natural His-
tory Building and the dismantling of the old office library reference
room, in order to effect a consolidation of all major library functions
of the Institution. The National Museum Library, as a separate
branch, was merged with the Smithsonian Library, and its staff, func-
tions, and equipment were consolidated with the units of the Smith-
sonian Library. The consolidated library will hereafter be known
as the Smithsonian Library. The position of assistant librarian in
charge of the National Museum Library was changed to that of chief
of the reference and circulation section of the Smithsonian Library.
The change became effective on November 2, 1951.

The Museum Library had long been the largest of the Institution’s
branch libraries, with the most comprehensive subject coverage in its
basic reference collections. Its reference services had never been
limited to the curatorial staff of the Museum but were given to the
whole Institution, and interlibrary loans were handled by its loan
desk. Its physical separation from the administrative offices of the
library in the Smithsonian Building resulted in a considerable and
increasing amount of duplication of cataloging and other record keep-
ing and of the acquisition of reference books. It is hoped that the
present centralization of staff, functions, records, and materials will
result in better and more economical library service to the whole
Institution.

The change in quarters affected the work of the acquisitions section
somewhat less than that of the other sections. It had an exceptionally
busy year. Its records show the receipt of 60,512 publications, most
of which came either by mail or through the International Exchange
Service from 92 different foreign countries, dominions, colonies, and
protectorates, as well as from all the States of the Union. The library
continues to owe the largest part of this wide coverage of the special

158

SECRETARY’S REPORT 159

literature needed by the scientific and curatorial staff of the Institu-
tion to the cordial exchange relations maintained with scientific and
other cultural institutions throughout the world. These relations
are continually being extended, and there were 531 new exchanges
arranged during the year, while 7,899 different publications were
received in response to 497 special requests for volumes or parts of
serial publications needed to fill gaps in our collections.

Acquisitions by purchase included 1,278 books and 332 subscriptions
for foreign and domestic serial publications not obtainable by ex-
change. Most of the books bought were recent publications, but a
few of the many out-of-print works still much needed were purchased
as they came into the market. It is highly desirable to be able to buy
the most needed of these old books when copies are advertised for sale,
but many of them are prohibitively expensive for a small budget, when
they are available at all.

As always, friends of the Institution made many generous gifts to
the library. Especially noteworthy among the larger donations was
a selection of more than a thousand volumes from the library of the
late Gen. John J. Pershing, presented by his son, Francis W. Pershing,
especially for the use of the division of military history in the National
Museum.

The library is deeply indebtedly to many members of the Smith-
sonian staff for their generosity and thoughtfulness in giving the
library copies of their own publications and other books and papers.
Stamp collectors everywhere will, directly or indirectly, have reason
to be especially grateful to Franklin R. Bruns, Jr., for the more than
1,500 publications on stamps he has donated from his own library to
the sectional library in the division of philately. Many other gifts
to the sectional library were obtained through his good offices.

Of the grand total of 22,774 publications transferred to the Library
of Congress during the year, 5,573 were books and serial publications
individually stamped and recorded as additions to the Smithsonian
Deposit. Others were 2,481 doctoral dissertations from European
universities, and 14,720 foreign and domestic documents, and many
miscellaneous publications on subjects not immediately pertinent to
the work of the Institution.

Of the 3,216 publications transferred to the Army Medical Library,
581 were medical dissertations. To other government libraries were
sent 425 publications on subjects in their special fields of interest.

There were one or two fairly large and a number of small with-
drawals from the library’s huge collection of duplicates, but the collec-
tion continued to grow. The 11,420 pieces selected and sent to the
United States Book Exchange, for exchange credit, made no noticeable
impression on it. The collection needs the exclusive time and atten-
‘tion of a small staff of its own, working under the direction of the
160 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1952

chief of the acquisitions section, to keep it in order and to make the best
possible use of it for exchange purposes.

In the catalog section, the merging of the separate catalogs of
the Museum books and serials with the central catalog and serial
records of the Institution was begun immediately and has gone for-
ward as fast as circumstances would permit. There is an enormous
amount of work to be done in such an enterprise where more than a
million cards must be handled with scrupulous accuracy in unifying
entries and eliminating unnecessary duplication. Under the most
favorable conditions it will take a long time to complete it, but when
it is finished the Institution will have the most complete record it
has ever had of the library’s collections and, it is hoped, the most
effective aid to their use.

In addition to the work of reorganization in the catalog section,
5,779 publications were cataloged, 20,175 parts of serial publications
were entered, and 30,488 cards were added to catalogs and shelflists.

The work of the reference and circulation section is most difficult
to measure and evaluate statistically because figures are very imper-
fect indices of the many indeterminate variables involved in reference
services to the staff and bringing together the books and their users.
However, statistics show that 11,780 publications were borrowed for
use outside the library, exclusive of 7,314 books and periodicals as-
signed to sectional libraries for filing which are circulated within the
divisions to which they are assigned. Interlibrary loans of 1,231
publications were made to 99 different Government, university, and
other institutional libraries throughout the country. For use within
the Institution, the library borrowed 1,357 publications from the
Library of Congress, many of which were Smithsonian Deposit copies,
and 405 publications were borrowed from other libraries.

More than 16,000 reference questions were answered in response
to letters and telephone calls and to inquirers who came to the library
in person.

Funds allotted for binding permitted only 623 volumes, mostly
currently completed volumes of periodicals, to be prepared and sent
to the Government Printing Oflice, but 1,563 old books were repaired
in the library. The library is in no sense a museum of fine books,
but it nevertheless has many valuable volumes, and not a few irre-
placeable ones in its working reference collections that are actually
collector’s items. How to give them the proper housing and the
continuous care that they ought to have to maintain them in good
condition is one of the library’s most serious problems.

The principal need of the library continues to be more and better-
arranged space, with adequate provision for growth. It also needs
a staff of competent librarians commensurate in size with the require-
ments of the Institution for library service. It needs more funds for

SECRETARY'S REPORT 161

books and especially for binding. Many of the physical and organ-
izational changes inaugurated during the year were good, considered
as initial steps in long-range planning, but plans can only be brought
to fruition if they are firmly and continuously supported by the means
to carry them out.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ra:
FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Early in 1906, by deed of gift, Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, gave
to the Institution his collection of Chinese and other Oriental objects
of art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art by
Whistler, Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also gave
funds for construction of a building to house the collection, and
finally in his will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock
and securities to the estimated value of $1,958,591.42, as an endowment
fund for the operation of the Gallery.

The above fund of Mr. Freer was almost entirely represented by
20,465 shares of stock in Parke, Davis & Co. As this stock advanced
in value, much of it was sold and the proceeds reinvested so that the
fund now amounts to $6,752,796.55 in selected securities.
