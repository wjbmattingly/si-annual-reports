UPON

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. 8S, NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1900,

BY

RicHarRD RATHBUN,

Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

The act of Congress of 1846 establishing the Smithsonian Institu-
tion made it the legal place of deposit for all ‘‘ objects of art and of
foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants,
and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United
States,” and thereby created, in fact if not in name, a national museum.
With extraordinary foresight the same act provided for additions to
the national collections by exchange, donation, or other means, and
for the arrangement and classification of the specimens in a manner
best to facilitate their examination and study, all in such broad and
comprehensive terms as to cover the full activities of a great establish-
ment of this kind.

The Smithson fund at that time amounted to about half a million
dollars, a sum then considered ample to meet the needs of the multifa-
rious operations upon which it was proposed that the Smithsonian
Institution should enter. In 1846 probably not more than one or two
universities or learned establishments in America had so large an
endowment, and it was apparently the idea of Congress that the fund
was sufficient both for the erection of a building and for the care of the
collections which would be turned over to it or acquired by the national
surveys and in other ways. The Museum thus began as an integral
part of the Institution, coordinate with its library, and was required
by law to provide for the Government collections which had previ-
ously accumulated, a duty which the Institution did not see its way
clear to fulfill until 1858, when Congress began to make small yearly
appropriations for the purpose. So inadequate, however, were the

3
4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

sums voted, that for many years the slender income of the Institu-
tion was heavily drawn upon to insure the maintenance of what was
then called the Smithsonian Museum, and justly enough, since the
building was paid for out of the Smithson fund, a considerable por-
tion of the collections were and still are the actual property of the
Institution, through exploration, gift, and purchase, and at least a
number of the officials in charge of the collections were employed at
its expense.

The title ‘‘ National Museum,” first recognized by Congress in 1875,
came into general use through the display of the Government collec-
tions at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876. This was
the first exposition in this country in which the Government partici-
pated, and the first to make known to vast numbers of the people of
the United States the existence of national collections at Washington,
as well as new methods of installing and exhibiting museum materials,
differing radically from the older cabinets of college or local museums
which prevailed up to that time. After its close the material brought
back belonging to the Government, together with the extensive gifts
made to the United States by private persons and foreign govern-
ments, forced the erection of a separate building, which brought the
name ‘‘ National Museum” into greater prominence. Since that time
Congress has in the main provided for the maintenance of the Museum,
but its management remains, by the fundamental act, under the
authority of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, administered
through their Secretary, who is ex officio the keeper—a form of goy-
ernment insuring a consistent and uniform policy and a nonpartisan
administration of its affairs. The greater part of the Smithsonian
building is still used for museum purposes, and the Institution, as
well as all the scientific bureaus at Washington, cooperate, both
through men and material, in enlarging and caring for the national
collections.

With the primary object of preserving the collections in anthro-
pology, biology, and geology obtained by the Government surveys,
and of arranging them in a manner convenient for study, every
effort is made to complete the representation in all departments of
science and the arts capable of being illustrated in a material way.
Extensive series of specimens, selected with reference to their educa-
tional value and the popular interest they may excite, and bearing
appropriate labels, are exposed to view in the public halls. The
duplicate specimens are made up into sets for exchange and for dis-
tribution to schools and colleges throughout the country. Papers
descriptive of the collections, both technical and popular, are pub-
lished for gratuitous circulation to the extent of three or more vyol-
umes yearly; and, finally, the Museum has come to be regarded as a
sort of bureau of information, being constantly called upon to answer
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5

questions relating to every subject with which it might, in the remotest
degree, be concerned.

The first scientific collection to come into the possession of the Institu-
tion—and, in fact, it accompanied the bequest—was the small but valu-
able mineralogical cabinet of James Smithson, the founder, who was
himself a chemist and mineralogist of repute, and a Fellow of the
Royal Society of London. Some six years before the Institution had
been formally established, however, a society was organized in Wash-
ington under the name of the National Institution, afterwards changed
to the National Institute, which had for its avowed purpose the direc-
tion of the Smithson bequest and the pursuit of objects in consonance
with the terms of that foundation. One of these objects was the gather-
ing of historical and natural-history specimens, from both official and
private sources, prominent among the former having been the United
States Exploring Expedition of 1838-1842. Rooms in the Patent Office
building were secured for the museum of the society, which was vir-
tually recognized as the appropriate place of deposit for all Govern-
ment collections held in Washington, and here was actually accumu-
lated the nucleus of the National Museum. Another important service
rendered by the society was, as Doctor Goode has said, in the direction
of educating public opinion ‘‘to consider the establishment of such an
institution worthy of the attention of the Government of the United
States.” Failing, however, to secure the public recognition at which
it aimed, the National Institute became inactive in 1846, though it con-
tinued in existence until 1861. The Government collections in its pos-
session, which were practically in the care of the Commissioner of
Patents, were turned over to the Smithsonian Institution in 1858.
Other material directly under the control of the National Institute
remained at the Patent Office until 1862, and a portion of the historical
objects were retained there until 1883.

The discussion of plans for the organization of the Smithsonian
Institution, which devolved upon its first Board of Regents, led in Janu-
ary, 1847, to the unanimous adoption of the following resolution
expressing approval of the museum feature as one of its important
functions:

Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress, and in accordance with the
design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that one of the principal modes of
executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of collections of specimens and
objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the gradual formation of a library
of valuable works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge, to the end that
a copious storehouse of materials of science, literature, and art may be provided,
which shall excite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall assist the

original investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to the pursuit
of any branch of knowledge.!

‘Report of committee on organization, p. 20.
6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

The transfer of Government collections to the Institution was, in
accordance with the Congressional act of 1846, to be effected ‘‘ when-
ever suitable arrangements can be made from time to time for their
reception.” In the absence of any stated limitations as to the time or
character of arrangements, the date for accepting the obligation rested
with the Regents, who, while confronted with the mandatory language
of the law, were still forced to recognize the inadequacy of the Smith-
sonian fund for the support of so large an undertaking. The cost of
the large and elaborate building, designed mainly for the accommoda-
tion of the museum and library, would have drawn heavily upon the
principal of the fund had not a policy of delay prevailed, and thus
nine years were allowed to elapse between the laying of the corner
stone, in 1846, and the completion of the structure. This delay gave
opportunity for influencing a change in sentiment, so that when, in
1857, the necessary arrangements became possible, Congress was
prepared to vote means for building cases, for transferring the speci-
mens from the Patent Office, and to a certain extent for the care and
preservation of the collections. The appropriations continued very
small, however, for many years, during which the Institution was
obliged to make up the deficit.

The vast amount of material secured for the Government at the
close of the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, which impelled the erec-
tion of a second building, for the exclusive use of the Museum, resulted
in a larger and more systematic organization. Twenty-five more years
have now elapsed, noteworthy for extensive explorations and surveys
both at home and abroad. Material has been pouring in from these
in a never-ceasing flow, first filling far beyond their ordinary capacity
the halls and storerooms of the two large buildings, and then requiring
to a greater and greater extent each year the use of outside quarters
for their mere shelter. The main buildings are essentially fireproof,
but not so the others, containing collections valued at hundreds of
thousands of dollars, which, through accident or maliciousness, might
at any time be destroyed.

While the collections in the custody of the National Institute
remained at the Patent Office until 1858, material for a museum was,
in the meantime, being accumulated at the Smithsonian Institution.
Reference has been made to the cabinet of minerals which had belonged
to Smithson, unhappily destroyed by fire in 1865. The personal bent
of Professor Baird, who became the Assistant Secretary of the Insti-
tution in 1850, was toward the collection of natural-history specimens
for the purposes of study. With the approval of Secretary Henry,
he put into operation plans for the accomplishment of this object,
which, fostered and encouraged, were soon yielding regular and abun-
dant returns. Professor Baird’s own vacations were spent in field
researches. Officers of the Army and Navy and of other branches of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. fi

the Government service, fishermen, fur traders, private explorers,
and such powerful organizations as the Hudson Bay Company and the
Western Union Telegraph Company were enlisted in the cause and
rendered valuable assistance. The influence exerted by these begin-
nings has been lasting and widespread, as shown in the extensive nat-
ural history operations. of subsequent national and State surveys, the
organization of the United States Fish Commission, and the support
given to scientific collecting by many other bureaus of the Govern-
ment.

Having as its first purpose the promotion of scientific research, next
accepting the custody of the Government and other collections, and
finally developing broadly along educational lines, the history of the
National Museum may, as the late Doctor Goode has pointed out, be
divided into three epochs, which he describes as follows:

First, the period from the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution to 1857, dur-
ing which time specimens were collected solely to serve as materials for research.
No special effort was made to exhibit them to the public or to utilize them, except
as afoundation for scientific description and theory. ‘

Second, the period from 1857, when the institution assumed the custody of the
** National Cabinet of Curiosities,’’ to 1876. During this period the Museum became
a place of deposit for scientific collections which had already been studied, these col-
lections, so far as convenient, being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable,
made to serve an educational purpose.

Third, the present period (beginning in the year 1876), in which the Museum has
undertaken more fully the additional task of gathering collections and exhibiting
them on account of their value from an educational standpoint.

During the first period the main object of the Museum was scientific research; in
the second, the establishment became a museum of record as well as of research;
while in the third period has been added the idea of public education. The three
ideas—record, research, and education—cooperative and mutually helpful as they are,
are essential to the development of every great museum. The National Museum
endeavors to promote them all.

It is @ museum of record, in which are preserved the material foundations of an
enormous amount of scientific knowledge—the typesof numerous past investigations.
This is especially the case with those materials that have served as a foundation for
the reports upon the resources of the United States.

It isa museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in the highest
degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scientific investigation. Research
is necessary in order to identify and group the objects in the most philosophical and
instructive relations, and its officers are therefore selected for their ability as investi-
gators, as well as for their trustworthiness as custodians.

It is an educational museum, through its policy of illustrating by specimens every
kind of natural object and every manifestation of human thought and activity, of
displaying descriptive labels adapted to the popular mind, and of distributing its
publications and its named series of duplicates.

In these words the objects of the Museum are so clearly defined and
the plan laid down is so broad that those who come after have but to
perfect the details while preserving that unity of interests which is
requisite if the structure as a whole shall forever prove worthy of its
founders and of this great nation.
8. REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

AS A MUSEUM OF RECORD.

In its capacity of a museum of record, the growth of the National
Museum has been unprecedented, due mainly to the rapid exploration
and development of a rich and extensive country, under the liberal
and progressive policy of the Government, whose inquiries into new
regions and into new fields have been pushed without stint. Scientific
institutions everywhere, foreign governments and individuals have
likewise contributed abundant stores of great value, and a small fund
in recent years has permitted of some purchases to supply desiderata.
The richness of the collections has also been much increased through
the exchange of duplicate specimens with other similar establishments.

The principal sources of the collections may be briefly summarized
as follows:

1. The explorations carried on more or less directly under the
auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, or by the Institution in
connection with educational institutions or commercial establish-
ments, and the efforts, since 1850, of its officers and correspond-
ents toward the accumulation of natural history and anthropological
material.

2. The United States Exploring Expedition around the world
from 1838 to 1842, the North Pacific or Perry Exploring Expedition
from 1853 to 1856, and many subsequent naval expeditions down
to and including the recent operations in West Indian and Phil-
ippine waters.

3. The activities of members of the United States diplomatic
and consular service abroad.

4. The Government surveys at home, such as the Pacific Rail-
road survey, the Mexican and Canadian boundary surveys, and the
surveys carried on by the Engineer Corps of the United States
Army; and the activities of officers of the Signal Corps, and other
branches of the Army stationed in remote regions.

5. The explorations of the United States Geological Survey,
the United States Fish Commission, the Department of Agricul-
ture, the Bureau of American Ethnology of the Smithsonian
Institution, and other scientific branches of the Government.

6. Donations and purchases in connection with the several expo-
sitions at homeand abroad in which the Museum or Fish Commission
have participated, among these having been the Centennial Exhi-
bition at Philadelphia in 1876, the international fisheries exhibitions
at Berlin in 1880 and at London in 1883, the New Orleans Cotton
Centennial Exposition in 1884 and 1885, the Cincinnati Exposition
of 1888, the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, and
the expositions at Atlanta in 1895, at Nashville in 1897, and at
Omaha in 1898. The returns from the Philadelphia Exhibition
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 9

were of greatest extent, comprising, besides the collections dis-
played by the United States in illustration of the animal and
mineral resources, the fisheries and the ethnology of the native
races of the country, valuable gifts from the thirty foreign gov-
ernments which participated, as well as the industrial collections
of numerous manufacturing and commercial houses of Eurove and
America.
7. Exchanges with foreign and domestic museums.

Immediately preceding the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, when the
collections were entirely provided for in the Smithsonian building,
the number of entries of specimens in the Museum record books was
about 235,000. In 1884, when the additional room afforded by the
new building gave opportunity for taking a provisional census of the
large accessions received from Philadelphia, and from other sources,
the number had grown to 1,471,000. It has gone on steadily increas-
ing every year, and now, at the close of 1900, the number of specimens
is in excess of 4,800,000.

While these figures convey no impression of the bulk of the collec-
tions, when it is considered that in 1883 all of the space in both build-
ings was completely filled, and in fact was so overcrowded that a third
building was already being asked of Congress, some conception may
be had of the conditions now existing. The storerooms are packed to
their utmost capacity, making it difficult to gain access to the speci-
mens or to provide adequately for their safety. For many years most
of the objects received have had to be stored in outside and unsafe
structures where they are mainly piled up in the original packing
boxes, and where has already accumulated much more than enough
material of great intrinsic and scientific value to fill a larger building
than that now occupied by the main collections.

AS A MUSEUM OF RESEARCH.

In order to permit of their examination and study, as provided in
the act of establishment, the collections of the Museum are, to the
extent of its accommodations, arranged systematically and in a manner
convenient for reference. Access to the reserve or study series, as
they are called, consisting of the main body of the collections and as
complete in all the groups as’ the accessions have made possible, is
given to all properly qualified persons engaged in original research.
Advantage of the opportunity thus afforded is widely availed of, the
Museum being visited every year by many investigators, some of
world-wide distinction, coming from the scientific centers of European
and other foreign countries as well as from all parts of the United
States. Material is occasionally sent out to representatives of other
10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

museums or laboratories having the means of providing for its safe-
keeping, this being done more particularly when they are engaged to
work up special subjects or when they desire to use the material for
comparison in connection with their own collections.

Being charged primarily with the custodianship of its collections,
the members of the scientific staff of the National Museum have com-
paratively little time during office hours for advancing knowledge,
though they are mostly well qualified for such work, being selected
with special reference to their ability to identify and classify the speci-
mens under their care in accordance with the most advanced researches,
The fact, however, that many papers descriptive of the collections are
produced each year is indicative of the industry which prevails among
the staff and of the extent to which the hours of work are prolonged.

Among the honorary officers having their laboratories at the Museum
are a number of assistants employed by other scientific bureaus to con-
duct investigations on material kept here in their charge, and in
whose results the Museum shares.

Many collections have, from time to time, been transferred by the
Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, the Department of Agricul-
ture, and other branches of the Government to the custody of the
Museum in advance of their final working up, in order to provide for
their safe storage and to secure the better facilities for study here
afforded. Under this arrangement the amount of research work
carried on in the Museum building has been greatly increased.

Though having little means to expend for field work, members of
the Museum staff are occasionally given opportunities to participate in
the explorations of other Government bureaus or of private expedi-
tions, in connection with which special researches may be carried on,
though the chief advantage results from the acquisition of new and
valuable material and a knowledge of the conditions under which it
occurred,

AS AN EDUCATIONAL MUSEUM.

The educational side of the Museum consists in the main of an exhi-
bition of all the classes of objects which it represents, so labeled that
the public may be instructed as by an encyclopedia cut apart and
spread out, except that its illustrations are real and material things.
Conceding all the space required, the principal difficulty incident to
the proper installation of such a collection is in the selection of its
parts so that while visitors may have placed before them all that is
genuinely essential, they shall not be overburdened or confused with
details. With the advance in museum methods, moreover, the objects
on display are being grouped to a greater and greater extent, to
show relationships, with, whenever possible, some added notion of
their natural environment, so that at a glance the visitor may better
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ila

comprehend their true character and significance. In this direction
the National Museum has been making conspicuous progress, and
probably now takes the lead.

‘No museum administrator had a better understanding of the public
needs than the late Doctor Goode, and none labored more earnestly and
conscientiously than he to make this a museum for, as well as of, the
people. His assistants were relied upon to arrange and maintain the
study series in a manner acceptable to the specialist, but the interests
of the public were retained in his own immediate charge. His mind
was ever occupied in devising ways for so presenting the features of
nature and the thoughts and activities of mankind that the visitor, by
the very force of his surroundings, was bound to receive and carry
with him some definite impression, some new bit of knowledge.

Doctor Goode’s labors in this field ranged from the planning of the
general scheme to the most minute details of case architecture and
fittings. His official connection with nearly all the important exposi-
tions of the past quarter of a century and his exhaustive studies of all
the principal museums of Europe and the United States gave him
exceptional opportunities for observation and experiment. Thougha
young man when he died, none other had acquired so ripe an expe-
rience and none is more worthy of being followed.

In this, as in every other activity of a live organization, change and
improvement are constant. The receipt of new material will, it is to
be expected, continue unceasingly, and every year something must
arrive in which the public has a.right to share. During the past five
years the progress made in the installation of the exhibition series has
been especially noteworthy, and now for the first time every hall
designed for public use is permanently opened, though not one is
above addition or improvement, and in some the arrangement is
entirely provisional.

An incidental, though very popular, educational feature of the
Museum, having for its purpose the promotion of scientific teaching
throughout the country, has been the distribution to schools and col-
leges of its duplicate specimens, properly identified and labeled, and
put up in carefully selected sets. Inadequate means have prevented
this measure from being carried out on the scale which the resources
of the Museum would admit of, as it requires the working over of
entire collections before the reserve and duplicate series can be sepa-
rated, and the labeling and packing take much time. Many hundreds
of these sets have been given away, but none have been prepared
recently, and the few remaining on hand at the beginning of the year
have now been disposed of.

Searcely a year passes that some exposition, either at home or
abroad, is not occupying the attention of the Museum, and through
this means its existence and aims are being brought constantly and
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

prominently before the public. These expositions have of late fol-
lowed one another so closely and have required so extensive prepara-
tion as to interfere greatly with the legitimate work of the Museum,
but the practice of introducing new and varied features, of showing a
fresh series of objects or improved groupings in connection with each
one, insures a substantial gain, as the collections are returned to Wash-
ington, besides fulfilling the important function of making museum
methods known to the people of the United States and stimulating the
growth of museums in many quarters.

The publications of the Museum may be classed, at least in a gen-
eral way, as belonging to its educational side, though they are mainly
technical, and in that respect most useful to the investigator. They
spread the work of the Museum abroad and make known the nature
and extent of its collections. The Annual Report was first printed as
a separate volume of the Smithsonian Report in 1884, and has just
reached its seventeenth volume. Besides the administrative part, it has
consisted mainly of semipopular papers on interesting portions of the
collection. Of the Proceedings, made up of technical papers of small
to moderate size, twenty-one volumes have been issued and another is
in press. The Bulletins, reserved chiefly for the larger and more
exhaustive scientific papers, number forty-nine, of which the last one
printed (Bulletin 47), a monograph of the fishes of North and Middle ©
America, is in four parts, completed near the close of the year.

PRESSING NEEDS OF THE MUSEUM.

By 1883, only two years after possession had been taken of the
present Museum building, its capacity was found to be wholly insuffi-
cient, and an estimate for a second structure of even larger size was
at once submitted to Congress. In his report for 1884, Doctor Goode
explained that it was a serious problem where to store the incoming
collections, leaving entirely out of consideration the question of their
display. The needs in this direction, always increasing, have been
urged in every subsequent report, but so far without effective result.
The Senate voted $500,000 for a new building in 1888, and again in
1890, 1892, and 1896, but all these measures failed of action in the
House.

The Museum has now reached a crisis in its history which must be
frankly met. It can no longer comply with the mandates of Congress
imposed upon it by the act of 1846 establishing the Smithsonian Insti-
tution. The two buildings which it occupies are overcrowded to the
extent that the collections they contain can only in part be arranged
and classified so as to permit of their examination as required by
law, and many of the collections are so inaccessible as to endanger
their very safety. Many hundreds of boxes, to a large extent turned
over by the Government surveys and filled with material valued at
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13

hundreds of thousands of dollars, are stacked wp in frame and cheaply
constructed brick buildings, liable at any time to destruction by fire.
There is no place where this material, composing fully one-half of the
Museum’s possessions, can be unpacked and spread out for study or
reference, while the portion suitable for exhibition would alone more
than fill another structure as large as the present Museum building.

For the existence of this condition neither the National Museum nor
the Smithsonian Institution can be held responsible. The Institution
was made the custodian of all collections belonging to the Government
in the Congressional act providing for and thus preceding its organi-
zation. It has fulfilled the obligation conscientiously and in accord-
ance with the spirit of the law, even when its own funds have had to
be drawn upon. It has shown that the trust was not misplaced, and
in the face of obstacles which have at times seemed insurmountable
has given its museum feature a standing not excelled in any country
in the world, though in accommodations and display its position is
decidedly inferior to many.

A national museum is not of the nature of a project which may
await the pleasure of summary action. Its material accumulates with
the exploration and development of the country—in the case of the
United States mainly through Congressional direction—and if the
material collected by this means be destroyed or otherwise disposed
of, the most of it can only be replaced, if at all, at greatly increased
cost. For many years this country has been supporting extensive
investigations under authority of Congress. Prominent among: the
bureaus whose work requires the collecting of specimens and their
transfer to Washington for purposes of study are the Geological Sur-
vey, the Fish Commission, the Biological Survey and the divisions of
Entomology and Botany of the Department of Agriculture, and the
Bureau of American Ethnology. <A large amount of material has
reached Washington in the past, and will certainly continue to do so,
from other Government sources, such as Army and Navy expeditions,
representatives abroad of the Department of State, the Revenue-
Marine Service, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey. These bureaus
depend by law upon the National Museum for the care of their collec-
tions. Having for the most part very inadequate accommodations in
their own buildings, much of their material is turned over as soon as
received in Washington, and thus the Museum is called upon, very
appropriately, to make greater provision for the handling and storing
of specimens than is generally supposed. This unworked material has,
in one sense, even greater value than that which has been determined
and described, as its study is expected to develop facts yet undis-
covered, and the responsibility for its safe-keeping is increased
accordingly.

The demand for additional space and for new cases, always incessant,

14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

has reached a stage where the helplessness of the authorities to meet
it is pathetic. Galleries have been built in some of the Museum halls.
Their capacity has not sufficed to keep pace with the current demands
of the years in which they were constructed, and collection after col-
lection has been carted away to one of the outside buildings. These
now are all practically filled, and next year a new one must be leased,
or accessions turned away, or the exhibition halls transformed into
storehouses.

On its educational side there is equal cause for complaint. The
public demands to see more than is now placed before it, and what is
already on display is so closely crowded as to be difficult of inspection.
As previously explained, there is much material in storage which
should be put on exhibition. In fact, a very large share of the collec-
tions can be best looked after and protected in the exposed cases of
the open halls. With its great resources, exceeding those of any
State, municipal, or private establishment, the Government is under
a moral obligation to foster and promote the educational feature of
the Museum to the fullest extent possible. Congress has acknowl-
edged this obligation from the very start, and has, perhaps, done more
in support of this object than of any other. It is the one, moreover,
which requires the most space and most expensive furnishings—the
largest item in the construction of a new building.

Laboratories of much larger size than the existing ones are required
in all the departments. This is not alone in the interest of the work
carried on by employees of the Museum. Better accommodations are
needed for the assistants from other scientific bureaus who are called
here to consult the collections, and who could to some extent carry on
their investigations much more advantageously at the Museum than
in their own buildings were proper facilities afforded them. The
wants of scientific men from other parts of the country and from
abroad, who turn to the national collections for materials for their
study, and many of whom visit Washington every year, have also to
be considered and provided for.

And finally, the shops where cases are made, where paint is stored
and mixed, where the taxidermy, modeling, and coarser preparatory
work is done, now distributed among as many outside buildings,
require to be brought together in the interest of economy and of
better administration.

As a result of its extraordinary growth under the very inadequate
provisions made for its maintenance, the National Museum has been
obliged to adapt itself to circumstances, to scatter its belongings and
its work, so that to-day its form and its administration are conditioned
by the restrictions under which it labors and not in accordance with
the best ideals, in the realization of many of which it was originally
a pioneer. The first and most urgent need is a new building, large,

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15

dignified, and accessible, with extensive halls and ample accommodations
for its collections and activities. Such a house provided, it may take
its proper place among the great museums of the world. The inter-
ests of the Government and of research will be promoted, the public
will secure its proper measure of advantages, educational establish-
ments throughout the country will be benefited, and a museum worthy
of the generous people all over the United States who have lavished
gifts upon it, of the patient toil of the many scientific men who have
given it the best years of their lives, often without hope of reward,
and of this great, prosperous, and enlightened nation will grace the
national capital.

IMPORTANT ACCESSIONS AND WORK OF THE YEAR.

The additions to the collections in the various departments aggrega-
ted considerably over 200,000 objects. The most important accession
was the so-called Marsh collection of fossil vertebrates received from
the United States Geological Survey. Its contents can not as yet be
fully determined, as the matrix still hides many of the specimens, but the
latter range from small teeth to more or less perfect skeletons weigh-
ing from 500 to 2,000 pounds apiece. The total weight of the collection
is over 80 tons, and its value, at a rough estimate, has been placed at
not less than $150,000. Another noteworthy acquisition by the Depart-
ment of Geology was the collection of minerals belonging to the late
Prof. C. U. Shepard, consisting of over 5,000 specimens, among which
are many rareties and much of historical value, including a large num-
ber of Professor Shepard’s types. The meteorite collection, which has
been increased to 742 specimens, now ranks among the largest in the
world, while in the field of paleobotany the National Museum has
become the center of systematic work.

Dr. William L. Abbott, in continuation of many past favors, has con-
tributed nearly 1,200 specimens of mammals, birds, and batrachians,
besides a large quantity of material in other groups, the results of his
explorations among the islands of the China Sea, and in Trong, Lower
Siam, and Singapore. Other large and valuable additions have been
the birds, mollusks, insects, and plants of the E. H. Harriman Alaskan
Expedition; the unique collection of spiders belonging to the late Dr.
George Marx; many birds from Hawaii and Colombia; large numbers
of bats from the West Indian region; and fishes from both sides of
the Pacific Ocean.

The additions to the herbarium numbered over 27,000 specimens,
mainly from the Southern and Western States, Alaska, Mexico, and
Europe.

In anthropology over 33,716 objects were received, among them
many of great scientific and historical value. A large number of these
16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

were obtained through the instrumentality of the Bureau of American
Ethnology.

Following are some of the more important changes in connection
with the exhibition series: The gallery in the northeast court has been
newly furnished with ebonized cases of elegant design, in which the
collection of ceramics, together with other works in glass, lacquer,
and metal, has been installed with very effective results. The Indian
basketry collection, one of the finest now in existence, has been
arranged, with the ethnological exhibits from Latin America, in the
corresponding gallery of the northwest court. The display in the hall
containing the Catlin paintings and the Indian groups has been as
nearly completed as the material on hand permits, while the medical
exhibit has been entirely revised, and many additions and readjust-
ments have been made in the Hall of History.

The south or Mammal Hall has been partly refitted with large cases,
and its contents rearranged, the American species being retained on
the floor, while those from other countries have been transferred to
the new gallery above. In this hall are displayed, in several groups,
some of the finest examples of taxidermic work ever produced. The
floor space of the south east range has been entirely given over to the
exhibition of fishes, reptiles, and batrachians, and the reorganization
of the bird collection in the Smithsonian building, chiefly through a
reduction in the number of specimens displayed, has been nearly
finished. The lighting by electricity of the cases in the central quad-
rangle of the latter hall, containing bright-plumaged birds, has resulted
satisfactorily, bringing into use what has practically been a large waste
space.

The systematic exhibition series in practical geology, occupying the
gallery of the southwest court, has been essentially completed.
Important changes have been made in the collections illustrating the
building stones and mineral resources of the United States, and good
progress is to be noted in the installation of invertebrate fossils. Sev-
eral striking special exhibits of geological structure and phenomena
have also been added.

The total number of persons who visited the exhibition halls during

the year was 225,440 for the Museum building and 133,147 for the
Smithsonian building, an average daily attendance of 720 at the former
and of 425 at the latter.

The principal researches completed, or in which marked progress
was made during the year by assistants of the Museum, have related
to mammals, birds, insects, mollusks, crustaceans, plants, and certain
branches of ethnology and geology. Reference should especially be
made to a monograph by Mr. Robert Ridgway on the Birds of North
and Middle America, on which he has been engaged for several years.
The first volume is nearly ready for printing, and several additional
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 17

volumes will be required to complete the work. Specimens in greater
or less number have been sent for study to the representatives of over
twenty prominent museums and universities in different parts of the
United States.

More of the Museum staff than usual were in the field, the duration
of their absence from Washington varying from two or three weeks
to as many months. Mr. William H. Dall, Mr. Robert Ridgway,
Dr. C. Hart Merriam, and Mr. F. V. Coville accompanied the Harri-
man Alaskan Expedition. Mr. Leonhard Stejneger, Dr. Charles W.
Richmond, Mr. William Palmer, and Mr. J. H. Riley visited Cuba
and Porto Rico in the interest of the Pan-American Exposition. The
whale fishery of Newfoundland was investigated by Dr. Frederick W.
True, and the anthropology of Cuba and Jamaica by Mr. William H.
Holmes. Collections of plants were made in Mexico by Dr. J. N.
Rose and Dr. Walter Hough; of vertebrates in Venezuela by Mr.
Marcus W. Lyon, jr.; of fishes in the Vineyard Sound region of
Massachusetts by Mr. Barton A. Bean, and of fossils in Wyoming by
Mr. Charles Schuchert and Dr. Lester F. Ward.

From the appropriation of $300,000 made by Congress for the Gov-
ernment exhibit at the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 $50,000
have been allotted to the use of the Smithsonian Institution and its
bureaus. Before the close of the year the plans for the display by
the Museum had been practically settled, and considerable progress
had been made in bringing the necessary collections together and in
starting the work of preparing them.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900.

By Wiuuiam H. Homes,
Head Curator.

ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL.

The organization of the department has remained practically un-
changed during the year.

Owing to the lack of space in the exhibition halls, the Division of
Somatology and several sections are not represented in the exhibition
series, and numerous other branches are but meagerly shown.

The only change made in the personnel of the anthropological staff
was the assignment of Mr. Paul Beckwith, of the clerical force, to
the duties of aid in the Division of History and Biography. Mr. Beck-
with’s services are also utilized in the Section of Coins and Medals.

The death of Mr. A. Zeno Shindler, a preparator in the department,
occurred during the year. Mr. Shindler had been attached to the
Smithsonian Institution and Museum for twenty-five years or more,
doing excellent service as a painter of ethnological portraits and in
coloring casts in the Department of Biology as well as that of
Anthropology.

DEPARTMENT OFFICES.

During previous years the offices occupied by members of the staff
of the department were much scattered and, in the main, not conve-
niently situated with respect to the exhibition halls. Recently, how-
ever, the roomy west portal of the Museum building has been remodeled
as an office for the head curator, while the adjoining rooms on the
north and south have been fitted up as department laboratories and
utilized largely for receiving and distributing collections. The office
of the curator of the Division of Ethnology connects with this suite
on the south, and the department recorder occupies a room on the
north. On the floor above are five small rooms, occupied by assistant
curators, aids, and preparators. Rooms requiring it have been con-
nected by means of speaking tubes, and a telephone has been intro-
duced into one of the laboratories, greatly facilitating the transaction
of business. All of these rooms have been renovated and repaired
during the year. The several honorary members of the staff occupy,

21
22 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

of necessity, offices at points convenient to the work in which they are
primarily engaged. A sectional library has been established in the
office of the head curator, which is intended to be supplied with such
general reference works as may not be available for the several
divisions and sections.

EXHIBITION CASES.

Little progress was made during the year in the direction of
increased or improved facilities for installation. The handsome ehon-
ized wall case, 64 feet in length and 9 feet in height, built in the gal-
lery of the northeast court during the previous year, has been fitted
up with shelving, and the ceramic collections, together with numerous
works in glass, lacquer, and metal, have been installed in it. This
case, built by the Museum mechanics, is probably not surpassed any-
where for beauty, convenience, and mechanical perfection. Much
attention has been given to the reassemblage and fitting up of cases
already in use, and the furniture of the department presents a much
more creditable appearance than at any previous period.

IMPORTANT ACCESSIONS.

A considerable number of collections acquired during the year are
worthy of special mention, as follows: .

By gift.—\. Ethnological material from the Malay Archipelago,
donated by Dr. William L. Abbott; 67 specimens.

2. Two ancient stone chairs from Ecuador, presented by Hon. Perry
M. de Leon, United States consul-general at Guayaquil. These valu-
able specimens were discovered about thirty years ago as the result of

C. H. Russell, surgeon U. 8. 8. Newark.

4. The Ramage printing press, presented by Barnhart Bros. &
Spindler, of Chicago, Ill. This press marks the change in the hand
press from wood construction to iron. It is said to have been made
mast 5:

5. A series of 32 insulated electrical conductors, presented by the
American Electrical Works, of Providence, R. I.

6. Two typewriting machines, presented by the Hammond Type-
writer Company, New York. One of these machines is of the model
first made by the company, in 1884, and the other is of the latest style,
made in 1900.

CARE OF COLLECTIONS.

During the past year, and during the two preceding years as well,
there was a constant shifting and reshifting of the collections, resulting _
from reclassification and the demand of additional material for instal-
lation. Instructive and valuable specimens have been selected and
placed on exhibition and less important material has been placed in
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 25

storage. The effort has been to constantly improve the condition and
enhance the usefulness of the collections. The task of destroying
moths and other injurious insects has been faithfully performed by
Mr. Joseph Palmer, preparator, who is able to report the rare occur-
rence of these pests among the collections of the department. The
work of poisoning is begun at once upon the arrival of specimens and
is generally completed before assignment is made to the divisions and
sections. The extensive basketry collection has been thoroughly
cleaned and treated with preservatives, and other articles requiring it
have been treated in like manner. Poisoned specimens are specially
tagged or marked, and a card catalogue recording dates and kind of
treatment is kept.
STORAGE.

A great body of material belonging to the collection is in storage
in the Smithsonian Institution, in the Museum, and in three outbuild-
ings. During the year the head curator undertook the task of exam-
ining all of this storage material, the object being to determine its
nature and availability for exhibition. He was made chairman of a com-
mittee by the executive curator and was instructed to investigate the
entire storage material of the Museum. A force of from six to ten
men was employed for six weeks in this work. The storage material
has been accumulating for twenty-five years without full separation of
the various classes of collections and with but meager records. The
multitude of crates, boxes, and uncased objects was gotten out and
classified. The anthropological property was segregated by divisions
and sections, and a card catalogue was made enumerating briefly the
contents of each package. The same information was placed upon the
packages which are so arranged that the labels are visible and so they
can be removed with a minimum of labor. Up to date the catalogue
contains 711 cards. In addition, there is a large body of collections
mounted in glass covered unit boxes for exposition use. This mateyial
is now stacked in the storage buildings.

CATALOGUING.

The routine for the reception, distribution, and cataloguing of col-
lections is given in last year’s report. The work of the head curator’s
office and of each division and section has been conducted according to
the plan laid down in that report, and the results seem to be entirely
satisfactory. In writing the present report the head curator has
assembled on his desk the following data: The department’s books
recording accessions, permanent and temporary, for the year; the card
catalogue of accessions; the card catalogue of collections for the year
from all the divisions and sections; the card catalogue of storage; the
card catalogue of exchanges; the card catalogue of articles poisoned
26 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

or otherwise treated, and a card catalogue of articles, such as models
and casts, made for the Museum by preparators or other persons
employed by the Museum. At the same time a detailed report of the
operations of each division and section for the year is in the hands of
the head curator, who is able, through these various sources of infor-
mation, to understand and summarize the work of the year with much
ease and satisfaction.

INSTALLATION.

The year has witnessed very decided progress in the work of instal-
lation, the divisions of Ethnology, Technology, History, and Medicine,
and the sections of Graphic Arts and Ceramics having made most
gratifying headway. Prof. O. T. Mason reports, for the Division of
Ethnology, that the cases in the west north range are so fully installed
and labeled that this room may be considered to fall little short of
completion. During the year the force of the division has been partly
engaged in installing collections in the gallery of the northwest court.
On the east side of this gallery there are cases containing typical
exhibits of basketry from all parts of the world. On the north side
the series of rail cases shows the types of California basketry, while
in the wall cases a series of baskets is shown representing various
tribes from British Columbia to Mexico. On the south and west
sides of this gallery are exhibits of ethnological materials of Latin
America, beginning with Sonora on the north and ending with Tierra
del Fuego on the south.

The honorary curator of the Division of Mechanical Technology,
Dr. J. E. Watkins, reports that important improvements in the
installation of the Section of Land Transportation have been made.
The base and iron rail of the locomotive ‘‘ John Bull” have been com-
pleted. The ox cart from New Mexico and the Red River cart have
been placed on a new mahogany base and installed with other wheeled
vehicles. The large wooden models of the locomotives ‘*Tom Thumb”
and ‘** Arabian” have been removed to storage, and small models are
being made to take their place in the exhibit. The original driving
wheels of the locomotives ‘‘ John Bull” and ‘‘ De Witt Clinton” and
several other antique car wheels have been permanently installed on
the piers within the hall. The boiler of the locomotive ‘* Stour-
bridge Lion” has been fitted with wooden axles and mounted on its
wheels. It is hoped that additional parts of this locomotive may be
secured, so that it may, in time, be restored to approximately its origi-
nal condition.

The curator of the Division of Prehistoric Archeology, Dr. Thomas _
Wilson, mentions in his report the very obvious fact that the exhibi- ,
tion cases of the division are overcrowded. With every accession of
importance he is compelled to condense the exhibits in order to make
—

room. During the year the work of segregating various exhibition
units has been continued, but it is not deemed advisable to begin the
radical change of installation so manifestly called for until extensive
improvements are made in the hall.

Mr. A. H. Clark, honorary custodian of the Section of American
History, states that very satisfactory progress has been made in the
care of the collections of that section. Additional cases have been
introduced into the north hall and the rotunda, and various rearrange-
ments of cases and exhibits have been made. The contents of many
cases have been reclassified and installation has been perfected. The
superb collection of personal relics of Admiral George Dewey, depos-
ited during the year, has been installed in cases near the Museum
entrance. During the year it has been necessary to send numerous
exhibits to storage. Increased exhibition room for this section is
very much needed.

A complete reinstallation of the exhibits included in the Division of
Medicine has been made during the year by the honorary curator,
Medical Director J. M. Flint, United States Navy. The cases have
been arranged in alcove style, thus giving a passageway of proper
width along the gallery. Included with the collections of this division
are two cases containing exhibits designed to illustrate the composi-
tion of the human body.

Noteworthy improvements have been made in the installation of the
Section of Graphic Arts. Mr. Paul Brockett has conducted this work
under the immediate supervision of the head curator. Two cases have
been added, one containing series of exhibits illustrating the history
of the book, and the other, examples of modern binding; the latter
exhibit is lent by Miss E. R. Scidmore.

The Section of Ceramics has been assigned to the northeast court
gallery, which has been fitted up with excellent cases. Early in the
year the collections of ceramics, glass, lacquer, bronze, etc., were
installed here by the head curator, the arrangement being primarily
by countries and secondarily by varieties or factories.

LABELING.

The important work of labeling the collections of the department is
progressing satisfactorily. The system of case labeling adopted dur-
ing the preceding year, and described in the report for that year, has
been successfully applied, and many labels are already in place. The
printing of labels for several halls is now going forward, and minor
labels have been prepared in large numbers by the various curators.
As soon as the work of labeling is reasonably complete and the instal-
lation satisfactory, it is planned to prepare a key or guide to the col-
lections of the department.
28 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.
FIELD WORK.

The department has not been able to carry on extensive field work
during the year. The explorations of Dr. Walter Hough, made in
connection with an expedition conducted by Dr. J. }., Rose, of the
Division of Botany, were mentioned in the report of last year, although
not completed until August of the present year. The collections made
are of very considerable scientific value, including, as they do, many
plants used in the native arts, ancient and modern, besides numerous
specimens of native handiwork. During the year Mr. C. H. Town-
send returned from his voyage on the A/batross, bringing a large col-
lection of ethnological specimens from the Pacific islands, and Dr.
W. H. Abbott, continuing his explorations in the Malay Archipelago,
has forwarded many objects of interest. Col. H. H. Hilder, of the
Bureau of American Ethnology, has visited the Philippines, collecting
for the Pan-American Exposition, and reports the shipment of much
material that will finally enrich the Museum. Maj. J. W. Powell and
Mr. W. H. Holmes spent three months in Cuba and Jamaica, securing
valuable collections of relics illustrating the ancient peoples of these
islands.

RESEARCHES.

The curators of the department have found time, aside from their
duties as custodians of the collections, to engage in important researches
based largely, as usual, on the national collections. The head curator
has continued his studies relating to aboriginal pottery, to the evidences
of auriferous gravel man in California, and to antiquities of Mexico.
The curator of ethnology has made progress toward completing his
monograph on American aboriginal zootechny, and has made a careful
study of the recently received Hudson collection of California basketry.
The assistant curator of ethnology has continued his studies in heating
and illumination, and has prepared a manuscript on the primitive
stages of illumination, covering the use of the torch and the candle.
He has also pointed out the connection between Mexico and the Phil-
ippines with relation to the introduction of plants and industries from
Mexico to the Philippines and from the Philippines to Mexico.

The curator of prehistoric archeology has made further progress in
his studies relating to primitive trepannation, working experimentally
with primitive utensils upon various specimens of human crania. He
has also been interested in the discovery of the truth with respect
to allegations that prehistoric man was ambidextrous, studying the
statistics furnished by our Indian schools and the rich collections of his
division.

The curator of the Division of Religions has completed an illus-
trated catalogue of the Benguiat collection of Jewish ceremonial
objects.
a0

oo Ve

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 29

The curator of the Division of Mechanical Technology has been
prosecuting researches in various sections of this division, and Mr.
G. C. Maynard, aid, continues his studies with respect to the electrical
collections.

The extensive collections of the department naturally form the
basis of study in many branches of research. Students are made
welcome at all times, and not a few have availed themselves of the
facilities offered. Mr. Foster Jennings, Rev. Dr. W. E. Griffis, Mr.
W. H. Patton, Mr. J. D. McGuire, and Mr. E. Quesada have pursued
investigations in the Divisions of Ethnology and Somatology. Mr.
Frank Calvert, Prof. F. B. Tarbell, and Mr. Willard Nye, jr., have
consulted the collections in prehistoric archeology, and Mr. Franklin
W. Smith and the Association for the Study of Comparative Religions
have pursued investigations in the Division of Religions. Scientific
and numerous nonscientific writers engaged in the preparation of
matter for periodicals and newspapers have found the department a
profitable field.

LOANS.

It is not usual to lend collections to students desiring to study them
outside of the Museum, save in cases where loss or injury is not immi-
nent. In several instances, however, articles have been turned over
to the Bureau of American Ethnology, and a few loans have been
made to museums. A collection of Shoshone and Ute crania was for-
warded to the American Museum of Natural History at the request of
Prof. F. W. Putnam. These were studied by Dr. A. Hrdlicka, and
returned in good order. A number of games have also been loaned
to the museum of the University of Pennsylvania for the use of Mr.
Stewart Culin. Numerous model. belonging to the Section of Trans-
portation were loaned to the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburg, Pa., in
order that copies of them might be made for that institution. A col-
lection of electrical apparatus numbering 56 specimens was loaned to
the American Commissioner-General for the Paris Exposition.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900.

By Freperick W. TRUE,

Head Curator.

The past year has been one of unusual activity in several of the
divisions, and a number of important advances have been made. It
has been marked also by the beginning of preparations for the Pan-
American Exposition, which opens at Buffalo, N. Y., in May, 1901.

IMPROVEMENT OF EXHIBITION HALLS.

In the Division of Mammals a plan for improving the housing of
the exhibition series, worked out last year, was carried into effect. A
large case, 91 feet long and 9 feet deep, was built along the east wall
of the south hall, and in it were placed all the North American car-
nivores. This allowed the removal of the unsightly temporary case
containing the seals from the center of the hall, and the placing of the
groups of bison and moose, the finest zoological groups the Museum
possesses, in a better light. The present arrangement of cases is
shown on the following page.

The large cast and skeleton of a humpback whale, which was for
many years suspended from the roof in this hall, was removed to the
adjoining osteological hall, replacing a skeleton of the same species
formerly exhibited there. This change has improved the lighting in
the south hall, as the cast formerly obstructed the light from the
main south window.

An important change was, after full consideration, made in the
south east range, occupied last year jointly by the exhibits of reptiles
and of fishes and a part of the mammal collections of the Biological
Survey of the Department of Agriculture. The range was completely
floored over at the level of the gallery, dividing the hall into an upper
and lower story. The mammal collections referred to were transferred
to the upper story, leaving the ground floor entirely free for exhibi-
tion purposes, a decided advantage both as to increase of space and
improvement of appearance.

31
32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

As the old wooden floor could not be replaced at once by a stone
pavement, it was thought best not to attempt a rearrangement and
extension of the exhibition series of reptiles, batrachians, and fishes

until next year.

U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, SOUTH HALL—AMERICAN MAMMALS.

No important change has taken place in the Hall of Comparative
Anatomy, but the introduction of skylights in the roof of this hall has
increased the amount of light.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 33

The flooring over of the south east range, already mentioned, made it
possible to extend the laboratory of the Division of Plants. New dust-
tight cases were built for the herbarium and placed in the second story
of the range, which they occupy jointly with the mammal collections of
the Department of Agriculture. A row of skylights in the roof over
these cases gives abundance of light.

The work of reorganizing the exhibition series of birds in the main
hall of the Smithsonian building, which was begun last year, has been
completed, except in so far as regards labeling. The old wooden floor
in this hall was replaced by one of stone and cement (terrazzo) at the
beginning of the year and a plan was adopted for lighting the center
of the hall, formerly almost totally dark, by artificial means. New
cases with large glass were provided for the four spaces about the
entrance, styled ‘* the quadrangle,” and in them have been placed spe-
cial exhibits of birds of more than ordinary interest, such as the birds
of paradise, parrots, hornbills, etc. The cases are lighted by incan-
descent electric lamps, provided with hoods and reflectors. The result
of these changes is that this section of the hall, formerly unfit for
exhibition -purposes, is now one of the most attractive points in the
building. The reduction in the number of birds exhibited has relieved
the congested condition of the cases, and makes it possible to view each
specimen satisfactorily. The cases themselves are old and not as free
from dust as could be wished, but otherwise the improvement effected
may be considered to have amply repaid the labor involved. A con-
siderable amount of relabeling remains to be done, and better provision
made for the bird groups and the collections of eggs and nests.

A series of enlarged illustrations of Rotifers was added to the new
exhibition series of lower invertebrates during the year. In the
North American series the groups remaining to be represented are
the parasitic and nonparasitic worms and the polyzoa and certain of
the crustacea.

No opportunity was found during the year to reorganize the exhib-
its of insects and of plants, and no important changes were made in
the exhibition series of mollusks. The osteological exhibit, as stated
in a previous report, is as full as can be accommodated in the present
quarters.

EXPLORATIONS.

The extensive collecting operations of Dr. W. L. Abbott, who gen-
erously donates the fruit of his labors to the Museum, continued
during the year.

The activities of the scientific bureaus of the Government, involv-
ing the acquisition of natural history specimens, vary from year to
year. During the past vear, as in many years preceding, the opera-
tions of the United States Fish Commission resulted in Jarge additions
to the Museum.

NAT Mus 1900——3
34 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

A new source of increment has been found in the willingness of
observers of the Weather Bureau, especially those in the West Indies,
to collect material desired by the Museum.

Purchases were more frequent during the past year than formerly,
and the success in filling important gaps in various series was most
gratifying. Indeed, the zoological collections have reached the stage
where means to supply definite deficiencies by expenditure of money
isa matter of the greatest importance. Not less important, and pro-
moting the same end, is the employment of trained collectors to visit
localities selected for specific reasons. During the past year several
such. opportunities were taken advantage of with most beneficial
results.

While the Museum has never been in a position financially to main-
tain extensive field operations, members of the scientific staff have
nearly every year made collections of more or less magnitude. Sev-
eral such enterprises were entered into last year. In addition, oppor-
tunities occur, from time to time, to accompany field parties under
private auspices. Several members of the scientific staff joined the
Harriman Alaska Expedition by invitation of Mr. Edw. H. Harriman.
At the close of the year, Mr. M. W. Lyon, jr., was detailed to accom-
pany Lieut. Wirt Robinson, U. 8. A., to Venezuela.

During the summer of 1899 Messrs. J. N. Rose and Walter Hough
were engaged for three months in a botanical expedition in central
and southern Mexico. They visited numerous places where collections
bad been made previously, and obtained many plants from type locali-
ties, not a few of which were not represented in the herbarium,
besides numerous undescribed species.

Mr. B. A. Bean pursued ichthyological investigations for the
Museum in Edgartown Harbor, Massachusetts, and obtained an excel-
lent series of fishes for the collection.

The head curator spent some weeks, by the favor of the Cabot Steam
Whaling Company, at their station in Newfoundland, where he had
admirable opportunities to study fresh examples of finback and hump-
back whales.

ACCESSIONS.

The accessions of the year compare favorably in scientific importance
with those of preceding years, but were somewhat less numerous than
in 1898-99.

Accessions to the collections are received from a great variety of
sources, among which the donations of numerous friends and corre-
spondents of the Smithsonian Institution are conspicuous.

Dr. W. L. Abbott, whose name is associated in these reports with
so many valuable donations, presented large zoological collections dur-
ing the year from the islands of the China Sea, from Trong, Lower
Siam, and Singapore. These collections comprised no iess than 257
)

mammals, 763 birds, and 125 batrachians, together with insects and
other invertebrates. They are of great interest to the Museum, since
they contain many species new to science, as well as a variety of
others previously unrepresented here. Their value for scientific pur-
poses is much enhanced by the accurate and thorough manner in which
they are labeled by Dr. Abbott.

While with the Harriman Alaska expedition Mr. Ridgway obtained
over 300 birds and Mr. Dall collected a considerable number of inter-
esting mollusks. The collection of insects presented by Mr. Harriman
numbers over 4,000 specimens, and is probably the largest and most
complete collection of Alaska insects ever brought together. It con-
tains many new forms and a large series of species from boreal
America not previously represented in the Museum. The collecting

as done by Mr. Trevor Kincaid, of the University of Washington.

Sir Charles Eliot, British Samoan commissioner, presented to the
Museum an excellent series of shells and naked mollusks, and a large
number of other invertebrates, which he collected in Samoa.

The zoological collectors sent out by the Institution in the interest
of the Pan-American Exposition to Cuba and Porto Rico obtained a
large amount of interesting material. Doctors Stejneger and Richmond
collected 250 birds, 549 reptiles and batrachians, 126 bats, and a quan-
tity of insects, crustaceans, earthworms, and other specimens. Messrs.
J. H. Riley and William Palmer in Cuba, at the close of the year, had
collected 509 bats, 298 birds, 209 reptiles and batrachians, a large
number of fishes, more than 1,700 insects, besides other invertebrates,
and plants and specimens of other kinds.

The most important purchase of the year was the Goodfellow collec-
tion of humming birds, comprising about 1,200 specimens. Many
species are represented by series of from 10 to 20 skins. The skins

are admirably prepared and very fully labeled. A large number of

the species was previously unrepresented in the collection.

Another purchase of importance was the Marx collection of spiders,
containing several thousand syecimens, chiefly North American, and
including numerous types and co-types of described species.

An especially noteworthy specimen obtained this vear was the skel-
eton of the recently-discovered Marsupial Mole, Votoryctes, which was
received in exchange from the University College, Dundee.

Endeavors to add to the Museum collection of bats have been very
successful. Mr. Ernest T. Giers presented 88 specimens from the
island of Trinidad. Lieut. J. W. Daniel, jr., presented 46 specimens
from Cuba; 196 specimens from Curacao were purchased from Mr.
Leon J. Guthrie. Mr. P. McDonough presented 29 specimens from
the Barbados, and Mr. L. M. McCormick presented 17 specimens
from the Philippine Islands. In addition, the collectors for the Pan-
American Exposition (as above stated) obtained 126 specimens in Porto

Rico and 509 in Cuba. Altogether, therefore, over 1,000 specimens

of bats have been added during the year.
36 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

Two collections of European mammals, comprising 185 specimens,
were purchased. The proprietors of Forepaugh and Sells Brothers’
shows presented an African rhinoceros which died in their menagerie.

Skeletons of the aye-aye, potto, and a porpoise (Veomer?s) were pur-
chased, and skeletons of a guanaco and a spotted hyena were obtained
from the National Zoological Park.

Among birds a very interesting addition was the skeleton of Harris’s
cormorant, receivedin exchange from Leland Stanford Junior Univer-
sity. It is at present the only known skeleton of this rare species.
A valuable collection of Hawaiian birds, containing about 500 speci-
mens, was purchased from Mr. H. W. Henshaw. Mr. Outram Bangs -
presented a collection of about 300 Colombian and Panama birds.
From Maj. W. A. Glassford, U. S. A., was received a specimen of
the Cuban Macaw (Ara tricolor), which is now believed to be extinct.
Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. A., presented a number of reptiles which he
collected in Texas.

An excellent collection of Japanese fishes, including the types of
14 new forms, was presented by the Leland Stanford Junior Univer-
sity, through Dr. David S$. Jordan. These were supplemented by col-
lections from the same region transmitted by the Fish Commission,
together with Alaskan, Hawaiian, and Californian fishes. A collection
of fishes of the Red Sea, in an especially fine state of preservation, and
also fishes of the Mediterranean, were obtained from the Museo Civico,
Milan, Italy. New Zealand fishes were obtained from the Public
Museum at Wanganui.

Mr. Barton A. Bean made a collection of fishes in the vicinity of
Woods Hole, Mass., in which were included the young of a number of
southern forms not previously found so far north.

Among mollusks the most interesting addition was a fine collection
of some 800 specimens of South Australian shells received in exchange
from Walter D. Reed, esq., of Adelaide. A small series of rare shells
was received from the Bishop Memorial Museum, Honolulu, and Mr.
Dall also presented specimens collected by himself in the Hawaiian
Islands.

A valuable series of land shells from the Galapagos Islands was
received from the Leland Stanford Junior University, and the Museum
series is now probably unsurpassed. Rare land shells from the
Hawaiian Islands were presented by Mrs. Henrietta D. Walcott, of
Dedham, Mass. Mr. B. H. Wright, of Penn Yan, N. Y., continued
his generous donations of type specimens of river mussels (Naiades)
from the South and West.

Many fine shells have been added to the Pacific coast series by cor-
respondents in California, among whom should be mentioned Mrs. T.
S. Oldroyd, Prof. F. W. Kelsey, and Hon. Delos Arnold.
/
;

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 37

The additions to the collections of insects and arachnida and myria-
poda were very extensive, numbering no less than 85,000 specimens.

‘Mention has already been made of the Marx collection of spiders
and of Dr. Abbott’s donations. Mr. Hugo Soltau presented a large
collection of coleoptera. Mr. EK. A. Schwarz continued to make
important additions to the Hubbard and Schwarz collection. Large
numbers of insects were received from the New Mexico Agricultural
College, through Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell, including many types and
co-types of species described by Professor Cockerell. Prof. John B.
Smith presented types of various species of Noctuid described by
him. Collections of Mexican hymenoptera and South American lepi-
doptera were purchased. Co-types of species described by Doctor
Horn were received from the California Academy of Sciences.

The Department of Agriculture transmitted a collection of insects
from Porto Rico collected by Mr. August Busck.

A large collection of crustaceans from the coast of Brazil, obtained
by the Branner-Agassiz Expedition of 1899, was presented by Dr. J.
C. Branner. Dr. C. H. Eigenmann presented cotypes of an Isopod
crustacean from Izel’s Cave, Texas. Dr. C. A. Kofoid presented
co-types of a new genus of Volvocide, and Rey. George W. Taylor
co-types of two species of British Columbia sponges. Mr. H. W.
Henshaw presented a number of crustaceans from the Hawaiian
Islands. Crustaceans collected in Texas and Mexico were received
from the biological survey of the Department of Agriculture. Corals
and crustaceans collected in Porto Rico were received from the United
States Fish Commission.

The additions to» the herbarium were very extensive, exceeding
27,000 specimens. Two large donations deserve special mention. Dr.
Charles Mohr, of Mobile, Ala., an enthusiastic botanist and collector,
presented to the Institution his herbarium of more than 3,000 speci-
mens, chiefly from the southern United States. As the national her-
barium was previously deficient in plants from the South, Dr. Mohr’s
contribution was especially acceptable. Of similar importance was
the donation of the De Chalmot collection of 3,000 plants, from the
United States and Europe, by Mrs. Marie De Chalmot, of Holecombs
Rock, Va. In the same connection should be mentioned the gift of
about 1,100 plants, chiefly from the United States, by Mr. A. H. Cur-
tiss, of Jacksonville, Fla.

Extensive series from Porto Rico, Mexico, the District of Colum-
bia, the Yellowstone National Park, the Pribilof Islands, Canada,
Jamaica, and the New England States were purchased, and collections
from Montana, Central America, and the Philippine Islands were
obtained by exchange.

Dr. J. N. Rose, while pursuing botanical investigations in Mexico,
collected some 1,200 specimens for the Museum.
38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

The Department of Agriculture transmitted 2,500 Alaskan plants
collected by Mr. F. V. Coville and Mr. T. H. Kearney, 2,300 speci-
mens from Virginia and North Carolina collected by Mr. Kearney,
and 807 specimens from the State of Washington collected by Mr.
Kirk Whited. The United States Geological Survey transmitted 413
plants from Oregon.

STUDY COLLECTIONS.

In the Division of Mammals satisfactory progress was made in
re-arranging the study collections of rodents, insectivores, and bats,
comprising several thousand specimens, and the work of remodeling
skins for study purposes was continued for about five months. The
majority of these small skins are now in excellent condition. The col-
lection of skins of large mammals is still in confusion owing to lack of
proper case room.

The curator of the Division of Birds having been detailed for work
on the manuscript of his Manual of the Birds of North and Middle
America, and the assistant curator having been in the West Indies for
some months, little was accomplished in this division beyond the
re-arrangement of the exhibition series, already referred to, and the
performance of routine work. The great study collection of birds is,
however, in a very satisfactory condition except that portion which is
still in old-style cases. Before this can be put in order some eighteen
half-unit cases must be provided, for which funds have not been
available thus far.

The curator of the Division of Comparative Anatomy and assistant
were occupied very largely with work on vertebrate fossils, especially’
with the transfer of the Marsh collections from New Haven. ‘This,
and the necessity of re-arranging the exhibition hall, left little time for
other than routine work. ‘The condition of the vipa collections
is satisfactory.

Mr. Dall, honorary curator of the Division of ‘Molluscs reports as
follows: :

Progress in the revision of the study series is naturally slow but constant. All the
reserve material is accessible and in order. Anything in the collection can be found
in a few minutes and the genera are catalogued on cards which refer to their location
in the cases. The whole duplicate collection is in first-class order and catalogued on
cards. The unadministered alcoholics are catalogued by genera on cards and located
so that any jar can be found at once.

In the Division of Marine Invertebrates the study collection of dry
specimens of sea urchins was overhauled and arranged systematically
for more convenient reference. The collection of worms was trans-
ferred to a room in the north tower of the Smithsonian building.

Regarding the study collection of insects, Doctor Howard, honorar y
curator, reports as follows:
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 39

The collections are in excellent condition, and totally free from museum pests.
During April and May all the cabinets and boxes were examined for museum pests,
and not a specimen was found infested. It is the first year in the history of the
division that such a state of affairs has existed, and this is due principally to the fact
that a large percentage of the insects is now permanently arranged in the new stand-
ard insect drawers. :

The identification of species and the frequent rearrangement of the different orders
still continues. Most of the orders are now arranged more or less satisfactorily,
except the exotic material. The exotic material, particularly in the orders Rhyn-
chota, Orthoptera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, is only partially arranged and
identified, and it will take many months, if not two or three years, before all can be
satisfactorily arranged and identified.

Doctor Dyar has done much work on the Lepidoptera, Mr. Schwarz on the Coleop-
tera, Mr. Coquillett on the Diptera, Mr. Ashmead on the Hymenoptera, Mr. Banks
on the Arachnida, Mr. Currie on some of the Neuropteroid insects, particularly on
the Odonata and Myrmeleonidee, and Mr. Heidemann on some families in the Rhyn-
chota.

The order Orthoptera, especially the exotic material, is almost entirely unarranged.

Reference has already been made to the improvements in the botan-
ical laboratory. The following statement by Mr. F. V. Coville,
honorary curator of the Division of Plants, explains more fully the
character and extent of these changes, as well as the progress of
routine work during the year:

During the past year the gallery of the south east range has been extended over the
center court and about 1,200 square feet have been added to our floor space. This
has enabled us to transfer the cases which were temporarily placed on the exhibition
gallery to permanent quarters as well as to make room for some new cases. After
considerable experimenting a very satisfactory case was planned and eighty new
cases have been made and put in place. Each case contains four rows of six pigeon-
holes, each of the standard size. In addition to the usual doors which fit against
felt strips, a second set of doors can be added. These are only to be used during the
process of fumigating.

The new cases are stacked in nine double rows, the alternate double rows being
two cases high, while the other are one case high. These low cases furnish an
abundance of table room either for the distribution of specimens into the cases or as
a convenient place for the critical examination of plants. Above these table cases
five skylights have just been added, which furnish an abundance of light and suitable
ventilation.

During the year the entire collection has been transferred to zinc-lined cases and
poisoned with carbon bisulphide. While this work has been done as carefully as
possible, yet it requires a great deal of time and is more or less injurious to the plants.
In spite of this care, I regret to say, after the specimens are returned to their proper
places in the herbarium, the ravages of the insects are still considerable.

Three preparators have been engaged in mounting and labeling specimens during
the year. The total number of specimens mounted is 24,049 against 22,559 last year.
Nearly all of these have been stamped and incorporated into the general herbarium.

The marking of all accessions with a uniform stamp was begun in
1895, and 76,030 sheets had been stamped at the close of the year coy-
ered by this report.
40) REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

RESEARCHES AND PUBLICATIONS.

The present year saw the completion of Jordan and Evermann’s
elaborate manual of the Fishes of North and Middle America, which
constitutes Bulletin 47 of the National Museum. ‘The companion work
on birds by Mr. Robert Ridgway progressed favorably and the manu-
script of the first volume was very nearly ready for the printer at the
close of the year. The first installment of completed manuscript,
about 250 pages, was submitted. A paper on the birds of Trong,
Lower Siam, collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott, was begun by Dry.
Charles Richmond.

Mr. B. A. Bean engaged in the study of the fishes of New York,
Woods Hole, Mass., and the District of Columbia, and also determined
the fishes collected by Mr. J. B. Hatcher in Patagonia.

A revision of the two great groups of bivalve mollusks, the Telli-
nid and Cardiide, including their classification and a review of the
American species, recent and Tertiary, was completed during the year
by Mr. William H. Dall. Over 100 new forms, recent and fossil, were
detected and described.

Mr. Simpson completed his revision of the Naiades, or river mussels,
a work which represents many years of arduous study, and may be
considered the most important contribution to the subject since the
appearance of Doctor Lea’s last synopsis. Mr. Paul Bartsch has
undertaken and partially completed a revision of the Pyramidellidee
of the Pacific coast, a puzzling group of shells requiring much micro-
scopical investigation.

Mr. Richard Rathbun reports as follows regarding the scientific
work of the Division of Marine Invertebrates:

The extensive collection of Decapod crustaceans obtained by the United States
Fish Commission steamer Fish Hawk in Porto Rico in the early part of 1899, were
transferred to this division for study. The report on the Anomura has been com-
pleted by Doctor Benedict, and that on the Macrura by Miss Rathbun, who has also
the portion on the Brachyura well under way. These reports will be published by
the Fish Commission.

Doctor Benedict has nearly completed a monograph of, the Galatheidee, to be pub-

lished in the Proceedings.
* Some of the Crustacea collected on the Branner-Agassiz expedition to Brazil in 1899,
by Dr. J. C. Branner and Mr. A. W. Greeley, have been worked up in this division,
the Decapoda and Stomatopoda by Miss Rathbun, the Isopoda by Miss Richardson.
Reports on the same are now in press and will appear in the Proceedings of the
Washington Academy of Sciences. The Annelida of the same expedition will be
studied by Doctor Benedict.

A beginning has been made toward a report on the Decapoda collected from Puget
Sound northward to Bering Sea by the Harriman Alaskan expedition, summer of
1899. ‘

Miss Rathbun has completed a report on the Decapod Crustacea of West Africa,
which has been published in the Proceedings, and has also made a series of keys to

North American crabs, two of which have already been published in the American
Naturalist.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 4]

The Decapoda and Isopoda collected on an expedition to the Galapagos Islands in
1898-99, sent out by Stanford University, have been received for study. The Isopoda
_haye been written up by Miss Richardson, and the Brachyura and Macrura have been
' determined by Miss Rathbun.

During last summer Miss Rathbun made a study of a certain portion of the fresh-
water crabs belonging to the Museum of Natural History, Paris.

Miss Richardson has prepared a key to North American Isopoda, which has
appeared in two numbers of the American Naturalist; she has also nearly completed
an account of the Isopoda of the Atlantic coast of North America, with descriptions of
many new species.

Mr. F. A. Lueas, in connection with work on fossil vertebrates, has
engaged in studies of the gallinaceous birds and of the cormorants, and
also of certain Cyprinodont fishes.

The treatise on the reptiles of Japan, prepared by Doctor Stejneger,
was delayed for want of satisfactory illustrations, but toward the close
of the year means were found to obtain desirable results, and it is
expected that the work can soon be published. Doctor Stejneger has
been engaged also on a monograph of the reptiles and batrachians of
Porto Rico, and, since his return from a visit to that island, has extended
the scope of his work to include a general survey of the Antilles.

Activity in mammalogy has been due almost exclusively to Mr. G. 5.
Miller, jr., who has studied and published upon numerous lots of
material in the Division of Mammals. He published fourteen contri-
butions during the year, including a series of directions for preparing
specimens of small mammals. His work on the free-tailed American
bats has been held back awaiting the accumulation of additional
material. An extended report on the mammals collected by Doctor
Abbott in the islands of the South China Sea, by Mr. Miller, was
completed during the year, and also a report on the mammals collected
by Mr. Currie in Liberia.

Mr. Ashmead continued work on his monograph of the North
American Braconide and on his reports on Japanese hymenoptera,
on the hymenoptera collected by Doctor Abbott in Africa and Siam,
and on the parasitic hymenoptera of the Hawaiian Islands. He
completed reports on the aculeate hymenoptera of St. Vincent and
Grenada received from the British Museum in 1897, and on the Aus-
tralia hymenoptera collected by Albert Koebele, and others bred by
Mr. W. W. Froggatt in New Zealand. Mr. Coquillett prepared
monographs of the flies of the families Ephydride and Drosophilide
and began a report on the Diptera of the Harriman Expedition. A
monograph of the antlions of North America was begun by Mr. R. P.
Currie.

Dr. J. N. Rose, besides determining the plants collected by him in
Mexico, completed, conjointly with Dr. J. M. Coulter, a revision of
the Umbelliferze of the United States, containing notices of about 50
species new to science. The Museum collection in this order is very
rich and contains fuily 9,000 sheets.
42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

Mr. Pollard continued his investigations of the North American
violets to which reference was made last year. In this work Professor
Greene, of the Catholic University of America, has largely codperated.
One set of duplicate specimens was distributed last year, as mentioned
in my previous report.

The head curator continued his investigations of the whalebone
whales of the North Atlantic, in connection with which he located and
as far as possible examined and photographed the types of the various
species hitherto described.

USE OF THE COLLECTIONS.

The staff of the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture
has, as in past years, made extensive use of the zoological collections,
especially those of mammals and birds. Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston,
Mass., made comparisons of birds recently collected for him in Panama
and Colombia with those from this region in the Museum. The col-
lections of Alaskan birds were examined by Dr. Louis B. Bishop, of
New Haven, Conn., in connection with his determinations of birds
collected by him in the Yukon region. Dr. A. W. Grabau, who is
making a special study of the mollusks of the family Fuside, spent
some time in examining the Museum collections. Numerous persons
brought shells to the Museum to be compared and named.

Many workers have been engaged upon the collections of the Divi-
sion of Marine Invertebrates during the year. Miss H. Richardson
continued work on the Isopods, Mr. T. Wayland Vaughan on West
Indian corals, and Mr. W. P. Hay on crayfishes. The Museum has
had the benefit of the services of these experts on several occasions.
Dr. Albert Mann spent several weeks in examining the deep-sea
deposits for diatoms. Several months were spent by Mrs. F. B.
Arnold in general studies of invertebrates in connection with a popular
work on marine life which-she is about to publish.

The collection of fishes have been made use of, as in preceding years,
by various officers of the United States Fish Commission, particularly
by Doctors Evermann, Kendall, and Smith, and Mr. M. C. Marsh.

The herbarium was extensively consulted during the year, both by
the members of the scientific staff of the Department of Agriculture
engaged in botanical work, and other botanists.

LOAN OF SPECIMENS.

As in previous years, the use of the collections for scientific purposes
is not confined to examination of material in the Museum laboratories.
Large numbers of specimens are sent out for study every year to
naturalists throughout the United States and in other countries.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 43

During the past year this has obtained toa large extent as regards
plants, birds, mammals, and marine invertebrates, and special mention
should be made of some of the more important loans.

The collection of crustaceans of the family Alpheide, which was to
have been worked up by Prof. F. H. Herrick, having been returned
by him with the statement that circumstances prevented his carrying
out the undertaking, it was transmitted to Dr. H. Coutiére, Museum
of Natural History, Paris, who has been many years engaged in the
study of the group.

Applications having been received simultaneously from Professor
Edwards, of the University of Cincinnati (now of Trinity College), and
Dr. Hubert L. Clark, of Olivet College, Michigas, for the use of the
collections of Holothurians for monographic purposes, it was decided
to divide the collections, sending the Apoda: to Dr. Clark, and the
remainder of the specimens to Professor Edwards. Mr. Robert W.
Hall, New Haven, Conn., obtained the use of the large collection of
Palemonetes for special study of that genus. Samples of ocean bot-
tom were sent to Dr. Albert Mann, who desired to search them for
diatoms.

Dr. J. Percy Moore, who has been engaged for some time in work-
ing up the collections of leeches, received an additional consignment of
specimens during the year.

The Museum collection of meadow larks (35 skins) was sent to Mr.
F. M. Chapman, of the American Museum of Natural History, New
York, for use in a revision of the genus Sturnella.

The collection of lemmings (124 skins) was lent to Mr. Witmer Stone,
of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, who was engaged
in a study of the species of this group of rodents.

At the request of Dr. D. S. Jordan the collections of Japanese and
Corean fishes made by Messrs. Jouy, Morse, Hitchcock, and Bernadou
were sent to the Leland Stanford Junior University, to aid in his work
on the fish faunas of these countries.

A collection of insects of the family Saldidee (Rhynchota) was sent
for the purpose of study to Prof. H. E. Summers, of the lowa Agricul-
tural College, who is engaged in monographing the family. Specimens
of Tipulidee and Ortalidz (Diptera) were lent to Prof. R. W. Doane,
for monographic purposes.

A collection of Hymenoptera was sent to Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell,
of Mesilla Park, N. Mex., for study in connection with his investiga-
tions of the mouth parts of these insects. Several other loans of
insects were made during the year.

The extensive use of the herbarium by experts outside of Washing-
ton is shown by the fact that 3,232 herbarium sheets were sent out for
study during the year.
44 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

sa DISTRIBUTION OF DUPLICATES.

The demand for zoédlogical material by educational institutions showed
no abatement during the year. Nearly all the sets of duplicate speci-
mens prepared some years ago have now been distributed, and it will
be necessary to form additional series at no distant date. Eighteen of
the educational sets of marine invertebrates and eleven special sets were
distributed.

PREPARATIONS FOR THE PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION.

The head curator of the department was appointed representative of
the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum for the Pan-Ameri-
can Exposition, to be held at Buffalo, in 1901. A plan for the exhibi-
tion of an outline series representing the vertebrate fauna of America
was formed at an early date, and in February, 1900, Doctors Stejneger
and Richmond were detailed to make collections in Porto Rico and other
islands of the Antilles, and Messrs. William Palmer and J. H. Riley in
Cuba. As already mentioned, a large amount of valuable zodlogical
and botanical material was obtained. Taxidermic work for the expo-
sition has been carried on during the year.

PERSONNEL.

On July 10, 1899, Mr. W. R. Maxon received temporary appoint-
ment as aid in the Division of Plants, and on November 16, 1899, he
was regularly added to the staff and was assigned to the section of
Cryptogamic collections. Mr. Sidney I. Wilson, of St. Joseph, Mo.,
spent several months in the Division of Birds as a volunteer assistant,
with the purpose of increasing his knowledge of ornithology. The
Museum has profited by the codperation of Mr. H. C. Oberholser, who
determined several collections of birds during the year. Professor
Greene contributed valuable expert services in the preparation of sets
of herbarium specimens of the various species of violets.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900.

By GrorGr P. MERRILL,
Head Curator.

The fiscal year just closed has been one of steady progress in the
department, and so far as the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology is
concerned, has been notable for the marked increase in the size and
value of the collections. Indeed, it is not too much to say that, so
far as acquisition of material is concerned, the progress made in this
section is without parallel in the history of the Museum.

ACCESSIONS.

The total number of accessions received by the various divisions is
tabulated below, the totals for 1898-99 being also given for the sake
of comparison:

It is, however, impossible to gain from these figures any tangible
idea of the value or amount of materiai received, since accessions vary
almost indefinitely, not only in number of specimens, but in the value
of the individual objects comprising them.

In the Division of Geology the more important materials received
were as follows: A series of orbicular granites from Finland, Sweden,
and Rhode Island; a series of oe 400 specimens of voleanic
materials from the Hawaiian Islands; some 2,000 specimens of rocks
representing areas surveyed by the Dneed States Geological Survey,’
and turned into the Museum for preservation, with a view to future
reference in accordance with the usual custom. These comprise rocks
from the Little Belt Mountains, the Uvalde, the Anthracite and Crested
Butte, and the Big Trees quadrangles; and the Silver Cliff and Rosita
districts of Colorado, besides much miscellaneous material.

46 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

In the Division of Minerals the most important accession has been
the private collection of Prof. Charles U. Shepard, comprising some
5,000 specimens, many of which are very choice and rare, as noted
below. The meteorite collection has increased more than during any
similar period in its history since the receipt of the Shepard collection
of meteorites in July, 1886. This great increase is due in part to the
purchase of the Allegan stone (some 64 pounds) which fell at Allegan,
Michigan, on July 10, 1899. In addition to this the following speci-
mens have been obtained: :

Aérolites. Jerome, Gove County, Kansas; Schénenberg, Bavaria;
Bishopville, Sumter County, South Carolina; Indarka, Russia; Lissa,
Bohemia.

Aérosiderites.—Augustinowka, Russia, and Bischtube, Russia.

The gem collection has been increased by three fine opals, and three
cut Japanese beryls.

The principal accession of the year in the Section of Vertebrate
Fossils has been the Marsh collection, which was formally transferred to
the Museum in December, 1899. This I will refer toin detail later. In
addition to this, the section has received: Through exchange with the
Glen Island Museum a fine specimen of fossil gar, Lepidosteus simplex;
avery perfect skull and a large part of the body of the fossil gar,
Lepidosteus atrow, the gift of Mr. Charles Schuchert; types of new
Jurassic fishes, described by Dr. C. R. Eastmann and transferred to
the Museum by the Geological Survey; a number of specimens of a
new Leuciscus, also received from the Geological Survey; a fine skull
and cranium of an “/lotherium and a Diceratherium, purchased from
Myr. Frank Stillwell.

The most important collections received in the Section of Inverte-
brate Paleontology are: The Cragin collection (1,322 specimens) of
Texas Jurassic fossils; the John M. Clarke collection (617 specimens)
of New York Lower Helderberg fossils; the Townsend collection (864
specimens) of Guelph (Upper Silurian) fossils; a collection of some
1,002 Mesozoic fossils, collected in Wyoming by Mr. Schuchert; a series
of specimens showing the twenty stages through which the Cambrian
trilobite Sao hirsuta passes during its development, received in exchange
from Dr. Anton Fritsch, of the Bohemian Museum; a series of corals
illustrating Mr. Vaughan’s forthcoming work on American corals; a
life-size model of the crustacean Stylonurus as restored by Dr. C. E.
Beecher; a specimen of the rare echinoid) Oligonoporus nobilis, the
gift of Mr. W. L. Woods; and from the Geological Survey a series of
labeled Cambrian brachiopods (366 specimens) and Rocky Mountain,
Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian fossils (740 specimens).

Additions of value in the Section of Paleobotany have come almost
wholly through the United States Geological Survey, and comprise:
A series of plants associated with the lavas of the Cascade Range,
as described and figured by Dr. F. H. Knowlton in the Twentieth
Annual Report of the United States Geological Survey; plants from

-" -

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 47

the Montana formations, described by the same author in Bulletin 163
of the Survey; plants of the Payette formation described by Dr. Knowl-
ton in the Eighteenth Annual Report of the United States Geological
Survey; plants from the Cascades of the Columbia; plants from
Esmeralda County, Nevada; a fine series of cycads from the Freezeout
Hills north of the Medicine Bow River, Carbon County, Wyoming,
collected by Mr. Charles Schuchert and Dr. Lester F. Ward.

PROGRESS IN INSTALLATION.

The progress in caring for the collections has been eminently satis-
factory. The confusion incidental to the erection of the new galleries
has been practically overcome, and it is not too much to say that the
collections as a whole are in better condition now than ever before.

The installation of the systematic series in the Section of Applied
Geology on the gallery in the southwest court (Plates 1 and 2) has
been practically completed and some 2,500 new labels have been sup-
plied. The reserve collection of ores has been arranged in the storage
drawers beneath the rail cases and a complete card catalogue of the
same prepared. Great changes have been made incidentally on the
ground floor of the court, which is now given up to the building-stone
collection; the collection illustrating the mineral resources of the
United States, and various special collections, as the Tenth Census col-
lection of iron ores; rocks and ores illustrating the geology of Lead-
ville; and collections illustrating the metallurgy of gold, silver, lead,
copper, zinc, and iron.

Progress in the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology has been slow,
since the energies of the division have been occupied almost entirely
in making a temporary place for the Marsh collection. One hundred
and thirteen boxes of this collection have been opened and their con-
tents distributed and catalogued. Fifteen skulls of Z/tanotheriwin,
and the limb bones of a large dinosaur have been mounted for exhibition.

In the Section of Invertebrate Paleontology Mr. Schuchert reports
the mounting of 2,850 specimens of Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous,
Ordovician, Silurian, Lower Helderberg, and Lower Carboniferous
fossils. In addition, the I. H. Harris collection of Cincinnati fossils,
comprising 75 boxes, has been unpacked, assorted, and prepared for
installation. A large amount of material has been also added to the
duplicate collections.

In the Section of Paleobotany the work of installing the Lacoe coi-
lection has been practically completed. Many of the older Museum
collections which have never been satisfactorily cared for have been
overhauled and catalogued and numbers painted upon the specimens
in a way, it is hoped, to avoid possible confusion in the future.

The work of building storage racks on galleries of the east south
and west south ranges has been completed and satisfactory progress
made in installing in the drawer space thus afforded material belong-
ing to the sections of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleobotany.
48 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

The duplicate series designed to show the origin of soils through
rock weathering and for distribution to schools and colleges, to which
reference was made in my last report, has been practically completed,
so far as gathering the materials is concerned; the work of labeling,
wrapping, and properly describing remains yet to be done. In addi-
tion to this, some 2,000 duplicates have been weeded out from the
collections of the Division of Geology alone, wrapped and labeled,
and sent to the storage sheds, according to our usual custom. Mr.
Schuchert reports that he has now in storage unassorted duplicate
materials aggregating many thousands of specimens.

With the reorganization of 1897, the plans for a Division of Tech-
nology were sufficiently formulated to enable me to turn over a large
amount of manufactured material and special exhibits, which had long
been recognized as not belonging properly to the Department of
Geology, but which were allowed to remain there simply that they
might be cared for. The space thus gained in storage and exhibition
rooms has been of material value to the department.

The constant intrusion of new materials in our exhibition: series,
together with the shifting of collections made possible by the acquisi-
tion of new cases on the galleries, has brought prominently forward the
question of labels, with particular reference to color, board, and char-
acter of type. It need scarcely be said that the first necessity of a
label is legibility. Brevity and conciseness of statement are also
important considerations. The head curator’s experience has led him
to“doubt the advisability of long explanatory labels for individual
specimens, excepting, it may be, in the case of large and striking
objects. The name of the object in type sufficiently large and clear to
catch the eye, and a few explanatory lines in smaller type, regarding
source, etc., are considered the chief essentials. After many trials the
form given Flote. printed on a gray board, which experience has shown
to be little affected by exposure, has been adopted in the sections of
Geology, Invertebrate Paleontology, and Paleobotany :—

DIAMONDS.—Cape Bort.

KIMBERLY MINES, SOUTH AFRICA. 55,671.

Diamonds of this size and quality are used in making
engravers’ points and burnishing tools for watch and
pencil case makers. Four pieces; weight, three-
eighths karats each.

GALENA.—Sulphide of lead. A clus-
ter of crystals showing both cubic and
octahedral faces.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 49

In the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology, where larger materials
permit the use of larger type, an herbarium board is used. The
drawback to the herbarium board in the small label, it should be
stated, lies in the difficulty of getting solid black impressions sufficient
to give the desired contrast and easy legibility.

In this connection copy for some 5,000 specimen labels has been
prepared and sent to the Government Printing Office during the year,
mainly from the sections of Geology and Invertebrate Paleontology.
Up to the close of the year some 3,500 of these had been printed.
Eleven large, explanatory labels, in black and gold, for the exhibition
halls, have also been prepared and are awaiting framing preparatory
to being put in place.

Some time has been occupied in revising and bringing up to date
the manuscript of a guide to a study of the collections in the Section
of Applied Geology. This is now completed, and at the date of writing
is at the Government Printing Office.

PRESENT CONDITION OF COLLECTIONS.

The present condition of the exhibition and study series of the
department can be in part surmised from what has already been said.
The crowded condition of the exhibition halls has led to the with-

drawal of some of the minor and less conspicuous exhibits to give

place to larger and more striking forms, Among the recent additions
of this class reference may be made to the cluster of basaltic colt
from Bennau, near Asbach, Prussia, shown in Plate 3. These o¢
the same relative position to one another as when formed, and con

Ss

y

_to the public a much better idea of columnar structure and its cause

than do the isolated columns. The materials were obtained and set up

for the Museum under the direction of Mr. F. W. Crosby, of this

city.

The large silicified tree trunks (Araucarioxylon arizonicum) trom the
so-called Fossil Forest or Chalcedony Park, near Holbrook, Arizona,
which were exhibited by the department at the Omaha Exposition in
1898, have been returned to the Museum and installed in the east end
of the west south range, there being no room for them with the Paleo-
botanical exhibit on the gallery. Unfortunately, the long trunk was
broken in three pieces in process of trans-shipment, but as the fractures
are sharp and unabraded, the trunk-like nature of the specimen is still
apparent. The exhibit comprises this trunk, 7} feet long by 20 inches
in diameter, with two cross sections each 33 inches in diameter.

The special series illustrating volcanic phenomena, faults, folds, and
concretionary structures are now in a very satisfactory condition.
Plate 4 shows some of the more striking forms of voleanic bombs from
various locaiities comprised in the first-named exhibit,

NAT Mus 1900——-4
50 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

From the series of jointed sandstones from the Black Hills collected
by Mr. N. H. Darton, of the United States Geological Survey, and
mentioned in my last annual report, have been selected for exhibition
the typical series shown in Plate 5. \ The sharpness and clear-cut nature |
of the faulting, together with the comparatively small amount of dis-
placement, render such blocks almost ideal for the purpose of exhibi-
tion. Advantage has been taken of opportunities for procuring exam-
ples of the peculiar concretionary forms of granitic rocks known to
the Germans as ‘‘kugel” granites and otherwise as orbicular or con-
cretionary granites. Such have been studied and described by Krut-
schoff, who regards them as contact phenomena and as due to the
crystallizing of the granitic material about preexisting fragments of
other rocks. One of the more striking forms from Sweden is shown
in Plate 6.

The meteorite collection, to which reference has already been made,
comprises 742 specimens, representing 349 falls. This places it among
the large collections of the world, being only excelled, so far as we
have knowledge, by those of Paris, London, Vienna, and the private
collections of Prof. H. A. Ward and Mr. C. 5. Bement.

The collections in the Division of Mineralogy are practically all
labeled, and a case at the south end of the hall has been prepared for
the reception of the Shepard collection of minerals already noted.
The text for a catalogue of the gem collection is well under way.

The question of getting a maximum number of specimens into a case
with a minimum amount of interference or shadow has been quite
satisfactorily solved, so far as the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology
is concerned, by the means shown in Plate 7. As will be noted, shelv-
ing is quite done away with, with the exception of that afforded by the
bottom of the case and two narrow shelves at the top for large and _
heavy materials which are often ‘‘ out of classification” as compared
with the rest of the exhibit. The fossils are cemented to encaustic
tiles which are of standard sizes, in units of 4-inch width, and which
are prevented from falling forward through some sudden jar by an
overlapping edge of wood at the top. By actual trial it has been
found that, though an apparently wasteful method of installation, so
far as space is concerned, more material can be actually put into a case
than when the ordinary horizontal or sloping shelf is used, and, more-
over, the view of one specimen is never obscured by one in front or
shadowed from above. The possibly objectionable features thus far
discovered are that it limits the size and weight of the specimen
exhibited and necessitates the cementing of the samples to the tiles.
The first-mentioned objection has proved thus far mainly theoretical,
space for the larger specimens being readily found on the bottom or
on the narrow shelves, while the second is avoided by not including in
the series materials that would be injured or whose value would be in
any way impaired by the cementing process.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 51

The view here given (Plate 8) of the gallery in the west south range
shows better than words the facilities for storage afforded by the new
galleries. The Section of Paleobotany has here some 1,900 drawers,
giving 10,000 square feet, and the Division of Geology 180 drawers,
giving some 800 square feet of storage space. The table cases around
the outer edges of the gallery serve as convenient tables for laying out
material for study, while giving at the same time additional storage
space beneath.

The paleobotanical series is now fairly well systematized and its value
is becoming recognized, as is shown by the following quotation from a
recent number of the American Geologist:

The United States National Museum has already become the great depository of
the coal-plant material in this country, and, with its great number of American types,
will doubtless remain a center of systematic work in this field.

For the first time in the history of the Museum all the halls devoted
to exhibition purposes in geology are open to the public. Much, of
course, remains to be done, but the confused and unsightly condition
of affairs which has existed for nearly three years has subsided. It
should be stated, however, that the work on the exhibition series of
the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology has been scarcely begun, and it
will require years of labor to bring this up to the standard of those
which have been longer in existence.

Tons of material from the Marsh collection are stored in a rented
building used as a work and store room of the department, where they
must remain until they can be unpacked, sorted, and cleaned, a task
which, with the present force, will occupy several years at best.

RESEARCH.

For several years past so large a proportion of the energies of the
curators has been consumed in the work of installation, that very little
in the way of investigation could be carried on, and almost no work of
a systematic and far-reaching nature.

The head curator has devoted considerable time to the meteorite
collection, and has published a preliminary paper on the stone which
fell at Allegan, Michigan, in July, 1899. He has also devoted some
time to the study of the collection of voleanic rocks made by Prof.
C. H. Hitchcock in the island of Oahu.

Mr. Tassin has devoted some attention to the subject of hydrolosis
of the metallic sulphates, especially those of iron, with particular refer-
ence to the origin of the red colors in sedimentary deposits. His work
is as yet incomplete. He is also engaged in preparing a handbook on
the collection of gems and meteorites.

Mr. Lucas has studied the dentition and general structure of Zeug-
lodon, and has prepared a paper on the pelvic girdle of the same. He
has also described a new fossil from the Miocene of California, and
52 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

studied the Miocene Rhinoceros and Titanotherium, and a new Stego-
saur from the Lower Cretaceous. He has also devoted some time to
the study of the skull of Lepidosteus.

Mr. Schuchert has prepared a preliminary catalogue of Cephalopod
genera and has devoted considerable attention to the subject of the
Lower Devonian aspect of the Lower Helderberg and Oriskany for-
mations. On this subject he is still engaged. He has also continued
his work on a monograph of the American fossil starfishes.

SOURCES OF NEW MATERIAL.

The principal source of material for the Division of Geology, as in
years past, has been the United States Geological Survey. In addi-
tion, mention should be made of the continued interest shown by Mr.
F. W. Crosby, and of the cooperation of Prof. C. H. Hitchcock, in the
Hawaiian Islands. .

It will be remembered that in 1887 Dr. C. U. Shepard, jr., deposited
in the Museum his meteorite collection, numbering at the time 101
specimens. During the past year he has again manifested his interest
in the National Museum by depositing the entire series of books,
pamphlets, and manuscripts on meteorites, left by his father, the late
Prof. C. U. Shepard, and, in addition, his private collection of minerals,
consisting of upward of 5,000 carefully selected specimens, many of
which are quite rare. The collection is particularly noteworthy for
the superb series of Graves Mountain rutiles and lazulites, and also
the series of southern phosphates and their associations. The col-
lection, as a whole, forms a most important addition to our crys-
tallographic series, and is of further interest from an historical stand-
point, containing many of Prof. Shepard’s types and illustrating the
classification prevalent during his day. The acquisition of these old
collections is a matter of the highest importance, since such often con-
tain materials from localities now exhausted, or which served as types
in the original descriptions. Further than this, they serve to keep
alive the memory of one who was a pioneer in his line of work,
Prof. Shepard’s Treatise on Mineralogy, 1832, being the third work
on this subject to appear in America from the hands of an American
author.

It will be remembered that Prof. O. C. Marsh, of Yale College,
served as vertebrate paleontologist to the United States Geological
Survey from 1882 to 1892, inclusive. During these ten years of actual
service his department received such allotments as enabled him to
employ continuously from seven to ten persons in the capacities of
collectors, preparators, clerks, etc., and to accumulate a quantity of
exceedingly valuable material, a large proportion of which was still at
New Haven at the time of his death.

After the death of Professor Marsh it was decided by the Director
of the Survey, Dr. C. D, Walcott, to transfer the entire collection to

the custody of the National Museum, subject only to the usual restric-
tions. The work of packing and shipping, which fell to the lot of
this department, under the immediate supervision of Mr. F. A. Lucas,
was begun in April, 1899, as stated in my last report, and completed the
following November, the final transfer being made December 8, as will
be observed from an abstract of the correspondence here inserted.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
Unitep Srates GEOLOGICAL SURVEY,

December 8, 1899.
Prof. 8. P. LANGLEY,

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C.

Dear Srr: I have the honor to state that all the vertebrate collections of the late
Prof. O. C. Marsh, belonging to the Government, have been shipped from New
Haven, Conn., and are now transferred to the custody of the United States National
Museum, subject only to the use of such material as may be necessary for study and
illustration in the completion of the monographs that were in course of preparation
by Professor Marsh at the time of his death.

From a statement submitted by Mr. F. A. Lucas, who had charge of the packing
of the collections, it appears that there were 1,200 trays (20 by 26 inches) of speci-
mens, 200 unopened boxes as received from the field, 30 blocks, and 90 prepared
specimens. To ship this material required 592 boxes, forming 5 carloads, having an
aggregate weight of 160,000 pounds. To this there should be added 2 carloads, con-
taining 211 boxes, received from Professor Marsh on deposit in 1891 and 1898.

The actual number of specimens represented in this collection can not be stated.
They range in size from minute teeth of fossil mammals to individual specimens
weighing from 500 to 2,000 pounds each. The collections are rich in large Dinosauria,
especially in examples of Triceratops and Stegosaurus, while the series of Titanothe-
rium skulls is one of the best, if not the best, in existence. It contains fifty or more
complete examples cleaned, and a number in the rough, besides many hundred
bones.

Among the specimens transferred are the types of forty or more species, including
Dinosaurs, and Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary mammals. Among the types are
the following:

Drxosaurs. JURASSIC MAMMALS.
Diplodocus longus. Paurodon valens.
Labrosaurus ferox. Manacodon rarus.
Camptosaurus nanus. Enneodon crassus.
Triceratops sulcatus. Enneodon affinis.
Triceratops californis. Taodon venustus.
Triceratops obtusa. CRETACEOUS MAMMAIS.
Pleorocelus nanus. Priconodon crassus.
Ceratosaurus nasicornis. Cimolodon agilis.
Ceratops montanus. Telacodon prexstans.
Ceratops alticornis. Oracodon cenulus.

CRocopDILEs. Allacodon pumilis.
Rhytidodon rostratus. Batodon tenuis.

SNAKES. Allacodon fortis.

Coniophis precedens.

It is to be recalled that these collections were made by Professor Marsh during his
connection with the Geological Survey, from 1882 to 1892, inclusive; that prior to his
connection with the Survey he made large collections, including the toothed birds,
54 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

the Dinoceratu, Brontosaurus, many Dinosaurs, and the best Titanotherium yet dis-
covered. He also purchased numerous collections after the stopping of allotments
for his work in 1892. These collections were transferred to Yale University some
time prior to his death.

As there has been considerable comment in relation to this matter, I send you a
copy of a report on the examination of the collections under Professor Marsh’s
charge, made by me to the Director of the Geological Survey, in 1892.

I twice visited New Haven while the collections were being packed, and am fully
convinced that all material belonging to the Government has been transferred to
Washington. Mr. Lucas reports that the trustees of the Peabody Museum in New
Haven gave him every facility for packing the collections, and that the records were
so complete that no difficulties arose in determining those specimens which belonged
to the Government and those which were the property of the Peabody Museum.

The transfer of these great collections to Washington without the loss of any mate-
rial, either through imperfect recording or through misunderstanding as to the owner-
ship of specimens, reflects the greatest credit on the business-like‘methods and the
integrity of Professor Marsh. The addition of the material to the National Museum
places it in the front rank among museums in its collection of vertebrate fossils. It
is necessary that some gaps in the collections be filled, and I sincerely trust it will
be possible for the Museum to do this at an early date.

Yours respectfully,
Cras. D. Watcorr, Director.

SmirHsoniAn Insrirution, December 22, 1899.

Dear Sir: I take great pleasure in acknowledging the receipt of your letter of the
8th instant, advising me that you have transferred to the National Museum all the
vertebrate fossils collected by the late Prof. O. C. Marsh belonging to the United
States Government, subject only to the condition that such material as is required
may be used for study and illustration in completing the monographs which were in
preparation by Professor Marsh at the time of his death.

The addition of this immense collection of most important American fossil remains
to the treasures already assembled in the National Museum will, I am sure, afford
the greatest satisfaction to all workers in the field of paleontology both at home and
abroad, and you will permit me to add a personal word in appreciation of your untir-
ing efforts to facilitate in every way possible the great task connected with the
remoyal of the collection from New Haven to Washington.

During the coming year I expect to have two preparators engaged in working out
of the matrix specimens still uncleaned, and confidently hope that it may be possi-
ble in a few years to have the entire collection made available for study and a
selected series for public exhibition. From this latter series the public will be able
to form a correct idea as to the number, variety, and great size of these wonderful
extinct creatures of the western country, and will undoubtedly be impressed with
the extent and importance of the work of the paleontological divisions of the Geolog-
ical Survey and the marvelous industry and intelligence displayed by Professor
Marsh in bringing together this great collection.

Yours respectfully, 8. P. Lanewey, Secretary:

Hon. Cuaries D. Watcort,

Director United States Geological Survey, Washington, D. C.

As may readily be imagined, the receipt of these enormous collec-
tions, many of which were still uncleaned and in the matrix, single
specimens in some instances weighing several thousand pounds, taxed
the resources of the Department greatly. Fortunately the gallery in
the east south range was completed, and, when fitted with standard

storage racks and drawers, furnished room for such of the material as
was already cleaned. A very large share of the material could ‘not
however, be brought into the Museum building without blocking the
exhibition halls, and was, therefore, stored as fast as received, without
unpacking, in a rented building, as already noted.

In June, 1899, the Union Pacitic Railroad Company extended to the
Smithsonian Institution an invitation to send a representative of the
Museum to participate in a collecting and exploring tour through
the fossil fields of Wyoming. This invitation was accepted, and Mr.
Charles Schuchert, assistant curator in the Division of Invertebrate
Fossils, was detailed to make the trip. Mr. Schuchert left Washing-
ton early in July and returned the last week in September.

During this time, aside from many valuable observations, he col-
lected upward of 1,000 Jurassic invertebrates, and a very complete
femur of a large Dinosaur, and purchased and donated to the Museum
the particularly fine gar, Lepidosteus atrox, shown in Plate 9. He
also obtained numerous lithological and mineralogical specimens.

Inasmuch as there is much popular misapprehension regarding the
occurrence and mode of procedure in collecting these vertebrate remains,
or rather since the public at large has no adequate conception of the
skill and expense involved in collecting and so restoring such remains
that they may be of value for exhibition and study, I have introduced
the following extract from an article published by Mr. Schuchert in
Science for November 17, 1899:

In the very beginning, alarming setbacks are encountered when climbing the hills
in any direction for a “‘bone lead.’’? Having the good fortune to discover one, the
real work then begins in the digging, only to find that every bone is cracked into
innumerable pieces. These must be bandaged and set in plaster, and when all is
hard the bones can be turned to undergo more bandaging. This means that one
must have patience, be expert with pick and shovel, with gunny sacking and plaster,
and with saw and hammer. However, with all these difficulties to overcome, no
less than 6 carloads of bones were shipped this summer from Medicine Bow, a little
village on the Union Pacific Railroad in Wyoming, by specially organized parties
from the universities of Wyoming and Kansas, and the Field, Carnegie, and American
museums of natural history.

In no one place are complete Dinosaur skeletons found. Sometimes a ‘‘quarry”’
will yield a lot of vertebrie, or a number of either hind or fore limbs, or there isa
general mixture of parts of animals of different genera. To make an adequate col-
lection of Jurassic Dinosaurs, therefore, requires several successful field seasons. The
cost is still further enhanced since in the laboratory the bones must be cleaned,
hardened, and restored before they are ready for study and exhibition. On account
of these conditions and the further one that Dinosaur skeletons are very large, the
work is extremely expensive. We can, therefore, believe that the best skeleton of
Brontosaurus in Professor Marsh’s collection, an imperfect one, cost him $10,000.

ce

No systematic explorations with a view to enriching the collections
in paleobotany, mineralogy, or geology were undertaken, though a
very considerable amount of material was obtained by exchange.
56 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

ASSISTANCE AFFORDED STUDENTS AND INVESTIGATORS.

During the year there have been sent out from the Division of
Geology some 18 lots of material, comprising 284 specimens for study
and by exchange.

Specimens from the duplicate collection in the Division of Miner-
alogy have been furnished Dr. F. W. Clarke for use in his work on
the composition of the various silicates, noted in the bibliography,
and also to other members of the Geological Survey as occasion
required. Mention should here be made of a lot of carnotite furnished
to Dr. Hillebrand for his investigations, the results of which are not
yet published.

The fine specimen of Lepidosteus simplex from the Section of Verte-
brate Paleontology was lent to Dr. C. R. Eastman, of Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and has been returned. The type specimen of Agwus
excelsus and other bones belonging to this genus have been lent to Mr.
J. W. Gidley, of the American Museum of Natural History at New
York, where they still remain.

From the Section of Invertebrate Paleontology collections were lent
for purposes of study to Dr. Anton Fritsch, of Prague; Dr. E. Schell-
wein, of Kénigsberg, and Dr. G. Hambach, of St. Louis, Missouri.

In accordance with the usual practice, facilities for study have been
afforded to students not officially connected with the institution, when
such could be done without too much interference with Museum work.
Dr. E. C. E. Lord, as in the year previous, has passed some time in the
laboratory of the department engaged in the study of eruptive rocks
from the coast of Maine. Mr. M. W. Twitchell, a graduate student
of the Columbian University, has utilized the goniometer and other
facilities in the Division of Mineralogy in the work of preparing his
thesis for an advanced degree. Dr. O. P. Hay has spent some time
in the study of the paleozoic fishes, and Dr. C. R. Eastman has utilized
Museum material in the preparation of a paper on the fossil gar. Dr.
A. S. Woodward, of the British Museum, made a brief examination
‘f the types of various fossil fishes in our collections. Mr. R. B.
Rowe, of the Maryland Geological Survey, Prof. John M. Nichols, of
Cincinnati, and Mr. E. H. Sellards, of the University of Kansas, have
also had access to Museum materials in connection with their own

work.
FUTURE WORK.

No radical changes in the plans for the work in any of the divisions
of the department are contemplated. There remains yeta large amount
of work to be done in the exhibition series in vertebrate paleontology:
and paleobotany, which will doubtless consume the greater portion of
the time of those in charge of these divisions for an indefinite period.

Prior to the reorganization of the Museum in 1897, the catalogues
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ay

of the various divisions had been kept quite independently of and with-
out sufficient regard to each other, and in many cases the work was
very imperfectly done, owing to lack of sufficient assistance. Under
the present administration an attempt is being made to centralize and
harmonize the work of cataloguing. This will, however, involve the
rewriting of probably 200,000 entries as well as much careful over-
hauling of the records, and is a work which we can not hope to accom-
plish within several years. It is the intention of the head curator to
give particular attention to this work during the coming year.

The department has now arrived at that stage in the building up of
its collections where a proportionately small amount of material of
value is received in the form of donations. If, therefore, the collec-
tions are to be systematic and well balanced, a considerable amount of
money must be available for purposes of purchase. This is a matter
which has been repeatedly urged and needs no further mention.

SUMMARY OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE YEAR.

THE MUSEUM STAFF.

The executive curator, Dr. Frederick W. True, continued in direct
charge of the administration of the Museum during the year, the
Assistant Secretary exercising only a general supervision over its
affairs.

There have been but few changes in connection with the scientific
staff. In the death of Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing on April 10, 1900,
the Museum, as well as the Bureau of Ethnology, lost one of its most
active and distinguished workers during nearly a quarter of a century.
Medical Director James M. Flint, U. S. N., under whose supervision
the Division of Materia Medica was established in 1881, and who has
been its honorary curator, under detail by the Secretary of the Navy,
for three separate periods, aggregating about thirteen years, was
placed on the retired list of the Navy in February, 1900. Proposing
to continue his residence in Washington, however, Doctor Flint has
volunteered his further services in the same capacity and they have
been gladly accepted.

Mr. W. R. Maxon was appointed an aid in the Division of Plants in
November, 1899.

A list of the members of the scientific and administrative staffs will
be found in Appendix I.

APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPENDITURES.

The total amount appropriated by Congress for the maintenance of
the Museum during the year ending June 30, 1900, was $238,540, as
against $257,000 for the previous year. The only changes in the sey-
eral items, as compared with 1899, were an increase of $5,000 under
preservation of collections and of $2,000 under building repairs, and a
decrease of $10,000 under furniture and fixtures and of $460 under
rent of workshops. The sundry civil act for 1899 also contained two
special items, one of $10,000 for the construction of galleries and one
of $5,000 for the purchase of the scientific library of the late Dr. G.
Brown Goode, which are mainly accountable for the larger appropri-
ation in that year.
60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

The expenditures actually made from the appropriations for 1900
up to the end of that fiscal year aggregated $224,912.42, leaving a
balance of $13,627.58 to meet outstanding liabilities. During the
same year $12,284.88 were disbursed from the balance ($12,629.63) of

the appropriation for 1899 remaining on July 1, 1899.

Disbursements to the extent of $88 were also made on account of

preservation of collections for 1897-98, leaving a balance under that
item on June 30, 1900, of $9.28. Other balances remaining from the
appropriations for the same year, all of which now revert to the sur-
plus fund of the Treasury, are as follows: Furniture and fixtures, $1.23;
heating and lighting, $5.49; building repairs, $4.53; galleries, $8.87;

BUILDINGS.

Skylights have been placed in the roof of the Museum building above
the four courts and above the west south, east south, and south east
ranges, in all of which the lighting has been poor, especially since the
construction of galleries in them. The galleries in the east, west, and
south halls and the stairways leading to the galleries from the rotunda
have been furnished with iron railings, and the gallery in the south
east range has been extended so as to form a complete second story,
adding much needed room for laboratory and storage purposes.

The old wooden floor in the main hall of the Smithsonian building,

replaced by a terrazzo pavement, a change long contemplated, which

RESEARCHES.

An account of the researches carried on by members of the Museum
staff will be found in the reports of the head curators. A great deal
of the work of identifying and monographing the collections is, how-
ever, performed by persons not connected with the Museum, but for
the most part having relations with other establishments of learning
either in this country or abroad. Such services are, with rare excep-
tions, rendered gratuitously, even though they be directly solicited
on the part of the Museum. In very many cases, the use of speci-
mens is given to aid in the preparation of reports undertaken in the
interest of the expert himself or in behalf of the institution to which
he belongs, the Museum benefiting indirectly. It is arranged, wherever
possible, to have these investigations conducted in Washington, and
specimens are only sent away for study when their safety can be
definitely assured. Considerable progress has been made during the
year, under this practice, in the working up of collections.

From the Department of Anthropology, a series of Shoshone and
Ute crania was lent to Dr. A. Hrdlicka, of the American Museum
of Natural History, New York, and a part of the collection of primi-
tive games to Mr. Stewart Culin, director of the museum of the
University of Pennsylvania. It may also be mentioned here that a
number of the models of vehicles from the collections illustrating

land transportation were sent for copying to the Carnegie Museum
at Pittsburg, and many models from the historical series of electrical
apparatus were turned over to the United States Commissioner-
General for exhibition at the Paris ixposition.

In zoology, the collections of mammals and birds have been util-
ized by the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture,
and those of fishes by the Fish Commission. Studies have been con-
ducted at the Museum by Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, Mass., on
the birds recently received from the regionabout Panama; by Dr. Louis
B. Bishop, of New Haven, Conn., on Alaskan birds in connection
with those collected by him in the Yukon region, and by Dr. A. W.
Graham, on the Fusidee, a family of mollusks. Miss Harriet Richard-
son has continued her work on the Isopod crustaceans; Mr. T. Way-
land Vaughan, of the Geological Survey, his studies of West Indian
and other recent corals, and Prof. W. P. Hay, of Howard Univer-
sity, his investigations on crayfishes.

Arrangements for monographing the extensive collection of Holo-
thurians were made with Prof. Hubert Lyman Clark, of Olivet College,
Michigan, and Prof. C. L. Edwards, of Trinity College, Hartford,
Conn., and the specimens have been sent to them. The Pedata were
assigned to Professor Edwards and the Apoda to Professor Clark.
Additional specimens of leeches were forwarded to Prof. J. Percy
Moore, of the University of Pennsylvania, who has for some time
been engaged in working up the Museum’s material in this group.

The principal loans of zoological material have been as follows:
The collection of lemmings to Mr. Witmer Stone, of the Philadelphia
Academy of Natural Sciences; the collection of meadow larks to Mr.
F. M. Chapman, of the American Museum of Natural History, who is
engaged upon a revision of the genus Sturnella, the collection of
Japanese and Korean fishes to President David S. Jordan, of Leland
Stanford Junior University; the crustaceans of the family Alpheidee
to Dr. H. Coutiére, of the Museum of Natural History, Paris, France,
and of the genus Palamonetes to Mr. Robert W. Hall, of New Haven,
Conn.; a collection of Diptera to Prof. R. W. Doane, of the Museum
of Comparative Zoology; a collection of Hymenoptera to Prof. T. D.
A. Cockerell, of Mesilla Park, N. Mex., and specimens of the family
Saldidee to Prof. H. E. Summers, of the Iowa Agricultural College.
Entomological specimens have also been supplied to Dr. Samuel H.
Scudder, of Cambridge, Mass.; Prof. John B. Smith, of Rutgers Col-
lege, New Brunswick, N. J.; Prof. C. H. Fernald, of the Massachusetts
Agricultural College; Rev. George B. Hulst, of Brooklyn, N. Y.: Dr.
Herman Strecker, of Reading, Pa., and Mr. William Beutenmiiller,
of the American Museum of Natural History.

Specimens of plants were lent to a large number of persons, the
principal sendings having been to the Gray Herbarium, at Cambridge,

Mass.; Dr. N. L. Britton, of the New York Botanical Gardens; Prof.
L. M. Underwood, of Columbia University; Dr. William Trelease, of
the Missouri Botanical Garden; Mr. W. W. Ashe, of the North Caro-
lina Geological Survey; Mr. L. F. Henderson, Boston, Mass.; Mr.
Alvah A. Eaton, Seabrook, N. H.; Mr. Williard N. Clute, Bingham-
ton, N. Y.; Dr. B. W. Evermann and Theodor Holm, Washington,
D. C., and Mr. Anton Heimel, Vienna, Austria.

The facilities afforded by the Department of Geology have been
availed of by several persons, including assistants of the United States
Geological Survey. The eruptive rocks from the coast of Maine were
studied by Dr. E. C. E. Lord. The types of certain fossil fishes were
examined by Dr. A. 8. Woodward, of the British Museum. The pale-
ozoic fishes were studied by Dr. O. P. Hay, of the American Museum of
Natural History, and the fossil gars by Dr. C. R. Eastman, of the
Museum of Comparative Zoology. Among others who had access to
the collections were Mr. kh. B. Rowe, of the Maryland Geological Sur-
vey; Mr. EK. H. Sellards, of the University of Kansas, and Prof. John
M. Nichols, of Cincinnati, Ohio.

Collections of invertebrate fossils were lent to Dr. Anton Fritsch,
of Prague, Bohemia; Dr. E. Schellwein, of Kénigsberg, Prussia, and
Dr. G. Hambach, of St. Louis, Mo.; and a number of specimens of
fossil horse remains were sent to Mr. J. W. Gidley, of the American
Museum of Natural History.

COOPERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT.

The relations of the Museum with the Executive Departments have
been greatly extended during the last few years, especially as regards
the War and Navy Departments in connection with their operations
across the seas, through the cordial assistance rendered by officers of
these two services. The historical and ethnological collections were
the first to be benefited, but latterly more attention has been given to
the natural features of the new possessions, and many interesting con-
tributions in zoology and botany are now being received. It is hoped
that the interest thus stimulated will lead to important results in this
direction. In European countries the military branches of the gov-
ernments have done much toward enriching the collections of their
national museums, and it would be exceedingly unfortunate were the
exceptional opportunities now presented to our own country and our
own National Museum to be neglected.

The State Department, through its diplomatic and consular officers,
has also been instrumental in securing much valuable material. The
receipts from the Fish Commission, consisting mainly of zoological
collections obtained on the Porto Rican expedition of the steamer
fish Hawk, have heen of great interest. The United States Geological
Survey has transmitted material from many sources, but of most
68 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

importance, and constituting perhaps the largest single accession ever
received, was the well-known collection of vertebrate fossils assembled
under the direction of the late Prof. O. C. Marsh, of Yale University.
The scientific branches of the Department of Agriculture which engage
in field collecting, the Biological Survey, the Division of Entomology,
and the Division of Botany, have, as in past years, deposited in the
Museum the main parts of the material resulting from the year’s work.
The collections received from the Bureau of American Ethnology have
been extensive and noteworthy.

Acknowledgment is due to several of the Departments for courtesies
in connection with administrative matters, especially deserving of men-
tion being the facilities afforded for the transportation of collections
and assistants by the Quartermaster’s Department of the Army.

EXPLORATIONS.

Although having very limited means for field investigations, at least
a few members of the Museum staff spend a month or more during
every year in adding to the collections, making their trips independently
or in connection with expeditions sent out by other Government
bureaus or under private auspices. Much important material is
obtained in this way.

Dr. F. W. True spent several weeks of the summer of 1899 at the
station of the Cabot Steam Whaling Company, in Newfoundland, study-
ing the finback and humpback whales, which are taken along see: coast
in large numbers.

Aten apolosieel researches were carried on in Cuba and Jamaica
during the spring of 1900 by Maj. J. W. Powell, Director of the
Bureau of American Ethnology, and Mr. William H. Holmes, head
curator of anthropology, who collected many objects illustrating the
ancient peoples of those islands.

Extensive zoological and botanical collections were made in Cuba
and Porto Rico for the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 by Dr.
Leonhard Stejneger, Dr. Charles W. Richmond, Mr. William Palmer,
and Mr. J. H. Riley, of the Museum staff. The groups of animals
chiefly represented were birds, reptiles and batrachians, fishes, bats,
insects, crustaceans and annelids. The Philippine Islands were visited
in behalf of the same exposition by Col. H. H. Hilder, of the Bureau
of American Ethnology, who secured a large amount of interesting
material bearing upon the native tribes and the history of the islands.

The expedition to central and southern Mexico by Dr. J. N. Rose
and Dr. Walter Hough, which started in the spring of 1899, as noted
in the last report, continued during a part of the summer and was
very successful. Its object was the collecting of botanical and ethno-
botanical specimens, the latter including plants used in the arts, both
ancient and modern, and examples of native handiwork. At the close
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 69

of the year Mr. Marcus W. Lyon, jr., was in Venezuela with Lieut.
Wirt Robinson, U. S. A., having been detailed to make collections of
the higher vertebrates. Mr. Barton A. Bean was in the Vineyard
Sound region of Massachusetts during part of the summer of 1899
in the interest of the Division of Fishes.

During the summer of 1899 Mr. Charles Schuchert accompanied an
expedition under the auspices of the Union Pacific Railroad Company
to the fossil beds of Wyoming, where he obtained many Jurassic
invertebrate fossils, the femur of a large Dinosaur, and a large number
of lithological and mineralogical specimens. In company with Prof.
Lester F. Ward, he also collected an interesting series of fossil cycads
in the same State.

On the expedition to Alaska during June and July, 1899, so elabo-
rately equipped and carried out at the expense of Mr. EK. H. Harriman,
of New York, the National Museum was represented by Mr. William
H. Dall, Mr. Robert Ridgway, Dr. C. Hart Merriam, and Mr. F. V.
Coville. The birds, insects, mollusks, and plants obtained have been
transferred to the Museum, the plants coming through the Department
of Agriculture, while the insects, collected by Mr. Trevor Kincaid, of
Seattle, Wash., were presented by Mr. Harriman. Before returning
to Washington Mr. Dall visited the Hawaiian Islands, where he made
an important collection of mollusks.

The Government explorations which contribute most constantly and
extensively to the Museum are those conducted by the Geological
Survey, the Fish Commission, and the scientific bureaus of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, in all of which there was much activity during
the past year. The cruise of the Fish Commission steamer A/batross
to the South Pacific Ocean offered an opportunity for securing ethno-
logical objects from many interesting islands, and through the courtesy
of the Commissioner of Fisheries two of the naturalists attached to the
expedition, Mr. C. H. Townsend and Mr. H. F. Moore, were author-
ized to collect in this field. They were successful in obtaining much
valuable material. Explorations under the Department of Agriculture
have been illustrated by extensive collections of plants made in Alaska
by Mr. F. V. Coville and Mr. T. H. Kearney, and in Virginia and
North Carolina by Mr. Kearney, and by an interesting collection of
insects gathered in Porto Rico by Mr. August Busck, and of crusta-
ceans obtained in Texas and Mexico by Messrs. Vernon Bailey, E. W.
Nelson, and KE. A. Goldman. Several important accessions have also
been received as the result of the field work of the Geological Survey.
Interest in the needs of the Museum has been aroused among officers
of the Army and Navy and observers of the Weather Bureau stationed
in the West Indies and the South Pacific Ocean, and it is expected that
valuable contributions will soon be received through these channels.
A collection of reptiles, which he made in Texas, has been presented by
Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S. A.
70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

Of private expeditions there have been several which benefited the
Museum. Asa result of his explorations in the Malay Archipelago
and other eastern localities, including Trong, Lower Siam, and Singa-
pore, Dr. William L. Abbott has contributed a large and important
collection of zoological and ethnological material, the former compris-
ing 257 mammals, 763 birds, and 125 batrachians, besides many insects
and other forms of invertebrates. Among the specimens are many
species new to science and numerous others not heretofore represented
in the Museum. This is only one of several expeditions through
which the Museum has been placed under great indebtedness to Doctor
Abbott.

While at the Samoan Islands as the British representative on the
joint commission, Sir Charles Eliot found time to bring together an
excellent collection of the mollusks and other marine invertebrates,
which he has kindly turned over to the National Museum.

Other acquisitions, the results of private explorations, have been as
follows: A series of Japanese fishes from the Leland Stanford Junior
University; a collection of crustaceans made on the Brazilian coast
by Dr. John C. Branner during the Branner-Agassiz expedition; a
collection of Hawaiian crustaceans from Mr. H. W. Henshaw; about
300 Colombian birds from Mr. Outram Bangs; over 800 plants of the
State of Washington from Mr. Kirk Whited; a valuable series of
volcanic rocks and other geological material from the Hawaiian Islands,
from Prof. C. H. Hitchcock.

Collecting outfits.—Outfits have been furnished to the following
persons who have offered to collect material for the Museum: Prof.
Dean C. Worcester, United States commissioner to the Philippine
Islands; Capt. H. C. Benson, Manila; Dr. Azel Ames and Mr. L. M.
McCormick, San Juan, P. R.; Mr. B. S. Bowdish, Aguadilla, P. R.;
Maj. J. H. Hysell, Santiago, Cuba; Capt. O. 5. Durfee, Ciego de
Ovila, Cuba; Mr. F. G. Gosling, Hamilton, Bermuda; Mr. Charles
B. Taylor, Kingston, Jamaica; Mr. Fred Driver, Montserrat, West

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.
INFORMATION FURNISHED.

The Museum long ago came to be regarded by the public at large as
a place where information might be sought on many scientific topics.
Specimens are sent for identification and analysis, and inquiries are
received bearing upon every subject within its scope, as well as upon
many with which it has no relation. Every communication is an-
swered, and so far as possible the writer’s wishes are complied with,
though requests for chemical analyses can not be met, as the Museum
is not equipped for work of that kind.

During the past year the demands in this direction were much
greater than ever before. Over seven hundred lots of objects were
received for examination, while of letters asking information there was
an average of not less than one hundred weekly. As will be realized,
the time of both the scientific and the clerical staff was heavily drawn
upon in preparing the necessary replies. Very few of the specimens
which come in this way are of any value to the Museum, while those
that might be profitably added to the collections have generally to be
returned to the owners, so that the Museum derives little benefit from

these sendings.
PUBLICATIONS.

Volume 1 of the Annual. Report for 1897 was received from the
Government Printing Office in December. The several papers com-
posing it have also been issued in separate pamphlet form and dis-
tributed in the usual manner. The second volume of this report, still
in course of printing, will contain a biographical account of Dr. George
Brown Goode, the late assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion in charge of the National Museum, and reprints of several of his
most important papers on museums and on the history of scientific
progress in the United States. It is expected that the Annual Report
for 1898 will be ready for distribution early in the next fiscal year.
The appendix to this report will consist of only one paper—a mono-
graphic treatise on the **Crocodilians, Lizards, and Snakes of North
America,” by the late Prof. Edward Drinker Cope.

Volume 21 of the Proceedings was issued in August, 1899, and 24
papers of volume 22 were printed and distributed during the year.

Part + of Bulletin No. 47, entitled ‘* The Fishes of North and Middle
America,” by Dr. David Starr Jordan and Dr. Barton Warren Ever-
mann, was printed just before the close of the year. This volume, con-
sisting of some additions to the text, 392 plates with their explanations,
and a general table of contents, completes one of the most important
works thus far published by the Museum. Parts M, N,and O have also
been added to Bulletin No. 39. They are entitled, respectively, ‘* The
methods employed at the Naples Zoological Station for the preserya-
tion of marine animals,” by Dr. Salvatore Lo Bianco; ‘* Directions for
72 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

preparing study specimens of small mammals,” by Gerrit S. Miller, jr.;
and ‘* Directions for collecting and rearing dragon flies, stone flies, and
may flies,” by Dr. James G. Needham.

A list of the publications of the Museum and of the members of its
staff, issued during the year, is presented in Appendix IV. The
number of authors represented is 66 and the total number of papers
cited 276. The following table classifies these papers in accordance
with the subjects treated:

Twenty-three papers by members of the staff, based upon Museum
material, have, with the approval of the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, been printed during the year in publications other than
those of the Museum. Their titles will be found in the bibliography.
The names of the authors are as follows: Dr. George P. Merrill, Mr.
Gerrit S. Miller, jr., Dr. J. N. Rose, Mr. William R. Maxon, Mr.
Charles Louis Pollard, Dr. C. W. Richmond, Mr. Charles Schuchert,
and Mr. Charles T. Simpson.

LIBRARY.

The Museum library now contains over 15,000 bound volumes and
27,000 unbound papers. The additions during the year consisted of
337 books, 728 pamphlets, and 4,298 parts of periodicals. There were ~
catalogued 1,005 books, 2,699 pamphlets, and 4,924 parts of periodi-
cals. The number of books, pamphlets, and periodicals borrowed
a

from the central library amounted to 18,500, including 7,000 with-
drawn for assignment to the sectional libraries. of which there are
now 27, as follows:

Administration. Marine invertebrates.
Anthropology. Materia medica.

Biology. Mesozoic fossils.

TAXIDERMY AND OSTEOLOGY.

Owing to the absence in Cuba, during several months, of Mr. William

Palmer, chief taxidermist, and the detail of bis assistant during the
last half of the year to the Division of Mammals, the amount of taxi-
dermiec work accomplished has been less than usual. Sixty-five speci-
mens in the flesh, including 81 mammals, 23 birds, and 11 reptiles,
and also 116 skins of mammals, were received. Many of the fresh
specimens came from the National Zoological Park. ‘Twenty-five
skins were mounted for the exhibition cases and 93 were prepared for
the study series. Many specimens were renovated or remounted for
display purposes.

The taxidermists of the Division of Birds have remade a number of
old skins, besides preparing and mounting several specimens received
in the flesh. They have also reduced some of the mounted specimens
to skins and have overhauled a large portion of the extensive exhibi-
tion series.

The amount of osteological work has also been smaller than usual,
because of the necessity of transferring one of the assistants tempo-
rarily to the Department of Geology. One thousand skulls of mammals
and the skeletons of several mammals and birds received in the flesh
have, however, been cleaned. The large skeleton of the humpback
whale which has been displayed in the Osteological Hall was removed,
and in its place has been substituted the specimen formerly suspended
in the south hall, showing both the skeleton and the exterior.

PHOTOGRAPHY.

Mr. T. W. Smillie, the photographer, reports having made for the
Museum during the year 435 negatives, 644 platinum prints, 175 silver
prints, 1,841 blue prints, and 67 transparencies. In a museum of the
74 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900.

scope and character of this one a great diversity of photographic work
is called for, and it is quite essential that the highest standard of: the
art be attained. In this respect the National Museum has been very
fortunate from the beginning, and the results accomplished have been
all that could be desired, as testified by the many illustrations scattered
through its publications which have been produced through this means.
Mr. Smillie’s time is also partly shared with other branches of the
Institution; and on the Smithsonian eclipse expedition to Wadesboro,
N. C., in May, 1900, he was in immediate charge of the photographic
branch.
EXPOSITIONS.

Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo.—By act of Congress approved
March 3, 1899, the sum of $300,000 was appropriated for a Govern-
ment exhibit at the Pan-American Exposition to be held at Buffalo,
N. Y.. in 1901, besides an additional sum of $200,000 for the erection
of a building. Dr. Frederick W. True, executive curator, has been
designated as the representative of the Smithsonian Institution and its
bureaus on the Government board of management, and Mr. W. V.
Cox as chief special agent. By the close of the past year the plans
for the display on the part of the Museum had been essentially com-
pleted, and the work of bringing together and preparing the neces-
sary collections was being rapidly pushed.

A series of models and original pieces of electrical apparatus belong-
ing to the Henry, Morse, and Farmer collections was sent to the Paris
Exposition of 1900, and several series of exhibits from the Division of
Graphic Arts to the Printing Exposition held in New York City
during the month of May, 1900.

NECROLOGY.

Frank Hamilton Cushing, one of the collaborators in the Division of
Ethnology in the National Museum, died April 10,1900. | He was born
in the village of Northeast, Erie County, Pa., July 22,1857. He took
a deep interest in the study of ethnology and archeology, and began
making collections when but a boy. At the age of 18 he went to Cor-
nell University for the purpose of pursuing a special course in anthro-
pology. In 1876 he was given charge of a portion of the exhibit of
the Smithsonian Institution at the Centennial Exposition in Philadel-
phia, and in 1879 he entered the service of the Smithsonian Bureau of
Ethnology. Mr. Cushing lived for many years among the Indians of
the Southwest, during which time he acquired a thorough knowledge
of their customs, arts, language, religion, and tribal history. In 1887
he organized and conducted important archeological explorations in
the Salado and Gila valleys of Arizona under the auspices of the Hem-
enway Southwestern Archeological Expedition. In 1896 he was placed
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15

in charge of an expedition sent out by the Bureau of Ethnology, in
conjunction with the University of Pennsylvania, to explore the
antiquities of the west coast of Florida. This work resulted in most
important discoveries, partially reported upon in the Proceedings of
the American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, for 1896. Among
the works bearing on his explorations in Arizona that entitled ‘* Out-
lines of Zuni Creation Myths,” published in the Thirteenth Annual
Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, is one of the most important. In
the second annual report an interesting paper on ‘* Zuni Fetiches”
appeared. Many of the articles on various phases of his explorations
were published in periodicals from time to time, but it is a matter of
regret that his early death precludes the possibility of publishing a
large amount of material which he had brought together.

Mr. A. Zeno Shindler, who died August 18, 1899, was connected
with the National Museum for many years as an artist. He was
engaged largely upon ethnological work and produced a number of
portrait studies of the peoples of the world, but his most notable
service was in painting casts of fishes, reptiles, and other natural history
specimens.

by the fossil plants.

19th Ann. Rep. U. S. Geol. Surv., Part 0,
1899, pp. 521-946, pls. LVII-CLX XII.

This paper was prepared in collaboration
with Walter P. Jenney, William M. Fontaine,
and F. H. Knowlton.

The specimens described are in the Museum
collection. Theyinclude 86 species, and are
from the lower part of the Cretaceous forma- |
tion, from the beds that extend down from
the Dakota group to the upper part of the
Jurassic. One new genus and 36 new species ~
are described.

This paper is based partly upon Museum
material. The locality of the specimens de-
scribed is given as the Freezeout Hills, north
of Medicine Bow, in Carbon County, Wyo.
The new genus to which the 20 species are
referred is Cycadella.

from the McAlester coal field, Indian |

19th Ann. Rep. U. S. Geol. Surv., Part 111,
1899, pp. 457-538, pls. LX VII, LX VIII.

The collections, which include about 75 spe-
cies, were made at thirteen localities. They
have been arranged in three groups; First,
that from the horizon of the McAlester coal;
second, a group from about 2,000 feet above the
McAlester coal: and third, a group of localities
from which a flora was collected belonging
to a coal horizon about 1,500 feet below the |
McAlester coal. Comparing these with the ;
Carboniferous divisions of the Old World, the |
McAlester flora is said to be clearly Stephan-
ian and comparable to the flora of the Upper
Coal Measures of Great Britain. The upper
group belongs to a horizon some distance
below the Permian, while the lower flora is
plainly Westphalian, having close relations
with the Middle or Lower Coal Measures of
Great Britain. The fossil floras indicate a |
very great expansion of the coal measures in
Indian Territory.

Lower coal measures of Missouri.

The greater portion of the specimens de-
scribed in this paper were derived from two
horizons about 45 feet apart. The plants
described are concluded to be contempora-
neous with the flora of the uppermost zone of
the Westphalian of the Franco-Belgian Basin,
and other coal fields of Europe.
