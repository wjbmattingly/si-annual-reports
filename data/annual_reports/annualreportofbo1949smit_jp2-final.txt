REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE SMITH-
SONIAN INSTITUTION

ALEXANDER WETMORE
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1949

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith my report show-
ing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and
its bureaus during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1949.

GENERAL STATEMENT

The Institution continued vigorously to pursue its program of
activities in “‘the increase and diffusion of knowledge” as stipulated
by its founder, James Smithson. The increase of knowledge is fos-
tered by original scientific researches and explorations in the fields
of anthropology, biology, geology, and astrophysics; the diffusion of
knowledge, by publications in a number of series that are distributed
free to libraries and educational institutions throughout the world,
by extensive museum and art gallery exhibits, by the International
Exchange Service for the world-wide interchange of scientific and
governmental publications, and by a large correspondence, both
national and international.

I present first certain general features of the year’s activities,
together with a summary of the work of the several bureaus of the
Institution, to afford a concise picture of the events of the year.
Next follow appendixes containing more detailed reports on each
bureau, and finally there appears the financial statement of the Execu-
tive Committee of the Board of Regents. The appendixes contain
reports on the United States National Museum, the National Gallery
of Art, the National Collection of Fine Arts, the Freer Gallery of
Art, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the International Exchange
Service, the National Zoological Park, the Astrophysical Observatory,
the National Air Museum, the Canai Zone Biological Area, the Smith-
sonian library, and the publications of the Institution.

2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

When the Smithsonian Institution began its operations more than
one hundred years ago, it carried on its research programs largely by
subsidizing the work of scientists not on its own staff, and by publish-
ing the results of their work. As these pioneer researches expanded
in scope and became somewhat stabilized, bureaus gradually grew up
around the Institution, each with its own staff specializing in the
work of that particular field. The value of the various activities
gradually became known to the Nation, and eventually one by one
they were recognized as public necessities by the Congress. Most of
them are now supported largely by Government funds although re-
maining under Smithsonian direction. At present, nearly all the
research and exploration of the Institution is done through these
bureaus, notably the United States National Museum, the Bureau
of American Ethnology, and the Astrophysical Observatory.

As stated in last year’s report, the Institution has for many years
operated under the handicap of shortages of personnel and of ade-
quate housing space. I reported that the Smithsonian Institution
has today the same amount of space that it had in 1911 in which to
accommodate four times as many visitors and four times as many
museum specimens. Much the same condition still prevails. Some
slight gain was apparent in personnel in a few of the scientific divi-
sions, but not sufficient for the prompt execution of essential cura-
torial work and adequate research on the National collections. The
crowded condition, particularly in the buildings of the National
Museum, remained unalleviated. In the report of the Director of
the Museum it will be noted that there is a considerable decrease in
number of specimens accessioned during the year, a decrease which,
he says, “may be attributed in part to the inadequacy of available
storage facilities for the preservation of such materials.”” More ade-
quate building space is one of our major needs.

Though hampered by space conditions it should be brought to
attention that the Smithsonian Institution continues to grow and to
expand its usefulness year by year. In the 5 years during which I
have served as Secretary, three additional activities have been added
to its responsibilities—the Canal Zone Biological Area, the National
Air Museum, and the River Basin Surveys, the latter a unit of the
Bureau of American Ethnology. The work of these new activities
has notably augmented Smithsonian efforts toward the increase and
diffusion of knowledge in widely diversified fields, as will be seen in
reading the detailed reports appended hereto. The purpose in calling
attention to deficiencies is to emphasize the obvious fact that a growing
SECRETARY’S REPORT 3

institution such as the Smithsonian, of so vital interest and importance
to the American people, must receive increased financial support if
it is to continue to meet its full obligations and to further the high
ideals of its founder, James Smithson, who left his entire fortune in
trust to the United States of America for the benefit of all mankind;

PRESENTATION OF THE WRIGHT BROTHERS’ AEROPLANE OF 1903
TO THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

On December 17, 1948, the forty-fifth anniversary of the first flight
by Wilbur and Orville Wright at Kitty Hawk, N. C., the original
aeroplane that made that historic flight became the property of the
American people. At a formal ceremony in the Museum attended
by many high civil and military officials the plane was presented to
the United States National Museum by Milton Wright on behalf of
the estate of Orville Wright.

The story of the plane goes back to December 17, 1903, when the
Wright Brothers were ready after several years of research and
experiment to test out their gasoline-engine-powered biplane at
Kitty Hawk on the coast of North Carolina. With Orville at the
controls, the machine was released, and after a 40-foot run on the
launching track, it lifted into the air in full flight. In Orville Wright’s
own words:

“The flight lasted only 12 seconds, but it was nevertheless the first
in the history of the world in which a machine carrying a man had
raised itself by its own power into the air in full flight, had sailed
forward without reduction of speed, and had finally landed at a point
as high as that from which it started.”

Three more flights were made the same day, but after the last
flight a strong gust of wind turned the plane over, damaging it so
badly that no more trials were made that year. The damaged
machine and engine were sent back to the Wrights’ workshop in
Dayton, and 13 years later were restored, using all the original parts
available. The aeroplane was displayed at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and later at several aeronautical exhibitions.
In 1928 Orville Wright had it sent as a loan to the Science Museum
at South Kensington, London, England, where it remained on exhibi-
tion until World War II. Owing to the danger of damage by bomb-
ing, the plane was removed to a safe place for the duration of the war,

When Orville Wright died on January 30, 1948, it was learned
from papers in his files that he wished the Kitty Hawk aeroplane to
be returned to the United States and placed in the National Museum.
The executors of his estate conferred with officials of the Science
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

Museum and of the Smithsonian Institution, and with the generous
cooperation of the British Government the actual transfer of the
plane took place in November 1948. It was brought across the
Atlantic to Halifax on the Mauretania, from there to Bayonne,
N.J., on the Navy carrier Palau, and to Washington by Navy truck.

At the formal presentation on December 17, 1948, the ceremonies
were opened by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. After
the invocation by Maj. Gen. Luther D. Miller, Chief of Chaplains,
Department of the Army, and greetings by the Presiding Officer,
Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, Chancellor of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, a message from the President of the United States was read by
Col. Robert B. Landry, Air Force Aide to the President. His Britan-
nic Majesty’s Ambassador, Sir Oliver Franks, K. C. B., C. B. E.,
then spoke on “Britain and the Wright Brothers,” after which the
presentation of the aeroplane was made by Milton Wright, of Dayton,
Ohio, on behalf of the estate of Orville Wright. Mr. Wright told of
his boyhood recollections of his uncles’ bicycle shop where the Kitty
Hawk plane was fabricated, and concluded thus:

“The aeroplane means many things to many people. To some it
may be a vehicle for romantic adventure or simply quick transporta-
tion. To others it may be a military weapon or a means of relieving
suffermg. To me it represents the fabric, the glue, the spruce, the
sheet metal, and the wire which, put together under commonplace
circumstances but with knowledge and skill, gave substance to
dreams and fulfillment to hopes.”

The aeroplane was accepted on behalf of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion by Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, Chancellor of the Institution,
and the address of acceptance was given by Vice President-Elect
Alben W. Barkley, a regent of the Institution. In the course of his
address Mr. Barkley expressed one thought that doubtless was in the
minds of all participants in the ceremony:

“Tt is a matter of deep regret to all of us that Orville Wright could
not have been here today to see this wide public recognition of achieve-
ment, and receive in person the fitting acclaim to his brother, to
himself, and to their Kitty Hawk plane. We are grateful to all of
those who have made it possible to bring the plane back to its native
soil, and especially to the heirs of the estate of Orville Wright, for
depositing the Kitty Hawk machine here where all America will have
an opportunity to see it, and where all may do it fitting honor.”

The Kitty Hawk aeroplane now hangs suspended from the ceiling
of the north hall of the National Museum’s Aris and Industries
Building, where the presentation ceremony was held. Directly back
of the main entrance, the plane is the first object to meet the eyes of
SECRETARY'S REPORT 5

the thousands of visitors who throng the Museum daily. As thus
displayed it bears the following label:

“The first flight lasted only twelve seconds, a flight very modest compared
with that of birds, but it was nevertheless the first in the history of the world in
which a machine carrying a man had raised itself by its own power into the air
in free flight, had sailed forward on a level course without reduction of speed, and
had finally landed without being wrecked. The second and third flights were a
little longer, and the fourth lasted 59 seconds covering a distance of 852 feet over
the ground against a 20 mile wind.’”’— WI.LzBur and OrviILLE WRIGHT.

(From Century Magazine, vol. 76, September 1908, p. 649.)

This is not the final resting place of the plane, however—it is
destined eventually to occupy the place of honer in the National Air
Museum, the most recent bureau of the Smithsonian Institution.
Preliminary plans for the Air Museum envision a special centrally
located exhibit area for the Wright aeroplane of 1903, to serve as a
memorial to the birth of aviation.

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of England,
who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America
“to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.’ In receiving the property and accepting the trust,
Congress determined that the Federal Government was without
authority to administer the trust directly, and, therefore, constituted
an “establishment”? whose statutory members are “the President,
the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive
departments.”
6 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The following changes occurred during the year in the personnel of
the Board of Regents:

On January 20, 1949, Vice President Alben W. Barkley (formerly a
regent by appointment from the Senate) became ‘ex officio a member
of the Board.

On February 14, 1949, the following regents were appointed from
the House of Representatives: Clarence Cannon of Missouri; John M.
Vorys of Ohio; and E. E. Cox of Georgia to succeed Samuel K.
McConnell of Pennsylvania.

On March 8, 1949, Senators Leverett Saltonstall and Clinton P.
Anderson were appointed to succeed Vice President Alben W. Barkley
who became an ex officio member of the Board, and Senator Wallace
H. White of Maine, retired.

On March 10, 1949, Dr. Jerome C. Hunsaker was appointed a citizen
regent from Massachusetts for the statutory term of 6 years, to succeed
Frederic C. Walcott, retired.

The roll of regents at the close of the fiscal year, June 30, 1949,
was as follows:

Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, Chancellor; Vice President Alben W.
Barkley; members from the Senate: Walter F. George, Clinton P.
Anderson, Leverett Saltonstall; members from the House of Repre-
sentatives: Clarence Cannon, John M. Vorys, E. E. Cox; citizen mem-
bers: Harvey N. Davis, Arthur H. Compton, Vannevar Bush, Robert
V. Fleming, and Jerome C. Hunsaker.

Proceedings —The Board of Regents held its annual meeting on
January 14,1949. Present: Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, Chancellor;
Representative Clarence Cannon, Representative John M. Vorys,
Dr. Arthur H. Compton, Dr. Harvey N. Davis, Dr. Robert V. Flem-
ing, Secretary Alexander Wetmore, and Assistant Secretary John E.
Graf.

The Secretary presented his annual report covering the activities
of the Institution and its bureaus, including the financial report of the
Executive Committee, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1948, which
was accepted by the Board. The usual resolution authorizing the
expenditure by the Secretary of the income of the Institution for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1950, was adopted by the Board.

It was announced that in support of the work of the Astrophysical
Observatory John A. Roebling had made a further generous gift
which is of major importance in carrying on these scientific investi-
gations.

The annual report of the Smithonsian Art Commission was pre-
sented by the Secretary and accepted by the Board. A resolution was
adopted to reelect the following members for 4-year terms: Archibald
SECRETARY’S REPORT vA

G. Wenley, David E. Finley, Eugene E. Speicher, Paul Manship.
The following officers were reelected for the ensuing year: Chairman,
Paul Manship; vice chairman, Robert Woods Bliss; secretary,
Alexander Wetmore.

The Board was advised that in an attempt to recover the Gellatly
art collection from the Secretary in his status of a private individual,
though acting as custodian under the Smithsonian Institution, Mrs.
Charlayne Gellatly’s attorneys had filed action in the District Court
of the United States for the District of Columbia on June 18, 1947.
Under date of June 17, 1948, Judge J. McGuire rendered a decision
that, in the opinion of the Court, there was no merit in Mrs. Gellatly’s
claims, since it was found that there was a valid gift to the United
States by the deceased, John Gellatly, before his death and before his
marriage. On July 19, 1948, the attorney for Mrs. Gellatly filed notice
of appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia. Marvin C. Taylor, special attorney, Department of
Justice, represented the Institution.

On the evening of March 1, 1949, an informal meeting of the Board
was held at dinner in the Main Hall of the Smithsonian Building, with
the Chancellor, Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, presiding. At this
meeting heads of the various activities under the Institution pre-
sented statements relative to their work. These statements, with the
ensuing discussion, provided a general view of the existing operations
of the Smithsonian, particularly in the research field.

FINANCES

A statement on finances, dealing particularly with Smithsonian
private funds, will be found in the report of the Executive Committee
of the Board of Regents, page 143.

In addition $1,073,500 was appropriated to the National Gallery of
Art, a bureau of the Institution but administered by a separate board
of trustees; and $528,848 was provided in the District of Columbia
appropriation act for the operation of the National Zoological Park.

Besides these direct appropriations, the Institution received funds
by transfer from other Federal agencies, as follows:

From the State Department, from the appropriation Cooperation
with the American Republics, 1949, a total of $97,900 for the operation
of the Institute of Social Anthropology, including the issuance of
publications resulting from its work.

From the National Park Service, Interior Department, $118,500
for archeological projects in connection with River Basin Surveys.

SIXTEENTH JAMES ARTHUR ANNUAL LECTURE ON THE SUN

In 1931 the Institution received a bequest from James Arthur, of
New York, a part of the income from which was to be used for an
annual lecture on some aspect of the study of the sun.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 9

The sixteenth Arthur lecture was given in the auditorium of the
National Museum on April 14, 1949, by Sir Harold Spencer Jones,
Astronomer Royal of Great Britain, the arrangements being made
through Dr. S. A. Mitchell, of the Leander McCormick Observ-
atory, University of Virginia. The title of Sir Harold’s lecture was,
“The Determination of Precise Time,” a subject on which he is a
world authority. His lecture will be published in full in the Annual
Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution for 1949.

SUMMARY OF THE YEAR’S?ACTIVITIES OF THE BRANCHES OF
THE INSTITUTION

National Museum.—Approximately 446,000 specimens were added
to the collections, for the most part as gifts or as transfers from Gov-
ernment agencies, bringing the total number of catalog entries to
31,679,046. Outstanding accessions for the year included: In an-
thropology, an important collection of 51 artifacts representing the
work of American Indians, Eskimo of Alaska, and natives of Pacific
islands, given by Georgetown University; 17 gold-embossed silver
vessels given by the Government of Tibet to President Truman and
in turn presented by him to the Smithsonian Institution; and valu-
able skeletal remains recovered in northern Australia by Frank M.
Setzler, a member of the Commonwealth of Australia-National Geo-
graphic Society-Smithsonian Institution Expedition to Arnhem
Land; in zoology, mammal specimens from many distant parts of the
world including Northern Territory of Australia, Nepal, Malay Pen-
insula, Korea, Okinawa, Philippine Islands, and New Guinea, 778
birds from Arnhem Land, Australia, and 1,164 from India and Nepal,
14,000 fishes from the Solomon Islands and the East Indies, and
5,000 from the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea; in botany, 2,382 plants
of Fiji, 5,854 plants of Colombia, and 2,157 plants of China; in geology,
20 kinds of minerals hitherto unrepresented in the National collec-
tions, a 42-carat brazilianite gemstone, the largest ever found in
Brazil, an 8,750-gram stony meteorite that fell at Girgenti, Italy, and
many thousands of fossil specimens collected by staff members in
various parts of the United States; in engineering and industries,
the original Wright Brothers’ aeroplane of 1903, a collection of elec-
trical measuring instruments, early lamps, and electronic tubes, some
of them made in the 1880’s, and an exhibit showing the development
of electric hearing aids; in history, a group of relics bequeathed by
Gen. John J. Pershing, including uniforms, flags, and medals, a note-
worthy collection of European gold and silver coins from the four-
teenth to the twentieth century presented by Paul A. Straub, of
New York City, and a complete set of Allied military currency pre-
sented by the Department of the Army.
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

Field work was conducted in Arnhem Land in northern Australia,
India and Nepal, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, New Zealand,
the Canadian Arctic, nine different countries in South and Central
America, and many parts of the United States. The Museum pub-
lished its Annual Report, 3 Bulletins, 25 Proceedings papers, and 2
papers in the Contributions from the United States National Herbar-
ium. The division of history was elevated to the status of a full
department of the Museum, with five divisions—military history,
naval history, civil history, numismatics, and philately.

National Gallery of Art——During the year there were 1,529,568
visitors to the Gallery, an average daily attendance of 4,225. Acces-
sions as gifts, loans, or deposits numbered 1,174, including 10 paint-
ings and 50 prints and drawings from the estate of the late R. Horace
Gallatin, and 891 prints and drawings from Lessing J. Rosenwald.
Eleven special exhibitions were held at the Gallery, and two traveling
exhibitions were circulated to art galleries, museums, and other organ-
izations throughout the country. In response to inquiries received
by the Gallery, nearly 1,000 research problems requiring reports were
investigated, and advice was given regarding 233 works of art brought
to the Gallery for opinion. Numerous books and articles on art sub-
jects were published by staff members. New publications continued
to be added to the literature available at the Gallery for purchase by
the public. Some 15,000 persons attended the special tours of the
Gallery, 20,000 the “Picture of the Week” talks, and 18,000 the lec-
tures in the auditorium. The Gallery’s collections of art works has
grown so fast that all available exhibition space was in use during
the year. To provide for expansion, contracts have been let for the
completion of 12 more galleries in unfinished areas of the Gallery
building. ‘Some 50,000 persons attended the 46 Sunday evening
concerts given in the Gallery’s East Garden Court.

National Collection of Fine Arts.—At the annual meeting of the
Smithsonian Art Commission of December 7, 1948, a number of
paintings were accepted for the National Collection. The Commis-
sion passed a resolution calling attention to the inadequacy of the
present art exhibition facilities in the National Museum and recom-
mending that the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution take action
to provide proper space for the preservation and exhibition to the
public of the National Collection of Fine Arts. Two miniatures were
acquired through the Catherine Walden Myer fund. Under the
provisions of the Ranger bequest, seven paintings temporarily as-
signed to various art institutions were recalled for final consideration
by the Smithsonian Art Commission. Two of these paintings were
accepted for the National Collection, and the others were returned
to the institutions to which they were originally assigned. A large
SECRETARY'S REPORT 11

amount of information on art subjects was furnished to visitors in
person, as well as by mail and phone. Members of the staff lectured
on art topics to several organizations, and six special art exhibitions
were held during the year, for most of which catalogs were furnished
by the organizations sponsoring the exhibitions.

Freer Gallery of Art.—Additions to the collections included Chinese
bronze, jade, lacquer, marble, and painting; Syrian glass; Syrian or
Egyptian gold; Arabic manuscript; Persian manuscript, painting, and
stone sculpture; Indian painting; and Turkish painting. The work
of the professional staff was devoted to the study of new accessions
and to research within the collection of Chinese, Japanese, Iranian,
Arabic, and Indian materials. Reports were made upon 2,563 objects
and 372 photographs of objects submitted to the Gallery for examina-
tion, and 369 Oriental language inscriptions were translated. The
repair and restoration of the walls of Whistler’s Peacock Room were
completed early in the year, and work was begun on the ceiling.
Visitors to the Gallery numbered 74,846 for the year, and 1,724 came
to the Gallery offices for special purposes. Sixteen groups were given
instruction in the exhibition galleries by staff members, and 13 lec-
tures were given in art galleries and museums, before clubs, and to
various associations.

Bureau of American Ethnology.—Dr. M. W. Stirling, Director of
the Bureau, devoted 4 months to a continuation of his archeological
work in Panamdé in cooperation with the National Geographic Society.
Heretofore undescribed ceramic cultures were found at Utivé and
Barriles, and much new information was obtained on the classic
Chiriqui and Veraguas cultures. Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr.,
continued to direct from Washington the very extensive operations
of the River Basin Surveys, a unit of the Bureau created to rescue
important archeological sites threatened by the construction of dams
and the creation of river basin reservoirs. ‘The work was done in
cooperation with the National Park Service, the Bureau of Reclama-
tion, the Army Corps of Engineers, and local organizations. Surveys
of threatened sites covered 69 reservoir areas in 21 States. Since
the program started, 2,107 archeological sites have been located and
recorded, and of these, 456 have been recommended for excavation
or testing before they are destroyed by construction work. Dr.
John P. Harrington continued his revision of the Maya grammar.
Toward the end of the year he went to Old Town, Maine, to pursue
ethnological and linguistic studies on the Abnaki Indians. Dr. Henry
B. Collins, Jr., conducted archeological excavations at Frobisher Bay
on Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic. Ruins were found of old
Eskimo semisubterranean houses made of stones, whale bones, and
turf, the evidence showing that the site has been occupied succes-
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

sively by Eskimos of both the prehistoric Dorset and Thule cultures.
Dr. William N. Fenton continued his field work and library research
on the Iroquois Jndians, obtaining the life history of an aged Seneca
and recording Seneca rituals, prayers, and legends. Dr. Gordon R.
Willey devoted the year to studying and writing up the results of
previous field work. His monographic work, “Archeology of the
Florida Gulf Coast,” was completed and at the close of the year was
in process of being published by the Smithsonian Institution.

The Institute of Social Anthropology, an autonomous unit of the
Bureau, is financed by State Department funds to carry out coopera-
tive training in anthropological teaching and research with the other
American republics. Institute staff members, under the directorship
of Dr. George M. Foster, Jr., continued to give courses in anthropology
and to conduct cooperative research and field work in Brazil, Colom-
bia, México, and Pert.

The Bureau published its Annual Report and two Publications of
the Institute of Social Anthropology. The last two volumes of the
Handbook of South American Indians, volumes 5 and 6, were in
press at the close of the year.

International Hxchanges.—The Smithsonian International Exchange
Service is the official United States agency for the interchange of gov-
ernmental and scientific publications between this country and the
other nations of the earth. ‘The Exchange Service handled during the
year a total of 840,125 packages of publications, weighing 796,700
pounds. These figures represent an increase over the previous year
of 80,006 packages, but a decrease of 15,489 pounds in weight, indicat-
ing by the lighter weight per package that most institut'ons have about
completed shipment of material held up during the war. Shipments
are now made to all countries except Rumania, and efforts to resume
exchanges with that country are being continued. The number of
sets of United States official publications sent abroad in exchange for
similar publications of other countries is now 96—58 full and 38
partial sets. There are also sent abroad through the Exchange
Service 81 copies of the Federal Register and 75 copies of the Con-
gressional Record.

National Zoological Park.—The collection was improved during the
year by the addition of a number of rare animals. At the close of the
fiscal year there were 3,724 specimens in the collection, an increase
of 927 over the previous year. These represented 755 different species,
an increase of 65. Among the rare or unusual animals received by
gift, exchange, or purchase were the rare Meller’s chameleon, a
spectacled bear, a pair of pigmy marmosets—smallest of all monkeys,
an African two-horned rhinoceros, a pair of wombats, a pigmy ant-
eater, orang-utans, and chimpanzees. The total number of creatures
SECRETARY'S REPORT 13

born or hatched at the Zoo was 157—56 mammals, 62 birds, and 39
reptiles. Personne! recruitment and training for the organization
progressed satisfactorily, and the most needed repairs and minor im-
provements to buildings and grounds were carried out. The year’s
total of visitors to the Zoo was the largest ever recorded—3,346,050,
an increase of more than 300,000 over the previous year. Groups
from schools, some as far away as Maine, Florida, Texas, and Cali-
fornia, numbered 1,844, aggregating 93,632 individuals.
Astrophysical Observatory.—Year-long tests at the three most
promising sites for a new high-altitude solar observing station indicate
that the best skies prevail at the Clark Mountain, Calif., site, the
second-best site being Pohakuola, Hawaii. Estimates of the cost of
establishing a field station on Clark Mountain, however, proved to be
in excess of available funds, forcing postponement of building opera-
tions. Data and tables were prepared which simplify computations
at the field observing stations by eliminating the tedious curve-plotting
process heretofore used in obtaining the air mass. Daily observations
of the solar constant of radiation were continued at the Montezuma,
Chile, and Table Mountain, Calif., stations. Intercomparisons
between the substandard silver-disk pyrheliometer S. I. No. 5 and the
instruments in use at Miami, Montezuma, and Table Mountain show
no material changes in constants, confirming the adopted scale of
pyrheliometry. Special radiation measurements started in 1945 at
Camp Lee, Va., under contract with the Office of the Quartermaster
General, were continued there, half of the year by the Observatory
and half by the Quartermaster Board; similar measurements were also
made at Miami, Fla., and at Montezuma, Chile. The work of the
Division of Radiation and Organisms has been concerned chiefly with
reorganizing and reequipping the laboratories. Besides new office
space which has been established, five rooms are being converted into
constant-condition rooms for biological experimentation, and four
chemistry laboratories will be available. In addition, a photographic
laboratory, an X-ray room, a cytology laboratory, an electronics
laboratory, and two general laboratories are being arranged.
National Air Museum.—The Air Museum was given the responsi-
bility of receiving, bringing to Washington, and preparing for exhibi-
tion the original Wright Brothers aeroplane of 1903, presented to the
National Museum in December 1948. A storage depot to be used by
the Air Museum until it has a building of its own was acquired in
November 1948 in the former Douglas Aircraft plant at Park Ridge,
Ill. There a field organization was installed, and the Air Museum
assumed custody of the storage facility itself and the large collection
of planes and other aeronautical material stored there by the U. 5S.
Air Force for the Museum. The Advisory Board held three meetings
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

during the year which were devoted mainly to advancing the acquisi-
tion of a building site and a suitable museum building in the Wash-
ington area. The Museum expects during the coming year to sub-
mit to Congress a report regarding sites and a building, the prelim-
inary study of which has been prepared in cooperation with the Public
Buildings Administration. Among outstanding accessions of the
year were the Swoose, the historic B-17—D bomber that served through-
out World War II from Bataan to the defeat of Japan, presented by
the city of Los Angeles; Maj. Alford Williams’ renowned Gulfhawk-2
presented by the Gulf Oil Co.; a Japanese Baka Bomb, or “‘suicide
plane,” transferred by the Department of the Navy; and 10 scale
models of recent types of Naval aircraft received from the manufac-
turers who produced the original planes. New accessions totaled
122 objects from 40 different sources.

Canal Zone Biological Area.—A new building for woodworking and
carpenter shops and for living quarters for the warden-caretaker was
completed during the year, the old quarters being converted into a
two-room laboratory unit. Work on the new 14,000-gallon water
tank was halted by heavy rains but can be completed with 2 or 3
weeks of dry weather. The most urgent needs are the fireproofing of
existing buildings and the construction of a new six-room laboratory
and storage building. Twenty-nine scientists representing many
different organizations worked at the laboratory during the year, and
their contributions have added materially to our knowledge of tropical
life. Among the interesting researches were the work of Drs. Scho-
lander and Walters of the Arctic Research Laboratory at Point Barrow,
Alaska, on the metabolic reactions to temperature in various animals
and plants in order to obtain a tropical counterpart for similar work
on Arctic forms in Alaska; the studies of Drs. Clark and Soper of the
Research Laboratory of Eastman Kodak on the effects of tropical
conditions on photographic equipment and materials, including color
film; and the Resident Manager’s own special studies, particularly the
long-term termite-resistance tests.

PUBLICATIONS

In carrying out the diffusion of knowledge, the Institution issues
eight regular series of publications and six others that appear less fre-
quently. All these series, embodying the results of Smithsonian
researches, are distributed free to more than a thousand libraries,
both here and abroad, as well as to a large list of educational and
scientific organizations. The findings of Smithsonian scientists,
chiefly in the fields of anthropology, biology, geology, and astrophysics,
are therefore made readily available to ali through this wide free
distribution.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 15

A total of 71 separate volumes and pamphlets were issued during the
past year. Among the outstanding publications to appear were Dr.
Henry Field’s compilation in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collec-
tions entitled “Contributions to the Anthropology of the Soviet
Union,’”’ which presents, for the first time in English, accounts of
recent findings in this little-known area; a revised edition of the popu-
Jar handbook of the National Aircraft Collection, which is in effect a
brief history of aeronautics from the mythical flying horses of antiquity
to the supersonic jet planes of today; two more volumes in the famous
series of Life Histories of North American Birds, prepared by A. C.
Bent, bringing to 17 the number so far issued in the series; and a
paper by Jason R. Swallen on new grasses from several countries of
South and Central America, in the Contributions from the United
States National Herbarium.

The total number of copies of publications in all series distributed
during the year was 267,491. A complete list of the year’s publica-
tions will be found in the report of the Chief of the Editorial Division,
Appendix 12.

LIBRARY

Of the 57,671 publications received by the Smithsonian library
during the year, 7,287 came as gifts from many different donors.
Another 17,713 were periodicals mostly received in exchange for
Smithsonian publications from research institutions and other scien-
tific and educational organizations throughout the world. Containing
the record of progress in science and technology, these periodicals are
indispensable in the prosecution of the Institution’s own work.

Increasingly heavy demands upon reading and reference services
of the library were noted during the year, the interlibrary loans total-
ing 2,619 publications to 89 different libraries. The new position of
assistant librarian in charge of the Astrophysical Observatory library
was filled by the promotion of an acquisitions assistant.

New exchanges arranged during the year numbered 338; 6,884
volumes and pamphlets were cataloged, and 31,184 cards were added
to catalogs and shelflists; 1,060 volumes were sent to the bindery,
and 1,026 were repaired in the Museum.

At the close of the year, the library’s holdings totaled 921,206
volumes, more than half of which are housed in the Library of Congress
as the Smithsonian Deposit.

Respectfully submitted.

ALEXANDER WETMORE, Secretary.
APPENDIX 1
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Srr: I have the honor to submit the following report on the condi-
tion and operations of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1949.

COLLECTIONS

Approximately 446,000 specimens (88,000 less than last year)
were incorporated into the National collections during the year and
were distributed among the six departments as follows: Anthropology,
4,099; zoology, 279,621; botany, 38,708; geology, 109,499; engineering
and industries, 2,610; and history, 11,104. The decrease in the number
of specimens accepted for the Museum’s collections may be attributed
in part to the inadequacy of available storage facilities for the preser-
vation of such materials; consequently, a finer screening of collections
from prospective donors is now mandatory. Most of the accessions
were acquired as gifts from individuals or as transfers from Govern-
ment departments and agencies. The complete report on the Museum,
published as a separate document, includes a detailed list of the year’s
acquisitions, of which the more important are summarized below.
Catalog entries in all departments now total 31,679,046.!

Anthropology.—The most noteworthy additions to the archeological
collections were as follows: A black-figured Attic lecythus of the fifth
century, B. C., presented to President Harry S. Truman as a token of
gratitude from the people of Greece and lent by the President; 11
gold-plated ornaments from Veraguas, Panam4é, and 2 gold fishhooks
from Colombia, a gift from Karl P. Curtis; and 47 prehistoric earthen-
ware vessels from the Valley of Nasca, Peri, presented to the late
Gen. John J. Pershing by former Peruvian President Augusto B.
Leguia and donated by General John J. Pershing.

Handicrafts and material culture of many of the world’s peoples
were represented in the additions to the ethnological collections. An
unusually important collection of 51 specimens representing the work
of American tribes of the Great Plains and the Great Lakes, of Arizona
and New Mexico, as well as of the Eskimo of Alaska, of the Igorot of
the Philippine Islands, and of the Marquesans and Maori of the

Southeast Pacific, assembled over a period of more than a century,
was presented by Georgetown University. President Harry 8. Tru-
man presented to the Smithsonian Institution 17 gold-embossed silver
vessels received at the White House as a gift from the Government
of Tibet in appreciation of an American gift of wireless receiving and
transmitting sets made during World War II. Included are two
butter lamps and stands, four teacup stands and covers, two bowls
for grain offerings, one teapot, and two beer mugs, all decorated in
gold-embossed designs derived from Chinese-Tibetan folklore and
Buddhist religious art. A collection of 287 folk, costume, and his-
torical portrait dolls, representing the native dress of peoples of many
lands, was received as a bequest from the late Mrs. Frank Brett Noyes.
The Don Diego Columbus mahogany table, traditionally known as
the writing desk of Diego Columbus, was conditionally bequeathed
by Mrs. Edith Keyes Benton. This table had been preserved for
centuries in the cathedral of Santo Domingo City and was presented
by Archbishop Nouel to Commander Frederick L. Benton, U.S.N., in
recognition of his werk in Santo Domingo during the influenza epidemic
of 1918. One of the rarest of musical instruments, a musical gong,
kyung, carved from white marble, was presented by Ju Whan Lee,
director of the Korean Court Music Conservatory at Seoul, Korea.

The largest accession received by the division of physical anthro-
pology consisted of the skeletal remains recovered in northern Australia
by Frank M. Setzler, a member of the Commonwealth of Australia-
National Geographic Society-Smithsonian Institution Expedition to
Arnhem Land. Australian skeletal material available for study in
the United States is rather limited. Four casts of African fossil
primates, which illustrate certain characteristics of antecedent special-
ization, were also acquired during the year.

Zoology.—The collections made by the Museum staff detailed to the
Arnhem Land field expedition, under the joint sponsorship of the
Commonwealth of Australia, National Geographic Society, and the
Smithsonian Institution, have added many previously unrepresented
forms of animal life to the National collections. These collections
included not only vertebrates but invertebrates as well.

Accessions that enhanced the usefulness of the mammalian collec-
tion came from the Northern Territory of Australia, Nepal, Malay
Peninsula, Korea, Okinawa, Philippine Islands, New Guinea, and New
Hampshire. Field work financed wholly or in part by the W. L.
Abbott fund resulted in the addition of birds not hitherto represented
in the National collection. Included among these accessions were
2,815 skins and 88 eggs of Colombian birds; 900 skins, 24 skeletons, and
2 sets of eggs of Panamanian birds; 778 bird skins, many of which were
not represented in the collection, as well as 51 skeletons and 2 eggs
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

from Arnhem Land, Australia; and 1,164 bird skins procured by the
joint National Geographic Society-Yale University-Smithsonian
Institution Expedition to India and Nepal. Other accessions com-
prised 611 bird skins from Nyasaland: 177 birds and 1 egg from
northeastern Venezuela: 171 bird skins from Pacific War areas; and
125 bird skins from Korea.

Snakes, lizards, and frogs from Arnhem Land, amphibians from
Pert, reptiles and amphibians from Honduras, and a general collection
from Virginia and North Carolina constituted the most important
additions to the herpetological collection.

The most noteworthy accessions received by the division of fishes
were nearly 14,000 specimens from the Solomon Islands and the East
Indies, which were presented by Dr. Wilbert M. Chapman; 14,300
from Arnhem Land; and approximately 5,000 from the Persian Gulf
and the Red Sea, resulting from a survey sponsored by the Arabian-
American Oil Co. Other important collections of fishes came from
Puerto Rico, Panam4, British Columbia, and Florida.

Approximately 25,000 miscellaneous insects from South Pacific
Islands came to the Museum by transfer from the U. S. Commercial
Co. Among other large lots were approximately 12,000 flies; 3,500
chalcidoid wasps; 500 beetles; and some 53,000 insects transferred
from the United States Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine.

During the year considerable significant material was added to the
marine invertebrate collection, of which the most important accessions
were 11,765 miscellaneous invertebrates from the Department of
Zoology, University of California; 70 lots of paratypes, hypotypes,
and topotypes of hydroids from the Allan Hancock Foundation,
University of Southern California; 760 marine invertebrates from
California and Mexicc; 709 specimens from Bahama Islands; 1,781
from Pacific Islands and California; 452 from the Persian Gulf and
the Red Sea; and 859 from Arnhem Land. By transfer from the
Office of Naval Research, the Museum acquired 3,668 invertebrates
from Point Barrow, Alaska. The United States Geological Survey
transferred 568 specimens from the Marianas Islands.

A rare deep-water Pleurotomaria, dredged at a depth of 160 fathoms
off Natal, South Africa, and presented by Dr. Cecil von Bonde, con-
stituted the most notable accession received by the division of
mollusks. From other sources the division received 250 Peruvian
terrestrial and fresh-water mollusks and 540 marine mollusks from
Canton Island, and 150 Japanese land mollusks. Exchanges brought
to the Museum approximately 1,080 shells from Spain and lesser
numbers from South Africa, Italy, and Cuba. By transfer the Museum
received about 1,200 mollusks obtained in the Caroline Islands from
the United States Geological Survey; approximately 30,600 specimens
SECRETARY’S REPORT 19

from the Naval Medical Research Institute; and 600 marine and land
shells of the Solomon Islands from the Naval Medical School. Mem-
bers of the staff obtained about 1,200 mollusks in Arnhem Land and
some 1,500 in the region of the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea.

Botany.—As exchanges, the National Herbarium received 2,382
plants, comprising a collection made in Fiji by Dr. A. C. Smith, from
the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University; 5,854 plants of Colom-
bia from the Facultad de Agronomia, Universidad Nacional, Medellin;
and 2,157 Chinese plants from the National Szechwan University.
The Division of Rubber Plant Investigations, United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture, transferred 865 plants from eastern Colombia.
The Oficina de Estudios Especiales, Mexico City, presented 394
Mexican grasses. A noteworthy gift of 295 ferns of Micronesia came
to the Herbarium from the Bernice P. Bishop Museum, Honolulu, and
Dr. Guanar Degelius, University of Uppsala, presented 602 lichens
from various localities.

Geology.—Gifts and exchanges contributed to the growth of the
mineral collections. More than 20 kinds of minerals hitherto unrepre-
sented in the collections were received. Forty exceptionally good
examples of rare secondary uranium minerals from Katanga, Belgian
Congo, as well as other unusual minerals were added to the Roebling
collection. A fine collection of rare copper sulfates from Chuquicam-
ata, Chile, was presented by the Chile Exploration Co. Included
among the additions to the Canfield collection were a gem-quality
golden beryl crystal weighing over 1,800 grams from Brazil and an
unusually large zircon crystal from Australia. The Chamberlain
bequest provided funds for the purchase of a 42-carat brazilianite
gemstone, the largest as yet found in Brazil. An 8,750-gram stony
meteorite, which fell at Girgenti, Italy, was received as a gift from Dr.
Stuart H. Perry, and other meteorites were acquired either as gifts or
in exchange.

Several large collections of invertebrate fossils were presented to the
Museum, three of the larger lots being 7,500 Middle Ordovician fossils,
mostly bryozoans, from O. C. Cole, Kenyon, Minn.; 2,150 Pennsyl-
vanian fossils from Robert Stark, Grapevine, Tex.; and 10,000 fossil
mollusks from A. L. Bowsher. Types and paratypes of Upper
Cretaceous trilobites, Tertiary mollusks, Pennsylvanian goniatites,
Ordovician invertebrates, and Cretaceous Foraminifera were included
in other accessions. Through funds provided by the Walcott bequest,
the Museum acquired 40,000 invertebrate fossils from the Devonian,
Mississippian, and Pennsylvanian deposits in west Texas, New
Mexico, and Arizona collected by Associate Curator A. L. Bowsher
and William Allen; 25,000 Paleozoic fossils from Texas and Oklahoma
collected by Curator G. A. Cooper and Associate Curator A. R.
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

Loeblich; 2,500 Middle Ordovician fossils collected by Dr. Cooper in
Tennessee and Virginia; and 2,000 Permian and Jurassic ammonites
and brachiopods from Sicily. As usual the year’s accessions included
a number of transfers from the United States Geological Survey.

A nearly complete skeleton of the Triassic phytosaur Machaero-
prosopus gregori, from the Chinle formation near St. Johns, Ariz.,
excavated and transferred to the Museum by the United States Geo-
logical Survey, constitutes the outstanding acquisition of the year in
vertebrate paleontology. Through the Walcott funds there were
received articulated skeletal remains of the condylarth Meniscotherium
robustum and the complete skeleton of a large ichthyodectid fish.
Outstanding gifts include specimens of the Devonian arthrodiran fish
Hudinichthys terrilli, a partial skeleton of the Pleistocene jaguar Pan-
thera augusta, an incomplete skull of the Pleistocene walrus Odobenus
virginianus, and a portion of the skull of a Miocene tapir. The
Smithsonian River Basin Surveys transferred mammalian fossils from
Kocene and Oligocene deposits of Wyoming and Montana.

Engineering and industries—The presentation of the historic
aeroplane invented and built by Wilbur and Orville Wright and flown
by them at Kitty Hawk, N. C., on December 17, 1903, was witnessed
by 1,000 or more distinguished guests at the formal ceremony held
in the north entrance hall of the Arts and Industries Building of the
United States National Museum on December 17, 1948. The presen-
tation was made by Milton Wright, of Dayton, Ohio, on behalf of the
estate of Orville Wright. The Chancellor of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, accepted the Wright Brothers’
aeroplane on behalf of the Nation, and the formal acceptance address
was delivered by Vice President-Elect Alben W. Barkley.

A collection of electrical measuring instruments, early lamps, and
electronic tubes, some of which were constructed in the 1880 decade,
was presented by the Weston Electrical Instrument Corp. The
Museum is indebted to the United States Signal Corps Laboratories
for an exhibit illustrating radar and microwave radio-relay communi-
cation. From the Cork Institute of America the section of wood
technology received 100 samples and 9 photographs which illustrate
the production and utilization of cork bark. Etchings and serigraphs
by Forain, Margo, Velonis, Detwiller, and Kainen were added to the
graphic arts collection through the Dahlgreen fund. A Marcy
Sciopticon Magic Lantern, a kerosene-lamp projector, patented
1868-69, was the most interesting accession in the photographic
section. The division of medicine and public health received from
Telex, Inc., a number of devices that show the development of electric
hearing aids.
SECRETARY’S REPORT Zi

History.—Several unusual items were added during the past year
to the National collection of American antiques and personal relics,
and of these the spirit set and silverware owned by the Maryland
surveyor Andrew Ellicott (1754-1820) are the oldest. A marble slab
from the Temple of Wingless Victory on the Athens Acropolis, pre-
sented to President Truman by a Greek delegation on March 28, 1949,
as a token of gratitude from the people of Greece, was lent by the
President. The most interesting additions to the costumes collection
were a parasol made of pheasant feathers and an old bonnet of the
type known as ‘‘calash.”’ The outstanding accessions to the military
collection were the relics bequeathed by Gen. John J. Pershing,
comprising personal uniforms, presentation flags, medals, decorations,
and other mementos of his military service. Forty-four portraits of
World War II heroes painted by Joseph Cummings Chase were
presented to the Museum by the artist.

The collection of gold and silver coins, chiefly European issues
dating from the fourteenth to the twentieth century, which was re-
ceived as a gift from Paul A. Straub, of New York City, constitutes
the most noteworthy accession acquired by the division of numismatics
in recent years. A complete set, in duplicate, of Allied military
currency was presented by the Department of the Army.

EXPLORATION AND FIELD WORK

Staff specialists in the departments of anthropology, zoology,
botany, and geology were engaged during the year in field work in
South, Central, and North America, New Zealand, and Australia.

The four staff members—Frank M. Setzler, head curator of anthro-
pology; Dr. David H. Johnson, associate curator of mammals;
Herbert G. Deignan, associate curator of birds; and Dr. Robert R.
Miller, associate curator of fishes—who participated in the technical
work of the Commonwealth of Australia-National Geographic
Society-Smithsonian Institution Expedition to Arnhem Land under
' the leadership of Charles P. Mountford, returned to Washington,
D. C., late in 1948 following completion of the field work. The base
camp of the expedition, which had been established April 4, 1948, on
Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria, was moved during July
1948 to Yirrkala on the beach of Arafura Sea near the northeastern
corner of Arnhem Land. A third camp was established September
21, 1948, at Oenpelli on East Alligator River near the foot of the high
Arnhem Land escarpment. The entire party returned to Darwin in
November to pack the collections and field equipment for shipment
to the participating institutions.
IY ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

During the first 3 months of 1949, Dr. T. Dale Stewart, curator of
physical anthropology, was engaged in taking anthropometric meas-
urements of some 200 Mayan-speaking Indians in the highlands of
Guatemala. Most of this field study was carried on at Soloma in the
Department of Huehuetenango, and at Santa Clara la Laguna in the
Department of Solol4. A secondary project was the examination of
skeletal remains at archeological sites in the highlands.

As in the previous year, Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, associate curator of
archeology, was detailed to the River Basin Surveys under the
Bureau of American Ethnology to supervise field and laboratory
operations in the Missouri Valley.

The National Geographic Society-Yale University-Smithsonian
Institution Expedition to India and Nepal, which was directed by
S. Dillon Ripley, brought back important collections of birds and
mammals from the Karnali Valley in western Nepal and the Kosi
Valley in eastern Nepal—regions rarely visited by naturalists.

For 5 months during the middle of 1948, Donald S. Erdman, divi-
sion of fishes, participated in a fishery survey in the Persian Gulf and
Red Sea under the auspices of the Arabian-American Oil Co.

At the invitation of the Plywoods-Plastics Corp., Dr. Henry W.
Setzer, associate curator, division of mammals, worked in Costa Rica
and obtained specimens of mammals and birds in the valleys of the
Rio Estrella and the Rio Turrialba.

Dr. A. Wetmore and W. M. Perrygo conducted ornithological field
work in the eastern section of the Province of Panam4, Republic of
Panama, a region they had not explored on previous trips. The field
work of M. A. Carriker, Jr., in the Rio Sint region of northwestern
Colombia, resulted in the preparation of one of the most complete
collections of birds thus far obtained in the area adjacent to Panama.
Charles O. Handley, Jr., temporarily employed as assistant curator of
birds, departed from Washington in March 1949 under a cooperative
arrangement with the Weather Bureau to study the birds and mam-
mals in one area of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.

Botanical field projects participated in by the staff included the
following: After adjournment of the Second South American Botan-
ical Congress held at Tucum4n, Argentina, E. P. Killip, head curator
of botany, and Dr. Lyman B. Smith, associate curator of phanero-
gams, made collections in northwestern Argentina; large numbers of
plants were assembled by Mr. Killip in the Santiago-Valparaiso
region of Chile, and other specimens were subsequently obtained at
Cali, Medellin, and Bogota, Colombia; Dr. Smith collected plants in
the vicinity of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Following the adjournment of the Seventh Pacific Science Congress
held between February 2 and 22, 1949, Dr. E. H. Walker, associate
SECRETARY’S REPORT 23

curator of phanerogams, remained in New Zealand for about 6 weeks
at the invitation of the University of New Zealand to carry on botan-
ical field work on the two main islands and on Stewart Island. Jason
R. Swallen, curator of grasses, at the request of Dr. C. L. Lundell,
director of the Texas Research Foundation, made a survey of the
grasses of the Kingsville region, Texas. George A. Llano, associate
curator of cryptogams, is making a special study of the ecology of the
lichens of the Arctic slopes of the Brooks Mountains in northern
Alaska under a project sponsored by the Arctic Institute of North
America. Paul S. Conger, associate curator of diatoms, devoted 2
months during the summer of 1948 to an investigation of the ecology
of diatoms at the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory, Solomons Island,
Md. Research Associate F. A. McClure continued his field studies of
American bamboos in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Puerto
Rico, Jamaica, and Trinidad.

A wide variety of paleontological field work financed by the Walcott
bequest enabled the staff to obtain new materials for the collections.
Included among these additions are fossil fishes from the Green River
Eocene beds in northeastern Utah and the Pierre Cretaceous deposits
in eastern Wyoming excavated by Dr. D. H. Dunkle and A. C.
Murray; Eocene mammalian fossils from the Bridger Basin in western
Wyoming collected by Dr. C. L. Gazin; Paleocene mammalian fossils
found by Dr. C. L. Gazin and F. L. Pearce in the San Juan Basin of
northwestern Utah; Permian and Mississippian invertebrate fossils
obtained by Dr. G. A. Cooper and Dr. A. R. Loeblich, Jr., in Texas
and Oklahoma; Devonian, Mississippian, and Pennsylvanian fossils
from New Mexico and Texas collected by A. L. Bowsher and
William Allen; and Jurassic microfossils from Montana, Wyoming,
and South Dakota obtained by Dr. A. R. Loeblich, Jr., and Dr. Ralph
W. Imlay.

PUBLICATIONS

Thirty-one Museum publications were issued during the year: 1
Annual Report, 3 in the Bulletin series, 25 in the Proceedings, and 2
numbers of the Contributions from the United States National Her-
barium. A list of these is given in the complete report on Smithsonian
publications, appendix 12. Especially noteworthy are two numbers
of A. C. Bent’s Life Histories of North American Birds: one on the
nuthatches, wrens, thrashers, and their allies, the other on the thrushes,
kinglets, and their allies—completing 17 volumes in this popular
series. ‘The eighteenth is now in press.

The distribution of volumes and separates to libraries and other
institutions and to individuals aggregated 66,459 copies.

CHANGES IN ORGANIZATION

One important change in the organization of the United States
National Museum was effected during the year. On August 16, 1948,
the division of history was raised to the status of a department.
Charles Carey, who received his first appointment to the Museum
staff on November 2, 1920, was named acting head curator of the
department of history. The functions of this department were allo-
cated to five divisions—military history, naval history, civil history,
numismatics, and philately.

On June 30, 1949, the Government employees on the staff of the
National Gallery of Art totaled 309, as compared with 312 employees
as of June 30, 1948. The United States Civil Service regulations
govern the appointment of employees paid from appropriated public
funds.

Throughout the year a high standard of operation has been main-
tained by all departments of the Gallery in the protection of the
Gallery’s collections of works of art and the maintenance of the
Gallery building and grounds.

APPROPRIATIONS

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1949, the Congress of the United
States appropriated for the National Gallery of Art the sum of
$1,073,500 to be used for salaries and expenses in the operation and
upkeep of the Gallery, the protection and care of works of art, and
administrative and other expenses. This amount includes the regu-
lar appropriation of $966,000, and a supplemental appropriation of
$107,500. The supplemental appropriation was made to provide
$4,600 to meet in part an increase in the rates for electric current,
which could not be foreseen by the Gallery and estimated for at the
time the 1949 budget was submitted to the Congress; and the bal-
ance of $102,900 was necessary to meet the pay increases, effective
July 11, 1948, amounting to $330 per annum to each employee as
authorized by Public Law 900, Hightieth Congress.

From these appropriations the following expenditures and encum-
brances were incurred:

CURATORIAL ACTIVITIES

The Curatorial Department accessioned 1,118 new gifts to the
Gallery during the fiscal year. Advice was given in the case of 233
works of art brought to the Gallery for opinion, and 58 visits were
made by members of the staff in connection with proffered works of art.
Almost 1,000 research problems requiring reports were investigated
in response to inquiries received by the Gallery. During the year,
16 individual lectures were given by members of the curatorial staff,
both at the Gallery and elsewhere. In addition Miss Elizabeth
Mongan gave a seminar at Alverthorpe, Jenkintown, Pa., for Swarth-
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

more College honor students; Charles Seymour, Jr., gave a course
at Johns Hopkins University on Renaissance Art; and Charles M.
Richards gave a survey course on art history under the auspices of
the Department of Agriculture. Miss Mongan also made the
arrangements for Arthur M. Hind’s American lecture tour, in connec-
tion with the publication of Part IT of his ‘‘Harly Italian Engraving,”
under Gallery auspices. Mr. Seymour served on three and Miss
Mongan on two art juries.

Special installations were prepared for: the Michelangelo “David”
lent to the National Gallery of Art through the courtesy of the
Italian Government; 28 pieces of Egyptian sculpture lent to the
Gallery by C. S. Gulbenkian placed on exhibition in January 1949;
and eighteenth-century furniture and books also lent by Mr. Gulben-
kian. The cataloging and filing of photographs in the George Martin
Richter Archive continued to make progress, with the gradual
enlargement of the collection.

Further activities of the department are indicated under the
heading of “‘ Publications.”

RESTORATION AND REPAIR OF WORKS OF ART

Necessary restoration and repair of works of art in the Gallery’s
collections were made by Stephen S. Pichetto, Consultant Restorer
to the Gallery, until his death in January 1949. No successor to
Mr. Pichetto has as yet been appointed, but necessary minor repairs
on the works of art have been continued under the care of Mr.
Pichetto’s residual staff. All work was completed in the Restorer’s
studio in the Gallery, with the exception of the restoration of two
paintings, work on which is being completed in the New York studio
of S. S. Pichetto, Inc.

PUBLICATIONS

During the year Mr. Cairns published two books, ‘‘The Limits
of Art,’’ Pantheon Books, Inc., and ‘‘Legal Philosophy from Plato
to Hegel,” Johns Hopkins Press. He also edited a volume entitled
“Lectures in Criticism,’”’ Pantheon Books, Inc., and contributed an
introduction to ‘“Epicurus, My Master,’’ by Max Radin, University
of North Carolina Press. He also contributed articles and reviews
to the Columbia Law Review, Human Events, Saturday Review
of Literature, New York Herald Tribune, Baltimore Evening Sun,
Law and Contemporary Problems, The Scientific Monthly, and to
the volume El Actual Pensamiento Juridico de los Estados Unidos,
Buenos Aires.

A series of 12 articles on masterpieces in the Gallery, prefaced
by one entitled ‘‘New Friends for Old Masters,” is being published
by John Walker in the Ladies Home Journal. An article by Mr.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 35

Walker, “The Art of Duplicating Great Art,’ appeared in Vogue
on August 15, 1948, and another, ‘‘American Masters in the National
Gallery,” in the National Geographic Magazine in September 1948.
Mr. Walker also contributed two book reviews, the first reviewing
Bernard Berenson’s ‘Aesthetics and History in the Visual Arts”
to the October 1948 Gazette des Beaux-Arts, and the second, entitled
‘The Philosophy of a Connoisseur,’”’ a review of Mr. Berenson’s
‘Sketch for a Self-Portrait,’ to the New York Times for April 24,
1949. Charles Seymour, Jr., published two articles, ‘‘Note on the
Relationship between an Illustration by Travies de Villers and
Daumier’s ‘Le Fardeau’,”’ in the Journal of the Walters Gallery for
1948, and in the Summer Bulletin of the Columbus Gallery of Fine
Arts the text of the address given by him for the inauguration of a group
of sculpture by Georg Ehrlich in the Columbus Gallery of Fine Arts.
Printing of ‘‘Masterpieces of Sculpture from the National Gallery
of Art,’ a volume prepared by Mr. Seymour, was begun during the
summer of 1949. Mrs. Fern R. Shapley has written two book reviews,
a review of Bernard Berenson’s ‘‘ Aesthetics and History’? which is
to be published in the next number of the College Art Journal, and
one on Evelyn Sandberg-Vavala’s ‘Uffizi Studies” published in the
January 1949 Gazette des Beaux-Arts. Miss Elizabeth Mongan
contributed six articles for the volume honoring Paul Sachs; an article
for the Color Print Society on ‘Rockport,’ a colored lithograph
by Stella Drabkin; descriptions of 27 illuminated miniatures to Pro-
fessor Faye for the second edition of Seymour de Ricci’s “Census
of Manuscripts in America.”’ An article on Rowlandson by David
Keppel was published in the winter, 1949, number of The Art Quarterly.
An article by James W. Lane entitled ‘Religious Art Exhibit’
appeared in the Interracial Review, and one on ‘‘Contemporary
Religious Sculpture Exhibition” in the Catholic University Bulletin;
he contributed two book reviews on ‘Van Eyck’s the Holy Lamb,”
by Leo Van Puyvelde, and ‘‘Robert Louis Stevenson,” by David
Daiches, to the Catholic World, and one on ‘‘ American Landscape
Painting,” by Wolfgang Born, to the Magazine of Art. Charles M.
Richards wrote a report on a code for intermuseum loans for the
American Association of Museums.

An illustrated catalog of the Gulbenkian Egyptian sculpture was
issued for the opening of the exhibition, and Mr. Seymour prepared
a pamphlet on the Michelangelo ‘‘ David,” which was placed on sale
during its exhibition. The book of illustrations of the Mellon Collec-
tion went to press in the late spring of 1949; work on the new National
Gallery of Art catalog is at an advanced stage.

The Publications Fund during the past fiscal year has continued to
add new subjects to the supply of inexpensive color reproductions
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

offered to the public, including 11’’ x 14’’ color prints and color
post cards. Five large collotype reproductions supplemented the
already long list of subjects available. A silk-screen print of an
anonymous fifteenth-century colored woodcut from the Rosenwald
Collection was also published.

The Gallery is continuing to meet the demand for illustrated
catalogs of its various collections. The Mellon catalog is in process
of publication, a third printing of the Kress catalog ordered, and a
fifth edition of the Chester Dale catalog was published during the year.

Two new publications were issued this year: an ‘Arts and Crafts
Bibliography,” by Erwin O. Christensen, and a catalog of the ‘‘Egyp-
tian Sculpture from the Gulbenkian Collection.” A group of engraved
Christmas cards was added to the usual series of color and Rosenwald
subjects.

Final negotiations have been made for the printing in gravure of
the book, ‘‘Masterpieces of Sculpture from the National Gallery of
Art,” and it will be available by October 1949; the publisher now
has the final manuscript for ‘‘ Made in America,”’ by Mr. Christensen;
the Gallery received a stock of ‘Popular Art in the United States,”
also by Mr. Christensen, which will go on sale on July 4, 1949; and
“Pictures from America,”’ by John Walker, will shortly be published.

EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM

During the year approximately 15,000 persons attended the Gen-
eral, Congressional, and Special Topic Tours, while over 20,000
attended the Picture of the Week. More than 18,000 came to hear
the lectures and other programs in the auditorium. At least two-
thirds of this lecture audience were regular attendants at these
Sunday afternoon lectures. Many of them brought out-of-town
visitors, and stated that this lecture series was becoming one of the
Capital’s chief Sunday attractions. The motion picture, ‘The
National Gallery of Art,” continues to be popular with clubs, educa-
tional organizations, and similar groups. During the past 12 months,
19 persons borrowed this film.

The publication of the monthly Calendar of Events, announcing
Gallery activities, including notices of exhibitions, lectures, Gallery
talks, tours, and concerts was continued during the year by the
Educational Department. About 3,900 of the Calendar of Events
are mailed each month.

LIBRARY

A total of 288 books, 221 pamphlets, and 31 periodicals were given
to the Gallery; 494 books, 18 pamphlets, and 282 periodicals were
purchased, and 40 subscriptions to periodicals were purchased.
Exchanges with other institutions included 47 books, 114 pamphlets,
SECRETARY'S REPORT 37

13 periodicals, and 420 bulletins. Of the 1,762 books borrowed and
returned during the year, the Library of Congress lent 1,676 books to
the Gallery on the usual interlibrary loan basis, and the remaining
86 books were borrowed from 25 public and university libraries.

INDEX OF AMERICAN DESIGN

During the year the Index of American Design continued to expand
as the result of gifts and exchanges. Three hundred and thirty-six
persons studied Index material at the Gallery; of this number, 301
were new users and 25 revisited the collection for study purposes.
The use of photographs of Index drawings was increased by about
40 percent, with 1,796 photographs being sent out on loan, exchange,
or purchase. Fifty exhibitions of original water-color renderings
were circulated in 25 States.

PRESIDENT TRUMAN’S INAUGURAL RECEPTION

On January 20, 1949, the President’s Inaugural Reception was
held in the National Gallery of Art. The Seventh Street ground
floor and main floor lobbies were especially furnished and decorated
for the occasion; the rotunda and the two garden courts were appro-
priately decorated with flowers; under arrangements made by the
White House staff, a platform was built in the West Sculpture Hall
where the President addressed the guests who could not be received
personally in the West Garden Court. Three sections of the Marine
Band Orchestra played during the reception. The total number of
guests was approximately 8,000.

CUSTODY OF GERMAN PAINTINGS

On April 6, 1949, the Gallery accepted custody of the 97 paintings
from Berlin museums which had been on an exhibition tour of the
United States, part of the group of 202 German paintings stored in
the Gallery building by the Department of the Army from December
1945 to March 1948. After the last exhibition of this collection of
paintings in Toledo, Ohio, the collection was brought to Washington
and stored in the Gallery for about 2 weeks pending final shipping
arrangements. On April 20, 1949, the collection was delivered to
the Army for return to the American Zone in Germany.

The exhibition of the Berlin paintings in 13 museums throughout
the United States resulted in the collection of $303,605.35 through ad-
mission fees and voluntary contributions for the relief of German
children in the American Zone in Germany. ‘These funds were de-
posited with the Gallery and were later disbursed in accordance with
instructions received from the Department of the Army. During the
tour 1,307,001 persons viewed the paintings, in addition to 964,970
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

who saw them during the time the paintings were on exhibition at the
National Gallery of Art in Washington.

CUSTODY OF GERMAN SILVER

On January 7, 1949, the Gallery returned to the Department of the
Army for transport to Germany the 44 sealed cases containing silver-
ware and glassware and belonging to the Hohenzollern family. The
cases had been stored in the Gallery since April 11, 1947.

CUSTODY OF WHITE HOUSE FURNITURE

On November 24, 1948, the Gallery accepted custody of certain
items of paintings, sculpture, and furniture belonging to the White
House for storage in the building until the repairs to the White House
are completed.

Shipments of these items started on December 3, 1948, and con-
tinued for several days thereafter. At the present time there are 76
works of art—paintings and sculpture—stored in the Gallery’s storage
rooms and 25 vanloads of furniture stored in the packing space on the
main floor.

The necessary arrangements for fire prevention, inspection, and
fumigation have been established and are being carried out.

NEW CONSTRUCTION

During the past fiscal year, the Committee on the Building approved
the construction in the southwest moat of a small workroom for the
use of the gardening staff in maintaining and growing certain plants
for the garden courts and landscaping. Later, when funds become
available, it is planned to construct two small greenhouses adjacent
to this workroom.

The growth of the Gallery’s collections of works of art has been so
rapid that all available exhibition space is now being utilized. As a
matter of fact there are already several paintings which cannot be ex-
hibited because there is no space in the present galleries. For this
reason the Committee on the Building recommended that, to take care
of the most urgent needs, the unfinished spaces 61-66 and 68-70, on
the main floor, be completed as soon as funds are available. These
galleries will be used for new acquisitions of paintings in the American
and British schools and will also make possible some rearrangement in
galleries already finished so as to make available additional space
therein.

The Committee on the Building also recommended that the so-called
copyists’ room be finished to furnish office space for the Educational
Department, which is now operating in rather cramped quarters.

Funds have been generously made available from private sources to
complete this work, and contracts have been entered into with Eggers
SECRETARY'S REPORT 39

and Higgins, Architects, and Vermilya-Brown Company, General
Contractors, for the completion of 12 galleries in these unfinished
areas. The floor plan has been approved, and bids are now being taken
from subcontractors. It is anticipated that actual construction will
begin in August 1949 and that the work will be completed by May 1950.

CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE BUILDING

The usual routine work in connection with the care and maintenance
of the building andits mechanical equipment was carried on throughout
the year.

The three older refrigeration compressors were completely dis-
mantled and overhauled, including the purge compressors. Three
chilled-water pumps, including the electric motors, were completely
overhauled and realigned by the mechanical staff. Twelve supply
fans were cleaned and repainted to protect them against corrosion,
The structural steel base for the large 400-horsepower motor driving
No. 2 Worthington refrigeration machine was strengthened in order
that this large motor would remain in alignment. To correct serious
leaks in two of these machines, the technical staff successfully made
and installed the necessary parts.

The cornice metal lining at the top of the exterior wall of the
building developed leaks, and approximately 50 percent of the joints
in the metal lining were cleaned and soldered.

In connection with the Inaugural Reception, the technical staff
installed floodlights on three sides of the building, assisted the person-
nel of the U.S. Army Signal Corps in the installation of a loud-speaker
system on the main floor, and installed extra electric lines and water
lines for the use of the caterer. The maintenance staff erected exten-
sive checking facilities for the proper care of wraps.

Twelve new display cases were constructed by the staff for the
Gulbenkian Exhibition.

Care and improvement of the Gallery grounds and other miscella-
neous work progressed satisfactorily. Potted plants, totaling 2,366,
which were used for decoration in the two garden courts, were grown in
the southwest moat. In addition, over 350 large pots of chrysanthe-
mums were also grown in this moat area, and these plants provided
the decoration for the two garden courts during the months of October
and November.

COMMITTEE OF EXPERT EXAMINERS

During the year the United States Civil Service Commission’s
Committee of Expert Examiners, composed of staff members of the
Gallery, aided in the drafting of standards for Civil Service positions in
which a knowledge of the history of art is a basic requirement. The

866591—50-——4
40 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

Committee also performed preliminary work in the preparation
of the examination announcement for art positions which was dis-
tributed by the Civil Service Commission with a closing date of
April 19, 1949. From this examination registers of eligibles will be
established for appointment to art positions in the Gallery and
elsewhere in the Government. This will give the present incumbents,
most of whom are serving indefinite war-time appointments, an
opportunity to attain permanent status, and will also make available
a greater number of qualified candidates.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

Forty-six Sunday evening concerts were given during the fiscal
year, all concerts being held in the East Garden Court. A Mozart
Festival of six concerts was given in the autumn with the highest
attendance rate for the season. The five Sunday evenings in May
were devoted to the Gallery’s annual American Music Festival. An
estimated 50,000 persons attended these concerts.

During the year the photographic laboratory of the Gallery made
17,709 prints, 1,342 black-and-white slides, 1,005 color slides, 3,873
negatives, in addition to infrared photographs, ultraviolet photographs,
X-rays, and color separation negatives.

A total of 3,500 copies of press releases, 128 special permits to copy
paintings in the National Gallery of Art, and 117 special permits to
photograph in the Gallery were issued during the year.

OTHER GIFTS

Gifts of books on art and related material were made to the Gallery
library during the year by Paul Mellon and others. Gifts of money
during the fiscal year 1949 were made by the Avalon Foundation and
The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, and a cash
bequest was received from the Estate of the late William Nelson
Cromwell.

AUDIT OF PRIVATE FUNDS OF THE GALLERY

An audit of the private funds of the Gallery has been made for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1949, by Price Waterhouse & Co., public
accountants, and the certificate of that company on its examination
of the accounting records maintained for such funds will be forwarded
to the Gallery.

Respectfully submitted.

Wenley, Gifford Beal, and Robert Woods Bliss. Thomas M. Beggs,
Director of the National Collection of Fine Arts, and John E. Graf,
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, were also present.

The Commission recommended the reelection of Archibald G. Wen-
ley, David E. Finley, Eugene E. Speicher, and Paul Manship for the
usual 4-year period.

The following officers were reelected for the ensuing year: Paul Man-
ship, chairman; Robert Woods Bliss, vice chairman; and Dr. Alexander

for the ensuing year: David E. Finley, chairman, Robert Woods Bliss,

ex officio members of the executive committee.

The Secretary summarized the status of exhibition and storage of
the art objects of the National Collection of Fine Arts which at present

is included in the Smithsonian building program, but funds for the
development of plans have not been made available.

The following resolution, offered by Mr. Goodrich, was passed unan-
imously:

Resolved, That whereas the art collections in the custody of the National Collec-

tion of Fine Arts are exhibited in an entirely inadequate manner, the Smithsonian
Art Commission recommends that the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution

The repair and restoration of the walls of the Peacock Room by
James McNeill Whistler, mentioned in last year’s report, were com-
pleted on September 27 and the room was reopened to the public on
October 4. It was closed again the first of the year and on January
7, 1949, the work of repairing and restoring the ceiling was begun.

treating it with moisture-proof wax, and mounting it on a heavy ply-
wood backing. The painting on the wood is then cleaned with the
utmost care, later repaint is removed, gilding and paint are renewed
in areas from which they were gone altogether and the whole thing is
resurfaced. The work is still in progress on a part-time basis by John

This unusually small number of exhibition changes is accounted
for by the lack of a painter in the Gallery.

than the number of titles. The periodicals, including museum publi-
cations, were inventoried, revised, and alphabetically shelved in the
periodical room.

REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Str: I have the honor to submit the following Report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of American
Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1949, conducted in
accordance with the Act of Congress of June 27, 1944, which provides
“* * * for continuing ethnological researches among the Ameri-
can Indians and the natives of Hawaii and the excavation and pres-
ervation of archeologic remains. * * *”

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

At the end of December Dr. M. W. Stirling, Director of the Bureau,
left to continue the cooperative program of archeological work in
Panamé of the National Geographic Society and the Smithsonian
Institution. Excavations were conducted at Utivé in the province of
Panamé, at Barriles and Palo Santo in the province of Chiriqui, and
at three sites midway between Santiago and Soné in the province of
Veraguas. At Utivé and Barriles heretofore undescribed ceramic
cultures were encountered, while at the other sites much new informa-
tion was obtained on the classic Chiriqui and Veraguas cultures. The
expedition received splendid cooperation from Maj. Gen. Willis Hale,
commanding general of the air forces of the Caribbean area, who, in
addition to other assistance, allowed the use of two helicopters for
reconnaissance work in the Utivé-Chepo area. Dr. Stirling returned
to Washington with the Panamanian collections in the middle of
May.

Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., Associate Director of the Bureau
and Director of the River Basin Surveys, devoted the greater part of
his time during the fiscal year to the direction and administration of
the River Basin Surveys. On November 4 and 5, Dr. Roberts
attended the meetings of the American Philosophical Society at
Philadelphia where he presented a paper on the River Basin Surveys
program. From November 22 to 30, Dr. Roberts was at Lincoln,
Nebr., inspecting the field headquarters for the Missouri Basin project.
While at Lincoln he also took part in the Sixth Conference for Plains
Archeology and presided over one of the symposia. During the year
he also served as a member of the executive committee for the Divi-

866591—50-—_5 55
56 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

sion of Anthropology and Psychology, National Research Council.
Dr. Roberts’ report of the work of the River Basin Surveys during
the fiscal year appears in another section of this report.

Dr. John P. Harrington, ethnologist, continued the revision of his
grammar of the Maya language. Study of sources and the vast
literature on the subject shows that there were 10 linguistic stocks in
southern México and Central America that had Maya-style hiero-
glyphic writing. The work also included revision of a previous paper
on Maya hieroglyphs.

A study incident to this Maya work was the determination of the
origin of the word “Maya.” This word appears first in the letter written
by Bartholomew Columbus in 1506 telling of the fourth voyage of
Columbus. The letter employs the spelling “Mayam” which is
clearly derived from the native Maya name for Yucatén, Mayab.

During the winter a paper was prepared on the names “Tiwa”’ and
“Tewa,”’ designations of two languages in New Mexico. Early in the
spring Dr. Harrington prepared a series of six maps of America show-
ing the meanings of State, province, and country names.

On April 14 Dr. Harrington left Washington for Old Town, Maine,
to pursue ethnological and linguistic studies on the Abnaki Indians.
He was engaged in this project at the end of the fiscal year.

Dr. Henry B. Collins left Washington in June for the Arctic, having
been invited by the Canadian Government to conduct archeological
excavations with the assistance of Colin Thacker of the National
Museum of Canada at Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island, where Charles
Francis Hall in 1868 had reported ancient Eskimo house ruins and
where a large group of Eskimo now live. The Eskimo ruins were
found—buried remains of semisubterranean houses made of stones,
whale bones, and turf. Excavation showed that the site had been
occupied successively by Eskimo of both the prehistoric Dorset and
Thule cultures. Comparison with other prehistoric Eskimo sites
indicated that the Dorset phase represented is one of the earliest of
that culture known. The Thule phase, which followed the Dorset, is
likewise early, showing close affinities with northern Alaska, its place
of origin. In addition to the archeological work, measurements were
obtained and photographs taken of 80 adult Eskimo—40 males and
40 females—at Frobisher Bay. This was the first anthropometric
study to be made of the present-day Baffin Island Eskimo.

In Washington Dr. Collins continued as anthropological adviser for
the Encyclopaedia Arctica, which Dr. Vilhjalmur Stefansson is pre-
paring for the Office of Naval Research. Dr. Collins’ term of office as
Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Arctic Institute of North
America terminated at the end of the calendar year 1948, but he con-
tinued as chairman of the directing committee for the Institute’s
SECRETARY’S REPORT 57

Bibliography of Arctic Literature and Roster of Arctic Specialists.
In continuation of the archeological program begun in 1948 Dr.
Collins left Washington in May to conduct excavations at Resolute
Bay, Cornwallis Island, N. W. T., under the joint auspices of the
Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum of Canada.

From July 1 to September 10 Dr. Fenton was engaged in field work
among the Seneca Indians of western New York on a grant from the
Viking Fund of New York City. Working at Quaker Bridge on AI-
legany Indian Reservation, he obtained a life history of an aged Seneca
named Chauncey Johnny John with whom Dr. Fenton has worked
since 1933. Especially fine materials were collected on social organi-
zation, kinship, and age grades. Twelve reels of recordings were
made which included the entire ritual of the Seneca Dark Dance, the
opening address and several long prayers belonging to the Green Corn
Festival, the entire Women’s Rite of Thanksgiving to the cultivated
crops, and an origin legend for the False-face Society in Seneca and
in English.

The Fourth Conference on Iroquois Research, under the direction
of Dr. Fenton, met at Red House, N. Y., October 8-10, to review out-
standing accomplishments in Iroquoian studies in the fields of lin-
guistics, ethnology, and archeology. The Proceedings of the Con-
ference, edited by Dr. Fenton, were issued in mimeograph form by the
Smithsonian Institution.

The project of collecting materials for a political history of the Six
Nations was reported in a general paper to the American Philosophical
Society on November 4. The same research led to examining the
Kirkland Papers in Hamilton College Library, and on December 1
Dr. Fenton addressed the College on its founder: ‘Samuel Kirkland:
Observer, Negotiator, and Educator.” A lecture was given to the
Anthropology Club of Syracuse University, and manuscripts were
examined in local libraries. Work continued in the manuscript col-
lections of the New York Historical Society and at the New York
Public Library. The Massachusetts Archives in the State House,
the Essex Institute in Salem, and the Peabody Museum of Salem were
visited in January. Three reels of the Pickering Papers were com-
pleted and filed. Arrangements were made with Dr. C. M. Barbeau
of the National Museum of Canada for obtaining microfilm of docu-
ments in Canadian libraries for the American Philosophical Society
Library.

During the year Dr. Fenton served as a member of the Language
Panel of the United States National Commission for UNESCO; he
represented the Smithsonian at meetings of the Policy Board of the
United States National Indian Institute, and in subsequent conferences
at the State Department toward a Second Inter-American Confer-
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

ence on Indian Life, for which he prepared a paper. He served as
President of the Anthropological Society of Washington.

Dr. Fenton published several papers on anthropological subjects in
various journals during the year.

The research activities of Dr. Gordon R. Willey, anthropologist,
during the year were confined principally to study of data and mate-
rials previously obtained in the field. They included the final prepa-
ration of a monograph, “Archeology of the Florida Gulf Coast,” a
culmination of studies begun by the Bureau of American Ethnology
as early as 1923, with Dr. Willey engaged on the project since 1940.
The war and other duties interrupted the completion of the manuscript,
but it is now in process of publication by the Smithsonian. Eight
other manuscripts by Dr. Willey are in press or awaiting publication,
and four additional manuscripts are in preparation: ‘‘Ancon-Supe:
Formative Period Sites of Central Pert’ (with J. M. Corbett and
L. M. O’Neale); “Huari, an Important Site in the Central Peruvian
Highlands” (with D. Collier and J. H. Rowe); “Prehistoric Settle-
ment Patterns in the Virt Valley, Pert,” and ‘‘Archaeological Explora-
tions in the Parita Zone, Panama.”

Dr. Willey served in a consultative capacity for the period of final
editing of volumes 5 and 6 of the Handbook of South American Indi-
ans (Bureau Bulletin 143) and also assisted with certain administrative
matters concerned with the Smithsonian River Basin Surveys.

Dr. Willey participated in a series of round-table discussions under
the leadership of Dr. A. L. Kroeber during the months October
through February. These meetings, held at Columbia University,
New York, were concerned with general discussions of anthropological
method and theory. Throughout the year he served as assistant
editor for the Handbook of Latin American Studies of the Library of
Congress Hispanic Foundation. He also served as assistant editor of
the journal American Antiquity, with reference to the South American
area.

From March through May Dr. Willey served as Smithsonian repre-
sentative at several committee meetings of the State Department
Committee for Scientific and Cultural Cooperation, and at an open
meeting of the Caribbean Commission.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

Miss Frances Densmore, collaborator of the Bureau, submitted to
the Bureau a manuscript entitled ‘(Musical Customs of the Indians of
the Parana Delta and La Plata Littoral and the Gran Chaco.”

INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY

The Institute of Social Anthropology was created in 1943 as an
autonomous unit of the Bureau of American Ethnology to carry out
SECRETARY'S REPORT 59

cooperative training in anthropological teaching and research with
the other American republics. During the past year it was financed
by transfers from the Department of State totaling $97,900 from the
appropriation “Cooperation with the American Republics, 1949.”
Long-range planning for the Institute became increasingly difficult
during the year because of threatened budget reductions for the fiscal
year of 1950. Otherwise, the Institute continued to function much
as in previous years, and good work was done by all staff members.
Principal activities were as follow:

Washington office.—Dr. George M. Foster, Director of the Institute
of Social Anthropology, made a 3-weeks trip to Spain in November
1948 to investigate the possibility of ethnographical field work in that
country, with a view to throwing additional light on the development
of the contemporary cultures of Hispanic America. In March 1949
Dr. Foster made a second trip to Spain, serving as Smithsonian
Institution delegate at the centennial celebration of the Royal
Academy of Natural, Exact, and Physical Sciences of Madrid. Dr.
Gordon R. Willey assumed direction of the Institute of Social Anthro-
pology during Dr. Foster’s absence.

Upon the recommendation of the Director a grant-in-aid was ex-
tended by the Department of State to bring Dr. Luis Duque Gémez,
Director of the Instituto Etnolégico y Servicio de Arqueologia of
Bogoté, Colombia, to the United States for a 3-months period, Oc-
tober 1948 to January 1949. An itinerary was arranged by Dr.
Foster whereby Dr. Duque was able to visit the larger universities and
anthropological centers in the United States both in the East and in
the West. Also upon the recommendation of the Director, a like
invitation was extended to Dr. José Cruxent, Director of the Museo de
Ciencias Naturales in Caracas, Venezuela. Dr. Cruxent is expected
to arrive in the United States in August 1949.

Brazil.—Drs. Donald Pierson, sociologist, and Kalervo Oberg, social
anthropologist, continued to give courses at the Escola Livre de
Sociologia e Politica in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Dr. Pierson, assisted by
students from the school, completed field work in the caboclo com-
munity of “A Vila”? near Séo Paulo, and completed a manuscript
describing this work. Dr. Pierson also served as official observer of
the United States Government at the UNESCO Conference held in
Montevideo, Uruguay, September 6-10, 1948, to consider ways and
means of stimulating the development of science in Latin America.
He was brought to the United States at the end of June 1949, for con-
sultation on future plans for work in Brazil. Dr. Oberg spent July
and part of August 1948 in field work among the Indians of the
headwaters of the Xingt River. In June 1949 he left on a 3-months
trip to the Paressi and Nambiquara groups, northwest of Cuiabé in
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

Mato Grosso. On both of these trips he was accompanied by students
from the Escola Livre.

Colombia.—Dr. John H. Rowe returned to the United States from
Popay4n, Colombia, in September to accept a permanent position at
the University of California. Dr. Raymond E. Crist, professor of
geography at the University of Maryland, was employed in February
1949 on a temporary basis to replace Dr. Rowe. In the short time
Dr. Crist has been in Popay4n he has given courses and lectures in the
Universidad del Cauca, dealing with Iberian culture and its dissemina-
tion in the New World, and with geographic methods and theories.
He has made several short field trips to small communities near
Popaydn, and has been host to the American Ambassador, Willard L.
Beaulac, who, with his private party, flew from Bogota for the express
purpose of becoming acquainted with the work of the Institute in
Popayan.

Mézico.—Dr. Isabel Kelly, social anthropologist, continued to repre-
sent the Institute at the Escuela Nacional de Antropologia in Mexico
City, giving anthropology courses and guiding independent research
of students. A part of the spring of 1949 again was spent in the
Totonac area, where final field notes on this group were taken, prepara-
tory to writing a monograph describing the results of three seasons of
work. Dr. Stanley Newman, linguist, resigned from the Institute
in February 1949, to accept a position at the University of New
Mexico. Up to this time be continued his teaching schedule at the
Escuela. His research included investigations of the Otomi and
Nahuatl Indian languages, and participation in the literacy campaign
of the Mexican Government. A significant paper on the Otomi
language was completed, and a major monograph on Nahuatl was
undertaken.

Pert.—Dr. Allan Holmberg resigned from the Institute in August
1948 to accept a permanent position at Cornell University. He was
immediately replaced by Dr. George Kubler, of Yale University, who
arrived in Lima early in September. Dr. Kubler continued teaching
projects in the Instituto de Estudios Etnolégicos, and also gave a
course in the University of San Marcos. He devoted much atten-
tion to the social history of the colonial period in Pert, with particular
emphasis on demography, and shifts in populations during this period.
This work will to a considerable extent close the gap between the
data of archeological studies in the Virti Valley in north Pert, made
by Smithsonian and other scientists, and the contemporary studies
made by Dr. Holmberg and teachers and students of the Instituto
de Estudios Etnolégicos, thus completing one of the longest sequences
of culture history known from any part of the world. Dr. Kubler
made a brief trip in March 1949 to Bogota and Popay4n, to investigate
SECRETARY’S REPORT 61

documents in the Colombian capital dealing with demographic move-
ments on the west coast of South America in colonial times, and to
consult with Dr. Crist on Institute of Social Anthropology matters.
In June 1949 he served as Adviser to the American Delegation at the
Third Annual Interamerican Indian Congress, held in Cuzco.

Publications.—Institute of Social Anthropology Publications Nos.
8 and 9 appeared during the year and Nos. 10, 11, and 12 were in
press. These are listed with the publications of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology.

RIVER BASIN SURVEYS

The River Basin Surveys, organized in 1946 as a unit of the Bureau
of American Ethnology to carry into effect a memorandum of under-
standing between the Smithsonian Institution and the National
Park Service providing for the salvage of archeological and paleon-
tological materials that will be lost as a result of the nation-wide
program for flood control, irrigation, hydroelectric, and navigation
projects sponsored by the Federal Government, continued its opera-
tions during the year. As in the past, the investigations were con-
ducted in cooperation with the National Park Service and the Bureau
of Reclamation of the Department of the Interior, the Corps of
Engineers, Department of the Army, and a number of nongovern-
mental local institutions. The work was financed by the transfer of
$145,400 ($20,000 of which was appropriated in the 2d Deficiency
Act and did not become available for actual use until the beginning
of fiscal 1950) to the Smithsonian Institution by the National Park
Service. The money comprising these funds was derived in part
from the Bureau of Reclamation and in part from the National Park
Service.

Activities in the field consisted mainly of reconnaissance or surveys
for the purpose of locating sites that will be involved in construction
work or are so situated that eventually they will be inundated. There
was a limited testing of sites to determine their nature and extent,
where such was deemed essential, and at seven locations extended
excavation or intensive testing was carried on. The surveys covered
67 reservoir areas scattered throughout 8 river basins and 14 States.
At the end of the year the total of the reservoir areas surveyed or
where some digging has been done since the start of the program in
July 1946 had reached 154 located in 21 States. During the course
of the work 2,107 archeological sites have been recorded, and of that
number 456 have been recommended for excavation or further testing.
Thus far preliminary appraisal reports have been finished for all the
reservoirs, and 97 have been mimeographed for distribution to the
cooperating agencies. Where several reservoirs form a unit in a single
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

drainage subbasin the information on all is included in a single report,
so that the 97 mimeographed pamphlets contain information on some
130 of the reservoir projects. In addition to the archeological papers,
one comprehensive report on the paleontological problems in the
Missouri Basin was also issued. More detailed technical reports
completed for a number of projects have appeared in scientific journals
or are awaiting publication.

The distribution by States of all the reservoirs investigated, as of
the close of the fiscal year, is as follows: California, 16; Colorado, 23;
Georgia, 2; Idaho, 9; Llinois, 2; Iowa, 3; Kansas, 6; Minnesota, 1;
Montana, 5; Nebraska, 16; New Mexico, 1; North Dakota, 13;
Oklahoma, 5; Oregon, 12; South Dakota, 9; Tennessee, 1; Texas,
10; Virginia, 1; Washington, 9; West Virginia, 2; Wyoming, 8. Exca-
vations completed during the year were: Colorado, 1; Nebraska, 1;
North Dakota, 1; Oklahoma, 1; Oregon, 1; Washington, 1. In a
number of cases the digging was started in the previous fiscal year
and continued over into fiscal 1949. Other States where excavations
were made in prior years are: Kansas, 1; New Mexico, 1; Texas, 1;
and Wyoming, 1.

As has been the case since the start of the River Basin Surveys
program, staff men in the field received full cooperation from repre-
sentatives of the National Park Service, the Bureau of Reclamation,
the Corps of Engineers, and various State agencies. ‘Temporary
office and laboratory space was provided at some of the projects,
transportation and guides were furnished at others, and in several
instances labor and mechanical equipment made available by the
construction agency materially increased excavation operations.
Had it not been for this assistance it would not have been possible to
accomplish all that was done during the year. The National Park
Service was primarily responsible for obtaining the funds which sup-
ported the program and continued to serve as the liaison between the
Smithsonian Institution and the other governmental agencies, both
in Washington and through its several regional offices. The untiring
efforts of Park Service personnel played a large part in furthering the
progress of the program as a whole.

The main office in Washington had general direction and super-
vision over the work in Oklahoma, Texas, Minnesota, North Dakota
(in the drainage of the Red River of the North), Iowa, Illinois, Colo-
rado (outside of the Missouri Basin), and California. In the Missouri
Basin, direction of the program was from a field headquarters at Lin-
coln, Nebr., where all the materials collected by the survey and exca-
vation parties were also processed. Activities in the Columbia Basin
were supervised from a field office located at Eugene, Oreg.

Washington office——Throughout the fiscal year the main head-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 63

quarters of the River Basin Surveys continued under the direction of
Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr. Carl F. Miller, Joseph R. Caldwell,
and Ralph S. Solecki, archeologists, were based on that office, although
Caldwell and Solecki did not work full time for the Surveys.

Richard P. Wheeler was appointed archeologist on the staff on
August 27, and from that date until May 16 functioned under the
direction of the Washington office, although all his work was done in
the field. On May 16 he was transferred to the Missouri Basin
and from then until the close of the year was based on the Lincoln
headquarters.

Mr. Miller spent most of the year in the office preparing reports
based upon material gathered in the field during the previous year,
and assisting the Director in reviewing the literature pertaining to
archeological manifestations occurring in areas where additional reser-
voir projects are proposed. His ‘‘Appraisal of the Archeological
Resources of the Clark Hill Reservoir Area, South Carolina and Geor-
gia”? was completed and mimeographed for distribution in December.
Another article, ‘‘Karly Cultural Manifestations Exposed by the
Archeological Survey of the Buggs Island Reservoir in Southern
Virginia and Northern North Carolina,” was published in the Journal
of the Washington Academy of Sciences, vol. 38, No. 2, December
1948. A paper based on information obtained during the survey of
the Clark Hill Reservoir, ‘The Lake Spring Site, Columbia County,
Georgia,” was to appear in American Antiquity, vol. 15, No. 1, July
1949, Several others have been accepted for publication elsewhere.
Mr. Miller made two trips to Clarksville, Va., in the late winter and
early spring, the first for the purpose of investigating unauthorized
pot-hunting activities in the Buggs Island Reservoir area, and the
second to speak before the Archeological Society of Virginia on the
problems of the Buggs Island archeological program. He also went
to Richmond, Va., where he spent 2 days at the Valentine Museum
examining manuscripts and other documentary materials pertaining
to early explorations and surveys in Virginia, northern North Carolina,
and eastern West Virginia in an effort to obtain further data bearing
on the aboriginal history of the Buggs Island area.

In July and early August Mr. Caldwell collaborated with Mr. Miller
in working over the materials collected during the Clark Hill Reservoir
survey. During that period he prepared a paper, ‘““The Rembert
Mounds, Elbert County, Georgia,’”’ based on new information obtained
at Clark Hill. Another article, ‘‘Palachacolas Town, Hampton
County, South Carolina,” was printed in the Journal of the Washington
Academy of Sciences, vol. 38, No. 10, October 15, 1948. On August
19 Mr. Caldwell joined Dr. Robert E. Bell, of the University of Okla-
homa, at Wagoner, Okla., and began the excavation of a large mound
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

at the Norman Site in the Fort Gibson Reservoir basin. That work
continued until September 22. Mr. Caldwell returned to Washington
on September 25 and on October 3 was granted leave of absence to
join an expedition of the Universities of Chicago and Pennsylvania in
Iraq and Iran. He returned to duty on the staff of the River Basin
Surveys June 26, 1949, and began work on materials from the Alla-
toona Reservoir basin in Georgia.

Ralph S. Solecki devoted the summer and fall months to the prepara-
tion of reports on his work at the Bluestone and West Fork projects in
West Virginia. The Bluestone paper was mimeographed and dis-
tributed in December and that for the West Fork in March. Mr.
Solecki also prepared a detailed article, “‘An Archeological Survey of
Two River Basins in West Virginia,’ which was published in West
Virginia History, vol. 10, Nos.3 and 4. In December he was tempo-
rarily transferred to the regular staff of the Bureau of American
Ethnology and was sent to Natrium, W. Va., to excavate a mound on
the property of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. The latter organiza-
tion planned to level the mound to make room for new buildings and
in order that nothing of value might be destroyed made arrangements
with the Bureau to have it done properly, providing the necessary
labor for the project. Mr. Solecki returned to the River Basin Sur-
veys on January 12. In following months he continued to work on
the material from West Virginia and on May 8 was transferred to the
Smithsonian Institution staff so that he could accompany a party of
the United States Geological Survey to Alaska for an archeological
reconnaissance along the upper Kukpowruk and Kokolik Rivers in
northern Alaska. At the close of the fiscal year he reported having
located some 59 late Eskimo sites.

California.—Investigations in California were not as extensive as 10
previous years and were limited to three reservoir projects. In
October David A. Frederickson and Albert Mohr, field assistants of
the River Basin Surveys, working under the general supervision of
Francis A. Riddell, assistant archeologist of the California Archeologi-
eal Survey, University of California, and in cooperation with the latter
organization, examined the areas to be flooded by the Black Butte,
Farmington, and New Melones Reservoirs, all Corps of Engineers
projects.

The Black Butte Dam is to be built in Stony Creek, and the basin
it will flood lies in Glenn and Tehama Counties, a region formerly
occupied by the Wintun. The survey located 26 sites in the area and
it is believed that excavations in a number of them would provide a
reasonably accurate and balanced picture of the material culture of the
Indians who lived there.

The Farmington Dam is planned for Littlejohn Creek, and the
SECRETARY’S REPORT 65

reservoir formed by it will inundate areas in both San Joaquin and
Stanislaus Counties. It would seem that in aboriginal times that
section was more suitable for occupation than it has been in recent
years because 24 sites were found there. Most of them are of the
surface variety, indicating seasonal occupation, but some have cultural
deposits with artifacts, bone, and shell occurring in some abundance.
All the artifacts are alike, both in types and material, and are of
particular interest because they consist in the main of crude core tools,
cores, and flake tools, with only a few blade fragments and no arrow-
heads. The material from which they were made occurs in the local
stream beds in the form of cobbles. Excavations in a number of the
sites are recommended for the purpose of obtaining information both
as to their probable position in the chronological sequence of the area
and as to their relationships.

The New Melones Reservoir will fill a deep and narrow valley
formed by the Stanislaus River in Calaveras and Tuolumne Counties.
The area is one in which there was considerable mining activity at
one time, and there is an existing reservoir which has modified the
surface of the ground to some degree. Consequently only four sites
were noted, despite the fact that the Northern Miwok once inhabited
the region, and no further archeological activities were recommended.

Colorado.—Because of the physiographic character of the area in-
cluded within the political boundaries of Colorado the numerous
projects there occur within the limits of several drainage systems.
Consequently some of the archeological investigations have been
conducted as a part of the Missouri Basin program, while others
have been carried on as separate units of the Surveys as a whole.
Only the latter are discussed in this section of the report.

At the start of the fiscal year Donald Eastman and Gary L. Yundt,
field assistants, were continuing reconnaissance of the area involved
in the Taylor Lake Enlargement of the Gunnison-Arkansas project.
They completed this work on July 7, after having located only two
sites that will be covered by the waters of the larger lake resulting
from the construction of a new dam. The sites apparently were
former camps and only surface material was present. The latter,
however, is crude in character and suggests a much earlier cultural
horizon than that of the late nomads. Neither of the sites showed
sufficient depth to warrant excavation, and no further work is recom-
mended for that project. From Taylor Lake, Eastman and Yundt
proceeded to the Cimarron Damsite located on the Gunnison River
just below the confluence of the latter and the Cimarron. The area
to be flooded by this project had previously been surveyed in part
by the Chipeta Chapter of the Colorado Archeological Society,
Montrose, which made it possible for the Survey men to complete
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

their work by July 17. All the sites located, eight in number, indi-
cate that they were camping places, and the surface materials col-
lected from them are typical of the late nomadic Indians of the
region. Similar sites are abundant outside of the basin of the pro-
posed reservoir, hence no further investigations are needed there.
Eastman and Yundt returned to Gunnison, Colo., from the Cimarron
project and, having completed their reports, resigned from the River
Basin Surveys on July 23. During the course of their investigations
they worked under the general! direction and supervision of Dr. C. T.
Hurst of Western State College, Gunnison, who had cooperated with
the River Basin Surveys on a number of previous surveys.

Arnold M. Withers, archeologist, completed reconnaissance of nine
proposed reservoir areas in the Blue-South Platte project, which he
had started toward the end of the previous year, and examined six of
those in the Gunnison-Arkansas project east of the Rocky Mountains.
All the proposed reservoirs of the Blue-South Platte project, Two
Forks, Shawnee, Blue, Snake, Tenmile, Ruedi, Pando, Piney, and
Empire, are located in the high mountain valleys of the Colorado
Rockies at altitudes ranging from 8,000 to 10,000 feet above sea level.
They will be situated in Douglas, Park, Summit, Eagle, Pitkin, and
Clear Creek Counties. Only six definite archeological sites were
found in the nine reservoir areas, although further surveys are recom-
mended for the Snake and the upper part of the Two Forks, and they
appear to have been temporary camps occupied by a people engaged
in hunting and gathering wild food products. At none of them are
the deposits of sufficient depth to warrant excavation. The materials
collected from the surface suggest that the sites are prehistoric, al-
though they have no great age, and that they probably are attributable
to Ute Indians.

The six proposed reservoirs of the Gunnison-Arkansas project, the
Graneros, Cedarwood, Ben Butler, Pueblo, Higbee or Purgatoire, and
Horse Creek, are in the broken country of the High Plains along the
Arkansas or its tributaries in Pueblo, Huerfano, Otero, and Bent
Counties, Colo. The rapid survey of the area by Withers produced
a total of only 13 sites for the project. They consist of rock shelters
and open camps. At a number of the latter, tipi rings were noted.
Although the small number of sites indicates that the area was sparsely
populated, the character of the materials collected from them suggests
that a long period of time is represented. Testing is recommended
for some of the rock shelters and two of the stone-circle sites, but none
appears to be worthy of complete excavation. A more intensive in-
vestigation of the Pueblo and Purgatoire reservoir basins is indicated
if the projects are authorized and construction work is started.
Withers completed his work and left the Surveys on August 14.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 67

During the investigations he was provided with a base of operations
by the University of Denver.

Preliminary reconnaissance of the eight reservoirs included in the
Colorado-Big Thompson project by the University of Colorado was
completed in the autumn of 1947. In accordance with recommenda-
tions made at that time, the River Basin Surveys arranged for a more
intensive survey and the testing of some sites in the Granby Reservoir
on the Colorado River in Grand County. That work was carried out
during August and September by Robert F. Burgh, field assistant,
who was on leave of absence from the University of Colorado Museum,
aided by William Woodard and Byron W. Houseknecht, student
assistants. Only four sites were located in the area to be flooded, and
two of those showed only surface traces of stone chips and a few im-
plements. Another consisted of stone circles, presumably tipi rings,
but yielded no artifacts. The fourth was a camp site located on the
west side of the basin on a terrace adjacent to Stillwater Creek.
Trenching of the site produced a variety of cultural remains consisting
of hearths, potsherds, stone projectile points, stone scrapers, manos,
metate fragments, and animal bones. No traces of house remains
were found, and the occurrence of fireplaces at varying depths below
the surface suggests that there were repeated but casual occupations
of the terrace during successive seasons without any permanent habi-
tation. Potsherds from the site were of two kinds, cord-marked and
corrugated. The cord-marked is from a cooking ware of Woodland
type, while the corrugated undoubtedly came from the Northern
Periphery of the Southwest. The pottery indicates that the site
probably dates between A. D. 900 and 1300. The bulk of the material
obtained there shows that the affiliations were clearly with the pre-
historic Plains cultures, particularly those responsible for the camp
sites along the foothills in northeastern Colorado.

Conclusions, based on the results of the work in that area, are that
no further investigations are warranted in the Colorado-Big Thomp-
son project unless construction operations accidentally uncover un-
suspected remains. West of the Continental Divide there are no
sites as good as the one examined in the Granby Reservoir, while east
of it there are numerous examples outside the reservoir basins which
not only appear to have the same cultural identity as those within
them but to offer greater promise.

Columbia Basin.—Work in the Columbia Basin was based on the
field headquarters at Eugene, Oreg., where office and laboratory space
was provided by the University of Oregon. Dr. Philip Drucker, on
detail from the Bureau of American Ethnology, continued to direct
the program until October 1 when he returned to Washington and his
regular duties prior to being granted military leave beginning October
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

22. After Dr. Drucker’s departure from Eugene, Homer Douglas
Osborne, archeologist, was appointed acting field director and placed
in charge of the office there. He continued in that capacity through-
out the remainder of the year.

From July to early September, two parties consisting of two men
each, were engaged in the investigation of reservoir areas in the
Columbia Basin. During that time they explored 15 reservoir basins,
6 of which are Corps of Engineers projects, and 9 of which are projects
of the Bureau of Reclamation. The Corps of Engineers projects in-
clude the 4 navigational reservoirs on the lower Snake River in Wash-
ington, Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose, and Lower
Granite. In addition Lucky Peak Reservoir basin in Idaho was
examined, and the results of the survey of Chief Joseph (Foster Creek)
Reservoir in east-central Washington initiated some years ago by the
University of Washington were checked and the survey was com-
pleted. The work done in Bureau of Reclamation reservoirs involved
the examination of sites in the Deschutes project, Benham Falls and
Prineville Reservoirs, and checks of the proposed enlargement of
Wickiup and Crane Prairie Reservoirs. In addition a series of small
reservoirs in eastern Oregon and central Idaho were surveyed. They
were: Mason, Ryan Creek, and Bully Creek in northeastern Oregon;
and Lost Valley Enlargement and Horse Flat Reservoirs in Idaho.
Within the boundaries of those 15 reservoir basins a total of 128
archeological sites were found and recorded.

Excavation projects were carried out in the McNary Reservoir
area, Oregon-Washington, and in the O’Sullivan (Potholes) Reservoir,
Washington. The work at McNary was a cooperative undertaking
between the River Basin Surveys and the University of Oregon, while
that at O’Sullivan was a joint venture between the Surveys and the
University of Washington.

Investigations at McNary were carried on from August 5 to Sep-
tember 11 under the direction of Homer Douglas Osborne. The
digging was done by students from various west coast universities.
Extensive tests were made in two sites on Berrian Island, Wash.,
which had been designated as a source of aggregate for dam construc-
tion, and at an important one on the Oregon side of the river. In
addition to previously unknown information about local Indian vil-
lage and house patterns, the excavations produced 48 burials and
1,870 artifacts. The skeletal material provides one of the largest
series thus far available for study and should throw considerable light
on the physical characteristics and relationships of the people. The
artifacts will give a good cross section of the material culture prevail-
ing at the time of first contact with European influence.

The O’Sullivan project was well under way at the start of the fiscal
SECRETARY’S REPORT 69

year and continued until August 19. Richard D. Daugherty, arche-
ologist, was in charge of the party, which consisted of students from
the University of Washington. The scene of operations was a village
site located on the shores of Moses Lake, an area which will be in-
undated when the dam is completed. Three house-pit depressions and
the terrain immediately surrounding them were carefully examined.
Good data were obtained on the form and construction of the houses,
and the series of artifacts recovered during the digging will aid in
determining the cultural status of the people. The absence of all
European objects indicates that the site antedates the period of
exploration and early trading posts. The results at O’Sullivan, in
general, indicate that more intensive work should be done there.

Special mention should be made of the excellent cooperation on the
part of other governmental agencies. The National Park Service,
through the Region Four office at San Francisco and the Columbia
Basin Recreational Survey office at Portland furnished the Eugene
office with current information on reservoir priorities, construction
schedules, and field maps. The Bureau of Reclamation, through the
Region One office in Boise, Idaho, not only supplied maps of reservoir
areas and information on their projects, but greatly facilitated the
archeological investigations by placing vehicles at the disposal of the
survey parties. The Corps of Engineers, through the office of the
Division Engineer, and also the Portland and Seattle District offices,
provided maps and other essential information. In addition the
Portland District office made a vehicle available for use at the McNary
project, furnished a temporary headquarters, and provided assistance
in the mapping of sites.

Throughout the period of active work Dr. Drucker made numerous
trips from the Eugene office to the various parties and the excavation
projects. He also met with Dr. Robert F. Heizer, Director, California
Archeological Surveys, and assisted in perfecting plans for the coopera-
tive work to be carried on by that organization. After completing
arrangements for maintaining the Eugene office during the winter
months, he returned to Washington on October 1.

At the start of the year George L. Coale, archeologist, and Francis A.
Riddell, Harry S. Riddell, Jr., and Homer Douglas Osborne, field
assistants, were engaged in the survey of the Benham Falls, Prineville,
Wickiup, and Crane Prairie Reservoirs. That work was completed
on July 11, and Coale and Osborne returned to Eugene to assist
Dr. Drucker in making preparations for the excavations at the McNary
Reservoir. The two Riddells proceeded to northeastern Oregon
where they made a reconnaissance of the Mason Creek and Ryan
Creek Reservoirs. The surveys there being finished on July 16, they
moved to Chief Joseph (Foster Creek) where on July 26 they completed
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

the investigations previously started by the University of Washington.
Francis A. Riddell resigned from the Surveys on July 30. George L.
Coale met Harry S. Riddell, Jr., at Pasco, Wash., on the 27th, and
the two proceeded from there to Ice Harbor and Lower Monumental
Reservoirs. After their reconnaissance of those two projects they
went on to the Lucky Peak, Lost Valley, and Horse Creek Reservoirs
in Idaho, and the Bully Creek Reservoir in Oregon. William W. Burd,
who was appointed a field assistant on August 16, and Joel L. Shiner,
who was promoted from the crew at McNary to field assistant, spent
the period from August 18 to 30 examining the Little Goose and Lower
Monumental Reservoirs for archeological remains. Burd returned to
Eugene and resigned on August 31, while Shiner rejoined the party
at the McNary excavations and continued with it until September 9
when he resigned. After completing the field work at Moses Lake,
Richard D. Daugherty proceeded to Seattle, Wash., where he processed
and studied the materials obtained from the excavations and prepared
a report on the results of the investigations. His appointment as
archeologist terminated on September 16.

As previously mentioned, Osborne spent the first few weeks of the
year on survey duties and was then recalled to Eugene to aid in prepa-
rations for the McNary project. He went with the party to that
reservoir on August 5 and on August 16 was promoted toarc he ologist
and placed in charge of the excavations. Upon his return to Eugene
in September he was made Acting Field Director, and continued to
function in that capacity throughout the remainder of the year.
During the fall and winter months he wrote the preliminary appraisal
reports for the 15 reservoirs surveyed during the summer, prepared
& summary report and a longer, more detailed manuscript on the
MeNary excavations, and made compilations of data on historical
references, ethnological descriptions, and trade goods to be used as
ready sources for information on the Columbia Basin. During Febru-
ary he made a survey of the Big Cliff Reservoir and checked the
various bank-control projects of the Corps of Engineers along the
Willamette River and its tributaries. On May 26 and 27 he partici-
pated in a conference at Pendleton, Oreg., where representatives of
the Corps of Engineers, the National Park Service, and the Bureau
of Indian Affairs discussed the problem of the removal of Indian
burials from areas that are to be flooded. Throughout the winter
months Osborne was assisted in the laboratory by Lloyd Collins and
Hiroto Zakoji, students of the University of Oregon.

Lllinois.—Archeological studies in Illinois consisted of the examina-
tion of the records of previous surveys in the Illinois River Basin and
the investigation of two reservoir areas where dams were under
construction.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 7h

During February Richard P. Wheeler conferred with the District
Engineer at Chicago about the flood-control program for the Illinois
River Basin, discussed archeological problems involved with Dr. John
C. McGregor, associate professor of anthropology at the University of
Illinois, and with Dr. Kenneth G. Orr, assistant professor of anthro-
pology at the University of Chicago. March 10 to 18, Wheeler
checked the survey files of the Department of Anthropology and
worked in the Harper Library, at the University of Chicago. Leaving
Chicago he proceeded to Springfield, Ill., where he conferred with
Dr. Thorne Deuel, Director of the Illinois State Museum. From
March 21 to 25 he made a reconnaissance of the Fondulac and Farm-
dale Reservoir basins, the dams then being built, on Farm Creek, in
Tazewell County, Ill. No archeological sites were found in those
areas, and no further work was recommended.

In April Wheeler prepared a preliminary report, “Archeological
Resources of the Proposed or Considered Reservoirs in the Illinois
River Basin, Central and Northern Illinois,’ which embodied a
synopsis of present knowledge of the archeology of this region and
provided a list of known sites (based on the site list prepared for the
River Basin Surveys in September 1947 by Dr. J. C. McGregor) in
10 of the 15 proposed reservoirs in the Illinois River Basin for which
maps are available.

On May 16 Wheeler was transferred to the Missouri Basin, and his
activities from then until the end of the year are included in that
portion of the report.

Iowa.—Work in Iowa was confined for the most part to surveys of
two reservoir basins and the area immediately adjacent to the dam
site of a third where preliminary construction activities were already
under way.

Richard P. Wheeler spent the period December 6 to 10 at the Red
Rock Reservoir project, on the Des Moines River, and December 13
to 15 at the Rathbun Reservoir on the Chariton River. During the
progress of the work he consulted with Dr. Charles R. Keyes, Director
of the Archeological Survey of Iowa, about the character and extent
of the archeological remains in the two areas. In his reports prepared
at the conclusion of his field investigations, Wheeler records 15 mound
and occupation sites in the Red Rock basin, 4 of which will be involved
in the dam construction, and 6 in the Rathbun area. More intensive
studies under more favorable field conditions were recommended for
both reservoirs.

Between January 24 and February 3, Wheeler made a preliminary
reconnaissance of the Coralville Reservoir, on the Iowa River, in
Johnson and Iowa Counties, Iowa. Eight mound sites and one
occupation site were located. Ten other sites, recorded prior to the

866591—50-—6
@ ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

survey, could not be found because of the deep snow cover. Further
work will be necessary before recommendations can be made for the
salvage of archeological remains in that reservoir area.

Missouri Basin.—The Missouri Basin project, as in previous years,
continued under the general direction of Dr. Waldo R. Wedel and
was based on the field headquarters at Lincoln, Nebr. During the
fiscal year 12 new reservoir basins were surveyed for archeological
remains; two areas only briefly examined in former seasons were revis-
ited and subjected to intensive reconnaissance; while comprehensive
excavations were carried on at one location. In addition to those activ-
ities and certain paleontological investigations, laboratory and office
work were carried on throughout the year.

As the fiscal year opened, three archeological units and one paleonto-
logical unit were engaged in field work. The largest project was the
excavation program at Medicine Creek, Nebr., under the field direction
of M. F. Kivett, archeologist, with George Metcalf as assistant. The
work was made possible through an agreement with the Bureau of
Reclamation under which the Bureau provided labor and power equip-
ment while the River Basin Surveys provided the technical supervision
and maintained the scientific records. This project terminated on
August 20, having produced a large body of data and artifacts for
several inadequately known prehistoric culture horizons. Aside from
the scientific returns of the operation, it is important to note that the
applicability of power machinery to the excavation of aboriginal village
sites under careful technical supervision was amply demonstrated.
The findings add much new information to that previously obtained
elsewhere in the Central Plains through the small-scale sampling of
many sites.

A second unit under J. T. Hughes, archeologist, with J. M. Shippee
as assistant, was at work in Angostura Reservoir, South Dakota. In-
tensive survey there added numerous sites to those recorded during
preliminary reconnaissance in 1946; and also disclosed the presence of at
least one site that may have an antiquity of several thousand years.
Because of the extreme scarcity of data from this early period, and the
usual difficulty of working such sites, it is imperative that further
excavation be carried on there. From September 15 to 30 Hughes
and Shippee carried on preliminary reconnaissance at the Edgemont
and Keyhole Projects in Wyoming, and at the Pactola and Johnson
Siding Reservoir basins in South Dakota. At Edgemont 28 sites were
recorded, while 29 were noted at Keyhole. Only one was noted at
Pactola and none at Johnson Siding.

A third unit under Paul L. Cooper carried on excavations at the
Heart Butte Reservoir basin, North Dakota, through the month of
July, and then transferred its activities to the proposed lower Oahe

SECRETARY’S REPORT 73

Reservoir project on the Missouri River a few miles above Pierre,
S. Dak. On the basis of findings by that unit, it appears unlikely
that remains of any great importance to archeology will be lost at
Heart Butte. At Oahe, 61 sites were recorded between Pierre and
the Cheyenne River, a distance of about 40 miles. They include some
of the largest, best preserved, and most impressive Indian village re-
mains in the Missouri Basin. Most of them are virtually untouched
by trained archeologists and, with one or two possible exceptions, none
has been adequately tested by excavation. Five of the sites will be
affected almost as soon as construction work begins on the dam site,
the access roads, and the railroad classification yards. Hence,
salvage operations will be necessary at an early date. Because of the
abundance and variety of remains, comprehensive excavation has
been recommended to begin soon and to be carried forward vigorously
so that a representative sample of the materials to be affected by Oahe
Reservoir may be saved.

From November 9 to 24 Cooper and Shippee excavated a burial
mound in the spillway area of Fort Randall Dam, South Dakota. The
Corps of Engineers provided a bulldozer and operator as needed, and
assisted in numerous other ways. Without that cooperation, the
work there would not have been possible. The findings, although not
spectacular, are important because burial mounds are extremely rare
on that portion of the Missouri, and their temporal and cultural
relationships to other archeological complexes of the region can be
determined, if at all, only through controlled excavations by trained
investigators.

A paleontological unit under Dr. T. E. White was in the field from
July 1 to October 1. It worked at the Boysen Reservoir, Wyoming;
in the Canyon Ferry Reservoir area on the Missouri River north of
Townsend, Mont.; at the Angostura Reservoir, South Dakota; and at
the Cedar Bluff Reservoir on the Smoky Hill River in Kansas.

Limited field work was resumed in the spring. Richard P. Wheeler,
archeologist, left Lincoln on May 27 for preliminary reconnaissance
at several hitherto unvisited reservoir projects and for further survey
of others previously examined in preliminary fashion. Projects
visited by Wheeler prior to June 30 include Rocky Ford, Philip, Bixby,
and Shadehill, in South Dakota; Cannonball and Dickinson, in North
Dakota; Moorhead, in Wyoming-Montana, and Onion Flat in
Wyoming.

Among the particularly gratifying features of the year’s field work
were the results achieved through use of power machinery and the
direct cooperation extended by the Bureau of Reclamation at Medicine
Creek and by the Corps of Engineers at Fort Randall Reservoir.
Such cooperative work, in terms of research accomplished, is the most
74 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

economical way of salvaging archeological remains on the scale needed.
Application of the same procedures, including mechanized earth-
moving operations, to other projects seems to be the only way of
obtaining irreplaceable scientific data in the little time left for its
recovery.

In the laboratory 39 maps were drawn. Many of them were field
maps, others were site and reservoir maps for use with published re-
ports. Throughout the winter specimens were selected aad photo-
graphed as analysis for technical reports proceeded. Including field
photographs, a total of 918 negatives and 374 color transparencies
were processed; 61 lantern slides were added to the slide series; 918
prints were made, cataloged, and filed; 1,008 prints were made for
report illustrations and reference purposes; and 350 enlargements
were made for publicity and reference use.

All specimens collected during the field season, a total of 45,233,
were cleaned, numbered, cataloged, and stored. The majority of
them came from Medicine Creek, Angostura, and Oahe Reservoirs.
Samples of bone, shell, and vegetal specimens from various sites were
packed and sent to specialists elsewhere for identification. In addi-
tion, soil samples from some of the sites were sent out for analysis, and
wood and charcoal specimens were sent away for tree-ring studies.

The skeleton of an adolescent covered with thousands of shell beads,
sent to Lincoln in a plaster case from the Harlan County Reservoir,
Nebraska, in 1946, was mounted permanently for exhibit purposes.
Pottery restoration, principally of Medicine Creek material, continued
throughout the spring months, 17 earthenware vessels having been
restored by June 30.

Information concerning over 129 sites was added to the site file,
and 45 maps were indexed and added to the map reference file.

On July 1, J. Joseph Bauxar, archeologist, was stationed at the
Lincoln, Nebr., headquarters, continuing the ethnohistorical research
project he had started the preceeding year. The material collected
consisted of such information as is pertinent to the archeologists’
problem of determining the ethnic affiliations of the archeological
complexes in the Missouri River Basin. Some 30 tribes and subtribes
are represented in the Tribal Culture File. On January 9, 1949, Mr.
Bauxar was transferred to the Oklahoma project of the River Basin
Surveys and proceeded to Norman for the purpose of analyzing
materials from the Norman site in the Fort Gibson Reservoir.

Wesley L. Bliss, archeologist, devoted the time from July 1 until
January 8 in the preparation of a general article ““Birdshead Cave,
a Stratified Site in the Wind River Basin, Wyoming,” and a technical
report on the same project. In late August he visited the sites in the
Medicine Creek area being excavated by the State Museum of the
SECRETARY’S REPORT 75

University of Nebraska and in October accompanied a group from that
institution on a trip to Signal Butte in western Nebraska for the
purpose of reexamining the early sites at that location. On the basis
of information obtained during the course of his work, he prepared
a paper ‘‘Early and Late Lithic Horizons in the Plains” which was
presented before the Sixth Conference for Plains Archeology at Lincoln
in November. Mr. Bliss left the River Basin Surveys staff on
January 8.

In addition to the field work previously mentioned, Paul L. Cooper
in September accompanied Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, Dr. Gordon Baldwin
of the National Park Service, and Dr. J. O. Brew and Frederick
Johnson of the Committee for the Recovery of Archeological Remains,
on an inspection trip to Missouri Basin archeological sites in Wyoming,
Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska. Throughout
the remainder of the year his activities were centered in the laboratory
at Lincoln. Until March 24 he was in charge of the Lincoln head-
quarters during such times as Dr. Wedel was in Washington, but from
that date until June 30 devoted most of his attention to analyzing
the data and specimens obtained during the field season and in the
preparation of reports. He wrote a summary of the work done at two
reservoirs in South Dakota, “Recent Investigations in Fort Randall
and Oahe Reservoirs, South Dakota,” which was published in Amer-
ican Antiquity, vol. 14, No. 4, April 1949.

Robert B. Cumming, Jr., archeologist, continued to plan and super-
vise the laboratory procedures, as mentioned in an earlier paragraph,
and from March 24 until June 30 was in charge of the Lincoln office
when Dr. Wedel was not present at the laboratory.

Following the summer field work Jack T. Hughes, archeologist,
spent the remainder of the year in the laboratory studying the data
and materials collected from the various reservoirs he had examined
and writing reports on the results of his work. He prepared a
memorandum on Cheyenne Basin archeology for the National Park
Service and completed an article, “Investigations in Western South
Dakota and Northeastern Wyoming,’ which was published in
American Antiquity, vol. 14, No. 4, April 1949. He collaborated
with Dr. Theodore E. White in writing a manuscript “The Long Site,
an Ancient Camp in Southwestern South Dakota.” The latter is a
preliminary account of the archeology and physiography of one of the
most significant sites yet found in the Angostura Reservoir basin.
Hughes also prepared a paper, ‘Archeology and Environment in the
Western Great Plains,” which he presented at the Sixth Conference
for Plains Archeology held in Lincoln in November. In addition he
wrote a paper, “An Experiment in Relative Dating of Archeological
Remains by Stream Terraces,’’ which he read before the Anthropology
76 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

Section of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences in May. He wrote a
memorandum on geological deposits and archeological remains in the
Tiber Reservoir basin, on the Marias River in northern Montana, for
the United States Geological Survey, and “A Note on Fireplaces’”’ for
the Plains Archeological Conference Newsletter. Earlier in the year
be had prepared an article, “Naming Projectile Point Types,” for
the same journal. At the close of the year he was occupied with a
report on the Nebraska State Historical Society’s investigations at
the Barn Butte site in western Nebraska and was continuing his work
on the development of a correlation table dealing with early remains
in the western United States.

Upon the completion of the excavation project at the Medicine
Creek Reservoir, Marvin F. Kivett, archeologist, returned to Lincoln
on September 1 and began the preparation of a brief preliminary
report for the use of H. E. Robinson, District Manager of the
Bureau of Reclamation. Included in it was a tabulation of work
completed at various sites in the Medicine Creek Reservoir basin.
After that manuscript was finished Kivett wrote a summary account,
“Archeological Investigations in Medicine Creek Reservoir, Nebras-
ka,’’ which was printed in American Antiquity, vol. 14, No. 4, April
1949. He then turned his attention to completing a laboratory
analysis of the more than 30,000 specimens collected at Medicine
Creek and to a study of comparable materials gathered in the same
area by parties from the Nebraska State Historical Society and placed
at his disposal, with the accompanying data, for inclusion in the final
technical report. In addition, Mr. Kivett wrote a technical paper on
the prehistoric ossuary which he excavated at the Harlan County
Reservoir in the fall of 1946, and another ‘‘Archeology and Climatic
Implications in the Central Plains,” which was presented before the
Sixth Conference for Plains Archeology. Two brief articles, one con-
cerning the use of power equipment in archeological work and the
other dealing with pottery nomenclature, were printed in the Plains
Archeological Conference Newsletter.

One trip of 4 days was made by Kivett to the Medicine Creek
project during October for the purpose of marking trees from which
sections for dendrochronological studies were to be cut under the
supervision of the Bureau of Reclamation. In May he made a 1-day
trip to the Harlan County and Medicine Creek Reservoirs to point
out to members of the Missouri Basin Inter-Agency Committee
archeological work completed and that contemplated for those
reservoirs. Mr. Kivett resigned from the River Basin Surveys on
May 31 to accept an appointment as Assistant Director of the Museum
of the Nebraska State Historical Society.

George Metcalf, field and laboratory assistant, participated in the
SECRETARY’S REPORT V7

excavations at Medicine Creek and, after his return to the Lincoln
headquarters on August 24, assisted in the cleaning and cataloging of
the last consignment of specimens from the project. From September
12 until October 20 he supervised and aided in the processing of some
7,000 specimens recovered from Medicine Creek sites by the Nebraska
State Historical Society. As a part of that task all suitable shell,
bone, and vegetal material was listed and prepared for submission to
specialists for identification. ‘Throughout the winter and spring
months he worked with Mr. Kivett in the analysis of the Medicine
Creek materials and wrote sections on worked bone, shell, and pottery
for inclusion in the final technical report. He also assisted in the
selection of specimens and the arrangement of photographic plates
for the final report. At the end of the fiscal year he was engaged in
making an analysis of the house remains in the Medicine Creek area.

J. M. Shippee, field and laboratory assistant, returned to Lincoln
with the Hughes party on October 1 and from then until November 8
supervised the dismantling of the laboratory and its reinstallation in
new quarters. Mr. Shippee then accompanied Mr. Cooper to the
Fort Randall Reservoir, where he assisted in the excavation of a burial
mound located on the site of the dam spillway. He returned to
Lincoln in late November and spent the remainder of the year in the
restoration of pottery and other specimens and in the cleaning and
mounting, for exhibition purposes, of a juvenile skeleton which had
been removed intact from an ossuary at the Harlan County Reservoir.
He prepared a paper, ‘‘SSome Problems of the Nebo Hill Complex,”
which was read before the Anthropological Section of the Nebraska
Academy of Sciences on May 7. At the close of the year he was
preparing and assembling equipment for the various parties starting
for the field.

Richard P. Wheeler, archeologist, was transferred to the Missouri
Basin in May and on May 27 left Lincoln to make a series of prelim-
inary surveys at reservoir projects in South Dakota, North Dakota,
Montana, and Wyoming. By the end of the year he had visited eight
reservoir areas. On June 30 he was at Fort Washakie, Wyo., where
he obtained permission from the Business Council of the Shoshones
and Arapahos to make preliminary surveys of the proposed Soral
Creek and Raft Lake reservoir basins, which are located in the Wind
River Indian Reservation, immediately after the start of the new year.

Dr. Theodore E. White, paleontologist, confined his activities, with
one minor exception, to work on the Missouri Basin problems through-
out the fiscal year.

From July 1 to 12 the lower Eocene deposits in the Boysen Reservoir
area on the Big Horn River north of Shoshoni, Fremont County,
Wyo., were prospected for fossils. Five fossiliferous “‘pockets,’’ which
78 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

will be inundated when the reservoir is flooded, were found. The
results of the work there confirmed the conclusions of the members of
the United States Geological Survey who had mapped the structure
and stratigraphy of that area.

From July 14 to August 19 the Oligocene and Miocene deposits in
the Canyon Ferry Reservoir area on the Missouri River north of
Townsend, Broadwater County, Mont., were prospected for fossils.
Material was obtained from three localities in the Oligocene and two
in the Miocene. All those localities will be inundated.

After the close of the work at Canyon Ferry, White’s party pro-
ceeded to the Angostura Reservoir on the Cheyenne River in Fall
River County, S. Dak., to make a physiographic study of the area in
connection with an early-man site. The period from August 21 to
September 3 was spent in collecting data for that study. The party
returned to Lincoln, Nebr., on September 4 in order to prepare a
preliminary report on the results of the physiographic study.

From September 23 to October 1 the Upper Cretaceous Carlile
Shale in Cedar Bluff Reservoir on the Smoky Hill River south of
Wakeeney, Trego County, Kans., was prospected for vertebrate fossils.
Although a number of specimens were found, they were so badly
disintegrated by the crystallization of gypsum and the weathering of
marcasite that they were not worth collecting.

About 70 specimens, representing 20 genera, were obtained in the
Boysen Reservoir area. Although the specimens were for the most
part rather fragmentary, they were sufficiently well preserved to estab-
lish the age of those beds as belonging to the Lost Cabin faunal zone
of the lower Eocene, a fact that had not previously been demonstrated.
In the material obtained is the most nearly complete skull yet found of
the primitive insectivore, Didelphodus. Although badly crushed and
not impressive to look at, it adds a number of previously unknown
details to the knowledge of the cranial morphology of that form.
Also the skull and jaws of Didymictis, a primitive carnivore a little
larger than a fox, was obtained in that area. Heretofore the form was
known only from upper and lower dentitions.

Nearly 125 specimens, principally insectivores, rodents, and small
artiodactyls, were obtained in the Canyon Ferry Reservoir area.
Most of the specimens were found in the Oligocene deposits which
previously were very poorly known. ‘The material obtained demon-
strated that deposits of both lower and middle Oligocene age were
present in that area. One of the Oligocene insectivores belongs to a
problematical family previously unknown in deposits later than the
upper Eocene. Also, it is the best-preserved specimen yet found and
adds many details of the skull and dentition to the knowledge of that
group. The small Oligocene mammals of that area, when compared
SECRETARY’S REPORT 79

to those of the same age on the Plains, illustrate the principles of
geographical variation quite as well as the living species.

White’s laboratory activities for the year fall into two periods. The
first, from October 4 to November 5, was spent at the field office at
Lincoln, Nebr., preparing supplementary reports on the reservoirs
visited and in identifying the osteological material obtained in archeo-
logical excavations. Also, during that period the first draft of the
technical report on the physiographic studies in the Angostura area
was prepared. The remaining time was spent in the division of
vertebrate paleontology at the United States National Museum. In
addition to the preparation of technical reports on the paleontological
material obtained in the reservoir areas, six boxes of osteological
material from the Missouri and Columbia Basins were identified.

White completed two technical reports representing the results of
field and laboratory activities. They are: “Preliminary Analysis of
the Vertebrate Fossil Fauna of the Boysen Reservoir Area,’ and
“Endocrine Glands and Evolution No. 2: The Appearance of Large
Amounts of Cement on the Teeth of Horses.” Both were submitted
for publication. At the close of the year he had virtually finished
two other papers: ‘‘A Preliminary Appraisal of the Physiographic
History of Horsehead Creek in the Vicinity of 39FA65” (with Jack T.
Hughes), and “Analysis of the Vertebrate Fossil Fauna of the
Canyon Ferry Reservoir Area.”

Throughout the field season White enjoyed congenial relationships
with members of other Government agencies and with members of
educational institutions. Among those from whom material assistance
was received are: Harry A. Tourtelot of the United States Geological
Survey, J. LeRoy Kay of the Carnegie Museum, Mr. McQuiren,
geologist for the Bureau of Reclamation at the Boysen project, and
Roy Austin, Superintendent of Public Schools at Townsend, Mont.
Also the work was materially expedited by the many forest rangers
who placed the facilities of their stations at the convenience of the
party.

As in previous years, a number of student assistants were employed
as members of the various field parties. Robert L. Hall and Warren
L. Wittry were with the Cooper party from July 1 to September 4
and August 14, respectively. Gordon F. McKenzie joined the same
party on August 1 and remained with it until September 4. John C.
Donohoe was with the White party July 1 to 31, while Ernest L.
Lundelius, Jr., accompanied it from July 1 to September 4. Dorothy
I. Fraser was with the Cooper party during the month of August in
the capacity of a special consultant. Neil J. Isto joined the Wheeler
party on June 2 and was in the field at the close of the year.

Oklahoma.—Work in Oklahoma consisted of both surveys and
80 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

excavation. At the beginning of the year David J. Wenner, Jr.,
field assistant, was making a reconnaissance of the area to be flooded
by the Tenkiller Ferry Reservoir on the Illinois River in the eastern
part of the State. That work was completed on July 27 and the
party moved to the Canadian Reservoir project on the Canadian
River. Reconnaissance of that area was finished on August 17,
when attention was turned to the adjacent Onapa project on the
North Canadian. The survey there was completed on September 3.
Within the 3 basins, 104 sites were found, 38 in Tenkiller Ferry, 41
in the Canadian, and 25 in Onapa. The work in Tenkiller Ferry
demonstrated that what were presumed to be mounds, actually are
natural knolls on flood plains and terraces, and all the sites present
are village or camp remains. Those in the other two areas are also
mainly village sites representing both historic and prehistoric cultures.
In passing it should be stated that the Canadian and Onapa are
two of three smaller alternate projects proposed to take the place of
the larger Eufaula Reservoir. The third in the group, the Gaines,
still remains to be surveyed. Should the single Eufaula project
eventually be carried through instead of the three smaller ones, very
little additional field work will be required to determine the archeologi-
cal manifestations involved. It is known that there are a number of
mounds that lie outside the boundaries of the smaller reservoirs but
which would fall within the maximum pool of the Eufaula. Mr.
Wenner was aided in his work by William Mayer-Oakes and Robert
Shalkop, student assistants.

The excavations were at the Norman site in the Fort Gibson
Reservoir basin on the Grand (Neosho) River near Wagoner. Earlier
work by the University of Oklahoma had shown that the extensive
village and mound group located there belonged to a Spiro-type
culture and raised the possibility that the flooding of the largest
double mound, which had never been excavated, would represent the
loss of as important information and material as had the destruction
of the famous Spiro mounds in the adjacent county. When Dr.
Robert E. Bell of the Department of Anthropology of the University
of Oklahoma reached the site in July he found that nearly all the
village area and all mounds, with the exception of the largest double
unit, had been removed by the bulldozers of the construction con-
tractor. Even the large double unit had been damaged. The
western periphery had been cut away and the smaller mound had
been cut down several feet. With the assistance of the Engineers
Dr. Bell was able to stop the operations so that archeological work
could be done. During July and the first 2 weeks in August the
University of Oklahoma field session under Bell excavated portions
of several house sites still surviving south of the larger mound. On
SECRETARY'S REPORT SI

August 17, under the sponsorship of the River Basin Surveys, he
began excavation of the large double mound by cutting a trench
across the saddle between the two parts of the unit. The southern
face of the trench was then carried forward toward the larger mound.
Joseph R. Caldwell joined Bell on August 19 and they decided that
neither the available time nor funds would permit the customary
method of cutting forward with a continuous vertical face. Accord-
ingly, a 10-foot trench was driven through the north-south axis of
the mound to reach its base and to obtain a complete profile. The
work continued until September 22. Surprisingly, the mound
yielded very few specimens. fPotsherds and artifacts were scarce
throughout its various levels. It was learned, however, that its
main portion was composed of six superimposed platforms which
probably had been the placements for public buildings, although no
complete post-hole patterns were discovered. The summit of the
fifth stage above the base had been divided into two nearly equal
areas by a single row of posts, and the entire level gave evidence of a
severe conflagration in prehistoric times. Four human burials were
found in the top level, but they were in such an advanced stage of
decomposition that little remained to indicate their character. A
number of glass beads in the same level suggests a historic contact in
the final days of occupation. The results of the digging indicated
that no additional work was required at the Norman site. During
the course of the investigations there, however, another site was
located which appears to be an important one, and it was recommended
that further efforts in the Fort Gibson area be concentrated there.
Red River of the North Basin.—Between August 27 and October
29, 1948, Richard P. Wheeler, archeologist, investigated four Corps
of Engineers reservoir areas in the Red River of the North Drainage
Basin: the Homme Reservoir, under construction on the South Branch
of the Park River, the proposed Pembina River and Tongue River
Reservoirs, in northeastern North Dakota; and the proposed Orwell
Reservoir, on the Ottertail River, in west-central Minnesota. In
reports on those surveys, prepared at the Lincoln office of the River
Basin Surveys between November 5 and 19 and issued at Washington,
D. C., in December 1948, Wheeler noted the occurrence of sites in the
vicinity of the Homme and Orwell Reservoirs but recorded the dis-
covery of only one archeological site in the reservoir areas proper,
an occupation site in the Pembina River Reservoir. The finding of
bison bones in all four of the reservoir areas indicates that the river
valleys were formerly the habitat of bison and perhaps of other large
game and were possibly visited by hunting bands in prehistoric and
historic times. It was recommended that rechecks be made at the
Homme Reservoir, following the clearing of timber and underbrush,
82 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

and at the Pembina River and Orwell Reservoirs, at the time of the
construction of the dams, in order to make sure that no archeological
remains were overlooked.

Texas.—The River Basin Surveys continued to operate throughout
the year from the base and headquarters supplied by the Department
of Anthropology at the University of Texas, Austin, Tex. Sur-
veys were begun and carried to completion in five Corps of Engineers
reservoirs.

Robert L. Stephenson, archeologist, left Austin at the beginning of
the fiscal year and went to Fort Worth where he conferred with the
Engineer in Charge, Fort Worth Suboffice, Corps of Engineers,
preparatory to starting surveys of four reservoir basins on the upper
branches of the Trinity River.

During July he completed investigations at the Benbrook Reservoir
on the Clear Fork of the Trinity River in Tarrant County and at the
Grapevine Reservoir on Denton Creek in Tarrant and Denton Coun-
ties. No sites were found in the Benbrook basin and only 10, none
of which require further investigation, were noted at Grapevine. In
addition he made a 2-day reconnaissance in the areas of the Lavon
Reservoir on the East Fork of the Trinity River and Garza-Little
Elm Reservoir on the Elm Fork of the same stream. On the latter
trip R. K. Harris, Rex Housewright, and Lester Wilson, of the Dallas
Archeological Society, took him to sites that they had previously
located in the two areas.

On August 1, Mr. Stephenson accompanied Drs. Gustav A. Cooper
and A. R. Loeblich, Jr., of the United States National Museum, and
Robert Stark of Grapevine, Tex., to the vicinity of Bridgeport,
Wise County, to collect invertebrate fossils. He also visited the
Whitney Reservoir on the Brazos River, Hill County, and collected
mollusks, needed to check previous identifications, from several archeo-
logical sites. From there he went to the Texarkana Reservoir on the
Sulphur River, Bowie County, for the purpose of gathering informa-
tion regarding the dates of construction and of determining the neces-
sary time and extent of a survey for that basin. During the month
he also completed an intensive survey of the Garza—Little Elm basin
where he noted 27 sites, 7 of which were recommended for further
examination, and started investigations at the Lavon project. The
latter continued until September 17 and during the progress of the
work he made test excavations at two sites. The survey located 25
sites, of which 8 have been recommended for more intensive investiga-
tions. Both in the excavations and the survey he was greatly assisted
by the members of the Dallas Archeological Society and on September
10 spoke before a meeting of that organization. On September 18 he
started a survey of the San Angelo Reservoir area on the North Concho
SECRETARY’S REPORT 83

River in Tom Greene County, which was finished on October 10.
Only 13 small sites were located there, and as similar material is avail-
able elsewhere no further work was recommended for the basin.

Except for several short trips, Mr. Stephenson spent the remainder
of the fiscal year at the headquarters in Austin analyzing the materia!
collected and preparing reports on the summer’s surveys. He went to
Lincoln, Nebr., in November for the purpose of studying the field
and laboratory methods being used by the Missouri Basin group and
while there attended sessions of the Sixth Conference for Plains
Archeology and was appointed to the Committee on Archeological
Nomenclature. From January 2 to 7, he revisited the upper Trinity
River area to investigate reports of additional material having been
found there. Papers prepared by Stephenson during the months in
the laboratory are: ‘Archeological Survey of McGee Bend Reservoir,”
which was published in volume 19 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeo-
logical and Paleontological Society; ‘Archeological Survey of the
Lavon and Garza—Little Elm Reservoirs,’ to be published in volume
20 of the same journal; ‘‘A Note on Some Large Pits in Certain Sites
near Dallas, Texas,” printed in American Antiquity, vol. 15, No. 1;
a revision of his earlier report on the Whitney Reservoir which was
mimeographed and distributed by the Washington office in April;
and preliminary appraisals on the Benbrook, Grapevine, Garza—Little
Elm, and San Angelo surveys. He also wrote a summary statement
covering the results of the River Basin Surveys from their inception
in 1947 to June 30, 1949, and prepared a summary and table of the
culture sequences and their relationships in the Texas area as they
had been worked out up to that date.

Results of the year’s investigations established a number of facts.
In the survey of the Garza—Little Elm basin it was found that the
remains include key sites for the determination of the cultural
sequences in the area east of that known to have been inhabited by
groups classified as the Henrietta Focus and west of the known
Caddoan area. Similar sites have not been observed elsewhere. Very
little is known of the cultural sequences involved in the area drained
by the three forks of the Trinity River. The eight sites in the Lavon
basin recommended for more intensive examination are believed to
hold the answer to the problem of developments in the western border
of the Caddo area. At least one new culture remains to be defined
and described from the excavation of those sites. Furthermore, the
material from them should shed much light on the interrelation
between the cultures represented there and those to the east and west.

Cooperating institutions—Numerous State and local institutions
cooperated with the River Basin Surveys throughout the year and
made a definite contribution to the progress of the program. The
84 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

Universities of Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Texas provided
space for field offices and laboratories for regular units of the Surveys,
while the Universities of Denver, Colorado, and California, and
Western State College of Colorado supplied temporary bases of
operations for specific projects. The Universities of California,
Oklahoma, Oregon, and Washington joined forces with the Surveys
for some reconnaissance work and for the excavations at the Fort
Gibson, McNary, and O’Sullivan Reservoirs. In a number of cases
responsibility for units in the survey and excavation program was
assumed by State and local institutions.

The Museum of Northern Arizona and the University of Arizona
did some preliminary survey work, while the San Diego Museum of
Man conducted surveys and did some digging in the area of the Davis
Dam on the Colorado River between Arizona and Nevada. The Uni-
versity of Arkansas engaged in both reconnaissance and excavations
in the area of Bull Shoals Reservoir in that State. The California
Archeological Survey of the University of California conducted ex-
cavations at the Pine Flat and Isabella Reservoirs, while the Archeo-
logical Surveys Association of Southern California carried on recon-
naissance work in that part of the State. The Florida Park Service
surveyed the section in northern Florida that will be affected by the
Jim Woodruff Dam on the Apalachicola River near Chattahooche and
did some digging in a number of sites. The University of Georgia
continued its surveys along the Chattahooche and Flint Rivers and
conducted excavations at one site in the Allatoona Reservoir on the
Etowah River. In Illinois the University of Illinois, the University
of Chicago, and the Illinois State Museum furnished information
about the extent and character of sites in the basins of 15 reservoir
projects proposed for the Illinois River drainage. The Indiana His-
torical Bureau carried on surveys and did some excavating not only
at proposed Federal projects, but at those under State construction
as well.

The Museum of Natural History of the University of Kansas made
excavations at Kanopolis Reservoir in July and August of 1948 in sites
where the rising waters of the reservoir were already encroaching upon
the remains. The results of that work were reported on by Dr.
Carlyle S. Smith in an article, “Archeological Investigations in Ells-
worth and Rice Counties, Kansas,’ which appeared in American
Antiquity, vol. 14, No. 4, April 1949. In June of 1949 the same
institution was beginning investigations at the Glen Elder Reservoir
with other work planned for the Woodston, Webster, and Cedar Bluff
projects in the same region of the Solomon River drainage. In Ken-
tucky the University continued its program of excavations at the
Wolf Creek Reservoir on the Cumberland River and at the Dewey
SECRETARY’S REPORT 85

Reservoir on Johns Creek. The University of Missouri and the
Missouri Archeological Society again cooperated in making surveys
in a number of reservoirs and in excavating sites in the Missouri por-
tion of the Bull Shoals Reservoir and in the Clearwater and Pomme
de Terre basins on the Black and Pomme de Terre Rivers, respec-
tively. At the end of the year Montana State University was
starting field work at the Canyon Ferry Reservoir on the Missouri
River near Townsend, Mont.

The Laboratory of Anthropology of the University of Nebraska
was excavating in sites at the Harlan County Reservoir on the Re-
publican River in the southern part of the State at the start of the
fiscal year and had returned to the same locality for further activities
in June 1949. The work done during the summer of 1948 was de-
scribed by Dr. John L. Champe, in a report, ‘“‘White Cat Village,”
published in American Antiquity, vol. 14, No. 4, April 1949. The
Nebraska State Historical Society excavated a number of sites in the
Medicine Creek Reservoir area in the early months of the year and
in June had a party digging in the Mullen Reservoir area on the
Middle Loup River in the north-central part of the State. The Uni-
versity of Nebraska State Museum continued its paleontological and
archeological investigations in the Harlan County and Medicine
Creek Reservoir areas. One site in the Medicine Creek basin that
proved of particular interest because of its implications of consider-
able antiquity was described in an article, “The Frontier Culture
Complex, a Preliminary Report on a Prehistoric Hunter’s Camp in
Southwestern Nebraska,” written by Preston Holder and Joyce Wike
and printed in American Antiquity, vol. 14, No. 4, April 1949.

The University of North Dakota and the North Dakota Historical
Society cooperated in excavations at the Baldhill Reservoir in the
eastern part of the State in the summer of 1948, and toward the close
of the fiscal year were preparing for intensive survey work in the
Garrison Reservoir on the Missouri River near Sanish, N. Dak. The
results of the previous summer’s work were discussed by Dr. Gordon
W. Hewes in “Burial Mounds in the Baldhill Area, North Dakota,”
which appeared in the April 1949 issue of American Antiquity, vol.
14, No. 4. The Ohio State Museum did some survey and excavation
work. The University of Oklahoma, as previously mentioned, did
some digging at the Fort Gibson Reservoir and made independent
surveys in other areas. The University of Utah assumed responsi-
bility for surveys at a number of projects in the southwestern corner
of that State but at the close of the year had not yet started field
work. In Wisconsin, Beloit College made surveys and did some
digging in the Black River project.
86 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

The various cooperating organizations send progress and completed
reports to the River Basin Surveys so that the results of their work
may be coordinated with those for the over-all program. In this way
the information obtained by them becomes a part of the general
record of the River Basin Surveys.

SECRETARY’S REPORT 87

ARCHIVES

Research workers and students continued to use the manuscript
material and the archives both through personal visits for consulta-
tion and by correspondence. A number of manuscripts on the various
Iroquoian tribes were loaned to the Library of the American Philo-
sophical Society, Philadelphia, for use of students and research workers
in that field. The major task of carding the more important Indian
vocabularies has been begun with Indian and English divisions for
each. These vocabularies are being arranged so that they can be
expanded as new material arrives. Many of the Iroquoian vocabu-
laries collected by James Mooney, Erminnie Smith, and J. N. B.
Hewitt, as well as a Natchez vocabulary collected by A. S. Gatchet,
have been carded.

Some 5,000 prints and negatives, including both black and white
and color, have been made during the year for various purposes.
Considerable use was made during the fiscal year of the photographic
collections as illustrations for both scientific and commercial pur-
poses. The Walt Disney Studio and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer have
consulted the photographic files for authentic material in making
motion pictures dealing with Indian subjects.

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE

Srr: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activ-
ities of the International Exchange Service for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1949.

The Smithsonian Institution is the official United States agency for
the exchange with other nations of governmental, scientific, and lit-
erary publications. The International Exchange Service, initiated
by the Smithsonian Institution in the early years of its existence for
the interchange of scientific publications between learned societies
and individuals in the United States and those of foreign countries,
serves as a means of developing and executing in part the broad and
comprehensive object, “the diffusion of knowledge.” It was later
designated by the United States Government as the agency for the
transmission of official documents to selected depositories throughout
the world, and it continues to execute the exchanges pursuant to
conventions, treaties, and other international agreements.

The number of packages received for transmission during the year
was 840,125, an increase over the previous year of 80,006. The weight
of these packages was 796,700 pounds, a decrease of 15,489 pounds.
The average weight of the individual package is approximately 15
ounces, as compared with the average of the previous year of 1 pound,
1 ounce—an indication that the various institutions have almost
completed shipment of the material that was held during the war.
The material received from both foreign and domestic sources for
shipment is classified as shown in the following table:

The packages are forwarded either by mail direct to the addresses
or by freight to the exchange bureaus of foreign countries. The
number of boxes shipped to the foreign exchange bureaus was 3,296,
an increase of 189 over the previous year. Of the boxes shipped 650
were for depositories of full sets of United States Government docu-
ments furnished in exchange for the official publications of foreign
governments for deposit in the Library of Congress. ‘The number of
packages forwarded by mail was 155,402.

In spite of the fact that considerable savings in transportation
continued to be effected by exporting from Baltimore rather than
New York, and in spite of the advantage gained through special
arrangements for shipments to Germany, the allotment for trans-
portation was practically exhausted by the end of May 1949. There-
fore, it was necessary to curtail shipments sharply during the last
month of the fiscal year, and this resulted in a backlog of approxi-
mately 146,000 pounds.

Consignments are now forwarded to all countries except Rumania,
and efforts are continued to effect exchanges with that country.

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

The number of sets of United States official publications received
by the Exchange Service to be sent abroad in return for the official
publications sent by foreign governments for deposit in the Library
of Congress is 96 (58 full and 38 partial sets). The Government Book

APPENDIX 7
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1949.

The improved economic conditions were reflected in satisfactory
developments at the Zoo during the year. The animal collection was
gradually improved by obtaining rare or otherwise desirable animals
to fill available cages, and personnel recruitment and training pro-
gressed satisfactorily, although it was not possible to fill all vacancies.
With increased man power and more materials available, progress
was made in taking care of the most needed repairs, and minor im-
provements were completed.

As of June 30, 1949, there were 3,724 specimens in the collection, an
increase of 927 over the previous year. These represented 755 species,
an increase of 65. Not only was the collection increased in size, but
the quality was improved by the addition of animals that are not well
known, thereby adding to its educational value.

The National Zoological Park renders a variety of services to the
American public. Besides the animal exhibits and the providing of an
attractive recreation area, valuable opportunities are offered for
students of biology, particularly vertebrate zoology, as well as for
artists, photographers, writers, and research workers—utilizing
methods of research that do not endanger the welfare of the animals
or of the public. Other direct services are answering in person, by
phone, mail, and telegraph, questions regarding animals, their care
and transportation; the furnishing of information to other zoos and
private and public agencies regarding structures for keeping and
housing animals; and cooperation with other agencies of the Federal,
State, and municipal governments in research work.

THE EXHIBITS

Animals for the collection are acquired by gift, deposit, purchase,
exchange, births and hatchings, and are removed by return of speci-
mens on deposit, exchange, or death. Although depositors are at
liberty to remove the specimens that they place in the Zoo, many
leave the specimens for the rest of their lives.

97
98 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

As in any colony of living things, there is a steady turn-over, so
that the exhibits are constantly changing. Thus, the inventory list
of specimens in the collection on June 30 of each year does not show all
the kinds of animals that were exhibited during the year; sometimes
creatures of outstanding interest at the time they were shown are no
longer in the collection at the time the list is prepared.

ACCESSIONS

A great many interesting shipments have been received from abroad.
The Navy Medical Research Unit No. 3 sent through Lt. Robert E.
Kuntz a large collection of Egyptian reptiles, including a number of
species that the Zoo has never had before. The Institute of Scientific
Research, Madagascar, sent by air a group of leopard chameleons,
some Zonosaurus lizards, and two Dumeril’s boas. The San Diego
Zoological Society presented a beautiful specimen of the spectacled
bear. The Army Medical Research Center Laboratory in Malaya
sent through Maj. Robert Traub an interesting collection, including
two striking bamboo rats and eight different species of tree rats, none
of which had been exhibited heretofore. From the Zoological Society
of London was received an extensive shipment, including 4 Chinese
water deer, a kusimanse, some rare birds, and 2 of the rare Meller’s
chameleons.

Dr. Guillermo Mann of the University of Santiago, Santiago, Chile,
sent specimens of Gay’s frog and the unusual Bibron’s ‘‘toad”’ frog,
as well as three abrocomas, a rodent seldom seen in captivity. Pat
Putnam sent from the Belgian Congo chameleons and francolins.
Capt. John Miller of Panagra Airlines, Peri, shipped to the Zoo its
first pair of the rare pigmy marmosets, smallest of all the monkeys.

Among the outstanding receipts through purchases or exchanges
were an African two-horned rhinoceros, a pair of wombats, a king
cormorant, a trio of kelp geese, orang-utans and chimpanzees. The
latter are to replace the stock that some years ago was destroyed by
an epidemic.

William T. Miller, after resigning from the Army, spent some time
in Panamé and sent several shipments including a pigmy anteater
and a great rufous motmot. Dr. A. Reventlow of the Zoological
Garden at Copenhagen, Denmark, presented to the Zoo its first pair
of whooper swans. From the Zoo in Rotterdam, Holland, were
received a king cobra and some ruffs. In an air shipment from
Australia came reptiles of more than a dozen species, including the
carpet python, diamond python, and a number of rare lizards and
turtles.

FEEDING THE ANIMALS

To feed such a collection of animals with their varied requirements
presents a considerable problem. At the beginning of the war, prices
for many of the green types of food had gone so high that the use of
such material was almost prohibitive, although it is essential for the
well-being of many of the animals. Therefore the Zoo inaugurated a
system of obtaining from nearby grocery stores the outer leaves of
lettuce, cabbage, cauliflower, and other material that would normally
go into the refuse. This material is picked up daily and is sorted to
make certain that it is in suitable condition. The animals have
thrived, the cost for such green food has been held to a minimum, and
it was thus possible to keep out of competition for human food when
such material was scarce. The arrangement has been so satisfactory
that it is being continued.

During the war the United States Marshal’s office made arrange-
ments to turn over to the Zoo food that had been condemned in the
courts as unsuitable for human consumption. That office has con-
tinued to send considerable quantities and many different kinds of
such food. The Zoo also frequently receives offers from private
individuals or business houses of food that they wish to dispose of
without having to go through the court procedure of condemnation.
Thus diversified food was received for the animals, which greatly
aided in keeping down the cost of feeding.

MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS

In the lion house many of the old cages were extensively repaired,
and a portion of the steam conduit under the building was repaired
and improved. Concrete floors were laid in the outside cages at the
monkey house, and 6-inch concrete slabs were laid between the
sidewalk and the cages around the stone cat houses. A sidewalk was
built from the small-mammal house to the walk between the reptile
house and the antelope building.

By clearing and surfacing additional land, the capacity of the bus-
parking area was increased from 20 to 40 busses. The capacity of the
automobile-parking area also was increased from 650 to 750 auto-
mobiles.

For the third successive year the fight by chemical means against
poison ivy continued, and very little of this plant pest remains in
areas commonly frequented by the public. Increased efforts have
been directed toward improving the appearance of the grounds,
caring for the lawns, planting trees and shrubs, and carrying on other
gardening work. As a whole, satisfactory progress has been made in
returning to normal maintenance.
106 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

VISITORS

The total attendance was 3,346,050, an increase of 305,510 over the
previous year. ‘This was the largest attendance in the history of the
Zoo and is probably due in part to the continued high employment in
the Washington area, increase in travel accompanying the general
economic prosperity, and the frequency with which we were able to
announce the addition of interesting specimens to the collection.
The variation in attendance on the different days of the week which
was so extreme before the war has been much less noticeable since the
war. Formerly early days of the week had relatively low attendance,
with an increasing number of visitors the latter portion of the week
and with very large crowds on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.
There is also a considerable increase in attendance in the earlier hours
of the day.

About 2 p. m. each day the cars then parked in the Zoo are counted
by the Zoo police and listed according to the State, Territory, or
country from which they came. This is, of course, not a census of
the cars eoming to the Zoo, but is valuable in showing the percentage

The cars that made up the remaining 10.30 percent came from
every one of the remaining States, as well as from Alaska, Bahamas,
Canada, Canal Zone, Chile, Cuba, Guam, Hawaii, Honduras, Italy,
Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Newfoundland, Poland, Puerto Rico,
Sweden, Trieste, Trinidad, and Virgin Islands.

It is well known that District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia
cars bring to the Zoo many people from other parts of the United
States and of the world, but no figures are available on which to base
percentages.

FINANCES

The regular appropriation provided in the District of Columbia
appropriation act was $492,600, and there was a supplemental appro-
priation in the second deficiency bill of $36,248 to provide for the
increased salaries of $330 per annum authorized by Congress. Of
the total of $528,848 which was available, about $11,474 will remain
unexpended, subject to minor changes in final bills. This saving
was mainly from salaries because of the impossibility of filling posi-
tions promptly.

The stone restaurant building, which was constructed in the park
in 1940 under an allotment of $90,000, is under a 3-year lease obtained
by competitive bidding at $10,212 per annum. This money is de-
posited in the general fund of the United States Treasury. The
concessionaire serves meals and light refreshments, and sells novelties.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

The chief need of the Zoo is for the replacement of antiquated
structures that have long since ceased to be suitable for the purpose.
The more urgently needed buildings are: (1) A new administration
building to replace the 144-year-old historic landmark now in use for
an office building for the Zoo, but which is neither suitably located nor
well adapted for the purpose. This building is in an excellent loca-
tion for a public recreational structure, and could probably be rehabili-
tated and used for recreational purposes, perhaps as a children’s
108 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

museum, and thus maintained as a historic building. The new
office building should be better located both from the standpoint of
accessibility to the public and convenience for the administration of
the Zoo. (2) A new building to house antelopes and other medium-
size hoofed animals that require a heated building.

APPENDIX 8
REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1949:

The Observatory includes two research divisions: (1) the Division
of Astrophysical Research, concerned chiefly with solar radiation
problems, and (2) the Division of Radiation and Organisms, con-
cerned with the biological effects of radiation.

During the year a new room adjoining the Director’s office was
built for the administrative assistant and for the files of the Obeerva-
tory. The resulting consolidation of needed information nsar at
hand has materially improved the efficiency of operation.

Considerable progress can be reported concerning the new revised
editions of the Smithsonian Meteorological Tables and the Smith-
sonian Physical Tables, mentioned in last year’s report. R. J. List,
editor of the Meteorological Tables revision, had practically completed
his manuscript at the end of the fiscal year. The difficult task of
revising the Physical Tables, the last revision of which had been issued
in 1934, was begun in September 1948 under the direction of Dr.
W.E. Forsythe. An office in Cleveland, Ohio, and an assistant were
furnished to Dr. Forsythe. At the close of the fiscal year he reports
that approximately one-half of the tables for the new edition have
been completed.

(1) DIVISION OF ASTROPHYSICAL RESEARCH

Previous to 1946 the Observatory had for many years maintained
three high-altitude field stations for solar-constant observations. In
1946 the Tyrone station, which for 7 years had been operated on
Burro Mountain (altitude 8,000 ft.) in southwestern New Mexico,
was abandoned because skies there had progressively deteriorated,
mainly the result of increasing mining and smelting operations in that
general region. As a temporary measure, to aid in certain studies
referred to below under contract with the Quartermaster Corps, the
Tyrone station equipment was transferred to and installed at Miami,
Fla. Since then much effort has been spent to find the most suitable
location for a third high-altitude field station to replace the aban-
doned Tyrone site. In last year’s report we mentioned that after

109
110 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

careful investigation three promising sites had been chosen for further
study and that in May 1948 a recording Eppley pyrheliometer was
installed at each of these sites, namely, (1) Torreén, Coahuila, Méx-
ico; (2) Mountain Pass, near Clark Mountain, California; and (3)
Pohakuola, Hawaii. The three pyrheliometers were operated for a
period of 1 year, ending June 1949. The resulting records indicate
the uniformity and the quality of the sky for each day during the
period. It is clear from the records that the best skies prevailed
at the Clark Mountain location. The second-best site was Poha-
kuola. This spot, 6,500 feet above sea level on the Island of Hawaii,
yielded some records of unusually clear and uniform skies, but such
skies were not the rule. At Clark Mountain, during the period
June 8 to March 31, there were 171 days with skies sufficiently good
for satisfactory observations, while at Table Mountain, Calif., during
the same period actual observations were made on 135 days. From
studies of these records and other sources, it appears that the Clark
Mountain region is in general considerably drier and more free of
haze and clouds than any other high-altitude location at present
known in the northern hemisphere.

In view of this, estimates were obtained of the cost of establishing
a field station at an altitude of 6,500 feet on the south slope of Clark
Mountain. Owing to the prevailing high prices for building materials
and labor, the estimates proved to be in excess of available funds.
It is hoped that sufficient funds may become available, but pending
this the Observatory plans immediately to enlarge its facilities at
Table Mountain sufficiently so that it will be possible to proceed
without delay with the special experimental problems mentioned in
last year’s report.

Work at Washington—W. H. Hoover, Chief of the Division, in
addition to supervision of the work in progress, prepared data and
tables which will help to simplify the computations in the field. In
the past, to obtain the air mass (or length of path of the solar beam
in the atmosphere) it has been necessary to plot carefully a series
of theodolite readings against time, to read off desired altitude values,
and finally to enter an air-mass-altitude table. With the aid of
Hoover’s data, the observer, by reading the theodolite at specified
intervals, may enter the tables directly to determine the air mass.
This eliminates the tedious curve-plotting process.

A new instrument, designed by Dr. John W. Evans, of the High
Altitude Observatory of Harvard University, and described by him
in the Journal of the Optical Society of America, December 1948, was
kindly lent to the Astrophysical Observatory by Dr. Menzel of Har-
vard University to test and to determine its adaptability to Smith-
sonian work. The instrument is a photometer especially designed
SECRETARY'S REPORT 111

for determining the brightness of the sky immediately surrounding
the sun. Excellent results have been obtained with it at the Harvard
Station at Climax, Colo. It is of considerable interest to compare its
readings with simultaneous readings of the Smithsonian pyranometer
which also measures the brightness of the sky in a zone around the
sun. In preparation for comparison tests a rigid mounting has been
prepared for the instrument with slow-motion adjustment in altitude
and azimuth.

During the fiscal year, two silver-disk pyrheliometers, Nos. 80 and
81, were built, calibrated and sold at cost, one to the Hebrew Institute
of Technology, Haifa, Palestine, and the other to the Dublin Institute
for Advanced Learning. Inaddition two modified Angstrom pyrheliom-
eters and one special instrument for the spectroscopic determination
of atmospheric water vapor have been prepared for the Belgium
Meteorological Institute. These were nearly completed at the end
of the year.

Dr. C. G. Abbot, research associate of the Observatory, continued
his studies of the dependence of weather upon solar changes. This
work has been published in Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,
vol.111, Nos. 5,6, and 7. Dr. Arctowski’s studies of solar and terres-
trial atmospheres were retarded by illness, but his work was resumed
before the close of the year.

Work win the field——Daily observations of the solar constant were
in progress throughout the year, as far as skies permitted, both at
Montezuma, Chile, and at Table Mountain, Calif. The skies during
the year were apparently normal at Table Mountain, but at Monte-
zuma, the observers noted an unusual number of days with light cirrus
clouds.

Early in the year Mr. Hoover carried the Observatory’s substandard
silver-disk pyrheliometer S. I. No. 5 to Miami for direct comparisons
with the pyrheliometers at that station. In February 1949, in the
course of changing the personnel at Montezuma, Chile, substandard
S. 1. No. 5 was carried to Montezuma by the new Montezuma ob-
server, and brought back in April by the retiring observer, after inter-
comparisons had been made in Chile. The previous year S. I. No. 5
had been carried to Table Mountain by the director for similar inter-
comparisons. Thus there are now very recent direct comparisons
between all field pyrheliometers and substandard S. I. No. 5, which
in turn was carefully compared in 1947 with the absolute water-flow
standard. These many intercomparisons show no material changes
in constants. They satisfactorily confirm the adopted scale of pyr-
heliometry. A revision of Dr. Abbot’s paper of 1922 on “The Silver-
disk Pyrheliometer”’ is in preparation, summarizing the constants of
all silver-disk pyrheliometers, and describing certain changes which
112 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

have been adopted in recent years, both in the instrument itself and
in the method of use.

In June 1945 special radiation measurements were started at Camp
Lee, Va., under contract with the Office of the Quartermaster General,
in connection with their long-range study of the causes for the deteri-
oration of tents and tent materials. This contract has been renewed
each year since then, and the work has now extended to include similar
radiation measurements at Miami, Fla., a wet, sea-level station, and
at Montezuma, Chile, a dry, high-altitude station. The Observatory
completed the Camp Lee measurements January 1, 1948, and since
then they have been continued by the Quartermaster Board at Camp
Lee, with the Observatory acting in an advisory capacity, and giving
assistance when difficulties arise. The measurements at Miami,
begun in December 1947, have continued throughout the present
fiscal year. Similar radiation measurements and textile exposures
were begun at Montezuma, Chile, in December 1948, and will continue
approximately 2 years. Five reports to the Office of the’ Quarter-
master General were made during the year summarizing,the data
obtained at Miami and at Montezuma.

In January 1949, the Director visited the Miami field station, to
inspect the work in progress. While there he obtained special bolo-
graphs showing the absorption effects of known quantities of water
vapor in the atmosphere. Measurements of these bolographs con-
firmed the correctness of precipitable water curves which Mr. Fowle
had determined in earlier work at Washington and which have since
been used many times in our solar-constant program. This work is
discussed in Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, vol. 111, No. 12,
soon to be issued.

(2) DIVISION OF RADIATION AND ORGANISMS
(Report prepared by Dr. R. B. Withrow)

The work of the Division for the past year has been concerned
chiefly with reorganizing and reequipping the laboratories. New
office space has been established in conjunction with the basement
laboratories. These offices have been furnished with desks and cases
and will accommodate a maximum of nine individuals.

Most of the laboratories have been repainted and are being re-
equipped with modern lighting facilities. The laboratory furniture
has been reconditioned and new metal furniture ordered to supplement
that already available.

Five rooms are being converted into constant-condition rooms for
biological experimentation with equipment for controlling the tem-
perature, humidity, radiation, and nutritional environment.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 113

Four chemistry laboratories will be available, including a general
laboratory, a balance room, a dark room held at room temperature
for pigment analyses, and an insulated and air-conditioned dark room
controlled at 0° C. or above for protein and enzyme analyses.

In addition, a photographic laboratory, a room for X-ray facilities,
a cytology laboratory, an electronics laboratory, and two general
laboratories are being set up, all of which are being designed with
new plumbing to supply gas, compressed air, and water, and with
new electrical power outlets.

The Research Corporation has very generously made a grant to the
Division for reequipping the laboratories with modern experimental
facilities and for work on the mechanism of visible radiation on growth
processes in plants. The Division also has been assigned a contract
by the Chemical Corps, Department of the Army, providing funds for
personnel and equipment for research on the effect of growth regula-
tors on metabolic activities of plant tissues.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 9
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL AIR MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Air Museum for the fiscal year ended June 30,

1949.
INTRODUCTION

This year, the first full year of the National Air Museum as a
bureau of the Smithsonian Institution, was one of many activities.
In addition to normal museum operations, the bureau was concerned
especially with the return from England of the Wright Brothers’
renowned aeroplane, the Kitty Hawk; with the acquisition and man-
agement of a field storage facility; with the accession of the U.S. Air
Force aircraft collection; and with the basic study and planning for
a site and building for the aeronautical collections.

Karly in 1948 the Institution was informed that the late Dr. Orville
Wright had expressed the desire to present the Kitty Kawk to the
United States National Museum and that the executors of Dr. Wright’s
estate would institute the necessary legal action to bring this about.
Prior to the receipt of this news the Smithsonian had effected the
administrative transfer of all aeronautical museum activities and ex-
perienced personnel from the National Museum to the newly estab-
lished National Air Museum. Therefore, in order to have the expert
assistance of the Air Museum staff, the Secretary, through the
Director of the National Museum, delegated to the National Air
Museum the responsibility for the reception, exhibition, and preserva-
tion of the Wright plane. The details are indicated under Curatorial
Activities presented later in this report.

Negotiations begun last year with the U. S. Air Force to acquire a
storage depot for the Air Museum were successfully consummated on
November 1, 1948. On that date the bureau was granted occupancy
of 267,475 square feet of floor space within building T-6 of the former
Douglas Aircraft plant at Chicago Orchard Airport, Park Ridge, IIL.,
and installed a field organization to operate the facility. On the same
date the Museum assumed tentative custody (pending inventory) of
the large aircraft collection stored in this building by the Air Force
and on May 1, 1949, upon completion of the inventory, assumed full
responsibility for its preservation.

SECRETARY'S REPORT 115

Along with these several extra activities the bureau continued, with
the Office of Design and Construction of the Public Buildings Ad-
ministration, the further study of sites and a building for the Museum.
This was done in accordance with the recommendation of the Advisory
Board. The result of the study is recorded later in this report.

No changes were made during the year in the departmental organi-
zation of the bureau except the occasional employment of temporary
clerical help. This was especially necessary in connection with the
reception and exhibition of the Wright Brothers’ aeroplane. The
bureau found it difficult, on the other hand, to fill several positions
available at its field storage facility because of the higher wage scale
prevailing in the Chicago area for comparable work. As a result,
the work program planned for this field organization was not fully
carried out. In all other respects the bureau completed the year in

good condition.
ADVISORY BOARD

In April of this year the Board experienced a change in membership
as a result of the retirement of its U. S. Air Force representative,
Maj. Gen. E. M. Powers. General Powers had served on the Board
since its Inception late in 1946, having been designated to the office
by General Spaatz. His wise counsel during the formative days of
the establishment of the National Air Museum was most helpful. To
succeed him on the Board, Gen. H. H. Vandenberg, Chief of Staff,
Department of the Air Force, designated Maj. Gen. Grandison
Gardner who met with the Board for the first time at its sixth meeting
in June 1949.

During the year three meetings of the Advisory Board were held
in Washington, on August 26, 1948, December 20, 1948, and June 29,
1949. Deliberations in these meetings were directed principally to-
ward the advancement of the Air Museum’s major projects, namely,
the acquisition of a building site and a suitable museum building in
the Washington area.

As directed by the Board at its August 1948 meeting, the study of
a suitable museum building was continued this year in cooperation
with the Public Buildings Administration.

STORAGE OF MUSEUM MATERIAL

In accordance with a resolution adopted by the Advisory Board
last year, the bureau completed negotiations on November 1, 1948,
to take over the storage operations of that portion of one of the former
Douglas Aircraft buildings (T-6) at the Chicago Orchard Airport,
Park Ridge, Ill., containing the collection of aeronautical museum
material stored there by the United States Air Force for the National
116 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

Air Museum. Some additional floor space within this building, ad-
jacent to that containing the Air Force collection, together with two
two-floor structures erected therein and suitable for office use, was
acquired at the same time.

Immediately following this transaction the bureau installed a field
organization to operate the facility, consisting of an associate curator
in charge, an aircraft technician, and a guard force to patrol the area
24 hoursa day. Until February 1, 1949, the military personnel of the
Air Materiel Command of the U. S. Air Force, which had been
detailed to care for the Air Force collection, remained on duty to assist
the bureau’s organization in readying itself to assume its responsibil-
ities. With this accomplished, three programs of work were initiated:
(1) The rearrangement by classes of the aeronautical materials packed
in boxes and crates; (2) the cleaning and sealing of all openings of
assembled aircraft and rust-proofing of component parts; and (3)
the inspection and inventory of all items composing the collection
preparatory to its transfer from the Air Force to the Air Museum.

On May 1, 1949, the inventory was completed and the transfer was
effected of 1,366 aeronautical objects including 97 aircraft to the Air
Museum. The preservation work was in progress at the end of the
year.

While these activities were in progress the bureau took steps to
provide the maximum protection of the materials in storage. In
addition to the acquisition of hand fire extinguishers installed in fixed
positions over the area and of larger extinguishers mounted on hand
trucks, an intercommunicating system was selected and a contract
let for its installation at 12 stations distributed strategically over the
Museum’s storage area. This will enable a guard on patrol to com-
municate quickly with the administration office in any emergency.
The bureau also designed and contracted for the construction and
erection of a high wire fence to enclose the major part of the area.
These projects were in progress at the end of the year.

PLANNING
MUSEUM SITE AND BUILDING

During the year the bureau continued the investigation of sites and
a building for the Air Museum. For this purpose it had the valuable
cooperation of the Federal Works Agency, Public Buildings Adminis-
tration, Office of Design and Construction, through an arrangement
involving the transfer of funds.

Planning and designing a museum building for aircraft and aviation
collections involves factors not usually encountered in museum struc-
tures. For example, although the history of practical aviation spans
a comparatively short period of years, the steps in its development
SECRETARY'S REPORT 117

are many. Therefore, there must be imposed limitations of selection
of materials of both historical and technological significance not only
to avoid incomprehensive public displays but also impractical housing
requirements. The aeronautical collections will include material
both of small and uncommonly great dimensions and weight. Ex-
perience indicates that approximately 30 percent of the total available
floor area of a technical museum structure is required for its mainte-
nance and operations services and that for the safety of the visiting
public ample passageways must be established in all exhibition areas.
It can be readily understood that these requirements necessitate a
compromise between the ideal and a realistic aviation museum buiding.
Both the Advisory Board and the bureau’s staff gave careful atten-
tion during the year to factors such as these which brought about a
number of changes in the plans originally developed last year.

CURATORIAL ACTIVITIES

The curator, Paul E. Garber, reports on the year’s work as follows:

At the beginning of the fiscal year the staff was moved into new and
improved quarters which provided more facilities for the expanding
personnel. Office and shop equipment were acquired, an efficient
procedure for handling correspondence was adopted, and added space
was allocated to the library, the reference files, and the photographic
files. The constant efforts of the staff in the maintenance of the
exhibits are reflected in the improvement of individual displays, but
the extreme overcrowding in the present Aircraft Building and the
Aeronautical Hall assigned to the bureau in the Arts and Industries
Building has approached the danger point to both visitors and speci-
mens. Asaresult, the addition of large exhibits has been brought to a
standstill. Happily, the facility at Park Ridge, Ill., provides for the
storage of material which might otherwise be lost to the Museum.
Only by the acquisition of a permanent building for the Museum in
the Washington area can this situation be corrected.

EXHIBITION

The outstanding accomplishment of the year was the receipt of the
Wright Brothers’ aeroplane of 1903 and its exhibition and preparation
for the presentation ceremony on December 17, 1948, the forty-fifth
anniversary of its historic flight. The curator was assigned the
pleasant duty of representing the Smithsonian in meeting Dr. Herman
Shaw, Director of the Science Museum, London, and of accepting
from him at Halifax, Nova Scotia, custody of the aeroplane, This
was effected on November 12, and following the transfer of the aero-
plane from the S. S. Mauretania to the Navy Carrier U.S. S. Palau,
the curator accompanied the plane to Bayonne, N. J., saw to its re-
loading on a Navy truck and accompanied the truck canvoy to the
118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

National Museum. There the Spirit of St. Louis had been moved so
that the two noted aircraft could share the same North Hall of the
Arts and Industries Building and, with the assistance of photographs
and drawings provided by M. J. B. Davy of the Science Museum, the
Kitty Hawk was assembled. Some details of the engine and trans-
mission were installed from sketches and photographs furnished by
Charles Taylor, the mechanic who assisted the Wrights in the original
construction of the plane and engine. The aeroplane was suspended
in the front of the hall with cables and splices donated by the Jacoel
Equipment Co. At the ceremony of presentation, the “Karly Birds,”
the association of pioneer pilots, many of whom had been trained by
the Wrights, were among the honored guests. A number of them have
since augmented the Kitty Hawk exhibit by donations of their own
records and relics. Acknowledgments are also made to the Air Force
Technical Museum and to S. Dunham, Dayton, Ohio, for photographs
and drawings for addition to the Museum’s reference and exhibition
material on the Wrights. At the close of the fiscal year progress is
being made on an auxiliary exhibition case to be placed under the
Kitty Hawk in which the story of the Wright Brothers will be told in
detail.

As the National Air Museum progresses, its purposes and services
have become better known, and very helpful cooperation has been
received in the matter of accessions. The following examples are
outstanding. The presentation of Alford Williams’ renowned Gulf-
hawk-2 October 11, followed an impressive flight-demonstration of the
remarkable aerobatic combination of pilot and plane. The Gulf Oil
Company formally presented the airplane at the National Airport and
soon after, Major Williams’ technician, Frank Tye, who had main-
tained the plane in splendid condition throughout its 12 years of stren-
uous flying, assembled it in the Aeronautical Hall. The Department
of the Navy, Bureau of Aeronautics, repaired and transferred a Jap-
anese Baka Bomb to the Museum and provided, as auxiliary material,
examples of both jet and rocket engines used in these “‘suicide planes.”
The collection of scale models which reviews the evolution of aircraft
used in Naval service was improved by 10 recent types received from
manufacturers who produced the original planes for the Navy. The
Department of the Navy assisted also in the special anniversary cele-
bration held in the Aircraft Building to commemorate the thirtieth
anniversary of the first trans-Atlantic aircraft flight made by the
NC-4. An illustrated description of this Curtiss-built flying boat,
the hull of which is in the Museum, was prepared by the staff and
printed by courtesy of the Curtiss-Wright Corporation. Speakers
included Vice Adm. John D. Price, U. S. N., and Capt. Holden C.
Richardson, U.S. N., Ret.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 119

The first Roadable Autogyro, transferred from the Civil Aeronautics
Administration, was reconditioned by them for museum purposes.
In the previous report, the services of the Air Force were acknowledged
in moving the Army Curtiss Racer from the Aircraft Building to the
Aeronautical Hall—a move made necessary by restricted space. This
year, the plane was equipped with the original floats with which Lt.
(now General) James Doolittle won the Schneider Trophy Race in
1925. The bracing wires for this restoration were kindly provided
by the MacWhyte Company, Kenosha, Wis. Valuable assistance
was received this year from the Air Force in unloading and mounting
four large engines donated by the Wright Aeronautical Corporation,
in covering with Plexiglas the sides of the DeHavilland—4 and Gen.
William Mitchell’s Spad—-16, and in replacing the windows in the first
nonstop transcontinental airplane, the 7-2.

The exhibit which illustrates the accomplishments of John Joseph
Montgomery of California, a renowned pioneer of gliding whose first
glides were made in 18838, received additions through the cooperation
of the Montgomery family, the San Diego Junior Chamber of Com-
merce, and the biographer, Winsor Josselyn. ‘Through the generosity
of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, the wheels on the Voisin
bomber of World War I were equipped with tires. In the auxiliary
exhibit which accompanies the Flagplane of the First World Flight,
the group of portrait sculptures were renovated by its sculptor, Joseph
A. Atchison, and the stereopticon story of this flight was reactivated.
A special exhibition of model aircraft as flown by hobby enthusiasts
was prepared in August 1948 during the period of the national show
and contest. Improvements were made in the display of Col. Charles
Lindbergh’s accessories and flight clothing. Extensive cleaning,
rearranging, labeling, and repairing have brought the exhibits to a
condition believed to be as presentable as the crowded conditions and
work program permit.

Special exhibitions arranged by the staff and involving the use of
Museum material away from the bureau included a group of cases
set up by Bolling Field for the Air Force anniversary on September 18,
containing engines, models, and relics of the military air arm; and the
loan of the original Liberty engine and models of historic Air Force
planes for the technical exhibit and air show held at Andrews Field,
Maryland, February 15.

STORAGE

Among the numerous aircraft installed this year in the Museum’s
storage facility at Park Ridge, IIl., was the Swoose, flown there under
its own power. This historic B-17—D bomber had served throughout
World War II from Bataan to the defeat of Japan. Completing its
military career as the command plane of Gen. George H. Brett, the

866591—50 9
120 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

Swoose was acquired by the city of Los Angeles as a war memorial.
In 1948 the city, through Mayor Fletcher Bowron, presented the plane
to the National Air Museum, and with the cooperation of Grover
Loening and Maj. Gen. E. M. Powers of the Advisory Board, arrange-
ments were made for the reconditioning of the plane by the Air Force.
In due time this was accomplished under the direction of the Swoose’s
wartime flight engineer, Captain Boone, and in April 1949, with its
wartime pilot, Col. Frank Kurtz, at the controls, the plane was flown
to the Chicago Orchard Airport and delivered there to the Museum’s
storage facility. The Air Force cooperated not only in this spectacular
delivery but also in the tremendous project of transferring its huge
collection of trophy aircraft and accessories to Museum custody.
The screening, cataloging, and arrangement of this stored collection
at Park Ridge was under way as the year closed.

The historic and trophy aircraft and engines which are being
assembled for the Museum by the Department of the Navy are
stored at Norfolk, Va. During the year the curator inspected this
facility, checking the condition of the NC—4’s wings and other parts,
the Japanese ‘‘Emily,’”’ the German Dornier 335 which had recently
been moved there, and the service types which are in ‘‘canned”’ con-
tainers. All were in good condition.

Acknowledgments are made to Eastern Air Lines for earmarking
one of its first DC-3’s for the collection, to the Civil Aeronautics
Administration for reserving its famous Boeing 247—D for the Mu-
seum, and to the Martin Aircraft Company for the gift of a half-scale
flight prototype of the PBM ‘‘Mariner.” These will be stored tem-
porarily by the donors.

INFORMATIONAL SERVICES

Interest in the Museum is widespread, and its services to the
industry, Government departments, students, research workers, his-
torians, authors, craftsmen, and the air fraternity in general are daily
becoming more in demand as reflected in the numbers of inquiries
and requests received by letter, personal visit, and telephone. Radio
programs in which the Museum participated included, Information
Please, We The People, and the Air Force Hour. The curator told
the story of the Swoose over the radio both in Los Angeles and Omaha,
and television programs illustrated the Kitty Hawk, Gulfhawk-2, the
NC-4, and the Museum’s model collection.

The Bureau of Ordnance, Department of the Navy, borrowed a
number of the Museum’s scale models to be used as patterns for re-
search problems; the Interior Department was assisted with aero-
nautical details in some of its museum dioramas; the Public Schools
of the District of Columbia received help in conducting their aero-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 121

nautical courses; and Pan American Airways was loaned photographs
of Santos-Dumont’s airships for use in its publicity displays on Brazil.
The historic sections of the Aircraft Year Book were compiled with
help of the Museum staff; Bettman Archive received identification on
a group of unlabeled photographs of airplanes; the Prewitt Aircraft
Company used the Museum’s reference files during their search for
details of rotary aircraft; and the United States Chamber of Com-
merce and the Vallejo, Calif., museum, received assistance in display-
ing exhibits.

Another edition of the Handbook of the National Aircraft Collection
was issued, embodying changes which bring it up to date. This is
the eighth printing of 10,000 since the first issue in 1928. During the
year the curator lectured on technical and historical aspects of flight
and the progress of the National Air Museum to the Aero Club of
Washington, the Air Transport Association, the ‘99ers’”’ association
of women flyers, the Washington Association of Building Superin-
tendents, the Civitan Club, several local fraternal and church groups,
and served as judge of scale-model craftsmanship at the National
Capital Air Show, and at a kite contest held by local units of the
Boy Scouts.

In conducting its informational services the staff acknowledges the
help given by members of the “Early Birds,” collectors of aeronautical
photographs and clipping scrapbooks, pilots, manufacturers, airmen,
and many others who donated reference material to the Museum’s data
files and library. These helpful source data are assembled and readily
available for serious study.

SURVEY

The survey over the Nation of aeronautical materials of technical
and historical significance was continued during the year. Much of
the work was conducted by staff correspondence. Frequently, how-
ever, it became necessary to undertake direct investigation and study
of suggested material and consultations with those acquainted with
the material. It was in this connection, primarily, that the following
visits away from Washington were made by the staff:

Middletown, Pa., Olmsted Air Force Base, July 23, by associate curator Robert
C. Strobell, to examine a group of Japanese trophy airplanes which had been
evaluated and tested.

Buffalo, N. Y., Airport, August 31, by associate curator Stephen L. Beers, to in-
spect two Curtiss engines used in early Naval aircraft and two French engines
of World War I.

Roosevelt Field, Long Island, N. Y., and East Orange, N. J., October 11-16, by
the curator, to examine a group of historic American, English, and French
airplanes and to determine the availability of a Benoist airplane of 1912.

Halifax, Nova Scotia, November 9-22, by the curator, to obtain the Wright
Brothers’ aerop!ane of 1903.
122 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

Los Angeles, Calif., Inglewood Field, and March Field, January 19-29, by the
curator, to receive, recondition, and test hop the Boeing B-17~D bomber
Swoose.

Aberdeen and Baltimore, Md., March 15, by Mr. Beers, to inspect aircraft and
obtain a scale model of the Martin bomber, type MB-1 of 1918.

Jackson Center, Ohio, May 28, by Mr. Strobell, to arrange receipt and shipment
of Benoist airplane.

Langley Field, Va., May 23-25, by the curator and Mr. Beers, to attend the
National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics conference and inspect
material of museum significance.

Miami, Fla., June 15-18, by Mr. Beers, to attend Eastern Airlines conference and
inspect equipment and aircraft made available to the Museum.

Numerous trips were made by staff members between the base and
field units in connection with management of the storage area and
procurement and placement of accessions.

ACCESSIONS

New accessions totaled 122 objects from 40 sources. The majority
of these were solicited by the Museum and involved considerable prior
research by the staff to determine the significance and need of each
object in the over-all picture of the history and development of aero-
nautics. In addition, each accession required staff attention in a
variable amount in arranging for the procurement and shipment of the
object and in incorporating it into the aeronautical collection.

Except where otherwise indicated the accessions received this year
and listed below were entered in the Museum’s records as gifts or
transfers:

APPENDIX 10
REPORT ON THE CANAL ZONE BIOLOGICAL AREA

Sir: It gives me pleasure to present herewith the annual report of
the Canal Zone Biological Area for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1949.

IMPROVEMENTS MADE

A new building, halfway up to the laboratory level and near the
generators, was completed. The ground floor will be used largely
for the woodworking machinery and carpenter shop, the upper part
as living quarters for the warden-caretaker. The old cottage just
below the large laboratory building, formerly occupied by the warden-
caretaker, has been converted into a very desirable two-room lab-
oratory unit. The forest is close by, making the building exception-
ally suitable for observation and study of mammals and other forms.

Work on the 14,000-gallon concrete gravity-flow water tank was
halted by heavy rains which made it impossible to use the truck and
large concrete mixer. However, the excavation is made and the
gravel and reinforcement iron are at the site; 2 or 3 weeks of dry
weather will permit completion of the tank.

During the year, from allocated funds, the launch Snook was
purchased from The Panama Canal. This is a very sturdy, well-
built boat 40 feet long, with an 11-foot beam—large enough to ac-
commodate 40 passengers. It is in very good condition and will
serve even for towing.

New generators were installed during the year, providing a depend-
able source of electricity for continuous use.

Eight steel herbarium cases, needed for many years, have been
received and the herbarium specimens transferred to them. These
specimens are now in excellent condition. Eight steel storage cabinets
were also received, providing dustproof storage for much of the
laboratory equipment.

SCIENTISTS AND THEIR STUDIES

Twenty-nine scientists came to the laboratory during the year.
Although many of them stayed only a short time, their acquaintance
with the island and its facilities will no doubt bring others to the
laboratory in the near future. The contribution of these scientists
has added materially to our knowledge of life under tropical conditions.

126
SECRETARY'S REPORT 127

Dr. Franz Schrader and Dr. Sally Hughes Schrader returned to
continue their cytological studies.

Dr. Frank A. Hartman and Robert Albertin, of the Department
of Physiology of the Ohio State University, spent some time on the
island, and used the laboratory as their base for excursions up the
Chagres River Basin and into the Volc4n region of Chiriqui Province.
They studied in great detail the anatomy of the adrenals in sloths
and the coati-mundi while on the island. The adrenals of more
than 600 vertebrates were collected during expeditions in the Republic
of Panama. Field studies were made of selected cases, and the rest
of the material was taken to the island for further treatment in prep-
aration for cytological examination later at their University labora-
tory. The skins of the birds obtained by them were donated to the
United States National Museum. The hearts of a number of the
vertebrates were sent to Dr. Struthers, of the University of Syracuse,
for anatomical study of the coronaries and other blood vessels.

Dr. Hartman plans to return for a much more extensive survey,
especially in relation to the effects of the male hormone, particularly
in the sloth. The use of the island as a base for excursions to other
nearby regions emphasizes one of the unique features of the Canal
Zone Biological Area.

Dr. Per F. Scholander and Dr. Vladimir Walters, of the Arctic
Research Laboratory at Point Barrow, Alaska, spent considerable
time on the island studying the metabolic reactions to temperature
in various animals and plants in order to obtain a tropical counterpart
for the work done on Arctic forms in Alaska. A deep-freeze was
used in some of their work, and the analysis of the tropical mammals
and birds in cold gave just the information needed to interpret
properly the findings in the Arctic. The work on the island with
the deep-freeze proved of basic importance for formulating a theory
on the relation between insulation and metabolism.

R. Joseph Kowal, in charge of the laboratory of the Bureau of
Entomology and Plant Quarantine at Gulfport, Miss., returned in
order to reexamine and evaluate the special series of termite-resistance
tests initiated by him 5 years ago, including the very valuable series
of soil poisons. He was assisted by Russell EK. Fontaine, in charge
of the insect- and pest-control work of the United States Army in
the Caribbean area.

Dr. Walter Clark, in charge of the Research Laboratory of Eastman
Kodak, who had come to inaugurate the large air-conditioned labora-
tory in the outskirts of Panama City, accompanied by Dr. Cleve C.
Soper, in charge of Eastman Kodak’s tropical research work here,
spent several weeks on the island in connection with their corrosion
and deterioration studies. Asin past years, Dr. Clark took thousands
128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

of feet of splendid motion pictures of the animal life. The work of
the Eastman Kodak Company on the island, and in Panama City,
is yielding most valuable data on corrosion and deterioration, as
well as a better understanding of the influence of the Tropics on
color film.

EK. P. Killip, head curator of the department of botany, United
States National Museum, spent a short time on the island, collecting
material for the herbarium. He went over most of the laboratory’s
herbarium specimens and later will send such additional sheets as
may be needed to augment or supplement the collection.

Dr. Charles C. Adams, pioneer ecologist of the Americas, was
another visitor who came to the Tropics for first-hand knowledge.
He stressed the value of the island for ecologists, both plant and
animal, in providing an intimate acquaintance with jungle life.

Dr. and Mrs. H. N. Moldenke, of the New York Botanical Garden,
visited the island after their return from the Second Pan American
Botanical Congress held in Tucum4n, Argentina. Dr. Moldenke’s
chief interest was the Verbenaceae, and he very kindly rechecked the
laboratory’s material in this family.

Dr. Marshall Stone, of the University of Chicago, again revisited
the island for a short time.

Phil W. Longenecker, student at Colorado College, spent the month
of July on the island. He made a list of 98 species of birds that he
positively identified, with copious notes on their habits. His
studies also included observations on a number of the mammals.
In his report he states that he did not find it necessary to go far into
the forest, as there was so much to see within a mile of the laboratory.

Dr. Eugene Eisenmann, of New York City, visited the island again
this year to continue his ornithological studies. Dr. Eisenmann is
an authority on the birds of this region. He will prepare a list,
brought up to date, of the birds observed on the island.

Oliver E. Mosser, of Smithtown Branch, N. Y., came for a few
days, specifically to make certain important observations of army
ants for Dr. Schneirla. In addition he studied birds and mammals.

Frank W. Hunnewell and his sister Louise revisited the island and
stayed several weeks, following up his botanical studies. They
showed the same deep interest in the island that they had displayed
ever since Dr. Barbo ir was actively connected with its direction.

lt is a pleasure to record again a short visit by Dr. and Mrs.
Matthew W. Stirling and Richard Stewart, who were in Panama on
archeological reconnaissance on behalf of the National Geographic
Society and the Smithsonian Institution. Motion pictures were
taken by Mr. Stewart to complete the reel covering the island.

Dr. Wetmore, Secretary of the Smithsonian, revisited the island,
SECRETARY’S REPORT 129

at which time conferences were held with the writer on island matters,
plans for the future, improvements that would be desirable. W. M.
Perrygo, of the National Museum, accompanied him as assistant.

John E. Graf, Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
spent 2 weeks on the island in June and July, examining the laboratory
facilities and discussing its operations.

A. C. Langlois, of the Bahamas, whose deep interest in palms and
horticulture in general are well known, was a welcome visitor for a
few days, during which brief time he was able to observe the palms as
they grow in their natural habitat.

W. E. Lundy, secretary-treasurer of The Panama Canal Natural
History Society, a keen student of nature, spent a week on the island,
and as on earlier visits prepared a detailed report of the mammals,
birds, reptiles, and other forms that he saw. These yearly lists from
Mr. Lundy form a very valuable record.

Miss EK. Thomas and Miss Marie Weir, local naturalists of note,
again revisited the island for a few profitable days.

The writer continued his special research problems, particularly
the long-term termite-resistance tests, and fruit-fly populations. The
large Berlese funnel has been kept in operation, and it is of interest
to note the great number of species of mites, pseudoscorpions, and
ants, particularly some of the very rare genera, that have been
collected in this manner.

An interesting development from work done at Barro Colorado
Island that should be mentioned here, since it has not previously
been noted, is the availability of a phonograph record of jungle sounds
by day and by night, familiar and friendly to those who know them,
mysterious and sometimes fearful to the uninitiated. The work is
that of Dr. Arthur A. Allen and Dr. Paul Kellogg of Cornell University
who, during the war, made a long series of recordings in the jungle
for training use with American troops assigned to outpost duty. A
considerable part of the work was done on Barro Colorado Island,
though it is only recently that the material has been released and
prepared in form available to the public. The voices of howler
monkeys, birds, and amphibians, reproduced faithfully by painstaking
techniques, carry fully the ordinary sounds heard during the 24 hours
about the Island.

MORE URGENT NEEDS

One of the most urgent needs is the fireproofing of certain structures
by the use of concrete posts and concrete blocks, which could be
accomplished gradually. These buildings are the Barbour and Chap-
man houses, the kitchen and its adjacent storerooms, and the main
laboratory building.
130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

Even more urgent is a new laboratory and storage building, which
will require a small addition to the clearing back of our present
laboratory site. This structure should be built with concrete posts
and sills, and concrete-block sides, and should have at least six rooms.
Provision should be made for the periodical use of heat in order to
reduce the growth of molds. ‘This building would provide separate
rooms for the library, for scientific records, for storage of cameras
and other delicate apparatus, for the herbarium, for laboratory glass-
ware, and for chemicals. The entire building should be well ventilated,
but in addition glass windows should be provided so that when
necessary these can be tightly closed and heat used. High humidity,
the subsequent rapid growth of fungus, and the need of protection
from termites are problems of the first order in the Tropics.

Other urgent needs are steel storage cabinets, metal bookcases
with closing glass fronts, metal card-index cabinets for the species
index and the library index, and sectional steel letter files.

FISCAL REPORT

During the fiscal year 1949, $12,256.05 1n trust funds was available.
Of this amount $11,118.90 was spent, leaving on hand only $1,137.15
with which to face the new fiscal year. In addition to this, $1,122.30
is still on deposit, representing local collections.

During the year only $1,243.00 was collected as fees from scientists,
as compared to $1,907.75 last year. This decline is very largely due
to the high cost of transportation to the Isthmus, which keeps many
from coming. Despite the higher cost of food and other items, the
laboratory has not increased its per diem charge to scientists. Those
from institutions that sustain table subscriptions still receive a discount
of 25 percent.

The following institutions continued their support to the laboratory
through the payment of table subscriptions:

furnished.

It is most gratifying to record donations from Dr. Eugene Eisen-
mann, Dr. Oliver P. Pearson, Mrs. Dorothy Edgerton, Miss Louise
Hunnewell, Mr. Frank W. Hunnewell, and the Botanical Society of
Washington.

The sum of $5,000 was made available by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion from appropriated funds, and of this amount $4,997.53 was used
for permanent improvements. The Institution also contributed $3,000
from its private funds, in addition to its table fees.

APPENDIX 11
REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the Smithsonian library for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1949:

All the continents and most of the countries of the world were
represented among the 57,671 publications received by the library
during the year. These books, pamphlets, and serials were pre-
dominantly scientific and technical in character and touched all the
special and related fields of interests of the Smithsonian Institution
and its branches. The International Exchange Service transmitted
5,082 of them, and the rest came by mail or by other means of delivery.

Acquisitions by purchase included 1,792 volumes, three collections
of pamphlets on special subjects, and subscriptions for 279 periodicals.

Gifts of 7,287 publications came from many different donors.
The library owes a lasting debt of gratitude to these friends of the
Institution, at home and abroad, for their generous contributions
of books and papers, many of which the library would not otherwise
have been able to acquire. Not yet statistically recorded in the
library is the important gift of the large Ferdinand Perret Research
Library of the Arts and their Affiliated Sciences, presented by Mr.
Perret to the National Collection of Fine Arts.

The library’s principal strength and the backbone of its usefulness
lies in the large collections of publications, chiefly serials, issued by
the research institutions, scientific societies, universities, academies,
museums, and observatories all over the world, which the Smith-
sonian Institution receives in exchange for its own publications.
These are the primary sources of the records of progress in science
and technology, in the arts and industries. Ready access to them is
indispensable to the work of the Institution. The larger number
of the 17,713 periodical entries recorded during the year were these
exchange publications, and many monographic works received in
exchange were separately cataloged. There were 338 new exchanges
arranged, and 7,008 volumes and parts needed to fill gaps in serial
sets, or for special purposes, were obtained in response to 726 special
requests made to the issuing agencies.

132
SECRETARY’S REPORT 133

A grand total of 17,771 publications were sent to the Library of
Congress. Of these, 1,978 volumes and 4,582 periodical parts were
recorded as permanent additions to the great Smithsonian Deposit
there. The others were forcign and domestic dissertations, docu-
ments, and miscellaneous publications of little immediate importance
to the work of the Institution.

The Army Medical Library selected for transfer 859 publications
no longer needed here in the sectional library of the division of
medicine. Also sent to the Army Medical Library were 1,068
currently received medical dissertations and 1,927 other publications
on medical subjects. <A total of 1,532 publications were distributed,
according to subject, among other libraries of the Government.

The cataloging of currently received publications was kept up
without serious time lags and with no additions to the large ‘‘back-
log” of many years standing. Records of 6,884 volumes were added
to catalogs and shelflists, and 31,184 cards were filed. Work on the
correlation of the central periodical entry records with those of the
central catalog was begun, and 389 entries were checked, corrected,
and unified. This is important work which will have far-reaching
results in shortening the time of record keeping and in giving prompter
service to readers.

Funds allotted for binding permitted 1,060 volumes to be prepared
and sent to the Government Printing Office, but again were not
sufficient to keep up with the number of volumes of serial publications
completed during the year, so the “backlog” of binding continued to
grow. <A total of 1,026 books and pamphlets were repaired in the
Museum library, but there is always much more of such work to be
done than one assistant can handle, and here too there is regrettable
arrearage.

Increasingly heavy demands upon reading and reference services
of the library, especially from outside the Institution, were noticed
throughout all the branches. Every year many visiting scientists
and other scholars not only from our own but from other countries of
the world make more or less extensive use of the library’s resources,
while letters and telephone requests for information pour in daily.
Interlibrary loans of 2,619 publications to 89 different libraries were
made, an increase of 732 over last year. The principal borrowers
were other scientific libraries of the Government in Washington, and
research institutions, museums, and universities elsewhere.

Three positions were vacant during the entire year, and the
Museum library had no messenger after the end of January. The
134 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

redistribution of work assignments necessary to meet the emergencies
of the situation could only be made at the expense of neglecting or
postponing all but the most immediately demanding of the library’s
responsibilities. While every effort was made to see that services to
the scientific staff suffered as little as possible, some irritating delays
and inconveniences were unavoidable, most noticeably from the
lack of adequate messenger service.

There was a heartening improvement in one branch of the service,
made possible by the promotion of an acquisitions assistant to fill the
much needed new position of assistant librarian in charge of the
Astrophysical Observatory library. The position from which the
promotion was made, however, is one of those still unfilled.

Even more serious than the vacancy of library positions is the
housing of the library. For many years the shelves have been so
badly overcrowded that the shelving of each year’s acquisitions has
been a matter of makeshift contrivance. ‘To relieve the congestion
double shelving—that is, two rows of books shelved one behind the
other on a single shelf—has become a common practice, especially in
the Natural History building. Whole sections of books in relatively
less frequent use have had to be shifted to inconvenient locations in
the attic stacks of the Arts and Industries building where dust and
dryness are particularly bad. The generally poor arrangements of
the library’s quarters in all the buildings, too, and the lack of any
well-equipped space for a centralized collection of the indispensable
reference books needed in common by all the bureaus of the Institution
are handicaps to the kind of library service that should be expected
in the Smithsonian Institution. Until some practical means can be
found to remedy these and many related bad housing conditions,
progressive deterioration of books and library service alike is
inevitable.

various sources, the income from which may be used for the general
work of the Institution. These, including the original bequest, plus
savings, are listed below, together with the income for the present

FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Early in 1906, by deed of gift, Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, gave to
the Institution his collection of Chinese and other Oriental objects of
art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art by Whistler,
Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also gave funds for the
construction of a building to house the collection, and finally in his
will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock and securities to
the estimated value of $1,958,591.42, as an endowment fund for the
operation of the Gallery.

The above fund of Mr. Freer was almost entirely represented by
20,465 shares of stock in Parke, Davis & Co. As this stock advanced
in value, much of it was sold and the proceeds reinvested so that the
fund now amounts to $6,092,775.69 in a selected list of securities
classified later.

The practice of maintaining savings accounts in several of the
Washington banks and trust companies has been continued during
the past year, and interest on these deposits amounted to $824.74.

In many instances, deposits are made in banks for convenience in
collection of checks, etc., and later such funds are withdrawn and
deposited in the United States Treasury.

Disbursement of funds is made by check signed by the Secretary
of the Institution and drawn on the United States Treasury.

The foregoing report relates only to the private funds of the
Institution.

The Institution gratefully acknowledges gifts from the following:
American Philosophical Society, for Iroquois research.

W. W. Corcoran, for B. F. Starr.

We have examined the accounts of the Smithsonian Institution relative to its
private endowment funds and gifts (but excluding the National Gallery of Art
and other departments, bureaus, or operations administered by the Institution
under Federal appropriations) for the year ended June 30, 1949. Our examina-
tion was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and
SECRETARY'S REPORT 149

accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

The Institution maintains its accounts on a cash basis and does not accrue
income and expenses. Land, buildings, furniture, equipment, works of art,
living and other specimens and certain sundry property are not included in the
accounts of the Institution.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly the
position of the private funds and the cash and investments thereof of the Smith-
sonian Institution at June 30, 1949 (excluding the National Gallery of Art and
other departments, bureaus or operations administered by the Institution under
Federal appropriations) and the cash receipts and disbursements for the year
then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied
on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1949

866591—50——_11
ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the GeneraL Apprnpix to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such papers
as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the Secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to an dincluding the year 1888.

In the report of 1889, a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1949.

THE FORMATION OF STARS!

By Lyman Spirzer, Jr.
Princeton University Observatory

[With 2 plates}

If research in astronomy had stopped in 19138, our knowledge of
stellar evolution today would be in a satisfactory state. At that time
astronomers had a plausible theory of a star’s life cycle. Einstein’s
theory of relativity, advanced only a few years before, showed that
mass and energy were interchangeable. It was therefore natural for
astronomers to assume that stars were formed as large massive bodies
which through successive century after century continued to radiate
away matter. Ultimately most of the matter in a star, according to
this picture, would be radiated away as light and heat. In this way
all the stars, despite their large differences in mass, formed part of
the same evolutionary sequence.

Unfortunately, this simple, sweeping, and satisfying picture became
discredited by additional information, both astronomical and physi-
cal. On the astronomical side, evidence began to accumulate that
the universe has not lasted long enough for most stars to radiate
away much of their matter. The expansion of the universe, the
presence of uranium on the earth, the existence of certain relatively
transitory clusters of stars, all indicate that something happened
about 3 billion years ago. If the universe was not created then, it
was certainly very extensively reorganized; some sort of cosmic ex-
plosion apparently took place at that time. Since the sun, a fairly
typical star, would require many hundreds of billions of years to
radiate an appreciable fraction of its mass, its total mass has ob-
viously not changed appreciably within this last few billion years.

On the physical side, nuclear physicists have learned a great deal
about the specific processes by which matter can be converted into
energy. The only known process of importance which can liberate
energy inside a star is the combination of four hydrogen atoms to
form a helium atom. Calculations carried out by the nuclear phys-
icist, Prof. Hans Bethe, show that in the stars this process occurs
through the catalytic action of carbon and nitrogen nuclei. Since

1 Reprinted by permission from Physics Today, vol. 1, No. 5, September 1948.
153
154 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

four hydrogen atoms weigh 0.7 percent more than one helium atom,
the additional mass is released as energy and can be radiated by the
star. Even if a star is originally all hydrogen, the total mass radiated
can evidently not exceed a very small fraction of the mass of the star.

As a result of these findings we now know that the universe has
apparently not lasted long enough in its present form for stars to
radiate much of their mass, and in any case there seems to be no
physical process by which a star could radiate away most of its mat-
ter even if there were time enough. We are forced to conclude that
the present variety of stars in the sky is the result of the original
method of star formation rather than of any evolutionary process.
And the formation of stars in general is still a closed book, since the
explosion of the universe a few billion years ago has so far defied
any attempts at detailed analysis. It is even possible that the basic
laws of nature may have been quite different at that time. Thus
our research in the direction of general stellar evolution reminds one
of Browning’s philosopher, who had

. written three books on the soul,

Proving absurd all written hitherto
And putting us to ignorance again.

SUPERGIANT STARS

While the origin of the universe is still beyond our understanding,
some progress has been made in explaining the origin of a certain class
of stars, which may have been created relatively recently. A super-
giant star is one which radiates light and heat some ten thousand
times as strongly as our own sun. There are not many of these stars,
but in a galaxy of many billions of lesser stars they stand out in the
same way that a searchlight stands out from a swarm of fireflies.
These stars are burning their candle at both ends and they cannot
last very long, astronomically speaking. Within a mere hundred
million years, such a star must burn all its hydrogen into helium.
There is no known way in which a star can remain dark for a long
period of time and then suddenly start shining. We conclude that
these supergiant stars have formed within the last hundred million
years—less than a tenth of the age of the universe.

Of course, it is possible that nuclear physicists have overlooked
some important process by which a star can radiate a much larger
fraction of its mass than the hydrogen-into-helium process liberates.
This does not seem very likely, since the energies with which the atoms
hit each otherinsidea star average only a few thousand electron volts—
a small fraction of the energies developed in such atom-busting devices
as the cyclotron and synchrotron—and since the nuclear reactions
produced at low energies have been fairly well explored in the lab-
oratory.
FORMATION OF STARS—SPITZER 155

If it is assumed that these stars have in fact been formed within
the last hundred million years, the mechanism for this formation is a
problem which astronomers may hope to investigate with some hope
of success. Within this interval, conditions in the universe have
apparently not changed very much and an examination of the universe
about us may actually indicate how supergiant stars have formed in
the past, and may even be forming at the present time.

CLOUDS—THE CLUE

The clouds of matter which float about between the stars are an
obvious source of material for star formation. Recent investigations
show that these clouds are in fact so closely associated with supergiant
stars that a physical connection between them seems very likely.

In brief, the observations indicate that supergiant stars are found
only in those aggregations of stars where interstellar clouds of matter
are also present. More specifically, observations of stellar galaxies,
each one a million or so light-years away and each, like our own
galaxy, containing many billions of stars, show that supergiant stars
are found only in spiral galaxies. These spiral systems, like the
huge galaxy in which our sun is located, are flattened, disk-shaped
systems some hundred thousand light-years in diameter, each one
rotating about an axis perpendicular to the plane of its disk. A
typical spiral galaxy is shown in plate 1, figure 2. The characteristic
feature of these systems, after which they are named, is the presence
of a pair of arms which apparently come out of the central nucleus and
wind around the system.

In the elliptical galaxies—which are not rotating so rapidly, are
not so flattened, and show no spiral structure—no supergiant stars
are found. In fact, long-exposure plates at the Mount Wilson Ob-
servatory have shown that the stars in these systems have a sharp
upper limit on their brightness; no star greater than the critical bright-
ness can be found, while below this critical brightness myriads of
stars appear on the photographic plate. This result is in marked
contrast to the observed brightness of the stars in spiral galaxies,
where there are always one or two brightest supergiant stars, a number
of less bright supergiants, and a gradually increasing number of
fainter and fainter stars. This sharp upper limit on the brightness
of stars in elliptical galaxies is just what one would expect if no new
stars had been formed since the beginning of the universe, and if
the brightest ones had burned up all their fuel and gone out.

Detailed examination of galaxies also indicates that clouds of matter
between the stars are found only in spiral systems. In elliptical
galaxies the vast stretches between the stars are very nearly empty,
but in flattened spiral galaxies like our own there is about as much
156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

matter between the stars as there is inside the stars. This association
between obscuring clouds and supergiant stars is strengthened by the
fact that in the closest galaxy, the great nebula in Andromeda, super-
giant stars are observed to occur in exactly those regions where the
obscuring clouds are most prominent. Thus the observational evi-
dence indicating a physical connection between clouds and super-
giant stars is very strong.

Before we can accept the hypothesis that supergiant stars have in
fact formed from these clouds we must investigate whether or not
there is some process which could cause interstellar matter to condense
into stars. In this way we are led to consider the physical nature of
the stuff between the stars, and the forces which operate onit. Thirty-
five years ago the very existence of interstellar matter was not fully
realized but recently extensive information on this topic has been

obtained.
ATOMS IN SPACE

The dominant constituents of interstellar matter are believed to be
individual atoms. These atoms absorb or emit light of particular
wave lengths, which can be measured accurately by use of the spectro-
scope. In some regions, where the gas is at a high temperature,
bright emission lines of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are observed.
Measurements of the intensities of these lines show that the density
of the interstellar gas is about one hydrogen atom in each cubic
centimeter, with other elements present as slight impurities. The
interstellar medium is a much better vacuum than is ever obtained in
a terrestrial laboratory. If a fly were to breathe a single breath
into a vacuum chamber as big as the Empire State Building, the re-
sulting density of the air would still be much greater than the density
of the interstellar gas.

In other regions of space the interstellar gas is cool, and no emission
lines are produced. Instead, the atoms absorb the light from distant
stars, producing absorption lines at particular wave lengths. The
absorption lines of the abundant gases, hydrogen, helium, nitrogen,
oxygen, etc., when these are cool, lie far out in the ultraviolet, where
they cannot be detected. Interstellar absorption lines of sodium,
calcium, titanium, and iron lie within the observable spectrum and
have been observed in the spectra of bright stars a few thousand
light-years away. These lines are very sharp, and can usually be
distinguished from the lines produced by the atoms in a stellar at-
mosphere, where the high temperature and pressure give wide lines.

Recent work has been concerned with the detailed distribution of
interstellar gas. Measurement of the strongest absorption lines, with
the most powerful spectrographs available at the 100-inch telescope of
FORMATION OF STARS—SPITZER 157

the Mount Wilson Observatory, shows that a single line is frequently
made up of several components. Each separate component is pro-
duced by absorption in a single cloud of gas, the different components
being separated in wave length by the difference in Doppler effect
produced by the different cloud velocities. These clouds, each one
about 20 light-years across, are moving through space at speeds of
some 10 or 20 miles a second. A more detailed understanding of the
nature of these clouds is desirable before one can discuss in detail how
interstellar matter can form new stars. Further work along these
lines is now in progress.

SOLID PARTICLES

In addition to the separate atoms drifting about in space, small
solid particles, or grains, are also present. Each grain is about one
hundred-thousandth of an inch in diameter; 10,000 placed end to
end would make a line about as long as a period on this page. Since
the size of these grains is just about equal to the wave length of visible
light, these particles are of the size which is most effective in absorbing
and scattering light waves. These particles are responsible for the
general obscuration produced by the clouds shown in plate 2. Par-
ticles of smaller size are presumably also present, but these do not
produce such a noticeable effect, and can therefore not be detected.

The properties of these particles have been determined from accu-
rate measurements of the obscuration which they produce in light of
different wave lengths. This obscuration is greater for blue light
than for red light, which proves that the particles cannot be much
larger in size than the wave length of light. On the other hand, the
obscuration varies inversely only as the first power of the wave length,
instead of as the fourth power which is observed for scattering by the
molecules of the atmosphere. From this one can conclude that the
grains are not very much smaller in size than the wave length of light.
In this way a particle size of about the wave length of light has been
determined. From the fact that the grains seem to scatter more
than they absorb it seems likely that they are dielectric rather than
metallic in composition. If, as seems likely, these grains were pro-
duced by the sticking together of individual atoms, the enormous
abundance of hydrogen relative to other elements would be expected
to produce solid hydrogen compounds, in particular, ordinary ice.
However, impurities of all other elements would also be present.

Studies of the distribution of these grains have indicated that the
clouds in which these grains are concentrated are apparently identical
with the gaseous clouds already described. Thus whatever pushes
atoms into clouds also pushes the grains together.

FORCES IN INTERSTELLAR SPACE

To discuss in detail how stuff in space can condense to form new
stars we must determine the physical conditions of matter in space.
In particular, we must combine the observational evidence described
above with our knowledge of basic physical principles to investigate
the different forces that are at work on the different particles. Only
in this way can we predict how the interstellar medium will behave
under various widely different conditions.

In the immense vacuum between the stars, an interstellar particle
spends most of its time moving in a straight line without interruption.
Occasionally, one of two things may happen to it: an encounter with
another interstellar particle, or an encounter with a light wave, or
photon. The information which physicists have obtained on such
processes is not so complete as astronomers would like, but is sufficient
for an approximate evaluation of the effects which these various col-
lisions will produce.

The collisions of the interstellar atoms and grains with each other
help determine the temperature of matter in space. In most cases,
the collisions are elastic and the kinetic energy of the different par-
ticles is exchanged back and forth; as a result, the distribution of
velocities corresponds to that in thermal equilibrium at some particular
temperature. Photoemission of energetic electrons from hydrogen
atoms and grains, on absorption of photons, tends to keep the tem-
perature high, but inelastic collisions between atoms and grains tend
to give a low temperature. Near a very hot and very bright star the
gas will be heated up to about 10,000° K., but in other regions a tem-
perature of about 100° K. seems likely. This difference of tempera-
ture between different regions is believed to produce cosmic currents,
or winds, in the same way as the winds on earth are produced.

In some cases the interstellar particles stick to each other on col-
lision. ‘Thus atoms stick together to form molecules, molecules stick
together to form larger molecules, and grains grow by slow accretion.
This process was analyzed during the war by a number of Dutch as-
tronomers, who were able to show that the interstellar grains have
probably been formed by this evolutionary process within the last
few billion years. More accurate physical information on collisions
between particles at low energies is required to make this theory
more quantitative.

Collisions between grains and photons are important in star build-
ing. It is well known that light exerts pressure. Since starlight ina
galaxy comes from all directions in the galactic plane, a single grain
will be knocked this way or that by photon collisions, without any net
motion resulting. However, when several grains are present, the
shadow of each ove on the other unbalances the radiative force, and
FORMATION OF STARS—SPITZER 159

photons striking from the opposite sides push the grains toward each
other. As a result, there is an effective force of attraction between
grains which is several thousand times as great as the gravitational
force between them.

STAR FORMATION

The farther we go away from observational data the more uncertain
our theories become. The mechanism of star formation, which is the
ultimate objective of much of the work described above, is still in a
rather speculative state. However, putting all the above information
together does provide a reasonable preliminary picture for the process
by which stars can be formed from interstellar matter.

The process may be assumed to start with an interstellar gas,
formed at the same time as the rest of the universe. The first step
in the process is then the slow condensation of interstellar particles
from the gas. After these particles have reached a certain size, the
radiative attraction between them forces them together and they drift
toward each other, forming an obscuring cloud in a time of about 10
million years. In a cloud, where the density of grains is high, the
temperature tends to be low. In the surrounding region the high
temperature produces high pressure, and the low-temperature, low-
pressure cloud therefore becomes compressed. In this way the density
of gas within a cloud will be increased, corresponding to the observed
result that a cloud of grains is also a cloud of gas.

Currents produced by differences of temperature and also by the
general rotation of the galaxy will tend to tear some of these clouds to
pieces. On the other hand, the forces of condensation will pull them
together and some clouds may be expected to go on contracting. The
radiative force becomes ineffective when the clouds become so opaque
that light does not penetrate into them very far. At this point
gravitation takes over and tends to produce a further contraction.
In this stage a cloud has a diameter of a light-year or less. Small
opaque clouds of this type, called globules, have been known for some
time, and are shown in plate 1, figure 1.

One of the chief problems concerns the angular momentum of this
prestellar globule, or protostar. According to Newton’s laws of
motion, the angular momentum, which is proportional to the product
of the radius and the rotational velocity, remains constant; as the
radius decreases the rotational speed increases. Since the radius of a
typical cloud is some 10 million times the radius of a supergiant star,
this increase in rotational speed can be quite impressive. Unless
some way can be found to dispose of the angular momentum, a proto-
star would hurl itself to pieces by centrifugal force. The possibility
that turbulent motions in the gas may carry the angular momentum
160 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

away has been explored by several German astronomers. However,
the turbulent velocities involved would exceed the velocity of sound
in the interstellar gas, and physical information about this type of
turbulence is virtually nonexistent. In this country the possibility
has been advanced that a galactic magnetic field might produce
electrical eddy currents in a rotating protostar, which would then
damp out the angular momentum.

An interesting variant of this star-building picture has been pro-
posed by Dr. Fred Whipple, one of the astronomers who has con-
tributed most to this theory of star building. He suggests that a
condensing cloud may have produced our solar system. In view of
the widespread general interest in the formation of the solar system,
such a bold extrapolation of these theoretical concepts back to con-
ditions several billion years ago is naturally of much significance.

It is evident that the picture of star formation which has been
described here is still in a formative stage. The work in progress is
being carried out cooperatively by a number of astronomers all over
the world. Perhaps when the 200-inch telescope probes further into
the secrets of space, and when further progress in experimental and
theoretical physics increases our understanding of the processes at
work between the stars, we may then outline with more assurance the
detailed steps by which supergiant stars may be forming almost
before our very eyes.

THE ORIGIN OF THE EARTH!

By Tuornton Pace
Yerkes Observatory

[With 11 plates]

With all the spectacular success of recent scientific research, it is
perhaps refreshing to examine a field so characterized by failure as this
one. Although many speculations have been described as ‘‘theories,”’
there exists today no real theory of the origin of the earth in the sense
of a complete logical structure linking together the vast quantity of
pertinent observations collected during the last century.

The most obvious approach to the problem is to study the visible
surface of the earth for clues to its origin. This has been done in
detail by geologists, geodesists, geophysicists, and geochemists, but it
is perhaps not surprising that what they find has more to do with the
earth than with its origin. It has been the astronomer, studying the
relation of the earth to its surroundings, and the physicist, studying
the behavior of matter, who have made the greatest progress in the
study of the earth’s origin.

Early speculation on the subject was simple and direct because there
were fewer observations to explain. The assumption of a divine crea-
tion of things as they are was generally accepted until the end of the
sixteenth century. Then the revolution in scientific thinking, started
by Galileo, turned men from assumptions of a catastrophic origin to a
belief in natural development, understandable in terms of what can
be seen and measured today. As the astronomical picture became
clearer, it appeared that the earth is a relatively small, nearly spherical
body moving around the sun together with the other planets, all under
the influence of the sun’s gravitational attraction. It was soon
recognized as scarcely due to chance that all the known planets and
their satellites are moving and rotating in the same direction, their
orbits nearly circular, and in nearly the same plane. Therefore, in
1755, the great German philosopher-scientist, Immanuel Kant, specu-
lated that the planets and the sun were formed from a single large
rotating gaseous cloud, or nebula, which had condensed into smaller
rotating parts, these further condensing into rotating planets with

161
162 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

their satellites, all moving in the same direction round the nucleus of
the nebula which became the sun. Kant’s hypothesis explained nearly
all of the available observational data within the framework of physics
as it was developed at the time.

Later on, about 1800, the French mathematician, Laplace, inde-
pendently proposed a modified form of the Kant hypothesis which,
even though it was not given much weight by its author, soon became
widely accepted as the concept upon which much of geology was
founded. Laplace went further than Kant in explaining how the
primordial nebula condensed into planets. He assumed that in the
beginning the nebula was hot and spinning slowly, that the gas con-
tracted as it cooled and therefore increased its spin in accordance with
the law of conservation of angularmomentum. As the spin increased,
he reasoned, rings of gas would be thrown off by centrifugal action and
each ring would condense into a planet. It is now recognized that no
such condensation of hot gas at the rim of a spinning nebula would take
place, but Laplace’s speculation was important in that he introduced
two new factors: the idea that the earth condensed from hot gases, and
the consideration of angular momentum in the solar system.

Not until 1895 was the Laplace hypothesis seriously challenged.
By that date geology had come into its own as a science, and T.C.
Chamberlin, an American geologist, considered the geological evi-
dence incompatible with the concept of a hot gaseous sphere cooling to
become the present earth. Instead, he proposed the planetesimal
hypothesis, in which the earth and other planets were built by accretion
of cold particles (the planetesimals) which were moving around the
sun under its gravitational attraction. Together with an astronomer,
F. R. Moulton, he suggested that such planetesimals might have
resulted from a near-collision between another star and oursun. The
planetesimal hypothesis introduced two new concepts: that the earth
was built by accretion of cold solid material, and that another star
was involved in forming the solar system. The near-collision pre-
sumably being a rare event, this represented a return, in part, to the
old concept of a catastrophic origin.

During the last 50 years, most of the thinking on this problem has
been divided between the two widely divergent hypotheses of Laplace
and Chamberlin. Did the earth start hotter or colder than at present?
Has it condensed and contracted, or grown by accretion? Was its
origin a commonplace occurrence in a nebula (many of which can be
seen in the sky), or due to a highly unusual near-collision between
stars? Whatever drawbacks these incomplete speculations may have
had, they have provided definite concepts on the basis of which further
research has been and yet remains to be done.
ORIGIN OF THE EARTH—PAGE 163

THE RECORD IN THE ROCKS

In geology it is assumed that we can explain past developments on
the basis of processes taking place today, and this assumption has been
remarkably successful in tracing geological history to form a consistent
pattern. The surface features of the earth can be explained as the
expected result of erosion, of glacier action, of volcanism, and of move-
ments of the crust itself, all of which are observed in action now. This
reasoning might be expected to lead, step by step, to the origin of the
earth.

The sequence of events in earth history is best summarized by the
geologic column, a schematic pue of all the rock strata which have been
classified, in the order of their formation. After fitting together rocks
from all over the world, there are left only four major gaps in the
record, when erosion in practically all parts of the earth now above
sea level must have eliminated the rock deposits of millions of years.
With these four exceptions, the geologic column, fitted together from
the results of a century of world-wide geologic prospecting, gives al-
most as complete and consistent a picture of earth history as if the
entries had been mede in a diary. It lacks only the number of years
intervening between the various geologic eras.

The dates were supplied when the absolute ages of rocks were esti-
mated from their radioactivity, first in 1905 by Boltwood, an American
physicist. He measured the relative amounts of lead and helium in
uranium deposits. The uranium ore crystallized when the molten
magma solidified, and the radioactive uranium has since been dis-
integrating at a constant but very slow rate to form lead and helium
which, in favorable cases, have both remained sealed in the igneous
rock with the uranium. The process of radioactive decay has been
thoroughly studied in the laboratory by many physicists, including the
Curies and Rutherford (who suggested Boltwood’s research), and the
rate of disintegration accurately measured.

Dating various igneous rocks in the geologic column showed first
how very long was the record; the oldest igneous rocks yet dated
crystallized about 3 billion years ago. Moreover, there are even older
sedimentary rocks through which the molten magma had pushed to
form these oldest known igneous rocks; hence the earth must have had
surface conditions about 3 billion years ago not radically different
from those today. ‘There must have been water and an atmosphere
operating to erode rocks and form sand and mud beds. Fossils in
somewhat younger rocks indicate that early forms of life existed at
least 1 billion years ago when conditions must have been very like
» those today.
164 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

But the geologic column fails to yield the one feature which might
provide conclusive evidence on the earth’s origin. No rocks yet
examined have the appearance of an original crust; they are all either
old sediments or solidified magma which pushed up through sediments.

TEMPERATURE AS A CLUE

Trying another tack, we might expect that the earth’s thermal
history could be traced back to determine its temperature at birth.
In deep mines and wells the temperature increases 1° C. for each 125
feet below the surface. Knowing how rocks conduct heat, we find
that 10 million million calories of heat are flowing out from the earth’s
interior each second. If the earth were solid granite, all 7,000 billion

billion tons of it, this escaping heat, would cool it about 1° C. in 3
million years. From this measured rate of cooling is it possible to
determine whether the earth was originally molten?

One must be careful in such estimates; not all of this heat comes
from cooling the earth, since the radioactive disintegration so useful
in determining the age of rocks is also releasing energy. In fact if
the measured radioactivity is constant with depth, the outer crust of
the earth only 12 miles thick would provide all the 10 million million
calories leaving the earth’s interior. If the radioactive material goes
deeper than 12 miles, the earth must, willy-nilly, be heating up!
So the heat now leaving the earth does not give a clue to its original
temperature, although it does point to another approach. Since it is
improbable that the earth is heating up rapidly, the radioactive
material probably is not distributed uniformly throughout the earth
but is concentrated in surface layers.
ORIGIN OF THE EARTH—PAGE 165

Such a stratification within the earth might have a bearing on the
original conditions. For instance, if the earth were once molten, we
might expect heavier materials to sink to the center and lighter ones
to come to the surface. A variety of measurements do prove that
the earth is much more dense at the core than at the surface, and this
central condensation was long used to support the concept of an
originally molten globe. In fact, the central core itself was generally
believed still to be molten. But a few years ago, observations of
faint earthquake waves which could only have passed through the
core if it were solid, disputed the point.

It is now generally accepted that the earth’s interior is stratified in
three distinct layers on a central core which is four times as dense as
the surface rocks, and although probably as solid throughout as
surface rocks, it yields to plastic flow over long intervals of time.
(The molten lava of volcanoes is only in local pools liquefied by a
temporary release of pressure.) Recent work by geochemists shows
that at least some of the stratification is due to chemical compaction,
the tremendous pressures favoring the formation of heavier chemical
compounds in the interior. There is no satisfactory explanation of
the dense core, which must be a material radically different from
surface rock. But its existence can no longer be used with certainty
to argue that the earth was once molten.

CHEMICAL CLUES

Geochemical studies give a somewhat better clue to the earth’s
temperature at birth. Harrison Brown at Chicago has recently shown
that all the elements which exist mainly in gaseous form—hydrogen,
helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon—occur in the earth, its seas and
atmosphere, to a very much smaller extent than expected from studies
of the abundances of elements, both from theory and from observations
of the sun and stars.

The low abundance of hydrogen and helium is easy to understand:
at temperatures of 500 to 600 degrees Centigrade they would escape
from the gravitational attraction of the earth in a few hundred million
years because of the high velocities and small masses of their molecules.
But the heavier atoms, krypton and xenon, could have escaped in
quantity only if the material of the earth were at one time in much
smaller pieces, with correspondingly smaller gravitational attraction,
or if the earth had for some time a temperature of 10,000 to 30,000° C.
Now this is hotter than most stars, and quite impossible for the earth
to maintain, so we deduce that early in its history the material of the
earth was in separate, small pieces. Since oxygen, nitrogen, and
water-vapor molecules are all lighter than krypton (and would there-
fore escape if krypton did), it appears that the earth’s atmosphere and
166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

oceans must have been formed from the decomposition of heavier
compounds after the earth achieved its present size.

To summarize the best geological evidence: the earth is at least 3
billion years old and its surface conditions of temperature and atmos-
phere have not changed materially in 1 billion years and not radically
in 3 billion years. Its stratified layers from density about 3 at the
surface to density about 13 at the center could result from plastic
flow and chemical compaction whether or not the earth were originally
molten. Finally, the earth lost most of its gases early in life, probably
because it was at one time in pieces of too small mass to hold on to
light gas molecules.

SHOOTING STARS

An important bridge between geology and astronomy is provided
by the meteors. Millions of these small chunks of rock and iron
collide with the earth each day, most of them burning up high in the
atmosphere. Some of the larger, slower-moving ones reach the
ground; there the few collected are the only material from outside the
earth available for detailed study. Are they a few remaining planetes-
imals—or are they visitors from outside the solar system?

Measures of meteor speeds by Whipple at Harvard have established
that they are at least members of the solar system. If they came from
outside they would be moving much faster than observed. Radio-
activity measurements (as in dating rocks, but corrected for the effects
of cosmic rays which form extra helium) show that the meteors are
between 2 and 3 billion years old, in startling agreement with the
earth’s age. Their high iron and nickel content has supported the
assumption that the earth’s core is nickel-iron (so that earth and
meteors would have the same over-all composition).

Furthermore, Harrison Brown’s recent studies of the chemical
compounds present in meterorites show that they were probably at
one time under the high pressures and temperatures of a planet’s
interior. It would seem that, far from being planetesimals, the
meteors are the remains of a fair-sized planet which was formed at
the same time as the earth, and which broke up in some large-scale
interplanetary collision at a later date.

THE GAMUT OF SPECULATION

The astronomer, in his approach to the problem of the earth’s
origin, started by recognizing a certain order and regularity among
the planets, their satellites, and the smaller asteroids, all moving about
the sun. The emphasis is shifted from the origin of the earth, as one
of the planets, to the origin of the solar system as a whole. The latest
trend goes even further in linking the origin of the solar system with

the early history or origin of our galaxy
of stars and even of the whole universe.

The solar system regularities noted by
Kant clearly indicate that the planets
had a common origin; ever since Kant’s
time it has been the fond hope of cos-
mogonists to establish the exact nature
of that origin from further studies of the
over-all pattern of the solarsystem. The
first clue of this sort to be noted was
the spacing of the planets; they are not
at irregular distances from the sun, but
spaced approximately in geometric pro-
gression—that is, the distances can be
calculated roughly from a formula called
Bode’s law after its discoverer. Since
the planets continue to move in the same
orbits year after year, this spacing must
have been established during their for-
mation.

A second possible clue to the origin lies
in the progression of planet sizes—from
the smallest, Mercury, which is nearest
the sun, increasing through Venus, Earth,
and Mars to Jupiter, the largest, then
decreasing through Saturn, Uranus, and
Neptune to Pluto, a small planet, and
most distant from the sun.

Further clues will be noted as we fol-
low, now, the twentieth-century history
of speculation on the birth of the solar
system, from Chamberlin to Weizsicker
and Whipple. Each of these theore-
ticians has started either from the Kant
nebular hypothesis, or from the Chamber-
lin two-star hypothesis, and tried to
show by more or less exact reasoning that
the presently observed solar system
would have resulted naturally. Cham-
berlin and Moulton in 1900 guessed that
the close approach of another star to our
sun would raise great eruptions on the
sun, that hot solar material would con-

dense into small planetesimals moving around the sun and that
these planetesimals would later stick together to form the planets
by accretion.

In 1917 the English astronomers Jeans and Jeffreys made more
exact calculations and concluded that the eruptions would not have
taken place; rather, the intruding star would have to sidewipe the
sun, peeling off a long filament of solar material which would then
condense into the planets. They pointed out that this filament would
be thicker in the middle than at the ends, thereby accounting for the
progression of planetary sizes.

The Jeans-Jeffreys hypothesis seemed satisfactory until 1930, when
Nolke in Germany and Russell at Princeton pointed out another clue:
the angular momentum of the planets. Just as a spinning top would
keep on spinning forever if there were no friction, so the planets must
have maintained constant angular momentum in their orbits around
the sun, since nothing analogous to friction is known in the solar
system. If the planets were formed from material pulled out of the
sun, this law of conservation of angular momentum requires that the
original planetary material must have started moving around the
sun with the same angular momentum the planets have today.
Russell showed mathematically that a grazing collision with another
star could not start the filament of planetary material off with any-
where near enough angular momentum.

In an effort to patch things up, one of Russell’s students, Lyttleton,
analyzed mathematically the case of a collision between three stars,
and found that it was just possible to produce a filament of material
moving with sufficient angular momentum about one of them. An
English astronomer, Hoyle, showed it was also possible if one of two
close stars blew up, as a somewhat asymmetrical nova, propelling
itself away and leaving some planetary material moving around the
other star.

But these mathematical exercises and the whole sequence of specula-
tions based on the two-star hypothesis were brought sharply to a close
in 1939 when Spitzer, another of Russell’s students, calculated that
the material pulled out of the sun, or any other star, could not con-
dense into planets or planetesimals anyway—it would expand with
explosive violence to form a tenuous gaseous nebula!

BACK TO THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS

Long before Spitzer had showed that the two-star hypothesis would
lead to a nebula, other scientists had been working away on the
nebular hypothesis, trying to find some means by which material
near the sun would form a group of planets all moving in the same
direction in nearly circular orbits and in nearly the same plane. In
ORIGIN OF THE EARTH—PAGE 169

1914:a Norwegian physicist, Birkeland, calculated that electrically
charged particles shot out of the sun would spiral out in the sun’s
magnetic field to definite circular orbits at distances depending on
the ratio between the electric charge and the mass of the particles.
This promising lead was followed further in 1930 by a Dutch mete-
orologist, Berlage, who assumed the particles were charged atoms.
More recently, in 1942, the Swedish physicist, Alfvén, was able to
predict by similar reasoning that rings of gas with sufficient angular
momentum would be formed around the sun as the sun moved through
a nebula, but both he and Berlage have avoided the embarrassing
problem of how this gas could condense to form planets.

Lastly in the sequence of nebular speculations, a German physicist,
Weizsicker, has recently investigated in detail the motion of a large
cloud of dust and gas in rotation about a massive central body like
the sun. From this return to the ungarnished Kant hypothesis he
was able to show that, while most of the gas would escape into outer
space, the planets could be formed by the accretion of the dust par-
ticles over a period of a hundred million years—a short time compared
to the age of the earth. The spacing of the planetary orbits Weiz-
siicker explains in this manner: The inner parts of the rotating nebula
would be pulled around more rapidly by the sun’s gravitational
attraction than the outer parts. Like stirring a bowl of soup near
the center, this would set up eddies, and at the boundaries of the
eddies the dust would coagulate most rapidly. These boundaries,
Weizsicker calculated, would be spaced approximately in a geometric
progression from the sun just as the planets are observed to be.

The Weizsicker hypothesis accounts for more of the observational
data than any of the previous speculations, but because it is so recent
a number of its consequences have not been explored and some of
the estimates may need revision.

One of the interesting consequences is that the formation of planets
should be an extremely common occurrence. Possibly in the process
of formation of every star the conditions would be correct to form
planets. Thus we might expect billions, if not hundreds of billions
of planets in our galaxy, the strong likelihood that life has developed
on a million or more of these, the high probability that there are other
civilizations of mankind, and even the possibility that men on other
planets are writing articles on the origins of their solar systems!

THE ORIGIN OF STARS

But where did the original gas and dust come from? How was it
started in rotation? One reason the Weizsiicker hypothesis has
received so much attention is that a separate line of research on the
origin of the stars has provided answers to these questions. The
argument hinges on the energy necessary to keep the stars shining.
170 § ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1949

The closest star—our sun—is radiating energy at such a stupendous
rate that no ordinary energy generator could keep it going for the 3
billion years we know it has been shining on the earth. However, it
is now known that atomic energy provides the sun’s light and heat
by a process in which four atoms of hydrogen are converted into one
atom of helium and the excess mass changed into radiant energy. The
details of this process, which can only proceed at the high temperature
and pressure of a star’ s interior, were established by Hans Bethe at
