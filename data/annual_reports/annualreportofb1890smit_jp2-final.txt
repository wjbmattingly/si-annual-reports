UPON

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1890,

BY
G. BROWN GOODE,
Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of the National Museum.

A.—GESERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

In January, 1847, the first Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, after many weeks of consultation and deliberation over the
plans for its organization, unanimously voted the following resolution:

Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress, and in accord-
ance with the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that one of
the principal modes of executing the act and the trust, is the accumulation
of collections of specimens and objects of natural history and of elegant art,
and the gradual formation of a library of valuable. works pertaining to all
departments of human knowledge, to the end that a copious store-house of
materials of science, literature, and art may be provided, which shall ex-
cite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall assist the original
investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to the pursuit
of any branch of knowledge.*

This was a high ideal for the future National Museum, but it is one
which it has been year after year more closely approaching, and it is
hoped that the present report will show that the work accomplished
during the fiscal year of 1889-90 has brought us still nearer to its
realization.

After the death of Professor Baird, in 1887, the Museum passed
from under the direction of the mind by which its policy had been
planned for many years. If his biography could be properly written,
it would include a full history of the Museum as well as of the Fish
Commission, and in minor degree of the Smithsonian Institution itself,
for as Secretary and Assistant Secretary he was associated with nearly
every phase of its activity during thirty-seven of its forty-one years of

corporate existence. His relation to it was very similer to that held
by Sir Henry Cole to the great national establishment at South Ken-
sington in England, so well described in the volumes entitled ‘Fifty
Years of Public Work,” and recently published by his son, Mr. Alan
Cole.

Upon the firm foundation which he laid, his successors are endeay-
oring to build a superstructure, harmonious in plan, but, it may be,
different in proportions and even in material. Their policy is not to
work as he did, under circumstances different from those which now
exist, but to work as he would have done under these changed circum-
stances.

EARLY HISTORY OF THE MUSEUM.

The idea of a national museum in the city of Washington was first
suggested by the Hon. Joel Roberts Poinsett, of South Carolina, See-
retary of War under President Van Buren, who in 1840 organized, for
the purpose of establishing such a museum, a society called “The Na-
tional Institution,” afterwards ‘*The National Institute,” which was
exceedingly prosperous and active for four years. By this Society the
nucleus for a national museum was gathered in the Patent Office build-
ing in Washington, and public opinion was educated to consider the
establishment of such an institution worthy of the attention of the Gov-
ernment of the United States. In 1846, having failed in securing the
public recognition at which it aimed, and the Smithsonian Institution
being by its charter entitled to take possession of the extensive Goy-
ernment collections already assembled in its charge, the society became
torpid, and eventually, in 1861, passed out of existence.

From 1844 to 1858, when the so-called ‘“‘ National Cabinet of Curiosi-
ties” passed into the charge of the Smithsonian Institution, the term
“National Museum” was in disuse. J'rom that time onward, however,
it was used, unofficially, to designate the collections in the Smith-
sonian building.

After the “National Cabinet” was delivered to the Regents, appro-
priations were made by Congress for its maintenance. During the
twenty-three years which followed, the collections were greatly increased
and were made the subjects of numerous important memoirs upon the
natural history and ethnology of America. The public halls, with their
arrangements for the exhibition of a portion of the collection, also re-
ceived a due share of attention, and a certain amount of instruction and
pleasure was afforded to visitors. The appropriations, however, were
meagre, the space limited, and the staff was so inadequate that little
could be done except to keep the collections in good preservation.

The exhibition of 1876 in Philadelpbia was an event of great educa-
tional importance to the people of the United States; and not the least
of its benefits were the lessons it taught as to the possibilities for good
in public museums. The objects which at the close of the Centennial
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5

were given to the United States for its National Museum, were of much
intrinsic value, but were still more important in that they led to the
erection of a large building for the expansion of the Museum itself.
From 1876 to 1881 was a period of quiet preparation for future eftort.
From 1881 to 1890 its growth has been rapid, though the organism is
still in its infancy. These have been years of experiment, but it is
hoped that it is now evident to the people and to Congress that the
Museum has now begun a promising progress toward maturity.

PROGRESS IN THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM.

Among the more important features of the work, up to the present
time, certain definite steps of progress have been taken, among the
most important of which may be mentioned:

(1) An organization of the Museum staff has been effected—efficient
for present purposes and capable of expansion and extension as occa-
sion may require.

(2) Through the agency of this staff, the materials in the Museum,
the accumulations of nearly half a century, have been examined, classi-
fied, and brought under control.

(3) The collections have been fully quadrupled in extent.

(4) A considerable beginning has been made toward the development
of a thoroughly labeled exhibition series, available for the instruction
of the public. :

(5) A thorough study of the organizations and systems of classifica-
tion in other museums throughout the world has been made, the results
of which are beginning to appear in the work of the Museum staff. A
report upon the great museums of the world is in preparation.

(6) Many new methods of installation have been developed by ex-
periments in the Museum, and in the expositions in which the Museum
has participated. These are finding favor, and are being adopted in
many similar establishments at home and abroad, and will certainly add
to the economy and success of our own administration.

(7) Science has been forwarded by the publication of many hundreds
of papers describing the materials in the Museum, while the work of
specialists in the production of these papers has greatly improved the
significance and value of the collections.

NECESSITY FOR A NATIONAL MUSEUM.

That the United States must have a National Museum is so evident
that the proposition needs no argument for its support.

Every considerable nation has a museum or group of museums in its
capital city—centers of scientific and educational activity—the treas-
ure-houses of the nation, filled with memorials of national triumphs in
the fields of science, art, and industrial progress.

They are legitimate objects of national pride, for upon the character
of its museum and libraries, intelligent persons visiting a country very
6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

properly base their judgment as to the nature and degree of the civil-
ization of the people.

It should be borne in mind that here in Washington under the roofs
of the Smithsonian and new Museum buildings are grouped together
coliections which in London, Paris, or any other of the European
capitals are provided for in a group of museums, for accommodating
which a much larger number of equally commodious buildings is found
needful.

POSSIBILITIES OF THE FUTURE.

It is possible, as I have pointed out in previous reports, to show that
Washington may readily be made the seat of one of the greatest
museums in the world. It will perhaps be neither practicable nor
desirable to gather together in Washington collections of ancient medi-
geval art, such as those which adorn the capitals of Europe; but a
representative series of such objects will undoubtedly grow up, which
shall tend to educate the public taste, and to promote, so far as possi-
ble, the study of the elements of art and the history of civilization, as
well as to forward the growth of the arts of design. This having been
accomplished, the attention of the Museum should be directed mainly
toward the exhibition of the geology and natural history of America,
and its naturai resources, to the preservation of memorials of its
aboriginal inhabitants, and’the exposition of the arts and industries of
America.

It is evident that the National Museum of the United States will of
necessity have features peculiar to itself, developed in response to the
peculiar needs of the people of this continent. It should be remem-
bered that the national collections of every principal European nation
are divided into several groups, each under separate administration,
though often within the general control of some central authority. In
France, for instance, most of the museums are under the Ministry of
Public Instruction, and in England, to a less extent, under the Depart-
ment of Science and Art.

In the great European capitals the public collections are scattered
through various parts of the cities, in museums with distinctive names
and independent in their organizations. Much of the work which
should properly be done by such museums is omitted, because no one
of them has seen fit to undertake it; while, on the other hand, much
labor is duplicated, which is perhaps equally unfortunate, collections of
similar scope and purpose being maintained in different parts of the
same city. One of the chief objections to such division of effort is that
much of the value of large collections in any department is lost by
failure to concentrate them where they may be studied and compared
side by side. In Washington the national collections are all, without
exception, concentrated in one group of buildings. The Army Medical
Museum now oceupies a building side by side with those under the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 7

control of the Smithsonian Institution, and this proximity, in connec-
tion with the long-established policy of codperation between the two
organizations, will cause them to be, for all practical purposes, united
-in interest. ‘

POSSIBILITIES OF INCREASE AND IMPROVEMENT.

Although the appropriations from the public treasury for the main-
tenance of a national museum are small, compared with those in sev-
eral European countries, the value of objects given by private individ-
uals is proportionately larger. The actual value of such contributions
for ten years past, has not, it is estimated, fallen short of $20,000 a
year, and in some years has been greater.

Among the more important gifts may be mentioned the George Catlin
Indian gallery, of inestimable value to the American historian and eth-
nologist; the Riley collection of North American insects, the finest in
existence, containing 150,000 specimens, and easily worth $50,000; the
collection bequeathed in 1887 by the late Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia,
containing besides minerals aud other objects, about 20,000 concholog-

ical specimens, and appraised by the State at $10,000; and the collec-
tion of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the transfer of
which from Philadelphia to Washington, a special appropriation was
made by Congress.

Some exceedingly valuable collections in this country and in Europe
have been bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution which have not
yet come into its possession. Within the past ten years itis estimated
that individuals to the number of at least a thousand have made gifts
to the museum to the value of $100 or more.

Nota day passes during which some stranger, pleased with the work
of the Museum, does not voluntarily send in some contribution more
or less important.

The National Museum now contains nearly 3,000,000 specimens, dis-
tributed among the various departments, as is shown in the table on
page 22.

The late Professor Baird was once asked whether the value of the
collections in the National Museum was equal to the amount which had
been expended in its maintenance. He replied, unhesitatingly, that
although it would be by no means a fair criterion of their value, he did
not doubt that by a judicious and careful system of sale the entire sum
could be recovered.

One of the most striking features in the affairs of the Museum is the
manner in which its collections are increasing.

In 1887 the number of specimens was more than ten times as great
as five years before.

In the last fiscal year more than twenty eight thousand new lots or
groups of specimens were entered upon the Museum catalogue.
8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

This increase, as has been shown, is in large degree spontaneous,
only a small amount of money being available for the purchase of new
material.

As might be supposed, a considerable proportion of the objects given
duplicate material already on hand, and although these contributions
can with the utmost advantage be used for distribution to other
museums and schools, they do not increase as much as is desired the
value of the collections for study by specialists, and for general educa-
tional purposes. The need of a larger fund for the purchase of speci-
mens is yearly more manifest. Exceedingly important material is
constantly offered to us at prices very much below what it would cost
to obtain it by collecting, and in many instances, when refused, it is
eagerly taken by the museums and institutions of Kurope.

The most enlightened nations of Europe do not hesitate to spend
money liberally to promote the interests of their national museums.

For the purchase of specimens for the South Kensington Museum
from 1853 to 1887 $1,586,634 was expended; or a yearly average of
‘nearly $47,000.

Toward her other museums England is equally liberal. Exact sta-
tistics are not at hand, but it is quite within bounds to assert that her
average expenditure for the purchase of new objects for museums in

London is not less than $500,000 a year.
~ The museums of England are rich with the accumulaticns of centuries.
The National Museum of the United States is young and has enormous
deficiencies in every department. It needs, more than any museum in
Kurope, the opportunity to increase its resources through purchase.
The total amount expended for the purchase of specimens for the
National Museum since its foundation has not exceeded $20,000, and
never in one year more than $8,500.

More has been expended for the improvement of two museums in
the city of New York in the past four years than has ever been expended
by the general government upon the Museum in Washington.

Within the past year three mortifying instances have occurred of the
inability of the National Museum to buy specimens needed to complete
its collections.

A very valuable coliection of minerals, absolutely essential to the
national collections and for some years on deposit in the National
Museum, was withdrawn by its owner and placed in a school museum
in aneighboring city, because $4,000 could not be had for its purchase—
a sum far below its value. :

A collection of implements and weapons illustrating the history of
the natives of Alaska, gathered by an officer in the U. 8S. Navy, and
almost indispensable for the completion of the national ethnological
collection, was sold to a museum in a neighboring city for $12,000, while
the National Museum had no money to expend for such objects.

One of the most important collections of birds in America, the loss of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 9

which was a natienal misfortune, was taken from the city of Washing-
ton and sold to the British Museum for $10,000, no American institu-
tion having money available for its purchase.

Instances of this kind occur nearly every month in every year.

The National Museum has had the option for several years of the
purchase at cost of $80,000 of a collection of minerals, which once
acquired would enable its mineralogical department to rank among the
first in the world. Congress has never been asked to make an appro-
priation for its purchase, simply because of unwillingness to ask for that
which might not be granted. Minerals, having a money value, can
readily be sold, and are not very often given to the Museum, and the
poverty of its mineralogical collection is by no means creditable to the
nation.

The Museum receives many valuable gifts from Government officials
abroad, especially from those in the consular and diplomatic service,
and in the Navy.

If the actual cost of gathering specimens could be paid, the time and
experience of these men would gladly be given gratuitously. In this
way, by the expenditure of a few thousands each year, extensive and
important additions might be made to the national collections.

THE NECESSITY FOR A NEW MUSEUM BUILDING.

The National Museum is now approaching an important crisis in its
history. Its future will depend upon the action of Congress in grant-
ing it an additional building, for without more room its growth can not
but be in large degree arrested.

The necessity for additional room is constantly increasing, and sev-
eral of the collections, to wit, transporation and engineering, fishes, rep-
tiles, birds’ eggs, mollusks, insects, marine invertebrates, vertebrate
and invertebrate fossils, fossil and recent plants, are in some instances
wholly unprovided for, and in others only in a very inadequate degree.

In the main hall of the Smithsonian building is still exhibited the
collection of birds. A few cases containing birds’ eggs and shells have
recently been arranged along the center of this hall.

Eleven of the departments in the National Museum have no space
assigned to them in the Museum building, solely on account of its
crowded condition. The collection of prehistoric anthropological ob-
jects remains installed on the second floor of the Smithsonian building.
The collections of the remaining ten departments can not be exhibited
or even properly arranged and classified without more room. These
collections are at present stored in the attics and basements of the
Smithsonian and Armory buildings, and are inaccessible for study and
for the other purposes for which they were obtained. The specimens
comprising these collections are not simply objects of natural history,
possessing an abstract interest to the student, but represent the appli-
cation of natural objects to the industries, and, as such, are of great
10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

importance. There are several collections of ores, minerals, building-
stones, and of objects representing various arts and industries, which
are of very great value, since they furnish to the American manufac-
turer and designer information of inestimable importance.

The increase in the national collections during the last eight years may
perhaps be best described by the statement that in 1882 the total num-
ber of specimens recorded in the Museum was about 183,000; while in
1890 the records indicated the possession of nearly 3,000,000 speci-
mens. It is proper to say in this connection that the actual increase
was not so great as shown by the records, since during this period a
large amount of material previously received had been brought under
control and placed on the books of the Museum. It should also be
borne in mind that the present Museum building was planned with
reference to the reception of the material in its custody at the time of
its construction.

In the Armory building there are at the present time several hun-
dreds of boxes containing valuable material which has never been
unpacked, since there is no space available for the display of the speci-
mens. Many of the boxes contain collections which were brought to
the Museum through the medium of special acts of Congress.

Independently of the collections obtained at expositions, a very large
amount of material has been received from foreign Governments, among
which may be mentioned those of Mexico, Central America, several of
the South American states, and Japan, which have made extensive con-
tributions to the zodlogical, geological, ethnological, and technological

collections.
APPRECIATION BY FOREIGN NATIONS.

The new methods of work and of museum arrangement, which have
grown up here, have attracted much attention abroad. Mexico, in

1887, sent the entire collections of the National Natural History Mu-
seums, then just being founded, to Washington, in charge of two of her
principal naturalists, who passed six months at the National Museum
identifying their material and studying the methods of administration.
Costa Rica, forming a national museum, sent its director here for a six
months’ course of study.

Japan has sent the entire national collection of birds to the Museum
- to be studied and reported upon by one of the naturalists of the Museum
staff.

Germany has been supplied with a complete set of plans and illustra-
tions of methods of administration at the request of the Director of the
National Zodlogical Museum.

In 1883, at the Fisheries Exhibition in London, the methods of the
National Museum were strictly adhered to in the arrangement of the
display made by the United States.

In 1888, in his address as president of the Anthropological Society
of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, General
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. igs

Pitt-Rivers said that the American display at the Fishery Exhibition
was the only thing done in the true spirit of modern science in the
whole series of professedly scientific exhibitions held in London within
the past six years.*

-Such expressions of opinion, coupled with the. constant praise with
which European journals speak of the scientific work of our Govern-
ment departments, can not but be gratifying, and it should be a matter
of national pride to merit it.

THE RELATIONS OF THE MUSEUM TO THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

The Smithsonian Institution, though it bears the name of a private
citizen and a foreigner, has been for nearly half a century one of the
principal rallying points of the scientific workers of America. It has
also been intimately connected with very many of the most important
scientific undertakings of the Government.

Many wise and enlightened scholars have given to its service the best
years of their lives, and some of the most eminent scientific men, to
whom our country has given birth, have passed their entire lifetime in
work forits success. Jts publications, six hundred and seventy in num-
ber, which when combined make up over one hundred dignified volumes,
are to be found in every important library in the world,and some of
them, it is safe to say, on the working-table of every scientific investi-
gator in the world who can read English.

Through these books, through the reputation of the men who have
worked for it and through it, and through the good accomplished by its
system of international exchange, by means of which within the past
thirty-eight years more than 1,300,000 packages of books and other sei-
entific and literary materials have been distributed to every region of
the earth, it has acquired a reputation at least as far-reaching as that
of any other institution of learning in the world.

*The words of General Pitt-Rivers in 1888 are simply a repetition of what he said
in 1833, made stronger by the observations of five more years of exhibitions in
Europe.

In 1883 he wrote to the London Times:

Str: In confirmation of the praise you justly bestow on the arrangement of the
United States department in the Fisheries Exbibition I beg to draw attention to the
fact that in the whole exhibition it is the only one which is arranged historically.
In the Chinese, Japanese, Scandinavian, and Dutch courts there are objects which.
the scientific student of the arts of life may pick out and arrange in the proper order
in his own mind; but in that of the United States, following the method adopted in
the National Museum in Washington, there has been attempted something more—to
bring the department into harmony with modern ideas. This gives to the exhibition
an interest which is apart from commerce, and an interest which is beyond the mere
requirements of fish culture, and it may be regarded as one out of many indications
of the way in which the enlightened Government of the United States mark their
appreciation of the demands of science.

I have the honor to be, sir, yours obediently,
; A. PITT-RIVERS.
1 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

It is therefore representative of what is deemed in other lands the
chief glory of this nation, for whatever may be thought in other coun-
tries of American art, of American literature, American institutions
generally, the science of America is accepted without question as equal
to the best.

Tn the scientific journals of Great Britain and other European coun-
tries, the reader finds most appreciative reviews of the scientific pub-
lications of the Smithsonian, the Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology,
the Geological Survey, the Department of Agriculture, and the Fish
Commission, and they are constantly holding up the Government of
the United States, as an example to their own, of what governments
should do for the support of their scientific institutions.

It is surely a legitimate source of pride to Americans that their work
in science should be so thoroughly appreciated by eastern nations, and
it is important that the reputation should be maintained. Nothing can
be more in consonance with the spiritof our Government, nor morein
accord with the injunction of Washington in his “ Farewell Address,”
lately admiringly quoted by Sir Lyon Playfair in his address as presi-
dent of the British Association for the Advancement of Science :

Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the
general diffusion of knowledge.

In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opin-
ton it should be enlightened.

No one has been able to show he Smithson selected the United
States as the seat of his foundation. He had no acquaintances in Amer-
ica, nor dees he appear to have had any books relating to America ex-
cept two. Ihees quotes from one of these [‘ Travels through North
America,” by Isaac Weld, secretary of the Royal Society] a paragraph
concerning Washington, then a small town of 5,000 inhabitants, in
which it is predicted that “the Federal city, as soon as navigation is
perfected, will increase most rapidly, and that at a future day, if the
affairs of the United States go on as rapidly as they have done, it will
become the grand emporium of the West, and rival in magnitude and
splendor the cities of the whole world.”

Inspired by a belief in the future greatness of the new nation, real-
izing that while the needs of England were well met by existing organ-
izations such as would not be likely to spring up for many years in a
new, poor, aud growing country, he founded in the new England an in-
stitution of learning, the civilizing power of which has been of incaleu-
lable value. Who can attempt to say what the condition of the United
States would have been to-day without this bequest ?

In the words of John Quincey Adams:

Of all the foundations of establishments for pious or charitable uses
which ever signalized the spirit of the age or the comprehensive bene ficence
of the founder, none can be named more deserving the approbation of man-
kind.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13

The most important service by far which the Smithsonian Institu-
tion has rendered to the nation has been that from year to year, since
1846— intangible but none the less appreciable—by its constant codp-
eration with the Government, public institutions and individuals in
every enterprise, scientific or educational, which needed its advice,
support or aid from its resources.

There have been, however, material results of its activities, the ex-
tent of which can not fail to impress anyone who will look at them;
the most important of these are the Library and the Musewm, which
have grown up under its fostering care.

The library has been accumulated without aid from the treasury of
the United States ; it has, in fact, been the result of an extensive sys-
tem of exchanges, the publications of the Institution having been
used to obtain similar publications from institutions of learning in all
parts of the world.

In return for its own publications the Institution has received the
books which form its library.

This library, consisting of more than a quarter of « million volumes
and parts of volumes, has for over twenty years been deposited at the
Capitol as a portion of the Congressional Library, and is constantly
being increased. In the last fiscal year more than twenty thousand
titles were thus added to the national collection of books.

Chiefly through its exchange system the Smithsonian Institution had,
in 1865, accumulated about forty thousand volumes, largely publications
of learned societies, containing the record of the actual progress of the
world in all that pertains to the mental and physical development of
the human family, and affording tiie means of tracing the history of at
least every branch of positive science since the days of revival of let-
ters until the present time.

These books, in many instances presents from old European libra-
ries, and not to be obtained by purchase, formed even then one of the
best collections of the kind in the world.

The danger incurred from the fire of that year, and the fact that the
greater portion of these volumes, being unbound and crowded into
insufficient space, could not be readily consulted, while the expense to
be incurred for binding, increase of shelf-room, and other purposes con-
nected with their use threatened to grow beyond the means of the In-
stitution, appear to have been the moving causes which determined
the Regents to accept an arrangement by which Congress was to place
the Smithsonian library with its own in the Capitol, subject to the right
of the Regents to withdraw the books on paying the charges of bind-
ing, etc. Owing tothe same causes (which have affected the Library of
Congress itself) these principal conditions, except as regards their cus-
tody in a fire-proof building, have never been fulfilled.

The books are still deposited chiefly in the Capitol, but though they
have now increased from 40,000 to fully 250,000 volumes and parts of
14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

volumes, and form one of the most valuable collections of the kind in
existence, they not only remain unbound, but are in a far more crowded
and inaccessible condition than they were before the transfer. It is
hardly necessary to add that these facts are deplored by no one
more than by the present efficient Librarian of Congress.

The purchasing power of the publications of the Institution, when
offered in exchange, is far greater than that of money, and its benefit
is exerted chiefly in behalf of the National Library, and also to a con-
siderable extent in behalf of the National Museum.

The amount expended during the past forty years from the private
fund of the institution in the publication of books for gratuitous dis-
tribution has been $365,000, a sum more than half as great as the orig-
inal Smithson bequest.

These publications have had their influence for good in many ways,
but in addition to this, a library much more than equal in value to the
outlay has through their buying power come into the possession of the
nation. :

In addition to all this, a large amount of material has been acquired
for the Museum by direct expenditure from the private fund of the
Smithsonian Institution. The value of the collections thus acquired is
estimated to be more than equal to the whole amount of the Smithson
bequest.

The early history of the Museum was much like that of the library.
it was not until 1858 that it became the authorize: depository of the
scientific collections of the Government, and it was not until alter 1876
that it was officially recognized as the National Museum of the United
States.

But for the provident forethought of the Smithsonian Institution, the
United States would probably still be without even a reputable nucleus
for a National Museum.

The relations of the Museum to the system of popular lectures, for
many years established in Washington, and the assistance which it
affords each year to students of science, is referred to elsewhere in this
report.

The Institution publishes many circulars, giving information on scien-
tific subjects, which are distributed gratuitously to those who write to
make inquiries, and this system is being continually extended. In ad-
dition to this, a large correspondence is carried on with people in search
of information on scientific topics. Probably three thousand letters a
year go out to people who write seeking to know the name of some
object, or other scientific fact. Inquiries of this kind are always an-
swered promptly and fully, and frequently, to intelligent inquirers,
books are sent, which will enable them to find out such names for them-
selvesin future. This work has not only an educational value but often
a great economic importance as well; as, for instance, when some com-
non mineral has been mistaken for one of value; some useless’ plant
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15

has been wrongly identified and supposed to be of service in medicine,
or some harmless animal feared as noxious.

The publications of the Institution and its dependencies reach every
State and almost every county in the United States. A careful study
of the subject made two or three years ago by the president of one of
the scientific societies in Washington seems to indicate that there are
several States which are reached by no scientific publications whatever
except those distributed gratuitously by the Government.

Speaking of the Smithsonian Institution proper, and not of the Mu-
seum or any other trust that it administers, if may be stated that noth-
ing could be so desirable for the Institution as that Congress should
examine for itself whether, on the whole, in the execution of the trust
of Smithson, more has been given to the Government than has been
received ; for if,in attempting to increase and diffuse knowledge among
mankind, the machinery of the Institution’s action has been such that
it has incidentally paid over tothe Government the equivalent of muck
more than the whole original fund, these facts should surely be known
to those who have to ask themselves in what spirit as well as for wnat
purpose the Institution expends money placed in its charge.

Professor Langley has pointed out that “although by the judicious
administration of the Smithson fund nearly a million and a half dollars—
the fruits of its investment—have been applied during the past forty
years to the advancement of science and education in America (in ad-
dition to the principal, $703,000, larger now than ever before) it should
be remembered that the income of the Institution is only $42,000 a year,
a sum much smaller in its power to effect results than ever in previous
years.”

Can the United States fail to recognize its obligation to supplement
liberally this private contribution for public good, especially if it be
borne in mind that, as Professor Langley has recently shown, the Insti-
tution has left in perpetual charge of the nation, in the Museum alone,
property acquired out of its private fund (and to which it has appar-
ently the same title) which is probably now more than equal in value
to the whole amount of the Smithsonian bequest ?

THE EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE MUSEUM.

The work of the Museum, if it only performed the functions of an
institution for scientific investigation, would be of sufficient value to
justify its maintenance and extension.

As a matter of fact, it not only performs these functions but also does
a very great deal to render the resources of science available to the
public at large.

Professor Huxley’s definition of a museum was that it is ‘‘a consulta-
tive library of objects.”

The National Museum is a consultative library for the scientific man,
and it is something more. It aims to be an agency for the instruction
16 2EPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 189@.

of the people of the whole country, and to keep especially in mind the
needs of those whose time is not devoted to the study of science.

The spirit in which the work of the Museum is being carried on was
voiced in the address of one of its officers before the American Histori-
eal Association at its recent meeting in this city, in which it was said:

(1) That public institutions of this kind are not intended for the few, but
for the enlightenment and education of the masses.

(2) That the public has a right to full participation in the results of the
work of the scientific establishments which they are helping to maintain.

(3) That one of the chief duties of the officers of these institutions is to
provide means by which such results may be presented in an attractive as
well as an intelligible form.

No scientific institution is more thoroughly committed to the work of
the diffusion of knowledge tban is the Smithsonian Institution, and no
department of its activity is more capable of usefulness in this diree-
tion than is the National Museum.

The benefits of the Museum are extended not only to the specialists
in its laboratories and to the hundreds of thousands of visitors from
all parts of the United States who pass its doors each year, but to local
institutions and their visitors throughout the country.

In accordance with long-sanctioned usage, the duplicate specimens
in the Museum are made up into sets and distributed to schools and
museums, accurately named, aud of great service, both for museum and
class-room use.

The reports of the Smithsonian Institution will show how many hun-
dred thousands of objects have been thus distributed during the past
twenty-two years. Tivery museum in the United States has profited in
this way, and by its system of exchange the Museum has, while enrich-
ing itself, contributed largely to the stores of every important scientific
museum in the world.

Not only are specimens thus sent out, but aid is rendered in other
ways, Within the last few years a large number of local museums in
the United States have been supplied with working plans of cases in
use in the Museum, and similar sets of plans have been supplied within
the past few years to national museums in other countries.

Not only do the people of the country at large profit by the work of
the Smithsonian, as made ayailable to local institutions, but they profit
directly, and personally to a very considerable extent.

The curator of each department in the Museum is expected to be an
authority in his own line of work, and the knowledge of the whole staff
of experts is thus placed without cost at the service of every citizen.

B.—ORGANIZATION AND SCOPE OF THE MUSEUM.

The National Museum is under the direction of the Smithsonian In-
stitution, which is governed by an establishment consisting of the
President of the United States and his Cabinet, the Commissioner of
Patents, and the Board ot Regents, which latter is composed of the
Vice President of the United States, Chief Justice of the United States,
three members of the Senate, three members of the House of Repre-
sentatives, and six other citizens not members of Congress, two of
whom are residents of the city of Washington.

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is by law the “ keeper
of the collections.” The staff at the present time is composed of the
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in charge of the
National Museum and thirty-two curators and acting curators, twenty-
two of whom receive no salary from the Museum appropriation. There
are also eleven administrative departments.

PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF THE COLLECTIONS.

The collections of the Museum are made up, in large part, of the fol-
lowing materials:

(1) The natural bistory and anthropological collections, accumulated
since 1850 by the efforts of the officers and correspondents of the Smith-
sonian Institution.

(2) The collections of the Wilkes exploring expedition, the Perry
expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions.

(3) The collections of the scientific officers of the Pacific Railroad
survey, the Mexican boundary survey, and of the surveys carried on
by the Engineer Corps of the Army.

(4) The collections of the United States geological surveys under the
direction of United States geologists Hayden, King, and Powell.

(5) The collections of the U.S. Fish Commission.

(6) The gifts by foreign governments to the Museum or to the Presi-
dent or other public officers of the United States, who are forbidden
by law to retain such gifts in their private possessions.

(7) The collections made by the United States to illustrate the ani-
mal and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of the
native races of the country on the occasion of the International Exhi-
bition at Philadelphia in 1876, the fishery collections displayed by the
United States at the International Fisheries Exhibition at Berlin in
1880 and at London in 1883, and the collections obtained from various
local expositions, as for instance the New Orleans Cotton Centennial
Exposition in 1884 and 1885 and the Cincinnati Exposition in 1887.

(8) The collections given by the governments of the several foreign
nations, thirty in number, which participated in the exhibition at Phil-
adelphia in 1876.

H, Mis. 129, pt. 2 2

18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

(9) The industrial collections given by numerous manufacturing and
commercial houses of Europe and America, at the time of the Phila-
delphia Exhibition and subsequently.

(10) The material received, in exchange for duplicate specimens,
from the museums in Europe and America, at the time of the Philadel-
phia Exhibition and subsequently.

(11) Collections received as gifts, deposits, or in exchange, from in-
dividuals, numbering usually from a thousand to fifteen hundred each
year.

C.—SPECIAL TOPICS OF THE YEAR.

THE PROPOSED STATUE IN MEMORY OF PROFESSOR BAIRD.

On February 10, 1888, a bill passed the Senate making an appropri-
ation for the erection of a bronze statue in memory of Professor Baird.
This bill was referred, in the House of Representatives, to the Commit-
tee on the Library, but was not reported. On February 11, 1889, an
amendment was proposed by Hon. Justin 8. Morrill to the sundry civil
bill for 1889-’90, in the following words:

That the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution be, and are hereby, authorized to
contract for a statue in bronze of Spencer F. Baird, late Secretary of the Smithso-
nian Institution, to be erected upon the grounds in front of the National Museum;
and for this purpose, and for the entire expense of the foundation and pedestal of the
monument, the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, or so much of said sum as may be
needed, is hereby appropriated, out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise
appropriated.

On January 13, 1890, Hon. Justin 8. Morrill introduced a bill (S. 1940)
having the same object in view. This was read twice and referred to
the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds. On the following
day the bill was reported by Mr. Morrill without amendment.

ADDITIONAL FIRE-PROOF BUILDING.

On February 19, 1890, Hon. Justin S. Morrill reported from the Com-
mittee on Public Buildings and Grounds a bill (S. 2740) to provide for
the erection of an additional fire-proof building for the use of the
National Museum. This was read the first and second times by unani-
mous consent.

THE AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION.

The American Historical Association was founded in 1884, for the
promotion of historical studies; for the collection and preservation of
historical manuscripts, and for kindred purposes in American history..
By act of Congress, approved January 4, 1889, the Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution were authorized to permit the Association to.
deposit its collections in the Smithsonian Institution or im the National
Museum, Under this act the Association reports to the Smithsonian
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 19

Institution concerning its proceedings and the condition of historical
study in America. The first report of the Association, for 1889, was
transmitted to Congress June 16, 1890, and will be published as Senate
Miscellaneous Document No. 170.

OPENING OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM AND SMITHSONIAN BUILDINGS
DURING EXTRA HOURS.

On December 20, 1889, Hon. W. H. Crain, M. C., introduced a bill (H.
R. 3341), requiring the National Museum and Smithsonian buildings to
be kept open to the public from 10 a. m. to 5 p. m. during the months of
November to March inclusive; and from 11 a. m. to 6 p. m. during the
remaining months of the year. This was read twice, referred to the
Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, and ordered to be printed.
No further action has yet been taken by Congress. A new bill (H. KE.
7671), having in view practically the same object, and also providing for
an electric plant for lighting the Museum, was introduced later in the
session by Hon. W. H. Crain, and referred to the Committee on the
Library.

COLLECLION TO ILLUSTRATE THE COMPARATIVE HISTORY OF
RELIGION.

A collection of objects used in connection with the public and pri-
vate ceremonies of the Jews is being formed under the supervision of
Dr. Cyrus Adler. One case of objects relating to this subject is already
on exhibition. Many of them were obtained for the Museum by Dr. H.
Friedenwald. Among the specimens exhibited are, a manuscript copy
of the Pentateuch; a silk taleth; phylacteries of various sizes; a silver
spice-box; a manuscript copy of a tablet on which is kept a reckoning
of time between Passover and Pentecost: a shofar, or ram’s horn; a
manuscript roll of Esther; a lap of brass, and many objects pertain-
‘ing to domestic worship.

THE CAPRON COLLECTION.

In the report for 1888 (p. 19) reference is made to the introduction of
a bill into the Senate by Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees, providing for the
purchase of the collection of lacquers, bronzes, carved ivories, coins, and
other works of art obtained in Japan by the late Gen. Horace Capron.
The bill was favorably acted upon in the Senate, but did not come to a
vote in the House of Representatives. A new bill (No. 321) was intro-
duced into the Senate on December 4, 1889, by Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees,
for the same purpose. It was referred to the Committee on the Library,
whence it was reported favorably, and passed the Senate March 29,
1890. The amount appropriated was $14,675. This bill was favorably
reported by the House committee also on May 19, but has failed to
pass the House during the first session of the Fifty-first Congress.
20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890
GROWTH OF THE COLLECTIONS.

The accession records on June 30, 1890, showed 23,340 entries, rep-
resenting an estimated total of nearly 3,000,000 specimens. Of this
number, 13,451 accessions have been received since 1881. The average
number of entries of accessions received annually between 1881 and
1890 has been 1,495.

VISITORS TO THE MUSEUM.

The total number of visitors to the National Museum up to June 30,
1890, since the opening of the Museum building in 1881, is 2,111,949.

.

SATURDAY LECTURES.

The first lecture of the first series of these lectures was given on
March 11, 1882. Inall, 103 lectures have been delivered in nine courses,
the date of the last being April 3, 1890.

b The actual increase in the collections during the year 1889-90 is much greater than appears from
a comparison of the totals for 1889 and for 1890. Thisis explained by the apparent absence of any
increase in the Department of Lithology and Metallurgy, the total for 1890 in both of these departments
combined showing a decrease of 46,314 specimens, owing to the rejection of worthless material.

e Only a small portion of the collection represented by this number was received during the year
4889-90.

d This relates only to specimens received through the Museum, and does not include material added
to the National Herbarium, through the Department of Agriculture.

e Collections combined in October, 1889, under the Department of Geology. The apparent decrease
of more than 50 per cent. of the estimated total for 1889is accounted fo1 (1) by the rejection of several
thousanils of specimens from the collection, and (2) by the fact that no estimate of the ones in the
reserve and duplicate series is included. Of the total number for 1890 about 16,000 specimens consist
chiefly of petrographical material, stored away for study and comparison in the drawers of table cases.

Jf Transferred to National Zodlogical Park.

CATALOGUE ENTRIES DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1890.

The catalogue entries made in the books of the several departments
during the year amounted to 28,293 in number. The following table
shows the number of entries made in each department. It must be re-
membered that a catalogue entry seldom refers to only one specimen.
Thus if fifty specimens of birds are contributed by one person, from one
locality, they are entered under a single catalogue number. In the case
of the Department of Marine Invertebrates, one entry often includes
several hundred specimens.

DEVELOPMENT AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE EXHIBITION SERIES.

Owing to the already crowded condition of the exhibition halls,
there has been no opportunity of increasing very materially the exhi-
bition series in the several departments.

A large number of specimens of foods and textiles have been mounted
in bottles and boxes, ready to be placed on exhibition when space and
cases are available. The collection of Paleozoic invertebrate fossils has
been labeled. The fossils from the Cincinnati formation of Ohio have
been rearranged by Prof. Joseph F. James. The crustaceans from the
Water-lime formation of New York, and from the Chazy horizon of New
York and Vermont, have been relabeled, and, with much additional ma-

terial, placed on exhibition. A beautiful series of trilcbites has been
placed temporarily in the exhibition cases, awaiting permanent transfer
from the U. S. Geological Survey to the Museum. The Mesozoic fossils
have been classified and arranged for exhibition. Three groups of mam-
mals have been installed during the year, and a considerable number of
single specimens added to the exhibition series. Although the number of
specimens added to the collection of birdsis considerably less than in the
previous year, the appearance of the exhibition series has been greatly
improved by the substitution of new cases for the old ones, and by the
rearrangement and relabeling of the collection. A large collection of
illustrations of North American insects, prepared for the Paris Exposi-
tion, has been placed on exhibition. Lay figures representing a Pap-
uan, a Dyak and a Samoan, in native dress, have been placed in the
ethnological hall.

Technical and historical series of specimens have been placed on ex-
hibition in the section of graphic arts. The details of this arrangement
have been set forth in a circular intended for the guidance of visitors,
and printed in the report of the curator. A commencement has been
made of an exhibit of forestry objects. A large number of labels have
been added to the exhibition series of fishes, and the groups have
been brought more closely together. The material in the collection of
tertiary fossils has been segregated according to its biologic relations,
and its incorporation with the general collections. The collection of
minerals has been rearranged, and a new installation of the gem series
is under way. The collection of North American lizards has been in-
stalled in new quarters. Much time has been devoted by Dr. James
M. Flint to the arrangement of specimens of materia medica already
on hand. The Aino material collected by Mr. Romyn Hitchcock has
been fully labeled and installed. The economic collection of insects,
which was somewhat damaged during the return shipment from the
Paris Exposition, has been overhauled and put in place again. The
Hemiptera Heteroptera have been rearranged according to Uhler’s
check-list. The ores and general economic material in the exhibition
hall have been arranged into two principal series; the one, comprising
a systematic exhibit of all the principal ores of the metals arranged ;
the other, arranged geographically by States. Mr. Lucas has devoted
a portion of his time to the identification and arrangement of skeletons
of birds and tortoises. The classification of the star-fishes, collected by
the U.S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross in the North Pacific Ocean,
has been continued.

H.—THE MUSEUM STAFF.
THE SCIENTIFIC STAFF.

During the year, the departments of “ Lithology and Physical Geol-
ogy” and *‘ Metallurgy and Economic Geology ” have been united under
the designation of the Department of Geology. Since the organization
of the departments in the National Museum in 1881, these departments
have until now been kept entirely distinct, and each department has
been under the control of a curator. It has been thought for some time,
however, that it would be advantageous to the administration of the
Museum to combine the work of these closely allied departments, and
this was finally carried into effect on October 1, 1889, upon the resigna-
tion of Mr. F. P. Dewey. Mr. George P. Merrill is now in charge of the
Department of Geology.

Mr. Romyn Hitchcock, who on July 31, 1886, was furloughed to
enable him to visit Japan as an instructor in the University of Tokio,
returned January 20, 1889, and has again resumed his duties as curator
of the collection of Foods and Textiles.

The Smithsonian collection of scientific instruments, which some years
ago was transferred to the custody of the National Museum, has re-
ceived some additions during the year, and has been placed under the
chargeof Mr. W. C. Winlock, curator of the Bureau of International
Exchanges of the Smithsonian Institution.

In June, 1890, Dr. Frank Baker, Assistant Superintendent of the U.S.
Life Saving Service, resigned his position to accept an appointment
as curator of Comparative Anatomy in the National Museum. This
department has for many years been administered upon by Mr. F. W.
True as acting curator. Dr. Baker will not, however, at present assume
the duties of this position, having received from the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution a temporary appointment as acting manager
of the National Zodlogical Park.

Mr. William T. Hornaday, for several years chief taxidermist, was on
May 9, 1888, appointed curator of the Department of Living ‘Animate
On May 6, 1889, he was placed in charge of the National Zoological
Park; and on June 15, 1889, resigned this position. The collection of
living animals hitherto under the care of the Museum has now been
transferred to the custody of Dr. Frank Baker, as acting manager of
the Zodlogical Park.

At the request of Prof. C. V. Riley, Mr. John B. Smith, formerly
assistant curator of Insects in the National Museum, was engaged
from January 3 to February 3, 1890, to work upon the collection of
Noctwide.

Mr. William Harvey Brown, of the National Museum, accompanied
the Government “ Eclipse Expedition” to Africa for the purpose of
collecting natural history specimens for the Museum. The expedition
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 27

sailed in October, 1889, on the U.S. 8S. Pensacola. A reference to Mr.
Brown’s explorations will be found in the chapter devoted to that
subject.

On account of the increasing administrative duties which have been
placed upon Mr. Richard Rathbun, of the U.S. Fish Commission, it has
been found impossible to keep up the current work in the Department
of Marine Invertebrates. It therefore seemed desirable to appoint an
assistant, paid by the Museum, who could devote his entire time, under
the supervision of Mr. Rathbun, to the work of the department. Mr.
James E. Benedict, formerly naturalist of the Fish Commission, who
had severed his connection with the Commission in 1886, accepted an
appointment on January 13, 1890, as assistant curator of the Depart-
ment of Marine Invertebrates.

At the request of Dr. C. A. White, the director of the U. 8S. Geolog-
ical Survey appointed Mr. T. W. Stanton to assist Dr. White in the
work of the Department of Mesozoic Invertebrate Fossils in the Museum.

There are now thirty-one organized departments and sections in the
Museum under the care of curators, including honorary and acting
curators, and assistant curators.

THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF.

No changes of importance have been made during the year. Mr. R.
HK. Karll has been engaged, since March, 1889, on special duty in the
office of the Assistant Secretary.

The Department of Furniture, Supplies, and Accounts continues
under the charge of Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk of the National Mu-
seum. A statement of the work accomplished will be found on page 62.

Mr. A. Howard Clark has continued his work as editor of Proceed-
ings and Bulletins of the National Museum. The preparation and
printing of labels for Museum specimens has, as in past years, Ast
been under his supervision.

The Museum library, which is made up, for the most part, of that
portion of the library of the Smithsonian Institution which is required
for reference by the curators of the scientific departments in the Mu-
seum, is under the care of Mr. John Murdoch, librarian of the Smith-
sonian Institution. A statement relating to the operations of the library
during the year will be found on page 48.

Mr. Henry Horan, superintendent of buildings, with Mr. Charles A.
Steuart as assistant superintendent, has continued in charge of the
work of the mechanics and laborers of the Museum. On page 71 will
be found a statement of the work accomplished by the force of mechan-
ics and laborers.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 29

F.—REVIEW OF WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENTS.

DIVISION OF ANTHROPOLOGY.

Department of Ethnology.—The first three months of the year covered
by this report were spent by Prof. Otis T. Mason, curator, in studying
the anthropological collections in Europe, especially those at the Paris
Exposition, during the session of the Tenth International Congress of
Anthropology and Prehistoric Archeology, an account.of which is
submitted in his annual report.

The curator is giving much attention to three special lines of research
and collection in connection with the work of his department; first,
among the Indian tribes of our own country; second, among the South
American tribes; third, among the African tribes of the west coast,
especially those whose descendants made up the former slave popula-
tion of the United States, for the purpose of comparison with the effects
which civilization has had upon the race in this country.

Following up the work of former years, much time has been devoted
to the study of the bow, the arrow, the quiver and armor.

Mr. Walter Hough is making a thorough study of the production of
fire by primitive peoples, and has published in the Museum report
for 1888 an exhaustive paper on fire-making apparatus, as represented
in the collections of the U. 8. National Museum.

Among the most important accessions is the collection of Japanese
and Aino material gathered by Mr. Romyn Hitchcock. This material
has been labeled and installed in the Museum. The collection of Afri-
can material has been enriched by the addition of objects from the
Inhambane Zulus, collected by the missionary, Rev. KE. H. Richards,
and presented by Oberlin College. Mr. W. H. Brown, naturalist of the
United States Eclipse Expedition, secured material from Angola, and
Mr. J. H. Camp contributed objects from the Congo.

Several valuable collections of Samoan material have been received
through Admiral Kimberly, U.S. Navy, and from Ensign W. E. Safford.
Mrs. H. A. P. Carter has given photographs and specimens from the
Sandwich Islands. Dr. H. N. Allen, court physician to the King of
Corea, has deposited in the Museum his rich collection from that king-
dom. Dr. Washington Matthews’s collection of Navajo silver-work has
been acquired ; also specimens of old Indian work of great value from
Rev. i. C. Chirouse through the Department of the Interior; speci-
mens from Idaho and Washington from Dr. George M. Kober, U. S.
Army, and collections from the Hupa Valley, California, made by N. J.
Pureell and Jeremiah Curtin.

Department of American Prehistoric Pottery.—The installation of the
_ exhibition series of pottery isnow almost completed, and very little re-
P mains to be done excepting in connection with the labeling of specimens.
Mr. William H. Holmes has continued to act as honorary curator of
30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

this department. The principal alditions to the collections have been
secured through the codperation of the Bureau of Ethnology, with which
Mr. Holmes is officially associated. One of the most interesting is a
group of vases from a mound on the Savannah River, obtained by Mr.
H. L. Reynolds. In connection with the monograph which Dr. Cyrus
Thomas, of the Bureau of Ethnology, has undertaken upon the Mound-
builders, the curator has conducted researches upon the collections
from the mounds of the Mississippi Valley and adjacent regions. The
number of specimens added to the collection during the year is estimated
at) 1,047, and 232 entries have been made in the catalogue.

Section of Oriental Antiquities —The collection is under the curator-
ship of Prof. Paul Haupt, of the Johns Hopkins University, with Dr.
Cyrus Adler acting as assistant curator.

Many valuable accessions have been received during the year.
Among these is a cast of the famous temple inscription discovered by
Clermont-Ganneau in 1871, which was obtained through the courtesy
of the United States minister to Turkey. Mr. Theodore Graf, of Vienna,
and Dr. Zehnpfund, of Leipsic, have also made important contributions,
A collection of copies of the Assyrian seals has been commenced, and
much assistance has been rendered by Dr. William Hayes Ward, of
New York, Prof. D. G. Lyon, of Harvard University, and Prof. H.
Hyvernat, of the Catholic University in Washington. <A collection of
oriental manuscripts, formed by Mr. William B. Hodgson, and uutil
recently in the care of the Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences of
Savannah (Georgia), has been placed in the custody of the Smithsonian
Institution.

The curator attended the Kighth International Congress of Orient-
alists, which met at Stockholm in September, as the representative of
the Sinithsonian Institution.

There has been added a case of objects illustrating the public and
private religious ceremonies of the Jews, collected and arranged by Dr.
Adler. These objects were obtained partiy through purchase, but
chiefly through gitt and deposit. Some of the more interesting were
collected by Dr. H. Friedenwald.

Dr. Adler thus explains the character of the collection :

The collection may be divided into two sections comprising the ob-
jects employed respectively in public and private ceremonial.

The Pentateuch or Law (Hebrew Torah) is considered by Jews the
most important part of the Bible, and a section of it is read every week
in the synagogue. For this purpose a manuscript-copy is employed,
printed copies not being used. When not in use the roll is covered
with a cloak and placed upright in an ark or chest; to prevent the
reader from losing his place, a pointer in the shape of a hand (called
in Hebrew Yad or ‘*‘hand”) is employed. The collection contains a
manuscript pentateuch unrolled with the pointer, and above it the
cloak and winding-scarf which envelop it when placed in the ark.

At the morning service in the synagogue the male members of the
congregation wear a special garment, a sort of scarf, kuown as the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 31

Taleth. This garment is a survival of the outer robe of the ancient
Hebrews. They wear on the corners a fringe or tassel in which is a
thread of blue. A garment of the form now used is referred to in the
New Testament (Matthew Ix, 20; xtv, 36; Luke vii, 44). They are
made of silk, weolen, and even of cotton goods. The grave-clothes of
a male Israelite consist of a shroud and the taleth. The specimen in
the collection is made of silk.

These objects are used at the Saturday morning service, and the
taleth at the daily morning service where this survives. It is also worn
at the afternoon service on Sabbath and fasts, and at the evening serv-
ice of Sabbaths and testivals by the officiating minister only.

In addition to the taleth, the male members of the congregation wear
at the morning service of week days, pbylacteries, and where daily
synagogue service is not held, they are employed in private devotion.
Certain Byenibe: of the Pentateuch (Exodus x1u, 9, 10, 16; 1 Deuter-
onomy VI, 4, 9, 13, 22) enjoin that the law should. be a sion upon the
hand and oo frontlets between the eyes. These passages, inscribed
upon several pieces of parchment and inclosed in a leather case prepared
for the purpose, are bound on the forehead between the eyes. The
same passages written on one slip of parchment and iuclosed in a sim-
ilar case are bound on the left arm above the elbow. They are called
by the Jews tefillin (from tefilla, “ prayer”), a word found in the Tal-
mud, but not in the Bible. They are referred to in the New Testament
(Matthew xxi, 5). The collection contains several sets of phylacte-
ries of various sizes.

Special services call for the use of particular objects of ceremony.

At the conclusion of the Sabbath there are added some special
prayers, and the service known as Habdalah, or separaticn. The objects
used in this service are a cup of wine, a spice-box, and a candle. First,
blessing is said over the wine, next over the spices, and last over the
light. The candle is then extinguished by having wine poured upon
it. The collections contain a specimen of a silver spice-box, supposed
to have been manufactured in Laupheim (Wiirtemberg), Germany,
about 1740. There is a tradition that at the beginning of the Sabbath
a special angel accompanies the worshiper from the “synagogue; this
angel remains with him until the conclusion of the Sabbath. The de-
parture of the angel leaves the man faint, and the spices are intended
to restore him.

The second great Jewish feast is the feast of weeks, also called ‘feast
of harvest” and day of first fruits. The harvest referred to is the grain
harvest. Deuteronomy Xvi, 9, commands: ‘Seven weeks shalt thou
number unto thee,” beginning the day after Passover, when the first
Omer was presented. The fiftieth day (Pentecost) was observed as a
sacred feast. Since medieval times the Jews also celebrate it as the
anniversary of the delivery of the law on Mount Sinai. Following
Leviticus xx1U, 2, the Samaritans observed Pentecost on Sunday. The
Hebrew word meaning a handful of grain, a sheaf, is Omer, and the
period between Passover and Pentecost is known as the Omer season.
The days of this season are reckoned and the number announced each

_ day. For the purpose of keeping the reckoning, a tablet is hung up in

the synagogue. The collection contains a manuscript copy of such a
tablet which was employed by a Spanish-Jewish congregation. The
tablet is in Hebrew. It contains the words “Blessed art thou Lord,
our God, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us with His com-
: mandments and commanded us to count the Omer.” Then follows the
- count (in Hebrew) and below it the words ‘‘ May the Lord restore the
32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

worship of the temple speedily in our days” (Psaim Lxvi1). On the left
are the letters H. S. and D., which indicate respectively Omer (written
Homer by the Spanish Jews) week (Sabbat) and day.

In the Jewish ceremonial on solemn occasions, and especially on New
Year’s day (September), a blast is sounded from a trumpet called Shofar.
It is made of a ram’s horn whose shape is modified by heat. Accord-
ing to authorities on musical instruments, it is the oldest form of wind-
instrument known to be retained in use. It is mentioned in the Bible
as being used to announce the new moon and solemn feasts and to pro-
claim the year of release. Occasionally it was employed as a masical
instrument, but its most frequent use was for military purposes. It
was the signal for going out to battle, for the announcement of a vic-
tory, and for the recall of the troops. The specimen in the collection is
an example of the seventeenth century, from Italy.

The feast of Purim was established to commemorate the deliverence
of the Jews, recorded in the book of Esther. On this occasion the book
is read in the synagogue, a manuscript copy being employed. ‘The coi-
lection contains a manuscript roll of the Hebrew original, with hand-
painted views. The book is usually called Megilla (roll), or more accu-
rately Megiliat Esther (roll of Esther). The Song of Solomon, Ruth, EKe-
clesiastes, and Lamentations are written in a similar form, and they
together with Esther are called ‘the five rolls.”

The feast of dedication, or Hanuwka, is held in remembrance of the re-
dedication of the Temple of Jerusalem after its defilement by Antiochus
Epiphanes (169 B.C.). Josephus records that it was a festival of lights.
The feast is celebrated 8 days, one light being lit on the first night
of the feast, and an additional light on each succeeding night. The col-
lection contains a lamp of brass,-hand made, with eight compartments
for oil. The lamp is of Dutch make, and its form exhibits an interest-
ing survival of the ancient Roman lamp.

The specimens described are employed at public worship, though
some of them may be used at private devotion. Any place in which
ten male Israelites congregate is considered a place of public worship.

The following objects pertain exclusively to private worship:

The Mosaic legislation enjoined that the law should be written on the
posts of the door and on the gates. This injunction is performed by
inclosing a slip of parchment in a reed, or metallic or wooden cylinder,
on which has been written Deuteronomy V1, 4-9, 13-21, and attaching
it to the doorpost of the house, and sometimes of each room in the
house. At present the Jews of the East often nail to the door-casing
the entire decalogue inclosed in a tin case called Mezuzza. This custom
has been widely adopted by other peoples of the East, particularly by
Mussulmans, who select for this purpose passages from the Koran.

Whether at public or private devotion, the Jews invariably turn the
face toward Jerusalem. For the large majority of Jews this direction
is east. Synagogues are always built with the ark containing the man-
uscript copies of the Pentateuch at the eastern end of the building, and
worshippers face this direction. As a reminder of the direction a card
or scroll is hung up in the dwelling called Mizrach (the east). The
specimen in the collection contains the Ten Commandments and vati-
ous quotations from scripture in Hebrew. Ancient nations that wor-
shipped the sun, turned when in prayer to the east, the place of the
rising sun. This fact is alluded to by Ezekiel (v111, 16). In the temple
itself the worshippers faced towards the west, the entrance being from
the east.

Before the principal meals of the Sabbath day the Jews have a, special
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 33

service, including prayers over the bread and wine, which is known as
Kiddush or “sanctification.” The head of the family has in front of him
a plate containing two loaves of bread, covered by a cloth, of which
there is a specimen in the collection. This cloth, called Kiddush cloth,
contains the prayers to be recited, and representations of the Temple,
etc., evidently after old wood cuts. The practice of saying a blessing
before eating is referred to, I Samuel 1x, 13. It nodoubt had its origin
in the fact that a public meal of any sort was usually preceded by a
sacrifice. ‘Asking the blessing” was common in New Testament times.
The later Jews enjoined also that thanks should be returned after the
repast.

iAt the meal of the Passover eve (probably the same as the ‘ Lord’s
Supper”) special plates were used on which to place cakes of unleavened
bread. The collection contains two such, one made of brass containing
fantastic figures and « Hebrew inscription, from Constantinople; the
other of pewter, manufactured at Tetenhausen (near Gusburg) in Ger-
many.

Teas customary among the Jews to reserve a special lamp for use
on the eve of the Sabbath only. Oil was burned in these from either
six or eight prongs. Seven prongs were never used, because this lamp
was not to be of the same shape as the seven-pronged candlestick of
the sanctuary. The collection contains two specimens of the form used
by the Jews of Germany, one having been manufactured in the eigh-
teenth century at Fellheim, Germany.

The collection also contains a map of Palestine and surrounding
countries, with the names of places marked in Hebrew characters, a
chromo-lithographie restoration of the Tabernacle, a series of pnoto-
graphs of the ruins of ancient synagogues, of the Arch of Titus, and
of the exteriors and interiors of the celebrated synagogues of Europe.

Section of Foods and Textiles.—Upon the return of Mr. Romyn Hitch-
cock, from Japan, he reassumed the custody of the collections of Food
and Textiles. A greater portion of the year has been consumed in the
examination and classification of the material which had accumulated
during his absence. He has prepared an index to the collection, show-
ing the series to which each specimen has been assigned, and also a
list of the specimens in the exhibition series. The labeling of the col-
lection of foods of the North American Indians has been completed.
The labeling of the collection of textiles has also for the most part been
furnished. Mr. Hitchcock, in addition to his regular work, has pre-
pared two papers embodying the results of his observations in Japan
during 1887 and 1888. These are entitled “The Ancient Pit-dwellers
of Yezo,” and “The Ainos of Yezo.” Both of these papers are pub-
lished in this report.

The number of specimens of textiles in the exhibition, reserve, and
duplicate series is 2,211; 38 catalogue entries have been made. The
number of specimens in the food collection on exhibition, and also in
the reserve and duplicate series is 1,111; 68 entries have been made
in the catalogue. In this total the specimens collected by Mr. Hitchcock,
from the Ainos of Japan, are not included.

In the chemical collection, also under Mr. Hitchcock’s eare, there are
now 457 specimens on exhibition, and 852 specimens in the reserve and

H. Mis. 129, pt. 2——3
34 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

duplicate series. There have been made 42 entries in the catalogue
devoted to chemicals, including oils, gums, and resins.

Department of Prehistoric Anthropology.—The curator, Mr. Thomas
Wilson, visited the Paris Exposition, as the representative of the
Smithsonian Institution, for the special purpose of attending the Inter-
national Congresses of Hygiene, Criminal Anthropology, Anthropology,
and Prehistoric Archeology, and the French Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science. An account of his visit is given in his annual
report in section II.

The most important accession during the year is the collection of
archeological specimens, principally from the District of Columbia,
presented by Mrs. J. C. Bruff, of Washington, District of Columbia.
Contributions were also received from Mr. Thomas Wilson, the curator,
Mr. H. de Morgan, New York City; Mr. J. P. Monroe, Ringgold, Ten-
nessee; Messrs. Bangs & Company, New York City; Mr. 8. V. Proud-
fit, Falls Church, Virginia; The Peabody Museum, Cambridge, Mas-
sachusetts (through Prof. F. W. Putnam); Dr. Hilborn T. Cresson,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Mr. L. H. Jammes, Realmont, France.

The collections have been divided into an exhibition and a study
series. A classification of the stone arrow, or spear-heads, and of the
knives has been commenced.

In the catalogue 1,483 entries have been made during the year. The
entire collection contains 122,679 specimens.

Section of Transportation and Engineering.—Other duties of the cura-
tor, Mr. J. HK. Watkins, as engineer of property, have prevented him
from devoting much time to the development of this collection. Con-
siderable progress has, however, been made both in the arrangement
and labeling of the specimens. The system of classification has been
set forth in a previous report of the curator.

The accessions during the year though less numerous than in the
previous year are equal in importance.

To the series illustrating the history of the stationary steam engine,
a portion of the cylinder of the first steam engine erected on the western
continent has been added.

Interesting specimens relating to the early history of the telegraph
have been received.

Two drawings made by Fulton, one of the Chancellor Livingston,
and the other of the machinery of the Catherine of Clermont, have been
added to the steamboat series.

The original boiler of the locomotive Stourbridge Lion, has been added
to the series illustrating the history of the development of the locomo-
tive. It is the intention of Mr. Watkins to mount the boiler on the
original driving- wheels, and to replace many of the original parts which
are still in existence, and thus as far as possible complete the restora-
tion of this locomotive.

The nucleus of a collection illustrative of the history of the develop-
ment of the bicycle, has been secured. A model of the English “Dandy
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. aD

Horse” has beeu made in the Museum workshops, and two old-fashioned
velocipedes with wooden wheels have been acquired. A number of
drawings of parts of bicycles have also been secured.

The study series has been increased by a number of photographs
and prints.

The preparation of a card catalogue of the collection has been com-
menced. The collection now contains approximately 1,250 specimens.
Seven hundred and fifty entries have been made during the year in the

_ catalogue.

Section of Materia Medica.—The collection of materia medica speci-
mens is still under the charge of Dr. James M. Flint, U.S. Navy, by
whom the collection was first organized in 1881. Hereports that much
time has been devoted to the identification and arrangement of speci-
mens already on hand, and to the classification and installation of new
material. The most important contribution to the collection are a col-
lection of East India drugs, from the Royal Botanical Gardens, at Kew,
England, and the collection of medicinal substances contributed by
Messrs. W. H. Schieffelin & Co,of New York. The preparation of de-
scriptive labels has been pushed rapidly forward, and the labeling of the
collection is now almost completed, as well as the completion of a card
catalogue of the collection, by means of which the present. position of
every specimen may be readily ascertained. The present state of the
collection is highiy satisfactory. There are now 3,213 specimens of drugs
on exhibition. The reserve series contains 1,203 specimens. The total
number of specimens in the collection, including the illustrations, is
5,915. The number of catalogue entries during the year is 179.

Section of Graphic. Arts.—The arrangement of the collection in this
Department has been for the time completed. The manuscript for the
labels, which has been prepared for some time, is stiil in the printer’s
hands. A circular has been printed explaining the arrangement of the
collection.

The most important accession during the year is the collection of
materials, prints, and tools illustrative of the process of chromoxy-
lography in Japan, given to the Museum by Mr. T. Tokuno, chief of
the Japanese Government Printing Office at Tokio.

A series of drawings made by pupils of the Art Academy of Cincin-
nati, and presented by the Cincinnati Museum Association has been
placed on exhibition.

During the year accessions were received from forty-seven sources,
and nine additions were made by purchase to the sectional library.
The number of entries made in the catalogue during the year was 577.

DIVISION OF ZOOLOGY.

Department of Mammals.—The accessions to this Department during

the year are regarded by Mr. F. W. True, curator, as being of more

than ordinary interest. The collections received from Dr, W, L. Ab:
36 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

bott, and those obtained by the naturalists who accompanied the United
States Eclipse Expedition to South Africa, are of special interest.

Three new groups of mounted animals have been placed on exhibi-
tion during the year, and thirty-three single specimens have been
mounted and placed on exhibition.

Five hundred and sixty-one specimens have been added to the collee-
tion during the year, in addition to a large amount of material de-
posited by the Department of Agriculture.

Department of Birds.—The exhibition series in this Department has
been very greatly improved during the year. The extensive collections
made by the U. S. Fish Commission on the Galapagos Islands, and in
other parts of tropical America, have been worked up by the curator,
and the results have been published in Vol. x11 of the Proceedings of
the National Museum. A collection of birds from Costa Rica has been
described in Vol. xt of the Proceedings of the National Museum. A
careful revision has been made of the genera Xiphocolaptes and Sclerw-
rus, and published in Vol. x1r of the Proceedings of the National
Museum. Dr. Leonhard Stejneger has continued his studies on the
birds of Japan and the Hawaiian Islands, and has prepared a paper on
the extinct Pallas’ Cormorant of Bering Island.

The number of specimens in the reserve, duplicate, and exhibition
series is now estimated by Mr. Ridgway to be 60,219, giving an increase
of 2,245 specimens during the year. The number of catalogue entries
made during the year is 1,739.

Department of Birds’ Eggs.—The collection of birds’ eggs remains in
the custody of Capt. Charles E. Bendire, U. 8S. Army.

Among the accessions received during the year, fifteen are mentioned
by Captain Bendire in his annual report as being of special importance.
Among the most valuable is a collection of nests and eggs made near
Fort St. James and presented by Mr. Robert MacFarlane, of the Hud-
son’s Bay Company, also a collection of nests and eggs from Colorado,
presented by Mr. Denis Gale. Several species, new to the collections,
have been received during the year, including some nests of rare birds.
The uumber of eggs of North American birds is now 44,326, and of for-
eign birds 4,424. The number of nests in the reserve and exhibition
series is 2,491, making a grand total of 51,241 specimens of eggs and
nests in the collection. This gives an increase of 1,068 over the total of
last year.

Department of Reptiles and Batrachians.—Dr. Leonhard Stejneger,
recently appointed curator of this Department, has commenced a
rearrangement of the collections. The collection of North American
lizards has been reclassified and catalogued. The most important
accession of the year is a large series of reptiles and batrachians col-
lected by Dr. C. Hart Merriam in the San Francisco mountain plateau
in Arizona, Collections made by the U.S. Fish Commission steamer
Albatross, and by Prof. Dayid 8, Jordan, president of the Indiana State

University, contain much new material. The curator made a valuable
collection of reptiles, birds, and mammals in Arizona, New Mexico, and
Texas, during the months of September, October, and November.

The curator has made a special study of the geographical distribu-
tion of the reptiles and batrachians of the southwestern Territories of
the United States. He has also published in the Proceedings of the
National Museum a number of papers describing new species.

The total estimated number of specimens in the Department is now
29,050. During the year 705 catalogue entries have been made.

Department of Fishes—In the early part of the year the honorary
curator, Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, was in Alaska for the purpose of investi-
gating the condition of the fisheries, in connection with his official duties
as ichthyologist of the U.S. Fish Commission. During his absence the
routine work of the Department was carried on by Mr. Barton A. Bean,
assistant.

The number of accessions received during the year is 38. Prominent
among them are a collection of fishes from Switzerland; a large collec-
tion of fishes from Galapagos Islands, Panama, British Columbia,
Alaska, and other regions in the Pacific Ocean, gathered by the natur-
alists of the U.S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross ; a collection of
American Siluroids, from the Museum of Comparative Zodlogy at Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts ; a series of fishes collected in the Yellowstone
Park, by Dr. David 8S. Jordan and his assistants, transmitted by the
U.S. Fish Commission. The Fish Commission has also deposited in the
Museum an extensive collection of fishes made by Dr. Jordan in several
of the southern and western States and Territories, during the summer

of 1889.
In the catalogue of the Department 1,016 entries have been made.

The estimated number of specimens in the exhibition, reserve and du-
plicate series, is now about 122,000.

Department of Mollusks (including tertiary fossils)—Mr. William H.
Dall, of the U. S. Geological Survey, has continued to take charge of
this department. He has been assisted in the scientific work of the
Department by Dr. Rh. KE. C. Stearns, as adjunct curator, and by Mr.
Frank Burns and Mr. Gilbert Harris, of the Geological Survey, by whom
several important results have been accomplished. Considerable prog-
ress has been made in the determination, assorting, and labeling of
material. Special reports upon collections received from the Fish Com-
mission, the Navy Department, the Department of Agricuiture, the
Revenue Marine Service, and other sources have been made. A pre-
liminary report upon the collections of the Albatross has been com-
pleted, and a report upon the collections made by the Eclipse Expedi-
tion to Africa is in course of preparation.

Mr. Dall has partially completed a report upon the Plio-Miocene mol-
lusk fauna of Florida, the first part of which is now being printed by

_ the Wagner Free Institute of Science, in Philadelphia.
38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

The total number of accessions received during the year is given in
Mr. Dall’s report as 87. The total number of specimens received is
estimated at 3,500, representing about 1,200 species. Valuable collec-
tions have been contributed by Mr. Henry Hemphill, from Lower Cali-
fornia. Important additions to the fauna of Florida have been received
from Messrs. G. W. Webster, J. J. White, and I. Greegor; and collec-
tions of West Florida shells have been presented by Mr. W. F. De-
Golier. The Geological Survey has transferred to the Museum a yal-
uable collection of Post-Pliocene types, illustrating the paper of Mr.
R. KE. Callin regard to the fresh-water fossils of Bonneville Lake Basin,
Utah. A series of the sinaller species of land shells has been presented
by Dr. Sterki. Mr. W. G. Binney has contributed several additions
to the Binney collection of American land-shells. A series of slides
of sections of typical mollusks has been received from Dr. P. H. Car-
penter, of Eton College, England.

Mr. Dall reports that about 75,000 specimens are now ready for sys-
tematic arrangement in the new cases which have been proved for
this Department.

Department of Insects.—Prof. C. V. Riley, entomologist of the De-
partment of Agriculture, continues in charge of the Department of
Insects. The laboratory space of this department has been enlarged.
The educational series in the exhibition hall has been improved. A
large number of illustrations of. North American insects, prepared by
Professor Riley for exhibition at the Paris Exposition, have been added
to the exhibition series

Several important accessions have been received during the year.
Lord Walsingham has presented 125 species of rare Micro-Lepidoptera.
Mr. A. Koebele has placed in the collection a well-mounted series of
Australian and New Zealand insects, and has also presented to the
Museum 4,600 specimens of insects, chiefly Coleoptera, collected by
him in California. A collection representing 120 species of Lepidoptera
from East Africa has been received from Dr. W. L. Abbott, the col-
lector. An interesting collection of West and South African insects
collected by Mr. William Harvey Brown, has been received. The col-
lection of insects belonging to the late Dr. Asa Fitch, and purchased
by the Department of Agriculture, has been placed in the Museum.

The arrangement of the collection of North American Coleoptera has
been completed. Several special researches on entomological subjects,
and relating more or less to Museum material, have been made during
the year by the curator, and by Messrs. L. O. Howard, of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture; John B. Smith, formerly assistant curator; W.
H. Ashmead, and Lawrence Bruner.

About 15,000 specimens have been added to the collection during the
year, and 89 entries have been made in the catalogue.

Department of Marine Invertebrates.—Mr. Richard Rathbun, honor-
ary curator, reports increased activity in the work of his department,
<a

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 39

owing chiefly to the appointment of an assistant curator, Mr. James E.
Benedict. All of the material, including the general alcoholic collec-
tions in the main storage-rooms, has been kept in excellent condition.

The accessions have been greater in number and of more importance
than during the preceding year. A very valuable series of European
marine invertebrates was received from Rev. A. M. Norman, of Burn-

' moor Rectory, Durham, England. The U.S. Commission has trans-

ferred to the Museum two very large collections from the Pacific Ocean,

gathered by the Fish Commission steamer Albatross.

Other accessions deserving special mention were received from Wes-
leyan College, Middletown, Connecticut; W. H. Brown, naturalist,
with the United States Eclipse Expedition to South Africa; the Bureau
of Navigation, Navy Department; the U.S. 8S. Dolphin, Commander
George F. F. Wilde, commanding; Prof. O. B. Johuson, University of
Washington, Seattle, Washington ; and Mr. Romyn Hitchcock.

The arrangement of type series of alcholic specimens has been contin-
ued. The alcoholic collection of aleyonarians and actinians, and the
entire collections of brachyurans and anomourans, have been over-
hauled, and the card catalogues revised and completed. The assorting
of Mr. Dall’s Alaskan collection, which has been in progress for several
years, has been completed. Much time has been spent in making up
sets of duplicates for distribution.

The shore and shallow-water Echini, collected by the U.S. Fish Com-
mission steamer Albatross on the west coast of North America in 1888
and 1889, have been identified and a type series deposited in the Mu-
seum.

The assistant curator has identified the crustaceans collected by the
United States Eclipse Expedition to West Africa, and has begun the
study of the Alaskan annelids obtained by Mr. Dall and by the Fish
Commission. Prof. Walter Faxon, of the Museum of Comparative
Anatomy, Cambridge, Massachusetts, has finished his investigation of
the cray-fishes lent to him, and has returned them, together with a re-
port, which has been published in the Proceedings of the Museum.*

Vertebrate Fossils —This department is under the honorary curator-
ship of Prof. O. C. Marsh, of Yale College, New Haven. Mr. F. A.
Lueas, assistant curator of the Department of Comparative Anatomy,
has classified and arranged in drawers a portion of a large number of
types of the species described by Dr. Leidy.

The most important addition to the collection is a skull of Thoraco-
saurus neocesaurus, presented by Mr. Nelson C. Page.

Department of Paleozoic Invertebrate Fossils—Among the most im-
portant accessions to the collection of paleozoic fossils during the year,
three are mentioned in the report of the curator. The first is from
the British Museum, and includes a large number of trilobites. The
second consists of 592 specimens from the Lower Cambrian and the

* Vol. x1, No. 785, pp. 619-634.
40 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

Lorraine formation of Ordovician, transferred by the U. 8. Geological
Survey. The third, also transferred by the U. S. Geological Survey,
is a collection of 178 specimens from the Hudson Terrane of the Ordo-
vician, and 109 specimens from the Upper Silurian.

The curator has been specially interested in the collection of material
for the illustration of the middle Cambrian fauna, and in studying the
literature of the Cambrian rocks of America. The fossils from the Cin-
cinnati formation of Ohio have been rearranged by Prof. Joseph F.
James, and attention has been paid to the exhibition series of erusta-
ceans from the Waterlime formation of New York, and to the collec-
tion from the Chazy horizon of New York and Vermont, which has
been relabeled and placed upon exhibition. Dr. R. R. Gurley has been
employed in labeling and in making a special study upon American
graptolites. Twenty-nine accessions have been received during the year.
These represent 1,229 individual specimens, including 180 genera, 239
species, and 5 varieties. Five thousand four hundred and tweive en-
tries have been made in the catalogue.

Department of Mesozoic Invertebrate Fossils.—Dr. C. A. White, of the
U.S. Geological Survey, continues to act as curator of the collection of
mesozoic fossils. The pressure of work connected with his duties as an
officer of the Geological Survey has rendered it impossible for him to
devote more than a small portion of time to Museum matters. Con-
siderable progress hasbeen made in identifying collections transferred
to the Museum by the Geological Survey.

The arrangement of the exhibition series has been for the present
completed.

DIVISION OF BOTANY.

Department of Botany.—The report of Dr. George Vasey, honorary
curator, shows that several collections of considerable value have been
added to the National Herbarium during the year.

Among the more important accessions are: A set of 550 species of
Japanese plants from 8. Tegima, Director of the Educational Museum,
Tokio, Japan; 335 specimens collected in Mexico by C. G. Pringle;
1,800 specimens of Southern Californian plants from C. R. Orcutt, San
Diego, California; 80 species of Canadian grasses from John Macoun,
Geological and Natural History Survey of Canada; 2,817 specimens of
Texan plants collected by G. C. Nealley, of Houston, Texas; 900 speci-
mens of East Florida plants from J. H. Simpson, Manatee, Florida;
400 specimens, collected in Lower California and Western Mexico by
Edward Palmer; 327 specimens of Californian and Mexican plants,
from the California Academy of Science; the first 135 species of a set
of Bolivian plants collected by Miguel Bang; about 100 Pacific Slope
species from EK. L. Greene, Berkeley, California; 142 species of the
Hepatice Cubensis Wrightiane, from the Harvard University herbarium;
500 specimens from the United States Eclipse Expedition to Africa;
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 4]

320 species of European mosses from Dr. I. Hagen, Trondbhjem, Nor-
way; 800 specimens collected by Frederick V. Coville, of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, in Virginia and North Carolina.

The total number of specimens in the National Herbarium is esti-
mated as follows: Mounted, 155,000; duplicates, 18,000.

This portion of the National Herbarium is in great danger owing to
the lack of fire-proof rooms in which it can be kept. Dr. Vasey in his
report emphasizes the risk of allowing it to continue in inappropriate
quarters. He says: “If it were destroyed by fire it could never be en-
tirely replaced, and a large number of type specimens would be lost.
The collection of American grasses is the largest in existence, and con-
tains the type specimens of nearly all the species of American grasses
described during the last fifteen years.”

A new museum building should soon be provided, in which this and
several other collections, at present without proper shelter, may be ap-
propriately installed.

Department of Fossil Plants.—A series of fossil plants consisting of
about 600 specimens, representing as far as practicable the evolution-
ary development of plant life has been placed on exhibition. A series
of labels has been prepared for these specimens and printed.

The duplicate specimens of fossil plants belonging to the Museum are
stored in the Armory building, for lack of other space.

The remaining type specimens belonging to the Museum collections,
representing the earlier geological formations, have been entirely re-
arranged during the year.

Professor Ward has been engaged during the year in the preparation
of a monograph of the flora of the Laramie group.

The fine Kansas collection of Dakota group plants, purchased from
Mr. Charles Sternberg by the Geological Survey, was incorporated with
the Museum collections in 1889. This contains 400 types of the plants
of the Dakota group, which were studied by Professor Lesquereux.

Mr. Charles 8S. Prosser, of the Geological Survey, one of Professor
Ward’s assistants, has recently studied the flora of the Silurian and
Devonian formations, and has made extensive collections in various
parts of New York.

Mr. David White, of the Survey, has been engaged in the identifica-
- tion of a series of cretaceous plants collected by himself on Martha’s
Vineyard, and has also commenced the study of a collection of Car-
boniferous plants from Missouri.

Mr. F. H. Knowlton has studied a collection of fossil wood from
Arkansas; and has prepared a report, which will soon be published by
the Arkansas Geological Survey. He has also published a paper upon
the fossil wood of the Potomac formation, in which several new species
are described ; this publication also contains an elaborate review of the
literature relating to the study of internal structure, from its earliest
mention down to the close of the year 1886.
42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

During the summer of 1889 Mr. Knowlton made collections of fossil
plants in New Mexico and Arizona, discovering eight or ter localities
from which fossil plants had not been before reported. His collec-
tions include a valuable and exceedingly interesting series of Triassic
plants from the copper mines near Abiquiu. He also visited the cele-
brated fossil forest in the vicinity of Holbrook, Arizona, where several
hundreds of acres are covered by immense trunks of fossil trees. A
large collection of fossil wood was obtained in this locality. He also
made a collection of fossil wood from the fossil forest at Calistoga,
California. On his return in the fall, he commenced the selection of a
series of type specimens from collections made in previous years in the
Yellowstone National Park.

Section of Forestry.—Dr. B. B. Fernow, chief of the Division of For-
estry in the Department of Agriculture, has, as stated in the report for
1889, taken charge of the forestry collection in the Museum.

It had been expected that the material used in the exhibit prepared
by the Department of Agriculture for the World’s Exposition at Paris
in 1889 would be returned, and form a nucleus for a systematic Museum
exhibit. The bulk of the material was, however, at the request of the
director of the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris, turned over to that estab-
lishment by the representative of the Department of Agriculture.

During the year five exhibits received through the Department of
Agriculture have been installed. To the panel exhibiting the forestry
interests of the United States,and referred to in Dr. Fernow’s report
for 1889, two maps from the Census Bureau have been added. These
show the distribution of forest, prairie and plain, and of the different
forest types as described by Prof. C. S. Sargent.

The collection of the woods of the United States, which was prepared
by the Department of Agriculture for the Cincinnati Exposition, has
been arranged in four cases.

It is the wish of the curator to make a complete representation of
the arborescent flora of the United States, and also a comprehensive
exhibit of the more important timber trees, as soon as opportunity
shall be afforded.

DIVISION OF GEOLOGY.

Department of Minerals.—The appearance of the exhibition hall de.
voted to the display of minerals has been greatly improved during the
year. Prof. F. W. Clarke, honorary curator, reports that the collec-
tion has in a great measure been rearranged, and that a new installa-
tion of the gem collection has been commenced. <A special feature of
the year’s work has been the preparation of a large number of dupli-
cate collections of minerals for distribution to schools and colleges.
The distributions, which have already been made, are referred to in
the statement concerning the work of the Department of Registration
and Storage. Among the most important accessions are a large series
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 43

of minerals from Missonri and Arkansas, collected by Mr. W. P. Jenney,
and a collection of Arizona minerals, collected by Dr. W. F. Hillebrand
and transmitted by the U.S. Geological Survey. Specimens of ten me-
teorites have been received during the year, six of which were acquired
by exchange with the British Museum and the Museum of Natural His-
tory in Paris.

Department of Geology.—Mr. Merrill, curator of this department,
states that a very large portion of his time since October, 1889, has
been devoted to the assorting of collections, the preparation of labels,
and the identification of material sent to the Museum for examination
andreport. Sixty-nine lots of material have thus been named and re-
ported upon during the year. Mr. Merrill has prepared in his report
a careful synopsis of the plan which he has devised for the rearrange-
ment of the exhibition series. The number of specimens now in the
exhibition series is estimated at 16,762. The entries in the catalogue
of the Department of Metallurgy during the year were 504 in number.
In the catalogue heretofore devoted to the Department of Lithology
and Physical Geology 2,268 entries have been made.

The transmission of specimens to museums and colleges, at home and
abroad, has been actively carried on, especially in connection with the
department of minerals, a large quantity of duplicate material having
been obtained last summer by Prof. F. W. Clarke, Curator of Minerals,
especially for this purpose.

Numerous exchanges of specimens have also been completed. The
following statement, arranged geographically, contains the names of the
recipients of the material sent out, the character of the specimens, and

STORAGE.

During the year there were entered upon the temporary storage-
records of the Museum 361 boxes.

There were removed from storage and turned over to the officers of
the Museum 119 boxes, to be opened and worked into the collections of
the Museum.

LIBRARY.

Mr. John Murdoch, librarian, has furnished the following statement
concerning the operations of the library.

The total number of publications added to the library during the
year was 12,437 (1,479 volumes of more than 100 pages, 2,250 pamph-
lets, 8,672 parts of regular serials, and 36 charts). Of these, 785 vol-
umes, 1,010 pamphlets, and 6,900 parts of serials were retained for the
use of the Museum from the accessions of the Smithsonian Institution.
The remainder were obtained, as usual, by gift, exchange, and purchase.

The only notable gift to the library during the year was from the
Wagner Free Institute of Science, in Philadelphia, consisting of a
nearly complete set of Kiener’s “ Igonographie des Coquilles vivantes,”
with magnificent colored plates. The Lea collection, referred to in the
last report, has been duly entered and catalogued.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY 49

During the year 7,596 books were borrowed from the library and
4,268 returned. Ninety-two persons are now authorized under the reg-
ulations to draw books from the Museum library. Two hundred and
forty eight requests were sent to the Library of Congress during the
year. Three thousand two hundred and seventy titles have been added
to the card catalogue.

Since the last report the sectional libraries of Lithology and Metal-
lurgy have been combined, forming the section of Geology, under the
charge of Mr. G. P. Merrill, and the sectional library of Transporta-
tion and Engineering, in charge of Mr. J. E. Watkins, has been organ-
ized.

The usual inspection of the sectional libraries was made between May
1 and June 10, and the books were found to be in good condition.

The number of books assigned to these libraries is as follows:

Birds. —540 volumes, 31 pamphlets, and 177 parts of serials.

Editor, Smithscnian Institution.—601 volumes and pamphlets, 546 parts.

Hthnology.—143 volumes, 20 pamphlets, 143 parts.

Fishes.—82 volumes, 8 pamphlets, 38 parts.

Geology.—536 volumes, 308 pamphlets, 412 parts, 32 charts.

Insects.—466 volumes, 267 pamphlets, 621 parts.

Mammats.—187 vclumes, 313 pamphlets.

Marine Invertebrates.—35 volumes, 3 pamphlets, 118 charts.

Materia Medica.—235 volumes, 4 pamphlets, 269 parts.

Mesozoic Fossils.—35 volumes, 10 pamphlets, 13 parts.

Mineralogy.—A. 177 volumes, 6 pamphlets, 281 parts; B. 72 volumes. 48 pamph-
lets, 8 parts.

Mollusca and Cenozoic Fossils.—76 volumes, 13 pamphlets, 270 parts.

Oriental Archewology.—225 volumes, 94 pamphlets, 283 parts.

Plants, Recent and Fossil. —380 volumes, 204 pamphlets, 886 parts.

Prehistoric Anthropology.—t6 volumes, 17 pamphlets, 49 parts (in addition to the
Rau Memorial Library, which is not yet wholly catalogued).

Textiles and Foods.—27 volumes, 43 pamphlets, 30 parts.

Transportation and engineering.—46 volumes, 292 parts.

The books referred to in the last report as having been sent to the
Government bindery were all bound and returned to the library by
August 15, 1889.

The assignment of additional clerical assistance to the library has
enabled the librarian to dispose of a considerable portion of the ac-
cumulated arrears of cataloguing and other similar work, and it witt
soon be possible to begin the much-needed subject-catalogue.

Hight new book-cases have been built in the passage-way adjoining
the library. By filling these with classes of books less often referred
‘to, relief was obtained for the crowded cases in the library, but the lat-
ter are rapidly filling up again.

The library grows so fast that any temporarv measures like those
mentioned are of little real moment. The library needs a room large

enough to allow for the expansion, and at the same time to permit a
rational classification of the books upon the shelves.

FOREIGN EXCHANGES.

Exchanges of duplicate specimens, in continuation of the custom of
previous years, have been carried on. The domestic exchanges are
indicated in the accession list (section Vv), and the following statement
relates only to exchanges made with individuals and scientific estab-
lishments outside of the United States.

Arts and industries.—The Sapporo Agricultural College, Sapporo,
Japan, through Shosuke Sato, acting director, sent in exchange a col-
lection of Aino articles, consisting of a dried fish, wooden dipper and
spoon, fish-bowl, rice-bowl, tray, an “ikoro,” man’s coat, woman’s coat,

The Insetsu Kioku (finance department), Tokio, Japan, through Mr.
T. Tokuno, chief, sent samples of Japanese woodcuts, printing and en-
graving tools and a few samples of Japanese printing. This collection
illustrates Japanese methods of engraving. An exchange was sent in
return for these, consisting of a set of apparatus, tools, books, cata-

PUBLICATIONS.

In the report for 1889 (pp. 54-65) the history and condition of the
publications of the National Museum are fully discussed. The increase
in the publication fund, which would have made possible a more generous
distribution of the volumes of ‘* Proceedings” and the *“ Bulletin,” has
not been allowed by Congress.

To meet the numerous applications for the volumes of these publica-
tions, the following circular was printed :

CIRCULAR RELATING TO THE PUBLICATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL
MUSEUM.

The Smithsonian Institution will probably find it necessary to discontinue the repub-
lication of the Proceedings and Bulletins of the National Museum for distribution to
libraries, the cost being found too heavy a burden upon its limited publication fund.

Congress has been asked to increase the annual appropriation for the Museum pub-
lications, in order that every important library and institution of learning may be
supplied with a full seriesof those hereafter to be issued. Should Congressional ac-
tion be fayorable,a request will be made for the republication of the back volumes for
the use of the same libraries and institutions.

In the meantime the publications of the years 1883 and 1889 will be sent to a lim-
ited list of libraries, chiefly scientific, in the United States and abroad.

Bulletins No. 17 to No. 32, and Proceedings, Vols. Vv to x1, inelusive,can not be sup-
plied at present. Bulletins No. 1 to No. 16, and Proceedings, Vols. I to1v, are included
in the Smithsonian series of Miscellaneous Collections.

The number of copies of the earlier publications, printed under the authority of
the Interior Department, was very small, and a few copies placed at the disposal of
the National Museum were used for distribution to scientific societies and museums,
and to individual specialists and in exchange for collections,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 53

The applications for the Museum publications are now so numerous as to render it
impossible to continue the sending outof full volumes of uhe Proceedings or complete
series of the Bulletins to individuals.

So far as possible, each scientific correspondent of the Smithsonian Institution and
National Museum will be supplied with publications essential for his use in the field
of investigation in which heis individually engaged.

S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, Washington, D. C.

The custom of printing the Proceedings signature by signature, which
was maintained during the publication of the first eleven volumes,
has now been discontinued, for reasons given on page 58 of the last
report. Commencing with Vol. x11, a limited number of copies of
each paper is printed in advance of the bound volume, for distribution
to specialists. These are distributed as soon as received from the Gov-
ernment Printing Office. The bound volumes are now reserved for
publie libraries and other educational establishments, whose publica-
tions the Museum receives in exchange.

Reports of the National Museum.—During the year the reports of the
Museum (constituting Part 11 of the Smithsonian Report) for 1886 and
1887 have been published. The report for 1888 has been put in type,
and the manuscript prepared for the report for 1889.

The report for 1886 was issued in October, 1889, and contains xi+
842 pages. The volume contains the following special papers relating

54 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum.—The extension of the scope
of the National Museum during the past few years, and the activity of
the collectors employed in its interest, have caused a great increase in
the amount of material in its possession. Many of the objects gathered
are of a novel and important character, and serve to throw a new light
upon the study of nature and of man. The importance to science of
prompt publication of descriptions of this material led to the estab-
lishment of the present series of publication, in 1878, entitled “‘ Proceed-
ings of the United States National Museum.” Thepapersin the Proceed-
ings consist chiefly of papers prepared by the scientific corps of the
National Museum, and of papers by other investigators, founded
upon the collections in the National Museum.

Volume xi, for 1888, was issued in October, 1889. It contains 714
pages, 60 plates, and 122 text figures. The volume contains 85 papers
by 43 authors, 19 of whom are connected with the National Museum.
The papers relate to the following subjects: -

Bulletin of the U. S. National Museum.—The Bulletin of the National
Museum, the publication of which was commenced in 1875, consists of
elaborate papers, frequently monographs of groups of animals, which
for special reasons it is considered more desirable to publish separately
than as papers in the ‘ Proceedings.”

Five bulletins have been published during the year, aggregating
1,321 octavo pages of text, with 120 figures in the text and 240 plates of
illustrations.

Bulletin 34; The Batrachia of North America, by E. D. Cope, was issued
July 6, 1889. It contains 525 pages of text, with 120 text-figures and
81 plates. This work is the result of an exhaustive study of the char-
acters of the species of Batrachians of North America, with their vari-
ations, and has been rendered effective by the very full collections in
the National Museum. A thorough discussion of the osteology of the
class is presented, based on material contained in various museums in
the United States and Europe. These results are expressed largely in
systematic form, in the belief, as the author says, that descriptive zo6l-
ogy wili never be complete until the structure is exhausted in furnish-
ing definitions. Wherever practicable, reference is made to the reiations
between the extinct and living forms. Many of the manuscript descrip-
tions used by Professor Cope in the preparation of this bulletin were
written by Professor Baird and Dr. Girard many years ago, with such
a publication as the present one in view. Some of the illustrations
were drawn by Professor Baird. .

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 57

Bulletin 35; Bibliographical Catalogue of the Described Transforma-
tions of North American Lepidoptera, by Henry Edwards, was issued
August 15, 1889, and contains 147 pages. This is an important work
of reference for entomologists. The author’s intention is to issue a
yearly supplement to this list, keeping pace with the progress of cur-
rent work. The references are in chronological order under each
species.

Bulletin 36; Contributions to the Natural History of the Cetaceans, a
Review of the Family Delphinide, by Frederick W. True, was issued
August 8, 1889, and contains 191 pages and 47 plates. It was prepared
after careful research in the principal museums of Europe where the
types of Gray, Cuvier, Gervais, Schlegel, and other English, French,
and Dutch naturalists were examined and measured. Some of the
greatest hindrances to the study of the dolphins are the scarcity of ma-
terial, the ignorance of the limits of specific variation, and the incom-
pleteness of the descriptions of the species of Cetaceans.

Bulletin 37; A Preliminary Catalogue of the Shell bearing Marine Mol-
lusks and Brachiopods of the Southeastern Coast of the United States,
with illustrations of many of the species, by William Healey Dall, A.m,
was issued September 12, 1889, and contains 221 pages, with 64 plates.
This bulletin is intended to assist students of the Mollusea of the United
States, by bringing together for their use a large number of illustra-
tions of species belunging to the fauna of the southern and southeast-
ern coasts of the United States, and the adjacent waters. Hitherto
there has been no catalogue which covered the ground. The author has
attempted to steer a middle course between overdivision of large nat-
ural groups and the conservatism which confounds unlike things to-
gether. In including or omitting groups of mollusks from this cata-
logue, he has been guided by convenience, rather than by systematic
completeness.

Bulletin 38; Contribution toward a Monograph of the Insects of the
Lepidopterous Family Noctuide of Temperate North America.— Revis-
ion of the Genus Agrotis, by John B. Smith, contains 257 pages. This
was put in type during the year covered by this report, although it was
not published until after the close of the fiscal year. This bulletin is
the result of a study of the principal collections in the United States.
Efforts have hitherto been made to divide this genus, and their exists
an abundance of generic names and types, but the true characters have
apparently not been recognized, and species have been erroneously as-
sociated, so that the result has been that sooner or later the proposed
terms have gone into the synonomy, thus increasing the present con-
fusion. The author has endeavored to use, as far as possible, existing
generic terms in his division of the genus. nee

The manuscript and drawings of a bulletin relating to deep-sea fishes
of the western Atlantic Ocean were transmitted to the Public Printer
during the year, and the engraving of the illustrations was completed,
58 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

but the text has not yet been printed. This Bulletin is by Dr. G.
Brown Goode and Dr. T. H. Bean.

In a subsequent section of this report will be found a statement of
the publications of the Museum during the year, and a bibliography of
papers by officers of the Museum, and other investigators whose writ-
ings are based upon Museum material. The authors of these papers
number 103, of whom 31 are counected with the Museum, 8 being hon-
orary officers. The papers number 448, and are distributed under the
following subjects:

VISITORS.

During the year the total number of visitors to the Museum building
has been 274,324, and to the Smithsonian building 120,894. The great-
est number of visitors in the buildings in any one day was on October
9, 1889, during the Knights’ Templar Conclave, when 10,203 were reg-
istered in the Museum and 7,229 in the Smithsonian building.

The Burean of Information seems to be regarded more and more as a
convenience to strangers, who are constantly applying for information
and advice, not only in regard to the Museum, but as to other public
buildings and the Government departments in general. This bureau
has made over 30,000 connections by telephone during the year.

LECTURES AND MEETINGS OF SOCIETIES.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 61

A course of four lectures on the anthropological exhibits at the Paris
Exposition of 1889, was given by Mr. Thomas Wilson. The subjects of
his lectures were:

Tuesday, May 13.—Prehistoric Anthropology.

Friday, May 16.—Ancient Industries, Charms and Amulets.

Wednesday, May 21.—History of Human Habitations.

Friday, May 23.—Anthropological Congresses and Prehistoric Museums.

The meetings of the Biological Society of Washington have been
held during the past year at the assembly hall of the Cosmos Club,
this location being found more convenient than the National Museum.

The use of the Museum lantern has been granted on several occasions
for the purpose of illustrating lectures, both in the Museum building
and elsewhere. This was done without charge, excepting for the ac-
tual cost of the gas. The services of an assistant were also given by
the Museum free of charge.

STUDENTS.

Previous to the organization of the staff of curators in the National
Museum, it was customary to send collections to all parts of the United
States, and, in some instances, to foreign countries, to be worked up by
specialists. This system was then necessary, owing to the fact that
there were few specialists in Washington. During the last ten years
the policy of the Museum in this respect has been modified, owing to
the presence in the Museum of a trained staff among whom the collec-
tions are now usually assigned for study.

Requests are occasionally made by students for material to be used
for comparison in connection with their special studies, and such re-
quests are always granted when it can be done without detriment to the
Museum.

During the year several lots of birds’ skins have been lent to Dr. J.
A. Allen, of the American Museum of Natural History. The Museum ~
collection of bats has been placed at the disposal of Dr. Harrison Allen,
of Philadelphia, who is engaged in the preparation of a new edition of
his monograph of the bats of North America. At the request of Mr.
Ernest HE. Thompson, of Toronto, Canada, skins of birds and skins and
skulls of rodents have been sent to him for study. Dr. C. Hart Merriam,
of the Department of Agriculture, has made extensive use of the re-
serve series of North American mammals. Dr. HK. A. Mearns, of Fort
Snelling, Minnesota, has examined the collection of prairie dogs. Dr.
D. W. Prentiss, of Washington, has had occasion to make a study of
the ermine skins in the collection. Specimens of Doras dentatus and
Clarias nieuhofii were lent for study to Mr. Bashford Dean, of the Col-
lege of the City of New York. A number of Coleoptera were sent to
Capt. T. L. Casey for study. The Museum collection of Crustacea from
the Bahamas was sent to Prof. C. S. Dolley, of the University of Penn-
sylvania, for study. Twelve specimens of the ocean-bottom, collected
62 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

by the U.S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross and the U.S. 8. Dol-
phin, were sent to Rev. Albert Mann, jr., of Newark, New Jersey, for
study.

Dr. G. Baur, of Clarke University, studied the collection of North
American Cheloniaus in the Museum. Mr. James KE. Benedice has
begun the study of the collection of Bracviyura from the North Pacific
Ocean. Dr. R. W. Shufeldt was granted permission to study birds’
skeletons. The Department of Birds has granted free access to its
collections to many authors, whose works are referred to in the Bibli-
ography (section IV).

Mr. A. B. Farnham, of Benning’s, District of Columbia, is acting as
a volunteer assistant in the department of taxidermy, and Mr. Leigh
W. Reed has been doing similar work in the Department of Geology.

Mr. John BL. Daish has received instruction in photography and taxi-
dermy.

FINANCE, PROPERTY, SUPPLIES, AND ACCOUNTS.

The statements relating to these branches of the administrative work
have been prepared by Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk.

The appropriations received by the Museum for the fiscal year end-
ing June 30, 1890, are as follows: For preservation of collections,
$140,000; for furniture and fixtures, $30,009; for heating and lighting,
$12,000.

PRESERVATION OF COLLECTIONS.

Appropriation by Congress for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890,
for the preservation, exhibition, and increase of the collections from
the surveying and exploring expeditions of the Government, and from
other sources, including salaries or compensation of all necessary em-
_ployés, $140,000 (sundry civil act, March 2, 1839, public No. 154, page 16).
Out of this appropriation $118,378.99 has been expended for salaries

or compensation; $4,952.67 for supplies; $2,307.60 for stationery;

$5,141.48 for specimens; $1,307.61 for books and periodicals; $1,645.97
for travel; and $2,416.92 for freight and cartage, making a total ex-
penditure of $136,151.24 and leaving a balance of $3,848.76 on hand
July 1 to meet outstanding liabilities.

Following is a detailed statement of the salaries or compensation
paid from the appropriation for preservation of collections during the
present year.

The scientific staff consists of the Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian,
in charge U.S. National Museum, at a monthly salary of $333.33 ; three
curators at $200 each, three at $175, two at $150, one at $125, and one

1 special case around stone slab. 1 mahogany one-half unit case remodeled.

1 mahogany pier case reconstructed.

18 Liverpool cases, remodeled and com-

3 sloping cases furnished with panels.

Although the work and purchases on account of furniture and. fix-
tures have been somewhat restricted this year by the lessened appro-
priation, the plans and methods heretofore adopted have been carried
out as far as possible.

Considerable exterior work has been done. Frequent repairs have
been required in the roofs of both buildings; the north front of the
natural-history laboratory has been reconstructed ; flagging has been
laid from the main pavement to the door of the animal house, and the
window ledges of nearly the entire museum have been tinned.

In the interior many repairs and changes have been found necessary
to the building itself, as well as to the cases and other furniture.

The hall, northwest pavilion, has been wainscoted in oak, and a sec-
ond much-needed staircase has been built; self-closing, sound-deaden-
ing doors, which divide this hall from the lecture room, have been made
and putin place; raised floors have been coastructed in the office of
the engineer of property, and in the stationery room, and the wooden
flooring throughout the building has been frequently patched.

Several standard, special and sample cases have been built and many
more remodeled and extended. The floor of the large special case for
the Moose group has been reconstructed; many cases have been re-
paired, fitted with panels, shelving, racks, brackets, ete., relined, ebon-
ized, polished, glazed, furnished with doors and locks, and otherwise
completed.

More than 130 mahogany, oak, and pine frames have been made,
some of them of great size, like the frame for the allegorical tile-panel
of ‘‘ Progress” now placed over the north entrance.

Several bases and pedestals, and nearly 5,000 blocks for the display

of specimens have been made and completed; screens have been con-

structed, and more than 900 trays, and many shelves and diaphragms
have been made and fitted; several tables have been built, and over 70
wing-frames have been repaired, rehinged, and rehung..

H, Ex, 129, pt. 2——5
66 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

Several pairs of mahogany doors kave been made for cases, and the
time of the carpenters has been taken up to a considerable extent in
refitting the doors of other cases ; they havealso been required to make
a large number of boxes for the storage of specimens, and for the ship-
ment of those designed for exchanges. In fact the general miscellane-
ous work demanded of them throughout the year has been so extensive
as to consume much time, and required a great deal of labor.

Considerable metal work of various kinds has been done; cases have
been made insect proof by being lined with metal, and metal partitions
have been made for file-holders; about 40 copper and tin tanks for
alcoholic specimens have been made, and more than that number com-
pleted, besides many caus for collecting purposes; nearly 1,500 brass
and tin label-holders have been made.

In addition to the locksmith’s work required on new and reconstructed
cases, the combination locks, suited to the symbol of each department,
have been changed on many of the unit tables in the Museum. This
work has been done in great part by a fireman skilled in such matters,
at periods wheu he could be spared from his regular duties in the engine
and boiler-rooms.

HEATING, LIGHTING, ELECTRIC AND TELEPHONIC SERVICE.

Appropriation by Congress for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890,
for expenses of heating and lighting and electrical and telephonic serv-
ice for the National Museum, $12,000. (Sundry civil act, March 2, 1889,
Public No. 154, p. 16.)

Out of this appropriation $5,114.87 has been expended for salaries or
compensation; $2,058.26 for fuel; $1,113.82 for gas; $601.05 for teie-
phones; $264.49 for electrical work and supplies; $100 for rental of
call-boxes ; $269.25 for heating repairs ; $147.86 for heating and light-
ing supplies; and $3.25 for travel, making a total of expenditures to
July 1, 1890, of $9,672.85, and leaving a balance of $2,327.15 to meet
outstanding liabilities.

Following is an analysis of salaries or compensation paid from the
appropriation for heating and lighting during this year:

One engineer was employed, for part of the year only, at a salary of
$120 a month ;* five firemen at $50 each, and one at $40 a month ; one tel-
ephone clerk at $60, and one at $35 a month; $137.74 has been expended
for extra labor, making the total expenditure for services in this depart-
ment $5,114.87.

During the winter the engineer reported some of the boilers as being
in a very bad condition, the tubes which have been in use many years
being so warped, burnt, and corroded as to be liable to give out at any
time; he also named 6 pounds as the limit of steam pressure safe under
the circumstances, and suggested that the fires be kept up night and

*The death of Mr. A. A. Duly, for ten years engineer, occurred in March,

day, as the only method by which the necessary temperature could be
maintained. This suggestion was accordingly carried out. It will,
however, undoubtedly be necessary to take some action in regard to
heating repairs and changes in the near future.

In several instances it has been found advisable to change the posi-
tions of the radiators, and to make new connections. This work, and
all repairs to machinery, gas-fitting, plumbing, and the needed black-
smith’s work, have been accomplished by men employed on the regular
Museum force.

In prosecuting the general routine of Museum work, bids have been
advertised for and proposals invited, as in past years, but the list of
articles to be purchased has been shortened considerably, it having been
found that the requirements of the Museum are so varied that, except-
ing for articles of general use, it is impossible to anticipate the wants
for the entire year.

As a result of the growth and needs of the Museum, it has been found
advisable, from time to time, to reconstruct many cases of the types
purchased in earlier years, and to make an inventory of cases and fur-
niture in the Museum, based upon new standards and nomenclature.
This work, as mentioned in a former report, was begun two years since,
under the direction of Mr. J. E. Watkins, the engineer of property.

In making this inventory, every piece of furniture in the Museum has
been inspected ; the old numbers have been noted, and small brass
plates with the new numbers stamped on them have been attached to
more than 4,500 cases, bases, pedestals, stands, etc., and to the numer-
ous articles of office furniture.

Whenan articleis condemned, or, by being incorporated with another,
loses its identity, the original number is noted in the office of the engi-
neer of property, and such record made that the history of each article
can be traced at any time without difficulty.

With a view to simplifying the method of keeping account of services,
in January of this year a system of time-books was adopted, in which
the record of attendance is kept by the head of each department for
himself, and for all employés under his direction.

These books give the name and designation of each person, the rate
of compensation, furnish an accurate record of attendance in each case,
and state the cause of any absence, so far as necessary to decide
whether such is to be counted against annual leave, excused on account
of illness, or charged against the individual and deducted from the
monthly compensation.

These time- books, after being certified to by the head of each depart-
ment, are examined by the chief clerk of the Museum, and if found cor-
rect are signed by him and forwarded to the disbursing clerk, who uses
them as a basis in preparing the pay-rolls.

3 This method not only simplifies the work in taking careful note of the
attendance, but is found advantageous from the facility with which
each individual record can be referred to,

68 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

ROUTINE.

In the office of the chief clerk 1,451 orders for supplies have been sent
out during the year, over 1,000 letters have been written, 550 circular
letters and 265 proposals for supplies have been sent out, and 1,051
vouchers have been passed upon and paid.

This work, which can be set down in numbers, is but a small part of
the labor which devolves upon this office, and upon the prompt and ac-
curate accomplishment of which the efficiency of the scientific branches
of Museum work largely depends. The force, which consists of two
clerks and one copyist, are so hard pressed that it has been this year,
as usual, a question if all would be able to take more than a fraction of
the annual leave which is accorded to employés in the Museum.

CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORTS.

In the report for 1889 the work of this department was referred to
at some length in order to indicate, to those who might be interested,
the methods of administration which had been adopted in it, and the
scope of the work assigned to it. There has been no material change
in either during the year.

Mr. &. I. Geare, chief of the division of correspondence and re-
ports, has rendered important aid in this work. The clerical force of
the office has been increased, and now consists of three stenographers,
two typewriters, an index clerk, and a messenger.

During the year about 7,000 official papers have been prepared for
the signature of the Secretary and the Assistant Secretary.

The following geographical statement of letters written in reply to
requests for information upon various subjects, may be of interest as
showing the amount of correspondence of this kind carried on in differ-
ent parts of the United States and in other countries.

BUILDINGS AND LABOR—POLICE AND PUBLIC COMFORT.

The staff employed for police and protection has remained under the
charge of Henry Horan, superintendent of buildings. It consists of
watchmen, painters, carpenters, skilled laborers, laborers, cleaners, and
attendants.

The number of watchmen is usually sixteen. They are divided into
watches, by whom the Smithsonian and Museum buildings, and the
collections stored and exhibited therein, are guarded day and night.

Hight or nine carpenters are generally employed, and are kept busy
continually in constructing cases and shelves, making frames for labels,
remodeling old forms of cases, putting locks on cases, making repairs
in the buildings, ete.

The force of skilled laborers is, as a rule, nine or ten innumber. Their
time is occupied in painting blocks for the exhibition of specimens,
painting trays, easing trays, fitting shelves, adjusting panes of glass in
cases and windows, and assisting the carpenters and painters in many
ways.

There are only two painters constantiy on the Museum roll. These,
with the assistance of some of the skilled laborers, perform all the work
of this kind required in the Museum, including the repainting of walls
and ceilings of rooms, staining pedestals for groups of specimens and
cases, painting book-cases, shelving, blocks for exhibition purposes,
ete.

The force of laborers consists of about twenty-four men. They are
kept continually busy moving specimens, arranging cases, attending to
the cleaning of offices, and washing the floors in the exhibition halls.

The number of cleaners and attendants averages about eight. They
are constantly occupied in cleaning glass, dusting cases, of which there
are now more than 1,700, and sweeping. They are also expected to
answer, as far as practicable, the questions of visitors.

The telephonic and telegraphic service of the Museum is under the
supervision of the superintendent of buildings.
72 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

From the reports of the superintendent are quoted the following
statements, which will serve to show in part the character of the work
accomplished by the laboring force during the year:

1889.

July.—The steam pipes under the south hall were covered with magnesia covering.
A raised platform was put in the office of the engineer of property. One extra radi-
ator was placed in the stationery room and also in the property clerk’s office. A
raised floor was added to the stationery room. The mechanics were engaged during
the month in painting 572 blocks, easing 105 trays, painting 299 trays, making and
fitiing 34 shelves, and putting in 82 lights of glass. Besides this work, a great deal
of miscellaneous jobs, covering 49 orders, was executed.

August.—Deouble-acting base doors were hung at the entrance to the northwest
pavilion. A sewer pipe was put in the animal house. ‘The north side of the natu-
ral-history laboratory building was hricked up, and anew roof put on. The hollow
brick partition was removed from the second floor of the northwest pavilion. A
private stairway was built, leading from the first to the second floor of the Assistant
Secretary’s apartments. The mechanics were kept busy fitting 13 shelves, painting
675 blocks, easing 221 trays, altering 95 locks, and putting in 75 lichts of glass. In
addition to this, 5& miscellaneous orders were filled. f

September.—New frames, jams, etc., were made for the large doors at the west en-
trance. Two wire screens were made and put up in arches on the west balcony.
New storm doors were made and placed at the north entrance of the Smithsonian
building. The mechanics were employed in fitting 231 trays, painting and ebonizing
64 blocks, repairing and altering 117 locks, putting in 173 lights of glass. In addi-
tion to this work, 69 miscellaneous orders were filled.

October.—The mechanics were kept busy altering locks, making 259 biocks, paint-
ing 723 blocks, putting in 179 lights of glass, and glazing cases. Numerous matters
of smaller importance were attended to.

Novenber.—Radiators were put in and steam heat substituted for the stove in the
label department on the north balcony. During this month the mechanics were em-
ployed in ebonizing 146 blocks, altering and repairing 89 locks, putting in 130 lights
of glass, making keys, and easing trays. In addition to this, 33 miscellaneous matter:
were completed.

December.—Steam pipes were attached from the basement to the third floor of the
northwest pavilion, and an extra radiator putin. The mechanics were employed in
easing 233 trays, ebonizing 374 blocks, making 25 blocks, tinning 102 sills and ledges,
putting in 159 lights of glass, making keys, and repairing locks. Besides this work,

-46 miscellaneous requisitions for work were attended to.

1890.

January.—The laborers were employed in removing cases, and cleaning and scour-
ing the lecture hallfor the course of “‘Saturday lectures” given under the auspices
of the scientific societies of Washington. Gas pipes were run along the ceiling in
the northwest and southwest ranges, and fixtures attached. The north, south, east,
and west halls, aud the east-north and east-south ranges and northwest court were
lighted by electricity.

February.—A heavy sarcophagus was removed from the west hall to the rotunda.
Water and gas connections were introduced into the paint shop. ‘The casesin the
east and west halls were rearranged, necessitating the services of the greater part of
the laboring force.

March.—The floor was painted in the gentlemen’s lavatory. Nine double Liver-
pool cases were set up in the main hall of the Smithsonian building for the use of the
Department of Mollusks. The front of a Haida house was removed from the Smith-
sonian building to the Museum, and hung on apier on the south side of the west hall.

April.—A new window was construeted on the third floor of the northwest pavilion.
All locks not working by the regular master key were removed and replaced by the
standard lock. A break in one of the water-pipes of the Smithsonian building was
repaired.

May.—The trenches and basements in both buildings were whitewashed. The
windows were fitted, where necessary, with new awnings. Numerous miscellaneous
jobs were completed by the mechanics.

June.—The office room on the east side of the north gallery was cleaned and painted.
The room on the south side of the east balcony was prepared for occupation. The
water aud gas-pipes, roofs and gutters were examined and repaired. Tbe heating
apparatus, electric clocks, watch signal station, telephone batteries, etc., were
inspected. A duplex water filter was placed in the gentlemen’s public comfort room.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. to

THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS.
TAXIDERMISTS AND MODELERS.

Taxidermy.—The construction of additional groups of important spe-
cies of North American mammals has been the chief work of the year.
The largest group finished was that of the Moose, which comprises six
individuals of both sexes and of different ages. This group is some-
what larger than that of the Bison, which was completed last year, and
is, indeed, the largest group thus far exhibited. It is in most respects
quite as satisfactory as the Bison group, and perhaps more striking.
The work was planned by Mr. Hornaday, and executed by Mr. Joseph
Palmer and Mr. A. H. Forney. Three specimens of the Musk-ox were
removed from the wall-case and brought together to form a group.
They were considered sufficiently valuable to merit « more prominent
place than they had previously occupied. One of the specimens was
partially remounted.

A number of additional groups of mammals were nearly or quite
completed during the year, but have not yet been placed on exhibition.
The taxidermists mounted in all 32 mammals during the year, including
the large forms previously mentioned. In addition, 24 mammals were
skinned and 50 dry skins made up. Casts were made of certain of
the specimens received in a fresh condition, to be used as aids in mount-
ing the skins. As in former years, a large amount of miscellaneous
work, such as cleaning greasy specimens, overhauling duplicate wet
skins, repairing mounted specimens, preparing preservatives, ete., was
performed. This necessary work consumes a great deal of time, but
produces no direct effect in increasing the exhibition series.

The modeler performed various tasks for the Anthropological Depart-
ment of the Museum, such as making casts of stone implements, in-
seriptions, bas-reliefs, ete. He also made casts of a number of fishes
and of some porpoise-heads, the molds of which had been in the Museum
for some time.

At the close of the year the Museum lost the valuable services of
Mr. W. T. Hornaday, who resigned his position as Chief Taxidermist.

In April Mr. William Palmer was instructed to proceed to the Pri-
bylov Islands, Alaska, to hunt walrus for the Museum. He was still
absent at the end of the vear covered by this report.

OSTEOLOGIST.

Mr. F. A. Lucas, Osteologist, states that, as in preceding years, the
care of material already in the collections has demanded much time and
attention. Owing to insufficient room, frequent changes have been
made necessary in the arrangement of the study series.

The placing of casters on the storage bases in the osteological hall
necessitated moving the greater portion of the study series, as well as
all the smaller mounted specimens in the exhibition series.
74 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

The preparation of much needed card-catalogucs of ligamentary skele-
tons, of alcoholic birds, and embryos has been continued, and this impor-
tant work is now nearly completed, as is also the changing of jars and
renewing the alcohol in which the specimens are contained.

In addition to the osteological work summarized in the subjoined

table a series of vertebra of Rhytina has been modeled to complete a
specimen for the Museum of Comparative Zodlogy, some work done on
the synoptic series of invertebrates, and 76 specimens of vertebrate
fossils cleaned, repaired, and mounted. In addition, the skeleton of
Trish elk and cast of Phenacodus have been repaired and the east of
Dinoceras skeleton remounted.
: The skill of Mr. Scollick has been shown equally in the preparation
of vertebrate fossils and of osteological material, and during a great
portion of the year he has been the only assistant in this department of
preparatory work, although the preparation of osteological specimens,
vertebrate fossils, and invertebrates now devolves upon this depart-
ment.

The number of skulls of small mammals cleaned is omitted from the
following table, although included in the report of work for 1888~89.

Collection of domestic animals.—The work of mounting typical speci-
mens of domestic animals was begun in September, 1889. At the close
of the year covered by this report 54 specimens had been secured.

Mr. Nelson R. Wood was directed to attend the American poultry
show of January, 1890, held in New York City, for the purpose of obtaining
specimens for the Museum. As aresult of this visit many fine speci-
mens have since been contributed from various sources, including some
winners of first prizes.

By order of the Assistant Secretary tests of inks have been made for
the U. S. Geological Survey.

DRAFTSMEN.

Mr. W. H. Chandlee and Mr. W. H. Burger have continued the prepa-
ration of illustrations for the Museum reports. Among them the more
important are illustrations for papers by Prof. O.'T. Mason, on “Ar-
rows,” ‘“Skin-dressing,” ““Woman’s Knives,” “ Hafting,” “Toys and
Games.” A large number of drawings were made to accompany the
paper by Mr. Romyn Hitchcock on “The Ainos of Yezo,” and addi-
tional drawings have been made for Paymaster Thomson’s paper on
Easter Island. Jn addition a large amount of miscellaneous work has
been accomplished, including the tracing and coloring of maps, charts,
and diagrams, sketches of and for the arrangement of exhibits, topo-
eraphical drawings, redrawings, engraving and lettering of labels, and
humerous small paintings in water-color, oil, pastel, ete.

H.—ACCESSIONS.

The total number of accessions to the Museum during the year is
1,162 (22179-23340, inclusive). This gives a decrease of 185 accessions
as compared with those of 1889. It may be expected that each year
will show a smaller number than the last until an additional building
is provided by Congress. All special effort to obtain contributions has
ceased. since there is no room where the specimens can be either exhib-
ited or stored.

A tabulated statement showing the number of accessions to the
Museum each year, beginning with 1881 (the first year of occupancy of
the Museum building) is here given.

S. Fish Commission. A list of the models is given in the accession
list.

The valuable services of Mr. Richard Rathbun, as honorary curator
of Marine Invertebrates; Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, as honorary eurator
of Fishes; and Capt. J. W. Collins, as honorary curator of Naval
Architecture, have been continued through the courtesy of the Com-
missioner.

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

Through the coéperation of Maj. J. W. Powell, Director, the following
collections have been received from the officers of the Bureau:

From Rev. J. Owen Dorsey were received two models of fish-hawks
and one model of retrieving-harpoon, from the Nal-tiin-né tin-né Indi-
ans of Oregon.

A model of Wolpi, one of the Tusayan villages, Arizona, and models
of Tewa and Sechomovi, Tusayan pueblos, have been deposited in the
Museum.

From Mr. James Mooney were received a collection of baskets, moc-
casins, polishing-stones, conjuring-stones, ball-pants, scratchers, bullet-
mold, lancet, cupping-horn, etc., obtained from the Kast Cherokee Res-
ervation, North Carolina.

Through the courtesy of the Director, the Department of American
Prehistoric Pottery in the National Museum, which was established
. several years ago, has continued under the curatorship of Mr. W. H.
Holmes.

J.—EXPLORATIONS.

By an act of Congress,* provision was made to defray the expense of
sending a scientific expedition to the west coast of Africa for the pur-
pose of cbserving the total eclipse of the sun, occurring on December
22, 1889. In accordance with the recommendations of a board ap-
pointed by the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation to devise plans, etce.,
the detaiis of the expedition were arranged.

" Passed March 2, 1889.
102 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.’

Through the courtesy of Prof. David P. Todd, of Amherst College,
Massachusetts, in charge of the expedition, arrangements were made
whereby Mr. William Harvey Brown, of the National Museum, was
detailed to accompany the expedition in the interest of the Museum,
for the purpose of making collections of natural history objects, espe-
cially fishes and mammals.

The expedition party sailed on October 16, 1889, on the United States
steamer Pensacola. The steamer served as headquarters for Mr. Brown
and his party, and in making the collections he has been very gener-
ously assisted by the officers and seamen.

At the Azores, Mr. Brown made a small collection of fishes and shells.
Writing from Cape Town on February 3, 1890, he says:

We have succeeded in filling 15 tanks and a number of jars and bottles with alco-
holics, besides collecting a large number of plants and insects, some skeletons, and
some excellent anthropological material. The ungulates of South Africa are rapidly

disappearing before the advance of civilization ; some are already scarce. If we want
a good representation of these in our Museum, now is the time to get them.

Several important collections were received in June, 1890.

From preliminary reports prepared by some of the curators in the
Museum the following preliminary statement has been compiled :

ETHNOLOGY.—The Department of Ethnology received a collection of
objects, consisting of an idol used in fetish-dance, with grass-fringe dress ;
gaming-stool, with seeds used in playing; carrying or fishing-basket
of twined open work; long carrying-basket or frame, showing work of
weaving; finer specimen of carrying-basket; complete outfit of pro-
fessional carrier, head-band and staff; fruit-wallet; throwing-elub ;
hoe (of native manufacture); bottle of fetish-paint, made of rawhide ;
pad worn on the arm; musical instrument with gourd resonator; mus-
ical instrument (stringed); drum used in fetish ceremonies; weaving
outfit, distaff, spindle, cotton-ginning sticks, loom complete with speci-
mens half done; pipe of clay; three pottery dishes; fish-fyke, and fish-
spear. All of these objects are new and very acceptable.

MAMMALS.—The mammals collected by the Eclipse Expediticn are 33
in number and represent 16 species. With the exception of 7 speci-
mens all were collected at Cunga, on the Coanza River, in Angola.
Only two of the species, the Black Rat (Mus rattus) and the Bonte-bok
(Alcelaphus pygargus), were previously represented in the National
Museum, and the collection, though small, is of considerable interest.

The following is a list of the mammals received :

Carnivores.
Genetta pardina Geoff. Pardine Genet. Male, adult. Cunga.
Antelopes.

Tragelaphus gratus Sclater. Bush Buck.
Male, Cunga, December 28, 1889. (18793.)
Female, Cunga, December 27, 1889. (18794.)
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 103

Two excellent skins of this fine antelope were collected by the expedi-
tion. The white preocular band is not strongly marked in the male and
itis absent inthe female. The typeof the species was from the Gaboon.

Tragelaphus sylvaticus (Sparrm.) Bush Buck.

Horns of a male. From South Africa. Presented by Mr. Frye. (18823.)

Male, adult, Cunga, Dec. 25, 1889. (18797.)

The type of this species is from Sierra Leone. It is not included by
M. Barboza du Bocage among the mammals of Angola, and its discovery
in this region is therefore of interest.

Scotophilus borbonicus (Geoff. ).
Female, adult, Cunga, Dec. 25, 1889. (18798.)
Nyctinomus limbatus (Peters).

Three adult females from Cunga, Dec. 25, 1889. (18799-18801.)

Atherura africana Gray. African Brush-tailed Porcupine.
Almina, Ashantee, Nov. 27, 1889. (18819.)

REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS.—The Department of Reptiles and
Batrachians has received a number of specimens from the naturalists
attached to the expedition. Some of them were not in a satisfactory
state of preservation, and from the fact that the collection was made
under unfavorable circumstances, in localities already more or less ex-
plored, it could hardly be expected to contain many new species.

FisHEes.—The Department of Fishes received a large collection, a list
of the genera of which, together with the locality, is given below.

INSECTS.—The Department of Insects received a collection from
southern and western Africa. It arrived in very good condition, the
lepidoptera packed in papers, and the remainder of the material in
alcohol. The collection comprised some 250 species, most of them
represented in fair series and representing the different orders in the
following proportions:

Lepidoptera (40 species). Hymenoptera (25 species).
Coleoptera (74 species). Diptera (7 species).
Orthoptera (46 species). Myriapoda (10 species).
Pseudoneuroptera (10 species). Arachnida (12 species).

Hemiptera (19 species).

The Museum collections are poor in the fauna of this region, and
nearly all the species were heretofore unrepresented. The Hymenop-
tera have been sent to Mr. W. F. Kirby, of the British Museum; the
Orthoptera to M. Henri de Saussure, of Geneva, Switzerland; the He-
miptera to M. A. Montandon, of Bucharest, Roumania, and most of the
Coleoptera to Dr. David Sharp, of Dartford, England. The majority of
the Lepidoptera were determined in Washington, thanks to Mr. Roland
Trimen’s recent monographs of South African Lepidoptera. The re-
mainder of the Lepideptera have been sent to Rev. W. J. Holland, of
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Myriapoda are in the hands of Prof.
L. M. Underwood, of Syracuse, New York; the Arachnida have been
referred to Dr. George Marx, of Washington, and the few Diptera have
not yet been disposed of.

The following statement has reference to the Lepidoptera and Cole-
optera, and three species of Hemiptera, which have been determined
in Washington:

GEOLOGY.—The Department of Geology received a specimen of chal-
copyrite from Ascension Island; one specimen of shell limestone from
the Barbadoes, and several pieces of lava from Porto Grande and
Horta, Fayal Island, Azores. So far as can be determined by simple
microscopic examination, these rocks are ordinary basalts. A study of
thin sections with a microscope might lead to different conclusions, but
these can not be well prepared at present, owing to the unusual press-
ure in other directions. This work will. however, be undertaken at
some future time.

The Department of Marine Invertebrates received a collection of
crustaceans, echinoderms, worms, bryozoans, sponges, actinians, and
nullipore corals, from Azores and Cape Verde Islands.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 1

The Department of Comparative Anatomy received a few specimens
of alcoholic birds for skeletons.

The Department of Birds received a collection of dry and alcoholic
birds, a report upon which will be furnished hereafter.

A collection was received by the Department of Botany, a report
upon which will be furnished by the curator as soon as practicable.

On April 10, 1890, Mr. Brown accompanied an exploring expedition
sent by the British South African Exploration Company, with a view to
opening up the country for settlement, to Matabela and Mashona lands,
about 2,000 miles from Cape Town, and near the Zambesi River. The
expedition consisted of two hundred white men and four hundred
negroes. Excellent facilities for collecting were furnished by Mr. John-
son, the director of the expedition, who also kindly offered to send
specimens of natural history intended for the National Museum free of
charge to Kimberly, by the company’s ox teams. The Government
railway has also offered to carry collections free from Kimberly to Cape
Town. Mr. Linley, ofthe South African branch of the New York Equitable
Assurance Association in Cape Town, kindly volunteered to attend to
the interests of the National Museum in Cape Town, and arrangements
have been made with the taxidermist of the South African Museum in
Cape Town to repack the specimens for shipment to the United States.

Incidentally the Museum has received, through Mr. Brown, several
collections of African material from private individuals. Rev. G. H.R.
Fisk presented an excellent series of living tortoises and some chame-
leons. Mr. J. H. Brady contributed a series of South African coleop-
tera. Mr. P. McOwan, director of the Botanical Garden at Cape Town,
sent to the Museum bulbs of Arctopus echinatus, capsules of Unaria pro-
cumbens, Unarit Burchellii, and Rogena longiflora. Mr. Frye, of Cape
Town, presented, through Prof. Cleveland Abbe, a collection of natural
history specimens, including a series of antelope horns. ‘The superin-
tendent of the Kimberly Diamond Mines presented to the Smithsonian

Institution some specimens of the rocks in the gold mines, Dr. C. H.
White, of the United States steamer Pensacola, collected insects for the
Museum at Cape Ledo. Offers to exchange birds and mammals were
also proposed.

Reference was made in the report for 1889* to the valuable collections
obtained in Morocco for the National Museum by Mr. Talcott Williams,
and a preliminary report upon the work which he accomplished was
published in the same place. It was hoped that it would be possible to
publish in this report a full statement of what has been accomplished.
This can not be done until the specimens have been unpacked and dis-
tributed in the Museum and a list made of them. Unfortunately Mr.
Williams has not yet been able to attend to this.

letters received from Mr. Williams since the report for 1889 went to
press:

Five sheets of a Berber manuscript were purchased. These manu-
scripts are very rare. Neither the Madrid Royal Library nor the Brit-
ish Museum owns one, and the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris has only
two. These sheets are portions of one of a number of translations of
Moslem law into the Berber, made probably in the thirteenth century.
During the Arab. renaissance, which attended the founding of the
Sherifian dynasties, these Berber books were destroyed, on the ground
that the law could be written only in Arabic.

The botanical collection consists of about 300 plants, all of which, ex-
cept 4 or 5, are phenagamous. Mr. Williams made no effort to identify
the species, but has expressed his willingness, after this has been done
and the results published, to contribute a paper indicating their distri-
bution and the changes observed in the fauna of the region while pass-
ing from one elevation or one formation to another. Fossils were ob-
tained at Azigen, near Wazan, a place whose geological horizon has not
before been determined ; concretions from Fez from the only formation
near the place; fossils from encrinal limestone at Volubilis, confirming
previous conclusions; and a number of recent fossil shells from Wady
Ghifra, near Azila, extending the area of the quaternary formation
already observed near Tangier. These fossils add nothing particularly
new to the observations already made by Mourlon, Maw, and Velain, but,
since so few fossils have been found in Morocco, these will be valuable.

A valuable collection of ethnographical material was gathered in
Morocco. Mr. Williams states that for $100 he can have delivered in.
Washington the complete household equipment of a city and village
family.

The costume of a city woman of Fez, a villagers costume, and also the
costume of a man and woman of the mountain, representing both the
Berber and mountain villagers, were obtained. The city male and
female costumes of Tangier are already in the Museum. ‘The male cos-
tume in Fez and Tangier is similar, but the female costume differs in
many ways. The Jewish costume of northern Morocco is one of the
most elaborate in the world. It is a most interesting survival and rap-
idly growing rare. The complete costume, with its heavy embroidery,
costs $250. This estimate allows for paste jewelry in the costume.

Northern Morocco is inhabited by four, if not five, races—the Moor
proper, often of primitive Arab, Berber, or Spanish descent; the Arab,
either wandering or sedentary in villages and cities; the Berber, or
Riff, in villages, in colonies in the cities, and in some cases, as at Tan-
gier and Tetuan, intermingled with the urban population; and the Jew,
for the most part Spanish, inhabiting a separate quarter in each city.

The pottery collection was made with the special design to include
all the wares in ordinary use between Tetuan and Fez. The pottery of
Spain and Morocco are closely related, and Spanish patterns are still
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 113

in use at Fez. Between Spain and Persia are located about a score of
pottery centers, which show the steps of development from the old
Spanish and Moorish patterns.

Mr. Williams suggests the wisdom of beginning at once a collection
of local folk pottery, the varieties of which are fast becoming extinct,
owing to the introduction of machinery-made wares. It would proba-
bly cost from $1,000 to $1,200 to obtain a complete representation of
local pottery all over the Mediterranean region. The country lying
between Persia and Burmah represents another pottery basin. No
European museum has endeavored to make a collection of local folk
pottery now in use in these countries save one or two in Germany, and,
while such a collection would cost but a small sum now, it will soon
become impossible to acquire one at any price. Mr. Williams suggests
the following places from which to purchase: Granada, Valencia, Bar-
celona, Catalonia, two points in Sicily, Rhodes, Dardanelles, Damietta,
Upper Nile, Brusa, Damascus, Aleppo or Oorfa, Diarbekir, Bagdad,
Erzeroum, Tabreez, Ispahan, Shiraz, and some inland points in Algeria,
Sfax, Tunis, Tripoli, and Benghazi. The collection should be made
under careful direction, so as to procure pieces of like use, but of differ-
ent pattern.

Twenty-four musical instruments were secured, among them six vari-
eties of the gimbrede, two oods, a rabab, a canoon, three varieties of
the shebab, two ghitas, a zemmar, a lira, four varieties of drum, two
varieties of castanets, and some whistles. Photographs illustrating
the manner of playing these instruments were also obtained. Mr,
Williams has kindly offered to prepare a short paper, giving the name
and parts of each instrument, its habitat and manner of playing, its
compass, aad a comparison between it and other oriental instruments.

Articles illustrating light, fire, and the industry of comb-making and
numerous household utensils were secured.

It may be safely asserted that this collection, taken as a whole, is one
of the most interesting of its kind that the Museum has ever received,
and the sincere thanks of the Smithsonian Institution are due to Mr.
Williams for the energetic and intelligent manner in which he has ac-

complished his mission.

Dr. W. H. Rush, of the nautical ccheal ship Saratoga, has consented
to collect mollusks and other marine invertebrates during his expedition
to the Azores, Madeira, and the English Channel. Two dredges, courte-
ously lent by Col. Marshall McDonald, U. 8S. Commissioner of Fish-
eries, have been placed in his hands to aid him in his work of collecting
for the National Museum. The attention of Dr. Rush has been espe-
cially called to the desirability of obtaining sea-urchins, star-fishes, coral,
and crustaceans.

Mr. J. B. Iddings, of the U. 8. Geological Survey, has expressed his
willingness to bear in mind the interests of the National Museum, as

H. Mis. 129, pt. 2 8

114 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

far as geological material is concerned, during his visit to Vesuvius,
Lipari, Stromboli, Etna, and other interesting localities.

Mr. E. M. Aaron, Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Ameri-
ican Entomological Society, has, through Prof. C. V. Riley, announced
his intention to visit Jamaica, and perhaps Vera Cruz, for the purpose
of making collections of insects. In a letter to Professor Riley in ref-
erence to his plans, he expresses the general hope that he may be able
to present to the National Museum a part of his collections. It was
not possible to offer Mr. Aaron a commission to collect for the Museum.
He has, however, been informed that biologic material in any orders
where the life history of each species is represented, will be acceptable,
as well as any good specimens of species of the families Coccide, Psyl-
lide, and Aleurodide, and of all families of parasitic Hymenoptera.

Mr. C. BR. Orcutt, of San Diego, California, who since 1880 has
presented to the National Museum about thirty collections, including
specimens of reptiles, mammals, insects, mollusks, birds, fossils, and
ethnological objects, has been furnished with copper-tanks, jars, and
alcohol to be used in preserving specimens which he may collect during
his expedition to the Colorado desert and the Gulf of California, for
which regions he started on January 1, 1890, with the expectation of
spending four months in collecting specimens.

Mr. A. J. Miller, of Evansville, Indiana, who in a letter dated July
8, 1889 states that he has discovered a buried city in Honduras, has
invited the Smithsonian Institution to join with him in carrying on the
work of exploration and excavation. It was not possible to furnish
the desired sum of money. Mr. Miller was informed, however, that
the National Museum would be glad to purchase from the antiquities
obtained from the ruins such objects as might be deemed desirable for
addition to the collections.

Mr. Henry W. Elliott, for many years connected with the Alaska
Commercial Company, has offered to collect specimens of fur-seal, fishes,
and marine invertebrates during his visit this summer to the Seal-
Islands of Alaska upon business connected with the United States Gov-
ernment. His offer has been accepted. Mr. Elliott left for Alaska on
April 24. Through the courtesy of the Secretary of the Treasury,
arrangements have been made for shipping a supply of alcohol to the
Seal Islands for Mr. Elliott’s use in preserving specimens. Mr. William
Palmer, of the National Museum, has been detailed to accompany Mr.
Elliott. In the next report will be published a list of specimens ob-
tained by Messrs. Elliott and Palmer.

COLLECTOR’S OUTFITS.

With a view to facilitating the work of those who have expressed
their willingness to collect specimens for the Museum, as well as those
who have been sent out as collectors by the Museum, outfits of appara-
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 115

tus, tanks, alcohol, etc., have been furnished. During the year 1889-90
the following collectors have been supplied :

1389.

October 1.—Mr. William Harvey Brown, of the National Museum,
who was appointed naturalist on the United States Eclipse Expedition
to South Africa, was supplied with a large outfit, including tanks, al-
cohol, jars, oil, linen, tools, guns and ammunition, to be used in collect-
ing natural history specimens. Several collections of fishes, shells, and
marine invertebrates from the Azores have been received.

November 12.—Mr. Frank Burns, of the U. 8. Geological Survey,
kindly offered to collect shells and birds in Florida. An outfit has
been sent to him, including tanks, alcohol, and shellac. One wood-
pecker, 8 specimens of shells from Chattahoochee Station, and 21 shells
from the Kitchen midden at Alum Bluffs have been received.

December 17.—Mr. John C. Tolman, collector of customs at Kadiak,
Alaska, has expressed his willingness to collect birds, shells, and plants
in that vicinity for the National Museum. He has been supplied with
cotton, dissecting-tools, ete. Unfortunately, however, owing to _ ill-
_ health, he has been compelled to defer his work. He has, therefore,
placed the outfit in the hands of Mr. W. J. Fisher, who has been for
many years a generous collector for the Smithsonian Institution. Mr.
Fisher has been requested to collect ethnological specimens, and to
endeavor to complete, as far as possible, our collections of the fauna
and flora of Alaska. Mr. Tolman intends, however, to send a collec-
tion of bird’s skins.

December 27.—Dr. John I. Northrop, of Columbia College, New York,
who sailed in January for the Bahama Islands, has kindly offered to
present a duplicate series of specimens of marine invertebrates and
fishes from the Bahamas to the Smithsonian Institution. An outfit,
including tanks and tags, has been sent to him. He expects to collect
Star-fishes. sea-cucumbers, small corals, and shore species of fishes.

1890.

January 6.—Mr. C. R. Orcutt, of San Diego, California, having
arranged for an expedition to the Colorado River and the Gulf of Cali-
fornia, kindly offered to collect shells, fishes, reptiles, and plants from
that region. An outfit, consisting of tanks, tank-boxes, alcohol, butter-
jars, padlocks, and a small seine, was sent to him at Yuma, Arizona.
On September 23, 3 cans, containing 31 specimens of reptiles, snakes,
and lizards, were received from him. Mr. Orcutt has already donated
26 collections to the National Museum.

January 7.—Rev. F. Gardiner, jr., who sailed from Newport News,
Virginia, for the West Indies, in February, was supplied with tanks,
tank-boxes, alcohol, tin-tags, etc., for the purpose of collecting natural-
history specimens. Two tank-boxes, containing alcoholic specimens of
fishes, have already been received.
116 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

January 25.—An outfit, including tanks, tank-boxes, alcohol, etc.,
has been forwarded to Mr. J. Francis Le Baron, Superintendent of the
Nicaragua Canal Construction Company, at San Juan del Norte, Nica-
ragua, for the collection of reptiles and insects. Several bottles of
alcoholic specimens, principally snakes and insects collected in Nicara-
gua and Costa Rica, have been received. Mr. Le Baron has for more
than twenty years taken a great interest in the welfare of the National
Museum, having since 1867 been a contributor to the collections from
the New England States and Florida. Since the transmission of the
outfit, the Museum has been informed that Mr. Le Baron has severed
his connection with the company. His outfit has been turned ever to
Mr. Menocal, who has kindly consented to carry on the work of collect-
ing specimens.

February 14.—Mr. C. H. Eigenmann, of San Diego, California, con-
templating a journey to Wood’s Holl, offered to spend two or three
weeks in collecting natural history specimens between Yuma and St.
Louis, along the Texas Pacific and Iron Mountain routes, and on his re-
turn between New Orleans, Houston, San Antonio, and Northeastern
Mexico. A collecting outfit was forwarded to him. A tank has been
received from him containing alcoholic specimens of fishes, mollusks,
crabs, and shrimps.

March 13.—Mr. Henry D. Woolfe, who went to Point Barrow, Alaska,
in the employment of the Pacific Steam Whaling Company, has kindly
offered to continue to collect birds’ skins, insects, fossils, mammals,
minerals, fishes, and ethnological specimens. An outfit has been for-
warded to him, in care of the Pacific Steam Whaling Company, in San
Francisco. He has already made large collections for the National
Museum.

April 24.—Dr. William H. Rush, of the United States Naval Hospi-
tal, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who accompanied the school ship Sar-
atoga on its recent trip to the Azores and the English coast, has offered
to make a collection of fishes for the National Museum. For this pur-
pose dredging-nets have been sent to him. ;

April 25.—The collecting outfit which had been placed at the disposal
of Ensigu W. L. Howard, has been transferred to Mr. Henry W. Elliott,
to be used for the preservation of the smaller specimens obtained dur- ©
ing his visit to Alaska. . Mr. Elliott was also supplied with a large
outfit, including cotton-batting, alum, arsenic, etc. Twenty-two pack-
ages of specimens have been received, but have not yet been examined.

REPORTS OF THE CURATORS OF THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM
UPON THE PROGRESS OF WORK DURING THE FISCAL
YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1890.

117
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

By Otis T. Mason, Curator.

The first three months of the fiscal year were spent in studying
anthropological collections in Europe, and especially at the Paris
Exposition, during the sessions of the Tenth International Congress of
Anthropology and Prehistoric Archeology.

In the British Museum a large amount of new space has been added
to the Department of Ethnology by the removal of the Natural His-
tory Department to South Kensington. The method of installation
is ethnographic, or, more properly, topographic. It is not possible
here to enlarge upon the richness of this material. The method of
cataloguing is worthy of imitation. Each specimen is accompanied
by a large-sized catalogue card, which bears, in addition to ample de-
scription and identification, a good drawing. Mr. C. H. Reede, the
assistant keeper, is preparing a new edition of ‘‘ Notes and Queries for
Anthropological Observers,” to be published by the British Association
for the Advancement of Science. This little manual is put into the
hands of travelers, missionaries, and government officials who journey
in foreign parts. The first edition elicited much material and informa-
tion for the British museums. My stay at the College of Surgeons
was brief. The removal of Professor Flower to South Kensington
and the absence of Dr. Garson from the city deprived me here
of that intelligent guidance which reveals the genius of a museum.
At South Kensington, as is well known, the arrangement of material
is topical in its primary concept, the whole being officially connected
with the English system of technical instruction. As soon as an idea,
a series of objects belonging to a class or to a country, or to both, is
sufficiently worked out, the material is placed on exhibition in excellent
shape, and a hand-book catalogue is prepared. This system is worthy
of imitation, and many of its features already appear in the U.S.
National Museum.

The unit system of interchangeable tablets, trays, boxes, sliding
drawers, and screens is the perfection of installation. In carrying out
its plan the Kensingston Museum does not scruple to use copies and pic-
tures of type forms which are not procurable, and large series of elec-

trotype and other reproductions are furnished to other establishments.
I had the great pleasure of examining the art work of prize scholars in
the public schools of Great Britain, set up in a large gallery at Ken-
Sington. I must not neglect to mention the India Museum, which is
very near to the South Kensington, containing the spoils of the Orient.
My visit to this charming place was made very instructive and delight-
ful by the courtesy of the keeper, Mr. C. Purdon Clarke. Ina collection
devoted to a single region, the national as well as the ethnic idea is
sufficiently prominent, prima facie. The keeper, therefore, has only
the notion of effect to study. In the India Museum it is found most
convenient to arrange by material and style of treatment; and the
visitor, therefore, especially the expert and the specialist, may study
jade or metal or textile without embarrassment or distraction. ‘The
plan of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York is somewhat sim-
ilar to that of this great collection.

The Tower of London is now a great museum devoted to the custody
of the crown jewels and of an unparalleled collection of armor and small
arms. In this place, as in many other European galleries, the history
of the building adds dignity and interest to the material. But in the
construction and furnishing of new establishments little will be found
here to imitate. The illumination, stairways, convenience of floor
space, cases, and fixtures are allas bad as they could well be for pur-
poses of exhibition.

The Anthropological Institute holds its sessions in the building of
the Zodlogical Society, but the month of August found the members all
scattered, so that the curator had small opportunity for studying the
practical methods of the society.

During my stay in London I paid several visits to Prof. A. H. Keane,
for the purpose of inspecting his summary of ethnology. Such a syn-
opsis is most desirable, and I am extremely anxious to see Professor
Keane’s work in print.

It was my pleasure to spend a day in the anthropological portion of
the Oxford Museum. A galleried annex to the natural history build-
ing has been fitted up for the reception of the Lane-Fox collection. In
this museum can be seen the best example of a topical arrangement, the
purpose being in each alcove or range to show how the inventive genius
of man may have passed from one stepping-stone to another in every
type of tool, or weapon, or art-production.

Three motives impelled the curator to visit Paris in the month of
August; namely, the Exposition, the Congresses, and the resources of
anthropological study of permanent value there. The science of an-
thropology is well organized in Paris, both as regards resources, such as
museums, laboratories, libraries, journals, instrument factories, and pub-
lishing-houses, and as regards men and organizations. The museums
represent the whole science of man’s natural history, to wit:
DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY. Td

Musée St. Germain, devoted to the palolithic, neolithic, bronze, and
early Christian period of France down to the tenth century.

Musée Cluny, devoted to Medieval France.

Musée du Trocadéro, devoted to the races of men and their arts. It
is the ethnographic museum of Paris, corresponding to the British
Museum, and that of Copenhagen.

Musée Carnavalet, devoted to the history of Paris.

Musée Guimet, devoted to the history of religion.

Musée du Louvre, devoted to classic art and archeology, painting, °
ceramics, metallurgy, and art decorations in precious materials.

Musée d'Artillerie, arms and armor.

Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers, repository of all that relates to
machinery and human industry.

Conservatoire de Musique, in which the musical apparatus of the
world is displayed.

The Jardin des Plantes, presided over by M. de Quatrefages, the
Nestor of French scientists, affords the best opportunity of studying the
comparative anatomy of man and his relations to geological history.
Here are to be seen celebrated crania, the Naulette jaw, and skeletons
of the extinct mammals found associated with human remains, and all
that concerns human technique in vegetal substances. The result of
the work of M. Gaudry among the Tertiary mammals is here displayed.

In a separate building in the Latin quarter are the Musée Broca, the
Laboratoire d’ Anthropologie, the Ecole d’Anthropologie, and the Société

-@Anthropologie. The first three constitute the Institut d’Anthropo-
logie. (La Société, Ecole et le Laboratoire d’Anthropologie de Paris
a ’ Exposition Universelle de 1889, Paris—Imprim. Réunies.)

The vast collections of literature amassed by Broca, by the Société
d@ Anthropologie and in connection with the Institut @ Anthropologie, are
united in a single library of great value in the hall of the Société @’An-
thropologie. In all the museums above enumerated are excellent libra-
ries of books and portfolios, and guide-books germane to their respect-
ive collections.* There is no better place to study the entire body of
literature relating to the natural history of man than in the Bibliotheque
Nationale. The publishing-houses of Masson pour forth a constant
stream of new books upon the same subject, and even upon the bridges
of Paris one may provide himself, at moderate cost, with an excellent
collection of rare and useful books relating to man.

The Exposition and the Congresses may be mentioned in conjunction.
A detailed statement in regard to them will be deferred until after the
account of the perpetual resources of Paris, because to the eye of the

anthropologist the whole Exposition seemed to have been arranged for
his special pleasure and profit.

There is no doubt that the institutions of Paris above described, and
the men most concerned in them, had a commanding influence in shap-
ing and arranging much of the great Exposition. Owing to this living
connection between men and things, the glory of the French Exposition,
which elevated it above its predecessors, consisted largely in its Con-
gresses, one hundred and twenty of which were held between May and
October. Every one of them was, to the writer’s mind, intensely anthro-
pological, relating to the history and the natural history of invention.
But, omitting all of those that were especially practical, there was a
series which covered the whole ground of the science of man, his embry-
ology, anatomy, anthropometry, physiology, psycho-physies, psychol-
ogy, language, race, primitive art, institutions, customs, laws, philos-
ophy, conduct, religion, and distribution in time and place, as the fol-
lowing titles will show:

June 24-29.—Protection of Works of Art and of Monuments.

August 4-11.—Hygiene and Demography.

August 5-11.—Physiological Psychology.

August 8-15.—French Association for the Advancement of Science.

August 10-17.—Crimina} Anthropology.

August 19-26.—Anthropology and Prehistoric Archeology, Ethnography, Popular
Traditions.

At least one year before the 1st of September, 1889, the executive com-
mittee of the Congrés International d’Anthropologie et d’Archéologie
Préhistorique sent circulars to anthropologists inviting them to attend
the session in Paris and begging their codperation. In the spring of
1889 the committee of the Exposition on Congresses assigned the days
and places of meeting for each, chiefly in the rooms of the university and
colleges in the Latin quarter, because the regular lectures would be in-
termitting during the vacation.

The committee of the Congress of Anthropology was then able to
send out a definite programme. The plan of procedure, after the usual
routine of organization, was to hold sessions in the University, and then
adjourn each day to one of the celebrated collections of the city or to
one of the anthropological sections of the great Exposition under the
guidance of some one perfectly familiar with the material.

The questions discussed in the Congress were the following:

(1) Erosion and filling of valleys and filling of caverns, both in their
relation to the antiquity of man.

(2) Periodicity of glacial phenomena.

(3) Arts and industries in the caverns and in the alluvium. Value
of paleontological and archeological classifications applied to the qua-
ternary epoch.

(4) Chronological relations between the ages of stone, bronze, and
iron.
DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY. 123

(5) Relations between the civilizations of Hallstadt and other stations
in Daubes and those of Mycene, Tirhyns, Issarlik, and the Caucasus.

(6) Critical examination of crania and other human bones alleged
to have been found in the quaternary during the-last fifteen years.
Ethnic elements peculiar to the different ages of stone, bronze, and
iron in central and western Europe.

(7) Ethnographic survivals which throw light upon the social con-
dition of primitive populations in central and western Europe.

(8) How far do archzologic or ethnographic analogies authorize the
hypothesis of prehistoric consanguinity or of migrations?

The thoroughness of this work may be imagined from the following
list of guides and lecturers : ;

Jardin des Plantes, MM. Quatrefages, Gaudry, and Hamy; Palais
de Justice, M. Alphonse Bertillon; Laboratoire d’Anthropologie, MM.
Manouvrier and Chudzinski; Musée St. Germain, MM. Bertrand Mor-
tillet, Reinach; Chellian Collection, M. @’Acy: Collections in the Ex-
position, MM. Topirard, Cartailhac, Piette, Valdemar Schmidt, Marquis
de Nadaillac.

Besides the anthropological exhibits in the Palais de l’ Industrie, much
material relating toour special subject was to be seen in the colonial and
foreign pavilions, such as those of Finland, Mexico, Ecuador, Nicaragua,
Venezuela, Colombia, Hawaii, Portugal, New Guinea, Transvaal, Al-
geria, Tunis, Anam and Tonkin, French India, Tahiti and French
Oceanica, New Caledonia, Guiana, Senegal, Gabon, Congo, Guadeloupe
(Guesde), Cambodia, Cochin China, and Java.

A portion of the space near the Invalides was set apart for the exhi-
bition of African and Franco-Indian natives at their characteristic oc-
cupations, chief among the popular attractions of which were the Jav-
anese theater and the Annamite Buddhist temple. The members of

_ the Congress, guided by the local committee, spent many hours in these

savage inclosures and houses, studying the people and their arts, and
listening to their rude music.

Under such favorable auspices met the Ninth Congress of Anthro-
pology and Prehistoric Archeology. It will be long before such won.
derful advantages are again brought together for studying the natural
history of man.

The previous congresses have been as follows:

1. Neufchatel, 1866. 6. Brussels, 1872.
2. Paris, 1867. 7. Stockholm, 1874.
3. Norwich, 1868. 8. Buda Pesth, 1876.
4. Copenhagen, 1869. 9. Lisbon, 1880.

5. Bologna, 1871.

From Paris my journey was to Cologne, where T visited the museum.
I was greatly impressed in all German and French cities and towns

- with the care taken of the local museums. This spirit should be fostered

in every way in our own country.

124 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

' At Leipzig I experienced the greatest disappointment in not being
able to inspect the Museum fiir Vélkerkunde, which contains the cel-
ebrated Klemm collection. More than 20 years ago the writer became
acquainted with Dr. Klemm’s methods and motives, and presented a
résumé of his work in the Smithsonian Annual Report for 1869. Shortly,
the Leipzig collection will be installed in the new building. The dis-
appointment of not seeing the Klemm collection was quite compen-
sated for in the profitable study of the K6nigliches Zoologisches and
Anthropologisch-Ethnographisches Museum in Dresden. This is not
the largest, but it is one of the best administered museums in the world.
The steel case has been adopted, the arrangement of material is topical,
and the labelling is excellent. Worthy of the highest praise is the
series of little maps which accompany the specimens. The continental
areas are denoted by colors, and the location of each species is indicated
by a colored spot or line on the map. The monographs published
by the Museum, under the title ‘‘Publicationen aus. dem K6niglichen
ethnographischen Museum zu Dresden,” are of the greatest value. Dr.
Meyer greatly prefers the photolithograph to the old-fashioned colored
plates, because the latter are not truthful. The size of these mono-
graphs is too large, however, because it is inconvenient to file them
with other works of the same class. In Dresden the curator saw the
“human beast of burden” illustrated to perfection by woman. She
oceurs in two roles, as the pack-animal and as the draft-animal. In
the former she wears a hamper holding about a bushel, which is flat
on the side next to her back. Two shoulder-straps pass from the upper
margin down in front of her shoulders and backward under two of the
frame-sticks of the basket, projecting an inch or two below the bottom.
The basket is carried like a knapsack. In the latter role she is hitched
to a little wagon in company with dogs. I counted five hundred of
these composite teams in a single morning in Dresden. The woman
seems to have the harder share of the work, for she has to pull, to hold
back, to steer the wagon, to dispose of the merchandise, and to attend
to household cares, while the dog sleeps.

In Dresden I had a profitable interview with Mrs. Zelia Nuttall, a
lady deeply learned in ancient Mexico. Her present work is an exten-
sion of the “ Throwing-Sticks ” into the Mexican arena, where she has
been able to trace the apparatus in many various forms.

From Dresden my journey was to Berlin, where, although missing the
great lights of anthropology, I had the pleasure of studying the collec-
tions. I need not speak cf the Old Museum, and the National Gallery,
of the University, the Zoélogical Garden, and the great library. They
excite my admiration, but they were not especially anthropological. I
was extremely delighted with the evolutionary series of fire-arms and
artillery in the Zeug-haus. This is one of the best worked out historico-
technic series I have seen. Two museums in Berlin are most attractive
to the anthropologist and to the historian, the Kunstgewerbe Museum
DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY. 125

and the K. Museum fiir Vélkerkunde. In the former, the substances,
arts, evolution, and history predominate. Itis the German South Ken-
sington. In the latter, topographical, ethnical concepts predominate.
Those two great museums are installed in beautiful new buildings
erected for the purpose, far away from the site of the National Gallery.
The Anthropological Museum is built on the corner of Zimmer-strasse
and Koniggratzer-strasse, in form of an irregular quadrangle, with an
entrance tower at the intersection of the streets. The building is four
stories in height besides the basement. In the first exhibition story is
installed with great effect the Schliemann collections and the archeo-
logical treasures. On the second story are to be seen the spoils of
Africa, Oceanica, and America. In the third story are the treasures
of Hastern Asia and in the fourth story the anthropological material.
Toe much can not be said in praise of the richness of this museum.
The arrangement being simply by regions, by nationalities, or by tribes,
little attempt has been made to work out any of the finer problems of
ethnology.

From Berlin the curator journeyed to Stockholm, where with un-
speakable pleasure he had the opportunity of examining the work of
Hildebrand and Montelius in the National Museum. The lower story
of this vast building is given up to the history of Sweden during 4,000
years. A very small case near the entrance contains specimens repre-
senting paleolithic Sweden. The neolithic period widens out into an
immense exposition of the most beautiful and finely wrought objects of
flint. The bronze age is carefully studied out and illustrated by mate-
rial that has excited the admiration of the world. There is an enor-
mous quantity of gold objects mixed withthe bronze. In order to secure
all the precious metal found by men in excavating, the Government
takes the object at its bullion value, with an honorarium. This saves all

precious objects from the melting-pot. Next comes the Iron age, then
the Middle age, then modern Swedish history, closing with the coins,
medals, decorations, and monuments of the reigning family. There
does not seem to be a break in the 4,000 years. The ethnographic col-
lections are not separately installed, having formed a part of the nat-
ural history museum.

My next journey was to Copenhagen: the city of Thorwaldsen,
Nyerup, Thomsen, Worsaae; and later of Sophus Muller, Herbst, Holm
and Bahnson. Especially interesting are two ancient log coffins, show-
ing the mortuary customs of the ancient Danes. As soon as you enter
the old Nordisk Museum you are at once brought into relation with
the shell-heaps or Kjékkenméddings. In some of the vitrines the
long, graceful flint flakes are piled ten deep. . The stone age of Den-
mark, as of Sweden, assumes the neolithic type. There is as yet no
palolithic age. As soon as you pass within, you are in the presence
of leaf-shaped blades, daggers, celts—the largest in the world: some
measuring over 16 inches in length—crescent-shaped blades, sharpen-

ing stones, arrow-heads (as delicate as those of California Indian speci-
mens), and innumerable forms in bone and antlers. For its size Copen-
hagen is the best equipped city in the world for the ethnologist. Com-
mencing with archeology, the stone age repeats the story of Stockholm,
with enough variety to make one glad to visit both. From the earliest
appearance of man in Danish territory you are able to trace him down
to the historic period. The objects are classified by material, form, and
period. The bronze age rooms are even more instructive and thought-
inspiring. Gold and amber are here in luxurious abundance. [ven in
those early times seafaring Danes must have learned to scour the earth.
Certainly there is neither copper nor tin nor amber around these islands
and peninsulas. The molds in which celts, razors, reaping-hooks, dag-
gers and other tools were cast are made of steatite. These molds and
other apparatus have raised the critical question whether the Scandi-
navian bronze age originated on its own soil.

Here, the iron age antedates the Christian era, but so easily does
iron yield itself to decay that we shall have to call it the golden age,
so far as good specimens are concerned. ‘The iron age continues here
to the age of gunpowder, or to speak more by the Museum ecard, in
Denmark to the coup d’état of 1606. The armor is shown in the Royal
Artillery Museum, but you can follow the stream of Danish history
through church relics and furniture. To complete the whole story of
Denmark, you have only to spend a day in the old Rosenberg palace to
follow the present dynasty to the reigning sovereign. Of the Ethno-
graphic Museum, celebrated during the whole century, it is only neces-
sary to say that it was the first attempt in the world to arrange museum
material by peoples. This collection is uniquely rich in East Green-
land specimens, the spoils of Captain Holm. Fifty rooms cover as many
natural or ethnic subjects, and hundreds of specimens are here that can
not be duplicated, because of the early day at which the collection began
to be formed. The objects of interest to the ethnologist in Hamburg
are to be seen in two buildings, the Kunsthalle and the Gewerbe-schule
Museum. The former is the art collection of the city and is really an
imposing building in the midst of a great forest park. The Gewerbe-
schule is on the order of South Kensington and-is worth visiting. The
gaps in European art become truly painful when the hiatus of a millen-
ium is pointed out by the majolica pottery following immediately the
later Roman. The ethnographic collection is as poor in its installation
as itis rich in material. The museums of Brussels are superb in ma-
terial and treatment and are worthy of the distinguished men whose
monuments they are. The one series which makes them preeminent is
in the National Gallery. It was gathered from the bone-caves, which
have yielded such wonderful paleontological results. The specimens
are mounted with the greatest of care, and in the arrangement of one
series of cases above another the economy of space is remarkable. In
the Place de Hal are to be seen excellent collections of armor, antiquities

of Belgium, and, in the upper story, the Raveustein collection of gems
and antiquities. In Amsterdam, Leyden, and the Hague are world-
famed collections. In the first-named city the museum building is quite
imposing and the representations of Dutch life are worth studying. The
curator was extremely unfortunate in missing Dr. Schmeltz and other
ethnologists. The historical and ethnological collections here rank with
those of London, Paris, Berlin, and Copenhagen. In Antwerp is the
Plantinian collection, perhaps the most complete technical unit exhibit
in the world. In the National Museum at Washington a perfect speci-
men includes three requisites: a genuine object, pictures of the object
in process of manufacture and in use, and finally, full description of its
origin, structure, and function. These lay the foundation for the cab-
inet, the portfolio, and the archives. The Plantinian museum shows
the history of the art of printing, in machinery and appliances, in pic-
tures and in histories of printing and apparatus.

Time would not-allow the curator to extend his visit further than to
the museums mentioned. The prevailing impression left upon his mind
is that, varying as they do in their stock of material and genius of their
directors, thereis no one classific concep t in which all should be arranged
The best results are reached in those collections where the material is
servant to a master mind.

PRINCIPAL ACCESSIONS.

The accessions to the ethnological collections of the National Museum
during the year to which special attention should be called are the fol-
lowing:

Mr. Romyn Hitchcock, returning from Japan, after a two-years’ so-
journ, has enriched the ethnographic series with many most desirable
specimens, gathered on the spot with the view of illustrating the life of
the people. Costumes were secured which traly represent Japanese
common life. The full contents of a kitchen, the apparatus of character-
istic crafts, weights and measures, furniture, and a large series connected
with Japanese religion, help to illustrate the true Japanese life. Mr.
Hitchcock spent much time among the Ainos, utilizing his talent as an
artist to add value to his material secured by means of many pictures.
This Aino material, fully labeled, is installed together in the Museum.
A life-sized figure of a man in costume, wodels of the house, granary,
bear-cage, and sacred hedge in miniature, specimens of Aino handicraft,
and a series of photographs enable the visitor to gain a slight concep-
tion of the Aino manners and customs,

The Museum African material has been enriched by accessions from
the Inhambane Zulus, collected by the missionary, Rev. E. H. Richards,
and presented by the Oberlin College,

The United States Eclipse Expedition was able, through its natural-
ist, Mr. W. H. Brown, to secure for the Museum its first material from
Angola. To this must be added the generous gift of Mr. J. H. Camp
from the Congo. Fortunately, while these three collections were being

registered, the services and unique collection of Mr. Heli Chatelain, for
a long time missionary on the west coast of Africa, were secured.

Growing out of the public interest in Samoan affairs the Museum ac-
quired collections made by Admiral Kimberly, U.S. Navy, and Ensign
W. EH. Safford. The former was sent by Mataafa and Malietoa, chiefs
of Samoa, to the U. S. Navy Department.

Following up the plan pursued by Lieutenant Bolles with the Eskimo
collection and by Ensign Niblack with the northwest collection, the for-
mer, aided by Mr. William Churchill, has brought together into a single
court the specimens from the region commonly called Oceanieca, includ-
ing several well-marked types of the Papuan, the Negrite, the J} Malay,
the Polynesian and the Australian.

The recent collections brought to the Museum by expeditions to Sa-
moa, added to the treasures secured fifty years ago by Captain Wilkes,
enable the curator to make a fair showing of this part of the world.
Lay figures representing the Papuan, the Dyak, and the Samoan, in
native dress, have very much added to the attractiveness of the hall.

From the Sandwich Islands the Museum acquired photographs and
specimens, the gift of Mrs. Sybil Carter, wife of the Hawaiian minister.
These are of great value, because of the familiarity of Mrs. Carter with
the aboriginal customs of the islands.

Dr. H. N. Allen, court physician to the King of Corea, deposited in
the Museum his rich collection from that kingdom. Many of these
objects were presented by the King and show the best art-skill of the
country. This royal gift and Ensign Bernadou’s collection give an ex-
cellent picture of Corean life.

The Hupa Valley, California, is represented by two collections, one
made by Mr. N. J. Purcell, and the other by Mr. Jeremiah Curtin.
They admirably supplement the great collection made by Capt. P. H.
Ray, U.S. Army.

Dr. George M. Kober, U. S. Army, gave a number of specimens from
Idaho and Washington, regions not so fully illustrated in the Museum
as the States farther south.

The collection of Navajo silver work, on which Dr. Washington Mat-
thews, U. S. Army, based his paper in the Third Annual Report of the
Bureau of Ethnology, has been acquired and will be set up to illustrate
his monographs.

Through the Interior Department a large series from Washington,
collected by Kev. E. C. Chirouse, was received. The specimens are old
and genuine Indian work of the greatest value.

Mr. W. W. Rockhill deposited in the Museum the ethnological re-
sults of his second Thibetan exploration. The collection consists of
many unique specimens illustrating the customs of the Chinese, Mon-
gols Si Fan, and Thibetans. Mr. Rockhill also deposited a collection of
foreign weapons and Chinese art-enamel work in the Museum, and

has rendered gratuitously invaluable aid in Jabeling and cataloguing
these materials.

In the technic series a separate court has been set aside for the exhi-
bition of mortuary customs to illustrate the study in this subject made
by Dr. H. C. Yarrow.

The crowded condition of the halls rendering it impossible to exhibit
many new series, the curator in the spring of 1890 commenced to nake
a systematic card catalogue of the entire ethnologic exhibit.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF AMERICAN PREHISTORIC POTTERY
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890,

By Witiiam H. Houmes, Honorary Curator.

During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890, little work has been done
in the Department of Aboriginal Pottery. The installation of the ex-
hibition series is practically completed and all that remains to be done
is in the direction of more thorough labeling of individual specimens,

Accessions have not been as numerous as in preceding years, yet
much of value has been acquired.

The more important accessions of the year include a series of frag-
mentary ware from Bear Point, Perdido Bay, Alabama, contributed by
Mrs. A. T. Mosman and A. B. Simons, and supplementary to the col-
lections of F. H. Parsons acquired last year; and a remarkable group
of vases obtained from a mound on the Savannah River, Richmond
County, Georgia, by H. lL. Reynolds. These, and some other contribu-
tions mentioned in the accompanying list, were acquired through the
agency of the Bureau of Ethnology.

The routine work of the department has consisted chiefly in labeling
and entering upon the books such new material as has been acquired.
A number of sets of specimens have been selected for exchange.

Such researches as have been conducted by the curator, relate
mainly to collections from the mounds of the Mississippi Valley and
adjacent regions. The work undertaken is to form a part of the mon-
ographie work of Dr. Cyrus Thomas upon the Mound Builders.

The last catalogue number in June 1889, is 135151; in June 1890,
135363.

The curator has published three papers during the year. These are
noticed in the Bibliography.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890,

By Cyrus ADLER, Asstslant Curator

In the absence in Europe of Prof. Paul Haupt, honorary curator of
the section, I beg to submit the following report for the past fiscal
year.

The collections exhibited are still confined to Babylonian, Assyrian,
and Egyptian objects, and the considerable amount of material now in
the Museum which would naturally come under the heading of Biblical
Archeology is exhibited in other departments. Possibly the most
gratifying results of the year’s work, the character of which did not
differ from the preceding one, is the increased codperation of other
institutions and of individuals, and the aid which the Smithsonian In-
stitution has been enabled to extend to the recently established museums
and to scientific investigators.

The authorities of the Catholic University of America (Washington,
D. C.), recently inaugurated, have established an ‘oriental museum.
They have adopted the Museum standards and a healthy codperation
has been established.

The growing interest in oriental studies has resulted in the formation
of a private class in Washington, whose investigations have been aided
by photographs and objects belonging to the collections.

The fact of the participation of the Smithsonian Institution in the
Kighth International Congress of Orientalists, which met at Stockholm
in September, 1889, was briefly alluded to in the last report.

At the request of Count Carlo Landberg, the secretary of the con-
gress, the Smithsonian Institution published a special circular for
American scholars, containing information as to the meetings. The
Institution presented on behalf of the Museum to the King of Sweden,
president of the congress, a set of reproductions of Assyrian seals,
illustrating the methods employed. These objects were highly com-
mended by his majesty on their presentation; General Thomas, United
States minister to Sweden, transmitting a communication to that
effect. The Smithsonian Institution was represented at the congress

137
138 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

by Professor Haupt, whose report to the Secretary will be found else-
where.

The American Oriental Society has appointed a committee to pre-
pare a catalogue of the oriental manuscripts in the United States. A
member of the committee learned of a collection, numbering, it is said,
160 Persian and Arabic MSS., formed by the late William B. Hodgson.
They were traced to the Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences in Sa-
vannah, Georgia, and, after some correspondence, the trustees of that
institution passed a resolution authorizing the director to forward the
MSS. to the Smithsonian Institution, on deposit, for study.

Mr. Taleott Williams, of Philadelphia, while on a tour through Mo-
rocco, undertook to make a collection for the Museum. Amoug the
objects thus acquired are many illustrating the manners and customs
of the inhabitants of that country.

The preparation of the Smithsonian Report on the Progress of Ori-
ental Science in America during 1888 necessitated correspondence with
many of the orientalists of the United States, resulting in useful addi-
tions to the sectional library.

ACCESSIONS.

Through the good offices of the Hon. Oscar 8S. Straus, formerly
U. 8. minister to Turkey, and the courtesy of Prof. Howard Osgood,
of Rochester, New York, the Museum has come into possession of
cast of the famous Temple inscription discovered by the French arch-
eologist, Clermont-Ganneau, May 26, 1871, and now in the Imperial
Museum at Constantinople. The inscription reads: “No stranger is to
enter within the balustrade round the Temple and inclosures. Who-_
ever is caught will be responsible to himself for his death.” In the
account of Herod’s Temple by Josephus (Antiq., xv, 11, 5) an inserip-
tion is mentioned which forbade “ any foreigner to enter the inclosure
on pain of death.” And in a second description (Wars, v, 5, 2) he
states that the warnings were written ‘‘some in Greek and some in
Roman letters.” Through this discovery light is also thrown on the
episode in Acts XxXI, 28-31, where Paul was accused of bringing
Trophimus, an Ephesian, within the balustrade, and ‘all the city was
moved and the people ran together, and they laid hold on Paul and
dragged him out of the Temple, and they were seeking to kill him.”
According to Clermont-Ganneaun, this is the most ancient as well as
the most interesting Greek inscription which archeological investiga-
tion in Jerusalem has produced.

Mr. Theodore Graf, of Vienna, presented to the Museum a set of
photographs and a selection of heliogravures of his collection of Grzeco-
Egyptian portraits. The originals were discovered near Fayum at a
place called Rubaiyet, in July, 1887. In producing these portraits the
brush was not used, the encaustic or distemper processes being resorted
SECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES. 139

to. The artist who practiced the encaustic process first spread a mixture
of pure beeswax and liquid balsam over a smooth surface, on which the
colors were laid in the form of a mosaic. The different colors were then
blended together by means of the cestrum, a spoon-shaped instrument,
the bowl of which had serrated edges, while the handle was rounded.
The portraits, painted in distemper, were executed in a composition con-
sisting of the yolk of an egg, a little oil, and the required powdered
colors. Still another process was to mix oil and coior powder together
and put it on in a molten condition. Some of the pictures show that
all three processes were employed. It is difficult to determine the date
at which these paintings were executed, but it must have been some
time between 100 and 350 A. D. The portraits were probably painted
from life. The collection exhibits notably the different types of counte-
nance and the methods of dressing the hair. The originals are still for
sale and would be a great addition to any antiquarian collection.

Dr. R. Zehnpfund, of Leipzig, presented an imitation of an Assyrian
clay tablet, written by himself, containing a hymn in praise of wine, in
the style of the Nimrod epic composed by Professor Haupt, of Johns
Hopkins University, Baltimore. The tablet was made out of a lump of
clay which, after being carefully sifted, washed, and cleaned, was moist-
ened, rolled up in the form of a cylinder, and then flattened on a board.
When the clay became sufficiently dry so that it would not adhere
to the stylus, the tablet received the necessary polish by being rubbed
against a smooth, flat board. The stylus used for writing consisted of
a four-cornered piece of hard-oiled wood, the front end of which was
cut off slanting. Writing with this instrument was easy and did not
occupy much time. It took littke more than an hour to write this

tablet.*
Rev. Dr. William Hayes Ward, of New York, permitted copies to be

made of twelve Babylonian and Assyrian seals in his collection. Ten
similar objects were received from Prof. D. G. Lyon, of Harvard Uni-
versity, and eighteen Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, and Egyptian
gems from Prof. H. Hyvernat, of the Catholic University.

A series of photographs was purchased from the Palestine explora-
tion fund.

DISTRIBUTIONS.

Casts of forty Assyrian seals were presented to the University of
Pennsylvania; a similar collection was sent to Prof. Howard Osgood, of
the University of Rochester, New York. Ten casts of Assyrian seals
were sent to Prof. D. G. Lyon, Harvard University, and two to Dr.
Ward. Copies of the Canopus Inscription were forwarded to Lehigh
University and to the Chinese minister.

ROUTINE WORK.

During the year the collections were rearranged, with the object of
securing more space. The seals, copied from the originals owned by
the Misses Bruce and Prof. O. C. Marsh, of New Haven, referred to in
the last report, were labeled and placed in the exhibition cases. The
photogravures of the Greco-Egyptian portraits and the copies of the
seals of Dr. Ward, referred to above, have been placed on exhibition.

A complete series of the casts of seals is preserved in the study series.

In addition to the persons mentioned above, the Museum is indebted
for codperation and assistance to Mr. Henry Gillman, United States
consul at Jerusalem, Mr, W. Max Miiller, and Dr. F.C. H. Wendel, of
New York.
REPORT ON THE HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890,

By A. HowarpD CLARK, Curator.

The transfer of a large collection of relics of General Washington
from the Patent Office to the National Museum in 1883 was the begin-
ning of a separate section devoted to historical collections. With the
Washington relics were grouped many objects heretofore exhibited in
other departments of the Museum, but which are of more interest as
personal relics of representative men or memorials of events or places
of historic importance. Here were brought together various gifts from
foreign governments to Presidents Jefferson, Adams, Van Buren, Com-
modore Perry and other high officials of the United States, besides
relics of Benjamin Franklin, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Gen-
eral Ripley, Commodore Elliott, Commodore Biddle, and many other
eminent American statesmen and soldiers, as well as numerous manu-
scripts and relics pertaining to the colonial and revolutionary war
period of our country, and mementoes of Sir John Franklin, Kane,
Hayes, Hall, De Long and other Arctic explorers. In November, 1836,
the large collection of relics of General Grant were received and added
very greatly to the popular interest in this section of the Museum.*
The growth of the historical collections in the past three years has
been very rapid, and the space devoted to this class of exhibits is found
far too limited for their display to visitors. The collections exhibited
in the north hall have been partially rearranged and many new objects
have been installed during the year. Labels have been written for all
objects shown. There are now in reserve many hundreds of objects that
might be exhibited if space permitted.

A beginning has been made on a collection of postage stamps of all

nations, about 1,600 specimens gathered by Professor Baird forming
the nucleus of this collection.

The collection of portraits of representative men of the world has in-
creased considerably in number during the year, but is yet very incom-
plete. There have been put on exhibition engraved and photographic
portraits of some of the most eminent scientists, and an interesting col-

*A list of these objects is given in the Annual Report for 1887.
142 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

lection of portraits of the medical men of the world deposited by Dr. J.
M. Toner.

The collection illustrating the moneys of the world in all ages and
countries has been an addition of popular interest, as is evidenced by
the many valuable loan collections of ancient and modern pieces. This
collection is not limited to metallic currency, but includes paper cur-
rency and various substitutes for money. -

The entries in the catalogue during the year aggregate 645, repre-
senting about 1,000 specimens. Upwards of 3,000 additions have been
made to the card catalogue, which now numbers about 10,000 cards.
There are yet many objects not catalogued in detail, though accession
cards and lists are preserved.

The accessions during the year were as follows:

From Charles Abert, Homewood, Maryland, a marble bust of Benjamin Franklin,
sculptured by Ceracchi, in Italian marble.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF GRAPHIC ARTS
IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

By S. R. Kornrer, Curator.

The re-arrangement of the collections of the Section of Graphic Arts,
which was alluded to as impending in my iast report, has been carried
out. The details of this arrangement are set forth on the leaflet printed
for the information of visitors to the Museum, and here reprinted.

CLASSIFICATION OF EXHIBITS IN THE SECTION OF GRAPHIC ARTS.

The collections exhibited in the Hall of Graphic Arts illustrate the various meth-
ods of producing pictures on flat surfaces, by hand, as well as by mechanical means.
They form two main groups, the one technical, the other historical.

On the eastern side of the hall, opposite the windows, are arranged the specimens
illustrating the technical methods of the reproductive or multiplying arts; that is to
say, those arts that produce blocks, plates, etc., from which impressions can be ob-
tained in the press, such as wood-engraving, engraving on metal with the graver or
burin, etching, mezzotinting, lithography, the modern photomechanical processes, ete.

On the western or window side are illustrated the various methods of drawing and
painting, the history of painting (by means of carbon prints, etc.), and the history of
engraving in relief (wood-engraving, etc.), intaglio (engraving with the burin, ete.),
and of drawing on stone, etc. (lithography). On the same side of the hall will also
be found illustrations of the history of color-printing, and supplementary exhibitions
illustrating aids to drawing used by lithographers and draftsmen for process-work,
methods of enlarging and reducing, etc., and industrial applications of printing.

The collections are arranged in alcoves in the following order:

HASTERN SIDE OF THE HALL.
BEGINNING AT THE SOUTHERN END.

Alcove 1.—Typical illustrations of the methods used in the production of printable
blocks and plates.—Relief-engraving (the wood-cut, wood-engraving, relief-engray-
ing on metal): Tools, materials, and appliances. Proving and printing. Electro-
typing. Original drawings, etc., with the engravings made from them.

Alcove 2 (southern side and wall).—Relief-engraving continued: Color-printing from
relief blocks. Japanese wood-cutting and wood-cut printing (including the case
placed in the alcove).

Alcove 2 (northern side).—Intaglio-engraving: Tools, materials, and appliances.
The various methods of intaglio-engraving (burin or graver work, etching, dry-point-
ing, etc.).

Alcove 3.—Intaglio-engra ving continued: The various methods continued (soft-
ground etching, aquatint, mezzotint, roulette work, stipple, mixed manner, color-
printing, intaglio on wood, etc.). Proving and printing. EKlectrotyping and steel-

lithograph in its various stages.

Standard between alcoves 4 and 5.—Miscellaneous processes, partly chemical, partly
mechanical, devised as substitutes for the older hand processes, but not involving

graphic etching, properly so-called), chemitype, the graphotype, the kaolatype, the
wax process and allied processes (glyphography, kerography, stylography, typo-
graphic etching improperly so called, etc.), machine relief-engraving, machine intag-
lio-engraving (medai-ruling), galvanography, stenochromy, mineralography, nature
printing, the anastatic process, etc.—Appendix: Etching on glass (improperly so
called), eR involves photography, but not the use of the press.

Aleove 5.—Photo-mechanical processes, involving the production of gelatine or
other glutinous films, to be used as printing surfaces in the lithographic press,
i. e., collographic or photo-gelatine printing processes (albertype, heliotype, artoty pe,
etc.).

Alcove 6.—Photo-mechanical processes producing relief blocks for printing in the
type-press (etching, swell gelatine, and washout processes): line processes. Half-
tone processes, i. e., gelatine grain processes (Paul Pretsch’s and later); screen pro-
cesses (Meisenbach, etc.); the Ives process.

Alcove 7.—Photo-mechanical processes involving the production of printable designs
on stone or zine, i. e., photolithography and photozincography : Haif-tone processes
(the bitumen process, Poitevin’s process, Asser’s process, etc.; recent grain processes ;
screen processes). Line processes (Osberne’s process).

Alcove 8.—Photo-mechanical processes producing intaglio-plates for Sears | in the
copper-plate press, 7. e., photogravure: Etching processes, deposit processes, etc.

SECTION OF GRAPHIC ARTS. 149

Alcove 7.—Aids to drawing used by lithographers and draftsmen for process work:

- Grained and embossed papers; pasting tints; the air-brush; Day’s shading mediums,

ete.—Methods of reducing and enlarging: The pantagraph; rubber machines;
photo-mechanical processes.—Industrial applications of printing: Printing on wood,
celluloid, metal, glass, ete.

NoTE.—Some of the items named in above list have not yet been placed en exhibi-
tion, but space has been reserved for all, and they will be added as soon as possible.

A beginning has also been made with the labeling of the collections,
but the greater part of the manuscript for labels sent in thus far is still
in the hands of the printers. The collection of patents relating to the
graphic arts is in the same condition in which it was a year ago, both
time and money having been wanting to carry it on towards completion
and classification.

The most important accession of the year has been the collection of
tools, materials, prints, etc., illustrating the practice of chromoxy|-
ography in Japan, generously donated to the Museum by the Japanese
Government printing office (Insetsu Kioku) in Tokio, through its chief,
Mr. T. Tokuno. The very interesting descriptive matter which accom-
panied this collection will be published as soon as certain further infov-
niation asked for has been received from Japan and the necessary illus-
trations prepared. A large collection of drawings by pupils of the Art
Academy of Cincinnati, presented by the Cincinnati Museum Associit-
tion, also deserves special mention here. In the technical division, tne
exhibits illustrating dry-pointing, soft-ground etching, engraving in
intaglio on wood, and the wax process have been satisfactorily com-
pleted. Much, however, remains to be done, more especially in the
divisions of drawing and painting and in the technical illustration of
the various photomechanical processes. The list of donations, here-
with submitted, shows, indeed, that a considerable number of speci-

mens exemplifying the results of these processes have again been ac.

quired, but it is very difficult, under present circumstances, to secure
the means of explaining the processes themselves.

ing an increase during the year of 577 numbers. There still remains
to be catalogued, however, by far the larger part of the Osborne Collec-
tion, the classifivation of which will also place at the disposal of the
Museum quite a number of duplicates which may be used for ex-
changes.

Bibliography (section Tv).

RECOMMENDATION IN REGARD TO THE SEWALL COLLECTION.

I beg permission to urge again the recommendations made last year:
notably, the desirability of definitely turning over to the Section of
Graphic Arts the remains of the Marsh Collection, and of an appeal to
Congress for a special appropriation for the purchase of the Sewall Col-
lection of engravings, etc., in regard to which I have already addressed
a letter to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, which is here
reprinted :

UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM,
UNDER DIRECTION OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, April 17, 1890.
Prof. S. P. LANGLEY, ;
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution :

DrEAR Sir: In acecrdance with your request, I beg to submit herewith some details
concerning the Sewall Collection of Prints now offered for sale in New York, and to
state the reasons which induced me to recominend in my annual report that an appeal
be made to Congress for a special appropriation for its purchase.

It appears from the figures given on the accompanying sheets that the collection
consists of 16,300 prints (exclusive of 4,100 portraits and landscapes which the owner
does not hold to be of sufficient importance to enumerate with the rest, although
they are to be included in the sale) by over 1,400 artists of all schools and periods,
from the beginning of the reproductive arts in the fifteenth century down to our own
time. In addition to these prints there are 400 drawings.

In considering the question of the acquisition of such a collection, three things must
be taken into account: (1) Its quality; (2) its character as a whole in relation to
the history of the art of engraving, that is to say, its relative completeness or incom-
pleteness ; and (3) its price.

As to the quality of the Sewall collection, I can say from personal observation
that it contains many very fine prints, together with others that are not so fine.
The partial lists herewith submitted show that it ig extraordinarily rich in the works
of some of the most celebrated artists who have worked as etchers or engravers 1n
past centuries. Thus, there are 294 pieces by Marcantonio and his school; 359 by
Albert Diirer; 127 by Lucas van Leyden; 490 by the Little Masters; 359 by Rem-
brandt; 391 by Hollar; 227 by Goltzius and his school; 53 by Claude Lorrain; 433
by Jacques Callot; 82 by Nanteuil; 222 by J. G. Wille, etc. Nevertheless, I wish to
have it distinctly understood that Ihave been able thus far to examine only a rela-
tively small portion of the collection, and that, if a purchase should be contemplated,
a more careful examination will be in order. Concerning the second point, it is evi-
dent, from the statements herewith, that the historical completeness of the collec-
tion, considering its size, is one of its most valuable qualities, since it presents to the
student not only examples of ali the processes of engraving practised by artists up
to about the middle of the present century, but also specimens of all artists of suffi-
cient note to make a knowledge of their work indispensable, with others by many
men of Jess importance. This admirable, well-proportioned development of the col-
lection is due to the fact that the present owner has been a systematic collector,
having a well-defined aim in view, for the last forty years, and that especially within
SECTION OF GRAPHIC ARTS. 153

the earlier part of this period he has found it possible to secure specimens which are
becoming rarer from year to year. In a connected series, such as the Sewall collec-
tion represents, even specimens not of the first quality assume great importance,
since they supply links in a chain which would be broken without them. It would
be inexcusable, therefore, to allow this collection to be dispersed, a fate which is in-
evitably in store for it if it is not acquired by some public institution.

Of the price asked it may be said without hesitation that it is extraordinarily low.
The sum total demanded is $55,760, of which $560 is for the drawings. Ignoring the
4,100 pieces set aside by the owner as of no value, we have the price of $55,200 for
16,300 prints, or an average of $3.39 for each print. As many of these prints would
to-day bring from one hundred to several hundred dollars each in open market, the
smallness of the sum named is apparent from these figures alone. A better way,
however, to arrive at some idea of the market value of the collection, will be to com-
pare the prices set down in Mr. Sewall’s inventory for a number of specified prints
with the prices lately realized for the same prints at auction sales in Europe. I
have tried to do this, by going over the inventory and selecting from it such prints
as had appeared also in the Coppenrath sale, which took place in Europe last year,
being careful to compare state with state, so far as that point could be settled. The
result is that, if the whole collection were invoiced at prices equivalent throughout
to those obtained for the prints involved at the sale named, the Sewall collection
would be worth to-day about $145,000. It would not be safe, however, to accept this
figure without further questioning. A comparison of the prints as to quality with
those sold in Europe, and an extension of the calculation to the whole collection
would, quite likely, tend towards a greater equalization of the figures in question.
Nevertheless, it will probably be permissible to assume that the price asked does
not represent more than about one-half of present market value. Looked at, there-
fore, from a mere money point of view, it is evident that the purchase of the collec-
tion would be a good investment. For it must be kept in mind that the prices of
old prints are going up with alarming rapidity ; and furthermore, that from the price
actually named must be deducted the labor and expense of collecting, which, if a
collection such as the Sewall were to be made up by purchases in the market, would
be an item of very considerable magnitude.

_ As, however, the Smithsonian Institution is not a money-making concern, the ques-
tion of price, although of great importance, is not the only one, or even the most
important, to be considered; and it may therefore be worth while to devote a few mo-
ments to the question, whether the purchase of such a collection is in itself desirable ?
- If we are to be led by the example of others, that question must unhesitatingly be
answered in the affirmative. All the nations of Europe have considered it necessary
to establish national print collections, and to give careful attention to their keeping
anil continual enlargement. The British Print Room, the ‘‘ Département des Estam-
pes” at Paris, the Cabinets at Amsterdam and Brussels, the ‘‘ Kupferstich-Sammlung
der koniglichen Museen” (Print collection of the Royal Museums) at Berlin, the Royal
Print Cabinet at Dresden, are all institutions of world-wide celebrity, and the posses-
sors of treasures of inestimable value, and of a magnitude that it is difficult to realize.
The most extensive among them are the British Print Room, the possessions of which,
so far as I know, have never been counted, the French ‘‘ Département des Estampes,”
with something like two and a half millions of specimens, and the collection of the
Royal Museums at Berlin, with overone million. Most, if not all, of these public col-
jections began by the purchase of private collections such as that made by Mr. Sewall.

The practical beginning of the Paris collection dates from the year 1667, when Colbert
bought for the state the collection of Michel de Marrolles, Abbé de Villeloin, consist-
ing of 123,400 pieces for 30,400 livres. The value of this collection was estimated by
Henri Delaborde (in his book on the Département des Estampes), in 1875, at over one
million, and as within the fifteen years which have elapsed since then, the prices of
prints have risen enormously, the actual value to-day is much larger. In a similar

154 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

way the Berlin collections, of much more recent origin, date from the purchase for
the state in 1835, by order of the King of Prussia, of the von Nagler collection for the
sum of 92,333 thalers, which included, however, a number of ceramic and other ob-
jects. But Wessely is quite right when he says, likewise in 1875 (in his book “ Die
Kupferstich-Sammlung,” etc.), that the prints alone of the von Nagler collection were
then worth at least ten times the sum paid for the collection as a whole; and again,
in view of the further appreciation in prices since this statement was made, the pres-
ent value is much greater than that assumed by Wessely. Compared with the Ma-
rolles and the von Nagler collections the Sewall collection naturally appears quite in-
significant and the price asked comparatively high. But it must be recollected that
the times have changed, and the chances for acquiring collections approaching any-
thing like comparative completeness are growing less and less. Quite likely, indeed,
if the present occasion should be allowed to pass by unused, asimilar one will never
offeragain. But asit is absolutely certain that atsome time or other the United States
will feel the necessity of organizing a national print collection, it may be accepted as
equally certain that the prices which will then have to be paid will be much greater
for much less material. It is the experience of the Sibylline books over again.

It may be said, however, that what others have done is not necessarily a standard
of action for the United States, and that we must follow paths laid out by ourselves.
If the question involved were merely one of fashion or of taste, the objection would
be well taken. It is a question, however, of educational facilities, from which will
flow permanent advantages to the material and intellectual welfare of the nation,
and seen in this light it will appear that the matter is peculiarly well fitted to be
taken in hand by an institution for the dissemination of knowledge, like the Smith-
sonian. The uses of a print collection seem still to be misunderstood by the majority
of people. Although such a collection may be made to minister exclusively, and
always will minister to a certain extent, to the esthetic delight of connoisseurs, this
aspect of it is yet very far from being its only or even its most important one. Nat-
urally enough the student of the history of art will derive great benefit from such a
collection, more especially in a country like ours,- which can not possibly hope ever
to possess in sufficient quantity the originals interpreted in prints. But, aside from
the history of art, there is hardly a branch of human knowledge or human activity
that is not represented in a print collection, for whatever man has aspired to, either
intellectually or in the practical pursuits of life, he has sought to shape visibly in
pictures, and ever since the invention of the reproductive arts it has been the endea-
vor of the engravers to multiply these pictures and to disseminate them broadcast.
For the general historian, therefore, as well as for the students of the exacter sciences,
a print collection, provided that it is well classified and catalogued, and liberally
administered, is a perfect storehouse of information, supplementing and sometimes
even excelling the library, since it presents immediately to the eye, that which words
upon the printed page call up only dimly to the mind. Hven the classes last named,
however, do not exhaust the ranks of those benefited by a print collection. There
is still to be considered the vast army of artisans, designers, and others engaged in
the various industrial pursuits, to whom a print collection offers sources of informa-
tion and inspiration which can not possibly be found elsewhere. The value of this
aid to producers has been so thoroughly recognized in Europe, that in some of the
leading capitals—in Vienna and in Berlin, for instance—special print collections
have been organized, alongside of the general collections, the sole aim of which is
to assist practical workers in the industrial arts.

These are the reasons which induced me to recommend that an appeal be made to
Cougress for a special appropriation for the purchase of the Sewall Collection, and I
beg leave to reiterate this recommendation herewith.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, yours,
S. R. KOEILER,

Curator of the Section of Graphic Arts.
SECTION OF GRAPHIC ARTS. 155

The Sewall Collection of Prints consists of 20,400 pieces, 4,100 of
which, however, mostly portraits, landscapes, ete., the owner does not
consider of sufficient importance to be named as an integral part of
the collection, although they will eventually go with it. Of the re-
maining 16,300 about 15,000 are engravings and etchings; 990, wood-
cuts; 210, mezzotints; and 170, lithographs (these latter mostly early
French, including specimens by Guerin, Gérard, Girodet, Delacroix, De
la Roche, ete.). The collection (exclusive of the 4,100 prints above
alluded to) is arranged in 55 portfolios and 10 volumes. The number
of engravers, etchers, etc., represented in it is 1,400, exclusive of the
works of absolutely anonyinous artists (7. é., artists not even known by
a monogram).

The schools represented in it are the following:

The Italian, from the invention of the art, and the German until
about 1850.

The Dutch and Flemish, the French, and the English, from about
1500 to the nineteenth century.

The Spanish, eighteenth and nineteenth century (Goya).

The American.

It is my duty also to call attention to the fact that a logical and
systematic development of this section must remain an impossibility
until the appropriation for purchases can be measurably increased.
During the period embraced by this report there were expended for
purchases for the Section of Graphic Arts about $175. The number
of accessions and the condition of the collections in general demon-
strate, indeed, that artists and publishers and other friends of the
Museum are ever ready toaid it. But such aid can hardly be regulated,
and can but rarely be turned into the most desirable channels. There
are many things needed which can only be bought, and others which
must be ordered with a definite view to the relation which they are to
bear to other things, if they arethoroughly to filltheir places. These
limitations, as a matter of course, can not be enforced so long as de-
pendence must be placed almost wholly upon gifts.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING
IN THE U. & NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890,

By J. EL¥rETH WATKINS, Curator.

The routine work in the Section of Transportation and Engineering
has been prosecuted during the fiscal year 1859-90 at such times as my
duties in the Department of Property and Supplies would permit. A
number of labels have been attached to specimens and groups in the
exhibition series, which are arranged according to the classification
published in the report of 1589.

While the accessions are Jess numerous than in previous years, they
are no less important.

The collection of primitive vehicles, in the construction of which no
iron or other metal has been used, was materially strengthened by the
deposit of a Mexican cart, by Messrs. Schuttler & Hotz (through Mr.
Martin Conrad), Chicago, Hlinois. The specimen was obtained trom
Paso del Norte, where it had long been in use.

The method of constructing the sides of the body of the vehicle of
eactus saplings held in place by a network of rawhide strips, is of the
greatest interest to the archeologist as well as to the student of the
history of transportation; while the rough wheels, without spokes or
tires, hewn from the solid Jog, show the crude methods of the ancient
wheelwright and the beginnings of the wheel vehicle.

The nucleus of a collection to illustrate the history of the develop-
ment of the bicycle has been secured, through the construction in the
Museum workshops of a model of the English ‘dandy horse”; and
the acquisition of two of the old-fashioned “ velocipedes” with two
wheels of wood, made between 1860 and 1865. A number of drawings
of bicycles constructed during the next ten years have also been.ob-
tained.

To the series illustrating the history of the stationary steam-engine
a most valuable relic has been added. I refer to the portion of the cy1-
inder of the first steam-engine erected on the Western Continent, which
was deposited by the New Jersey Historical Society, who obtained it

from Mr. David M. Meeker, of Newark, New Jersey. In acommunica-
tion to Mr. Meeker from the Hon. Joseph P. Bradley,* one of the jus-

* Justice Bradley married Mary, daughter of Joseph Coerten Hornblower, son of
Josiah Hornblower, who brought the steam-engine to America ia 1753.

tices of the Supreme Court of the United States, the following state-
ments are made, under date of September 20, 1875:

The steam-engine of which you possess a relic was, as you suppose, the first ever
erected on this continent. It was imported from England, in the year 1753, by Col.
John Schuyler, for the purpose of pumping water from his copper mine opposite
Belleville, near Newark, New Jersey. The mine wasrich in ore, but had been worked
as deep as hand and horse- power could clear it of water. Colonel Schuyler having
heard of the success with which steam-engines (then called fire-engines) were used
in the mines of Cornwall, determined to have one in his mine. He accordingly re-
quested his London correspondents to procure an engine, and to send out with it an
engineer capable of putting it up andin operation. This was done in the year named,
and Josiah Hornblower, a young mau then in his twenty-fifth year, was sent to
superintend it. The voyage was a long and perilous one. Mr. Hornblower expected
to return as soon as the engine was in successful operation. But the proprietor in-
duced him to remain, and in the course of a couple of years he married Miss Kings-
land, whose father owned a large plantation adjoining that of Colonel Schuyler.
The late Chief Justice Hornblower was the youngest of a large family of children
which resulted from this marriage. Mr. Hornblower’s father, whose name was
Joseph, had been engaged in the business of constructing engines in Cornwall from
their first introduction in the mines there, about 1740, and had been an engineer and
engine builder from the first use of steam-engines in the arts, about 1720. The en-
gines constructed by him and his sons were the kind known as Newcomen’s engines
or Cornish engines. That brought to America by Josiah was of this description.
Watt had not then invented his separate condenser, nor the use of high pressure.
But it is generally conceded that for pumping purposes the Cornish engine has still
no superior. :

After 1760 the Schuyler mine was worked for several years by Mr. Hornblower him-
self. The approach of the-war, in 1775, caused the operations to vease. Work was
resumed, however, in 1792, and was carried on for several years by successive parties.
It finally ceased altogether early in this century, and the old engine was broken up
and the materials disposed of, The boiler, a large copper cylinder, standing upright,
sor 10 feet high and as mnch in diameter, with a flat bottom and a dome-shaped
top, was carried to Philadelphia. The relic in your possession was a portion of the
cylinder, and was purchased by some person in Newark.

In 1864 I met an old man named John Van Emburgh, then a hundred years old, who
had worked on the engine when it was in operation in 1792. He described it very
minutely and, I doubt not, accurately. It is from his description that I happened to
know the kind of engine it was; although, from the date of its construction and the
use to which it was put, there could have been but little doubt on the subject.

What changes have been wrought in 125 years. What mighty power has been
created on this continent in that time by the multiplication and improvement of the
steam-engine. We may well look upon this relic with a sort of superstitious venera-
tion, and looking forward as well as backward, wonder what another century will
bring forth.

An important addition has also been made to the steamboat series
by the authorities of Stevens Institute, Hoboken, New Jersey, who de-
posited two drawings, made by Fulton’s hand, about 1807. One isa
draft of the machinery of the historic steamboat, which he at first called
the Catherine of Clermont. The other is a drawing of the Chancellor
Livingston, another steamboat constructed by Fulton shortly after the
Clermont was put in service.

A most interesting relic has been added to the series illustrating the
history of the locomotive, namely, the original boiler of the locomotive
SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING. 161

“Stourbridge Lion.” This has been deposited by Messrs. Lindsay &
Early, Carbondale, Pennsylvania. Upon the full-size model of this, the
first locomotive to turn a driving-wheel upon a railroad built for traffic
on the Western Continent, which was deposited in the National Museum
several years ago by the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, is a
framed letter from Horatio Allen, who for sixty years was a conspicuous
figureamong American civil engineers. The letter reads:

HOMEWOOD, SOUTH ORANGE, NEW JERSEY,
January 12, 1888.

DEAR Sir: In reply to your inquiries, I write to say that the locomotive known as
the ‘‘Stourbridge Lion” was the first lecomotive run on this continent.

That the occurrence took place at Hornsdale, Pennsylvania, August 9, 1829, on the
mnine railroad of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company.

That the locomotive was one of three built for that company in England, in 1828,
under my direction as to plans, which were received in the city of New York early in
the year 1829.

That, through circumstances not necessary to state, I ran the locomotive myself, a
responsibility I had never undertaken before and have never repeated since.

Thus, on this first movement by steam on railroads on this continent, I was en-
gineer, brakeman, conductor, and passenger.

HORATIO ALLEN.

Mr. J. E. WATKINS,

Curator, National Museum, Smithsonian Institution.

It is the intention to mount the boiler on the original driving- wheels,
collected in 1888, and to replace many of the original parts, which are
still in existence, and thus make as complete a restoration of this old
locomotive as possible. The death of Horatio Allen, on the 31st of De-
cember, 1889, is greatly to be regretted. He had hoped to live to see
the work of restoring the “ Stourbridge Lion” accomplished, a matter
in which he took the deepest interest.

Several valuable relics of the early days of the electric telegraph
have been obtained; among them a piece of the original wire used by
Alfred Vail* in his experiments at the Speedwell lron Works, near
Morristown, New Jersey, 1837—43.

_ It was over this wire that the message ‘ A patient waiter is no
loser,” was sent on January 6,1838. The ability to send and decipher
this message was the test by which Judge Stephen Vail (father of
Alired Vail) was induced to furnish funds to Morse and Vail, which
enabled them to prosecute their researches and to construct the tele-
graphic machines which were used in experiments before the Congres-
sional committee at Washington, which finally culminated in the appro-
priation of $30,000 by the general government for the construction of
a telegraph line from Washington to Baltimore, in 1844.

A piece of the wire which formed a part of that original telegraph
line, which ran from Mount Clare depot, Baltimore, to the Capitol at
Washington, and over which the message, “What hath God wrought,”

* See ‘‘ The American Inventors of the Telegraph.”-—The Century, 1883.
H. Mis, 129, pt. 2—11

162 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

was sent by Professor Morse, May 24, 1544, has been presented by Mrs.
Amanda Vail, widow of Alfred Vail, the associate of Professor Morse,
who received and deciphered that historic message at the Baltimore
end of the line. The original telegraphic instrument by which the
message was sent, has been in the collection for some time. ,

One of the first dividing engines, designed and constructed by Jesse
Ramsden, of Piccadilly, London, England, in 1774~75, together with
the apparatus, with which the screws and gear-cutters of the machine
were made, was deposited by Dr. Henry Morton, president of Stevens
Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey.

A sextant, which was graduated by this dividing engine in 1775, was
so accurate that the English Board of Longitude, ‘ever ready to
remunerate any successful endeavor and to promote the lunar method
of determining longitude by sea,” conferred a reward of £615 to Rams-
den on condition that the engine should be at the service of the English
instrument makers, and that he should publish an explanation of his
method of making and using it. A quarto pamphletcontaining this in-
formation was published in 1777, with a preface prepared by Nevil
Maskeline, astronomer royai, dated Greenwich, November 28, 1776.
It is interesting to note in this connection that the circles of the great
theodolite, with a 36-inch telescope (still preserved at Greenwich),
which was specially constructed in 1785 for the Trigonometrical Sur-
vey of Great Britain, was graduated by this engine. .

The machine by which the endless screw for the dividing engine was
cut, is of the greatest importance, for it is one of the earliest applica-
tions of the principle of changing the lateral speed of the tool by differ-
ential wheels in screw-cutting—the method now used in the slide-rest
of the machinist’s lathe. This machine, which has been developed and
improved, has proved of incalculable advantage to the mechanical engi-
neer and machinist.

CONDITION OF THE COLLECTION.

The study series, composed mainly of graphic illustrations, has been
increased by a number of photographs, prints, ete.

The card-catalogue of the collection, commenced during the year, has
been finished far enough to indicate that the approximate number of
specimens in the collection is 1,250, occupying 880 entries in the eata-
logue.

It is hoped that this catalogue will be completed during the next
fiscal year.
REPORT ON THE SECTION OF FORESTRY IN THE
U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

By B. E. FERNow, Honorary Curator.

Progress in the development of the collections during the year has
been slow for various reasons. It had been expected that the material
used in the exhibit for the World’s Exposition at Paris would be re-
turned and form a desirable basis and an acceptable beginning for
asystematic Museum exhibit. The bulk of the material, however, was,
at the request of the Director of the Jardin des Plantes at Paris,
turned over to that institution, and in this way not only the labor
bestowed upon its collection was lost to the Museum, but also the time
in waiting for its return.

The accessions to the forestry collections during the year have come
from the Department of Agriculture. The material from the same
souree used in the exhibit described in my last year’s report, did not
receive any accession numbers, and is therefore included with the
accessions of this year.*

Ace. 23584: Twenty-seven photo-lithographs, selections from the atlas
of illustrations accompanying the French Government report on * Re-
boisement et Gazonnement des Montagnes” and the Austrian report on
the same subject, exhibiting etfects of forest destruction and methods
of reforestation, etc.

Acc, 23585: One section of Liriodendron Tulipifera (Tulip Poplar), 5
feet in diameter, with historical chart of growth.

Ace. 23586: Two half-sections of Picea Menziesii (Sitka Spruce), 2.311
metres in diameter, gift of the Northern Pacific Railroad.

Ace. 23587: Two maps from the atlas accompanying the Tenth Census
reports, volume Ix, on the Forests of North America, showing distri-
bution of forest areas and forest types.

Ace. 23796: Large map of the United States (12 by 17 feet), showing,
in five shades of color, proportion of forest area in each state, and
localities of greatest density of forest-growth, by markings.

164 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

Ace, 23589: One hundred small label maps (6 by 6 inches) showing |
geographical distribution of the more important trees.

During the year five exhibits were installed. To the panel exhibit-
ing the forestry interests of the United States, two maps from the Census
work were added, showing the distribution of forest, prairie, and plain,
and of the different forest types as described by Prof. C. 8. Sargent.
The large map (No. 23796) which is displayed, gives, at one glance, an
idea of the forest conditions over the United States. -

A collection of Japanese woods, 838 species, a catalogue of which, as
determined by Prof. L. F. Ward, will be found in the Proceedings of
the National Museum for 1881, is displayed in a new shape, being
mounted in glass cases attached to the new type of large movable
panels, which were originally designed by the writer. This collection
is mainly interesting on account of the ingenious and artistic manner
in which the botanical features are connected, by paintings, with an
exhibit of the woods.

The collection of woods of the United States from the Centennial
Exposition, transferred from the collections of the Department of
Agriculture, is arranged in four cases, with label-maps, showing dis-
tribution of more important species. This collection is quite incom-
plete, and the display only a temporary one, until the material for a
fuller exhibit can be gathered and mounted.

The colored plates of Michaux’s Sylva (No. 23588), were mounted
in twenty swinging frames.

It will appear from this report that the forestry collections are still
in an embryonic condition, as is the whole subject of forestry in the
United States. Whatever material was found on hand—although if
space and assistance were plentiful, interesting exhibits might be made
of it—lacks in completeness or instructive value for one reason or
another, and needs considerable additions and work before being fit
for installation. To overhaul and complete this material, it has so far
not been possible, for want of sufficient time from other duties on the
part of the curator.

It will be desirable to devote, as soon as possible, some time and
space to secure a full botanical exhibit of the arborescent flora of the
- United States, similar to the one exhibited at the Paris Exposition, and
a more comprehensive exhibit of the most important timber trees which
constitute the resource from which the lumber market is supplied. To
do this properly, an assistant, conversant with botany and skillful in
mounting specimens for the purpose, will be necessary.

Perhaps one of the most valuable collections on hand is that of the
test pieces which served in the determination of the properties of our
timbers for the Tenth Census. These should be suitably mounted in
such a manner as to facilitate the study of these timbers, and I suggest
that an expenditure of money for this purpose will be well directed in
preserving a historical collection of valuable test pieces.
REPORT ON THE SECTIONS OF FOODS AND TEXTILES
IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

By Romyn Hirceucock, Curator.

At the beginning of the year a large collection of material of the most
varied character was piled up in the utmost confusion on the east bal-
cony, just as it had come from storage in the Armory building. The
entire month of July was occupied in examining these specimens.
Much of the material was condemned by a committee appointed for
the purpose. Some of it was prepared for exhibition, but the greater
part was placed in table cases. Four boxes, containing more than 250
specimens, were packed and sent to Sibley College, Cornell University.
Oiher duplicate specimens were also packed and held for future ex-
changes. The material in the tab’e cases has since been carefully
examined, nearly every specimen having passed through my hands, and
classified. By farthe greater part of it has been mounted in bottles or
boxes, so that it can be immediately placed on exhibition when space
and cases are available. In addition to this there have been index-
slips prepared, which show at a glance the location of each specimen,
whether in the reserve, study, or duplicate series. There has also been
prepared a list of all specimens on exhibition.

The collection of foods of the North American Indians is now perma-
nently labeled. The textiles collection is fairly well labeled, and it is
expected that in a short time all the specimens will have printed labels.
The plan has been followed for some time back, of preparing labels for
the printer for each new specimen mounted and exhibited. The entire
exhibit of gums and resins recently installed will soon be labeled.

Many labels have been written for specimens which are not in my
custody. The entire collection from the Ainos has thus been labeled,
as well as some of the Japanese articles collected by me.

Mr. Luscombe has made for the Museum, from my own photographs
and measurements, a model of one of the pit-dwellings or earth-houses,
occupied by the Kurile Islanders now settled on theisland of Shikotan,
Japan. He has also made a model of an Aino house and its surround-
ings, including a bear-cage, sacred-hedge, and store-house. This is an
excellent and faithful representation of a Yezo house.

Mr. Mills has made a most admirable lay figure of an Aino, from one

of my photographs.
165
166 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

J have completed two reports for publication by the Museum, embody-
ing the results of my observations in Japan during the years 1887 and
1888. These are entitled respectively, “The Ancient Pit-Dwellers of
Yezo,” and ‘* The Ainos of Yezo,” and are published in this volume.

A list of vegetable productions indigenous to America has been
hastily prepared. It is probably incomplete, owing to the limited time
at my command for its preparation, but it may possess sufficient interest
to deserve notice.

In a letter written to the Assistant Secretary in charge of the Mu-
seum upon the subject I wrote as follows:

Of products indigenous to America, perhaps the potato has been of the greatest
economical importance. When Amcrica was discovered, the Solanum tuberosum was
under cultivation in South America, from Chili to New Granada. It was carried to
Treland by Thomas Herriott, a companion of Sir W. Raleigh in his voyages, from Vir-
ginia in 1585-86. It was introduced first into Europe by the Spaniards in 1585. The
Virginia potato came from -Peru or Chili. The sweet potato is also probably of
American origin.

The haricot bean, now cultivated in so many parts of the world, is unquestionably
of American origin, as is also the Lima bean. ‘The former has been found in ancient
Peruvian graves, and more recently in prehistoric tombs in Alaska. The sugar bean
also originated here.

Indian corn is another valuable product for which the old world is indebted to the
new. The oidest specimen of corn known was discovered by Darwin in the soil of
the coast of Peru, now 85 feet above the level of the ocean.

The tomato is also a Peruvian plant. Tapioca is obtained from the manioe, a
shrub indigenous to Brazil and the West Indies. The flour known as cassava was
in use long before the coming of the Spanish and Portuguese navigators. West
India arrowroot also originated in the West Indies and tropical America, where it
has long been under cultivation. The cacao tree was under cultivation when A:nerica
was discovered. It was probably introduced in Central America and Yucatan from
New Granada, but it was already naturalized when the Spaniards came and the
custom of drinking chocolate was general. When the seeds were sent to the high-
lands of Mexico, they were so highly valued as to serve for money. Cocoa and
chocolate are now of great commercial value. The sweet cocoa butter is highly
prized in pharmacy.

The common squash and pumpkin appear to be American productions. It is per-
haps not desirable to extend this list of strictly American vegetable productions to
include many less commonly known. There are numerous tropical fruits which are
not only very delicious in the fresh condition, but also when preserved. Among
these the guava is well known in the form of jelly. Two-thirds of the coffee pro-
duced in the world comes from South America, Central America, and the West Indies.

Caoutchouc, or India rubber, was introduced in Europe about the beginning of
the eighteenth century, but for a long time its source was unknown. Finally it was
learned that it came from South America, and at present nearly half the world’s
supply comes from there, the other half principally from Java.

Among the medicinal agents, it is only necessary to mention two—the cocoa or cuca
of Pern, and the cinchona bark. The former isan important and valualie tonie which
has grown into great fayor. The benefit which the world has derived from the alka-
loids of cinchona or Peruvian bark can scarcely be overestimated. The name “ cin-
chona” is said to be derived from the name of the wife of the Viceroy of Peru, who
brought the drug from South America in 1639.

In considering the contributions of this continent to the commerce of the world,
it would not be fair to neglect many articles which are not peculiar to this country,
SECTIONS OF FOODS AND TEXTILES. 167%

such as valuable timber, cochineal, vanilla beans, and the commoner fruits, as ban-
anas, pineapples, oranges, etc. Among the important productions, the beautiful
sea-island cotton need only be mentioned. The first bale of long staple cotton was
shipped from St. Simons Island, Georgia, in 1788. Of other textiles, tropical and sub-
tropical, America has furnished an abundance. The streets of London are daily
swept with brooms made of the fiber of the piassava palm of Brazil. The pita and
jeniquen, and many other fibers come from Mexico and Central America. The
trade in fresh meat and hides from South America is already very large, and constantly
on the increase. i

The discovery of. America has not only improved, increased, and cheapened the
food supply of the world, but it has also, by opening new territory for settlement,
relieved the countries of Europe of an increasing burden of overpopulation and
thereby prevented social changes, wars and revolutions, which the increased struggle
for existence would otherwise have brought about.

ACCESSIONS.

The following are among the more important accessions received dur-
ing the year:

A specimen of Germanium, a new metal discovered in 1886 by Dr. Clemens Winkler.
Gift of Dr. C. Winkler, through Prof. F. W. Clarke. (Cat. No. 78072.)

Cerium. Gift of Dr. W. F. Hillebrand. (Cat. No. 78073).

Lanthanum. Gift of Dr. W. F. Hillebrand. (Cat. No. 78074.)

Didymium. Gift of Dr. W. F. Hillebrand. (Cat. No. 78075.)

These three metals. from Dr. Hillebrand are of especial interest, not
only because of their purity and compact form, but because they have
been the subject of original researches conducted by Hillebrand and
Norton in 1875. Specimens of the oxides of the same metals, interest-
ing in the same connection, are also credited to Dr. Hillebrand.
Magnesium, purified by distillation in vacuo. Gift of W.M. Burton. (Cat. No. 78080.)
Zine, purified by distillation in vacuo, in fine crystals. Gift of W.M. Burton. (Cat.

No. 78081.)
Zine, purified by distillation in vacuo in compact form. Giftof W.M. Burton. (Cat.
No. 78082. )

The specimens of magnesium and zine from Mr. Burton are such as
were used by him in recent re-determinations of the atomic weights of
these metals. They are all excellent specimens.

A most valuable collection of fibers from the Hawaiian Islands was
received from Mr. Francis Gay, of Kauai, through the kind courtesy
and assistance of Prof. H. ©. Bolton, when he visited those islands. A
list of these fibers, with the native names, is given below.

Akia, Wickstremia fetida, var. Oahuensis Gr. Used for twine and rope.

Awapuhi, Zingiber Zerumbet Roscoe. Roots, stems, and leaves. Used only for scent-
ing the native bark cloth, ‘‘ Kapa.”

Han, Paritiwm tiliaceum St. Hil. Used for ropes.

Hona, one of the Urticaces, not determined. Used for ropes.

Mamaki, Pipterus albidus. One of the principal kapa plants.

Mao, Gossypium tomentosum Nutt. The cotton is not used for weaving. The flowers

are used for dyeing kapa, and the fiber of the stem for twine.
Niu, Cocoanut, The fiber is named ‘ Aha-nin.”

Olona, Touchardia latifolia Gaud. The strongest Hawaiian fiber. Used for fish-
lines, nets, etc.
168 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

Olena, Curcuma longa. Roots used for dyeing kapa.

Uki, Gahnia Beecheyi Mann. A grass, used to make cords for binding grass-thatched
roots.

Wauke, Broussonetia papyrifera Vent. Used for ropes, but particularly for making
Kapa.

PRESENT STATE OF THE COLLECTIONS.

In reporting upon the present state of the collections, itmust be pre-
mised that the figures given do not represent in all cases the whole
number of specimens available for display, for the reason that a con-
siderable number are stored in the Armory building. Among these
should be particularly mentioned a very valuable collection of wools,
the gift of Mr. George W. Bond, of Boston, which could be placed im-
mediately on exhibition, if the necessary space could be provided. The
figures given, therefore, represent only specimens which are now in the
Museum, and which can be seen and examined at any time.

This collection does not include a number of specimens collected by
me from the Ainos of Japan, which are exhibited in the Aino ease,
and do not appear in the food catalogue.

The specimens are distributed in different parts of the Museum,
although most of them are in cases in the northeast court.

It should be stated that the collection illustrating the composition of
the human body and of foods is in two cases which are too small to
permit of a proper display of their contents, and the collection, which
SECTIONS OF FOODS AND TEXTILES. 169

is of great public interest even as it is shown, is less attractive than it
should be. There is no space in the hall for an additional case, how-
ever, and therefore no encouraging prospect for a better display in the
near future. In these cases are shown the constituents of the human
body and of foods, in such amanner as to illustrate the subject of nutri-
tion and the value of food. There are several series of specimens, ar-
ranged in the following order:

(1) Chemical elements shown in the proportions by weight in which
they exist in the human body. The plan and design of this exhibit
will be clearly understood from one of the labels which reads as
follows:

. CHEMICAL ELEMENTS OF THE HUMAN BODY.

CARBON.

The body of a man weighing 154 pounds would con-
tain about 31 pounds of Carbon, which amount is shown
in the form of anthracite coal.

The diamond is nearly pure carbon. Graphite (the so-called “ black
lead” of lead pencils), Anthracite Coal, Coke, Lamp-black, and Charcoal
are impure forms of carbon.

Carbon exists in combination with other elements in the body, of which
it makes about one-fifth the whole weight, and in food.

Carbon burns, 7. é., combines, with oxygen. In this combustion, heat
and force are generated and carbonic acid gas formed. The carbon taken
into the body in food is burned in this way by the oxygen of the inhaled
air, yielding heat to keep the body warm, and force, muscular strength,
for work. The carbonic acid is given out by the lungs and skin. Car-
bon thus serves as fuel for the body and is the most important fuel
element.

(2) Chemical compounds in the human body, shown in their proper
proportions. A specimen label reads:

CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS OF THE HUMAN BODY.

NEUTRAL FATS.

The body of a man weighing 154 pounds contains
about 222 pounds of fat, the quantity shown.
Human fat consists of Stearin, Palmitin, and Olein,

‘i

7
170 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

the so-called neutral fats, in varying proportions in dif-
ferent parts.
The fats are formed in the body partly from the fatty matter of the

food, and partly from the carbohydrates (sugar and starch) and the
protein of the food.

The fats are composed of glycerine combined with a fat-acid from
which the fat takes its name, as stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid.

COMPOSITION OF NEUTRAL FATS.

CARBON, 76.5 per cent.
OXYGEN, WALD 08 —
HYDROGEN, TYG 0 ee GO

(3) Daily income and expenditure of the body.

OXYGEN OF DAILY INCOME.
30.2 OUNCES.

The total quantity of this gas, 30.2 ounces, is 159 gal-
lons. The quantity shown is only one-hundredth of
that amount, or 0.3 of an ounce. This oxygen is ob-
tained from the air, one-fifth of which is oxygen.

The oxygen is taken into the lungs and brought in contact with the blood,
by which a portion is dissolved and distributed through the body. It is thus
brought in contact with the digested food and with the tissues in various parts
of the body, and combines with the carbon and hydrogen, forming carbonic
acid and water, thus generating heat and muscular energy.

CARBONIC ACID OF DAILY EXPENDITURE.

38.8 OUNCES.

Nearly all the carbon consumed by the body, except
the small quantity that passes into urea, combines with
oxygen and forms carbonic acid, which 1s thrown off.
The total quantity of this gas, 39 ounces, is about 150
gallons. The quantity shown is only one-hundredth of
that amount, 0.39 of an ounce.

JOMPOSITION OF CARBONIC ACID GAS.

In 100 parts. In 38.8 ounces.
CARBON, 27.0 10.6
OXYGEN, 72.7 28.2
SECTIONS OF FOODS AND TEXTILES. 171

Carbonic acid is 4 colorless gas, heavier than air. The protein, fats,
and carbohydrates of the daily income contain 10.8 ounces of carbon.
Of this 0.2 of an ounce goes to form urea, and the rest combines with
the oxygen of the air inhaled and forms 38.8 ounces of carbonic acid,
which is given off through the lungs.

(4) A day’s ration.

8 OUNCES.

The principal nutrients of meat are protein and fat.
The composition of a round steak of beet, free from
bone, is as follows:

Protein, chiefly myosin and syntonin 23.0 1.9 ounces
NUTRIENTS Fats 9.0 OMe ates

Mineral matters 1.3 (059 Lert
WATER 66.7 Seo nes

(5) Composition of a loaf of bread.

PROTEIN OF A POUND OF BREAD
1.4 OUNCES.

The protein of bread is chiefly gluten, the proportion of
which is variable. An average of several analyses showed 8.9
per cent., the proportion shown.

The protein of wheat consists of several albuminoids, the principal of which are gluten
casein, gluten fibrin, gliadin, and mucedin. ‘These together are known as gluten or vege-
table albumen. ‘They are similar to the albuminoids of meat. Gluten imparts tenacity to
the dough and enables it to retain the gaseous products of fermentation with some force, thus
producing a porous and light bread.

(6) Constituents of a mackerel weighing 1 pound.

PROTEIN OF A POUND MACKEREL
1.6 OUNCES.

The flesh of a mackerel of average composition, weighing
one pound, would contain about 1.6 ounces of protein, the
quantity shown.

The protein of the flesh of fish is very similar to that of the flesh of domestic animals used
for food. It is found mostly in the muscles and consists of several compounds. ‘The prin-
cipal of these compounds is called myosin, the basis of muscle of man and animals. The
protein compounds, sometitnes called “ flesh formers ’’ or “‘ muscle substance,” are physiolog-
ically the most important and pecuniarily the most expensive ingredients of food.
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

(7) Composition of milk.

A QUART OF MILK.

ALBUMINOIDS OR PROTEIN COMPOUNDS. ALBU-
MEN, 0.2 OUNCES.

The albumen, which is of one of the albuminoid or protein
compounds of milk, is nearly or quite identical in chemical
composition with the albumen (white) of egg and the albumen
of blood, muscle, etc.

The proportions of albumen and other albuminoids in milk
are stated under casein. A quart of cow’s milk, of average
composition, would contain not far from 0.2 of an ounce of al-
bumen, the quantity shown. E

Four colored charts showing the composition and nutritive value of
vegetable and animal foods have been carefully prepared. These are
now in the eases.

174 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

The object of this arrangement is to indicate gaps in che series of
known elements which are likely to be filled in future by the discovery
of new elements, the properties of which may be foretold with more or
less certainty from their position in the series.

The existence of the three metals, scandium, gallium, and germanium,
was thus predicted before they were discovered.

The position of some of the elements in the table is not yet well estab-
lished. The metals in the last row are provisionaily placed in groups
by themselves.

The specimens here brought together under the head of chemical
collections are catalogued in different registers. The last entries under
the respective heads are—

A specimen label will indicate the general character of all. Such
labels are usually attached to bottles, and as these are never large, it is
necessary to condense the text of the labels as much as possible.

ERMANIUM, Ge.—Valency 4; atomic weight 72; specific
gravity 5.469 at 209.4 C.

A grayish-white, lustrous, crystalline, brittle metal, easily pul-
verized, discovered by C. Winkler in 1886, in argyrodite, a
mineral found near Freiberg, of which it constitutes about
7 per cent. Unchanged in air, soluble in aqua regia. Fuses
readily. 78,072.

Gift of Dr. C. WinKLER through Prof. F. W. Ciarke.

Specimen prepared by C. WINKLER.

The existence of this element was predicted from the atomic rela-
tions of the elements as shown by Mendelejeft’s table.

A system of classification for organic and inorganic compounds will
soon be necessary, and will be prepared as soon as time and opportunity
may permit.

A preliminary plan for an exhibit at the World’s Columbian Exposi-
tion at Chicago, illustrating chemistry and the chemical industries, has
been prepared.

All the collections are now in excellent order. A large and valuable
industrial exhibit could be very quickly made if floor-space and cases
could be provided. Many of the specimens are already mounted and
stored in drawers, ready to be placed in cases and labeled.
REPORT ON THE SECTION OF MATERIA MEDICA
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890,

By James M. FLInT, U. 8S. Navy, Honorary Curator.

During the past year the labors of the curator, with such clerical
assistance as may have been available or necessary, have been devoted
to the identification, arrangement, distribution, illustration, and de-
scription of the individual specimens which make up the large mass of
material already in hand; to the classification and installation of new
material; to the care and convenient arrangement of duplicate and
reserve series; and to the consideration of such questions of identity
or uses of drugs, as have been referred, irom time to time, to this
Section.

The principal accessions have been: A collection (about 30 specimens)
of East India drugs, received m exchange from the Royal Botanical
Gardens, Kew, England, and about 80 specimens of miscellaneous me-
dicinal substances contributed by Messrs. W. H. Schieftelin & Co., of
New York, to fill vacancies in existing series. Both accessions have
been installed and labeled.

The most important routine work has been the preparation of de-
scriptive labels, which work has been systematically and persistently
carried on during the year. Each label, in its preparation, involves
the study of the specimen, the comparison of its physical characters
with those laid down by the authorities, the determination of its sources,
(geographical, botanical, etc.),and of its supposed medicinal properties
and uses. The effort is made to select the most important and inter-
esting facts that can be presented in the few lines appropriate to a
museum label, avoiding on the one hand that meagerness which

gives the inquiring visitor nothing but a name, and, on the other, that
fullness of detail which discourages by its length, or confuses by its
technical precision.

Of these labels there have been prepared, printed, and attached to
the specimens 2,312, distributed as follows:

176 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

The present state of the collection is quite satisfactory to the cura-
ator. Most of the specimens are in good conJition, and liable only to
unavoidable deterioration from age, exposure to light, and changes of
temperature. It is to be hoped that a substitute for the present cylin-
drical bottle may be devised for exhibition purposes, whereby the speci-
mens may be shown behind plane instead of curved surfaces of glass.
There are now on exhibition 3,213 specimens of drugs, classified as

Such was the list of organized International Congresses as published

before the opening of the Exposition.

There were others organized

after this list was printed ; and during the. continuance of the Exposi-
tion no less than one hundred and twenty congresses, principally
international, though similar to the foregoing, were held at Paris.

The congresses to which I was accredited, and in most of which
Prof. Otis T. Mason joined, held their sessions as follows:

Hygiene and Demography, opening session on Sunday, August 4, at
3 o’clock, to continue until the 11th of the same month.

Criminal Anthropology, opening session on Saturday, August 10, at 2
o'clock, at the Palace of Trocadéro, to continue until the 17th, at the

School of Medicine.

Anthropology and Prehistoric Archeology, opening session on Mon-
day, August 19, to continue until August 26, at the College of France.
The French Association for the Advancement of Science held its ses-
sion from the 8th to the 16th of August at the School of Bridges and

Roads, No. 28, rue St. Péres.
mencing at 9 a.m. and 2 p. m.

Two sessions per day were held, com-

I presented papers, prepared by myself, to the various congresses, as

follows:

Criminal Anthropology, 8 pages: (1) The statistics of crime in the

United States.

Anthropology and Prehistoric archeology: (1) The gravels of the
DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 181

Delaware River at Trenton, New Jersey, wherein Dr. Abbott had found
paleolithic implements, 20 pages; (2) The stone age in North America
divided into the paleolithic and neolithic periods, as manifested by
specimens in the U.S. National Museum (130 pages, 100 figures).

Association Frangaise: (1) The value of Niagara Falls as a chro-
nometer of antiquity (12 pages, 5 figures); (2) Instruments of hard
stone in America (14 pages).

Since my return I have completed a report upon Prehistoric Anthro-
pology at the Paris Exposition, 1889, and upon the International Con-
gresses of Anthropology and Prehistoric Archeology ; Criminal An-
thropology ; Hygiene and Demography.

IMPORTANT ACCESSIONS.

From Mr. H. de Morgan, New York, New York, was purchased a collec-
tion of objects from prehistoric graves at or near Allah- Verdi, Armenia,
including bronze necklaces, bracelets, buttons, pins (plain and orna-
mented), pendant with chain attached, iron spear-heads and knives,
Sharpening-stones, shell beads, pottery vessels (bottles, urns, and
plates), a human skull and fragments of human bones; 105 specimens.
These objects were discovered and excavated by Mr. de Morgan in the
summer of 1888, and belong to the iron age in Armenia. (Aces, 22244
and 22264.)

J. P. Monroe, Ringgold, Montgomery County, Tennessee, sent a
brass chain of peculiar manufacture from a mound in Montgomery
County, Tennessee. The chain was made of pieces of brass wire and
tubes alternating in the following manner: First, the wire, cut to the
required length, was enlarged at each end; second, a section of the
tube was then, by hammering or pressure, closed around the enlarge-
ment of the wire at one end—not enough to prevent motion inside the
tube, but sufficient to stop its removal. Another wire, being inserted
in the opposite open end of the tube, was made secure in the same way.
This process was continued until the chain was of the required length.
(Ace. 22697.)

From Mr. Monroe’s letter of transmittal I quote the following:

The mound in which the chain was found is situated in the northern part of Mont-
gomery County, 16 miles from Clarksville. It is in a large body of timber and would
be seldom noticed. Its shape is oval and of the following dimensions: 60 by 46 feet
at the base, 16 feet diameter at the top, and 10 feet high.

When first built the mound was higher and not so broad at the base, the rains and
snows of centuries having washed the dirt from the top. Of course this proceeded
very slowly, as the sides are covered with trees and undergrowth, the oak trees
being from | foot to 2 feet 6 inches in diameter. The graves were arranged in the
regulation way, i. e., flat rocks set upon edge, forming a box, in which the body was
laid, and other rocks (slabs) placed across the top. These were near the surface
and disarranged, showing evidently that the mound had been dug into before, and
also accounts for the fact that no other specimens were found associated with the

chain, except some broken pieces of pottery. The chain being very small, was over-
looked by the hunters.

182 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

Mrs. J. G. Bruff, Washington, District of Columbia, sent a largé
collection, principally from the District of Columbia and vicinity,
embracing paleolithic implements, rude notched axes, hammer-stones,
pestles, arrow and spear-points, scrapers, polished stone hatchets,
drilled ceremonial objects, discoidal stones, potstone vessels, ete.; 1,487
specimens. (Acc. 22308.)

This collection, which represents the archeology of the District fairly
well, is the result of many years’ work on the part of Mr. Bruff, and the
specimens are labeled with great accuracy as to locailty, date of find,
and other facts which might be of interest to the student.

The curator deposited a collection of archeological specimens ob-
tained by him during his visit to the International Exposition at Paris
in 1889. The greater portion consists of palzolithic implements of the
Chelleén type, although a number of flint-points and flakes, and a mass
of drift-deposit containing flint implements, etc., were obtained; also
four jars in which are exhibited the sand or gravel forming the differ-
ent layers of the river drift at Chelles, these last showing a difference in
color and fineness according to depth. In addition, a number of palzo-
lithic implements, surface-finds, from St. Acheul, Poitou, and Coussay,
France, and one each from Highfield, Ightham, Buley, and the ‘‘ Stone
Pits,” Kent, England (B. Harrison). The neolithic objects received in-
clude flint cores and flakes—some very large—from the workshops ati
Grand Pressigny and Posay, France, and from the Grotte de Chaleur,
Belgium. Also obsidian cores from the Ile de Milo, Greece, and frag-
ments of pottery from Russia. A bronze hatchet and a piece of copper
(part of an implement) from Peru, complete the list; 99 specimens.
(Ace. 22523.) |

W. Ei. Meyer, Carthage, Tennessee, gave a collection containing frag-
ments of human bones, shell beads, fragments of shell, bones and teeth
of small animals, pieces of stalagmitic formation (?), and flint chips from
caves in the vicinity of Carthage. (Ace. 22771.) In his letter of trans-
mittal he says:

The human bones were found in a small cave on a river bluff, the entrance to whiclz
has been nearly closed by rock falling from above. They were scattered all through
the dirt floor of the cavern and had no regular arrangement, neither were they found
in such positions as to indicate burial (at least soitappeared tome). At the farthest
extremity of the cave there is an opening —closed now—which communicated with
the top of the bluff. I do not think all of the bones were washed in, for we found a
few in such positions that it would seem impossible. The animal bones came trom

another cavern, also on the face of a river bluff,and in the dirt floor at the depth
indicated.

From Messrs. Bangs & Co. (739 and 741 Broadway, New York, New
York) the following objects were purchased for the Museum:* Arrow
and spear-points, scrapers, knives, perforators, large spade-like imple-
ments (chipped), flint hatchets—some with ground cutting edge—pol-
ished hatchets, grooved axes of hematite, pierced tablets, and boat-

shaped articles, pendants, drilled ceremonial objects, stone tubes and
pipes, hematite mullers, and discoidal stones; 171 specimens in all.
The localities where found are indicated in all cases. (Acc. 22813.)

S. V. Proudfit, Falls Church, Virginia, deposited a large collection
(2,345 specimens) from the District of Columvia and its environs, consist-
ing of arrow and spear-points, knives, rude implements (palolithic
type), scrapers, perforators, hammer-stones, pitted stones, polished
hatchets, grooved axes, rnde notched implements, mortars, pestles,
pierced tablets, ceremonial objects, fragments of potstone vessels, and
fragments of pottery. This collection is the result of years of work in
the field, and is a valuable addition to the Museum, for it represents
the archeology of the District of Columbia in acomplete manner. (Ace.
22631).

Peabody Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts, through Prof. F. W.
Putnam, sent in exchange a collection from the ancient cemetery and
ashpits at Madisonville, Ohio, embracing stone hatchets, hammer and
sharpening-stones, small rude implements, scrapers, perforators, and

_ arrow-points of flint and jasper, clay vessels, and fragments of pottery.

Also halves of the bone-scrapers peculiar to this cemetery, worked pieces
of antler (chisels and points of weapons), cylindrical pieces of antler,
burnt bones, piece of bone ornamented with incised lines, bird bone show-
ing method of cutting off a bead, bone beads and points, bone splinters—
long, thin, and worked to a point at each end—fish spines probably used
as awls, bones and teeth of animals, burnt corn, and a sample of ashes
from one of the pits; 324 specimens. (Ace. 25111).

Dr. Hilborn T. Cresson, No. 224 South Broad street, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, deposited paleolithic implements found below the sur-
face in undisturbed gravel at the depths indicated: quartzite, Up-

- land, Chester County, Pennsylvania, 8 feet; quartzite, Upland, Ches-

ter County, Pennsylvania, 11 feet; quartzite, Gray’s Ferry, Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad cut, 4 feet; quartzite, Gray’s Ferry, Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad cut, 6 feet; quartzite, Gray’s Ferry, Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad cut, 7$ feet; quartzite, Naaman’s Creek cut, 52 feet; quartz-
ite, near Darley’s Bridge cut, 34 feet; quartzite, Peat Layer, near Dar-
ley’s Bridge, dredged, 10 feet; quartzite, Naaman’s Creek, near Rich-
mond Brickyard, 14 feet; quartzite, near Wilmington, Delaware, 8
feet; quartzite, near Wilmington, Delaware, 12 feet; white quartz,
talus, at base of cut, Upland, Chester County, Pennsylvania; argillite,
talus, at base of cut, Uarpenter’s Station, near Darley’s Bridge, Balti-
more and Ohio Railroad; quartzite, surface, Piney Branch, District of
Columbia, 14 specimens in all. (Acc. 23198.) These implements are
only deposited as a loan by Dr. Cresson, though I have no doubt he
will permit them to remain indefinitely. Although few in number and
their money-value not great, I can scarcely overestimate their scientific
value. They are the first implements found in undisturbed clay and
gravel, independent of any glacial action, and I see no reason why they

are not preglacial. They correspond in appearance and industry with
184 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1890.

those which I have been already gathering on the surface throughout
the United States, and { can only conclude that they belong to the
same epoch.

L. H. Jammes, Realmont, Tarn, southwestern France, sent a collec-
tion of prehistoric implements, ornaments, etc., from Cambodia, Indo-
China. This accession includes stone hatchets (five of which are a talon,
a type peculiar to Indo-China), gouges, sling-stones, pierced disks, and
bracelets cf stone, beads of bone and shell, a bone fish-hook, a bone
arrow-point, a harpoon, ear ornaments of pottery, a clay vessel, frag-
ments of pottery, lower jaw and part of human skull, pieces of a large
shell—worked—and a mass of shell formation containing fragments of
worked bone; 176 specimens. (Acc. 23024.)

Duplicate specimens have been sent in exchange as follows:

To Edward Lovett, West Burton House, Outram Road, Croydon,
England (97 specimens).

To Prof. Henry Giglioli, director of the Zodlogical Museum, Royal
University, Florence, Italy (12 specimens).

To Frederic Shonnard, Yonkers, New York (6 specimens).

To Mr. Henry Balfour, Anthropological Department, Oxford OL TET
sity, England (7 specimens).

To Dr. Paulo Mantegazza, professor of anthropology, Florence, Italy
(55 specimens).

The routine work and the preparation of the exhibition and study-
series has been carried on during the past fiscal year upon the same
basis and with the same organization as in past years, and as I found
it when I came into the Museum. All specimens received are entered
in the catalogue, giving all known information concerning them, their
discovery, locality, association, etc. A catalogue number is given to
every Specimen and is painted upon the specimen itself. If there are
a number of specimens of not great importance, which correspond in
all general characteristics, they may be all given the same number. In
former years nothing but the number was required; now the State is
added, and if the object is a gift, the name of the donor.

The record taken from the monthly reports of this office shows that
there have been 431 letters written to correspondents. The letters and
reports written to officers in the Museum is not included in this num-
ber. Since February, when a record of such matters was first kept,
2,430 pages of type writing have been written.

The general character of the work in this department must necessarily -
be much the same one year with another. There is the same reception
of specimens, their entering, numbering, marking, and display. This
year has, however, seen much work done in addition to this. Al-
though not perfected, we have partially carried out the new scheme
of organization which was advised by Dr. Rau in his last report, and
which has been mentioned in all my reports since: 7. e., the arrange-
ment of specimens according to their geographical location. The sys-
DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 185

tem adopted in the early history of the Museum was to note only the
State from which the specimen came. The locality within the State
was not usually given. Therefore we find ourselves hampered in mak-
ing the geographical distribution more minute than by States, however
desirable this may be. We may be able to make the distribution more
in detail which, while it will entail much work and require considerable
time, will be correspondingly valuable when completed. It is my pres-
ent intention to pursue this scheme of localized distribution as far as
possible, so as to include what we may suppose to have been the territo-
ries occupied by one prehistoric tribe or people and to make the bound-
aries such as were established by nature and what we may suppose
divided the tribes. The intended units of display will therefore include
the valleys of rivers, both sides of the river being equally represented.
For example, the Susquehanna River should be represented as a unit
independently of the boundary line of Maryland and Pennsylvania
which cross it; the same with the Delaware River independent of the
boundary line between Pennsylvania and Delaware.

The dividing line between these units might be such natural obstacles
as the Allegheny Mountains, the Chesapeake Bay, etc., which may be
supposed to have served as frontiers of greater or less obstruction, and
so to have divided the prehistoric tribes or peoples. But this is a
scheme in the indefinite future, and is liable to modification.

EXHIBITION AND STUDY SERIES.

The exhibition series is arranged in cases with a view to showing the
industries of prehistoric man, divided according to epochs and geo-
graphic location. The subject of the division of museums according to
the object desired and the people to be benefited, has been presented and
argued many times. An exhibition series should be provided for the
average visitor who has but a few minutes to devote to the display; while
a Study series should be for the student who desires better instruction in
the scientific aspect of the case. This division has never been made in
my department until the present fiscal year. Ihave always recognized
its benefit, even its necessity, and therefore determined that, laying
aside all other work, I would arrange a series of specimens as a
museum for exhibition and public instruction. This I have called a
Synoptical case or series of cases. I have made use of four double
Sloping-top cases, which placed end to end make a continuous
Series across the hall. On the side nearest the door and first of ap-
proach, are arranged specimens from other countries than America,
upon the farther side specimens from America. The European speci-
mens are divided according to their respective ages ; paleolithic, neo-
lithic, and bronze. Each of these ages is again divided into epochs,
and the epochs are divided into countries and according to localities.
I do not burden this report with detailed descriptions cf these sub-
divisions. Suffice it to say that nearly every country in Europe is rep-
