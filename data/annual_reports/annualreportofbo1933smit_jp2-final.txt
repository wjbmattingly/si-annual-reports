REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

C. G. ABBOT
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1933

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith my report
showing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution
and the Government bureaus under its administrative charge during
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1933. In part 1 the first 11 pages
contain a summary account of the affairs of the Institution, and
appendixes 1 to 10 give more detailed reports of the operations of the
National Gallery of Art, the Freer Gallery of Art, the Bureau of
American Ethnology, the International Exchanges, the National
Zoological Park, the Astrophysical Observatory, the Division of
Radiation and Organisms, the United States Regional Bureau of
the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, the Smithsonian
Library, and of the publications issued under the direction of the
Institution; part 2 contains the report of the United States National
Museum, hitherto a separate document. On page 188 is the financial
report of the executive committee of the Board of Regents, hitherto a
separate document.

PART 1. REPORT ON THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
AND ALL THE BUREAUS UNDER ITS DIRECTION EX-
CEPT THE NATIONAL MUSEUM

SUMMARY OF THE YEAR’S ACTIVITIES

Outstanding events —Mr. Eldridge R. Johnson placed his yacht and
a considerable sum of money at the disposal of the Institution for the
first of a series of scientific cruises in the interests of oceanography.
The first cruise, covering the Puerto Rican deep, returned in March
1933, with highly gratifying results, which will later be described in
Smithsonian publications. The Gellatly collection of art objects,
valued at $4,000,000, given to the Institution by John Gellatly, was
safely transferred from New York to Washington and is now on
public exhibition in the National Gallery of Art. Through the
generous aid of Mr. John A. Roebling, a new astrophysical observing

i
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

station is being equipped on Mount St. Katherine, Sinai Peninsula.
Among the year’s publications were several of special interest from
the plant researches of the Division of Radiation and Organisms, and
the first of the new series, Oriental Studies, issued by the Freer
Gallery of Art, entitled ‘‘The Story of Kalaka”, by W. Norman
Brown.

National Museum.—Available appropriations for the past year
totaled $701,456, or $133,634 less than for the previous year. Addi-
tions to the collections numbered 348,012 specimens. Important
anthropological material came from Philippine and South American
Indian tribes and from village sites in Alaska, Texas, Virginia, and
Puerto Rico. Noteworthy biological material received consisted of
mammals from Siam, Java, and British Columbia; birds from Alaska,
Siam, and the southwestern United States; reptiles and amphibians
from the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers and from Puerto Rico
and French Indo China; fishes, mollusks, and marine invertebrates
collected on the Johnson-Smithsonian and Hancock expeditions; the
Owen collection of Lepidoptera (about 40,000 specimens); and 3,600
plants from the historic Mutis Herbarium. In geology many
valuable examples of minerals, gems, ores, and meteorites were
received, and representative lots of fossil plants and animals, including
the most perfect bird skeleton yet collected from the Oligocene of
North America. The industrial collections were augmented by
many generous gifts from commercial firms and individuals, and many
objects of historic interest were received. The number of visitors
for the year totaled 1,427,358.

National Gallery of Art—Dr. William H. Holmes, director of the
Gallery since its creation as a separate unit of the Institution in 1920,
was retired on June 30, 1932, and his death occurred on April 20, 1933.
During the year the Gallery has been under the direction of Ruel P.
Tolman, acting director. Early in the year, a large part of the
Gallery was occupied by exhibits of the National Society of Mural
Painters, the National Sculpture Society, and the alumni of the
American Academy in Rome, in connection with the George Wash-
ington Bicentennial celebration. An exhibition of paintings of
Gaucho life in Argentina, by Sefior Don Cesareo Bernaldo de Quiros,
was held from January 13 to March 13, 1933. The Gellatly collection
was transferred from New York and installed in the Gallery, a special
opening view being held on June 22, 1933. A number of art works
were accessioned by the Institution subject to transfer to tae Gallery
if approved by the National Gallery of Art Commission.

Freer Gallery of Art.—Additions to the collection include a Chinese
bronze vessel from the Chou dynasty; Chinese pottery, porcelain, and
jades; Japanese, Persian, and Arabic illuminated manuscripts; and
Japanese, Persian, and Arabic paintings. Curatorial work has been
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 3

devoted to the critical study of Armenian, Chinese, and Japanese
texts associated with acquisitions, and to the translation of Arabic
and Persian manuscript texts. Visitors totaled 120,732. The
gallery issued “The Story of Kalaka’”’, by W. Norman Brown, the
first volume in its series of Oriental Studies. In spite of disturbed
conditions in China, the field staff of the Gallery conducted archeo-
logical explorations throughout a large part of Shansi Province.

Bureau of American Ethnology—The Bureau continued its studies
of the American Indians, the members of its staff being occupied both
in field work and in preparing for publication the results of their
investigations. Attention was given particularly to the ethnology
of the southeastern Indians, the Cheyenne and Arapaho of the West,
the Foxes of Lowa, the Indians of southern California, and the Iroquois
of New York State and Canada, and to archeological investigations in
Arizona, in Nebraska, and in the mound area of the Mississippi
Valley. In the study of Indian music many songs were recorded
among the tribes in the Gulf States.

International exchanges.—The number of packages handled during
the year, in the official exchange with other countries of parliamentary
and departmental documents and scientific and literary publications,
was 720,209, with a total weight of 634,707 pounds.

National Zoological Park.—A total of 1,330 animals were added
during the year, and 1,136 were removed through various causes,
bringing the collection on June 30, 1933, to 2,496 animals. The
attendance was 2,463,350, including classes from 628 different schools
in various parts of the country. Although no new construction of
buildings was undertaken, a number of needed improvements were
completed, including the laying of a larger water main from the
Connecticut Avenue main, providing a more adequate supply of
water to the west side of the park and greater fire protection.

Astrophysical Observatory.—Progress was made on the dependence
of terrestrial temperature departures on the variation of the sun;
studies were begun on the dependence of terrestrial temperature
departures on the ozone content of the atmosphere; and solar-radiation
observations were continued at Table Mountain, Calif., and Monte-
zuma, Chile. Financed by Mr. John A. Roebling, a new observing
station is being equipped on Mount St. Katherine, near Mount Sinai
in Egypt, under the charge of Harlan H. Zodtner, assisted by Frederick
A. Greeley. A new radiation-measuring instrument, called the
kampometer, has been devised by Dr. Abbot and used with success in
preliminary measurements of the extreme infrared solar spectrum.

Division of Radiation and Organisms.— In March 1933 the Secretary
undertook the general charge of the division, succeeding the former
director, Dr. F. S. Brackett, who continued with the division on a
part-time basis as consulting physicist. Dr. E. S. Johnston was

T2774— 35 2

4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

appointed assistant director. During the year the following lines of
study have been pursued by the scientific staff of the division: The
growth of wheat under measured concentrations of water vapor and
carbonic acid with fixed temperature and illuminated by measured
quantities of light from helium discharge tubes; the improvement in
methods of producing substantially monochromatic light of any
desired wave length for use in plant growth experiments; the propa-
gation of unicellular algae under 12 different varieties of light; the
growth of wheat under outdoor conditions with different concentra-
tions of carbon dioxide; and investigations with the quartz and the
rock salt spectrographs of the absorption energy spectra of organic
substances including the extreme infrared spectrum.

International Catalogue of Scientific Literature —The work of the
United States Bureau in recording current scientific literature of
this country was continued, so that the necessary data may be avail-
able for indexing when it is found possible to resume publication of
the catalogue. Efforts to refinance the organization were unsuccess-
ful, and as Congress failed to provide funds for the continuation of
the United States Bureau, work was suspended at the close of the
fiscal year. It is hoped, however, that the enterprise may eventually
be resumed, as there is nothing to take its place in providing not
only an index, but also a condensed digest, of the world’s scientific
literature.

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of England,
who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America
“to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.” In receiving the property and accepting the trust,
Congress determined that the Federal Government was without
authority to administer the trust directly and, therefore, constituted
an ‘‘establishment’’ whose statutory members are “‘the President, the
Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive
departments.”

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The affairs of the Institution are administered by a Board of
Regents whose membership consists of ‘‘the Vice President, the Chief
Justice, three Members of the Senate, and three Members of the
House of Representatives, together with six other persons other than
Members of Congress, two of whom shall be resident in the city of
Washington and the other four shall be inhabitants of some State,
but no two of them of the same State.” One of the regents is elected
chancellor of the board. In the past the selection has fallen upon the
Vice President or the Chief Justice, and a suitable person is chosen
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 5

by the regents as Secretary of the Institution, who is also secretary
of the Board of Regents, and the executive officer directly in charge
of the Institution’s activities.

A number of changes in the personnel of the Board occurred during
the year. The Hon. John N. Garner, as Vice President, became on
March 4, 1933, a regent of the Institution ex officio. On May 31,
1933, Senator M. M. Logan, of Kentucky, was appointed a regent to
succeed Senator Reed Smoot, whose term as a Senator expired March
3, 1933, and on May 31, 1933, also, Senator David A. Reed, of Penn-
sylvania, was appointed a regent to succeed Senator Claude A.
Swanson, of Virginia, on the latter’s resignation from the Senate.
On March 27, 1933, the Speaker appointed Representative Charles
L. Gifford, of Massachusetts, a regent to succeed Representative
Albert Johnson, of Washington.

The roll of regents at the close of the year was as follows: Charles
Evans Hughes, Chief Justice of the United States, Chancellor; John
N. Garner, Vice President of the United States; members from the
Senate—Joseph T. Robinson, M. M. Logan, David A. Reed; mem-
bers from the House of Representatives—T. Alan Goldsborough,

which the Board, by resolution, made permanent.

The Secretary then presented his annual report, calling particular
attention to the publications issued by the Institution during the year.
Mr. Delano presented the report of the executive committee, a com-
pilation of the financial statistics of the Institution, and the Secretary
then submitted the annual report of the National Gallery of Art
Commission.

The Secretary presented a special report, reviewing the oustanding
~ events of the year, following which Dr. Wetmore, Assistant Secretary,
gave an account of recent exploring and collecting expeditions of the
National Museum.
6 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

The Board adopted a resolution recording its appreciation of the
bequest to the Institution of $100,000 received through the will of
the late Hon. Dwight W. Morrow. The meeting then adjourned, and
the regents viewed the special exhibit in the Secretary’s office illus-
trating various phases of the Institution’s activities.

MATTERS OF GENERAL INTEREST
JOHNSON-SMITHSONIAN DEEP-SEA EXPEDITION

One of the most extensive programs of oceanographic investigation
ever entered into by the Institution was initiated during the year
under the name ‘‘Johnson-Smithsonian Deep-Sea Expedition.”
Mr. Eldridge R. Johnson, of Philadelphia, offered the use of his
yacht Caroline, to be completely equipped at his expense with the
most modern devices for oceanographic work. It is expected to
make cruises in several following years. The work is under the direc-
tion of Dr. Paul Bartsch, curator of the division of mollusks in the
National Museum, and the personnel of the first cruise included
T. T. Brown, Naval Research Laboratory, physicist; E. W. Price,
Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of Agricul-
ture, zoologist; Charles Weber, student at George Washington Univer-
sity, assistant zoologist; Elie Cheverlange, artist; G. R. Goergens,
United States Department of Agriculture, photographer; and A. W.
Wilding, Bureau of American Ethnology, secretary. The Institution
was materially assisted in preparation for the cruise by the Navy
Department, the Department of Agriculture, the Carnegie Institution
of Washington, George Washington University, the Zoological Society
and the Oceanographic Institution of Woods Hole.

The first cruise began at New York, January 21, 1933, and ended
at the navy yard dock in Washington, March 14, most of the nearly
two months being spent in exploring the Puerto Rican deep. The
results of the cruise came fully up to expectations. Dr. Bartsch
reports that the work was concentrated upon the rim of the deep and
that marvelous catches were made, representing all the various
groups of marine organisms from vertebrates down to protozoa, as
well as aquatic plants. About four truckloads of specimens were
carried to the museum.

In addition to actual specimens gathered, three lines of soundings,
235 miles long, were made through the long axis of the deep 20 miles
apart with a sounding station at every 5-mile interval. Some of the
former depths reported were slightly in excess of those which the
Caroline obtained in the same location. It is possible that-the dis-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 7

crepancy may be due to the bending and deflecting of the wire for-
merly used in sounding. All the work in this direction was accom-
plished by means of the echo sounding device installed through the
courtesy of the Navy Department. In using the sonic sounding
machine a vibrant note is sent out by an oscillator, which, upon
reaching the bottom, is reflected therefrom and caught by micro-
phones installed on the ship and then carried to the observer. The
interval between sending out the note and the arrival of the echo
gives data easily translated into the desired depth. By this means
it is easy within a limited number of seconds to determine even the
greatest depth found, which was 4,400 fathoms, that is, about 5
miles. Then, also, the expedition gathered samples of water from
various depths and temperature readings by thermometers specially
designed for the purpose.

Dr. Bartsch states that ‘this expedition has been the finest in which
I have had the opportunity to take part. Mr. Johnson and his son
and the invited guests, Mr. Douglass and family, the members of the
staff, and every individual from the captain to the cabin stewards
did everything in their power to help and thus bent each moment to a
purpose. Aside from the splendid surroundings in which the work
was done, their esprit de corps made the expedition a memorable one.
It will take weeks before all of the elements will have been separated
into the component groups, after which they will be turned over to
specialists for report. Mr. Johnson deserves great credit for spon-
soring this enterprise.”

The preliminary results of this first cruise, particularly the descrip-
tions of the many new forms found, are now being written up and will
be published in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.

REMOVAL OF GELLATLY COLLECTION TO WASHINGTON

Four years after its presentation to the American people through
the Smithsonian Institution, the Gellatly collection of paintings and
art objects was transferred from New York to Washington on April
30, 1933, and opened to the public in the National Gallery of Art on
June 23. Ralph Seymour, curator of the collection for many years
while it was in the possession of Mr. Gellatly, came to Washington
to assist in its unpacking, classification, and preparation for exhibition.

The assembling of this collection, valued at more than $4,000,000,
formed the lifework of Mr. John Gellatly. It comprises more than
1,600 separate pieces, including 145 American paintings in oil, water
color, and pastel; a notable collection of paintings by European
masters; and many interesting and valuable examples of various types
of art objects, including ancient glass, jewelry, period furniture,
sculpture, and tapestries.
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

MARTIN GUSTAV AND CAROLINE RUNICE HANSON FUND

On March 13, 1933, Dr. Adolph M. Hanson, of Faribault, Minn.,
executed a legal assignment to the Smithsonian Institution of all
royalties accruing to him under a patent on his discovery, the isolation
of the parathyroid hormone (extract of parathyroid gland and process
of preparing the same). In making this offer, Dr. Hanson, a lieu-
tenant colonel in the Medical Reserve Corps, United States Army,
stated that he wished the gift to appear as a memorial to his father,
Martin Gustav Hanson, and his mother, Caroline Runice Hanson,
and that he wished the income to be applied ‘‘to some scientific
purpose, preferably in chemistry or medicine.”” He added, “‘I hope
that my example may serve as an inspiration for others in the future
and add to the interest in our National Institution.”

The Institution accepted the gift, and already considerable sums
have been received from royalties. These will be applied to the
scientific work of the Institution, giving preference wherever practi-
cable to researches in chemistry or medicine, in accordance with the
wishes of the donor.

SECOND ARTHUR LECTURE

In 1931 a bequest was received from James Arthur for the promo-
tion of a series of lectures at the Institution dealing with various
aspects of the relation of the sun to the planets, the stars, the weather,
and human life. The second Arthur lecture was delivered by Dr.
Ernest Wiliam Brown, professor of mathematics at Yale University,
on January 25, 1933, under the title ‘‘ Gravitation in the Solar System.”
The lecture will appear later in one of the Institution’s series of
publications.

WALTER RATHBONE BACON TRAVELING SCHOLARSHIP

Mr. Alan Mozley, of the department of zoology of Johns Hopkins
University, was awarded the Walter Rathbone Bacon scholarship for
1932 and 1933, and later this award was extended to cover 1934 also.
Mr. Mozley is pursuing a faunistic study of the Siberian nonmarine
mollusks. Regarding the importance of this work, Mr. Mozley says:

“The study of this problem is especially important, since in the
sub-Arctic we have the unique opportunity of investigating a fauna
in the making. The whole of this region has only recently become
habitable for mollusks, so that we are dealing, as it were, with an
experiment in zoogeography, and there is an absolutely unparalleled
opportunity for studying geographic distribution without the host of
unknown geologic and geographic factors which often result in specu-
lations which belong more in the realm of nature study or natural
mythology than in science.”

At the close of the year Mr. Mozley was still engaged in field work
in Siberia.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9

SMITHSONIAN EXHIBIT AT THE CENTURY OF PROGRESS EXPOSITION,
CHICAGO

The general theme of the Federal exhibits at the Century of Progress
Exposition was the portrayal of the contributions made by govern-
mental agencies toward the advancement of science and the progress
of civilization during the past 100 years. To be in unison with this
theme the exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution was made up of two
parts; first, a brief pictorial account of the Institution’s founding and
of some of its outstanding achievements in the past, and second, a
representation with original material of some of the current activities
of the Institution and its seven branches.

The first or pictorial part of the exhibit consists of nine oil paintings,
40 by 30 inches in size. The first of these entitled ‘‘ President Jackson
Notifies Congress of the Smithsonian Bequest, December 17, 1835”
shows President Jackson sitting at his desk in the White House in the
act of writing a letter while his secretary and nephew, Andrew Jackson
Donelson, stands in the background waiting to receive the missive.
The second shows the building of the Smithsonian Institution as
completed in 1851, and the third is an air view of the portion of the
Mall in Washington containing the original buildings and the four
additional ones composing the Smithsonian group today. The six
remaining paintings, arranged chronologically, depict a few of the
many activities undertaken “‘for the increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge among men.” The titles of these are: ‘‘ Professor Henry Posts
Daily Weather Map in the Smithsonian, 1858”, ‘‘Major Powell
Descends the Colorado River Through the Grand Canyon, 1869”’,
‘Secretary Langley Tries Out Aerodrome No. 5, 1895”, “President
Roosevelt Leads Smithsonian African Expedition, 1909-10”’, ‘‘Astro-
physical Observatory Established at Montezuma, Chile, 1918”, ‘ Divi-
sion of Radiation and Organisms Established, 1929.”

The second part of the exhibit on the Institution’s current activities
includes seven exhibition cases, an exhibit booth, and an automatic
lantern slide projector, distributed over the floor. Five of the exhibi-
tion cases contain a group of original specimens indicative of some
current research work in biology, geology, anthropology, ethnology,
and radiation. The biology exhibit, for example, tells the story of the
progressive experiments in evolution with the land mollusk, Cerion,
begun in 1912, while the exhibit on anthropology, consisting of carved
ivory artifacts, gives an indication of current archeological investiga-
tions of the prehistoric Eskimo cultures of northern Alaska and around
Bering Strait. The sixth case indicates very briefly the scope of the
National Gallery of Art, and the seventh represents the National
Zoological Park. For this latter exhibit the interior of the case was
modeled to represent a desert with real sand floor, growing cactuses,
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

and a painted scenic background, and during the whole period of the
fair a large variety of live lizards is to be displayed.

The exhibition booth contains three separate exhibits as follows:
Part of the apparatus used in the Division of Radiation and Organisms
in researches on plant growth; a light spectrum with filters to screen
different rays such as are used in radiation researches; a group of
fluorescent minerals subjected to ultraviolet light with their resultant
beautiful coloring. Lastly, the automatic lantern slide projector with
two series of 70 lantern slides, changed twice a week, reveals present-
day scenes in the many workrooms and laboratories of the Institution.

GRANTS

Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory—A grant of $500 from the
Hodgkins fund was made to the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory
of Harvard University for the purchase of solar radiation instruments,
balloons, and hydrogen for use in making a continuous daily record of
solar and sky radiation at Blue Hill Observatory. This research, in
charge of Dr. Charles F. Brooks, director of the observatory, was
undertaken in connection with the International Polar Year.

Davis and Elkins College-—Two researches under way in the depart-
ment of chemistry of Davis and Elkins College were aided by a grant
of $100 for the purchase of equipment. Under the direction of Prof.
R. B. Purdum, it was proposed to investigate (1) the solubility of lead
sulphate in the presence of sodium sulphate and other electrolytes,
and (2) the solubility of benzidine sulphate and of benzidine hydro-
chloride in various solvents.

Barro Colorado Island Biological Laboratory—The Institution con-
tinued its annual subscription of $300 for a table at the Barro Colorado
Laboratory. This laboratory offers unusually favorable opportunity
for studies of the fauna and flora of tropical America, and its facilities
are used by members of the Institution’s staff or associates.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

In addition to the Johnson-Smithsonian Deep-Sea Expedition
already described, the Institution sent out or took part in 24 expedi-
tions to gather specimens and data essential to the scientific investi-
gations in progress. Smithsonian field parties worked not only in
an unusually large number of States of the United States—29—but
also in Alaska, Canada, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Yucatan, Panama,
Ecuador, and Siam. All these expeditions are briefly described in
the illustrated pamphlet entitled “Explorations and Field Work of
the Smithsonian Institution During 1932”, Smithsonian publication
no. 3213, but to illustrate the aim of Smithsonian field expeditions
I may here mention one or two. In Alaska Dr. Ale’ Hrdlitka carried
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 11

on anthropological and archeological research on Kodiak Island,
excavating sites at Uyak Bay, Chief’s Point, and other localities,
making an archeological survey of the whole island, and taking
measurements and photographs of the few remaining fullbloods on
the island; and James A. Ford conducted archeological work in the
vicinity of Barrow, furnishing a basis for a cultural chronology of
the north Alaska coast. In the West Indies, where in recent years
the Institution has centered intensive anthropological and biological
researches, H. W. Krieger visited Cuba with a view to determining
the northern and southern affiliations of early Cuban cultures, and
Gerrit S. Miller, Jr., searched in the caves of Puerto Rico for evidence
that some of the members of the ancient fauna of the Antillean Islands
continued to exist until the time when the Indians made their
settlements.
PUBLICATIONS

The Institution’s various series of publications constitute the chief
means of carrying out one half of its stated purpose, ‘‘the increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men.” Since the reorganization
of the editorial department 2 years ago, all the series—Smithsonian
proper, National Museum, Bureau of American Ethnology, Astro-
physical Observatory, and Freer Gallery of Art—have been issued
from one central office under the general supervision of the editor of
the Smithsonian Institution, with the joint aims of greater accuracy
and promptness, more uniformity in editorial style, and greater
efficiency in administration.

During the year 100 volumes and pamphlets were published, 43 by
the Institution proper, 48 by the National Museum, 8 by the Bureau
of American Ethnology, and 1 by the Freer Gallery of Art. Details
regarding these publications will be found in the report of the editor,
appendix 10. The number of publications distributed was 177,572.

LIBRARY

The Smithsonian library accessioned during the year 6,319 volumes
and 4,625 pamphlets and charts, most of them coming as exchanges
for Smithsonian publications, although, as usual, many gifts also
were received. In addition to the routine work of the staff, consider-
able progress was made on the union catalog, the order department
of the library was reorganized, the file of exchange relations showed
marked progress, and a start was made on the dictionary index to
all publications of the Institution and its branches.

Respectfully submitted.
C. G. Asport, Secretary.

APPENDIX 1
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the
activities of the National Gallery of Art for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1933.

The retirement on June 30, 1932, of Dr. William H. Holmes,
director of the gallery since its creation as a separate unit under
the Institution in 1920, was a severe loss and his place will be difficult
to fill. His retirement came through an act of Congress which
separated from the Government service many others of the retire-
ment age. His death occurred on April 20, 1933, at Royal Oak,
Mich.

On July 1, 1932, a large percentage of the gallery space was occu-
pied by exhibits of the National Society of Mural Painters, the
National Sculpture Society and by the alumni of the American
Academy in Rome, in connection with the George Washington
Bicentennial Celebration; they continued officially until Thanks-
giving Day, but were extended a few weeks. The removal of the
statuary and the American Academy in Rome exhibits made possible
the installation of a part of the permanent collections. Certain
partitions which the Mural Painters had removed were not replaced
and reduced the wall space, already much too small, by about 180
running feet.

Early in January the large mural paintings were taken down. The
large central gallery was then used for the special exhibition of
29 colorful paintings of Gaucho life of the Argentine by Sefior Don
Cesareo Bernaldo de Quiros. It was sponsored by the Argentine
Ambassador, Sefior Dr. Felipe A. Espil, and the opening on Friday
afternoon, January 13, was attended by many notables headed by Mrs.
Herbert Hoover. It continued through March 12, 1933, and, judg-
ing by the attendance, it was a great success. Later in the spring
the Gellatly collection was removed from New York, arriving in
Washington May 1. The private opening was held on the evening
of June 22, and the collection was thrown open to the public on

June 23.
APPROPRIATIONS

For the administration of the National Gallery of Art, including
compensation of necessary employees, purchase of books of reference
and periodicals, traveling expenses, uniforms for guards, and neces-
sary incidental expenses, $38,220 was appropriated. This was

13
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1932

$7,180 less than the preceding year, and the amount was further
reduced by $1,260 through the impounding of the salary of one
laborer, who was retired. Some $16,500 of this appropriation goes
for the upkeep of the Freer Gallery of Art.

THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART COMMISSION

The twelfth annual meeting of the National Gallery of Art Com-
mission was held at the Smithsonian Institution on December 6,
1932. The members present were Dr. Charles G. Abbot, ex officio,
Herbert Adams, Charles L. Borie, Jr., James E. Fraser, Joseph
H. Gest, John E. Lodge, Paul Manship, George B. McClellan,
Charles Moore, and Edward W. Redfield. Ruel P. Tolman, curator
of the division of graphic arts, and acting director of the National
Gallery of Art, was also present. Owing to the death of Mr. Gari
Melchers, chairman, Mr. Gest was elected temporary chairman,
and Dr. Abbot was made temporary secretary in the absence of Dr.
W. H. Holmes. Resolutions upon the death of Mr. Parmelee,
Mr. French, and Mr. Bixby were adopted. The death of Mr. Gari
Melchers, chairman of the Commission, on November 30, 1932,
was announced. The temporary chairman appointed Mr. Moore,
Mr. Lodge, and Dr. Abbot as a committee to draft suitable resolu-
tions. The resignation of Mr. Herbert L. Pratt was accepted with
regret, making three vacancies in the membership, and it was
resolved that the National Gallery of Art Commission recommend
to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution the election
to membership on the Commission of Mr. Andrew W. Mellon, Mr.
Frederick P. Keppel, and Mr. Gifford Beal.

The Commission also recommended to the Board of Regents
the reelection for the succeeding term of 4 years of the following
members: Messrs. John K. Lodge, E. W. Redfield, and Paul Man-
ship. The following officers were elected for the ensuing year:
Mr. Joseph H. Gest, chairman; Mr. Frank Jewett Mather, Jr.,
vice chairman (reelected), and Dr. Charles G. Abbot, secretary.
The following were elected members of the executive committee for
the ensuing year: Messrs. Charles Moore, Herbert Adams, and
George B. McClellan. Mr. Joseph H. Gest, as chairman of the
Commission, and Dr. Charles G. Abbot, as secretary of the Com-
mission, are ex-officio members.

The subject of stained glass was discussed, and Mr. Charles L.
Borie, Jr., was appointed chairman of a new committee on stained
glass, to report at the next meeting. The Commission, acting
as the advisory committee, accepted the full-length portrait of
John Gellatly, by Irving R. Wiles, N.A., and the portrait of William
H. Holmes, by E. Hodgson Smart. Dr. Moore called attention
to the fact that Dr. W. H. Holmes had retired on June 30, 1932,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

and suggested that a written expression of appreciation of his long
and faithful service to the National Gallery of Art and its Com-
mission be recorded.

THE JOHN GELLATLY ART COLLECTION

The John Gellatly collection of paintings, carvings, jewelry,
enamels, glass, statues, and miscellaneous art objects, offered early
in 1929, and accepted June 13 of that year, was transferred from
New York City to the National Gallery of Art, May 1, 1933. Its
installation was begun immediately and the collection was thrown
open to the public on June 23, 1933. The collection consists of
over 1,600 specimens. The fixtures, pedestals, and cases, are also
a part of the gift.

This collection fills 1 large gallery and 2 smaller galleries adjoining.
Mr. Gellatly was catholic in his taste and collected many rare and
beautiful specimens of the work of the goldsmiths, the ivory carvers,
the makers of statues in wood, bronze, marble, silver, and gold;
ancient glass from many countries; fifteenth and sixteenth century
stained glass; furniture, and paintings.

There are 142 American pictures, of which 104 are oils, 22 water
colors, 12 pastels, and 4 in miscellaneous mediums such as silverpoint,
pencil, and charcoal. Five American artists are represented by 84
examples: T. W. Dewing (17), Abbott H. Thayer (23), Childe Has-
sam (15), J. H. Twachtman (12), Albert P. Ryder (17). Other Amer-
ican artists who are represented by more than one picture are: Henry
Golden Dearth (2), John La Farge (3), J. A. MeN. Whistler (2),
John Singer Sargent (2), Irving R. Wiles (2), Max Bohm (3), Gari
Melchers (3), John Noble (2), Lucia Fairchild Fuller (2 miniatures),
J. J. Shannon (2), F.S. Church (7). A few of the American painters
represented by but one painting are: John Singleton Copley, Frank
W. Benson, Frank Duveneck, George De Forest Brush, Edward G.
Malbone (miniature), Robert Reid, George Fuller, Paul Dougherty,
R. A. Blakelock, George Inness. In all, there are 44 American artists.
European paintings are very poorly represented, there being only 22
paintings by 19 artists, 7 of whom are unknown.

On the walls of the large gallery are shown exactly 100 American
oil paintings, while around the walls and the floor space are cases con-
taining glass, jewels, oriental specimens, enamels; ancient and modern
sculpture in wax, silver, wood and terra cotta; antique furniture,
chairs, settees, tables, and much other valuable and interesting
material.

A second gallery is filled to overflowing with a great variety of
material from Europe and Asia, tapestries, textiles, furniture, rare
stained glass, religious crucifixes and charms, sculpture in wood,
terra cotta, ivory, jade, emerald, bronze, and marble. Unique items
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

among these are: The Christian necklace of the sixth century consist-
ing of 15 golden disks inlaid with glass mosaic, each disk portraying
one of the twelve disciples with the name inscribed in Greek, the
central disk being reserved for the Christ and the two end ones each
bearing the Constantinean cross; and an emerald cup, a marvel of
size and workmanship. There are many objects of unusual interest
and value, also paintings, European and oriental.

In a third gallery are displayed 36 water colors, pastels, and draw-
ings by American artists, and 16 fragments of Chinese frescoes from
Turfan; 1 bronze and 1 terra-cotta by Augustus St. Gaudens; 1
marble by George Grey Barnard, and miscellaneous furniture, a
grandfather clock, a desk, a harp, tables, chairs, etc. One large
model of a seventeenth century warship will be found surrounded by
many other objects not listed here. One important painting, a 15-
foot circular decoration called ‘“‘Dawn”, by T. W. Dewing, which
had been rolled for 19 years, was mounted and hung in the rotunda.

The Gellatly collection is undoubtedly the most important gift to
the National Gallery since the Freer collection was received. It has
great variety and in itself is an art museum.

THE HENRY WARD RANGER FUND PURCHASES

The 12 paintings purchased during the year by the Council of the
National Academy of Design from the fund provided by the Henry
Ward Ranger bequest, which under certain conditions are prospective
additions to the National Gallery collections, are as follows, including

THE NATIONAL GALLERY LIBRARY

Much-needed space was provided for the library by the installation
in room 382 of steel book stacks, giving about 250 feet of additional
shelving. On May 1, 1933, Miss Ruth Wenger, library assistant, was
detailed from the Smithsonian Library, and the organization of the
library was begun. At the close of the year considerable progress had
been made in rearrangement and shelf-listing of the material and the
inauguration of a standardized card catalog. The checking of missing
parts of the gallery’s serial publications progressed, and the recording
of much material was accomplished. During the year 499 volumes
and pamphlets were added by gift, exchange, and purchase.

CARE OF COLLECTIONS

The portraits and most of the sculpture which were in the lobby,
the northern entrance to the Natural History Building, have been
moved to the halls around the rotunda, where both the sculpture and
paintings appear to good advantage. Ten statues still remain in the
lobby and 10 paintings have been selected from the permanent
collection for exhibition there.

CHANGES IN PERSONNEL

Dr. William H. Holmes, Director, was retired June 30, 1932, and
Ruel P. Tolman was appointed Acting Director on July 1, 1932.

Ralph Seymour was given a temporary appointment as expert in
charge of the Gellatly art collection, May 1 to June 30, 1933.

Day.

The total attendance of visitors coming in at the main entrance
was 120,707; the total attendance for week days 78,247; the total
Sunday attendance, 38,990. The usual ratio between Sunday and
week-day attendance of 3 to 1, was maintained—the Sunday attend-
ance averaging 750, the week-day attendance, 251. The highest
monthly total attendances were reached in April (18,822) and August
(14,542); the lowest attendance was in December (4,929).

The total attendance of visitors on Mondays was 25, making a
grand total attendance of 120,732.

There were 2,082 visitors to the offices during the year. Of these,
118 came for general information, 280 to see objects in storage, 36 to
examine the building and installation, 185 to study in the library, 122
to see the facsimiles of the Washington Manuscripts, 36 to make
tracings and sketches from library books, 29 to get permission to make
photographs and sketches, 250 to examine or purchase photographs,
126 to submit objects for examination, 375 to see members of the staff.

given docent service upon request, and 18 groups, ranging from 6 to
13 persons (total, 171) were given instruction in the study rooms.
26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

FIELD WORK

Owing to the disturbed conditions in China, the conduct of field
work has been greatly limited. However, during the past spring it
has been possible to explore a large part of the province of Shansi.
It is thought that the data assembled during these explorations will
prove to be of value in the making of a preliminary distribution map
of culture sites of various ages in that Province.

PERSONNEL

On August 5, 1932, the Freer Gallery suffered a loss in the death of
Herbert E. Thompson, of Boston. Mr. Thompson had been asso-
ciated with the Gallery since 1921 in the work of the preservation of
oil paintings.

William Acker, student assistant, was at the Gallery from July 19,
1932, until January 21, 1933, when he was sent to Japan for further
study.

Y. Kinoshita, mounter, was granted a 4 months’ leave of absence,
from June 11, in order to visit his home in Japan.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 3
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1933, conducted
in accordance with the act of Congress approved June 30, 1932.
The act referred to contains the following item:

American ethnology: For continuing ethnological researches among the
American Indians and the natives of Hawaii, the excavation and preservation
of archexologic remains under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution,
including necessary employees, the preparation of manuscripts, drawings, and
illustrations, the purchase of books and periodicals, and traveling expenses,
$66,640,

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

M. W. Stirling, chief, devoted most of his time during the year to
office routine and to the preparation of manuscript accumulated
from past researches. Several sections of his report on the ethnology
of the Jivaro Indians of eastern Ecuador were completed, and con-
siderable progress was made in the preparation of a manuscript
describing and illustrating the important finds made by F. H. Cush-
ing, former ethnologist of the Bureau, during excavations in a muck
deposit at Key Marco, Fla. A set of excellent photographs illus-
trating this work was discovered in the Bureau archives, where they
had been deposited, unindexed, by Mr. Cushing, whose death took
place shortly after the completion of his Florida field work.

Mr. Stirling also gathered a large quantity of unpublished material
relating to the career of Sitting Bull, including a new and heretofore
unknown hieroglyphic autobiography drawn by Sitting Bull himself,
a more important specimen than the famous copy of a Sitting Bull
autobiography in the Bureau archives made by Four Horns.

Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, devoted the greater part of
his time, beyond that used in answering correspondents, to an exten-
sive paper on the ethnology of the southeastern Indians, mentioned
in previous reports. A great volume of material has been added.
Progress has also been made in the preparation of a bulletin to include
all the linguistic material rescued from the now extinct Coahuiltecan
and Karankawan dialects.

Dr. Swanton took part in the “Conference on Southern Pre-
History” held at Birmingham, Ala., December 18-20, under the
auspices of the Division of Anthropology and Psychology of the

27
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

National Research Council, through its committee on State archeo-
logical surveys, of which Dr. Carl E. Guthe is chairman. To this he
contributed two papers, one entitled ‘‘The Southeastern Indians of
History”’ and the other ‘‘The Relation of the Southeast to General
Culture Problems of American Pre-History.’”’ He presided as presi-
dent of the American Anthropological Association over the sessions
of that body at its meeting at Atlantic City, N.J., December 28-30.

Bulletin 108, entitled ‘‘A Dictionary of the Atakapa Language’’,
consisting largely of material collected by the late Albert S. Gatschet
but systematized and edited by Dr. Swanton, appeared during
the year.

Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist, was at work among the
Cheyenne and Arapaho at the beginning of the year. Among the
Cheyenne the prime object was to get an insight into their mythol-
ogy, though their sociology was not neglected. Among the Arapaho,
work was linguistic and sociological. He secured the personal narra-
tive of an aged southern Arapaho woman. An analysis shows clearly
that this is almost entirely institutional, closely following the tribal
pattern. With but few changes it might be the autobiography of
any aged Arapaho woman. On July 22 Dr. Michelson left for Tama,
Iowa, to renew researches among the Foxes in that vicinity. New
data on ceremonials were obtained and some older data verified. He
left Tama on August 8, stopping at Chicago to consult with some
anthropologists of that city and to inspect certain collections.

While in the office Dr. Michelson prepared for publication by the
Bureau a manuscript entitled ‘‘When the War Chiefs Worship the
Wolf’’, which is to be combined with a paper entitled ‘“‘Fox Miscel-
lany”’, which was prepared last year. Dr. Michelson worked out a
long series of phonetic shifts in Arapaho, which will ultimately be
published. He succeeded in finding Algonquian etymologies for a
host of Blackfoot words and stems; which contradicts the usual
assumption that Blackfoot vocabulary must be largely from outside
sources. A grant was made to Dr. Michelson by the National
Research Council whereby he could employ a technical assistant to
bring the late Dr. Jones’ Fox and Ojibwa material into shape for
publication, and Mrs. Margaret Welpley, a former student of
Dr. Michelson’s, was selected for this purpose. At the close of the
fiscal year all the Fox ethnological material was virtually ready for
publication.

J. P. Harrington, ethnologist, spent the year in an endeavor to
rescue before it is too late what can still be learned of the culture of
the Indians of southern California and adjacent regions to the north
and east. Attention in this field naturally centered about the classic
work of Boscana published by Alfred Robinson in 1846, as Boscana’s
work has never been thoroughly checked with modern Indians.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 29

Father St. John O’Sullivan of San Juan Mission gave invaluable
collaboration in a renewed study of the San Juan Indians.

The Fred H. Bixby ranch near Long Beach was identified as the
birthplace of the Indian prophet Chinigchinich. All obscure passages
in Boscana were completely cleared up as a result of this work and
much new ethnological data was secured.

Searcely a source of information that could be thought of was
left untried. Information was gathered by correspondence from
universities and professors in this country, Spain, Italy and Mexico.
The manuscript, comprising some 800 pages, was completed for
publication, and should be a standard source book for the ethnology
of southern California Indians. Thorough linguistic, ethnobotani-
cal, and historical studies were made to support the Boscana.

The beginning of the year found Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, Jr., arche-
ologist, in camp 3} miles south of Allantown, Ariz., engaged in a
series of archeological excavations which had been started in June.
The work as a whole was a continuation of a program of researches
begun during the summer of 1931. In July 1932 a semisubterranean
structure of the Pueblo I pit-dwelling type was cleared of accumu-
lated debris. Eight granaries and two surface shelters accompanying
the pit remains were also uncovered. This group contributed valu-
able data on the habits and customs of the people of that horizon.
Specimens of the arts and industries obtained from the structures
aided materially in determining the culture pattern.

Investigations were shifted to a Pueblo II site late in July, and a
6-room unit house with its adjacent ceremonial chamber or kiva was
excavated. Digging was also carried on in the nearby refuse mound.
Twenty burials were found and interesting information obtained con-
cerning mortuary customs. <A representative collection of artifacts
was also made at this location. The investigations demonstrated that
the typical unit house was present in a region where it hitherto had
not been supposed to exist.

Dr. Roberts returned to Washington in September and spent the
winter preparing plans, diagrams, and a report on the summer’s
activities.

Dr. Roberts left Washington at the end of May 1933 for Arizona.
En route he stopped at Norton, Kans., to inspect purported Indian
mounds. The formations proved to be entirely natural.

In Arizona investigations were resumed at the site south of Allan-
town. The work consisted largely of checking notes made in previous
seasons and making preparations to abandon the site, the latter move
being necessitated by the lack of funds required to carry the researches
to a proper conclusion.

From July 1 to 16, 1932, Dr. W. D. Strong, anthropologist,
continued his stratigraphic researches at Signal Butte in western
30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

Nebraska. From July 16 to September 2 archeological research was
carried on in historic and prehistoric Arikara and Mandan sites in
South Dakota. Some ethnological work was also accomplished
among the former people. From September 16, 1932, to January 28,
1933, he was in Washington, where the collections were unpacked,
classified, and the writing of reports commenced.

On January 28, 1933, Dr. Strong left Washington for 6 months’
anthropological research in northeastern Honduras. This included a
6 weeks’ expedition up the Patuca River, where archeological sites
were mapped, some excavating was carried on, and the Sumu and
Miskito Indians were briefly studied. An accident occurring on this
trip caused a delay of several weeks at Puerto Castilla for hospital
treatment. From April 24 to May 24 an archeological survey of the
Bay Islands was accomplished. This yielded unusually valuable
results. On June 4 the party made a muleback trip across the moun-
tains to the interior town of Juticalpa. From here they flew to
Tegucigalpa to interview officials. On July 1 the party was return-
ing by mule to the coast. Many new archeological sites, some of
very large size, were discovered on this trip. Valuable contacts were
also made with the Paya Indians in the interior.

Winslow M. Walker, associate anthropologist, resumed investiga-
tions in the mound area of the Mississippi Valley from the middle of
August to the middle of November 1932. Excavations made on the
site of the former great mound at Jonesville, La., revealed evidences
of more than one period of occupancy, the earliest containing pottery
of a type similar to that found in the Hopewell mounds of Ohio
Other interesting features discovered include portions of a log palisade,
a kind of stairway of logs, a lone human skuil, minus the lower jaw,
lying in the mud beneath the lowest step, and great sheets of cane laid
down with careful regularity throughout the mound. Other mounds
in this group, formerly known as the Troyville group, were examined,
and the conclusion was reached that they probably stand on the site
of the great Indian town of Anilco visited by De Soto in 1542. A
report on this work has been prepared entitled ‘‘The Troyville
Mounds, Catahoula Parish, La.’”’ Mr. Walker also spent some time
while in Arkansas endeavoring to locate the sites of the Quapaw
villages shown on the Ross map of 1765, but changes in the river
course have obliterated all trace of them. A start has also been made
on a card catalog listing the locations of early historic Indian villages,
to serve as a guide for further profitable archeological work in the
Southeast.

J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, devoted considerable time to a study
of the probable date of the formation and organization of the League
of the Five Iroquois Tribes. This required especial research in the
early writings of the first explorers in the valley of the St. Lawrence
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 31

River. This study confirmed Mr. Hewitt’s earlier estimate that the
approximate period was 1559-70.

A study of the Jesuit Relations shows that the organic units of the
federal structure of the historical League of the Five Iroquois Tribes
differed from those of the Huron in nonessentials only. Mr. Hewitt
also established the fact that the Iroquois had not been expelled from
the north by Algonquins in prehistoric times.

A new translation with interpretative notes of the Fifth Ritual of
the Federal Ceremony of Condolence and Installation, ‘‘The Requick-
ening Address”’, consisting of 8,385 native terms, was made.

Mr. Hewitt represented the Smithsonian Institution on the United
States Geographic Board, as a member of its executive committee.

As custodian of manuscripts, Mr. Hewitt has been assisted by Miss
Mae Tucker, who has also continued the task of cataloging the
thousands of negatives and photographs accumulated since the
establishment of the Bureau.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

The study of Indian music was continued during the past year by
Miss Frances Densmore, a collaborator of the Bureau. Seven manu-
scripts were submitted, with the following titles: ‘‘Winnebago, Iro-
quois, Pueblo, and British Columbian Songs’’; “‘Seminole Songs Con-
nected with Legends and Dances”; ‘‘Dance Songs of the Seminole
Indians’”’; ‘“‘Choctaw Songs of Dances and Games”; “Songs of the
Alibamu Indians”; ‘‘Alibamu Songs of the Buffalo and Other
Dances”; and ‘‘Chitimacha, Choctaw, and Seminole Music, with a
Comparative Survey of Indian Music in the Gulf States.’”’ Seven
manuscripts previously submitted on the music of British Columbian
Indians have been combined and retyped.

An extended field trip in the Gulf States was begun in December
1932 and concluded in February 1933. The first tribe visited was the
Alibamu in Polk County, Tex., more than 60 songs being recorded.
The Chitimacha at Charenton, La., were next studied. About 80
songs were recorded from the Choctaw near Philadelphia, Miss. The
Seminole in Florida were revisited and about 70 songs were recorded.

EDITORIAL WORK AND PUBLICATIONS

The editing of the publications of the Bureau was continued through
the year by Stanley Searles, editor. The status of the publications

APPENDIX 4
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the International Exchange Service during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1933.

The appropriation granted by Congress for the system of interna-
tional exchanges during the year was $47,529, a decrease of $6,531
from the appropriation for the preceding year. Of this decrease,
$1,250 was on account of certain savings in forwarding shipments to
Great Britain, and the remainder, $5,281, was to meet the 10 percent
reduction made by Congress in its economy program. The repay-
ments from departmental and other establishments aggregated
$5,228.29, making the total available resources for conducting the
service during 1933 $52,757.29.

The total number of packages handled was 720,209, a decrease of
38,826. The weight of these packages was 634,707 pounds, a falling
off of 25,943 pounds.

The following table gives the number and weight of the packages
passing through the service arranged under certain classifications:

During the year 2,688 boxes were shipped abroad, an increase of
36 over the number for the preceding 12 months. Of the total num-
ber of boxes, 603 contained full sets of United States official docu-
ments for authorized depositories abroad, and the remainder (2,083)
were filled with publications for miscellaneous establishments and
individuals.

The number of packages sent abroad by mail was 79,630, a decrease
of 5,805 from the number mailed the previous year.

APPENDIX 5
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1933:

The regular appropriation made by Congress for the maintenance
of the Park was $228,880, a decrease of $26,660 from that available
during the fiscal year 1932. The 8% percent reduction on salaries
from July 1, 1932 to March 30, 1933 and the 15 percent reduction on
salaries from April 1 to June 30, 1933 reduced the total expenditures
by $15,403.89. There were further reductions—mainly impoundage
for positions vacant—totaling $10,702.34. The total expenditures
for the year were about $202,760.

ACCESSIONS

Gifts —A number of important gifts during the year have enriched
the collection appreciably. From the United States Bureau of
Fisheries, through Henry O’ Malley, were received 2 northern fur seals
and 16 Aleutian rosy finches. The Pennsylvania Game Commission,
through Vernon Bailey, of the Biological Survey, presented a female
and 3 young American beavers Dr. E. R. Dunn, of Haverford
College, collected in Panama some remarkable frogs, Atelopus varius
zeteki, and presented the Park with two dozen. This is the first time
these frogs have been exhibited. Dr. Charles E. Burt, of Winfield,
Kans., has continued his field work and sent in frequent shipments
of southwestern lizards. An electric catfish from West Africa and 6
Rasbora heteromorpha were purchased through the Frances Brinklé
Zerbee Memorial Fund. From the Frederic D. Barstow Fund, there
were purchased one dozen zebra finches and a shama thrush.

kookaburras.

Purchases.—Ross Freeman, formerly an employee of the United
States Rubber Co. in Sumatra, arrived in New York in July and
brought with him a large collection of East Indian species. The
park was able to select specimens desired at prices that made them
practically gifts, and through this source were added to the collection
a pair of orang-utans, 2 Siamang gibbons, a pair of Sumatran tigers,
and several other interesting mammals and birds, as well as some very
rare snakes.

IMPROVEMENTS

No funds were available for such major improvements as buildings
or large cages, but a large number of minor improvements were made
during the latter part of the year, chiefly through the use of labor
supplied by the Work Planning and Job Assignment Committee, all
labor having been paid for from the emergency relief fund. The
work that was carried out in this manner was of a character which had
been much needed to improve the appearance of the Park, for the
convenience of the public and to facilitate proper care of the animals,
but which had been delayed owing to shortage of funds.

The outstanding major improvement of the year was the laying of
an 8-inch water main from the Connecticut Avenue main to the end
of the 6-inch main near the Japanese deer, the laying of a 3-inch main
from the 8-inch line to the great flight cage, and the laying of a 2}4-
inch main to the bear yards. This installation provides the entire
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 45

west side of the Park with an adequate supply of water under good
pressure and lessens the use through the 6-inch Harvard Street main
to such an extent that the pressure and volume on the east side of the
Park is better than before. This also provides excellent fire protection
and the installation should prove adequate for all future developments
within the Park.

Thirteen thousand two hundred and fifty linear feet of concrete
curd was laid on both sides of 6,625 linear feet of walks, and the walks
resurfaced with 53,000 square feet of bitulithic paving, laid hot.

One of the buffalo yards that had seriously eroded was regraded,
and three low rock walls were laid to produce a terrace effect and pre-
vent further wash. New fences were constructed around both the
buffalo and elk paddocks.

A bank immediately west of the bird house which had been left in
an unfinished state from previous construction work was partially
cut away. When this work is finally finished, additional cages will
be constructed on the site. The earth from the cutting was used to
make needed fills about the Park.

In those portions of the Park adjacent to roads and walks and most
frequented by the public, dead trees likely to fall and endanger life
and property were cut down or the menacing portions removed, and
the grounds were extensively cleaned.

Fifty-one cords of wood were gathered and turned over to the
municipal wood yard in connection with the cleaning of the grounds.
The wood was used by the District committee on employment for
the relief of destitute people of the city. In addition to the crews
working under the immediate supervision of the Park, the municipal
wood yard asssigned a foreman and crew to do certain cutting of
trees and cleaning of the grounds, in order that they might obtain the
wood more rapidly than it was possible for the Park to supply it. In
this manner 127 cords were obtained in addition to that turned over
to them by the Park from crews operating under its own foreman.

Oak, maple, beach, elm, and other valuable shade trees have been
planted in the buffalo yard, the elk yard, near the office, near the
bird house, and other locations. Many banks that had eroded were
repaired and sodded with honeysuckle or myrtle, and other minor
planting work was carried on, including certain plantings adjacent to
the reptile house. A screen of shrubbery has been planted near the
office to hide an unattractive service area.

Much more extensive painting of a maintenance character was
carried out than has heretofore been possible, owing to the plentiful
supply of labor for cleaning surfaces preparatory to painting. Such
painting work included the outside of the lion house and exterior
cages, the cages outside the monkey house, and the bear yards. Also,
about 400 park benches were repaired and painted.
46 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19383

No new construction has been attempted with the exception of the
wiring of three cages that had been started in the previous fiscal year
and left unfinished and the construction of 20 small cages for the
bird house. These are to house a collection of the smaller cage birds.

The blueprints, tracings, and maps of the Park had outgrown the
original system of filing and were suffering seriously from lack of proper
care. With the use of labor supplied by the Work Planning and Job
Assignment Committee, they were sorted, classified, and filed.

No satisfactory map of the Park has been available for several years,
and the developments of recent years have emphasized the need for a
good map. The preparation of a topographic map on the scale of 50
feet to the inch has been undertaken by using the 1906 topographic
base of this scale and bringing it up to date by inserting thereon the
changes in topography and structures that have come about since the
map was prepared.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

I wish again to call attention to the inadequate police force and
to the need for suitable buildings.

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activ-
ities of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1933:

PLANT AND OBJECTS

This observatory operates regularly the central station at Wash-
ington and two field stations for observing solar radiation on Table
Mountain, Calif., and Mount Montezuma, Chile. The observatory
controls a station on Mount Wilson, Calif., where occasional expedi-
tions are sent for special investigations, one of which is mentioned
below.

The observatory is continuing the measurements of the solar con-
stant of radiation referred to in former reports and forming the
principal theme of volumes IJ, III, IV, and V of its annals.

WORK IN WASHINGTON

With the publication of volume V of the annals there was available
a long series of solar-constant measurements adapted for study of the
variation of the sun and the dependence of terrestrial temperatures
thereon. Seven regular periodicities were discovered in the variation
of the sun, having intervals of approximately 7, 8, 11, 21, 25, 45, and
68 months. The observations reported in volume V of the annals
closed with the year 1930. <A revision of the periodicities based upon
observations from 1924 to 1932 was undertaken by Dr. Abbot. The
periodic terms when summed up represented the fluctuation within
an average departure of less than one tenth of 1 percent. He ven-
tured to forecast the fluctuation of the solar radiation to the end of
the year 1934 as based on this analysis. The observations followed
the prediction as closely as could be expected up to about May 1,
1933, when a divergence of about three fourths of 1 percent began
to disclose itself: The results came higher than expected. Whether
this divergence is due to a slight change of scale of the instruments
at Table Mountain from whence the observations are alone available
at present, to a failure of the empirical method of reduction there on
account of the very unusual humid and hazy summer, or to a real
divergence of solar radiation from the trend indicated by former

47
48 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

observations cannot yet be determined. As soon as the revision of
the method of reduction of observations from Montezuma, Chile,
now in progress, is completed, it will be possible to decide.

Having found the variation of the sun so obviously periodic in
character, Dr. Abbot and Mrs. Bond spent a great deal of time on the
study of the departures from normal temperature of Bismarck, N.Dak.
This station was chosen as one with a long record, published in World
Weather Records, and situated in a region subject to the most direct
influence of the sun without near-by interference of oceanic and moun-
tain climates. The data have been studied for the interval 1875 to
1925 with a view to determining therefrom whatever periodicities
might be contained. It is hoped that, based upon this analysis, a
prediction might be made of the march of departures from normal
temperature at Bismarck for the period 1925 to the present which
could be immediately compared with observation so as to see if such
prediction would be verified. The study is not yet completed but
indicates clearly that the seven periodicities found in solar variation
are of importance in the control of the temperature at Bismarck,
although for reasons not fully understood changes of phase and
amplitude confuse effects. A hopeful line of study of the causes of
these changes of phase and amplitude is in progress.

Mr. Aldrich, besides attending to the routine of the observatory
and the demands of the field stations in California, Chile, and Egypt,
has reconstructed the delicate parts of the double-barreled water-
flow pyrheliometer, has taken part in the preparation of an exhibit
for the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, and has under-
taken the revision of the method of reduction of the observations at
Montezuma.

Mr. Fowle’s work has been largely confined to the preparation of
the eighth edition of the Smithsonian Physical Tables.

The instrument maker, Mr. Kramer, has had under construction
apparatus for the continuation of the study of the solar spectrum at
great wave lengths, to be noticed below, as well as the rebuilding of
certain apparatus used by the stations at Table Mountain, Monte-
zuma, and Mount St. Katherine.

MOUNT ST. KATHERINE EXPEDITION

Financed by the generosity of Mr. John A. Roebling, an expedition
under the charge of Harlan H. Zodtner, assisted by Frederick A.
Greeley, was prepared and dispatched to occupy Mount St. Katherine
near Mount Sinai in Egypt. The expedition went forward in March
1933. Arrangements had been made with the Convent of Mount
Sinai to construct trails, protect the springs from pollution, and
prepare the buildings for observing and quarters for the observers
at the summit of Mount St. Katherine. A recent report indicates
that the preparations are far advanced.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 49

MOUNT WILSON EXPEDITION

Messrs. Abbot and Aldrich continued the occupation of the station
at Mount Wilson up to September 1932 for the purpose of attempting
measurements of the solar spectrum for very long wave lengths, from
8 to 30 microns, far down in the infrared. The ultimate object of
these studies is to determine the transparency of the atmosphere for
these long wave lengths and its dependence on the atmospheric
humidity, but more especially on the quantity of atmospheric ozone.
It is believed that the temperature of the earth may probably depend
intimately on the absorption of outgoing earth rays produced by the
ozone of the atmosphere. Measurements made in the ultraviolet
spectrum have indicated that the ozone content of the atmosphere
is variable and that the variations are associated with the sun-spot
numbers. Inasmuch as en important band of absorption by ozone
occurs at exactly the only region of the terrestrial spectrum where the
atmosphere is otherwise highly transparent, it is very probable that
the variation in the atmospheric ozone is an important weather
phenomenon. The difficulties of observing in this region are very
great. The solar spectrum there is extremely feeble compared with
regions of lesser wave length, and a great deal of the shorter wave
length rays are scattered into the long-wave region which must be
studied. Accordingly a double spectroscopic arrangement must be
provided to produce a better spectrum. This not only complicates the
apparatus but requires exceedingly sensitive radiation-measuring
devices to observe the feeble indications of energy. Computation
showed that neither the bolometer, the thermopile, nor the radiom-
eter appeared adequate for the purpose. Dr. Abbot was fortunate
in recalling the special radiation-measuring device which he invented
about 25 years ago, and in very greatly improving its construction so
that it becomes of the very highest sensitiveness. The description of
this instrument which he prepared and used at Mount Wilson was
published in 1932 under the title ‘‘The Kampometer, a New Instru-
ment of Extreme Sensitiveness For Measuring Radiation.”

Considerable time at Mount Wilson was occupied in devising and
constructing and learning to use this instrument, but Messrs. Abbot
and Aldrich before their departure were able to make certain pre-
liminary measurements in the solar spectrum at very long wave
lengths which indicated that sufficient sensitiveness is available.

Attempts are under way to improve the kampometer by the sub-
stitution of bimetallic strips composed of cadmium and molybdenum
_ and by more exact construction. Also the double spectroscope is being
rebuilt, and it is believed that an expedition in 1934, if that be possible,
may add valuable knowledge of the extreme infrared solar spectrum.
50 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

OTHER FIELD STATIONS

The volcanic eruption in southern Chile early in the year 1932
having temporarily spoiled the atmosphere for observing at Monte-
zuma, we took advantage of the break in continuity of observations to
improve the apparatus by substituting pyrheliometers of the newest
type, a new pyranometer with improved sun shade, and have under-
taken to revise the method of computing in accordance with the latest
method developed at Table Mountain. These extensive alterations
in apparatus and procedure prevent the working out of the solar-
constant values until the method is fully complete and tested. When
that occurs the values from the Montezuma station will be available
back to about the middle of the year 1932, leaving a break of only
2 or 3 months when the volcanic ash was at its maximum.

Meanwhile telegraphic observations have been received from the
station at Table Mountain and communicated to interested parties
as heretofore. They are not regarded as of so high a degree of
accuracy as those formerly obtained from Montezuma and are
regarded, furthermore, as provisional values subject to revision when
all the evidence becomes available.

PERSONNEL

M. Keith Baughman was employed as bolometric assistant at
Table Mountain from November 21, 1932, to May 31, 1933. A. F.
Moore returned from detached service to be director at Table Moun-
tain. Harlan H. Zodtner and Frederick A. Greeley were released
from duty at Table Mountain for detached service on the Mount St.

Katherine Expedition.
SUMMARY

Valuable progress has been made on the study of the dependence of
terrestrial temperature departures on the variation of the sun. Inter-
esting studies have begun on the dependence of terrestrial tempera-
ture departures on the ozone content of the atmosphere; solar-
radiation observations have been continued at Table Mountain,
Calif., Montezuma, Chile, and the cooperating private station at
Mount St. Katherine in Sinai Peninsula is being equipped. A new
radiation measuring instrument of highest sensitiveness called the
kampometer has been devised and used with success in preliminary
measurements of the extreme infrared solar spectrum.

APPENDIX 7

REPORT ON THE DIVISION OF RADIATION AND
ORGANISMS

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the Division of Radiation and Organisms during the year ending
June 30, 1933:

This branch of the operations promoted by private funds has for
its primary purpose the study of the dependence of plant growth on
radiation in various circumstances of temperature, humidity, and
carbon dioxide concentration in the air. The division was started
May 1, 1929, by the assistance of the Research Corporation of New
York, which has furnished an average of about $20,000 a year in
grants to promote its progress. To these sums have been added sums
from the income of the private endowment of the Smithsonian
Institution, so that an average expenditure somewhat exceeding
$25,000 annually has been made.

The investigations proposed required considerable laboratory space
and office space. These were secured by clearing a part of the western
basement of the old Smithsonian Building and equipping it with
water, gas, and electricity, cementing the floor, and finishing and
painting the walls. Office space was obtained by finishing the interior
of the north tower and providing an elevator, whereby eight excellent
though small office rooms were made available.

The earlier years of the investigation were very largely given over
to the invention and construction of special apparatus under the
direction of Dr. F.S. Brackett and Dr. Earl S. Johnston. Much glass
apparatus has been prepared by L. B. Clark, and in the shop equipped
by the funds of the Research Corporation L. A. Fillmen has con-
structed many instruments of special design. Dr. E. D. McAlister
has been engaged in the preparation of thermocouples of high sensi-
tivity, the measurement of the energy distribution of absorption
spectra, and the preparation of spectroscopic apparatus, and has
assisted in the different researches as required.

In addition to the personnel above named, W. H. Hoover has been
assigned to the special work on radiation and plant growth, Dr.
Florence E. Meier, a fellow of the National Research Council, has been
assigned to the study of the life and health of algae under different

12774—35—$§5 51
52 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

conditions of radiation, and R. M. Clagett has assisted with the wood
work of special devices.

During the earlier part of the fiscal year, six pamphlets were pub-
lished under the following titles:

Lethal action of ultra-violet light on a unicellular green alga, by Florence E.

Meier.

A spectrophotometric development for biological and photochemical investiga-
tions, by F. 8. Brackett and E. D. McAlister.

The functions of radiation in the physiology of plants. I.%General methods
and apparatus, by F. S. Brackett and E. S. Johnston.

The functions of radiation in the physiology of plants. II. Some effects of
near infrared radiation on plants, by Earl S. Johnston.

Carbon dioxide assimilation in a higher plant, by W. H. Hoover, Earl 8S.
Johnston, and F. S. Brackett.

Absolute intensities in the visible and ultra-violet spectrum of a quartz mercury
arc, by E. D. McAlister.

An outstanding exhibition was prepared for the Atlantic City
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
in December 1932, which attracted wide and favorable notice. Also
an interesting exhibit for the Century of Progress Exposition at
Chicago was prepared in cooperation between the division, the
Astrophysical Observatory, and the Division of Mineralogy of the
National Museum.

In March 1933 a reorganization of the division took place. The
Secretary, Dr. Abbot, who has been engrossed in the preparation of
volume 5 of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory and volume
12 of the Smithsonian Scientific Series, having finished these tasks,
undertook the general charge of the division. Dr. F. S. Brackett
received a part-time appointment as consulting physicist with oppor-
tunity to devote himself entirely for the division on the investigation
of absorption spectra of organic substances such as contribute to the
chemical activity of plants. Dr. E. S. Johnston was appointed
assistant director of the division.

Having completed his share of the preparation of the two exhibits,
Mr. Hoover carried through a study of the growth of wheat under
measured concentrations of water vapor and carbonic acid with fixed
temperature and illuminated by measured quantities of light from
helium discharge tubes. This research showed that the helium
discharge produces approximately 30 percent greater assimilation of
carbon dioxide than does equally intense white light. By means of
filters some progress was made by Mr. Hoover in separating the
effects of the several monochromatic rays of which the light of the
helium discharge tube is composed.

Dr. McAlister, at the request of Dr. Abbot, undertook to devise a
better means of producing substantially monochromatic light of any
desired wave length for use in plant-growth experiments. After
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 5S

devising a spectroscopic method which seemed feasible, he made
experiments with the so-called Christiansen filter, which are exceed-
ingly promising. This apparatus consists of a parallel-walled, trans-
parent cell in which some organic liquid, as benzene is almost com-
pletely filled with granulated optical glass. At that wave length
where the index of refraction of the liquid is equal to the index of
refraction of the glass, the rays pass directly through, whereas those of
surrounding wave length are scattered to more or less wide angles.
It is easily possible with this apparatus to secure a nearly pure spec-
trum band not more than 200 angstroms wide. The band may be
moved from one part of the spectrum to another by changing the
temperature of the apparatus. Dr. McAlister, however, by mixing
two liquids, has arranged to alter the wave length of the transmitted
band by varying their relative concentration. With Mr. Hoover he
has developed an excellent method for illuminating with this source of
monochromatic light the wheat experiments and the experiments with
algae such as Dr. Meier is conducting. Quite sufficient intensities of
energy may be obtained by the devices proposed, and it is expected
soon to undertake the growth of wheat and of algae under selected
rays of nearly monochromatic light of suitable and controlled intensity.

Dr. Meier made two series of check experiments on the propagation
of unicellular algae under 12 different varieties of light. These
experiments gave well-according results, but their interpretation as
regards wave-length data is not yet quite complete.

Dr. Johnston is continuing the experiments on phototropism and
has attempted the growing of wheat under outdoor conditions with
different concentrations of carbon dioxide. Considerable difficulties
were encountered in this latter experiment, so that no definitive results
have yet been obtained, but it is believed that the way is now open
to more successful operations next season.

Dr. Brackett has completed the installation of the rock-salt spec-
trograph for investigations of the absorption energy spectra of organic
substances in the extreme infrared, and has obtained some beautiful
preliminary photographic records of certain bands of absorption. He
has also completed the installation of a quartz spectrograph for the
study of absorption spectra through a wide range of wave lengths, and
has obtained beautiful records with it also.

Mr. Clark has undertaken the preparation of suitable bimetallic
strips of cadmium and molybdenum for use in the construction of a
kampometer, that excessively sensitive radiation-measuring instru-
ment invented by Dr. Abbot and used by him on Mount Wilson in
1932.

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the United States Regional Bureau of the International
Catalogue of Scientific Literature for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1933.

The regular routine work of the Bureau was continued, consisting
mainly of recording necessary data of current scientific literature
published in the United States to be immediately available for
indexing and classifying purposes whenever international conditions
make it possible to resume publication. In addition to this routine
work efforts to reorganize and refinance the organization were con-
tinued but without success as, owing to the long continued financial
depression, it was impossible to obtain from the other cooperating
countries the necessary monetary commitments. Efforts were
also made to obtain, in this country, a capital fund to meet the whole
cost of printing, a plan having been formulated showing that with a
revolving fund of $75,000 available, publication could be resumed
and publishing thereafter become self-supporting. The time, how-
ever, was not ripe for obtaining necessary financial aid from either
private donors or endowed foundations. Therefore, Congress having
failed to provide the usual funds to continue the work of the Bureau,
the work was suspended at the end of the fiscal year. As all the
records and accumulated data are still intact in the Smithsonian
Institution, it is hoped and expected that it will still be found possible
to reorganize this important, unique international enterprise, as
nothing has appeared to take its place and the want of the classified
catalogue to the world’s literature of science is keenly felt alike by
librarians and workers in all fields of science.

Interest in and aid to bibliographies of scientific publications was
one of the first and has always been one of the main interests of the
Smithsonian Institution. Since 1901 these interests have centered in
the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, which through
international cooperation then began the publication of a complete
catalogue and index of the current scientific literature of the world.
War chaos made it necessary to suspend operations in 1922.

54
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 55

It was through the influence of the Royal Society that the cata-
logue was begun, and it stood financial sponsor for the enterprise
from the beginning. Each country taking part in the work bore
the total cost of indexing and classifying its own publications. This
cost was met, as a rule, by direct governmental grant. The United
States was represented through the Smithsonian Institution, an
appropriation being made each year by Congress for the mainte-
nance of the Bureau. The Central Bureau in London bore the
expense of editing and publishing the data prepared by the regional
bureaus and depended for its support entirely on funds received
from subscribers to the work.

The aim of the International Catalogue was not only to cite the
titles of scientific papers published since 1901, but briefly to supply
an analytical digest of the subject contents of each paper. This
was successfully accomplished in the following manner: To each one
of the sciences was assigned one of the letters of the alphabet, and
to each of the subheadings in these sciences was assigned a number.
In classifying the subject contents of a paper or book, instead of
writing an abstract, a letter and number referring to the classifica-
tion schedules were added to the citation for each important subject
treated, thus not only analyzing but classifying the author’s work.
The printed volumes were arranged first as author catalogues and
second as subject catalogues. In the subject catalogues the classi-
fied references were assembled and grouped under each of the common
heads to which they appertained, and furnished a ready means of
learning at a glance all that had been written on a given subject of
scientific investigation.

The International Catalogue of Scientific Literature was more than
an index; it was a condensed digest of the world’s scientific literature.

No such bibliographical service exists or ever existed until the
International Catalogue appeared, and when it is realized that the
most expensive part of the undertaking was furnished free through the
classified index references supplied by the 30 or more regional bureaus,
it is apparent that no private enterprise could hope to produce such
a catalogue.

Revolutionizing advances in many of the arts, industries, and trades
are often made by means of scientific research, and what today
appears to be an abstract investigation in pure science tomorrow
becomes a stepping stone to some epoch-making invention, which
either entirely changes an old or establishes a new trade or industry.
Hence a knowledge of the world’s scientific literature is not a luxury
but a necessity.

Today the field is only partially covered by other publications,
which, when assembled, are bulky, expensive, lack uniformity in
methods of reference, and in the aggregate leave many branches of
56 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

science unrepresented, all of which came within the scope of the
International Catalogue.

This is the situation today for current literature, and unless reor-
ganization of the International Catalogue can be accomplished, it is
hard to imagine what the future condition will be unless today’s
records are all indexed and classified in some uniform and available
form.

The World War stopped the publication of the catalogue, yet the
backbone of the undertaking, namely, international cooperation of
numerous self-supporting classifying bureaus, is still available. This
indispensable contribution is worth several hundred thousand dollars
a year.

The situation is now far simpler than it was when the organization
was founded in 1900, for then no precedent existed for such an inter-
national cooperative enterprise. Now, the successful publication of
238 volumes aggregating some 140,000 pages of the International
Catalogue is substantial and convincing proof that the original plan
was feasible. War and disorganized international conditions alone
were responsible for the necessity of suspending publication.

It would be difficult to find an object more worthy of endowment
than this unique, international cooperative organization, when worth-
while projects are being considered by individuals or foundations
desiring to aid the advance of knowledge and the welfare of mankind.

It is believed that abeyance of the great service formerly rendered
by the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature is temporary
only and that the work can eventually be resumed when the universal
upheaval now convulsing world affairs has somewhat subsided.

Respectfully submitted.

Assistant in Charge.

APPENDIX 9
REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the Smithsonian library for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1933:

THE LIBRARY

The library, or library system, of the Smithsonian Institution com-
prises considerably more than 800,000 volumes, pamphlets, and charts.
These are chiefly in the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress
and the libraries of the United States National Museum and the
Bureau of American Ethnology. The others are in the Smithsonian
office library, Langley aeronautical library, radiation and organisms
library, the libraries of the Astrophysical Observatory, Freer Gallery
of Art, National Gallery of Art, National Zoological Park, and the
various sectional libraries of the National Museum. While the col-
lections have to do with nearly all subjects, they concern themselves
largely with the natural sciences and technology.

EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS

The exchange work of the library showed a falling off from the pre-
vious year, due to the world-wide economic depression and the con-
sequent curtailment of funds of learned institutions and societies for
research and publication. Only 22,821 packages of publications—
21,103 by mail and 1,718 by the International Exchange Service—
were received, as against 24,651 in 1932. A corresponding decrease
was apparent in the number of items in the packages. For instance,
there were 4,592 dissertations, while the year before there were 5,340.
The library obtained 3,664 volumes and parts in response to special
requests from the various Smithsonian libraries—fewer by 469 than
in 1932. The new exchanges were 198, while the year before they
were 280. There was a very noticeable decrease in the want cards
for which favorable responses were received, the number from the
Smithsonian deposit and the Langley aeronautical library being
scarcely more than one half those for which publications were obtained
in 1932. Unusually important sendings came from the Académie des
Sciences, Belles-Lettres et Arts, Clermont-Ferrand; the Botanical
Society of South Africa, Cape Town; the Dansk Ornithologisk Central,
Viborg; the Landesmuseumsverein fiir Vorarlberg, Bregenz; the

57
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

Sodalitas Amicorum Universitatis Reg. Hung. Francisco-Josephinae,
Szeged; and such universities as California, Harvard, Manchester,
Pavia, Pennsylvania, and Yale. Dissertations were received from
the Academy of Freiberg, the Universities of Basel, Berlin, Bern,
Bonn, Braunschweig, Breslau, Budapest, Cornell, Erlangen, Freiberg,
Giessen, Greifswald, Halle, Heidelberg, Helsingfors, Jena, Johns Hop-
kins, Konigsberg, Leipzig, Louvain, Lund, Marburg, Neuchatel,
Pennsylvania, Rostock, Strasbourg, Tiibingen, Utrecht, and Ziirich,
and technical schools at Berlin, Braunschweig, Delft, Dresden,
Karlsruhe, and Ziirich.
GIFTS

There were many gifts, as usual, but only a few can be mentioned
here. From His Excellency, Eamon de Valera, President of the
Irish Free State, came a welcome copy of Hugh Lane and His Pic-
tures, by Thomas Bodkin, accompanied by a letter from the donor.
From Mrs. Frances F. Cleveland Preston came a copy of A True
Story of Some Eventful Years in Grandpa’s Life, by Henry E. Per-
rine—a rare work of botanical interest; from William K. Vanderbilt,
a copy of West Made East with the Loss of a Day, by the donor—a
worthy companion to other books previously presented by Mr. Van-
derbilt; from Mr. and Mrs. Lowell Brentano, a handsome 70-volume
set of Voltaire in the original; and from Mosho Kawabata, a collection
of Gyokusho’s works, in 2 volumes. Other gifts were the Handbook
of Museums (6 copies), issued by the American Association of Mu-
seums, from the association; Reports, in 11 volumes, of the President’s
Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership, from the editors;
Archaeologia Orientalis, volume 2, from the Far Eastern Archaeo™
logical Society ; The New Conquest of Central Asia, by Roy Chapman
Andrews, from the American Museum of Natural History; The Mon-
asteries of the Wadi ’n Natrdan, Part II, by Hugh G. Evelyn White-
from the Metropolitan Museum of Art; The Elephant, in 2 volumes,
by Etsujiro Sunamoto, from the author; An Introduction to Egyptian
Religion, by Alan W. Shorter, from the author; La Fayette, a Bibli-
ography, by Stuart W. Jackson, compiler, from William Edwin
Rudge; Selected Relics of Japanese Art, volumes 1-5, edited by 8.
Tajima, from Mrs. Charles D. Walcott, who also gave the library
many other publications. From Mrs. Isabel Brackenridge Hendry
was received a collection of letters written by John Torrey, Asa Gray,
Charles Pickering, Capt. Charles Wilkes, and others to Wiliam D.
Brackenridge, botanist of the United States Exploring Expedition of
1838-42, which added substantially to the manuscript material on
the expedition already in the library. Still other gifts included 2,000
or more publications, chiefly on ethnology and archeology, which
had belonged to the late Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, former Chief of the
Bureau of American Ethnology, from Mr. and Mrs. E. R. Stabler;
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 59

550 from the Biological Society of Washington; 283 from the Geo-
physical Laboratory; 235 from the American Association for the
Advancement of Science; 195 from the National Institute of Health;
66 from the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature; and 31
from the American Association of Museums. There were also gifts,
as usual, from many members of the Smithsonian staff, notably the
late Dr. Wiliam H. Holmes, who gave the library more than 600

publications.
SMITHSONIAN DEPOSIT

The Institution’s main library of 40,000 was in 1866 deposited in
the Library of Congress. There it has grown, by almost daily addi-
tions from the Smithsonian, to well over 500,000. The collection
relates especially to the natural sciences and technology, being par-
ticularly strong in monographs and journals and in the reports, pro-
ceedings, and transactions of learned institutions and societies.

In the course of the last fiscal year the Institution added to the
deposit 2,744 volumes, 10,202 parts of volumes, 3,117 pamphlets, and
109 charts. Among the items were 3,315 dissertations. Among
them, too, were 2,202 publications which the Smithsonian library
obtained in exchange in response to requests from the Smithsonian,
periodical, and order divisions of the Library of Congress—a decrease
of 243 from the year before. The number of foreign documents re-
ceived by the library and forwarded to the documents division of the
Library of Congress was much smaller than usual, as more of these
government publications, it is gratifying to report, are each year
being sent directly to the Library through the International Exchange
Service and fewer by way of the Smithsonian library. Portraits of
the Founder and five Secretaries of the Institution were presented to
the Library of Congress late in the year, to be hung in the Smithsonian
division with those of other scientists of note.

NATIONAL MUSEUM LIBRARY

The library of the United States National Museum numbers 84,580
volumes and 110,748 pamphlets. The additions in 1933 were 2,436
volumes and 786 pamphlets. The staff entered 10,458 periodicals—
1,433 more than the previous year. These included 1,296 volumes
and parts that they obtained in exchange as the result of checking
sets and writing special request letters. Owing to a reduction in the
allotment for binding, they sent only 895 volumes to the bindery,
although more were prepared. They cataloged 3,077 publications,
and added 20,242 cards to the catalogs and shelf lists. They also
did, as usual, most of the routine work for the library of the National
Gallery of Art. They forwarded to the files of the sectional libraries
5,901 publications, and lent to the curators and their associates 8,344.
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

Of the latter, 2,359 were borrowed from the Library of Congress and
535 from 20 other libraries. Publications were likewise lent to many
libraries throughout the United States and Canada. The publica-
tions returned to the Library of Congress numbered 2,527 and to
other libraries 608. The reference work of the staff was extensive
and at times complicated and difficult, much of it being in response
to requests from members of the scientific staff, but more than usual
in answer to questions from visiting scientists and from correspondents.
The sectional libraries to which the staff found time to give special
assistance were those of mammals, botany, ethnology, and physical
anthropology. These libraries, 35 in number, are as follows:

Administration Invertebrate paleontology
Associate director’s office Mammals

Agricultural history Marine invertebrates
Anthropology Medicine

Archeology Minerals

Biology Mollusks

Birds Organic chemistry
Botany Paleobotany
Echinoderms Photography

Editor’s office Physical anthropology
Engineering Property clerk’s office
Ethnology Reptiles and batrachians
Fishes Superintendent’s office
Foods Taxidermy

Geology Textiles

Graphic Arts Vertebrate paleontology
History Wood technology
Insects

OFFICE LIBRARY

The office library contains many standard reference works, the
publications of the Smithsonian and its affiliated bureaus and of some
of the older foreign societies and institutions, and several thousand
volumes of general interest. The library was increased during the
year by 114 volumes, 812 parts of volumes, and 9 pamphlets. The
staff made 809 catalog cards and filed 1,492, answered 241 reference
questions, and loaned 2,091 publications. There were about 3,000
visitors.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY LIBRARY

The library of the Bureau of American Ethnology consists of
30,391 volumes, 16,993 pamphlets, and a large number of unbound
magazines, chiefly on the North American Indian and other early
inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere. It also has some important
manuscripts, Indian vocabularies, and photographs. During the
last fiscal year the library was increased by 320 volumes and 126
pamphlets. The staff entered 3,440 periodicals, added 4,840 cards
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 61

to the catalog, loaned 2,134 publications, and rendered the usual
reference service, especially in connection with the scientific work of
the Bureau.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY LIBRARY

The library of the Astrophysical Observatory has 4,487 volumes
and 3,726 pamphlets, largely on the major subjects of interest to the
Observatory. The additions in 1932 were 130 volumes and 259
pamphlets. The staff entered 1,209 periodicals and prepared 607
cards for the catalog. The loans numbered 117.

RADIATION AND ORGANISMS LIBRARY

The library of radiation and organisms, which is the working
collection of the most recently established division under the Smith-
sonian, numbers 194 volumes, 10 pamphlets, and 6 charts. The
accessions for the year were 4 volumes, 300 parts of volumes, and 1
pamphlet.

LANGLEY AERONAUTICAL LIBRARY

The Langley aeronautical library, the nucleus of which came from
the third Secretary of the Institution and such of his associates as
Alexander Graham Bell, Octave Chanute, and James Means, num-
bers 1,954 volumes, 1,116 pamphlets, and 5 charts. Since 1930 most
of it has been deposited, under its own name and bookplate, in the
Library of Congress. The collection, while small, contains many
rare items, among which are sets of early aeronautical magazines,
It also has files of letters, photographs, and newspaper clippings.
During the last fiscal year the library was increased by 46 volumes,
519 parts of volumes, 30 pamphlets, and 5 charts.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

The library of the National Gallery of Art was given special atten-
tion late in the year, in connection with the work of reorganizing the
Smithsonian library system that has been going on for some time.
Increased space was provided for it and steel shelving installed, the
collection was sorted and roughly grouped, the sets were checked for
missing numbers and the numbers written for, and other steps were
taken preliminary to the making of a shelf list and catalog. This
will be the chief work of the staff during the coming year, that the
Gallery may have at the earliest possible moment library machinery
adequate to its needs.

The accessions during the year were unusually large, numbering
344 volumes, 428 parts of volumes, and 93 pamphlets. The collection
now has 1,678 volumes and 1,509 pamphlets, chiefly on the art of the
United States and Europe.
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

FREER GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

The library of the Freer Gallery of Art is concerned mainly with the
art and culture of the Far East, India, Persia, and the nearer East.
It has a number of works on American painters, particularly James
MeNeill Whistler, and on the Washington Manuscripts, the well-
known Biblical manuscripts of the fourth and fifth centuries, which
the Gallery owns. The main collection was increased during the
year by 180 volumes and 88 pamphlets and now numbers 4,857
volumes and 3,399 pamphlets. The field collection has about 800
volumes and 500 pamphlets. The staff entered 147 periodicals, sent
31 volumes to the bindery, added 2,730 cards to the catalog and shelf
list, and made many analytical index cards for articles in important

art journals.
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK LIBRARY

The additions to the library of the National Zoological Park were
1 volume and 11 parts of volumes, increasing this collection on
animals and their care to 1,222 eae and 410 pamphlets.

SUMMARY OF ACCESSIONS

SPECIAL ACTIVITIES

The staff arranged and classified the Berlandier manuscripts on the
natural history of Mexico; sorted out hundreds of publications that
had ceased to be useful to the Institution or its bureaus and trans-
ferred them to the Library of Congress, Patent Office, and Howard
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 63

University, or sent them back to the Superintendent of Documents;
checked the University of California publications in the library and
returned about 600 duplicates; sent consignments of Smithsonian
duplicates to Harvard University, Yale University, and the Marine
Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, in special exchange for recent
publications of these institutions that were needed by the library;
arranged for the return of many publications of the Institution and
its branches from libraries in which they were duplicates, that they
might again become available for exchange; and made notable progress
in reorganizing the technological library, in which 1,134 linear feet of
steel shelving were installed during the year.

FOUR IMPORTANT PROJECTS

The union catalog was advanced considerably, as the following
statistics will indicate:

The reorganization of the order department of the library was
practically completed, with the result that the accuracy and efficiency
of its procedure were greatly increased.

The file of the library’s exchange relations, begun early in the year,
showed marked progress, thanks to the cooperation of the publica-
tions offices of the Smithsonian and Museum with the library. It is
expected that the file will be well along by the close of the next fiscal
year. It becomes more and more useful, especially as an aid in
determining the value of each exchange to the work of the Institution.

A noteworthy beginning was also made on the dictionary index to
the publications of the Institution and its bureaus referred to in the
report for 1932. Library of Congress cards for the Smithsonian
Annual Report volumes to date and part of the Proceedings of the
National Museum were obtained and most of them filed. The next
Smithsonian series to receive attention will be the Miscellaneous
Collections. It may be added in this connection that the preparation
of a manuscript index to the first 36 volumes of the Proceedings—
which, when the task was undertaken early in the year, were the only
volumes issued by the Institution or its bureaus for which no Library
of Congress cards were available—was finished by the staff and sent
to the Library. Already cards have been printed for half or more
of the volumes in question.

Respectfully submitted.

OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR

APPROPRIATIONS

Provision for the maintenance of the United States National
Museum for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1933, made by appropria-
tions carried in the Executive and Independent Offices Act approved
June 30, 1932, was subsequently affected by the Economy Act
(legislative appropriation act for 1933). Funds available for Museum
operations were as follows:

70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

For the Museum, the appropriations for 1933 were $8,960 less than
those for 1932, the reduction under preservation of collections being
$2,750 and under maintenance and operation $6,210. Under preserva-
tion of collections, the reduction was taken from the amount available
for supplies, and under maintenance and operation from the funds
provided for repairs and replacements to buildings.

Under the Economy Act (pt. 2, legislative appropriation act for
1933), approved June 30, 1932, provision was made for the impound-
ing of certain items connected with the funds allotted for personnel.
Total amounts so impounded during the year under the National
Museum were $87,027.34, of which $74,031.60 came from the appropria-
tion preservation of collections and $12,995.74 from maintenance and
operation. Under preservation of collections, $56,252.54 came from
stipulated salary reductions and was thus made up by the personnel
included under this appropriation. The remaining funds impounded
under this heading totaled $17,769.05 and consisted of salaries of
vacant positions. The latter amount therefore was a direct reduc-
tion in appropriation, since it lowered the amount available for tem-
porary personnel and made impossible the utilization of savings on the
salary roll for the purchase of miscellaneous supplies, the allotment
for which has always been inadequate. Under maintenance and
operation, $8,230.74 was impounded as a result of salary reductions,
while $4,764 resulted from the impounding of salaries of vacant
positions. The latter amount was a direct reduction of the appropria-
tion, since it lowered the amount available for temporary services
and the purchase of supplies and equipment for the mechanics. The
impounding of salaries for vacant positions thus withdrew $22,534.06
from funds usually available.

The sum available for printing and binding was decreased $27,646
below the amount of the previous year. This reduction is a serious
one, since the printing of manuscripts is now greatly in arrears, and
additional funds for this purpose are much needed.

No additions to the personnel of the Museum were made during the
year, and a serious condition resulting from an undermanned force
continued. More help is urgently needed in the clerical service and
the guard and labor forces and also in the scientific personnel. The
Museum is greatly overcrowded, and under present conditions the
proper exhibition and care of the collections with the available
personnel are becoming increasingly difficult.

Arrangements looking toward additional space for the Museum
have been outlined in previous reports. Congress has authorized
appropriations of $6,500,000 for building wings at each end of the
Natural History Building, but this authorization like all others was
reduced 10 percent (legislative act for 1933, 212, sec. 320). Plans for
the additions have been made by the Allied Architects, Inc., of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM al

Washington, D.C., under an appropriation of $10,000 in the second
deficiency bill of 1931 and have been approved by the Fine Arts
Commission. The building of these wings has been submitted as the
principal construction project recommended for the Smithsonian
Institution under the National Industrial Recovery Act. If the
required funds are allotted, the first major step in the plan for ade-
quate museums and galleries under the Institution will be under way,
and work can begin on the construction without delay.

COLLECTIONS

Steady addition of excellent material to the collections continued
throughout the year, the new accessions including hundreds of speci-
mens of the most valuable kind. They came in 1,698 separate
accessions, with a total of 348,012 specimens, divided among the
various departments as follows: Anthropology, 4,877 ; biology, 295,782;
geology, 37,555; arts and industries, 4,261; history, 5,537. Statement
regarding some of the important additions will be found in the reports
of the departments that follow, and they are all included in the acces-
sion list. The total increase for the previous year was 157,870 speci-
mens of all kinds.

For examination and report 1,575 lots of material were received,
including much of a botanical and geological nature, and many indi-
vidual specimens. Part was returned by request to the senders,
when it was not consumed during analysis, and part retained for the
collections under arrangement with the donors.

Gifts of specimens to schools and other educational organizations
numbered 5,558 specimens, including collections of mollusks and
fishes, sets to illustrate rock weathering and soils, and illustrative
groups of rocks, ores, and minerals. Exchanges of duplicate materials
with other institutions and individuals totaled 45,872 specimens, and
12 specimens were transferred to other departments. Loans to
workers outside of Washington numbered 24,552 individual specimens.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

Investigations in the field covered the usual wide range of interests
connected with man, the lower animals, and plants, both living and
extinct. The work was carried on mainly through grants from the
72 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

general income of the Smithsonian Institution, assisted by contribu-
tions from individuals, while certain projects were financed through
the income of special funds held as endowments by the Smithsonian.
Financial assistance in field expenses from the annual governmental
appropriations for the National Museum was small and concerned only
part of the various projects. Funds to assist in these matters, especi-
ally from private sources, are one of the definite needs of our
organization.

Archeological work in northern Alaska was continued during the
summer of 1932 by James A. Ford under the general direction of
Henry B. Collins, Jr. Mr. Ford arrived at Point Barrow late in
August 1931, when the ground was beginning to freeze. He found ice
conditions in the Arctic the worst in many years, and so remained at
Barrow through the winter in order to allow a full season of excava-
tion in the summer of 1932. He returned to Washington in November
1932. Barrow seems the most promising locality at which to find
dependable evidence of the relationship between the old Bering Sea
culture and the Thule, the dominant prehistoric Eskimo culture of the
eastern Arctic regions. In addition to archeological material Mr.
Ford obtained the skull of a bowhead whale and a series of birds.

From February 18 to June 5, 1933, Frank M. Setzler, assistant
curator of archeology, continued archeological investigations in south-
western Texas, restricting this year’s work to the Pecos River area,
to trace the eastern limits of the cave culture. One large cave over-
looking the Pecos and a medium-sized shelter near Deadmans Canyon
were completely excavated. It is not yet practicable to evaluate the
results of this third season in the Big Bend area, but the cultutal
material recovered obviously belongs to the same horizon as that found
farther west. Though a general relationship to the Basket Maker
culture of the Southwest is apparent in the material collected both in
1932 and 1933, enough distinct characteristics appear in the remains
that Mr. Setzler has exposed in Texas to warrant a temporary desig-
nation as the Big Bend cave culture. Neither pottery nor any other
class of artifact commonly used by archeologists in establishing a
relative chronology has yet been found in association with remains
peculiar to these cave dwellers of ancient Texas, and no bond has been
discovered to connect them definitely with any other primitive group
known in the Rio Grange drainage. One result of the 1932 expedition
was the finding of 27 bones of the California condor (Gymnogyps
californianus) associated with human remains in a cave on the south
tip of Mule Ear Peaks. This is the first indication of the former
existence of this bird in Texas and is the largest collection of bones
recovered outside its present range. In his 1933 investigations, as in
those of previous years, Mr. Setzler was greatly assisted by the staff
of the United States Bureau of Plant Quarantine at San Antonio.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 13

On his way to Washington late in May, Mr. Setzler spent a week in
east-central Louisiana investigating mounds and village sites that
available data indicated might be related to the so-called ‘‘ Hopewell
culture” of the northern Mississippi Valley. The results of this brief
examination are such as to warrant more intensive research.

In order to complete the enormous task of reorganizing its collec-
tions and exhibits, the division of Old World archeology deferred
actual field work for the year. Assistant Curator J. Townsend
Russell, however, spent a brief period in France during midsummer
in connection with the cooperative investigations inaugurated in
November 1931 between the University of Toulouse and the Smith-
sonian Institution.

Dr. AleS Hrdliéka conducted an anthropological and archeological
survey of Kodiak Island and made extensive excavations at Uyak
Bay, Alaska. These excavations, which have already yielded much
valuable and new material, are now more than a third finished.

Dr. R.S. Bassler, head curator of geology, spent several weeks in the
Mississippi Valley collecting Silurian and Mississippian echinoderms
for the Springer collection. Several hundred crinoids and blastoids
and many specimens of other classes of fossils were obtained, and some
interesting facts in silicification and related phenomena were checked.

Under the auspices of the Canfield fund, E. P. Henderson spent 4
months collecting minerals, rocks, and ores in the Rocky Mountain
States, assisted by F. A. Gonyer, of Harvard University. Among the
districts visited were the geode region about Keokuk, Iowa; the Black
Hills of South Dakota; Butte and Helena, Mont.; Coeur d’Alene,
Idaho; Park City, Bingham, Thomas Range, and other localities in
Utah; the carnotite fields of Colorado and Utah; and Leadville,
Breckenridge, Alma, and Cripple Creek, Colo. Among the material
obtained were a huge quartz geode, numerous well-crystallized copper
minerals, and rare vanadium minerals.

Dr. W. F. Foshag, accompanied by James Benn, visited the mica and
gem mines about Amelia, Va., and collected a number of rare minerals.
Mr. Benn also explored a newly discovered cave near Beaver Creek,
Md., and obtained unusual stalagmitic growths of beautiful and
perfect form.

Explorations for the division of stratigraphic paleontology were
made by Dr. G. A. Cooper during 6 weeks spent in the richly fossilif-
erous country on Gaspé Peninsula, Quebec, resulting in the acquisition
of many fine fossils. Following this Dr. Cooper made stratigraphic
studies in New York State’s classical sequence of Devonian rocks.
Though supplementary to previous studies by Dr. Cooper in this
State, this year’s task was to trace the stratigraphic units eastward
from the Unadilla Valley. The needed columnar sections were pre-
pared, and many specimens, some new to science, were obtained.
74 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

As the field expedition under C. W. Gilmore, curator of vertebrate
paleontology, extended well into the present year, only brief mention
was made of it in last year’s report. This expedition in the Oligocene
of Montana, western Nebraska, southeastern South Dakota, and
eastern Wyoming brought gratifying results in the acquisition of a
large and representative collection of this important fauna. Out-
standing among many valuable specimens is a nearly complete skeleton
of an eagle of a type distinct from any hitherto known.

An important accomplishment of the department of biology was the
organization of the Johnson-Smithsonian Deep-Sea Expedition, under
the direction of Dr. Paul Bartsch, curator of mollusks and Cenozoic
invertebrates, and the successful completion of the first of a series of
cruises planned for oceanographic work. Eldridge R. Johnson in the
fall of 1932 placed his palatial yacht Caroline at the disposal of the
Smithsonian Institution for the purpose of deep-sea exploration, to-
gether with funds for equipment of the vessel, necessary gear and
instruments, and an adequate scientific staff. At the suggestion of
Dr. Bartsch an oceanographic survey of the Puerto Rican Deep was
undertaken. Various agencies of the Government interested in
oceanographic work, including bureaus in the Navy, Agriculture, and
Commerce Departments, rendered valuable assistance in the way of
suggestions and material, as did the authorities of the Carnegie
Institution of Washington, the Oceanographic Institution of Woods
Hole, the American Museum of Natural History, Dr. William Beebe,
and others. The gathering of equipment and its installation began in
October, and on January 21, 1933, the Caroline left New York.

The program for the cruise was carried out successfully, and on
March 14 the Caroline returned to Washington loaded with valuable
collections, embracing many forms of life unknown to science, and
with extensive observations in the various branches of oceanography,
all of which are now in the hands of specialists for study. During
the cruise more than 900 soundings were made, and serial gatherings
of water samples and temperatures were taken down to 3,200 fathoms.
Collections were made at 109 stations, mostly at depths below 200
fathoms, with gear ranging from tangles to dredges, beam trawls,
otter trawls, and intermediate nets. Several cores were taken, and
morning and evening observations of air draft were made by means
of pilot balloons observed through a theodolite. It is planned to
continue the work during another cruise in the same general area.

Another important marine expedition was that of Dr. Waldo L.
Schmitt, curator of marine invertebrates, to the Galapagos Islands on
the yacht Velero IIJ, through invitation of Capt. G. Allan Hancock,
owner of the ship and leader of the expedition. Dr. Schmitt em-
barked at Los Angeles on December 28, 1932, and returned on March
25, 1933. Fully equipped for scientific work both on land and sea
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM (es

and with a staff representing several branches of zoology, the expedi-
tion visited 11 of the 16 principal islands of the Galapagos Archi-
pelago and 13 other places on the coasts of South and Central America
and Mexico, including the Malpelo, Cocos, and Isabel Islands. The
expedition obtained large series of invertebrates of which a first set
of Crustacea, to which Dr. Schmitt paid special attention, becomes
the property of the National Museum. Many additions to scientific
knowledge in this group are included in these collections.

Dr. Hugh M. Smith continued explorations in Siam covering
various parts of the country not previously visited. The work
included a trip up the tortuous Pasak River, which marks the bound-
ary between central Siam and the eastern plateau, journeys to Sam
Roy Yot (Three Hundred Peaks) in western Siam, and to the moun-
tain-forest jungle of the northwestern corner of Siam. The large
collections of mammals, birds, reptiles, and mollusks received testify
to Dr. Smith’s continued interest in the Museum and will yield many
scientific novelties.

Collections received from Dr. D. C. Graham indicate that he has
safely returned to his old field in western China and has resumed his
zoological activities in behalf of the Smithsonian Institution. Con-
tinuation of his former explorations has been planned in cooperation
with the recently established West China Museum.

Dr. Alan Mozley, awarded the Walter Rathbone Bacon traveling
scholarship under the Smithsonian Institution for study of the land
and fresh-water molluscan fauna of Siberia, had a successful season
during the summer of 1932. Through the cooperation of local
authorities he was enabled to carry out plans for a visit to the Akhmo-
linsk Steppe and to the taiga north of Tomsk. Thanks to the
generous assistance of the director of the limnological station at Lake
Baikal, he was able to spend nearly 2 months in the Baikal region,
where he circumnavigated the lake in the motor yacht of the station
and made various land excursions. During the winter Dr. Mozley
worked on his collections at the University of Edinburgh, where
facilities were generously provided him.

Dr. Herbert Friedmann, curator of birds, through the courtesy of
Hobart Ames, visited Grand Junction, Tenn., to study a curious red
phase among the quail found in that locality. Dr. A. Wetmore,
assistant secretary, during a trip to New Mexico and Arizona, col-
lected series of bird skins and skeletons.

The beginning of the year found Dr. J. M. Aldrich, curator of
insects, west of the Rocky Mountains collecting Diptera, work that
was completed the middle of August. P. W. Oman, of the Bureau
of Entomology, made an extended trip by automobile through the
northwestern United States to obtain specimens of leafhoppers and
other homopterous insects, and returned with many valuable addi-
tions to the Museum collections.
76 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt spent the first 6 weeks of the year at the
marine laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington at Dry
Tortugas, Fla., in continuation of studies of the crustacean fauna of
the region. A comprehensive collection of marine invertebrates,
mainly crustaceans, was brought back.

During the early part of the year Dr. Paul Bartsch continued
studies of Cerion colonies on the Florida Keys, with the financial
assistance of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. On his return
he collected mollusks on several mountain peaks of the southern
Alleghenies.

Austin H. Clark made several trips to the region included in the
proposed Shenandoah National Park in furtherance of a project for
coordinating and extending knowledge of the biology of the area, in
cooperation with the National Park Service, the United States
Bureau of Public Roads, and the Virginia State Commission on Con-
servation and Development.

In July and August 1932, J. R. Swallen, assistant botanist in the
section of grasses, collected in Yucatan under a cooperative arrange-
ment between the United States Department of Agriculture, the
University of Michigan, and the Carnegie Institution of Washington,
in connection with a biological survey of the Mayan area. The col-
lection obtained, about 1,000 specimens, has increased the known
grass flora of the region by more than 50 percent. C. V. Morton,
aid in the division of plants, left in March for a 3-months’ botanical
exploration in Oaxaca. Because of an unfavorable season and Mr.
Morton’s illness, this work, which was conducted with the kind
assistance of Dr. Emil Makrinius, of Pochutla, had to be considerably
curtailed. The 2,000 specimens collected, however, will prove valu-
able, since they come from a region little represented in the National
Herbarium.

During the summer of 1932, Prof. C. E. Burt, of Southwestern
College, Winfield, Kans., carried on field work in herpetology designed
to obtain series of turtles in the region of the upper reaches of the
Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers. The Museum has long needed
material from that portion of the Appalachian system. The trip,
made by automobile, was eminently successful and resulted in large
and important collections.

During the Peary Memorial expedition to the west coast of Green-
land, under command of Capt. R. A. Bartlett, arranged by the Peary
family, Arthur D. Norcross, and friends, Captain Bartlett obtained
a large collection of marine invertebrates mostly from the vicinity
of Cape York, which with customary generosity he presented to the
Museum.

W. G. Sheldon and Richard Borden, during July, August, and
September 1932, undertook a second expedition to the mountain
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 77

region in east-central British Columbia, reaching Mount Selwyn on
the Peace River on July 17 and Hudson Hope on August 1. The
Sukunka River, which drains the mountains just south of Pine Pass,
was investigated to its source, and a grizzly bear was collected. The
expedition, difficult and arduous, terminated at the railroad at
Dawson Creek, and was highly successful in its collections, which
included a moose, a grizzly bear, mountain goats, wolves, red fox,
marten, weasels, marmots, rabbits, squirrels, and various smaller
mammals.
EDUCATIONAL WORK

The National Museum during the year continued its customary
activities in educational lines. Our exhibition halls display great
series of objects so arranged as to demonstrate facts of many kinds,
on subjects ranging from the tools and dress of primitive man to
complicated modern machinery, examples of the life of strange lands,
of the elements that compose the earth, fossil animals and plants
of former ages, and many other things. Descriptive labels accom-
pany all these, and there is constant change to keep them properly
arranged and up to date. The whole serves as a compendium of
reference to the student or as an attractive display to the one of more
casual interest, from which all may profit according to their desires.

In addition, the Museum is constantly active in the dissemination
of knowledge in response to many hundreds of inquiries that come
by mail or from visitors. Classes from the city schools are guided
through the halls, and groups of students from a distance are given
similar service. Although the Museum does not maintain regular
series of lectures, members of the staff are called on regularly to
address meetings. Students throughout the country interested in
definite problems come to work with our collections and libraries,
and frequently workers from abroad are engaged in investigations
here that sometimes continue for months. Thus it may be seen how
widely varied is the range of our educational activities and how
extensive the field that they cover.

VISITORS

The Museum buildings were open to visitors during the year on
week days from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and on Sundays from 1:30 to
4:30 p.m., except the Aircraft Building, which was open only on week
days. All the buildings were closed all day on Christmas and New
Year’s Days, and part of the day on December 24, 26, and 31, Jan-
uary 2, and March 4.

The total number of visitors to the various Museum buildings
during the year was 1,427,358, or 202,672 less than during 1931-32,
a decrease clearly reflecting economic conditions throughout the
78 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

country. The average attendance for week days was 3,825 and for
Sundays 4,571. The number of visitors to the Smithsonian Building
on week days was 183,928, a daily average of 591, and on Sundays
40,561, an average of 780; to the Arts and Industries Building
478,160 on week days (average, 1,537) and 103,642 on Sundays
(average, 1,993); to the Natural History Building 426,514 on week
days (average, 1,371) and 93,463 on Sundays (average, 1,797); and
to the Aircraft Building 101,091, a daily average of 325.

Table 1 shows the number of visitors during each month for the
past year.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 79

tions and Fossils of South Manchuria, by Riuji Endo; and small
editions for office use of the complete volumes 79, 80, and 81 of the
Proceedings of the National Museum. Forty-one separate papers
published include 2 in the Bulletins and 39 in the Proceedings.

The distribution of volumes and separates to libraries and indi-
viduals on the regular mailing lists aggregated 71,294 copies; while
in addition 14,256 copies of publications issued during this and pre-
vious years were supplied in response to special requests. The
mailing lists have been revised to avoid loss in distribution.

During the year 504,770 forms, labels, and other items were printed
and 970 volumes were bound.

LIBRARY

In the library system of the Smithsonian Institution, the National
Museum Library is second in importance only to the Smithsonian
deposit in the Library of Congress. Its collections, concerned
chiefly with natural history and technology, were increased during
the year by 2,436 volumes and 786 pamphlets, and now number
84,580 volumes and 110,748 pamphlets. The accessions came, as
usual, from four sources: Purchases, gifts, exchanges, and binding
periodicals.

Gifts were received from many members and associates of the
Museum staff. Mrs. Charles D. Walcott gave the library many
publications, as did also the late Dr. William H. Holmes, former
director of the National Gallery of Art, his gifts for the year totaling
more than 600. Important gifts also were received by assignment
from the Smithsonian Institution. One was a collection of letters
written by Asa Gray, John Torrey, Charles Pickering, Capt. Charles
Wilkes, and others of the United States exploring expedition, 1838-42,
to William D. Brackenridge, a prominent botanist of the expedition.
The collection was presented to the Institution by Mrs. Isabel Brack-
enridge Hendry, acting for the grandchildren of Mr. Brackenridge.
It constitutes a valuable addition to the manuscript material on the
subject already in the library.

The staff kept the current work up to date and performed certain
extra activities. They entered 10,458 periodicals, or 1,433 more than
in 1932. Among these were 204 volumes and 1,092 parts that they
obtained by special exchange letters in the process of completing
standard sets. They also began 86 new exchanges for the Museum;
sent 795 volumes to the bindery; cataloged 2,108 volumes, 954 pam-
phlets, and 15 charts; and added 20,242 cards to the catalogs and
shelf lists. Until toward the close of the year the library work for the
National Gallery of Art was done, as usual, by the main library staff;
it consisted of entering 428 periodicals and cataloging 344 volumes and
80 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

93 pamphlets. The number of volumes and parts sent to the sectional
libraries for filing was 5,901. The number of intramural loans was
8,344, of which more than a third were made at the loan desk in the
Arts and Industries Building. Of these, 2,359 publications were
borrowed from the Library of Congress and 535 from other libraries,
including those of the Department of Agriculture, Geological Survey,
Army Medical Museum; and the Boston Public Library, Cleveland
Public Library, John Crerar Library, Newberry Library; the libraries
of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, American Mu-
seum of Natural History, Arnold Arboretum, Field Museum of
Natural History, Museum of Comparative Zoology, Peabody Museum;
and Columbia, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Michigan, Pennsylvania,
Princeton, and Yale Universities. In all, 42 publications were bor-
rowed from libraries out of town, and 30 lent to them. The number
of publications returned to the Library of Congress was 2,526 and to
other libraries 608.

The staff filed the Wistar Institute cards to date and sorted and
distributed the systematic set of the Concilium Bibliographicum
cards to the sectional libraries. They began the rearrangement and
classifying of the contents of the manuscript case, taking up first the
Berlandier manuscripts, consisting of several thousand pages mainly
on the natural history of Mexico. They returned hundreds of publi-
cations no longer needed to the Superintendent of Documents, and
transferred other hundreds to the Library of Congress, the Patent
Office, and Howard University.

One of the most important tasks of the staff during the year was
making analyticals for the first 36 volumes of the Proceedings of the
National Museum. This work was undertaken in cooperation with
the Library of Congress, to which the 1,694 manuscript cards prepared
were sent for printing, and completes the analysis of this well-known
set of Museum publications. Library of Congress printed cards will
soon be available for all the publications that have been issued by the
Smithsonian Institution and its bureaus. Several sets of these cards
are being received by the library, of which two are being filed in the
union and Museum catalogs. One is also being used as the basis of
the dictionary index that was begun at the Smithsonian early in the
year. Finally, the difficult task of reorganizing the technological
library in the Old Museum was notably advanced. The wooden
shelving in the north gallery on the third floor was replaced by steel
to the extent of 1,134 linear feet, the collections were reshelved, and
a careful reading of the shelves was begun, preparatory to taking an
inventory.

As time permitted, the staff continued to render special assistance
in solving the problems of the sectional libraries, including those of the
divisions of mammals, botany, and physical anthropology.

PHOTOGRAPHIC LABORATORY

The photographic laboratory made during the year 3,025 negatives,
20,037 prints, 867 lantern slides, and 104 enlargements; developed 98
rolls of film and 48 film packs; and dry-mounted 39 prints. This
work represents a slight increase over last year in the number of
negatives and prints made, and was required by the National Museum
and by the National Gallery of Art and the Bureau of American
Ethnology, whose photographic needs are supplied by the laboratory
through a cooperative arrangement.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

Repairs and alterations—Among the more important repairs and
alterations to Museum buildings performed during the year are the
following:

The exterior walls of the Natural History Building were washed by
a detail of firemen from the District of Columbia Fire Department.

The plaster ceiling and side walls in the north lobby, Natural
History Building, were given three coats of paint, and other painting
was done as needed, both interior and exterior, including the tin roofs
of the Arts and Industries Building and the Smithsonian Building.

The women’s comfort room in the Natural History Building was
thoroughly renovated.

The large second-floor east-corner room and the small room adjoin-
ing it, in the Arts and Industries Building, were remodeled in the
spring of 1933 for the occupancy of the associate director and his
assistants. The small anteroom was also renovated. Also, room
90 was remodeled for the use of the new illustrator.

The cafe dining room in the Arts and Industries Building was
remodeled, the walls and ceiling covered with composition board, and
new fixtures installed.

Work was completed on the installation of the pneumatic collecting
and conveying system in the two woodworking rooms in the carpenter
shop for removing sawdust.

The work of dismantling the George Washington Bicentennial Art
Exhibit was completed in January. The two stone lions on the pedes-
tals at each side of the south steps, Natural History Building, were
removed and shipped to Newport News, Va., for permanent exhibi-
tion. Several of the plaster figures remained in the rotunda, having
been presented to the National Gallery of Art.

Heat, light, and power.—The heat, light, and power plant, located
in the Natural History Building, was in continuous operation for
about 8 months of the year. The consumption of coal was somewhat
more than it was last year, but not above the average for the past few
years. For heat, light, and power production 3,297.1 tons of bitu-
minous coal were purchased at $4.62 a ton.
82 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

The electric current purchased for the Arts and Industries Building
during the year amounted to 124,790 kilowatt-hours and cost $2,849.66,
while the current purchased during the summer for the other buildings
was 264,310 kilowatt-hours and cost $4,645.08, which makes a total of
389,100 kilowatt-hours purchased at a cost of $7,494.74. The rate
per kilowatt-hour was 1.93 cents, which is materially less than for
last year, owing primarily to the fact that the current for the Arts and
Industries Building was on a different schedule. The current
generated in the Museum plant was 621,384 kilowatt-hours, produced
at a cost of 1.63 cents a kilowatt-hour.

When the new lead-covered cables were purchased last year for
enlarging the connection between the Museum lines and the Potomac
Electric Power Co. cables where they enter the Natural History
Building on the north side, the central line was not increased. To
make this connection safe, a new 500,000 circular mils cable was
bought and will be installed during the coming year.

A good deal of electrical repair work has been done during the year,
including not only regular repair and upkeep, but also installation of
new wiring systems where the old wires have been found to be
overloaded or defective.

Repair work too has been necessary on some of the elevators,
especially the automatic push-button elevator in the east end of the
Smithsonian Building, which for safety’s sake should be replaced by
a manually operated car at the earliest possible time.

New electric-light equipment to be installed includes 191 ceiling
fixtures purchased for the third floor of the Natural History Building.

The lighting of the stamp collection, in the Arts and Industries
Building, which has been desired for a long time, has now been com-
pleted. This consists of white porcelain-lined inverted trough reflec-
tors supported from the tops of the cases in such a way as to deflect
the light down against each surface of the slides on which the stamps
are mounted. The method has proved very satisfactory and efficient.

To provide convenient connections for the tweive 500-watt reflec-
tors purchased last year for added interior illumination of the dome
of the Natural History Building, 12 outlet boxes with twin receptacles
have been installed around the rotunda on the fourth floor, with direct
control in the engine room.

The installation of small, low-voltage lamps for microscopic work
in the National Herbarium has gone forward. This method of
furnishing light for such work was begun last year, and has proved so
satisfactory that it has been called for by other workers.

The new heating system at the north front of the Smithsonian
Building was completed and was in operation throughout the year.
Further improvement in heating efficiency was effected by replacing
with new low radiators, in various offices in the Natural History
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 83

Building, the radiators of the taller type, some of which were badly
situated. Work has progressed, too, on the installation, begun last
year, of new pipe in the hot-water system in the Natural History
Building. This pipe, brass instead of galvanized iron, will tend to
retard the accumulation of scale and dirt and thus aid in the proper
flow and distribution of the water. Because of the congested location
of the old equipment, the tank and other new apparatus are to be
placed in the east end of the engine room.

Ice production.—The refrigerating machine, located in the base-
ment of the Natural History Building, for manufacturing ice for all
the Museum buildings, was operated a total of 4,058 hours during
the year and produced 413.9 tons of ice at a cost of $827.68, or at the
rate of $2 a ton (35 cents a ton less than for last year). During the
extremely hot weather, it was necessary to purchase 12}; tons of ice,
at a cost of $3.80 a ton.

Fire protection.—The fire alarms in the various Museum buildings
have been regularly inspected and tested, the fire hose examined and
the plugs flushed, and the sprinkler system in the Aircraft Building
properly cared for.

In the Arts and Industries Building some progress was made in
reducing fire hazards along lines recommended by the Federal Fire
Council. The improvements include filling window openings and
open arches with plaster block, replacing wooden partitions with
plaster block, replacing old electric wiring with modern wiring, and
replacing wooden library shelves with steel shelves. Although many
of the fire hazards still remain, especially in the Smithsonian Building
and the Arts and Industries Building, they are being removed as
rapidly as funds permit, and fire protection is being generally improved.

Furniture and fixtures —The furniture added during the year in-
cluded 10 exhibition cases, 365 pieces of storage, office, laboratory,
and other furniture, and 2,373 drawers, boxes, and frames of various
kinds. During the same period, 19 exhibition cases and bases, 93
pieces of storage, office, and laboratory furniture, and 112 wooden
drawers were condemned as unfit for further use.

An inventory of furniture on hand June 30, 1933, showed 3,743
exhibition cases and bases, 17,001 pieces of storage, office, and lab-
oratory furniture, and 103,062 drawers, boxes, and frames.

MEETINGS AND RECEPTIONS

The facilities of the auditorium and lecture room are offered by the
Museum to scientific and educational organizations for regular and
special meetings, and whenever possible it assists in carrying out
their programs. Ninety-five such meetings were held in the audi-
torium and lecture room during the year by a wide range of societies
and organizations.

7217485 ——1
84 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

Memorial meeting —To commemorate the many years of service in
the Smithsonian Institution of Prof. William Henry Holmes, who
died on April 20, 1933, a memorial meeting was held on the morning
of April 22, Dr. Abbot presiding. The meeting was widely attended
by his coworkers and friends.

Receptions.—On the evening of January 26, 1933, a reception was
held by the Washington Real Estate Board in connection with the
convention in Washington of the National Organization of Real
Estate Boards. The foyer and all the first floor of the Natural
History Building were open for the occasion.

About 1,775 persons attended an informal reception given on the
evening of March 28, 1933, in the Natural History Building by the
American Chemical Society, convening in Washington at that time.
Music was furnished by the United States Marine Band, and motion
pictures on chemical subjects were shown in the auditorium.

The Congress of Physicians and Surgeons held a reception for
Members of Congress on the evening of May 9, 1933, in the rotunda,
art gallery, and auditorium of the Natural History Building. Nearly
1,500 persons attended.

Gellatly Art Collection opening.—The official opening of the Gellatly
Art Collection took place in the Natural History Building on the
evening of June 22, 1933. Secretary and Mrs. Abbot, Assistant
Secretary and Mrs. Wetmore, and the Acting Director of the National
Gallery of Art and Mrs. Tolman received.

Special exhibits —The annual forestry notebook contest, under the
auspices of the public schools of the District of Columbia, was held in
the foyer of the Natural History Building, November 16 to 28, 1932.
Some of the notebooks were attached to Museum floor screens, while
others were exhibited on temporary tables furnished by the Museum.

The wooden screens forming alcoves on both sides of the foyer in
the Natural History Building were used from December 10, 1932,
until January 10, 1933, for an exhibit of architectural drawings from
the architectural departments of colleges and schools in the District
of Columbia, which was held under the auspices of the Washington
Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. The exhibition
was opened on the evening of December 10, with a reception in the
foyer. Drawings were exhibited by the following institutions: George
Washington University, University of Maryland, Central High School,
Catholic University of America, Gallaudet College, and McKinley
High School.

From March 30 to April 14, 1933, four alcoves on the west side of
the foyer were assigned for an exhibit of material collected under the
direction of Dr. Paul Bartsch on the Johnson-Smithsonian Deep Sea
Expedition. The deep-sea specimens, in jars, were placed on plain
wooden shelves installed on the semipermanent screens.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 85

The foyer was occupied from April 17 until May 5, 1933, for an
exhibition of public school art under the auspices of the Eastern Arts
Association, and from May 8 to 20 part of the foyer was given over to
an exhibition of colored posters on wild-flower preservation, under the
auspices of the Wild Flower Preservation Society.

CHANGES IN ORGANIZATION AND STAFF

The changes this year in organization and staff were caused chiefly
by the compulsory retirement on June 30, 1932, of a number of
employees in key positions. The retirement of W. deC. Ravenel
deprived the department of arts and industries of its director and the
division of history of its administrative supervisor. The duties of
both of these offices were on July 1, 1932, temporarily assumed by
J. EK. Graf, associate director of the Museum. On September 6, 1932,
the position of director of the department of arts and industries was
replaced by a new position of head curator—bringing the department
in line with the natural history departments—and Carl W. Mitman,
curator of engineering, was advanced to the head curatorship. Frank
A. Taylor, assistant curator of engineering, succeeded Mr. Mitman as
curator of the division of engineering. ‘The division of history con-
tinued to remain an independent division, reporting to the head of
the Museum through the associate director.

In the department of biology, the assistant curatorship of the
division of fishes, vacated by the retirement of Barton A. Bean on
June 30, 1932, was filled on January 3, 1933, by the appointment
of Dr. George S. Myers. Dr. Horace G. Richards, assistant curator in
the division of mollusks, resigned on September 10, 1932.

In the department of anthropology, the position of scientific aide
that had been held by Richard A. Allen was abolished, and the clerical
force was strengthened by the appointment of an assistant clerk-
stenographer for the division of ethnology.

In the department of geology, James Benn was made scientific
aide on March 1, 1933, taking over part of the work formerly done
by Miss Margaret W. Moodey.

In the mechanical shops, H. C. Taylor, head of the paint shop, who
retired on June 30, 1932, was succeeded on September 6, 1932, by
William Crossingham, who had been associated with this branch of
the Museum work for over 30 years.

In the administration office, James G. Traylor, appointment clerk,
was retired on June 30, 1932, but he continued as clerk to the Board
of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution. On January 16, 1933,
the appointment work of the Smithsonian Institution was consoli-
dated with the classification and retirement work, and Miss Helen
A. Olmsted, from the administrative office of the Museum, was made
personnel officer of the Institution.
86 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

On August 29, 1932, Carl W. Mitman was appointed contact officer
to represent the Smithsonian Institution in its participation in the
Century of Progress Exposition, Chicago, June 1 to November 1,
1933. On June 15, Roderic F. Davis was made special agent under
Mr. Mitman for work in Chicago.

Honorary connections with the national collections were conferred
on several scientists of note. David I. Bushnell, Jr., long associated
with the ethnological and archeological work of the Institution, was
given an honorary appointment as collaborator in anthropology on
July 27, 1932. J. Townsend Russell, who had for several years held
an honorary position as collaborator in Old World archeology, was
made honorary assistant curator of that subject on May 13, 1933.

In the department of biology, the work of Dr. Charles Branch
Wilson, who has collaborated on Museum collections for a quarter of
a century, was recognized by his honorary appointment on June 30,
1933, as collaborator in Copepoda.

In the department of geology, the active interest for many years of
Dr. August F. Foerste was again recognized, this time by his honorary
appointment on September 29, 1932, as associate in paleontology.
Dr. Foerste served the Museum in an honorary capacity as collabo-
rator in paleontology from April 16 to December 31, 1928.

The Smithsonian was fortunately able, after her retirement from
active Government service, to take advantage of Miss Margaret W.
Moodey’s long experience in identifying, classifying, and cataloging
geological specimens by procuring her services under the income of
the Springer fund as aide for work on the Springer collection of fossil
echinoderms.

Four employees were retired during the year under the provisions
of the Civil Service retirement act. Of these Frank T. Wright,
laborer, was retired for disability on August 31, 1932. Others were
retired because of age limitation, as follows: Margaret W. Moodey,
aide in the department of geology, on December 31, 1932, after over
30 years of service; Ambrose Green, guard, on March 31, 1933, with
nearly 38 years of service; and Walter A. Barkley, guard, on January
15, 1933, after 2 years at the Museum but with other civil and military
service for the Government.

The Museum lost through death 2 active workers and 3 others long
associated with its activities. George Emmert, guard, died on Feb-
ruary 1, 1933, and John J. Veit, guard, on April 26, 1933, after services
of 14 and 15 years, respectively. The death should be recorded, also,
of Dr. Marcus Benjamin, retired, for many years editor of the
National Museum, on October 22, 1932.
DETAILED REPORTS ON THE COLLECTIONS

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY
(WatterR Houca, Head Curator)

Many things of exceptional value came to the department of
anthropology during the year, mostly by gift. Though exploration,
the source of first-grade scientific material, was curtailed, archeo-
logical work on Kodiak Island and at Point Barrow, Alaska, and
exploration of caves in Texas was continued; a reconnaissance was
made of remains of Indian irrigation projects and house structure in
southern Arizona; and cooperative archeological investigations were
pursued in Europe.

ACCESSIONS FOR THE YEAR

The division of ethnology received 48 accessions and 961 speci-
mens, compared with 60 accessions and 9381 specimens last year.
Noteworthy among them is a series of Philippine material, including
Moro and other Malay textiles collected by Gen. Tasker H. Bliss
while Governor of Moro Province, 1905-9, and presented by Mrs.
Bliss; textiles and beadwork of the Moro, Bagobo, and Igorot Tribes
collected by the late Capt. Lewis Patstone and presented by Miss
M. A. Patstone; and several embroidered garments of Pina cloth,
donated by Miss Sarah S. Metcalf. From Cambodia, Indo-China,
came a crossbow and from China and Japan large and artistic collec-
tions of lacquer, porcelains, brasses, bronzes, ivory carvings, and
many objects of minor art. Africa is represented by an inscribed gold
ring from the Gold Coast and by a miscellaneous ethnological collec-
tion from the Kivu district, Belgian Congo, presented by Miss Ellen
I. Burk. A headdress and war club from Rapa Island, Society
Group, came as the gift of Stanley W. Bird. Russia is the source of
a small collection of brasses, including an excellent samovar, teapot,
and tray, the gift of Mrs. F. Ostrach. Mexican material received
includes Guadalajara earthenware, the gift of Miss Susan P. Keech,
and horse trappings of braided horsehair.

By transfer from the Bureau of American Ethnology, a unique
collection was received from the Chama Indians of the Ucayali
River area of Peru and from several Jivaro groups of eastern Ecuador.
This material was obtained by M. W. Stirling, chief of the Beurau,
while a member of the Latin-American expedition to eastern Ecuador

and Peru, and scientifically is the outstanding collection of the year,
though intrinsically the gift of imperial Chinese porcelains, brasses,
and other objects of high art secured in Peiping by Gen. Charles A.
Coolidge in 1900, and presented by Mrs. Coolidge, is of first rank.
The Mrs. Alexius McGlannan collection of Japanese, Chinese, and
European folk and minor arts is likewise highly valuable.

The bequest to the National Museum by the late Osage chief,
Tom Baconrind, of his personal belongings and ceremonial parapher-
nalia aroused unusual interest, as Chief Baconrind was prominent in
Oklahoma and learned in the ceremonial lore of his tribe. He assisted
the late Francis La Flesche, of the Bureau of American Ethnology, in
his studies of the Osage language. The Baconrind gift includes
decorative embellishments of native Indian, peyote, and Christian
cult elements. A valuable addition to the collection of historical and
comparative religious art is the large gift from the estate of Mrs. Alice
Pike Barney.

In the division of archeology 64 new accessions, totaling 2,737
specimens, were added, as against 69 accessions and 6,712 specimens
during the previous year. The following are worthy of special
notice: 339 stone, bone, and wooden implements, basketry, and other
materials collected by Frank M. Setzler from six caves in Brewster
County, Tex.; 477 flint implements from Aurignacian, Upper Paleo-
lithic, and other early cultural horizons in two caves at the foot of
Mount Carmel, Palestine, collected by the American School of
Prehistoric Research and received as a loan from the Archaeological
Society of Washington; 789 stone, bone, and ivory implements and
ornaments collected by Dr. Ales Hrdli¢ka on Kodiak Island, Alaska;
58 specimens of stone and copper implements and pottery collected in
Ecuador by M. W. Stirling; 218 stone artifacts from Monasuka-
panough and other Indian village sites, mostly in Albemarle County,
Va., collected and presented by D. I. Bushnell, Jr.; 58 stone, shell, and
earthenware objects from five village sites in Puerto Rico, collected
by Gerrit S. Miller, Jr.; 26 earthenware vessels and stone implements
from Ometepe Island, Lake Nicaragua, presented by Corp. Emil
M. Krieger; 9 wood carvings, copper pins, and an earthenware effigy
collected at Pachacamac and other prehistoric sites in Peru and
presented by George Hewitt Myers; a quipu, or knotted string record,
and 15 fragments of textiles from Pachacamac and Trapiche ruins,
Peru, a gift from Mrs. J. P. Compton; 38 lots of potsherds, bone
projectile points, and implements from the Gran Chaco of Argentina,
from E. R. Wagner, Museo Arcaico Provincial, Santiago del Estero,
Argentina.

In the division of physical anthropology 18 accessions, 658 speci-
mens, included important skull and skeletal material from Kodiak
Island, Aleutian Islands, Point Barrow, and St. Lawrence Island,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 89

Alaska, and from California and New Mexico. A series of 262
photographs of Filipinos came from Dr. R. B. Bean.

Two accessions were received in the section of musical instruments;
7 (378 specimens) in the section of ceramics, including 80 pieces of
older glass and pottery and 143 pieces of Irish and American Belleek
ware; and 8 (141 specimens) in art textiles, including noteworthy
embroideries and laces.

INSTALLATION AND PRESERVATION OF COLLECTIONS

New exhibits were arranged for each of the major exhibition halls
assigned to ethnology. South American exhibits were enriched by a
large collection of Chama pottery from a group once believed not to
practice pottery manufacture. The collection shows them to be the
equal of the Coneba in producing a thin-walled, creamy-textured
ware. This and three additional exhibit units resulting from the
Latin-American expedition to eastern Ecuador have been installed.
Material included is from various groups of Jivaro and comprises
blowguns, looms and weaving apparatus, woven textiles, decorated
pottery, and potterymaking implements, objects of personal adorn-
ment, and various objects representing decadent stages in the art of
head-hunting. Mexican folk pottery and examples of the folk arts
of Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Guatemalan peoples were assembled
to form a new exhibit in the Mexican alcove. This includes textiles,
wood carving, model figures in wax, and objects of personal adorn-
ment. The Colombian and Panamanian exhibits were improved
through the addition of the W. W. Archer Choco collection and the
M. W. Stirling Tule and Choco material.

A case was arranged to show historical Indian sculpture from
modern Indian tribes. Masks and figurine carvings in wood collected
by Gibbs, Stuckley, and Wilkes from tribes of the Columbia Valley
and the Pacific Northwest are shown, as well as a portrait bust of
himself modeled by the Ute, Chief Shem, and the famous Haida
slate carving known as the ‘‘Bear Mother.”

During the year the division of archeology concentrated its
efforts on complete revision of the hall devoted to Old World pre-
history. An important feature is the synoptic series, portraying
diagrammatically the cultural evolution of man in relation to geo-
logical events, from Pliocene times to the period of modern civiliza-
tion, and including type artifacts, charts showing environmental
conditions, and water-color sketches suggesting characteristic human
activities and industries of the successive periods. Other major
exhibits installed deal with the following cultures: Eolithic, pre-
Chellean, Chellean, Acheulian, Micoqien, Mousterian, Aurignacian,
Magdalenian, Azilian, Final Capsian, Maglemosian, the Proto-
90 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

Neolithic of France and Italy (Campignian), of Scandinavia (Erte-
bglle), and of Central Africa and India, the Neolithic of western,
northern, and Alpine Europe, of North Africa, Indo-China, Ja
and Siberia, and the later Sumerian-Babylonian.

Five charts tracing the correlation between cultural and geo-
logical events in the Old World, 5 illustrations for the synoptic
series, 13 maps showing cultural distributions, and 6 maps depicting
the range of glacial advance and retreat were prepared and in-
corporated in the exhibits.

Study collections of the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods were
reclassified and the accompanying records corrected wherever neces-
sary to include new information. These have also been regrouped
into cultural-geographical series, so that students may examine the
material with greater ease and effectiveness. The collection from
Casa Grande, southern Arizona, secured early in the present century
by the late Jesse Walter Fewkes, was reexamined, and the exhibit
illustrating the material culture of this famous ruin was greatly
improved.

In the division of physical anthropology a temporary exhibit
of 6 cases was arranged from the newly recovered Alaska (Kodiak
Island) materials, and 3 cases of new exhibits were added to the
permanent display. A case of exhibits prepared for the National
Academy of Sciences meeting in April remained for 2 weeks on view
in the academy. Two cases of exhibits were prepared for the meet-
ing of the American Surgical Association.

INVESTIGATION AND RESEARCH

In ethnology, Henry B. Collins, Jr., continued the study of Eskimo
archeology, particularly on materials collected by himself, J. A.
Ford, and M. B. Chambers. For several years the Smithsonian
Institution has conducted archeological studies along the west
Alaskan coast, to obtain data on the chronological sequence of
certain early phases of Eskimo culture. During this year and
last the scene has been shifted to the north Alaska coast in the
vicinity of Pomt Barrow. Here the problem involved concerns the
historical sequence of Punuk and Thule phases of Eskimo culture.
James A. Ford spent the winter of 1931-32 at Point Barrow on the
Arctic coast and devoted the following summer to excavating at
several old Eskimo sites in the region. Point Barrow has for some
time been recognized as one of the most important places archeo-
logically in Alaska, since it was the westernmost limit of the extinct
Thule culture, which centered in northern Canada, and also the most
eastward point to which the Old Bering Sea culture extended. Mr.
Ford’s excavations were the first of a systematic nature to be car-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 91

ried on at this strategic point, and the material obtained throws
light on the relationships between the Thule, Punuk, and Old Bering
Sea cultures. Mr. Collins also devoted some time to research on
southeastern archeology, and participated in the conference on
southern prehistory held by the National Research Council at
Birmingham, Ala., in December.

Phases of Arawakan occupation of the Greater Antilles have
become known through five seasons of active field work by Smith-
sonian expeditions sponsored by Dr. W. L. Abbott in the Dominican
Republic, Haiti, and Cuba. Problems involved concern the inter-
relationships among Ciboney, Arawak, Carib, and perhaps other
tribal cultures in central and western Cuba. H. W. Krieger during
the year studied material assembled on these expeditions and belong-
ing to these tribal cultures. The greater problem of northern and
southern affiliation of the prehistoric Antillean cultures is much
nearer a solution, but much work remains to be done in Venezuela,
Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and perhaps Florida. The 1932 season’s
work, during which Mr. Krieger investigated mounds, earthworks,
and kitchenmiddens in central and western Cuba, has confirmed
the belief of students that Mayan influence did not reach western
Cuba. It was also found that pre-Arawak cultures of the Ciboney
type are much more extensive than had previously been known.
The principal evidence for this is the large number of village sites
yielding no pottery.

Art design areas of North America and of Oceania and certain
problems connected with the distribution of aboriginal application
of design were other topics of research by Mr. Krieger. The quilled
and painted designs on the George Catlin collection of Indian cos-
tumes from unidentified northern Plains tribes, and the costumes
displayed in the Indian portraits by George Catlin, also received
his attention. The culture of the historic tidewater Indians of
Virginia, Maryland, and the Carolinas continues of major interest.
The strictly prehistoric cultures and the physical anthropology of
this area are receiving the attention, respectively, of Frank M.
Setzler and Dr. T. Dale Stewart.

The curator of archeology, Neil M. Judd, continued work on his
report on the Pueblo Bonito explorations of the National Geographic
Society. Assistant Curator Setzler studied archeological material
he had previously collected in the Big Bend region of Texas and
published a description of certain fragmentary vessels from east-
central Louisiana collected in 1926 by the late Gerard Fowke. The
importance of these fragments lies in their definite resemblance to
a type of pottery generally designated by archeologists as ‘‘ Hopewell”’
and heretofore reported only from the northern Mississippi Valley.
92 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

Research by the curator of physical anthropology, Dr. Ales
Hrdliéka, was concentrated on his field work in Alaska and on study
of the skeletal materials brought back. He also finished an extensive
work on ‘‘The Anthropology of the Pueblos”, measured the col-
lection of Chinese skeletons, and prepared for publication a mono-
graph on ‘‘Ear Exostoses: Contribution to Racial Pathology.”
The assistant curator, Dr. T. D. Stewart, measured the tympanic
plate and external auditory meatus in the Eskimo, California Indians,
and related groups; tested the skull-capacity machine and studied
the skull-capacity problem in general; studied the vertebral column
in the Eskimo; and continued research on the hair directions of
primates.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE OF SPECIMENS

Four gifts made to other institutions included 72 specimens.
One lot consisted of prehistoric Eskimo objects collected in dupli-
cate by Dr. Hrdlitka and Mr. Collins. Two small gifts represent-
ing the history of the Japanese Red Cross Society were made to
the National Red Cross Museum of Washington, D.C., and a large
collection was sent to the City Museum of Talladega, Ala. Sixteen
specimens were transferred to the divisions of textiles and archeology.

During the year eight lots of archeological material (612 speci-
mens) were sent out in exchange or as gifts to educational institu-
tions, as follows: 104 specimens (gift) for scientific purposes to
Rev. David C. Graham, Suifu, Szechwan, China; 167 specimens
(gift) to the City Museum of Talladega, Ala.; 1 cast of a slate tube
to Dr. Charles Back, Montezuma, Ind., in exchange for permission
to make and retain a cast of the original; 4 lots of potsherds (gift)
to the Antelope Valley Museum, Lancaster, Calif.; 3 casts of Easter
Island wooden tablets as a gift to the Musée d’Ethnographie, Palais
du Trocadero, Paris; 4 casts (2 sendings) to W. J. Curtis, Piqua, Ky.,
in exchange for permission to make similar replicas; 329 Old World
archeological specimens (gift) to the Hastings College Museum, Hast-
ings, Nebr.

NUMBER OF SPECIMENS UNDER DEPARTMENT

During the year the department received 131 accessions, a total
of 4,877 specimens. Of these, 4 accessions comprising 510 specimens
were loans. The material was distributed as follows: Ethnology,
48 accessions (961 specimens); archeology, 64 accessions (2,737
specimens); physical anthropology, 18 accessions (658 specimens);
musical instruments, 2 accessions (2 specimens); ceramics, 7 ac-
cessions (378 specimens); and art textiles, 8 accessions (141 specimens).

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY
(LEONHARD STEJNEGER, Head Curator)

The past year promises to open a new era in the development
of the divisions which deal with marine fauna, especially of the
deeper waters of the ocean. Thanks to Eldridge R. Johnson’s
initiative and offer of the use of his yacht Caroline, together with
generous funds for its equipment for oceanographic work, the first
Johnson-Smithsonian Deep-Sea Expedition, under the direction of
Dr. Paul Bartsch, curator of mollusks, made a successful cruise of
exploration of the Puerto Rican Deep, which resulted in greatly
enriching the Museum collections, in addition to giving observations
bearing on biological, chemical, and physical problems of the ocean.

Capt. G. Allan Hancock generously offered the Museum participa-
tion in the Hancock Galapagos expedition on the yacht Velero III
during a 3-months’ oceanographic cruise to the Galapagos Islands
and the western coast of Central America. Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt,
curator of marine invertebrates, was detailed for this service and
returned with much valuable material, chiefly crustacean, for the
Museum collections.

ACCESSIONS FOR THE YEAR

There were 1,200 accessions for the year with a total of 295,782
specimens, more than double the number received during the previ-
ous year. Through the two expeditions alluded to, the scientific
importance of the invertebrate material is probably greater than
that of the vertebrate, though the high scientific value of some of
the fish collections should be emphasized, as well as the acquisition
of material of various classes from French Indo-China, important
on account of the locality being hitherto poorly represented in the
Museum. Dr. Hugh M. Smith’s collections of Siamese mammals,
birds, and mollusks maintain their standing as first-class contribu-
tions, and the first collections from Dr. D. C. Graham after his
return to his old field in China are coming up to the expectations
raised by previous experience. Many of the plant collections ac-
cessioned during the year are scientifically of a high order.

Mammals.—The outstanding accession was the skull, with six
blades of baleen, of the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), col-
lected by J. A. Ford at Point Barrow, Alaska. This is the first
skull of its kind to come to any museum from the Pacific side of

94
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 95

the Arctic Ocean, and the only bowhead in any American museum,
while in European museums the species is represented by less than
half a dozen specimens. From Dr. Hugh M. Smith in Siam 151
mammals, supplementing the large collections of previous years,
were received. By exchange with H. J. V. Sody, Buitenzorg, Java,
59 mammal skins with skulls from Java and Celebes, were obtained,
mostly forms new to the Museum. W. G. Sheldon and Richard
Borden presented 63 specimens collected in British Columbia. Dr.
R. K. Enders collected in Panama 51 mammals for the Museum,
two species being new to the region. Noteworthy among the many
specimens obtained from the National Zoological Park by transfer
were a young mountain gorilla, Cacajao calvus, Hylobates agilis, and
a young fur seal born at the park. Two gibbons (/7ylobates hoolock),
a species new to the Museum, were obtained in exchange, and a skele-
ton of a dugong, from Australia, by purchase.

Birds.—The 456 birdskins and 2 skeletons from Siam sent by Dr.
Hugh M. Smith take first place. James Ford collected 169 bird-
skins in Alaska, and Dr. A. Wetmore 95 skins and 388 skeletons in
the southwestern United States, besides about 100 local birds. A
number of species and genera new to the Museum were obtained by
exchange, including an Hawaiian honey creeper (Paroreomyza
flammea), 10 forms of hummingbirds, and 13 of other birds. A
skin and skeleton of the rare Hawaiian goose (Nesochen sandvicensis)
were presented by the Commissioners of Agriculture and Forestry
at Honolulu, and the first known nestling wandering tattlers (//etero-
scelus incanus), collected by Joseph S. Dixon, came from the National
Park Service. Among transfers of specimens from the National
Zoological Park was an egg of the California condor. Eggs of
148 forms hitherto not represented in the Museum were obtained
in exchange. Percy Shufeldt placed a valuable collection of 2,316
birdskins on deposit in the division.

Reptiles and amphibians.—The largest additions of the year came
from Dr. C. E. Burt, the most important being collected for the
Museum during a trip to the upper reaches of the Tennessee and
Cumberland Rivers, when he obtained 1,491 specimens. He also
donated 1,325 specimens from the West. An important collection
from Puerto Rico containing topotype material of some recently
described frogs was the result of G. S. Miller’s visit to that island
early in 1932. Three small herpetological collections obtained from
French Indo-China are highly important as the locality was not
represented in the Museum collections previously, except for a few
specimens recently received. From the National Zoological Park
the division received by transfer an unusually interesting lot of
animals, among which is a series of the pipa, or Surinam toad. A
splendidly preserved series of Californian Batrachoseps is of great
96 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

value for the study of that difficult group of salamanders. A good
collection of reptiles and amphibians from Kansas was contributed
by H. K. Gloyd.

Fishes —Of special importance was the fine collection of fishes
obtained by the Johnson-Smithsonian Deep-Sea Expedition off Puerto
Rico, containing many remarkable deep-sea forms, among them a
new genus and species of Triacanthidae, the second one of the family
to be recorded from the New World. Another collection of great
interest is a lot of 67 specimens presented by Dr. George S. Myers,
assistant curator of fishes, consisting mostly of type specimens of
West African and South American fresh-water fishes described by
the donor and others. Holotypes of 2 species, cotypes of 8, and
paratypes of 13 are included. Altogether this accession brings to the
Museum 26 species, 13 genera, and 1 family hitherto not represented
in its collections. From the United States Bureau of Fisheries a fine
series of 1,177 fishes from the Catawba and Tuckasegee Rivers,
N.C., including the type of a new darter, and another lot consisting
of 3 type specimens from the Gulf of Mexico, were received by
transfer. C. R. Aschemeier obtained 1,959 fresh-water fishes in
Florida, partly collected for the Museum, partly as a gift. The
British Museum presented two paratypes of Notobranchius kiyawensis.
Two paratypes of a new smelt were a gift from Dr. L. P. Schultz, of
the University of Washington. A specimen of Gempylus serpens, a
species new to the Museum, was presented by Eastham Guild,
Papeete, Tahiti. From Dr. D. C. Graham came a collection of
fishes from Szechwan, China.

Insects.—The outstanding accession of the year was the Edward
T. Owen collection of Lepidoptera, comprising about 40,000 beauti-
fully preserved specimens and including many species new to the
Museum. The collection represents the life work of Professor Owen
and was received from the executor of his estate. Frank Johnson, of
New York City, made several gifts of rare species of Lepidoptera of
great value, numbering in all 1,030 specimens, of species not previ-
ously in the Museum or poorly represented. Two important dona-
tions of Microlepidoptera, including about 600 specimens each, were
obtained from the British Museum and Edward Meyrick. M. W.
Stirling, Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology, brought back
from his South American trip 350 Lepidoptera from Peru. The
collection of the late Prof. P. R. Lowry, Durham, N.H., comprising
908 slides of insects, mostly plant lice, was donated by his widow.
By exchange with O. Ringdahl, Haelsingborg, Sweden, 273 named
Diptera of the family Anthomyiidae, in which he is a distinguished
specialist, were obtained, an accession furnishing a large representation
of the northern European fauna. Two lots of miscellaneous insects,
comprising about 3,800 specimens, came from Indo-China, an im-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 97

portant addition as the Museum has little material from that region.
L. D. Christenson, Wellsville, Utah, donated a collection of 4,550
Cuban insects, and D. S. Bullock of Angol, Chile, continued his
liberal contributions. About 15,000 insects were transferred to the
Museum by the United States Bureau of Entomology, being mis-
cellaneous material received for identification from field workers.
Marine invertebrates —The total number of specimens received was
15,160, of which the following accessions were of special interest:
From the estate of the late Dr. Charles Dwight Marsh, his important
collection of 3,307 slide mounts of copepods was acquired, including
representative material of 26 new species. Capt. Robert A. Bartlett,
New York City, presented a large collection of miscellaneous marine
invertebrates taken in northwest Greenland waters. Dr. Waldo L.
Schmitt collected series of specimens at the Tortugas, Fla., and also
a large collection of Crustacea from the Galapagos Islands, during the
cruise of the Velero III, of which mention has already been made.
The collections brought home by the Johnson-Smithsonian Deep-Sea
Expedition, under direction of Dr. Paul Bartsch, were highly impor-
tant. Dr. R. E. Coker, University of North Carolina, presented
alcoholic specimens of copepods, comprising holotypes, paratypes,
and other important material representative of species to be de-
scribed by him. P. Hummelinck, of Utrecht, Holland, contributed
85 crustaceans, including types, from the Dutch islands off the coast
of Venezuela. The deposition of type specimens of new species
included the type of a new sponge, by Dr. James T. Penney, University
of South Carolina; the type of new species of crab, described by Dr.
Mary J. Rathbun, donated by the Museu Paulista, Sao Paulo, Brazil;
and the type and 3 paratypes of a new species of parasitic copepod by
Wilbur M. Tidd, Ohio State University. An important collection of
60 microscopic slide mounts and 49 alcoholic specimens of isopods
was obtained from Dr. K. W. Verhoeff, Pasing, Bavaria.
Mollusks.—One of the most important accessions of the year is
that of 5,550 mollusks taken principally from the Puerto Rican Deep,
during the Johnson-Smithsonian Deep-Sea Expedition. Four acces-
sions, 100,500 specimens, are credited to the Frances Lea Chamber-
lain fund, including material from the Maynard collection of Cerions.
Dr. Hugh M. Smith contributed 575 specimens of mollusks from
Siam; Brother Daniel, Colegio de San José, Medellin, Colombia, 66
specimens of land, fresh-water, and marine shells; and Walter F,
Webb, Rochester, N.Y., 161 specimens from the United States and
Australia. A donation from Mrs. Isabel B. Hendry, Rosslyn, Va.,
contains about 3,100 specimens of land, fresh-water, and marine
shells, and 1 from Miss Florence S. Gilson, Nyack, N.Y., 1,400
specimens, mostly marine mollusks. From Dr. C. G. Aguayo,
Habana, Cuba, were received 67 specimens of land shells from that
98 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

island, and from the zoological section of the University of Stellen-
bosch, South Africa, 140 specimens. The type and paratype of a
new fresh-water mussel from Florida were presented by Berlin Hart
Wright, Penn Yan, N.Y.; 16 paratypes from Santo Domingo by
Dr. H. A. Pilsbry, Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and
3 cotypes from the Philippine Islands by Dr. Fred Baker, Point Loma,
Calif.

Corals —More than 200 specimens were received, nearly all from
the Johnson-Smithsonian Deep-Sea Expedition.

Helminths —The total number of helminths accessioned is 1,068.

Echinoderms.—The most important of the 10 accessions received
during the year is that from the Johnson-Smithsonian Deep-Sea
Expedition, including a large number of specimens of species from
moderately deep water in the Caribbean region that have not been
collected since the explorations of the Blake in 1877-80, the Albatross
in 1884-87, and the Fish Hawk in 1899.

Plants.—Accessions for the year comprised 56,125 specimens, most
important of which are as follows: 24,124 specimens were transferred
by the United States Department of Agriculture, mostly from the
Bureau of Plant Industry, 4,062 being grasses and 15,308 Argentine
specimens collected by Venturi. About 3,600 duplicate specimens
of the historic Mutis Herbarium, received as an exchange with the
Botanical Garden at Madrid, Spain, through the efforts of E. P.
Killip, will be of great importance in the study of South American
plants. A considerable number of South American plants were
obtained from the British Museum (Natural History). Several other
tropical American collections were received in exchange, among them
765 specimens of the Ecklon-Zeyler expedition from the Natural
History Museum at Vienna, Austria; 530 plants from the Royal
Botanic Gardens, Kew, England; 984 plants from the Botanical
Museum at Copenhagen, Denmark; 1,141 specimens from the Natural
History Riksmuseum in Stockholm, Sweden; 1,257 specimens, mainly
from Peru, from the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago;
1,709 specimens from British Honduras, Guatemala, and Sumatra
from the University of Michigan. Similarly, 1,619 Chinese plants
were received from Lingnan University, Canton, and 500 from the
University of Nanking, China; 744 plants collected in the Hawaiian,
Fiji, and Society Islands from the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in
Honolulu; and 886 mainly Chinese, West African, and Cuban plants
from the Arnold Arboretum, Harvard University. C. V. Morton
collected 1,897 plants for the Museum at Oaxaca, Mexico, with the
assistance of Dr. Emil Makrinius. The University of Vermont gave
the National Herbarium 306 specimens collected in Mexico by C. G.
Pringle, the lot consisting of numbers not previously represented in
the collections. Among the numerous gifts by institutions and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 99

individuals were 464 specimens from the Death Valley region, Calif.,
by the National Geographic Society; 470 specimens from Nicaragua,
by the Instituto Pedagégico de Varones, Managua; 449 specimens
from the Santa Marta region, Colombia, by Dr. William Seifriz,
University of Pennsylvania; 279 specimens from eastern Peru, by
Guillermo Klug, Iquitos; 244 specimens from Colombia, by Baltazar
Guevara Amortegui; 341 specimens from Panama, by Brother Paul,
Colegio de la Salle; and 576 specimens from the State of Washington,
by J. William Thompson, Seattle.

INSTALLATION AND PRESERVATION OF COLLECTIONS

The main work of the taxidermists was the mounting of a hippo-
potamus and the construction of a biological group of the Haitian
ground iguana. The District of Columbia faunal exhibit continued
under the care of Dr. Bartsch, who kept it current and made additions,
notably a mounted specimen of the Louisiana heron.

Additional half-unit cases were supplied in the division of mammals
for the rearrangement of the primate skins, all of which are now
grouped together. Considerable work was done in rearranging smaller
mammal skins, especially rodents and carnivores. The skeleton
collection also was rearranged. The carnivore and larger rodent
skulls of the Merriam collection, which has hitherto been kept intact
as a separate unit, were intercalated in the general collection. Twelve
large and medium-sized mammal skins were tanned on outside
contract, and 13 skins were tanned by taxidermists of the Museum,
who also degreased and made up 79 skins, skinned or prepared for
skeletons 26 mammals, and removed 15 sets of gibbon leg bones.
Fifty-five skeletons, mostly large, 145 skulls, and 14 sets of leg bones
were cleaned. Contract work on small and medium-sized skulls and
skeletons resulted in cleaning 695 skulls and 130 skeletons.

About two thirds of the birdskins received during the year were
distributed in the study series. Of collections previously held up as
separate units awaiting identification and study, the nonpasserine
birds of the Roosevelt and Aschemeier African collections were identi-
fied and distributed. About one fourth of the large Siamese collec-
tions was worked up and distributed, as well as the rest of the
Museum’s Chinese birds. The skeletal material collected by H. B.
Collins, Jr., on St. Lawrence Island was also identified. The work of
expanding and rearranging the crowded parts of the study series
included many groups of birds. The collection of alcoholic specimens
was completely overhauled and all unidentified material culled out.
The work of the preparators included skinning 108 birds, degreasing
and remaking 158 skins, mounting two birds for the District collec-
tion, cleaning 292 skeletons, skeletonizing 220 birds, and blowing
40 eggs.

72774—35—8
100 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

In the division of reptiles and batrachians, 6,310 newly identified
specimens were incorporated in the collection. Dry preparations
were added to the turtle collection as follows: 6 skeletons, 121 skulls,
59 shells; 71 study skins were also prepared, and a number of other
reptile skins and skeletons made.

The division of fishes, during the vacancy caused by B. A. Bean’s
retirement on June 30, 1932, was ably cared for by E. D. Reid, under
the immediate supervision of the head curator, until Dr. G. S. Myers,
the new assistant curator, took charge. The large collection, mostly
of Albatross fishes, for many years at Stanford University for study
by the late David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert, was
packed and forwarded to Washington by Dr. Myers.

Dr. J. M. Aldrich, curator of insects, whose work was confined to
Diptera, considerably improved the arrangement of several families.
Dr. Alan Stone transferred all the mosquito collection to standard
museum insect drawers and metal-covered cases and further rear-
ranged the family Tabanidae. In the Coleoptera, H. A. Barber
rearranged and expanded special groups and made a preliminary
rearrangement of Philippine hispids. Dr. M. W. Blackman rear-
ranged the Museum collection of 22 genera of the family Scolytidae.
Dr. A. G. Béving continued to supervise the coleopterous larval
collection. Nearly 3,000 jars of this material have been prepared
and filled in the past 2 years. L. L. Buchanan studied and rearranged
specimens of Hylobius and Lepidophorus, of the carabid genus
Monoferonia, of the long series of granary weevils of the genus
Sitophilus, and of the coffee-bean weevil. In addition he selected
a synoptic series of the species of the genus Calendra and identified
and arranged more than 3,000 North American specimens of the
weevil genus Apion. Dr. EK. A. Chapin made progress in arrange-
ment of the scarabaeid beetles of the subfamilies Melolonthinae,
Dynastinae, and Cetoniinae. W.S. Fisher completed rearrangement
of the Mexican, Central American, and South American species of
Cerambycidae and rearranged and to some extent classified the
Oriental Cerambycidae.

In Lepidoptera the specialists proceeded with the incorporation of
the great Owen collection into the general Museum series. Foster
H. Benjamin consolidated all the North American Noctuidae of the
subfamily Catocalinae, which now occupies 67 large drawers and 36
standard museum drawers. A similar rearrangement for the North
American Noctuidae of the subfamily Agrotinae was partially com-
pleted. August Busck completed the incorporation of the Micro-
lepidoptera from the Barnes collection into the general Museum series.
Carl Heinrich added the Barnes collection material of the subfamilies
Calleriinae and Macrothecinae to the general collection. Dr. William
Schaus was active in expanding and rearranging the exotic Macro-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 101

lepidoptera in order to care for the additional specimens that have
become available during the year. He also completed a new arrange-
ment of the family Epiplemidae and did much work on the Owen
collection.

In Hymenoptera R. A. Cushman expanded and rearranged some
of the groups and subfamilies in the Ichneumonidae. A. B. Gahan
undertook some rearrangement due to the addition of material.
C. F. W. Muesebeck arranged the Braconidae of the subfamily
Aphidiinae and the exotic specimens of the subfamily Microgasterinae.
Miss Grace A. Sandhouse completely rearranged the collections of
aculeates. In addition, the aculeate Hymenoptera of the old Fitch
collection were worked over and incorporated into the rerular Museum
collections. The North American material of the genus Pemphredon
was identified and arranged; and the neotropical species of Try-
poxylon were incorporated in the collection. Many undetermined
Psammocharidae were sorted and grouped into genera, and the
North American specimens of the genus Pepsis were identified and
arranged.

In orthopteroids and neuropteroids, A. N. Caudell continued
arrangement of the regular Museum material and made some progress
in working up the Baker Philippine material. Dr. H. E. Ewing
undertook to arrange the spider collection and sorted out and properly
segregated various mixed lots of material in the groups assigned to
him. In Hemiptera, H. G. Barber rearranged the entire Heteroptera
collection. He now has the true bugs in a satisfactory natural order
so that material is readily accessible. P. W. Oman rearranged
Museum material in the Homoptera, involving various United States
and Canadian Fulgoridae, and supervised the transfer of the extensive
North American Psyllidae collection to trays and partly rearranged
this material. He also arranged the South American species of leaf-
hoppers of the genus Agallia and its relatives, as well as a large part
of the West Indian and Central American Cicadellidae.

The alcoholic collection in the division of marine invertebrates is
in excellent shape, owing chiefly to the efficient services of the laborer
recently assigned to the division. Temporary clerical assistance
made it possible to bring the cataloging of identified specimens about
up to date. Work on the study collection of the division of mollusks
has progressed steadily but slowly. Members of the zoological
division staff of the United States Bureau of Animal Industry gave
the helminthological collection its periodical overhauling. The usual
curatorial work was done in the collection of echinoderms.

About 25,000 mounted phanerogams were added to the main
herbarium, mostly recent South American material; 33,883 mounted
specimens were stamped and recorded, preparatory to incorporation
in the collection. The segregation of type specimens of American
102 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

phanerogams was continued by E. P. Killip and E. H. Walker, 18,768
types of new species and varieties having now been labeled, cataloged,
and placed in heavy individual covers. Also 4,225 photographs of
type specimens of American plants in other herbaria (chiefly Euro-
pean) were mounted separately on herbarium sheets for distribution
into the herbarium. As in previous years, E. C. Leonard, in addition
to his ordinary duties, regularly devoted some time to the moss collec-
tion, and recently began similar curatorial work on the Hepaticae,
of which a large number await incorporation in the herbarium.

The C. G. Lloyd mycological collection has been maintained in
accordance with the terms of agreement under which it was deposited.
There is great need of a comprehensive index of Mr. Lloyd’s mycologi-
cal writings, which consist to a great extent of scattered notes, the
indexes to the separate volumes into which his writings were collected
being neither complete nor uniform in style. Manuscript of a
detailed index to the seven volumes was therefore prepared during
the year and will be issued shortly by the Lloyd Library at Cincinnati.
As a further step in clarifying and rounding out Mr. Lloyd’s myco-
logical work, a complete list of his new fungus species and new com-
binations, totaling about 1,500, is being made. This will include for
each species (1) citation of place of publication; (2) other references
in the literature by Lloyd and other mycologists, with comment;
(3) citation of type and other specimens, with accompanying data.
This work, to be ready shortly, will also be published by the Lloyd
Library.

During the year 22,290 specimens were mounted by adhesive
straps, all but 6,100 of these by contract; 3,412 specimens were
glued (by contract); and 28,428 fully prepared specimens were
turned out, all of which were stamped and recorded and are now
ready for incorporation in the herbarium. Of material intended for
the herbarium, there are on hand more than 20,000 specimens that
are wholly unmounted; also 2,500 that have been glued but not
stamped.

RESEARCH BY MEMBERS OF THE STAFF

The research of G. S. Miller, Jr., curator of mammals, was on the
primates. The large collection of gibbons (mostly brought together
by Dr. W. L. Abbott) was reexamined and reidentified in the light
of recent studies by Pocock and Kloss; and a special study of the
remarkable color variation was made. A short note on the classi-
fication of the gibbons was published. The opportunity to examine
a fresh gorilla’s foot, afforded by the death of a young mountain
gorilla in the Zoological Park, furnished the stimulus to a new study
of the problem of the origin of the human foot (whether or not from
a mechanical type like that found in the great apes). Dr. Remington
Kellogg reexamined and identified the hair seals in the Museum col-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 103

lection; prepared for publication three reports on cetaceans in the
Los Angeles Museum of History, Science and Art, the Condon
Museum of the University of Oregon, and the Field Museum of
Natural History; and cooperated with specialists in other groups in
the preparation of a tentative draft of the zones comprising the
California Tertiary.

The curator of birds, Dr. Herbert Friedmann, completed work on
the birds collected by the Smithsonian African expedition under
Theodore Roosevelt, and also the report on the birds collected in
Gaboon by the Garner expedition. He also reported on a large col-
lection of bird bones from St. Lawrence Island, and on three smaller
lots from the mainland of Alaska and from Kodiak Island; and began
work on the remaining parts of Ridgway’s unfinished work ‘The
Birds of North and Middle America” and nearly completed the
compilation of literature for all the groups remaining to be published
on. He also wrote papers relating to the nictitating membrane of
the domestic pigeon, to parasitic cowbirds and cuckoos, to early
observations on North American birds, to racial variations in certain
African shrikes, to the display of Wallace’s bird of paradise, and other
subjects. The associate curator, J. H. Riley, studied and identified
the large collections of Siamese birds sent in by Dr. H. M. Smith
and published descriptions and notes on some of the novelties and
more interesting forms. A. C. Bent, collaborator, completed the
manuscript of the tenth volume of his ‘‘ Life Histories of North Ameri-
can Birds”, on part of the falconiform birds. Dr. Wetmore pub-
lished on the birds collected by the Parish-Smithsonian expedition
in Cuba and Haiti; described several new forms of fossil birds from
North America; continued his editorial work on Swann’s ‘ Mono-
graph of the Accipitres”’, part of which was issued during the year;
and wrote various other articles.

The curator of reptiles and batrachians, Dr. L. Stejneger, worked
on a revision of the Testudinata of North and Middle America;
finished a report on some collections from the Galapagos Islands and
Polynesia; and in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Barbour, of the
Museum of Comparative Zoology, brought out the third edition of
their ‘Check List of North American Amphibians and Reptiles.”
Dr. Doris M. Cochran, assistant curator, completed a report on the
herpetology of Hispaniola and published several descriptive papers
on new species.

Dr. G. S. Myers, assistant curator of fishes, nearly completed a
revision of the genera of oviparous cyprinodonts, a group of small
fishes of great value in the destruction of malarial and yellow-fever
mosquitoes in the Tropics. He also began work on the deep-sea
fishes obtained by the Johnson-Smithsonian Deep-Sea Expedition and
on the fishes from western China collected by Dr. D. C. Graham.
104. ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

Dr. J. M. Aldrich, curator of insects, prepared a paper on the
dipterous family Tachinidae of the Patagonian region, based on our
material and that of the British Museum; published several short
papers describing new species from various parts of the world and
including notes on synonymy and nomenclature; made a catalog of
the muscoid flies of the Old World except Europe; and studied the
species of botflies of the genus Cuterebra, in collaboration with
Maj. E. E. Austen, of the British Museum. C. T. Greene worked
on a revision of the genus Anastrepha of the family Trypetidae, of
definite importance because of the discovery of members of the genus
in the southernmost parts of the United States, including Florida
and the Brownsville area in Texas. Foster H. Benjamin completed
a manuscript discussing the classification and biology of the native
Trypetidae of Florida, based on extensive collections made during
the effort of the Department of Agriculture to exterminate the
Mediterranean fruit fly. Dr. Alan Stone undertook a critical revi-
sionary study of the genus Tabanus. Dr. A. G. Boving prepared
numerous notes on and illustrations of beetle larvae, including two
Puerto Rican species of Phyllophaga, the coccinellid beetle Ortalistes
rubidus, and the larvae of Rhinomacer pilosus, Tetrigus fleutiauri,
and Nicobium castaneum. One paper, describing the larva of the
coccinellid beetle Decadiomus pictus, was published. L. L. Buchanan
began a critical revisional study of the weevil genus Conotrachelus.
Dr. E. A. Chapin prepared a key to the species of Chlaenobia present
in the Museum collections, and continued his revisional work on
various groups of West Indian Scarabaeidae, especially on those of
Puerto Rico. W.S. Fisher completed a study on the genus Hzocentrus
from Java, prepared descriptions for a number of new species of
Mexican Buprestidae, and made minor studies in various small
groups to facilitate identification.

In the section of Lepidoptera, Dr. W. Schaus continued study of
the Puerto Rican Macrolepidoptera, in the course of which he pre-
pared descriptions for many new species. Foster H. Benjamin
worked on various North American lepidopterous groups, and pre-
pared a number of short papers. August Busck continued work on
the family Tortricidae and took up the genus Aristotelia, which con-
tains a number of species of economic importance. Carl Heinrich
continued study of American Phycitinae. R.A. Cushman undertook
a revision of the genus Polyaenus, did some work on the tribes
Lissonotini and Glyptini, and published one paper on the identity
of several Oriental parasitic ichneumonids of economic importance.
A. B. Gahan devoted much time to a paper on the parasites of the
Hessian fly. C. F. W. Muesebeck worked on a revision of the
braconid subfamily Euphorinae and progressed in work on the sub-
family Exothecinae and the genus Rogas. Miss Grace A. Sandhouse
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 105

continued studies on the North American Halictinae, particularly on
certain subgenera of the genus /Y/alictus, during which she made
many dissections and from these permanent preparations for the
collection. She completed work on the North American Augochlora
and worked out a synoptic key to the North American Pemphredon.
William Middleton worked on sawflies and prepared descriptions of
some new species.

A. N. Caudell published a report on the Orthoptera of the Pinchot
expedition; carried on some investigational work on neuropteroids,
in the course of which he prepared a description for one new species;
and studied specimens of Decticinae from California. He finished
and submitted for publication an alphabetical index to the orthop-
terous insects of North America published subsequent to the year
1900 to and including 1925.

Dr. H. E. Ewing made taxonomic studies on both mites and suck-
ing-lice during the year, during which he completed for publication
four papers on the classification of various genera or groups.

In Hemiptera H. G. Barber carried on investigations in a variety
of groups, including Nearctic and Neotropical Phymatidae, Neo-
tropical Coreidae, Notonectidae and Belostomatidae (with the assist-
ance of Prof. H. B. Hungerford), and Halobatinae, in connection
with the Carnegie Plankton expedition, and made considerable prog-
ress with the study of the races of the chinch bug (lissus leucopterus
Say). P. W. Oman undertook preliminary studies in a number of
genera in both the Cicadellidae and the Fulgoridae. His most
important contribution during the year was an extensive paper on
classification of the North American agallian leafhoppers. Dr. P. W.
Mason continued his study of the aphid tribe Macrosiphina.

In the division of marine invertebrates, Dr. Mary J. Rathbun,
associate in zoology, was actively engaged in the preparation of the
fourth of her series of comprehensive monographs on American crabs.
In addition she determined nearly all the current sendings of recent
Brachyura and fossil Crustacea and submitted for publication a paper
describing seven new species from the Gulf of California. Dr. Waldo
L. Schmitt, curator, published a review of the distribution of the
larger fresh-water shrimps of the United States, and also prepared for
publication the new species in his report on the macruran and ano-
muran Crustacea of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and an account
of two new species of pycnogonids. A revision of the genus Hmerita
was likewise submitted for publication. The assistant curator,
C. R. Shoemaker, completed several studies on amphipods; others he
has in progress, with a view to bringing taxonomic knowledge of these
long neglected Crustacea up to date for the east coast of North
America. ‘The report being prepared by J. O. Maloney, aide, on the
isopods collected in the course of the various expeditions that Capt.
106 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

R. A. Bartlett has made to Greenland in the past several years is
rapidly approaching completion, while his descriptions of two new
species of isopod crustaceans from California appeared in print during
the year. Dr. J. A. Cushman, honorary collaborator, made progress
on further parts of his monographs of the tropical Pacific foraminifera.
In addition to handling a large volume of paleontological material,
he identified various lots of recent foraminifera. Dr. W. H. Longley,
collaborator, spent nearly 4 months abroad, chiefly in London, Paris,
and Berlin, in part in connection with his studies on evolution.

Most of the time of the curator of mollusks, Dr. Paul Bartsch,
was required in planning, equipping, and directing the Johnson-
Smithsonian Deep-Sea Expedition and in caring for the material
obtained. The identification of material sent in for report occupied
the time of the rest of the staff not otherwise taken up by curatorial
duties.

The curator of echinoderms, Austin H. Clark, continued work on
parts 4 and 5 of his monograph of the existing crinoids, with a view
to their completion in the near future, and studied and indentified
a part of the material collected by the Johnson-Smithsonian Deep-Sea
Expedition.

In the division of plants Dr. W. R. Maxon, associate curator,
carried on studies of tropical American ferns; E. P. Killip, associate
curator, continued work on a monograph of the American species of
Passifloraceae, besides studies of certain genera of Urticaceae and
Boraginaceae; E. C. Leonard, assistant curator, studied West Indian
flora; C. V. Morton, aide, investigated several tropical American
families of phanerogams, especially the Solanaceae; and E. H. Walker,
aide, practically finished a revision of Chinese Myrsinaceae, besides
carrying on bibliographic work. Here may be mentioned also the
study by Mr. Killip of a series of about 3,600 duplicate specimens of
the historic Mutis Herbarium received from the Jardin Botanico,
Madrid, through his active interest. The Mutis collection, made in
Colombia between 1760 and 1808, contains specimens upon which
many early species were proposed. In return for the valuable dupli-
cates sent to this Institution, Mr. Killip has undertaken to identify
the specimens, and to date has reported upon about 2,000 of the
3,600 received.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE OF SPECIMENS

Duplicate specimens distributed to museums, high schools, colleges,
and similar institutions aggregated 1,351 specimens, and 43,578
exchanges were sent out, of which 1,073 were zoological specimens.
The 42,505 plants distributed went to 104 institutions and corre-
spondents, of which 46 were in the United States, and 58 in 22 countries
abroad.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 107

NUMBER OF SPECIMENS UNDER DEPARTMENT

The number of specimens under the department of biology, so far
as has been ascertained by count and estimate, is now more than
10,800,000. The actual number is probably much greater, since
several collections, as the corals, have not been included, nor does the
number of plants given below include duplicates and unmounted
material of the lower cryptogams. In several of the divisions, such
as those of marine invertebrates and mollusks, lots consisting of
minute organisms are frequently counted as single specimens though
they may contain hundreds or even thousands of individuals, the
enumeration of which would serve no useful purpose.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY
(Ray S. Bassuter, Head Curator)

The past year was notable for the quantity and value of geological
material acquired, particularly in the mineralogical division, where
several endowment funds were used rather freely to take advantage of
favorable market conditions. In quality of specimens acquired
through field work and exchange, this has been the most outstanding
year in the history of the division of vertebrate paleontology. Ex-
plorations were undertaken in both of the paleontological divisions
and in the mineralogical division, the latter under the auspices of the
Canfield fund. All resulted in the acquisition of desirable material
both for exhibition and study.

ACCESSIONS

In both specimens and accessions the aggregate is greater than last
year, numbering 255 accessions with an estimated total of 35,555
specimens. The number for the various divisions is as follows:
Mineralogy and petrology, 100 accessions, 728 specimens; geology,
systematic and applied, 33 accessions, 706 specimens; stratigraphic
paleontology, 92 accessions, 33,805 specimens; vertebrate paleontol-
ogy, 30 accessions, 316 specimens.

The year’s accessions include the following minerals not previously
represented: Alkansul, alleghanyite, ardealite, bianchite (type),
corvusite (type), galaxite, leucophosphite, minyulite, oxykertschenite,
pisekite, rilandite (type), rosickyite, and tuhualite.

There were 31 accessions to the Roebling collection through the
income from the Roebling fund, totaling 114 specimens. Perhaps the
finest item is a 24-pound pink spodumene (kunzite) of good crystal
form and almost flawless. Four fine black opals from Lightning
Ridge, New South Wales, are partly polished to show the wonderful
fire that makes these Australian stones most highly prized of all
opals. Two 1.7-carat diamonds were added to the American series,
1 from Huntsville, Tex., and 1 from the gold washings of Brown
County, Ind. A fine cinnamon-brown crystal of topaz from Burma
weighs 24% pounds. A huge mass of native copper from the Lake
Superior region shows numerous unusually large and well-formed
crystals. Other noteworthy additions are a specimen of quartz
with attached crystals of euclase and topaz from Brazil; 3 speci-
mens of California gold showing unusually fine crystals; a beautiful

108
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 109

crystal of pink and green tourmaline from Madagascar; and 2 large
loose crystals of the rare silicate euclase from Brazil. Through the
interest of Gilbert LaBine, discoverer of the rich radium deposits at
Great Bear Lake, Canada, a 75-pound mass of the radium ore pitch-
blende, crusted with colorful alteration products, and a rich mass of
native silver from the same locality, were added.

Several fine-cut gems were acquired through the Roebling fund,
including a rare Brazilian rose-red topaz of 18 carats, a Madagascar
ruby tourmaline of 30 carats, a flawless Brazilian pink tourmaline of
62 carats, and an unusual pink amethyst of 49 carats.

To the Canfield collection through the Canfield fund came 13
accessions totaling 235 specimens. The outstanding one comprises
three masses of crystallized gold from Breckenridge, Colo., the largest
being a slab of fine mossy leaf gold weighing 22.6 troy ounces. A
large group of brilliant azurite crystals from Aranzazu, Zacatecas,
Mexico, was obtained through the interest of Samuel Sokobin,
American consul at Saltillo, Coahuila. Other notable specimens are
a group of azurite crystals; a crystal of cerussite from Tsumeb,
Southwest Africa; the copper oxychloride atacamite from Chile; a rare
phosphate of iron, strengite, and the phosphate of lead, pyromorphite,
in unusually large crystals, both from Germany; a group of large and
brilliant crystals of tin oxide, cassiterite, on a white quartz crystal
base, from New South Wales; a huge crystal of pyrite from Arizona;
and a rich example of the rare manganese silicate ganophyllite from
Franklin, N.J. Over 200 Bolivian minerals, including excellent
crystallized cassiterite, ferberite, and bismuthinite also were acquired.

The finest stone added to the Isaac Lea collection, through the
Frances Lea Chamberlain fund, is a flawless golden beryl of fine color
from Madagascar, weighing 46 carats. Also, 2 red tourmalines from
Madagascar, an engraved emerald of 11 carats, an old carving in
Burmese amber, a rare ruby-red feldspar, and 2 unusually deep-
colored citrine quartzes were added.

Other additions to the gem collection include 3 cabochons of
white grossularite garnets, 3 of Whitby jet, 3 of amazonstone, and
several pieces of jaspar. The Oregon Agate and Mineral Society
contributed an unusual cut agate showing iridescent rainbow colors;
Martin L. Ehrmann presented a dish of yellow precious serpentine;
and John H. Willing 3 gold stickpins fashioned as a pick, a shovel,
and a pan, stated to have been made in 1855 and worn by early
California gold miners.

A huge quartz geode, almost 3 feet in diameter and with a crystal-
lined cavity 18 inches deep, from Keokuk, Iowa, was presented by
William M. Thomas and his son, Beverly Thomas. Mr. Thomas,
a veteran geode collector, states that this is the finest geode he has
ever seen. W. E. Lockhart gave a huge slab of amazonstone, meas-
110 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

uring about 3 feet square, from Colorado. The following persons
likewise added unusually fine material to the collection: Ernest
Schernikow, a slab of precious opal from Honduras; F. F. Bradley,
a fine group of celestite crystals from Clay Center, Ohio; Mark Bandy,
a large specimen of the rare iron sulphate quetenite, from Chile;
Boodle Lane, a specimen of galena showing parallel growth, and John
C. Wells, specimens of new phosphate minerals from the Black Hills.

Twenty-two specimens, including 14 falls new to the collection,
were added to the meteorite series. Two of exceptional interest
are from Meteor Crater, Canyon Diablo, Ariz., one a complete
individual weighing 1,011 pounds, one of the largest masses recovered
at this famous crater, the other the mass from which were obtained
the first diamonds found in a meteorite. Another example is the
largest individual of a shower that fell at Archie, Mo., on August
10, 1932, during the Perseid meteor shower. This is the second
known instance of the fall of a meteorite during a meteor shower.
Other meteorite accessions are one half (23% pounds) of the Altonah,
Utah, fall; Beardsley, Kans. (945 grams); Bear Lodge, Wyo. (3,120
grams); Bencubbin, Australia (242 grams); Coya Norte, Chile (16
pounds 10 ounces); Henbury, Australia (31 pounds); Huizopa,
Mexico (2,774 grams); Melrose, N.Mex. (990 grams); Nagy Vazsony,
Hungary (36 grams); New Almelo, N. Mex. (1,550 grams); Oroville,
Calif. (262 grams); Pinon, N.Mex. (1,410 grams); and Tlacatopec,
Mexico (2,430 grams), acquired through exchanges and gifts.

The United States Geological Survey transferred several described
sets of rocks and ores, the following districts being represented:
Ellijay quadrangle, North Carolina; eastern Oregon; Squaw Creek,
Silver Peak, and Antonio districts, Oregon; and southwestern Idaho.
Through the interest of Dr. Josiah Bridge, the Museum obtained from
Ramie Inman two large blocks of a handsome diabase porphyry from
Fredericktown, Mo. Dr. Robert W. Sayles presented two large
exhibition blocks of a glacial conglomerate, the Squantum tillite,
and Dr. Tom Barth collected two large exhibition blocks of gneiss
in Norway.

The outstanding accessions in economic geology are as follows:
A pegmatite dike from Ohio City, Colo., containing large sheets of
lepidolite mica obtained through E. B. Eckel, of the United States
Geological Survey, from Messrs. Werner and Disberger, of Ohio
City; a 600-pound mass of gold ore from the Homestake Mining Co.,
Lead, S.Dak.; two large and colorful potash ores, sylvinite and
carnallite, from the Minas de Potasa de Suria, Spain; several speci-
mens of halite and related minerals from Hallstatt, Austria, sent by
Bergrat Karl Krieger; a series of copper ores and minerals including
some large specimens from Butte, Mont., presented by A. L. Bigley
and A. E. Blair, of the Anaconda Copper Co.; and a number of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM Lil

specially selected Bisbee copper ores from William P. Crawford, of
Bisbee, Ariz. Frank L. Hess, honorary custodian of rare metals,
continued his interest by adding over 50 specimens of rare metal
ores and minerals from Canada, the Kola Peninsula, Karelin, Brazil,
and other districts.

Several notable accessions came to the division of stratigraphic
paleontology: 26 exchanges arranged largely by the assistant curator
to fill gaps in the brachiopod series were received. The British
Museum and Dr. R. Kozlowski at Warsaw and Dr. A. Hadding at
Lund supplied fine Jurassic and Cretaceous brachiopods. The
National Museum at Melbourne and the Dominion Museum at
Wellington furnished two fine collections from the Tertiary of the
Australian realm, and the Paleontological Institute of Vienna a
small collection of rare Triassic forms. From Harvard University
was obtained a large suite from the Middle Paleozoic of Bohemia.
Collections from the Devonian were furnished by Dr. A. Opilk in
Estonia and by the Muséum Royal d’Histoire Naturelle de Belgique,
Brussels. Finally, two sizable lots from the Universities of Okla-
homa and New Mexico placed in our collection a more adequate
representation of Upper Paleozoic brachiopods from these States.

Among the other exchanges were two lots of Bohemian fossils
from Charles University, Prague; an excellent representation of
the Norwegian Cambrian from Oslo; a series of topotypes of Car-
boniferous fossils from the University of London; and an interesting
series from the University of Adelaide. Dr. H. Justin Roddy again
furnished an extraordinary collection from the Lower Cambrian of
the Lancaster region in Pennsylvania.

Several valuable collections were presented, most notable being
the fifth shipment of the private collection of Dr. A. F. Foerste,
numbering some 10,000 specimens of invertebrate fossils of which
over 1,000 are types. Particularly notable is the valuable acqui-
sition of several fine fossil starfishes collected by the late Dr. Albert
Perry Brigham, of Colgate University, and presented by Mrs. Brig-
ham and Mr. and Mrs. L. V. Roth. Dr. J. Brookes Knight, of Yale
University, gave about 125 brachiopods from the Pennsylvanian of
Missouri, and Prof. G. M. Kay, at Columbia University, a collection of
Trenton brachiopods. Through the interest of Dr. Mary J. Rathbun,
six lots of fossil crustaceans were donated, among which those fur-
nished by Dr. Hubert G. Schenck, of Stanford University, and some
pinnotherid crabs, including types, gift of E. W. Galliher, Pacific
Grove, Calif., were of most importance.

Among other gifts were a collection of Pennsylvanian gastropods
from J. Brookes Knight, of Yale University; a small lot of Pennsyl-
vanian fossils from Ralph H. King, University of Texas; a large exhi-
bition slab crowded with the gastropod Lecanospira found in Virginia
112 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

by Dr. A. A. L. Mathews, Oberlin College; examples of the fresh-
water limestone crowded with fossils, used to build the new Mormon
Church in Washington, secured through the builders; and finally a
valuable lot of Tennessee Cambrian fossils collected by Prof. George
M. Hall, University of Tennessee.

The Springer fund purchased the important Keyte collection of
Paleozoic fossil crinoids from Colorado. The assistant curator during
his field expedition obtained 10,000 to 15,000 fossils in Gaspe and
New York. These supplied many important specimens for the bio-
logic and stratigraphic series and also needed material for exchange.
A trip into the Ohio Valley by the head curator also furnished a
valuable lot of late Paleozoic fossils.

Of the eight accessions of fossil plants, mention may be made
of those received from Prof. Ralph Chaney, University of California,
which contain many counterparts of types described in several
papers. Prof. G. R. Wieland, of Yale, donated two examples of the
interesting fern Tempskya, and the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural
History gave some Pleistocene plants excellently preserved in asphalt.

Material resulting from the field expedition of 1932 is of first
importance in the division of vertebrate paleontology, especially
benefiting the mammalian collections. Specimens worthy of especial
mention are: Much of the skeleton of a hawklike bird, of which the
skull, lower jaw, pelvis, sternum, and other bones are present, un-
questionably the most perfect skeleton of a bird yet collected from
the Oligocene of North America; a skull and skeletal parts of Husmilus,
a rare saber-toothed cat of which only three or four specimens were
previously known; two articulated skeletons of Mesohippus; two
articulated skeletons of Merycoidodon; one skeleton each of Lep-
tomeryx and Ischyromys; 120 skulls, many partial skeletons, articu-
lated limbs and feet, in all representing more than 20 genera of verte-
brates. Some forms new to science will probably be found when a
study is made of these materials.

Through exchanges arranged with various institutions, the division
obtained a number of specimens of outstanding merit. From the
American Museum of Natural History came a mountable skeleton
of Moropus, a rare mammal from the Miocene of Nebraska, and a
skeleton of the giant reptile Gorgosaurus libratus from the Upper
Cretaceous of Canada. The former has all the broken and missing
bones restored so that the skeleton is ready for mounting. Both
genera were previously unrepresented in our collections. The Los
Angeles Museum of History, Science and Art furnished a mountable
composite skeleton of Hquus occidentalis, from the famous Rancho La
Brea asphalt deposits; and the Colorado Museum of Natural History,
Denver, a composite skeleton of the Oligocene rhinoceros, Trigonias
osborni. From the Royal Ontario Paleontological Museum were
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 113

obtained two duck-billed dinosaur skulls (Hdmontosaurus and Prosau-
rolophus), both new in the collections, and from the National Museum
of South Africa four skulls and limb and foot bones of Lystrosaurus
and Dicynodon, extinct reptiles from the Triassic. Remains of these
genera are rarely found in paleontological collections of North America.
A beautifully preserved skull of Equus alaskae Hay from Point Barrow,
Alaska, was collected for the Museum by James A. Ford. A fossil
frog skeleton from the Miocene of Nevada, the most perfect example
of an extinct frog yet found on this continent, was presented by R. M.
Catlin. A skull of a large cetacean from California, presented by
Dr. A. P. Ousdal, forms a valued addition to the series of cetacean
remains. By purchase from George IF’. Sternberg a beautiful example
of the extinct fish Ichthyodectes hamatus was obtained, and similarly
the mosasaur series was enriched by a mountable skeleton of the large
sea lizard Platecarpus.

INSTALLATION AND PRESERVATION OF COLLECTIONS

A rearrangement of the systematic mineral collection, reported last
year as under way, was completed, and much new and striking mate-
rial from the Roebling and Canfield collections was incorporated.
The 2,892 specimens of this series include 837 distinct mineral species
and comprise high-quality material only. The new arrangement
permitted the introduction of some new exhibits in refractories, lith-
ium, beryllium and rare-earth ores. Several large specimens of ores
from important mining districts were installed on new bases. Five
large meteorites, previously exhibited on individual bases, were rein-
stalled on a single long base to harmonize with previous installations.
Some striking exhibits on individual pedestals include a large geode
from Iowa fitted with interior lighting, radium ore from Canada,
and a group of carved corals.

The head curator prepared a new set of slides on geological subjects
for the stereomotorgraph, assembled a set of small, polished samples of
foreign building stones, both ancient and modern, and prepared
various sets of Cenozoic and recent bryozoans for exchange with the
British Museum, in the course of which many specimens were identi-
fied and added to the collections. He also continued building up a
library of pamphlets on general geology, stratigraphy, and invertebrate
paleontology.

In revising the exhibition series of ores it was found necessary to
expand the study series to accommodate material removed from
exhibition, during which the classification, cataloging, and distribution
of the important collection of rare metal ores assembled during many
years’ collecting by Frank L. Hess were completed by the assistant
curator. This is probably the finest collection of rare-metal ores
extant.
114 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

Dr. W. F. Foshag, assisted by James Benn, selected material for an
exhibit illustrating the fluorescence of minerals under ultraviolet
light. Since only an occasional specimen shows a satisfactory degree
of fluorescence, it was necessary to examine hundreds of samples
before the best possible effect could be achieved. A satisfactory
lighting system was devised by L. B. Clark, of the Division of
Radiation and Organisms.

The head curator completed the preparation and installation of the
biologic series of fossil plants, a case illustrating the geology of a
coral island, one showing various types of geological structures,
another with imitative forms of fossils, and one each of the peculiar
extinct merostome crustaceans and unusual cephalopods. He like-
wise installed on a single exhibition base large, showy examples of
various kinds of conglomerates and glacial boulder clays.

Dr. C. E. Resser, with the help of Dr. Josiah Bridge, assembled an
exhibit illustrating the life of the Ozarkian and Canadian periods,
thus filling a long-existing gap. In cooperation with Dr. Roland
Brown and Dr. C. B. Read, of the United States Geological Survey,
available material also was assembled to illustrate fossilized fruits and
flowers.

Dr. G. A. Cooper placed 30 lithologic samples in the stratigraphic
exhibition series, revised the exhibit of stromatopores, and, at the
close of the year, went over the entire exhibition series in preparation
for the International Geological Congress. Dr. C. B. Read continued
his voluntary rearrangement of the Lacoe plants. Dr. Charles Butts
arranged his extensive collections of Paleozoic fossils so that they are
readily available.

Following her retirement from the Government service at the end of
December 1932, Miss Margaret Moodey was appointed, under the
Springer fund, to take up the long-delayed work of cataloging the
unrivaled Springer collection of echinoderms. Two months were
spent in bibliographic work and 4 months in checking and cataloging.
At the end of the year, 8 families of the Camerata, comprising 115
standard drawers, were completed.

The exhibition series in vertebrate paleontology was increased by
the addition of a 5-foot skeleton of Ichthyodectes hamatus, skulls of
Edmontosaurus regalis Lambe and Prosaurolophus maximus Brown;
skull and lower jaws of Hyrachodon and a skull of Ovibos.

Assistant Curator C. L. Gazin continued his rearrangement of the
mammal collection. The Cumberland Cave collection, consisting of
several hundred specimens, is now completely cataloged, labeled, and
arranged in standard trays; the Plesippus materials have been assorted
and, with the exception of the skulls, assembled as a single unit;
the Cook collection from Idaho and the Gidley collection from Florida
were assorted, labeled, and many of the specimens cataloged. Dr.
Gazin also has identified many of the Bridger specimens.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 115

INVESTIGATION AND RESEARCH

By members of the staff—The head curator completed the pre-
liminary study and illustrations of the Hederellidae, a new group
of fossil Bryozoa; brought up to date his bibliographic index of
Paleozoic Ostracoda, being published by the Geological Society of
America; prepared an address on the development of invertebrate
paleontology in America; and forwarded for publication a mono-
graph of the Tertiary Bryozoa of Australia, prepared in collaboration
with the late Ferdinand Canu.

Dr. W. F. Foshag completed investigations on the rare minerals
searlesite, bakerite, ganophyllite, and sulfohalite and continued
work on the borate minerals of the West, in which it was necessary
to analyze a number of marls. Several doubtful minerals were
studied and their true nature determined.

EK. P. Henderson announced two new mineral species, corvusite
and rilandite, and nearly completed work on two other new species.
Many partial analyses were made for identification, and some mate-
rial was found worthy of more detailed examination.

Dr. C. E. Resser assisted R. Endo in preparing a paper on the
Cambrian of Manchuria. He completed a paper presenting a pre-
liminary generalized time scale for the Cambrian and began a de-
scription of the fossils from the Olenellus zone in the Appalachians.
These last papers were presented at the Boston meeting of the
Geological Society of America.

Dr. G. A. Cooper prepared a preliminary paper on the results of
his field work in eastern New York and another, written jointly
with Dr. Lawrence Whitcomb, of Lehigh University, describing a
new genus of brachiopod.

Dr. E. O. Ulrich continued his studies of early Paleozoic faunas.
A grant from the Geological Society of America made possible the
temporary employment of Dr. H. S. Ladd, who since February was
engaged in labeling and photographing fossils and in organizing
materials so that Dr. Ulrich’s many uncompleted manuscripts, in-
cluding joint papers with Drs. Foerste, Cooper, Bridge, and others,
may finally be printed.

Dr. A. F. Foerste continued his cephalopod studies, unearthing
much important information. He will soon reach the point when the
cephalopod series can be generally overhauled and classified. |

C. W. Gilmore completed a manuscript describing dinosaurian
remains from the Cretaceous of Mongolia, which has been sent to
the American Museum of Natural History for publication. A
beginning was made on a study of turtle specimens from Mongolia
for that institution. This will complete our part of the cooperative
arrangement between the two institutions whereby for work done

72774—85——9
116 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

on the Mongolian fauna, Dr. G. G. Simpson will study and describe
the Museum’s collection of Paleocene mammals.

Dr. C. L. Gazin completed his extended study of the Cumberland
Cave Pleistocene fauna and submitted it for publication. Two
papers, ‘“A New Shrew from the Upper Pliocene of Idaho” and
“The Status of the Extinct American Eland’, were published, and
a manuscript, ‘‘New Ielids from the Upper Pliocene of Idaho”, was
submitted for publication. Some progress was made on his study
of the Plesippus materials, as well as a beginning in the study of
other portions of the Idaho collections, particularly the mustelids
and lagomorphs.

Dr. Remington Kellogg, as in previous years, continued his re-
searches on the cetacean collection, this past year being more par-
ticularly applied to the zeuglodonts.

Research by outside investigators aided by Museum material.—
During the year 1,767 specimens were lent for study, and 463 lots
of material were received for examination and report.

In the paleontological division, Dr. David White was engaged on
a description of the Pottsville flora of Illinois. Dr. R. W. Brown
continued the study of the Fort Union flora and wrote papers de-
scribing the flora of the Miocene of the Blue Mountains, Oreg., and
of the Salmon, Idaho, region. Jointly with Dr. C. B. Read, he
nearly completed a revision of the Cretaceous fern genus Tempskya.
Dr. Read prepared papers on the floras in the Mosquito Range,
Colo., and in the New Providence shale and on Trichopitys. Dr.
L. W. Stephenson was engaged in a study of the Navarro fauna of
the Texas Cretaceous, and Dr. Edwin Kirk continued his studies
on crinoids and completed several papers.

Dr. T. Kobayashi remained here throughout the year continuing
his studies of Korean and Manchurian fossils. Much new informa-
tion of critical importance is constantly coming to light in his studies.

Abbé Georges Le Maitre, the Belgian scientist, studied the mete-
orite collection; Dr. M. K. Elias, of the Kansas State Geological
Survey, spent some weeks studying Carboniferous and Tertiary
plants. A. L. Morrow, of Yale University, R. W. Imlay, of the
University of Michigan, and Prof. H. A. Meyerhoff, of Smith Col-
lege, studied the Mesozoic collections; Dr. A. R. Barwick, of Catholic
University, studied the invertebrate fossil collection in general; Dr.
J. A. Cushman the foraminifera; Dr. Cecil Kindle, of the College of
the City of New York, and Dr. Lawrence Whitcomb, of Lehigh
University, the Paleozoic invertebrates; and Prof. P. E. Raymond
and Henry C. Stetson, of Harvard University, spent a few days
working on certain Burgess shale specimens.

Dr. George G. Simpson made considerable progress in his study
of the Paleocene mammal collection. A locality map, printed as a
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM EZ

result of his field trip to Montana for the Museum this past sum-
mer, adds greatly to the value of the collection in definitely locating
all the specimens both geologically and geographically. Dr. R. S.
Lull, director of the Peabody Museum of Natural History, utilized
the horned dinosaur collections in connection with his monographic
revision of the Ceratopsian dinosauria. Barnum Brown, of the
American Museum of Natural History, likewise made use of the col-
lections in connection with his study of the armored dinosauria.

Assistance to Government bureaus and private individuals.—Mineral-
ogical material was furnished to members of the Geological Survey,
the Department of Agriculture, and the Geophysical Laboratory, and
Dr. Resser continued his services to the Geological Survey as
adviser on Cambrian questions. Requests from Prof. George M.
Hall, of the University of Tennessee, for identification of age and
species in Cambrian collections necessitated considerable study of the
Nolichucky fossils. Thereby, for the first time, definite information
was obtained regarding the faunal characteristics of this widespread
southern Appalachian formation. A large series of highly important
Cambrian fossils was obtained by the Princeton Summer School, at
Red Lodge, Mont., and forwarded to the Museum for preliminary
identification.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE OF SPECIMENS

The following distribution of geological specimens was made:
Gifts, 3,456 specimens; exchanges, 2,278; loans for study, 1,767. As
transfers to other Government bureaus, 21 specimens were sent.

NUMBER OF SPECIMENS UNDER DEPARTMENT

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND INDUSTRIES
(Cart W. Mirman, Head Curator)

For the first 2 months of the year, following the retirement of
W. deC. Ravenel on June 30, 1932, the department of arts and
industries was administered by J. E. Graf, associate director. On
September 6, 1932, the office of head curator was established and an
administrative set-up created similar to that of the natural science
departments of the Museum. C. W. Mitman, who had spent 3
months of the summer in a general survey of technical, industrial,
and science museums of western Europe, was advanced from the
position of curator of engineering to the new position; and Frank A.
Taylor was promoted from assistant curator of engineering to curator.

ACCESSIONS FOR THE YEAR

Valuable historical specimens of textiles, engineering, and graphic
arts that never would have come to light in boom times were brought
to the department’s attention during the year and acquired when
possible. Slack business, on the other hand, practically prevented the
acquisition of new industrial exhibits, but permitted many who had
cooperated with the Museum in the past to renew their exhibits.

Specimens added to the department’s collections during 1933
totaled 4,261, about one third more than in 1932. The distribution
of these among the divisions and sections was as follows: Engineering,
312; textiles, 708; organic chemistry, 764; wood technology, 365;
foods, 2; history of agriculture, 252; medicine, 425; graphic arts,
including photography, 1,433.

Engineering.—The 312 specimens included in the 82 accessions
of this division were assigned to the sections as follows: Aeronautics,
174; mechanical technology, 130; mineral technology, 8.

In aeronautics, the most prominent object acquired was the
gondola, or car, of the Pilgrim, the first dirigible designed for inflation
with helium gas. It is complete with the Laurence 3-cylinder radial
engine and the 4-blade metal propeller used with it, and was presented
by the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.

The collection pertaining to the early history of balloons was
augmented by the gift of Miss Emma Durant, of New York City, of a
number of original illustrations and records describing the work of
her father, Charles F. Durant, the first professional American aero-
naut, who made his first ascent from Castle Garden, New York City,

118
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 119

in 1830. Two structural sections from the airships Shenandoah and
Akron, showing two forms of trusses, came from Howard Minker,
Washington, D.C., and the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., respectively.
To the collection of aircraft engines the Pratt & Whitney Co.,
Hartford, Conn., added a sectioned operating example of their
“Wasp” engine. Seven airship propellers were transferred from the
War Department; an adjustable metal airplane propeller of 1914 was
presented by Inglis M. Uppercu, Keyport, N.J.; and a modern hollow
steel blade from a Dicks propeller was given by the Pittsburgh Screw
& Bolt Corporation. A departure from the usual form of lift and
propulsion is illustrated by a wind-tunnel model of a rotary airfoil,
presented by its inventor, I. B. Laskowitz, Brooklyn, N.Y.
Although several full-size airplanes were offered to the Museum
during the year, none could be accepted because of limited space.
To the collection of airplane models, however, many new types were
added, including a beautifully constructed miniature of a ‘‘Travelair”’
biplane of 1930, one eighth size and half skeletonized to show the
construction. It is one of the finest models in the collection and was
loaned by its maker, Herbert Atkinson, of New Bedford, Mass. The
acquisition of a Curtiss pusher model of the 1908 type and a Curtiss
“Hawk” model of 1928, both made to the same scale, permits an
interesting contrast of airplane design over a 20-year period. These
models were received from Edward Reeves and Richard Hooper,
respectively, of Washington, D.C. Another model received from
Mr. Reeves illustrates the old ‘‘ Antoinette” type, a French mono-
plane of 1909, which made remarkable flights in the early days of
aviation. A German World War bombing airplane is represented
by a model of a ‘“‘Gotha’’, made and presented by Isaac H. Henry,
of Easton, Md. Modern military types are shown by a ‘‘Condor”
bomber model from Harris Taylor, Clarendon, Va.; a Boeing low-wing
monoplane model from Robert McGregor, Clarksburg, W.Va.; and
a Navy Vought ‘Corsair’? model made by Edwin Geigan, Washing-
ton, D.C., and received from Miss EK. M. Luers, Bowie, Md. The
series of models illustrating the winners of the famed Schneider
trophy for seaplanes was increased by a miniature of the Supermarine
S-6-B, which won the trophy in 1931 at a speed of 340 miles an hour.
The model was made and presented by Ivan Lettner, Anacostia, D.C.
With the assistance of the War Department, A. G. Spalding Co.,
New York, Sternheimer Bros., Richmond, Va., and the Transcon-
tinental and Western Air, Inc., Kansas City, Mo., a display of fliers’
helmets was prepared showing the evolution of pilots’ headgear from
the old crash helmets of the early days to the uniform cap of the
modern transport pilot.
The Beverly Hills (Calif.) Chamber of Commerce presented the
parachute with which the flier Rodman Law made a demonstration
120 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

jump from an airplane in 1912, one of the first instances of its kind.
This accession provides the Museum with an example of the old
“bundle” type of parachute, antedating the several pack types
already exhibited.

Col. Charles A. Lindbergh added to his previous gift of the Spirit
of St. Louis the maps and personal equipment that he carried during
his Pan American flight of 1927-28. Much of this material was in-
tended for emergency use in event of a forced landing in the jungles
of Central America.

The largest single group of accessions in the section of mechanical
technology was in the class of material relating to land transportation.
The sole full-size vehicle added this year was a Columbia electric
buggy of about 1903-6, the gift of Mrs. Sewell M. Johnson, Wash-
ington, D.C. This vehicle is a well-preserved example of the light
electric automobile that in its day was so much more dependable
than the unperfected gasoline automobile that it was the choice of
conservative and professional people. Other automotive material
included the steam engine built by the Mason Regulator Co. in 1897
for the first Stanley steam automobile; and a Stanley steam auto-
mobile engine of about 1923 from L. J. Hathaway, Cherrydale, Va.

The railroad and locomotive collection was enhanced by the
addition of three models of English locomotives of about 25 years
ago. They are the gift of Frank A. Wardlaw, Jr., Inspiration, Ariz.,
and Frank A. Wardlaw, New York City, and include the Locomotive
Greyhound of the L. & N.W. Ry. Co., and the Locomotive 146 of the
¥.C.O. Rr. (Argentine) of 1905, which were made by Mr. Wardlaw,
Sr.; and the Caledonian Railroad Co.’s Locomotive 903. ‘These
locomotives exhibit many features foreign to American practice not
heretofore shown in the collections. An unusual railroad item was a
Japanese drawing in color of a Norris locomotive, tender, and car of
1853, the gift of C. P. Clausen, Washington, D.C. The Japanese
date of the picture indicates that it was made about 1853 and con-
sequently only a year or two after Commodore Perry negotiated the
treaty with Japan. Miss Martha Hopkins, Damariscotta, Maine,
presented an old single-ox yoke, a type of which not many are known
to exist.

The watercraft collection received only one addition during the
year—a nicely executed model of the champion ice yacht Debutante
ITI, presented by John D. Buckstaff, Oshkosh, Wis., and Douglas
Van Dyke, Milwaukee, Wis. The original is the present holder of the
Stuart trophy and the world’s record over a 20-mile triangular course.

In the class of electrical material the additions to the collection of
incandescent lamps are of considerable interest. Frank A. Wardlaw,
New York City, an associate of Thomas A. Edison, presented 2
originals of the Edison paper horseshoe filament lamp of 1879, 2
REPORT OF 1HE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM PAI

of the bamboo filament lamps of 1880, and an original wooden-screw
socket for each type. The paper filament lamps, one of which is
intact, are of the first type made after the successful experimental
lamp of October 1879, and the bamboo filament lamps, one of which
is intact, are the first commercial type. Donald F. Poole, Washing-
ton, D.C., presented two early Maxim lamps with sockets. A more
modern note in electric lighting is represented in a display panel of
eight rare gas discharge tubes, the gift of the Air Reduction Sales
Co., New York City. Two fans received show early stages in the
development of this electrical appliance. One, made by Leo Daft,
electrical pioneer, and dating from before 1890, is the gift of Mrs.
Matilda Daft Williams, Albany, N.Y. It is small, with an unguarded
fan wheel mounted on the shaft of a small motor with long vertical
field coils. The other is a Holtzer Cabot fan of about 1900, in which
the earlier type of motor and same general arrangement are still
evident though dressed up in a heavy cast-iron base and grilled
housing. This fan is the gift of Mrs. Mae I. English and Mrs. L. F
Speich, Washington, D.C.

A Merritt typewriter of about 1890, one of the first few machines
made by the Merritt Typewriter Co., Springfield, Mass., and a com-
mercial form of a machine formerly represented in the collection by a
Patent Office model only, was the only addition to the typewriter
collection. It was presented by C. C. Merritt, nephew of the inventor.

Two Edison phonographs were added to the collections. One, an
original of the tin-foil record type, was presented by Frank A. Ward-
law; the other, a nicely preserved ‘‘Amberola-50” of about 1915, the
gift of Clarence Beyer, Baltimore, Md., represents the final develop-
ment of the wax-cylinder record type, and is complete with a group of
select records.

Among the additions to the collection of surveying and astronomical
instruments is the Herschelian reflecting telescope made by Amasa
Holcomb, of Southwick, Mass., about 1835. The reflector, about 8
inches in diameter and having a focal length of about 9 feet, is of
speculum metal and has a remarkably well preserved surface. It is
the gift of Mrs. Grace E. Holcomb Steere and Mrs. Eva C. Holcomb
Storey, Southwick, Mass., who also presented an astronomical
transit and instrument tripod by the same maker. From the War
Department came an interesting form of large reconnoitering tele-
scope and an astronomical transit, both about 60 years old.

Among the watches added to the timekeeping collections is an
English silver case watch dated 1794, the movement of which is
marked ‘‘Effingham Embree, New York.’ Not many watches in the
collection dating from 1800 carry the names of American makers or
importers. It is the gift of Mrs. Gertrude O. S. Cleveland, Quine-
baug, Conn. Clocks added to the collection include two tall case
122 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

clocks of the early nineteenth century, one the gift of Mrs. Daniel
Gardner, Newburgh, N.Y., the other of Mrs. James R. Van Horn,
Washington, D.C. An early electric master-clock system, which was
installed in the Arts and Industries Building when erected and
which was removed during the past year, was added to the collection
for its technical interest.

To the section of mineral technology the Carborundum Co.,
Niagara Falls, N.Y., gave a model of a carborundum grain sifter as an
addition to the splendid models that the same company presented
last year to show the processes of manufacture of carborundum abra-
sive products. A group of lathe tools made with ‘‘Firthite” alloy
cutting edge inserts, a small piece of ‘‘Firthite’”’, and a wire drawing
die with a ‘‘Firthaloy”’ insert were added to the metallurgy exhibits
by L. Gerald Firth, McKeesport, Pa. Philip McKenna, Latrobe,
Pa., presented a lathe tool with a ‘‘Vascaloy”’ insert.

Textiles, organic chemistry, wood technology, foods, history of agri-
culture, and medicine.—Because of the increasing interest of the public
in early American textiles, efforts were made to carry out the plans
proposed in last year’s report for special exhibitions of home handi-
crafts in textiles. Mrs. William S. Corby, Chevy Chase, Md., loaned
for this purpose part of her collection of early American coverlets.
These examples of a household industry, which began in Colonial days
and continued until the Civil War, were collected in Virginia, Massa-
chusetts, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Maryland, and Florida. Other
coverlets for this exhibition were loaned by Capt. James A. Stader,
Neosho, Mo., and C. H. Popenoe, Silver Spring, Md.

Beautiful examples of artistic needlework, made before the days of
the sewing machine, were received as gifts as follows: From Mrs.
Kate Vinson a silk applique quilt designed and made in Baltimore,
Md., 1845, by the donor’s mother; from Miss Isabelle M. Erwin and
Miss Mildred A. Erwin a white quilted counterpane and a cotton
patchwork quilt, pieced in ‘‘Trish Chain” pattern, both made in South
Carolina in 1850; and from Mrs. Mary E. Lyddane linen samplers
made in 1804 and 1833. Mrs. Laurence Stabler, Alexandria, Va.,
loaned two appliqued cotton quilts, one in “‘Tree of Life” design
made in 1802, the other in 1830; and a small linen sampler worked in
1733. Mrs. Daniel Gardner added 27 miscellaneous textile articles.
The Museum is indebted to Miss Susan P. Keech for a cotton coverlet,
made of a monochrome copper cylinder print—the so-called ‘‘'Toile de
la Bastile’”—which has been in the Keech family of Harford County,
Md., for 70 years or more.

The Cotton-Textile Institute continued its valued cooperation by
the presentation of two series of modern cotton fabrics produced by
American manufacturers. Further additions to the display of sea-
sonal cotton dress goods were made by Galey & Lord, who presented
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 1B

specimens of fancy weave cotton and rayon fabrics. The Celanese
Corporation of America contributed a new series of examples of piece-
dyed dress materials to replace the specimens presented last year.
To the Flatau Fabrics Corporation the Museum is indebted for ex-
amples of warp-printed, novelty silk crepe fabrics, finished by a
special process to give the material a sandy feel when handled. ‘The
cooperation of Sidney Blumenthal & Co. was continued by the gift
of specimens of upholstery and drapery pile fabrics, cloaking and
velvet dress fabrics, and a printed velour bathmat, these to replace
some of the specimens contributed by this firm during the past 19
years.

The Armstrong Cork Co. presented a full series showing the manu-
facture of linoleum and suggestions for the interior decoration of differ-
ent types of rooms; the Standard Textile Products Co. specimens
illustrating the manufacture of wall and table oilcloth and uses to
which these materials may be put; and M. J. Whittall Associates a
series of specimens illustrating the manufacture of wool carpet yarns.
The Universal Winding Co. sent examples of windings of bare and
insulated wires for electrical purposes, which had been wound on
winders of different types.

Through the courtesy of T. A. Keleher, a live exhibit of about 300
half-grown silkworms was set up in the textile hall. They were placed
on shelves in a special glass case, where they were fed fresh mulberry
leaves every few hours until the cocoons were spun, the first week of
June.

Specimens of new rubber products and a historical series illus-
trating the development of rubber pneumatic tires from 1904 to the
present time were contributed by the B. F. Goodrich Rubber Co.
The United Shoe Machinery Corporation added to its exhibit a new
series showing a recently perfected shoemaking method.

For the collections pertaining to agricultural history were received
three models of the Cyrus Hall McCormick grain reaper constructed,
one eighth size, according to the specifications of United States
Patents Nos. 3895 and 5335, issued June 21, 1834, January 31, 1845,
and October 23, 1847. The first was the gift of Secretary Abbot; the
others of the McCormick Historical Association, which also presented
three groups of documents, one relating to the development of two
hillside plows, patented by Cyrus Hall McCormick in 1831 and
1833; one to the development of the reaper by Cyrus Hall McCormick;
and one to a threshing machine invented by Robert McCormick in
1834.

An interesting specimen was received from Miss Anna Tiede in
the form of a blank book of veneer cut from western white pine.
The sheets were cut with a slicing knife, but, ingeniously, were not
cut,entirely through, just enough wood being left at the back to bind
them. The sheets are not glued at any point.
124 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

Gerrit S. Miller, Jr., collected in Puerto Rico during March and
April 1932 for the section of wood technology 74 woods from a region
heretofore only scantily represented in the collection. These specimens
are backed by herbarium material in the division of plants. The Uni-
versity of Poznan sent a set of 63 samples of the woods of Poland in
exchange fora collection of woods of the United States. At the sug-
gestion of Mr. Miller, E. N. Bancroft, surveyor general of Kingston,
Jamaica, collected for the Museum wood samples of Jamaican trees,
most of which are backed by herbarium material in the division of
plants. Most of these are generous trunk sections.

Other woods received from various contributors for the study
collection comprise single billets or trunk sections. One is a 17-inch
section of the rare Chonta palm from Juan Fernandez Island off the
coast of Chili, obtained by Dr. W. L. Schmitt. Prof. T. Jonson, of
the Royal Swedish Forestry School, Stockholm, contributed a fine
trunk section of European white birch from the demonstration forest
of the College of Forestry at Garpenberg, Province of Dalarne,
Sweden. In exchange for a study sample of Ginkgo wood sent to
him in August 1932, F. K. Dalton sent a piece of the wood of kaika-
waka, or New Zealand cedar, which burns very slowly and is used
locally for fire doors and similar purposes. <A piece of German oak
cut from a dugout built on the Elbe between 800 and 900 A.D., and
attesting the great durability of this species, was received from R. D.
Hess as an exchange.

A collection of homeopathic pharmaceutical preparations, from
Boericke & Tafel, arranged to illustrate the history and principles of
homeopathy, was the largest gift received by the division of medicine
during the year. The specimens included consist of pharmaceuticals
of all kinds from the animal, mineral, and vegetable kingdoms.
The division is indebted to Dr. F. B. Kilmer, of Johnson & Johnson,
for the contribution of type specimens of the earliest antiseptic sur-
gical dressings made on a commercial scale in the United States.
The first type, carbolated gauze, introduced the new Listerian sys-
tem of antiseptic dressings. The others illustrate improved forms
of dressings with corrosive sublimate and boric acid as the medicinal
agents.

The pharmacy collection was improved by the addition of con-
siderable material, including a druggist’s mortar contributed by
Magnus, Mabee & Reynard, and a series of six photographic en-
largements of murals depicting the progress of pharmacy, a gift of
the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science.

Accessions for the materia medica section included a gift of a set
of photographs especially prepared by Eli Lilly & Co. to illustrate
steps in the manufacture of insulin; a contribution of Merck & Co.
of a series of cinchona alkaloids and alkaloidal salts; and donations
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 120

of crude drugs by the United States Department of Agriculture,
R. Hilber’s Son Corporation, J. L. Hopkins & Co., S. B. Penick &
Co., Peek & Velsor, and Johnson & Johnson.

Additions to the section of public health were: A group of models
and a panel transferred from the United States Children’s Bureau;
a partial set of specially prepared placards and a series of strip films
received from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.; and additional
colored transparencies donated by the American Hospital Association.

Graphic arts.—The 51 accessions, 4 more than last year, totaled 1,433
specimens, of which the gifts, purchases, transfers, and deposits made
a permanent addition to the collections of 482 specimens. The most
important accession was 200 old etchings collected by J. Kay,
London, in 1826. The lot contains prints by such famous artists as
Rembrandt, Claude, Hollar, Cornelius, Bego, and Castiglione, and
many by lesser artists, quite a few of which are of much better
quality than those by the more famous etchers. Etchings and dry-
points by American artists were received from Joseph C. Claghorn,
Mrs. Sybilla M. Weber, and Robert Lawson.

In connection with the new installation of the photomechanical
and substitute processes, the following accessions were obtained:
Photographs of the inventors Frederic E. Ives, Max Levy, Louis
E. Levy, and Karl Kletsch; 36 prints made by the Photogravure
and Color Co., of New York, from 3 old photomechanical plates
etched about 1860 by Fox Talbot. The Meriden Gravure Co. gave
18 specimens of their work in collotype, and 5 specimens of excellent
European work were purchased and incorporated in the exhibit.
The Laboratory Press of Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pitts-
burgh, presented 7 examples of the work being done in the school
of printing, and 2 large highlight water-marked samples of paper
were the gift of the Japan Paper Co.

Of the 26 accessions received by the section of photography during
the year, the most important and valued was the gift of Mary O.
Petrocelli, Brooklyn, N.Y., of 86 beautiful bromoil and resinotypia
prints made by her late husband, Joseph Petrocelli, between 1921
and 1928. They are all suitably and effectively framed, and were
presented in the hope that they would stimulate a desire to carry
on this type of work, of which Mr. Petrocelli was a master.

An important addition to the motion-picture exhibit was a com-
plete early Edison projection kinetoscope acquired from John P.
Daniels, Crisfield, Md.

Three burnishers used by the late John F. Jarvis, Washington,
D.C., the gift of Mr. Jarvis’ daughters, Mrs. Mae I. English and
Mrs. L. F. Speich, illustrate the development of this once useful
article in photography. M. Schneckenberger, chief photographer
for the Buffalo Museum of Science, Buffalo, N.Y., loaned two im-
126 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

portant cameras, one a Kodak No. 210 and the other an E. & H.
T. Anthony No. 1025. Dr. Robert Taft gave a portrait of Hamilton
H. Smith, the inventor of the tintype, which is a copy of a self-por-
trait (1889) printed on platinum paper of Smith’s preparation.

A 35-mm moving-picture film, the gift of Geophysiches Institut,
Prague, illustrates the copying of books in this compact form, each
page being copied on one frame and projected onto a screen for
study. Libraries are using this method to copy rare old books, thus
to preserve the originals and make them available for others.
Another film acquired from the Universal Talking Newsreel, New
York, illustrates the method of locomotion of a walrus in the San
Diego Zoo.

Mrs. Hazel Englebrecht, Des Moines, Iowa, specialist in X-ray
photography, presented to the section 2 photographs of flowers
and 9 negatives of various assorted subjects. DeLancey Gill,
Alexandria, Va., for many years illustrator of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology, upon his retirement on June 30, 1932, gave the col-
lection a Thornton Pickard shutter, a Triplex shutter, an old focusing
glass, and a Watkins meter. Eugene Augustin Lauste, Bloomfield,
N.J., ploneer inventor of sound and sight motion pictures, presented
22 photographic copies of his early inventions. Ida F. Arnold,
Canton, Mass., presented a collection of 4 daguerreotypes, 4 ambro-
types, 2 tintypes, and 1 cabinet portrait.

Loeb collection of chemical types—Miss Aida M. Doyle, of the
section of organic chemistry, devoted 2 days a week to the Loeb
collection of chemical types under the head curator’s direction, and
by the close of the year had made satisfactory progress toward com-
pleting a technical catalog of the collection, which now numbers
1,336 specimens.

INSTALLATION AND PRESERVATION OF COLLECTIONS

Engineering.—In the section of aeronautics the erection of the
gondola and part of the envelop of the airship Pilgrim was the larg-
est new installation. In addition, the collection of kites was in-
stalled in metal swinging frames and a complete series of illustrations
portraying the evolution of the parachute was added. In mechani-
cal technology the most popular new arrangement was the addition
of a horse, harness, and liveried driver to the hansom cab presented
last year by Mrs. James Parmelee. Mrs. Parmelee donated a nicely
carved wooden horse, the original harness, and the driver’s livery.
The large tower-clock movement presented last year by the city of
Frederick, Md., was installed at the level of the ‘‘clock gallery” on
the top of a steel tower erected from the main floor, and will be
operated during the coming year. The glass and metallurgy exhibits
of the section of mineral technology were completely rearranged.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 127

An attractive exhibit portraying the early work of Joseph Wharton
in the development of nickel refining and manufacturing processes
was installed.

Textiles, organic chemistry, wood technology, foods, and medicine.—In
all, 35 installations of new material and 13 rearrangements or rein-
stallations of specimens received in previous years were made in the
textile halls. In the section of organic chemistry 17 exhibits were
dismantled and revised, replacing some specimens with new material
of more recent manufacture. Three new installations were made in
the section of foods. A new colony of bees was installed in the obser-
vation hive in the spring, the bees in the old colony having nearly all
perished in the previous cold winter.

In wood technology a new cork exhibit was installed from material
contributed by the Armstrong Cork Co., the walnut airplane pro-
peller and accompanying parts, received in 1917 from the American
Propeller & Manufacturing Co., were rearranged; and parts of the
exhibit of the Hammermill Paper Co., illustrating the manufacture
and use of sulphite wood pulp for writing papers, were revised. This
year 203 woods were received, primarily for the study collection. Of
these, 65 were of such size that they could be placed in the regular
drawers with little or no cutting, 133 were cut to size and all duplicates
put in storage, while 5 await seasoning. A total of 308 hand samples
were prepared for the study collection, 2,087 duplicates for distribu-
tion and exchange, and 318 thin sections were made for the division
of plants.

Important among the new or improved installations in the division
of medicine are models illustrating various phases of child welfare;
exhibits devoted to the portraying of general hygiene, preventive
medicine, and vital statistics; the Arabian period of medical history;
the history of pharmacy; the evolution of pharmacopoeias, dispensa-
tories, and formularies; and improved insulin, surgical dressings, and
crude drug exhibits.

Graphic arts —Besides conducting 8 special exhibitions, the mem-
bers of the staff of the division of graphic arts devoted 4% months to
the arrangement and installation of the photomechanical prints.
Many of the early specimens are rare, and to insure their careful
preservation they were covered with glass and bound with passe
partout. This method, once started, made it necessary to cover all
specimens in order to make the exhibition uniform. Nearly all the
old material and much new was rematted and covered with glass.

INVESTIGATION AND RESEARCH

Dr. F. L. Lewton, curator of textiles, continued his botanical
studies of certain undescribed plants related to the cottons; the
assistant curator of wood technology, W. N. Watkins, carried on
128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

investigations of the utility of certain tropical Florida woods and
gave special study to the anatomy of other species of woods; the
assistant curator of medicine, Dr. Charles Whitebread, pursued his
studies of Arabian medicine and the history of pharmacy; R. P.
Tolman, curator of graphic arts, devoted some time to further re-
search on the artist Malbone; and the assistant curator of engineering,
Paul E. Garber, found time to give to his researches in aeronautical
history.

Many individuals and industrial organizations made use of the
department’s collections during the year, some in connection with
their studies on various phases of industrial and technologic history
and transportation, involving in some cases the comparison of speci-
mens in the collections with privately-owned objects, and others in
connection with the preparation of historicai exhibits for the Century
of Progress Exposition in Chicago. Assistance of this sort was
rendered also to a number of Federal agencies, including the United
States Shipping Board, the Bureau of Public Roads, the Bureau of
Navigation and Steamboat Inspection, and the Aeronautics Branch
of the Department of Commerce. Much time too was required to
comply with requests for the identification of specimens brought or
sent in by individuals and Federal bureaus. Such assistance in-
cluded identification of woods fur the United States Bureau of Plant
Industry, the National Committee on Wood Utilization, the Bureau
of Standards, and the Bureau of American Ethnology. Seeds of
foreign cottons were identified for the Division of Foreign Plant
Introduction and rare drugs for the Division of Botany, United States
Bureau of Plant Industry. In addition, many lots of material, such
as paintings, sculpture, ship models, tools, textile fabrics, machinery,
electrical and mechanical equipment, watches and clocks, and
scientific apparatus, were identified and appraised.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE OF SPECIMENS

The distributions from the department of arts and industries during
the year aggregated 2,091 specimens, of which 39 were gifts in aid of
education, 8 exchanges for material which has or will be received, and
1,595 loans for educational or research purposes. Also 449 specimens
that had been temporarily in the department were returned to their
owners.

REPORT ON THE DIVISION OF HISTORY

(TuHEoporE T. Bretotre, Curator)

In 1921 the division of history was removed from the department of
anthropology and placed as a separate unit under the department of
arts and industries, its report since 1925 for convenience having been
combined with that of that department. With a reorganization
during the present year, the division of history now renders a separate
account of its activities.

The historical collections have been divided into the following
units: Art, antiquarian, costume, military, naval, numismatic, and
philatelic. ‘These terms refer to the intrinsic character of the histor-
ical materials and indicate categories for the classification, installa-
tion, preservation, and future development of the immense mass of
objects of various types now in the care of the division. The arrange-
ment of the material in each of these groups has been greatly facili-
tated during recent years by the assignment of suitable exhibition and
storage space in the Arts and Industries Building for the entire
historical collections. Much of the time of the historical staff has
been occupied with transferring materials from the Natural History
Building to the Arts and Industries Building, but the rearrangement
of all this material has not yet been completed.

ACCESSIONS FOR THE YEAR

Additions to the collections during the year were smaller in numbers
than in recent years, chiefly because of lack of exhibition and storage
space for new specimens of bulky size, the necessity of depending upon
gifts for material that has become comparatively scarce and valuable,
and the adoption of a high standard for material accepted. Speci-
mens added numbered 5,537, or 519 less than for the previous year.

In the antiquarian collections several objects of special interest
were added. One of these is a small compass in a Jeather case which
was carried by William Clark during the Lewis and Clark expedition
to the Pacific coast, 1804-6, and presented by Miss Mary McCabe.
Another is a silver vase given to Maj. Gen. Silas Casey, when captain
of the Second Infantry, United States Army, in recognition of his
services during the War with Mexico. It was lent to the Museum by
Miss Sophie Pearce Casey. Seven pieces of chinaware owned during
the early part of the nineteenth century by President James Madison

130
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 131

were presented by John H. Gray. Mrs. Daniel Gardner added 77
specimens of china, glass, and miscellaneous tableware to the anti-
quarian material presented by her in 1931.

An interesting collection of feminine wearing apparel of the latter
part of the nineteenth century was donated by Mrs. Gertrude O. S.
Cleveland. A frock coat and vest worn by William McKinley, prior
to his election as President of the United States in 1896, were presented
by George A. Troll.

A United States flag carried on the boat Emma Dean by Maj. J. W.
Powell and his party during their exploring expedition down the
Green and Colorado Rivers, 1871-72, was presented by Frederick S.
Dellenbaugh.

Two military belt buckles of more than the usual historical impor-
tance were received. One of these, presented by Virginia B. Lewis
and Emily B. Leaf, was owned during the War of 1812 by Maj. Gen.
Jacob Brown. The other, a gift of B. F. O’Rourke, was worn by
Thomas O’ Rourke, Company E, Highty-eighth New York Volunteers,
during the Battle of Cold Harbor, Va., and bears on its surface a rifle
bullet that was embedded in it during that engagement. The military
collection was also increased by a saber carried during the Civil War
by Lt. Thomas D. Jellico, One hundred and sixty-ninth New York
Volunteer Infantry, presented by Mrs. Clara Jellico Bevers, and by a
Spanish carbine and sword of the period of the Spanish-American
War, presented by Mrs. Arthur Foraker. The Polish Government
presented a series of uniforms and accessories of types now used in
the Polish Army.

A number of relics of unusual historical interest relating to the
career of Commodore Thomas Macdonough, added to the naval
collection, include a gold watch owned by him; a silver pitcher and
six goblets presented to him by the citizens of Lansingburg, N.Y., in
commemoration of his victory on Lake Champlain, September 11,
1814; and a handsome gold-mounted sword, a scabbard, and belt
presented to him by the crew of the U.S.S. Guerriere, July 8, 1819.
These items were lent by Rodney Macdonough. A naval sword,
received as a gift from Mrs. J. A. Starkweather, was owned during the
early part of the nineteenth century by Dr. Thomas Williamson,
United States Navy.

Among the additions to the numismatic collection was a Portuguese
half-dobra gold piece struck in Brazil in 1761, presented by Phillip
Elting. From the International Nickel Co. came a collection of 48
nickel coins illustrating the types of coins of this metal now circulating
in Albania, Austria, Belgium, Ecuador, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Morocco,
Poland, Siam, Switzerland, Turkey, and Vatican City. The United
States Mint transferred two examples each of the gold, silver, and

72774—35——10
132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

bronze coins struck in the Denver, Philadelphia, and San Francisco
Mints during 1932.

Two bronze copies of the medal of award of the United States
George Washington Bicentennial Commission, 1932, were presented
by the commission. The directors of the French Mint presented an
exceptionally artistic medal commemorating the tercentennial anni-
versary of the birth of Benedict Spinoza. A special collection of 186
British medals commemorating the exploits of Admiral Edward Ver-
non, R.N., during his expedition against the Spanish possessions in
the Caribbean Sea, 1739-41, was lent for temporary exhibition by
L. McCormick-Goodhart.

A number of additions were made to the collection of military deco-
rations. From the War Department came two examples of the
recently reestablished United States military decoration, the Purple
Heart. From the New Mexico National Guard, through Maj. Fred-
erick R. Lafferty, the Museum received two examples of the long-
service medal and drill-attendance medal of the type awarded to
members of that guard. Six military decorations and six exquisitely
executed miniatures of these decorations, all owned during the World
War by Maj. Gen. George M. Burr, were presented by Mrs. Lydia
K. Burr.

The philatelic collections were increased by 3,971 specimens received
from the Post Office Department, including examples of many United
States and foreign commemorative stamps of more than the usual
historical interest.

INSTALLATION AND PRESERVATION OF COLLECTIONS

The transfer of historical materials from the Natural History
Building to the Arts and Industries Building has complicated the
problem of adequate space and furniture, but the arrangement has
been greatly improved by the transfer. The art material has offered
the greatest difficulties, as it is difficult to arrange busts, portraits, and
historic scenes in a satisfactory manner owing to the architectural
features of the walls of the building. Part of the collection of busts is
shown on the tops of wall cases.

The only series of paintings now shown with entire success is the
Ferris collection of American historical subjects for which special
alcoves were provided 2 years ago. This collection makes a splendid
showing and harmonizes well with the costumes material exhibited in
the same hall.

The antiquarian material has been united and now includes a fine
series of china, glass, silverware, and furniture relating to the develop-
ment of the American home from about 1750 to 1850. The pieces of
greatest importance are those associated with noted personages of
American history, and material of this character is given the most
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: NATIONAL MUSEUM 133

prominent location in the exhibition scheme. ‘This section includes
materials owned by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander
Hamilton, James Madison, and many other important figures in
American history.

An exhibit of unusual historical interest installed during the year
included examples of coins, tokens, and paper currency issued by
local and State authorities and by private individuals and commer-
cial firms in the United States from the Colonial period to the present
time. Of equal importance are many examples of metal currency
known as “tokens” that were produced in the United States during
the financial panic of 1837 and during the Civil War. This special
exhibit also included coins and currency made during the period of
the Confederation prior to the establishment of the United States
Mint and the first issue by that establishment of the official series of
United States coins, which began in 1793.

The value of the philatelic material for exhibition purposes was
greatly increased by the installation of a special series of electric
fixtures, which not only light the cabinets but also the nearby wall
cases containing the Richard Mansfield collection of historical
theatrical costumes.

NUMBER OF SPECIMENS UNDER DIVISION

During the past year 5,537 specimens were received and 227 speci-
mens were returned to the owners. The number of specimens
included in each of the classes of materials assigned to the division is
given below. The library material, which includes documents
and publications of historical interest, has received few additions in
recent years, as material of this character is no longer included in
the field of work of the division.

FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Harly in 1906, by deed of gift, Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, gave to
the Institution his collection of Chinese and other oriental objects of
art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art by Whistler,
Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also gave funds for the
construction of a building to house the collection, and finally, in his
will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock and securities to
the estimated value of $1,958,591.42 as an endowment fund for the
operation of the gallery. From the above date to the present time
these funds have been increased by stock dividends, savings of income,
etc., to a total of $4,736,907.59. In view of the importance and
special nature of the gift and the requirements of the testator in
respect to it, all Freer funds are kept separate from the other funds
of the Institution, and the accounting in respect to them is stated
separately.

The invested funds of the Freer bequest are classified as follows:

The Institution gratefully acknowledges gifts or bequests from
the following:

Dr. Adolph M. Hanson, income from certain royalties for conducting scientific
work of the Institution.

Mr. Eldridge R. Johnson, for deep-sea and other oceanographic explorations.

Research Corporation, for further contributions for researches in radiation.

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 19338

ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Grenrrat Arpenprx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific
discovery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such
papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific
progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely
the prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy,
geology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zool-
ogy, and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not
altogether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them origi-
nal) embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and
discussion. This method has been continued in the present report
for 1933.

HOW THE SUN WARMS THE EARTH *

By C. G. ABBor
Secretary, Smithsonian Institution

[With 6 plates]

James Arthur in 1931 bequeathed a considerable sum to the Smith-
sonian Institution for the study of the sun. A condition of the gift
directed that each year a lecture should be given on some phase of
our knowledge of the sun either by a member of the Institution’s
staff or by some other competent person. The first Arthur lecture
was given 2 years ago by Dr. Henry Norris Russell, who discussed
the sun’s chemical and physical composition. Last year, Dr. Ernest
William Brown, in the second Arthur lecture, treated of the sun’s
gravitational control of the solar system. In this third Arthur lec-
ture I propose to give some account of the sun’s radiation, whereby
the earth is kept at a habitable temperature.

HEAT EXCHANGE BY RADIATION

Experiment: Here I have a lamp which I can heat more and
more by electric current until, as you see, it glows brightly. At the
other side of the stage, too far away for direct heating by the lamp,
is a concave mirror which forms an image of the lamp upon a sen-

b

FIGURE 1.—Heat exchange by radiation.

The lamp, a, heated by electricity, sends rays to the concave mirror, b, which focuses
them on the thermopile, c, whose warming is indicated by the galvanometer, d.

sitive electrical thermometer called a thermopile (fig 1). That you
may all observe its behavior, I record the indications of the elec-
trical thermometer on the screen. Please observe this little spot of

light upon the scale of the instrument. Now I warm the lamp as
before. See the spot of light move. To convince you that rays from
the warmed lamp are actually crossing the stage and warming the
electrical thermometer by being focused upon it, I insert this card
so as to hide the lamp from the focusing mirror. The spot of light
immediately falls back. I remove the card. It leaps forward. All
chis time the lamp, though warmed, has been too cool to glow. But
now I heat it to a glowing temperature, as you see. Note how very
much wider now is the swing of the recording light spot as again
I insert the card.

RAYS MAY TRAVEL IN A VACUUM

Thus we see that not only visible rays from very hot sources, but
invisible rays from bodies too cool to glow, are able to cross wide
spaces and to produce heat when they are absorbed by blackened
receiving surfaces like that of this electrical thermometer. In our
experiment the space traversed by the rays was filled with air. That
was a hindrance, not a help, to the passage of these rays. They will
cross a vacuum even more freely than they will pass through air.
When we say that a radio program is “on the air”, it is true that
the air fills the space between the broadcaster and the listener, but
it is not the air that carries the waves. Just as sunlight comes to
us across a 92,000,000-mile vacuum, radio rays can also travel in
vacuum. They do not employ the air for their conveyance. The
nature of the medium that carries light and radio rays is still
obscure, but we know that it is not the air.

THE SUN IS THE EARTH’S HEAT SOURCE

The sun’s rays are almost the sole source of the heat that warms
our earth. They cross the void of space to us just as the rays from
the lamp crossed this stage. It requires 8 minutes for the sun’s rays
to reach the earth, traveling 186,000 miles each second. We noted
that the electrical thermometer, when radiated upon by the hot lamp,
warmed up to a certain degree of temperature and then stayed con-
stant. The earth, wherever the sun’s rays strike it, also tends to
warm up. Its temperature would stay constant as the thermopile
did when thus warmed, if conditions on the earth remained un-
changed. But clouds may form and obscure the sun, dust or smoke
frequently intervenes and, most important of all, the earth rotates
a complete turn every day. No spot on earth stays fixed underneath
the sun beam long enough to come to a constant temperature. The
earth is about 8,000 miles in diameter, and 25,000 miles in circum-
ference. Hence at the equator its surface passes under the solar
beam about 1,000 miles each hour.

INFLUENCE OF OBLIQUITY
The effect of sun rays in producing heat must always depend on
the obliquity of the receiving surface to the rays received. Figure 2
illustrates this point. The rays whose front have the width ab must

evidently produce a greater intensity of heating effect on the sur-
face ed at right angles to the beam than on the surfaces ef or gh,
where the same amount of radiation is spread over large areas. Ex-
periment: I can illustrate this readily. (See fig. 1.) Note how the
warmth of the thermopile, as measured on the screen, diminishes
when I rotate it gradually from being at right angles until it reaches
parallelism with the rays it receives from the heated lamp. Let us
apply this principle of response to obliquity to our thought of the
warming of the earth by sun rays. We see, as in figure 3, that

ett ee

FicurRE 3.—Solar heating of the earth influenced by obliquity.

the intensity of the solar heating is greatest at noon and greatest in
summer, because at these times the obliquity is least. This is the
reason why, in the United States, July is warmer than January,
even though the sun is 3,000,000 miles farther away in July than it
is in January. Returning to consideration of the effect of rapid ro-
tation in preventing the surface of the earth from attaining con-
stancy of temperature under solar heating, we now see that, owing
to change of obliquity of solar rays, the intensity of the earth’s
heating continually changes from morning to night. Darting along
at 1,000 miles per hour, three times as fast as a racing airplane, the
earth’s surface never has time to reach a constant temperature under
solar heating.

COMPARISON OF THE SOLAR HEATING OF THE EARTH AND THE
MOON

On the moon things do not change so rapidly. The moon has no
atmosphere, hence no clouds, smoke, or dust. (See pl. 1.) Instead
of rotating in 24 hours like our earth, the moon rotates only once in
274%, days. Being little more than 2,000 miles in diameter, its cir-
cumference is less than 7,000 miles. Hence the moon’s surface passes
under the sun’s rays only about 10 miles per hour. Thus there is
opportunity for the moon’s illuminated surface to warm up to a
practically constant temperature. At the center of the moon’s bright
face its temperature is found to be 250° F., which is about 40° F.
above that of boiling water. Compare this with the earth. Even at
the Equator there are few stations where the weather records report
temperatures above 112° F., which is 100° below the boiling tem-
perature. This is the case even though the sun sends rays equally
as intense to the earth as to the moon. The difference in maximum
temperatures reached by the two bodies depends partly on the rapid
rotation of the earth and partly on its possession of an atmosphere.

ATMOSPHERIC INFLUENCE ON PLANETARY TEMPERATURE

Not only do clouds, dust, and smoke produce their effects, but our
atmosphere is a sort of ray trap. On cloudless days, sun rays can
pass through it readily. They lose only about one-fourth of their
heat before reaching the earth. It is not so with the long-wave
rays sent outwards by our earth’s surface. About three-fourths of
them are restrained by the atmosphere. Hence, like a blanket upon
a sleeper, the atmosphere must itself be warmed through before the
earth’s heat given up to the atmosphere by long-wave radiation and
by contact can escape to space. With such an effective blanket keep-
ing the earth warm, it is not surprising that at night, when the
solar heating is all cut off, the earth’s temperature does not fall as
much as that of the moon. Those who have been on high moun-
tains, or in parched deserts, where the atmospheric blanket is so
dry as to be less efficient than it is here in the East, know how much
more and how much quicker the night air cools than it does near
the sea. Indeed, one shivers even in daytime on a high desert
mountain the moment he steps into the shade. The following fig-
ures [a slide on the screen] exhibit this phenomenon for two places
of nearly the same latitude near the Equator and for the moon.

IMMENSITY OF SOLAR RADIATION

I despair of giving you a vivid idea of the immensity of the sun’s
heat and of the quantity of energy it continually emits. Experi-
ment: I turn on for an instant a 1,000-candlepower Mazda lamp.
It seems blindingly bright. But the sun’s surface for equal areas
emits about five times as blinding a beam as this lamp does, and the
area of the sun’s surface is about 8 billions of trillions (8X10?)
times that of the lamp filament. Plateau, a Belgian physicist,
wished to study the after images left within his eyes by a bright
hight. Looking steadily at the sun for 20 seconds, he lost his sight
completely.

Dr. 8. P. Langley describes how he made an experiment to com-
pare the rays of the molten steel poured from the Bessemer con-
verter with those of the sun. Into the enormous converter pot there
streamed first some 15,000 pounds of molten iron loaded with half a
ton of silicon and carbon. Then a blast of air was forced up
through the glowing mass, and the chemical action set up a heat
which so far surpassed mere iron-melting temperature that when
another 15,000 pounds of molten iron was added it looked like choco-
late poured into a white cup. The cataract of liquid steel was then
discharged, shooting showers of scintillations that seemed sunlike
in their brillancy, and spattering the surroundings for a hundred
feet with little shooting stars. But there was nothing really sun-
like at all in this fierce glare. For when Langley exposed an appa-
ratus which took a balance between the brightness of the surface of
the steel and an equal surface of the sun, the sun was found to send
out at least 87 times as intense radiation, square foot against square
foot, as the dazzling steel. This applies to the total rays, whether
visible to the eye or not. But for the light rays only, the sun
proved intrinsically not less than 5,000 times the stronger source.
And this was near Pittsburgh, where the sun’s rays had already
lost over half their intensity in the murk of the atmosphere.

SUN RAYS EMITTED IN ALL DIRECTIONS

Some people, possibly of Scotch ancestry, reluctant to contem-
plate a pitiable waste of good things, have supposed that the sun
does not send its rays in every direction, but only in those directions
where there lie objects to be shined upon, such as the earth or the
planets. This is not true. The sun shines nearly equally in every
direction, and for aught we know the rays it is sending out at this
instant, if they hit nothing, may go on and on for a million years
or even forever, covering 186,000 miles on their journey every single
second that they travel. This thesis is proved by the observed fact
that the intensity of the sun’s rays falls off as the square of its dis-
154 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

tance increases. Our experiments have proved it by observing the
change in solar radiation intensity between perihelion and aphelion
of the earth.

TOTAL OUTPUT OF SOLAR RADIATION

How much energy does the sun lose in this prodigal way? Every
year it loses heat equivalent to 400 billions of trillions (4X10?) of
tons of anthracite coal. Of this prodigious amount the earth inter-
cepts the equivalent of 200 trillions of tons. Compared merely with
the small part of solar radiation intercepted by the earth, the total
yearly consumption of coal for heat, light, and power in the United
States is trifling—only 500 millions of tons.

SOLAR POWER

This leads to the inquiry why we depend on coal, oil, and waterfalls
for power, when the sun is furnishing to the earth so incomparably
much more energy free, gratis, for nothing. There are two reasons.
First, clouds and night interrupt the continuity of the supply, and
cut it off just at those times when we most need power. Even dur-
ing the day the rays alter very much in their intensity because they
shine through great thicknesses of the atmosphere in the early morn-
ing and the late afternoon. Night also varies greatly in length be-
tween summer and winter in temperate zones where the most power
is used. Unfortunately, night is longest in winter, when we need
most power. Second, though sun rays cost nothing to produce, they
cost much to capture. If their energy could be fully utilized it would
require only about a square yard for 1 horsepower. But the losses
unavoidable in using sun rays for power will demand provision of
at least 4 and probably 10 square yards per horsepower. In fact, no
solar-power plants thus far have reached such efficiency. To install
apparatus over 10,000 square yards to obtain 1,000 horsepower, or
over 10,000,000 square yards to match Niagara may well give
engineers pause.

Nevertheless, solar power may not be hopeless. Two of the most
successful solar-power installations made thus far are those of
Boyle and Willsie? at Needles, Calif., about 1908, and that of the
Sun Power Co. (Eastern Hemisphere) Ltd., at Meadi, near Cairo, in
Egypt, in the year 1918. These two installations illustrate two con-
trasting types. In the first the inventors avoided expensive equip-
ment by contenting themselves with a small temperature rise and
therefore with low efficiency. The heater consisted of a shallow
wooden basin coated with asphalt and divided by strips into troughs.
It was covered by layers of window glass and insulated at the sides

HOW THE SUN WARMS THE EARTH—ABBOT 155

and bottom by double air spaces. Each trough of the heater formed
a compartment. (The following six paragraphs are taken from the
paper cited in footnote 2.)

The heater in the fourth plant was in two sections, separated by a
footpath. The first section was covered by one layer of glass and
the second section with two layers. Both sections were inclined. The

hot water gives up its heat in the vaporizer V and

heat-collecting liquid ran from the first section into the second sec-
tion, at a temperature of about 150° F., and from the second section
into the storage tank at about 180° F. These temperatures varied
with the time of day, wind, cloudiness, and other weather conditions,
and especially with the amount of liquid flowing through the heater.

The solar-heated water was stored in a tank, insulated to prevent
the loss of heat by radiation. The heated water was then drawn
uniformly and continuously from the storage tank and made to give
156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

up its heat by circulating it about a boiler or heat exchanger con-
taining some volatile liquid, such as ammonia or sulphur dioxide.
The vapor generated by this heat, after operating an engine, was
condensed and returned to the boiler to be used again. The water,
after giving up its heat to the sulphur dioxide, was sent out through
the solar heater to collect again the heat in the sun’s rays. Theo-
retically, the plan meets all the requirements for the transformation
of solar heat into continuous, uniform power (fig. 4).

The sulphur dioxide engine used in this experiment was a vertical
automatic cut-off, which at times, with a boiler pressure of 215
pounds, probably developed 15 horsepower. ‘The two heater sections
exposed an area of about 1,000 square feet to the sun, but as the heat
was taken from storage and not directly from the heater, it is not
fair to assume the above proportion of heater surface to horsepower
developed.

The condenser consisted of 6 stacks of horizontal pipes, 12 pipes
to the stack. The cooling water, pumped from a well 48 feet deep,
had a temperature of 75° F. Only enough water was allowed to drip
over the pipes to keep them wet, and so great was the evaporation
in the dry desert breeze that the cooling water left the lower pipes
at 64°. By using the cooling water over and over, the condenser
gave very satisfactory results. A shade of arrow weed, a straight
willowlike shrub abundant along the Colorado River, kept the sun-
shine from the condenser pipes and permitted a good air circulation.

At times the storage valve would be opened after dark, allowing
the solar-heated liquid to flow over the exchanger pipes and thus
start up the engine. Up to the year 1910 this was probably the first
sun-power plant that was ever operated at night with solar heat col-
lected during the day, and it came nearer than any other plant to
the commercial utilization of solar heat for power purposes; it was
also the largest sun-power plant of which there was any record.

From the foregoing, the cost of installing a sun-power plant may
be estimated :

At that time the costs of steam-power plants were said to range
from $40 to $90 per horsepower. The cost of a Willsie sun-power
plant was accordingly from two to four times that of a steam plant,
HOW THE SUN WARMS THE EARTH—ABBOT 157

and the interest and depreciation on this excess of cost would offset
in some measure the saving of fuel.

In the Egyptian solar-power plant (pl. 2), fairly high tempera-
tures and fairly high efficiency were obtained by concentrating solar
rays by a battery of cylindric mirrors onto a system of connecting
boiler tubes. In order to follow the sun’s daily march through the
heavens, the mirrors were rotated from east to west each day at such
a rate as to keep the sun rays in focus upon the boiler tubes. The
total area of sunshine collected was 13,269 square feet. Each chan-
nel-shaped reflector and its boiler was 205 feet long, and there were
five such sections placed side by side. The concentration was 414
to 1. The maximum quantity of steam produced was 12 pounds per
100 square feet of sunshine, equivalent to 183 square feet per brake
horsepower, and the maximum thermal efficiency was 40.1 percent.
On August 22, 1913, the average power for the 5 hour’s run was
59.4 brake horsepower per acre, and the maximum and minimum
power on that day were 63 and 52.4 brake horsepower per acre,
respectively.

The engineer, Mr. Ackermann, remarks:

The problem of the utilization of solar energy is well worthy of the atten-
tion of engineers, for even now it is very nearly a solved problem where there
is plenty of sunshine and coal costs £3 10s. a ton. It is fortunate that where
coal is dear, sunshine is often plentiful, and it is to be remembered that coal
will gradually get dearer while the cost of manufacture of sun-power plants
should decrease. Sun-power plants are admirably suitable for pumping in
connection with irrigation, for where there is most sunshine there is need for
most irrigation, and the slight variation in the quantity of water pumped
throughout the day does not matter. Also, when temporarily there is no sun-
shine (due to clouds), probably little or no irrigation is required.

A SOLAR COOKER

I have myself dabbled in the enticing solar-power field. As an
introductory experiment I designed and constructed a solar cooker
on Mount Wilson, Calif. In my experiments I desired to store the
heat in a suitable reservoir at such a temperature as would permit
all the usual cooking operations, such as stewing, preserving, boiling
and baking of meats, and even including the baking of bread, to be
carried on for some time after the cutting off of sunlight.

As the most convenient way to combine a solar-heat collector with
a suitable high-temperature reservoir, it seemed best to concentrate
the solar rays upon a metal tube communicating to a reservoir at
some distance above the collector. The scheme is exactly that of a
household water heater, merely substituting concentrated sun rays
for a fire as the source of heat. In this way, the hot fluid, expanding,
rises by the differential action of gravity into the top of the reser-
158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

voir, while the cooler fluid at the bottom of it flows downward to
the heat source in replacement. A continuous circulation of hot fluid
would thus maintain the temperature of the reservoir. Water, the
cheapest liquid, could not be used in the cooker unless under such
pressure as would introduce a costly and dangerous element. Tem-
peratures approaching 200° C. were desired, and if water were used,
steam pressures of nearly 15 atmospheres would prevail. Instead of
water, therefore, engine-cylinder oil was preferred. This fluid can
be heated to temperatures somewhat above 200° C. without boiling,
flashing, or strongly evaporating.

I chose the cylindrical reflector of parabolic cross-section for the
purpose of collecting and focusing the solar rays. A cylindrical
reflector does not require, like a conical one, motions about two axes
in order to follow the sun. If the cylindrical mirror is mounted
upon an axis parallel to the earth’s axis, a rotation from east toward
west at the same rate as the earth’s daily rotation from west toward
east is all that is required. To be sure, the full, aperture of the
mirror is attained only at the dates of the equinoxes. Yet if the
mirror is made rather long from north to south, compared to its
width from east to west, this loss is trifling, even in June and
December.

The mirror is made 1214 feet long and 714 feet wide, and is
mounted with its long dimension parallel to an axis pointing toward
the North Star. For rigidity and cheapness the mirror was framed
on five sections of structural steel.

But how should it become a brightly reflecting mirror? This was
accomplished by using sheets of glossy rolled aluminum, thick enough
to preserve their shape when screwed to the steel. They added
very little to the weight of the mirror and were found to reflect
about 75 percent of the total solar radiation. Experience shows
that aluminum sheets retain their highly reflecting surface for
several years if kept dry. Later “Allegheny metal”, or stainless
steel, was used.

Having thus made a light, rigid, parabolic cylindrical mirror, the
next care was to mount it free to turn about an axis parallel to the
earth’s. It was necessary to provide a driving mechanism to cause
the mirror to follow the apparent daily march of the sun from east
to west. Much expense might have been lavished on this part, for
the combination of an astronomical driving clock and worm-and-
wheel mechanism, usually employed by astronomers to drive tele-
scopes of a similar size, often costs hundreds of dollars. A very
inexpensive device was used for the mirror of the cooker. <A little
alarm clock was made master of the situation. It gave a signal
which at each 5 minutes allowed the machinery to run. The ma-
chinery ran a little too fast, and after a short run was held back
HOW THE SUN WARMS THE EARTH—ABBOT 159

for about a minute, awaiting the next pleasure of the little master
clock. The whole driving outfit required an outlay of about $15
and 3 days’ work. It has operated perfectly satisfactorily for about
8 hours a day through several summers.

The reservoir, 20 by 24 by 36 inches, was made of steel, with
welded corners. Two ovens, each 9 by 11 by 1614 inches, were let
in at the back. The reservoir stands on a platform about 6 feet
above the top end of the mirror. To conduct the heated oil, there
is a copper pipe 114 inches in diameter, bent so as to pass from the
reservoir down under the mirror, returning in the focus of the sun
rays through the hollow trunnions.

The reservoir and pipes are protected from loss of heat by brick-
work composed of diatomaceous earth. Such bricks are known by
the trade name “ silocel.” Only substances lke cotton and silk-fluff
are less conducting, and their insulating advantage over the bricks
is very slight. As these bricks are perfectly fireproof, they are
highly suitable for use around an oil reservoir, heated nearly to
the limit of safe oil temperatures.

It remains to speak of the coverings of the mirror, and of the
heater tube within it. In order to avoid cooling by air currents,
and to prevent the mirror surface from being fouled by dust and
other things, the whole top of the mirror frame is covered by sheets
of window glass. To prevent the loss of heat by air convection
from the very hot blackened heater tube, this metal tube is sur-
rounded by a glass tube, leaving an air space of about three-fourths
inch all around it. But the glass tube grows very hot, and itself
tends to cool, so that great losses of heat would still occur there.
This is hindered by a second concentric tube of glass, larger than
the first, and separated from it by the highest practicable vacuum.
In this way, the heated inner tube is, like the inner part of a thermos
bottle, prevented from cooling by a vacuum jacket. Of course, it
is not practicable to coat the inner glass with silver, like a thermos
bottle. Complete silvering of it would shut out the sun rays. How-
ever, the upper one-third of its surface is silvered, which helps
decidedly to prevent the escape of heat and hinders very little the
sun rays from entering.

The whole cooker, with all of its coverings, is shown in plate 3.
Temperatures of 175° C. are readily attained. This is quite hot
enough to bake bread.

Fruit is preserved with great ease. The prepared fruit is put
into glass jars, covered over with sirup, and left overnight in the
lower oven. In the morning, the jar covers are fastened down while
still hot. That is all! Indeed, the cooker is highly convenient.
Foods may be prepared in a cool kitchen, having no fire. A beauti-
ful mountain view is seen as they are set into the ovens out of doors.
160 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

There is no danger of burning in the well-tempered heat. Foods
may be left to cook for many hours without harm. AJl meats and
vegetables are most deliciously prepared.

In short, the solar cooker is a delightful luxury. Whether im-
provements and simplifications may reduce it to less than a luxury
is still questionable. As an experiment in collecting solar heat, it
has served a very useful purpose. Several of the devices tried out
thereby seem likely to be of value for the greater problem of har-
nessing the sun rays for power.

CONDITIONS IN THE SUN

Before discussing the influence of the sun on climates and weather,
let us devote a few moments to the consideration of the sun itself.
As Dr. Russell stated 2 years ago, the sun is composed of the same
chemical elements as those found upon the earth, and roughly in
the same proportions. The temperature even at the surface of the
sun is observed to be of the order of 6,000° absolute centigrade, nearly
twice as hot as the arc ight. All substances are not only melted, but
rendered gaseous, at such temperatures. At lower levels within the
sun’s body there is every reason to believe that the temperature
rapidly rises. Dr. Eddington computes for the sun’s central tem-
perature something lke 20,000,000° C. The pressure there reaches
many millions of atmospheres. Though we have no examples of
such extreme conditions on the earth, we may surely infer that the
sun’s substance except possibly near its center is wholly gaseous.
Elements like oxygen and hydrogen, which combine so avidly as
to explode together when burned on earth, would not unite at all
at solar temperatures. Not only are there no molecular compounds
formed there (except in sun spots, where lower temperatures pre-
vail), but even the atoms themselves are largely split to pieces,
throwing off electrons and the other recently discovered subatomic
constituents.

MEASURING SOLAR RADIATION

For many years the Smithsonian Institution has devoted much
attention to the measurement of the intensity of solar radiation.
We are concerned not only with its total heating power but with
the relative intensity of the rays of the different colors. [Here a
spectrum was thrown on the screen.| Not only the rays visible to
the eye, but others beyond the violet and beyond the red, which
we call ultraviolet and infrared, respectively, are plentifully emitted
by the glowing sun.

All rays, whatever their color, or even if they are invisible ultra-
violet or infrared rays, give up their total energy to produce heat

when they are fully absorbed upon a black surface. Hence we use
sensitive blackened electrical thermometers rather than the eye, the
photograph, or even the photoelectric cell when we wish to compare

of a different color or wave length. My predecessor, Secretary
Langley, invented the bolometer (fig. 5), a delicate electrical re-
162 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

sistance thermometer, for this purpose about the year 1880. We
use the bolometer every day in our three field stations on high
desert mountains of California, Chile, and Egypt to measure the
energy of the rays that compose the sun’s spectrum.

A STATION FOR OBSERVING SOLAR RADIATION

Plate 4, figure 1 shows our station at Montezuma, Chile. It occu-
pies a foothill 9,000 feet in height not far from the Andes Momun-
tains, which rise to 18,000 feet within full view. The station is near
the nitrate fields of northern Chile, where neither beast nor bird,
reptile nor insect, nor any living plant is to be seen. Darwin, in
his book entitled “The Voyage of the Beagle”, tells of riding all
day in this Desert of Atacama, and seeing no life except a few
flies feasting on the dead body of a mule. The observers bring all
the water for washing, bathing, cooking, and photography from
Calama, a town 10 miles away. They have a piano, Victrola, radio,
books and games, and telephonic communication with Calama, but
the life there is certainly not a gay one. Every day that is fair
(and 80 percent of the days are fair) they observe from about 6
o’clock until 10 o’clock a.m., and compute from 10 o’clock until mid-
afternoon, or even later. By evening they are able to telephone out
their message, giving the intensity of the sun’s rays as they would
be found outside our atmosphere. The result reaches Washington
early on the next morning and is broadcast by Science Service at
4 p.m. to the world.

Plate 4, figure 2 shows the bleak character of our newly occupied
station in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. It is on Mount St. Katherine,
8,500 feet in elevation, about 10 miles from St. Katherine Monastery
on Mount Sinai. The director, Mr. Zodtner, his wife, and two small
children, and the assistant, Mr. Greeley, occupy this station.

SOLAR ENERGY SPECTRA

Figure 6 shows a series of bolometric solar spectral energy curves
all obtained on the same forenoon at our station at Montezuma,
Chile. You will note first of all that the spectrum visible to the eye
makes less than half of the length of the prismatic solar energy
spectrum as we observe it. Second, you will observe that at several
places in the infrared region there are great vacancies where the
spectral energy almost disappears. These bands, named by Langley
p, ¢, w, and Q, are produced by the absorption of the sun’s rays by
water vapor in the earth’s atmosphere. Third, you will see many
smaller indentations in the visible and ultraviolet regions, which
are duplicated on all of the several energy curves shown in the figure.
These indentations correspond to the dark lines called Fraunhofer
lines seen visually in, or in photographs of, spectra of the sun.
HOW THE SUN WARMS THE EARTH—ABBOT

They are produced by ab-
sorption of gases such as
hydrogen, calcium, iron,
magnesium, and_ others,
which are volatilized in the
sun itself. Fourth, you
may note that though all
of the energy curves are
of nearly equal height in
the highest parts of the
infrared spectrum, their
heights increase consider-
ably from the bottom en-
ergy curve shown to the top
one, if observed in the vio-
let or ultraviolet. This in-
dicates how much more
transparent our atmosphere
is for red and infrared rays
than it is for violet and
ultraviolet rays. The curves
were made successively, the
lowest in the early morn-
ing, when the sun shone
obliquely through a great
thickness of atmosphere,
causing much depletion of
the rays, and the highest
near noon, when the sun
was nearly vertically over-
head and the thickness of
air traversed was much less.

to the infrared. Compare this solar energy curve, if you please,
with the energy curve of a perfect radiator of the temperature of
HOW THE SUN WARMS THE EARTH—ABBOT 165

6,000° absolute centigrade shown near it. Evidently they are much
alike in most parts, but the solar curve falls away from the other
in the ultraviolet. This weakness of ultraviolet rays is due mainly
to the powerful absorption of the sun’s ultraviolet rays by the sun’s
own gaseous envelop. But you will gather from this comparison of
the two curves, I am sure, an indication of one of the ways used to
estimate the sun’s effective surface temperature as of the order of
6,000° absolute centigrade.

THE SILVER-DISK PYRHELIOMETER FOR MEASURING TOTAL SOLAR
RADIATION

Plate 5 shows the silver-disk pyrheliometer. It is an instrument
which I invented at the Smithsonian Institution for measuring the
total heating power of the whole solar beam. It has been standard-
ized against the water-flow pyrheliometer, also my invention, and
over 70 copies of the silver-disk pyrheliometer have been made and
calibrated at the Smithsonian Institution and furnished at cost to
observers on all the continents of the world. At the front of the
pyrheliometer is a tubular vestibule with numerous diaphragms for
keeping out sky light and the wind, while admitting the sun’s rays
to the box beneath. In this box is a blackened disk of silver, as
big as a dollar, and about five-sixteenths inch thick, on which the
sun’s rays shine at right angles. In a radial hole, bored from one
side into the silver disk, is sunk the cylindrical bulb of a delicate
mercury thermometer. Jor convenience the stem of the thermometer
is bent at right angles and fastened alongside of the vestibule. The
observer, with watch in hand, notes the rate of rise of the ther-
mometer when he has admitted sun rays by opening the shutter
at the top of the vestibule tube. In this way the heat of the sun’s
rays is measured.

THE SOLAR CONSTANT OF RADIATION

We cannot carry the silver-disk pyrheliometer to the moon to
measure the intensity of sun rays outside our atmosphere. It is
true that we did in 1914 send an automatic pyrheliometer into the
stratosphere (figs. 8 and 9) and got good observations with twenty-
four twenty-fifths of the atmosphere eliminated. Instead of actually
observing outside the atmosphere, we measure the area under one of
the bolometric spectral energy curves that I showed a few moments
ago, and also the area under the computed solar-energy curve outside
the atmosphere, which I also referred to. Dividing the latter area
by the former, we obtain the factor by which, if we multiply the
solar heat observed by the pyrheliometer, we may obtain the heat
which that instrument would have measured if we had taken station
on the moon and observed the sun there.

HOW THE SUN WARMS THE EARTH—-ABBOT 167

Such is Langley’s method for measuring what is called the solar
constant of radiation. I can explain its result as follows: Imagine
a cube of blackened water 1 centimeter on edge, or about the size of a
dice cube. Expose it on the moon with one face at right angles to
the sun’srays. Let the experiment be made in March when the earth
and moon are at mean solar distance. How much will the tem-
perature of the blackened water cube rise in 1 minute? The answer
is 1.94° C. That is called the solar constant of radiation. In usual
words, the intensity of solar heating is 1.94 calories per square
centimeter per minute at mean solar distance outside our atmosphere.

THE SUN A VARIABLE STAR

For 15 years Smithsonian observers have measured the solar con-
stant on every practicable day on one or more high desert mountains
in distant lands. Though called a constant, the value is not a
constant. Figure 10 shows how its monthly mean values have been
observed to vary from 1920 to 1930. The changes, as you see, are
not large. In 1922 there came the largest, reaching a range of 2.5
percent. Figure 11 shows the values measured simultaneously by
Smithsonian observers in California, Chile, and South-West Africa.
Their results, though not absolutely identical, are so nearly so as
to disclose fair agreement as to the variability of the sun. Its
variability seems to be altogether irregular. As we see it in figure
-10, it seems quite devoid of any wavelike regular periodicity.

PERIODICITIES IN SOLAR VARIATION

In figure 12, however, I show that this first impression of entire
irregularity in solar variation is superficial. In reality the sun’s
variation is a complex summation of not less than seven regularly
recurring waves, or periodicities. They are respectively of approxi-
mately 7, 8, 11, 21, 25, 45, and 68 months in their periods.

The component periodicity curves are summed up into the curve B,
which is plotted in dots upon the original measured curve A. Even
in details the agreement of the two curves is striking. Thus we claim
that the sun is not a constant star but a variable one, whose appar-
ently irregular variation is really a complex of at least seven perio-
dicities.

The interesting question at once occurs: Do the solar periodicities
impress themselves on the earth’s weather? They do. Before dis-
cussing this subject I must speak of the sun spots.

SUN SPOTS

When Galileo in 1610 first used the telescope he saw that the sun’s
surface carried dark spots (pl. 6) and that these moved along, indi-
cating that the sun rotates in about 26 days. From 1826 to 1868

H. Schwabe, of Dessau, Germany, kept daily watch upon the sun
spots and discovered about 1848 that their numbers wax and wane
in a period of about 11 years. His observations were continued by
many observers, and old records were consulted which showed that
the 11-year periodicity in sun spots has continued for several cen-

turies (fig. 13). Recently Douglass, by tree-ring measurements, and
Baron de Geer, Antevs, and others, by measuring clay deposits, have
found evidences of the sun-spot period for many centuries. About
25 years ago Dr. Hale at Mount Wilson Observatory discovered that
sun spots are magnetic. This fell in nicely with the previously
observed fact that the earth’s magnetism and the aurora borealis are
both closely associated with the sun-spot periodicity. Hale soon
found that magnetic polarities are opposite in adjacent spots, and he
showed later that the magnetic polarity of sun spots passes through

this interesting course, that the order of the two polarities is opposite
in the north and south solar hemispheres and that the order con-
tinues unchanged through each 11-year sun-spot period, but reverses
at the beginning of the next period (fig. 14). Thus it requires two
11-year periods to bring the sun through a full cycle of magnetic
changes.

SUN SPOTS AND WEATHER

For many years we have known that though the solar constant is a
little higher when sun spots are most numerous, paradoxically the
weather at most stations is a little cooler. The effect is only about
1° F. at maximum. Recently I have found a more important effect
than this of sun spots on weather. Figure 15 gives one of the many
instances which illustrate it. At Bismarck, N.Dak., I find the solar
periodicities plainly shown in the departures from normal tempera-
172 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1933

ture, but the phases and the magnitudes of the periodicities change
according as sun spots are few or many. The same is true at other
places. I shall not detain you with many instances of the periodici-
ties in solar variation reflected in weather but I will ask you to note

that the 11-month period in Bismarck temperatures holds practically
with unchanged phase from 1875 to 1925, provided we limit ourselves
in comparisons to intervals of equal sun-spot numbers. On the other
hand the phase of this weather wave reverses if we compare intervals
HOW THE SUN WARMS THE EARTH—ABBOT 173

of low with intervals of high sun spots. To reinforce this observa-
tion, I shall give one other instance from Cape Town, South Africa,
10,000 miles from Bismarck. Again in figure 16, observing the 11-
month solar period as reflected in Cape ‘Town temperature depar-
tures, and confining ourselves to intervals of time when Wolf’s sun-
spot numbers did not exceed 30, we find that the 11-month period is
so definite and so accurately in the same phase from 1865 to 1925
that we are able to correct the length of the period and detect that it
lacks 3 days of a full 11 months. It is in fact 331 days.

I need not detain you to discuss others of the numerous solar
periodicities which I have found reflected at numerous stations all
over the world, both in temperature and precipitation. I will only
state that the cumulative evidence that the solar variations largely
control the weather is overwhelming. The regular periodicities that
comprise solar variation are all important in governing weather, but
their weather effects shift in phase according to the sun-spot numbers
prevailing.

THE 23-YEAR PERIOD IN WEATHER

It happens that 7 solar periodicities above specified all come
very close to finding their least common multiple in the double sun-
spot period of 276 months, or 23 years. It may be very significant
that this interval, within the error of observation, is equal to Hale’s
magnetic cycle in sun spots. Since all of the solar periodicities of
which it is the least common multiple are influential in governing
weather, we need not be surprised to find that the weather tends to
repeat itself, detail after detail, at intervals of 23 years.

As an illustration, figure 17 shows the smoothed percentages of
normal monthly precipitation found at Nagpur in south-central India
from 1856 to 1980. The values are arranged in 23-year cycles, so
chosen that the year 1875 begins a cycle so as to fit with most of the
lists in World Weather Records.? Lines have been drawn to guide
the reader’s eye to what seem to me to be homologous features in
the four cycles illustrated. I would like to call special attention to
the regions 1865-70, 1888-93, 1912-17. In 1865, 1868, and 1870 we
find 3 pillarlike features of high-percentage precipitation bound-
ing 2 features of subnormal precipitation. Thus there stand out
two intervals of 3 and 2 years, respectively, as if guarded by these
sentinel features, but embracing nearly a score of subordinate fea-
tures. The reader’s attention is now invited to similar features,
1888-93 and 1912-17, in which nearly all the details seem to be
recognizable,
