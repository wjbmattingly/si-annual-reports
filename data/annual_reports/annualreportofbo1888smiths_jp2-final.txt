UPON

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. S NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1888.

BY
G. BROWN GOODE,
Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of the National Museum.

A.—GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

In January, 1847, the first Board of Regents after many weeks of
consultation and deliberation over the plans for the organization of the
Smithsonian Institution unanimously voted the following resolution:

Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress, and in accord-
ance with the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that one of
the principal modes of executing the act and the trust, is the accumulation
of collections of specimens and objects of natural history and of elegant art,
and the gradual formation of a library of valuable works pertaining to all
departments of human knowledge, to the end that a copious store-house of
materials of science, literature, and art may be provided, which shall ex-
cite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall assist the original
investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to the pursuit
of any branch of knowledge.*

This was a high ideal for the future National Museum, but it is one
which it has been year after year more closely approaching, and it is
hoped that the present report will show that the work accomplished
during the fiscal year of 188788 has brought us still nearer to its re-
alization.

With the death of Professor Baird, August 19, 1887, the National
Museum passed from under the direction of the mind by which its
policy had been planned for many years. If his biography could be
properly written, it would include a fall history of the Museum, as well
as of the Fish Commission, and in minor degree ot the Smithsonian In-
stitution itself, for as secretary and assistant secretary he was associated
with nearly every phase of its activity during thirty-seven of its forty-

one years of corporate existence. With the Fish Commission, first of
~ all, his name is identified as its founder as well as its chief adminis.

trator, and with the National Museum almost as closely, though less ex-
clusively, since, though not its originator nor its sole director, his
was, aS has been said, for a very long time the master mind in its
management. His relation to it was very similar to that held by Sir
Henry Cole to the great national establishment at South Kensington
in England, so well described in the volumes entitled “ Fifty Years of
Public Work,” and recently published by his son, Mr. Alan Cole.

With the death of Professor Baird the Museum must of necessity
enter upon a new period in its history, for his successors, be they never
so desirous of perpetuating his policy, cannot apply to its management

‘the same kind of supervision, nor the result of such a life-time of ex-
perience and observation.

Upon the firm foundation which he has laid they must build a super-
structure, harmonious in plan, but, it may be, different in proportions
and even in material. Their safest course must.be not to work as he
did, under cireumstanees different from those which are henceforth to
exist, but to try to work as he would have done in connection with
these changed circumstances.

EARLY HISTORY OF THE MUSEUM.

The idea of a national museum in the city of Washington was first
suggested by the Hon. Joel Roberts Poinsett, of South Carolina, Sec-
retary of War under President Van Buren, who in 1840.organized, for
the purpose of establishing such a museutn, a society called ‘‘The Na-
tional Institution,” afterwards ‘‘ The National Institute,” which was
exceedingly prosperous and active for four years. By this Society the
nucleus for a national museum was gathered in the Patent Office building
in Washington, and public opinion was educated to consider the es-
tablishment of such an institution worthy of the attention of the Gov-
ernment of the United States. In 1846, having failed in securing the
public recognition at which it aimed, and the Smithsonian Institution
being by its charter entitled to take possession of the extensive Goy-
ernment collections already assembled in its charge, the society became
torpid, and eventually, in 1861, passed out of existence.

From 1844 to 1858, when the so-called “‘ National Cabinet of Curiosi-
ties” passed into the charge of the Smithsonian Institution, the term -
‘¢ National Museum” was in disuse. From that time onward, however,
it was used, unofficially, to designate the collections in the Smithson-
ian building.

After the ‘+ National Cabinet” was delivered to the Regents, appro-
priations were made by Congress for its maintenance. During the
twenty-three years which followed, the collections were greatly increased
and were made the subjects of numerous important memoirs upon the
natural history and ethnology of America. The public halls, with their
arrangements for the exhibition of a portion of the collections, also re-
ceived a due share of attention, and a certain amount of instruction and
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ie

pleasure was afforded to visitors. The appropriations, however, were —
meagre, the space limited, and the staff was so inadequate that little
could be done except to keep the collections in good preservation.

The Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia was an event of great eduea-
tional importance to the people of the United States ; and not the least
of its benefits were the lessons it taught as to the possibilities for good
in public museums. The objects which at the close of the Centennial
were given to the United States for its National Museum were of much
intrinsic value, but were still more important in that they led to the
erection of a large building for the expansion of the Museum itself.

From 1876 to 1881 was a period of quiet preparation for future effort.
From 1881 to 1888, another period of seven years, its growth has been
rapid, though the organism is still in its infancy. These seven years
have been years of experiment, but it is hoped that it is now evident to
the people and to Congress that the young museum is now ready to
begin a promising progress toward maturity.

PROGRESS IN THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM.

Among the more important features of the work, up to the present
time, certain definite steps of progress have been taken, among the
most important of which may be mentioned:

(1) An organization of the Museum staff has been effected—efficient
for present purposes and capable of expansion and extension as ocea-
sion may require.

(2) Through the agency of this staff, the materialsin the Museum,
the accumulations of nearly half a century, have been examined, classi-
fied, and brought under control.

(3) The collections have been almost quadrupled in extent.

(4) A beginning has been made toward the development of a
thoroughly labeled exhibition series, available for the instruction of
the public.

(5) A thorough study of the organizations and systems of classifica-
_ tion in other museums throughout the world has been made, the results
of which are beginning to appear in the work of the Museum staff. A
report upon the great museums of the world is in preparation and will
soon be published.

(6) Many new methods of installation have been developed by experi-
ments in the Museum, and in the expositions in which the Museum has
participated. These are tinding favor, and are being adopted in many
similar establishments at home and abroad, and will certainly add to
the economy and success of our own administration.

(7) Science has been forwarded by the publication of many hundreds
of papers describing the materials in the Museum, while the work of
_ specialists in the production of these papers has greatly improved the
significance and value of the collections,
6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

NECESSITY FOR A NATIONAL MUSEUM.

That the United States must have a National Museum is so evident
that the proposition needs no argument for its support.

Every considerable nation has a museum or group of museums in its
capital city—centres of scientific and educational activity—the treas-
ure-houses of the nation, filled with memorials of national triumphs in
the fields of science, art, and industrial progress.

They are legitimate objects of national pride, for upon the character
of its museum and hbraries intelligent persons visiting a country vcry
properly base their judgment as to the nature and degree of the civili-
zation of the people.

In most great cities, as I have said, there is a group of museums.
London, for instance, has—

. The British Museum, with its collection of books and manuscripts, its galleries of
archeology, historic and prehistoric, its collection of coins, pottery, sculpture, ete.
The Natural History Museum (devoted to botany, mineralogy, and geology).
The South Kensington Museum (arts and art-manufactures).
The Bethnal Green Museum (industrial and decorative art).
The Nationa] Gallery of Art.
The National Portrait Gallery.
The Museum of Practical Geology.
The Museum of Economie Botany at Kew.
The Imperial Institute (commerce and natural resources of tke British Empire).
The Parkes Museum of Hygiene.
The India Museum.
The Patent Musem.
The Hunterian Museum (comparative anatomy).
The Museum of Naval Architecture.
The National Museum of Fisheries, and others.

Paris has—

The Museum of the Louvre (art and archeology).

The Luxembourg Museum (modern art).

The Museum of Natural History and Comparative Anatomy in the Garden of Plants.
The Geological Museum.

The Ethnological Museum at the Trocadero.

The Museum of Arts and Manufactures.

The Museum of the City of Paris.

The St. Germain Museum (French archeology).

The Cluny Museum (costumes, furniture, and decoration (?)).

The Military Museum at the Hotel des Invalides.

The Guimet Museum (history of religion).

The Museum of Marine Architecture in the Louvre. g
The Collections at the Gobelin and Sévres establishments, and others.,

Berlin, St. Petersburg, and Vienna have similar groups, and so have
Florence, Christiania, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Leyden, Brussels, Mad-
rid, Buda-Besth, Tokio, and other national establishments.

It should be borne in mind that here in Washington under the roofs
of the Smithsonian and New Museum buildings are grouped together
collections whieh in London, Paris, or any other of the European
capitals are provided for in a group of museums, for accommodating
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. a

which a much larger number of equally commodious buildings is found

needful.
POSSIBILITIES OF THE FUTURE.

It is possible, as I remarked in last year’s report, to show that Wash-
ington may readily be made the seat of one of the greatest museums in
the world. It will perhaps be neither practicable nor desirable to
gather together in Washington collections of ancient medieval art,
such as those which adorn the capitals of Hurope; but a representative
series of such objects will undoubtedly grow up, which shall tend to edu-
cate the public taste, and to promote, so far as possible, the study of the
elements of art and the history of civilization, as well as to forward the
growth of the arts of design. This having been accomplished, the at-
tention of the Museum should be directed mainly toward the exhibition
of the geology and natural history of America, and its natural resources,
to the preservation of memorials of its aboriginal inhabitants, and the
exposition of the arts and industries of America. :

It is evident that the National Museum of the United States will of
necessity have features peculiar to itself, developed in response to the
peculiar needs of the people of this continent. Itshould be remembered
that the national collections of every principal European nation are di-
vided into several groups, each under separate administration, though
often within the general control of some central authority. In France,
for instance, most of the museums are under the Ministry of Public In-
struction, and in England, to a less extent, under the Department of
Science and Art.

In the great European capitals the public collections are scattered
through various parts of the cities, in museums with distinctive names
and independentin their organizations. Much of the work which should
properly be done by such museums is omitted, because no one of them
has seen fit to undertake it; while, on the other hand, much labor is du-
plicated, which is perhaps equally unfortunate, collections of similar
scope and purpose being maintained in different parts of the same city.
One of the chief objections to such division of effort is that much of the
value of large collections in any department is lost by failure to concen-
trate them where they may be studied and compared side by side. In
Washington the national collections are all, without exception, concen-
trated in one group of buildings. The Army Medical Museum now oc-
cupies a building side by side with those under the control of the Smith-
sonian Institution, and this proximity, in connection with the long-estab-
lished policy of co-operation between the two organizations, will cause
them to be, for all practical purposes, united in interest.

POSSIBILITIES OF INCREASE AND IMPROVEMENT.

Although the appropriations from the public treasury for the main-
tenance of a national museum are small, compared with those in sev-
eral European countries, the value of objects given by private individ-
8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

uals is proportionately larger. The actual value of such contributions
for ten years past, has not, it is estimated, fallen short of $20,000 a year,
and in some years has been greater.

Among important gifts may be mentioned such as the George Catlin
Indian Gallery, of inestimable value to the American historian and eth-
nologist; the Riley collection of North American insects, the finest in
existence, containing 150,000 specimens, and easily worth $50,000; the
coliection bequeathed in 1887 by the late Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia,
containing besides minerals and other objects, about 20,000 concholog-
ical specimens, and appraised by the State at $10,000; and the collec-
tion of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the transfer of
which from Philadelphia to Washington, a special appropriation was
made by Congress.

Some exceedingly valuable collections in this country and in Kurope
have been bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution which have not
yet come into its possession. Within the past ten years it is estimated
that individuals to the number of at least a thousand have made gifts
to the Museum to the value of $100 or more.

Of the fourteen hundred and eighty-two separate lots of specimens
received within the past fiscal year at least one thousand were gifts,
from nearly as many individuals—some of little value, others very
- important.

Not a day passes during which some stranger, pleased with the work
of the Museum, does not voluntarily send in some contribution more
or less important.

The National Museum now contains about 2,900,000 objects, distrib-
uted among the various departments, as is shown in the table on page
22, of this report. .

The late Professor Baird was once asked whether the value of the
collections in the National Museum was equal to the amount which had
been expended in its maintenance. - He replied, unhesitatingly, that al-
though it would be by no means a fair criterion of their value he did
not doubt that by a judicious and careful system of saie the entire sum
could be recovered.

One of the most striking features in the affairs of the Museum is the
manner in which its collections are increasing.

In 1887 the number of specimens was more than ten times as great —
as five years before. :

In the last fiscal year twenty-five thousand new lots or groups of
specimens were entered upon the Museum catalogue.

This increase, as has been shown, is in large degree spontaneous, only
a small amount of money being available for the purchase of new
material. :

As might be supposed, a considerable proportion of the objects given
duplicate material already on hand, and although these contributions
can with the utmost advantage be used for distribution to other
museums and schools, they do not increase as much as is desired the
4

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Sa

value of the collections for study by specialists, and for general educa-
tional purposes. The need of a larger fund for the purchase of speci-
mens is yearly more manifest. Exceedingly important material is
constantly offered to us at prices very much below what it would cost
to obtain it by collecting, and in many instances, when refused, it is
eagerly taken by the museums and institutions of Europe.

The most enlightened nations of Europe do not hesitate to spend
money liberally to promote the interests of their national museums.

For the purchase of specimens for the South Kensington Museum
from 1853 to 1887 $1,586,634 was expended; or a yearly average of
nearly $47,000.

Toward her other museums Bacland is equally liberal. Exact
statistics are not at hand, but it is quite within bounds to assert that
her average expenditures for the purchase of new objects for museums
in London is not less than $500,000 a year.

The museums of England are rich with the accumulations of cen-
turies. The National Museum of the United States is young and has
enormous deficiencies in every department. It needs, more than any
museum in Europe, the opportunity to increase its resources through
purchase. The total amount expended for the purchase of specimens
for the National Museum since its foundation has not exceeded $20,000,
and never in one year more than $8,500.

More has been expended for the improvement of two museums in

the city of New York in the past four years than has ever been expended

by the general Government upon the Museum in Washington.

Within the past year three mortifying instances have occurred of the
inability of the National wu useum to buy specimens needed to complete
its collections. ‘

A very valuable collection of minerals, absolutely essential to the
national collections and for some years on deposit in the National
Museum, was withdrawn by its owner and placed in a school museum

“in a neighboring city, because $4,000 could not be had for its purchase—

a sum far below its value.

A collection of implements and weapons illustrating the history of
the natives of Alaska, gathered by an officer in the U.S. Navy, and
almost indispensable for the completion of the national ethnological
collection, was sold to a museum in a neighboring city for $12,000,
while the National Museum had no money to expend for such objects.

One of the most important collections of birds in America, the loss of
which was a national misfortune, was taken from the city of Washing-
ton and sold to the British Museum for $10,000, no American institu-
tion having money available for its purchase.

Instances of this kind occur nearly every month in every year.

The National Museum has had the option for several years of the
purchase at cost of $80,000 of a collection of minerals, which once
acquired would enable its mineralogical department to rank among the
first in the world. Congress has never been asked to make an appro-
10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

priation for its purchase, simply because of unwillingness to ask for
that which might not be granted. Minerals, having a money value,
can readily be sold, and are not very often given to the Museum, and
the poverty of its mineralogical collection is by no means creditable to
the nation. ;

The-Museum receives many valuable gifts from Government officials
abroad, especially from those in the consular and diplomatic service,
and in the Navy.

{ff the actual cost of gathering specimens could be paid, the time and
experience of these men would gladly be given gratuitously. In this
way, by the expenditure of a few thousands eath year, extensive and
important additions might be made to the national collections.

THE NECESSITY FOR A NEW MUSEUM BUILDING.

The National Museum is now approaching an important crisis in its
history. Its future will depend upon the action of Congress in granting
it an additional building, for without more room its growth can not but
be in large degree arrested.

The necessity for additional room is constantly increasing, and sev-
eral of the collections, to wit, transportation and engineering, fishes,
reptiles, birds’ eggs, mollusks, insects, marine invertebrates, vertebrate
and invertebrate fossils, fossil and recent plants, are in Some instances
wholly unprovided for, and in others only iu a very inadequate degree.

In the main hall of the Smithsonian building is still exhibited the
collection of birds. A few cases containing birds’ eggs and shells have
recently been arranged along the center of this hall.

There are at the present time nineteen departments in the National
Museum, eleven of which have no space assigned to them in the Museum
building, solely on account of its crowded condition. The collection
of prehistoric anthropological objects remains installed on the second
floor of the Smithsonian building. The collections of the remaining ten
departments can not be exhibited or even properly arranged and classi-
fied without more room. ‘These collections are at present stored in the
attics and basements of the Smithsonian and Armory buildings, and are
inaccessible for study and for the other purposes for which they were
obtained. The specimens comprising these collections are not simply
objects of natural history, possessing an abstract interest to the stu-
dent, but represent the application of natural objects to the industries,
‘and, as such, are of great importance. There are several collections of
ores, minerals, building stones, and of objects representing various arts
‘and industries, which are of very great value, since they furnish to the
American manufacturer and designer information of inestimable im-
‘portance.

The increase in the national collections during the last six years may
perhaps be best described by the statement that in 1882 the total
number of specimens recorded in the Museum was about 183,000; while
in 1887 the records indicated the possession of more than 2,900,000.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 11

specimens. It is proper to say in this connection that the actual in-
crease was not so great as shown by the records, since during this
period a large amount of material previously received had been brought
’ under control and placed on the books of the Museum. It should also
be borne in mind that the present Museum building was planned with
reference to the reception of the material j in its custody at the time of
its construction.

In the Armory building there are at the present time several hun-
dreds of boxes containing valuable material which has never been un-
packed, since there is no space available for the display of the specimens.
Many of the boxes contain collections which were brought to the Museum
through the medium of special acts of Congress.

Independently of the collections obtained at expositions, a very large
amount of material has been received from foreign Governments, among
which may be mentioned those of Mexico, Central America, several of
the South American States, and Japan, which have made extensive con-
tributions to the zodlogical, geological, ethnological, and technological
collections.

APPRECIATION BY FORMIGN NATIONS.

The new methods of work and of museum arrangement, which have
srown up here, have attracted much attention abroad. Mexico, in
1837, sent the entire collections of the National Natural History Mu-
seums, then just being founded, to Washington, in charge of two of her
principal naturalists, who passed six months at the National Museum
identifying their material and studying the methods of administration.
Costa Rica, forming a national museum, sent its director here for a six
months’ course of study.

Japan has sent the entire national collection of birds to the Museum
to be studied and reported upon by one of the naturalists of the Mu-
seum staff.

Germany has been supplied with a complete set of plans and illustra-
tions of methods of administration at the request of the Director of the
National Zosdlogical Museum.

In 1883, at the Fisheries Exhibition in London, the methods of the
National Mnsenrn were strictly adhered to in the arrangement of the
display made by the United States.

In 1888, in his address as president of the Anthropological Society
of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, General
Pitt-Rivers said that the American display at the Fishery Exhibition
was the only thing-done in the true spirit of modern science in the
whole series of professedly scientific exhibitions held in London within
the past six ix years. a

* The words ds of General Pitt-Rivers in 1488 are simply : a repetition of what he said
in 1883, made stronger by the observations of five more years of exhibitions in Europe.
In 1883 he wrote to the London Times:

Sir: In confirmation of the praise you justly bestow on the arrangement of the
United States gopenEen in the Fisheries Exhibition 1 beg to draw attention to the

12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Such expressious of opinion, coupled with the constant praise with
which Kuropean journals speak of the scientific work of our Govern-
ment departments, can not but be gratifying, and it should be a matter
of national pride to merit it.

THE RELATIONS OF THE MUSEUM TO THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

The Smithsonian Institution, though it bears the name of a private
citizen and a foreigner, has been for nearly half a century one of the
principal rallying points of the scientific workers of America. It has
also been intimately connected with very many of the most important
scientific undertakings of the Government.

Many wise and enlightened scholars have given to its service the best
years of their lives, and some of the most eminent scientific men our
country has given birth to have passed their entire lifetime in work for
itssuccess. Its publications, six hundred and seventy in number, which
when combined make up over one hundred dignified volumes, are to be
found in every important library in the world, and some of them, it is
safe to say, on the working table of every scientific investigator in the
world who can read English.

Through these books, through the reputation of the men who have
worked for it and through it, and through the good accomplished by its
system of international exchange, by means of which within the past
thirty-eight years 1,262,114 packages of books and other scientific and
literary materials have been distributed to every region of the earth,
it has acquired a reputation at least as far reaching as that of any other
institution of learning in the world.

It is therefore representative of what is deemed in other lands the
chief glory of this nation, for whatever may be thought in other coun-
tries of American art, of American literature, American institutions
generally, the science of America is accepted without question as equal
to the best.

In the scientific journals of Great Britain and other European coun-
tries, the reader finds most appreciative reviews of the scientific pub-
lications of the Smithsonian, the Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology,
the Geological Survey, the Department of Agriculture, and the Fish
Commission, and they are coustantly holding up the Government of
the United States, as an example to their own, of what governments
should do for the support of their scientific institutions. ~

fact that in the whole exhibition it is the only one which is arranged historically. °
In the Chinese, Japanese, Scandinavian, and Dutch courts there are objects which
the scientific student of the arts of life may pick out and arrange in the proper order
in his own mind; but in that of the United States, following the method adopted in
the National Museum in Washington, there bas been attempted something more—
to bring the department into harmony with modern ideas. This gives to the exhi-
bition an interest which is apart from commerce, and an interest which is beyond
the mere requirements of fish culture, and it may be regarded as one out of many in-
dications of the way in which the enlightened Government of the United States mark
their appreciation of the demands of science.

I have the honor to be, sir, yours obediently, .
A. Pitt-RIVERs.
Ey REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13

It is surely a legitimate source of pride to Americans that their work
in science should be so thoroughly appreciated by eastern nations, and
it is important that the reputation should be maintained. Nothing can
be more in consonance with the spirit of our Government, nor more in
accord with the injunction of Washington in his “Farewell Address,”
lately admiringly quoted by Sir Lyon Playfair in his address as presi-
dent of the British Association for the Advancement of Science:

Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the
general diffusion of knowledge.

In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public
opinion it should be enlightened.

No one has been able to show why Smithson selected the United
States as the seat of his foundation. He had no acquaintances in Amer-
ica, nor does he appear to have had any books relating to America ex-
cept two. Khees quotes from one of these [‘‘ Travels through North
America,” by Isaac Weld, secretary of the Royal Society], a paragraph
concerning Washington, then a small town of 5,000 inhabitants, in

’ which it is predicted that ‘‘ the Federal city, as soon as navigation is

perfected, will increase most rapidly, and that at a future day, if the
affairs of the United States go on as rapidly as they have done, it will
become the grand emporium of the West, and rival in magnitude and
splendor the cities of the whole world.”

Inspired by a belief in the future greatness of the new nation, real-
izing that while the needs of England were well met by existing organ-
izations such as would not be likely to spring up for many years in a
new, poor, and growing country, he founded in the new England an in-
stitution of learning, the civilizing power of which has been of inealeu-
lable value. Who can attempt to say what the condition of the United
States would have been to-day without this bequest ?

In the words of John Quincy Adams:

Of all the foundations of establishments for pious or charitable uses
which ever signalized the spirit of the age or the comprehensive beneficence
of the founder, none can be named more deserving the approbation of man-
kind.

The most important service by far which the Smithsonian Institution
has rendered to the nation, has been that from year to year, since 1846—
intangible but none the less appreciable—by its constant co-operation
with the Government, public institutions and individuals in every en-
terprise, scientific or educational, which needed its advice, support or

aid from its resources.

There have been, however, material results of its activities, the ex-
tent of which can not fail to impress any one who will look at them ;
the most. important of these are the Library and the Museum, which
have grown up under its fostering care.

The library has been accumulated without aid from the treasury of
the United States; it has, in fact, been the result of an extensive system

of exchanges, the publications of the Institution having been used to
14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

obtain similar publications from institutions of learning in all parts of
the world.

In return for its own publications the Institution has received the
books which form its library.

This library, consisting of more than a quarter of a million volumes
and parts of volumes, has for over twenty years been deposited at the
Capitol as a portion of the Congressional Library, and is constantly
being increased. In the last fiscal year nineteen thousand titles were
thus added to the national collection of books.

Chiefly through its exchange system, the Smithsonian had, in 1865,
accumulated about forty thousand volumes, largely publications of
learned societies, containing the record of the actual progress of the
world in all that pertains tothe mental and physical development of the
human family, and affording the means of tracing the history of at least
every branch of positive science since the days of revival of letters un-
til the present time.

These books, in many instances presents from old Kuropean libraries,
and not to be obtained by purchase, formed even then one of the best
collections of the kind in the world.

The danger incurred from the fire of that year, and the fact that the
greater portion of these volumes, being unbound and crowded into in-
sufficient space, could not be readily consulted, while the expense to be
incurred for their binding, enlarged room, and other purposes connected
with their use threatened to grow beyond the means of the Institution,
appear to have been the moving causes which determined the Regents
to accept an arrangement by which Congress was to place the Smith-
sonian Library with its own in the Capitol, subject to the right of the
Regents to withdraw the books on paying the charges of binding, ete.
Owing to the same causes (which have affected the Library of Congress
itself) these principal conditions, except as regards their custody in a
fire-proof building, have never been fulfilled.

The books are still deposited chiefly in the Capitol, but though they
have now increased from 40,000 to fully 250,000 volumes and parts of
volumes, and form one of the most valuable collection of the kind in
existence, they not only remain unbound, but in a far more crowded
and inaccessible condition than they were before the transfer. It is
hardly necessary to add that these facts are deplored by no one more
than by the present efficient Librarian of Congress.

The purchasing power of the publications of the institution, when
offered in exchange, is far greater than that of money, and its benefit is
exerted chiefly in behalf of the National Library, and also to a consid-
erable extent in behalf of the National Museum.

The amount expended during the past forty years from the private
fund of the institution in the publication of books for gratuitous dis-
tribution has been $350,000, a sum nearly halfas great as the original
Smithson bequest, -
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15

These publications have had their influence for good in many ways,
but in addition to this, a library much more than equal in value to the
outlay, has through their buying power come into the possession of the
nation.

In addition to all this, a large amount of material has been acquired
for the Museum by direct expenditure from the private fund of the
Smithsonian Institution. The value of the collections thus acquired is
estimated to be more than equal to the whole amount of the Smithson
bequest.

The early history of the Museum was much like that of the library.
It was not until 1858 that it became the authorized depository of the
scientific collections of the Government, and it was not until after 1876
that it was officially recognized as the National Museum of the United
States.

But for the provident forethought of the Sivitheontaa Institution, the
United States would probably still be without even a reputable nuclease
for a National Museum.

The relations of the Museum to the system of popular lectures, for
many years established in “Washington, and the assistance which it
affords each year to students of science, is referred to elsewhere in this
report.

The Institution publishes many circulars giving information on scien-
tific subjects which are distributed gratuitously to those who write to
make inquiries, and this system is being continually extended. In ad-
dition to this, a large correspondence is carried on with people in search
of information on scientific topics. Probably three thousand letters a
year go out to people who write seeking to know the name of some
object, or other scientific fact.* Inquiries of this kind are always an-
swered promptly and fully, and frequently, to intelligent inquirers,
books are sent, which will enable them to find out such names for them-
selves in future. This work has not only an educational value but often
a great economic importance as well; as, for instance, when some com-
mon mineral has been mistaken for one of value, some useless plant
has been wrongly identitied and supposed to be of service in medicine,
or some harmless animal feared as noxious.

The publications of the Institution and its dependencies reach every
State and almost every county in the United States. A careful study
of the subject recently made by the president of one of the scientific
societies in Washington seems to indicate that there are several States
which are reached by no scientific publications whatever except those
distributed gratuitously by the Government.

Speaking of the Smithsonian Institution proper, and not of the Mu-
seum or any other trust that it administers, it may be stated that noth-
ing could be so desirable for the Institution as that Congress should ex-
amine for itself whether, on the whole, in the execution of the trust of
Smithson, more has been given to the Government than has been re:

I PTE A A FR

16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

/

ceived ; for if, in attempting to increase and diffuse knowledge among
mankind, the machinery of the Institution’s action has been such that
it has incidentally paid over to the Government the equivalent of much
more than the whole original fund, these facts should surely be known
to those who have to ask themselves in what spirit as well as for what
purpose the Institution expends money placed in its eharge.

Professor Langley has pointed out that ‘although by the judicious
administration of the Smithson fund nearly a million and a half dollars—
the fruits of its investment—have been applied during the past forty
years to the advancement of science and education in America (in ad-
dition to the principal $703,000, larger now than ever before) it should
be remembered that the income of the Instiution is only $42,000 a year,
a sum much smaller in its power to effect results than ever in previous
years.” ae

Can the United States fail to recognize its obligation to supplement
_ liberally this private contriburion for public good, especially if it be
born in mind that, as Professor Langley has recently shown, the Insti-
tution has left in perpetual charge of the nation, in the Museum alone,
property acquired out of its private fund (and to which it has appar-
ently the same title) which is probably now more than equal in value to
the whole amount of the Smithsonian bequest.

THE EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE MUSEUM. ~~ -

The work of the Museum, if it only performed the functions of an
institution for scientific investigation, would be of sufficient value to
justify its maintenance and extension.

As a matter of fact, it not only performs these functions but also does
a very great deal to render the resources of science available to the
public at large.

Professor Huxley’s definition of a museum was that it is “a consulta-
tive library of objects.”

The National Museum is a consultative library for the scientific man,
and it is Something more. It aims to be an agency for the instruction
of the people of the whole country, and to keep especially in mind the
needs of those whose time is not devoted to the study of science.

The spirit in which the work of the Museum is being carried on was
voiced in the address of one of its officers before the American Histori-
cal Association at its recent meeting in this city, in which if was said:

(1) That public institutions of this kind are not intended for the few, but
Sor the enlightenment and education of the masses.

(2) That the public has a right to full participation in the results of the
work of the scientific establishments which they are helping to maimtain.

(3) That one of the chief duties of the officers of these instutions ts to pro-
vide means by which such results may be presented in an attractive as well
as an intelligible form.

No scientific institution is more thoroughly committed to the work of
the diffusion of knowledge than is the Smithsonian Institution, and no
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 17

department of its activity is more capable of usefulness in this direc-
tion than is the National Museum.

The benefits of the Museum are extended not only to the specialists
in its laboratories and to the hundreds of thousands of visitors, from
all parts of the United States who pass its doors each year, but to local
institutions and their visitors throughout the country.

In accordance with long-sanctioned usage, the duplicate specimens
in the Museum are made up into sets and distributed to schools and
museums, accurately named, and of great service, both for museum and
class-room use.

The reports of the Smithsonian Institution will show how many hun-
dred thousands of objects have been thus distributed during the past

-twenty years. Hivery museum in the United States has profited in
this way, and by its system of exchange the Museum has, while enrich-
ing itself, contributed largely to the stores of every important scientific
museum in the world.

Not only are specimens thus sent out, but aid is rendered in other
ways. Within the last year not less than forty local museums in the
United States were supplied with working plans of cases in use in the
Museum, and similar sets of plans have been supplied within the past
few years to national museums in other countries.

Not only do the people of the country at large profit by the work of
the Smithsonian, as made available to local institutions, but they profit
directly, and personally to a very considerable extent.

The curator of each department in the Museum is expected to be an
- authority in his own line of work, and the knowledge of the whole staff
_of experts is thus placed without cost at the service of every citizen.

B.—ORGANIZATION AND SCOPE OF THE MUSEUM.

The National Museum is under the direction of the Smithsonian In-
stitution, which is governed by an establishment consisting of the
President of the United States and his Cabinet, the Commissioner of
Patents, and the Board of Regents, which latter is composed of the
Vice-President, Chief-Justice of the United States, three members of
the Senate, three members of the House of Representatives, and six
other citizens not members of Congress, two of whom are residents of
the city of Washington.

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to whom is intrusted
the actual management of its affairs, is by law the “keeper of the col-
lections.” The staff at the present time is composed of the Assistant
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in charge of the National
Museum, and twenty-seven curators and acting curators, seventeen of
whom receive no salary from the Museum appropriation. There are
also twelve administrative departments.

18 - REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The collections of the Museum are made up, in large part, of the
following materials:

1. The natural history and anthropological collections, accumulated
since 1850 by the efforts of the officers and correspondents of the Smith-
sonian Institution.

2. The collections of the Wilkes exploring expedition, the Perry ex-
pedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions.

3. The collections of the scientific officers of the Pacific Railroad sur-
vey, the Mexican boundary survey, and of the surveys carried on by the
Engineer Corps of the Army.

4. The collections of the U. S. geological surveys under the direc-
tion of the U.S. geologists, ce King, and Powell.

5. The collections of the U. 8S. fish Commission.

-6. The gifts by foreign Governments to the Museum or to the Presi-
dent or other public officers of the United States, who are fordidden by
law to retain such gifts in their private posessions.

7. The collections made by the United States to illustrate the animal
and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of the native
races of the country, on the occasion of the International Exhibition at
Philadelphia in 1876, and the fishery collections disp]ayed by the United
States at the International Fisheries Exhibition at Berlin in 1880 and
at London in 1883,

8. The collections given by the Governments of the several foreign
nations, thirty in number, which participated in the exhibition at eRe
- delphia in 1876.

9. The industrial collections given by numerous manufacturing and
commercial houses of Europe and America, at the time of the Philadel-
phia Exhibition and subsequently.

10. The material received, in exchange for duplicate specimens, from
the museums in Europe and America, at the time of the Philadelphia
Exhibition and subsequently.

In connection with the general work of administration there is in the
Museum a library, a chemical laboratory, a photographic establishment,
and various workshops for taxidermy, modeling, and for the ida
tion of skeletons for exhibition. In connection with the department
of art and industry two preparators are constantly employed.

The publications of the Museum consist of (1) The Annual Report;
(2) The Proceedings of the United States National Museum; (3) The
Bulletin of the United States National Museum; (4) The series of circu-
lars. These have, in part, been reprinted in the volumes of the Smith-
sonian Miscellaneous Collections,

C.—SPECIAL TOPICS OF THE YEAR.

THE CINCINNATI EXHIBITION.

By act of Congress, approved May 28, 1888,* the Smithsonian Institu-
tion was directed to participate in the Centennial Exposition of the
Ohio Valley and Central States, and the latter months of the fiscal year
have been devoted by the curators to the preparation of special exhib-
its. The fourth of July has been announced as the date of opening the
exhibition. Very little time, therefore, remains for the completion of
this work.

THE PROPOSED STATUE TO PROFESSOR BAIRD.

On December 12, 1887, a billt was introduced into the Senate by Sen-
ator Morrill, appropriating $15,000 for the erection of a bronze statue
of Professor Baird, the late Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
This bill passed the Senate on February 9, but failed to come up for
action in the House of Representatives.

THE CAPRON COLLECTION.

For a number of years the collection of lacquers, bronzes, carved ivo-
ries, coins, and other works of art, obtained in Japan by the late Gen-
eral Horace Capron, has been deposited in the National Museum. It is
the property of his heirs, who are desirous of selling it to the Govern-
ment. On December 21, 1887, a billi providing for its purchase was in-
troduced into the Senate by Hon. Daniel Voorhees, of Indiana. This
bill was favorably acted upon in the Senate, but did not come to a vote
in the House of Representatives.

INCREASING GROWTH OF THE COLLECTIONS.

During the last three years (since the adoption of the standard of the
fiscal year by the Smithsonian Institution) the number of accession
“lots” received has been 4,623, including nearly five hundred and
twenty thousand specimens. ‘The last accession number in June, 1888,
was 20831.

REARRANGEMEMENT OF THE EXHIBITION HALLS.

The appearance of the exhibition halls has been, it is thought, very
much improved during the year. Some new methods of installation
have been successfully inaugurated in some of the departments. Sev-
eral new forms of cases have also been adopted. The co-operation of the

tion of Oriental Antiquities. Other new sections have been organized.

TRANSFER OF DISBURSEMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF THE
INTERIOR.

The rapid growth of the Museum for several years past has shown it
to be desirable that the direct administration of the Museum appropria-
tions should be transferred from the Department of the Interior to the
hands of the Smithsonian Institution, the legal custodian of the Museum
and its collections. This matter was fully discussed at the last annual
meeting of the Board of Regents, and a conference between the Chan-
cellor of the Smithsonian Institution, the Secretary of the Interior, and
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution was held on February 13.
Some correspondence followed between the Secretary of the Interior
and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in which the former
consented to the proposed transfer. This correspondence is published
in the report of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to the
Board of Regents for this year. *

A letter was then addressed to the chairman of the House Committee
on Appropriations,* setting forth the facts in the case, and the changes
proposed. These were indicated in the sundry civil bill, and, ifapproved
by Congress, the disbursement of money appropriated for the National
Museum will hereafter be made by an officer designated by the Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution.

THE COLLECTION OF LIVING ANIMALS.

Early in the year preparations were made for the establishment of a
department of living animals inthe Museum, inorder to afford to the tax-
idermists an opportunity of observing the habits and positions of the
various species, with a view to using the knowledge thus acquired in
the mounting of skins for the exhibition series of mammals. Active
work in this department commenced in October. Mr. Willliam T.
Hornaday was appointed curator.

The U.S. Fish Commission kindly tendered the use of one a its
special cars then about to be sent to the far west, for the transporta-
tion of living animals to Washington, and Mr. Hornaday visited several
of the northwestern States and Territories. The expedition was very
successful, and a large number of deer, bears, foxes, lynxes, eagles, and
other animals were obtained as a nucleus for the collection.

D.—THE CONDITION OF THE COLLECTIONS.
INCREASE OF THE COLLECTIONS.

Since the erection of the present Museum building in 1881 there have
been more than 12,000 accessions to the collections, chiefly by gift.
From 1859 to 1880 the accessions numbered 8,475. It is thus evident

* Pages 8-11. * Page 8, ibid.

~
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. yal

that during the last eight years the number of accessions has been half
as large again aS during the previous twenty-one years. Many of the
more recent ones are of very great extent. Among these may be men-
tioned the bequest of the late Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, which con-
tains 20,000 specimens of shells, besides minerals and otier objects ;
the Jeftreys collection of fossil and recent shells of Europe, including
40,000 specimens; the Stearnscollection of mollusks, numbering 100,000
specimens ; the Riley collection of insects containing 150,000 specimens ;
the Catlin collection of Indian paintings, about 500 in number ; the collec-
tion of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the transporta-
tion of which to Washington several freight-cars were required.

There are also the extensive collections obtained at the Fisheries Hx-
hibitions at Berlin and London and at the close of the New Orleans
Cotton Centennial; the Shepard collection of meteorites; the Wilson
collection of archeological objects (more than 12,000 specimens); the
Lorillard collection of Central American antiquities, and very many
others nearly as extensive. In addition to these are the annual accre-
tions from the work of the U. S. Fish Commission, the U. 8. Geological
Survey, and the Bureau of Ethnology, as wellas the contributions from
Several expeditions of the Government, from Army and Navy officers,
and from other Government officials. These have been very extensive,
and are yearly increasing in bulk and value.

The accessions during the year are 1,481 in number (19351-20831).
These consist, in the aggregate, of more than 137,000 specimens. A
table showing approximately the number of specimens in the Museum
in 1882 and received each year since is given in the next paragraph, de-
voted to the census of the collections.

CENSUS OF THE COLLECTIONS.

One of the most striking features in connection with the afiairs of the
Museum is the remarkable increase in the extent of its collections. This
increase is in a large degree spontaneous, only a very small sum of money
being available for the purchase of new material. As might be supposed,
a considerable proportion of the objects given duplicate material already
on hand, and although these contributions can with the utmost advan-
tage be used for distribution to other museums and schools, they do
not increase, as much as is desired, the value of the collections fer
etudy by specialists and for general educational purposes. The need
of a larger fund for the purchase of specimens is yearly more manifest.
Exceedingly important material is constantly offered to us at prices
very much below what it would cost to obtain it by collecting, and, in
many instances, when refused, it is eagerly taken by the museums and
institutions of Europe. The extent and character of the recent addi-
tions to the collections may, perhaps, be better shown by the appended
table than in any other way. This table shows comparatively the re-
‘sults of a census of the collections taken annually for the past six
years, and from it it appears that the number of specimens, or of lots of

specimens, on hand at the close of the year is more than 2,800,000,
These figures are in many instances estimated, and are always subject

to revision.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY 23

it will be seen from this table that the number of specimens at the
close of 1882 was approximately 193,362, and that this total has been 1n-
creased during the next five and a half years to nearly 3,000,000. In
other words, for twenty-two years (1859-1881) the average number of
specimens received annually was less than 8,800; while during the last
five years anda halfthe average number of specimens received annually
has been nearly 475,000.

CATALOGUE ENTRIES.

The cataloguing of specimens is attended to by the curators of the
several departments in the Museum. Each department has its book or
set of books for this purpose, and until the’catalogue entry has been
made, the routine of recording the receipt of specimens is not complete.
A catalogue entry may relate to a single specimen or toa large number
of specimens, as, for instance, frequently happens in connection with
marine invertebrates, insects, fossils, and other groups of objects. The
number of catalogue entries during the year is, therefore, no indication

24 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, i888.
INSTALLATION OF COLLECTIONS AND ASSIGNMENT OF SPACE.

Several attractive additions to the exhibition series in the Museum
have been made during the past year, and the general appearance of
the exhibition halls is now very satisfactory. An interesting contri-
bution, consisting of a series of India proofs, from the Bureau of En-
graving and Printing, has been received. On these are exhibited the
backs and faces of all the current bonds and currency notes issued by
the United States, illustrating each denomination of Treasury notes,
gold and silver certificates, from $1 to $10,000, and coupon and regis-
tered bonds from $10 to $50,000. To the collection of historical relies
has been added an object of rare interest. This is one of the thirteen
pamphlets signed by George Washington, John Adams, and colonial
delegates, entitled “Original Association of Congress, October 20, 1774”.
By this association the delegates pledged the colonies not to import
British merchandise after December 1, 1774. The pamphlet consists of
nine printed pages, more than two of which are devoted to the auto-
graph signatures of the delegates. During the year the Smithsonian
Institution has placed in the Museum its collection of portraits of scien-
tific and literary men and other prominent personages. ‘This series in-
cludes nearly 2,500 photographs, and is exceedingly valuable as a nu-
cleus for a national gallery of portraits of representative men. The
entire collection of materia medica has during the year been removed
from the west north range of the Museum to the east-south range, and
this transfer has made necessary a rearrangement of the collection.
As mentioned in the report of Mr. True, curator of mammals, the idea
of representing the more important mammals of North America by
groups, accompanied by accessories indicative of the habits and natural
surroundings of the species, which had been for some time under con-
sideration, has been partly carried into execution, five groups having
been placed in the exhibition hall, one of which, a group of bisons, is
undoubtedly the finest work of its kind in the world. Work has been
continued in the installation of the ethnological collection in the east
and west halls. It has been impossible to make very rapid progress in
the systematic rearrangement of the exhibition series of birds, but a
satisfactory beginning in that direction has been made. The removal
of the collection of reptiles and fishes from the west end of the Smith-
sonian Institution has been necessitated, in order that that portion of
the building might be made fire-proof. This work having been com-
pleted, much time was spent in replacing these collections. An exhi-
bition series of fishes has been installed in the west hall of the Smith-
sonian building. The collection of reptiles is still without exhibition
space. The mollusk collection in the Museum is now in some respects,
Superior to any in the world. Important additions are constantly being
made to it, and the work of installing an exhibition series of specimens
is progressing steadily. The Department of Insects has placed on ex-
2

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 25

hibition a series of Coleoptera. Numerous additions to the exhibition
series of osteological material have been made. The mineralogical col-
lection has steadily increased, and additions have been made to the ex-
hibition series of meteorites and to the gem collection. The eases con-
taining the exhibition material of this department are very attractive
and excite much interest on the partof visitors. More than two months
were spent by the curator of lithology and his assistants in rearranging
the exhibition material belonging tothe department. The arrangement
decided upon was such that the moving of nearly every specimen in the
hall was made necessary. Since this rearrangement many important
additions to the series have been made. A change in the space occu-
pied by the Department of Metallurgy was made early in the year, the
whole of the southwest court being assigned to the department, and the
time and energy of the curator and his assistants, during the greater
part of the year, have been devoted to the work of rearranging the
exhibition material.

The Department of Living Animals, recently organized, has created
wide interest. Many interesting specimens have already been obtained.
The most important of these is a pair of buffaloes, presented by Hon. EB.
G. Blackford, of New York City.

Several important changes have been made in the assignment of space
in the exhibition halls. The collection of modern ceramics and several
special collections, such as the Capron collection of Japanese objects
and the Hippisley collection of Chinese porcelains, have been placed on
the west side of the north hall. A wall case, extending along the en-
tire west side of the north hall, is devoted to collections representing
the races of men and their domestic life. The scope of the collection
belonging to the section of steam transportation has been enlarged to
include transportation generally, and also to embrace the subject of
engineering. The space assigned to these collections is the eastern end
of the éast hall.

The collections of prehistoric anthropology, of marine invertebrates,
of fishes, of mollusks, and of reptiles are still retained in the Smithso-
nian building.

The north end of the west hall, from which the collection of modern
pottery has been removed, is devoted to the section of Oriental Antiqui-
ties. Thecollection of metallurgy, including that portion of it which
occupies the west end of the west hall, has been removed to the south-
west court, the collection of minerals having been transferred to the
southwest range in lieu of the metallurgical collection. In the south-
east court, space has been assigned to the vertebrate and invertebrate
fossil collections and to the Department of Botany.

E.—THE MUSEUM STAFF.

The staff of the Museum includes two classes—scientifie and adminis-

trative—the former consisting of curators, honorary curators, acting

- curators, assistant curators, assistants and aids; the latter including the

financial and elerical force, and the superintendent of buildings with
the watchmen, mechanies, and laborers under his supervision.

THE SCIENTIFIC STAFF.

There are now in the Museum thirty-one organized departments and
sections under the care of twenty-seven curators and assistant curators.
Of these custodians, ten receive salaries from the Museum appropria-
tions. Of the remaining seventeen, four are detailed from the U.S.
Fish Commission, two from the U.S. Army, one from the U.S. Navy,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. PA

five from the U. S. Geological Survey, and one from the Bureau of Eth-
nology.

Dr. Charles Rau, for many years in charge of the archeological col-
lection in the Museum, died on June 25, 1887. He was in 1881 appointed
curator of the Department of Antiquities in the National Museum. His
health gave way in 1836, and in July, 1887, he went to the hospital of
the University of Pennsylvania, where he died. His body was brought
to Washington, and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery. Dr. Rau has
been succeeded by Mr. Thomas Wilson, who recived his appointment
as honorary curator on December 1. In November Dr. H. G. Beyer,
U.S. Navy, honorary curator of the Section of Materia Medica, was
ordered to other duties, and Dr. James M. Flint, the first curator of
this collection, has again taken charge. The Museum has commenced
the formation of a collection of casts of Assyrian and Babylonian an-
tiquities in association with the Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Paul
Haupt, professor of Semitic languages in the Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, was in February appointed: honorary curator, Dr. Cyrus Adler,
of the same university, consenting to act as honorary assistant curator.
The Section of Transportation, under the care of Mr. J. E. Watkins,
has now reached that point in its history where it may take rank with
the other sections of the Department of Arts and Industries. On May
9 the Department of Living Animals was organized, with Mr. W. T.
Hornaday, chief taxidermist, as curator. On June 8 Charles Wickliffe
Beckham, formerly an assistant in the Department of Birds, died. He
made several valuable contributions to American ornithological liter-
_ ature.

In other respects the personnel of the scientific departments in the
Museum remains the same as in 1887, as shown in the following classi-
fied list:

THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF.

There have been no important changes in the administrative corps
during the year.

Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk, acted as representative of the Smithson-
ian Institution at the Minneapolis Industrial Exposition.

F.—REVIEW OF WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENTS.

The energies of several of the curators have been devoted during the
greater part of the year to the preparation of exhibits for the Cincin-
nati Exposition. A report upon the participation of the Smithsonian
Institution in this exposition, including statements in regard to the
several exhibits, will be published in the report for 1889. This work
has seriously interferéd with the regular Museum duties of the curators,
and has consequently diminished the amount of original research in the
scientific departments of the Museum. 1t is a matter of regret that so
few of the special collections in the Department of Arts and Industries
have been formally reported upon this year. In many cases the cura-
tors of these collections are performing this work in an honorary ca-
pacity, and are compelled to devote the greater part of their time to the
accomplishment of work connected with their official duties. Following
the custom adopted in previous reports, I have briefly reviewed the
work of each department separately.

* Honorary.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 29
ARTS AND INDUSTRIES.

The organization of a new section of this department has been ar-
ranged. Dr. Paul Haupt, of Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, has
been appointed honorary curator of the collection of Oriental Antiquities,
with Dr. Cyrus Adler, of the same university, as honorary assistant
curator.

In connection with this arrangement the following circular, which
has been approved by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, has
been published by the Johns Hopkins University :

Memorandum of the understanding between the National Museum and the Johns Hopkins
: University.

The National Museum at Washington has undertaken the formations of study col-
lections of casts of Assyrian and Babylonian antiquities in assoviation with the Johns
Hopkins University of Baltimore. The two institutions will co-operate for this pur-
pose, upon the following basis:

Ist. The Museum stands ready to make fac-similes and casts of Assyrian and Baby-
lonian antiquities.

2d. The attempt will first be made to obtain copies of the Assyrian antiquities pre-
served in this country.

3d. For the present the Museum will confine itself to the reproduction, in fac-simile
and flat casts, of Assyrian and Babylonian seal cylinders.

4th. The Johus Hopkins University will attend to the proper arrangement and
cataloguing of the Assyrian collection in the National Museum, under the supervision
of Dr. Haupt, professor of Semitic languages, and Dr. Adler, assistant in the Semitic
courses, who will also co-operate in the work of forming the collection and securing
the loan of objects to be copied.

5th. Three sets of fac-similes and casts will be made in each case: the first to be
preserved in the National Museum at Washington; the second to be transferred to
the Semitic library of Johns Hopkins University, at Baltimore; and the third to be
presented to the owners of the objects loaned.

Numerous and valuable additions have been made to the collection
of graphic arts, under the energetic curatorship of Mr. 8S. R. Koehler.
An interesting exhibit of illustrations of engraving, etching, and of the
photo-mechanical processes, has been prepared by Mr. Koehler for the
Cincinnati Exposition. <A catalogue of this collection has been pub-
lished in the appendix to the tenth volume of the Proceedings U.S.
National Museum.* After the close of the Exposition the collection
will be permanently installed in the National Museum.

The collection of Materia Medica is now under the care of the former
honorary curator, Dr. James M. Flint, U. 8. Navy, Dr. H. G. Beyer, U.
S. Navy, having been ordered to other duty by the Navy Department.
A collection of Corean drugs has been purchased, and is of much im-
portance in completing the series of drugs from that country. The en-
tire collection is now installed in the east-south range. During the
year 246 specimens have been added to the collection.

The collection of historical and personai relies, under the care of Mr. A.
H. Clark, has received some interesting additions, among which is the war
saddle of General Grant, deposited by General A. H. Markland. From

Mr. Stephen Vail has been received a piece of the original wire over

*Pp. 701-731.

30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

which a message was sent in 1840 during the experiments of Professor
Morse.

The War Department has-transferred to the National Museum sev-
eral interesting relics, including a large section of an oak tree riddled
with bullets from the battle-field at Appomattox Court-House. The
original piaster model of the bronze statue of George Washington, de-
signed by William Rudolf O’Donovan, has been received. A pair of
silver-mounted flint-lock pistols, once the property of General Lafay-
ette, has been deposited by Mr. William Burnett. The Smithsonian
Institution has transferred to the Museum its collection of portraits of
American and foreign men of science and of persons prominent in politi-
eal and civil life. The Museum had aiready accumulated engraved and
photographie portraits, and plans are now being arranged for the for-
mation of a comprehensive collection, in which especial attention will
be given to the representative men of America.

The collection of coins, medals, and paper money has been gradually
increased. <A series of proofs of all the current bonds and currency
notes issued by the United States, and of gold and silver certificates,
coupons, and registered bonds, has, through the courtesy of Hon. E. O.
Graves, been presented by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

During the year, 1,006 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 552 entries have been made in the catalogue.

ETHNOLOGY.

Prof. Otis T. Mason, curator, has pushed forward work in connection
with the ethnological series, the object of which is to show representa-
tives of all the races of men. The arrangement of the Eskimo col-
lection, which was commenced last year by Lieut. 'T. Dix Bolles, U.S.
Navy, has been completed. The curator is arranging for comparison
the bows and arrows from all parts of the world, with a view to prepar-
ing an extensive monograph upon the subject. Prof. G. Stanley Hall
investigated the subject of mythology from the psycho-physical point
of view, and was accorded the use of the ethnological collections of the
Museum. An exceedingly valuable collection of objects from Easter
Island has been placed in the Museum by Paymaster W. J. Thomson,
U.S. Navy.

It is the intention of the curator to prepare each year for publication
in the Museum report one or more papers relating to special collections
illustrating the arts and industries of the North American Indians. In
the report for 1884, two papers were published, on Throwing-sticks and
on Basket-work of the North American Aborigines. In the report for
1887 were two papers by Professor Mason on Cradles of the American
Aborigines and the Human Beast of Burden.

During the year, 1,700 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 790 entries have been made 1n the catalogue.
- REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ol
AMERICAN ABORIGINAL POTTERY.

Mr. W. H. Holmes, honorary curator, has made a study of the origin
and significance of the textile ornament upon the pottery of the east-
ern United States, and of the relation between the ancient and recent
ceramic remains of northern New Mexico. The work: of cataloguing
and installing the immense collection of prehistoric pottery has prac-
tically been completed. Four collections of considerable importance
have been received during the year: from Col. James Stevenson, of the
Bureau of Ethnology, from Mr. James Mooney, from Mr. J. A. MeNiel,
and trom Rev. Ward Batchelor, respectively.

During the year 1,100 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 1,541 entries have been made in the catalogue, including the re-
cording of collections which had been previously received.

PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY.

The curatorship of this department became vacant in July by the
death of Dr. Charles Rau, and on December 1, 1887, Mr. Thomas Wil-
son was appointed curator. Mr. Wilson had been consul of the United
States in Belgium and France, and had profited by his opportunities for
the study of prehistoric anthropology in the localities in those countries
which had become renowned for their bearings upon this science. He
had while there made a collection of objects connected with prehistoric
anthropology in Europe, amounting in number to 10,288 specimens,
which he has deposited in the National Museum, and of which mention
is made in the last annual report.

Dr. Rau bequeathed to the library 715 bound volumes and 1,722 un-
bound books and pamphlets. He also gave 89 modern Indian objects,
474 of European prehistoric objects, and 1,367 American prehistoric
objects, to the ethnographical and archeological collections in the Mu-
seum.

The special work of the curator during the year has consisted in gath-
ering information concerning the existence and geographic distribution
of paleolithic implements in the United States, it being the curator’s
desire to assist in the solution of the problem relating to the existence
of man on the American continent, especially in the United States, dur-
jng the paleolithic period of the stone age. In this connection a circu-
lar (No. 36) was prepared by the Smithsonian Institution for distribu-
tion among persons interested in archeological matters. Several hun-
dred replies were received. From these has been compiled a paper, in-
eluding a discussion of the correspondence upon this subject and of de-
ductions made therefrom, which is published in Section m1 of this Re-
port.

During the year 6,972 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 2,696 entries have been made in the catalogue.
32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888,
MAMMALS,

The chief feature of the year’s work in the Department of Mammals
has been the rearrangement of the exhibition series in new cases, and
considerable progress has been made. Mr. True, curator, reports that
there has been received a smaller number of donations than in previous
years, but that some excellent material has been obtained by purchase
and exchange. <A valuable series of deer-skins from Honduras was eol-
lected by Mr. Charles H. Townsend. A fine male Harnessed Antelope
was presented by the Zoological Society of Philadelphia. Nearly sixty
specimens have been mounted by the taxidermists.

During the year 247 specimens (skins and aleoholies) have been added
to the collection, and 337 entries have been made in the catalogue.

BIRDS.

Mr. Robert Ridgway, curator, has prepared a review of the Mexican
and Central American members of six families. Collections of birds
from the Lower Amazon and from islands in the Caribbean Sea and on
the coast of Honduras have been determined. The curator has written
a monograph of the genera Dendrocincla and Psittacula.

Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, assistant curator, has continued his studies
of the Japanese collection of birds belonging to the Museum, and has
investigated several groups of European birds. He has aiso reported
upon two collections of birds from the Hawaiian Islands.

For more than two months the time of the curator and his assistants
was devoted to the preparation of an exhibit for the Cincinnati Exposi-
tion.

Both the exhibition and study series of this department have steadily
improved during the year, and progress is being rapidly made in the
systematic arrangement and classification of the immense amount of
material which has been received both during this and previous years.

The curator of birds has called special attention to the fact that sev-
eral species of North American birds are fast becoming extinet, and has
emphasized the desirability of obtaining additional specimens of these
species before it is too late. These species are: Great Auk, Plautus
impinnis ; Labrador Duck, Camptolaimus labradorius ; Heath Hen, Tym-
panuchus cupido; Passenger Pigeon, Ectopistes migratorius ; California
Vulture, Pseudogryphus californianus ; Carolina Paroquet, Conurus car-
olinensis ; and Ivory-billed Woodpecker, Campephilus prineipalis.

The first of these, the Great Auk, is now believed to be entirely ex-
tinct.

No specimens of the Labrador Duck have been taken since April,
1871. Formerly specimens were occasionally taken about Grand Manan
Island, near Hastport, Maine.

Until within the last two or three years specimens of the Heath Hen
were occasionally found on Martha’s Vineyard and on the island of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. on

Naushon. Mr. William Brewster thinks that its extinction is due to
the numerous foxes found on those islands.

The Passenger Pigeon is still found in small numbers, but it is thought
that it will not be many years before this species will be entirely ex-
tinct.

The California Vulture is becoming rarer each year. Large numbers
of these birds have been destroyed by eating poisoned meat intended
for other animals.

The Carolina Paroquet is being rapidly destroyed for its plumage,
and few specimens are now left. Whole flocks can be killed easily, since,
when one has been wounded, the remainder will stay by it and can not
be frightened away.

_ The Ivory-billed Woodpecker is rapidly diminishing in numbers. No
special reason has been assigned for its decrease.

Capt. Charles E. Bendire, curator of birds’ eggs, has added to the
above list the name of Pallas’s Cormorant, Phalacrocorax perspicillatus.
This species became extinct about thirty-five years ago on the Com-
mander Islands. It is especially desirable to retain specimens of this
bird, since only three skins have been preserved. It is believed that
no skeleton or egg of this bird exists in any collection. This is a very
fine bird, the largest of its family, and is provided with a lustrous plu-
mage of burnished green and purple.

In June, 1888, the Museum lost by death the services of Charles
Wickliffe Beckham. During his brief connection with the Museum
Mr. Beckham proved himself to be an intelligent and valuable assistant.

During the year 1,497 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 2,206 entries have been made in the catalogue.

BIRDS’ EGGS.

Capt. Charles EH. Bendire, U. S. Army, honorary curator, has contin-
ued the work of measuring, numbering, and rearranging the collection,
and 1,778 specimens have been thus disposed of during the year. The
relabeling of the reserve series, in accordance with the nomenclature
adopted by the American Ornithologists’ Union, has also been com-
menced.

The principal contributions during the year have been received from
_ Lieut. H. C. Benson, U. S. Army, Dr. J. C. Merrill, U.S. Army, Dr. A.
K. Fisher, and Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of the Department of Agriculture ;
Mr. F. Stephens, of San Bernardino, California, and Col. N. G. Goss, of
‘Topeka, Kansas.

During the year 1,882 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 487 entries have been made in the catalogue.

REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS.

The operations of this department have been seriously interrupted by
the necessity of making some repairs in the west basement of the Smith-

H. Mis. 142, pt. 2——3
34 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

sonian building. This work lasted for several months. The entire re-
serve series has been transferred from the laboratory of the department
to store-rooms. After the repairs had been completed, the collection
was again transferred toits former position. This series has, to a great
extent, been relabeled and systematically arranged.

Studies upon the Batrachia in the Museum have been continued by
Prof. E. D. Cope, of Philadelphia.

The curator, Dr. H. C. Yarrow, has investigated the subject of rattle-
snake venom, with a view to determining its action upon animals, and
numerous experiments have been made with so-called antidotes for the
venom. A popular account of these experiments was published in
‘‘ Forest and Stream,” in May and June, 1888, and a final statement of
the results of his investigations will be published in a future report of
the Museum.

During the year 122 specimens have been added to the collection, and
83 entries have been made in the catalogue.

FISHES.

Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, honorary curator, was directed by the U.S.
Commissioner of Fisheries to investigate the fishes of Great Egg Har-
bor Bay, New Jersey, and in July, 1887, left Washington for that pur-
pose. The results of this investigation have been embodied in a paper
prepared by him for publication.

Great disorder to the collection has been caused by the necessary re-
moval of the exhibition series of fishes from the hall during the fire-proof-
ing of the west end of the Smithsonian building. Immediately after
the completion of this work the collections were returned to their places.

In 1888 Dr. Bean was ordered by the U.S. Commissioner of Fisheries
to join the U.S. Fish Commission schooner Grampus for the purpose of
investigating the southern mackerel fishery, and this cruise occupied
his time during May and June, 1888.

The growth of the collection in this department during the year
has been very satisfactory. Special work was accomplished on collec-
tions received from Ensign W. E. Safford, U. S. Navy, C. H. Townsend,
and Senor Don José Arechavaleta. A small collection of fishes from
Honduras was received from Mr. C. H. Townsend and reported upon.
The collections of fishes made by the U.S. Fish Commission steamer
Albatross and the U.S. Fish Commission schooner Grampus have been
catalogued and preserved. Types of several new species have been ob-
tained, and descriptions of these have been prepared for publication in
the Proceedings of the National Museum. The curator states in his
report that 62 accessions have been received, representing nearly every
State and Territory.

During the year 1,350 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 450 entries have been made in the catalogue,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 35
MOLLUSKS.

A large portion of the time of the curator and his corps of assist-
ants has been spent in unpacking, labeling, and repacking the large
and valuable coilection of mollusks bequeathed to the Smithsonian In-
stitution by the late Dr. Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia. This collection .
includes about 20,000 specimens, and a description of it will be found
in the report of Mr: William H. Dall, honorary curator.

Special investigations have been made in connection with the deep-
sea mollusks collected by the steamers Blake and Albatross on the east-
ern coast of the United States and among the Antilles. A study of the
fauna of the Miocene Silex beds of Tampa Bay has been made. Mr. Dall
has also found time to study the relations of the members of the Tertiary
mollusk fauna with the recent species of the coast.

The condition of the collection is now very satisfactory, and the curator
estimates that during the year 30,000 additional specimens have been
added.

Dr. BR. B. C. Stearns, adjunct curator, has devoted his time to arrang-
ing, classifying, and labeling the collections, and, in addition to the
routine work of the department, has prepared for publication several
papers based upon museum material. A list of these papers will be
found in Section Iv of this report.

During the year at least 30,000 specimens have been added to the
collection, and 11,799 entries (including Cenozoic fossils) have been made
in the catalogue books.

INSECTS.

Considerable progress has been made in connection with the arrange-
ment of material in the Department of Insects during the year. Owing
to lack of room it has not been possible to properly expand and arrange
the collections, and additional space is urgently needed. THarly in the
year the arrangement of Coleoptera and of the large Bombycid Lepi-
doptera was commenced. Studies were made of some of the genera of
the Noctuide. The annotative and critical overhauling of the Glover
plates, with the view of possibly preparing them for publication, occu-
pied a large part of the first half of the year.

Requests sent to this department for the determination of material
have been very numerous, and much time has been consumed in identi-
fying specimens. The questions submitted as to the life habits, methods
of collecting, and determination of insects, often require considerable
research. Prof.C. V. Riley, honorary curator, states in his report that
not less than one hundred and fifty letters, reporting names and habits
of specimens sent for determination, were written during the year. The
number of accessions received was not as large as last year, but their
value is fully equal to that of the accessions of the previous year. The
preservation of the material in this department requires great care, and
much time is required to protect these specimens from museum pests,
36 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The curator has visited Europe during the year, and consulted a number
of correspondents and specialists in reference to entomological work in
other museums.

Mr. J. B. Smith, assistant curator, has, in addition to performing the
routine work of the department, prepared for publication a number of
entomological papers, a list of which will be found in Section tv of this
Report. Several important investigations have been conducted during
the year by the curator, assistant curator, and co-workers of the de-
partment.

During the year about 10,000 specimens have been added to the col-
lection, and 56 entries have been made in the catalogue.

MARINE INVERTEBRATES.

In consequence of increased duties in connection with the work of
the U.S. Fish Commission, Mr. Rathbun, honorary curator of this de-
partment, has been unable to devote as much time as in previous years
to museum work. The repairs which have been made in the west por-
tion of the Smithsonian building have interfered seriously with the rou-
tine work of this department. The investigations of the curator have
related chiefly to subjects bearing more or less directly on problems
connected with the work of the U. 8. Fish Commission. Seventeen of
the thirty-three accessions received during the year were contributed
by or through the medium of the U.S. Fish Commission. The current
work of the department has been kept up and all the accessions of the
year have been properly cared for.

A large number of duplicate sets of specimens of marine invertebrates
have been distributed during the year to various schools and universi-
ties. This material has been courteously placed atethe disposal of the
Smithsonian Institution for this purpose by the U.S. Commissioner of
Fisheries. As in former years this department has received the benefit
of the co-operation of many eminent specialists, and members of the sci-
entific staff in the service of the U. 8. Fish Commission have rendered
very valuable assistance in their special lines of study. :

During the year about 65,000 specimens have been added to the col-
lection, and 1,021 entries have been made in the catalogue.

COMPARATIVE ANATOMY.

No special investigations have been made in connection with the ma-
terial in this department, the work of research having been necessarily
subordinated to that of identifying, cataloguing, and preserving the
specimens received during the year.

The total number of specimens received during the year is 536, in-
cluding skulls, and skeletons of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes.
One of the most important accessions is a series of bones of the extinct
Dodo, received from Cambridge, England.

The work of labeling the exhibition series has made progress.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 37
PALEOZOIC INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS.

The principal work of the year in the department of paleozoic fossils
has been the preparation by Mr. C. D. Walcott, honorary curator, of a
representative series of fossils from each of the larger divisions of the
Paleozoic strata. The series, comprising 10,955 specimens, is now on
exhibition, and has been provided with labels.

The curator was absent from the city seven months of the year in con-
nection with the work of the U. S. Geological Survey. During the re-
mainder of the year he devoted a large portion of his time to the prep-
aration of a paper on “ The Taconic System of Emmons, and the use of
the name Taconic in Geologic Nomenclature.”

During the year 158 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 350 entries have been made in the catalogue.

MESOZOIC INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS.

Dr. C. A. White, honorary curator, states in his annual report that it

has been necessary to devote the greater part of his time to the paleon-
tological work of the U. 8. Geological Survey. A great deal has been
accomplished, however, in the identification of material sent for exami-
nation and in replying to letters addressed to the Museum asking for
information upon paleontological subjects.
_ The most important accession of the year has been the Lea collection
of fossils, forming a part of the extensive collections bequeathed by the
late Dr. Isaac Lea to the Smithsonian Institution. A card catalogue
of the collection has been made. No specimens have yet been placed
upon exhibition, although a series of specimens representing the Meso-
zoiec formation of North America is ready for exhibition as soon as cases
shall have been provided. Some important papers have been published
during the year by the curator. These are referred to in Section Iv
(Bibliography) of this Report.

During the year 150 specimens have been added to the collection, and
30 entries have been made in the catalogue.

FOSSIL AND RECENT PLANTS.

Almost the entire time of Mr. Lester F. Ward, honorary curator, has
been devoted to his work as an officer of the U. S. Geological Survey.
Considerable progress has been made by Prof. Leo Lesquereux, of
Columbus, Ohio, in the identification of material collected in Oregon
by Capt. Charles E. Bendire. Professor Lesquereux’s report was edited
and prepared for publication in the Proceedings of the U.S. National
Museum by Mr. F. H. Knowlton, assistant curator of this department.

Mr. Knowlton continued his studies on the internal structure of fossil
plants and reached some interesting results. He also made an exami-
nation of fossil wood collected in the Yellowstone National Park.

In July, 1887, the curator, accompanied by the assistant curator, left
Washington on an expedition to the Yellowstone National Park, the
38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

primary object of this expedition being to collect fossil plants in this
region. About 25 species of mosses and 300 species of flowering plants
were also obtained.

During the past two years a special study of the flora of the District
of Columbia has been made, one of the results of which is that there
are now in the herbarium about 1,000 species of plants from this locality.
The curator states that several valuable accessions have been received,
the principal one being the collection made by Edward Palmer, in
Mexico. This contains 768 species. Second in size, but none the less
valuable, is the Mexican collection made by C. G. Pringle.

The routine work of the department has been well attended to, and
the present state of the collection is very satisfactory.

During the year 1,538 specimens of fossil plants have been added to
the collection, and 19 entries have been made in the catalogue. There
have also been received 6,000 specimens of recent plants. These have
been catalogued under 347 numbers.

MINERALS.

Prof. F. W. Clarke, honorary curator, reports that gifts of minerals
have been received from many sources, and that valuable additions
have been made to the collections of meteorites and gems.

A collection of gems and precious stones was prepared for exhibition
at the Cincinnati Exposition, and some valuable additional specimens
were obtained.

The largest accession of the year is the collection bequeathed by the
late Dr. Isaac Lea. The U.S. Geological Survey has, as usual, made
large and valuable contributions to the collection, especially important
being the minerals collected by officers of the Survey at Denver, Colo-
rado.

The greater part of the routine work of the department has been car-
ried on by Mr. William H. Yeates, assistant curator, who has devoted
much time to cataloguing and labeling.

During the year 3,295 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 347 entries have been made in the catalogue.

LITHOLOGY AND PHYSICAL GEOLOGY.

The curator, Mr. George P. Merrill, has devoted the greater part of
his time to the preparation of the exhibition, study, and duplicate series.
He has also completed the manuscript for a hand-book of the building-
stone collection. This contains not only a catalogue of the Museum
collection, but also a description of the principal quarries in the United
States, information in regard to the structure and composition of rocks,
methods of quarrying, results of pressure tests, and other associated
subjects.

During the year the storage material belonging to this department
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 39

has been thoroughly overhauled, with a view to eliminating all worth-
less specimens.

The preparation of sets of duplicate material has been commenced,
in order to meet the requests of educational institutions for collections
of this kind.

Special researches have been made upon the Montville serpentine
and the peridotite from Little Deer Island on the coast of Maine, and
upon a new meteorite from California. Papers relating to these speci-
mens have been prepared for publication in the Proceedings of the
National Museum.

The curator has paid especial attention to the stratigraphic, struct-
ural, and dynamical geology exhibition series, and many important
additions have been made during the year. In the annual report of
this department, seventeen accessions are mentioned as of especial im-
portance, among which are a large collection ofseruptive rocks, miner-
als, veins, and joint formations collected by the curator in New Jersey,
Rhode Island, Massazhusetts, and Maine, and an interesting series of
Devonian marbles and eruptive rocks sent in exchange by Mr. RB. N.
Worth, curator of petrology in the Plymouth Institute at Plymouth,
England. Valuable contributions have also been received from officers
of the U. S. Geological Survey.

During the year, 1,000 specimens have been received.

METALLURGY.

The energies of the curator, Mr. F. P. Dewey, and his assistants,
have been devoted during the year to work incident to the change in
the location of the exhibition space of the department. A complete
reorganization of the geographical series of ores has been effected, and
some changes have been made in the systematic collections in economic
geology and metallurgy. The curator has prosecuted special researches
jn regard to the perfecting of the Hampe method of determining sub-
oxide of copper in metallic copper, in order to carry on a further inves-
tigation upon the refining of pig-copper. He has also made a complete
chemical examination of the large collection from the Lone Elm Smelt-
ing Works at Joplin, Missouri. To accomplish this it was necessary to
make sixteen chemical analyses.

During the year, 101 accessions were received. Of this number, 72
consisted of specimens sent for examination and report. Two impor-
tant collections were contributed by the U. 8S. Geological Survey. One
of these was collected by Mr. J. S. Curtis in connection with the
preparation of a report upon the silver-lead district of Kureka, Nevada;
the other was collected by Mr. S. F. Emmons, who is preparing a report
upon the geology of Leadville, Colorado.

The total number of specimens in the department is about 51,000, of
which 18,000 are in the exhibition series.
AO REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

During the year 2,412 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 1,413 entries have been made in the catalogue.

LIVING ANIMALS.

This department was formally organized May 12, 1888, Mr. William
T. Hornaday being appointed curator. For a long time past, the need
of living animals had been felt to serve as models for the taxidermists,
and, through the courtesy of the U. S. Fish Commission, arrangements
were made for Mr. Hornaday to accompany one of the cars belonging
to the Commission with a view to securing living specimens. On Oc-
tober 8, Mr. Hornaday left Washington, visiting points in Minnesota,
Dakota, Montana, Washington Territory, Oregon, Utah, and Wyo-
ming. This expedition resulted in the acquisition of seventeen animals.
Mr. J. Frank Ellis, of the U. S. Fish Commission, and his assistant, Mr.
R. S. Johnson, rendered valuable assistance to the Museum in connec-
tion with the transportation of these animals to Washington.

A wooden structure for their reception was erected immediately
south of the Smithsonian Building, and on December 31, 1887, it was
thrown open to the public. Since then a large number of valuable con-
tributions have been received, among which are a fine jaguar from Mr.
J. W. Riddle, of Eagle Pass, Texas, and two black bears from Mr. J.
J. EK. Linberg, of El Paso, Texas. The most important accession is a
pair of buffaloes from Nebraska. These were purchased by Hon.
EK. G. Blackford, of New York, and presented to the Smithsonian
Institution. The collection has been steadily increasing, and it is
hoped that during the next session of Congress an appropriation will
be made for the purchase of land with a view to forming a National
Zoological Park. Special thanks are due to the United States Ex-
press Company for having made generous reductions in the rates of
transportation on living animals, the agents of the company having
been instructed to ship living specimens to this Institution at ordinary
merchandise rates.

G.—REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK.

PROGRESS OF GENERAL AND INCIDENTAL WORK.
: LIBRARY.

Mr. John Murdoch, librarian, has submitted the following statement
in regard to the operations of the library during thé year:

The total number of publications added to the library during the year
was 6,063 (1,316 volumes of more than 100 pages, 1,436 pamphlets, 3,169
parts of regular serials, and 142 charts). Of these, 437 volumes, 953
pamphlets, and 1,655 parts of serials were retained for the use of the
Museum from the accessions of the Smithsonian Institution.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 4i

The remainder was obtained, as usual, by gift, and, less frequently,
by purchase.

The most important accession to the library during the year was the
bequest of the late curator of Archeology, Dr. Charles Rau, of his
archeological and general library, comprising 2,437 volumes and
pamphlets, many of very great value. Of these, 408 have already been
entered and catalogued.

When finished, these books will form the ‘ Rau Memorial Library,”
and will be assigned to the sectional library of archeology.

Other important donations were as follows: From the estate of the
late Prof. S. F. Baird, 65 volumes, 21 pamphlets, 303 parts of serials,
and 3 charts; from Prof. Charles U. Shepard, of Charleston, South
Carolina, 134 volumes and 5 pamphlets from the chemical library of his
distinguished father. (This donation was made at the suggestion of
Prof. F. W. Clarke, chief chemist, U.S. Geological Survey.) From Dr.
George E. Horn, of Philadelphia, a complete set of ‘‘ separates” of his
entomological papers, comprising 44 pamphlets.

During the year 5,492 books were borrowed from the library and
3,023 returned. Ninety-four persons are now authorized under the
regulations to draw books from the Museum Library, and of these 73
are also authorized to obtain books from the Library of Congress
through the Museum Library. Two hundred and ninety-eight orders
were sent to the Library of Congress during the year.

The ‘ Ledger of Books Issued” having grown so bulky and so in-
convenient, on account of the impossibility of alphabetical arrange-
ment, it was decided to try the experiment of transferring the charges
on this book to separate slips, which could be filed in alphabetical
order. When these slips were prepared by the copyist they were care-
fully compared with the records by the librarian in person, who then
canceled the old record. The slips used are of uniform size, one-fourth
of the standard octavo. When a book is issued the title, with the name
of the borrower and date of issue, is written on one of these slips, which
are kept by themselves for the day, and counted and filed the first
thing on the following morning. On the return of the book the slip is
removed from the file and canceled. The receipts of each borrower are
kept as before, but are filed alphabetically instead of by their dates.
The experiment has proved entirely successful. It is calculated that at
least half the time formerly consumed in recording loans is now saved,
and there is a distinct increase in accuracy. The success of this experi-
ment induced the librarian to use the same method in keeping the ac-
counts with the Library of Congress, as a great deal of time was wasted
whenever it was necessary to learn whether a certain book had been
drawn from the Library or when one had been returned. Of thelatter we
had no record except the unindexed file of canceled receipts, bound in a
clumsy volume. At present, one alphabetical file of slips gives the
titles of all books drawn from the Library of Congress, with the date
42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

of withdrawal of each; another shows the titles of all that have been
returned with the date of withdrawal and return. These two files thus
give acomplete history of our dealings with the Congressional Library.

When a book is received from the Library its title is immediately
written on a slip, which is stamped with the date and filed at once. On
its return to the Library of Congress this slip is removed from the file
of “‘ Borrowed,” stamped with the date, and filed as “‘ Returned.” This
system, which has been in operation since the latter part of March, has
proved entirely satisfactory.

The card-cataiogue by authors has been continued, and 2,829 titles
have been added to it during the year. It is still impossible to begin
the much-needed catalogue of subjects.

Sectional libraries.—An inspection of the sectional libraries was be-
gun April 2, 1888, and completed June 15, 1888. All the sectional
libraries were visited by the librarian in person, and the books found
in them carefully compared with the receipts given by the gentlemen
in charge of the sections. At the same time the titles of all books per-
manently assigned to each sectional library were transferred from the
ordinary ‘“‘call-cards” to a special form of receipt (approved by the
Secretary). These sectional library receipts are filed separately from
the receipts given by curators and others for books borrowed by them
-personally and not for the use of the section. Thus the receipts for
each sectional library form a catalogue of the books in that library.
At the close of the inspection each curator was furnished with a list of
the books in his sectional library.

The sectional libraries, the establishment of which has been author-
ized, are nineteen in number, namely: (1) Administration; (2) Arche-
ology; (3) Assistant Secretary Smithsonian Institution; (4) Birds;
(5) Chief Clerk Smithsonian Institution; (6) Editor Smithsonian In-
stitution; (7) Ethnology; (8) Fishes; (9) Insects; (10) Lithology and
Physical Geology; (11) Mammals; (12) Marine Invertebrates; (13)
Materia Medica; (14) Mesozoic Fossils; (15) Metallurgy and Kco-
nomie Geology; (16) Mineralogy; (17) Mollusks and Cenozoic Fossils ;
(18) Plants, recent and fossil; (19) Textiles and Foods.

Of these, Nos. 1, 3, and 5 have never been organized, while it has
been found convenient for purposes of administration to divide the
library of the section of Minerals into two divisions—(a) consisting
Chiefly of works on chemistry, and kept in the office of the honorary
curator and under his immediate charge, and (b) containing most of the
strictly mineralogical books, and kept in the mineral laboratory, in
charge of the assistant curator.

The following is the result of the inspection :

Archeology.—This library was organized December 14, 1887, on the
appointment of the new curator, and therefore not reiuspected. On
June 1, 1888, it contained 50 volumes and pamphlets and 15 parts of
serials. When the Rau Memorial Library is entered and catalogued it
will be assigned to this section.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 43

Birds.—Inspected April 2, 1888; contains 462 volumes and pam-
phlets and 183 parts of serials. These are generally in good condition,
though many of the large books are of necessity exposed to dust from
lack of suitable cases. This sectional library was founded before the
Museum library was organized, and was found to contain many books
belonging to the Smithsonian Institution of which the librarian had no
record. These were all properly catalogued and recorded.

Editor Smithsonian Institution.—Inspected June 8, 1888; contains
642 volumes and pamphlets and 390 parts of serials, all in good order.

Hthnology.—Inspected April 28, 1888; contains 61 volumes and pam-
phlets, 98 parts of serials, and 1 chart, in good condition.

Fishes.—Inspected April 18, 1888; contains 137 volumes and pam-
phlets and 12 parts of serials, in good condition, kept in suitable cases
with standard Museum locks.

Insects.—Inspected June 5, 1888; contains 390 volumes and pam- ~
phlets and 343 parts of serials, in good condition, kept in a case with
standard Museum lock. More case room is needed.

Lithology and physical geology.—Inspected May 3, 1888; contains 312
volumes and pamphlets and 127 parts of serials, in good condition. The
curator has two cases with standard Museum locks, which hold about
’ three-fourths of these books, while the rest are on open shelves.
Mammals.—Inspected May 28, 1888; contains 410 volumes and pam-
_phiets, in good order. The curator has not a sufficient number of cases
to contain these books.

Marine invertebrates.—Inspected April 14, 1888; contains 115 vol-
umes and pamphlets and 118 charts, all in good condition, and kept in
cases with standard Museum locks.

Materia medica.—Inspected April 23, 1888; contains 194 volumes
and pamphlets and 130 parts of serials, in good condition. About half
of the books are kept in a suitable case, provided with the standard
Museum lock, and the rest are on open shelves.

Mesozoic fossils—Inspected May 17, 1888; contains 36 volumes and
_ pamphlets in good order, kept on open shelves.

Metallurgy and economic geology.—Inspected May 10, 1888; contains
349 volumes and pamphlets and 94 parts of serials, in good condition
and very carefully arranged by the curator. There are six good cases,
amply sufficient to hold all these books.

Mineralogy.—(a) Inspected June 4, 1888; contains 142 volumes and
pamphlets and 228 parts of serials, in good order and kept in suitable
cases. (b) Inspected May 16, 1888; contains 98 volumes and pam-
phlets in good order and kept in a suitable case, with standard Museum
locks. ‘

Mollusks and Cenozoic fossils.—Inspected April 21, 1858; contains 74
volumes and pamphlets and 34 parts of serials, in good order, kept in
a locked case.

Plants, recent and fossil.—Inspected May 18, 1888; contains 320 vol-
44 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

umes and pamphlets and 359 parts of serials, kept in various rooms on
the south balcony and on shelves on the baleony.

Textiles and foods.—Owing te the temporary absence of the curator
and the inability of the assistant left in charge to take proper care of
the books in this library, they have been recalled to the central library.
On the return of the curator this sectional library will be reorganized.

It seems undesirable, and, indeed, hardly practicable to endeavor to
enforce the regulation which requires that books belonging to a sec-
tional library shall be kept separate from all other books. The books
in a specialist’s library are naturally arranged according to subjects,
which necessarily brings together books belonging to the sectional
library, the Library of Congress, and even the author himself.

Binding.—One hundred volumes belonging to the Museum were sent
to the Government Bindery late in the year and were all returned on or
before June 29. Considerable progress has been made in putting the
pamphlets into suitable covers ; but this work has been partially sus-
pended on account of the exhaustion of the appropriation for the pur-
chase of these covers.

Progress has also been made in arranging the pamphlets in the
pamphlet boxes mentioned in my last report, but this work has neces-
sarily been slow, since the routine work, as will be seen from the very
large number of books issued, returned, and catalogued, has occupied
nearly all the time of the two employés in the library.

TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE.
DISTRIBUTION OF DUPLICATES, AND EXCHANGES.

The total number of boxes, packages, barrels, tanks, ete., received
during the year was 12,400, of which 1,911 contained material for the
Museum collections, the remainder of the number being distributed to
their proper addresses.

The registrar, Mr. 8S. C. Brown, has continued to act as transportation
clerk for the Smithsonian Institution, thus adding much routine work
to his duties as registrar.

During the year 405 packages were entered upon the storage record
of the Museum. The storing of material is of very great convenience to
the curators, who may not at the time of the arrival of the material for
their department be able to work up the collection at once.

The number of packages sent out was 2,042, and of this number 264
contained Museum material sent out as gifts, loans, orin exchange. Pho-
tographs of cases and exhibits in the Museum have been sent to all who
made application. Much labor was added to the work of this depart-
ment in connection with the shipment of exhibits to the Ohio Valley
Centennial Exposition. These filled twelve cars and consisted of five
hundred and ninety-six packages, weighing in the aggregate 125,000
pounds.*

*A full account of the participation of the Smithsonian Institution in this exposi-
tion will be published in the report for 1888~89,

46 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Sixty-four photographs of cases and exhibits were sent out in compli-
ance with requests. JT ifty-three applications for duplicate specimens
have been received from individuals and institutions. Many of these
have been filled and the remainder will be, as soon as the duplicate
material can be arranged into sets for distribution.

A large number of exchanges of material of all kinds, especially
geological specimens, has been completed during the year.

The National Museum takes this opportunity of extending its warm-
est thanks to the Alaska Commercial Company and other companies
through whose kind offices the transportation of specimens has been
effected at various times during the year.

FOREIGN EXCHANGES.

Several exchanges with foreign institutions have been carried on dur-
ing the year. Among the more important the following may be men-
tioned :

A model of the Cabin Creek meteorite was sent to M. A. Daubrée, of the
Museum @’ Histoire Naturelle in Paris, and other models and photographs
will be sent later. ToS. H. Drew, Wanganui, New Zealand, was trans-
mitted a collection of ethnological objects, and from him was received a
~ collection of fossils. A small collection of archeological objects, number-
ing fifteen specimens, was transmitted to L. Guesde, Musée L’ Herminier,
Point a Pitre, from whom was received a collection of birdskins, num-
bering three hundred and twenty-eight specimens. A collection of one
hundred and forty-one North American stone implements was sent in
December to Sir Julius Von Haast, director of the Canterbury Museum,
Christ Church, New Zealand. From Dr. E. Hamy, director of the Mu-
sée @Ethnographie, in Paris, were received in exchange two boxes con-
taining busts representing types of the human race. A collection
of thirty-six specimens illustrating American aboriginal religion was
sent to M. L de Milloué, director of the Musée Guimet at Lyons. In
exchange, specimens of Roman pottery and objects of Gallo-Roman in-
terest in bone, stone, and bronze, as well as duplicates of Chinese and
Japanese religious objects, have been promised. An exchange of bats
has been arranged for with Siguor Angelo Senna, of the Zoological In-
stitute at Pavia, Italy. A collection of minerals, ores,and rocks was
received from Mr. 8. Sinclair, director of the Australian Museum, Syd-
ney, New South Wales. Birdskins, including two specimens of Namiye’s
Woodpecker, specimens of lacquer-work, meteoric stones, sapphire crys-
tals, and asaddle from Loochoo, have been received from the Educa-
tional Department, Tokyo, Japan, and a collection of one hundred and
seventeen birdskins has been sent in exchange.

Negotiations are still pending for exchanges of material with several
other individuals and institutions.

PUBLICATIONS.

In June, 1888, the report on the operations of the National Museum
for the first six months of 1885 was issued as Part 1 of the Annual
Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution. This
volume contains i-xi, 1-264 and i-vii, 1-939 pages, the latter series of
pages constituting a paper by Hon. Thomas Donaldson, entitled ‘The
George Catlin Indian Gallery.” This is illustrated by one hundred and
forty-two plates and two large maps, showing the bounds of Indian
reservations.

The reports on the operations of the Museum for 188586 and 1886~87
are in type, and will soon be received from the Public Printer.

The ninth volume of ‘‘ Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum,”
for 1886, was received from the Government Printing Office in August,
1887. Two hundred copies of this volume had already been received
in “signatures” and distributed in that form to the principal scientific
_ institutions, and also to a few individuals, in all parts of the world.
The first signature was published on September 17, 1886, and the last
on March 9, 1887. Volume 9 contains i—viii, 1-714 pages, and is illus-
trated by twenty-five full page plates, one of which is a chromo-litho-
graph, and a large number of text figures. The authors of papers in
this volume are twenty-seven in number, namely: James H. Benedict,
T. W. Blakiston, George H. Boehmer, Charles H. Bollman, EH. D. Cope,
W. H. Dall, George E. Doering, Charles L. Edwards, Carl H. Higen-
mann, Barton W. Evermann, Fernando Ferrari-Perez, Morton W.

48 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Bulletin 32, “Catalogue of Batrachians and Reptiles of Central
America and Mexico,” by Prof. E. D. Cope, has been published during
the year and contains 98 octavo pages. This catalogue is a systematic
and synonymie description of Central American and Mexican species of
Batrachia and Reptilia, largely based on material in the National
Museum. ‘To each species is added a list of the localities where it has
been found, together with the name of the discoverer, or, in the absence
of that, the name of the author who is responsible for the correctness
of the locality. The total number of genera included in the catalogue
is 197, and of species, 705, of which 135 are batrachians and 570 rep-
tiles.

The manuscript for Bulletins No. 33, “Catalogue of Minerals and
Synonyms, alphabetically arranged for the use of Museums,” by Dr,
Thomas Egleston, and No. 34, “Catalogue of Batrachians and Reptiles
of North America,” by Prof. E. D. Cope, is now in the hands of the
Public Printer.

Mr. A. Howard Clark has faithfully continued his duties as editor
of the Proceedings and Bulletin.

Circular No. 36 of the U.S. National Museum, concerning the Depart-
ment of Prehistoric Antropology, has been issued. The object of this
circular is to obtain information concerning that class of American
aboriginal stone implements which have heretofore been denominated
“rude or unfinished implements of the paleolithic type.” It is illus-
trated by cuts of several stone implements. This circular was widely
- distributed among archeologists and others interested in the subject,
and much valuable information was elicited, which has been incorpor-
ated in a paper by the curator of prehistoric anthropology, and is pub-
lished in Section rt of this Report.

In Section rv of the Report will be found a list of the publications of the
Museum, and also a bibliography of papers published by officers of the
Museum and by collaborators, whose writings are based upon Museum
material. The authors of these papers are 77 in number, of whom 35
are connected with the Museum, 14 being honorary officers. The total
number of papers is 396, of which 311 are by Museum officers and 85
by other investigators, and are distributed under the following sub-
jects:

erican rocks was lent for study to Mr. J.8. Diller, of the U. S. Geological
Survey. Mr. J. F. Kemp has published two papers describing the south-
eastern Missouri lead region, basing his remarks upon collections which
were made by him, and which formed a part of the exhibit of the De-
partment of Metallurgy at the New Orleans Exhibition in 1884, These
collections are now in the Museum. A drawing of Pilocarpus pennati-
folius was lent for comparison to Dr. Clement Biddle, U.S. Navy. In
accordance with the request of the Smithsonian Institution, July 11,
the Navy Department detailed Paymaster William J. Thomson, U.S.S.
Mohican, to enable him to complete his report on Easter Island, and
upon the collections made by himself at that place. Mr. Henry Hemp- —
hill, of San Diego, California, has during the past year, as in previous
years, rendered valuable assistance to the Department of Mollusks,
and has presented much valuable and interesting material. Dr. Will-

granted.

CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE WORK.
BUILDINGS AND LABOR: POLICE AND PUBLIC COMFORT.

This department is under the charge of Henry Horan, superintendent
of buildings.

At the beginning of the present fiscal year the staff employed for
police and inspection, under the charge of Henry Horan, superinten-
dent of buildings, consisted of 1 assistant superintendent, 12 watch-
men, 5 door-keepers, 1 telephone operator, 1 copyist, 1 mail messenger ;
for construction, care of buildings and repairs, 4 carpenters, 2 paint-
ers; for labor and cleaning, 3 skilled laborers, 16 laborers, 7 cleaners, 2
attendants. For heating and lighting there was employed 1 engineer,
with 6 firemen. Extra laborers have been employed from time to time,
and particularly in connection with the preparation of the exhibit for
the Cincinnati Exposition.

The following paragraphs contain a condensed summary of the most
important work accomplished in each month :

SS V ae

July.—During this month the task of preparing an exhibit for the Minneapolis Ex-
position was commenced, under the general supervision of Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk.
The work of packing «nd shipping the exhibit occupied the time of the greater part
of the force until late in August, when Mr. C. A. Steuart, assistant superintendent of
buildings, was sent to Minnneapolis to superintend the work of unpacking and in-
stalling the exhibit. This work was completed on August 31, the opening day of the
Exposition.

August.—During this month the work of removing the frame annex east of the
Museum building was completed. The material thus obtained was utilized in the
erection of work and storage sheds south of the Smithsonian building. Steam-pipes
were laid, in order to connect these sheds with the boilers in the Smithsonian build-
ing. The collection of scientific instruments was removed from the north hall of the
Museum building to a room specially fitted for its reception in the east wing of the
Smithsonian building.

September.—Much of the time of the laborers during this month was occupied in-re-
arranging the cases in the Anthropological hall of the Smithsonian building. A
large collection of stone images, models of cliff dwellings, and other objects of great
weight, was removed from the Museum building to this hall. This work necessitated
great care in its execution. A cast of a whale in the south hall of the Museum build-
ing was removed from its base and suspended from the ceiling, thus affording addi-
tional floor space.

October.—During this month was commenced the erection of sheds south of the
Smithsonian building. The arrangement of the material which had been removed
from the Museum building to the Anthropological hall in the Smithsonian building
was finished. The walls and ceilings in the basement of the Smithsonian building
were whitewashed. The sewerage in the basement of the Smithsonian building was
repaired. Thirteen walnut cases, formerly used in the Smithsonian building, were re-
constructed, to conform to the needs of the Department of Metallurgy. The cases in
the Department ot Lithology and Physical Geology were re-arranged. The signal
clocks throughout the buildings were put in order. Several pine cases were erected
in the basement of the Smithsonian building for the use of the Department of Fishes,
54 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

November.—The principal work of the month consisted in unpacking the exhibit.
which had been returned from the Minneapolis Exposition. The rearrangement of
the material in their cases occupied much time. Such articles as were not required
for exhibition in the Museum were placed in storage. Alterations were made in the
natural history laboratory, and the walls of the various rooms painted. Double
doors were added to the Secretary’s office.

December.—During this month the sheds south of the Smithsonian building were
repaired and an additional shed was constructed. Cages and inclosures for the col-
lection of living animals were constructed. Many of the exhibition cases throughout
the buildings were repaired. Considerable work has been done in the Ornithological
Department. Many of the bird-cases have been reconstructed, new shelving has been
put in, and the cases have been painted inside and outside.

18ss.

January.—A large number of cases hitherto in use in the north hall were removed
to different parts of the Museum building. These were replaced with others, thus
necessitating anentire rearrangement of the hall. This work occupied a large force
of men during several days. The food collection was removed from the northwest
range to the northeast court. The exhibit of the Entomological Department was re-
moved from the southeast court to the southeast range. ‘The cases in the hall de-
voted to the fishery exhibit were rearranged. Twelve mahogany cases were received
for the exhibit of the Department of Graphic Arts and placed in position. Four
plates of glass, each 9 feet by 7 feet 3 inches, were successfully set in the case contain-
ing the mounted group of bisons. The entire Materia Medica collection was re-
arranged. A plank walk was constructed around the carpenter shop. The rooms
ou the first floor east of the north entrance were fitted up for the accommodation of
the engineer of property.

February.—During this month the east and west hall were rearranged undez the
supervision of Professor Mason, curator of the Department of Ethnology. The empty
exhibition cases and other property were removed from the southeast court in order
to make room for the exhibition of fossils and botanical specimens. The collection
of tiles was removed from the west hall to the southwest range. Several war relics,
which had been in the custody of the War Department, were transferred from the
Winder Building by Museum laborers and placed on exhibition in the National Mu-
seum. A section of a large California tree was brought from the residence of Senator
Leland Stanford. A storm-door was constructed at the north entrance to the Museum
building. Much of the time during this and the following month was occupied in
preparing the lecture hall for the annual course of Saturday lectures. Cases were
placed in the reconstructed portion of the west wing of the Smithsonian building.
A brick wall was built between the offices of the curator of fishes and of the curator
of marine invertebrates. The steam-pipes leading to the sheds south of the Smith-
sonian building were covered.

March.—The Graphic Arts collection was placed in position. The exhibit illustrat-
ing the composition of the human body was removed from the northeast court to the
southeast range. The material in the old Armory building was overhauled prepara-
tory to a general cleaning.

April.—The objects of stone and iron were removed from the shed on the east side
of the Museum building and the shed torn down. The lecture hall was fitted up
for stereopticon exhibition in the day-time, the windows being provided with screens,
so arranged as to be raised or lowered. Special preparations were made in arranging
the lecture hall for the meetings of the National Academy of Sciences. Walks were
laid to and from the shops in the rear of the Smithsonian building.

May.—The work of constructing feed and shelter houses and other inclosures for the
collection of living animals occupied a considerable portion of the time of the laborers.
The spouting on the various buildings was repaired. The awnings were repaired and
placed on the windows.

June.—The work of preparing an exhibit for the Ohio Valley Exposition at Cin-
cinnati was continued. A large additional force of mechanics and laborers was
employed, and by June 30 ten car-loads of exhibits had been forwarded to Cincinnati.
On June 25 Mr. Horan left for Cincinnati to saperintend the arrangement of the ex-
hib‘t, which had been placed under the general supervision of Mr. R. E. Earll.

During the last six months of this year two hundred and eighty-five lights of plate-
glass have been fitted in the cases assigned to the Department of Birds, replacing the °
smal] lights of common glass hitherto in use in these cases.

ELECTRIC SERVICE.

In August, 1887, a contract. was made with a firm of electricians of
this city to furnish all material and labor necessary for putting in order
the electrical service in the Museum and Smithsonian buildings, the cost
being $215. The work was satisfactorily completed. A further agree-
ment was then made with the same firm to keep the electrical apparatus
in order for the remainder of the fiscal year, furnishing all material and
labor, for the sum of $12.50a month. The transfer of the electrical serv-
ice from the care of an employé of the Museum to an outside firm has been
made in the interest of economy, and has resulted very satisfactorily.
The electric bells, other than those belonging to the Telephone Com-
pany, reaching twenty-eight points of the buildings, have been kept in
good working order; the clock regulator has been cleaned and repaired;
the watchmen’s clocks, time dials, and station-boxes in both buildings,
numbering twenty-two, have been overhauled and repaired; and all
wires have been tested and repaired. The door-bells and burglar-alarms
have been tested and are now in guod order.

TELEPHONE SERVICE.

The work of this service has been very faithfully and intelligently
performed by Miss M. L. Stone, who, in addition to her duties as tele-
phone operator, has had charge of the Bureau of Information, the object
of which is to reply to the numerous questions of visitors. The tele-
phone switch-board has a capacity for making one hundred connections.
At the present time there are only thirty-seven different circuits in use.
There are two separate lines connecting the Museum with the central
office in this city. The daily average number of calls through the year
is about one hundred. During the year 34,318 connections have been
made. Through this office telegrams may be sent by the Western
Union Telegraph Company, the Baltimore and Ohio Telegraph Com-
pany, and the Government Department telegraph ines.

PROPERTY AND SUPPLIES.

While the general routine work of the Museum has been the same as
in former years, some changes have been adopted which are leading
to more satisfactory results.

It had heretofore been the custom, through the courtesy of the De-
partment of the Interior, to avail ourselves of the bids received there,
in obtaining our supplies, but our needs being widely different from
those of all other departments of the Government, it was thought that
an independent course might be more satisfactory. Consequently, in
May, 1888, proposals were advertised for and contracts were awarded.

During this year Mr. J. EH. Watkins, who was holding an important
office under the Pennsylvania Railway Company, was offered the posi-
tion as head of the Department of Property and Supplies, and entered
upon his duties January 1, 1888, with the title of Engineer of Property.
56 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 18388.

Under the supervision of Mr. Watkins the work of bringing up to
date the back records of the office was systematically entered upon,
aud has been vigorously prosecuted; the preparation of a complete list
of all articles classed as furniture and fixtures has been begun, and labels
and numbers prepared for the same.

FINANCES.

The following statement being supplementary to the detailed report
of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, forwarded to Congress
December 1, 1888, it has not been thought necessary to repeat the ac-
count of expenditures minutely given therein. (See Miscellaneous Doc-
ument No. 55, Fiftieth Congress, second session.)

During the year ending June 30, 1888, the appropriation received by
the Museum for preservation of collections was $116,000; for furniture
and fixtures, $40,000; for heating and lighting, $12,000.

PRESERVATION OF COLLECTIONS.

The disbursements paid from the appropriation for preservation of
collections for this year are as follows: For services, $97,493.32 was
expended; $3,427.25 for general supplies; $8,737.59 for specimens ;
$2,281.96 for stationery ; $783.69 for books ; $983.81 for travel ; $2,053.27
for freight and cartage, making a totai of $115,760.89, which leaves an
unexpended balance of $239.11. From this balance there are yet to be
paid outstanding liabilities to the amount of $226.18, principally ac-
counts of bonded railways for freight on specimens, which are still
awaiting settlement in the Treasury.

FURNITURE AND FIXTURES.

Out of the appropriation for furniture and fixtures this year there has
been expended for services $19,203.79: for exhibition cases of various
designs, with drawings for the same, and for unit-tables and wing-
frames, $7,615.30; for drawers, trays, office furniture and other fixtures,
$2,714.51; for brackets, tools, glass, hardware and interior fittings,
$4,896.08; for lumber, paints, and oils, $3,080.43; for chemicals, appa-
tus for laboratory, and for jars and containers for specimens, $675.81 ;
for oak shields, bird-stands, etc., $217.94; for linings for cases, $420.24;
for plumbing, tin, lead, slate, tiles, etc., $1,038.11; and for miscellane-
ous expenses $110.83, leaving an wnexpended balance of $26.96.

CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORTS.

This department of the Museum work has since 1886 been under the
charge of Mr. R. I. Geare. The correspondence of the Museum has
greatly increased during the last few years. In 1881, the first year of
occupancy of the Museum building, the number of pages in the press-
58

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

copy books of letters written hardly exceeded one thousand, and of these
letters fully one-half related to work connected with the fishery inves-
tigations of the Tenth Census.

For the purpose of explaining the nature of the correspondence of
the Museum at the present time and of showing the large increase in
this branch of the administrative work, it is convenient to arrange the
Museum correspondence under the following headings: (1) General
Museum business, including matters connected with Museum adminis-
tration, arrangement of foreign exchanges, etc.; (2) replies to requests
for technical information; (3) the acknowledgment of gifts, loans, and
exchanges; (4) reports upon specimens sent for identification.

Under the first heading 1,959 letters have been written.

Letters containing requests for information are constantly being re-
ceived, and it isa part of the duty of this office to see that such requests
are referred to the proper specialists, and to incorporate their replies in

letters conveying the desired information.

During the year 2,626 let-

ters of this kind have been received, and their source is indicated in the
following geographical summation :

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 59

More than a thousand acknowledgments of specimens acquired by
gift, loan, and exchange have been written.

The number of ‘‘lots” of specimens received for examination and re-
port during the year was three hundred and fifty-seven, fourteen of which
were transmitted by Members of Congress. This material included birds,
insects, minerals, ores, rocks, fossils, ethnological and archeological ob-
jects, shells, fishes, mammals, plants, oils, earths, reptiles, birds’ eggs and
nests, skeletons, fibers, coins, marine invertebrates, fossil wood. The
Specimens were submitted to the Museum curators, and a report em-
bodying the opinion of the curator has been prepared in every instance
for the signature of the Assistant Secretary and for transmission to the
sender.

By far the larger proportion of the material sent for examination is
of very little value to the Museum collections, although occasionally
a specimen is retained for addition to the exhibition or study series. The
Museum reserves the right, except when special agreement to the con-
trary is made, to keep all material sent for examination and report.

Thirty-one lots of specimens were borrowed by curators to aid them in
the identification of Museum material. These included twenty-two col-
lections of bird-skins, seven of shells, and three of fossils. The courtesy
of the lending was acknowledged by formal letters.

During the year 5,272 pages of press copy-books have been filled with
letters relating exclusively to Museum matters.

This office is also charged with the compilation of data for the annual
report, with the preparation of a bibliography of the Museum publications
and of papers published by Museum officers and other collaborators, and
also with the preparation of the list of accessions to the Museum, accom-
panied by indexes showing (1) the Museum department to which re-
ferred, and (2) the geographical source of the accession.

PREPARATION OF LABELS.

During the year 2,159 forms of labels have been printed, as is shown
in the following statement:

More than two thousand additional labels were sent to the Govern-
ment Printing Office during the year. These, however, had not been
received at the close of the fiscal year.

Since the instructive value of objects exhibited depends in great part
on good descriptive labels, it is hoped that hereafter ~reater facilities
may be afforded for the rapid printing of the same.
60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS.

The preparation of specimens for exhibition in the Museum, or for the
study series, has been satisfactorily continued. The work of modeling
has been placed under the charge of Mr. W. T. Hornaday, chief taxi-
dermist.

(a) TAXIDERMISTS AND MODELERS.

The work of this department has been unusually important. Early
in the year the making of large casts was discontinued, and Mr. Joseph
Palmer, modeler, was added to the force of mammal taxidermists. A
little later Mr. William Palmer was also assigned to this department,
and has accomplished some excellent results in the preparation of small
mammals. Mr. Joseph Palmer has rendered valuable service in the
mounting of large mammals. In.order to complete the systematic ad-
ministration of this class of work Mr. J. W. Hendley was also added to
this force, which thus becomes the Department of Taxidermy and Model-
ing, under the direction of Mr. W. T. Hornaday, chief taxidermist. This
force also includes Mr. A. H. Forney and Mr. George F. Pollock, an un-
salaried assistant serving for instructionin taxidermy. During the last
month of the year, Messrs. George K. Cherrie and B. W. Mitchell were
engaged temporarily to assist in the preparation of the exhibit for the
Cincinnati Exposition.

TAXIDERMY PROPER.

The event of the year has been the mounting of a series of six of the
buffaloes obtained by the Smithsonian Expedition sent out in 1886, and
the arrangement of the specimens in a group. The finished group is
fitly regardly as a monument to the American bison, and illustrates not
only the various stages of growth of the animal from the young calf to
a huge old bull of enormous proportions, but the ground-work and nat-
ural accessories of the group have also been carefully and artistically
worked up to illustrate the habitat of the animal. The whole is re-
garded as a triumph of the taxidermist’s art, and, so far as known, it
surpasses in scientific accuracy, and artistic design and treatment, any-
thing of the kind yet produced. The group is the work of Mr. Horna-
day, assisted by Mr. Joseph Palmer and Mr. A. H. Forney. The case
containing the group is also regarded as a model of its kind, both in
elegance of design, and perfect adaptability to its purpose. Its dimen-
sions are as follows: Length 16 feet, width 12 feet, height 10 feet.

The preparation of the group of buffaloes fairly inaugurates a line of
work which has been in contemplation for some time, namely, the pre-
paration of a series of artistic groups of American mammals, both large
and small, each in its own special case, with natural accessories repre-
senting its favorite habitat. The taxidermists have also mounted dur-
ing the year a group of prong-horn antelopes, of coyotes, prairie-dogs,
opossums, gray squirrels and red squirrels, and have also made a be-
ginning on a group of moose and two groups of foxes. The groups of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 61

coyotes, antelopes, prairie-dogs, and opossums were placed on exhibition
shortly after the completion of the group of buffaloes, which occurred
on March 10, 1888.

The following is a list of the mammals which have been mounted dur-

DRY SKINS.

A special feature of taxidermic work during the past year has been
the overhauling of the collection of wet skins and the making up of a
great many of the duplicates as dry skins suitable for study. The entire
force spent about two months in work of this kind, and prepared dry
skins as follows:

MISCELLANEOUS WORK.

An unusval quantity of miscellaneous work has required attention,
which tended to lessen the amount of. visible results for the year. The
The following are a few of the principal tasks completed :

43 mammal skins, heads and skulls were poisoned.
17 mammal heads repaired after return from the Cincinnati Exposition.
8 pairs antlers cleaned and retouched.
7 pairs antlers mounted on shields and hung up.
25 large mammals cleaned and retouched.
24 small mammals cleaned and retouched.
14 mounted mammals were repaired and retouched.
11 large wet skins picked out for exchange.
1 large mounted mammal was dismounted.
16 barrels of solution were made for wet skin collection.
38 barrels and three tanks of wet skins were moved to jaboratory.
28 boxes of specimens were received.
14 miscellaneous boxes of specimens were packed and shipped.
41 boxes mounted manmnals were packed for Cincinnati Exposition.
9 large cages for living bears, birds of prey, etc., were built by the taxidermists.
From November 8, 1887, to February 1, 1588, the collection of living
animals was cared for by the taxidermists.
Mr. Joseph Palmer made a trip to North Platte, Nebraska, and brought
back two living buffaloes,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 63

Mr. W. T. Hornaday, the chief taxidermist, was absent one month on
a collecting trip to the Pacific coast.

Mr. Joseph Palmer devoted the entire month of June to making casts
for the Department of Ethnology.

MODELING AND PAINTING.

Mr. J. W. Hendley has accomplished much valuable work, 1aaking
painted casts of the specimens constituting the extensive aa almost
priceless collection of Babylonian and Assyrian seals owned by Mr.
R. 8S. Williams, of Utica, New York. No more important work has en-
gaged Mr. Hendley’s attention during his connection with the National
Museum, and it is due him to say that notwithstanding the many
difficulties attending the casting and painting of agate, chalcedony,
onyx, graphite, and crystal seals covered with delicate inscriptions,
he has reproduced them all with a degree of skill and fidelity which,
it is believed, has never before been attained. In many instances the
copies were so exact in color, surface, similarity of substance and weight,
that even the owner of the seals several times mistook the copies for
the originals. Not only were the seals themselves copied, three com-
plete sets being made, but Mr. Hendley also made a flat impression in
black and white of the inscription on each of the cylindrical seals, so
that the characters may be studied to the best possible advantage. Of
these flat impressions four complete sets were made.

Mr. Hendley has also made thirty-three casts of meteorites for the
Department of Minerals, to be used in exchanges.

The more important items of work accomplished by Mr. Hendley dur-
ing the year may be summarized as follows:

29 Babylonian and Assyrian seals cast and painted, three complete sets, or 87 copies
in all.
29 flat impressions of seals made in black and white, four complete sets, or 116 pieces
in all.
11 casts of Arkansas iron meteorite.
11 casts of North Carolina stone meteorite.
11 casts of Mexican iron meteorite.
Bartholdi’s statue of Roman Soldier repaired and painted.
Busts of Professor Baird and Robert Fulton painted.
Statue of General McPherson repaired and painted.
Siamese coat of arms repaired and regilded.
Large Japanese plaque repaired and pieces restored.
Large heraldic shield repaired and regilded.
3 sets of casts made of the phosphorus, potassium, and sodium for the collection
illustrating the composition of the human body.
1 set of casts made to represent the daily food of a man—bread, butter, potatoes,
and beefsteak.
2 Ute Indian lay figures made, costumed, and grouped.
3 medals copied.

Notwithstanding the value of Mr. Joseph Palmer’s taxidermic work,
it has been found necessary to interrupt it from time to time in favor of
important work in plaster. During the year he has put together and
set up the original plaster model of Crawford’s statue of Washington,
64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

repaired two Mexican idols, made a cast of the head of a large moose
(in the flesh), and repaired a large group of serpents cast from nature.
During the month of June Mr. Palmer took molds of the celebrated
Canopus inscriptions, of a large Assyrian obelisk, and two large sculpt-
ured slabs in the Episcopal Seminary of Fairfax County, Virginia, at
Alexandria.

(6) OSTEOLOGICAL PREPARATOR.

The work of preparing and arranging osteological material has been
greatly interrupted during the past year.

During the months of Juiy and August Mr. Lucas was absent on a
collecting trip to Newfoundland and Labrador, while Mr. Scollick, the
only assistant, was for seven weeks unable to do any work on account
of sickness.

In November the work-rooms were transferred from the Armory to
the Laboratory building, together with a considerable amount of ma-
terial on storage at the former place.

The re-arrangement of the Museum halls necessitated a complete
change in the disposition of the cases containing the exhibition series
of skeletons, while the growth of the collections rendered it necessary
to completely change the arrangement of the study series of birds.

Finally, the month of June was largely devoted to packing specimens
for the Cincinnati Exposition.

During the year the collection of alcoholic birds was transferred from
the basement of the Smithsonian to the Laboratory building, and while
some little work has been done in the way of arranging and caring for
them, a great deal of labor will be required to place this valuable col-
lection in thoroughly good order.

Considerable time was spent in assorting the large and valuable col-
lection of bones of the extinct great Auk, secured by the Grampus ex-
pedition, and besides a mounted skeleton, other preparations have been
made relating to the history of this interesting bird.

The following table gives a summary of the material received and of
the work of preparation accomplished during the year :

The Secretary of the Treasury has on several occasions aided the
scientific work of investigators by allowing the free passage of scien-
tific outfits. Much valuable assistance has, through the courtesy of the
Department, been extended to explorers and collectors by the customs
officers at various points.

Life-Saving Service.—For several years past the Smithsonian Institu-
tion has, through the kindness of Hon. S. I. Kimball, Superintendent of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. (7

the Life-Saving Service, enjoyed the assistance of the keepers of life-
Saving stations at various points along the Atlantic coast, in the matter
of reporting the capture of whales and other large species of fishes.
As the result of this co-operation during the year a specimen of file-
fish, Alutera schapfi, was obtained from Capt. Herbert M. Knowles,
keeper of the life-saving station at Point Judith, Rhode Island. Cap.
tain Knowles also forwarded two specimens of Hpinephelus niveatus,
one of the smallest members of the family of “Groupers.” This species
is rarely found so far north, but is common in the West Indies and
thence north to Florida. From Amasa Bowen, keeper of the life-saving
station at Atlantic City, New Jersey, was received a pigmy sperm-whale.

France, Germany, Italy, and other nations, were also received from Mr.
Graves.

Revenue Marine Division.—During the year 1887 the assistance of the
Revenue Marine Division, under the charge of Hon. Peter Bonnett, was
asked in the matter of procuring for the National Museum specimens
of “bidarkas,” or Eskimo kyaks. Capt. M. A. Healy, then of the reve-
nue steamer Bear, was requested by Mr. Bonnett to obtain specimens,
if possible, on his next visit to Alaska. His efforts were successful,
and upon his return to San Francisco six ‘‘bidarkas” were placed in
the hands of the Alaska Commercial Company, with the request that
they be transmitted to Washington for the National Museum.

WAR DEPARTMENT.

_ Following the custom of previous years, the Secretary of War has
permitted the quartermasters of the Army to forward from their respect-
ive posts, boxes containing specimens of natural history intended for
the National Museum. This privilege has been of great benefit to the
Museum, and has resulted in the acquirement by the Museum of large
and valuable collections which, owing to the difficulty and expense ot
transportation by the ordinary means, would perhaps have been with-
held from transmission.

By authority of the Secretary of War, General 8. V. Benét, Chief of
Ordnance, transmitted from the Ordnance Museum a plaster model of the
equestrian statue of General McPherson; a section of an oak tree, cut
down by musket-balls near Spottsylvania Court-House, Virginia, and
presented to the War Department by General N. A. Miles, U.S. Army ;
‘a Mexican saddle and bridle, manufactured in Mexico for General Tre-
vino, commanding the northern line of Mexico, and presented by him -
to General E. O. C. Ord, U. S. Army, by whom they were deposited in
the Ordnance Museum on March, 23, 1878.
18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

In connection with the preparation for the Cincinnati Exposition of

heads. Lieutenant Carpenter has for many years been interested in
natural history research and his co-operation has always been very
highly prized.

Lieut. H. C. Benson, U.S. Army, stationed at Fort Huachuca, Ari-
zona, whose co-operation the Smithsonian Institution has enjoyed for
several years, has continued his excellent work in collecting specimens of
natural history for the National Museum, and during the year has con-
tributed the skins and eggs of numerous species of birds and several
reptiles. The skin of a Trogon, included in one of the sendings, differs
from all other specimens of 7. ambiguus in the collection, and may repre-
sent a new species.

eggs, and of Dr. H. C. Yarrow as curator os reptiles and Batrachians,
have been continued.

NAVY DEPARTMENT.

The Museum has received much valuable material during the year
through the co-operation of officers of the United States Navy. Com-
modore John G. Walker, Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, has, as in
previous years, given valuable assistance.

A large collection of ethnological objects, including spear-heads, pad-
dles, oars, clubs, feather head-dresses, wooden idols, specimens of tapa,
skulls, etc., were obtained by Paymaster W.J.Thomson on Haster Island,
and were deposited by him in the Museum, together with a series of

Dr. H. G. Beyer, U. S. Navy, continued to act until October, 1887, as
honorary curator of the Section of Materia Medica, at which time he
was ordered elsewhere for duty by the Department.

To the great regret of the Museum, Lieutenant Bolles, who has ren-
dered exceedingly valuable services in the Kthnological Department,
especially in connection with the work of classifying and arranging the
Eskimo collections, has been recalled, having been assigned to active
duty.

INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.

The National Museum is especially indebted to the Secretary of the
Interior for the disbursement of the Museum appropriations, which has
been very promptly and satisfactorily attended to by Mr. George W.
Evans, disbursing clerk of the Department of the Interior.

Patent Office—Two valuable ancient Greek coins have been con-
tributed by Alexander Scott.

Indian Office—A sketch of a fish was forwarded by Charles Wil-
loughby, of Quinaielt Agency, Washington Territory, with a request
for identification. The fishitself was transmitted later, and proved to
be a new genus and species. In honor of Mr. Willoughby the scientific
name of Acrotus willoughbyi has been given to this species by the Na-
tional Museum.

U. S. FISH COMMISSION.

Through the courtesy of Colonel McDonald the Museum has continued
to enjoy the valuable co-operation, as curators, of several attachés of
the Commission, and collections made by the vessels of the Fish Com-

mission have been transferred to the custody of the Museum. This
co-operation between the Smithsonian Institution and the Fish Com- ~
mission has existed since the organization of the latter, at which time
Prof. Spencer F. Baird, then Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, was appointed U. S. Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries,
and it is sincerely hoped that it will always continue.

The most important accession to the Museum, resulting from the co-
operation of the Fish Commission with the Museum, was a series of
collections obtained by the U.S. Fish Commission schooner Grampus
during her expedition to Funk Island, which was organized primarily
for the purpose of obtaining bones of the great auk. The expedition
was very successful, and in addition collections of fishes, bird skins,
birds’ eggs, shells, echinoderms, sea anemones, surface towings, crus-
tacea, copper ores, fossil shells, living birds, skins and skulls of meadow
jark, and rocks were made and transferred to the Museum. Dr. T. H.
Bean, while engaged in work for the Commission on the coast of New
Jersey, collected fishes, crabs, star-fishes and sea-urchins in the vicinity of
Great Egg Harbor. Fishes and cray-fishes were sent from the Central
Station of the Commission, in Washington, from the Wytheville Station,
in Virginia, and from the station at Havre de Grace, Maryland.

Collections of fishes, crustaceans, and insects were received from the
summer station of the Fish Commission at Wood’s Holl, Massachusetts.
Important contributions of fishes, marine invertebrates, and mollusks
were received from the U. S. Fish Commission steamers Albatross and
Fish Hawk. Mr. Vinal Edwards contributed collections of fishes, birds,
birds’ nests, parasites, surface towings, crustaceans, and turtles.

The services of Mr. Richard Rathbun as honorary curator of marine
invertebrates, of Dr.T. H. Bean as honorary curator of fishes, of Capt.
J. W. Collins as honorary curator of naval architecture, and of Mr.
R. BE. Earll as honorary curator of fishes and of animal products, have
been continued, through the courtesy of the Commissioner, and sincere
acknowledgments are due for their valuable labors.

U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.

The Museum has enjoyed the co-operation of the officers of the Geo-
logical Survey, and this has resulted in much benefit to the Museum.

Dr. C. A. White continues to act as curator of Mesozoic Fossils; Mr.
C. D. Walcott, of Paleozoic Fossils; Mr. Lester F. Ward, as curator of
Botany; Prof. F. W. Clarke, as curator of Minerals, and Mr. William
H. Dall and Dr. R. E. C. Stearns as curator and adjunct curator, re-
spectively, of Mollusks.

Among the collections of fossils, rocks, ores, and minerals made by
officers of the Geological Survey and transferred to the National
Museum may be specially mentioned those which were collected by
Messrs. Frank Burns, W. G. Brown, Whitman Cross, C. W. Cunning-
ham, William H. Dall, S. F. Emmons, W. F. Hillebrand, L. C. Johnson,
R. H. C. Stearns, and C. D. Walcott.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 81

J.—EXPLORATIONS.

In October, 1887, a Department of Living Animals was organized, chiefly
for the purpose of affording opportunity for study in connection with
certain kinds of work then being prosecuted in the Museum. It was
decided that hereafter all gifts of living animals which might be offered
to the Museum would be accepted, cared for in the best manner possi-
ble, and exhibited, with due credit to the donors. It was also decided
that whenever it was found possible to purchase a living wild animal
for study purposes at a nominal price, it might be done. In accordance
with this determination, Mr.W. T. Hornaday was permitted by the U.S.
Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries to make a collecting trip on fish
car No. 1 to and through Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Ore-
gon, and Utah in the interest of this department.

Mr. Hornaday left Washington on October 8, with Mr. J. Frank Ellis,
in charge of the car, and proceeded westward. In the course of the
work of distributing fish the car made brief stops at St. Paul; Fargo,
Dakota; Mandan and Helena, Montana; Tacoma, Washington; Port
land, Oregon; Mountain Home, Idaho, and Salt Lake City, Utah. As
soon as it became known at those points that the National Museum
was ready to accept gifts of living animals, several specimens were
presented, and others of desirable kinds were purchased at nominal
prices. The most important of the animals collected and brought to
Washington by Mr. Hornaday were the following : 1 Columbian black-
tailed deer (Cariacus columbianus), 1 mule deer (Cariacus macrotis), 1
white-tailed deer (C. virginianus), 1 cinnamon bear (Ursus cinnamomum),
2 badgers (Tawidea americana), 2 red foxes (Vulpes fulvus fulvus), 1
cross fox (Vulpes fuluus decussatus), 2 spotted lynxes (Lynx maculatus),
5 prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), and a golden eagle (Aquila
chryscetus). All of these animals were brought back in the fish car, a
task which involved infinite labor and care. The trip, on the whole, was
a highly successful one, and the relations established with Western
hunters and collectors are certain to prove of value to the Museum. The
car returned to Washington on November 8, having traveled over 7,000
miles.

In the summer of 1887 arrangements were made for a joint expedition
by the U.S. Fish Commission and the Smithsonian Institution to Funk
Island and the coast of Newfoundland. The Fish Commission tendered
the use of the schooner Grampus, which was to be engaged, under the
command of Capt. J. W. Collins, in the investigation of certain fishery
problems, and Messrs. F. A. Lucas and William Palmer were detailed
from the National Museum to accompany the expedition.

An examination of Funk Island was made, and a large number eof
bones of the Great Auk were collected, including several crania and
many hundred vertebre, and leg and wing bones. The coasts of New-
foundland, of New Brunswick, and the Magdalene Island and adjacent

“H. Mis. 142, pt. 2——6

82 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888

islands were also visited with a view to collecting specimens illustrat-
ing the fauna, flora, and geology of the regions. The collectors were
very successful. They secured about two hundred bird-skins, a large
series of birds’ eggs and nests, fishes, mammal skins and skeletons,
marine invertebrates, fossils, plants, rocks, and copper ores.

Interesting collections were received from Mr. Charles H. Townsend,
who visited Centrat America by direction of the U. S. Commissioner
of Fish and Fisheries. The material obtained included plants, a collec-
tion of bird-skins numbering over three hundred specimens, a collection
of tropical insects, a small collection of mammal skins, skulls, and
skeletons, bird skeletons, birds’ nests, fishes, reptiles, stone implements,
and twenty-seven ethnological objects.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 83

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM,
Washington, June 1, 1887.
SiR: TA addition to your regular duties, you will take charge of the Smithsonian
and Museum part of the Minneapolis Exposition, and represent me in all transactions
with the board of management, as may be necessary under joint resolution of Con-
gress (No. 18). You will confer with me only upon questions of general policy, re-
lieving me entirely of all matters of detail.
As representative to the exposition, it will be necessary for you, at its conclusion,
to submit a report on same.
Very respectfully,
G. BROWN GoopE,
Assistant Scerctary Smithsonian Institution,

in charge of U. S. National Museum.
Mrs Wi. Vi. Cox,

- Chief Clerk National Museum.

Mr. Fred. Brackett, Washington agent of the exposition, was as-
signed to the duty of collecting and forwarding to Minneapolis the
exhibits from the various Departments of the United States Govern-
ment, and of receiving these exhibits on their arrival at their destina-
tion. To Mr. Brackett’s efficient discharge of these services, both in
Washington and Minneapolis, much of the success which attended the
Government display at the exposition is due.

Before the Government exhibit left Washington the board of man-
agers of the exposition gave bond in. the sum of $5,000 for its safe-
keeping while it should be in their charge, and, in addition, allotted
$850 to cover the expense of preparation, packing, and repacking the
exhibit, and for freight charges both ways. The car-load of cases and
exhibits left Washington for Minneapolis August 22, but did not reach
its destination till August 26. By hard work, however, nearly the
entire exhibit—20,157 pounds—was in order and ready for exhibition
on the morning of August 31, the day of the opening of the exposi-
tion.

The immense building, 336 by 556 feet in size, with floor space of 74
acres, provided for the exhibition, proved insufficient for the general
display, and the managers found it necessary to assign smaller space to
the Government exhibits than had at first been allotted. A part of the
ladies’ reception-room was, however, finally partitioned off as an annex
to the space for the display of the Smithsonian Institution and the Na-
tional Museum, which may be briefly enumerated as follows :

I. Ethnological exbibit, including prehistoric relics of America, casts, lay figures,

models, etc. An extensive series of casts of Indian faces, Zuni objects, etc.
Il. Textiles and fabrics.
III. Display in the department of metallurgy.
IV. Deer antlers and horns.
V. Casts of fishes of North America. :

VI. Photographs of Government buildings.
VII. Articles illustrating the composition of the human body.

The ethnological display included relies of the prehistoric tribes of
America, together with a large collection of EKskimo and Indian ecos-
tumes, carved dishes, spoons, children’s toys, and a collection of the
a

musical instruments and of the various war implements of the savage
tribes of this and other countries; models and lay figures dressed in
the costumes of different lands; and an extensive series of casts of
Indian faces, representing and accentuating race and individual pecu-
liarities and characteristics.

In the section relating to domestic industry many of the agricultural
implements in daily use in foreign countries, especially in China and Ja-
pan, were shown; also articles of clothing, cooking utensils, chop-sticks,
carpenters’ tools, ete.

There were also exhibited tablets showing the different stages in mak-
ing Japanese lacquer-work of the ordinary kind, and of the raised gold
lacquer, with explanatory cards describing the same.

In the department of textiles and fabrics the exhibit ranged from
the different varieties of hemp, flax, China-grass, worsted yarn for car-
pet weaving, and specimens of the different styles of carpets, to sam-
ples of the finest Italian and French silk-weaving. This exhibit also
included silk moths and cocoons in the various stages of development,
many specimens of unwoven silk, and a historical sketch of the silk in-
dustry in America, indicating the sources and varieties of the different
grades of silk.

In the department of metallurgy were shown fac-similes of some of
the most famous Australian gold nuggets.

In the division of natural history the display of antlers and horns of
the American deer was extensive, and there were also shown many
casts of the fishes of North America, besides other objects.

Large photographs of the Department buildings in Washington, and
of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum, their laboratories
and workshops, were shown. There were also many interior views of
the Museum, displaying articles that could not otherwise be shown.

Articles illustrating the composition of the human body, its daily in-
come and expenditure, were exhibited, with specimens of the chemical
elements and compounds of the body, and models of the articles of food
constituting a day’s ration for a man of average size.

The entire Government exhibit proved to have been so selected and
arranged as to attract attention to all its parts in about an equal degree.
So much interest, in fact, was felt that the exposition management
made repeated requests to keep the articles for the following year. In
spite of the great desire manifested to insure another exhibit in 1888,
the entire Government property was returned in November, having suf-
fered no injury beyond the breaking of a few panes of glass in the cases.

Tam greatly indebted to Professor Mason for valuable assistance in
arranging the ethnological exhibits, and to Professor True for like aid
in selecting and classifying specimens in the department of mammals.
Mr. Upham aiso gave efficient help in the matter of prehistoric relics,
and Superintendent Horan and Assistant Superintendent Steuart were
untiring in the work of boxing, packing, shipping, and installing the
exhibit.

CURATORS OF THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

PROGRESS OF WORK DURING THE FISCAL YEAR
ENDING JUNE 30, 1888.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY IN THE U, 8, NATIONAL
MUSEUM, 1888,

By Orts T. Mason, Curator.

At the commencement of the year a new assingment of halls was
made, rendering it necessary to modify the distribution of specimens in
west hall. In pursuance of the Museum policy to find a significant
place for everything that has a name, three concepts of different values
have been worked out. At the east door all the material from various
sources used in transportation on land has been brought together, com-
mencing with the simplest device for carrying burdens by the human
(freight carrier) pack animal or for traveling over snow, and ending
with the locomotive. All this material, after its selection, was turned
over to Mr. Watkins, in charge of the new section of transportation.

Another method of treatment is seen in the Eskimo department, just
completed by the help of Lieut. T. Dix Bolles, U.S. Navy. Here the
primary and ruling concept is a definite and well characterized area.
All the conditions of life are written. The highest realizations of this
life are from home resources. In later years European wrecks and
European influences have brought iron, tobacco, rum, ete. But anterior
to this the Eskimo lived in his Arctic home as though there were no
other people on theearth. Inthe court devoted to this area each Eskimo
art is traced from Greenland to Kadiak by specimens. If the Museum
lacks example from any one of these, a vacant space is left and speci-
mens sought to supply the deficiency.

During the coming year the same attempt wili be made with the
region lying between Mount St. Elias and the Columbia River, the
Great Interior Basin, and Polynesia. j

Another line of investigation has been still more special and all the ma-
terial is arranged accordingly. Irefer to bows and arrows. The object
is to file away type bows and arrows from every tribe on earth, so that
they can be laid side by side for comparison or can be treated ethnically.
Shallow boxes 5 feet long, 2 inches deep, and 2, 4, and 6 inches wide
are made of thin pine, all interchangeable. These boxes fit in a crate
which in its turn fits on a shelf likea book. On the outer edge or back
of this crate may be pasted a label indicating the contents. It is just
as easy to refer to the arrows of a particular tribe as it would be to find

87
88 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

a reference in a volume. The plan of indicating deficiencies in the
series 18 the same asin the Kskimo collection.

Another line of work pushed forward during the year is the ethnic
series. The object of this exhibit is to show representatives of all the
races of men in the most exalted manner practicable. The simplest
form is the colored photo in front and profile, properly colored and shown
on swinging screens. Another mode of exhibiting is by means of casts
of the heads of Indians and others, arranged by a scheme of races or
figures in costume, either singly or in groups containing male and female
or families. During the year models of an Eskimo family, of a group
of Zunis, and of a group of Pai-Utes have been placed upon exhibition.

The most valuable local series acquired has been that of Paymaster
William J. Thomson, U.S. Navy, from the Easter Islands.

In connection with my work I glean from all sources the scraps of
valuable information which can be gathered from the books of travelers,
explorers, missionaries, commercial agents, etc. A regular system of
card cataloguing is used, each separate statement written on a distinct
slip and these placed in drawers, together with newspaper cuttings,
excerpts, and pamphlets relating to the same subjects.

Prof. G. Stanley Hall, of Johns Hopkins University, has made use
during the year of the resources of the collection, in investigating the
subject of mythology from the psycho-physical point of view, the pur-
pose of his studies being to trace the phases of hypnotism and kindred
phenomena known in our day to something akin in savagery and among
primitive people.

During the early months of the year much time was expended in pre-
paring a Series of specimens for the Minneapolis Exposition, and later,
a still greater display was prepared for Cincinnati.

Papers have been prepared for publication on the Quinaielt Indians
of Washington Territory, on the Stone Age in Washington Territory,
on the arts of the Navajo, and on the cradles of the American abo-
rigines.

Extensive exchanges of specimens have been effected with Mr. Lov-
ett, of England, and Professor Putnam, of Peabody Museum.

In a course of Saturday lectures delivered in the Museum the follow-
ing were on anthropological subjects:

Prof. HERBERT B. ADAMS: University Extension in England, Bal-
timore, and Washington.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES IN THE U, S,
NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888,

By Cyrus ADLER, Assistant Curator.

The Section of Oriential Antiquities of the U. S. National Museum
was formally organized on February 2, 1888, by the appointment of
Paul Haupt, Ph. D., professor of the Semitic languages in the Johns

‘Hopkins University as honorary curator, and of Cyrus Adler, Ph. D.,
instructor in Semitic languages at the same University, honorary assist-
ant curator.

The steps which led to the organization of this section were taken
almost a year previous. In March, 1887, a letter was addressed to the
late Prof. Spencer F. Baird, calling attention to the importance of Ori-
ental archeology, and more especially Assyriology, and recommending
that the National Museum add this to its numerous departments of
study and research. The illness and subsequent death of Professor
Baird delayed official action in the matter, but the work was tentatively
inaugurated at the beginning of the fiscal year.

In July, 1887, a portion of a collection of Assyrian and Babylonian
seals gathered by the late Rev. William Frederick Williams, an Ameri-
can missionary at Mosul, was placed at the disposal of the Museum for
copying purposes, by the present owners, Mr. R.S. Williams, of Utica,
Dr. G. H. Williams, of Baltimore, Mr. Talcott Williams, of Philadel-
phia, Miss C. D. Williams, Mr. P. V. Rogers, and Dr. A. G. Bower.

The Museum modelers were so successful in producing fac-similes_
and flat impressions of these objects that the following announcement
was made at the fail meeting of the American Oriental Society, held
at Baltimore in October, 1887:

The National Museum at Washington has undertaken the formation of a study-
collection of casts of Assyrian and Babylonian antiquities in association with the
Johns Hopkins University of Baltimore. The Museum stands ready to make fac-
similes and casts of Assyrian and Babylonian antiquities. An attempt is being made
to first obtain copies of Assyrian antiquities preserved in this country. The Johns
Hopkins University will attend to the proper arrangement and cataloguing of the

93
94 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Assyrian collection in the National Museum, under the supervision of Dr. Paul
Haupt, professor of Semitic languages, and Dr. Cyrus Adler, assistant in the Semi-
tic courses, who will also cooperate in the work of forming the collection and of
securing the loan of objects to be copied.*

Through the courtesy of the Rey. Dr. J. Packard, of the Episcopal
Theological Seminary at Alexandria, Virginia, the Museum was per-
mitted to make molds of two Assyrian slabs of alabaster in the posses-
sion of the Seminary, received in 1860 from Dr. H. B. Haskell, mission-
ary-physician at Mosul. .

Prof. A. Crawford, of the same institution, permitted the Museum
modelers to make a mold from his cast of the black obelisk of Shalman-
eser, and of the so-called Egg of Sargon I, for the Cincinnati Exposi-
tion, when it became evident that the British Museum could not fur-
nish these objects in time.

The Rev. A. N. Andrus, of Painesville, Ohio, sent for copy an Assy-
rian seal purchased in Mardin.

The entire month of June was devoted to preparations for a contri-
bution to the Ohio Valley Centennial Exhibition, to which the section of
Oriental Antiquities contributed an exhibit of Biblical archeology. This
special department of study was chosen becanse in the field of oriental
research Mesopotamian and EHegyptian antiquities, especially such as
bear upon the Bible, are of most interest to the public. By Biblical
archeology is understood the study of the language, history, social life,
arts, and religion of the Biblical nationalities. This study is not a part
of dogmatic theology ; its results can command the same acceptance
accorded to anew fact reported from,a physical laboratory; its prob-
lems should be faced in the same spirit of fearless investigation into
the truth as obtains in other departments of scientific research.
Through it the Bibie becomes, in its form and to some extent in its sub-
stance, a new book. Many an allusion which hitherto had no meaning
or had Jain unnoticed, starts into prominence and throws a light over a
whole passage.t Nor are these investigators entirely confined to the
ancient world. Owing to theintense conservatism of oriental peoples,
a careful study of the modern inhabitants of western Asia may exhibit
in a new aspect the manners and customs of former times.

Proper names, dialectic forms, architecture, costumes, and, what is

more surprising, considering the numerous changes of faith which cul-
 minated in Mohammedanism, even religious practices have persisted in
the East through thousands of years. As there may be some objection
to the application of the term “‘ archeology ” to so broad a field, it might
perhaps be better if the more comprehensive term “ Biblical science ”
were employed to designate this study. Nor is the area covered less

extensive than the period of time. Roughly speaking, it would require
that one point of a compass be placed in Jerusalem, and a radius of a
thousand miles be selected to describe a circle which would include all of
the peoples with whom the Israelites came in contact during their na-
tional existence. On this basis an exhibit was prepared which will be
fully described in a special paper in the next annual report.

In March, Professor Haupt, under the auspices of the Saturday Lect-
ure Association, delivered a lecture in the National Museum on Exca-
vations in Assyria and Babylonia, portions of which are appended as
being explanatory of the objects of the new department. The lecture
was illustrated by charcoal drawings of the Rock of Behistun, of the
sculptures it contains, and a plan of the ‘ Tower of Babel,” prepared and

colored after the description given in the lecture.

EXCAVATIONS IN ASSYRIA AND BABYLONIA.

By Pror. Paut Haupt, Pu. D.

On the old highway from Babylon to Media, in the region which the
ancients called Bagistana, the abode of the gods, there rises, 1,700 feet
above the plain, a steep and precipitous rock, the front overlaid with
polished white marble, covered with reliefs of colossal figures. Nine
men, a rope around their necks, their hands fastened behind their backs,
approach a majestic person, treading under foot the body of a prostrate
enemy, and extending his left hand with an imperious gesture. Over
the whole group hovers Auramazda, the Persian god of light, blessing
the king and offering a royal diadem.

Ktesias, the Greek physician of Artaxerxes IT, aftributed the monu-
ment to the fabulous queen Semiramis; and at the beginning of this
century Sir Robert Ker Porter, the famous English traveler, believed
that the sculptures represented Tiglathpileser and the ten tribes, while
Keppler explained them to be Queen Esther and her attendants.

The French Government sent the architects Coste and Flandin to
examine the monument and copy the inscription of four hundred lines
in cuneiform or wedge-shaped characters. But they returned with their
purpose unaccomplished, stating that the monuments, ee 300 feet
above the ground, were inaccessible.

In the years 1835 to 1837 Sir Henry Rawlinson, then a young officer
in the East India service, succeeded, in the face of unspeakable diffi-
culties, and at an expense of more than £1,000, in copying a portion of
the inscriptions. Not until ten years later was he enabled to complete
his copy. In 1846 he published the first explanation of the inscription,
which commemorates the victories gained by the great Persian king
Darius Hystaspes over the rebels in the numerous provinces of his vast
empire. It is composed in three different languages. Just as the gov-
ernor of Bagdad in our days, if he wishes to be understood by the vari-
ous races under his charge, has to draw up his edicts in Turkish, Arabic,

and Persian, so the inscriptions of the Achemenian kings were accom-
panied by parallel translations of the old Persian original, one for the
inhabitants of Susiana, the Elam of Scripture, the other in a language
akin to modern Arabic and the sacred tongue of the Old Testiment, rep-
resenting the speech of the Persian province of Assyria, formerly the
center of the great Mesopotamian empire, which had succumbed to the
Persian conquerors after the fall of Babylon.

The trilingual inscriptions on the rock of Behistun are the foundation
of the grand edifice erected by Assyriology out of the rubbish of the
Assyrian palaces and the temples of Babylon.

The decipherment of the old Persian wedge-writing in 1802, one of
the most remarkable achievements of modern science, due to the genius
of a young instructor at the college of Gottingen, George Frederick
Grotefend, made it possible to solve the mystery of the parallel versions,
in the languages of Elam and Mesopotamia.

At first the study of these texts in the intricate Assyro Babylonian
script promised but little reward. But suddenly the excavations in the
valley of the Euphrates and Tigris revealed numerous inscriptions ex-
hibiting the same system of writing, thus rewarding the decipherment of
the old Persian cuneiform texts in a way not dreamed of. Stamped on
bricks in the walls of the building, buried on clay prisms and barrel
cylinders, in the foundations of temples and palaces, spread over marble
and alabaster slabs, on the floors and walls of the royal apartments,
carved on statues, obelisks, and colossal cherubim, inscribed on terra-
cotta tablets, gathered into extensive libraries—a new literature, almost
boundless in its extent and scope, was recovered from the ruins of ages.

Nineveh, the great stronghold on the Tigris, founded by Nimrod, the
mighty hunter before the Lord; Nineveh, of which the Prophet Nahum
said that she was fnll of men like a pool full of water, her merchants

multiplied above the stars of heaven; Nineveh, the abode of Shalmane- -

ser, Sennacherib, Sardanapalus, whence poured forth over all western
Asia the irresistible Assyrian hosts like swarms of locusts; Nineveh,
which seemed to have vanished from the face of the earth, a desolation
for beasts to lie down in, was awakened to new life by the spade of the
explorer and the penetration of the decipherers. The authentic witnesses
of old Assyrian history and culture were freed from their subterraneous
dungeon, their tongues loosened to living words.

As at the beginning of this century the sepulchres of the Pharaohs had
disclosed their secrets, so the palaces of Nineveh, the walls and towers
of Babel, arose from the ruins beneath which they had lain buried for
more than two thousand years. In the valley of the Euphrates and
Tigris, which had watered Paradise, the abode of the first parents of
mankind, where the great flood burst forth, where Nimrod founded his
first kingdom, where the great Tower of Babel stood, whence the Lord
confounded the language of mankind, scattering them abroad over the
face of the whole earth, in the home of Abraham, the birth-place of the

chosen people, on the sacred soil of man’s earliest traditions, the tire-
less explorers unearthed extensive records of Nebuchadnezzar and Bel-
shazzar, the account of the Tower of Babel, which the great Babylonian
king restored, the annals of Sennacherib, with his campaign against
Hezekiah of Judah.

And of Sennacherib’s father, Sargon, who led Israel into captivity,
monuments still more wonderful were in store for the explorer. Paul
Emile Botta, French consul at Mosul, between the years 1842 and 1845,
disinterred the entire residence of this great Assyrian king, including
temple, observatory, palace with the harem, store-houses, even the
bakery and the wine-cellar. From his trenches and tunnels the French
archeologist saw himself transported, as by magic, to the magnificent
halls whence three thousand years ago half the world was ruled. He
beheld the awful figure of the conqueror of Samaria, seated on his
throne or standing in his chariot; saw his vassals worshiping before
him, saw his exploits in war, his adventures in the chase, his banquets ;
he walked with the Assyrian gods and in the assembly of their priests,
and all that presented itself to his marveling eye was as vivid, as real,
as if Sargon’s court had beeit quickened from the dead.

The fruits of these extensive excavations were transported in 1846
to France, where they now ornament the Paris Louvre.

At about the same time Austen Henry Layard uncovered in the
mounds of Kouyundjik and Nebi Yunus, opposite Mosul, the site of
ancient Nineveh, palaces of Shalmaneser, Tiglathpileser, Sennacherib,
Esarhaddon, and Sardanapalus. Countless sculptures and inscriptions,
weapons, helmets, trappings, tools, weights, furniture, vases, jewels,
objects of bronze and ivory, were brought to light and transferred to
the last asylum of so many a lost race, the British Museum, filling there
five large galleries; while before Layard’s labors a case scarcely 3 feet
square inclosed al! that remained, not only of the great city, Nineveh,
but of Babylon itself.

In 1854 Hormuzd Rassam, working under Layard’s directions, dis-
covered in a palace of Sardanapalus, at Nineveh, the greatest treas-
ure of Assyriology, the library of the last Assyrian king; thousands of
terra-cotta tablets, inscribed with minute cuneiform characters, con-
taining historical records and chronological statements; letters, dis-
patches, reports, addresses, and petitions; deeds, bonds, and contracts ;
hymns, psalms, prayers, songs, and proverbs; lists of gods and their
temples; incantations, charms, and omen tablets; lists of countries,
cities, rivers, canals, mountains, stars, animais, plants, minerals; gram-
matical texts, including paradigms, vocabularies, list of characters, exer-
cises in both Assyrian and the language of the primitive inhabitants of
the country, the so-calied Sumero-Akkadian; mathematical works, cal-
culations, tables of measures of length, of cube and square roots; as-
tronomical observations, calendars—every conceivable branch of litera-
sure being represented.

While thirty years agothere was hardly an ancient monarchy shrouded
in deeper obscurity than the Mesopotamian Empire, we are now more
familiar with the Assyrians than with any other nation of the ancient
East.

After Layard’s return from Mesopotamia the excavations were con-
tinued by Sir Henry Rawlinson, the geologist William Kennet Loftus,
and the British vice-consul at Basra, John EH. Taylor.

Loftus uncovered the ruins of Warka, the Erech of Nimrod, and Sen-
kereh, the ancient Larsa or Ellassar, whose king, Arioch, was smitten by
Abraham in the Vale of Siddim. And in the ancient Babylonian home
of Abraham, Ur of the Chaldees, the present Mugheir, John H. Tayler
disinterred the great temple of the Moon-God. In the four corners of
the sanctuary he discovered four copies of the famous cylinder inserip-
tion in which the last king of Babylon, Nabonidus, prays to the Moon-
God to fix the awe of his great divinity firmly in the heart of the king’s
first-bora son, Belshazzar, that he may never fall into sin.

But these sites of South Babylonia are still virgin soil; Loftus and
Taylor had neither the time nor the necessary assistance to undertake
systematic researches. Since 1854, when Laylor spent two weeks at
Mugheir, Ur of the Chaldees has not been visited by asingle explorer.

While Loftus and Taylor were engaged at Erech and Ur, the French
Government sent an expedition to Babylonia under the direction of
Fresnel, the architect Thomas, and the young German orientalist, Julius
Oppert, at present the most distinguished Assyriologist of France,
whose works on the Assyro-Babylonian inscriptions were afterwards
rewarded by the great national prize of 20,000 francs, as ‘‘ the discovery
which had brought France the highest honor and the greatest profit.”
The French expedition remained in Babylonia for three years, making
especially a thorough topographical survey of the ruins; but the price-
less collection of antiquities, including cylinders, urns, and alabaster
vases, statues, gold and silver objects, was sunk in the waters of the
Tigris on the 23d of May, 1855, owing to a deplorable accident, or, as
others termed it, sheer carelessness and mismanagement, while Julius
Oppert pleasantly speaks of these antiquities as ‘the collection of
which the river Tigris has made itself the temporary curator.”

New interest was excited in 1872, when the clever young English
Assyriologist, George Smith, discovered the cuneiform account of the
Deluge. Among the fragments from the library of Sardanapalus treas-
ured up in the British Museum he lighted upon half of a curious terra-
cotta tablet containing the words ‘the ship rested upon the mountain of
Nizir; then I sent forth a dove; the dove went and returned, and finding
no resting place, she came back to the ship.” He recognized at once
that he had found a portion of the Chaldean account of the Flood, and
with unwearied patience he set himself to search for the remainder of
the story. Hesucceeded in obtaining quite a number of additional frag-
ments, and made out that the Flood tablet formed the episode of a great
4

SECTION OF ORIENWAL ANTIQUITIES. 99

epic of early Chaldea, now generally known by the name of the Baby-
lonian Nimrod Epic, which celebrates in twelve cantos, corresponding
with the signs of the zodiac, the exploits of the ancient king of Erech.

The Chaldean account of the Deluge is especially valuable in as much
as it proves that the Biblical story of the Flood is the echo of an his-
torical fact. The great geologist, Edward Suess, one of the leading
politicians of Vienna, has shown in a special monograph, prepared with
my co-operation some years since, that the catastrophe known by the
name of the Deluge happened on the Lower Euphrates, involving an
extensive and devastating inundation of the lower part of Mesopotamia,
the essential cause being a great earthquake in the region of the Per-
sian Gulf, or farther down south, preceded by several slight shocks.
And it is very probable that during the period of the heaviest shocks
a cyclone moved northward out of the Persian Gulf. Certainly the tra-
ditions of other peoples in no way justify the assumption that the Flood
extended beyond the regions of the Lower Euphrates and Tigris, let
alone that it was a universal inundation.

Smith gave the first translation of the Flood tablet and an account
of the Nimrod Epic in a lecture delivered before the London Society of
Biblical Archeology on the 3d of December, 1872. His find attracted
such widespread attention that the editor-in-chief of the London Daily
Telegraph, Mr. Edwin Arnold, came forward and offered George Smith
a thousand guineas for fresh researches at Nineveh, to recover more of
these invaluable tablets. Smith started at once, and his efforts were
crowned with success. The first day, immediately after his arrival, he
found a new fragment of the Flood tablet, containing the command to
build the ark, and not far from it, in the same trench, a piece of the
Babylonian account of the Creation. A whole cuneiform series of par-
allel legends to the early chapters of the first book of Moses was brought
to light and given to the world by George Smith in his admirable work,
‘The Chaldean Account of Genesis.”

Twice again Smith went to Assyria. In 1875 he acquired a collection
of three thousand clay tablets which Arabs had found in large stone
jars near the ruins of Babylon. These stone jars represented the safe
of a great Jewish banking house, Egibi & Sons, ¢. ¢., Jacob, in Babylo-
nian pronunciation. The business transactions of the Babylonian court
had been intrusted to this firm for centuries, ever since the time of
Nebuchadnezzar. We see all the various classes, from the highest offi-
cer down to the lowest slave, thronging the courts of this great finan-
cial establishment, thus unrolling for us a vivid picture of ancient
Babylonian life.

When George Smith sojourned in Mesopotamia for the third time he
was forced back by an outbreak of the oriental plague at Bagdad. He
never returned to his native land. A premature death cut short his
brilliant career. On the 19thof August, 1876, he expired, at Aleppo.

After this sad bereavement, keenly felt by all interested in Biblical
100 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

research, Hormuzd Rassam, who had assisted Sir Austen Henry Layard
at the discovery of Nineveh in 1845, was designated by the British
Museum to conduct the excavations.

Since then he has three times revisited the Mesopotamian sites, mak-
ing new discoveries of great importance. In Nimrud, the site of the
ancient Chalah, he excavated a great temple of King Assurnacirpal,
the father of Shalmaneser IJ, and 9 miles northeast of Nineveh he suc-
ceeded in disinterring the famous bronze ornaments from the palace
gates of Balawat. In the east part of the mound of Balawat he un-
earthed another temple of King Assurnagirpal. Near the altar was
found an alabaster coffer containing two alabaster tablets, a third stone
tablet with the same inscription being deposited on the altar. The
discovery called forth a tremendous excitement in Mosul and the sur-
rounding villages. Like wild fire the rumor spread that the Mosaic
stone tables of the Covenant had been brought to light; just as the
Arabs, when the first colossal head of one of the winged bulls was un-
earthed in 1845, came running to Sir Henry Layard, urging their mares
to the top of their speed, and exclaiming: ‘‘ Hasten, Bey; hasten to the
diggers, for they liave found Nimrod himself. Wallah, it is wonderful,
but itis true ; we have seen him with our owneyes. Ld ilaha illa huwa ;
there is no God but He, the living, the eternal.” During his last expe-
dition, undertaken in the years 1880~’81 and extending over eighteen
months, Rassam discovered the archives of the ancient temple of the
Sun-God of Sippar, the Biblical Sepharvaim, one of the oldest Baby-
lonian cities, where the god Ea, or Kronos, bade the Chaldean Noah
bury the records of the time before the Flood.

Excavating in the ruins of Sippar, now represented by the site of
Abu-Habbah, midway between Babylon and Bagdad, he came across a
great square edifice, and beneath the floor of one of the rooms he dis-
covered an alabaster coffer with numerous tablets, one of them contain-
ing a curious sculpture representing the Holy of Holies, the Sun-God
seated on a magnificent throne ornamented with cherubim, and grasp-
ing in his hand a short wand and ring, the symbol of eternity.

Rassam also examined again the palaces of Sennacherib at Nineveh,
recovering from the ruined library more than fourteen hundred new terra-
cotta fragments. And in one of the walls of the palace he found a new
decagon or clay prism, more than a cubit high, and containing in twelve
hundred lines of cuneiform writing the annals of the last great king of
Assyria, Sardanapalus. In the northeast corner of the terrace of the
tower of Babel he discovered the palace occupied by Nabonidus during
the siege of Babylon by Cyrus, and the British Museum subsequently
acquired the cuneiform annals of the last Babylonian king, relating to
the capture of Babylon by Cyrus and the events which preceded and led
toit. Amongst many other things brought by Rassam from the excava-
tions at Babylon, for instance a bronze door-sill whose metal even now
represents a value of more than $400, there was also a clay cylinder of
SECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES. 101

Cyrus, containing an account of the taking of Babylon, and giving the
genealogy of the great king. Sir Henry Rawlinson says that it is per-
haps the most interesting cuneiform document that has been yet dis-
covered.

While Rassam was digging in North Babylonia, under the auspices of
the British Museum, M. Ernest de Sarzec, the French vice-consul at
Basra, near the mouth of the Euphrates and Tigris, found in the ruins
of Telloh, on the canal Shatt-el- Hai, a number of colossal statues, four
standing and four seated, covered with archaic inscriptions of the ancient
Chaldean king Gudea, who reigned about four thousand years B. C.
One of the seated figures holds on the knees a diagram with a plan of a
city or fortress, and an accurate rule. The collection, which is exceed-
ingly important for the history of early Chaldean art, was purchased for
the Louvre at a price of 150,000 frances, and forms a most valuable addi-
tion to the Paris antiquities from Mesopotamia.

But since these remarkable discoveries were made all digging on the
Mesopotamian sites has practically come to a stop. There is a strong
opposition now on the part of the Turkish authorities to archeological
research by agents of European countries. The superintendent of the
British excavations himself states that the attitude assumed by the
British Government in the Egyptian difficulty has alienated the’good
feeling of the Sublime Porte towards the English, and the Sultan not
caring to grant them any favors, everything has gone against them
And France, as well as the other continental puwers, is not able to
take up this scientific mission.

Now I should like to ask, is not America called upon to step in
here? During the last few years Assyrian studies have made such
great progress in this country that the eminent French archeologist and
chief-justice of the supreme court of Rouen, M. Joachim Menant, in a
recent work reviewing the development of Assyriology, declares that
the most serious efforts in this line are concentrated in America. There
are more specialists in this branch of Biblical philology here than in
England, and I venture to assert that they are not inferior to the Eng-
lish. Harvard, Yale, Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania,
Princeton, Johns Hopkins, and other universities, as well as various
theological seminaries in New York, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, An-
dover, Newton Centre, etc., recognizing the importance of these investi-
gations, have appointed professors of Assyriology, who have gathered
around themselves a band of zealous workers.

It can be confidently stated that if a national expedition, composed
of delegates from all these various institutions of learning, enjoying the
enlightened protection of the United States Government, and supported
by all who take an interest in the history of their religion, could be sent
from this country, it would yield excellent results, whose publication in
@ monumental work, under the auspices of our great national institu-
tion for the increase and diffusion of knowledge, would be a lasting
102 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

memorial of American scientific enterprise and scholarship. Every-
thing that is necessary for such an undertaking is here—self-denying en-
thusiasm, facing all dangers; thorough preparation, insuring suecess—
a fertile field for investigation, promising rich results; a magnificent
Museum, making accessible to the general public the treasures recov-
ered—everything is here. All we need is a fund.

I trust we shall not have to wait until it is too late. In a few years
political complications in the East may render it impossible to recover
any of these treasures.

For systematic excavations in the ruins of some ancient Babylonian
cities, especially in the home of Abraham, Ur of the Chaldees, the
present Mugheir, on the right bank of the Euphrates, near the junction
with the canal Shatt-el-Hai, it would be necessary to employ about six
hundred Arab laborers, under the supervision of a scientific staff com-
posed of about twelve persons, one-half Assyriological specialists from
various American universities and seminaries, and the others, as far
as possible, officers of the U.S. Army and Navy, including one or two
engineers, a surgeon, an architect, a photographer, and a business man-
ager, who might at the same time act as reporter and paymaster. The
expenses of the members of the staff would be about $5 a day, and
the daily wages for the native laborers about 20 cents, so that if the
expedition started from Europe about September 1, and conducted sys-
tematic excavations in Babylonia for half a year, the total cost of the
expedition would be about $40,000—one-half wages for the diggers,
and an equal amount for the expenses of twelve members of the staff,
their outfit in clothing, bedding, arms, saddles, etc., the passage to
Europe and thence to Beirut, the caravan from Beirut to Bagdad, which
would be under way for about fifty days, and finally, six months’ stay in
Babylonia.

In view of the importance of the undertaking it may be expected that
the various institutions represented on the staff of the expedition will
defray the personal expenses of their delegates, which would amount
to about $2,000 in each case; so all we need is a fund of $20,000 for the
excavations. If some public-spirited person should feel inclined to
present this amount he would be sure of grateful recognition on the part
of the whole civilized world. The expedition would go out under his
_ name, and the collection, to be transferred to the National Museum, as
well as the great monumental work embodying the results of all the
investigations, would forever be distinguished by his name. Every
single piece, too, of the thousands of sculptures and inscriptions would
be marked and always referred to by scholars all over the world as Y.—

I presume very few people in this country are aware what vast busi-
ness interests are connected with the exploration of Mesopotamia.
There is, for instance, the projected Euphrates Valley Railroad, between
Alexandretta, on the Mediterranean, and Basra, on the Persian Gulf, a
SECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES, 103

distance of about 920 miles, the cost of which would be about $36,000,000;
that is, estimated at the high rate of $40,000 per mile. Sir William
Andrew, in a remarkable lecture delivered before the National Club of
London in 1882, states that it is not too much to say that no existing
or projected railroad can compare in point of interest and importance
with that of the Euphrates Valley. It would be the shortest and cheap-
est route to India, saving about 1,000 miles in the distance between
England and India, thus reducing the time occupied by the journey to
ten days instead of twenty, and it would tend in a great measure to a
peaceful solution of the Eastern question, affording an additional guar-
anty for the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. It would promote com-
nierce, civilization, and Christianity, the progress, the freedom, and the
peace of the world.

The Porte had once promised a guaranty of 6 per cent. on the esti-
mated expenditure, and I dare say the English Government would be
willing to give an adequate guaranty at any time. The advances made
by Russia in Asia imperatively demand the construction of an alterna-
tive route to India. The Suez Canal might easily be rendered useless
through a few dynamite explosions, or the sinking of a ship, for months,
and perhaps for a year.

The section of the Euphrates Valley Railroad between Bagdad and-
Alexandretta would pay exceedingly well. There are about ten thou-
sand camels employed now in traffic between Bagdad and Aleppo, and
the price of conveying goods at present by camels and mules between
Aleppo and Alexandretta is from 15 to 25 cents per ton per mile. The
local traffic already existing in the country to be traversed would cer-
tainly more than suffice to pay the ordinary interest on this section.
The opening of the Euphrates Valley Railroad would be a great step
towards a recolonization and recivilization of Mesopotamia, looked upon
from the earliest times as among the richest countries in the world. It
has recently been shown by a most competent person that Mesopotamia,
after a restoration of the famous ancient system of irrigation, on which
the whole welfare of the country depends, and a national recultivation
of the incredibly fertile soil, might yield an annual revenue of five hun-
dred millions. That is not based on the imagination of an enthusiastic
Assyriologist, but on sobercalculations. I mention this simply to show
that there are other things to be had in Mesopotamia than Biblical an-
tiquities.

The Babylonian expedition might lay the foundation of a national in-
stitution similar to the American school at Athens, and we have al-
ready a place in the East which would be most appropriate as the per-
manent headquarters of this American school of Biblical archeology—I
mean the American college at Beirut. Thousands of dollars are sent
from this country to England every year for the Egypt exploration
fund. I can not conceive of any reason why American contributions
should go to support explorations under British auspices. If the Amer-
104 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

ican representatives of Biblical archeology found an adequate pecun-
iary assistance for their national undertaking we could soon have in
Washington one of the finest collections of the world.

It has been very cleverly said that archeology is like the giant An-
tacus in the Greek myth; we develop in strength as often as we come
in contact with the ground. I sincerely hope that we shail be able to
begin digging at no distant date. People in Europe would hardly be-
lieve that we have everything for a national expedition to Mesopotamia
savethe money. Such a project appeals to every one who takes an in-
terest in the dawn of civilization and the history of religion. The mon-
uments in the valley of the Euphrates and Tigris furnish the key to
countless mysteries in the early history of man. They answer a multi-
tude of questions whose solution is indispensable for a study of the de-
velopment of religion and culture. They add new leaves to the book of
man’s earliest traditions. They confirm and elucidate the sacred records ~
of the Old Testament. Chaldea is the cradle of the great race of Israel,
the birth-place of his ancestors. ‘To Chaldea we can trace the roots of
his nationality and his religion, and indirectly the roots of Christianity.
If we wish to have some knowledge of the primitive period in which the
chosen people developed, we must dig for it in Assyria and Babylonia.

It is true we can not recover gold, as the natives fancy. A treasure
of Priam will never be found in the sterile mounds of Mesopotamia. All
that we can unearth aresculptures and inscriptions, nothing but stones,
broken stones, but stones to which the word of Scripture applies: “If
men should hold their peace the stones wiil cry out.”
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF AMERICAN ABORIGINAL POTTERY
IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

By WiLu1AM H. Hoimus, Honorary Curator.

The work of cataloguing and installing the great collection of abo-
riginal pottery is practically completed; as a consequence little has
been done during the past year save to properly care for new accessions.
A brief statement of the additions is given below. This listincludes all
material received by the Museum directly, as well as all collections
made by the Bureau of Ethnology.

Through the collections made by the official agents of the Bureau of
Ethnology, 609 numbers have been added to the catalogue; through
exchanges, 2; through purchase, 304; and through donation, 20.

Four collections of considerable importance have been received by the
Bureau of Ethnology and will soon be formally turned over to the Mu-
seum. One of these is from the pueblos of Jemez Valley, New Mexico,
by James Stevenson; one from the Cherokee and Catawba Indians of
North Carolina, by James Mooney; a third from Chiriqui, South Amer-
ica, by J. A. MeNiel; and a fourth from Mexico, by Ward Bachelor.

The only researches made by the curator have been a study of the
origin and significance of the textile ornament upon the pottery of the
eastern United States, and a study made in the field of the relation of
the ancient and recent ceramic remains of northern New Mexico. The
former paper was read before the Anthropological Society of Washing-
ton and will probably be published by the Bureau of Ethnology, and
the latter study is not yet ready for presentation.

The last catalogue number of June, 1887, is 132955. The last cata-
logue number of June, 1888, is 134497.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

By J. ELFRETH WATKINS, Curator.

During the first half of the fiscal year, while serving as honorary cura-
tor, I was able, through the courtesy of the officials of the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company, to spend such time as I could be spared from my
duties in their service in the developement of the Section of Steam
Transportation. Owing to the limited time at my command little was
accomplished. Having become permanently connected with the Mu-
seum staff in December, 1887, increased space was assigned to the sec-
tion at the east end of the east hall, early in January. Shortly after-
wards the scope of the section was enlarged, with the designation of
the Section of Transportation and Engineering.

It is the aim of the Section of Transportation and Engineering to
present an object lesson that shall illustrate and preserve the history
of the devices man has used, the structures he has built, and the ma-
chines he has invented to promote travel and commerce and to convey
intelligence. Appliances used to generate power for manufacture, and
to produce heat and light, and others of a similar nature are tempora-
rily assigned to this section.

The science of engineering has been so intimately connected with and
interwoven in the development of the art of transportation, especially

_of late years, that the problems presenting themselves to the projectors
of railways and the constructors of steam-ships have evolved several
distinct branches of engineering especially devoted to their solution.

Since inventive genius has generally followed in chronological se-
quence, the system of arrangement to show development step by step
which prevails in the other departments of the Museum is particularly
applicable to this section.

Early in his existence, doubtless in prehistoric times, man’s attention
was directed to travel, as he was was compelled to use his intelligence
from the beginning to aid him to surmount the obstacles in the journeys
which his physical necessities required him to make.

Aboriginal methods of utilizing muscular force (in burden-bearing
and human and animal traction) and the power of the wind and wave

are placed at the beginning of the series devoted to transportation, of

which the machines and structures devised by the modern engineer to
accelerate locomotion and facilitate conveyance are the culmination.

It is believed that in museum administration no similar attempt has
previously been made to preserve by monuments the history of the
development of the appliances that man’s genius has contributed to-
wards the creation of the grand chains of intercommunication, the ex-
tension of which, link by link, has exercised so potent an influence in
accelerating our national growth, increasing our prosperity, and devel-
oping our civilization.

A number of objects which had previously been under the charge of
the curator of the Department of Ethnology were transferred to this
section early in the year. Among these are: Eskimo skin carrying
bags; Indian carrying baskets and meat cases; square cane-seat carry-
ing chair; a Madagascar carrying chair or “ filanzana” and a Chinese
palanquin made of bamboo; several Indian saddles covered with raw-
hide; two elegant saddles which formerly belonged to the King of
Siam, with bridle and reins; fine saddle presented to the President of
the United States by the Tycoon of Japan, 1861, and an elephant sad-
dle (howdah) from India; several dog sledges used by the Eskimo and
other northern Indians; sledges from Alaska; a reindeer, sled, and
mounted life-size figure of Laplander, from the University of Christi-
ania, Norway; the Red River cart; cart from Siam; caretta or ox-
wagon from New Mexico; specimens of harness, lassoes, and lariats
made by the Eskimos and other Indians of various tribes, together
with fine drosky harness from Russia, harness from Portugal, Mexico,
and South America, whips from Hayti, and saddle-bags from Daghis-
tan; snow-shoes of many types; sledges and toboggans.

Among the more important accessions of the year are: A model
(full size) of the locomotive “Stourbridge Lion,” a gift from the Dela-
ware and Hudson Canal Company. This model of the first locomotive
that turned a driving-wheel (August, 1829) on a railroad constructed
for traffic on the Western Continent has additional historical value
from the fact that it was an important object in the Constitutional
Centennial Celebration at Philadelphia in September, 1887, in the series
illustrating the progress in the art of transportation during the first
century of the nation’s existence under the Constitution.

In addition to this valuable model, the Delaware and Hudson Canal
Company have also donated four of the original driving-wheel tires,
three crank centers, and one of the walking-beams which belonged to
the “Stourbridge Lion.” It is the intention to place these in proper
position on the model as soon as practicable.

Another valuable accession is the original multi-tubular locomotive
boiler, constructed by John Stevens, 1825, for his experimental locomo-
tive, which ran for several years (1825-’27) on a circular experimental
track at Hoboken, New Jersey, deposited by the authorities of the
Stevens Institute, Hoboken, New Jersey.
SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING 109

The largest and most important accession of the year was received
from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, through the kindness
of President Spencer and Col. James Randolph, consulting engineer ;
this deposit consisted of a series of ten models, among them being—

A model (half size) of Peter Cooper’s experimental locomotive
“Tom Thumb.” This locomotive was experimented with on the Balti-
more and Ohio Railroad on August 28, 1830, near Baltimore. The tubes
in the boiler were made of gun barrels.

A model of the horse-power treadmill car, experimented with on the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1830.

A model of a sail car, experimented with in the summer of 1830 on
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad near Baltimore.

A model (half size) of the Grasshopper locomotive * Arabian.” Lo-
comotives of this type were introduced on the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-
road in 1831, and were in use for many years.

A model of the passenger car designed by Peter Cooper for the Bal-
timore and Ohio Railroad Company in 1839.

A model of a passenger “ stage-body” coach, in use on the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad in 1830, and for several years after it was opened for
traffic.

A model of the closed passenger coaches on the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad, which were first put in use in 1831.

Among the relics illustrating progress in the art of track building
the following may be noted: An original cast tram rail, from the track
from Penydarren Works to Glamorgan Canal, near Aberdare J unction,
Wales, upon which Trevithick’s first locomotive, to help man, ran in
1804. Gift of J. W. Widdowson, of London, England.

An original long stone sill and strap rail, from Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad. Laid in 1829. Gift of Col. James Randolph, consulting
engineer, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company.

An original stone block and section of rail and joint from the Camden
and Amboy Railroad, laid in 1831. Gift of the curator.

A model of the track of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad with f rail,
several miles of which were built by that company, 1844-45. Depos-
ited by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company.

Pennsylvania Railroad standard, 1888 (model), showing standard
track, with stone ballast, angle splice-bars, ditches, etc. Gift of the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company, through Joseph T. Richards, assist-
ant chief engineer.

The following important accessions illustrating improvements in the
appliances for marine propulsion were also received: Original patent»
granted to John Fitch, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by Louis XVI,
King of France, November 29, 1791, for his inventions for propelling
boats by steam. This, the original document, was discovered at the
destruction of the Libraire Nationale by the Commune in 1873. Itis
the gift of John C. Lang, Washington, District of Columbia.

As the log of the voyage of this vessel from Savannah (May 22, 1519),
under command of Capt. Moses Rogers, to Liverpool (June 20, 1819),
is in the collection, this contemporaneous lithograph is of particular
value.

The original steam steering-engine (the first ever made) applied to
the steamer Augusta, 1859, a gift of F. E. Sickle, the inventor, is a most
interesting relic.

Contemporaneous lithograph of the Kk. #. Stockton, the first steam-
vessel with iron hull or screw-propeller to cross the Atlantic, and a
piece of the original iron hull. Gift of the curator.

On the 28th of May I was directed by the Assistant Secretary, in
charge U. S. National Museum, to prepare a series of models, drawings,
etc., illustrating the history of transportation, for the exposition at
Cincinnati, and during the remainder of the fiscal year my attention
was entirely devoted to that subject.

A catalogue of the objects forwarded to that exposition will be pre-
sented in the next annual report.

The following is a brief outline of the classification adopted :

Class .—From the Atlantic to the Ohio Valley: Methods adopted
by the aborigines and early settlers. This class contained objects of
special local interest to the residents of the Ohio Valley and of the old
Northwest Territory.

Class 11.— Development of the American locomotive: This class was
divided into two series. Series No.1 included only such locomotives as
were either built in the United States or imported from England for
service ou our railroads. The methods of construction of many of the
locomotives included in the series of foreign locomotives (No. 2) were,
however, closely studied by the early locomotive builders in the United
States, who, in some cases, sent representatives abroad to investigate
and report upon the locomotives being built there. Many of these re-
ports found their way into the American journais devoted to invention,
and in some cases were published in book form, and thus had such im-
portant bearing upon the “ development of the American locomotive”
that a failure to make reference to them would leave the chain of inven-
tion deficient in many links.

Class IIT.—Development of the American passenger Car.

Class IV.—Development of the American rail and track.

Class V.—Development of the American steam-boat and modern
steam-ship.
SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING. at

Class VI.—Maps showing extensions of railway system in the United
States.

Class VI1.—Methods of transportation in other countries.

As this is the first attempt in the history of expositions to tell the
story of the development, step by step, of our great systems of transpor-
tation by series of models, drawings, and relics, the interest manifested
in the subject by those to whom I applied for assistance was most grat-
ifying. Had I not received their hearty co-operation little could have
been accomplished in the brief time allotted to the task.

The cordial thanks of the Museum are hereby extended to President
Spencer and Col. James Randolph, of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-
road; to Joseph T. Richards, assistant chief engineer, and W. J.
Latta, general agent, Pennsylvania Railroad Company, Philadelphia;
to Messrs. Burnham, Parry, Williams & Co., proprietors of the Bald-
win Locomotive Works; Harper Bros., New York City; Francis B.
Stevens, civil engineer, Hoboken, New Jersey; and Dr. Henry Mor-
ton, president of Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New
Jersey, for their assistance.

While the withdrawal of objects from the Museum collection for this
exposition will impair the educational value of the series to the vis-
itors of the Museum during the first four months of the next fiseal year,
it is hoped that the exhibit made at Cincinnati will stimulate the inter-
est of the people of that region in the subject that has added so largely
to their prosperity, so that ultimately the collection will be strength-
ened by additions from that quarter.

It is believed that when the series now at Cincinnati is returned, and
the objects, properly classified, become permanently installed, the Mu-
seum will possess a collection ot very great historical value.
REPORT ON THE SECTION OF MATERIA MEDICA IN THE U.S. NATIONAL
MUSEUM, 1888.

By James M. Fuint, M. D., U. S. Navy, Honorary Curator.

The former curator of this section, Dr. H. G. Beyer, U. 8. Navy, hay-
ing been ordered to other duty by the Navy Department in October
last, the section was left without an official head until April of this
year, although the present Curator was requested to look after the in-
terests of the collection during the interregnum, and gave to it a portion
of his time. There has been no assistance of any kind in the office since
October last, and only the results of the unaided labor of the Curator
for a small portion of the year can be presented, and these are naturally
not numerous or of great importance.

Few accessions of any importance appear upon the register. A col-
lection of Corean medicines, numbering two hundred and twenty-two
specimens, has been obtained by purchase for a nominal sum, and fills
out very completely the series of drugs from that country previously
received from other sources.

The whole collection has been moved during the year from the west
north range of the Museum to the east south range. The transfer made
necessary a re-arrangement of the cases to suit the changed conditions,
and as a consequence the systematic arrangement of the collection, so
far as it existed in the former location, was entirely lost. To restore
the classification involved the moving of the thirty-five hundred speci-
mens, most of them more than once.

It was found by experiment that the appearance of the collection
could be improved by giving to the interior of the exhibition cases a
lighter color than the standard maroon. To this end the cases have all
been repainted, involving the necessity of again moving all the speci-
mens twice. Some further transfers are yet necessary to perfect the
systematic arrangement of the collection.

In view of the growth of the collection, the variety in points of interest
and importance of the individual specimens, and the necessary restric-
tions as to available space for exhibition, a modification of the former
classification has been decided upon. Retaining the general features of
classification by natural orders, the whole collection is broken into sev-
eral series. The first will consist of the more important drugs in gen-

H. Mis. 142, pt. 2 8 113

114 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

eral use among civilized people, and known as “ official” or “ pharma-
copeal” drugs. These it is proposed to illustrate, as fully as possible
in the space allowed, by colored plates, photographs, drawings, etc.
Following this fully illustrated series will be presented the indigenous
drugs of the United States, not official, with references from the labels
to the illustrations, which will be placed in the pillar screens. In this
way case room will be saved, at some sacrifice of attractiveness, but
not of utility to the intelligent student. The collections, in many in-
stances quite large and interesting, of drugs from Mexico, Chili, India,
Japan, Corea, China, and other countries, will be placed in separate
geographical series, whereby their ethnological and botanical interest
will be increased without any sacrifice of their medical value.

The routine work, begun and to be continued, is the thorough label-
ing of the collection, giving to every object, whether drug, botanical
plate, or diagram, a carefully prepared label.

As at present exhibited the labels are without unity of method in
their treatment of the subjects, some of them being very elaborate and
technical, the most of them giving scarcely more than the name of the
article and the donor. It is proposed to take the specimens in regular
order according to the classification, prepare a careful label for each,
and take note of desiderata which the investigation may suggest, and
thus render whatever work may be done complete and permanent. To
obtain specimens seems to be the easiest part of the work, for every
large commercial drug-house in this and other countries appears to be
ready and anxious to contribute and to make personal effort to obtain
what is wanted.

Up to the date of closing this report (June 30, 1888) four hundred
and fifty labels have been completed and mounted in type-writer copy
for temporary service. A manuscript copy of these labels, with brief
explanatory and descriptive notes, has been made for the purpose of
publication at some future time, should it be thought desirable. The
present state of the collection may be briefly summarized as follows,
viz: Number of specimens registered June 30, 1887, 5,516; number of
specimens registered during the past year, 245; total, 5,761. Less du-
plicates and rejected specimens, 500; remaining, 5,261.

REPORT ON THE COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL RELICS, COINS, MEDALS,
ETC, IN THE U. 8, NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

By A. Howarp Cuark, Curator.

Among the principal accessions of the year is the war saddle of
General Grant, deposited by General A. H. Markland. This was used
by General Grant in all the battles in which he participated from Feb-
ruary, 1862, to April, 1865. It is a valuable addition to the large col-
lection of Grant relics received last year.

From the Bureau of Engraving and Printing was received a series of
India proofs, showing the backs and faces of all the current bonds and
currency notes issued by the United States, illustrating each denomina-
tion of Treasury notes and gold and silver certificates from $1 to $10,000,
and coupon and registered bonds from $10 to $50,000.

One of the most important additions to the collection of national
relics was deposited by Mr. Etting (accession 20719). Itis one of the
thirteen original pamphlets signed by George Washington, John Adams,
and other colonial delegates, entitled ‘‘Original Association of Con-
gress, October 20, 1774.” By this association the delegates pledged the
colonies not to import British merchandise after December 1, 1774, and
organized committees of correspondence in the several colonies, etc.
The pamphlet consists of nine printed pages, with two pages and part
of a third containing the autograph signatures of the delegates.

Several collections of ancient and modern coins were received from
M. W. Graves, Hartford, Connecticut; Mr. Thomas Wilson, Washing-
ton, and others.

A beginning has been made in the exhibit of coins toward illustrating
the money of Bible times by showing the coins of kings, countries, and
cities mentioned in the Bible, and specimens of the widow’s mite, the
shekel, denarius, ete.

Many additions have been made to the collection of military decora-
tions, medals, and badges of civic societies, including original decora-
tions of the Order of the Iron Cross of Germany, the Legion of Honor
of France, and other European orders.

From Mr. Stephen Vail was received a piece of the original wire, over
which one of the very first intelligible telegraphic messages was trans-
mitted during the experiments by Professor Morse with his telegraph

115
116 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

instrument at the Speedwell Iron Works, New Jersey, about the year
1840.

From the widow of Professor Baird was received a valuable collection
of nearly eighteen hundred toreign and American postage-stamps, gath-
ered by Professor Baird.

“Tne Ordnance ~ -;22sment, U. 8. Army, transferred to the National
Museum a number of interesting war relics, including a large section of
an oak tree riddled with bullets, from the battle field at pRemats
Court House.

To the collection of autograph letters and documents were added
commissions signed by each of the Presidents of the United States, and
deeds and letters, with autographs, of many eminent men.

To the Washington collection was added the original plaster model
of the bronze statue of Washington, designed by William Rudolf O’Dono-
van in 1887, erected at Washington’s headquarters, Newburgh, New
York, according to act of Congress of June, 1886. The attitude is com-
memorative of Peace, representing Washington in the act of sheathing
his sword at the close of the Revolutionary War. Accompanying the
statue is the certificate of the sculptor, in which he says: ‘ This statue is
the size of life, and in the matter of facts of proportion is correct, having
the small head, the long body, the narrow shoulders, and broad hips of
the three full-length portraits by Trumbull and of the statue by Houdon
in the State-house at Richmond. The head is from the life cast made
by Houdon at Mount Vernon in 1785, which has been little known to
artists and not at all to the public until within the last ten years, and
has not been used, save by Mr. O’Donovan in the making of this statue.”

The Smithsonian Institution during the year transferred to the Mu-
seum its collection of portraits of American and foreign scientists and
men prominent in political or civil life. This series includes nearly
twenty-five hundred engravings and photographs, and will be avaluable
nucleus for the formation of a national gallery of portraits of nepicseng
ative men.

A pair of silver-mounted flint-lock pistols, once the property of Gen-
eral Lafayette, have been deposited by Mr. William Burnett.

Last catalogue entry in June, 1887, 125335; first catalogue entry in
fiscal year beginning July 1, 1887, 125336; iast catalogue entry in June,
1888, 125887; total number of entries, 552, representing 1,016 speci-
mens; there are about 2,000 specimens on hand not catalogued.
STATEMENT RELATING TO THE COLLECTION ILLUSTRATING THE
GRAPHIC ARTS IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888,

No formal report upon the work accomplished in connection with the
collection illustrating the graphie arts, under the care of Mr. S. R.
Koehler, has as yet been published. The following letters are placed
on record to call attention to an important contribution, received from
Mr. J. W. Osborne, of Washington. Mr. Osborne is the inventor of one
of the processes of photolithography, still in general use, patented by
him in 1859, and he has since that time been familiar with every step
of progress in this department of the graphic arts.

Letter from J. W. Osborne transferring to the National Museum his collection of proofs
and specimens illustrating the development of photo-mechanical printing.

212 DELAWARE AVENUE, NORTHEAST,
Washington, D. C., June 6, 1888.

Drak Sir: Two or three years ago I told you of my wish to give the U.S. National
Museum the collection of proofs and specimens illustrating the development of photo-
mechanical printing, which was the result of my long practical experience and obser-
“vation of the several processes comprised under that term, and of my knowledge
of the men who practiced them. This earnest intention I have now carried out in
forwarding to the Museum last Friday a large box and seven other packages contain-
ing my whole collection and addressed to the care of Mr. S. R. Koehler, curator of
the section of graphic arts.

Mr. Koehler and I have spent many days in going over the numerous specimens
and have arranged them according to a crude classification, which must be recon-
sidered with much more care and judgment before they are fit for public inspection.
All the important and typical processes are represented in this collection by many
examples, and it is my wish that Mr. Koehler should divide the whole into two parts;
one for the U. 8. National Museum here and one for the Art Museum in Boston, to
which institution I intend then to give it. For this purpose the number of speci-
mens I have accumulated is, generally speaking, amply sufficient; but I desire in
all cases where a process is representel by a single print, or where a choice has to
be made between a good and bad example of some person’s work, or where the com-
pleteness of a series requires it to be kept unbroken, that the advantage be always
given in favor of the Washington collection. After this division has been made
there will still remain in very many cases a large number of duplicate copies, which
may accompany each collection. These may well be employed, when opportunity
offers, for the purpose of effecting exchanges with other persons possessing valuable
specimens, so as to increase and perfect the historical presentation here and in Bos-
ton. I request that prints so given to other collectors or museums may be marked
in some way indicating that they were originally donated by me.

117
118 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Of the general character of the photo-mechanical work in this collection, it may be
said that photolithography is more fully represented than any other of the photo-
processes classed with it, and that most of the specimens of all kinds will be found
to belong to a period extending from 1852 to about 1872. Photolithography predom-
inates for the reason that there was much more of it done in the years indicated than
of intaglio or relief work, the two latter not having reached a condition of commer-
cial importance till after 1872.

In this letter it would be unwise to attempt a full citation of the processes repre-
sented, experimental and practical, in the collection I have made, but a few of the
names of leading inventors and process-workers may be given with advantage, as
follows:

Lemercier, Barreswill, Lerebours and Davanne, 1852; Macpherson (?), 1852; Fox
Talbot, 1853; Paul Pretsch, 1854; Poitevin, 1855; Cutting & Bradford, 1858; Pouncy,
1858; Asser, 1859; Osborne, 1859; Lemercier, 1859; Col. James, 1860; Turner, 1861 ;
Burchard, 1862; Rehn, 1862; Pouncy, 1863; Ramage, 1863; Toovey, 1863; Osborne,
1863; Korn, 1863; Mandel, 1863; Swan, 1864; Dallas, 1864; Egloffstein, 1865; Leggo,
1865; Osborne, 1866; Willis, 1866; Korn, 1866; Henry, 1867; Woodbury, 1868; Hid-
litz, 1868; Rehn, 1870; Bierstadt, 1871; Edwards, 1872; Wenderoth, 1872; Leggo,
1873; Bien, 1874; Moss, 1850; Roche, 1881; Ives, 1881; Meisenbach, 1883; Sprague,
1884, and many others of jesser note.

In this citation of persons who have played a part in the development of photo-
mechanical processes several names appear more than once; that being done to indi-
cate that at different epochs their influence has been felt in the progress of those arts.
The above names, moreover, comprise most of those represented in the collection, but
not all those who did important and progressive work; as, for instance, Tessié du
Motay and Marechal, and some of their followers; also, some of the mere recent opera-
tors in intaglio and in relief. I should also add, that some of the inventions named
have been more closely connected with carbon printing than with those applica-
tions of photography having for their final object the production of impressions from
a printing press. This is not easily avoided, because of the close relation which
exists between processes belonging to either ciass, from a chemical point of view. In
this connection I will also state, that my specimens of carbon photography have not,
been included with the photo-mechanical work already sent you, but they are at your
disposal whenever you are ready to receive them.

The following very concise and meager statement of my own immediaze connection
with photo-mechanical work may have some value, and I append it in lieu, for the
present, of something more explicit which doubtless ought to be written.

In Melbourne, Victoria, in the winter months (May, June, and July) of 1859, being
tken an assistant in the magnetic observatory, I was detailed to make certain photo-
graphic experiments for the surveyor-general of the colony, Mr. Ligar. His strong
deter.nination was to engrave all the published maps, for the sale of land and other
purposes, on steel by the help of photography. My efforts for him (following Fox
Talbot) did not give results of any value. On the 19th of August of that year, despite
Mr. Ligar’s objection to stone as a crude material, I invented the photolithographie
process, which since then has been known by my name. On the Ist of September,
1859, application was made for a patent, which was granted in due course; and on
the 5th of November following the first photolithographic map for public sale was
published by the department of lands and survey. From that time to the present my
process has been used in Victoria without intermission for all the work which could
possibly be brought within its scope, the maps so produced amounting to many thou-
sands. On the 29th of November, 1859, I read a paper discussing specifically what I
had done at a meeting Of the Philosophical Society of Victoria, which was published
in its transactions. In 1862, with leave of absence for twelve months, I returned to
Great Britain to visit the Exhibition of that year in London. Then, having resigned
my position in the Victorian civil service, I went in 1863 to Germany to study litho-
THE COLLECTION ILLUSTRATING THE GRAPHIC ARTS. 119

graphy in its most perfect form. In Berlin, at the establishment of W. Korn & Co.,
I worked and taught my process for fourteen months. In 1863 it was adopted by the
‘Prussian Government for the production from original pen-drawings by A. Berg of an
important official work on the Prussian expedition to Japan, China, and Siam.

My next change of locality was to the United States, landing in Boston from Liv-
erpool in August, 1864. In 1866, under the laws of the State of New York, the Amer-
ican Photolithographic Company was formed; Sydney H. Gay, president. In the
autumn of that year practical operations were commenced in Brooklyn; Ezra Cor-
nell, president. In 1869 that company, at the request of Commissioner of Patents
Fisher, but at its own cost, reproduced the whole of one month’s current work for
the U. S. Patent Office, comprising about 1,900 drawings, and printed ten copies of
each. Assuperintendent I advised this, to prove conclusively that the process worked
by the company was fit for so large and unusual an undertaking. The effort was
quite successful and admitted to be so, but it was not until July, 1871, that photo-
lithographic reproductions of all the current workin the Patent Office were attempted
and executed up to date. That contract we got and held for three years, furnish-
ing each week the work done in that week, and printing besides the illustrations for
the weekly Official Gazette. An undertaking of such magnitude and difficulty had
never been attempted in the history of the graphic arts, and at the time was thought
by many to be impossible; it certainly marked an epoch, and is therefore worth
noting. For the last twelve or thirteen years I have not been officially connected with
the American Photolithographic Company, and need not follow its fortunes further.
The United States patents, too, under which it worked, have long ago expired, and
my process is used by many as I practiced it, or in a more or less modified form, for
tranfer to stone, or to zine when the latter is to be etched into relief for the type press.

The foregoing statement is necessarily very personal in its nature, but it will serve
to indicate something of the inducements and opportunities affecting my study of
the photo-mechanical arts, and to fix certain dates and a few other facts. Of my
knowledge of other workers in this field, of whom many were known to me; of my
estimate of other processes and their relation and relative value one to the other;
in short of any collateral matter whatsoever calculated to give the subject vital inter-
est I can say nothing that would not extend this letter to an inexcusable length.

Besides the photo-mechanical specimens which I have given the Museum, the col-
lection contains a few lithographic plates by such artists as Menzel, Feckert, Jen-
sen, etc., which will find an honorable place in the section of graphic arts.

Let me now express the pleasure it gives me to have put at last into such excellent
keeping a collection so difficult to get and preserve; one which has cost so much
labor, and which will remain so replete with instruction for those who wish to follow
the wonderful development of the graphic arts within the last fifty years. I look
forward with the greatest interest and expectation to Mr. Koehler’s classification and
arrangement of the whole, knowing how well his experience, thoroughness, and im-
partiality fit him for the work, and I rest confident in the belief that in your appre-
ciative care this collection will increase still further, and will be always a valuable
and accessible help to other men striving to advance.

Yours truly,
J. W. OSBORNE.

IN CHARGE oF U. S. NaTionaL MUSEUM,
Washington, June 12, 1888.

DEAR SiR: Your collection of proofs and specimens illustrating the development
of photo-mechanical printing has been received. The boxes and packages have been
placed in the work-room of one of our preparators, where it awaits Mr. Koehler’s re-
turn to Washington.

We are very glad to have the active co-operation of one who has done original work
in this direction. It is by such generous assistance that the National Museum has
been enabled to make such rapid strides during the past five or six years. I hope that
when your collection has been arranged you will be pleased with our methods of in-
stallation. Mr. Koehler has our fullest confidence in all matters of that kind.

I have no doubt that you will hear from Mr. Koehler before he unpacks the boxes.
I have sent him a copy of your letter and have called his attention particularly to
what you say in regard to sending a portion of the collection to the Art Museum in
Boston. I doubt not, however, that you have already.explained your wishes to him.

Assuring you of the hearty thanks of the Smithsonian Institution for your gener-
ous and most acceptable contribution to the national collections, I am yours very

respectfully,
G. BRown GOODE,
Assistant Secretary.
J. W. OSBORNE, Esq.,
212 Delaware Avenue, Northeast, Washington.

Letter from J. W. Osborne, calling attention to the foundation which has been laid in the
National Museum for a collection illustrating the processes employed in photo-mechanical
printing.

212 DELAWARE AVENUE; NORTHEAST,
_ Washington, D.C., October 25, 1888.

DEAR Sir: Herewith I send you copies of two letters which will interest those of
your readers who have given their attention to photography and its applications to
mechanical printing processes. The first of these letters I may supplement at once
by saying that additional collections of mine have since its date been added to the
specimens I then sent to the National Museum. Besides photo-mechanical work these
include photography, especially early carbon printing, as wellas many specimens by

‘processes in which photography plays no part.

My chief object in asking you to publish this correspondence (that course being the
shortest and most direct way of presenting the whole matter) is to bring to the notice
of experimenters, inventors, and collectors of graphic work, the important fact, that
a substantial foundation has been laid for an exhaustive collection of such productions
under Government auspices in Washington.

In the National Museum the exhibit made by the section of graphic arts, as pre-
sented for public inspection and study, does not as yet*include photo-mechanical
processes ; for there has not been time to effect a satisfactory classification and expo-
sition of my collection. Thorough analysis of that sort is indispensable in such a case,
and it always gives rise to much laborious research and comparison of dates and
statements in the literary record. At present the section of graphic arts embraces
drawing in several styles; etching on metal plates; engraving of different kinds, for
the production of both intaglio and relief plates and blocks; lithography in various
manners; color-printing ; and finally, electrotyping and stereotyping, as applied to
graphic multiplication. Besides the printed results flowing from the practice of these
THE COLLECTION ILLUSTRATING THE GRAPHIC ARTS. 121

arts (many of great beauty), all the necessary tools and appliances are shown which
are required in working the same, with explanatory matter in the form of labels and
printed statements.

This collection, though it covers much space and will strike every one as most in-
structive, is yet to be regarded as a nucleus only, about which the full display will
continuously grow toward completion. As planned, we shall have in this Depart-
ment in a few years a collection representing every known process, perfect in classifica-
tion and in chronological arrangement, and accompanied throughout by explanatory
matter which will give to every specimen a historical as well as a scientific interest.

In this country there are many persons possessed of early results from drawn and
engraved surfaces, with or without photographic aid. These are sometimes artistic
in their nature, and sometimes they indicate only an earnest striving in that direc-
tion. But they are all valuable historically or technically, and should be preserved
in such a way as to turn them to the best account. Asa rule this can only be done
by placing them in a public institution under the direction of persons whose knowl-
edge and experience insures a good estimate of their importance and of their proper
place in a classified collection. For such reasons I would urge those of my fellow-
workers in this field who have collections, for the disposition of which no definite
arrangements have been made, to communicate with Prof. G. Brown Goode, with a
view of donating the same to the National Museum. By taking this course, a per-
manent, I might say an ever-increasing, value will be given to what might in time
pass into the possession of unappreciative persons who cared little for the landmarks
of progress or the work it cost to reach them.

In my letter to Professor Goode a number of dates are given, some slight correc-
tions in which (not inserted) I have already made. These dates relate occasionally
to the time when certain inventions were made, but more generally to the time when
specimens of work in my collection were produced by inventors and other persons of
note. J am very anxious to be correct on the subject of priority, and if it should be
in the power of any of your readers to question the accuracy of these dates or qual-
ify them in any way, and they will doso by letter addressed to me at Washington, I
shall be very much obliged.

Yours truly,

J. W. OSBORNE.
The Eprror OF THE AMERICAN LITHOGRAPHER AND PRINTER,

12 Centre Street, New York.

In addition it may be stated that since these letters were written the
collection of specimens illustrating the photo-mechanical processes has
received many accessions, principally by gift, including a number of
collographic prints by Tessie du Motay (mentioned above as not repre-
sented in the Osborne collection), received from Mr. William Kurtz, of
New York, and avery complete illustration of the original Ives process,
including not only specimens but also models of machinery, presented by
the inventor himself. These, with a selection of specimens of great his-
torical importance, selected from the Osborne collection, and the gen-
erous donations of later work by firms at present actively engaged in
the United States in.the commercial exploitation of the various photo-
mechanical processes, are about to be placed on exhibition, and when
the collection of patents granted to inventors in this department of
applied science, which is now being made with the aid of Mr. J. W. Os-
borne, shall have been completed, the U.S. National Museum will find
itself in the possession of a collection elucidating the history and prac-
tice of photo-mechanical processes, unrivaled by any other collection of
the kind at present known to exist.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY IN
THE U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888, |

By Tuomas WILSON, Curator.

Dr. Charles Rau, for many years the curator of this department, en-
tered the service of the Smithsonian Institution in 1875, and was
placed in charge of the preparation of an ethnological exhibit for the
Centennial Exhibition in 1876, and he was subsequently appointed
Curator of the Department of Archeology in the National Museum.
Dr. Rau had been in poor health during the winter of 1886~87 and
had partially recovered, but was suddenly attacked in July and went
to the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where he died on July
25, from the effects of a surgical operation. His body was interred in
Oak Hill Cemetery, Washington, where a modest stone, bearing a suit-
able inscription, has been erected to his memory.

Dr. Rau bequeathed to the National Museum his library, consisting
of 715 bound volumes, and 1,722 volumes unbound, his archzologic
and ethnologic collections, comprising 2,000 specimens, and _ his collec-
tion of minerals and fossils.

The books comprising the library are now being arranged and cata-
logued, and will form the nucleus of a sectional library in the Depart-
ment. The archeologic specimens will, so far as possible, be kept
together and displayed under the name of their donor.

Almost the entire life of Dr.-Rau was spent in archeologie studies.
He was faithful, zealous, and devoted to his science.

At the time of his death Dr. Rau was engaged in the preparation of
a work which he had called “The Typical Forms of North American
Prehistoric Relies of Stone and Copper in the U.S. National Museum.”
“ This was intended by him to be an enlargement of his work ‘“ Arch:eo-
logic Collections of U.S. National Museum,” and published: April, 1876,
as Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, 287, the edition of which
had been exhausted. It was to have been followed by a larger and
more complete work which, with its illustrations, should represent the
entire field of American Prehistoric Anthropology. This he intended
to be the magnum opus of his life.

The line upon which the work left by Dr. Rau proceeded during his
life-time has not been changed except in some details. It seems de-

123
124 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

sirable, however, to extend somewhat the scope of the work, and to at-
tempt the preparation of but one volume instead of two. Mr. Wilson,
the present curator, has taken up the work of the Department where
it was left by the death of Dr. Rau, and proposes to complete the lit-
erary work which his predecessor had on hand. That work when com-
pleted and published will stand as a catalogue of the objects in this
department of the Museum, a work for which there is great need and
almost constant demand.

The existence of man on the Agnantigen continent, especially in the
United States, during the paleolithic period of the stone Age has for
many years attracted the attention and excited the interest of prehis-
toric anthropologists in Kurope as well as in America. Dr. Rau had
promised himself to give it his serious attention as soon as he should
complete the work he had then in hand. His death prevented his car-
rying out this intention. The need for it was pressing, and the discov-
ery of paleolithic implements in great numbers in the immediate neigh-
borhood of Washington City seemed to present an opportunity not to
be neglected.

Special investigations were begun, studies were made in the field,
local archeologists were asked to assist, to which they responded with
alacrity. A result of all this was the issuance by the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution of Cireular 36, which appealed to the archeol- °
ogists of the various localities of the United States to give such infor-
mation concerning the paleolithic implements, their existence, plente-
ousness, and geographic distribution as they might be able. This cir-
cular was issued in January, 1888, and the first response was received
on February 6. The names and addresses were obtained principally
from our own books, supplementing them with such museums and col-
lections as might be publicly known. Up to the 30th of June there had
been received two hundred and nine responses. A paper discussing
fully the objects of this circular and the information received in reply
is published in Section 11 of this report.

GENERAL REVIEW OF THE YEAR’S WORK.

From the middle of February until the Ist of June the entire office,
after the current daily work required, devoted itself almost exclusively
to the answers to Circular 36 and the replies thereto, and the further
necessary correspondence engendered thereby, and also to the arrang-
ing, cataloguing, and assorting the paleolithic implements received.

The outcome of this office work has established the fact of the gen-
eral distribution of these paleolithic implements over the United States,
aud, consequently, the existence of a paleolithic period on this conti-
nent. It at least establishes the existence and general distribution in
America of a civilization closely corresponding to that of the earlier
paleolithic period in Europe.

Without stopping to argue or demonstrate the truth of this conclu-
DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 125

sion or to enlarge upon its importance, we may safely felicitate our-
selves that our labors in this direction have been of substantial benefit
in the world of American prehistoric anthropology, and that as a result
of these labors the year 1888 will hereafter be reckoned as the date
when the existence of a paleolithic period in America and the occupa-
pation of our continent by man during that period was definitely estab-
lished.

In addition to the foregoing work I have been employed in the prep-
aration of the descriptive catalogue heretofore mentioned, of which I
have now a pile of manuscript, cuts, and photographs 6 or 7 inches in
height.

From the 1st of June to the 30th, and continuing into the present
year, the force of the office has, after the current business, been occu-
pied with the preparation, arrangement, and installation of the prehis-
toric exhibit at the Cincinnati Centennial Exposition.

The number of accessions to the collections of this department during
the year has been 109. The number of specimens received has been
6,972 ; specimens sent in exchange, 821; net increase of specimens, 6,151.

The principal accession (No. 19931) was the archzologic collection
of Dr. Rau, bequeathed by him to the U.S. National Museum. He had
been an enthusiastic archeologist and this was the collection of his
life-time. He added nothing to his private collection after his appoint-
ment as curator in this department. He bequeathed the following
objects:

Four hundred and seventy-four European (137071-137546), prehis-
_ toric; thirteen hundred and sixty-seven North American (137618-
138984), prehistoric, and eighty-nine of our modern Indian. The Enu-
ropean objects he had procured by exchange; the Indian objects were
for the most part those which he had procured either directly from the
Indians or from persons who had so received them. But the thirteen
hundred and sixty-seven North American prehistoric objects were for the
most part his own finds and the direct result of his own investigations in
the field. Some of his specimens were considered by him to be new
forms, those not theretofore known, and upon which he placed a cor-
respondingly high value. A spear-point, now displayed in the synop-
tical exhibit, from Washington County, Missouri, is of rose quartz.
The beauty of its material and the elegance of its workmanship caused
it to be prized highly by Dr. Rau, and it may be justly regarded as one
of the finest of its kind.

During the year many accessions of paleolithic implements were re-
ceived in answer to Circular 36. The greater number of these consisted
of only a few specimens, but they aggregated a great number. Among
the accessions the following are of sufficient importance to justify special
mention : :

Mr. Elmer R. Reynolds, of Washington City, sent (accession 20497,
Catalogue Nos, 139401139412) two hundred and fifty-nine specimens, of
126 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

which two hundred and seventeen were paleolithic, all from the Dis-
triet of Columbia.

Mr. S. V. Proudfit, of Washington City, sent (accession 20003, Cata-
logue Nos. 137060-137070) sixty-seven specimens, of which fifty-three
were paleolithic, and (accession 20358, Catalogue Nos. 139244-139289)
one hundred and thirty-one arrow and spear heads. All these speci-
mens were from the District of Columbia, and were intended by their
donor to constitute a series which would represent all forms of chipped
flint implements from this neighborhood.

Mr. Ernest Shoemaker, of Washington City, sent (accession 20175,
Catalogue Nos. 139007-134010) thirty-five specimens, the greater part of
which were of the paleolithic type, from the District of Columbia.

The curator has, during’the past year, assisted by Professors Gilbert,
McGee, and Holmes, and Messrs. Henshaw and Gill, of the U.S. Geolog-
ical Survey, found in the neighborhood of Washington, principally on
the hills and bluffs of Rock Creek and Piney Branch, a great number
of paleolithic implements. The accession is 20054 (Catalogue Nos.
137551-137583) and consists of two hundred and ninety-nine speci-
mens.

Prof. G. H. Perkins, of the University of Vermont, Burlington, sent

_ three collections (accessions 20554, 20734, 20878, Catalogue Nos. 139428-
139429, 139659-139666, 139724-139750), one hundred and fourteen speci-
mens, principally paleolithic, from northern Vermont.

Mr. Edward Lovett, West Burton House, Outram Road, Croydon,
England, sent, by accessions 18743, 20116, 20225 (Catalogue Nos. 139056-
139100, 189101-139125, 139126-139149), a collection of two hundred and
ninety-nine specimens, sixteen paleolithic. The collection comprises
implements and objects from England, Scotland, Ireland, and India.
There were small arrow-heads from Arabia, large fragments of Samian
ware belonging to the epoch of Roman occupation in England and there
lately discovered, many specimens illustrating flint flaking and the
mode of fabrication of gun-flints.

Mr. William Ransom, of Fairfield, Hitchin, England, sent (accession
20668, Catalogue Nos. 139466-139488) twenty-eight specimens, of which
eight were paleolithic, from England; neolithic implements from Nor-
way and Sweden, and fragments of Samian ware belonging to the
Roman epoch, from the city of London, found 10 to 20 feet below the
surface.

Another accession (21181, Catalogue No. 139817) which may prove of
importance is a flint implement of the rudest type, being merely chipped
to a point, or with an edge not more than‘an inch in width, which was
discovered by Mr. William Taylor, of San Diego, Tex., in San Diego
Creek, one-half mile from the town of San Diego. It was found by him
3 or 4 or more feet under the surface in undisturbed layers. Mr. Taylor
has found several other implements of the same kind, showing that this
was not a solitary or isulated case. This implement becomes important

i
DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 127

from the fact that it was found near the top of the equus beds of that
district, which have become celebrated in the paleontology and geol-
ogy of our country. The Mylodon, Glypdoton, Elephas, and three
species of Equus, all extinct animals, have been found fossilized in
these beds, and it seems agreed among scientists that these beds be-
longed to the Tertiary geologic period.

Dr. Edward Palmer has brought in an interesting collection from a
prehistoric cavern in the Bay of Angeles, 200 miles northwest from
Guaymas, Lower California. (Accession 20608, Catalogue Nos. 139533-
139621.)

Dr. Palmer sailed in December, 1887, from the port of Guaymas,
Sonora, for the station of the Gulf Gold Mining Company, established
in the Bay of Angeles, inside the island of that name, in the Gulf of
California and on the peninsula. In the immediate neighborhood of
this station he found a natural cave in the granite rock on the coast
facing the Bay of Angeles, looking eastward and about 30 feet above
the sea level. Debris had fallen so as to make the approach easy, and
had filled so as to make a large platform in front of the cave. Here
were strewn fragments of rock fallen from the cliff, some of which had
been used to wall up the mouth of the cave. A fine spring (laid down
in the charts) was just below the cave. The miners of the Gulf Gold
Mining Company had visited this spring, and seeing the wall at the
mouth of the cave had pried cut some of the stones. Digging with
their palletos (alpen stocks) they had exhumed some of the skulls,
which were left exposed to the air. This accounts for some being
white. Thus Dr. Palmer discovered the cave.

It was a prehistoric burial place and nothing more. When cleared it
was 6 feet wide and 5 feet high at the mouth, 9 feet deep, retreating
and narrowing to its farther end. There were seven skeletous in all.

No. 139533 was the bottom layer, made of rushes which were joined
and sewed together. We have three bundles. These were apparently
spread out to receive the corpses, the bones having been found thereon.
The skeletons were extended and the bones allin natural condition and
undisturbed, except the skulls dug out by the miners. The burial
place was evidently virgin.

The bodies had been put in head first, for they were now with their
feet toward the mouth of the cave.

In immediate contact with the skulls, as though they had been used
as coverings, were found the nets, three in number. Catalogue No.
139534. (For description and use of these nets as head coverings by
the aborigines see Venaga’s History of Lower California.)

No. 139535 is a girdle or sort of netted kilt made of twine for one
side and fiber bound in strips or bundles, say one-half an inch thick
and 8 or 9 inches long, for the other; the whole is covered with feathers.

No. 139536 is a woven belt 15 inches long and 3 inches wide, nar-
rowed at the ends to a single cord; seemed to have passed around the
waist and over all, possibly only in front.
128 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888. =

No. 139537 is a piece of cloth which would seem to have been the
foundation of the kilt, possibly on one (the front) side only.

The last three numbers seem to have a covering of feathers.

No. 139538 was another dress or apron in the same style, but made of
strands of human hair. They were cylindrical at the top, about one-
fourth of an inch thick, and 10 inches long. The strands were plaited
or fastened together at the top so as to make a screen, one side thereof
being covered as before with feathers. No. 139539 is another apron of
like manufacture with differences in the binding of the hair at the top.
Some had small shells strung and woven in.

Nos. 139540, 139541, and 139542 were pieces of fiber, six strands
woven together with five cross-ties, the whole 14 inches long, 25 wide,
but doubled in the center to 7 inches—probably worn under the breech
clout.

Nos. 139543 and 139544 were bunches of fiber twisted and matted,
showing different knots and methods of fastening. There are many
specimens of cord showing all manners of twisting, braiding, and
knotting.

Nos. 139545 to 139550 are two human vertebrae found closely asso-
ciated with the following ornaments: Small shells strung together as
beads; eight pins—spines of cactus; one piece of buckskin, tied; two
sticks, bound; string of corded, plaited, and bound pendants of human
hair, cylindrical, one-fourth inch diameter and three fourths inch long.

The graves were found to contain an entire paraphernalia. Two
arrow flakers with points of bone set in handles ef wood; four wooden
pieces from 4 to 9 inches long, one-eighth to three eighths in diameter,
each bound with twine about the body, apparently for a handle, but
leaving the sharp point bare; one mush stick; bone points; four shells—
(Cardium elatum, Sby., and one Pecten (Vola) dentata, Sby., possibly
used as drinking cups; two stone tubes, drilled lengthwise, one 114
inches long and one 34, 14 to 1§ in diameter.

There was one bow, in two pieces; an arrow of cane or reed, 2 feet 10
inches long, three-eighths of an inch in diameter, with a fish spine for
a point 4 inches long. There were two shafts or darts, both with long,
sharp points 15 and 20 inches long, one-fourth of an inch in diameter.

Two whistles of hollow reed 9 inches long, five-eighths of an ineh in
diameter.

A curious implement, use unknown, was a piece of flat wood 94
inches long, 2 inches wide, and one-eighth or one-fourth thick. One
end was a concave with a hole below. About 24 inches from each end
was a Single row of very small shells, Olivella biplicata Sby., say one-
eighth inch, set like marquetry across the flat side and fastened with
cement or bitumen.

We have six skulls adult and the fragments of one or more infants.

No. 139551 is one shell ornament, 1¢ inches in diameter; perforated
as for suspension.

No. 139552, same, oval, 2 by 13 inches.

No. 139553, one of the same, 14 inches in diameter. This specimen
is broken in the middle, cracked in two, and has been repaired by four
holes drilled in it in pairs, each two opposite, one of which contains
the original mending. When the hole of suspension in this specimen
was broken out at the edge the owner had HOVENSEL, the specimen and
drilled another hole.

These three ornaments have the appearance of having been used as
ear pendants. Theshell portion is nearly flat and retains its iridescense.
These pieces of shell belong to the species Haliotis splendens Rve.

A collection of objects belonging to prehistoric man, three hundred
and twenty-four in number, were received (accession 19,249) from Mr.
James F. Johnson, Holywood, County Down, Ireland. Mr. Johnson in
his communication gives an elaborate description of their discovery,
with their position, locality, and association. A new road was in course
of construction during August, 1885, on the town land of Ballymenoch,
in his neighborhood, County Down, Ireland. He supervised the work.
As the men cut through a mound of sand a cave 20 feet long by 3 feet
wide and about 3 feet high was exposed which led to an oval chamber
14 by 74 by 6 feet high. At its farther end, and to the right, another
passage leads to a second chamber 9 by 6 by 6 feet high. (Fig. 1.)

It was evidently an ancient habitation of man. It was constructed of

spear and lance heads (136881), fourteen arrow or lance heads (136880),
pounding or crushing stones (136888-136897), one shell necklet, and a
few other relics.

About 20 feet from the cavern a cutting 9 feet in depth was com-
menced through what appeared to have been an ancient pond, the de-
posit being fine mud washed from the hills. All through this deposit
were found weapons and tools, all of a rude type, made from the local
rock (Lower Silurian), and a few arrow-tips of flint (nodules of which
were found from time to time in the bowlder clay). In two places were
ancient remains of fire. The pond was about 110 by 90 feet with 9 feet
only of depth cut through.

From this place he obtained what he names rude hammer-stones
(136887-136889), polishing stones (136890-136896), pounding or crushing
stones (136878, 136903-136907), rude axes more or less notched (136882,
136898-136899, 136877), rude lance, spear, and arrow heads (136880-
136881. In October and November, 1885, he excavated part of a large
cavern at Craigavard, County Down. This he believes to be one of
the largest artificial caverns in the north of Ireland which has served
as a habitation of the prehistoric man. . He believes it to comprise no
less than twelve separate chambers. Among the common people this
was called the Smugglers’ Cave, on account of its supposed use by peo-
ple pursuing that branch of business. He found in this cave whistles,
needles, awls, bodkins, all made of bone, and over two hundred teeth
(136880, 136881), and a quantity of splintered animal bones (136884).
In chamber number 4 he came, at a depth of 2 feet, to the ancient floor,
which consisted of river gravels thrown over the bowlder clay. On this
floor he found a few rude implements of the same type as from Bally-
menoch.

He made excavations in the raised beaches of the neighborhood, and
found many implements which he considers modern compared with
those from the two caves mentioned. The implements from the caves
are made, as he says, from the Lower Silurian and other rocks, while
those from the raised beaches are of flint. The cave implements are
found at high elevations, but never in raised beach gravel. This he
thinks to be a proof of the higher antiquity of these implements. He
sends implements from the raised beaches—of flint, thirteen specimens
rudely chipped unpolished celts (136910); one hundred and six speci-
mens rude spear, lance, or arrow heads (136911, 136912), forty-six spec-
mens; (136913), seventeen specimens; (136914), fourteen specimens.
He also sends scrapers (136915), twenty-one specimens, eight of which

132 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The most important consideration in regard to the collection in the
department of Prehistoric Anthropology is that it is much crowded.
The number of objects in the collection intended for exhibition amounts
to 108,705. These are displayed in cases according to the following
list :

Itis apparent from this statement that the cases now placed in the hall
can not be put closer together, nor under the arrangement can their
number be augmented. A proper display of the objects seems to re-
quire additional room. This declaration is not made as a complaint,
but for the purpose of putting upon record the necessity for increased
space, which may be considered when the opportunity arrives. <A sug-
gestion how the present situation may be ameliorated will be made
farther on, but no permanent relief can be afforded without an enlarge-
ment of space.

Some of the great museums in Europe are comprised exclusively of
the objects which pertain to this department. The Musée of St. Ger-
main is exclusively prehistoric, yet it alone occupies the palace of St.
Germain, an immense structure with moat and portcullis, built by Henry
IV. The palace is now being restored throughout and made fire-proof.
Its sole intended use is for this prehistoric museum. Each story is de-
voted to one prehistoric age. The same general statement is true of
the great prehistoric museum at Copenhagen. It occupies the eight
large halls of the Prince’s Palace, and fills one hundred and eighty-seven_
DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 133
cases. So, also, is it largely true of the prehistoric museums of Stock-
holm, of Christiania, Edinburgh, Dublin, Lyons, Toulouse, Nantes,
Quimper, Vannes, Rennes, of the principal towns of Switzerland, of
Berlin, of Rome, and of many towns in Italy.

In all these and many other places which might be easily named, the
collection of prehistoric anthropology forms an entire museum of itself,
with a full corps of officers and employés. Yet the necessities, as well
as the opportunities, for a prehistoric museum are greater in the United
States than in any of the countries I have mentioned. Our territory is
wider, the field of research is newer, and the prehistoric age of our
country is brought so near to us that our opportunities are, as I have
said. superior.

There has been transferred to this department twenty-six plaster or
papier-maché models of ancient Zuni and Moqui cities, villages, and
monuments, from Arizona and New Mexico.*

Some of these have been placed upon the floor in the center of the
hall, where they occupy 1,750 square feet of space, nearly one-fifth of
the available floor space in the hall. Others, upright models of cliff
dwellings, caverns, etc., are placed upon the tops of the high wall
cases, so far distant and so high as to be out of the range of vision,
which detracts greatly from, if it does not destroy, their interest on the
part of the public.

* They were made originally by the U. S. Geological Survey and by the Bureau
of Ethnology. A list of them is here given:

List of Moqui and Zuni villages and monuments, from Arizona, New Mexico, and Colo-
rado, models of which have been placed on exhibition in my hall.

134 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

There are also placed upon the tops of the wall cases other models,
those of prehistoric mounds and earthworks belonging to the United
States.*

They are made to represent the surface of the earth in and about the
respective monuments. Of course the surface they are intended to
represent is horizontal, flat, and it is a solecism to place them perpen-
dicular. The objection mentioned with regard to the other models, as
to their being so high as not to be seen, applies equally to these.

There is another reason for re-arrangement, which applies with
greater force to some of these mounds. The Etowah Mound, at Carters-
ville, Georgia, has, for example, been excavated and surveyed by the
Bureau of Ethnology. The objects found within that mound are dis-
played in one of the upright cases, while the model of the mound itself
is placed, along with many other models, in a perpendicular position on
the top of one of the wall cases. There is thus no relation between the
mound and the objects found therein, nor is there any opportunity for
the study and comparison of the two in their respective relations.

The prehistoric collections from Central and South America are dis-
played in scattered cases, separated according to the requirements of
space, with the adjoining cases containing North American antiquities,
and nothing to distinguish them except perhaps the labels. This dis-
play is not effective and detracts largely from the benefit. Many per-
sons fail to see or recognize them as representing a civilization different
from that of the stone hatchets and arrow heads, and the Indian pipes,
in contiguous cases.

The collection of prehistoric objects from Central America is of great
value and interest. Itis the largest museum collection in this country,
and is exceeded only by that of one private gentleman. It has scarcely
received the consideration due to its merits. It should be re-arranged,
should be assembled in one locality instead of being scattered as at
present, and should have a descriptive catalogue, with maps and illus-
trations worthy of the merit and rarity of its objects. a

In this connection I submit a list of the idols and images and other
antiquities, which have lately been transferred to this hall, coming also —
from Central America, and which should be included in the catalogue:

The arrangement of this department of the Museum has been princi-
pally according to the implement or object. Arrow and spear points
have been arranged in separate cases, divided according to their various
forms. Grooved axes have been placed together, polished stone hatchets
together, mortars, pestles, hammers, pitted stones, etc., have been gener-
ally placed together without regard to locality from which they came,
the era or epoch to which they belonged, or their period of civilization.
The exhibits received from the Bureau of Ethnology have been displayed
in the upright cases, and there each find has been placed by itself, and,
so far as possible, separated from all other finds. But in this arrange-
- ment no attempt has been made to preserve the unity of neighborhoods
in respect of locality. The contents of mounds from Maine and Geor-
gia may be found together in one case, while the collections from neigh-
boring mounds in either State, it may be at different times and of
different accessions, may be found in other parts of the hall associated
with the contents of mounds from other and different parts of the
United States.

It is highly proper that it should be so changed as that contiguous
objects should be displayed together. Things that belong together
should be displayed together. I have recognized the necessity for this
work, but have been loth to commence it, for it would require the in-
spection and handling of every object in the Museum, and this would

mean an examination as to the locality from which it came, the people

to whom it belonged, and a consideration of and decision upon the his-
tory and purpose of each. This can not be done by mechanics or labor-
ers, but would require the continual labor and attention of Mr. Upham
or myself, or perhaps both, and would be a labor of such extent and
duration that I am loth to attack it. My little experience in a like at-
tempt in preparing the exhibit for the Cincinnati Exposition confirms
me in this feeling. I suppose the work must be done, but ‘upon the
bank I shivering stand, yet fear to launch away.”

This arrangement of the objects in the Museum, geographically or -
136 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

by locality, was contemplated by Dr. Rau. His report for the year _
ending June 30, 1886, contains the following paragraph:

The collections in question, of course, vary much in extent; they sometimes only
fill a tray, but occasionally occupy several shelves of an upright case. Ultimately,
when anything like completeness has been reached, they will be arranged geographic-
ally. ,

In the proposed geographic arrangement of the objects in the
Museum the entire abrogation of the arrangement according to struct-
ural function is not contemplated. It is intended that a series of the
respective objects, sufficient to show their normal peculiarities, will be
arranged and preserved.

It is suggested that the great hall might to advantage be divided
into fictive apartments by means of screens, or better, by wall cases,
for the display of collections from separate countries like Central and
South America, Mexico, etc., or of the Zuni or Moqui Pueblo, or of other
epochs or monuments like the mounds, the shell-heaps, the caverns,
etc. The Museum would be a gainer of space thereby.

The present state of the collection is shown by the following table:

The principal research in which I have been engaged during the
past year has been for the evidences of the existence of man during
the paleolithic period of the stone age on the continent of North Amer-
ica; in other words, an inquiry as to whether there had been a paleo-
lithic period in America or whether there were to be found evidences
of the existence of a civilization in America which corresponded with
that of the paleolithic period in Europe. The results of this inquiry
are given in full in a subsequent portion of this volume. (See section
111.) Another of equal interest, but not so extensive, has been in re-
lation to the ancient matting from Petit Anse, also described in a
separate paper.

Much more might have been done but for the absorbing character of
the routine work in the department, which it may not be uninteresting
to describe in this connection.

_ That for a single day will serve as a type. The curator and all em-
ployés arrive at 9 o’clock (the laborers have already aired, swept, and
DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 137

dusted the exhibition hall and offices). The mail is opened, letters
read and briefed; those pertaining to announcements of accessions are
sent to the registrar; requests for information, etc., are answered;
boxes opened, specimens received are unpacked, separated, arranged,
classified, and all entered in the catalogue. They are then sent out to
be numbered with the catalogue number, which is placed upon every
specimen with paint of suitable color. The name of the donor and the
locality must also appear. They are then, in trays, placed in a special
case to be assorted and assigned to their respective places by the
curator. There is enough work of this numbering to keep a skilled
laborer continually employed. For example, the number of specimens
received during the past year was 6,972. The present catalogue num-
ber (139916) consists of six figures. The locality and name of donor
trebles the labor of marking, making the average of eighteen to twenty-
four figures and letters to be painted on each specimen, or a total of
125,000 to 175,000 figures or letters. This requires an average of two
painted figures or letters per minute, to be made without stop or break,
during the working hours of the entire year. The McGlashan collec-
tion from Georgia, comprising twenty thousand and more specimens,
had been received before my appointment as curator. Only a partial
attempt had been made to number them.

The work of the office on Circular 36 began about the middle of Jan-
uary, but from the middle of February the answers and specimens re-
ceived from correspondents were, together with their replies and ex-
changes, sufficient to occupy our entire force. The assorting of the
specimens and dividing them into their respective epochs of the
~ paleolithic period was a slow work, requiring care and deliberation.
Any intervals of time were occupied in the preparation and writing of
the descriptive catalogue of the archeological collection. The classifi-
cation of the paleolithic implements had progressed as far on the list as
the State of Ohio on the 31st day of May. On the 1st day of June Il
was notified to immediately commence the preparation of an exhibit
from the department of Prehistoric Anthropology for display at the
Cincinnati Centennial Exposition. That work required the services. of
all available force in the office during the balance of the fiscal year
and somewhat into the present.

Prior to March 23, 1888, no attempt was made in the office to keep a
record of the correspondence, requests for information, notes of refer-
ence from other departments, and their answers, ete. During the
months of January and February, and up to the 22d of March, there
had been sent between five and six hundred circulars. In March there
were written and sent, 32 circulars and 13 letters; in April, 20 letters;
in May, 45 letters; and in June, 63 circulars and 24 letters; making a
total of 202.

My experience has gradually demonstrated, to my own satisfaction at
least, that the daily routine business of the office is sufficient to fully
138 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

occupy my time during working hours if I devote myself to the per-
formance of its details. This work is important and should not be neg-
lected. I might add, in this connection, that I find my duties in the
office sufficient to require the attention and constant labor of three per-
sons instead of one, all of which now devolves on me. First, the daily
routine, just adverted to; second, the re-arrangement of the specimens
in the Museum; and third, the making of a catalogue and other scien-
tific and literary labor. The last is, in my judgment, the most impor-
tant and will be pressed forward with as much rapidity as the daily
routine will permit.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS IN THE U.S, NATIONAL
MUSEUM, 1888.

By FREDERICK W. TRUE, Curator.

In my last report I stated that the chief features of the year’s work
were the re-arrangement of almost the entire exhibition series in new
and specially adapted cases, and the replacement of a portion of the
defective material in the study series by the purchase of fresh speci-
mens. During tie past year the work has progressed along the same
lines, but some special tasks were also undertaken, the foremost of
which was the preparation of a large series of specimens for exhibition
in the Ohio Valley Centennial Exposition in Cincinnati.

The plan of representing the more important mammals of North
America by groups of specimens accompanied by accessories indicative
of the habits and natural surroundings of the species, which had been
for some time under consideration, was carried into execution by Mr.
Hornaday, chief taxidermist. Five groups have been placed in the ex-
hibition hall, one of which, a group of bisons, is one of the largest and
most carefully executed works of its kind to be found in any museum.

More valuable material has been acquired by purchase and exchange
and less by donations than in previous years. Some interesting speci-
mens were received from two collectors sent out by the Smithsonian
Institution, but, with one or two exceptions, very little material has
been received from the various branches of the Government service.

No descriptions of new species of North American mammals have been
published during the year, though announcements of the discovery of
several have been made to some of the scientific societies.

Among the important accessions of the year the foremost, perhaps,
was the series of skins of small mammals selected from several collec-
tions of small mammals made by Mr. F. A. Stephens in the San Fran-
cisco Mountains, Arizona, and the San Bernardino Mountains, Califor-
nia. These included specimens of Spermophilus tereticaudus, Dipodomys
deserti, Thomomys talpoides perpallidus, and other species of rodents not
previously well represented in the collection. Two specimens of an
undescribed race of Haplodon major from Point Reyes, Cal., were pur-
chased from Mr. C. K. Worthen. A fine skin of an unusually large

139
140 "REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

male moose was obtained from Mr. A. Bb, Douglas, of Eustis, Me.,
through Dr. C. H. Merriam. It is intended that this specimen shall form
the chief figure ina group. Dr. J.C. Merrill, U. S. Army, forwarded
from Fort Klamath, Oregon, a considerable collection of small mammals,
in addition to those sent last year. During his last tour through the
Western Territories, Mr. Hornaday obtained, among other specimens, a
very fine pair of wapiti antlers in the ‘‘ velvet.” Not less interesting
and valuable were two specimens of the Striped Dolphin, Lagenorhynchus
acutus, which were presented by the U.S. Fish Commission. They were
obtained by the officers of the Commission’s schooner Grampus south
of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. A fine Mountain Goat’s skin was pur-
chased from Mr. KE. C. Babcock.

The only important collection from Central America was the consid-
erable one made by Mr. Charles H. Townsend in the vicinity of the
Segovia River, Honduras. This included a valuable series of specimens
of an undescribed deer, which has simple antlers like the species of the
subgenus Coassus, but which nevertheless appears to belong to the sub-
genus Cariacus. Prof. Alfredo Duges presented a specimen of the rare
meadow mouse, Arvicola quasiater, from the Valley of Mexico.

The most important Old World mammals obtained during the past
year were those received from Prof. H. A. Ward in exchange for skins
of North American species. The collection included several lemurs,
cats, civets, Squirrels, and kangaroos, allof which were of species new to
the Museum series. The Zoological Society of Philadelphia, through
Mr. A. E. Brown, presented a fine male harnessed antelope (Tragelaphus
scriptus), an Indian squirrel (Sciurus bicolor), and a Moor monkey (Semno-
pithecus maurus). Mr. Valdemar Knudsen presented two additional
Specimens of the bat found in the Sandwich Islands. It is a species
of Atalapha, which is apparently distinct from those hitherto described.
Mr. F. A. Lucas presented a skull of Burchell’s zebra. A skull and
skeleton of the Zipbioid whale known as Ziphius grebnitzkii were re-
ceived from Mr. N. Grebnitzky, who obtained them from Bering Island.

In my last report I stated that new cases for almost the entire ex-
hibition series were received at the end of the fiscal year. The month
of July, 1887, was spent in planning the interior fittings for these cases
and in re-arranging the collection. The improvement in the appearance
of the collection resulting from this work has been much commented
upon by visitors.

The new wings added to the large wall-cases were fitted with shelves
and bases, and the one intended for tbe seals was filled with specimens.
The east wing, intended for the large ruminants, has not been arranged.
Before the plans had been finished, the majority of the specimens were
in requisition for display in the Cincinnati Exposition, and no perma-
nent installment could be made.

The cast of the Humpback whale, which had previously rested upon
iron standards at the south end of the exhibition hall, was suspended
DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS. ; 141

from the roof. By this change a considerable floor-space was made
available for other purposes.

By far the most important additions to the exhibition series were the _
groups already alluded to. Five of these works, representing the bison,
prairie wolf or coyote, opossum, prong-horn antelope, and prairie-dog,
have been placed in the hall. The bison group occupies a case about

_17 feet long, 123 feet wide, and 9 feet high. All the groups were de-
signed by Mr. W. T. Hornaday and were executed by himself, assisted
by Messrs.J. Palmer, A. H. Forney, and William Palmer. Great pains
were taken to make the groups true to nature, and in the case of the
bison, coyote, and antelope, the turf, bushes, and other accessories were
brought from Montana with the specimens themselves. The work has
been very carefully done, special attention having been given to matters
of detail. Several new groups are in preparation.

In addition to these five groups, which together include twenty-seven
specimens, the taxidermists have mounted about thirty other mammals.
A few of these were still without stands at the end of the year or could
not be completely finished for lack of materials, and the remainder
were sent to the Cincinnati Exposition. The usual list will therefore
be held over for next year’s report, when the work done for the Cincin-
nati Exposition will be reported npon in full.

In addition to the regular routine work connected with the identifica-
tion and cataloguing of new specimens, correspondence, the preparation
of labels, etc., several special tasks were undertaken. The entire col-
lection of skulls was furnished with uniform labels, and the skins of the
monkeys and carnivores also received fresh labels, replacing the old
ones, many of which were becoming illegible. It should be remarked
here that the original labels received with the specimens are never
removed unless, aS sometimes happens, they are of absurdly large
size.

The skins which had accumulated in the taxidermists’ tanks, amount-
ing to over three hundred, were divided into two lots, preparatory to
being taken in hand by the taxidermists, some being assigned to the ex-
hibition series and others to the study series. A considerable number
of large skins belonging to the latter series were received from the
taxidermists during the year, and were temporarily stored in the lower
part of some of the exhibition cases.

The alcoholic collection has been temporarily placed on shelves in
the south entrance of the Museum. The jars have been repeatedly ex-
amined, and the collection is in a fair state of preservation.

The boxes containing the skins of ruminants and other large mam-
mals are stored in the south entrance and are practically inaccessible
for want of space.

A new card-catalogue of the exhibition series has been formed by
pasteing copies of the printed labels on standard cards. The other card-
142 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

catalogues are in the same condition as when last reported upon, except
that the new accessions have been entered upon them.

A series of antlers of North American deer was prepared for and sent
to the Minneapolis Exposition.

A general bibliography of works upon the Mammalia, commenced
some time ago, now comprises about fifteen thousand titles. All the
titles cited in the Zoological Record, the first and second parts of Carus
and Knglemann’s Bibliotheca, the Zoologischer Anzeiger, and Fried-
lander’s catalogues are inciuded, as well as references to the brief but
often valuable notes to be found in the American Sportsman, Forest and
Stream, and other journals of like character. ‘This is, of course, only
a beginning, but I have already found the catalogue of much service
in connection with the work of the department.

As a foundation for the work of representing graphically the geo-
graphical distribution of our North American mammals, copies have
been made of all the available faunal lists, about sixty-seven in num-
ber, which have appeared from time to time in various works on the
Nearctic fauna.

The curator obtained some additional information regarding the ty pe-
specimens of different species of dolphins during a short journey in
Europe in the early part of the year, and has added to his review of
the family a synopsis and materials for figures of all the species. The
paper has not yet been published. He also prepared descriptions of
two new rodents from Padre Island, Texas, and of the Sandwich Island
bat, some notes on Vesperugo hesperus (Allen), and a review of the
changes in the catalogue of North American mammals in the last ten
vears. None of these papers have been published during the year.
The curator and Mr. EK. W. Nelson have published a report upon the
mammals obtained by Mr. Nelson in Alaska, 1877-81.

The following figures show the number of specimens in the different
series on June 30, 1887, and June 30, 1888, respectively.

It will be noticed that the exhibition series is smaller than at the
close of the previous year. This is due to the fact that when the new
exhibition cases were received a large number of old mounted skins,
which were in amore or less dilapidated condition, were withdrawn
from exhibition and placed among the duplicates. This replacement
of defective specimens by good ones must go on gradually for several
years, until the collection is entirely renovated. The number of speci-
mens actually added during the year was thirty-two.
DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS. 143

Among the accessions were about sixty species and subspecies not
previously represented in the collection.

The number of skins and specimens in alcohol added and distributed
during the year was as follows:

Number of specimens added, 247; number of specimens distributed, 69.

Four specimens only were received on deposit.

The first entry for the year in the catalogue of skins and alcoholics
was No. 15900; the last, on June 27, 1888, was No. 16236.

The present condition of the collection as regards preservation is, on
the whole, satisfactory. The study series of skins, however, is still in
cases which are not dust-proof. To devise effective and manageable
appliances is a matter of considerable difficulty owing to the great
disparity in size among the skins and the cramped condition of the
laboratory. Several plans are under consideration, however, and the
curator hopes to be in a position to recommend the adoption of some
one of them in the immediate future.

The skins of large mammals which have accumulated during the
past twenty-five years, being at present, as already stated, stored in
large boxes arranged in tiers in the south entrance of the Museum
building, are almost inaccessible for study. Better provisions for them
and for the large skins recently received from the taxidermists are
much to be desired. A partial reconstruction of the storage cases now
in the laboratory and the addition of one new case would meet the pres-
ent requirements.

The mammals in alcohol deteriorate in spite of our best efforts to
preserve them. The spirits dissolve out the pigment of the hair, caus-
ing it in most cases to assume a pale brown color. Such specimens
give a false notion of the real colors of the species, and are useful to
students of systematic zoology only for measurements. The curator
is not satisfied, therefore, that it is profitable to maintain so large
an alcoholic collection and has seriously considered the advisability of
converting a portion of the more recently-acquired specimens into dry
skins. Many gaps in the series of skins could thus be filled, and there
would still be an abundance of material for anatomical investigation.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS IN THE U.S, NATIONAL
MUSEUM, 1888.

By Rosert Ripa@way, Curator.

The year’s work has consisted, as heretofore, largely of routine work, |
such as the receiving, unpacking, cataloguing, labeling, and installa-
tion of collections, making of exchanges, correspondence, etc. In addi-
tion to the large amount of work done under these separate headings,
nearly the entire exhibition collection has been re-arranged, the cases
being fitted with patent adjustable shelving and repainted. This im-
portant work is still going on, and progresses as rapidly as the cases
can be put in proper shape.

During the last two months of the year the time and work of the de-
partment was devoted exclusively to the preparation, cataloguing,
labeling, and packing of the collections for the Centennial Exposition
in Cincinnati, Ohio. During this time all the energies of the curator
and his assistants were directed toward making the ornithological ex-
hibit as creditable to the Museum as possible, and I am glad to state
that these efforts were crowned with complete success. The bird ex-
hibit embraced: (1) Five hundred and thirty finely mounted birds rep-
resenting the characteristic types of all the zoogeographical regions of
the earth, arranged in four double mahogany cases, each specimen pro-
vided with a printed label giving the vernacular and systematic names
as well as the geographical distribution of the species; (2) a group of
mounted birds representing such species as play a conspicuous réle in
literature, with the names by which they are known in works of poetry,
and a quotation of some characteristic poem relating to the species
_ printed on the labels; (3) twelve artistic groups of North American
water birds, in two mahogany cases, mounted with surroundings indi-
cating their natural habitat ; (4) a collection of eggs and casts of eggs
ranging from the enormously large egg of the extinct Epyornis or Giant
Ostrich to the tiny egg of the Humming-bird, with explanatory labels;

(5) a series of original water-color paintings, by the curator, representing
extremely rare North American birds, either extinct or on the verge of
extinction; (6) a series of fac-simile reproductions of plates of Audubon’s
great work on the Birds of North America, appropriately framed and
labeled. As a special feature of the exhibit illustrating the geographical

distribution, a series of colored maps may be mentioned, each repre-
senting one of the zoogeographical regions oi the earth.

during the cruise of the Fish Commission schooner Grampus, Capt. J. W. Collins, by
Messrs. William Palmer and Frederic A. Lucas, of the National Museum. The collec-
tion is a valuable one, not only for the species collected, but also for the excellence
of their preparation. It contains many interesting species and plumages, especially
those of young birds. A pair ofthe Newfoundland Ptarmigan (Lagopus welchi) recently
described, and hitherto unrepresented in the Museum collection, deserve special men-
tion. :

U.S. Fish Commission, through Vinal N. Edwards, Wood’s Holl, Massachusetts:

Zoological Society of Philadelphia, through Mr. Arthur E. Brown: A Lady Amherst
Pheasant, an Australian Parrot (Psephotus xanthorrhous), and a Demoiselle Crane, all
in the flesh. Also a specimen Javan Adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus) in the flesh. All
form valuable and interesting additions to the exhibition series. (Gift.)

Owing to the inadequate number of cases and the unsuitable con-
struction of those available, it has not been possible to make rapid
progress with the systematic re-arrangement of the exhibition series; a
satisfactory beginning has, however, been-made, and the large amount
of necessary work that has been done in the way of remodeling cases
insures more rapid advancement of the work during the present year.

The study series has been steadily improved in arrangement, as
opportunity afforded, and as the necessary cases and drawers became
available.

The complicated preparations necessary for the orderly arrangement
and systematic classification of such extensive and bulky collections as
those belonging to the bird department having nearly been completed,
it is safe to say that the work will henceforth progress rapidly, provided
the required additional cases are forthcoming as they may be needed.

The extent of general routine work may be briefly stated as follows:

In addition to the above, many hundred labels were written and proof
corrected.

Owing to the vast amount of labor required by matters mentioned
under the first and third sections of this report, very little time has
' been available for special research, the principal part of what was ac-
complished by the curator being necessarily done out of office hours.
It is much to be regretted that no more time can be given to work
of this kind, of the greatest importance to ornithological science as well
as to the collection, whose value is increased as its component parts or
sections become the basis of original monographic work; and no collec-
tion of American birds contains a greater quantity of material for such
original research, urgently required for the advancement of the science,
than that of the bird department of the National Museum. So much
has the function of the curator of this department become that of a
purely administrative head, that his occupation consists almost entirely
in the performance of numberless complex routine duties connected
with the receipting for, unpacking, cataloguing, labeling, installment,

150 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

and reporting upon collections or specimens received, correspondence,
exchanges, arrangement of the exhibition series, ete., that practically
he is removed from the rank of active ornithologists. By unusual
effort, however, the curator has managed to prepare a review of the
Mexican and Central American members of the following families of
birds: Thrushes, Mocking Thrushes, Warblers, Titinice, Creepers, and
Dippers; determined a collection of birds from the Lower Amazon, con-
taining thirteen new species and one new genus, and a large collec-
tion from islands in the Caribbean Sea and the coast of Honduras;
also containing novelties, a monograph of the genus Dendrocincla, and
another of the interesting and greatly confused genus of Passerine
Parrots (Psittacula), in each of which is deseribed several previously
unknown species.

The assistant curator, Mr. Leonhard Stejneger, has continued his
studies of the splendid collection of Japanese birds belonging to the
National Museum. During the year several large private collections
from the same country have been received for examination, upon which
extensive reports are still in progress of preparation. In connection
with these studies he investigated several groups of European birds,
with the result of clearing up several doubtful points. He has also re-
ported upon two collections of birds from the Hawaiian Islands received
during the year.

The present condition of the collection, so far as the preservation of
the specimens is concerned, could not possibly be better. As to con-
venience of arrangement. much improvement is to be desired; but this
will be possible only when at least twice the amount of room is pro-
vided for its accommodation.

It has not been practicable to make an actual count of the specimens in
the bird collection, but their number is very nearly as given in the LOL
lowing careful estimate :

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF BIRDS’ EGGS IN THE U. S. NATIONAL
MUSEUM, 1888.

By Capt. CHarLes E. BenpirE, U.S. A., Honorary Curator.

The following important additions have been made to the collection
of birds’ eggs during the year:

From Lieut. H. C. Benson, Fourth Cavalry, U.S. Army, Fort Hua-
chuca, Arizona, were received 6 species, 14 specimens. Some of the rarer
amongst these are as follows: Columba fasciata (2 specimens); Calli-
pepla squamata (3 specimens); Vireo huttoni stephensi with nest (3 spec-
imens); Psaltriparus plumbeus (2 nests) are new to the collection. From
Dr. J.C. Merrill, assistant surgeon U.S. Army, Fort Klamath, Oregon,
came 11 species, 77 specimens. Among them were 4 sets, 22 specimens,
of Parus gambell. From Dr. A. K. Fisher, Department of Agriculture,
were received 1 set of 2 eggs of Buteo latissimus. From T. Stephens,
San Bernardino, California, were purchased 1 set of 4 eggs and nest of
Polioptila californica; new to the collection. Mr. C. W. Richmond,
Washington, District of Columbia, gave a cellection of 84 species, 950
specimens, mostly from the District of Columbia. From Denis Gale,
Goldhill, Bowlder County, Colorado, was received a fine collection, in-
cluding Bubo virginianus subarcticus (2 specimens), and Carpodacus cas-
simi (4 specimens). Dr. William C. Avery, Greensborough, Alabama,
presented 2 nests and a set of 3 eggs of Dendroica vigorst; 4 sets, 15
specimens, and 3 nests of Peucca estivalis bachmant; new to the col-
lection. Col. N. G. Goss, Topeka, Kansas, contributed 1 egg of Sula
gossi and 2 eggs of Sula brewsteri; both species new to the collection.
Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, gave
nests and 4 eggs of Geothlypis philadelphia. Herbert Brown, Tucson,
Arizona, presented four specimens of Piranga rubra coopert; 2 nests
and 8 specimens of Harporhynchusbenderei; and 1 nest of Harporhynchus
palmeri, and others. The nests are new to the collection.

One hundred and four nests have been received during the yéar.

The character of the routine work has consisted in taking the meas-
urements, numbering, classifying, and re-arranging 1778 specimens ;
relabeling and arranging part of the reserve series of eggs after the
*¢ American Ornithological Union” check-list, and repacking and label-
ing a large duplicate series of nests.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS IN
THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888,

By H. C. Yarrow, M. D., Honorary Curator.

Owing to the fact that repairs were made to the west basement of the
Smithsonian building in which is situated the room set apart for tlie
curator of the Department of Reptiles and Batrachians, it was found
somewhat difficult to attend properly and promptly te the ordinary
routine work of the department; still this has been performed as expe-
ditiously as was possible under the circumstances. It was found nec-
essary to transfer the entire “reserve series” of reptiles to storage
rooms provided for the purpose, and this transfer was so carefully done
that not a single specimen was injured.

Since the return of the collection to the room where it belongs, it has
been carefully gone over, bottles relabeled if necessary, filled with fresh
aicohol, and put in complete systematic order for reference or study.

During the repairs the office of the curator has been twice moved,
comfortable quarters having been assigned him.

Much eredit is due my assistant, Mr. EH. S. Rheem, for the careful
manner in which he has performed his duties.

Among the more important contributors during the year, are Dr.
J. C. Merrill, Fort Klamath, Oregon; Charles S. Beachler, Indiana;
Lieut. J. F. Moser, U. S. Navy; H. D. Hood, Florida; James Bell,

Austin, Texas; John S. Webb, Stanley County, North Carolina; Charles
B. Cory, Boston, Massachusetts. The collection made by the latter
was sent to Professor Cope, of Philadelphia.

In addition to the usual routine work, the Reptile Department was
moved back into its old quarters in the west basement of the Smith-
sonian building; all the alcoholic specimens contained in bottles, proba-
bly five thousand, were carefully cleaned and refilled, when necessary,
with fresh alcohol; the “reserve series” has to a great extent been
relabeled, and arranged systematically in the cases prepared for it; a
number of new specimens have also been added. The ‘ reserve series ”
of Testudinata has been properly attended to and arranged in cases,
and the ‘“‘ duplicate” reptiles, contained in tanks, were overhauled, and
are all in excellent condition.

All this extra work necessitated the services of a laborer, who was
detailed on requisition, from time to time. It is to be hoped that one
will be detailed permanently in this department, as the great increase
in work is such that one is greatly needed.

The following special researches have been carried on:

Prof. E. D. Cope, of Philadelphia, has continued his studies upon the
batrachia, and is now engaged upon the reptiles proper.

The curator has investigated the subject of crotalus venom, its action
upon animals, and a number of experiments were tried with so-called
‘Santidotes” to the venom. A popular account of the experiments, by
permission of the Assistant Secretary, was published in “ Forest and
Stream,” New York, May and June, 1888. It is intended to continue
these experiments during the fall and winter.

The present state of the collection is shown in the following state-
ment:

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FISHES IN THE U.S, NATIONAL
MUSEUM, 1888.

By Dr. TARLETON H. BEAN, Honorary Curator.

Early in the year the curator was ordered by the Commissioner of
Fisheries to investigate and report upon the fishes of Great Egg Har-
bor Bay, New Jersey, and accordingly left Washington early in July
(1887) for that purpose. The work was done under the auspices of the
_ U.S. Fish Commission, and the report upon the same made to the Com-
missioner. After the eurator’s return to Washington, considerable time
was consumed in the preparation of a paper for publication upon the
results of this expedition.

An accumulation of correspondence pertaining to this department
was taken up and disposed of. During the period from October (1887) to
Apri) (1888) many new forms were described, chiefly of deep-sea fishes.
These descriptions have not been published as yet. The descriptions
of inland species have, as a rule, however, been promptly printed in the
_ Proceedings.

The collections of fishes in the main hall of the Smithsonian were re-
moved to the basement, and those belonging in the fish hall proper were
returned to their places after the fire-proofing had been completed.
The removal of collections, especially alcoholics, caused much annoy-
ance and work; labels were destroyed, alcohol spilled, and jars some-
times broken, involving much loss of time and often a pretty general
‘re-arrangement of the collections. The contents of my office were

moved back into the old quarters from the Museum. ;

I was ordered to join the Grampus in her southern mackerel fishery
investigations, which occupied my time from May 10 to June 15, 1888,
Immediately after my return I began to arrange materials for a report
on this cruise, based on the specimens which were transferred to the
National Museum.

The first number in the register for the year is 39,119, and the last
39,568.

About 1,350 specimens have been entered in the catalogue during
the year. These specimens have for the most part been placed in bot-
tles, after having been identified and reported upon, labeled and put
in their proper places.

155
156 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The following collections have been studied and administered upon:

A specimen of Haplochiton zebra, new to our collection, was sent by
Lieut. W. M. Wood, from Puerto Bueno. Numerous collections made
in South America, by W. E. Safford and Senor Don José Arechavaleta,
were received and cared for. A small collection of fishes made in
Honduras, Central America, by Mr. C. H. Townsend, has been exam-
ined and reported upon. Collections of fishes made in Newfoundland
and vicinity by the U.S. Fish Commission, schooner Grampus, have
been identified; also numerous collections made by the steamer Alba-
tross off the east coast of the United States have been catalogued and
preserved.

Collections have been received from nearly every State anil Territory
in the Union.

Numerous types of new species have been obtained, descriptions of
which have been published in the Proceedings of the Museum. Numer-
ous applications for loans of material for study have been received and
attended to.

The present state of the collection is fairly satisfactory.

The entire collection in jars has been overhauled during the year,
alcoho! supplied where needed, and many new labels placed upon the
bottles. New shelving has been furnished, and the places overcrowded
have been relieved to some extent. Numerous important additions to
the collection have been received; seventeen types of new fishes have
been added, besides several rare and little-known forms.

The collection is much improved in condition and arrangement since
one year ago.

No duplicates have been distributed except two small lots. There is
much material here that could be distributed to museums throughout
this and other countries, and profitable exchanges no doubt could be
carried out, but not without more assistance than is now allotted to the
department.

The total number of accessions received during the year was sixty-
two, representing the following localities in the order named:

Maryland. Massachusetts. New Hampshire.

New Jersey. Wyoming. Querean Bank.

Mexico. — Virginia. Washington Territory. _
Vermont. Florida. Georgia.

Texas. Colorado. Mississippi River.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS (INCLUDING TERTIARY
FOSSILS) IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888,

By WILLIAM HEALEY Datu, Honorary Curator.

The force of the Department of Mollusks for the period reported on
in addition to the Curator, has consisted of Dr. R. E. ©. Stearns, As-
sistant Curator. and Mr. Pierre Louis Jouy, Aid. Assistance has also
been rendered from time to time in their work on the fossils collected
by the U. S. Geological Survey, by Messrs. Frank Burns and G.
Stuart, under my instructions, with the permission of the Director of
the Survey.

The work, as in previous years, has largely consisted of the reduc-
tion to order, classification, labeling, registry, and arrangement in
cases of material either in arrears or received during the current year.
The manner in which this is done has been described in previous reports,
and it does not seem necessary to repeat the details here. Excellent: pro-
gress has been made in the work of bringing up the arrears. Unless
checked by matters beyond the control of the curator, such as the stop-
page of work for alterations in the building, by the necessity of supply-
ing material to exhibitions in other cities from which our department
receives no benefit, or the illness of members of the working force, a
few years will see these arrearages cleared away. As there is no sepa-
ration in a biologic sense, so there has been no separation in an admin-
istrative sense, between the work on mollusks of the tertiary formations
and those obtained from recent seas. ‘To some extent they are kept
separated from reasons of convenience in reference and on account of
the great weight of some of the fossils, which renders it inadvisable to
place them in the same drawer with recent specimens. But it isimprac-
ticable to assort the work as between the two classes of material. The
curator was absent at Philadelphia at two different times during the
past year, aggregating about nine weeks altogether, during which time
he supervised the packing, and to a large extent personally performed
the labor of registration and packing of the very valuable collection
left to the Museum by the late Dr. Isaac Lea. This collection, apart
from the minerals with which the writer has had nothing to do, com-
prised a large number of American and European fossils, largely types
of Dr. Lea’s publications or specimens selected for their beauty and

159
160 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1883.

neat preparation. There were fossils of all ages; not the least interest-
ing were specimens received from Dr. E. Emmons himself, from the
original localities, of forms illustrative of the Taconic formation. here
was also a fine series of plant fossils, chiefly of the Coal Measures.
These varied materials have been distributed to the curators who prop-
erly take in charge such objects, the tertiary fossils and recent shells
falling to the department of mollusks. The typical collection of Unios,
which is without doubt the most valuable in existence, was kept by
Dr. Lea in table cases or drawers with the specimens arranged ina
linear series, in the order adopted in his *‘ Synopsis,” last edition. They
were laid on strips of wood grooved longitudinally, were much crowded,
and occasionally somewhat displaced. Paper numbers and names cut
out of the Synopsis were fastened to the first specimen of each species
by a little wax. These, however, were often displaced, and were, when
in place, ready to fall at a touch. Most of the specimens had pencil
notes of locality, and often of the name, written by Dr. Lea on the in-
side of the shell. While it was easy for a skilled and careful person
on the spot to recover the identification and obtain the other data, if
the specimens had been packed without being registered and perma-
nently marked, their value as types would have been almost wholly
destroyed. In order that no misfortune of this sort should occur, I
personally examined and removed every specimen, identified, and per-
manently numbered it, and, when frail or broken, wrapped and boxed it.
This involved the writing of more than eighty-five thousand figures on
the shells themselves and the registration of some three thousand par-
cels of specimens, representing more than half as many species. The
labor was very arduous, but the specimens were permanently identified
and their typical value insured for the future. The gastropods and
other shells contained in the Lea collection were left to be registered
in Washington, each parcel being in a separate tray in Dr. Lea’s col-
lection, accompanied by one or more manuscript labels. My estimate
of the number of specimens in the collection is about twenty thousand,
and there were sixty-three packing-cases required to hold them, exclu-
sive of duplicates, of which there were agreatmany. Cases to hold this
collection have been provided, in accordance with Dr. Lea’s will, and as
soon as the projected repairs are completed the northeast gallery will
be reserved for this series and other land and fresh-water shells, and
thrown open to the public. The miscellaneous land and fresh-water
shells given by Dr. Lea are numerous and valuable, including the second
best existing series of Cuming’s Philippine land shells, of rare beauty,
and fine original series of land shells from Maderia, Jamaica, and other
localities, named by Lowe, C. B. Adams, and other authorities, and
therefore having for their own species a really typical importance. It
S$ understood that, in accordance with Jaw and by direction of the U.
S. Fish Commission, the collection of Invertebrata, now at New Haven,
in charge of Prof. A. E. Verrill, has been turned over to the Museum,
DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS. 161

at least theoretically. When received, this will add more largely to
the material in the hands of the department of mollusks than any other
accession for some years. As its reception is a matter of uncertainty,
owing to the fact that the time when Professor Verrill’s report on the
Moilusea of the Fish Commission will be ready is entirely uncertain, I
would renew my suggestion of previous years that a proper series of
specimens for study and comparison be sent from New Haven to the
National Museum, where it is much needed. At present, with the mass
of work pressing upon the Department of Mollusks, it is not desirable,
even had Professor Verrill concluded his investigations, to have the
whole mass of the Fish Commission material added to what must be
administered upon. The material received from New Haven up to this
date, excepting Cephalopods in alcohol, is largely duplicate and of
little or no value to the national coliection. But for scientific study and
comparison it is important that a named series of the New England
deep-water and shore fauna, as determined by Professor Verrill, 1872
to 1887, should be accessible to students in Washington.

The total number of accessions to this department during the year is
fifty-two. Of these, fifteen lots were sent for examination and report,
two were received in the regular course from Government agencies,
eight were received in exchange either for material already furnished
or which has been subsequently furnished partly by the Department of
Mollusks and partly by other departments of the Museum. The re-
mainder weredonations. Of these the Isaac Lea collection was the most
important and the largest. The next largest accession was that of some
sixteen boxes, chiefly of Pliocene fossils from California, received from
the U. 8. Geological Survey, and collected by Dr. R. E. C. Stearns.
Dr. Stearns has also given a large number of miscellaneous specimens,
which he obtained during his absence on field-work and which were
very acceptable. A valuable though small collection was obtained in
exchange from the Museum of Wesleyan University, Middletown, Con-
necticut. The specimens were from various localities and to a consider-
able extent filled gaps in the National Collection of mollusks. <A lot of
some twenty supposed new species of Unio, from Florida, was presented
by Mr. B. H. Wright, of Penn Yan, New York, most of which were
new tothe collection. The curator gave some two hundred and fifty
species of mostly marine shells to the Museum during the year, nearly
all being new or important to the collection. A collection of interesting
south European and Turkistan shells were received in exchange from
Herr Otto Goldfuss, to whom American land shells were sent. Most of
the species sent by Herr Goldfuss were already in the collection, but
the localities were interesting and enlarged our geographical series.
Mr. Nicholas Grebnitski, of the Commander Islands, near Kamchatka,
continued his sending of mollusca, and a package received from him
during the year contained very interesting specimens from that remote
corner of the world and added several species to its known mollusk-

fauna. Mr. T. H. Aldrich has sent some acceptable specimens of marine
shells from the Mauritius and some named Kocene fossils. Lieut. J. F.
Moser, U.S. Navy, sent from the coast of Florida some very interest-
ing shells in alcohol, and Mr. Henry Hemphill a most interesting series
of varieties of the limpets of the southern California coast.

Dr. W. H. Rush submitted dredgings from deep water on the Florid-
ian coast to be named, and presented a very valuable series of them to
the Museum. We received in exchange a series of shells of South Africa
from the Albany Museum at Grahamstown, Cape Colony, put up by
the curator, Miss Mary Glanville. While awaiting instructions for
shipping the material to be sent in return we were shocked to receive
news of the death of this gifted and enthusiastic young woman, to whom,
according to South African papers, the cause of science in that country
and the Albany Museum in particular were greatly indebted. We owe
to Mrs. J. H. Everette, of Virginia, a remarkable collection of some
seventy-five pearls taken from a single individual of Ostrea virginica
Gmelin. Besides some fresh-water shells from Iowa the Museum re-
ceived from Mr. R. Ellsworth Call specimens of a singular parasite of
the land shell Succinea obliqua. This parasite Leucochloridium ameri-
canum is a new species of a genus hitherto unknown to North America,
and first characterized from a single species infesting Succinea in France.
The French species is described by Carus and figured in the Journal de
Conchyliologie (vol. xxvil, pl. x, fig. 6) for 1879. It is the larva of
Distoma macrostoma Zeller, and develops in the intestines of thrushes,
nightingales, and other birds which eat the Succinea. It is long and
slender and of a pale apple-green with blackish thaculations near the
largerend. The American species is larger, proportionally stouter, and
of a rusty brown where the European species is green. It is highly
probable that if the naturalists of lowa examine the intestines of the
robin or other coarse-feeding singing birds of that State they will find
the fully developed Distoma corresponding to this species.

The quality of the accessions in general has been good, only ten of
the fifty-two proving valueless to the Museum.

The routine work of the year has largely been spent on the general
series of exotic mollusea, of which a large proportion has been revised ;
onthe Hast American gastropods, including those of the Antillean region
and thence northward to Cape Hatteras, of which chiefly the Pleuroto-
mide and Solenoconcha remain to be revised, and the miocene and
pliocene tertiary fauna-of the United States, especially the deposits ex-
amined last year and to some extent this year, on the west coast of
Florida, from Tampa southward. Work on the gastropods of the Blake
expedition has been continued in connection with the review of the Hast
American forms above referred to. Information or assistance of more
or less importance was furnished to the following persons, among others,
the correspondence often including several letters, and the identifica-
tion of material consuming the available part of several days of labor,

The limited time for research afforded by the duties of the curator
has been devoted (1) to investigations in regard to the deep-sea mollusks
collected by the Blake and Albatross on the eastern coast of the United
States and the Antilles; (2) to a study of the fauna of the Miocene
silex-beds of Tampa Bay, Florida, and of the Pliocene of south Flor-
ida, and (3) to the relations of the members of the Tertiary mollusk
fauna with the recent species of the coast.

The papers published during the year 188788 by the curator and his
associates are noticed in the Bibliography, section 1v of the Report.

In previous reports I have stated why it is impossible to give the
exact number of specimens, species, duplicates, ete., contained in the
collection. In my last report (1886~87) I made the rough estimate that
the collection contained 425,000 specimens of all sorts. Since that time
about 30,000 specimens have been received. The total number of entries
in the Museum register or catalogue for 1886-87 was 10,530, while for
1887-88 the number is 11,804. Had we had adequate clerical assist-
ance the number might easily have been doubled. As it is it repre-
sents about 35,000 separate -specimens, classified, labeled, arranged,
and entered in the register. Omitting a series of about 1,500 duplicate
entries which was made by Dr. Lewis in 1876 in revising the Unionidae
belonging to the National Collection, and all numbers assigned to Pro-
fessor Verrill for his use in cataloguing the Fish Commission dredgings,
and of which the entries have not yet been reported to this department,
though in his possession for use in due course, the total number of
registrations to date is 81,911, representing about 250,000 specimens,
which have been administered upon, and for the most part are arranged
in such a way as to be accessible for study. The largest collection out-
side of the National Museum in this country is supposed to be that of
the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, and they are reported
to possess about 52,000 trays or lots, corresponding to our registration
numbers, or 156,000 registered specimens, against 250,000 in the
_ National Museum, in round numbers. But when we reflect that only
one-eighth of the Jeffreys collection has been registered, none of the
Aretic-Alaskan collection, and but a very small part of the, Antillean
collection of the Fish Commission, or of the Lea collection, it is evident,
164 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

leaving duplicates out of the computation altogether, that the discrep.
ancy is much greater than the above figures would convey. Without
being able to give exact figures, I have no hesitation in stating that it
is probable our mollusk-collectiou is twice as large as any other Ameri-
can collection and larger than any European collection.” In point of
the number of original types it contains it will stand second only to
the collection in the British Museum, and in the fullness of the accom-
panying data and the scientific value of the material contained in it I
have no doubt it is the equal, if not the superior, so far as recent mol-
lusks are concerned, of any collection in the world. It has the best
faunal collection in existence of the British mollusca, of the mollusks
of the North Atlantic sea-bed, of the American Arctic regions, of the
East and West North American coasts, and of the interior land and
fresh water fauna of North America. Notwithstanding all this there
are many gaps to be filled, especially in exotic species, but not until
all arrearages are cleared up and we know exactly how we stand can
we use judiciously the large and valuable supplies of duplicate material
in our possession.

The schedule showing the progress of registration during the past
vear is annexed.

By Dr. C. V. Ritry, Honorary Curator.

Considerable progress has been made during the past year in the
arrangement of material, and much more could have been made but
for the crowded condition of the laboratory, which makes it impossible
to expand and properly arrange the collections. Additional room is
sadly needed, and I earnestly urge that in some way it be obtained.

During the early part of the year a beginning was made in the ar-
rangement of the Coleoptera, and at intervals this has been continued
until all available space is occupied and but the smallest part of the
material worked up. Later some of the large Bombycid Lepidoptera
were arranged in cabinet drawers so far as these held out. In some of
the genera of the Noctuide studies were made of the material ar-
ranged. In the Diptera the Bombyliidz were separated out and tenta-
tively arranged, but there is no shelf room for the boxes, and they are
piled up on the cabinets, reducing the working space, and much more
exposed to infection from Museum pests. A very large part of the
first half of the year was employed in annotating and critically over-
hauling the Glover plates with the view of possibly editing them for
publication.

Early in 1888 a re-arrangement of the collections on the floor of the
Museum gave the department a fair exhibition court, and the collee-
tions already prepared were removed thereto, and other boxes were
prepared, so that we have at present a very fair exhibit collection on
the floor of the Museum. Several table cases, affording considerable
storage room, were also assigned to the department, and have been in
large part filled.

A considerable proportion of the time was occupied in giving infor-
mation about specimens sent, not only those of which accessions were
made, but also of those which, although of no value whatever to the
collection, are often much more troublesome, involving questions as to
life habits, methods of collecting, and determinations.

About one hundred and fifty letters were written exclusive of the re-
ports on accessions, and about twenty lots of species were determined

for students and collectors.

166 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.-

Practically the entire month of June, 1888, was occupied in prepar-
ing for the Cincinnati exposition. | And as the time was limited and no
outside assistance obtainable, I had to draw on the divisional force of
the Department of Agriculture to get the exhibit ready in time. In-
deed the amount of work to be done in arranging our extensive collec-
tion is so great that I earnestly recommend the appointment of an
additional assistant.

The accessions during the year numbered but fifty-eight against one
hundred and two during the previous year. The apparent falling off
is entirely accounted for by the fact that during the summer of 1886
and spring of i887 a very large number of specimens of Belostoma
americana and Dynastes tityus were received, these species appearing
in abnormal quantities in several portions of our territory. This year
for some reason these insects are much less abundant and attracted no
general attention, and hence the apparent decrease in number of acces-
sions received.

As a matter of fact the number of receipts of real value are fully
equal to those of the previous year, and, as before, many species and
specimens were added by myself and assistants, of which no formal
record was made. Indeed, as in previous years, by far the largest
amount of valuable material has been added as the result of my work
as United States entomologist. These collections come from the vari-
ous field agents of the Department of Agriculture and those made
by Mr. Albert Koebele, of Alameda, California, Mr. D. W. Coquillett,
of Los Angeles, California, and. by Mr. Lawrence Bruner, of West
Point, Nebraska, are particularly worthy of mention. These, with the
constant material that daily comes to the Division of Entomology from
its correspondents, have been turned over by me without special acces-
sion numbers, and I mention them particularly here because the perma-
nent numbered accessions give no sort of idea of the rich additions
which are constantly being made to our collections. In the future I
hope to have the work so systematized that I can indicate the more
important of these additions by accession number.

The following is a list of the more important numbered accessions,
which represent many hundreds of specimens:

In August one specimen Acanthocinus nodosus from Robert A. Mills, Chuluota,
Florida. No. 19,478. The specimen wasa fine one and was very acceptable, though
the species is represented in our collections.

In September there was added a vial of winged Termites from R. Hitchcock, Osaka,
Japan. No. 19,302. Interesting from their locality, and for comparison with our
own species. *

Eighteen vials of Arachnida and Myriopoda from Macon, Georgia, collected by L.
M. Underwood. No. 19,526.

Six vials of Arachnida and Myriopoda from Indian Springs, Georgia, collected by L.
M. Underwood. No. 19,533.

Six vials of Arachnida and Myriopoda from Georgia, collected by L. M. Underwood.
No. 19,542. Prof. L. M. Underwood, of Syracuse, New York, was for two months—
August and September, 1887—in the employ of the Department as a collector of
DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS, 167

Arachnida and Myriopoda, and his collections, made principally in Georgia, are of great
interest, and add very largely to the Museum collection in these classes.

Kight species of Orthoptera and Neuwroptera were from E. A. Schwarz, Washington,
District of Columbia, collected at Cocoanut Grove, Florida. No. 19,535. Principal
among these was a specimen of Oligotoma hubbardi of the Neuropterous family Embidae,
a very rare species.

Seven specimens of 4 species of Callimorpha from Mr. H. F. Schoenborn, Washington,
District of Columbia. No. 18,565. These are valuable as varieties not represented in
the Museum collection or as very tine specimens.

In October, 263 species in 729 specimens of Syrphid@ from Dr. 8. W. Williston,
New Haven, Connecticut. No. 19,702. These are the types of Bulletin U. S. National
Museum 31, mentioned in the last report. The collection is almost complete, and by
all odds the best collection of the family extant. The material of the Museum from
other sources will be added and arranged as soon as practicable. This is the most
valuable accession of the year.

In November a lot of Myriopoda and Arachnida, Virginia and New York, from L. M.
Underwood. No. 19,758. This contained the balance of the material collected by
Professor Underwood while in the employ of the Museum.

Miscellaneous lot of insects from Truxillo, Honduras, collected by Chas. H. Town-
send, U. S. National Museum. No. 19,811. Contained a considerable number of
bright and attractive species, representing some of the more common species of the
locality.

In January a lot of Central American Longicornia and Carabidae, determined by H.
W. Bates, from Messrs. Godman & Salvin, 10 Chandos Street, Cavendish Square,
London, England. No. 20,007. This is a valuable lot of insects, typical of many of
the species described in the Biologia Centrali Americana, and forming in the two
families represented an excellent nucleus for a Central American collection.

Also a large lot of unmounted Madagascar Coleoptera from Edward Bartlett, Maid-
stone, Kent, England (through Robert Ridgway). No. 20,093. Valuable as being
the first representation of the insects of this region. ' The specimens have not yet been
mounted.

In February, 14 new species of Myriopods from C. H. Bollman, Bloomington, Indiana.
No. 20,155. Types of species described in the Proceedings of the U.S. National
Museum.

In March, 133 specimens of 36 species of Diptera from D. W. Coquillett, Los Angeles,
. California, through the Curator. No. 20,336. This lot contained mostly Bombyltidz

from California or adjacent localities, and very largely typical of species described by
Mr. Coquillett.

In April a small lot of Lepidoptera from State Laboratory of Natural History, Cham-
paign, Illinois. No. 20,395. Quite aseries of fine specimens were sent on for deter-
mination by the above institution, from which several very good species were obtained
for the Museum.

In May, 3 species in 7 specimens of Lachnosterna from E, A. Schwarz, Washington,
District of Columbia. No. 20,639. Florida species, not represented in our collection,
apd obtained in exchange.

The larger part of the routine work is the care and preservatior of the
collections. In no other department perhaps is there as much danger
of injury from Museum pests or more care and time required to keep
up the character of-specimens. The time thus spent shows very little
apparent result. The mounting and placing of accessions and work of
preparation also takes up a large portion of time.

Still a great deal has been accomplished in the line of systematic
arrangement of both exhibit and study series, the general review of
which will be found in the beginning of this Report.
168 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

In the autumn and early winter the curator made another trip to
Europe, taking with him a number of interesting and undetermined
species, especially among the Micro-lepidoptera, for determination and
comparison. A number of correspondents and specialists were met
and a number of notes in some of the largest museums were made.

In August, 1887, both the curator and the assistant curator, Mr. J. B.
Smith, attended the meeting of the American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science at New York City. Mr. Smith took with him a
series of the undetermined Geometride in the Museum collection for
comparison with the New York collections, and nearly all of these were
determined.

During this trip quite a number of collections were examined by Mr.
Smith, and some good material was obtained for our collection.

A large lot of material was received through the curator from the
Department of Agriculture, and its proper disposition occupied consid-
erable time.

During September the curator was absent in Kurope, while the as-
sistant was on leave during the greater portion of the month. The
time available was entirely devoted to overhauling the collection, to
correspondence, and to placing the material received, which was un-
usually abundant.

During the month of October the Williston collection of Syrphide
was received at the Museum, and this, containing 263 species in 729
specimens, was carefully gone over, checked, and general condition
noted.

The Sphingidw or Hawk Moths were re-arranged in conformity with a
monograph which Mr. Smith has been preparing and which is referred
to later on.

The series contains 69 species in 250 specimens. The duplicates were
also arranged and formed a series of 39 species in 167 specimens, the
majority of which, however, were used later in the exhibit series.

In the same family the biologic material was also arranged, and illus-
trates more or less completely 27 species. There are 64 imagines, 60
blown larvee, 23 pup, and 34 vials, containing upwards of 50 speci-
mens of larve and eggs. Altogether about 231 specimens in the series.
There are, in addition, a series of, as yet, undetermined larve.

In the Coleoptera the family Cicindelide was classified and arranged
in seven boxes. The collection contains 99 species and varieties in 713

‘specimens, and is therefore an extremely rich one.
A duplicate series, formed at the same time, shows 47 species and va-
rieties in 747 specimens.

In November an unusual number of species for determination were
received from correspondents of the Museum, from some of which good
material was obtained for our collection.

In the Orthoptera the unnamed material in Acridiide was selected
out-and sent to Mr. Lawrence Bruner, of West Point, Nebraska, for

study, at hisrequest. his material was returned jater, with some addi-
tions new to the collection.

In Coleoptera the systematic arrangement has been contitued, and
nine of the Carabid genera were arranged in eight boxes. Thus far 83
species and varieties are represented, and the material has not yet
been entirely sifted. The extreme wealth of material, the number of
the collections among which it is scattered, and the small size of some

of the species renders the task of arrangement a slow one.
In the Lepidoptera the family Saturniide has been arranged in five

eabinet drawers.

cies are needed to complete the family.

We have 17 species in 58 spevimens, and but 4 spe-
Of duplicates we have 7 spe-

cies in 47 specimens, a large proportion of which were subsequently
used in the exhibit series.

From Dr. Marx, of the Department of Agriculture, were received
one hundred and twenty-six vials of named Arachnida, many of them
specimens which had been previously turned over to him for study, but

quite a number of which were donated by him.

on vial blocks and temporarily arranged.
Considerable time was spent in going over a portion of the collection

for Museum pests.

These were all mounted

During December the work of thoroughly examining the collection
was completed and the ordinary routine matters attended to. +

In January, 1888, the re-arrangement of material on the floor of the
Museum placed a court at the disposal of this Department for exhibit
