UPON

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. S NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1888.

BY
G. BROWN GOODE,
Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of the National Museum.

A.—GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

In January, 1847, the first Board of Regents after many weeks of
consultation and deliberation over the plans for the organization of the
Smithsonian Institution unanimously voted the following resolution:

Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress, and in accord-
ance with the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that one of
the principal modes of executing the act and the trust, is the accumulation
of collections of specimens and objects of natural history and of elegant art,
and the gradual formation of a library of valuable works pertaining to all
departments of human knowledge, to the end that a copious store-house of
materials of science, literature, and art may be provided, which shall ex-
cite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall assist the original
investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to the pursuit
of any branch of knowledge.*

This was a high ideal for the future National Museum, but it is one
which it has been year after year more closely approaching, and it is
hoped that the present report will show that the work accomplished
during the fiscal year of 188788 has brought us still nearer to its re-
alization.

With the death of Professor Baird, August 19, 1887, the National
Museum passed from under the direction of the mind by which its
policy had been planned for many years. If his biography could be
properly written, it would include a fall history of the Museum, as well
as of the Fish Commission, and in minor degree ot the Smithsonian In-
stitution itself, for as secretary and assistant secretary he was associated
with nearly every phase of its activity during thirty-seven of its forty-

one years of corporate existence. With the Fish Commission, first of
~ all, his name is identified as its founder as well as its chief adminis.

trator, and with the National Museum almost as closely, though less ex-
clusively, since, though not its originator nor its sole director, his
was, aS has been said, for a very long time the master mind in its
management. His relation to it was very similar to that held by Sir
Henry Cole to the great national establishment at South Kensington
in England, so well described in the volumes entitled “ Fifty Years of
Public Work,” and recently published by his son, Mr. Alan Cole.

With the death of Professor Baird the Museum must of necessity
enter upon a new period in its history, for his successors, be they never
so desirous of perpetuating his policy, cannot apply to its management

‘the same kind of supervision, nor the result of such a life-time of ex-
perience and observation.

Upon the firm foundation which he has laid they must build a super-
structure, harmonious in plan, but, it may be, different in proportions
and even in material. Their safest course must.be not to work as he
did, under cireumstanees different from those which are henceforth to
exist, but to try to work as he would have done in connection with
these changed circumstances.

EARLY HISTORY OF THE MUSEUM.

The idea of a national museum in the city of Washington was first
suggested by the Hon. Joel Roberts Poinsett, of South Carolina, Sec-
retary of War under President Van Buren, who in 1840.organized, for
the purpose of establishing such a museutn, a society called ‘‘The Na-
tional Institution,” afterwards ‘‘ The National Institute,” which was
exceedingly prosperous and active for four years. By this Society the
nucleus for a national museum was gathered in the Patent Office building
in Washington, and public opinion was educated to consider the es-
tablishment of such an institution worthy of the attention of the Gov-
ernment of the United States. In 1846, having failed in securing the
public recognition at which it aimed, and the Smithsonian Institution
being by its charter entitled to take possession of the extensive Goy-
ernment collections already assembled in its charge, the society became
torpid, and eventually, in 1861, passed out of existence.

From 1844 to 1858, when the so-called “‘ National Cabinet of Curiosi-
ties” passed into the charge of the Smithsonian Institution, the term -
‘¢ National Museum” was in disuse. From that time onward, however,
it was used, unofficially, to designate the collections in the Smithson-
ian building.

After the ‘+ National Cabinet” was delivered to the Regents, appro-
priations were made by Congress for its maintenance. During the
twenty-three years which followed, the collections were greatly increased
and were made the subjects of numerous important memoirs upon the
natural history and ethnology of America. The public halls, with their
arrangements for the exhibition of a portion of the collections, also re-
ceived a due share of attention, and a certain amount of instruction and
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ie

pleasure was afforded to visitors. The appropriations, however, were —
meagre, the space limited, and the staff was so inadequate that little
could be done except to keep the collections in good preservation.

The Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia was an event of great eduea-
tional importance to the people of the United States ; and not the least
of its benefits were the lessons it taught as to the possibilities for good
in public museums. The objects which at the close of the Centennial
were given to the United States for its National Museum were of much
intrinsic value, but were still more important in that they led to the
erection of a large building for the expansion of the Museum itself.

From 1876 to 1881 was a period of quiet preparation for future effort.
From 1881 to 1888, another period of seven years, its growth has been
rapid, though the organism is still in its infancy. These seven years
have been years of experiment, but it is hoped that it is now evident to
the people and to Congress that the young museum is now ready to
begin a promising progress toward maturity.

PROGRESS IN THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM.

Among the more important features of the work, up to the present
time, certain definite steps of progress have been taken, among the
most important of which may be mentioned:

(1) An organization of the Museum staff has been effected—efficient
for present purposes and capable of expansion and extension as ocea-
sion may require.

(2) Through the agency of this staff, the materialsin the Museum,
the accumulations of nearly half a century, have been examined, classi-
fied, and brought under control.

(3) The collections have been almost quadrupled in extent.

(4) A beginning has been made toward the development of a
thoroughly labeled exhibition series, available for the instruction of
the public.

(5) A thorough study of the organizations and systems of classifica-
_ tion in other museums throughout the world has been made, the results
of which are beginning to appear in the work of the Museum staff. A
report upon the great museums of the world is in preparation and will
soon be published.

(6) Many new methods of installation have been developed by experi-
ments in the Museum, and in the expositions in which the Museum has
participated. These are tinding favor, and are being adopted in many
similar establishments at home and abroad, and will certainly add to
the economy and success of our own administration.

(7) Science has been forwarded by the publication of many hundreds
of papers describing the materials in the Museum, while the work of
_ specialists in the production of these papers has greatly improved the
significance and value of the collections,
6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

NECESSITY FOR A NATIONAL MUSEUM.

That the United States must have a National Museum is so evident
that the proposition needs no argument for its support.

Every considerable nation has a museum or group of museums in its
capital city—centres of scientific and educational activity—the treas-
ure-houses of the nation, filled with memorials of national triumphs in
the fields of science, art, and industrial progress.

They are legitimate objects of national pride, for upon the character
of its museum and hbraries intelligent persons visiting a country vcry
properly base their judgment as to the nature and degree of the civili-
zation of the people.

In most great cities, as I have said, there is a group of museums.
London, for instance, has—

. The British Museum, with its collection of books and manuscripts, its galleries of
archeology, historic and prehistoric, its collection of coins, pottery, sculpture, ete.
The Natural History Museum (devoted to botany, mineralogy, and geology).
The South Kensington Museum (arts and art-manufactures).
The Bethnal Green Museum (industrial and decorative art).
The Nationa] Gallery of Art.
The National Portrait Gallery.
The Museum of Practical Geology.
The Museum of Economie Botany at Kew.
The Imperial Institute (commerce and natural resources of tke British Empire).
The Parkes Museum of Hygiene.
The India Museum.
The Patent Musem.
The Hunterian Museum (comparative anatomy).
The Museum of Naval Architecture.
The National Museum of Fisheries, and others.

Paris has—

The Museum of the Louvre (art and archeology).

The Luxembourg Museum (modern art).

The Museum of Natural History and Comparative Anatomy in the Garden of Plants.
The Geological Museum.

The Ethnological Museum at the Trocadero.

The Museum of Arts and Manufactures.

The Museum of the City of Paris.

The St. Germain Museum (French archeology).

The Cluny Museum (costumes, furniture, and decoration (?)).

The Military Museum at the Hotel des Invalides.

The Guimet Museum (history of religion).

The Museum of Marine Architecture in the Louvre. g
The Collections at the Gobelin and Sévres establishments, and others.,

Berlin, St. Petersburg, and Vienna have similar groups, and so have
Florence, Christiania, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Leyden, Brussels, Mad-
rid, Buda-Besth, Tokio, and other national establishments.

It should be borne in mind that here in Washington under the roofs
of the Smithsonian and New Museum buildings are grouped together
collections whieh in London, Paris, or any other of the European
capitals are provided for in a group of museums, for accommodating
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. a

which a much larger number of equally commodious buildings is found

needful.
POSSIBILITIES OF THE FUTURE.

It is possible, as I remarked in last year’s report, to show that Wash-
ington may readily be made the seat of one of the greatest museums in
the world. It will perhaps be neither practicable nor desirable to
gather together in Washington collections of ancient medieval art,
such as those which adorn the capitals of Hurope; but a representative
series of such objects will undoubtedly grow up, which shall tend to edu-
cate the public taste, and to promote, so far as possible, the study of the
elements of art and the history of civilization, as well as to forward the
growth of the arts of design. This having been accomplished, the at-
tention of the Museum should be directed mainly toward the exhibition
of the geology and natural history of America, and its natural resources,
to the preservation of memorials of its aboriginal inhabitants, and the
exposition of the arts and industries of America. :

It is evident that the National Museum of the United States will of
necessity have features peculiar to itself, developed in response to the
peculiar needs of the people of this continent. Itshould be remembered
that the national collections of every principal European nation are di-
vided into several groups, each under separate administration, though
often within the general control of some central authority. In France,
for instance, most of the museums are under the Ministry of Public In-
struction, and in England, to a less extent, under the Department of
Science and Art.

In the great European capitals the public collections are scattered
through various parts of the cities, in museums with distinctive names
and independentin their organizations. Much of the work which should
properly be done by such museums is omitted, because no one of them
has seen fit to undertake it; while, on the other hand, much labor is du-
plicated, which is perhaps equally unfortunate, collections of similar
scope and purpose being maintained in different parts of the same city.
One of the chief objections to such division of effort is that much of the
value of large collections in any department is lost by failure to concen-
trate them where they may be studied and compared side by side. In
Washington the national collections are all, without exception, concen-
trated in one group of buildings. The Army Medical Museum now oc-
cupies a building side by side with those under the control of the Smith-
sonian Institution, and this proximity, in connection with the long-estab-
lished policy of co-operation between the two organizations, will cause
them to be, for all practical purposes, united in interest.

POSSIBILITIES OF INCREASE AND IMPROVEMENT.

Although the appropriations from the public treasury for the main-
tenance of a national museum are small, compared with those in sev-
eral European countries, the value of objects given by private individ-
8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

uals is proportionately larger. The actual value of such contributions
for ten years past, has not, it is estimated, fallen short of $20,000 a year,
and in some years has been greater.

Among important gifts may be mentioned such as the George Catlin
Indian Gallery, of inestimable value to the American historian and eth-
nologist; the Riley collection of North American insects, the finest in
existence, containing 150,000 specimens, and easily worth $50,000; the
coliection bequeathed in 1887 by the late Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia,
containing besides minerals and other objects, about 20,000 concholog-
ical specimens, and appraised by the State at $10,000; and the collec-
tion of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the transfer of
which from Philadelphia to Washington, a special appropriation was
made by Congress.

Some exceedingly valuable collections in this country and in Kurope
have been bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution which have not
yet come into its possession. Within the past ten years it is estimated
that individuals to the number of at least a thousand have made gifts
to the Museum to the value of $100 or more.

Of the fourteen hundred and eighty-two separate lots of specimens
received within the past fiscal year at least one thousand were gifts,
from nearly as many individuals—some of little value, others very
- important.

Not a day passes during which some stranger, pleased with the work
of the Museum, does not voluntarily send in some contribution more
or less important.

The National Museum now contains about 2,900,000 objects, distrib-
uted among the various departments, as is shown in the table on page
22, of this report. .

The late Professor Baird was once asked whether the value of the
collections in the National Museum was equal to the amount which had
been expended in its maintenance. - He replied, unhesitatingly, that al-
though it would be by no means a fair criterion of their value he did
not doubt that by a judicious and careful system of saie the entire sum
could be recovered.

One of the most striking features in the affairs of the Museum is the
manner in which its collections are increasing.

In 1887 the number of specimens was more than ten times as great —
as five years before. :

In the last fiscal year twenty-five thousand new lots or groups of
specimens were entered upon the Museum catalogue.

This increase, as has been shown, is in large degree spontaneous, only
a small amount of money being available for the purchase of new
material. :

As might be supposed, a considerable proportion of the objects given
duplicate material already on hand, and although these contributions
can with the utmost advantage be used for distribution to other
museums and schools, they do not increase as much as is desired the
4

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Sa

value of the collections for study by specialists, and for general educa-
tional purposes. The need of a larger fund for the purchase of speci-
mens is yearly more manifest. Exceedingly important material is
constantly offered to us at prices very much below what it would cost
to obtain it by collecting, and in many instances, when refused, it is
eagerly taken by the museums and institutions of Europe.

The most enlightened nations of Europe do not hesitate to spend
money liberally to promote the interests of their national museums.

For the purchase of specimens for the South Kensington Museum
from 1853 to 1887 $1,586,634 was expended; or a yearly average of
nearly $47,000.

Toward her other museums Bacland is equally liberal. Exact
statistics are not at hand, but it is quite within bounds to assert that
her average expenditures for the purchase of new objects for museums
in London is not less than $500,000 a year.

The museums of England are rich with the accumulations of cen-
turies. The National Museum of the United States is young and has
enormous deficiencies in every department. It needs, more than any
museum in Europe, the opportunity to increase its resources through
purchase. The total amount expended for the purchase of specimens
for the National Museum since its foundation has not exceeded $20,000,
and never in one year more than $8,500.

More has been expended for the improvement of two museums in

the city of New York in the past four years than has ever been expended

by the general Government upon the Museum in Washington.

Within the past year three mortifying instances have occurred of the
inability of the National wu useum to buy specimens needed to complete
its collections. ‘

A very valuable collection of minerals, absolutely essential to the
national collections and for some years on deposit in the National
Museum, was withdrawn by its owner and placed in a school museum

“in a neighboring city, because $4,000 could not be had for its purchase—

a sum far below its value.

A collection of implements and weapons illustrating the history of
the natives of Alaska, gathered by an officer in the U.S. Navy, and
almost indispensable for the completion of the national ethnological
collection, was sold to a museum in a neighboring city for $12,000,
while the National Museum had no money to expend for such objects.

One of the most important collections of birds in America, the loss of
which was a national misfortune, was taken from the city of Washing-
ton and sold to the British Museum for $10,000, no American institu-
tion having money available for its purchase.

Instances of this kind occur nearly every month in every year.

The National Museum has had the option for several years of the
purchase at cost of $80,000 of a collection of minerals, which once
acquired would enable its mineralogical department to rank among the
first in the world. Congress has never been asked to make an appro-
10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

priation for its purchase, simply because of unwillingness to ask for
that which might not be granted. Minerals, having a money value,
can readily be sold, and are not very often given to the Museum, and
the poverty of its mineralogical collection is by no means creditable to
the nation. ;

The-Museum receives many valuable gifts from Government officials
abroad, especially from those in the consular and diplomatic service,
and in the Navy.

{ff the actual cost of gathering specimens could be paid, the time and
experience of these men would gladly be given gratuitously. In this
way, by the expenditure of a few thousands eath year, extensive and
important additions might be made to the national collections.

THE NECESSITY FOR A NEW MUSEUM BUILDING.

The National Museum is now approaching an important crisis in its
history. Its future will depend upon the action of Congress in granting
it an additional building, for without more room its growth can not but
be in large degree arrested.

The necessity for additional room is constantly increasing, and sev-
eral of the collections, to wit, transportation and engineering, fishes,
reptiles, birds’ eggs, mollusks, insects, marine invertebrates, vertebrate
and invertebrate fossils, fossil and recent plants, are in Some instances
wholly unprovided for, and in others only iu a very inadequate degree.

In the main hall of the Smithsonian building is still exhibited the
collection of birds. A few cases containing birds’ eggs and shells have
recently been arranged along the center of this hall.

There are at the present time nineteen departments in the National
Museum, eleven of which have no space assigned to them in the Museum
building, solely on account of its crowded condition. The collection
of prehistoric anthropological objects remains installed on the second
floor of the Smithsonian building. The collections of the remaining ten
departments can not be exhibited or even properly arranged and classi-
fied without more room. ‘These collections are at present stored in the
attics and basements of the Smithsonian and Armory buildings, and are
inaccessible for study and for the other purposes for which they were
obtained. The specimens comprising these collections are not simply
objects of natural history, possessing an abstract interest to the stu-
dent, but represent the application of natural objects to the industries,
‘and, as such, are of great importance. There are several collections of
ores, minerals, building stones, and of objects representing various arts
‘and industries, which are of very great value, since they furnish to the
American manufacturer and designer information of inestimable im-
‘portance.

The increase in the national collections during the last six years may
perhaps be best described by the statement that in 1882 the total
number of specimens recorded in the Museum was about 183,000; while
in 1887 the records indicated the possession of more than 2,900,000.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 11

specimens. It is proper to say in this connection that the actual in-
crease was not so great as shown by the records, since during this
period a large amount of material previously received had been brought
’ under control and placed on the books of the Museum. It should also
be borne in mind that the present Museum building was planned with
reference to the reception of the material j in its custody at the time of
its construction.

In the Armory building there are at the present time several hun-
dreds of boxes containing valuable material which has never been un-
packed, since there is no space available for the display of the specimens.
Many of the boxes contain collections which were brought to the Museum
through the medium of special acts of Congress.

Independently of the collections obtained at expositions, a very large
amount of material has been received from foreign Governments, among
which may be mentioned those of Mexico, Central America, several of
the South American States, and Japan, which have made extensive con-
tributions to the zodlogical, geological, ethnological, and technological
collections.

APPRECIATION BY FORMIGN NATIONS.

The new methods of work and of museum arrangement, which have
srown up here, have attracted much attention abroad. Mexico, in
1837, sent the entire collections of the National Natural History Mu-
seums, then just being founded, to Washington, in charge of two of her
principal naturalists, who passed six months at the National Museum
identifying their material and studying the methods of administration.
Costa Rica, forming a national museum, sent its director here for a six
months’ course of study.

Japan has sent the entire national collection of birds to the Museum
to be studied and reported upon by one of the naturalists of the Mu-
seum staff.

Germany has been supplied with a complete set of plans and illustra-
tions of methods of administration at the request of the Director of the
National Zosdlogical Museum.

In 1883, at the Fisheries Exhibition in London, the methods of the
National Mnsenrn were strictly adhered to in the arrangement of the
display made by the United States.

In 1888, in his address as president of the Anthropological Society
of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, General
Pitt-Rivers said that the American display at the Fishery Exhibition
was the only thing-done in the true spirit of modern science in the
whole series of professedly scientific exhibitions held in London within
the past six ix years. a

* The words ds of General Pitt-Rivers in 1488 are simply : a repetition of what he said
in 1883, made stronger by the observations of five more years of exhibitions in Europe.
In 1883 he wrote to the London Times:

Sir: In confirmation of the praise you justly bestow on the arrangement of the
United States gopenEen in the Fisheries Exhibition 1 beg to draw attention to the

12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Such expressious of opinion, coupled with the constant praise with
which Kuropean journals speak of the scientific work of our Govern-
ment departments, can not but be gratifying, and it should be a matter
of national pride to merit it.

THE RELATIONS OF THE MUSEUM TO THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

The Smithsonian Institution, though it bears the name of a private
citizen and a foreigner, has been for nearly half a century one of the
principal rallying points of the scientific workers of America. It has
also been intimately connected with very many of the most important
scientific undertakings of the Government.

Many wise and enlightened scholars have given to its service the best
years of their lives, and some of the most eminent scientific men our
country has given birth to have passed their entire lifetime in work for
itssuccess. Its publications, six hundred and seventy in number, which
when combined make up over one hundred dignified volumes, are to be
found in every important library in the world, and some of them, it is
safe to say, on the working table of every scientific investigator in the
world who can read English.

Through these books, through the reputation of the men who have
worked for it and through it, and through the good accomplished by its
system of international exchange, by means of which within the past
thirty-eight years 1,262,114 packages of books and other scientific and
literary materials have been distributed to every region of the earth,
it has acquired a reputation at least as far reaching as that of any other
institution of learning in the world.

It is therefore representative of what is deemed in other lands the
chief glory of this nation, for whatever may be thought in other coun-
tries of American art, of American literature, American institutions
generally, the science of America is accepted without question as equal
to the best.

In the scientific journals of Great Britain and other European coun-
tries, the reader finds most appreciative reviews of the scientific pub-
lications of the Smithsonian, the Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology,
the Geological Survey, the Department of Agriculture, and the Fish
Commission, and they are coustantly holding up the Government of
the United States, as an example to their own, of what governments
should do for the support of their scientific institutions. ~

fact that in the whole exhibition it is the only one which is arranged historically. °
In the Chinese, Japanese, Scandinavian, and Dutch courts there are objects which
the scientific student of the arts of life may pick out and arrange in the proper order
in his own mind; but in that of the United States, following the method adopted in
the National Museum in Washington, there bas been attempted something more—
to bring the department into harmony with modern ideas. This gives to the exhi-
bition an interest which is apart from commerce, and an interest which is beyond
the mere requirements of fish culture, and it may be regarded as one out of many in-
dications of the way in which the enlightened Government of the United States mark
their appreciation of the demands of science.

I have the honor to be, sir, yours obediently, .
A. Pitt-RIVERs.
Ey REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13

It is surely a legitimate source of pride to Americans that their work
in science should be so thoroughly appreciated by eastern nations, and
it is important that the reputation should be maintained. Nothing can
be more in consonance with the spirit of our Government, nor more in
accord with the injunction of Washington in his “Farewell Address,”
lately admiringly quoted by Sir Lyon Playfair in his address as presi-
dent of the British Association for the Advancement of Science:

Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the
general diffusion of knowledge.

In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public
opinion it should be enlightened.

No one has been able to show why Smithson selected the United
States as the seat of his foundation. He had no acquaintances in Amer-
ica, nor does he appear to have had any books relating to America ex-
cept two. Khees quotes from one of these [‘‘ Travels through North
America,” by Isaac Weld, secretary of the Royal Society], a paragraph
concerning Washington, then a small town of 5,000 inhabitants, in

’ which it is predicted that ‘‘ the Federal city, as soon as navigation is

perfected, will increase most rapidly, and that at a future day, if the
affairs of the United States go on as rapidly as they have done, it will
become the grand emporium of the West, and rival in magnitude and
splendor the cities of the whole world.”

Inspired by a belief in the future greatness of the new nation, real-
izing that while the needs of England were well met by existing organ-
izations such as would not be likely to spring up for many years in a
new, poor, and growing country, he founded in the new England an in-
stitution of learning, the civilizing power of which has been of inealeu-
lable value. Who can attempt to say what the condition of the United
States would have been to-day without this bequest ?

In the words of John Quincy Adams:

Of all the foundations of establishments for pious or charitable uses
which ever signalized the spirit of the age or the comprehensive beneficence
of the founder, none can be named more deserving the approbation of man-
kind.

The most important service by far which the Smithsonian Institution
has rendered to the nation, has been that from year to year, since 1846—
intangible but none the less appreciable—by its constant co-operation
with the Government, public institutions and individuals in every en-
terprise, scientific or educational, which needed its advice, support or

aid from its resources.

There have been, however, material results of its activities, the ex-
tent of which can not fail to impress any one who will look at them ;
the most. important of these are the Library and the Museum, which
have grown up under its fostering care.

The library has been accumulated without aid from the treasury of
the United States; it has, in fact, been the result of an extensive system

of exchanges, the publications of the Institution having been used to
14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

obtain similar publications from institutions of learning in all parts of
the world.

In return for its own publications the Institution has received the
books which form its library.

This library, consisting of more than a quarter of a million volumes
and parts of volumes, has for over twenty years been deposited at the
Capitol as a portion of the Congressional Library, and is constantly
being increased. In the last fiscal year nineteen thousand titles were
thus added to the national collection of books.

Chiefly through its exchange system, the Smithsonian had, in 1865,
accumulated about forty thousand volumes, largely publications of
learned societies, containing the record of the actual progress of the
world in all that pertains tothe mental and physical development of the
human family, and affording the means of tracing the history of at least
every branch of positive science since the days of revival of letters un-
til the present time.

These books, in many instances presents from old Kuropean libraries,
and not to be obtained by purchase, formed even then one of the best
collections of the kind in the world.

The danger incurred from the fire of that year, and the fact that the
greater portion of these volumes, being unbound and crowded into in-
sufficient space, could not be readily consulted, while the expense to be
incurred for their binding, enlarged room, and other purposes connected
with their use threatened to grow beyond the means of the Institution,
appear to have been the moving causes which determined the Regents
to accept an arrangement by which Congress was to place the Smith-
sonian Library with its own in the Capitol, subject to the right of the
Regents to withdraw the books on paying the charges of binding, ete.
Owing to the same causes (which have affected the Library of Congress
itself) these principal conditions, except as regards their custody in a
fire-proof building, have never been fulfilled.

The books are still deposited chiefly in the Capitol, but though they
have now increased from 40,000 to fully 250,000 volumes and parts of
volumes, and form one of the most valuable collection of the kind in
existence, they not only remain unbound, but in a far more crowded
and inaccessible condition than they were before the transfer. It is
hardly necessary to add that these facts are deplored by no one more
than by the present efficient Librarian of Congress.

The purchasing power of the publications of the institution, when
offered in exchange, is far greater than that of money, and its benefit is
exerted chiefly in behalf of the National Library, and also to a consid-
erable extent in behalf of the National Museum.

The amount expended during the past forty years from the private
fund of the institution in the publication of books for gratuitous dis-
tribution has been $350,000, a sum nearly halfas great as the original
Smithson bequest, -
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15

These publications have had their influence for good in many ways,
but in addition to this, a library much more than equal in value to the
outlay, has through their buying power come into the possession of the
nation.

In addition to all this, a large amount of material has been acquired
for the Museum by direct expenditure from the private fund of the
Smithsonian Institution. The value of the collections thus acquired is
estimated to be more than equal to the whole amount of the Smithson
bequest.

The early history of the Museum was much like that of the library.
It was not until 1858 that it became the authorized depository of the
scientific collections of the Government, and it was not until after 1876
that it was officially recognized as the National Museum of the United
States.

But for the provident forethought of the Sivitheontaa Institution, the
United States would probably still be without even a reputable nuclease
for a National Museum.

The relations of the Museum to the system of popular lectures, for
many years established in “Washington, and the assistance which it
affords each year to students of science, is referred to elsewhere in this
report.

The Institution publishes many circulars giving information on scien-
tific subjects which are distributed gratuitously to those who write to
make inquiries, and this system is being continually extended. In ad-
dition to this, a large correspondence is carried on with people in search
of information on scientific topics. Probably three thousand letters a
year go out to people who write seeking to know the name of some
object, or other scientific fact.* Inquiries of this kind are always an-
swered promptly and fully, and frequently, to intelligent inquirers,
books are sent, which will enable them to find out such names for them-
selves in future. This work has not only an educational value but often
a great economic importance as well; as, for instance, when some com-
mon mineral has been mistaken for one of value, some useless plant
has been wrongly identitied and supposed to be of service in medicine,
or some harmless animal feared as noxious.

The publications of the Institution and its dependencies reach every
State and almost every county in the United States. A careful study
of the subject recently made by the president of one of the scientific
societies in Washington seems to indicate that there are several States
which are reached by no scientific publications whatever except those
distributed gratuitously by the Government.

Speaking of the Smithsonian Institution proper, and not of the Mu-
seum or any other trust that it administers, it may be stated that noth-
ing could be so desirable for the Institution as that Congress should ex-
amine for itself whether, on the whole, in the execution of the trust of
Smithson, more has been given to the Government than has been re:

I PTE A A FR

16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

/

ceived ; for if, in attempting to increase and diffuse knowledge among
mankind, the machinery of the Institution’s action has been such that
it has incidentally paid over to the Government the equivalent of much
more than the whole original fund, these facts should surely be known
to those who have to ask themselves in what spirit as well as for what
purpose the Institution expends money placed in its eharge.

Professor Langley has pointed out that ‘although by the judicious
administration of the Smithson fund nearly a million and a half dollars—
the fruits of its investment—have been applied during the past forty
years to the advancement of science and education in America (in ad-
dition to the principal $703,000, larger now than ever before) it should
be remembered that the income of the Instiution is only $42,000 a year,
a sum much smaller in its power to effect results than ever in previous
years.” ae

Can the United States fail to recognize its obligation to supplement
_ liberally this private contriburion for public good, especially if it be
born in mind that, as Professor Langley has recently shown, the Insti-
tution has left in perpetual charge of the nation, in the Museum alone,
property acquired out of its private fund (and to which it has appar-
ently the same title) which is probably now more than equal in value to
the whole amount of the Smithsonian bequest.

THE EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE MUSEUM. ~~ -

The work of the Museum, if it only performed the functions of an
institution for scientific investigation, would be of sufficient value to
justify its maintenance and extension.

As a matter of fact, it not only performs these functions but also does
a very great deal to render the resources of science available to the
public at large.

Professor Huxley’s definition of a museum was that it is “a consulta-
tive library of objects.”

The National Museum is a consultative library for the scientific man,
and it is Something more. It aims to be an agency for the instruction
of the people of the whole country, and to keep especially in mind the
needs of those whose time is not devoted to the study of science.

The spirit in which the work of the Museum is being carried on was
voiced in the address of one of its officers before the American Histori-
cal Association at its recent meeting in this city, in which if was said:

(1) That public institutions of this kind are not intended for the few, but
Sor the enlightenment and education of the masses.

(2) That the public has a right to full participation in the results of the
work of the scientific establishments which they are helping to maimtain.

(3) That one of the chief duties of the officers of these instutions ts to pro-
vide means by which such results may be presented in an attractive as well
as an intelligible form.

No scientific institution is more thoroughly committed to the work of
the diffusion of knowledge than is the Smithsonian Institution, and no
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 17

department of its activity is more capable of usefulness in this direc-
tion than is the National Museum.

The benefits of the Museum are extended not only to the specialists
in its laboratories and to the hundreds of thousands of visitors, from
all parts of the United States who pass its doors each year, but to local
institutions and their visitors throughout the country.

In accordance with long-sanctioned usage, the duplicate specimens
in the Museum are made up into sets and distributed to schools and
museums, accurately named, and of great service, both for museum and
class-room use.

The reports of the Smithsonian Institution will show how many hun-
dred thousands of objects have been thus distributed during the past

-twenty years. Hivery museum in the United States has profited in
this way, and by its system of exchange the Museum has, while enrich-
ing itself, contributed largely to the stores of every important scientific
museum in the world.

Not only are specimens thus sent out, but aid is rendered in other
ways. Within the last year not less than forty local museums in the
United States were supplied with working plans of cases in use in the
Museum, and similar sets of plans have been supplied within the past
few years to national museums in other countries.

Not only do the people of the country at large profit by the work of
the Smithsonian, as made available to local institutions, but they profit
directly, and personally to a very considerable extent.

The curator of each department in the Museum is expected to be an
- authority in his own line of work, and the knowledge of the whole staff
_of experts is thus placed without cost at the service of every citizen.

B.—ORGANIZATION AND SCOPE OF THE MUSEUM.

The National Museum is under the direction of the Smithsonian In-
stitution, which is governed by an establishment consisting of the
President of the United States and his Cabinet, the Commissioner of
Patents, and the Board of Regents, which latter is composed of the
Vice-President, Chief-Justice of the United States, three members of
the Senate, three members of the House of Representatives, and six
other citizens not members of Congress, two of whom are residents of
the city of Washington.

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to whom is intrusted
the actual management of its affairs, is by law the “keeper of the col-
lections.” The staff at the present time is composed of the Assistant
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in charge of the National
Museum, and twenty-seven curators and acting curators, seventeen of
whom receive no salary from the Museum appropriation. There are
also twelve administrative departments.

18 - REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The collections of the Museum are made up, in large part, of the
following materials:

1. The natural history and anthropological collections, accumulated
since 1850 by the efforts of the officers and correspondents of the Smith-
sonian Institution.

2. The collections of the Wilkes exploring expedition, the Perry ex-
pedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions.

3. The collections of the scientific officers of the Pacific Railroad sur-
vey, the Mexican boundary survey, and of the surveys carried on by the
Engineer Corps of the Army.

4. The collections of the U. S. geological surveys under the direc-
tion of the U.S. geologists, ce King, and Powell.

5. The collections of the U. 8S. fish Commission.

-6. The gifts by foreign Governments to the Museum or to the Presi-
dent or other public officers of the United States, who are fordidden by
law to retain such gifts in their private posessions.

7. The collections made by the United States to illustrate the animal
and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of the native
races of the country, on the occasion of the International Exhibition at
Philadelphia in 1876, and the fishery collections disp]ayed by the United
States at the International Fisheries Exhibition at Berlin in 1880 and
at London in 1883,

8. The collections given by the Governments of the several foreign
nations, thirty in number, which participated in the exhibition at eRe
- delphia in 1876.

9. The industrial collections given by numerous manufacturing and
commercial houses of Europe and America, at the time of the Philadel-
phia Exhibition and subsequently.

10. The material received, in exchange for duplicate specimens, from
the museums in Europe and America, at the time of the Philadelphia
Exhibition and subsequently.

In connection with the general work of administration there is in the
Museum a library, a chemical laboratory, a photographic establishment,
and various workshops for taxidermy, modeling, and for the ida
tion of skeletons for exhibition. In connection with the department
of art and industry two preparators are constantly employed.

The publications of the Museum consist of (1) The Annual Report;
(2) The Proceedings of the United States National Museum; (3) The
Bulletin of the United States National Museum; (4) The series of circu-
lars. These have, in part, been reprinted in the volumes of the Smith-
sonian Miscellaneous Collections,

C.—SPECIAL TOPICS OF THE YEAR.

THE CINCINNATI EXHIBITION.

By act of Congress, approved May 28, 1888,* the Smithsonian Institu-
tion was directed to participate in the Centennial Exposition of the
Ohio Valley and Central States, and the latter months of the fiscal year
have been devoted by the curators to the preparation of special exhib-
its. The fourth of July has been announced as the date of opening the
exhibition. Very little time, therefore, remains for the completion of
this work.

THE PROPOSED STATUE TO PROFESSOR BAIRD.

On December 12, 1887, a billt was introduced into the Senate by Sen-
ator Morrill, appropriating $15,000 for the erection of a bronze statue
of Professor Baird, the late Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
This bill passed the Senate on February 9, but failed to come up for
action in the House of Representatives.

THE CAPRON COLLECTION.

For a number of years the collection of lacquers, bronzes, carved ivo-
ries, coins, and other works of art, obtained in Japan by the late Gen-
eral Horace Capron, has been deposited in the National Museum. It is
the property of his heirs, who are desirous of selling it to the Govern-
ment. On December 21, 1887, a billi providing for its purchase was in-
troduced into the Senate by Hon. Daniel Voorhees, of Indiana. This
bill was favorably acted upon in the Senate, but did not come to a vote
in the House of Representatives.

INCREASING GROWTH OF THE COLLECTIONS.

During the last three years (since the adoption of the standard of the
fiscal year by the Smithsonian Institution) the number of accession
“lots” received has been 4,623, including nearly five hundred and
twenty thousand specimens. ‘The last accession number in June, 1888,
was 20831.

REARRANGEMEMENT OF THE EXHIBITION HALLS.

The appearance of the exhibition halls has been, it is thought, very
much improved during the year. Some new methods of installation
have been successfully inaugurated in some of the departments. Sev-
eral new forms of cases have also been adopted. The co-operation of the

tion of Oriental Antiquities. Other new sections have been organized.

TRANSFER OF DISBURSEMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF THE
INTERIOR.

The rapid growth of the Museum for several years past has shown it
to be desirable that the direct administration of the Museum appropria-
tions should be transferred from the Department of the Interior to the
hands of the Smithsonian Institution, the legal custodian of the Museum
and its collections. This matter was fully discussed at the last annual
meeting of the Board of Regents, and a conference between the Chan-
cellor of the Smithsonian Institution, the Secretary of the Interior, and
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution was held on February 13.
Some correspondence followed between the Secretary of the Interior
and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in which the former
consented to the proposed transfer. This correspondence is published
in the report of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to the
Board of Regents for this year. *

A letter was then addressed to the chairman of the House Committee
on Appropriations,* setting forth the facts in the case, and the changes
proposed. These were indicated in the sundry civil bill, and, ifapproved
by Congress, the disbursement of money appropriated for the National
Museum will hereafter be made by an officer designated by the Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution.

THE COLLECTION OF LIVING ANIMALS.

Early in the year preparations were made for the establishment of a
department of living animals inthe Museum, inorder to afford to the tax-
idermists an opportunity of observing the habits and positions of the
various species, with a view to using the knowledge thus acquired in
the mounting of skins for the exhibition series of mammals. Active
work in this department commenced in October. Mr. Willliam T.
Hornaday was appointed curator.

The U.S. Fish Commission kindly tendered the use of one a its
special cars then about to be sent to the far west, for the transporta-
tion of living animals to Washington, and Mr. Hornaday visited several
of the northwestern States and Territories. The expedition was very
successful, and a large number of deer, bears, foxes, lynxes, eagles, and
other animals were obtained as a nucleus for the collection.

D.—THE CONDITION OF THE COLLECTIONS.
INCREASE OF THE COLLECTIONS.

Since the erection of the present Museum building in 1881 there have
been more than 12,000 accessions to the collections, chiefly by gift.
From 1859 to 1880 the accessions numbered 8,475. It is thus evident

* Pages 8-11. * Page 8, ibid.

~
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. yal

that during the last eight years the number of accessions has been half
as large again aS during the previous twenty-one years. Many of the
more recent ones are of very great extent. Among these may be men-
tioned the bequest of the late Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, which con-
tains 20,000 specimens of shells, besides minerals and otier objects ;
the Jeftreys collection of fossil and recent shells of Europe, including
40,000 specimens; the Stearnscollection of mollusks, numbering 100,000
specimens ; the Riley collection of insects containing 150,000 specimens ;
the Catlin collection of Indian paintings, about 500 in number ; the collec-
tion of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the transporta-
tion of which to Washington several freight-cars were required.

There are also the extensive collections obtained at the Fisheries Hx-
hibitions at Berlin and London and at the close of the New Orleans
Cotton Centennial; the Shepard collection of meteorites; the Wilson
collection of archeological objects (more than 12,000 specimens); the
Lorillard collection of Central American antiquities, and very many
others nearly as extensive. In addition to these are the annual accre-
tions from the work of the U. S. Fish Commission, the U. 8. Geological
Survey, and the Bureau of Ethnology, as wellas the contributions from
Several expeditions of the Government, from Army and Navy officers,
and from other Government officials. These have been very extensive,
and are yearly increasing in bulk and value.

The accessions during the year are 1,481 in number (19351-20831).
These consist, in the aggregate, of more than 137,000 specimens. A
table showing approximately the number of specimens in the Museum
in 1882 and received each year since is given in the next paragraph, de-
voted to the census of the collections.

CENSUS OF THE COLLECTIONS.

One of the most striking features in connection with the afiairs of the
Museum is the remarkable increase in the extent of its collections. This
increase is in a large degree spontaneous, only a very small sum of money
being available for the purchase of new material. As might be supposed,
a considerable proportion of the objects given duplicate material already
on hand, and although these contributions can with the utmost advan-
tage be used for distribution to other museums and schools, they do
not increase, as much as is desired, the value of the collections fer
etudy by specialists and for general educational purposes. The need
of a larger fund for the purchase of specimens is yearly more manifest.
Exceedingly important material is constantly offered to us at prices
very much below what it would cost to obtain it by collecting, and, in
many instances, when refused, it is eagerly taken by the museums and
institutions of Europe. The extent and character of the recent addi-
tions to the collections may, perhaps, be better shown by the appended
table than in any other way. This table shows comparatively the re-
‘sults of a census of the collections taken annually for the past six
years, and from it it appears that the number of specimens, or of lots of

specimens, on hand at the close of the year is more than 2,800,000,
These figures are in many instances estimated, and are always subject

to revision.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY 23

it will be seen from this table that the number of specimens at the
close of 1882 was approximately 193,362, and that this total has been 1n-
creased during the next five and a half years to nearly 3,000,000. In
other words, for twenty-two years (1859-1881) the average number of
specimens received annually was less than 8,800; while during the last
five years anda halfthe average number of specimens received annually
has been nearly 475,000.

CATALOGUE ENTRIES.

The cataloguing of specimens is attended to by the curators of the
several departments in the Museum. Each department has its book or
set of books for this purpose, and until the’catalogue entry has been
made, the routine of recording the receipt of specimens is not complete.
A catalogue entry may relate to a single specimen or toa large number
of specimens, as, for instance, frequently happens in connection with
marine invertebrates, insects, fossils, and other groups of objects. The
number of catalogue entries during the year is, therefore, no indication

24 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, i888.
INSTALLATION OF COLLECTIONS AND ASSIGNMENT OF SPACE.

Several attractive additions to the exhibition series in the Museum
have been made during the past year, and the general appearance of
the exhibition halls is now very satisfactory. An interesting contri-
bution, consisting of a series of India proofs, from the Bureau of En-
graving and Printing, has been received. On these are exhibited the
backs and faces of all the current bonds and currency notes issued by
the United States, illustrating each denomination of Treasury notes,
gold and silver certificates, from $1 to $10,000, and coupon and regis-
tered bonds from $10 to $50,000. To the collection of historical relies
has been added an object of rare interest. This is one of the thirteen
pamphlets signed by George Washington, John Adams, and colonial
delegates, entitled “Original Association of Congress, October 20, 1774”.
By this association the delegates pledged the colonies not to import
British merchandise after December 1, 1774. The pamphlet consists of
nine printed pages, more than two of which are devoted to the auto-
graph signatures of the delegates. During the year the Smithsonian
Institution has placed in the Museum its collection of portraits of scien-
tific and literary men and other prominent personages. ‘This series in-
cludes nearly 2,500 photographs, and is exceedingly valuable as a nu-
cleus for a national gallery of portraits of representative men. The
entire collection of materia medica has during the year been removed
from the west north range of the Museum to the east-south range, and
this transfer has made necessary a rearrangement of the collection.
As mentioned in the report of Mr. True, curator of mammals, the idea
of representing the more important mammals of North America by
groups, accompanied by accessories indicative of the habits and natural
surroundings of the species, which had been for some time under con-
sideration, has been partly carried into execution, five groups having
been placed in the exhibition hall, one of which, a group of bisons, is
undoubtedly the finest work of its kind in the world. Work has been
continued in the installation of the ethnological collection in the east
and west halls. It has been impossible to make very rapid progress in
the systematic rearrangement of the exhibition series of birds, but a
satisfactory beginning in that direction has been made. The removal
of the collection of reptiles and fishes from the west end of the Smith-
sonian Institution has been necessitated, in order that that portion of
the building might be made fire-proof. This work having been com-
pleted, much time was spent in replacing these collections. An exhi-
bition series of fishes has been installed in the west hall of the Smith-
sonian building. The collection of reptiles is still without exhibition
space. The mollusk collection in the Museum is now in some respects,
Superior to any in the world. Important additions are constantly being
made to it, and the work of installing an exhibition series of specimens
is progressing steadily. The Department of Insects has placed on ex-
2

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 25

hibition a series of Coleoptera. Numerous additions to the exhibition
series of osteological material have been made. The mineralogical col-
lection has steadily increased, and additions have been made to the ex-
hibition series of meteorites and to the gem collection. The eases con-
taining the exhibition material of this department are very attractive
and excite much interest on the partof visitors. More than two months
were spent by the curator of lithology and his assistants in rearranging
the exhibition material belonging tothe department. The arrangement
decided upon was such that the moving of nearly every specimen in the
hall was made necessary. Since this rearrangement many important
additions to the series have been made. A change in the space occu-
pied by the Department of Metallurgy was made early in the year, the
whole of the southwest court being assigned to the department, and the
time and energy of the curator and his assistants, during the greater
part of the year, have been devoted to the work of rearranging the
exhibition material.

The Department of Living Animals, recently organized, has created
wide interest. Many interesting specimens have already been obtained.
The most important of these is a pair of buffaloes, presented by Hon. EB.
G. Blackford, of New York City.

Several important changes have been made in the assignment of space
in the exhibition halls. The collection of modern ceramics and several
special collections, such as the Capron collection of Japanese objects
and the Hippisley collection of Chinese porcelains, have been placed on
the west side of the north hall. A wall case, extending along the en-
tire west side of the north hall, is devoted to collections representing
the races of men and their domestic life. The scope of the collection
belonging to the section of steam transportation has been enlarged to
include transportation generally, and also to embrace the subject of
engineering. The space assigned to these collections is the eastern end
of the éast hall.

The collections of prehistoric anthropology, of marine invertebrates,
of fishes, of mollusks, and of reptiles are still retained in the Smithso-
nian building.

The north end of the west hall, from which the collection of modern
pottery has been removed, is devoted to the section of Oriental Antiqui-
ties. Thecollection of metallurgy, including that portion of it which
occupies the west end of the west hall, has been removed to the south-
west court, the collection of minerals having been transferred to the
southwest range in lieu of the metallurgical collection. In the south-
east court, space has been assigned to the vertebrate and invertebrate
fossil collections and to the Department of Botany.

E.—THE MUSEUM STAFF.

The staff of the Museum includes two classes—scientifie and adminis-

trative—the former consisting of curators, honorary curators, acting

- curators, assistant curators, assistants and aids; the latter including the

financial and elerical force, and the superintendent of buildings with
the watchmen, mechanies, and laborers under his supervision.

THE SCIENTIFIC STAFF.

There are now in the Museum thirty-one organized departments and
sections under the care of twenty-seven curators and assistant curators.
Of these custodians, ten receive salaries from the Museum appropria-
tions. Of the remaining seventeen, four are detailed from the U.S.
Fish Commission, two from the U.S. Army, one from the U.S. Navy,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. PA

five from the U. S. Geological Survey, and one from the Bureau of Eth-
nology.

Dr. Charles Rau, for many years in charge of the archeological col-
lection in the Museum, died on June 25, 1887. He was in 1881 appointed
curator of the Department of Antiquities in the National Museum. His
health gave way in 1836, and in July, 1887, he went to the hospital of
the University of Pennsylvania, where he died. His body was brought
to Washington, and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery. Dr. Rau has
been succeeded by Mr. Thomas Wilson, who recived his appointment
as honorary curator on December 1. In November Dr. H. G. Beyer,
U.S. Navy, honorary curator of the Section of Materia Medica, was
ordered to other duties, and Dr. James M. Flint, the first curator of
this collection, has again taken charge. The Museum has commenced
the formation of a collection of casts of Assyrian and Babylonian an-
tiquities in association with the Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Paul
Haupt, professor of Semitic languages in the Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, was in February appointed: honorary curator, Dr. Cyrus Adler,
of the same university, consenting to act as honorary assistant curator.
The Section of Transportation, under the care of Mr. J. E. Watkins,
has now reached that point in its history where it may take rank with
the other sections of the Department of Arts and Industries. On May
9 the Department of Living Animals was organized, with Mr. W. T.
Hornaday, chief taxidermist, as curator. On June 8 Charles Wickliffe
Beckham, formerly an assistant in the Department of Birds, died. He
made several valuable contributions to American ornithological liter-
_ ature.

In other respects the personnel of the scientific departments in the
Museum remains the same as in 1887, as shown in the following classi-
fied list:

THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF.

There have been no important changes in the administrative corps
during the year.

Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk, acted as representative of the Smithson-
ian Institution at the Minneapolis Industrial Exposition.

F.—REVIEW OF WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENTS.

The energies of several of the curators have been devoted during the
greater part of the year to the preparation of exhibits for the Cincin-
nati Exposition. A report upon the participation of the Smithsonian
Institution in this exposition, including statements in regard to the
several exhibits, will be published in the report for 1889. This work
has seriously interferéd with the regular Museum duties of the curators,
and has consequently diminished the amount of original research in the
scientific departments of the Museum. 1t is a matter of regret that so
few of the special collections in the Department of Arts and Industries
have been formally reported upon this year. In many cases the cura-
tors of these collections are performing this work in an honorary ca-
pacity, and are compelled to devote the greater part of their time to the
accomplishment of work connected with their official duties. Following
the custom adopted in previous reports, I have briefly reviewed the
work of each department separately.

* Honorary.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 29
ARTS AND INDUSTRIES.

The organization of a new section of this department has been ar-
ranged. Dr. Paul Haupt, of Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, has
been appointed honorary curator of the collection of Oriental Antiquities,
with Dr. Cyrus Adler, of the same university, as honorary assistant
curator.

In connection with this arrangement the following circular, which
has been approved by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, has
been published by the Johns Hopkins University :

Memorandum of the understanding between the National Museum and the Johns Hopkins
: University.

The National Museum at Washington has undertaken the formations of study col-
lections of casts of Assyrian and Babylonian antiquities in assoviation with the Johns
Hopkins University of Baltimore. The two institutions will co-operate for this pur-
pose, upon the following basis:

Ist. The Museum stands ready to make fac-similes and casts of Assyrian and Baby-
lonian antiquities.

2d. The attempt will first be made to obtain copies of the Assyrian antiquities pre-
served in this country.

3d. For the present the Museum will confine itself to the reproduction, in fac-simile
and flat casts, of Assyrian and Babylonian seal cylinders.

4th. The Johus Hopkins University will attend to the proper arrangement and
cataloguing of the Assyrian collection in the National Museum, under the supervision
of Dr. Haupt, professor of Semitic languages, and Dr. Adler, assistant in the Semitic
courses, who will also co-operate in the work of forming the collection and securing
the loan of objects to be copied.

5th. Three sets of fac-similes and casts will be made in each case: the first to be
preserved in the National Museum at Washington; the second to be transferred to
the Semitic library of Johns Hopkins University, at Baltimore; and the third to be
presented to the owners of the objects loaned.

Numerous and valuable additions have been made to the collection
of graphic arts, under the energetic curatorship of Mr. 8S. R. Koehler.
An interesting exhibit of illustrations of engraving, etching, and of the
photo-mechanical processes, has been prepared by Mr. Koehler for the
Cincinnati Exposition. <A catalogue of this collection has been pub-
lished in the appendix to the tenth volume of the Proceedings U.S.
National Museum.* After the close of the Exposition the collection
will be permanently installed in the National Museum.

The collection of Materia Medica is now under the care of the former
honorary curator, Dr. James M. Flint, U. 8. Navy, Dr. H. G. Beyer, U.
S. Navy, having been ordered to other duty by the Navy Department.
A collection of Corean drugs has been purchased, and is of much im-
portance in completing the series of drugs from that country. The en-
tire collection is now installed in the east-south range. During the
year 246 specimens have been added to the collection.

The collection of historical and personai relies, under the care of Mr. A.
H. Clark, has received some interesting additions, among which is the war
saddle of General Grant, deposited by General A. H. Markland. From

Mr. Stephen Vail has been received a piece of the original wire over

*Pp. 701-731.

30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

which a message was sent in 1840 during the experiments of Professor
Morse.

The War Department has-transferred to the National Museum sev-
eral interesting relics, including a large section of an oak tree riddled
with bullets from the battle-field at Appomattox Court-House. The
original piaster model of the bronze statue of George Washington, de-
signed by William Rudolf O’Donovan, has been received. A pair of
silver-mounted flint-lock pistols, once the property of General Lafay-
ette, has been deposited by Mr. William Burnett. The Smithsonian
Institution has transferred to the Museum its collection of portraits of
American and foreign men of science and of persons prominent in politi-
eal and civil life. The Museum had aiready accumulated engraved and
photographie portraits, and plans are now being arranged for the for-
mation of a comprehensive collection, in which especial attention will
be given to the representative men of America.

The collection of coins, medals, and paper money has been gradually
increased. <A series of proofs of all the current bonds and currency
notes issued by the United States, and of gold and silver certificates,
coupons, and registered bonds, has, through the courtesy of Hon. E. O.
Graves, been presented by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

During the year, 1,006 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 552 entries have been made in the catalogue.

ETHNOLOGY.

Prof. Otis T. Mason, curator, has pushed forward work in connection
with the ethnological series, the object of which is to show representa-
tives of all the races of men. The arrangement of the Eskimo col-
lection, which was commenced last year by Lieut. 'T. Dix Bolles, U.S.
Navy, has been completed. The curator is arranging for comparison
the bows and arrows from all parts of the world, with a view to prepar-
ing an extensive monograph upon the subject. Prof. G. Stanley Hall
investigated the subject of mythology from the psycho-physical point
of view, and was accorded the use of the ethnological collections of the
Museum. An exceedingly valuable collection of objects from Easter
Island has been placed in the Museum by Paymaster W. J. Thomson,
U.S. Navy.

It is the intention of the curator to prepare each year for publication
in the Museum report one or more papers relating to special collections
illustrating the arts and industries of the North American Indians. In
the report for 1884, two papers were published, on Throwing-sticks and
on Basket-work of the North American Aborigines. In the report for
1887 were two papers by Professor Mason on Cradles of the American
Aborigines and the Human Beast of Burden.

During the year, 1,700 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 790 entries have been made 1n the catalogue.
- REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ol
AMERICAN ABORIGINAL POTTERY.

Mr. W. H. Holmes, honorary curator, has made a study of the origin
and significance of the textile ornament upon the pottery of the east-
ern United States, and of the relation between the ancient and recent
ceramic remains of northern New Mexico. The work: of cataloguing
and installing the immense collection of prehistoric pottery has prac-
tically been completed. Four collections of considerable importance
have been received during the year: from Col. James Stevenson, of the
Bureau of Ethnology, from Mr. James Mooney, from Mr. J. A. MeNiel,
and trom Rev. Ward Batchelor, respectively.

During the year 1,100 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 1,541 entries have been made in the catalogue, including the re-
cording of collections which had been previously received.

PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY.

The curatorship of this department became vacant in July by the
death of Dr. Charles Rau, and on December 1, 1887, Mr. Thomas Wil-
son was appointed curator. Mr. Wilson had been consul of the United
States in Belgium and France, and had profited by his opportunities for
the study of prehistoric anthropology in the localities in those countries
which had become renowned for their bearings upon this science. He
had while there made a collection of objects connected with prehistoric
anthropology in Europe, amounting in number to 10,288 specimens,
which he has deposited in the National Museum, and of which mention
is made in the last annual report.

Dr. Rau bequeathed to the library 715 bound volumes and 1,722 un-
bound books and pamphlets. He also gave 89 modern Indian objects,
474 of European prehistoric objects, and 1,367 American prehistoric
objects, to the ethnographical and archeological collections in the Mu-
seum.

The special work of the curator during the year has consisted in gath-
ering information concerning the existence and geographic distribution
of paleolithic implements in the United States, it being the curator’s
desire to assist in the solution of the problem relating to the existence
of man on the American continent, especially in the United States, dur-
jng the paleolithic period of the stone age. In this connection a circu-
lar (No. 36) was prepared by the Smithsonian Institution for distribu-
tion among persons interested in archeological matters. Several hun-
dred replies were received. From these has been compiled a paper, in-
eluding a discussion of the correspondence upon this subject and of de-
ductions made therefrom, which is published in Section m1 of this Re-
port.

During the year 6,972 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 2,696 entries have been made in the catalogue.
32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888,
MAMMALS,

The chief feature of the year’s work in the Department of Mammals
has been the rearrangement of the exhibition series in new cases, and
considerable progress has been made. Mr. True, curator, reports that
there has been received a smaller number of donations than in previous
years, but that some excellent material has been obtained by purchase
and exchange. <A valuable series of deer-skins from Honduras was eol-
lected by Mr. Charles H. Townsend. A fine male Harnessed Antelope
was presented by the Zoological Society of Philadelphia. Nearly sixty
specimens have been mounted by the taxidermists.

During the year 247 specimens (skins and aleoholies) have been added
to the collection, and 337 entries have been made in the catalogue.

BIRDS.

Mr. Robert Ridgway, curator, has prepared a review of the Mexican
and Central American members of six families. Collections of birds
from the Lower Amazon and from islands in the Caribbean Sea and on
the coast of Honduras have been determined. The curator has written
a monograph of the genera Dendrocincla and Psittacula.

Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, assistant curator, has continued his studies
of the Japanese collection of birds belonging to the Museum, and has
investigated several groups of European birds. He has aiso reported
upon two collections of birds from the Hawaiian Islands.

For more than two months the time of the curator and his assistants
was devoted to the preparation of an exhibit for the Cincinnati Exposi-
tion.

Both the exhibition and study series of this department have steadily
improved during the year, and progress is being rapidly made in the
systematic arrangement and classification of the immense amount of
material which has been received both during this and previous years.

The curator of birds has called special attention to the fact that sev-
eral species of North American birds are fast becoming extinet, and has
emphasized the desirability of obtaining additional specimens of these
species before it is too late. These species are: Great Auk, Plautus
impinnis ; Labrador Duck, Camptolaimus labradorius ; Heath Hen, Tym-
panuchus cupido; Passenger Pigeon, Ectopistes migratorius ; California
Vulture, Pseudogryphus californianus ; Carolina Paroquet, Conurus car-
olinensis ; and Ivory-billed Woodpecker, Campephilus prineipalis.

The first of these, the Great Auk, is now believed to be entirely ex-
tinct.

No specimens of the Labrador Duck have been taken since April,
1871. Formerly specimens were occasionally taken about Grand Manan
Island, near Hastport, Maine.

Until within the last two or three years specimens of the Heath Hen
were occasionally found on Martha’s Vineyard and on the island of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. on

Naushon. Mr. William Brewster thinks that its extinction is due to
the numerous foxes found on those islands.

The Passenger Pigeon is still found in small numbers, but it is thought
that it will not be many years before this species will be entirely ex-
tinct.

The California Vulture is becoming rarer each year. Large numbers
of these birds have been destroyed by eating poisoned meat intended
for other animals.

The Carolina Paroquet is being rapidly destroyed for its plumage,
and few specimens are now left. Whole flocks can be killed easily, since,
when one has been wounded, the remainder will stay by it and can not
be frightened away.

_ The Ivory-billed Woodpecker is rapidly diminishing in numbers. No
special reason has been assigned for its decrease.

Capt. Charles E. Bendire, curator of birds’ eggs, has added to the
above list the name of Pallas’s Cormorant, Phalacrocorax perspicillatus.
This species became extinct about thirty-five years ago on the Com-
mander Islands. It is especially desirable to retain specimens of this
bird, since only three skins have been preserved. It is believed that
no skeleton or egg of this bird exists in any collection. This is a very
fine bird, the largest of its family, and is provided with a lustrous plu-
mage of burnished green and purple.

In June, 1888, the Museum lost by death the services of Charles
Wickliffe Beckham. During his brief connection with the Museum
Mr. Beckham proved himself to be an intelligent and valuable assistant.

During the year 1,497 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 2,206 entries have been made in the catalogue.

BIRDS’ EGGS.

Capt. Charles EH. Bendire, U. S. Army, honorary curator, has contin-
ued the work of measuring, numbering, and rearranging the collection,
and 1,778 specimens have been thus disposed of during the year. The
relabeling of the reserve series, in accordance with the nomenclature
adopted by the American Ornithologists’ Union, has also been com-
menced.

The principal contributions during the year have been received from
_ Lieut. H. C. Benson, U. S. Army, Dr. J. C. Merrill, U.S. Army, Dr. A.
K. Fisher, and Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of the Department of Agriculture ;
Mr. F. Stephens, of San Bernardino, California, and Col. N. G. Goss, of
‘Topeka, Kansas.

During the year 1,882 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 487 entries have been made in the catalogue.

REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS.

The operations of this department have been seriously interrupted by
the necessity of making some repairs in the west basement of the Smith-

H. Mis. 142, pt. 2——3
34 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

sonian building. This work lasted for several months. The entire re-
serve series has been transferred from the laboratory of the department
to store-rooms. After the repairs had been completed, the collection
was again transferred toits former position. This series has, to a great
extent, been relabeled and systematically arranged.

Studies upon the Batrachia in the Museum have been continued by
Prof. E. D. Cope, of Philadelphia.

The curator, Dr. H. C. Yarrow, has investigated the subject of rattle-
snake venom, with a view to determining its action upon animals, and
numerous experiments have been made with so-called antidotes for the
venom. A popular account of these experiments was published in
‘‘ Forest and Stream,” in May and June, 1888, and a final statement of
the results of his investigations will be published in a future report of
the Museum.

During the year 122 specimens have been added to the collection, and
83 entries have been made in the catalogue.

FISHES.

Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, honorary curator, was directed by the U.S.
Commissioner of Fisheries to investigate the fishes of Great Egg Har-
bor Bay, New Jersey, and in July, 1887, left Washington for that pur-
pose. The results of this investigation have been embodied in a paper
prepared by him for publication.

Great disorder to the collection has been caused by the necessary re-
moval of the exhibition series of fishes from the hall during the fire-proof-
ing of the west end of the Smithsonian building. Immediately after
the completion of this work the collections were returned to their places.

In 1888 Dr. Bean was ordered by the U.S. Commissioner of Fisheries
to join the U.S. Fish Commission schooner Grampus for the purpose of
investigating the southern mackerel fishery, and this cruise occupied
his time during May and June, 1888.

The growth of the collection in this department during the year
has been very satisfactory. Special work was accomplished on collec-
tions received from Ensign W. E. Safford, U. S. Navy, C. H. Townsend,
and Senor Don José Arechavaleta. A small collection of fishes from
Honduras was received from Mr. C. H. Townsend and reported upon.
The collections of fishes made by the U.S. Fish Commission steamer
Albatross and the U.S. Fish Commission schooner Grampus have been
catalogued and preserved. Types of several new species have been ob-
tained, and descriptions of these have been prepared for publication in
the Proceedings of the National Museum. The curator states in his
report that 62 accessions have been received, representing nearly every
State and Territory.

During the year 1,350 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 450 entries have been made in the catalogue,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 35
MOLLUSKS.

A large portion of the time of the curator and his corps of assist-
ants has been spent in unpacking, labeling, and repacking the large
and valuable coilection of mollusks bequeathed to the Smithsonian In-
stitution by the late Dr. Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia. This collection .
includes about 20,000 specimens, and a description of it will be found
in the report of Mr: William H. Dall, honorary curator.

Special investigations have been made in connection with the deep-
sea mollusks collected by the steamers Blake and Albatross on the east-
ern coast of the United States and among the Antilles. A study of the
fauna of the Miocene Silex beds of Tampa Bay has been made. Mr. Dall
has also found time to study the relations of the members of the Tertiary
mollusk fauna with the recent species of the coast.

The condition of the collection is now very satisfactory, and the curator
estimates that during the year 30,000 additional specimens have been
added.

Dr. BR. B. C. Stearns, adjunct curator, has devoted his time to arrang-
ing, classifying, and labeling the collections, and, in addition to the
routine work of the department, has prepared for publication several
papers based upon museum material. A list of these papers will be
found in Section Iv of this report.

During the year at least 30,000 specimens have been added to the
collection, and 11,799 entries (including Cenozoic fossils) have been made
in the catalogue books.

INSECTS.

Considerable progress has been made in connection with the arrange-
ment of material in the Department of Insects during the year. Owing
to lack of room it has not been possible to properly expand and arrange
the collections, and additional space is urgently needed. THarly in the
year the arrangement of Coleoptera and of the large Bombycid Lepi-
doptera was commenced. Studies were made of some of the genera of
the Noctuide. The annotative and critical overhauling of the Glover
plates, with the view of possibly preparing them for publication, occu-
pied a large part of the first half of the year.

Requests sent to this department for the determination of material
have been very numerous, and much time has been consumed in identi-
fying specimens. The questions submitted as to the life habits, methods
of collecting, and determination of insects, often require considerable
research. Prof.C. V. Riley, honorary curator, states in his report that
not less than one hundred and fifty letters, reporting names and habits
of specimens sent for determination, were written during the year. The
number of accessions received was not as large as last year, but their
value is fully equal to that of the accessions of the previous year. The
preservation of the material in this department requires great care, and
much time is required to protect these specimens from museum pests,
36 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The curator has visited Europe during the year, and consulted a number
of correspondents and specialists in reference to entomological work in
other museums.

Mr. J. B. Smith, assistant curator, has, in addition to performing the
routine work of the department, prepared for publication a number of
entomological papers, a list of which will be found in Section tv of this
Report. Several important investigations have been conducted during
the year by the curator, assistant curator, and co-workers of the de-
partment.

During the year about 10,000 specimens have been added to the col-
lection, and 56 entries have been made in the catalogue.

MARINE INVERTEBRATES.

In consequence of increased duties in connection with the work of
the U.S. Fish Commission, Mr. Rathbun, honorary curator of this de-
partment, has been unable to devote as much time as in previous years
to museum work. The repairs which have been made in the west por-
tion of the Smithsonian building have interfered seriously with the rou-
tine work of this department. The investigations of the curator have
related chiefly to subjects bearing more or less directly on problems
connected with the work of the U. 8. Fish Commission. Seventeen of
the thirty-three accessions received during the year were contributed
by or through the medium of the U.S. Fish Commission. The current
work of the department has been kept up and all the accessions of the
year have been properly cared for.

A large number of duplicate sets of specimens of marine invertebrates
have been distributed during the year to various schools and universi-
ties. This material has been courteously placed atethe disposal of the
Smithsonian Institution for this purpose by the U.S. Commissioner of
Fisheries. As in former years this department has received the benefit
of the co-operation of many eminent specialists, and members of the sci-
entific staff in the service of the U. 8. Fish Commission have rendered
very valuable assistance in their special lines of study. :

During the year about 65,000 specimens have been added to the col-
lection, and 1,021 entries have been made in the catalogue.

COMPARATIVE ANATOMY.

No special investigations have been made in connection with the ma-
terial in this department, the work of research having been necessarily
subordinated to that of identifying, cataloguing, and preserving the
specimens received during the year.

The total number of specimens received during the year is 536, in-
cluding skulls, and skeletons of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes.
One of the most important accessions is a series of bones of the extinct
Dodo, received from Cambridge, England.

The work of labeling the exhibition series has made progress.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 37
PALEOZOIC INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS.

The principal work of the year in the department of paleozoic fossils
has been the preparation by Mr. C. D. Walcott, honorary curator, of a
representative series of fossils from each of the larger divisions of the
Paleozoic strata. The series, comprising 10,955 specimens, is now on
exhibition, and has been provided with labels.

The curator was absent from the city seven months of the year in con-
nection with the work of the U. S. Geological Survey. During the re-
mainder of the year he devoted a large portion of his time to the prep-
aration of a paper on “ The Taconic System of Emmons, and the use of
the name Taconic in Geologic Nomenclature.”

During the year 158 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 350 entries have been made in the catalogue.

MESOZOIC INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS.

Dr. C. A. White, honorary curator, states in his annual report that it

has been necessary to devote the greater part of his time to the paleon-
tological work of the U. 8. Geological Survey. A great deal has been
accomplished, however, in the identification of material sent for exami-
nation and in replying to letters addressed to the Museum asking for
information upon paleontological subjects.
_ The most important accession of the year has been the Lea collection
of fossils, forming a part of the extensive collections bequeathed by the
late Dr. Isaac Lea to the Smithsonian Institution. A card catalogue
of the collection has been made. No specimens have yet been placed
upon exhibition, although a series of specimens representing the Meso-
zoiec formation of North America is ready for exhibition as soon as cases
shall have been provided. Some important papers have been published
during the year by the curator. These are referred to in Section Iv
(Bibliography) of this Report.

During the year 150 specimens have been added to the collection, and
30 entries have been made in the catalogue.

FOSSIL AND RECENT PLANTS.

Almost the entire time of Mr. Lester F. Ward, honorary curator, has
been devoted to his work as an officer of the U. S. Geological Survey.
Considerable progress has been made by Prof. Leo Lesquereux, of
Columbus, Ohio, in the identification of material collected in Oregon
by Capt. Charles E. Bendire. Professor Lesquereux’s report was edited
and prepared for publication in the Proceedings of the U.S. National
Museum by Mr. F. H. Knowlton, assistant curator of this department.

Mr. Knowlton continued his studies on the internal structure of fossil
plants and reached some interesting results. He also made an exami-
nation of fossil wood collected in the Yellowstone National Park.

In July, 1887, the curator, accompanied by the assistant curator, left
Washington on an expedition to the Yellowstone National Park, the
38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

primary object of this expedition being to collect fossil plants in this
region. About 25 species of mosses and 300 species of flowering plants
were also obtained.

During the past two years a special study of the flora of the District
of Columbia has been made, one of the results of which is that there
are now in the herbarium about 1,000 species of plants from this locality.
The curator states that several valuable accessions have been received,
the principal one being the collection made by Edward Palmer, in
Mexico. This contains 768 species. Second in size, but none the less
valuable, is the Mexican collection made by C. G. Pringle.

The routine work of the department has been well attended to, and
the present state of the collection is very satisfactory.

During the year 1,538 specimens of fossil plants have been added to
the collection, and 19 entries have been made in the catalogue. There
have also been received 6,000 specimens of recent plants. These have
been catalogued under 347 numbers.

MINERALS.

Prof. F. W. Clarke, honorary curator, reports that gifts of minerals
have been received from many sources, and that valuable additions
have been made to the collections of meteorites and gems.

A collection of gems and precious stones was prepared for exhibition
at the Cincinnati Exposition, and some valuable additional specimens
were obtained.

The largest accession of the year is the collection bequeathed by the
late Dr. Isaac Lea. The U.S. Geological Survey has, as usual, made
large and valuable contributions to the collection, especially important
being the minerals collected by officers of the Survey at Denver, Colo-
rado.

The greater part of the routine work of the department has been car-
ried on by Mr. William H. Yeates, assistant curator, who has devoted
much time to cataloguing and labeling.

During the year 3,295 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 347 entries have been made in the catalogue.

LITHOLOGY AND PHYSICAL GEOLOGY.

The curator, Mr. George P. Merrill, has devoted the greater part of
his time to the preparation of the exhibition, study, and duplicate series.
He has also completed the manuscript for a hand-book of the building-
stone collection. This contains not only a catalogue of the Museum
collection, but also a description of the principal quarries in the United
States, information in regard to the structure and composition of rocks,
methods of quarrying, results of pressure tests, and other associated
subjects.

During the year the storage material belonging to this department
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 39

has been thoroughly overhauled, with a view to eliminating all worth-
less specimens.

The preparation of sets of duplicate material has been commenced,
in order to meet the requests of educational institutions for collections
of this kind.

Special researches have been made upon the Montville serpentine
and the peridotite from Little Deer Island on the coast of Maine, and
upon a new meteorite from California. Papers relating to these speci-
mens have been prepared for publication in the Proceedings of the
National Museum.

The curator has paid especial attention to the stratigraphic, struct-
ural, and dynamical geology exhibition series, and many important
additions have been made during the year. In the annual report of
this department, seventeen accessions are mentioned as of especial im-
portance, among which are a large collection ofseruptive rocks, miner-
als, veins, and joint formations collected by the curator in New Jersey,
Rhode Island, Massazhusetts, and Maine, and an interesting series of
Devonian marbles and eruptive rocks sent in exchange by Mr. RB. N.
Worth, curator of petrology in the Plymouth Institute at Plymouth,
England. Valuable contributions have also been received from officers
of the U. S. Geological Survey.

During the year, 1,000 specimens have been received.

METALLURGY.

The energies of the curator, Mr. F. P. Dewey, and his assistants,
have been devoted during the year to work incident to the change in
the location of the exhibition space of the department. A complete
reorganization of the geographical series of ores has been effected, and
some changes have been made in the systematic collections in economic
geology and metallurgy. The curator has prosecuted special researches
jn regard to the perfecting of the Hampe method of determining sub-
oxide of copper in metallic copper, in order to carry on a further inves-
tigation upon the refining of pig-copper. He has also made a complete
chemical examination of the large collection from the Lone Elm Smelt-
ing Works at Joplin, Missouri. To accomplish this it was necessary to
make sixteen chemical analyses.

During the year, 101 accessions were received. Of this number, 72
consisted of specimens sent for examination and report. Two impor-
tant collections were contributed by the U. 8S. Geological Survey. One
of these was collected by Mr. J. S. Curtis in connection with the
preparation of a report upon the silver-lead district of Kureka, Nevada;
the other was collected by Mr. S. F. Emmons, who is preparing a report
upon the geology of Leadville, Colorado.

The total number of specimens in the department is about 51,000, of
which 18,000 are in the exhibition series.
AO REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

During the year 2,412 specimens have been added to the collection,
and 1,413 entries have been made in the catalogue.

LIVING ANIMALS.

This department was formally organized May 12, 1888, Mr. William
T. Hornaday being appointed curator. For a long time past, the need
of living animals had been felt to serve as models for the taxidermists,
and, through the courtesy of the U. S. Fish Commission, arrangements
were made for Mr. Hornaday to accompany one of the cars belonging
to the Commission with a view to securing living specimens. On Oc-
tober 8, Mr. Hornaday left Washington, visiting points in Minnesota,
Dakota, Montana, Washington Territory, Oregon, Utah, and Wyo-
ming. This expedition resulted in the acquisition of seventeen animals.
Mr. J. Frank Ellis, of the U. S. Fish Commission, and his assistant, Mr.
R. S. Johnson, rendered valuable assistance to the Museum in connec-
tion with the transportation of these animals to Washington.

A wooden structure for their reception was erected immediately
south of the Smithsonian Building, and on December 31, 1887, it was
thrown open to the public. Since then a large number of valuable con-
tributions have been received, among which are a fine jaguar from Mr.
J. W. Riddle, of Eagle Pass, Texas, and two black bears from Mr. J.
J. EK. Linberg, of El Paso, Texas. The most important accession is a
pair of buffaloes from Nebraska. These were purchased by Hon.
EK. G. Blackford, of New York, and presented to the Smithsonian
Institution. The collection has been steadily increasing, and it is
hoped that during the next session of Congress an appropriation will
be made for the purchase of land with a view to forming a National
Zoological Park. Special thanks are due to the United States Ex-
press Company for having made generous reductions in the rates of
transportation on living animals, the agents of the company having
been instructed to ship living specimens to this Institution at ordinary
merchandise rates.

G.—REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK.

PROGRESS OF GENERAL AND INCIDENTAL WORK.
: LIBRARY.

Mr. John Murdoch, librarian, has submitted the following statement
in regard to the operations of the library during thé year:

The total number of publications added to the library during the year
was 6,063 (1,316 volumes of more than 100 pages, 1,436 pamphlets, 3,169
parts of regular serials, and 142 charts). Of these, 437 volumes, 953
pamphlets, and 1,655 parts of serials were retained for the use of the
Museum from the accessions of the Smithsonian Institution.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 4i

The remainder was obtained, as usual, by gift, and, less frequently,
by purchase.

The most important accession to the library during the year was the
bequest of the late curator of Archeology, Dr. Charles Rau, of his
archeological and general library, comprising 2,437 volumes and
pamphlets, many of very great value. Of these, 408 have already been
entered and catalogued.

When finished, these books will form the ‘ Rau Memorial Library,”
and will be assigned to the sectional library of archeology.

Other important donations were as follows: From the estate of the
late Prof. S. F. Baird, 65 volumes, 21 pamphlets, 303 parts of serials,
and 3 charts; from Prof. Charles U. Shepard, of Charleston, South
Carolina, 134 volumes and 5 pamphlets from the chemical library of his
distinguished father. (This donation was made at the suggestion of
Prof. F. W. Clarke, chief chemist, U.S. Geological Survey.) From Dr.
George E. Horn, of Philadelphia, a complete set of ‘‘ separates” of his
entomological papers, comprising 44 pamphlets.

During the year 5,492 books were borrowed from the library and
3,023 returned. Ninety-four persons are now authorized under the
regulations to draw books from the Museum Library, and of these 73
are also authorized to obtain books from the Library of Congress
through the Museum Library. Two hundred and ninety-eight orders
were sent to the Library of Congress during the year.

The ‘ Ledger of Books Issued” having grown so bulky and so in-
convenient, on account of the impossibility of alphabetical arrange-
ment, it was decided to try the experiment of transferring the charges
on this book to separate slips, which could be filed in alphabetical
order. When these slips were prepared by the copyist they were care-
fully compared with the records by the librarian in person, who then
canceled the old record. The slips used are of uniform size, one-fourth
of the standard octavo. When a book is issued the title, with the name
of the borrower and date of issue, is written on one of these slips, which
are kept by themselves for the day, and counted and filed the first
thing on the following morning. On the return of the book the slip is
removed from the file and canceled. The receipts of each borrower are
kept as before, but are filed alphabetically instead of by their dates.
The experiment has proved entirely successful. It is calculated that at
least half the time formerly consumed in recording loans is now saved,
and there is a distinct increase in accuracy. The success of this experi-
ment induced the librarian to use the same method in keeping the ac-
counts with the Library of Congress, as a great deal of time was wasted
whenever it was necessary to learn whether a certain book had been
drawn from the Library or when one had been returned. Of thelatter we
had no record except the unindexed file of canceled receipts, bound in a
clumsy volume. At present, one alphabetical file of slips gives the
titles of all books drawn from the Library of Congress, with the date
42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

of withdrawal of each; another shows the titles of all that have been
returned with the date of withdrawal and return. These two files thus
give acomplete history of our dealings with the Congressional Library.

When a book is received from the Library its title is immediately
written on a slip, which is stamped with the date and filed at once. On
its return to the Library of Congress this slip is removed from the file
of “‘ Borrowed,” stamped with the date, and filed as “‘ Returned.” This
system, which has been in operation since the latter part of March, has
proved entirely satisfactory.

The card-cataiogue by authors has been continued, and 2,829 titles
have been added to it during the year. It is still impossible to begin
the much-needed catalogue of subjects.

Sectional libraries.—An inspection of the sectional libraries was be-
gun April 2, 1888, and completed June 15, 1888. All the sectional
libraries were visited by the librarian in person, and the books found
in them carefully compared with the receipts given by the gentlemen
in charge of the sections. At the same time the titles of all books per-
manently assigned to each sectional library were transferred from the
ordinary ‘“‘call-cards” to a special form of receipt (approved by the
Secretary). These sectional library receipts are filed separately from
the receipts given by curators and others for books borrowed by them
-personally and not for the use of the section. Thus the receipts for
each sectional library form a catalogue of the books in that library.
At the close of the inspection each curator was furnished with a list of
the books in his sectional library.

The sectional libraries, the establishment of which has been author-
ized, are nineteen in number, namely: (1) Administration; (2) Arche-
ology; (3) Assistant Secretary Smithsonian Institution; (4) Birds;
(5) Chief Clerk Smithsonian Institution; (6) Editor Smithsonian In-
stitution; (7) Ethnology; (8) Fishes; (9) Insects; (10) Lithology and
Physical Geology; (11) Mammals; (12) Marine Invertebrates; (13)
Materia Medica; (14) Mesozoic Fossils; (15) Metallurgy and Kco-
nomie Geology; (16) Mineralogy; (17) Mollusks and Cenozoic Fossils ;
(18) Plants, recent and fossil; (19) Textiles and Foods.

Of these, Nos. 1, 3, and 5 have never been organized, while it has
been found convenient for purposes of administration to divide the
library of the section of Minerals into two divisions—(a) consisting
Chiefly of works on chemistry, and kept in the office of the honorary
curator and under his immediate charge, and (b) containing most of the
strictly mineralogical books, and kept in the mineral laboratory, in
charge of the assistant curator.

The following is the result of the inspection :

Archeology.—This library was organized December 14, 1887, on the
appointment of the new curator, and therefore not reiuspected. On
June 1, 1888, it contained 50 volumes and pamphlets and 15 parts of
serials. When the Rau Memorial Library is entered and catalogued it
will be assigned to this section.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 43

Birds.—Inspected April 2, 1888; contains 462 volumes and pam-
phlets and 183 parts of serials. These are generally in good condition,
though many of the large books are of necessity exposed to dust from
lack of suitable cases. This sectional library was founded before the
Museum library was organized, and was found to contain many books
belonging to the Smithsonian Institution of which the librarian had no
record. These were all properly catalogued and recorded.

Editor Smithsonian Institution.—Inspected June 8, 1888; contains
642 volumes and pamphlets and 390 parts of serials, all in good order.

Hthnology.—Inspected April 28, 1888; contains 61 volumes and pam-
phlets, 98 parts of serials, and 1 chart, in good condition.

Fishes.—Inspected April 18, 1888; contains 137 volumes and pam-
phlets and 12 parts of serials, in good condition, kept in suitable cases
with standard Museum locks.

Insects.—Inspected June 5, 1888; contains 390 volumes and pam- ~
phlets and 343 parts of serials, in good condition, kept in a case with
standard Museum lock. More case room is needed.

Lithology and physical geology.—Inspected May 3, 1888; contains 312
volumes and pamphlets and 127 parts of serials, in good condition. The
curator has two cases with standard Museum locks, which hold about
’ three-fourths of these books, while the rest are on open shelves.
Mammals.—Inspected May 28, 1888; contains 410 volumes and pam-
_phiets, in good order. The curator has not a sufficient number of cases
to contain these books.

Marine invertebrates.—Inspected April 14, 1888; contains 115 vol-
umes and pamphlets and 118 charts, all in good condition, and kept in
cases with standard Museum locks.

Materia medica.—Inspected April 23, 1888; contains 194 volumes
and pamphlets and 130 parts of serials, in good condition. About half
of the books are kept in a suitable case, provided with the standard
Museum lock, and the rest are on open shelves.

Mesozoic fossils—Inspected May 17, 1888; contains 36 volumes and
_ pamphlets in good order, kept on open shelves.

Metallurgy and economic geology.—Inspected May 10, 1888; contains
349 volumes and pamphlets and 94 parts of serials, in good condition
and very carefully arranged by the curator. There are six good cases,
amply sufficient to hold all these books.

Mineralogy.—(a) Inspected June 4, 1888; contains 142 volumes and
pamphlets and 228 parts of serials, in good order and kept in suitable
cases. (b) Inspected May 16, 1888; contains 98 volumes and pam-
phlets in good order and kept in a suitable case, with standard Museum
locks. ‘

Mollusks and Cenozoic fossils.—Inspected April 21, 1858; contains 74
volumes and pamphlets and 34 parts of serials, in good order, kept in
a locked case.

Plants, recent and fossil.—Inspected May 18, 1888; contains 320 vol-
44 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

umes and pamphlets and 359 parts of serials, kept in various rooms on
the south balcony and on shelves on the baleony.

Textiles and foods.—Owing te the temporary absence of the curator
and the inability of the assistant left in charge to take proper care of
the books in this library, they have been recalled to the central library.
On the return of the curator this sectional library will be reorganized.

It seems undesirable, and, indeed, hardly practicable to endeavor to
enforce the regulation which requires that books belonging to a sec-
tional library shall be kept separate from all other books. The books
in a specialist’s library are naturally arranged according to subjects,
which necessarily brings together books belonging to the sectional
library, the Library of Congress, and even the author himself.

Binding.—One hundred volumes belonging to the Museum were sent
to the Government Bindery late in the year and were all returned on or
before June 29. Considerable progress has been made in putting the
pamphlets into suitable covers ; but this work has been partially sus-
pended on account of the exhaustion of the appropriation for the pur-
chase of these covers.

Progress has also been made in arranging the pamphlets in the
pamphlet boxes mentioned in my last report, but this work has neces-
sarily been slow, since the routine work, as will be seen from the very
large number of books issued, returned, and catalogued, has occupied
nearly all the time of the two employés in the library.

TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE.
DISTRIBUTION OF DUPLICATES, AND EXCHANGES.

The total number of boxes, packages, barrels, tanks, ete., received
during the year was 12,400, of which 1,911 contained material for the
Museum collections, the remainder of the number being distributed to
their proper addresses.

The registrar, Mr. 8S. C. Brown, has continued to act as transportation
clerk for the Smithsonian Institution, thus adding much routine work
to his duties as registrar.

During the year 405 packages were entered upon the storage record
of the Museum. The storing of material is of very great convenience to
the curators, who may not at the time of the arrival of the material for
their department be able to work up the collection at once.

The number of packages sent out was 2,042, and of this number 264
contained Museum material sent out as gifts, loans, orin exchange. Pho-
tographs of cases and exhibits in the Museum have been sent to all who
made application. Much labor was added to the work of this depart-
ment in connection with the shipment of exhibits to the Ohio Valley
Centennial Exposition. These filled twelve cars and consisted of five
hundred and ninety-six packages, weighing in the aggregate 125,000
pounds.*

*A full account of the participation of the Smithsonian Institution in this exposi-
tion will be published in the report for 1888~89,

46 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Sixty-four photographs of cases and exhibits were sent out in compli-
ance with requests. JT ifty-three applications for duplicate specimens
have been received from individuals and institutions. Many of these
have been filled and the remainder will be, as soon as the duplicate
material can be arranged into sets for distribution.

A large number of exchanges of material of all kinds, especially
geological specimens, has been completed during the year.

The National Museum takes this opportunity of extending its warm-
est thanks to the Alaska Commercial Company and other companies
through whose kind offices the transportation of specimens has been
effected at various times during the year.

FOREIGN EXCHANGES.

Several exchanges with foreign institutions have been carried on dur-
ing the year. Among the more important the following may be men-
tioned :

A model of the Cabin Creek meteorite was sent to M. A. Daubrée, of the
Museum @’ Histoire Naturelle in Paris, and other models and photographs
will be sent later. ToS. H. Drew, Wanganui, New Zealand, was trans-
mitted a collection of ethnological objects, and from him was received a
~ collection of fossils. A small collection of archeological objects, number-
ing fifteen specimens, was transmitted to L. Guesde, Musée L’ Herminier,
Point a Pitre, from whom was received a collection of birdskins, num-
bering three hundred and twenty-eight specimens. A collection of one
hundred and forty-one North American stone implements was sent in
December to Sir Julius Von Haast, director of the Canterbury Museum,
Christ Church, New Zealand. From Dr. E. Hamy, director of the Mu-
sée @Ethnographie, in Paris, were received in exchange two boxes con-
taining busts representing types of the human race. A collection
of thirty-six specimens illustrating American aboriginal religion was
sent to M. L de Milloué, director of the Musée Guimet at Lyons. In
exchange, specimens of Roman pottery and objects of Gallo-Roman in-
terest in bone, stone, and bronze, as well as duplicates of Chinese and
Japanese religious objects, have been promised. An exchange of bats
has been arranged for with Siguor Angelo Senna, of the Zoological In-
stitute at Pavia, Italy. A collection of minerals, ores,and rocks was
received from Mr. 8. Sinclair, director of the Australian Museum, Syd-
ney, New South Wales. Birdskins, including two specimens of Namiye’s
Woodpecker, specimens of lacquer-work, meteoric stones, sapphire crys-
tals, and asaddle from Loochoo, have been received from the Educa-
tional Department, Tokyo, Japan, and a collection of one hundred and
seventeen birdskins has been sent in exchange.

Negotiations are still pending for exchanges of material with several
other individuals and institutions.

PUBLICATIONS.

In June, 1888, the report on the operations of the National Museum
for the first six months of 1885 was issued as Part 1 of the Annual
Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution. This
volume contains i-xi, 1-264 and i-vii, 1-939 pages, the latter series of
pages constituting a paper by Hon. Thomas Donaldson, entitled ‘The
George Catlin Indian Gallery.” This is illustrated by one hundred and
forty-two plates and two large maps, showing the bounds of Indian
reservations.

The reports on the operations of the Museum for 188586 and 1886~87
are in type, and will soon be received from the Public Printer.

The ninth volume of ‘‘ Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum,”
for 1886, was received from the Government Printing Office in August,
1887. Two hundred copies of this volume had already been received
in “signatures” and distributed in that form to the principal scientific
_ institutions, and also to a few individuals, in all parts of the world.
The first signature was published on September 17, 1886, and the last
on March 9, 1887. Volume 9 contains i—viii, 1-714 pages, and is illus-
trated by twenty-five full page plates, one of which is a chromo-litho-
graph, and a large number of text figures. The authors of papers in
this volume are twenty-seven in number, namely: James H. Benedict,
T. W. Blakiston, George H. Boehmer, Charles H. Bollman, EH. D. Cope,
W. H. Dall, George E. Doering, Charles L. Edwards, Carl H. Higen-
mann, Barton W. Evermann, Fernando Ferrari-Perez, Morton W.

48 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Bulletin 32, “Catalogue of Batrachians and Reptiles of Central
America and Mexico,” by Prof. E. D. Cope, has been published during
the year and contains 98 octavo pages. This catalogue is a systematic
and synonymie description of Central American and Mexican species of
Batrachia and Reptilia, largely based on material in the National
Museum. ‘To each species is added a list of the localities where it has
been found, together with the name of the discoverer, or, in the absence
of that, the name of the author who is responsible for the correctness
of the locality. The total number of genera included in the catalogue
is 197, and of species, 705, of which 135 are batrachians and 570 rep-
tiles.

The manuscript for Bulletins No. 33, “Catalogue of Minerals and
Synonyms, alphabetically arranged for the use of Museums,” by Dr,
Thomas Egleston, and No. 34, “Catalogue of Batrachians and Reptiles
of North America,” by Prof. E. D. Cope, is now in the hands of the
Public Printer.

Mr. A. Howard Clark has faithfully continued his duties as editor
of the Proceedings and Bulletin.

Circular No. 36 of the U.S. National Museum, concerning the Depart-
ment of Prehistoric Antropology, has been issued. The object of this
circular is to obtain information concerning that class of American
aboriginal stone implements which have heretofore been denominated
“rude or unfinished implements of the paleolithic type.” It is illus-
trated by cuts of several stone implements. This circular was widely
- distributed among archeologists and others interested in the subject,
and much valuable information was elicited, which has been incorpor-
ated in a paper by the curator of prehistoric anthropology, and is pub-
lished in Section rt of this Report.

In Section rv of the Report will be found a list of the publications of the
Museum, and also a bibliography of papers published by officers of the
Museum and by collaborators, whose writings are based upon Museum
material. The authors of these papers are 77 in number, of whom 35
are connected with the Museum, 14 being honorary officers. The total
number of papers is 396, of which 311 are by Museum officers and 85
by other investigators, and are distributed under the following sub-
jects:

erican rocks was lent for study to Mr. J.8. Diller, of the U. S. Geological
Survey. Mr. J. F. Kemp has published two papers describing the south-
eastern Missouri lead region, basing his remarks upon collections which
were made by him, and which formed a part of the exhibit of the De-
partment of Metallurgy at the New Orleans Exhibition in 1884, These
collections are now in the Museum. A drawing of Pilocarpus pennati-
folius was lent for comparison to Dr. Clement Biddle, U.S. Navy. In
accordance with the request of the Smithsonian Institution, July 11,
the Navy Department detailed Paymaster William J. Thomson, U.S.S.
Mohican, to enable him to complete his report on Easter Island, and
upon the collections made by himself at that place. Mr. Henry Hemp- —
hill, of San Diego, California, has during the past year, as in previous
years, rendered valuable assistance to the Department of Mollusks,
and has presented much valuable and interesting material. Dr. Will-

granted.

CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE WORK.
BUILDINGS AND LABOR: POLICE AND PUBLIC COMFORT.

This department is under the charge of Henry Horan, superintendent
of buildings.

At the beginning of the present fiscal year the staff employed for
police and inspection, under the charge of Henry Horan, superinten-
dent of buildings, consisted of 1 assistant superintendent, 12 watch-
men, 5 door-keepers, 1 telephone operator, 1 copyist, 1 mail messenger ;
for construction, care of buildings and repairs, 4 carpenters, 2 paint-
ers; for labor and cleaning, 3 skilled laborers, 16 laborers, 7 cleaners, 2
attendants. For heating and lighting there was employed 1 engineer,
with 6 firemen. Extra laborers have been employed from time to time,
and particularly in connection with the preparation of the exhibit for
the Cincinnati Exposition.

The following paragraphs contain a condensed summary of the most
important work accomplished in each month :

SS V ae

July.—During this month the task of preparing an exhibit for the Minneapolis Ex-
position was commenced, under the general supervision of Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk.
The work of packing «nd shipping the exhibit occupied the time of the greater part
of the force until late in August, when Mr. C. A. Steuart, assistant superintendent of
buildings, was sent to Minnneapolis to superintend the work of unpacking and in-
stalling the exhibit. This work was completed on August 31, the opening day of the
Exposition.

August.—During this month the work of removing the frame annex east of the
Museum building was completed. The material thus obtained was utilized in the
erection of work and storage sheds south of the Smithsonian building. Steam-pipes
were laid, in order to connect these sheds with the boilers in the Smithsonian build-
ing. The collection of scientific instruments was removed from the north hall of the
Museum building to a room specially fitted for its reception in the east wing of the
Smithsonian building.

September.—Much of the time of the laborers during this month was occupied in-re-
arranging the cases in the Anthropological hall of the Smithsonian building. A
large collection of stone images, models of cliff dwellings, and other objects of great
weight, was removed from the Museum building to this hall. This work necessitated
great care in its execution. A cast of a whale in the south hall of the Museum build-
ing was removed from its base and suspended from the ceiling, thus affording addi-
tional floor space.

October.—During this month was commenced the erection of sheds south of the
Smithsonian building. The arrangement of the material which had been removed
from the Museum building to the Anthropological hall in the Smithsonian building
was finished. The walls and ceilings in the basement of the Smithsonian building
were whitewashed. The sewerage in the basement of the Smithsonian building was
repaired. Thirteen walnut cases, formerly used in the Smithsonian building, were re-
constructed, to conform to the needs of the Department of Metallurgy. The cases in
the Department ot Lithology and Physical Geology were re-arranged. The signal
clocks throughout the buildings were put in order. Several pine cases were erected
in the basement of the Smithsonian building for the use of the Department of Fishes,
54 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

November.—The principal work of the month consisted in unpacking the exhibit.
which had been returned from the Minneapolis Exposition. The rearrangement of
the material in their cases occupied much time. Such articles as were not required
for exhibition in the Museum were placed in storage. Alterations were made in the
natural history laboratory, and the walls of the various rooms painted. Double
doors were added to the Secretary’s office.

December.—During this month the sheds south of the Smithsonian building were
repaired and an additional shed was constructed. Cages and inclosures for the col-
lection of living animals were constructed. Many of the exhibition cases throughout
the buildings were repaired. Considerable work has been done in the Ornithological
Department. Many of the bird-cases have been reconstructed, new shelving has been
put in, and the cases have been painted inside and outside.

18ss.

January.—A large number of cases hitherto in use in the north hall were removed
to different parts of the Museum building. These were replaced with others, thus
necessitating anentire rearrangement of the hall. This work occupied a large force
of men during several days. The food collection was removed from the northwest
range to the northeast court. The exhibit of the Entomological Department was re-
moved from the southeast court to the southeast range. ‘The cases in the hall de-
voted to the fishery exhibit were rearranged. Twelve mahogany cases were received
for the exhibit of the Department of Graphic Arts and placed in position. Four
plates of glass, each 9 feet by 7 feet 3 inches, were successfully set in the case contain-
ing the mounted group of bisons. The entire Materia Medica collection was re-
arranged. A plank walk was constructed around the carpenter shop. The rooms
ou the first floor east of the north entrance were fitted up for the accommodation of
the engineer of property.

February.—During this month the east and west hall were rearranged undez the
supervision of Professor Mason, curator of the Department of Ethnology. The empty
exhibition cases and other property were removed from the southeast court in order
to make room for the exhibition of fossils and botanical specimens. The collection
of tiles was removed from the west hall to the southwest range. Several war relics,
which had been in the custody of the War Department, were transferred from the
Winder Building by Museum laborers and placed on exhibition in the National Mu-
seum. A section of a large California tree was brought from the residence of Senator
Leland Stanford. A storm-door was constructed at the north entrance to the Museum
building. Much of the time during this and the following month was occupied in
preparing the lecture hall for the annual course of Saturday lectures. Cases were
placed in the reconstructed portion of the west wing of the Smithsonian building.
A brick wall was built between the offices of the curator of fishes and of the curator
of marine invertebrates. The steam-pipes leading to the sheds south of the Smith-
sonian building were covered.

March.—The Graphic Arts collection was placed in position. The exhibit illustrat-
ing the composition of the human body was removed from the northeast court to the
southeast range. The material in the old Armory building was overhauled prepara-
tory to a general cleaning.

April.—The objects of stone and iron were removed from the shed on the east side
of the Museum building and the shed torn down. The lecture hall was fitted up
for stereopticon exhibition in the day-time, the windows being provided with screens,
so arranged as to be raised or lowered. Special preparations were made in arranging
the lecture hall for the meetings of the National Academy of Sciences. Walks were
laid to and from the shops in the rear of the Smithsonian building.

May.—The work of constructing feed and shelter houses and other inclosures for the
collection of living animals occupied a considerable portion of the time of the laborers.
The spouting on the various buildings was repaired. The awnings were repaired and
placed on the windows.

June.—The work of preparing an exhibit for the Ohio Valley Exposition at Cin-
cinnati was continued. A large additional force of mechanics and laborers was
employed, and by June 30 ten car-loads of exhibits had been forwarded to Cincinnati.
On June 25 Mr. Horan left for Cincinnati to saperintend the arrangement of the ex-
hib‘t, which had been placed under the general supervision of Mr. R. E. Earll.

During the last six months of this year two hundred and eighty-five lights of plate-
glass have been fitted in the cases assigned to the Department of Birds, replacing the °
smal] lights of common glass hitherto in use in these cases.

ELECTRIC SERVICE.

In August, 1887, a contract. was made with a firm of electricians of
this city to furnish all material and labor necessary for putting in order
the electrical service in the Museum and Smithsonian buildings, the cost
being $215. The work was satisfactorily completed. A further agree-
ment was then made with the same firm to keep the electrical apparatus
in order for the remainder of the fiscal year, furnishing all material and
labor, for the sum of $12.50a month. The transfer of the electrical serv-
ice from the care of an employé of the Museum to an outside firm has been
made in the interest of economy, and has resulted very satisfactorily.
The electric bells, other than those belonging to the Telephone Com-
pany, reaching twenty-eight points of the buildings, have been kept in
good working order; the clock regulator has been cleaned and repaired;
the watchmen’s clocks, time dials, and station-boxes in both buildings,
numbering twenty-two, have been overhauled and repaired; and all
wires have been tested and repaired. The door-bells and burglar-alarms
have been tested and are now in guod order.

TELEPHONE SERVICE.

The work of this service has been very faithfully and intelligently
performed by Miss M. L. Stone, who, in addition to her duties as tele-
phone operator, has had charge of the Bureau of Information, the object
of which is to reply to the numerous questions of visitors. The tele-
phone switch-board has a capacity for making one hundred connections.
At the present time there are only thirty-seven different circuits in use.
There are two separate lines connecting the Museum with the central
office in this city. The daily average number of calls through the year
is about one hundred. During the year 34,318 connections have been
made. Through this office telegrams may be sent by the Western
Union Telegraph Company, the Baltimore and Ohio Telegraph Com-
pany, and the Government Department telegraph ines.

PROPERTY AND SUPPLIES.

While the general routine work of the Museum has been the same as
in former years, some changes have been adopted which are leading
to more satisfactory results.

It had heretofore been the custom, through the courtesy of the De-
partment of the Interior, to avail ourselves of the bids received there,
in obtaining our supplies, but our needs being widely different from
those of all other departments of the Government, it was thought that
an independent course might be more satisfactory. Consequently, in
May, 1888, proposals were advertised for and contracts were awarded.

During this year Mr. J. EH. Watkins, who was holding an important
office under the Pennsylvania Railway Company, was offered the posi-
tion as head of the Department of Property and Supplies, and entered
upon his duties January 1, 1888, with the title of Engineer of Property.
56 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 18388.

Under the supervision of Mr. Watkins the work of bringing up to
date the back records of the office was systematically entered upon,
aud has been vigorously prosecuted; the preparation of a complete list
of all articles classed as furniture and fixtures has been begun, and labels
and numbers prepared for the same.

FINANCES.

The following statement being supplementary to the detailed report
of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, forwarded to Congress
December 1, 1888, it has not been thought necessary to repeat the ac-
count of expenditures minutely given therein. (See Miscellaneous Doc-
ument No. 55, Fiftieth Congress, second session.)

During the year ending June 30, 1888, the appropriation received by
the Museum for preservation of collections was $116,000; for furniture
and fixtures, $40,000; for heating and lighting, $12,000.

PRESERVATION OF COLLECTIONS.

The disbursements paid from the appropriation for preservation of
collections for this year are as follows: For services, $97,493.32 was
expended; $3,427.25 for general supplies; $8,737.59 for specimens ;
$2,281.96 for stationery ; $783.69 for books ; $983.81 for travel ; $2,053.27
for freight and cartage, making a totai of $115,760.89, which leaves an
unexpended balance of $239.11. From this balance there are yet to be
paid outstanding liabilities to the amount of $226.18, principally ac-
counts of bonded railways for freight on specimens, which are still
awaiting settlement in the Treasury.

FURNITURE AND FIXTURES.

Out of the appropriation for furniture and fixtures this year there has
been expended for services $19,203.79: for exhibition cases of various
designs, with drawings for the same, and for unit-tables and wing-
frames, $7,615.30; for drawers, trays, office furniture and other fixtures,
$2,714.51; for brackets, tools, glass, hardware and interior fittings,
$4,896.08; for lumber, paints, and oils, $3,080.43; for chemicals, appa-
tus for laboratory, and for jars and containers for specimens, $675.81 ;
for oak shields, bird-stands, etc., $217.94; for linings for cases, $420.24;
for plumbing, tin, lead, slate, tiles, etc., $1,038.11; and for miscellane-
ous expenses $110.83, leaving an wnexpended balance of $26.96.

CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORTS.

This department of the Museum work has since 1886 been under the
charge of Mr. R. I. Geare. The correspondence of the Museum has
greatly increased during the last few years. In 1881, the first year of
occupancy of the Museum building, the number of pages in the press-
58

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

copy books of letters written hardly exceeded one thousand, and of these
letters fully one-half related to work connected with the fishery inves-
tigations of the Tenth Census.

For the purpose of explaining the nature of the correspondence of
the Museum at the present time and of showing the large increase in
this branch of the administrative work, it is convenient to arrange the
Museum correspondence under the following headings: (1) General
Museum business, including matters connected with Museum adminis-
tration, arrangement of foreign exchanges, etc.; (2) replies to requests
for technical information; (3) the acknowledgment of gifts, loans, and
exchanges; (4) reports upon specimens sent for identification.

Under the first heading 1,959 letters have been written.

Letters containing requests for information are constantly being re-
ceived, and it isa part of the duty of this office to see that such requests
are referred to the proper specialists, and to incorporate their replies in

letters conveying the desired information.

During the year 2,626 let-

ters of this kind have been received, and their source is indicated in the
following geographical summation :

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 59

More than a thousand acknowledgments of specimens acquired by
gift, loan, and exchange have been written.

The number of ‘‘lots” of specimens received for examination and re-
port during the year was three hundred and fifty-seven, fourteen of which
were transmitted by Members of Congress. This material included birds,
insects, minerals, ores, rocks, fossils, ethnological and archeological ob-
jects, shells, fishes, mammals, plants, oils, earths, reptiles, birds’ eggs and
nests, skeletons, fibers, coins, marine invertebrates, fossil wood. The
Specimens were submitted to the Museum curators, and a report em-
bodying the opinion of the curator has been prepared in every instance
for the signature of the Assistant Secretary and for transmission to the
sender.

By far the larger proportion of the material sent for examination is
of very little value to the Museum collections, although occasionally
a specimen is retained for addition to the exhibition or study series. The
Museum reserves the right, except when special agreement to the con-
trary is made, to keep all material sent for examination and report.

Thirty-one lots of specimens were borrowed by curators to aid them in
the identification of Museum material. These included twenty-two col-
lections of bird-skins, seven of shells, and three of fossils. The courtesy
of the lending was acknowledged by formal letters.

During the year 5,272 pages of press copy-books have been filled with
letters relating exclusively to Museum matters.

This office is also charged with the compilation of data for the annual
report, with the preparation of a bibliography of the Museum publications
and of papers published by Museum officers and other collaborators, and
also with the preparation of the list of accessions to the Museum, accom-
panied by indexes showing (1) the Museum department to which re-
ferred, and (2) the geographical source of the accession.

PREPARATION OF LABELS.

During the year 2,159 forms of labels have been printed, as is shown
in the following statement:

More than two thousand additional labels were sent to the Govern-
ment Printing Office during the year. These, however, had not been
received at the close of the fiscal year.

Since the instructive value of objects exhibited depends in great part
on good descriptive labels, it is hoped that hereafter ~reater facilities
may be afforded for the rapid printing of the same.
60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS.

The preparation of specimens for exhibition in the Museum, or for the
study series, has been satisfactorily continued. The work of modeling
has been placed under the charge of Mr. W. T. Hornaday, chief taxi-
dermist.

(a) TAXIDERMISTS AND MODELERS.

The work of this department has been unusually important. Early
in the year the making of large casts was discontinued, and Mr. Joseph
Palmer, modeler, was added to the force of mammal taxidermists. A
little later Mr. William Palmer was also assigned to this department,
and has accomplished some excellent results in the preparation of small
mammals. Mr. Joseph Palmer has rendered valuable service in the
mounting of large mammals. In.order to complete the systematic ad-
ministration of this class of work Mr. J. W. Hendley was also added to
this force, which thus becomes the Department of Taxidermy and Model-
ing, under the direction of Mr. W. T. Hornaday, chief taxidermist. This
force also includes Mr. A. H. Forney and Mr. George F. Pollock, an un-
salaried assistant serving for instructionin taxidermy. During the last
month of the year, Messrs. George K. Cherrie and B. W. Mitchell were
engaged temporarily to assist in the preparation of the exhibit for the
Cincinnati Exposition.

TAXIDERMY PROPER.

The event of the year has been the mounting of a series of six of the
buffaloes obtained by the Smithsonian Expedition sent out in 1886, and
the arrangement of the specimens in a group. The finished group is
fitly regardly as a monument to the American bison, and illustrates not
only the various stages of growth of the animal from the young calf to
a huge old bull of enormous proportions, but the ground-work and nat-
ural accessories of the group have also been carefully and artistically
worked up to illustrate the habitat of the animal. The whole is re-
garded as a triumph of the taxidermist’s art, and, so far as known, it
surpasses in scientific accuracy, and artistic design and treatment, any-
thing of the kind yet produced. The group is the work of Mr. Horna-
day, assisted by Mr. Joseph Palmer and Mr. A. H. Forney. The case
containing the group is also regarded as a model of its kind, both in
elegance of design, and perfect adaptability to its purpose. Its dimen-
sions are as follows: Length 16 feet, width 12 feet, height 10 feet.

The preparation of the group of buffaloes fairly inaugurates a line of
work which has been in contemplation for some time, namely, the pre-
paration of a series of artistic groups of American mammals, both large
and small, each in its own special case, with natural accessories repre-
senting its favorite habitat. The taxidermists have also mounted dur-
ing the year a group of prong-horn antelopes, of coyotes, prairie-dogs,
opossums, gray squirrels and red squirrels, and have also made a be-
ginning on a group of moose and two groups of foxes. The groups of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 61

coyotes, antelopes, prairie-dogs, and opossums were placed on exhibition
shortly after the completion of the group of buffaloes, which occurred
on March 10, 1888.

The following is a list of the mammals which have been mounted dur-

DRY SKINS.

A special feature of taxidermic work during the past year has been
the overhauling of the collection of wet skins and the making up of a
great many of the duplicates as dry skins suitable for study. The entire
force spent about two months in work of this kind, and prepared dry
skins as follows:

MISCELLANEOUS WORK.

An unusval quantity of miscellaneous work has required attention,
which tended to lessen the amount of. visible results for the year. The
The following are a few of the principal tasks completed :

43 mammal skins, heads and skulls were poisoned.
17 mammal heads repaired after return from the Cincinnati Exposition.
8 pairs antlers cleaned and retouched.
7 pairs antlers mounted on shields and hung up.
25 large mammals cleaned and retouched.
24 small mammals cleaned and retouched.
14 mounted mammals were repaired and retouched.
11 large wet skins picked out for exchange.
1 large mounted mammal was dismounted.
16 barrels of solution were made for wet skin collection.
38 barrels and three tanks of wet skins were moved to jaboratory.
28 boxes of specimens were received.
14 miscellaneous boxes of specimens were packed and shipped.
41 boxes mounted manmnals were packed for Cincinnati Exposition.
9 large cages for living bears, birds of prey, etc., were built by the taxidermists.
From November 8, 1887, to February 1, 1588, the collection of living
animals was cared for by the taxidermists.
Mr. Joseph Palmer made a trip to North Platte, Nebraska, and brought
back two living buffaloes,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 63

Mr. W. T. Hornaday, the chief taxidermist, was absent one month on
a collecting trip to the Pacific coast.

Mr. Joseph Palmer devoted the entire month of June to making casts
for the Department of Ethnology.

MODELING AND PAINTING.

Mr. J. W. Hendley has accomplished much valuable work, 1aaking
painted casts of the specimens constituting the extensive aa almost
priceless collection of Babylonian and Assyrian seals owned by Mr.
R. 8S. Williams, of Utica, New York. No more important work has en-
gaged Mr. Hendley’s attention during his connection with the National
Museum, and it is due him to say that notwithstanding the many
difficulties attending the casting and painting of agate, chalcedony,
onyx, graphite, and crystal seals covered with delicate inscriptions,
he has reproduced them all with a degree of skill and fidelity which,
it is believed, has never before been attained. In many instances the
copies were so exact in color, surface, similarity of substance and weight,
that even the owner of the seals several times mistook the copies for
the originals. Not only were the seals themselves copied, three com-
plete sets being made, but Mr. Hendley also made a flat impression in
black and white of the inscription on each of the cylindrical seals, so
that the characters may be studied to the best possible advantage. Of
these flat impressions four complete sets were made.

Mr. Hendley has also made thirty-three casts of meteorites for the
Department of Minerals, to be used in exchanges.

The more important items of work accomplished by Mr. Hendley dur-
ing the year may be summarized as follows:

29 Babylonian and Assyrian seals cast and painted, three complete sets, or 87 copies
in all.
29 flat impressions of seals made in black and white, four complete sets, or 116 pieces
in all.
11 casts of Arkansas iron meteorite.
11 casts of North Carolina stone meteorite.
11 casts of Mexican iron meteorite.
Bartholdi’s statue of Roman Soldier repaired and painted.
Busts of Professor Baird and Robert Fulton painted.
Statue of General McPherson repaired and painted.
Siamese coat of arms repaired and regilded.
Large Japanese plaque repaired and pieces restored.
Large heraldic shield repaired and regilded.
3 sets of casts made of the phosphorus, potassium, and sodium for the collection
illustrating the composition of the human body.
1 set of casts made to represent the daily food of a man—bread, butter, potatoes,
and beefsteak.
2 Ute Indian lay figures made, costumed, and grouped.
3 medals copied.

Notwithstanding the value of Mr. Joseph Palmer’s taxidermic work,
it has been found necessary to interrupt it from time to time in favor of
important work in plaster. During the year he has put together and
set up the original plaster model of Crawford’s statue of Washington,
64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

repaired two Mexican idols, made a cast of the head of a large moose
(in the flesh), and repaired a large group of serpents cast from nature.
During the month of June Mr. Palmer took molds of the celebrated
Canopus inscriptions, of a large Assyrian obelisk, and two large sculpt-
ured slabs in the Episcopal Seminary of Fairfax County, Virginia, at
Alexandria.

(6) OSTEOLOGICAL PREPARATOR.

The work of preparing and arranging osteological material has been
greatly interrupted during the past year.

During the months of Juiy and August Mr. Lucas was absent on a
collecting trip to Newfoundland and Labrador, while Mr. Scollick, the
only assistant, was for seven weeks unable to do any work on account
of sickness.

In November the work-rooms were transferred from the Armory to
the Laboratory building, together with a considerable amount of ma-
terial on storage at the former place.

The re-arrangement of the Museum halls necessitated a complete
change in the disposition of the cases containing the exhibition series
of skeletons, while the growth of the collections rendered it necessary
to completely change the arrangement of the study series of birds.

Finally, the month of June was largely devoted to packing specimens
for the Cincinnati Exposition.

During the year the collection of alcoholic birds was transferred from
the basement of the Smithsonian to the Laboratory building, and while
some little work has been done in the way of arranging and caring for
them, a great deal of labor will be required to place this valuable col-
lection in thoroughly good order.

Considerable time was spent in assorting the large and valuable col-
lection of bones of the extinct great Auk, secured by the Grampus ex-
pedition, and besides a mounted skeleton, other preparations have been
made relating to the history of this interesting bird.

The following table gives a summary of the material received and of
the work of preparation accomplished during the year :

The Secretary of the Treasury has on several occasions aided the
scientific work of investigators by allowing the free passage of scien-
tific outfits. Much valuable assistance has, through the courtesy of the
Department, been extended to explorers and collectors by the customs
officers at various points.

Life-Saving Service.—For several years past the Smithsonian Institu-
tion has, through the kindness of Hon. S. I. Kimball, Superintendent of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. (7

the Life-Saving Service, enjoyed the assistance of the keepers of life-
Saving stations at various points along the Atlantic coast, in the matter
of reporting the capture of whales and other large species of fishes.
As the result of this co-operation during the year a specimen of file-
fish, Alutera schapfi, was obtained from Capt. Herbert M. Knowles,
keeper of the life-saving station at Point Judith, Rhode Island. Cap.
tain Knowles also forwarded two specimens of Hpinephelus niveatus,
one of the smallest members of the family of “Groupers.” This species
is rarely found so far north, but is common in the West Indies and
thence north to Florida. From Amasa Bowen, keeper of the life-saving
station at Atlantic City, New Jersey, was received a pigmy sperm-whale.

France, Germany, Italy, and other nations, were also received from Mr.
Graves.

Revenue Marine Division.—During the year 1887 the assistance of the
Revenue Marine Division, under the charge of Hon. Peter Bonnett, was
asked in the matter of procuring for the National Museum specimens
of “bidarkas,” or Eskimo kyaks. Capt. M. A. Healy, then of the reve-
nue steamer Bear, was requested by Mr. Bonnett to obtain specimens,
if possible, on his next visit to Alaska. His efforts were successful,
and upon his return to San Francisco six ‘‘bidarkas” were placed in
the hands of the Alaska Commercial Company, with the request that
they be transmitted to Washington for the National Museum.

WAR DEPARTMENT.

_ Following the custom of previous years, the Secretary of War has
permitted the quartermasters of the Army to forward from their respect-
ive posts, boxes containing specimens of natural history intended for
the National Museum. This privilege has been of great benefit to the
Museum, and has resulted in the acquirement by the Museum of large
and valuable collections which, owing to the difficulty and expense ot
transportation by the ordinary means, would perhaps have been with-
held from transmission.

By authority of the Secretary of War, General 8. V. Benét, Chief of
Ordnance, transmitted from the Ordnance Museum a plaster model of the
equestrian statue of General McPherson; a section of an oak tree, cut
down by musket-balls near Spottsylvania Court-House, Virginia, and
presented to the War Department by General N. A. Miles, U.S. Army ;
‘a Mexican saddle and bridle, manufactured in Mexico for General Tre-
vino, commanding the northern line of Mexico, and presented by him -
to General E. O. C. Ord, U. S. Army, by whom they were deposited in
the Ordnance Museum on March, 23, 1878.
18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

In connection with the preparation for the Cincinnati Exposition of

heads. Lieutenant Carpenter has for many years been interested in
natural history research and his co-operation has always been very
highly prized.

Lieut. H. C. Benson, U.S. Army, stationed at Fort Huachuca, Ari-
zona, whose co-operation the Smithsonian Institution has enjoyed for
several years, has continued his excellent work in collecting specimens of
natural history for the National Museum, and during the year has con-
tributed the skins and eggs of numerous species of birds and several
reptiles. The skin of a Trogon, included in one of the sendings, differs
from all other specimens of 7. ambiguus in the collection, and may repre-
sent a new species.

eggs, and of Dr. H. C. Yarrow as curator os reptiles and Batrachians,
have been continued.

NAVY DEPARTMENT.

The Museum has received much valuable material during the year
through the co-operation of officers of the United States Navy. Com-
modore John G. Walker, Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, has, as in
previous years, given valuable assistance.

A large collection of ethnological objects, including spear-heads, pad-
dles, oars, clubs, feather head-dresses, wooden idols, specimens of tapa,
skulls, etc., were obtained by Paymaster W.J.Thomson on Haster Island,
and were deposited by him in the Museum, together with a series of

Dr. H. G. Beyer, U. S. Navy, continued to act until October, 1887, as
honorary curator of the Section of Materia Medica, at which time he
was ordered elsewhere for duty by the Department.

To the great regret of the Museum, Lieutenant Bolles, who has ren-
dered exceedingly valuable services in the Kthnological Department,
especially in connection with the work of classifying and arranging the
Eskimo collections, has been recalled, having been assigned to active
duty.

INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.

The National Museum is especially indebted to the Secretary of the
Interior for the disbursement of the Museum appropriations, which has
been very promptly and satisfactorily attended to by Mr. George W.
Evans, disbursing clerk of the Department of the Interior.

Patent Office—Two valuable ancient Greek coins have been con-
tributed by Alexander Scott.

Indian Office—A sketch of a fish was forwarded by Charles Wil-
loughby, of Quinaielt Agency, Washington Territory, with a request
for identification. The fishitself was transmitted later, and proved to
be a new genus and species. In honor of Mr. Willoughby the scientific
name of Acrotus willoughbyi has been given to this species by the Na-
tional Museum.

U. S. FISH COMMISSION.

Through the courtesy of Colonel McDonald the Museum has continued
to enjoy the valuable co-operation, as curators, of several attachés of
the Commission, and collections made by the vessels of the Fish Com-

mission have been transferred to the custody of the Museum. This
co-operation between the Smithsonian Institution and the Fish Com- ~
mission has existed since the organization of the latter, at which time
Prof. Spencer F. Baird, then Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, was appointed U. S. Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries,
and it is sincerely hoped that it will always continue.

The most important accession to the Museum, resulting from the co-
operation of the Fish Commission with the Museum, was a series of
collections obtained by the U.S. Fish Commission schooner Grampus
during her expedition to Funk Island, which was organized primarily
for the purpose of obtaining bones of the great auk. The expedition
was very successful, and in addition collections of fishes, bird skins,
birds’ eggs, shells, echinoderms, sea anemones, surface towings, crus-
tacea, copper ores, fossil shells, living birds, skins and skulls of meadow
jark, and rocks were made and transferred to the Museum. Dr. T. H.
Bean, while engaged in work for the Commission on the coast of New
Jersey, collected fishes, crabs, star-fishes and sea-urchins in the vicinity of
Great Egg Harbor. Fishes and cray-fishes were sent from the Central
Station of the Commission, in Washington, from the Wytheville Station,
in Virginia, and from the station at Havre de Grace, Maryland.

Collections of fishes, crustaceans, and insects were received from the
summer station of the Fish Commission at Wood’s Holl, Massachusetts.
Important contributions of fishes, marine invertebrates, and mollusks
were received from the U. S. Fish Commission steamers Albatross and
Fish Hawk. Mr. Vinal Edwards contributed collections of fishes, birds,
birds’ nests, parasites, surface towings, crustaceans, and turtles.

The services of Mr. Richard Rathbun as honorary curator of marine
invertebrates, of Dr.T. H. Bean as honorary curator of fishes, of Capt.
J. W. Collins as honorary curator of naval architecture, and of Mr.
R. BE. Earll as honorary curator of fishes and of animal products, have
been continued, through the courtesy of the Commissioner, and sincere
acknowledgments are due for their valuable labors.

U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.

The Museum has enjoyed the co-operation of the officers of the Geo-
logical Survey, and this has resulted in much benefit to the Museum.

Dr. C. A. White continues to act as curator of Mesozoic Fossils; Mr.
C. D. Walcott, of Paleozoic Fossils; Mr. Lester F. Ward, as curator of
Botany; Prof. F. W. Clarke, as curator of Minerals, and Mr. William
H. Dall and Dr. R. E. C. Stearns as curator and adjunct curator, re-
spectively, of Mollusks.

Among the collections of fossils, rocks, ores, and minerals made by
officers of the Geological Survey and transferred to the National
Museum may be specially mentioned those which were collected by
Messrs. Frank Burns, W. G. Brown, Whitman Cross, C. W. Cunning-
ham, William H. Dall, S. F. Emmons, W. F. Hillebrand, L. C. Johnson,
R. H. C. Stearns, and C. D. Walcott.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 81

J.—EXPLORATIONS.

In October, 1887, a Department of Living Animals was organized, chiefly
for the purpose of affording opportunity for study in connection with
certain kinds of work then being prosecuted in the Museum. It was
decided that hereafter all gifts of living animals which might be offered
to the Museum would be accepted, cared for in the best manner possi-
ble, and exhibited, with due credit to the donors. It was also decided
that whenever it was found possible to purchase a living wild animal
for study purposes at a nominal price, it might be done. In accordance
with this determination, Mr.W. T. Hornaday was permitted by the U.S.
Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries to make a collecting trip on fish
car No. 1 to and through Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Ore-
gon, and Utah in the interest of this department.

Mr. Hornaday left Washington on October 8, with Mr. J. Frank Ellis,
in charge of the car, and proceeded westward. In the course of the
work of distributing fish the car made brief stops at St. Paul; Fargo,
Dakota; Mandan and Helena, Montana; Tacoma, Washington; Port
land, Oregon; Mountain Home, Idaho, and Salt Lake City, Utah. As
soon as it became known at those points that the National Museum
was ready to accept gifts of living animals, several specimens were
presented, and others of desirable kinds were purchased at nominal
prices. The most important of the animals collected and brought to
Washington by Mr. Hornaday were the following : 1 Columbian black-
tailed deer (Cariacus columbianus), 1 mule deer (Cariacus macrotis), 1
white-tailed deer (C. virginianus), 1 cinnamon bear (Ursus cinnamomum),
2 badgers (Tawidea americana), 2 red foxes (Vulpes fulvus fulvus), 1
cross fox (Vulpes fuluus decussatus), 2 spotted lynxes (Lynx maculatus),
5 prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), and a golden eagle (Aquila
chryscetus). All of these animals were brought back in the fish car, a
task which involved infinite labor and care. The trip, on the whole, was
a highly successful one, and the relations established with Western
hunters and collectors are certain to prove of value to the Museum. The
car returned to Washington on November 8, having traveled over 7,000
miles.

In the summer of 1887 arrangements were made for a joint expedition
by the U.S. Fish Commission and the Smithsonian Institution to Funk
Island and the coast of Newfoundland. The Fish Commission tendered
the use of the schooner Grampus, which was to be engaged, under the
command of Capt. J. W. Collins, in the investigation of certain fishery
problems, and Messrs. F. A. Lucas and William Palmer were detailed
from the National Museum to accompany the expedition.

An examination of Funk Island was made, and a large number eof
bones of the Great Auk were collected, including several crania and
many hundred vertebre, and leg and wing bones. The coasts of New-
foundland, of New Brunswick, and the Magdalene Island and adjacent

“H. Mis. 142, pt. 2——6

82 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888

islands were also visited with a view to collecting specimens illustrat-
ing the fauna, flora, and geology of the regions. The collectors were
very successful. They secured about two hundred bird-skins, a large
series of birds’ eggs and nests, fishes, mammal skins and skeletons,
marine invertebrates, fossils, plants, rocks, and copper ores.

Interesting collections were received from Mr. Charles H. Townsend,
who visited Centrat America by direction of the U. S. Commissioner
of Fish and Fisheries. The material obtained included plants, a collec-
tion of bird-skins numbering over three hundred specimens, a collection
of tropical insects, a small collection of mammal skins, skulls, and
skeletons, bird skeletons, birds’ nests, fishes, reptiles, stone implements,
and twenty-seven ethnological objects.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 83

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM,
Washington, June 1, 1887.
SiR: TA addition to your regular duties, you will take charge of the Smithsonian
and Museum part of the Minneapolis Exposition, and represent me in all transactions
with the board of management, as may be necessary under joint resolution of Con-
gress (No. 18). You will confer with me only upon questions of general policy, re-
lieving me entirely of all matters of detail.
As representative to the exposition, it will be necessary for you, at its conclusion,
to submit a report on same.
Very respectfully,
G. BROWN GoopE,
Assistant Scerctary Smithsonian Institution,

in charge of U. S. National Museum.
Mrs Wi. Vi. Cox,

- Chief Clerk National Museum.

Mr. Fred. Brackett, Washington agent of the exposition, was as-
signed to the duty of collecting and forwarding to Minneapolis the
exhibits from the various Departments of the United States Govern-
ment, and of receiving these exhibits on their arrival at their destina-
tion. To Mr. Brackett’s efficient discharge of these services, both in
Washington and Minneapolis, much of the success which attended the
Government display at the exposition is due.

Before the Government exhibit left Washington the board of man-
agers of the exposition gave bond in. the sum of $5,000 for its safe-
keeping while it should be in their charge, and, in addition, allotted
$850 to cover the expense of preparation, packing, and repacking the
exhibit, and for freight charges both ways. The car-load of cases and
exhibits left Washington for Minneapolis August 22, but did not reach
its destination till August 26. By hard work, however, nearly the
entire exhibit—20,157 pounds—was in order and ready for exhibition
on the morning of August 31, the day of the opening of the exposi-
tion.

The immense building, 336 by 556 feet in size, with floor space of 74
acres, provided for the exhibition, proved insufficient for the general
display, and the managers found it necessary to assign smaller space to
the Government exhibits than had at first been allotted. A part of the
ladies’ reception-room was, however, finally partitioned off as an annex
to the space for the display of the Smithsonian Institution and the Na-
tional Museum, which may be briefly enumerated as follows :

I. Ethnological exbibit, including prehistoric relics of America, casts, lay figures,

models, etc. An extensive series of casts of Indian faces, Zuni objects, etc.
Il. Textiles and fabrics.
III. Display in the department of metallurgy.
IV. Deer antlers and horns.
V. Casts of fishes of North America. :

VI. Photographs of Government buildings.
VII. Articles illustrating the composition of the human body.

The ethnological display included relies of the prehistoric tribes of
America, together with a large collection of EKskimo and Indian ecos-
tumes, carved dishes, spoons, children’s toys, and a collection of the
a

musical instruments and of the various war implements of the savage
tribes of this and other countries; models and lay figures dressed in
the costumes of different lands; and an extensive series of casts of
Indian faces, representing and accentuating race and individual pecu-
liarities and characteristics.

In the section relating to domestic industry many of the agricultural
implements in daily use in foreign countries, especially in China and Ja-
pan, were shown; also articles of clothing, cooking utensils, chop-sticks,
carpenters’ tools, ete.

There were also exhibited tablets showing the different stages in mak-
ing Japanese lacquer-work of the ordinary kind, and of the raised gold
lacquer, with explanatory cards describing the same.

In the department of textiles and fabrics the exhibit ranged from
the different varieties of hemp, flax, China-grass, worsted yarn for car-
pet weaving, and specimens of the different styles of carpets, to sam-
ples of the finest Italian and French silk-weaving. This exhibit also
included silk moths and cocoons in the various stages of development,
many specimens of unwoven silk, and a historical sketch of the silk in-
dustry in America, indicating the sources and varieties of the different
grades of silk.

In the department of metallurgy were shown fac-similes of some of
the most famous Australian gold nuggets.

In the division of natural history the display of antlers and horns of
the American deer was extensive, and there were also shown many
casts of the fishes of North America, besides other objects.

Large photographs of the Department buildings in Washington, and
of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum, their laboratories
and workshops, were shown. There were also many interior views of
the Museum, displaying articles that could not otherwise be shown.

Articles illustrating the composition of the human body, its daily in-
come and expenditure, were exhibited, with specimens of the chemical
elements and compounds of the body, and models of the articles of food
constituting a day’s ration for a man of average size.

The entire Government exhibit proved to have been so selected and
arranged as to attract attention to all its parts in about an equal degree.
So much interest, in fact, was felt that the exposition management
made repeated requests to keep the articles for the following year. In
spite of the great desire manifested to insure another exhibit in 1888,
the entire Government property was returned in November, having suf-
fered no injury beyond the breaking of a few panes of glass in the cases.

Tam greatly indebted to Professor Mason for valuable assistance in
arranging the ethnological exhibits, and to Professor True for like aid
in selecting and classifying specimens in the department of mammals.
Mr. Upham aiso gave efficient help in the matter of prehistoric relics,
and Superintendent Horan and Assistant Superintendent Steuart were
untiring in the work of boxing, packing, shipping, and installing the
exhibit.

CURATORS OF THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

PROGRESS OF WORK DURING THE FISCAL YEAR
ENDING JUNE 30, 1888.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY IN THE U, 8, NATIONAL
MUSEUM, 1888,

By Orts T. Mason, Curator.

At the commencement of the year a new assingment of halls was
made, rendering it necessary to modify the distribution of specimens in
west hall. In pursuance of the Museum policy to find a significant
place for everything that has a name, three concepts of different values
have been worked out. At the east door all the material from various
sources used in transportation on land has been brought together, com-
mencing with the simplest device for carrying burdens by the human
(freight carrier) pack animal or for traveling over snow, and ending
with the locomotive. All this material, after its selection, was turned
over to Mr. Watkins, in charge of the new section of transportation.

Another method of treatment is seen in the Eskimo department, just
completed by the help of Lieut. T. Dix Bolles, U.S. Navy. Here the
primary and ruling concept is a definite and well characterized area.
All the conditions of life are written. The highest realizations of this
life are from home resources. In later years European wrecks and
European influences have brought iron, tobacco, rum, ete. But anterior
to this the Eskimo lived in his Arctic home as though there were no
other people on theearth. Inthe court devoted to this area each Eskimo
art is traced from Greenland to Kadiak by specimens. If the Museum
lacks example from any one of these, a vacant space is left and speci-
mens sought to supply the deficiency.

During the coming year the same attempt wili be made with the
region lying between Mount St. Elias and the Columbia River, the
Great Interior Basin, and Polynesia. j

Another line of investigation has been still more special and all the ma-
terial is arranged accordingly. Irefer to bows and arrows. The object
is to file away type bows and arrows from every tribe on earth, so that
they can be laid side by side for comparison or can be treated ethnically.
Shallow boxes 5 feet long, 2 inches deep, and 2, 4, and 6 inches wide
are made of thin pine, all interchangeable. These boxes fit in a crate
which in its turn fits on a shelf likea book. On the outer edge or back
of this crate may be pasted a label indicating the contents. It is just
as easy to refer to the arrows of a particular tribe as it would be to find

87
88 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

a reference in a volume. The plan of indicating deficiencies in the
series 18 the same asin the Kskimo collection.

Another line of work pushed forward during the year is the ethnic
series. The object of this exhibit is to show representatives of all the
races of men in the most exalted manner practicable. The simplest
form is the colored photo in front and profile, properly colored and shown
on swinging screens. Another mode of exhibiting is by means of casts
of the heads of Indians and others, arranged by a scheme of races or
figures in costume, either singly or in groups containing male and female
or families. During the year models of an Eskimo family, of a group
of Zunis, and of a group of Pai-Utes have been placed upon exhibition.

The most valuable local series acquired has been that of Paymaster
William J. Thomson, U.S. Navy, from the Easter Islands.

In connection with my work I glean from all sources the scraps of
valuable information which can be gathered from the books of travelers,
explorers, missionaries, commercial agents, etc. A regular system of
card cataloguing is used, each separate statement written on a distinct
slip and these placed in drawers, together with newspaper cuttings,
excerpts, and pamphlets relating to the same subjects.

Prof. G. Stanley Hall, of Johns Hopkins University, has made use
during the year of the resources of the collection, in investigating the
subject of mythology from the psycho-physical point of view, the pur-
pose of his studies being to trace the phases of hypnotism and kindred
phenomena known in our day to something akin in savagery and among
primitive people.

During the early months of the year much time was expended in pre-
paring a Series of specimens for the Minneapolis Exposition, and later,
a still greater display was prepared for Cincinnati.

Papers have been prepared for publication on the Quinaielt Indians
of Washington Territory, on the Stone Age in Washington Territory,
on the arts of the Navajo, and on the cradles of the American abo-
rigines.

Extensive exchanges of specimens have been effected with Mr. Lov-
ett, of England, and Professor Putnam, of Peabody Museum.

In a course of Saturday lectures delivered in the Museum the follow-
ing were on anthropological subjects:

Prof. HERBERT B. ADAMS: University Extension in England, Bal-
timore, and Washington.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES IN THE U, S,
NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888,

By Cyrus ADLER, Assistant Curator.

The Section of Oriential Antiquities of the U. S. National Museum
was formally organized on February 2, 1888, by the appointment of
Paul Haupt, Ph. D., professor of the Semitic languages in the Johns

‘Hopkins University as honorary curator, and of Cyrus Adler, Ph. D.,
instructor in Semitic languages at the same University, honorary assist-
ant curator.

The steps which led to the organization of this section were taken
almost a year previous. In March, 1887, a letter was addressed to the
late Prof. Spencer F. Baird, calling attention to the importance of Ori-
ental archeology, and more especially Assyriology, and recommending
that the National Museum add this to its numerous departments of
study and research. The illness and subsequent death of Professor
Baird delayed official action in the matter, but the work was tentatively
inaugurated at the beginning of the fiscal year.

In July, 1887, a portion of a collection of Assyrian and Babylonian
seals gathered by the late Rev. William Frederick Williams, an Ameri-
can missionary at Mosul, was placed at the disposal of the Museum for
copying purposes, by the present owners, Mr. R.S. Williams, of Utica,
Dr. G. H. Williams, of Baltimore, Mr. Talcott Williams, of Philadel-
phia, Miss C. D. Williams, Mr. P. V. Rogers, and Dr. A. G. Bower.

The Museum modelers were so successful in producing fac-similes_
and flat impressions of these objects that the following announcement
was made at the fail meeting of the American Oriental Society, held
at Baltimore in October, 1887:

The National Museum at Washington has undertaken the formation of a study-
collection of casts of Assyrian and Babylonian antiquities in association with the
Johns Hopkins University of Baltimore. The Museum stands ready to make fac-
similes and casts of Assyrian and Babylonian antiquities. An attempt is being made
to first obtain copies of Assyrian antiquities preserved in this country. The Johns
Hopkins University will attend to the proper arrangement and cataloguing of the

93
94 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Assyrian collection in the National Museum, under the supervision of Dr. Paul
Haupt, professor of Semitic languages, and Dr. Cyrus Adler, assistant in the Semi-
tic courses, who will also cooperate in the work of forming the collection and of
securing the loan of objects to be copied.*

Through the courtesy of the Rey. Dr. J. Packard, of the Episcopal
Theological Seminary at Alexandria, Virginia, the Museum was per-
mitted to make molds of two Assyrian slabs of alabaster in the posses-
sion of the Seminary, received in 1860 from Dr. H. B. Haskell, mission-
ary-physician at Mosul. .

Prof. A. Crawford, of the same institution, permitted the Museum
modelers to make a mold from his cast of the black obelisk of Shalman-
eser, and of the so-called Egg of Sargon I, for the Cincinnati Exposi-
tion, when it became evident that the British Museum could not fur-
nish these objects in time.

The Rev. A. N. Andrus, of Painesville, Ohio, sent for copy an Assy-
rian seal purchased in Mardin.

The entire month of June was devoted to preparations for a contri-
bution to the Ohio Valley Centennial Exhibition, to which the section of
Oriental Antiquities contributed an exhibit of Biblical archeology. This
special department of study was chosen becanse in the field of oriental
research Mesopotamian and EHegyptian antiquities, especially such as
bear upon the Bible, are of most interest to the public. By Biblical
archeology is understood the study of the language, history, social life,
arts, and religion of the Biblical nationalities. This study is not a part
of dogmatic theology ; its results can command the same acceptance
accorded to anew fact reported from,a physical laboratory; its prob-
lems should be faced in the same spirit of fearless investigation into
the truth as obtains in other departments of scientific research.
Through it the Bibie becomes, in its form and to some extent in its sub-
stance, a new book. Many an allusion which hitherto had no meaning
or had Jain unnoticed, starts into prominence and throws a light over a
whole passage.t Nor are these investigators entirely confined to the
ancient world. Owing to theintense conservatism of oriental peoples,
a careful study of the modern inhabitants of western Asia may exhibit
in a new aspect the manners and customs of former times.

Proper names, dialectic forms, architecture, costumes, and, what is

more surprising, considering the numerous changes of faith which cul-
 minated in Mohammedanism, even religious practices have persisted in
the East through thousands of years. As there may be some objection
to the application of the term “‘ archeology ” to so broad a field, it might
perhaps be better if the more comprehensive term “ Biblical science ”
were employed to designate this study. Nor is the area covered less

extensive than the period of time. Roughly speaking, it would require
that one point of a compass be placed in Jerusalem, and a radius of a
thousand miles be selected to describe a circle which would include all of
the peoples with whom the Israelites came in contact during their na-
tional existence. On this basis an exhibit was prepared which will be
fully described in a special paper in the next annual report.

In March, Professor Haupt, under the auspices of the Saturday Lect-
ure Association, delivered a lecture in the National Museum on Exca-
vations in Assyria and Babylonia, portions of which are appended as
being explanatory of the objects of the new department. The lecture
was illustrated by charcoal drawings of the Rock of Behistun, of the
sculptures it contains, and a plan of the ‘ Tower of Babel,” prepared and

colored after the description given in the lecture.

EXCAVATIONS IN ASSYRIA AND BABYLONIA.

By Pror. Paut Haupt, Pu. D.

On the old highway from Babylon to Media, in the region which the
ancients called Bagistana, the abode of the gods, there rises, 1,700 feet
above the plain, a steep and precipitous rock, the front overlaid with
polished white marble, covered with reliefs of colossal figures. Nine
men, a rope around their necks, their hands fastened behind their backs,
approach a majestic person, treading under foot the body of a prostrate
enemy, and extending his left hand with an imperious gesture. Over
the whole group hovers Auramazda, the Persian god of light, blessing
the king and offering a royal diadem.

Ktesias, the Greek physician of Artaxerxes IT, aftributed the monu-
ment to the fabulous queen Semiramis; and at the beginning of this
century Sir Robert Ker Porter, the famous English traveler, believed
that the sculptures represented Tiglathpileser and the ten tribes, while
Keppler explained them to be Queen Esther and her attendants.

The French Government sent the architects Coste and Flandin to
examine the monument and copy the inscription of four hundred lines
in cuneiform or wedge-shaped characters. But they returned with their
purpose unaccomplished, stating that the monuments, ee 300 feet
above the ground, were inaccessible.

In the years 1835 to 1837 Sir Henry Rawlinson, then a young officer
in the East India service, succeeded, in the face of unspeakable diffi-
culties, and at an expense of more than £1,000, in copying a portion of
the inscriptions. Not until ten years later was he enabled to complete
his copy. In 1846 he published the first explanation of the inscription,
which commemorates the victories gained by the great Persian king
Darius Hystaspes over the rebels in the numerous provinces of his vast
empire. It is composed in three different languages. Just as the gov-
ernor of Bagdad in our days, if he wishes to be understood by the vari-
ous races under his charge, has to draw up his edicts in Turkish, Arabic,

and Persian, so the inscriptions of the Achemenian kings were accom-
panied by parallel translations of the old Persian original, one for the
inhabitants of Susiana, the Elam of Scripture, the other in a language
akin to modern Arabic and the sacred tongue of the Old Testiment, rep-
resenting the speech of the Persian province of Assyria, formerly the
center of the great Mesopotamian empire, which had succumbed to the
Persian conquerors after the fall of Babylon.

The trilingual inscriptions on the rock of Behistun are the foundation
of the grand edifice erected by Assyriology out of the rubbish of the
Assyrian palaces and the temples of Babylon.

The decipherment of the old Persian wedge-writing in 1802, one of
the most remarkable achievements of modern science, due to the genius
of a young instructor at the college of Gottingen, George Frederick
Grotefend, made it possible to solve the mystery of the parallel versions,
in the languages of Elam and Mesopotamia.

At first the study of these texts in the intricate Assyro Babylonian
script promised but little reward. But suddenly the excavations in the
valley of the Euphrates and Tigris revealed numerous inscriptions ex-
hibiting the same system of writing, thus rewarding the decipherment of
the old Persian cuneiform texts in a way not dreamed of. Stamped on
bricks in the walls of the building, buried on clay prisms and barrel
cylinders, in the foundations of temples and palaces, spread over marble
and alabaster slabs, on the floors and walls of the royal apartments,
carved on statues, obelisks, and colossal cherubim, inscribed on terra-
cotta tablets, gathered into extensive libraries—a new literature, almost
boundless in its extent and scope, was recovered from the ruins of ages.

Nineveh, the great stronghold on the Tigris, founded by Nimrod, the
mighty hunter before the Lord; Nineveh, of which the Prophet Nahum
said that she was fnll of men like a pool full of water, her merchants

multiplied above the stars of heaven; Nineveh, the abode of Shalmane- -

ser, Sennacherib, Sardanapalus, whence poured forth over all western
Asia the irresistible Assyrian hosts like swarms of locusts; Nineveh,
which seemed to have vanished from the face of the earth, a desolation
for beasts to lie down in, was awakened to new life by the spade of the
explorer and the penetration of the decipherers. The authentic witnesses
of old Assyrian history and culture were freed from their subterraneous
dungeon, their tongues loosened to living words.

As at the beginning of this century the sepulchres of the Pharaohs had
disclosed their secrets, so the palaces of Nineveh, the walls and towers
of Babel, arose from the ruins beneath which they had lain buried for
more than two thousand years. In the valley of the Euphrates and
Tigris, which had watered Paradise, the abode of the first parents of
mankind, where the great flood burst forth, where Nimrod founded his
first kingdom, where the great Tower of Babel stood, whence the Lord
confounded the language of mankind, scattering them abroad over the
face of the whole earth, in the home of Abraham, the birth-place of the

chosen people, on the sacred soil of man’s earliest traditions, the tire-
less explorers unearthed extensive records of Nebuchadnezzar and Bel-
shazzar, the account of the Tower of Babel, which the great Babylonian
king restored, the annals of Sennacherib, with his campaign against
Hezekiah of Judah.

And of Sennacherib’s father, Sargon, who led Israel into captivity,
monuments still more wonderful were in store for the explorer. Paul
Emile Botta, French consul at Mosul, between the years 1842 and 1845,
disinterred the entire residence of this great Assyrian king, including
temple, observatory, palace with the harem, store-houses, even the
bakery and the wine-cellar. From his trenches and tunnels the French
archeologist saw himself transported, as by magic, to the magnificent
halls whence three thousand years ago half the world was ruled. He
beheld the awful figure of the conqueror of Samaria, seated on his
throne or standing in his chariot; saw his vassals worshiping before
him, saw his exploits in war, his adventures in the chase, his banquets ;
he walked with the Assyrian gods and in the assembly of their priests,
and all that presented itself to his marveling eye was as vivid, as real,
as if Sargon’s court had beeit quickened from the dead.

The fruits of these extensive excavations were transported in 1846
to France, where they now ornament the Paris Louvre.

At about the same time Austen Henry Layard uncovered in the
mounds of Kouyundjik and Nebi Yunus, opposite Mosul, the site of
ancient Nineveh, palaces of Shalmaneser, Tiglathpileser, Sennacherib,
Esarhaddon, and Sardanapalus. Countless sculptures and inscriptions,
weapons, helmets, trappings, tools, weights, furniture, vases, jewels,
objects of bronze and ivory, were brought to light and transferred to
the last asylum of so many a lost race, the British Museum, filling there
five large galleries; while before Layard’s labors a case scarcely 3 feet
square inclosed al! that remained, not only of the great city, Nineveh,
but of Babylon itself.

In 1854 Hormuzd Rassam, working under Layard’s directions, dis-
covered in a palace of Sardanapalus, at Nineveh, the greatest treas-
ure of Assyriology, the library of the last Assyrian king; thousands of
terra-cotta tablets, inscribed with minute cuneiform characters, con-
taining historical records and chronological statements; letters, dis-
patches, reports, addresses, and petitions; deeds, bonds, and contracts ;
hymns, psalms, prayers, songs, and proverbs; lists of gods and their
temples; incantations, charms, and omen tablets; lists of countries,
cities, rivers, canals, mountains, stars, animais, plants, minerals; gram-
matical texts, including paradigms, vocabularies, list of characters, exer-
cises in both Assyrian and the language of the primitive inhabitants of
the country, the so-calied Sumero-Akkadian; mathematical works, cal-
culations, tables of measures of length, of cube and square roots; as-
tronomical observations, calendars—every conceivable branch of litera-
sure being represented.

While thirty years agothere was hardly an ancient monarchy shrouded
in deeper obscurity than the Mesopotamian Empire, we are now more
familiar with the Assyrians than with any other nation of the ancient
East.

After Layard’s return from Mesopotamia the excavations were con-
tinued by Sir Henry Rawlinson, the geologist William Kennet Loftus,
and the British vice-consul at Basra, John EH. Taylor.

Loftus uncovered the ruins of Warka, the Erech of Nimrod, and Sen-
kereh, the ancient Larsa or Ellassar, whose king, Arioch, was smitten by
Abraham in the Vale of Siddim. And in the ancient Babylonian home
of Abraham, Ur of the Chaldees, the present Mugheir, John H. Tayler
disinterred the great temple of the Moon-God. In the four corners of
the sanctuary he discovered four copies of the famous cylinder inserip-
tion in which the last king of Babylon, Nabonidus, prays to the Moon-
God to fix the awe of his great divinity firmly in the heart of the king’s
first-bora son, Belshazzar, that he may never fall into sin.

But these sites of South Babylonia are still virgin soil; Loftus and
Taylor had neither the time nor the necessary assistance to undertake
systematic researches. Since 1854, when Laylor spent two weeks at
Mugheir, Ur of the Chaldees has not been visited by asingle explorer.

While Loftus and Taylor were engaged at Erech and Ur, the French
Government sent an expedition to Babylonia under the direction of
Fresnel, the architect Thomas, and the young German orientalist, Julius
Oppert, at present the most distinguished Assyriologist of France,
whose works on the Assyro-Babylonian inscriptions were afterwards
rewarded by the great national prize of 20,000 francs, as ‘‘ the discovery
which had brought France the highest honor and the greatest profit.”
The French expedition remained in Babylonia for three years, making
especially a thorough topographical survey of the ruins; but the price-
less collection of antiquities, including cylinders, urns, and alabaster
vases, statues, gold and silver objects, was sunk in the waters of the
Tigris on the 23d of May, 1855, owing to a deplorable accident, or, as
others termed it, sheer carelessness and mismanagement, while Julius
Oppert pleasantly speaks of these antiquities as ‘the collection of
which the river Tigris has made itself the temporary curator.”

New interest was excited in 1872, when the clever young English
Assyriologist, George Smith, discovered the cuneiform account of the
Deluge. Among the fragments from the library of Sardanapalus treas-
ured up in the British Museum he lighted upon half of a curious terra-
cotta tablet containing the words ‘the ship rested upon the mountain of
Nizir; then I sent forth a dove; the dove went and returned, and finding
no resting place, she came back to the ship.” He recognized at once
that he had found a portion of the Chaldean account of the Flood, and
with unwearied patience he set himself to search for the remainder of
the story. Hesucceeded in obtaining quite a number of additional frag-
ments, and made out that the Flood tablet formed the episode of a great
4

SECTION OF ORIENWAL ANTIQUITIES. 99

epic of early Chaldea, now generally known by the name of the Baby-
lonian Nimrod Epic, which celebrates in twelve cantos, corresponding
with the signs of the zodiac, the exploits of the ancient king of Erech.

The Chaldean account of the Deluge is especially valuable in as much
as it proves that the Biblical story of the Flood is the echo of an his-
torical fact. The great geologist, Edward Suess, one of the leading
politicians of Vienna, has shown in a special monograph, prepared with
my co-operation some years since, that the catastrophe known by the
name of the Deluge happened on the Lower Euphrates, involving an
extensive and devastating inundation of the lower part of Mesopotamia,
the essential cause being a great earthquake in the region of the Per-
sian Gulf, or farther down south, preceded by several slight shocks.
And it is very probable that during the period of the heaviest shocks
a cyclone moved northward out of the Persian Gulf. Certainly the tra-
ditions of other peoples in no way justify the assumption that the Flood
extended beyond the regions of the Lower Euphrates and Tigris, let
alone that it was a universal inundation.

Smith gave the first translation of the Flood tablet and an account
of the Nimrod Epic in a lecture delivered before the London Society of
Biblical Archeology on the 3d of December, 1872. His find attracted
such widespread attention that the editor-in-chief of the London Daily
Telegraph, Mr. Edwin Arnold, came forward and offered George Smith
a thousand guineas for fresh researches at Nineveh, to recover more of
these invaluable tablets. Smith started at once, and his efforts were
crowned with success. The first day, immediately after his arrival, he
found a new fragment of the Flood tablet, containing the command to
build the ark, and not far from it, in the same trench, a piece of the
Babylonian account of the Creation. A whole cuneiform series of par-
allel legends to the early chapters of the first book of Moses was brought
to light and given to the world by George Smith in his admirable work,
‘The Chaldean Account of Genesis.”

Twice again Smith went to Assyria. In 1875 he acquired a collection
of three thousand clay tablets which Arabs had found in large stone
jars near the ruins of Babylon. These stone jars represented the safe
of a great Jewish banking house, Egibi & Sons, ¢. ¢., Jacob, in Babylo-
nian pronunciation. The business transactions of the Babylonian court
had been intrusted to this firm for centuries, ever since the time of
Nebuchadnezzar. We see all the various classes, from the highest offi-
cer down to the lowest slave, thronging the courts of this great finan-
cial establishment, thus unrolling for us a vivid picture of ancient
Babylonian life.

When George Smith sojourned in Mesopotamia for the third time he
was forced back by an outbreak of the oriental plague at Bagdad. He
never returned to his native land. A premature death cut short his
brilliant career. On the 19thof August, 1876, he expired, at Aleppo.

After this sad bereavement, keenly felt by all interested in Biblical
100 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

research, Hormuzd Rassam, who had assisted Sir Austen Henry Layard
at the discovery of Nineveh in 1845, was designated by the British
Museum to conduct the excavations.

Since then he has three times revisited the Mesopotamian sites, mak-
ing new discoveries of great importance. In Nimrud, the site of the
ancient Chalah, he excavated a great temple of King Assurnacirpal,
the father of Shalmaneser IJ, and 9 miles northeast of Nineveh he suc-
ceeded in disinterring the famous bronze ornaments from the palace
gates of Balawat. In the east part of the mound of Balawat he un-
earthed another temple of King Assurnagirpal. Near the altar was
found an alabaster coffer containing two alabaster tablets, a third stone
tablet with the same inscription being deposited on the altar. The
discovery called forth a tremendous excitement in Mosul and the sur-
rounding villages. Like wild fire the rumor spread that the Mosaic
stone tables of the Covenant had been brought to light; just as the
Arabs, when the first colossal head of one of the winged bulls was un-
earthed in 1845, came running to Sir Henry Layard, urging their mares
to the top of their speed, and exclaiming: ‘‘ Hasten, Bey; hasten to the
diggers, for they liave found Nimrod himself. Wallah, it is wonderful,
but itis true ; we have seen him with our owneyes. Ld ilaha illa huwa ;
there is no God but He, the living, the eternal.” During his last expe-
dition, undertaken in the years 1880~’81 and extending over eighteen
months, Rassam discovered the archives of the ancient temple of the
Sun-God of Sippar, the Biblical Sepharvaim, one of the oldest Baby-
lonian cities, where the god Ea, or Kronos, bade the Chaldean Noah
bury the records of the time before the Flood.

Excavating in the ruins of Sippar, now represented by the site of
Abu-Habbah, midway between Babylon and Bagdad, he came across a
great square edifice, and beneath the floor of one of the rooms he dis-
covered an alabaster coffer with numerous tablets, one of them contain-
ing a curious sculpture representing the Holy of Holies, the Sun-God
seated on a magnificent throne ornamented with cherubim, and grasp-
ing in his hand a short wand and ring, the symbol of eternity.

Rassam also examined again the palaces of Sennacherib at Nineveh,
recovering from the ruined library more than fourteen hundred new terra-
cotta fragments. And in one of the walls of the palace he found a new
decagon or clay prism, more than a cubit high, and containing in twelve
hundred lines of cuneiform writing the annals of the last great king of
Assyria, Sardanapalus. In the northeast corner of the terrace of the
tower of Babel he discovered the palace occupied by Nabonidus during
the siege of Babylon by Cyrus, and the British Museum subsequently
acquired the cuneiform annals of the last Babylonian king, relating to
the capture of Babylon by Cyrus and the events which preceded and led
toit. Amongst many other things brought by Rassam from the excava-
tions at Babylon, for instance a bronze door-sill whose metal even now
represents a value of more than $400, there was also a clay cylinder of
SECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES. 101

Cyrus, containing an account of the taking of Babylon, and giving the
genealogy of the great king. Sir Henry Rawlinson says that it is per-
haps the most interesting cuneiform document that has been yet dis-
covered.

While Rassam was digging in North Babylonia, under the auspices of
the British Museum, M. Ernest de Sarzec, the French vice-consul at
Basra, near the mouth of the Euphrates and Tigris, found in the ruins
of Telloh, on the canal Shatt-el- Hai, a number of colossal statues, four
standing and four seated, covered with archaic inscriptions of the ancient
Chaldean king Gudea, who reigned about four thousand years B. C.
One of the seated figures holds on the knees a diagram with a plan of a
city or fortress, and an accurate rule. The collection, which is exceed-
ingly important for the history of early Chaldean art, was purchased for
the Louvre at a price of 150,000 frances, and forms a most valuable addi-
tion to the Paris antiquities from Mesopotamia.

But since these remarkable discoveries were made all digging on the
Mesopotamian sites has practically come to a stop. There is a strong
opposition now on the part of the Turkish authorities to archeological
research by agents of European countries. The superintendent of the
British excavations himself states that the attitude assumed by the
British Government in the Egyptian difficulty has alienated the’good
feeling of the Sublime Porte towards the English, and the Sultan not
caring to grant them any favors, everything has gone against them
And France, as well as the other continental puwers, is not able to
take up this scientific mission.

Now I should like to ask, is not America called upon to step in
here? During the last few years Assyrian studies have made such
great progress in this country that the eminent French archeologist and
chief-justice of the supreme court of Rouen, M. Joachim Menant, in a
recent work reviewing the development of Assyriology, declares that
the most serious efforts in this line are concentrated in America. There
are more specialists in this branch of Biblical philology here than in
England, and I venture to assert that they are not inferior to the Eng-
lish. Harvard, Yale, Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania,
Princeton, Johns Hopkins, and other universities, as well as various
theological seminaries in New York, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, An-
dover, Newton Centre, etc., recognizing the importance of these investi-
gations, have appointed professors of Assyriology, who have gathered
around themselves a band of zealous workers.

It can be confidently stated that if a national expedition, composed
of delegates from all these various institutions of learning, enjoying the
enlightened protection of the United States Government, and supported
by all who take an interest in the history of their religion, could be sent
from this country, it would yield excellent results, whose publication in
@ monumental work, under the auspices of our great national institu-
tion for the increase and diffusion of knowledge, would be a lasting
102 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

memorial of American scientific enterprise and scholarship. Every-
thing that is necessary for such an undertaking is here—self-denying en-
thusiasm, facing all dangers; thorough preparation, insuring suecess—
a fertile field for investigation, promising rich results; a magnificent
Museum, making accessible to the general public the treasures recov-
ered—everything is here. All we need is a fund.

I trust we shall not have to wait until it is too late. In a few years
political complications in the East may render it impossible to recover
any of these treasures.

For systematic excavations in the ruins of some ancient Babylonian
cities, especially in the home of Abraham, Ur of the Chaldees, the
present Mugheir, on the right bank of the Euphrates, near the junction
with the canal Shatt-el-Hai, it would be necessary to employ about six
hundred Arab laborers, under the supervision of a scientific staff com-
posed of about twelve persons, one-half Assyriological specialists from
various American universities and seminaries, and the others, as far
as possible, officers of the U.S. Army and Navy, including one or two
engineers, a surgeon, an architect, a photographer, and a business man-
ager, who might at the same time act as reporter and paymaster. The
expenses of the members of the staff would be about $5 a day, and
the daily wages for the native laborers about 20 cents, so that if the
expedition started from Europe about September 1, and conducted sys-
tematic excavations in Babylonia for half a year, the total cost of the
expedition would be about $40,000—one-half wages for the diggers,
and an equal amount for the expenses of twelve members of the staff,
their outfit in clothing, bedding, arms, saddles, etc., the passage to
Europe and thence to Beirut, the caravan from Beirut to Bagdad, which
would be under way for about fifty days, and finally, six months’ stay in
Babylonia.

In view of the importance of the undertaking it may be expected that
the various institutions represented on the staff of the expedition will
defray the personal expenses of their delegates, which would amount
to about $2,000 in each case; so all we need is a fund of $20,000 for the
excavations. If some public-spirited person should feel inclined to
present this amount he would be sure of grateful recognition on the part
of the whole civilized world. The expedition would go out under his
_ name, and the collection, to be transferred to the National Museum, as
well as the great monumental work embodying the results of all the
investigations, would forever be distinguished by his name. Every
single piece, too, of the thousands of sculptures and inscriptions would
be marked and always referred to by scholars all over the world as Y.—

I presume very few people in this country are aware what vast busi-
ness interests are connected with the exploration of Mesopotamia.
There is, for instance, the projected Euphrates Valley Railroad, between
Alexandretta, on the Mediterranean, and Basra, on the Persian Gulf, a
SECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES, 103

distance of about 920 miles, the cost of which would be about $36,000,000;
that is, estimated at the high rate of $40,000 per mile. Sir William
Andrew, in a remarkable lecture delivered before the National Club of
London in 1882, states that it is not too much to say that no existing
or projected railroad can compare in point of interest and importance
with that of the Euphrates Valley. It would be the shortest and cheap-
est route to India, saving about 1,000 miles in the distance between
England and India, thus reducing the time occupied by the journey to
ten days instead of twenty, and it would tend in a great measure to a
peaceful solution of the Eastern question, affording an additional guar-
anty for the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. It would promote com-
nierce, civilization, and Christianity, the progress, the freedom, and the
peace of the world.

The Porte had once promised a guaranty of 6 per cent. on the esti-
mated expenditure, and I dare say the English Government would be
willing to give an adequate guaranty at any time. The advances made
by Russia in Asia imperatively demand the construction of an alterna-
tive route to India. The Suez Canal might easily be rendered useless
through a few dynamite explosions, or the sinking of a ship, for months,
and perhaps for a year.

The section of the Euphrates Valley Railroad between Bagdad and-
Alexandretta would pay exceedingly well. There are about ten thou-
sand camels employed now in traffic between Bagdad and Aleppo, and
the price of conveying goods at present by camels and mules between
Aleppo and Alexandretta is from 15 to 25 cents per ton per mile. The
local traffic already existing in the country to be traversed would cer-
tainly more than suffice to pay the ordinary interest on this section.
The opening of the Euphrates Valley Railroad would be a great step
towards a recolonization and recivilization of Mesopotamia, looked upon
from the earliest times as among the richest countries in the world. It
has recently been shown by a most competent person that Mesopotamia,
after a restoration of the famous ancient system of irrigation, on which
the whole welfare of the country depends, and a national recultivation
of the incredibly fertile soil, might yield an annual revenue of five hun-
dred millions. That is not based on the imagination of an enthusiastic
Assyriologist, but on sobercalculations. I mention this simply to show
that there are other things to be had in Mesopotamia than Biblical an-
tiquities.

The Babylonian expedition might lay the foundation of a national in-
stitution similar to the American school at Athens, and we have al-
ready a place in the East which would be most appropriate as the per-
manent headquarters of this American school of Biblical archeology—I
mean the American college at Beirut. Thousands of dollars are sent
from this country to England every year for the Egypt exploration
fund. I can not conceive of any reason why American contributions
should go to support explorations under British auspices. If the Amer-
104 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

ican representatives of Biblical archeology found an adequate pecun-
iary assistance for their national undertaking we could soon have in
Washington one of the finest collections of the world.

It has been very cleverly said that archeology is like the giant An-
tacus in the Greek myth; we develop in strength as often as we come
in contact with the ground. I sincerely hope that we shail be able to
begin digging at no distant date. People in Europe would hardly be-
lieve that we have everything for a national expedition to Mesopotamia
savethe money. Such a project appeals to every one who takes an in-
terest in the dawn of civilization and the history of religion. The mon-
uments in the valley of the Euphrates and Tigris furnish the key to
countless mysteries in the early history of man. They answer a multi-
tude of questions whose solution is indispensable for a study of the de-
velopment of religion and culture. They add new leaves to the book of
man’s earliest traditions. They confirm and elucidate the sacred records ~
of the Old Testament. Chaldea is the cradle of the great race of Israel,
the birth-place of his ancestors. ‘To Chaldea we can trace the roots of
his nationality and his religion, and indirectly the roots of Christianity.
If we wish to have some knowledge of the primitive period in which the
chosen people developed, we must dig for it in Assyria and Babylonia.

It is true we can not recover gold, as the natives fancy. A treasure
of Priam will never be found in the sterile mounds of Mesopotamia. All
that we can unearth aresculptures and inscriptions, nothing but stones,
broken stones, but stones to which the word of Scripture applies: “If
men should hold their peace the stones wiil cry out.”
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF AMERICAN ABORIGINAL POTTERY
IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

By WiLu1AM H. Hoimus, Honorary Curator.

The work of cataloguing and installing the great collection of abo-
riginal pottery is practically completed; as a consequence little has
been done during the past year save to properly care for new accessions.
A brief statement of the additions is given below. This listincludes all
material received by the Museum directly, as well as all collections
made by the Bureau of Ethnology.

Through the collections made by the official agents of the Bureau of
Ethnology, 609 numbers have been added to the catalogue; through
exchanges, 2; through purchase, 304; and through donation, 20.

Four collections of considerable importance have been received by the
Bureau of Ethnology and will soon be formally turned over to the Mu-
seum. One of these is from the pueblos of Jemez Valley, New Mexico,
by James Stevenson; one from the Cherokee and Catawba Indians of
North Carolina, by James Mooney; a third from Chiriqui, South Amer-
ica, by J. A. MeNiel; and a fourth from Mexico, by Ward Bachelor.

The only researches made by the curator have been a study of the
origin and significance of the textile ornament upon the pottery of the
eastern United States, and a study made in the field of the relation of
the ancient and recent ceramic remains of northern New Mexico. The
former paper was read before the Anthropological Society of Washing-
ton and will probably be published by the Bureau of Ethnology, and
the latter study is not yet ready for presentation.

The last catalogue number of June, 1887, is 132955. The last cata-
logue number of June, 1888, is 134497.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

By J. ELFRETH WATKINS, Curator.

During the first half of the fiscal year, while serving as honorary cura-
tor, I was able, through the courtesy of the officials of the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company, to spend such time as I could be spared from my
duties in their service in the developement of the Section of Steam
Transportation. Owing to the limited time at my command little was
accomplished. Having become permanently connected with the Mu-
seum staff in December, 1887, increased space was assigned to the sec-
tion at the east end of the east hall, early in January. Shortly after-
wards the scope of the section was enlarged, with the designation of
the Section of Transportation and Engineering.

It is the aim of the Section of Transportation and Engineering to
present an object lesson that shall illustrate and preserve the history
of the devices man has used, the structures he has built, and the ma-
chines he has invented to promote travel and commerce and to convey
intelligence. Appliances used to generate power for manufacture, and
to produce heat and light, and others of a similar nature are tempora-
rily assigned to this section.

The science of engineering has been so intimately connected with and
interwoven in the development of the art of transportation, especially

_of late years, that the problems presenting themselves to the projectors
of railways and the constructors of steam-ships have evolved several
distinct branches of engineering especially devoted to their solution.

Since inventive genius has generally followed in chronological se-
quence, the system of arrangement to show development step by step
which prevails in the other departments of the Museum is particularly
applicable to this section.

Early in his existence, doubtless in prehistoric times, man’s attention
was directed to travel, as he was was compelled to use his intelligence
from the beginning to aid him to surmount the obstacles in the journeys
which his physical necessities required him to make.

Aboriginal methods of utilizing muscular force (in burden-bearing
and human and animal traction) and the power of the wind and wave

are placed at the beginning of the series devoted to transportation, of

which the machines and structures devised by the modern engineer to
accelerate locomotion and facilitate conveyance are the culmination.

It is believed that in museum administration no similar attempt has
previously been made to preserve by monuments the history of the
development of the appliances that man’s genius has contributed to-
wards the creation of the grand chains of intercommunication, the ex-
tension of which, link by link, has exercised so potent an influence in
accelerating our national growth, increasing our prosperity, and devel-
oping our civilization.

A number of objects which had previously been under the charge of
the curator of the Department of Ethnology were transferred to this
section early in the year. Among these are: Eskimo skin carrying
bags; Indian carrying baskets and meat cases; square cane-seat carry-
ing chair; a Madagascar carrying chair or “ filanzana” and a Chinese
palanquin made of bamboo; several Indian saddles covered with raw-
hide; two elegant saddles which formerly belonged to the King of
Siam, with bridle and reins; fine saddle presented to the President of
the United States by the Tycoon of Japan, 1861, and an elephant sad-
dle (howdah) from India; several dog sledges used by the Eskimo and
other northern Indians; sledges from Alaska; a reindeer, sled, and
mounted life-size figure of Laplander, from the University of Christi-
ania, Norway; the Red River cart; cart from Siam; caretta or ox-
wagon from New Mexico; specimens of harness, lassoes, and lariats
made by the Eskimos and other Indians of various tribes, together
with fine drosky harness from Russia, harness from Portugal, Mexico,
and South America, whips from Hayti, and saddle-bags from Daghis-
tan; snow-shoes of many types; sledges and toboggans.

Among the more important accessions of the year are: A model
(full size) of the locomotive “Stourbridge Lion,” a gift from the Dela-
ware and Hudson Canal Company. This model of the first locomotive
that turned a driving-wheel (August, 1829) on a railroad constructed
for traffic on the Western Continent has additional historical value
from the fact that it was an important object in the Constitutional
Centennial Celebration at Philadelphia in September, 1887, in the series
illustrating the progress in the art of transportation during the first
century of the nation’s existence under the Constitution.

In addition to this valuable model, the Delaware and Hudson Canal
Company have also donated four of the original driving-wheel tires,
three crank centers, and one of the walking-beams which belonged to
the “Stourbridge Lion.” It is the intention to place these in proper
position on the model as soon as practicable.

Another valuable accession is the original multi-tubular locomotive
boiler, constructed by John Stevens, 1825, for his experimental locomo-
tive, which ran for several years (1825-’27) on a circular experimental
track at Hoboken, New Jersey, deposited by the authorities of the
Stevens Institute, Hoboken, New Jersey.
SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING 109

The largest and most important accession of the year was received
from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, through the kindness
of President Spencer and Col. James Randolph, consulting engineer ;
this deposit consisted of a series of ten models, among them being—

A model (half size) of Peter Cooper’s experimental locomotive
“Tom Thumb.” This locomotive was experimented with on the Balti-
more and Ohio Railroad on August 28, 1830, near Baltimore. The tubes
in the boiler were made of gun barrels.

A model of the horse-power treadmill car, experimented with on the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1830.

A model of a sail car, experimented with in the summer of 1830 on
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad near Baltimore.

A model (half size) of the Grasshopper locomotive * Arabian.” Lo-
comotives of this type were introduced on the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-
road in 1831, and were in use for many years.

A model of the passenger car designed by Peter Cooper for the Bal-
timore and Ohio Railroad Company in 1839.

A model of a passenger “ stage-body” coach, in use on the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad in 1830, and for several years after it was opened for
traffic.

A model of the closed passenger coaches on the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad, which were first put in use in 1831.

Among the relics illustrating progress in the art of track building
the following may be noted: An original cast tram rail, from the track
from Penydarren Works to Glamorgan Canal, near Aberdare J unction,
Wales, upon which Trevithick’s first locomotive, to help man, ran in
1804. Gift of J. W. Widdowson, of London, England.

An original long stone sill and strap rail, from Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad. Laid in 1829. Gift of Col. James Randolph, consulting
engineer, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company.

An original stone block and section of rail and joint from the Camden
and Amboy Railroad, laid in 1831. Gift of the curator.

A model of the track of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad with f rail,
several miles of which were built by that company, 1844-45. Depos-
ited by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company.

Pennsylvania Railroad standard, 1888 (model), showing standard
track, with stone ballast, angle splice-bars, ditches, etc. Gift of the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company, through Joseph T. Richards, assist-
ant chief engineer.

The following important accessions illustrating improvements in the
appliances for marine propulsion were also received: Original patent»
granted to John Fitch, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by Louis XVI,
King of France, November 29, 1791, for his inventions for propelling
boats by steam. This, the original document, was discovered at the
destruction of the Libraire Nationale by the Commune in 1873. Itis
the gift of John C. Lang, Washington, District of Columbia.

As the log of the voyage of this vessel from Savannah (May 22, 1519),
under command of Capt. Moses Rogers, to Liverpool (June 20, 1819),
is in the collection, this contemporaneous lithograph is of particular
value.

The original steam steering-engine (the first ever made) applied to
the steamer Augusta, 1859, a gift of F. E. Sickle, the inventor, is a most
interesting relic.

Contemporaneous lithograph of the Kk. #. Stockton, the first steam-
vessel with iron hull or screw-propeller to cross the Atlantic, and a
piece of the original iron hull. Gift of the curator.

On the 28th of May I was directed by the Assistant Secretary, in
charge U. S. National Museum, to prepare a series of models, drawings,
etc., illustrating the history of transportation, for the exposition at
Cincinnati, and during the remainder of the fiscal year my attention
was entirely devoted to that subject.

A catalogue of the objects forwarded to that exposition will be pre-
sented in the next annual report.

The following is a brief outline of the classification adopted :

Class .—From the Atlantic to the Ohio Valley: Methods adopted
by the aborigines and early settlers. This class contained objects of
special local interest to the residents of the Ohio Valley and of the old
Northwest Territory.

Class 11.— Development of the American locomotive: This class was
divided into two series. Series No.1 included only such locomotives as
were either built in the United States or imported from England for
service ou our railroads. The methods of construction of many of the
locomotives included in the series of foreign locomotives (No. 2) were,
however, closely studied by the early locomotive builders in the United
States, who, in some cases, sent representatives abroad to investigate
and report upon the locomotives being built there. Many of these re-
ports found their way into the American journais devoted to invention,
and in some cases were published in book form, and thus had such im-
portant bearing upon the “ development of the American locomotive”
that a failure to make reference to them would leave the chain of inven-
tion deficient in many links.

Class IIT.—Development of the American passenger Car.

Class IV.—Development of the American rail and track.

Class V.—Development of the American steam-boat and modern
steam-ship.
SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING. at

Class VI.—Maps showing extensions of railway system in the United
States.

Class VI1.—Methods of transportation in other countries.

As this is the first attempt in the history of expositions to tell the
story of the development, step by step, of our great systems of transpor-
tation by series of models, drawings, and relics, the interest manifested
in the subject by those to whom I applied for assistance was most grat-
ifying. Had I not received their hearty co-operation little could have
been accomplished in the brief time allotted to the task.

The cordial thanks of the Museum are hereby extended to President
Spencer and Col. James Randolph, of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-
road; to Joseph T. Richards, assistant chief engineer, and W. J.
Latta, general agent, Pennsylvania Railroad Company, Philadelphia;
to Messrs. Burnham, Parry, Williams & Co., proprietors of the Bald-
win Locomotive Works; Harper Bros., New York City; Francis B.
Stevens, civil engineer, Hoboken, New Jersey; and Dr. Henry Mor-
ton, president of Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New
Jersey, for their assistance.

While the withdrawal of objects from the Museum collection for this
exposition will impair the educational value of the series to the vis-
itors of the Museum during the first four months of the next fiseal year,
it is hoped that the exhibit made at Cincinnati will stimulate the inter-
est of the people of that region in the subject that has added so largely
to their prosperity, so that ultimately the collection will be strength-
ened by additions from that quarter.

It is believed that when the series now at Cincinnati is returned, and
the objects, properly classified, become permanently installed, the Mu-
seum will possess a collection ot very great historical value.
REPORT ON THE SECTION OF MATERIA MEDICA IN THE U.S. NATIONAL
MUSEUM, 1888.

By James M. Fuint, M. D., U. S. Navy, Honorary Curator.

The former curator of this section, Dr. H. G. Beyer, U. 8. Navy, hay-
ing been ordered to other duty by the Navy Department in October
last, the section was left without an official head until April of this
year, although the present Curator was requested to look after the in-
terests of the collection during the interregnum, and gave to it a portion
of his time. There has been no assistance of any kind in the office since
October last, and only the results of the unaided labor of the Curator
for a small portion of the year can be presented, and these are naturally
not numerous or of great importance.

Few accessions of any importance appear upon the register. A col-
lection of Corean medicines, numbering two hundred and twenty-two
specimens, has been obtained by purchase for a nominal sum, and fills
out very completely the series of drugs from that country previously
received from other sources.

The whole collection has been moved during the year from the west
north range of the Museum to the east south range. The transfer made
necessary a re-arrangement of the cases to suit the changed conditions,
and as a consequence the systematic arrangement of the collection, so
far as it existed in the former location, was entirely lost. To restore
the classification involved the moving of the thirty-five hundred speci-
mens, most of them more than once.

It was found by experiment that the appearance of the collection
could be improved by giving to the interior of the exhibition cases a
lighter color than the standard maroon. To this end the cases have all
been repainted, involving the necessity of again moving all the speci-
mens twice. Some further transfers are yet necessary to perfect the
systematic arrangement of the collection.

In view of the growth of the collection, the variety in points of interest
and importance of the individual specimens, and the necessary restric-
tions as to available space for exhibition, a modification of the former
classification has been decided upon. Retaining the general features of
classification by natural orders, the whole collection is broken into sev-
eral series. The first will consist of the more important drugs in gen-

H. Mis. 142, pt. 2 8 113

114 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

eral use among civilized people, and known as “ official” or “ pharma-
copeal” drugs. These it is proposed to illustrate, as fully as possible
in the space allowed, by colored plates, photographs, drawings, etc.
Following this fully illustrated series will be presented the indigenous
drugs of the United States, not official, with references from the labels
to the illustrations, which will be placed in the pillar screens. In this
way case room will be saved, at some sacrifice of attractiveness, but
not of utility to the intelligent student. The collections, in many in-
stances quite large and interesting, of drugs from Mexico, Chili, India,
Japan, Corea, China, and other countries, will be placed in separate
geographical series, whereby their ethnological and botanical interest
will be increased without any sacrifice of their medical value.

The routine work, begun and to be continued, is the thorough label-
ing of the collection, giving to every object, whether drug, botanical
plate, or diagram, a carefully prepared label.

As at present exhibited the labels are without unity of method in
their treatment of the subjects, some of them being very elaborate and
technical, the most of them giving scarcely more than the name of the
article and the donor. It is proposed to take the specimens in regular
order according to the classification, prepare a careful label for each,
and take note of desiderata which the investigation may suggest, and
thus render whatever work may be done complete and permanent. To
obtain specimens seems to be the easiest part of the work, for every
large commercial drug-house in this and other countries appears to be
ready and anxious to contribute and to make personal effort to obtain
what is wanted.

Up to the date of closing this report (June 30, 1888) four hundred
and fifty labels have been completed and mounted in type-writer copy
for temporary service. A manuscript copy of these labels, with brief
explanatory and descriptive notes, has been made for the purpose of
publication at some future time, should it be thought desirable. The
present state of the collection may be briefly summarized as follows,
viz: Number of specimens registered June 30, 1887, 5,516; number of
specimens registered during the past year, 245; total, 5,761. Less du-
plicates and rejected specimens, 500; remaining, 5,261.

REPORT ON THE COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL RELICS, COINS, MEDALS,
ETC, IN THE U. 8, NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

By A. Howarp Cuark, Curator.

Among the principal accessions of the year is the war saddle of
General Grant, deposited by General A. H. Markland. This was used
by General Grant in all the battles in which he participated from Feb-
ruary, 1862, to April, 1865. It is a valuable addition to the large col-
lection of Grant relics received last year.

From the Bureau of Engraving and Printing was received a series of
India proofs, showing the backs and faces of all the current bonds and
currency notes issued by the United States, illustrating each denomina-
tion of Treasury notes and gold and silver certificates from $1 to $10,000,
and coupon and registered bonds from $10 to $50,000.

One of the most important additions to the collection of national
relics was deposited by Mr. Etting (accession 20719). Itis one of the
thirteen original pamphlets signed by George Washington, John Adams,
and other colonial delegates, entitled ‘‘Original Association of Con-
gress, October 20, 1774.” By this association the delegates pledged the
colonies not to import British merchandise after December 1, 1774, and
organized committees of correspondence in the several colonies, etc.
The pamphlet consists of nine printed pages, with two pages and part
of a third containing the autograph signatures of the delegates.

Several collections of ancient and modern coins were received from
M. W. Graves, Hartford, Connecticut; Mr. Thomas Wilson, Washing-
ton, and others.

A beginning has been made in the exhibit of coins toward illustrating
the money of Bible times by showing the coins of kings, countries, and
cities mentioned in the Bible, and specimens of the widow’s mite, the
shekel, denarius, ete.

Many additions have been made to the collection of military decora-
tions, medals, and badges of civic societies, including original decora-
tions of the Order of the Iron Cross of Germany, the Legion of Honor
of France, and other European orders.

From Mr. Stephen Vail was received a piece of the original wire, over
which one of the very first intelligible telegraphic messages was trans-
mitted during the experiments by Professor Morse with his telegraph

115
116 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

instrument at the Speedwell Iron Works, New Jersey, about the year
1840.

From the widow of Professor Baird was received a valuable collection
of nearly eighteen hundred toreign and American postage-stamps, gath-
ered by Professor Baird.

“Tne Ordnance ~ -;22sment, U. 8. Army, transferred to the National
Museum a number of interesting war relics, including a large section of
an oak tree riddled with bullets, from the battle field at pRemats
Court House.

To the collection of autograph letters and documents were added
commissions signed by each of the Presidents of the United States, and
deeds and letters, with autographs, of many eminent men.

To the Washington collection was added the original plaster model
of the bronze statue of Washington, designed by William Rudolf O’Dono-
van in 1887, erected at Washington’s headquarters, Newburgh, New
York, according to act of Congress of June, 1886. The attitude is com-
memorative of Peace, representing Washington in the act of sheathing
his sword at the close of the Revolutionary War. Accompanying the
statue is the certificate of the sculptor, in which he says: ‘ This statue is
the size of life, and in the matter of facts of proportion is correct, having
the small head, the long body, the narrow shoulders, and broad hips of
the three full-length portraits by Trumbull and of the statue by Houdon
in the State-house at Richmond. The head is from the life cast made
by Houdon at Mount Vernon in 1785, which has been little known to
artists and not at all to the public until within the last ten years, and
has not been used, save by Mr. O’Donovan in the making of this statue.”

The Smithsonian Institution during the year transferred to the Mu-
seum its collection of portraits of American and foreign scientists and
men prominent in political or civil life. This series includes nearly
twenty-five hundred engravings and photographs, and will be avaluable
nucleus for the formation of a national gallery of portraits of nepicseng
ative men.

A pair of silver-mounted flint-lock pistols, once the property of Gen-
eral Lafayette, have been deposited by Mr. William Burnett.

Last catalogue entry in June, 1887, 125335; first catalogue entry in
fiscal year beginning July 1, 1887, 125336; iast catalogue entry in June,
1888, 125887; total number of entries, 552, representing 1,016 speci-
mens; there are about 2,000 specimens on hand not catalogued.
STATEMENT RELATING TO THE COLLECTION ILLUSTRATING THE
GRAPHIC ARTS IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888,

No formal report upon the work accomplished in connection with the
collection illustrating the graphie arts, under the care of Mr. S. R.
Koehler, has as yet been published. The following letters are placed
on record to call attention to an important contribution, received from
Mr. J. W. Osborne, of Washington. Mr. Osborne is the inventor of one
of the processes of photolithography, still in general use, patented by
him in 1859, and he has since that time been familiar with every step
of progress in this department of the graphic arts.

Letter from J. W. Osborne transferring to the National Museum his collection of proofs
and specimens illustrating the development of photo-mechanical printing.

212 DELAWARE AVENUE, NORTHEAST,
Washington, D. C., June 6, 1888.

Drak Sir: Two or three years ago I told you of my wish to give the U.S. National
Museum the collection of proofs and specimens illustrating the development of photo-
mechanical printing, which was the result of my long practical experience and obser-
“vation of the several processes comprised under that term, and of my knowledge
of the men who practiced them. This earnest intention I have now carried out in
forwarding to the Museum last Friday a large box and seven other packages contain-
ing my whole collection and addressed to the care of Mr. S. R. Koehler, curator of
the section of graphic arts.

Mr. Koehler and I have spent many days in going over the numerous specimens
and have arranged them according to a crude classification, which must be recon-
sidered with much more care and judgment before they are fit for public inspection.
All the important and typical processes are represented in this collection by many
examples, and it is my wish that Mr. Koehler should divide the whole into two parts;
one for the U. 8. National Museum here and one for the Art Museum in Boston, to
which institution I intend then to give it. For this purpose the number of speci-
mens I have accumulated is, generally speaking, amply sufficient; but I desire in
all cases where a process is representel by a single print, or where a choice has to
be made between a good and bad example of some person’s work, or where the com-
pleteness of a series requires it to be kept unbroken, that the advantage be always
given in favor of the Washington collection. After this division has been made
there will still remain in very many cases a large number of duplicate copies, which
may accompany each collection. These may well be employed, when opportunity
offers, for the purpose of effecting exchanges with other persons possessing valuable
specimens, so as to increase and perfect the historical presentation here and in Bos-
ton. I request that prints so given to other collectors or museums may be marked
in some way indicating that they were originally donated by me.

117
118 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Of the general character of the photo-mechanical work in this collection, it may be
said that photolithography is more fully represented than any other of the photo-
processes classed with it, and that most of the specimens of all kinds will be found
to belong to a period extending from 1852 to about 1872. Photolithography predom-
inates for the reason that there was much more of it done in the years indicated than
of intaglio or relief work, the two latter not having reached a condition of commer-
cial importance till after 1872.

In this letter it would be unwise to attempt a full citation of the processes repre-
sented, experimental and practical, in the collection I have made, but a few of the
names of leading inventors and process-workers may be given with advantage, as
follows:

Lemercier, Barreswill, Lerebours and Davanne, 1852; Macpherson (?), 1852; Fox
Talbot, 1853; Paul Pretsch, 1854; Poitevin, 1855; Cutting & Bradford, 1858; Pouncy,
1858; Asser, 1859; Osborne, 1859; Lemercier, 1859; Col. James, 1860; Turner, 1861 ;
Burchard, 1862; Rehn, 1862; Pouncy, 1863; Ramage, 1863; Toovey, 1863; Osborne,
1863; Korn, 1863; Mandel, 1863; Swan, 1864; Dallas, 1864; Egloffstein, 1865; Leggo,
1865; Osborne, 1866; Willis, 1866; Korn, 1866; Henry, 1867; Woodbury, 1868; Hid-
litz, 1868; Rehn, 1870; Bierstadt, 1871; Edwards, 1872; Wenderoth, 1872; Leggo,
1873; Bien, 1874; Moss, 1850; Roche, 1881; Ives, 1881; Meisenbach, 1883; Sprague,
1884, and many others of jesser note.

In this citation of persons who have played a part in the development of photo-
mechanical processes several names appear more than once; that being done to indi-
cate that at different epochs their influence has been felt in the progress of those arts.
The above names, moreover, comprise most of those represented in the collection, but
not all those who did important and progressive work; as, for instance, Tessié du
Motay and Marechal, and some of their followers; also, some of the mere recent opera-
tors in intaglio and in relief. I should also add, that some of the inventions named
have been more closely connected with carbon printing than with those applica-
tions of photography having for their final object the production of impressions from
a printing press. This is not easily avoided, because of the close relation which
exists between processes belonging to either ciass, from a chemical point of view. In
this connection I will also state, that my specimens of carbon photography have not,
been included with the photo-mechanical work already sent you, but they are at your
disposal whenever you are ready to receive them.

The following very concise and meager statement of my own immediaze connection
with photo-mechanical work may have some value, and I append it in lieu, for the
present, of something more explicit which doubtless ought to be written.

In Melbourne, Victoria, in the winter months (May, June, and July) of 1859, being
tken an assistant in the magnetic observatory, I was detailed to make certain photo-
graphic experiments for the surveyor-general of the colony, Mr. Ligar. His strong
deter.nination was to engrave all the published maps, for the sale of land and other
purposes, on steel by the help of photography. My efforts for him (following Fox
Talbot) did not give results of any value. On the 19th of August of that year, despite
Mr. Ligar’s objection to stone as a crude material, I invented the photolithographie
process, which since then has been known by my name. On the Ist of September,
1859, application was made for a patent, which was granted in due course; and on
the 5th of November following the first photolithographic map for public sale was
published by the department of lands and survey. From that time to the present my
process has been used in Victoria without intermission for all the work which could
possibly be brought within its scope, the maps so produced amounting to many thou-
sands. On the 29th of November, 1859, I read a paper discussing specifically what I
had done at a meeting Of the Philosophical Society of Victoria, which was published
in its transactions. In 1862, with leave of absence for twelve months, I returned to
Great Britain to visit the Exhibition of that year in London. Then, having resigned
my position in the Victorian civil service, I went in 1863 to Germany to study litho-
THE COLLECTION ILLUSTRATING THE GRAPHIC ARTS. 119

graphy in its most perfect form. In Berlin, at the establishment of W. Korn & Co.,
I worked and taught my process for fourteen months. In 1863 it was adopted by the
‘Prussian Government for the production from original pen-drawings by A. Berg of an
important official work on the Prussian expedition to Japan, China, and Siam.

My next change of locality was to the United States, landing in Boston from Liv-
erpool in August, 1864. In 1866, under the laws of the State of New York, the Amer-
ican Photolithographic Company was formed; Sydney H. Gay, president. In the
autumn of that year practical operations were commenced in Brooklyn; Ezra Cor-
nell, president. In 1869 that company, at the request of Commissioner of Patents
Fisher, but at its own cost, reproduced the whole of one month’s current work for
the U. S. Patent Office, comprising about 1,900 drawings, and printed ten copies of
each. Assuperintendent I advised this, to prove conclusively that the process worked
by the company was fit for so large and unusual an undertaking. The effort was
quite successful and admitted to be so, but it was not until July, 1871, that photo-
lithographic reproductions of all the current workin the Patent Office were attempted
and executed up to date. That contract we got and held for three years, furnish-
ing each week the work done in that week, and printing besides the illustrations for
the weekly Official Gazette. An undertaking of such magnitude and difficulty had
never been attempted in the history of the graphic arts, and at the time was thought
by many to be impossible; it certainly marked an epoch, and is therefore worth
noting. For the last twelve or thirteen years I have not been officially connected with
the American Photolithographic Company, and need not follow its fortunes further.
The United States patents, too, under which it worked, have long ago expired, and
my process is used by many as I practiced it, or in a more or less modified form, for
tranfer to stone, or to zine when the latter is to be etched into relief for the type press.

The foregoing statement is necessarily very personal in its nature, but it will serve
to indicate something of the inducements and opportunities affecting my study of
the photo-mechanical arts, and to fix certain dates and a few other facts. Of my
knowledge of other workers in this field, of whom many were known to me; of my
estimate of other processes and their relation and relative value one to the other;
in short of any collateral matter whatsoever calculated to give the subject vital inter-
est I can say nothing that would not extend this letter to an inexcusable length.

Besides the photo-mechanical specimens which I have given the Museum, the col-
lection contains a few lithographic plates by such artists as Menzel, Feckert, Jen-
sen, etc., which will find an honorable place in the section of graphic arts.

Let me now express the pleasure it gives me to have put at last into such excellent
keeping a collection so difficult to get and preserve; one which has cost so much
labor, and which will remain so replete with instruction for those who wish to follow
the wonderful development of the graphic arts within the last fifty years. I look
forward with the greatest interest and expectation to Mr. Koehler’s classification and
arrangement of the whole, knowing how well his experience, thoroughness, and im-
partiality fit him for the work, and I rest confident in the belief that in your appre-
ciative care this collection will increase still further, and will be always a valuable
and accessible help to other men striving to advance.

Yours truly,
J. W. OSBORNE.

IN CHARGE oF U. S. NaTionaL MUSEUM,
Washington, June 12, 1888.

DEAR SiR: Your collection of proofs and specimens illustrating the development
of photo-mechanical printing has been received. The boxes and packages have been
placed in the work-room of one of our preparators, where it awaits Mr. Koehler’s re-
turn to Washington.

We are very glad to have the active co-operation of one who has done original work
in this direction. It is by such generous assistance that the National Museum has
been enabled to make such rapid strides during the past five or six years. I hope that
when your collection has been arranged you will be pleased with our methods of in-
stallation. Mr. Koehler has our fullest confidence in all matters of that kind.

I have no doubt that you will hear from Mr. Koehler before he unpacks the boxes.
I have sent him a copy of your letter and have called his attention particularly to
what you say in regard to sending a portion of the collection to the Art Museum in
Boston. I doubt not, however, that you have already.explained your wishes to him.

Assuring you of the hearty thanks of the Smithsonian Institution for your gener-
ous and most acceptable contribution to the national collections, I am yours very

respectfully,
G. BRown GOODE,
Assistant Secretary.
J. W. OSBORNE, Esq.,
212 Delaware Avenue, Northeast, Washington.

Letter from J. W. Osborne, calling attention to the foundation which has been laid in the
National Museum for a collection illustrating the processes employed in photo-mechanical
printing.

212 DELAWARE AVENUE; NORTHEAST,
_ Washington, D.C., October 25, 1888.

DEAR Sir: Herewith I send you copies of two letters which will interest those of
your readers who have given their attention to photography and its applications to
mechanical printing processes. The first of these letters I may supplement at once
by saying that additional collections of mine have since its date been added to the
specimens I then sent to the National Museum. Besides photo-mechanical work these
include photography, especially early carbon printing, as wellas many specimens by

‘processes in which photography plays no part.

My chief object in asking you to publish this correspondence (that course being the
shortest and most direct way of presenting the whole matter) is to bring to the notice
of experimenters, inventors, and collectors of graphic work, the important fact, that
a substantial foundation has been laid for an exhaustive collection of such productions
under Government auspices in Washington.

In the National Museum the exhibit made by the section of graphic arts, as pre-
sented for public inspection and study, does not as yet*include photo-mechanical
processes ; for there has not been time to effect a satisfactory classification and expo-
sition of my collection. Thorough analysis of that sort is indispensable in such a case,
and it always gives rise to much laborious research and comparison of dates and
statements in the literary record. At present the section of graphic arts embraces
drawing in several styles; etching on metal plates; engraving of different kinds, for
the production of both intaglio and relief plates and blocks; lithography in various
manners; color-printing ; and finally, electrotyping and stereotyping, as applied to
graphic multiplication. Besides the printed results flowing from the practice of these
THE COLLECTION ILLUSTRATING THE GRAPHIC ARTS. 121

arts (many of great beauty), all the necessary tools and appliances are shown which
are required in working the same, with explanatory matter in the form of labels and
printed statements.

This collection, though it covers much space and will strike every one as most in-
structive, is yet to be regarded as a nucleus only, about which the full display will
continuously grow toward completion. As planned, we shall have in this Depart-
ment in a few years a collection representing every known process, perfect in classifica-
tion and in chronological arrangement, and accompanied throughout by explanatory
matter which will give to every specimen a historical as well as a scientific interest.

In this country there are many persons possessed of early results from drawn and
engraved surfaces, with or without photographic aid. These are sometimes artistic
in their nature, and sometimes they indicate only an earnest striving in that direc-
tion. But they are all valuable historically or technically, and should be preserved
in such a way as to turn them to the best account. Asa rule this can only be done
by placing them in a public institution under the direction of persons whose knowl-
edge and experience insures a good estimate of their importance and of their proper
place in a classified collection. For such reasons I would urge those of my fellow-
workers in this field who have collections, for the disposition of which no definite
arrangements have been made, to communicate with Prof. G. Brown Goode, with a
view of donating the same to the National Museum. By taking this course, a per-
manent, I might say an ever-increasing, value will be given to what might in time
pass into the possession of unappreciative persons who cared little for the landmarks
of progress or the work it cost to reach them.

In my letter to Professor Goode a number of dates are given, some slight correc-
tions in which (not inserted) I have already made. These dates relate occasionally
to the time when certain inventions were made, but more generally to the time when
specimens of work in my collection were produced by inventors and other persons of
note. J am very anxious to be correct on the subject of priority, and if it should be
in the power of any of your readers to question the accuracy of these dates or qual-
ify them in any way, and they will doso by letter addressed to me at Washington, I
shall be very much obliged.

Yours truly,

J. W. OSBORNE.
The Eprror OF THE AMERICAN LITHOGRAPHER AND PRINTER,

12 Centre Street, New York.

In addition it may be stated that since these letters were written the
collection of specimens illustrating the photo-mechanical processes has
received many accessions, principally by gift, including a number of
collographic prints by Tessie du Motay (mentioned above as not repre-
sented in the Osborne collection), received from Mr. William Kurtz, of
New York, and avery complete illustration of the original Ives process,
including not only specimens but also models of machinery, presented by
the inventor himself. These, with a selection of specimens of great his-
torical importance, selected from the Osborne collection, and the gen-
erous donations of later work by firms at present actively engaged in
the United States in.the commercial exploitation of the various photo-
mechanical processes, are about to be placed on exhibition, and when
the collection of patents granted to inventors in this department of
applied science, which is now being made with the aid of Mr. J. W. Os-
borne, shall have been completed, the U.S. National Museum will find
itself in the possession of a collection elucidating the history and prac-
tice of photo-mechanical processes, unrivaled by any other collection of
the kind at present known to exist.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY IN
THE U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888, |

By Tuomas WILSON, Curator.

Dr. Charles Rau, for many years the curator of this department, en-
tered the service of the Smithsonian Institution in 1875, and was
placed in charge of the preparation of an ethnological exhibit for the
Centennial Exhibition in 1876, and he was subsequently appointed
Curator of the Department of Archeology in the National Museum.
Dr. Rau had been in poor health during the winter of 1886~87 and
had partially recovered, but was suddenly attacked in July and went
to the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where he died on July
25, from the effects of a surgical operation. His body was interred in
Oak Hill Cemetery, Washington, where a modest stone, bearing a suit-
able inscription, has been erected to his memory.

Dr. Rau bequeathed to the National Museum his library, consisting
of 715 bound volumes, and 1,722 volumes unbound, his archzologic
and ethnologic collections, comprising 2,000 specimens, and _ his collec-
tion of minerals and fossils.

The books comprising the library are now being arranged and cata-
logued, and will form the nucleus of a sectional library in the Depart-
ment. The archeologic specimens will, so far as possible, be kept
together and displayed under the name of their donor.

Almost the entire life of Dr.-Rau was spent in archeologie studies.
He was faithful, zealous, and devoted to his science.

At the time of his death Dr. Rau was engaged in the preparation of
a work which he had called “The Typical Forms of North American
Prehistoric Relies of Stone and Copper in the U.S. National Museum.”
“ This was intended by him to be an enlargement of his work ‘“ Arch:eo-
logic Collections of U.S. National Museum,” and published: April, 1876,
as Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, 287, the edition of which
had been exhausted. It was to have been followed by a larger and
more complete work which, with its illustrations, should represent the
entire field of American Prehistoric Anthropology. This he intended
to be the magnum opus of his life.

The line upon which the work left by Dr. Rau proceeded during his
life-time has not been changed except in some details. It seems de-

123
124 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

sirable, however, to extend somewhat the scope of the work, and to at-
tempt the preparation of but one volume instead of two. Mr. Wilson,
the present curator, has taken up the work of the Department where
it was left by the death of Dr. Rau, and proposes to complete the lit-
erary work which his predecessor had on hand. That work when com-
pleted and published will stand as a catalogue of the objects in this
department of the Museum, a work for which there is great need and
almost constant demand.

The existence of man on the Agnantigen continent, especially in the
United States, during the paleolithic period of the stone Age has for
many years attracted the attention and excited the interest of prehis-
toric anthropologists in Kurope as well as in America. Dr. Rau had
promised himself to give it his serious attention as soon as he should
complete the work he had then in hand. His death prevented his car-
rying out this intention. The need for it was pressing, and the discov-
ery of paleolithic implements in great numbers in the immediate neigh-
borhood of Washington City seemed to present an opportunity not to
be neglected.

Special investigations were begun, studies were made in the field,
local archeologists were asked to assist, to which they responded with
alacrity. A result of all this was the issuance by the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution of Cireular 36, which appealed to the archeol- °
ogists of the various localities of the United States to give such infor-
mation concerning the paleolithic implements, their existence, plente-
ousness, and geographic distribution as they might be able. This cir-
cular was issued in January, 1888, and the first response was received
on February 6. The names and addresses were obtained principally
from our own books, supplementing them with such museums and col-
lections as might be publicly known. Up to the 30th of June there had
been received two hundred and nine responses. A paper discussing
fully the objects of this circular and the information received in reply
is published in Section 11 of this report.

GENERAL REVIEW OF THE YEAR’S WORK.

From the middle of February until the Ist of June the entire office,
after the current daily work required, devoted itself almost exclusively
to the answers to Circular 36 and the replies thereto, and the further
necessary correspondence engendered thereby, and also to the arrang-
ing, cataloguing, and assorting the paleolithic implements received.

The outcome of this office work has established the fact of the gen-
eral distribution of these paleolithic implements over the United States,
aud, consequently, the existence of a paleolithic period on this conti-
nent. It at least establishes the existence and general distribution in
America of a civilization closely corresponding to that of the earlier
paleolithic period in Europe.

Without stopping to argue or demonstrate the truth of this conclu-
DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 125

sion or to enlarge upon its importance, we may safely felicitate our-
selves that our labors in this direction have been of substantial benefit
in the world of American prehistoric anthropology, and that as a result
of these labors the year 1888 will hereafter be reckoned as the date
when the existence of a paleolithic period in America and the occupa-
pation of our continent by man during that period was definitely estab-
lished.

In addition to the foregoing work I have been employed in the prep-
aration of the descriptive catalogue heretofore mentioned, of which I
have now a pile of manuscript, cuts, and photographs 6 or 7 inches in
height.

From the 1st of June to the 30th, and continuing into the present
year, the force of the office has, after the current business, been occu-
pied with the preparation, arrangement, and installation of the prehis-
toric exhibit at the Cincinnati Centennial Exposition.

The number of accessions to the collections of this department during
the year has been 109. The number of specimens received has been
6,972 ; specimens sent in exchange, 821; net increase of specimens, 6,151.

The principal accession (No. 19931) was the archzologic collection
of Dr. Rau, bequeathed by him to the U.S. National Museum. He had
been an enthusiastic archeologist and this was the collection of his
life-time. He added nothing to his private collection after his appoint-
ment as curator in this department. He bequeathed the following
objects:

Four hundred and seventy-four European (137071-137546), prehis-
_ toric; thirteen hundred and sixty-seven North American (137618-
138984), prehistoric, and eighty-nine of our modern Indian. The Enu-
ropean objects he had procured by exchange; the Indian objects were
for the most part those which he had procured either directly from the
Indians or from persons who had so received them. But the thirteen
hundred and sixty-seven North American prehistoric objects were for the
most part his own finds and the direct result of his own investigations in
the field. Some of his specimens were considered by him to be new
forms, those not theretofore known, and upon which he placed a cor-
respondingly high value. A spear-point, now displayed in the synop-
tical exhibit, from Washington County, Missouri, is of rose quartz.
The beauty of its material and the elegance of its workmanship caused
it to be prized highly by Dr. Rau, and it may be justly regarded as one
of the finest of its kind.

During the year many accessions of paleolithic implements were re-
ceived in answer to Circular 36. The greater number of these consisted
of only a few specimens, but they aggregated a great number. Among
the accessions the following are of sufficient importance to justify special
mention : :

Mr. Elmer R. Reynolds, of Washington City, sent (accession 20497,
Catalogue Nos, 139401139412) two hundred and fifty-nine specimens, of
126 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

which two hundred and seventeen were paleolithic, all from the Dis-
triet of Columbia.

Mr. S. V. Proudfit, of Washington City, sent (accession 20003, Cata-
logue Nos. 137060-137070) sixty-seven specimens, of which fifty-three
were paleolithic, and (accession 20358, Catalogue Nos. 139244-139289)
one hundred and thirty-one arrow and spear heads. All these speci-
mens were from the District of Columbia, and were intended by their
donor to constitute a series which would represent all forms of chipped
flint implements from this neighborhood.

Mr. Ernest Shoemaker, of Washington City, sent (accession 20175,
Catalogue Nos. 139007-134010) thirty-five specimens, the greater part of
which were of the paleolithic type, from the District of Columbia.

The curator has, during’the past year, assisted by Professors Gilbert,
McGee, and Holmes, and Messrs. Henshaw and Gill, of the U.S. Geolog-
ical Survey, found in the neighborhood of Washington, principally on
the hills and bluffs of Rock Creek and Piney Branch, a great number
of paleolithic implements. The accession is 20054 (Catalogue Nos.
137551-137583) and consists of two hundred and ninety-nine speci-
mens.

Prof. G. H. Perkins, of the University of Vermont, Burlington, sent

_ three collections (accessions 20554, 20734, 20878, Catalogue Nos. 139428-
139429, 139659-139666, 139724-139750), one hundred and fourteen speci-
mens, principally paleolithic, from northern Vermont.

Mr. Edward Lovett, West Burton House, Outram Road, Croydon,
England, sent, by accessions 18743, 20116, 20225 (Catalogue Nos. 139056-
139100, 189101-139125, 139126-139149), a collection of two hundred and
ninety-nine specimens, sixteen paleolithic. The collection comprises
implements and objects from England, Scotland, Ireland, and India.
There were small arrow-heads from Arabia, large fragments of Samian
ware belonging to the epoch of Roman occupation in England and there
lately discovered, many specimens illustrating flint flaking and the
mode of fabrication of gun-flints.

Mr. William Ransom, of Fairfield, Hitchin, England, sent (accession
20668, Catalogue Nos. 139466-139488) twenty-eight specimens, of which
eight were paleolithic, from England; neolithic implements from Nor-
way and Sweden, and fragments of Samian ware belonging to the
Roman epoch, from the city of London, found 10 to 20 feet below the
surface.

Another accession (21181, Catalogue No. 139817) which may prove of
importance is a flint implement of the rudest type, being merely chipped
to a point, or with an edge not more than‘an inch in width, which was
discovered by Mr. William Taylor, of San Diego, Tex., in San Diego
Creek, one-half mile from the town of San Diego. It was found by him
3 or 4 or more feet under the surface in undisturbed layers. Mr. Taylor
has found several other implements of the same kind, showing that this
was not a solitary or isulated case. This implement becomes important

i
DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 127

from the fact that it was found near the top of the equus beds of that
district, which have become celebrated in the paleontology and geol-
ogy of our country. The Mylodon, Glypdoton, Elephas, and three
species of Equus, all extinct animals, have been found fossilized in
these beds, and it seems agreed among scientists that these beds be-
longed to the Tertiary geologic period.

Dr. Edward Palmer has brought in an interesting collection from a
prehistoric cavern in the Bay of Angeles, 200 miles northwest from
Guaymas, Lower California. (Accession 20608, Catalogue Nos. 139533-
139621.)

Dr. Palmer sailed in December, 1887, from the port of Guaymas,
Sonora, for the station of the Gulf Gold Mining Company, established
in the Bay of Angeles, inside the island of that name, in the Gulf of
California and on the peninsula. In the immediate neighborhood of
this station he found a natural cave in the granite rock on the coast
facing the Bay of Angeles, looking eastward and about 30 feet above
the sea level. Debris had fallen so as to make the approach easy, and
had filled so as to make a large platform in front of the cave. Here
were strewn fragments of rock fallen from the cliff, some of which had
been used to wall up the mouth of the cave. A fine spring (laid down
in the charts) was just below the cave. The miners of the Gulf Gold
Mining Company had visited this spring, and seeing the wall at the
mouth of the cave had pried cut some of the stones. Digging with
their palletos (alpen stocks) they had exhumed some of the skulls,
which were left exposed to the air. This accounts for some being
white. Thus Dr. Palmer discovered the cave.

It was a prehistoric burial place and nothing more. When cleared it
was 6 feet wide and 5 feet high at the mouth, 9 feet deep, retreating
and narrowing to its farther end. There were seven skeletous in all.

No. 139533 was the bottom layer, made of rushes which were joined
and sewed together. We have three bundles. These were apparently
spread out to receive the corpses, the bones having been found thereon.
The skeletons were extended and the bones allin natural condition and
undisturbed, except the skulls dug out by the miners. The burial
place was evidently virgin.

The bodies had been put in head first, for they were now with their
feet toward the mouth of the cave.

In immediate contact with the skulls, as though they had been used
as coverings, were found the nets, three in number. Catalogue No.
139534. (For description and use of these nets as head coverings by
the aborigines see Venaga’s History of Lower California.)

No. 139535 is a girdle or sort of netted kilt made of twine for one
side and fiber bound in strips or bundles, say one-half an inch thick
and 8 or 9 inches long, for the other; the whole is covered with feathers.

No. 139536 is a woven belt 15 inches long and 3 inches wide, nar-
rowed at the ends to a single cord; seemed to have passed around the
waist and over all, possibly only in front.
128 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888. =

No. 139537 is a piece of cloth which would seem to have been the
foundation of the kilt, possibly on one (the front) side only.

The last three numbers seem to have a covering of feathers.

No. 139538 was another dress or apron in the same style, but made of
strands of human hair. They were cylindrical at the top, about one-
fourth of an inch thick, and 10 inches long. The strands were plaited
or fastened together at the top so as to make a screen, one side thereof
being covered as before with feathers. No. 139539 is another apron of
like manufacture with differences in the binding of the hair at the top.
Some had small shells strung and woven in.

Nos. 139540, 139541, and 139542 were pieces of fiber, six strands
woven together with five cross-ties, the whole 14 inches long, 25 wide,
but doubled in the center to 7 inches—probably worn under the breech
clout.

Nos. 139543 and 139544 were bunches of fiber twisted and matted,
showing different knots and methods of fastening. There are many
specimens of cord showing all manners of twisting, braiding, and
knotting.

Nos. 139545 to 139550 are two human vertebrae found closely asso-
ciated with the following ornaments: Small shells strung together as
beads; eight pins—spines of cactus; one piece of buckskin, tied; two
sticks, bound; string of corded, plaited, and bound pendants of human
hair, cylindrical, one-fourth inch diameter and three fourths inch long.

The graves were found to contain an entire paraphernalia. Two
arrow flakers with points of bone set in handles ef wood; four wooden
pieces from 4 to 9 inches long, one-eighth to three eighths in diameter,
each bound with twine about the body, apparently for a handle, but
leaving the sharp point bare; one mush stick; bone points; four shells—
(Cardium elatum, Sby., and one Pecten (Vola) dentata, Sby., possibly
used as drinking cups; two stone tubes, drilled lengthwise, one 114
inches long and one 34, 14 to 1§ in diameter.

There was one bow, in two pieces; an arrow of cane or reed, 2 feet 10
inches long, three-eighths of an inch in diameter, with a fish spine for
a point 4 inches long. There were two shafts or darts, both with long,
sharp points 15 and 20 inches long, one-fourth of an inch in diameter.

Two whistles of hollow reed 9 inches long, five-eighths of an ineh in
diameter.

A curious implement, use unknown, was a piece of flat wood 94
inches long, 2 inches wide, and one-eighth or one-fourth thick. One
end was a concave with a hole below. About 24 inches from each end
was a Single row of very small shells, Olivella biplicata Sby., say one-
eighth inch, set like marquetry across the flat side and fastened with
cement or bitumen.

We have six skulls adult and the fragments of one or more infants.

No. 139551 is one shell ornament, 1¢ inches in diameter; perforated
as for suspension.

No. 139552, same, oval, 2 by 13 inches.

No. 139553, one of the same, 14 inches in diameter. This specimen
is broken in the middle, cracked in two, and has been repaired by four
holes drilled in it in pairs, each two opposite, one of which contains
the original mending. When the hole of suspension in this specimen
was broken out at the edge the owner had HOVENSEL, the specimen and
drilled another hole.

These three ornaments have the appearance of having been used as
ear pendants. Theshell portion is nearly flat and retains its iridescense.
These pieces of shell belong to the species Haliotis splendens Rve.

A collection of objects belonging to prehistoric man, three hundred
and twenty-four in number, were received (accession 19,249) from Mr.
James F. Johnson, Holywood, County Down, Ireland. Mr. Johnson in
his communication gives an elaborate description of their discovery,
with their position, locality, and association. A new road was in course
of construction during August, 1885, on the town land of Ballymenoch,
in his neighborhood, County Down, Ireland. He supervised the work.
As the men cut through a mound of sand a cave 20 feet long by 3 feet
wide and about 3 feet high was exposed which led to an oval chamber
14 by 74 by 6 feet high. At its farther end, and to the right, another
passage leads to a second chamber 9 by 6 by 6 feet high. (Fig. 1.)

It was evidently an ancient habitation of man. It was constructed of

spear and lance heads (136881), fourteen arrow or lance heads (136880),
pounding or crushing stones (136888-136897), one shell necklet, and a
few other relics.

About 20 feet from the cavern a cutting 9 feet in depth was com-
menced through what appeared to have been an ancient pond, the de-
posit being fine mud washed from the hills. All through this deposit
were found weapons and tools, all of a rude type, made from the local
rock (Lower Silurian), and a few arrow-tips of flint (nodules of which
were found from time to time in the bowlder clay). In two places were
ancient remains of fire. The pond was about 110 by 90 feet with 9 feet
only of depth cut through.

From this place he obtained what he names rude hammer-stones
(136887-136889), polishing stones (136890-136896), pounding or crushing
stones (136878, 136903-136907), rude axes more or less notched (136882,
136898-136899, 136877), rude lance, spear, and arrow heads (136880-
136881. In October and November, 1885, he excavated part of a large
cavern at Craigavard, County Down. This he believes to be one of
the largest artificial caverns in the north of Ireland which has served
as a habitation of the prehistoric man. . He believes it to comprise no
less than twelve separate chambers. Among the common people this
was called the Smugglers’ Cave, on account of its supposed use by peo-
ple pursuing that branch of business. He found in this cave whistles,
needles, awls, bodkins, all made of bone, and over two hundred teeth
(136880, 136881), and a quantity of splintered animal bones (136884).
In chamber number 4 he came, at a depth of 2 feet, to the ancient floor,
which consisted of river gravels thrown over the bowlder clay. On this
floor he found a few rude implements of the same type as from Bally-
menoch.

He made excavations in the raised beaches of the neighborhood, and
found many implements which he considers modern compared with
those from the two caves mentioned. The implements from the caves
are made, as he says, from the Lower Silurian and other rocks, while
those from the raised beaches are of flint. The cave implements are
found at high elevations, but never in raised beach gravel. This he
thinks to be a proof of the higher antiquity of these implements. He
sends implements from the raised beaches—of flint, thirteen specimens
rudely chipped unpolished celts (136910); one hundred and six speci-
mens rude spear, lance, or arrow heads (136911, 136912), forty-six spec-
mens; (136913), seventeen specimens; (136914), fourteen specimens.
He also sends scrapers (136915), twenty-one specimens, eight of which

132 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The most important consideration in regard to the collection in the
department of Prehistoric Anthropology is that it is much crowded.
The number of objects in the collection intended for exhibition amounts
to 108,705. These are displayed in cases according to the following
list :

Itis apparent from this statement that the cases now placed in the hall
can not be put closer together, nor under the arrangement can their
number be augmented. A proper display of the objects seems to re-
quire additional room. This declaration is not made as a complaint,
but for the purpose of putting upon record the necessity for increased
space, which may be considered when the opportunity arrives. <A sug-
gestion how the present situation may be ameliorated will be made
farther on, but no permanent relief can be afforded without an enlarge-
ment of space.

Some of the great museums in Europe are comprised exclusively of
the objects which pertain to this department. The Musée of St. Ger-
main is exclusively prehistoric, yet it alone occupies the palace of St.
Germain, an immense structure with moat and portcullis, built by Henry
IV. The palace is now being restored throughout and made fire-proof.
Its sole intended use is for this prehistoric museum. Each story is de-
voted to one prehistoric age. The same general statement is true of
the great prehistoric museum at Copenhagen. It occupies the eight
large halls of the Prince’s Palace, and fills one hundred and eighty-seven_
DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 133
cases. So, also, is it largely true of the prehistoric museums of Stock-
holm, of Christiania, Edinburgh, Dublin, Lyons, Toulouse, Nantes,
Quimper, Vannes, Rennes, of the principal towns of Switzerland, of
Berlin, of Rome, and of many towns in Italy.

In all these and many other places which might be easily named, the
collection of prehistoric anthropology forms an entire museum of itself,
with a full corps of officers and employés. Yet the necessities, as well
as the opportunities, for a prehistoric museum are greater in the United
States than in any of the countries I have mentioned. Our territory is
wider, the field of research is newer, and the prehistoric age of our
country is brought so near to us that our opportunities are, as I have
said. superior.

There has been transferred to this department twenty-six plaster or
papier-maché models of ancient Zuni and Moqui cities, villages, and
monuments, from Arizona and New Mexico.*

Some of these have been placed upon the floor in the center of the
hall, where they occupy 1,750 square feet of space, nearly one-fifth of
the available floor space in the hall. Others, upright models of cliff
dwellings, caverns, etc., are placed upon the tops of the high wall
cases, so far distant and so high as to be out of the range of vision,
which detracts greatly from, if it does not destroy, their interest on the
part of the public.

* They were made originally by the U. S. Geological Survey and by the Bureau
of Ethnology. A list of them is here given:

List of Moqui and Zuni villages and monuments, from Arizona, New Mexico, and Colo-
rado, models of which have been placed on exhibition in my hall.

134 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

There are also placed upon the tops of the wall cases other models,
those of prehistoric mounds and earthworks belonging to the United
States.*

They are made to represent the surface of the earth in and about the
respective monuments. Of course the surface they are intended to
represent is horizontal, flat, and it is a solecism to place them perpen-
dicular. The objection mentioned with regard to the other models, as
to their being so high as not to be seen, applies equally to these.

There is another reason for re-arrangement, which applies with
greater force to some of these mounds. The Etowah Mound, at Carters-
ville, Georgia, has, for example, been excavated and surveyed by the
Bureau of Ethnology. The objects found within that mound are dis-
played in one of the upright cases, while the model of the mound itself
is placed, along with many other models, in a perpendicular position on
the top of one of the wall cases. There is thus no relation between the
mound and the objects found therein, nor is there any opportunity for
the study and comparison of the two in their respective relations.

The prehistoric collections from Central and South America are dis-
played in scattered cases, separated according to the requirements of
space, with the adjoining cases containing North American antiquities,
and nothing to distinguish them except perhaps the labels. This dis-
play is not effective and detracts largely from the benefit. Many per-
sons fail to see or recognize them as representing a civilization different
from that of the stone hatchets and arrow heads, and the Indian pipes,
in contiguous cases.

The collection of prehistoric objects from Central America is of great
value and interest. Itis the largest museum collection in this country,
and is exceeded only by that of one private gentleman. It has scarcely
received the consideration due to its merits. It should be re-arranged,
should be assembled in one locality instead of being scattered as at
present, and should have a descriptive catalogue, with maps and illus-
trations worthy of the merit and rarity of its objects. a

In this connection I submit a list of the idols and images and other
antiquities, which have lately been transferred to this hall, coming also —
from Central America, and which should be included in the catalogue:

The arrangement of this department of the Museum has been princi-
pally according to the implement or object. Arrow and spear points
have been arranged in separate cases, divided according to their various
forms. Grooved axes have been placed together, polished stone hatchets
together, mortars, pestles, hammers, pitted stones, etc., have been gener-
ally placed together without regard to locality from which they came,
the era or epoch to which they belonged, or their period of civilization.
The exhibits received from the Bureau of Ethnology have been displayed
in the upright cases, and there each find has been placed by itself, and,
so far as possible, separated from all other finds. But in this arrange-
- ment no attempt has been made to preserve the unity of neighborhoods
in respect of locality. The contents of mounds from Maine and Geor-
gia may be found together in one case, while the collections from neigh-
boring mounds in either State, it may be at different times and of
different accessions, may be found in other parts of the hall associated
with the contents of mounds from other and different parts of the
United States.

It is highly proper that it should be so changed as that contiguous
objects should be displayed together. Things that belong together
should be displayed together. I have recognized the necessity for this
work, but have been loth to commence it, for it would require the in-
spection and handling of every object in the Museum, and this would

mean an examination as to the locality from which it came, the people

to whom it belonged, and a consideration of and decision upon the his-
tory and purpose of each. This can not be done by mechanics or labor-
ers, but would require the continual labor and attention of Mr. Upham
or myself, or perhaps both, and would be a labor of such extent and
duration that I am loth to attack it. My little experience in a like at-
tempt in preparing the exhibit for the Cincinnati Exposition confirms
me in this feeling. I suppose the work must be done, but ‘upon the
bank I shivering stand, yet fear to launch away.”

This arrangement of the objects in the Museum, geographically or -
136 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

by locality, was contemplated by Dr. Rau. His report for the year _
ending June 30, 1886, contains the following paragraph:

The collections in question, of course, vary much in extent; they sometimes only
fill a tray, but occasionally occupy several shelves of an upright case. Ultimately,
when anything like completeness has been reached, they will be arranged geographic-
ally. ,

In the proposed geographic arrangement of the objects in the
Museum the entire abrogation of the arrangement according to struct-
ural function is not contemplated. It is intended that a series of the
respective objects, sufficient to show their normal peculiarities, will be
arranged and preserved.

It is suggested that the great hall might to advantage be divided
into fictive apartments by means of screens, or better, by wall cases,
for the display of collections from separate countries like Central and
South America, Mexico, etc., or of the Zuni or Moqui Pueblo, or of other
epochs or monuments like the mounds, the shell-heaps, the caverns,
etc. The Museum would be a gainer of space thereby.

The present state of the collection is shown by the following table:

The principal research in which I have been engaged during the
past year has been for the evidences of the existence of man during
the paleolithic period of the stone age on the continent of North Amer-
ica; in other words, an inquiry as to whether there had been a paleo-
lithic period in America or whether there were to be found evidences
of the existence of a civilization in America which corresponded with
that of the paleolithic period in Europe. The results of this inquiry
are given in full in a subsequent portion of this volume. (See section
111.) Another of equal interest, but not so extensive, has been in re-
lation to the ancient matting from Petit Anse, also described in a
separate paper.

Much more might have been done but for the absorbing character of
the routine work in the department, which it may not be uninteresting
to describe in this connection.

_ That for a single day will serve as a type. The curator and all em-
ployés arrive at 9 o’clock (the laborers have already aired, swept, and
DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 137

dusted the exhibition hall and offices). The mail is opened, letters
read and briefed; those pertaining to announcements of accessions are
sent to the registrar; requests for information, etc., are answered;
boxes opened, specimens received are unpacked, separated, arranged,
classified, and all entered in the catalogue. They are then sent out to
be numbered with the catalogue number, which is placed upon every
specimen with paint of suitable color. The name of the donor and the
locality must also appear. They are then, in trays, placed in a special
case to be assorted and assigned to their respective places by the
curator. There is enough work of this numbering to keep a skilled
laborer continually employed. For example, the number of specimens
received during the past year was 6,972. The present catalogue num-
ber (139916) consists of six figures. The locality and name of donor
trebles the labor of marking, making the average of eighteen to twenty-
four figures and letters to be painted on each specimen, or a total of
125,000 to 175,000 figures or letters. This requires an average of two
painted figures or letters per minute, to be made without stop or break,
during the working hours of the entire year. The McGlashan collec-
tion from Georgia, comprising twenty thousand and more specimens,
had been received before my appointment as curator. Only a partial
attempt had been made to number them.

The work of the office on Circular 36 began about the middle of Jan-
uary, but from the middle of February the answers and specimens re-
ceived from correspondents were, together with their replies and ex-
changes, sufficient to occupy our entire force. The assorting of the
specimens and dividing them into their respective epochs of the
~ paleolithic period was a slow work, requiring care and deliberation.
Any intervals of time were occupied in the preparation and writing of
the descriptive catalogue of the archeological collection. The classifi-
cation of the paleolithic implements had progressed as far on the list as
the State of Ohio on the 31st day of May. On the 1st day of June Il
was notified to immediately commence the preparation of an exhibit
from the department of Prehistoric Anthropology for display at the
Cincinnati Centennial Exposition. That work required the services. of
all available force in the office during the balance of the fiscal year
and somewhat into the present.

Prior to March 23, 1888, no attempt was made in the office to keep a
record of the correspondence, requests for information, notes of refer-
ence from other departments, and their answers, ete. During the
months of January and February, and up to the 22d of March, there
had been sent between five and six hundred circulars. In March there
were written and sent, 32 circulars and 13 letters; in April, 20 letters;
in May, 45 letters; and in June, 63 circulars and 24 letters; making a
total of 202.

My experience has gradually demonstrated, to my own satisfaction at
least, that the daily routine business of the office is sufficient to fully
138 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

occupy my time during working hours if I devote myself to the per-
formance of its details. This work is important and should not be neg-
lected. I might add, in this connection, that I find my duties in the
office sufficient to require the attention and constant labor of three per-
sons instead of one, all of which now devolves on me. First, the daily
routine, just adverted to; second, the re-arrangement of the specimens
in the Museum; and third, the making of a catalogue and other scien-
tific and literary labor. The last is, in my judgment, the most impor-
tant and will be pressed forward with as much rapidity as the daily
routine will permit.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS IN THE U.S, NATIONAL
MUSEUM, 1888.

By FREDERICK W. TRUE, Curator.

In my last report I stated that the chief features of the year’s work
were the re-arrangement of almost the entire exhibition series in new
and specially adapted cases, and the replacement of a portion of the
defective material in the study series by the purchase of fresh speci-
mens. During tie past year the work has progressed along the same
lines, but some special tasks were also undertaken, the foremost of
which was the preparation of a large series of specimens for exhibition
in the Ohio Valley Centennial Exposition in Cincinnati.

The plan of representing the more important mammals of North
America by groups of specimens accompanied by accessories indicative
of the habits and natural surroundings of the species, which had been
for some time under consideration, was carried into execution by Mr.
Hornaday, chief taxidermist. Five groups have been placed in the ex-
hibition hall, one of which, a group of bisons, is one of the largest and
most carefully executed works of its kind to be found in any museum.

More valuable material has been acquired by purchase and exchange
and less by donations than in previous years. Some interesting speci-
mens were received from two collectors sent out by the Smithsonian
Institution, but, with one or two exceptions, very little material has
been received from the various branches of the Government service.

No descriptions of new species of North American mammals have been
published during the year, though announcements of the discovery of
several have been made to some of the scientific societies.

Among the important accessions of the year the foremost, perhaps,
was the series of skins of small mammals selected from several collec-
tions of small mammals made by Mr. F. A. Stephens in the San Fran-
cisco Mountains, Arizona, and the San Bernardino Mountains, Califor-
nia. These included specimens of Spermophilus tereticaudus, Dipodomys
deserti, Thomomys talpoides perpallidus, and other species of rodents not
previously well represented in the collection. Two specimens of an
undescribed race of Haplodon major from Point Reyes, Cal., were pur-
chased from Mr. C. K. Worthen. A fine skin of an unusually large

139
140 "REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

male moose was obtained from Mr. A. Bb, Douglas, of Eustis, Me.,
through Dr. C. H. Merriam. It is intended that this specimen shall form
the chief figure ina group. Dr. J.C. Merrill, U. S. Army, forwarded
from Fort Klamath, Oregon, a considerable collection of small mammals,
in addition to those sent last year. During his last tour through the
Western Territories, Mr. Hornaday obtained, among other specimens, a
very fine pair of wapiti antlers in the ‘‘ velvet.” Not less interesting
and valuable were two specimens of the Striped Dolphin, Lagenorhynchus
acutus, which were presented by the U.S. Fish Commission. They were
obtained by the officers of the Commission’s schooner Grampus south
of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. A fine Mountain Goat’s skin was pur-
chased from Mr. KE. C. Babcock.

The only important collection from Central America was the consid-
erable one made by Mr. Charles H. Townsend in the vicinity of the
Segovia River, Honduras. This included a valuable series of specimens
of an undescribed deer, which has simple antlers like the species of the
subgenus Coassus, but which nevertheless appears to belong to the sub-
genus Cariacus. Prof. Alfredo Duges presented a specimen of the rare
meadow mouse, Arvicola quasiater, from the Valley of Mexico.

The most important Old World mammals obtained during the past
year were those received from Prof. H. A. Ward in exchange for skins
of North American species. The collection included several lemurs,
cats, civets, Squirrels, and kangaroos, allof which were of species new to
the Museum series. The Zoological Society of Philadelphia, through
Mr. A. E. Brown, presented a fine male harnessed antelope (Tragelaphus
scriptus), an Indian squirrel (Sciurus bicolor), and a Moor monkey (Semno-
pithecus maurus). Mr. Valdemar Knudsen presented two additional
Specimens of the bat found in the Sandwich Islands. It is a species
of Atalapha, which is apparently distinct from those hitherto described.
Mr. F. A. Lucas presented a skull of Burchell’s zebra. A skull and
skeleton of the Zipbioid whale known as Ziphius grebnitzkii were re-
ceived from Mr. N. Grebnitzky, who obtained them from Bering Island.

In my last report I stated that new cases for almost the entire ex-
hibition series were received at the end of the fiscal year. The month
of July, 1887, was spent in planning the interior fittings for these cases
and in re-arranging the collection. The improvement in the appearance
of the collection resulting from this work has been much commented
upon by visitors.

The new wings added to the large wall-cases were fitted with shelves
and bases, and the one intended for tbe seals was filled with specimens.
The east wing, intended for the large ruminants, has not been arranged.
Before the plans had been finished, the majority of the specimens were
in requisition for display in the Cincinnati Exposition, and no perma-
nent installment could be made.

The cast of the Humpback whale, which had previously rested upon
iron standards at the south end of the exhibition hall, was suspended
DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS. ; 141

from the roof. By this change a considerable floor-space was made
available for other purposes.

By far the most important additions to the exhibition series were the _
groups already alluded to. Five of these works, representing the bison,
prairie wolf or coyote, opossum, prong-horn antelope, and prairie-dog,
have been placed in the hall. The bison group occupies a case about

_17 feet long, 123 feet wide, and 9 feet high. All the groups were de-
signed by Mr. W. T. Hornaday and were executed by himself, assisted
by Messrs.J. Palmer, A. H. Forney, and William Palmer. Great pains
were taken to make the groups true to nature, and in the case of the
bison, coyote, and antelope, the turf, bushes, and other accessories were
brought from Montana with the specimens themselves. The work has
been very carefully done, special attention having been given to matters
of detail. Several new groups are in preparation.

In addition to these five groups, which together include twenty-seven
specimens, the taxidermists have mounted about thirty other mammals.
A few of these were still without stands at the end of the year or could
not be completely finished for lack of materials, and the remainder
were sent to the Cincinnati Exposition. The usual list will therefore
be held over for next year’s report, when the work done for the Cincin-
nati Exposition will be reported npon in full.

In addition to the regular routine work connected with the identifica-
tion and cataloguing of new specimens, correspondence, the preparation
of labels, etc., several special tasks were undertaken. The entire col-
lection of skulls was furnished with uniform labels, and the skins of the
monkeys and carnivores also received fresh labels, replacing the old
ones, many of which were becoming illegible. It should be remarked
here that the original labels received with the specimens are never
removed unless, aS sometimes happens, they are of absurdly large
size.

The skins which had accumulated in the taxidermists’ tanks, amount-
ing to over three hundred, were divided into two lots, preparatory to
being taken in hand by the taxidermists, some being assigned to the ex-
hibition series and others to the study series. A considerable number
of large skins belonging to the latter series were received from the
taxidermists during the year, and were temporarily stored in the lower
part of some of the exhibition cases.

The alcoholic collection has been temporarily placed on shelves in
the south entrance of the Museum. The jars have been repeatedly ex-
amined, and the collection is in a fair state of preservation.

The boxes containing the skins of ruminants and other large mam-
mals are stored in the south entrance and are practically inaccessible
for want of space.

A new card-catalogue of the exhibition series has been formed by
pasteing copies of the printed labels on standard cards. The other card-
142 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

catalogues are in the same condition as when last reported upon, except
that the new accessions have been entered upon them.

A series of antlers of North American deer was prepared for and sent
to the Minneapolis Exposition.

A general bibliography of works upon the Mammalia, commenced
some time ago, now comprises about fifteen thousand titles. All the
titles cited in the Zoological Record, the first and second parts of Carus
and Knglemann’s Bibliotheca, the Zoologischer Anzeiger, and Fried-
lander’s catalogues are inciuded, as well as references to the brief but
often valuable notes to be found in the American Sportsman, Forest and
Stream, and other journals of like character. ‘This is, of course, only
a beginning, but I have already found the catalogue of much service
in connection with the work of the department.

As a foundation for the work of representing graphically the geo-
graphical distribution of our North American mammals, copies have
been made of all the available faunal lists, about sixty-seven in num-
ber, which have appeared from time to time in various works on the
Nearctic fauna.

The curator obtained some additional information regarding the ty pe-
specimens of different species of dolphins during a short journey in
Europe in the early part of the year, and has added to his review of
the family a synopsis and materials for figures of all the species. The
paper has not yet been published. He also prepared descriptions of
two new rodents from Padre Island, Texas, and of the Sandwich Island
bat, some notes on Vesperugo hesperus (Allen), and a review of the
changes in the catalogue of North American mammals in the last ten
vears. None of these papers have been published during the year.
The curator and Mr. EK. W. Nelson have published a report upon the
mammals obtained by Mr. Nelson in Alaska, 1877-81.

The following figures show the number of specimens in the different
series on June 30, 1887, and June 30, 1888, respectively.

It will be noticed that the exhibition series is smaller than at the
close of the previous year. This is due to the fact that when the new
exhibition cases were received a large number of old mounted skins,
which were in amore or less dilapidated condition, were withdrawn
from exhibition and placed among the duplicates. This replacement
of defective specimens by good ones must go on gradually for several
years, until the collection is entirely renovated. The number of speci-
mens actually added during the year was thirty-two.
DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS. 143

Among the accessions were about sixty species and subspecies not
previously represented in the collection.

The number of skins and specimens in alcohol added and distributed
during the year was as follows:

Number of specimens added, 247; number of specimens distributed, 69.

Four specimens only were received on deposit.

The first entry for the year in the catalogue of skins and alcoholics
was No. 15900; the last, on June 27, 1888, was No. 16236.

The present condition of the collection as regards preservation is, on
the whole, satisfactory. The study series of skins, however, is still in
cases which are not dust-proof. To devise effective and manageable
appliances is a matter of considerable difficulty owing to the great
disparity in size among the skins and the cramped condition of the
laboratory. Several plans are under consideration, however, and the
curator hopes to be in a position to recommend the adoption of some
one of them in the immediate future.

The skins of large mammals which have accumulated during the
past twenty-five years, being at present, as already stated, stored in
large boxes arranged in tiers in the south entrance of the Museum
building, are almost inaccessible for study. Better provisions for them
and for the large skins recently received from the taxidermists are
much to be desired. A partial reconstruction of the storage cases now
in the laboratory and the addition of one new case would meet the pres-
ent requirements.

The mammals in alcohol deteriorate in spite of our best efforts to
preserve them. The spirits dissolve out the pigment of the hair, caus-
ing it in most cases to assume a pale brown color. Such specimens
give a false notion of the real colors of the species, and are useful to
students of systematic zoology only for measurements. The curator
is not satisfied, therefore, that it is profitable to maintain so large
an alcoholic collection and has seriously considered the advisability of
converting a portion of the more recently-acquired specimens into dry
skins. Many gaps in the series of skins could thus be filled, and there
would still be an abundance of material for anatomical investigation.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS IN THE U.S, NATIONAL
MUSEUM, 1888.

By Rosert Ripa@way, Curator.

The year’s work has consisted, as heretofore, largely of routine work, |
such as the receiving, unpacking, cataloguing, labeling, and installa-
tion of collections, making of exchanges, correspondence, etc. In addi-
tion to the large amount of work done under these separate headings,
nearly the entire exhibition collection has been re-arranged, the cases
being fitted with patent adjustable shelving and repainted. This im-
portant work is still going on, and progresses as rapidly as the cases
can be put in proper shape.

During the last two months of the year the time and work of the de-
partment was devoted exclusively to the preparation, cataloguing,
labeling, and packing of the collections for the Centennial Exposition
in Cincinnati, Ohio. During this time all the energies of the curator
and his assistants were directed toward making the ornithological ex-
hibit as creditable to the Museum as possible, and I am glad to state
that these efforts were crowned with complete success. The bird ex-
hibit embraced: (1) Five hundred and thirty finely mounted birds rep-
resenting the characteristic types of all the zoogeographical regions of
the earth, arranged in four double mahogany cases, each specimen pro-
vided with a printed label giving the vernacular and systematic names
as well as the geographical distribution of the species; (2) a group of
mounted birds representing such species as play a conspicuous réle in
literature, with the names by which they are known in works of poetry,
and a quotation of some characteristic poem relating to the species
_ printed on the labels; (3) twelve artistic groups of North American
water birds, in two mahogany cases, mounted with surroundings indi-
cating their natural habitat ; (4) a collection of eggs and casts of eggs
ranging from the enormously large egg of the extinct Epyornis or Giant
Ostrich to the tiny egg of the Humming-bird, with explanatory labels;

(5) a series of original water-color paintings, by the curator, representing
extremely rare North American birds, either extinct or on the verge of
extinction; (6) a series of fac-simile reproductions of plates of Audubon’s
great work on the Birds of North America, appropriately framed and
labeled. As a special feature of the exhibit illustrating the geographical

distribution, a series of colored maps may be mentioned, each repre-
senting one of the zoogeographical regions oi the earth.

during the cruise of the Fish Commission schooner Grampus, Capt. J. W. Collins, by
Messrs. William Palmer and Frederic A. Lucas, of the National Museum. The collec-
tion is a valuable one, not only for the species collected, but also for the excellence
of their preparation. It contains many interesting species and plumages, especially
those of young birds. A pair ofthe Newfoundland Ptarmigan (Lagopus welchi) recently
described, and hitherto unrepresented in the Museum collection, deserve special men-
tion. :

U.S. Fish Commission, through Vinal N. Edwards, Wood’s Holl, Massachusetts:

Zoological Society of Philadelphia, through Mr. Arthur E. Brown: A Lady Amherst
Pheasant, an Australian Parrot (Psephotus xanthorrhous), and a Demoiselle Crane, all
in the flesh. Also a specimen Javan Adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus) in the flesh. All
form valuable and interesting additions to the exhibition series. (Gift.)

Owing to the inadequate number of cases and the unsuitable con-
struction of those available, it has not been possible to make rapid
progress with the systematic re-arrangement of the exhibition series; a
satisfactory beginning has, however, been-made, and the large amount
of necessary work that has been done in the way of remodeling cases
insures more rapid advancement of the work during the present year.

The study series has been steadily improved in arrangement, as
opportunity afforded, and as the necessary cases and drawers became
available.

The complicated preparations necessary for the orderly arrangement
and systematic classification of such extensive and bulky collections as
those belonging to the bird department having nearly been completed,
it is safe to say that the work will henceforth progress rapidly, provided
the required additional cases are forthcoming as they may be needed.

The extent of general routine work may be briefly stated as follows:

In addition to the above, many hundred labels were written and proof
corrected.

Owing to the vast amount of labor required by matters mentioned
under the first and third sections of this report, very little time has
' been available for special research, the principal part of what was ac-
complished by the curator being necessarily done out of office hours.
It is much to be regretted that no more time can be given to work
of this kind, of the greatest importance to ornithological science as well
as to the collection, whose value is increased as its component parts or
sections become the basis of original monographic work; and no collec-
tion of American birds contains a greater quantity of material for such
original research, urgently required for the advancement of the science,
than that of the bird department of the National Museum. So much
has the function of the curator of this department become that of a
purely administrative head, that his occupation consists almost entirely
in the performance of numberless complex routine duties connected
with the receipting for, unpacking, cataloguing, labeling, installment,

150 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

and reporting upon collections or specimens received, correspondence,
exchanges, arrangement of the exhibition series, ete., that practically
he is removed from the rank of active ornithologists. By unusual
effort, however, the curator has managed to prepare a review of the
Mexican and Central American members of the following families of
birds: Thrushes, Mocking Thrushes, Warblers, Titinice, Creepers, and
Dippers; determined a collection of birds from the Lower Amazon, con-
taining thirteen new species and one new genus, and a large collec-
tion from islands in the Caribbean Sea and the coast of Honduras;
also containing novelties, a monograph of the genus Dendrocincla, and
another of the interesting and greatly confused genus of Passerine
Parrots (Psittacula), in each of which is deseribed several previously
unknown species.

The assistant curator, Mr. Leonhard Stejneger, has continued his
studies of the splendid collection of Japanese birds belonging to the
National Museum. During the year several large private collections
from the same country have been received for examination, upon which
extensive reports are still in progress of preparation. In connection
with these studies he investigated several groups of European birds,
with the result of clearing up several doubtful points. He has also re-
ported upon two collections of birds from the Hawaiian Islands received
during the year.

The present condition of the collection, so far as the preservation of
the specimens is concerned, could not possibly be better. As to con-
venience of arrangement. much improvement is to be desired; but this
will be possible only when at least twice the amount of room is pro-
vided for its accommodation.

It has not been practicable to make an actual count of the specimens in
the bird collection, but their number is very nearly as given in the LOL
lowing careful estimate :

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF BIRDS’ EGGS IN THE U. S. NATIONAL
MUSEUM, 1888.

By Capt. CHarLes E. BenpirE, U.S. A., Honorary Curator.

The following important additions have been made to the collection
of birds’ eggs during the year:

From Lieut. H. C. Benson, Fourth Cavalry, U.S. Army, Fort Hua-
chuca, Arizona, were received 6 species, 14 specimens. Some of the rarer
amongst these are as follows: Columba fasciata (2 specimens); Calli-
pepla squamata (3 specimens); Vireo huttoni stephensi with nest (3 spec-
imens); Psaltriparus plumbeus (2 nests) are new to the collection. From
Dr. J.C. Merrill, assistant surgeon U.S. Army, Fort Klamath, Oregon,
came 11 species, 77 specimens. Among them were 4 sets, 22 specimens,
of Parus gambell. From Dr. A. K. Fisher, Department of Agriculture,
were received 1 set of 2 eggs of Buteo latissimus. From T. Stephens,
San Bernardino, California, were purchased 1 set of 4 eggs and nest of
Polioptila californica; new to the collection. Mr. C. W. Richmond,
Washington, District of Columbia, gave a cellection of 84 species, 950
specimens, mostly from the District of Columbia. From Denis Gale,
Goldhill, Bowlder County, Colorado, was received a fine collection, in-
cluding Bubo virginianus subarcticus (2 specimens), and Carpodacus cas-
simi (4 specimens). Dr. William C. Avery, Greensborough, Alabama,
presented 2 nests and a set of 3 eggs of Dendroica vigorst; 4 sets, 15
specimens, and 3 nests of Peucca estivalis bachmant; new to the col-
lection. Col. N. G. Goss, Topeka, Kansas, contributed 1 egg of Sula
gossi and 2 eggs of Sula brewsteri; both species new to the collection.
Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, gave
nests and 4 eggs of Geothlypis philadelphia. Herbert Brown, Tucson,
Arizona, presented four specimens of Piranga rubra coopert; 2 nests
and 8 specimens of Harporhynchusbenderei; and 1 nest of Harporhynchus
palmeri, and others. The nests are new to the collection.

One hundred and four nests have been received during the yéar.

The character of the routine work has consisted in taking the meas-
urements, numbering, classifying, and re-arranging 1778 specimens ;
relabeling and arranging part of the reserve series of eggs after the
*¢ American Ornithological Union” check-list, and repacking and label-
ing a large duplicate series of nests.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS IN
THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888,

By H. C. Yarrow, M. D., Honorary Curator.

Owing to the fact that repairs were made to the west basement of the
Smithsonian building in which is situated the room set apart for tlie
curator of the Department of Reptiles and Batrachians, it was found
somewhat difficult to attend properly and promptly te the ordinary
routine work of the department; still this has been performed as expe-
ditiously as was possible under the circumstances. It was found nec-
essary to transfer the entire “reserve series” of reptiles to storage
rooms provided for the purpose, and this transfer was so carefully done
that not a single specimen was injured.

Since the return of the collection to the room where it belongs, it has
been carefully gone over, bottles relabeled if necessary, filled with fresh
aicohol, and put in complete systematic order for reference or study.

During the repairs the office of the curator has been twice moved,
comfortable quarters having been assigned him.

Much eredit is due my assistant, Mr. EH. S. Rheem, for the careful
manner in which he has performed his duties.

Among the more important contributors during the year, are Dr.
J. C. Merrill, Fort Klamath, Oregon; Charles S. Beachler, Indiana;
Lieut. J. F. Moser, U. S. Navy; H. D. Hood, Florida; James Bell,

Austin, Texas; John S. Webb, Stanley County, North Carolina; Charles
B. Cory, Boston, Massachusetts. The collection made by the latter
was sent to Professor Cope, of Philadelphia.

In addition to the usual routine work, the Reptile Department was
moved back into its old quarters in the west basement of the Smith-
sonian building; all the alcoholic specimens contained in bottles, proba-
bly five thousand, were carefully cleaned and refilled, when necessary,
with fresh alcohol; the “reserve series” has to a great extent been
relabeled, and arranged systematically in the cases prepared for it; a
number of new specimens have also been added. The ‘ reserve series ”
of Testudinata has been properly attended to and arranged in cases,
and the ‘“‘ duplicate” reptiles, contained in tanks, were overhauled, and
are all in excellent condition.

All this extra work necessitated the services of a laborer, who was
detailed on requisition, from time to time. It is to be hoped that one
will be detailed permanently in this department, as the great increase
in work is such that one is greatly needed.

The following special researches have been carried on:

Prof. E. D. Cope, of Philadelphia, has continued his studies upon the
batrachia, and is now engaged upon the reptiles proper.

The curator has investigated the subject of crotalus venom, its action
upon animals, and a number of experiments were tried with so-called
‘Santidotes” to the venom. A popular account of the experiments, by
permission of the Assistant Secretary, was published in “ Forest and
Stream,” New York, May and June, 1888. It is intended to continue
these experiments during the fall and winter.

The present state of the collection is shown in the following state-
ment:

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FISHES IN THE U.S, NATIONAL
MUSEUM, 1888.

By Dr. TARLETON H. BEAN, Honorary Curator.

Early in the year the curator was ordered by the Commissioner of
Fisheries to investigate and report upon the fishes of Great Egg Har-
bor Bay, New Jersey, and accordingly left Washington early in July
(1887) for that purpose. The work was done under the auspices of the
_ U.S. Fish Commission, and the report upon the same made to the Com-
missioner. After the eurator’s return to Washington, considerable time
was consumed in the preparation of a paper for publication upon the
results of this expedition.

An accumulation of correspondence pertaining to this department
was taken up and disposed of. During the period from October (1887) to
Apri) (1888) many new forms were described, chiefly of deep-sea fishes.
These descriptions have not been published as yet. The descriptions
of inland species have, as a rule, however, been promptly printed in the
_ Proceedings.

The collections of fishes in the main hall of the Smithsonian were re-
moved to the basement, and those belonging in the fish hall proper were
returned to their places after the fire-proofing had been completed.
The removal of collections, especially alcoholics, caused much annoy-
ance and work; labels were destroyed, alcohol spilled, and jars some-
times broken, involving much loss of time and often a pretty general
‘re-arrangement of the collections. The contents of my office were

moved back into the old quarters from the Museum. ;

I was ordered to join the Grampus in her southern mackerel fishery
investigations, which occupied my time from May 10 to June 15, 1888,
Immediately after my return I began to arrange materials for a report
on this cruise, based on the specimens which were transferred to the
National Museum.

The first number in the register for the year is 39,119, and the last
39,568.

About 1,350 specimens have been entered in the catalogue during
the year. These specimens have for the most part been placed in bot-
tles, after having been identified and reported upon, labeled and put
in their proper places.

155
156 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The following collections have been studied and administered upon:

A specimen of Haplochiton zebra, new to our collection, was sent by
Lieut. W. M. Wood, from Puerto Bueno. Numerous collections made
in South America, by W. E. Safford and Senor Don José Arechavaleta,
were received and cared for. A small collection of fishes made in
Honduras, Central America, by Mr. C. H. Townsend, has been exam-
ined and reported upon. Collections of fishes made in Newfoundland
and vicinity by the U.S. Fish Commission, schooner Grampus, have
been identified; also numerous collections made by the steamer Alba-
tross off the east coast of the United States have been catalogued and
preserved.

Collections have been received from nearly every State anil Territory
in the Union.

Numerous types of new species have been obtained, descriptions of
which have been published in the Proceedings of the Museum. Numer-
ous applications for loans of material for study have been received and
attended to.

The present state of the collection is fairly satisfactory.

The entire collection in jars has been overhauled during the year,
alcoho! supplied where needed, and many new labels placed upon the
bottles. New shelving has been furnished, and the places overcrowded
have been relieved to some extent. Numerous important additions to
the collection have been received; seventeen types of new fishes have
been added, besides several rare and little-known forms.

The collection is much improved in condition and arrangement since
one year ago.

No duplicates have been distributed except two small lots. There is
much material here that could be distributed to museums throughout
this and other countries, and profitable exchanges no doubt could be
carried out, but not without more assistance than is now allotted to the
department.

The total number of accessions received during the year was sixty-
two, representing the following localities in the order named:

Maryland. Massachusetts. New Hampshire.

New Jersey. Wyoming. Querean Bank.

Mexico. — Virginia. Washington Territory. _
Vermont. Florida. Georgia.

Texas. Colorado. Mississippi River.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS (INCLUDING TERTIARY
FOSSILS) IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888,

By WILLIAM HEALEY Datu, Honorary Curator.

The force of the Department of Mollusks for the period reported on
in addition to the Curator, has consisted of Dr. R. E. ©. Stearns, As-
sistant Curator. and Mr. Pierre Louis Jouy, Aid. Assistance has also
been rendered from time to time in their work on the fossils collected
by the U. S. Geological Survey, by Messrs. Frank Burns and G.
Stuart, under my instructions, with the permission of the Director of
the Survey.

The work, as in previous years, has largely consisted of the reduc-
tion to order, classification, labeling, registry, and arrangement in
cases of material either in arrears or received during the current year.
The manner in which this is done has been described in previous reports,
and it does not seem necessary to repeat the details here. Excellent: pro-
gress has been made in the work of bringing up the arrears. Unless
checked by matters beyond the control of the curator, such as the stop-
page of work for alterations in the building, by the necessity of supply-
ing material to exhibitions in other cities from which our department
receives no benefit, or the illness of members of the working force, a
few years will see these arrearages cleared away. As there is no sepa-
ration in a biologic sense, so there has been no separation in an admin-
istrative sense, between the work on mollusks of the tertiary formations
and those obtained from recent seas. ‘To some extent they are kept
separated from reasons of convenience in reference and on account of
the great weight of some of the fossils, which renders it inadvisable to
place them in the same drawer with recent specimens. But it isimprac-
ticable to assort the work as between the two classes of material. The
curator was absent at Philadelphia at two different times during the
past year, aggregating about nine weeks altogether, during which time
he supervised the packing, and to a large extent personally performed
the labor of registration and packing of the very valuable collection
left to the Museum by the late Dr. Isaac Lea. This collection, apart
from the minerals with which the writer has had nothing to do, com-
prised a large number of American and European fossils, largely types
of Dr. Lea’s publications or specimens selected for their beauty and

159
160 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1883.

neat preparation. There were fossils of all ages; not the least interest-
ing were specimens received from Dr. E. Emmons himself, from the
original localities, of forms illustrative of the Taconic formation. here
was also a fine series of plant fossils, chiefly of the Coal Measures.
These varied materials have been distributed to the curators who prop-
erly take in charge such objects, the tertiary fossils and recent shells
falling to the department of mollusks. The typical collection of Unios,
which is without doubt the most valuable in existence, was kept by
Dr. Lea in table cases or drawers with the specimens arranged ina
linear series, in the order adopted in his *‘ Synopsis,” last edition. They
were laid on strips of wood grooved longitudinally, were much crowded,
and occasionally somewhat displaced. Paper numbers and names cut
out of the Synopsis were fastened to the first specimen of each species
by a little wax. These, however, were often displaced, and were, when
in place, ready to fall at a touch. Most of the specimens had pencil
notes of locality, and often of the name, written by Dr. Lea on the in-
side of the shell. While it was easy for a skilled and careful person
on the spot to recover the identification and obtain the other data, if
the specimens had been packed without being registered and perma-
nently marked, their value as types would have been almost wholly
destroyed. In order that no misfortune of this sort should occur, I
personally examined and removed every specimen, identified, and per-
manently numbered it, and, when frail or broken, wrapped and boxed it.
This involved the writing of more than eighty-five thousand figures on
the shells themselves and the registration of some three thousand par-
cels of specimens, representing more than half as many species. The
labor was very arduous, but the specimens were permanently identified
and their typical value insured for the future. The gastropods and
other shells contained in the Lea collection were left to be registered
in Washington, each parcel being in a separate tray in Dr. Lea’s col-
lection, accompanied by one or more manuscript labels. My estimate
of the number of specimens in the collection is about twenty thousand,
and there were sixty-three packing-cases required to hold them, exclu-
sive of duplicates, of which there were agreatmany. Cases to hold this
collection have been provided, in accordance with Dr. Lea’s will, and as
soon as the projected repairs are completed the northeast gallery will
be reserved for this series and other land and fresh-water shells, and
thrown open to the public. The miscellaneous land and fresh-water
shells given by Dr. Lea are numerous and valuable, including the second
best existing series of Cuming’s Philippine land shells, of rare beauty,
and fine original series of land shells from Maderia, Jamaica, and other
localities, named by Lowe, C. B. Adams, and other authorities, and
therefore having for their own species a really typical importance. It
S$ understood that, in accordance with Jaw and by direction of the U.
S. Fish Commission, the collection of Invertebrata, now at New Haven,
in charge of Prof. A. E. Verrill, has been turned over to the Museum,
DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS. 161

at least theoretically. When received, this will add more largely to
the material in the hands of the department of mollusks than any other
accession for some years. As its reception is a matter of uncertainty,
owing to the fact that the time when Professor Verrill’s report on the
Moilusea of the Fish Commission will be ready is entirely uncertain, I
would renew my suggestion of previous years that a proper series of
specimens for study and comparison be sent from New Haven to the
National Museum, where it is much needed. At present, with the mass
of work pressing upon the Department of Mollusks, it is not desirable,
even had Professor Verrill concluded his investigations, to have the
whole mass of the Fish Commission material added to what must be
administered upon. The material received from New Haven up to this
date, excepting Cephalopods in alcohol, is largely duplicate and of
little or no value to the national coliection. But for scientific study and
comparison it is important that a named series of the New England
deep-water and shore fauna, as determined by Professor Verrill, 1872
to 1887, should be accessible to students in Washington.

The total number of accessions to this department during the year is
fifty-two. Of these, fifteen lots were sent for examination and report,
two were received in the regular course from Government agencies,
eight were received in exchange either for material already furnished
or which has been subsequently furnished partly by the Department of
Mollusks and partly by other departments of the Museum. The re-
mainder weredonations. Of these the Isaac Lea collection was the most
important and the largest. The next largest accession was that of some
sixteen boxes, chiefly of Pliocene fossils from California, received from
the U. 8. Geological Survey, and collected by Dr. R. E. C. Stearns.
Dr. Stearns has also given a large number of miscellaneous specimens,
which he obtained during his absence on field-work and which were
very acceptable. A valuable though small collection was obtained in
exchange from the Museum of Wesleyan University, Middletown, Con-
necticut. The specimens were from various localities and to a consider-
able extent filled gaps in the National Collection of mollusks. <A lot of
some twenty supposed new species of Unio, from Florida, was presented
by Mr. B. H. Wright, of Penn Yan, New York, most of which were
new tothe collection. The curator gave some two hundred and fifty
species of mostly marine shells to the Museum during the year, nearly
all being new or important to the collection. A collection of interesting
south European and Turkistan shells were received in exchange from
Herr Otto Goldfuss, to whom American land shells were sent. Most of
the species sent by Herr Goldfuss were already in the collection, but
the localities were interesting and enlarged our geographical series.
Mr. Nicholas Grebnitski, of the Commander Islands, near Kamchatka,
continued his sending of mollusca, and a package received from him
during the year contained very interesting specimens from that remote
corner of the world and added several species to its known mollusk-

fauna. Mr. T. H. Aldrich has sent some acceptable specimens of marine
shells from the Mauritius and some named Kocene fossils. Lieut. J. F.
Moser, U.S. Navy, sent from the coast of Florida some very interest-
ing shells in alcohol, and Mr. Henry Hemphill a most interesting series
of varieties of the limpets of the southern California coast.

Dr. W. H. Rush submitted dredgings from deep water on the Florid-
ian coast to be named, and presented a very valuable series of them to
the Museum. We received in exchange a series of shells of South Africa
from the Albany Museum at Grahamstown, Cape Colony, put up by
the curator, Miss Mary Glanville. While awaiting instructions for
shipping the material to be sent in return we were shocked to receive
news of the death of this gifted and enthusiastic young woman, to whom,
according to South African papers, the cause of science in that country
and the Albany Museum in particular were greatly indebted. We owe
to Mrs. J. H. Everette, of Virginia, a remarkable collection of some
seventy-five pearls taken from a single individual of Ostrea virginica
Gmelin. Besides some fresh-water shells from Iowa the Museum re-
ceived from Mr. R. Ellsworth Call specimens of a singular parasite of
the land shell Succinea obliqua. This parasite Leucochloridium ameri-
canum is a new species of a genus hitherto unknown to North America,
and first characterized from a single species infesting Succinea in France.
The French species is described by Carus and figured in the Journal de
Conchyliologie (vol. xxvil, pl. x, fig. 6) for 1879. It is the larva of
Distoma macrostoma Zeller, and develops in the intestines of thrushes,
nightingales, and other birds which eat the Succinea. It is long and
slender and of a pale apple-green with blackish thaculations near the
largerend. The American species is larger, proportionally stouter, and
of a rusty brown where the European species is green. It is highly
probable that if the naturalists of lowa examine the intestines of the
robin or other coarse-feeding singing birds of that State they will find
the fully developed Distoma corresponding to this species.

The quality of the accessions in general has been good, only ten of
the fifty-two proving valueless to the Museum.

The routine work of the year has largely been spent on the general
series of exotic mollusea, of which a large proportion has been revised ;
onthe Hast American gastropods, including those of the Antillean region
and thence northward to Cape Hatteras, of which chiefly the Pleuroto-
mide and Solenoconcha remain to be revised, and the miocene and
pliocene tertiary fauna-of the United States, especially the deposits ex-
amined last year and to some extent this year, on the west coast of
Florida, from Tampa southward. Work on the gastropods of the Blake
expedition has been continued in connection with the review of the Hast
American forms above referred to. Information or assistance of more
or less importance was furnished to the following persons, among others,
the correspondence often including several letters, and the identifica-
tion of material consuming the available part of several days of labor,

The limited time for research afforded by the duties of the curator
has been devoted (1) to investigations in regard to the deep-sea mollusks
collected by the Blake and Albatross on the eastern coast of the United
States and the Antilles; (2) to a study of the fauna of the Miocene
silex-beds of Tampa Bay, Florida, and of the Pliocene of south Flor-
ida, and (3) to the relations of the members of the Tertiary mollusk
fauna with the recent species of the coast.

The papers published during the year 188788 by the curator and his
associates are noticed in the Bibliography, section 1v of the Report.

In previous reports I have stated why it is impossible to give the
exact number of specimens, species, duplicates, ete., contained in the
collection. In my last report (1886~87) I made the rough estimate that
the collection contained 425,000 specimens of all sorts. Since that time
about 30,000 specimens have been received. The total number of entries
in the Museum register or catalogue for 1886-87 was 10,530, while for
1887-88 the number is 11,804. Had we had adequate clerical assist-
ance the number might easily have been doubled. As it is it repre-
sents about 35,000 separate -specimens, classified, labeled, arranged,
and entered in the register. Omitting a series of about 1,500 duplicate
entries which was made by Dr. Lewis in 1876 in revising the Unionidae
belonging to the National Collection, and all numbers assigned to Pro-
fessor Verrill for his use in cataloguing the Fish Commission dredgings,
and of which the entries have not yet been reported to this department,
though in his possession for use in due course, the total number of
registrations to date is 81,911, representing about 250,000 specimens,
which have been administered upon, and for the most part are arranged
in such a way as to be accessible for study. The largest collection out-
side of the National Museum in this country is supposed to be that of
the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, and they are reported
to possess about 52,000 trays or lots, corresponding to our registration
numbers, or 156,000 registered specimens, against 250,000 in the
_ National Museum, in round numbers. But when we reflect that only
one-eighth of the Jeffreys collection has been registered, none of the
Aretic-Alaskan collection, and but a very small part of the, Antillean
collection of the Fish Commission, or of the Lea collection, it is evident,
164 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

leaving duplicates out of the computation altogether, that the discrep.
ancy is much greater than the above figures would convey. Without
being able to give exact figures, I have no hesitation in stating that it
is probable our mollusk-collectiou is twice as large as any other Ameri-
can collection and larger than any European collection.” In point of
the number of original types it contains it will stand second only to
the collection in the British Museum, and in the fullness of the accom-
panying data and the scientific value of the material contained in it I
have no doubt it is the equal, if not the superior, so far as recent mol-
lusks are concerned, of any collection in the world. It has the best
faunal collection in existence of the British mollusca, of the mollusks
of the North Atlantic sea-bed, of the American Arctic regions, of the
East and West North American coasts, and of the interior land and
fresh water fauna of North America. Notwithstanding all this there
are many gaps to be filled, especially in exotic species, but not until
all arrearages are cleared up and we know exactly how we stand can
we use judiciously the large and valuable supplies of duplicate material
in our possession.

The schedule showing the progress of registration during the past
vear is annexed.

By Dr. C. V. Ritry, Honorary Curator.

Considerable progress has been made during the past year in the
arrangement of material, and much more could have been made but
for the crowded condition of the laboratory, which makes it impossible
to expand and properly arrange the collections. Additional room is
sadly needed, and I earnestly urge that in some way it be obtained.

During the early part of the year a beginning was made in the ar-
rangement of the Coleoptera, and at intervals this has been continued
until all available space is occupied and but the smallest part of the
material worked up. Later some of the large Bombycid Lepidoptera
were arranged in cabinet drawers so far as these held out. In some of
the genera of the Noctuide studies were made of the material ar-
ranged. In the Diptera the Bombyliidz were separated out and tenta-
tively arranged, but there is no shelf room for the boxes, and they are
piled up on the cabinets, reducing the working space, and much more
exposed to infection from Museum pests. A very large part of the
first half of the year was employed in annotating and critically over-
hauling the Glover plates with the view of possibly editing them for
publication.

Early in 1888 a re-arrangement of the collections on the floor of the
Museum gave the department a fair exhibition court, and the collee-
tions already prepared were removed thereto, and other boxes were
prepared, so that we have at present a very fair exhibit collection on
the floor of the Museum. Several table cases, affording considerable
storage room, were also assigned to the department, and have been in
large part filled.

A considerable proportion of the time was occupied in giving infor-
mation about specimens sent, not only those of which accessions were
made, but also of those which, although of no value whatever to the
collection, are often much more troublesome, involving questions as to
life habits, methods of collecting, and determinations.

About one hundred and fifty letters were written exclusive of the re-
ports on accessions, and about twenty lots of species were determined

for students and collectors.

166 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.-

Practically the entire month of June, 1888, was occupied in prepar-
ing for the Cincinnati exposition. | And as the time was limited and no
outside assistance obtainable, I had to draw on the divisional force of
the Department of Agriculture to get the exhibit ready in time. In-
deed the amount of work to be done in arranging our extensive collec-
tion is so great that I earnestly recommend the appointment of an
additional assistant.

The accessions during the year numbered but fifty-eight against one
hundred and two during the previous year. The apparent falling off
is entirely accounted for by the fact that during the summer of 1886
and spring of i887 a very large number of specimens of Belostoma
americana and Dynastes tityus were received, these species appearing
in abnormal quantities in several portions of our territory. This year
for some reason these insects are much less abundant and attracted no
general attention, and hence the apparent decrease in number of acces-
sions received.

As a matter of fact the number of receipts of real value are fully
equal to those of the previous year, and, as before, many species and
specimens were added by myself and assistants, of which no formal
record was made. Indeed, as in previous years, by far the largest
amount of valuable material has been added as the result of my work
as United States entomologist. These collections come from the vari-
ous field agents of the Department of Agriculture and those made
by Mr. Albert Koebele, of Alameda, California, Mr. D. W. Coquillett,
of Los Angeles, California, and. by Mr. Lawrence Bruner, of West
Point, Nebraska, are particularly worthy of mention. These, with the
constant material that daily comes to the Division of Entomology from
its correspondents, have been turned over by me without special acces-
sion numbers, and I mention them particularly here because the perma-
nent numbered accessions give no sort of idea of the rich additions
which are constantly being made to our collections. In the future I
hope to have the work so systematized that I can indicate the more
important of these additions by accession number.

The following is a list of the more important numbered accessions,
which represent many hundreds of specimens:

In August one specimen Acanthocinus nodosus from Robert A. Mills, Chuluota,
Florida. No. 19,478. The specimen wasa fine one and was very acceptable, though
the species is represented in our collections.

In September there was added a vial of winged Termites from R. Hitchcock, Osaka,
Japan. No. 19,302. Interesting from their locality, and for comparison with our
own species. *

Eighteen vials of Arachnida and Myriopoda from Macon, Georgia, collected by L.
M. Underwood. No. 19,526.

Six vials of Arachnida and Myriopoda from Indian Springs, Georgia, collected by L.
M. Underwood. No. 19,533.

Six vials of Arachnida and Myriopoda from Georgia, collected by L. M. Underwood.
No. 19,542. Prof. L. M. Underwood, of Syracuse, New York, was for two months—
August and September, 1887—in the employ of the Department as a collector of
DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS, 167

Arachnida and Myriopoda, and his collections, made principally in Georgia, are of great
interest, and add very largely to the Museum collection in these classes.

Kight species of Orthoptera and Neuwroptera were from E. A. Schwarz, Washington,
District of Columbia, collected at Cocoanut Grove, Florida. No. 19,535. Principal
among these was a specimen of Oligotoma hubbardi of the Neuropterous family Embidae,
a very rare species.

Seven specimens of 4 species of Callimorpha from Mr. H. F. Schoenborn, Washington,
District of Columbia. No. 18,565. These are valuable as varieties not represented in
the Museum collection or as very tine specimens.

In October, 263 species in 729 specimens of Syrphid@ from Dr. 8. W. Williston,
New Haven, Connecticut. No. 19,702. These are the types of Bulletin U. S. National
Museum 31, mentioned in the last report. The collection is almost complete, and by
all odds the best collection of the family extant. The material of the Museum from
other sources will be added and arranged as soon as practicable. This is the most
valuable accession of the year.

In November a lot of Myriopoda and Arachnida, Virginia and New York, from L. M.
Underwood. No. 19,758. This contained the balance of the material collected by
Professor Underwood while in the employ of the Museum.

Miscellaneous lot of insects from Truxillo, Honduras, collected by Chas. H. Town-
send, U. S. National Museum. No. 19,811. Contained a considerable number of
bright and attractive species, representing some of the more common species of the
locality.

In January a lot of Central American Longicornia and Carabidae, determined by H.
W. Bates, from Messrs. Godman & Salvin, 10 Chandos Street, Cavendish Square,
London, England. No. 20,007. This is a valuable lot of insects, typical of many of
the species described in the Biologia Centrali Americana, and forming in the two
families represented an excellent nucleus for a Central American collection.

Also a large lot of unmounted Madagascar Coleoptera from Edward Bartlett, Maid-
stone, Kent, England (through Robert Ridgway). No. 20,093. Valuable as being
the first representation of the insects of this region. ' The specimens have not yet been
mounted.

In February, 14 new species of Myriopods from C. H. Bollman, Bloomington, Indiana.
No. 20,155. Types of species described in the Proceedings of the U.S. National
Museum.

In March, 133 specimens of 36 species of Diptera from D. W. Coquillett, Los Angeles,
. California, through the Curator. No. 20,336. This lot contained mostly Bombyltidz

from California or adjacent localities, and very largely typical of species described by
Mr. Coquillett.

In April a small lot of Lepidoptera from State Laboratory of Natural History, Cham-
paign, Illinois. No. 20,395. Quite aseries of fine specimens were sent on for deter-
mination by the above institution, from which several very good species were obtained
for the Museum.

In May, 3 species in 7 specimens of Lachnosterna from E, A. Schwarz, Washington,
District of Columbia. No. 20,639. Florida species, not represented in our collection,
apd obtained in exchange.

The larger part of the routine work is the care and preservatior of the
collections. In no other department perhaps is there as much danger
of injury from Museum pests or more care and time required to keep
up the character of-specimens. The time thus spent shows very little
apparent result. The mounting and placing of accessions and work of
preparation also takes up a large portion of time.

Still a great deal has been accomplished in the line of systematic
arrangement of both exhibit and study series, the general review of
which will be found in the beginning of this Report.
168 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

In the autumn and early winter the curator made another trip to
Europe, taking with him a number of interesting and undetermined
species, especially among the Micro-lepidoptera, for determination and
comparison. A number of correspondents and specialists were met
and a number of notes in some of the largest museums were made.

In August, 1887, both the curator and the assistant curator, Mr. J. B.
Smith, attended the meeting of the American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science at New York City. Mr. Smith took with him a
series of the undetermined Geometride in the Museum collection for
comparison with the New York collections, and nearly all of these were
determined.

During this trip quite a number of collections were examined by Mr.
Smith, and some good material was obtained for our collection.

A large lot of material was received through the curator from the
Department of Agriculture, and its proper disposition occupied consid-
erable time.

During September the curator was absent in Kurope, while the as-
sistant was on leave during the greater portion of the month. The
time available was entirely devoted to overhauling the collection, to
correspondence, and to placing the material received, which was un-
usually abundant.

During the month of October the Williston collection of Syrphide
was received at the Museum, and this, containing 263 species in 729
specimens, was carefully gone over, checked, and general condition
noted.

The Sphingidw or Hawk Moths were re-arranged in conformity with a
monograph which Mr. Smith has been preparing and which is referred
to later on.

The series contains 69 species in 250 specimens. The duplicates were
also arranged and formed a series of 39 species in 167 specimens, the
majority of which, however, were used later in the exhibit series.

In the same family the biologic material was also arranged, and illus-
trates more or less completely 27 species. There are 64 imagines, 60
blown larvee, 23 pup, and 34 vials, containing upwards of 50 speci-
mens of larve and eggs. Altogether about 231 specimens in the series.
There are, in addition, a series of, as yet, undetermined larve.

In the Coleoptera the family Cicindelide was classified and arranged
in seven boxes. The collection contains 99 species and varieties in 713

‘specimens, and is therefore an extremely rich one.
A duplicate series, formed at the same time, shows 47 species and va-
rieties in 747 specimens.

In November an unusual number of species for determination were
received from correspondents of the Museum, from some of which good
material was obtained for our collection.

In the Orthoptera the unnamed material in Acridiide was selected
out-and sent to Mr. Lawrence Bruner, of West Point, Nebraska, for
DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS. 169

study, at hisrequest. his material was returned jater, with some addi-
tions new to the collection.

In Coleoptera the systematic arrangement has been contitued, and
nine of the Carabid genera were arranged in eight boxes. Thus far 83
species and varieties are represented, and the material has not yet
been entirely sifted. The extreme wealth of material, the number of
the collections among which it is scattered, and the small size of some
of the species renders the task of arrangement a slow one.

In the Lepidoptera the family Saturniide has been arranged in five
cabinet drawers. We have 17 species in 58 spevimens, and but 4 spe-
cies are needed to complete the family. Of duplicates we have 7 spe-
cies in 47 specimens, a large proportion of which were subsequently
used in the exhibit series.

From Dr. Marx, of the Department of Agriculture, were received
one hundred and twenty-six vials of named Arachnida, many of them
specimens which had been previously turned over to him for study, but
quite a number of which were donated by him. These were all mounted
on vial blocks and temporarily arranged.

Considerable time was spent in going over a portion of the collection
for Museum pests.

During December the work of thoroughly examining the collection
was completed and the ordinary routine matters attended to. +

In January, 1888, the re-arrangement of material on the floor of the
Museum placed a court at the disposal of this Department for exhibit
purposes. What had already been prepared was moved into this new
Space, and work was vigorously prosecuted on a series of exhibition
boxes, some of which were completed, but none placed, owing to the
lack of cases. A very fair show, however, was made with the space
and material at our command.

Some of the Lepidopterous family Noctuwidw were placed in cabinet
drawers, and a small amount of systematic work done.

In February, 1888, two boxes of American butterflies were completed
and placed on exhibition. The assignment of additional table cases to
this department added considerably to our storage room and much
materia! was transferred from the laboratory to these cases.

The Coleoptera were carefully sifted for material in Lachnosterna,
which was roughly arranged, and a selected series sent to Dr. George
H. Horn, of Philadelphia, for study.

A large lot of Diptera, principally Bombyliide, and many typical,
were received from Mr. D. W. Coquillett, one of my agents at Los An-
geles, California, and turned over to the department.

In March, six additional boxes for the exhibition series were prepared
and put on public view.

The Bombyliid material received last month suggested an overhaul-
ing of our material in the family, which was begun.

In April the work on the Bombyliide was continned and completed.
170 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Twenty-four boxes are used in the arrangement and there are nearly
four boxes of duplicate material. The collection in this family is ex-
tremely rich, as I have been especially interested in it smce my studies
of the enemies of the Rocxy Mountain locust began. Efforts will be
made to have it monographically studied.

The material in Lachnosterna having been returned by Dr. Horn, its
arrangement was begun. Six additional boxes were prepared and
placed on exhibition.

The month of May was devoted to the study of our material in Lach-
nosterna, which was very largely augmented by the efforts of Mr. Smith
and of my assistants in the Department of Agriculture, Messrs. Schwarz,
Pergande, and Alwood, who collected many thousands of specimens of
the local species.

Almost the entire month of June was employed directly or indirectly
in preparing a series of boxes for the exposition at Cincinnati, Ohio, and
. forty-eight boxes were completed and sent off. In this work Dr. George
Marx prepared the Arachnida, and Mr. Tyler Townsend, assigned from
the Department of Agriculture, assisted during a portion of the month
in the work of preparation.

This series, entirely unique and, so far as completed, of great educa-
tional value, is in effect a classification of the entire Insecta illustrated
by the specimens themselves and by drawings Twenty-eight boxes,
containing 559 species in 1,684 specimens and 683 drawings, were made
up. Hight boxes, also belonging to the series, but previously prepared,
contained 571 species in 2,410 specimens and 257 drawings. In all,
this series contains 1,130 species, 4,094 specimens, and 920 drawings,
representing all orders save the Hemiptera, the Diptera, and the Hy-
menoptera.

There were also sent from the general exhibit series eight boxes of
forestry insects and four boxes of insects affecting cultivated plants,
the number of specimens in which can not readily be estimated and
were not counted. ~

The assistant curator has during the year been quite active in origi-
nal work largely connected with the arrangement of the Museum ma-
terial. This has been chiefly in Lepidoptera, and will be indicated in
detail in the list of writings.

In the-Sphingide he has completed his studies for the monograph
long since begun. This is an important paper, which should have been
published as a bulletin of the Department, and I regret that, because
of the inevitable delay in getting it out from the Government Printing
Office, Mr. Smith chose to publish it in the pu enceedines of the Ameri-
can Entomological Society.

- In the arrangement of the Arctiide Mr. Smith made some critical
notes on the species of Arctia, the results of which were presented to the
American Association for the Advancement of Science at the New
York meeting. He has also made some extremely interesting notes on
the genus Lachnosterna, which are not yet in shape for publication.
DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS. Buy

The monograph of the Noctuidae, referred to in the previous report,
has received some small additions, several genera having been studied,
among them Homohadena and Oncocnemis.

The papers published by the assistant curator and myself, as well as
by other collaborators of the Museum, are noticed in the bibliography,
the closing part of the report.

I would refer to the last annual report for a statement of the con-
dition of the collections, which, with the preceding statement of what has
been done during the year, will give a very good idea of their present
state. There have been added during the year, chiefly from Califor-
nia, probably some ten thousand specimens, including many additional
species and some very valuable study material.

A very large increase has been made in the exhibit series, but the
present state of that series, broken as it is in preparing for Cincinnati,
has made an enumeration impracticable.

The last catalogue entry for June, 1887, was 349, and the last entry
for June, 1888, is 405.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES IN THE
U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888,

By RicHarRD RAaTHBUN, Honorary Curator.

During the past year the curator has been able to give less attention
than usual to the affairs of this department in consequence of his in-
creased duties in connection with the Fish Commission. The repairs
in progress during most of tle year at the western end of the Smith-
sonian Institution, where all the specimens under his charge are stored,
have also tended to interfere with the work upon collections, and ne-
cessitated the closing of the exhibition hall to the public. The acces-
sions have been fewer in number, and the quantity of material received
has been much less than fcr several years past. This was due in large
part to the fact that comparatively few explorations were made by the
Fish Commission during the spring and summer, and that since the re-
organization of the latter bureau in the winter the collections of marine
invertebrates made by the field parties have been retained by the com-
mission pending their examination and description. The current work
of the department has, however, been kept up and the collections have
been maintained in good condition but no attempt was made to enlarge
the exhibition series, although we now have the means of greatly im-
proving its character and appearance through recent accessions to the
department.

Whiie giving almost all his time to the business of the Fish Com-
mission, by retaining his office and work-rooms at the Museum, the cura-
tor has found it possible to exercise general supervision over the col-
lections in his care. His investigations, however, have related chiefly
to subjects having a more or less direct bearing upon the practical
problems before the Commission, and have had little reference to the
Museum collections. There is, consequently, but slight progress to
report, either in the classification of specimens and the enlargement of
the study series or in the selection of duplicates for exchange. Prof.
A. E. Verrill has continued to administer upon the Fish Commission
collections at Yale College, which are in the custody of the Museum.

Very extensive and important natural history results were accom-
plished by the Fish Commission during the year, especially on the voy-
age of the steamer Albatross from Norfolk, Virginia, to San Francisco,

173
174 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

which occupied about six months. The large collections of marine in-
vertebrates made during this trip will not directly benefit the Museum,
but it is expected that the type series of each group will be transferred
to its keeping as fast as they are studied and described. ‘There have
been no important explorations besides those of the Fish Commission
which have contributed to our stores.

Duplicate sets belonging to Series Iv, prepared some time ago, have
been distributed to twenty-two institutions of learning located in dif-
ferent parts of the country, but no additional sets of the same charac-
ter have been made up during the year.

Thirty-three accessions were received by this department during the
year, of which seventeen were contributed by or through the United
States Fish Commission. A much smalier quantity of material than
usual was sent in from the Wood’s Holl Station, the steamer Albatross
having made only a single dredging trip during the summer, and the
inshore work of the steamer Fish Hawk having afforded comparatively
few specimens that were considered of sufficient importance for perma-
nent preservation in the Museum. The Albatross collection was, how-
ever, obtained chiefly from deep water, and contained many rare forms.
The cruise of the schooner Grampus to the Gulf of St. Lawrence and to
the outer coast of Newfoundland, during the summer, also yielded an
interesting though small lot of specimens, mostly crustaceans and echin-
oderms, which were collected on the shores and by the use of the surface
net. The collections made in the vicinity of Wood’s Holl, Massachu-
setts, by Mr. Vinal N. Edwards, from October to June, were of special
_ value, consisting for the most part of the internal and external parasites

of fishes and of surface towings. Several contributions were received
from the Gloucester fishermen, the most important being a large and
fine specimen of the tree coral, Paragorgia arborea, froma depth of 200
fathoms, off Banquereau. This specimen forms a valuable addition to
the exhibition series of the Museum, having greater spread and being
in a better state of preservation than any now in the cases. Among
other donations from the Fish Commission worthy of mention are 4 se-
ries of crustaceans obtained in the vicinity of Great Egg Harbor, New
Jersey, by Dr. T. H. Bean, and a number of parasites of the striped
bass, collected in Virginia by Mr. 8. G. Worth.

From Mr. N. Grebnitzky, of Bering Island, eastern Siberia, there
was received a very important addition to his collection of two years ago,
consisting chiefly of small species of crustaceans, worms, echinoderms,
and sponges, from Bering Island. Dr. P. Herbert Carpenter, of Eton
College, England, has contributed well preserved specimens of two spe-
cies of crinoids which are new to our collection, namely, Pentacrinus
Wyville-Thomsoni, from the Eastern Atlantic, and Antedon phalangium,
from the coast of Tunis, both collected in 1870, by H. B. M.S. Poreu-
pine. Many specimens of Gammarus and two specimens of leeches, col-
lected in Missouri, were presented by Mr, . Ellsworth Call, and a spec-
DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES. 1s

imen of Sebastes marinus infested with a new and large species of
lernzan parasite, was received from Mr. E.G. Blackford, of New York.

As elsewhere explained, the curator and his two assistants were at
Wood’s Holl, Massachusetts, from early in July until the first part of Oc-
tober; but although the work there in hand was connected directly with
the investigations of the Fish Commission, it consisted in large part of
the assorting and preservation of collections which in the autumn were
transferred to the custody of the National Museum. Mr. A. H. Bald-
win, who had been employed in the department during the previous two
years, resigned his position in October, and for the remainder of the
year the curator was assisted only by Miss M.J. Rathbun. Being
obliged to give nearly ali of his time to Fish Commission duties, the
eurator has but little progress to record either in the arrangement and
classification of the collections or in the enlargement of the exhibition
series. The current work was, however, promptly attended to, and all
collections received were assorted, catalogued, and properly cared for.
The extensive alterations in connection with the fire-proofing of a part
of the west end of the Smithsonian Institution, which continued during
nearly the entire year, greatly interfered with the work of the depart-
ment and necessitated our vacating for that time about one-half of the
space alletted to the alcoholic collections of marine invertebrates. The
main part of the collections being thus crowded together in a much
smaller area than they ordinarily occupied, it was impossible to give
them all the care they required, but no serious losses appear to have
been sustained during this period. Before the close of the year the
small room and hall space assigned to this department in the west base-
ment had been refitted with cases and the specimens were being
returned to their old quarters. No changes have been made in the gal-
lery of the main hall, where the dried specimens are stored. The exhi-
bition hall has necessarily been closed to the public, in consequence otf
the repairs to the fish hall through which access to it is gained.

A small representative series of specimens was supplied to Mr.
Frederick A. Lucas as the nucleus of a synoptical collection of marine
invertebrates, which was exhibited in part at the Cincinnati Centennial
Exposition during the summer of 1888.

The greater part of the routine work, including the sorting and cata-
loguing of collections and the supervision of the alcoholic specimens,
which require constant attention to insure their safety, has devolved
upon Miss Rathbun, to whom credit is chiefly due for the excellent con-
_ dition of the department at the end of the fiscal year.

While at Wood’s Holl, during the summer of 1887, the curator con-
tinued his studies upon the crustacean parasites of the fishes of that
region, completing the descriptions and drawings of several species
which have been submitted for publication in the proceedings ef the
Museum. Reports upon the genus Heliaster of starfishes, and the
genera Porites and Synarcea, of corals, have been finished and published
during the year. The curator has also found time to examine and re-
port upon the interesting collection of surface towings made by the
Fish Commission schooner Grampus during the spring of 1887, on the
early mackerel grounds. The study of this material, which consists
for the most part of very small organisms, belonging to several groups
of invertebrates, and constituting the food of the mackerel, was con-
sidered to be of considerable importance, as changes in its abundance
and character from year to year, taken in connection with the changes
in temperature, may throw some light on the movements of that impor-
tant market fish. No general deductions can be drawn, however, from
the study of the collections made in one season only, but it is proposed
to continue the investigations during subsequent years, and a similar
collection was made by the Grampus in the spring of 1888. It has not
yet been carefully examined.

It may not be out of place in this connection to mention the set of
temperature charts now in course of preparation for the Fish Commis- ©
sion, and covering long series of observations made at over seventy-
five stations of the Ligbt-House Board and Signal Service. These
stations are distributed along both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of
the United States and the Great Lakes, and some are located on im-
portant rivers. These observations are being reduced and plotted for
the purpose of obtaining positive information respecting the water
temperatures as influencing the movements of the principal commercial
fishes, but it is expected that they will also prove of interest in
connection with the study of-all marine and fresh-water animals and —
plants.
DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES. 177

There have been several collaborators of the Museum located at
other institutions as in former years. Prof. A. E. Verrill, at Yale
College, has continued his studies upon several groups of marine in-
vertebrates from the dredgings of the Fish Commission, on the eastern
coast of the United States, and has been assisted by Miss K. J. Bush.
Prof. 8S. I. Smith, also of Yale College, has been at work upon the
erustacea derived from the same source. Prof. Edwin Linton, of
Washington and Jefferson College, Pennsylvania, has made rapid prog-
ress with his studies of the Trematode parasites of fishes, mainly
collected by himself at the Wood’s Holl Station, being assisted in the
preparation of his plates by Mrs. Linton. A second large report upon
the subject was nearly completed at the close of the year. Prof. Leslie
A. Lee’s work upon the foraminifera of the Fish Commission has been
’ deferred for a time, in consequence of his acting as chief naturalist of
the steamer Albatross during the cruise from Norfolk to San Francisco.
Mr. J. Walter Fewkes, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cam-
bridge, has continued to report upon the free Medusz collected by the
Albatross.

As it has been the custom hitherto to transfer most of the natural his-
tory collections made by the vessels and field parties of the Fish Com-
mission directly to the custody of the National Museum, where they
could be safely cared for without additional expense to the Commission,
it has been deemed appropriate to give in each of these annual reports
a brief account of the explorations in the course of which the materials
were obtained. As recording the origin and general character of the
specimens made available for scientific study by the investigations of
the Commission, these accounts, it was supposed, could not fail to be of
interest and value to those who desired to consult the collections.
During the past fiscal year, with the death of Professor Baird and the
placing of the National Museum and the Fish Commission under separate
management, the policy of the Commission with respect to its collections
of marine animals has been modified, and they will be retained in its
possession until finally worked up and described. The first or principal
series of specimens will then, however, become the property of the
Museum, and the expediency of reporting upon the explorations: in this
counection seems therefore as urgent as before.

The steamer Albatross was prevented, in consequence of the exten-
sive preparations necessary for her cruise to the Pacific Ocean, from en-
gaging in any investigations before the middle of September, and at
that time only a single trip was attempted between Chesapeake Bay
and Wood’s Holl. This trip was also planned practically for the purpose
of testing her new boilers, but during the voyage a line of twelve dredg-
ings with the beam trawl was successfully made in depths of 102 to 1,276
fathoms, along the outer edge of the submerged continental plateau and
the inner part of the Gulf Stream. The collections obtained were landed
and examined at Wood’s Holl, and in the fall were sent in part to the

178 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

National Museum, and in part to Professors Verrill and Smith, at Yale
College, for further study. After remaining about a month at Wood’s
Holl to complete repairs, the Albatross returned to Washington, and on
November 21 left Norfolk on the long contemplated trip to the North
Pacific Ocean. The steamer was in command of Lieut. Commander
Z. L. Tanner, U.S. Navy, as heretofore, with Prof. Leslie A. Lee in
charge of the civilian scientific staff, assisted by Mr. Thomas Lee and
Mr. Charles H. Townsend, as naturalists, and Mr. Dennis Cole, as pre-
parator. In view of the interesting character of the region through
which the steamer would pass on the voyage of several months, it was
planned to have her undertake as much scientific work on the way as
could be accomplished without unduly prolonging the cruise or prevent-
ing the steamer arriving at San Francisco in time for the summer ex-
plorations on the northern coasts. Dredgings were to be made occa-
sionally, and the naturalists were to be allowed to make collections at
each of the coaling ports, as well as at a few other localities, paying
special attention, however, to the economic fishes and fishery methods,
_ wherever they stopped. The following places were visited, and at
nearly all of them large quantities of valuable material bearing upon
the natural history of the region were obtained: The island of Santa
Lucia, in the West Indies; Bahia, the Abrolhos Islands, Montevideo ;
Sandy Point, and other localities in the Straits of Magellan; Lota,
Panama, the Galapagos Islands, Acapulco, and La Paz. A series of
dredgings was carried through the Straits of Magellan, the inland
passage being made from the eastern entrance to Port Otway, Chili.
The trip to the Galapagos Islands was attended with very successful
results, and in addition to a large miscellaneous collection of marine and
land animals and plants made there, the naturalists secured fourteen
living specimens of the interesting iand tortoises which are peculiar to
those islands, where they are now becoming exceedingly rare. They
were transported safely to San Francisco and are now in the zoological
garden of the National Museum at Washington. Collections of the
shore fishes of the outer coast of Lower California were also obtained
by Seining at several places.

The total number of dredging stations made during the voyage was
ninety-one, the depths of water ranging from 54 to 1,379 fathoms.
Twenty-four stations, with depths of 10 to 1,019 fathoms, were in the
Atlantic Ocean between the West Indies and the eastern entrance to the
Straits of Magellan ; fifteen, with depths of 17 to 449 fathoms, were in
the Straits of Magellan; and fifty-two, with depths of 54 to 1,379 fathoms,
were in the Pacific Ocean between Port Otway and San Francisco.

The Albatross arrived at San Francisco May 14, and at once began
preparations for the Alaskan cruise, on which she sailed July 4. The
collections made during the voyage from Norfolk to San Francisco were
shipped overland to Washington. They filled over one hundred large
cases, and were received in the very best condition. The fishes, marine

invertebrates and algz, will be assigned by the Fish Commissioner to
several experts for examination and report. The misceilaneous collec-
tions, obtained incidentally during the cruise, and containing many
specimens of birds, reptiles, insects, plants, ethnology, etc., have been
transferred directly to the National Museum.

The Fish Commission steamer Fish Hawk was at Wood’s Holl during
a part of the summer, assisting in the scientific investigations being
carried on at that place, but her collections contained comparatively few
Specimens which it was thought advisable to preserve for permanent
keeping in the National Museum. During the same season, the schooner
Grampus proceeded along the coast of the British Provinces as far as
Labrador, visiting both the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the outer coast of
Newfoundland, in quest of information respecting the movements and
abundance of the mackerel which were said to have reappeared on the
northeastern coast of the latter island. Mr. F. A. Lucas and Mr.
William Palmer, of the National Museum, accompanied the Grampus as
naturalists, making collections of marine and land animals whenever the
opportunity occurred. In the spring of 1888 the Grampus repeated its
cruise of the previous year on the early mackerel grounds, between Cape
Hatteras and Cape Cod, Dr. T. H. Bean acting asnaturalist. The work
continued from about April 1 to near the end of the year. The most
important zoological results were obtained by means of towing nets
which were kept constantly in use, skimming the surface of the ocean, and
securing large quantities of young fishes, fish eggs, and invertebrates,
the latter forming the principal food of the mackerel. This collection
has not yet been reported upon, and itis, therefore, impossible at present
to describe its contents or value. The floating fish eggs, which were
taken in immense numbers, were placed in the hatching apparatus on
board the schooner and some of the spawn was subsequently transferred
to the Wood’s Holl laboratory. Many embryos werereared to different
ages, and preserved for future examination and indentification.

The Wood’s Holl Station was occupied as usual during the summer
months, or from the Ist of July, until October, for the purposes of scien-
tific investigation. The composition of the party was nearly the same
aS in 1886. Professor Baird was there in the beginning, but too ill to
give more than the most general directions. While he lived, Maj. T. B.
- Ferguson, the Assistant Commissioner, assumed charge of operations,
and after his death, in August, the work was directed from Washington
~ by Professor G. Brown Goode.

Prof. A. E. Verrill was in charge of the laboratory, assisted by Mr.
Richard Rathbun, who attended to the routine duties in connection
with the administration of the work. The scientific staff in the service
ot the Commission consisted of Prof. S. I. Smith, of Yale College;
Dr. J. H. Kidder, of Washington; Prof. Leslie A. Lee, of Bowdoin
College; Prof. Edwin Linton, of Washington and Jefferson College;
Mr. Sanderson Smith, of New York; Mr. Thomas Lee, of the steamer

H. Blake, of Cambridge, as artist; Mr. Peter Parker, Mr. A. H. Baldwin,
and Miss M. J. Rathbun, of Washington; and Miss K. J. Bush and
Miss C. E. Bush, assistants of Professcr Verrill. The aquaria which
were made an important and valuable feature of the laboratory, were
under the management of Mr. William P. Seal. Tables in the labora-
tory were also occupied by Dr. Osler, of Philadelphia, Mr. Sho Watase,
of Johns Hopkins University, and Mr. Miyabe, of Harvard University.

Mr. Vinal N. Edwards assisted in procuring specimens for the use of
the scientific party during the summer, and continued his collecting
through the remainder of the year, securing valuable materials in those
seasons when the station is seldom visited by the professional naturalist.
In addition to the explorations made by the steamers a great deal of
seining for shore fishes was done in the vicinity of the station under
the direction of Mr. Thomas Lee.

DISTRIBUTION OF DUPLICATES.

The following institutions have been supplied with sets of marine in-
vertebrates, belonging to duplicate series No. IV, the character and
preparation of which have been described in former reports :

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY IN THE
U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

By FREDERICK W. TrRuE, Acting Curator.

The care of the large amount of osteological material on hand and
constantly being received, and the work of rendering it available for
study, are together sufficient to fully occupy the time of the preparator,

and it has consequently been impossible to prepare for study or for ex-
hibition purposes any other class of material.

It is intended, however, that the department shall eventually be in
every sense a department of comparative anatomy, and as fast as prac-
ticable steps will be taken towards that end.

The accessions during the year, indicated by the numbers in the
osteological catalogue, were: Mammals, 305; birds, 227; reptiles, 3;
fishes, 1; a total of 536. A large number of these were of common but
desirable species, needed for the study series.

A fine collection of skulls of small mammals was received from Dr.
J. C. Merrill, U.S. Army, skeletons of male and female orangs were
obtained by exchange, and a skeleton of the pygmy sperm whale was
presented by the U.S. Life-Saving Service.

Some bones of the extinct Dodo (Didus ineptus), and Solitaire (Pezo-
phaps solitarius), were received from the Cambridge University Mu-
seum, England, and a large collection of bones of the extinct Great Auk
were secured by Mr. Lucas, who was detailed to accompany the U.S.
Fish Commission schooner Grampus on a voyage to the northeast coast
of Newfoundland. Many skeletons of sea-birds were obtained during
the same voyage. The collection of bones of the Great Auk contains
the remains of several hundred individuals, and although from the
length of time that has elapsed since the extermination of the Auk the
majority are in a poor state of preservation, it is believed that the col-
lection outranks all other collections of the kind.

From this material skeletons have been sent to the Museum of Com-
parative Zoology in Cambridge, Mass., and the American Museum of
Natural History, New York.

The curator desires to acknowledge the continued courtesies of Mr.

' A. E. Brown, superintendent of the Philadelphia Zoological Society,
Mr. W. A. Conklin, director of the Central Park Menagerie, and Dr.

182 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

C. Hart Merriam, Chief of the Bureau of Economic Ornithology in the
Department of Agriculture.

For reasons given in the report of the osteological preparator, only
twenty-five specimens have been added during the year to those pre-
viously on exhibition, but each one of these has filled some gap in the
exhibition series.

Over one hundred and fifty specimens have been added to the study
series, and the work of labeling and properly arranging the entire study
series has progressed as steadily as possible with the force available.
_ During the year a large and valuable collection of birds and embryos

of birds preserved in alcohol was transferred from the department of
birds. It contains much interesting material, and a card catalogue of
it, which is very much needed, will be undertaken at the earliest op-
portunity.

Printed labels for the specimens on exhibition have been supplied as
fast as possible.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS (PALEO-
ZOIC) IN THE U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888,

By C. D. Waucort, Honorary Curator.

The main object of the year’s work has been to prepare and place on
exhibition a representative series of fossils from each of the larger di-
visions of the Paleozoic group of strata. This was accomplished in
the preliminary arrangement of material in fifteen exhibition cases.
The labeling of the species is tentative, as the material has not been
critically reviewed owing to the desire to first have it all recorded and
labeled as originally indentified by the various parties who have had
it in charge, either in private collections or in the collections of the Geo-
logical Surveys and those of the Smithsonian Institution. With few
exceptions all of the old collections have been thus labeled.

There are now 10,955 specimens on exhibition, some of which will be
replaced by better specimens; and new material will also be added from
time to time.

The addition to the collections, as given in the list of accessions,
Section Vv of the Report, shows a good growth, but not in proportion to
- the increase which will be secured from the Geological Survey the pres-
ent year. There are now over ten thousand specimens to be studied
and transferred. Over five thousand specimens were collected from
typical localities of the Lower Silurian System, in New York and Ver-
mont. As the Museum collections are very deficient in the fauna
from this system of rocks, the addition will be of great value. A series
of the specimens have, however, been placed in the exhibition cases,
although not yet transferred from the Geological Survey to the Museum.

Dr. R. R. Gurley was absent in the field during the early part of the
year collecting fossils in Tennessee. After his return and recovery
from illness he worked on the collections until the close of the year.

In connection with the work of the Geological Survey I was absent
from the city seven months of the year. When in the city my time

183
184 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

was given to looking after laboratory work and in the preparation of a
paper on ‘‘ The Taconic System cf Emmons, and the use of the name
Taconic in Geologic nomenclature.” This study prevented the continu-
ance of that of the Upper Cambrian Terrane. This latter will be re-
sumed during the ensuing year.

I respectfully repeat the recommendation madein my report for the
last fiscal year, “ that a sum be set aside each year for the increase of
the collection by purchase and by sending out collectors.”

In the report for 1885-’86 a summary was given of the material in the
collections, and in the report for the last fiscal year (1886-’87) the acces-
sions were given. To that there are now to be added the accessions of
the year just ended, which represent 158 specimens. The catalogue
numbers taken up during the year are from 17,497 to 17,896, both in-
clusive.

The material selected for the exhibition series includes 10,955 speci-
mens, as follows:

The exhibition cases, thus far assigned to my department, do not
furnish sufficient space for making a representative display of all the
species; hence it has been planned to have a study and reference col-
lection arranged in the drawers, beneath the eases. The duplicate

specimens will be packed until storage cases can be secured for them.
-_ The plan of arrangement of the exhibition series is zoologic, within
certain geologic series of rocks; the first object being to show the
stratigraphic succession of the faunas. Later on, when the collections
are larger and more thoroughly worked up, a typical zoologic series
should be arranged in connection with material from the Mesozoic and
Cenozoic groups and recent invertebrates.

A list of the publications which appeared during the year and which
were based on studies of the material contained in the collections or
from field work done by myself, is given in the Bibliography, section
Iv of the Report.

IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

By Dr. C. A. Wuitr, Honorary Curator.

The accessions to the collections, other than the material transferred
from the U.S. Geological Survey to the Museum, have been compar-
atively few, the most important being accession 20525, part of the
valuable collection of the late Dr. Isaac Lea. This accession has not
yet been arranged or entered on the catalogue. It contains several
_ hundred excellent specimens representing, perhaps, three hundred
species. The fossils are mostly European, and many genera and
species characteristic of the European Mesozoic are embraced in this
collection.

Most of the time of the honorary curator and his assistant, Mr. C.
B. Boyle, has been devoted to the work of the U. 8S. Geological Survey,
both being connected with that bureau. Much work has been done,
however, in the way of identification of material sent in by different
persons interested in paleontology, and many letters have been written
in answer to inquiries addressed directly to the Honorary Curator.

A card catalogue of the collections has been made, giving the name,
number, and location in the collections of all the identified specimens.
The usefulness of this catalogue will depend largely upon a permanent
arrangement of the collections.

No material has yet been put on exhibition, but a good representa-
tion of the Mesozoic formations of North America can be put out as
soon as exhibition cases are provided.

The published works of the honorary curator have been based
mostly on material collected by himself and assistants, but the collec-
tions of the Museum have been frequently and advantageously con-
sulted. In the Bibliography (section Iv) will be found a list of papers
by the curator which have been published during the year. The fol-
lowing papers were also written, but have not yet been published:

Bulletin £1, U. S. Geological Survey, embracing five articles:

(1) New Fossil Mollusca from the Chico-Tejon series of California.

(2) On the occurrence of equivalents of the Chico-Tejon series in Oregon and Wash-
ington Territory.

(3) Cretaceous Fossils from the Vancouver Island region.

(4) The Molluscan Fauna of the Puget Group.
(5) Mesozoic Mollusca from the southern coast of the Alaskan Peninsula.

nia. (Monograph x11, U.S. Geological Survey, pp. 226-232, pls. 11 and Iv, by Dr. G.

jacent parts of Utah and Wyoming. (Ninth Annual Report U.S. Geological Survey.)

No attempt has been made to separate the collections into a reserve
and exhibition series. The type specimens are kept apart trom the
other material and will form the larger part of the exhibition series.
Quite a number of duplicates can be selected from the collections for
exchange, but no exchanges of any consequence have yet been made.

The collection as a whole is in a very good condition. Most all the
material belonging to the Museum has been identified, labeled, and
properly entered on the catalogue. The space on tke northeast balcony
of the Smithsonian building, formerly used for storage, has been given
up, and the material in the study series has been moved into the south-
east court of the Museum.

Owing to the limited space in the southeast court a large part of the
material has been stored in the old Armory building.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FOSSIL PLANTS IN THE U.S,
NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

By Lester F. Warp, Honorary Curator.

My own time has been almost exclusively given to my official duties
under the Geological Survey, principally in preparing the final mono-
graph of the Flora of the Laramie Group, upon which I have been for
some time engaged. Under my direction Prof. Leo Lesquereux, of Co-
lumbus, Ohio, has made considerable progress in the work of identifying
the material collected by Capt. Charles E. Bendire in Oregon, which, as
mentioned in my last report, was sent him for study. The material
from the John Day River region has all been identified and returned to
the Museum, and Professor Lesquereux’s report has been edited by Prof.
F. H. Knowlton and prepared for publication in the ‘“ Proceedings of
the U.S. National Museum.”* Several new species were detected among
them.

Professor Knowlton has given some time to the continuation of his
studies on the internai structure of fossil plants and has reached some
interesting results. He has examined the large fossil trunks at the
main entrance of the Museum building, and determined them to belong
to the genus Araucarioxylon. The species was thought to be new to
science and has been so described. The examination of the fossil wood
collected in the Yellowstone National Park was first begun near the
close of the year. This examination was hastily made, yet progressed
far enough to enable him to say that the collection contains species be-
longing to the genera Cupressinoxylon, Pityoxylon, Betulinium, ete.

The papers which have been published during the year in reference
to the work and material of this department are noticed in the Bibli-
_ ography, section Iv of the Report.

No very important accessions have been received during the year.

The routine work has largely consisted in caring for such miscellane-
ous material as came in and in labeling and arranging the specimens
returned by Professor Lesquereux.

The exhibition series had also been begun early in February, 1888.
Five cases similar to those used in the department of minerals were

190 _ REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

placed at the disposal of the department, and the work of selecting and
placing the material on exhibition was immediately commenced. The
plan of the exhibition is to illustrate, as fully as the specimens at our
disposal will allow, the evolution of the vegetable kingdom. It begins
with the lowest forms, which are regarded as Algw, such as Arthrophy-
cus, Bythrotrepis, Chondrites, etc. The next class in the systematic
scale is the Fungi, which are very rare in a fossil state, although a few
species are known. The Mosses and Hepatice, which come next, are
also very uncommon in a fossil state. . Of the ferns hundreds of species
are known and a very instructive series has been arranged, principally
from the American Coal Measures. From the ferns the series passes
through Calamarvee, which includes Equisetum, Calamites, and Annu-
laria; the Lycopodiacee, including Lycopodium, Lepidodendron, Sigil-
laria, and Stigmaria to the Gymnosperms.

The Gymnosperms, beginning with the Cycads, pass through the Cal-
amodendrew, Cordaitez, and Dolerophyllee to the true Conifers, of
which there are more than fifty fossil genera known. An ever inereas-
ing diversity of vegetable forms brings us to the Monocotyledons and
eventually to the Dicotyledons, of which division thousands of species
are known to science.

In connection with the actual specimens it is proposed to exhibit res-
torations selected from well-known authorities, such as Cordaites, by
Grand’Eury; Lepidodendron, by Dawson, Lesquereux, and others.

In another series it is proposed to show the characteristic vegetation
of each geological period, beginning with the lowest, and in immediate
connection with these will be shown photographs from Unger, Heer,
and others, showing at a glance the characteristic vegetation of each
period.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF RECENT PLANTS IN THE U. 8S
NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

By Lester F. Warp, Honorary Curator.

In the latter part of July I left Washington, accompanied by Professor
Knowlton, for a two months’ expedition to the Yellowstone National
Park, Wyoming. The primary object of the expedition was to make a
collection of fossil plants from this locality, but as opportunity offered
collections of living plants were also made. The collection includes
about three: hundred species of flowering plants and about twenty-
five species of mosses. A few were obtained in the vicinity of Bozeman,
Montana, and on the road tothe Park. The collections in the Park are
mostly from the northeastern portion and about the principal geyser
areas, and include several species new to the flora of the region. We
returned to Washington about October 1.

Considerable time has been spent during the year in the determina-
tion of the specimens collected in the National Park, and also in se-
lecting and verifying the identification of some of the material collected
during the past two years in the District of Columbia. About one
thousand species of these cultivated plants have been mounted and
placed in the herbarium.

Among the many valuable accessions received during the year may
be mentioned the following: Collection of seven hundred and sixty-
eight species made in Mexico by Dr. Edward Palmer. This material
is from a locality rarely visited by botanists, and contained many spe-
cies that have been determined by Watson, Gray, Vasey, and others
to be new to science. Equally valuable, althongh not as large, is the
collection made by Mr. C. G. Pringle in another part of Mexico. It
embraces two hundred and sixty-three species, a number of which are
new.

Baron Ferd. v. Miiller, of Melbourne, Australia, donated an inter-
esting collection of nearly five hundred species of Australian plants.
These were especially desirable, as there were before almost no speci-
mens from Australia in the herbarium.

From the late Dr. Emil Bessels came a small but vaiuable collection
of Arctic plants, obtained by him mostly from the island of Spitz-

bergen.
191
192 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Mr. H. W. Henshaw donated a valuable set of the ferns, asters, and
golden-rods of the District of Columbia.

Mr. Gerald McCarthy presented a series of between three and four
thousand specimens of duplicate North Carolina plants.

A very valuable collection of the woods of North America for micro-
scopical study was presented by Prof. S. P. Sharpless, of Boston, Mas-
sachusetts. There are about twelve hundred specimens representing
over four hundred species, collected by special agents for the Tenth
Census of the United States. The specimens presented were small
pieces cut from the specimens used by Prof. C. 8S. Sargent in the prep-
aration of his elaborate report on the Forests of North America for the
Census Board.

Other donations of greater or less magnitude have been received
from Messrs. Sturtevant, Echfeldt, Wood, Dugés, Hunter, Schuette,
Reardon, Toner, ete.

A large part of the routine work has been devoted to caring for the
collections. Mr. McCarthy has thoroughly poisoned all the material
now on hand, including the duplicates and the specimens collected
about the District. The six thousand specimens of duplicates that
have accumulated during the past year have been incorporated with
the main series of duplicates and the whole rearranged. ‘The genera,
or where large the species also, have been placed in covers and the
whole labeled with strips of paper which project beyond the packages
as they are placed in the cases. The whole duplicate series is arranged
alphabetically for convenience of exchanging.

The leaf collection, which was commenced as early as 1888 for pur-
poses of comparison with fossil plants, has been thoroughly rearranged
and mounted on ordinary herbarium paper. They have also been ar-
ranged alphabetically. There are somewhat over one thousand species
in this series. :

During the month of February the long-contemplated exhibition
series was begun. Five wall-cases were placed at the disposal of the
Department, and two of them were immediately filled with miscella-
neous botanical objects, such as fruits, seeds, plant products, ete.
Most of the material at first placed on exhibition was selected from a
lot sent to the National Museum from Kew some years ago. Subse-
quently considerable other material, such as species of Polyporus,
woods of Canada, seeds and fruits of Australia, etc., was placed on
exhibition.

The flowering plants collected in the Yellowstone National Park were
worked up by Professor Knowlton, as was also the collection-made by
Messrs. Lucas and Palmer on the Labrador coast.

The mosses collected in the Yellowstone National Park were identified
by Prof. Chas. R. Barnes, of the University of Wisconsin. Professor
Barnes also identified the mosses collected by Lucas and Palmer. There
were seyen species, one of which, a beautiful Bryum, was new to science.

Dr. John W. Echfeldt, of Philadelphia, has identified several small
lots of Lichens from various localities.

Dr. T. F. Allen, of New York City, has identified specimens of the
Characeé on several occasions.

Dr. George Vasey, botanist of the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
has identified several smal! sets of grasses from various places.

Prof. L. H. Bailey, jr., now of Cornell University and the well-known
authority on the genus Carex, kindly looked over the extensive mounted
material in the herbarium, and corrected several errors of determination
or synonomy, and Mr. Th. Holm, soon after his arrival in April, did the
same for the duplicate Carices.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS IN THE U.S. NATIONAL
MUSEUM, 1888.

By F. W. CLarKE, Honorary Curator.

During the year the routine work of the Department has been mainly
carried on by Mr. W.S. Yeates, under my direction, and the collection
of minerals has grown quite rapidly. The following important acces-
sions are noteworthy :

The collection of meteorites has been considerably enlarged by gift
and by exchange. Twenty-three falls were added to the list, and four
casts of well-known and characteristic meteors. On the first of July
our meteorite collection numbered one hundred and twenty-four distinet
falls ; and the Shepard collection, which itself has been notably increased,
will bring the total number represented in the Museum up to fully two
hundred and fifty. Exchanges were made with the British Museum,
tbe Educational Museum of Tokio, the National Museum of Brazil,
Amherst College, Mr. J. R. Gregory of London, his excellency J. de
Siemachko of St. Petersburg, Ward & Howell of Rochester, and Mr.
G. F. Kunz of New York. The Government of the Netherlands East
Indies, presented a fine piece of the Djati Pengilon, Java, meteorite; Mr.
Richard Pearce gave a specimen of the Albuquerque iron; fragments of
the Fayette County, Texas, and Rockwood, Tennessee, falls were given
by Ward & Howell, and Mr. Kunz contributed examples of the Taney
County, Missouri, stone, and the iron from Chattooga County, Georgia.

The gem collection has grown but little since the last annual report.
At the Cincinnati Exposition a small selection from it is now exhibited,
and some valuable additions have been made to the collection for that
display, mostly by purchase. They include a small series of polished
specimens of the Arizona agatized wood, a fine medallion carved in
labradorite, a group of fruit carved in different precious stones from
Siberia, eighteen beryls from North Carolina, thirteen opals from Mex-
ico, five moonstones from Virginia, an oval dish of crocidolite quartz, a
South African diamond in the gangue, a large blue-white topaz from
Japan, and perhaps twenty minor stones. Five cut beryls of different
colors, all from Litchfield County, Connecticut, were presented by the
New England Mining Company, through Mr. J. F. Barse.

The general collection of minerals has received some very important
additions. First in magnitude is the collection bequeathed to the Mu-

seum by the late Isaac Lea. In this collection, which is not yet cata-
logued, is a unique series of micas, which, by the terms of the will,
must remain intact by themselves. Among the miscellaneous minerals
are valuable suites of brucite, ripidolite, clinochlore, fluorite, corundum,
calcite, witherite, bromlite, barytocalcite, the Pennsylvania feldspars,
and the Phoenixville lead ores.

Through the U.S. Geological Survey the Museum has received the
minerals collected at the Denver office of that organization. They in-
clude the type specimens of Cross and Hakin’s ptilolite, the types of
Cross and Hillebrand’s researches upon the Table Mountain zeolites and
the Pike’s Peak fluorides, and the rare copper arsenates from Utah
described by Hillebrand. The survey has also contributed some fine
minerals collected in St. Lawrence County, New York, by Prof. 8S. L.
Penfield, a series of wood opal collected in Montana by Dr. A. C. Peale,
and a number of miscellaneous specimens from various sources. Among
the latter may be named a suite of the nickel silicates from Douglas
County, Oregon, sent to the Survey by Mr. W. Q. Brown, and some van-
adinites from Arizona, presented by Dr. O. Lincoln.

During the summer and early autumn of 1887 two collecting trips were
made by Mr. Yeates. In his first trip he visited the iron mines of Lake
Champlain, the localities of Orange County, New York, the serpentine
deposit at Montville, and the zinc mines of Franklin, Stirling, and
Ogdensburgh, New Jersey. Excellent suites of minerals were obtained
at all of these points, partly by direct collection, partly by gift from local
mineralogists. The second trip was to North Carolina, and yielded a
good series of quartz and corundums from Iredell and Alexander Coun-
ties, some fine garnets, beryls, and kyanites, and a large quantity of
bronzite, genthite, chromite, and samarskite.

By purchase and exchange the additions to the collection have been
more in quality than in quantity. Someexcellent English minerals were
purchased of Messrs. F. H. Butler and S. Henson, in London, having
been selected by myself during my visit to Great Britain. Satisfactory
exchanges were made with the California State Mining Bureau, and Mr.
C. W. Kessler, of Statesville, North Carolina.

Gifts have been received from many sources. Our especial acknowl-
edgments are due to Messrs. R. E. C. Stearns, W. J. Mullins, G. F.
Kunz. C. W. Cunningham, W. B. Smith, H. G. Hanks, J. D. English,
W. P. Rowe, T. K. Bruner, Grinnell Burt, Henry Mapes, V/m. Cooper,
Col. P. J. Sinclair, Thomas Lewis, D. A. Bowman, C. EH. Beecher, E. M.
Reynolds, S. C. Young, C. S. Bement, J. A. D. Stephenson, P. O. Dwyer,
Otto F. Pfordte, and the Green River Zircon Mining Company.

The routine work of the department needs no special notice here,
having followed the lines established in previous years with no changes
of importance. The only researches prosecuted upon Museum material
are referred to in the Bibliography,* the work in each case having been

done upon specimens belonging to the Geological Survey previous to
its transfer to our collections.

On account of the large accessions received from the executors of Dr.
isaac Lea and from the Denver office of the Geological Survey, the
number of specimens now in the collection can not be at present prop-
erly estimated. Of material actually catalogued the following figures
are precise :

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF LITHOLOGY AND PHYSICAL GEOLOGY
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

By GEORGE P. MERRILL, Curator.

The wor= of the year, as heretofore, has been almost wholly in the
line of the preparation of the exhibition, study, and duplicate series.
During July and the early part of August my time was occupied in
completing and putting into shape for the printer a hand-book of the
building-stone collection This work comprised not only a catalogue
of the collection giving the name, color, geological age, locality, size,
shape, and name of donor of each individual specimen, but also gave
as full an account as the size of the volume would permit of the lead-
-ing quarries in the United States, the character and quality of their
output and their capabilities; it included also chapters on the structure
and composition of rocks, their weathering qualities, methods of quar-
rying and dressing, results of pressure tests, and on the selection of
stone for any form of building and ornamental work ; the idea being
to put in convenient form such facts relative to these stones as should
enable any one of ordinary intelligence and education to gain an idea
of the various kinds of rocks, their uses and adaptability for structural
purposes. The work was finally completed and the manuscript sent the
Government Printer early in September. In the final preparation of
this work I was assisted by Mr. Hudson, draughtsman. From August 10
to September 10, I was absent on my annual vacation. September 26
was begun the work of re-arranging the exhibition hall. This occupied
our entire attention until the latter part of November, and can not
even now be claimed to be completed. The arrangement decided upon
_ involved the moving of nearly every case in the hall as well as nearly
every specimen, regardless of size, weight, or shape.

Early in April the material in the temporary storage sheds was
thoroughly overhauled, all superfluous specimens rejected, and the re-
mainder taken into the Museum or removed to another temporary stor-
age shed at the Armory building. The location of this shed at such a
distance is a matter of great inconvenience. Indeed the prevailing
condition of affairs affords a very striking illustration of the inad-
equacy of the present accommodations for a geological museum.

: 199
200 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Owing to the numerous calls from educational institutions for dupli-
cate materials work was begun early in the spring with a view to pre-
paring fifty sets, of some fifty specimens each, showing the more com-
mon forms of rock types. These sets are as yet far from complete ; in
every case some of the most important rock groups being wholly un-
represented. ‘This is due to the fact that the materials necessary for
these are to be found only in the West, whence the Museum has at
present no means of obtaining them. The curator has on sundry occa-
sions endeavored to bring about some arrangement whereby field par-
ties in the employ of the U.S. Geological Survey should procure for
us the desired materials. Up to date such attempts have been only
partially successful.

The more important accessions of the year are included in the follow-
ing list:

(1) An interesting series of Devonian marbles and miscellaneous eruptive rocks,
received in exchange for other material from Mr. R. N. Worth, curator of petrology
in the Plymouth Institute, Plymouth, England.

(2) A fine block of contorted schist from Brandon, Vermont, collected for this de-
partment by Mr. F. H. Knowlton, of the Department of Fossil Plants.

(3) A large series of eruptive rocks, minerals, vein and joint formations, etc., from
New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maine, collected by the curator during
his summer vacation. Especially valuable in this series are the Metasomatic serpen-
tines from Montville, New Jersey; the Kersantite from Franklin Furnace in the same
State; the contorted gneiss and vein formations from Maine. I call particular at-
tention to this collection, since a large proportion of it is of such a nature as to be
unobtainable but by sending a collector into the field for the express purpose.
Later this material was supplemented by a small collection of serpentine, miscellane-
ous eruptive rocks and fragments of a new meteorite obtained by the curator while
in San Francisco in March. A portion of the material mentioned above furnished
data for special papers.”

(4) An interesting series of Pyrite concretions from New Foundland, and some
twenty specimens phonolite from the Black Hills, Dakota, received in exchange from
Prof. W. O. Crosby.

(5) Two slabs of polished Algerian and English marbles. Gift of E. Fritsch 515
and 517 west Twentieth street, New York.

(6) Some 500 pounds Glaucophane rock from near mouth of Sulphur Grose
Sonoma County, California, collected for the Museum by W. L. Jones.

(7) A selected series of geological material comprising metamorphosed chalk, cone
in cone, contorted gneiss and contorted fossil, voleanic bomb from the Auvergne, and
three specimens showing vein structures received from A. A. Duly in exchange for
other material. é

(5) Some 300 pounds Peridotite from near Webster, North Carolina, collected for
the Museum by Mr. W. H. H. Schreiber.

(9) Several fragments of Fulgurite tubes from Cedarville, New Nork; gift of H. S.
Garrison (through R. Burns, of the U. S. Geological Survey).

(10) Some 600 pounds volcanic rocks from the vicinity of Bozeman, Montana;
collected for the Museum by James Forristell.

(11) A relief map of Oahu, received from Prof. C. H. Hitchcock, of Hanover, New
Hampshire, in exchange.

*See Bibliography, section Iv of the report.
DEPARTMENT OF LITHOLOGY AND PHYSICAL GEOLOGY. 201

(12) Two fine samples of Fulgurite on eruptive rock; gift of Mr. J. S. Diller, U.
S. Geological Survey.

(13) A large collection of eruptives, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks from
Colorado; received from S. F. Emmons, U.S. Geological Survey. This includes a
type collection of the rocks and ores of Leadville, as described by Messrs. Emmons
and Cross in Monograph xu, U. S. Geological Survey. This is by far the most valu-
able accession of its kind of the year.

(14) A fine series of fossil coral tor cutting and polishing; received by way of
exchange from C. C. Nutting, Lowa College, Iowa.

(15) A series comprising one hundred photographs. Scenery of United States,
New Zealand, and Australia. This is old material received from the Centennial Ex
position in 1876, but not before assorted and catalogued.

(16) A fine large block (22 by 21 by 15 inches) of Ophite marble from Thurman,
Warren county, New York. Giftof R. L. Baxter. This specimen is of interest not
merely on account of its unique appearance, but also on account of the light which.
it throws on the origin of this class of rocks.

(17) A complete series of specimens collected at intervals of every 50 feet from the
tunnel of thé new aqueduct extension in this city. For this collection we are in-
debted to Mr. Thomas Robinson, formerly of Howard University. That the collec-
tion was in process of preparation has been noted in my previous report.

ROUTINE WORK.

The general character of the routine work of the year may be best
inferred by a perusal of the following outline showing the scope of the
department. *

Considering geology not merely as a science treating of the compo-
- sition and structure of the earth, but as one which comprises its origin
and history also, one whose aim it is to ‘trace the progress of our
planet from the beginning of its separate existence through its various
stages of growth down to the present condition of things,” we begin
with a consideration of—

I. The earth in its cosmical aspect.—In this first primary division the
earth is represented as a planet and compared with other members of
the solar system. This can of course be done only by means of models
and illustrations of various kinds.

Il. The structure of the earth—Geology.—This second primary division
which comprises the science of geology as ordinarily understood, is
subdivided into five sections, each of which is capable of further sub-
division. Considered in the order adopted, these are :—

A. Geognosy; a consideration of the materials of the earth’s substance.—
Under this section are to be shown (1) the sixteen more common ele-
ments which in their various combinations are estimated to form about
99 per cent. of the substance of the earth’s crust; (2) the minerals
which, resulting from these combinations, go to make up rock masses ;
and (3) the rocks themselves. All the substances required for these
exhibits are of such nature as to admit of their being readily utilized.
Not even the fact that an element is a gas both colorless and tasteless-

Philosophical Society of Washington.
202 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

need be considered an obstacle, since a glass jar of hydrogen, though
apparently empty, is, if properly labeled, as instructive as though the
substance itself were tangible. Samples of the various forms of labels
employed, in this as well as the other collections, will be given later.
In the collection of rock-forming minerals the specimens are selected
not for their beauty or fine crystallographic development, but ordinary
forms, both crystalline and massive, are shown in all their principal
varieties. The collection is divided into (1) primary minerals, or those
which formed at the time of the consolidation of the rock, and (2) sec-
ondary minerals, or those which have formed since its consolidation,
and are due mainly to decomposition, hydration, or solution and recrys-
tallization. The individual labels further state whether the mineral is
an essential or accessory constituent and of what class of rocks it forms
a part. In the rock collection the samples are as a rule trimmed with
a hammer into sizes approximately 34 by 43 by 1 inch, this size having
been found most convenient when everything is taken into considera-
tion. The rule is not, however, inviolable, and both size and shape are
allowed to vary when the character of the rock renders this advisable.
Care is taken in all cases to procure fresh and characteristic material
and that no specimen shall show abrasive marks from the hammer or
other agencies on its exposed surface. ‘This collection it has been found
advisable to precede by a struciural series, é. ¢., a small series showing
all the common forms of rock structure. It is the object of the collec-
tion to explain the meaning of sundry terms in common use among
geologists, but whose exact meaning is not always understood by the
public at large. Such a collection really forms an illustrated glossary,
since the meaning of each term, as porphyritic, cellular, etc., is shown
by means of a specimen in which this structure is the most pronounced
characteristic. This collection is supplemented by a series of twelve
enlarged photo-micrographs, showing the structure of rocks as revealed
by the microscope and seen in polarized light. The general rock col-
lection I should say is classified by kinds, regardless of locality or
economic value. The rocks of strictly economic value, exclusive of ores,
are now grouped by themselves in the extensive collections of (a) build-
ing and ornamental stone and (b) stones used for abrading purposes.
The first-named of these, as I have stated in previous reports, it has
been found advisable to have cut in the form of 4-inch cubes, polished
on the front face when the nature of the stone permitted. The remain-
ing faces being finished as follows: Drafted and pointed on the left
side; drafted rock face on the right side, rock face behind, and smooth
sanded or chiseled on the top and bottom. In special cases, as with
coarse figured or remarkably unique marbles, it has been found advis-
able to deviate from this rule and finish the stone in the form of a thin
‘slab from 4 to 12 or even 24 inches in greatest dimensions. Finished
objects of stone, excepting so far as they demonstrate the adaptability
of a rock to some particular purpose, are as a rule excluded as belong-

ing more properly to the Department of Arts and Industries. The

stones used for abrading purposes, 7. ¢., hones, whetstones, grind-

stones, etc., are shown in the forms in which they are used in the vari-

ous industries. The grindstones proving too bulky for our limited
space are proportionately reduced in size.

B. Dynamical and Physiographical Geology.—Under this section are
discussed the agencies and methods of geological change. It is of
course impossible to represent these agencies in actual operation, and
we must confine ourselves to a display of results which the labels must
explain. In this section are placed those objects illustrative of (1)
Plutonic or hypogene action, under which are included (a) heat as dis-
played in metamorphism, production of veins, volcanoes, volcanic action
and non-voleanic igneous ejections; (b) the movement of the earth’s
crust as displayed by folds and faults; (c) cohesive attraction as dis-
played by crystallization, cleavage and concretionary structure, and
(d) the chemical processes of rock formation and metamorphism, this last
division comprising chemical Geology. We then pass to (2) Surface or
epigene action, where are displayed materials illustrative of the destruct-
ive, constructive and reproductive effects of the atmosphere, of surface
water, and of life in its various forms. The effects of atmosphere and
water are illustrated by specimens showing the destructive chemical
process of oxidation, deoxidation, hydration and solution, or the general ©
phenomena of rock weathering as displayed in the breaking down of
rocks and the formation of soils, and in the erosive power of water,
shown in part by models; while the constructive and reproductive
effects are shown by the formation of sand dunes, deltas, stalagmitic
deposits and sinters. The effects of life in all its various forms is shown
by the wood and stone burrowiug of insects and animals, by the pro-
tective action of algze, moss, lichens, by deposits of diatomaceous earth,
the formation of coral islands* and of coal, guano beds, ete.

C. Structural Geology: The architecture of the Earth’s Crust.—Under
this third head are displayed (1) Stratified rocks showing stratification
and its accompaniments, as false or current bedding, ripple marks, mud
cracks and foot prints; (2) Igneous rocks, both contemporaneous and
intrusive; (3) Metamorphic rocks; (4) Mineral veins; (5) Surface de-
posits and (6) Joints, cleavage, curvature and dislocations, and other
modifications of the primary arrangement of the earth’s crust. Many
objects are here displayed of precisely the same nature as under dynam-
- ical geology, in the one Gase illustrating the methods by which cer-
tain structures are brought about, and in the other the structures them-
selves.

D. Stratigraphical or Historical Geology.—Under this, the fourth
subdivision, is considered the chronological succession of the geologi-
cal formations, the rocks being arranged according to the order of their
deposition or ejection. From this series fossil forms are to alarge extent

excluded, as belonging more properly to the department of paleontology.
As at present contemplated, the main idea in view is to show that the
same geological forces have been in operation, and that rocks of the same
general nature have been in process of formation from the earliest
times down to the most recent. This collection, although now compris-
ing some four hundred specimens, is far from complete, and can not be
satisfactorily arranged for lack of proper cases.

The following show the character of labels used in the various col-
lections. All are exact copies of labels now in use.

ROCKING BOWLDER.

EAST LYME, NEW LONDON CO., CONNECTICUT. 36,772.
Gift of Mr. JAMES SHEPARD, 1885.

The granite bowlder of which the above is a photograph is situ-
ated in the southwest part of East Lyme, New London Co., Connecticut.
It is said to weigh from 30 to 40 tons. Though resting upon a com-
paratively small face, the strength of an ordinary man is insufficient
to set it in motion.

On receipt of new material, then, the first matter to be decided upon is
to which one of the various collections it is best adapted, after which it
is cut and trimmed to such size and shape as is best suited for conven-
ience in handling, and best brings out the characteristics which it is
intended to illustrate. In all cases an entry is made in the Museum
catalogue giving all available details regarding the material, and the
corresponding number painted in oil colors upon the specimen itself.
Specimens designed for exhibition have temporary written labels pre-
pared, duplicates of which are sent to the Government Printer when a
sufficient number have accumulated. The copy for some two hundred
and fifty labels has thus been sent during the past year.

Thirteen sets of duplicates, mostly in the way of exchange, have been
sent out during the period covered by this report. They are as fol-
lows:

July 14, 1887, to Mr. R. N. Worth, Plymouth, England, set twenty-eight specimens
miscellaneous American rocks.

August 9, 1887, to Dr. William Hallock, U. 8. ee onc sical Survey, for experimental
work, two samples of building stones.

September 17, 1887, to Mr. P. C. Manning, Portland, Maine, set of Bermuda rocks,
comprising nine specimens.

December 2, 1887, to Mr. R. N. Worth, Plymouth, England, set of miscellaneous
rocks and marbles, comprising fourteen specimens.

December 12, 1887, to Mr. 7. F. Lamb, Portland, Maine, one polished slab pegma-
tite from Auburn, Maine.

January 12, 1888, to Dr. George H. Williams, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,
Maryland, set of miscellaneous American rocks, fourteen specimens.

January 13, 1888, to Prof. W. O. Crosby, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
_ Boston, Massachusetts, set of miscellaneous American rocks, eleven specimens.
206 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888

minerals, and building stones, one hundred and twenty-five specimens.

April 18, 1888, to Mr. R. N. Worth, Plymouth, England, set of miscellaneous rocks,
twenty-four specimens.

April 26, 1888, to Mr. Whitman Cross, U. S. Geological Survey (loaned for study),
collection of rocks from the Elk Mountains and vicinity, Colorado.

June 8, 1888, to Mr. J. S. Diller, U. 8S. Geological Survey (loaned to complete series
of American rocks designed for exhibition at Cincinnati), twelve specimens.

June 18, 1888,-to Mr. W. H. Hobbs, Worcester, Massachusetts, set of miscellaneous
American rocks, twenty-two specimens.

Special reports on material received for examination and report from
parties as a rule not in any way connected with the Museum have been
prepared, as follows:

(1) On accession 19326, received from Mr. R. W. Page, Salem, Roanoke County,
Virginia.

(2) On accession 19387, received from Dr. C. F. Lick, Shady Grove, Tennessee.

(3) On accession 19434, received from Dr. J. W. Folson, Atoka, Indian Territory.

(4) On accession 19483, received from C. Werdermann, Calera, Alabama.

(5) On accession 19500, received from F. M. Mercia, Garrett, Indiana.

(6) On accession 19544, received from Mr. Harry L. DeZeng, Geneva, New York.

(7) On accession 19564, received from Mr. I. 8S. Jeffers, Huffman, Indiana.

(8) On accession 19603, received from Hon. C. N. Richards, U. 8. Senate.

(9) On accession 19705, a so-called ‘‘ mad-stone,” received from Mr. Donald McRae,
Wilmington, North Carolina. The stone was merely an indurated clay, and
owed its adhesive and consequent imaginary curative property to its power
of absorbing moisture with great rapidity.

(10) On accession 19760, received from W. F. Cooper, Bristol, Tennessee.

(11) On accession 19677, received from C. D. Hay, Hot Springs, Arkansas. This
was a ferruginous sandstone, the natural weathering of which had given rise
to peculiar markings on its surface, and which were supposed to be of human

origin.

(12) On accession 19788, received from R. H. Howell, Nashville, Tennessee.

(13) On accession 19829, received from J. E. Baker, Stoutsville, Ohio.

(14) On accession 19975, received from E. H. Spooner, Virginia City, Nevada.

Particular attention has been paid during the year to the strati-
graphic, structural, and dynamical geology exhibition series, and many
important additions have been made; among them I may mention the
proportional column of the stratified! rock formations of New Hamp-
shire; the fine examples of veins, contortions, crushing and faulting,
as well as the series showing contact metamorphism, and the very beau-
tiful and instructive series of rocks from Montville, New Jersey, show-
ing the derivation of serpentine from pyroxene by the process of meta-
somatosis. Those portions of the collection showing the constructive
and destructive effects of plant and animal life have also made some
progress. The latter collection is supplemented by a collection illus-
trative of the formation of a coral island, Bermuda being taken as an
example. This begins with the more common tpyes of corals and shells
from the neighboring waters, followed by the loose fragmental material
derived from them, and which, when mixed with more or less carbon-
aceous and ferruginous matter, forms the characteristic soil ofthe island.
These in turn are followed by the common limestone, made up from
these compacted fragments, and these again by the stalagmitic and
Stalactitic coarsely crystalline secondary rocks formed by the solution
and recrystallization of the tragmental materials. The series closes
with a small collection of rocks foreign to the island, and which have
been drifted thence, presumably entangled in the roots of trees, and
cast upon the beaches.

In the prosecution of the work as above outlined I have received as-
sistance as follows:

From July 1 to July 8, Mr. E. Kirby Smith ; from July 15 to 18, Miss
Carrie Rosenbusch; from July 13 to September 7, Mr. Hudson (draughts-
man); from September 26 to January 15, 1888, Mr. F. L. Fuller; from
January 19 to February 8, Mr. L. H. Merrill; from March 12 to the
close of the fiscal year, Mr. William B, Merriman. Mr. Forney, stone-
cutter, has continued with the department for the greater part of the
year. The short term of service of all but one of the above rendered
their assistance of much less value than it might otherwise have been.
Indeed, in the majority of cases, the proper order was reversed, and the
curator served as assistant while endeavoring to instruct the intended
assistant in the duties of his office. This condition of affairs, while un-
doubtedly unavoidable for the present, must necessarily react more or
less disastrously upon the department.

Aside from the study necessarily given to materials incident to their
proper identification and installation, special attention has been given
to the peridotite from Little Deer Isle on the coast of Maine; a new

Museum Proceedings, but at date of writing have not been issued.
Preliminary notices of them have, however, appeared in other publica-

The present condition of the collection is shown by the following table.
It must be understood, however, that the figures given for the dupli-
cate series are merely approximations, since the material is, as a rule,
brought in in bulk, and broken up into sizes to suit special conditions,

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF METALLURGY AND ECONOMIC
GEOLOGY IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888,

By F. P. DEwWry, Curator.

Early in the year it was decided to make some changes in the exhi-
bition space of the department. Instead of dividing the exhibits be-
tween a range, a part of a hall, and a part of the southwest court, the
whole of the southwest court was assigned to the department.

The entire energy of the department for the whole year has been de-
voted to work incident to this change.

The opportunity was taken to completely reorganize the geographi-
cal series of ores, and to make some changes in the systematic collec-
tions in economic geology and metallurgy. ‘The latter collections are
now in shape again for exhibition, and as soon as a portion of the
geographical series is arranged, about one-half of the exhibition space
can be thrown open to the public. It is hoped to do this by the first
ot January, 1889.

Among the especially noteworthy collections received during the
year should be mentioned:

A series of wood alcohol products, obtained in the manufacture of
charcoal on a large scale, as a blast-furnace fuel; from the Works of
the Standard Charcoal Company, at Goodrich, Tennessee. Collected
by E. F. Coffin.

A very interesting series of aluminum bronzes and other rare alloys,
made by Biermann, of Hanover. Presented by the “Iron Age” of New
York City.

A large series of the nickel ores of Webster: North Carolina, together
with the chromium ore. Presented by W. A. H. Schriber, Webster,
North Carolina.

A small but very instructive series illustrating the process of utiliz-
ing the low grade sulphide ores of Leadville, Colorado, as practised by
the concentrating mill of the Colonel Sellers mine. Presented by Tay-
lor & Brunton, Leadville, Colorado.

A series of the gold, nickel, and chromium ores of California. Pre-
sented by L. W. Green, Baird, Shasta County, California.

210 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

There have been two important collections turned over to the de-
partment by the U. 8S. Geological Survey. One, embracing five hun-
dred and thirty-nine specimens, was collected by Mr. J. S. Curtis in
preparing his report on the silver-lead district of Eureka, Nevada.
The second is a very extensive collection, embracing seven hundred
and thirty-three specimens, collected by Mr. S. F. Emmons in preparing
his report upon the geology of Leadville, Colorado.

Two researches were carried on during the year. The first was the
perfecting of the Hampe method of determining sub-oxide of copper in
metallic copper, in order to carry on a further investigation upon the
refining of pig-copper; and the other was a complete chemical examina-
tion of the very large collection of the Lone Elm Smelting Works at
Joplin, Missouri. The latter investigation necessitated the making of
sixteen complete chemical analyses, including the working out of sev-
eral special methods of analysis to apply to some of the products. At
these works the non-argentiferous galena of southwest Missouri is
smelted to pig-lead, and the fumes given off during the smelting, which
are ordinarily lost, are transformed into white paint. These fumes are
exceedingly interesting and complex in their composition, and their
analysis has afforded much new and valuable information.

The total number of specimens in the department is now about 51,000;
of these, 18,000 are in the exhibition series, 12,000 are duplicates, and
9,500 are in the reserve series. The remainder consists of specimens,
as yet unclassified, which for the present are considered as reserve
material.

One hundred and one accessions have been received during the year,
of which 72, containing 128 specimens, were transmitted for examina-
tion and report. Twelve special reports were made in answer to tech-
nical questions submitted by correspondents.

In cataloguing the collection 1,413 entries have been made, covering
2,412 specimens; and 1,444 catalogue cards have been written.

As a preliminary to the re-arrangement of the geographical collection
of ores, the entries of material assigned to this department which were
scattered through several record volumes, in which both rock and min-
eral specimens were also entered, have been transferred to the record
books assigned to this department; 7,046 entries have thus been trans-
ferred.

Twenty-nine boxes of duplicate and reserve material have been placed
in general storage, and six specimens were sent out in exchange.

The clerical work of the department has been well performed by Mr.
W. H. Newhall, assisted during a portion of the year by Mr.T. R. Turn-
bull.

* The catalogue records are kept in four series of books.
DEPARTMENT OF METALLURGY AND ECONOMIC GEOLOGY. 211

During the year the curator has published a paper entitled ‘“ Photo-
graphing the Interior of a Coal Mine,” in the Transactions of the Ameri-
can Institute of Mining Engineers, vol. 16, page 307. In this is given
an account of taking some photographs of the interior of the Kohinoor
Colliery by electric light during the summer of 1884. The paper is illus-
trated by plates of four of the views obtained, copied by the Levytype
process, direct from the negative, without any retouching.

Mr. J. F. Kemp has published two articles descriptive of the south-
east Missouri lead regions, based upon the notes and collections made
by him when collecting material for this department for the New Or-
leans Exposition in 1884,

The first paper is entitled ‘‘ Notes on the Ore Deposits and Ore Dress-
ing in Southeast Missouri,” published in the School of Mines Quarterly,
vol. 9, page 74, and embodies his observations upon the ore deposits,
the methods of mining, and the mechanical dressing of the ore. The
last subject is treated very fully.

The second paper is entitled ‘* Notes on Lead Smelting in Southeast
Missouri,” published in the School of Mines Quarterly, vol. 9, page 212,
and gives a description of the various smelting processes followed,
together with many valuable analyses.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF LIVING ANIMALS IN THE U. S.
NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

By W. T. HoRNADAY, Curator.

From the date of the plan of organization of the National Museum it
has been the intention of its founders that it should eventually include
a Department of Vivaria, to afford materials for the prosecution of
scientific studies, as well as for general educational purposes. The
organization of the present Department of Living Animals was hastened,
and finally precipitated, by the imperative needs of the taxidermic force
for living models to be studied daily in connection with work on the
series of family groups of American mammals begun last year for the
display of mounted mammals. The experiment of keeping live animals
for this purpose in the taxidermic laboratory had proven expensive and
in many ways unsatisfactory. Inasmuch as it had been determined to
spare no effort in this work, and to produce a series of groups which
should be as nearly perfect as possible, it was deemed necessary to
form a small coliection of living animals for purposes of study, and, if
practicable, to also arrange for its exhibition to the public.

In pursuance with this determination the chief taxidermist was
directed to accompany Fish Commission Car No. 1, Mr. J. Frank Ellis,
messenger, on its autumn trip to the Pacific coast, for the purpose of
collecting and bringing back as many specimens of mammals as could
be secured by gift, or purchased at nominal prices. This trip occupied
a month, from October 8th to November 9th, during which Car No. 1
visited St. Paul, Minnesota; Fargo and Mandan, Dakota; Helena,
Montana; Tacoma, Washington Territory; Portland, Oregon; Salt
Lake City, Utah; and Cheyenne, Wyoming. At all of these points liv-
ing specimens were acquired, both by giftand purchase, until the total
number of acquisitions amounted to seventeen. The following were
the objects which formed the nucleus of the present collection of living
animals:

Vulpes fulvus fulvus, Red Fox. Gift of O. V. Davis, Mandan, Dakota.

Ursus americanus cinnamomum, Cinnamon Bear. Purchased at Helena, Montana.

Cariacus virginianus, White-tailed Deer. Purchased at Helena, Montana.

Cynomys ludovicianus, Prairie Dog. Gift of Carl Steinmetz, Helena, Montana.
213
214 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Cariacus columbianus, Columbian Black-tailed Deer. Purchased at Media, Wash-.

ington Territory.

Vulpes fulous decussatus, Cross Fox. Gift of John Melville, Portland, Oregon.

Cariacus macrotis, Mule Deer. Purchased at Mountain Home, Idaho.

Taxidea americana, (2) Badger. Gift of Dr. C. W. Higgins, Salt Lake City, Utah.

Vulpes fulvus fulvus, Red Fox. Gift of Dr. C. W. Higgins, Salt Lake City, Utah.

Aquila chrysaetos, Golden Kagle. Gift of Dr. C. W. Higgins, Salt Lake City, Utah.

Lynx maculatus, Spotted Lynx. Purchased of Dr. C. W. Higgins, Salt Lake City,

Utah.

Cynomys ludovicianus, (4) Prairie Dog. Purchased at Cheyenne, Wyoming Ter-

ritory.

This collection filled up all the available space in the ear on its return
trip, and the transportation of so many large objects was only possible
through the disinterested courtesy and untiring co-operation of Mr.
Ellis and his assistant, Mr. R. S. Johnson.

Upon the arrival of this collection at the Museum it was decided to
assign space for it in one end of a temporary wooden structure that had
just been erected on the south side of the eastern wing of the Smithso-
nian, of materials from the oid demolished New Orleans annex build-
ing. Its dimensions were 25 by 106 feet. This rough building was fitted
up with heating apparatus, a number of temporary cages were made,
the collection duly installed, and opened to the public on December 31,
1887. It immediately became quite popular with the public. Many
valuable gifts were offered and accepted, and a number of desirable
small objects, which were offered to the Institution at nominal prices,
were purchased and added to the collection. Among the earliest gifts
were an unusually large and fine jaguar from Mr. J. W. Riddle, of Eagle
Pass, Texas, and two black bears from Mr. J. J. E. Lindberg, of El Paso,
Texas.

By the end of January the collection had increased to a total of fifty-
eight specimens of mammals and birds, many ot which were rare and
valuable. It was found that the collection demanded the constant
attention of an expexienced keeper, not only for the proper care and
feeding of the animals, but also to protect them from annoyance at the
hands of a certain class of visitors. Accordingly, on February 1, Mr.
N. R. Wood was engaged to do duty in the above capacity.

During the montbs of February and March the collection nearly
doubled in point of numbers, and rendered it absolutely necessary to
occupy the whole of the building in which it was temporarily installed.
A bear pit was. built for the black bears at the western end; a large
cage was built in the center for the cinnamon bear, and beside it a
still larger cage with several compartments was constructed to accom-
modate the large birds of prey—eagles, owls, and vultures. As gifts
were received temporary cages were hastily constructed for their ac-
commodation, and every effort was made to make the best showing
possible under the circumstances.

With the rapid increase in the size and value of the collection came
an increase in the amount of labor and attention it absolutely required.
DEPARTMENT OF LIVING ANIMALS. 215

But for the valuable and indefatigable service which has been volun-
tarily entered upon, chiefly as a personal favor, by Mr. W. C. Weeden,
in addition to his duties as assistant engineer, the Department of Living
Animals would have suffered very serious embarrassment, and the cura-
tor gladly acknowledges the value and gratifying nature of the services
thus rendered from February to the close of the fiscal year.

In the month of April a fine pair of buffaloes, a bull four years of
age and a three-year-old cow, then on a cattle ranch in Nebraska, were
purchased by Mr. E. G. Blackford, of New York, and presented to the
National Museum as the nucleus of a small herd. This very valuable
gift was gladly accepted, and Mr. Joseph Palmer was dispatched to
North Platte, Nebraska, to take charge of the animals and bring them
safely to Washington. This difficult task was accomplished with grati-
fying success and economy, and the two highly prized specimens
reached the Institution in fine condition on May 10. In anticipation
of their wants, and to provide good accommodations for the four deer
then in the collection, a small barn with several yards around it had
been constructed on the south end of the ellipse lying in the angle be-
tween the Smithsonian and the National Museum buildings. While
this structure is by no means conspicuous or unpleasing in design, the
building and yards attached afford reasonably good temporary accom-
modations, not only for the buffaloes and deer already occupying them,
-but they can also receive a very small number of each in addition with-
out being crowded. The barn affords dry quarters for the animals dur-
ing rainy weather, cool shade during hot weather, a suitable outfit for
feeding, and also storage room for feed.

On May 12 the chief taxidermist was appointed curator of the De-
partment of Living Animals.

REVIEW OF ACCESSIONS.

The accession statistics of the Department afford an interesting
index of the interest manifested in it on the part of the general public.
In the beginning it was predicted that one-half the specimens necessary
for the various collections would be offered as gifts. The following is
a statement of the whole number of living animals acquired from Octo-
ber 8, 1887, to June 30, 1888, and the manner of their acquisition :

216 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

It is worthy of note that of all the specimens not bred in the me-
nagerie more than three times as many were received by gift as it was
necessary to purchase. Furthermore, of the one hundred and twenty-
three specimens received by presentation, about three-fourths were
offered voluntarily, and without either suggestion or personal solicita-
tion from the curator. The actual cash value of all the gifts is at least
six times that of all the specimens purchased.

In addition to the gifts mentioned in the list already given, the
most noteworthy mammals are the following: A fine pair of American
bison from Mr. EK. G. Blackford, New York; a very large male jaguar
from Mr. J. W. Riddle, Eagle Pass, Texas; two black bears from Mr.
J.J. KH. Lindberg, HE] Paso, Texas; a male Virginia deer from Captain
hk. L. Hoxie, Montgomery, Alabama, and a female of the same species
from Dr. P. Glennan, Washington, District of Columbia; two black
bear cubs from Mr. J. S. Miller, Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
Washington; a coyote from Mr. F. D. Nowell, North Platte, Nebraska ;
a gray wolf from Mr. C. A. Dole, Glendive, Montana; a grivet monkey
from Mr. L. Moxley, Washington, and an exceedingly interesting Mexi-
can spider monkey (Ateles. vellerosus) from Mr. C. H. Townsend, U.
S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross; a gray fox from Mr. George
EK. Brown, Alexandria, Virginia.

Of the many rare and interesting birds presented, it is impossible to
mention here the names of even the most valuable objects, but a com-
plete list of all the gifts will be found appended to this report.

Among the specimens purchased the most interesting were a puma
from Fort Keogh, and a“ silver-tip” grizzly bear cub from Billings,
Montana; a fine black bear from South Carolina, received from Dr. G.
HK. Manigault in exchange, and the deer and spotted lynxes mentioned
in the list of specimens which were procured on the trip to the Pacific
coast. During the month of June a beginning was made toward the
formation of a collection of living reptiles, but since nothing worthy
of mention was accomplished until after June 30, the record of the
work done properly belongs to the next report.

Among the small and more common species of mammals and pets
there have been several deaths, but the only loss of any importance
during the eight months was that of the two spotted lynxes (Lynx
maculatus), obtained in Salt Lake City. During the early part of the
winter, before the heating apparatus was in satisfactory order, the
female of the pair died of pneumonia, and the male succumbed a few
days later to uremic poisoning. Owing to the flimsy nature of some
of our temporary cages several opossums and two woodchucks escaped,
and, still more to be regretted, six quails and a pair of gambels part-
ridges were killed in one night by rats, with which the menagerie
building is still completely infested, in spite of the great numbers that
have been caught, killed, and fed to the birds of prey. ;
DEPARTMENT OF LIVING ANIMALS. 217

ROUTINE WORK.

The daily care which the animals in the collection demanded in
proper feeding and thorough cleaning has required the undivided atten-
tion of the two keepers mentioned above, with daily assistance from a
laborer. Quite a number of the birds and mammals are young, and all
such require to be fed from three to five times daily, on food specially
adapted to their respective wants. With the exception of the reptiles,
each species in the entire collection has been labeled, and although in
the beginning the curator made a determined effort to exhibit with each
mammalian species a map showing its geographical distribution, the
rapid increase in the size and importance of the collection overwhelmed
him with more imperative duties, and it was found impossible to carry
out that plan at present. During the last four months of the fiscal
year only four specimens were purchased, and it required diligent exer-
tions to provide proper accommodations for the gifts that came in from
day today. Notwithstanding the disadvantages the department labors
under by reason of the temporary nature of nearly all of its appoint-
ments, the crowded condition of the puilding and the small size of must
of the cages, the healthy condition of the animals and the general
cleanliness of the establishment attest the energy and vigilance of the
keepers.

As a measure of economy in the matter of feed, several tons of fine
clover hay have been saved from the haying operations conducted on
the Smithsonian Grounds by the Department of Public Buildings and
Grounds, and stacked near the carp pounds for future use in feeding
our ruminants. The saving thus effected will not fall far short of $150.
During the entire grass-cutting season the buffaloes and deer have been
fed chiefly on fresh grass from the grounds.

TRANSPORTATION.

Inasmuch as the ordinary rules of the express companies require pay-
ment for certain classes of live animals at from two to four times the
amount of ordinary rates, Mr. S. C. Brown, registrar of the National
Museum, undertook to secure certain concessions from various express
companies, north and south. After considerable correspondence the
Adams Express Company refused to make any concession whatever,
thereby reserving its right to charge from one to four rates on live ani-
mals, as it sees fit, which in many cases is a prohibitive tariff. The
United States Express Company (now including also the Baltimore and
Ohio Company) was more generous, and in view of the laudable nature
of the object in view, and the fact that the collections will always be
free to the public, the general manager of that company has authorized
all its agents to ship live animals of all kinds to this Institution at one
ordinary merchandise rate. This generous concession will be of great
218 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

value to us in building up the collection of living animals, and all col-
lectors and correspondents who may desire to forward specimens to us
are requested to ship by the United States Express Company (or the
Baltimore and Ohio) in preference to the Adams or the Southern Ex-
press Company.

Up to date no researches worthy of mention have been made, the at-
tention of the curator having been fully occupied in duties of a practi-
cal nature. The growth of the young bears in the collection, which
now contains examples of three species, has been watched with interest -
with a view to obtaining some exact data throwing light on the rela-
tions borne by the black bear, cinnamon, and grizzly to each other.
The position of the cinnamon bear being involved in considerable doubt,
it is very desirable to study the development of the three species under
favorable conditions.

The most important result accomplished thus far by our collection of
living animals has been in emphasizing the great need of a national
zoological garden, established in the city of Washington. The many
hundreds of eager visitors who daily crowd our menagerie building to
the point of positive discomfort, and the numerous gifts which come to
us unsought, have led Senator J. B. Beck to introduce in the United
States Senate a bill ‘‘for the establishment of a zoological park in the
District of Columbia for the advancement of science, and the instruction
and recreation of the people,” and appropriating therefor, as an initial
appropriation, the sum of $200,000. By direction of the Secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution, and also in pursuance of the desire of Sen-
ator Beck, the curator has exerted his utmost efforts to help bring
about the consummation of that much-desired and highly laudable end.

A very noticeable portion of the time of the curator has been taken
up by certain investigations and the preparation of various reports that
have been called for by the Secretary and Assistant Secretary, and pre-
pared accordingly, for publication or otherwise. The following have
been submitted :

A brief report on the results of the Smithsonian expedition for American Bison.

A full report of the same, with a map.

A report of investigations made in regard to the protection of game in the Yellow-
stone National Park, illustrated by a specially prepared map.

A plan, with estimates of cost, for a national zoological garden, to be located in
the District of Columbia.

A paper on the extermination of the American Bison, with maps and illustrations
(not quite completed during the year).

EXHIBIT AT THE CINCINNATI EXPOSITION.

In order to call the attention of the public to the fact that several
important species of North American mammals have already been ex-
terminated by man, and many others are rapidly going the same way,
the curator prepared during the month of June a special exhibit to.
DEPARTMENT OF LIVING ANIMALS. PY)

illustrate the extermination of American quadrupeds. This exhibit was
composed of the following features:

A series of mounted specimens of such mammals as already have
been exterminated and others that are rapidly approaching extinction.
The species represented were as follows: American bison, West Indian
seal, California elephant seal, walrus, moose, elk, mountain goat, moun-
tain sheep, antelope, and beaver.

A series of paintings and photographic pictures of large size, illus-
trating the methods by which the American bison has been extermi-
nated.

A series of specimens and a large oil painting showing what remains
to-day of the bison, skeletons bleaching on the western prairies.

A series of raw buffalo skins as representing the objects for which
the bison—was exterminated.

A collection of modern weapons of destruction, including examples
of nearly all American sporting rifles.
A lot of seventy skins of the rare and little-known Rocky Mountain
goat, which were taken by pot-hunters and sold in Denver at 50 cents

each.

This exhibit occupied 800 square feet of floor space. -

RECOMMENDATIONS.

At present the most serious drawback under which the Department
labors is the lack of space in the menagerie building for the proper
comfort of the visitors who daily visit the collection. For weeks in suc-_
cession the daily throng has been so great as to make it a matter of
difficulty to pass through the building, or even to pertorm necessary
work in connection with the care of the animals. It has several times
been estimated that between two and three thousand visitors have
viewed the collection in that small and rudely constructed building in
a single day.

At first an undesirable and disorderly element threatened to com-
pletely crowd out all other visitors, and it became necessary to station
a watchman in the building to compel the small-boy element to depart
after a reasonable time. The character of the visitors in daily attend-
ance is inthe highest degree complimentary to the experiment of open.
ing this collection to the public, and causes a constant regret that it is
impracticable, if not also impossible, to provide ample room for the
comfort of visitors and also to have all the appointments of the collec-
tion of the highest order of excellence.

Mr. W. C. Weeden is liable to be detached from service in this de-
partment at any time. It is earnestly hoped by the curator that since
his continuous services are imperatively needed in the menagerie, he
may be transferred to this department and regularly appointed as a
keeper.

THE COAST INDIANS OF SOUTHERN ALASKA AND NORTHERN BRITISH
COLUMBIA,

By Ensign ALBERT P. NrBiack, U. S. Navy.

I.

CHOROGRAPHY OF SOUTHERN ALASKA AND NORTHERN BRITISH
COLUMBIA. .

From Puget Sound in Washington Territory to Mount St. Elias in
southern Alaska, the coast line is broken into a continuous archipelago.
The Cascade Mountains, running throughout this territory parallel to
the coast line, leaves, adjacent to the Pacific, a strip of country about
150 miles broad and 1,000 miles long, called generally ‘The North West
Coast.” Through the narrow channels of this archipelago winds the ©
steamer route to Sitka, a route unparalleled for its length and the wild
magnificence of itsscenery. Warmed by Asiatic currents and moistened
by a phenomenal rain fall, this region is less rigorous in its climate
than generally supposed. Thickly wooded with pine, fir, spruce, and
hemlock, the vegetation spreads trom the water’s edge to the snow line
limit of the loftiest mountains. The forests are stocked with game and
the waters with food fishes. The soil, though not deep, is fertile, and
would itself support the native population without the other gifts with
which nature has so lavishly endowed them. In every crevice in the
rocks, where the soil is scantiest, a stunted tree rears its head. In the
spring the forests are gay with ferns, shrubs, and brightly colored wild
flowers, and in the summer a large variety of edible roots and berries
are’found in profusion.

Dotted throughout this region are the winter villages of the Coast
Indians, whose ethnic variations are somewhat marked as we go north,
but who differ as a group quite materially from the hunting Indians of
the interior, and more sharply from the Eskimo. In contrast with the
fierce, revengeful Tinné, they are generally mild in disposition. In
physical characteristics they are shorter, the cheek bones are less prom-
inent, the nose is straighter, and the face rounder and fuller. From

the Columbia River te Mount St. Elias these Coast Indians have marked
ethnic affiliations, but the linguistic variations are great, and in the
southern region are now the subject of systematic governmental investi-
gation.

Comparative philology and mythology, a study of the primitive cus-
toms and habits of the geographical and linguistic groups, and com-
parisons of the ethnological material and collections from this region,
can alone throw light upon the history and ethnic affinities of the various
Indian stocks.

ETHNOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN BRITISH COLUMBIA.

In British Columbia, the philological and mythological part of the
work has been commenced by Dr. W. F. Tolmie and Prof. George M.
Dawson, in connection with the geological and natural history survey
of Canada, and is now the subject of special investigation by a commit-
tee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, under a

grant for the purpose. Dr. Franz Boas is conducting the work for the
committee in the fleld, and the result is being from time to time pub-
lished. ie

For Washington Territory and Alaska, this investigation is in the
hands of the Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution.

SCOPE OF THIS PAPER.

The facts here published were gathered by the writer in the summer
seasons (May to October inclusive) of 1585, 1886, and 1887, while on
duty in the survey of Alaska now being carried on by the officers of the
Navy, under the direction of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. The
material presented has little bearing on the philology and mythology of
the region embraced in the survey. Such work must come later, be
undertaken more systematically, and carried on in the winter months,
when the Indians are located in their permanent villages. The writer
is indebted to Judge J. G. Swan, of Port Townsend, Washington Ter-
ritory, for valuable notes on the Haida of Queen Charlotte Islands. His
collections from the North West Coast, under the direction of the Smith-
sonian Institution, form the bulk of the ethnological material m the
National Museum from the region about Dixon entrance, and have been
freely used in the accompanying illustrations.

CLASSIFICATION. S

A provisional classification of the Indians of the North West Coast,
from Puget Sound to Cape St. Elias, based on philological considera-
tions, would, according to Dr. Franz Boas, divide them into three
groups, as follows:

Group I. Salish, Kwakiutl, and Wakashan (Nutkan).

Group II. Tsimshian.

Group If. Thngit and Haida.
SY

THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. oe

“It seems that the languages enumerated above represent as many
different linguistic stocks, so far as our limited knowledge extends.”*

A classification based on other than philological and geographical
groupings is out of the question at present. A comparative study ef
the customs, Labits, mythology, and beliefs of all the tribes of this re-
gion can alone form the basis of an ethnological classification. Charts I
and If show the location of the different Indian stocks on the North
West Coast. This paper, deals principally with the tribes around
Dixon entrance, and in our own Territory of Alaska, of which Chart I

shows the geographical grouping into stocks. The Kaigani, on the

southern part of Prince of Wales Island, are a branch of the Haidan
stock. On Annette Island, at Port Chester, will be seen the location
of the Tsimshian emigrants. This is a colony that, in 1887, under the
leadership of the missionary, Mr. Duncan, abandoned Metlah-Katlah-
British Columbia, owing to difficulties with the civil and eclesiastical
authorities. The Indians seem very largely to have sympathised with
the Rev. Mr. Duncan, as they voluntarily followed him to our own Ter-
ritory, where the settlement is called New Metlah-Katlah.

In Chart I no attempt is made to enumerate the tribes comprising
the different stocks. It is interesting, however, to observe that the
Bilqula are Salishan. t

HISTORY.

Huropean civilization has borne with crushing force upon the Indians
of the Northwest coast. Demoralized and staggered by contact with
the whites, the remnant of the former population is just beginning to
rally from the blow. Nothing places the Northern tribes higher in the
seale of intelligence than the philosophy with which they are adapting
themselves to their changed environment, retaining their advantageous
native customs and accepting from us only what contributes to their
comfort and welfare. The greatest curse to them has been alcohol,
and against this temptation they seem absolutely unable to struggle.

The early European voyagers to this region have preserved in their
narratives rough accounts of the habits, customs, and actual condition
of the natives. Our earliest acquaintance dates from the visit of Ber-
ing in 1741, coming fromthe north. [177475 the Spanish navigators,
Juan Perez and La Bodega y Quadra, coming from the south, explored
the coast to the northward. In 1778 Captain Cook, having with him
Vancouver as 2 midshipman, made his celebrated visit to this region.
After that several mercantile companies sent ships thither to trade,

*Science, vol. x11., No. 299, p. 194.

t‘‘Among the linguistic results of my journey the most interesting are the dis-
covery of three unknown dialects of the Salish stock and the establishment of
the fact that the Bilqula, who are of Salish lineage, must have lived at one time
with other Salish tribes near the sea.”—Notes on Ethnology of British Columbia (Am.
Philolog. Soc., Nov. 18, 1887, p. 422), by Dr. Franz Boas,
234 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

notably Captain Meares (1786), of the Kast India Company, and Cap-
tains Portlock and Dixon (1787), of the King George’s Sound Com-
pany. In 1788 several American ships, representing a Boston com-
pany, also appeared on the coast. In 1789 in the Washington, Captain
Gray explored the east coast of Queen Charlotte Islands, and, in 1791,
Captain Ingraham anchored in a harbor in the southeast part of this
same archipelago. In the same year, Marchand, representing a French
company, also traded with these islanders. .

In 1792~94 Captain Vancouver made his admirable reconnaissance of
the coast in search of a northwest passage to the Pacific from the
Atlantic.

In 1793 Mackenzie descended the Salmon River and reached salt
water in latitude 52° 21’ N., in the country of the Bilqula.

With the formal occupation, by Baranoff, of a fortified post at Sitka
in 1800, the natives of the Northwest coast may be said to have entered
upon a new phase in their civilization, due to contact with the whites.
A few years later this post was destroyed and the occupants massa-
cred by the Tlingit; but, in 1805, Baranoff and Lisiansky re-established
it on the site now occupied by the town of Sitka, called by them New
Archangel. From this time to the purchase of Alaska by the United
States in 1867, the history of this region is largely the history of the
Russian-American and the Hudson Bay Company, the latter of which
still continues to be such a powerful commercial factor in British
America,

ENVIRONMENT—ORGANIC AND INORGANIC; 4ND CHARACTERISTICS OF
THE INDIANS—PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, INTELLECTUAL, MORAL, AND
AESTHETIC.

ENVIRONMENT.

The physical character of the region occupied by the Tlingit, Haida,
and Tsimshian is similar in general to that of southern British Colum-
bia, but for local reasons this area has a peculiar climate. A branch of
the warm Japanese current sweeps along the coast, and, coming in con-
tact with the colder air and water of the north, gives rise to excessive
humidity, producing in summer the rains and fogs, and in winter the
snows and sleets, that are so prevalent in thisregion. Thermometrical
observations, extending over a period of fifty years in the region about
Sitka, give the lowest winter temperature as 4° Fah. below zero, the
mean winter temperature being about 33° Fah., the same as in
Washington, District of Columbia. In the summer, on the contrary,
the rainy and overcast days so predominate, that the temperature never
rises above 90° Fah. The maximum recorded about Sitka is 87° Fah.
With an annual rainfall of from 60 to 95 inches and an average of be-
tween one hundred and ninety and two hundred and eighty-five days
in the year on which rain has been known to fall,* the climate may be
said to have its drawbacks. The shortest winter days are from four to
five hours long, while the summer nights are correspondingly brief. In
the long summer days, when the weather is fine, the atmosphere is won-
derfully clear, and the scenery fairly sparkles with an excessive brilliancy
due to exceptional hygrometric conditions.

The territory is very broken and subdivided. It is densely wooded
with spruce, hemlock, white pine, fir, birch, alder, and underbrush, the
vegetation crowding down to the high-water line. Itis also very mount-
ainous, and indented with bays and arms of the sea. The waters are
deep and the tidal currents swift, the tides rising and falling twice a
day through a ravge of from 12 to 21 feet, making navigation in places
extremely hazardous. Travel is entirely by water, the villages being
on the water courses, and the canoe here reaches its highest develop-
ment. Huge landslides in the face of the mountains, snow-capped
ranges with sparkling glaciers in the sides and valleys, floating glacier
ice in the bays and straits, and the bright green vegetation every where,
all these give a characteristic beauty to the scenery of this region.

The principal fur-bearing animals are the brown and black bear, wolf,
the cross, red, and silver fox ; beaver, miuk, marten, and land otter, while
in the mountains of the mainland are wild goats and sheep. Cod, her-
ring, trout, and eulachon abound in certain localities, but the staple
supply is furnished by the halibut and salmon. To complete the pict-
ure there must be mentioned the innumerable floeks of wild ducks and
geese in season, the lonely herons and cranes, the omnipresent gulls,
eagles, hawks, crows, and ravens, the skimming surf birds, and, in the
woods, not generally seen from canoes, grouse and a variety of smaller
members of the feathered tribe.

In Dixon Entrance, Clarence, Sumner, and Chatham Straits, and par-
ticularly in Frederick Sound and Stephen’s Passage, Alaska,,is the
breeding ground for whales, which may be seen spouting in schools of
six or seven. Wherever the whale is, there also is found the whale-
killer (Orca ater). These run also singly or in schools, and are the mer-
ciless enemy of the whale. The dorsal fin, projecting so prominently
above the surface of the water, gives them a characteristic readily
seized upon by the native artist, who never omits this appendage from
his conventional drawing or carving of this animal.

The presence of the bear, eagle, raven, wolf, orca, whale, and ounen
representatives of the site kingdom in this region, and the know-
ledge of their peculiarities by the Indians, explain the prominent part
they play in the mythology of the coast, as stated in Chapter vm.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS.

The Indians about Dixon Entrance are unquestionably superior in
physique to the coast Indians to the southward. As among themselves
the physical superiority rests with the Haida. This may be due to real
ethnical differences, but is probably accounted for in the fact that natural
conditions in the Queen Charlotte Islands and around such an exposed
arm of the sea as Dixon Entrance have produced a finer and mere robust
people than those in less exposed regions. While there is considerable
uniformity in the general physical characters of all the stocks on the
northwest coast, a practised eye can detect the differences between them.

Langsdorff (1805) says of the Tlingit:

They do not appear to have the least affinity with the Mongol tribes; they have in
general large, fiery eyes; a small, flat, broad nose; and large cheek-bones ; indeed, in
all respects, large and strongly marked features.”

In general amongst the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian, the hair is
thick, stiff, coarse, straight, and black. It is worn short by the men,
excepting the shamans or doctors, and long by the women. Instances
citedt of auburn tresses and golden curls are ascribable to intermixt-
ure with European and American traders. The eyebrows are small
and the eyes generally black or brown, though gray eyes are to be seen.

THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. ZO

The habit of plucking the hair from the face and body obtains among
the younger men, but the older ones suffer it to grow and wear a scanty
beard and mustache, never however attaining any considerable length.
Amongst the latter, also, long years of service in canoes has impaired
their powers of locomotion and misshapen their legs, rendering them
decidedly awkward on shore. This, by comparison, gives the body a
long and large appearance. The head appears unusually large, due
both to a real disproportion and to the mass of bushy hair and the high
cheek-bones of the men. Their noses are less flat and fleshy than those
of the Indians to the south. The teeth are white and fine, but in old
age are much discolored and worn. The wearing down of the teeth
comes from eating dried salmon on which sand and grit have been blown
during the process of drying. The hands and feet are small and well
shaped, especially amongst the women. As they all go barefooted a
greater part of the year, their feet are callous, excoriated, and wrinkled
by exposure. The women are comely and fine looking in youth and in
early bloom usually have rosy cheeks. In complexion both sexes are
surprisingly light colored. This is in no way due to intermixture with
whites. Dixon (1787) says that they were “ very little darker than the
Europeans in general.* Langsdorff makes the same statement.t The
Haida are markedly fairer skinned than the others, but still the dark
tinge is quite apparent, and exposure always adds to it.

The habit of frequent bathing in both winter and summer hardens
their physique. As soon as a child is able to leave its cradle it is bathed
in the ocean every day without regard to season, and this custom is kept
up by both sexes through life. This, with scant wrappings, kills off the
sickly children, and hardens the survivors. The scanty clothing worn
by the men, their reckless exposure in all kinds of weather, and their
ignorance of hygienic laws of ventilation and sanitation in their dwell-
ings, bring in their train a long series of ills.

They are not particularly long-lived, although grey-haired people
are not uncommon. Rheumatism and pulmonary diseases are their
worst ills. Small-pox has ravaged the coast terribly. First intro-
duced amongst the Tlingit by the Spaniards in 1775,§ it worked its
way down the coast, breaking out from time to time in later years, de- .
populating villages and proving a fatal scourge to the natives of this
region. No one thing contributed more to dishearten and subjugate
these Indians than the ravages made by this fell disease.

Weak eyes and blindness are aue to exposure and to the smoke of
camp and household fires. Debauchery by bad alcohol, worse whisky,
and the native *‘ hoochinoo” has added its quota to the physical misfor-
tunes of the Indians, while venereal diseases are extremely destruc-
tive. j M

Their habits of life are quite regular, and, when undisturbed by war,
they carry on a definite routine throughout the different seasons, col-
lecting food, furs and raw materials at one season to serve them for
the next.

EMOTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS.

They are self-possessed, dignified and reserved, although much less tae-
iturn than the hunting Indians of the western plains and the interior.
They have the usual Indian stoicism under suffering, and bear extremes
of cold, heat, hunger, and exposure with fortitude. They are quite
venturesome, going well out to sea in their canoes. The Kaigani go
out to Forrester’s Island for birds’ eggs every spring, 20 miles off the
coast. Dixon (1787) states that he sighted a Haida canoe 8 miles out
at sea, and, though caught in a fog, it reached land in safety, as he
afterwards met the same party close in shore.* They often make trips
of hundreds of miles in their canoes along the coast and interior waters,
although in early days this was not so feasible, owing to the warlike
relations of the different tribes. They are fond of parade and display,
and are scrupulous observers of ceremony and etiquette. Many of
their deadly feuds originate from trifling causes based on breaches of
etiquette or custom. Dancing and singing are a part of their cere-
monies of welcome, trade, and war, and to the early voyagers to this
region the Indians seemed entirely given over to these exercises. Their
narratives express generally the impression that these natives were
aggravatingly and immoderately fond of dancing, because they could
not trade with them until they had finished singing and feasting. They
are equally fond of long speeches and addresses—it all being intended
to impress the observer with the rank, importance, and influence of the
individual who provides the entertainment. They are also great stick-
lers for justice and for custom. When smarting under the sense of
areal injury or imaginary wrong they are cruelly and unreasonably
revengeful, although ordinarily friendly. They impressed the early
voyagers as being somewhat hospitable and generous, although this was
largely, as now, founded upon the expectation of an equivalent return.

Their bravery is relative. If stronger than an opponent, their war-
like demonstrations are quite pronounced, but in the presence of a supe-
rior force they are inclined to be submissive and peaceful, although
ready to take an underhand advantage. Ambush, surprise, and supe-
rior numbers are the favorable conditions of coast Indian warfare,
and no mercy is shown to women and children, except perhaps to make
slaves of them or to hold them for a ransom. While slavery was prac-
ticed, before its abolition by our Government in 1867, slaves were
treated with cruelty.

It is the universal testimony, as voiced by Portlock (1787), that “‘ they
treat their wives and children with much affection and tenderness.”}

* Dixon, Voyage, p. 211. + Portlock, Voyages, p. 290.
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 239

In the approach to political and industrial equality of the S@Xes,
and in the respect shown for the opinions of their females, these
Indians furnish another refutation of the old misconception concerning
the systematic mal-treatment of the women by savages. Such a thing
is incompatible with the laws of nature. Good treatment of the female
is essential to the preservation of the species, and it will be found that
this ill-treatment is more apparent than real.

By nature they are rather indolent, but their love of the power and
the display incident to wealth has changed their disposition since 1775,
so that they have become more enterprising. Originally the chiefs
conducted the trade of the tribe, but in time the natural abilities of
the other sex in driving bargains has resulted in the predominance
of the influence of the women in such matters.

They endeavor to impress others with their importance, wealth, and
powers, but are guarded in their expressions of wonder, surprise. or
enjoyment at what they see elsewhere. They have come now to rely
upon European medicines in sickness. When through carelessness,
recklessness, and ignorance of the laws of health they come to grief,
they incontinently dose themselves with all sorts of patent medicines
which they buy from the traders.

Missionaries have been comparatively successful amongst them, the
Greek and Presbyterian Churches having made considerable progress
with them. The opportunities for long addresses, prayers, experience
meetings, and singing in some of the Protestantforms of worship ap-
peal strongly to native predilections, the influence of the Greek Church
being principally about Sitka. The missionaries, however, discourage
their dancing, and have influenced them in many localities to cut down
the totemic columns and abandon cremation for inhumation-at-length
as practiced by the whites.

INTELLECTUAL CHARACTERISTICS.

One sees many strikingly intelligent and attractive faces amongst
the older men and women, where experience has given decided char-
acter to their expressions. The stolid, imperturbable moodiness attrib-
uted to the Indians of the interior here gives place to a more alert ex-
pression of countenance. They acquire knowledge readily, and the
children at school make fair progress. They are quite ingenious, and
especially handy with toois, picking up a trade with surprising readi-
ness, and turning their hands to almost any sort of business. They
are quite imitative and progressive, but have shown good sense and
conservatism in retaining many native implements and methods where
better adapted to their needs. They have a keen appreciation of the
value of money, work for wages, and have considerable business judg-
* ment. It would seem that, with their ideas of acquiring wealth, we
have little to teach them in habits of thrift. Of necessity, they have a
good knowledge of the topography and hydrography of their region,

¢
240 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

and of the habits and best modes of capture of ail sorts of marine ani-
mals. On shore they are rather disappointing as hunters, as they are
not at all cool headed. Their superstitions, beliefs, and practices of
witchcraft, sorcery, slavery, and shamamism do not necessarily place
them on a very degraded intellectual plane when we compare their
practices and beliefs with those of other savage tribes.

They possess a fair knowledge of human nature ; have good oratorical
powers; are communicative when diplomatically approached ; have a
keen sense and appreciation of the grotesque; and have a great sense of
wit and humor, as they laugh immoderately at the antics of the dancers,
the witty remarks of the clowns, and the grotesque carvings erected in
ridicule of the whites or of their neighbors. Placing implicit confidence
in the truth of their legends and the reliability of their carved columns,
they have an immense respect for graphic characters. Anything writ-
ten on paper or carved is per sé credible, and. they attach the greatest
value to a letter of recommendation written by a white man, irrespec-
tive of the sentiments expressed by the writer.

MORAL CHARACTERISTICS.

Judged by our standard, these Indians of the north have fallen by the
way side. Judged by their primitive ethigal conceptions, as compared
with those of the surrounding tribes when they first came in contact
with the whites, they may be said to be distinguished by the great prog-
ress they had themselves made in morals. When first visited by the
early voyagers these Indians, like all others on the coast, were bold,
arrant thieves. With them it was not dishonorable to steal, and, if
caught, restitution settled the matter. On the other hand, they dis-
criminated, and seldom or never stole from a guest, and uever robbed
one of their own totem. With them, to-day, an unwatched camp or an
unlocked house is sacredly respected, and the most valuable property
-eached in the woods, as is the Indian custom, is as safe from other In-
dians as if guarded night andday. Unfortunately, white men have set
some very bad examples in this respect, and the Indians have been
more often sinned against than sinning.

They have great respect for the aged, whose advice in most matters
has great weight. Some of the older women, even bond women in
former times, attain great influence in the tribe as soothsayers, due as
much to their venerable appearance as to any pretense they may make
of working medicine charms. They are remarkably fond of and indul-
gent to their children, rarely chastising them. As between the sexes,
the rights of the women are respected and the terms of equality on
which the men and women liveare very striking to most visitors of this
region. Although marriage is essentially by purchase, and the question
of morality and immorality of the wife solely one of sanction by the
husband, yet even this restriction is centuries in advance of their
northern neighbors, the Aleuts and Koniagas, with whom promiscuity

and the most bestial practices obtain. Early voyagers invariably
mention the modest, reserved, and decorous bearing of the Tlingit,
Haida, and Tsimshian women. Unfortunately, in recent years, the pur-
chase of women and the practice of sanctioned prostitution have, under
the spur of artificial needs of finery and luxuries, had a most demoral-
izing effect on them, and, with the rum question, are the serious problem
which confronts the friend of the Indian. In their inveterate addiction
to gambling and their craving for tobacco and alcohol they possess
simply the vices incident to savagism. In their disregard for the lives
and feelings of slaves, and in their practices of compounding murder
and other crimes by the payment of indemnity to the relatives of the
injured, we see simply the operations of custom, which with them has
the force of law. Murder, seduction, wounds, accidental killing, loss of
articles belonging to another, refusal to marry a widow according to
law, casus belli in general, any wrong may be righted by payment of
an indemnity in the currency of the region.

Sir James Douglas, Governor of the Hudson Bay Company about
1840, says:

If unmarried women prove frail, the partner of their guilt, if discovered, is bound
to make reparation to the parents, soothing their wounded honor with handsome
presents. A failure to do this would cause the friends of the offending fair one to use
force to back up their demands and to revenge the insult. It must not, however,
be supposed they would be induced to act this part from any sense of reflected shame,
or from a desire of discouraging vice by making a severe example of the vicious, or
that the girl herself has any visitings of remorse, or that the parents think her a bit
the worse for the accident, or her character in any way blemished. Such are not
their feelings, for the offender is simply regarded as a robber who has committed

depredations on their merchandise, their only anxiety being to make the damages
exacted as heavy as possible.*

Petroff illustrates as follows the curious custom of paying for in-
juries:

Wars are frequently avoided by an indemnity arrangement, and they go so far in
this system of compensation that they demand payment for losses from parties who
have been in no way instrumental incausing them. For instance, an Indian at Sitka
broke into the room of two miners in their absence, emptied a demijohn of liquor,
and died in consequence, and the relatives of the robber demanded and received pay-
ment from the unfortunate Caucasians. If a man be attacked by a savage dog and
kills him in self-defense, he must pay for the dog to the Tlingit owner. A small
trading schooner, while running before a furious gale, rescued two Tlingit from a
sinking canoe, which had been carried to sea. The canoe was nearly as long as the
schooner and could “ot be carried or towed, seeing which, the natives themselves cut
the worthless craft adrift. When the humane captain landed the rescued men at
their village he was astonished by a peremptory demand for payment for the canoe,
backed by threats of retaliation or vengeance.*

To such an extent was this question of indemnity carried, that when

the Russians at Sitka tried to interfere with the killing of slaves on
ceremonial occasions, they were only successful in preventing it by ran-

soming the proposed victims. A narration of the exactions of the
Indians for damages on account of the accidental deaths of relatives in
the employ of whites would fill a chapter.

AESTHETIC CHARACTERS.

These Indians are exceedingly fond of singing and dancing; have
considerable artistic taste in the use of colors; are advanced in the arts
of carving; and have fair abilities in drawing and designing—all of
which will appear in subsequent chapters. Their carvings in slate
show the height to which their art rises, and would seem to easily place
them at the head of the savage tribes of the world, especially when
taken in conjunction with their industrial development. They bathe
frequently in the sea, but on the other hand continually daub their
faces, bodies, and heads with grease and paint, although this latter
fashion is now dying out and has almost disappeared, except as an
occasional custom. They were formerly indifferent to the stench of de-
cayed animal and vegetable matter about their houses and villages,
but the influence of the whites has wonderfully improved them in this
respect. They are still, however, indifferent to all sanitary laws of
ventilation, and their fondness for putrid salmon noses and herring
roe is very trying, while the smell of rancid grease destroys the es-
thetic value of many otherwise interesting cnrios from the region. A
visit to an Indian house is to the uninitiated still somewhat of an ordeal,
although nothing to what it formerly was. Through living in such in-
timate relations in the houses, there is an absence of a becoming sense
of modesty in family life, although the offenses are chiefly to be laid at
the door of the men, who in the summer months go almost naked,
whereas the women dress very much the same in all seasons.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

Contact with the whites has staggered and arrested these Indians in
their development. They are now adjusting themselves to a new mode
of life. Although much reduced in numbers, they are far from being
near extermination. Much is to be hoped for in the recent establish-
ment of industrial and other schools and in the general interest now
taken in the Indians. In the prohibition and prevention of the sale of
liquor to them a great step has been taken. Much more needs to be
done in the suppression of prostitution, in the recognition of Indian
rights to hunting and fishing grounds, and in medical assistance to a
people childishly ignorant of the simplest laws of health. Their Indian
doctors are fast disappearing, and with them much of the degrading
superstition of an ethnical group capable of almost any rise in the scale _
of civilization,
Ii.

REGULATIVE ORGANIZATION: CONSANGUINEAL—POLITICAL—IN-
DUSTRIAL.

Government does not begin in the ascendency of chieftains through prowess in war,
but in the slow specialization of executive functions from communal associations
based on kinship. * * * Evolution in society has not been from militancy to in-
dustrialism, but from organization based on kinship to organization based on prop-
perty, and alongside of the specializations of the industries of peace the arts of war
have been specialized.*

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

On the northwest coast totemism permeates the whole tribal organi-
zation. The ceremonies at birth, initiation, naming, matrimony, feast-
ing, dancing, funerals, and all other social occasions, all have for their
object, in some way, the identification of the individual with his totem
under its specific name. A totem is simply an organization of con-
sanguineal kindred into a recognized group or band, but with its defi-
nition and practical workings we have more to do later.

Amongst the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian, the organizatian is
based on mother-right; that is, birth-rights, such as rank, wealth, prop-
erty, etc., are received from the mother. Amongst the southern tribes
of British Columbia father-right is the form of social organization.
In the lowest and rudest forms of primitive human society we have
simply the recognition of the maternity of a child, the paternity either not
being known, or not considered. Matriarchy, this tracing of descent in
the female line only, ‘‘ mother rule,” finds its most primitive form in
the tribal organization of some of the Australians, where the tribe
and child recognize a group of mothers (a sub-phratry), their issues, as
it were, being pooled. The evolution of patriarchy, the recognition of
definite male descent, “ father-rule,” is obscure, but its most primitive
form is also found amongst some Australian tribes, where a group of
fathers belonging to a sub-phratry have the monopoly of privileges
with the women of a corresponding female sub-phratry, although the
tribes may be a thousand miles apart and speak different languages. {
As we advance from matriarchy towards patriarchy, we find, at the
boundary, tribes wavering between female and male descent, or in which

t Frazer, Totemism, p. 67.
243
244 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

the male and female line have equal rights, but everywhere mother
rule seems to have preceded father rule. ‘‘The couvade or custom in
accordance with which the husband takes to his bed and is treated as
an invalid when his wife has given birth to a child is perhaps a fiction,
intended to transfer to the father those rights over the children which
under the previous system of mother-kin, had been enjoyed by the
mother alone.”* In the evolution of social organization, therefore,
matriarchy naturally precedes patriarchy. In the recognition of pater-
nity and in the accumulation and inheritance of property from both
father and mother, or either, we find the beginnings of patriarchy and
of the evolution from ‘organization based on kinship to organization
based on property.” The recognition of property may be in itself the
first step in this evolution. With the development of the institution
of marriage, man’s position in the community becomes fixed by kinship.
In the segregation of blood relatives, based on either matriarchy or
patriarchy, we get the household. In the organization of consanguineal
kindred, we have the basis of the communal organization. In this
stage, ‘There is no place in a tribe for any person whose kinship is
not fixed, and only those persons can be adopted into the tribe who
are adopted into some family with artificial kinship specified. The
fabric of Indian society is a complex tissue of kinship. The warp is
made of streams of kindship blood, and the woof ef marriage ties.” t

What has here been briefly said with regard to the origin and de-
velopment of the patriarchal form of social organization from the ma-
triarchal is peculiarly pertinent to a study and comparison of the
ethnical affinities of the tribes of the northwest coast. The southern
tribes have very few of the customs and traditions peculiar to the
northern, and their social organization is different, ‘* mother-rule” be-
ing peculiar to the northern group and “ father-rule” to the southern.
Dr. Franz Boas says:

On account of philological considerations, I think that the social organization of
the Kwakiut] was originally patriarchal, or it may be more correct to say that the
male and female line had equal rights. This opinion is founded on the fact that even
among the tribes among whom matriarchate prevails at present, the same terms are
used for denoting relationship in the male and female lines.

No satisfactory inferences as to the influence of these various north-
west coast tribes on one another in traditions, customs, aud social
organization can as yet be drawn in view of the meager data we have.
There is no more promising field for sociological study than in this re-
gion. In the ceremonial institutions, in the elaborate dance parapher-
nalia, in the carved heraldic columns, in the wide variations in the
mortuary customs, in all the practices of tribes of highly imaginative
and inventive Indians, we have here similarities and differences so be-

THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. QA5

wildering, that it 1s difficult te trace the mutual influences of the differ-
ent ethnic groups. In nothing, however, more than in the totemic or-
ganization do we recognize these differences.

TOTEMISM.

The organization of consanguineal kindred is variously called the
totem, the clan, the totem clan, or the gens (plural, gentes). Frazer, in
his work on Totemism, thus defines it : *

A totem is a class of material objects which a savage regards with superstitious re-
spect, believing that there exists between him and every member of the class an in-
timate and altogether special relation... * * * The connection between aman and
his totem is mutually beneficent ; the totem protects the man, and the man shows
his respect for the totem in various ways, by not killing it if it be an animal, and not
cutting or gathering it if it be a plant.

Considered in relation to men, totems are of at least three kinds: (1) The clan to-
tem, common to a whole clan, and passing by inheritance from generation to genera-
tion; (2) the sex totem * * * (3) The individual totem, belonging to a single
individual and not passing to his descendants. * * *

The clan totem.—The clan totem is reverenced by a body of men and women who
call themselves by the name of the totem, believe themselves to be of one blood, de-
scendants of a common ancestor, and are bound together by common obligations to
each other, and by a common faith in the totem. Totemism is thus both a religious
and a social system. In its religious aspect it consists of the relations of mutual re-
spect and protection between a man and his totem; in its social aspect it consists of |
the relations of the clansmen to each other and to men of other clans. In the later
history of totemism these two sides, the religious and the social, tend to part com-
pany. *~ * * On the whole, the evidence points strongly to the conclusion that the
two sides were originally inseparable ; that, in other words, the further we go back
the more we should find that the clansman regards himself and his totem as beings of
the same species, and the less he distinguishes between conduct towards his totem and
towards his fellow-clansmen.

Tribal Society.—These totems, clans, or gentes are sometimes organ-
ized into groups called phratries, the union of the latter forming the
tribe or people. We have, therefore, (1) the household or family; (2)
the totem; (3) the phratry ; and (4) the tribe.

On the northwest coast the household is not the unit of the totem or
of the phratry, as more than one totem is represented in each; the father
belonging to one totem and the mother and children to another. Besides
this, a brother and his wife may belong to the household, or a sister and
her husband ; thus numerous totems may be represented under one roof.

The practice of totemism on the northwest coast has not yet received
the thorough study it deserves. It remains for some organization,
governmental or incorporated, to systematicaliy collect the data nec-
essary for a complete tabulation of the phratries and gentes of all the
tribes, and an exposition of their mutual relations and significance. In
connection with this, a study of the totemic carvings, legends, myths,
and folk-lore, must be prosecuted. The lists of totems from time to time
published have served so far to obscure rather than elucidate the sub-

* Totemism p. 1, sq.
246 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

ject, owing to the apparent want of agreement of any two writers. The
tendency to generalize from a study of one tribe alone has added to the
confusion. Thorough and systematic collection of data at each village
can alone give a reliable groundwork for generalizations. This work
must be undertaken soon, or it will prove either incomplete or too late
altogether. ~

The exceedingly imperfect data given here will at least serve as a pre-
liminary sketch of the tabulation.

CONSANGUINEAL ORGANIZATION.

Totems.—F rom their nature, totems are in a state of flux. Clans tend
to become phratries split up into sub-phratries ; sub-phraties decay and
finally disappear. An individual distinguishes himself,becomes wealthy,
and hence a leading man in the village. His totem, or indeed his in-
dividual crest or sub-totem, may have been an obscure one. As he
rises, its importance in the tribe rises with him. Under his successsor,
the totem widens its numbers and influence, and finally eclipses other
clan totems, which eventually melt away or are incorporated with it.
In the course of time, either by the accession of other totems or else by
its splitting up into sub-totems, it came finally to be ranked as a
phratry, then a sub-phratry. In this evolution we see the sub-totem
grow into a cian totem, then into a phratry or sub-phratry, when decay
sets in, and it “melts into the vast reservoir of nature from which it
sprang.”

On the northwest coast we see only a few of the stages in this evolu-
tion, but by a study of totemism as it exists in all parts of the world
the curve of the rise and fall of totems has been so accurately plotted,
that there will probably be found in this region no wide variations
from the general system. ;

Tlingit— Amongst the Tlingit two exogamous groups of gentes exist,
that is, they are divided into two phratries. The individuals composing
the gentes in one phratry can only marry individuals in any gentes of
the other. These phratries are popularly called the Raven and the

Wolf. Much confusion arises from the fact that in the Wolf phratry
we have the Wolf totem, and in the Raven phratry the Raven totem.
Frazer says of this:

Considering the prominent parts played in Tlingit mythology by the ancestors of

the two phratries, and considering that the phratries are also names of clans, it

seems probable that the Raven and Wolf were the two original clans of the Tlingits,
which afterwards by sub-division became phratries*. —

Through popular misapprehension the origin of these two phratries

*FPrazer, Totemism, p. 62. This seems to be further borne out by the testimony of-
Lisiansky, Voyag., p. 242, Sitka (1805). ‘‘The tribe of the wolf are called the
Coquebans, and have many privileges over the other tribes. They are considered
the best warriors, and are said to be scarcely sensible to pain, and to have no fear of
death. Ifin war a person of this tribe is taken prisoner he is always treated well
and is generally set at liberty.”
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 247

is assigned to the tradition of the two mythical beings or heroes, Tétl
and Kanuk, whose struggles, valor, and beneficence endowed the
Tlingit-with the good things of life. In his frequent transformations
Tetl often adopted the form of the raven, giving to the Raven phratry
the apparent right to claim descent from the great Tétl. Some authori-
ties claim to identify Kanuk, the other godlike personage with the
progenitor of the Wolf phratry ; but Dr. Franz Boas claims through his
interpretations of the Tlingit legends that “this Kanuk is identical
with the eagle,”* and also that the Tlingit use the title Eagle and Wolf
without discrimination in designating the so-called Wolf phratry.
May not this be due to a possible amalgamation of the Wolf and the
Hagle totem at a remote period ante-dating the growth of the totem
into a phratry. This amalgamation takes place in the course of time
in all Indian communities having a totemic organization. The partial
list of Tlingit totems as verified by the writer is as follows:

The above totems are divided into sub-totems with special names
denoting locality and collateral relationship. The vocabulary of titles,
sub-titles, etc., is a large one, and needs in itself special study. The
data has not yet been collected to enable us to give an adequate idea
of the complexity and ramifications of the Tlingit totemic organization.

Kaigani.—The principal totems are the Crow, Raven, Brown Bear,
Beaver, Eagle, Wolf, and Whale. In addition are also found the Seal,
Orca (Killer), Gull, Crane, Frog, Shark, and others. Boas adds the
Sparrow-hawk, Codfish, and Skate. The two exogamous groups or
phratries amongst the Kaigani are the Wolf and the Eagle, according to
Boas, designated as the Is’atV@nas and Tak’tl @nas. The division of

gamated into one called by a different name from either, viz, Nanad’ri.
248 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

the above named totems into the two groups is not known definitely
enough by the writer to warrant giving the list. HKnough is known
however to illustrate several anomalous groupings. Tor instance, the
Raven and Bear totems belong to the Eagle phratry, whilst amongst the
Tlingit they belong to the opposite or Raven phratry. In consequence
of this, when, for instance, a Kaigani of either of these totems goes to
Fort Wrangell (Stikine) or Tongass (Tunghoash), he becomes a member
of the opposite phratry, and can only marry in what, in his own village,
would be his own phratry. This illustrates very forcibly that it is the
gens or totem which counts. Once a Bear always a Bear; whereas the
phratry is in one sense limited or local. The obligations attaching to
a totem are not, therefore, confined to tribal or national limits, but ex-
tend throughout the whole region. In childhood a transfer can be
made from one totem to another. Supposing a chief desires his son to
succeed him and to belong to his own totem; the babe is transferred
to his sister to suckle, and is figuratively adopted by her. In this way
the son acquires the totemship of his father, and at an early age is taken
back by his own mother to raise. Dawson cites these cases of transfer
as often effected among the Haida to strengthen the totem of the father
when its number has become reduced and there is danger not only of
loss of prestige but of extinction. The ties of the totem or of the
phratry are considered far stronger than those of blood-relationship.
A man can not marry in his own totem whether within or without his
own tribe, or his own phratry within his own tribe. ‘There is nothing to
prevent a man from marrying his first cousin, and much to prohibit his
marriage to a most remote connection or an absolute stranger. The
_ children always take the mother’s totem amongst the Tlingit, Kaigani,
Haida, and Tsimshian, unless transferred to the father’s by a fiction.
Thus ‘“mother-rule,” or matriarchy prevails. Wealth and chiefship
descend in the female line in a most curious way, as explained hereafter
in dealing with the subjects of chiefship and inheritance. Dawson,
speaking of the intertribal relation of totems, says: :

An Indian on arriving at a strange village where he may apprehend hostility would
look for a house indicated by its carved post as belonging to his totem and make for
it. The master of the house, coming out, may, if he likes, make a dance in honor of
his visitor, but in any case protects him from allinjury. Inthe same way, should an
Indian be captured as a slave by some warlike expedition and brought into the vil-
lage of his captors, it behooves any one of his totem, either man or woman, to pre-
sent themselves to the captors, and, singing a certain sacred song, offer to redeem the
captive. Blankets and other property are given for this purpose. Should the slave
be given up, the redeemer sends him back to his tribe and the relatives pay the re-
deemer for what he has expended. Should the captors refuse to give up the slave
for the property offered, it is considered rather disgraceful to them. This, at least,
is the custom pursued in regard to captives included in the same totem system as them-
selves by the Tsimshians, and it is doubtless identical or very similar among the
Haidas, though no special information on this subject was obtained from them.*

* Dawson, Report, B, p. 134.
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 249

‘This is also the custom amongst the Tlingit and Kaigani. Langs-
dorff (1805) cites the custom about Sitka, and says that the ransom was
usually paid in sea-otter skins.*

Haida.—Dawson states that—

A single system of totems (Haida, Kwalla) extends throughout the different tribes
of the Haidas, Kaiganis, Tsimshians, and neighboring peoples. * * * The totems
found among these peoples are designated as the eagle, wolf, crow, black bear, and fin-
whale (or killer). The two last named are united, so that but four clans are counted
in all. The Haida names for these are, in order, koot, koo-ji, kit-si-naxa and sxa-nu-xa.
The members of the different totems are generally pretty equally distributed in each
tribe. Those of the same totem are all counted, as it were, of one tamily, and the
chiet bearing of the system appears to be on marriage.t

According to Boas, the Haida are divided into numerous totems and
into the two phratries, Eagle and Raven, the same as the Kaigani.{

In the absence of any other information the subject must rest in this
unsatisfactory condition.

Tsimshian.— Amongst the Tsimshian there are four gentes or totems,
the Raven, the Eagle, the Bear, and the Wolf. A person of any totem
may marry into any other than his own indifferently. In the strict sense,
therefore, there are no phratries amongst the Tsimshian. Boas states’
that the totems of the Kwakiutl are the Raven, Eagle, and Bear, and -
that he believes that the Tsimshian have in general modified the cus-
toms of northern Kwakiutl. §

Origin of Totemism.—Some idea has been given of the systems of
totems amongst the northern tribes of the northwest coast. Its prac-
tical workings will be given later on, in treating of the habits, customs,
and traditions of these tribes. It may, in one sense, be out of place
here to deal with the theory of totemism in a work of this nature, but
something may be added to the general fund of speculation. No satis-
factory theory has yet been advanced in explanation of the origin of
totemism. Mr. Herbert Spencer finds it (1) in the primitive custom
of naming children after natural objects from some accidental circum.
stance or fanciful resemblance or in nicknaming later in life; (2) the
confounding of or misinterpretation_of such metaphorical names or
nicknames with the real objects, that is, confusing these objects with
their ancestors of the same name, and reverencing them as they
already reverenced their ancestors. Sir John Lubbock takes his stand
on the “‘supposed resemblance” theory. ‘Totemism can not be traced
from ancestor worship directly, because if actually exists where there
is the most unsatisfactory recognition of ancestry, that is of paternity
or maternity, or even both. The confusion of natural objects with their
known ancestors of the same names and reverencing them as they rev-
erence such ancestors is in itself quite plausible enough, but the ex-

250 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

istence of totemism where ancestry is vaguely or not at all recognized
would seem in itself to call for some other solution.

Does not the theory of authropomorphism, the childish and natural
philosophy of all phenomena, as suggesed by Prof. O. T. Mason, account
for totemism? Belief in the possibility of human descent from natural
objects exists universally amongst primitive people. This has undoubt-
edly been strengthened by the credibility of the reality of experience in
dreams, which, as a sequence, is followed by a belief in the possibility
of sexual relations with objects of nature also founded on dreams. The
existence of customs in Bengal, Servia, and Greece of marrying bride
and groom to trees before marriage to each other is an illustration of
the survival of such belief.*

Clearly, before we can have a recognition of ancestry, we must have
a recognition of paternity; and a misinterpretation of names and con- —
founding of ancestry with natural objects can not precede a belief-in
the possibility of sexual relations and descent from natural objects. It
seems not unreasonable therefore to trace the origin of the belief last
named to the well-known authropomorphism and credulity of savages
in the reality of dreams. This is simply here suggested as a partial
solution of the question.

POLITICAL ORGANIZATION.

Chiefs and Petty Chiefs.—In the sense in which the term is ordinarily
used, there is no absolute chiefship. The family is the sociological unit.
The head of that household in the village, which, through inheritance,
wealth, numbers, and influence, predominates over the others, is nomi-
nally chief of the village. His authority is shadowy, and his power is
largely due, aside from wealth, good birth, and family influence, to his
prowess in war, or to personal and masterful qualities. Now and then,
through various causes, a chief may rule a village with absolute or des-
potic sway, but the power is not so much due to headship, in itself, as
to personal and aggressive qualities in the individual. Rank is prin-
cipally dependent on wealth and good birth, although the latter in itself
implies inheritance of rank and wealth. Personal qualities count for
what they are worth in addition. General recognition and consensus
of opinion settle the question of rank. That is to say, it is about what
the individual can make it by all the arts of assertion, bargain, intrigue,
wealth, display, and personal prowess.

Besides the principal chief, there are others, who are the heads of the
other principal clan totems or households of the village. Their rank
or claim to distinction and respect is relative to that of the chief in
the degree of their wealth, age, superiority of natural understanding,
the number of persons of which their household consists, and the gen-
eral good fortune and prosperity of the group of persons of which they

* Frazer, Totemism, p. 34.
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 251

are the recognized head. Indeed, each household is in itself a subor-
dinate government. The head of it, through heredity, wealth, ability,
or otherwise, simply is recognized as a petty chief in the village. The
head chief merely overshadows in the extent of his influence the petty
chiefs. Often reverses of fortune turn the tables, and some decline in
influence while others rise. Often the alliance of the medicine men
is gained by purchase or by the sacrifice of private property, and the
chiefs and shamans combine to uphold each other in the respect and fear
of the community. Many bitter feuds grow out of the rivalries of house-
holds and gentes in the struggle for power and influence in the tribe.
Often a man is strong enough, like Chief Skowl of Kasa-an, to crush out
all opposition, or even, like Chief Skiddaus,* to extend his influence
beyond his own village through the ownership of valuable lands, or
through the necessities of war, and have his suzerainty recognized
by the chiefs of other villages. In a strict sense, however, the village
is the tribal unit. Alliances of tribes have always been only temporary,
and no lasting federation has ever been formed. Simpson, who visited
Alaska in 1841, says, of the rivalries of Chiefs Shakes and Qualkay,
at Fort Wrangell (Stikine), ‘though Shakes was the principal chief,
yet he had comparatively little influence; while the second ruler in
the tribe (Qualkay) possessed a strong party in the village.”’t

A chief, as a rule, is not treated with any very marked deference on
ordinary occasions excepting by his own household, but in ceremonies
a degree of state was formerly kept up, to impress visitors or strangers
with the importance and high rank of thedignitary. In the ceremonies
-at the conclusion of peace between the Russians and Indians at Sitka
(1804), Lisiansky states that the Indian chief who acted as an ambassa-
dor was either borne by his slaves upon a mat-carpet or rug, or carried
on the shoulders of his attendants, as become his rank, and not due to
any infirmity of the chief, for in the ceremonial dances which followed
he took a prominent part.

In early days the chief traded for all his tribe or household, subject
however, to the approval of those present; but in recent years, with the
abolition of slavery and the influence of the whites, the authority of
the chiefs has been very much weakened. Instances are not rare
where medicine men or shamans have been head chiefs of villages.

Freemen.—Below the chiefs come the freemen, who are the ordinary
people of the tribe composing the different households. Above these in
one sense, or above the petty chiefs for that matter, come the shamans
or medicine men. This rank, however, is in no sense political. They
are simply a class whose functions are largely religious.

Slaves.—On our acquisition of the territory of Alaska in 1867 the |
practice of slavery received its death-blow amongst the Indians. Pre-

viously to that the Russian authorities had sought to ameliorate, 1n some
degree, the hardships of this wretched class in the vicinity of Sitka, but
it was still in practice when we took possession. The slave class has
now gradually been absorbed into the body of the freemen and slavery
is a thing of the past.

Formerly wealth consisted largely in the possession of slaves. Simp-
son estimates that in 1841 one-third of the entire population of this
region were slaves of the most helplesss and abiect description. .
Though some of them were prisoners of war and their descendants, yet
the great supply was obtained by trade with the southern Indians, in
which the Tsimshian acted as middlemen. They were kidnapped or
captured by the southern Indians from their own adjacent tribes and
sold to the Tsimshian, who traded them to the northern Tlingit and in-
terior Tinné tribes for furs. The last-named had no hereditary slaves,
getting their supply from the coast. Dunn states (1834) that at Port
Simpson, British Columbia, ‘ A full-grown athletic slave, who is a good
hunter, will fetch nine blankets, a gun, a quantity of powder and ball,
a couple of dressed elk skins, tobacco, vermilion paint, a flat file, and
other little articles.” *

Slaves did all the drudgery; fished for their owner; strengthened
his force in war; were not allowed to hold property or to marry;
and when old and worthless were killed. The master’s power was
unlimited. If ordered by him to murder an enemy or rival, his own life
paid the forfeit or penalty if le either refused or failed. The children
of slave women by the master were slaves. In certain ceremonies it
was customary to give several slaves their freedom ; but at funerals of
chiefs, or in ceremonies attending the erection of a house by a person
of consequence, slaves were killed. Slaves sacrificed at funerals were
ehosen long before the death of their master and were supposed to be
peculiarly fortunate, as their bodies attained the distinction of cremation,
instead of being thrown intothe sea. Simpson (1841) says of Chief Shakes
at Wrangell (Stikine), that he was ‘ said to be very cruel to his slaves,
whom he frequently sacrificed in pure wantonness, in order to Show how
great a man he was. On the recent occasion of a house-warming, he
exhibited as part of the festivities the butchery of five slaves; and at
another time, having struck a white man ina fit of drunkenness and re-
ceived a pair of black eyes for his pains, he ordered a slave to be shot,
by way at once of satifying his own wounded honor and apologizing
to the person whom he had assaulted. His rival (Qualkay), on the
contrary, was possessed of such kindness of heart, that on grand holi-
days he was more ready to emancipate his slaves than to destroy them ;
- yet, strange to say, many bondmen used to run away from Qualkay,
- while none attempted to escape from Shakes; an anomaly which, how-
ever, was easily explained, inasmuch as the one would pardon the
recaptured fugitives, and the other would torture and murder them.” +

*Dunn, Oregon, p. 273. + Simpson, Journey, Vol. 1, pp. 212, 219.
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. _ - 253

The practice of killing slaves in ceremonies and for reparation in
quarrels was quite common among the northern tribes, and numerous
instances might becited. At Howkan, in one of the Indian houses, may
be seen a couple of large wooden images each representing a wolf, with
human face and real human hair on the head. This was to remind
slaves that, if they escaped from their cwners, they would become
transformed into creatures like those depicted, half man, half wolf.

Poole (1863) says that the Haida, Chief Klue, informed him “that
some years previously his brother-in-law, in those days the greatest
chief on the coast, had been entrapped by the Fort Rupert Indians on
his way home from Victoria and scalped and killed, with all his males,
his females being divided as slaves among thevictors."* This example °
is cited to show that it was very questionable if the northern Indians
made very good slaves, being so warlike, and preferring, as they claim,
death to slavery. On the other hand, the southern tribes were more
docile, the Flatheads forming the principal part of the slave popula-
tion of the northern Indians. In case of the liberation of a slave, he
was adopted as a freeman into the clan to which his mother belonged
either by birth or as a slave.

Civil Government.—There are no stated periods for councils or delib-
erative gatherings. A household consultation or a meeting of the gens
or of the chiefs takes place under the spur of necessity. Women have
usually as much to say as the men on other than ceremonial occasions,
and their advice is frequently followed, particularly in affairs of trade.
In matters affecting one or more gentes or the village, representatives
of the various households or gentes meet more formally. They squat
around or sit cross-legged, delivering formal speeches in turn, which
are heard with rapt attention and approved of by grunts, murmurs,
and uplifting of hands. In cases such as witchcraft or offenses of
medicine men, sentence to death or to fine is adjudged by the leading
men of the village after trial. Under most circumstances, however,
the law of blood revenge, an “eye for an eye,” leaves little need for
otherthan family councils, as they are purely totemic offenses, and are
arranged by the injured gens.

INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION.

Division of Labor.—As between the sexes, the women attend mostly
to the common household duties, but the men have a fair share of the
outside work about the house and camp. A chief is usually more or
less waited onby his dependents. When slavery was in vogue, this class
performed all the menial drudgery. The liberated slaves still occupy
a somewhat dependent position. The men are the warriors and hunt-
ers, though an old woman of rank usually steers the war canoe. In
ordinary transit the women assist the men in paddling, and the owner

_ *Poole, Queen Charlotte Islands, yp. 235.
254 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 18388.

orthe mostexperienced person steers. Inthe season of hunting fur-bear-
ing animals, the women and children (and formerly slaves) take charge
of the camps—fishing, drying fish, and gathering and drying berries
for winter. Altogether the division of labor is upon equitable and
economic principles, and the women by no means do all the drudgery.
During the runs of salmon, herring, and eulachon, and in fact at all —
times during the summer season, special employ ment is dropped, and
all the natives alike engage in the work in hand. In addition to the
food supply, materials are collected to be worked up during the winter
months, by those specially skilled, into various useful and ornamental
objects. Different men and women acquire adeptness in different arts
and industries, and devote their leisure to their trade. Some of the
men are expert house-carpenters, canoe-builders, basket-makers, tan-
ners of hides, hewers of wood, metal workers, carv ers of wood, stone,
horn, bone, slate, manufacturers of metal implements, ornaments, house-
hold utensils, etc., and are regularly paid for. their services. This is
especially true of the wood-carvers, who make and paint the totemic and
mortuary columns. Others enjoy prestigeas successful hunters of certain
animals or expert fishermen. Some of the women are expert basket-
makers, carvers of household utensils, weavers of cloaks and mats of
cedar bark and wool, and makers of dance and ceremonial costumes.
Generally the men are carvers and the women weavers. Dunn (1834)
says of the Tsimshian, and it applies also to the Haida and Tlingit,
“ Every chief keeps an Indian on his establishment for making and re-
pairing canoes and making masks for his religious representations; this
man they call the carpenter. ” *

Portlock (1786) says of the Tlingit, “‘the women are the keepers of
their treasures.”+ In fact, as before stated, the women are practically
on an equality with the men in the industrial organization, and whether
her advice in ali matters is sought or not, she is quite apt to give it.
Cases of “hen-pecked” husbands are not rare.

Inheritance.—In this totemic organization some singular features
present themselves. Blood relationship is cut across in an arbitrary
way, giving rise to peculiar customs and laws. As before stated, first
cousins may marry, but totally unrelated persons in the same phratry
may not. Ina war between gentes or phratries, a groom, while cele-
brating his nuptials, may be called upon to fight his father-in-law on
account of some trivial feud.

Property is inherited by the brother of the deceased, a sister’s son, a
sister, or the mother, in the order named, in the absence of the preced-
ing. As a rule the wife gets nothing. She has her own dowry and
personal property. Whoever inherits the property of the deceased, if
a brother or sister’s son, must either take the widow to wife, or pay an
indemnity to her relatives in case of failure to do so. In case the heir
is ads married, the next in succession takes her; for instane the

eyen recon p. 291, “Wiponiser Voyages, p. 290,
4
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 255

brother may inherit the property and the nephew get the relict. In
case there is no male relative to marry her or in case an indemnity is
paid, the widow may marry any other man. Sometimes an adopted
child or the son adopted by a sister of the deceased may be the heir.
The heir of Chief Skowl of Kasa-an (Kaigani) was his sister’s son,
Sahattan, who is now chief of the village. Should a boy be killed hy
accident, the indemnity is paid, by a reversal of this rule, to his mother’s
brother, the boy’s uncle. Property inherited is taken possession of by
the heir as soon as the body is burned or enclosed in the burial box.
It becomes his duty within a year to give a great feast and erect a
mortuary column in honor of the deceased. This ceremony is called
glorifying or elevating the dead, and is one of the principal ones in this
region.

Lisiansky (1805) says of the Tlingit about Sitka:

The right of succession is from uncle to nephew [meaning sister’s son], the dignity
of chief to yon excepted, which passes to him who is the most powerful, or has the
greatest number of relations. Though the toyons have power over their subjects, it
is a very limited power, unless when an individual of extraordinary ability starts up,

who is sure to rule despotically, and, as elsewhere, to do much mischief. These toy-
ons are numerous; even in small settlements there are often four or five.*

SUMMARY.

The industrial organization is not different from the political, and
most of the laws and customs which control them in their actions are
founded on totemic laws, traditions, legends, folk-lore, and super-
stitions. For this reason the regulative organization, while not exactly
weak, is at least not well differentiated. The actual function or occu-
pation of the individual, both as a member of a household and of the
tribe, is partially developed, although there are no real craft classes.
Organization is based on kinship, and descent is in the female line.
Totemism cuts across blood relationship and its chief bearing is on
marriage. Most of the ceremonies have a bearing directly on totemism,
and have for their object the identification of the individual with his
totem.

MUTILATIONS.

The practice of mutilation is older than recorded history. Man never
has been satisfied with either his structure or appearance, and has con-
stantly endeavored to improve upon both. On the northwest coast the
mutilations are of the head and face, the practice of flattening or com-
pressing the head being, however, peculiar only to the southern tribes
of this region. Mackenzie, in his visit to the Bilqula, in 1793, described
their heads as ‘“ wedge-shaped.” This does not, however, obtain ameng
the Haida, Tsimshian, and Tlingit, but they pierce the ear and the sep-
tum of the nose, and in addition the women slit the lower lip.

Lip, nose, and ear ornaments.— While amongst the Eskimo the men
pierce the lip and wear the sleeve-button-shaped labrets of bone, shell,
ivory, or stone, amongst the northern Indians the women alone wear
the lip ornament. Between these two geographically are the Koniagas
and Aleut. With the Koniagas both sexes. pierce the septum of the
nose and the under lip and wear ornaments in them.

Beginning with the Yakutat* and running as far south as the Kwa-
kiutl,t we find the custom amongst the women of wearing a labret in
a Slit cut in the lower lip. It is symbolic of maturity, the incision first
being made either in childhood or else at puberty. In either case it is
done with some ceremony, which is described in Chapter x1. ~ A cop-
per wire or piece of shell or wood is intreduced into the fresh incision
to keep the wound open. The object inserted is gradually enlarged
until an artificial opening of some size is made. When maturity is
reached a block of wood is inserted. This is oval or elliptical in shape,
and amongst the Haida and Tsimshian quite elongated. With the
: Tlingit, on the other hand, it is almost circular in shape. In general
it is hollowed out on both sides, and grooved on the edge like the sheave

* Dall, Alaska, p. 428, and Bancroft, Vol. 1, Native Races, both state that the Ya-
kutat do not now wear the lip ornament. Dixon (1787), however, in Voyages, p. 172,
minutely describes the custom as then in vogue amongst them.

From a photograph in the U. S. National Museum.

Kitkun is here selected as a type of the Haida Indian. The rank which he held
in 1873 was that of a petty chief of the village, his brother, Chief Klue, being the
head chief. On the death of his brother, Kitkun became head chief of the village,
assuming the hereditary title, Chief Klue. The tattoo mark on the breast repre-
sents Kahatla, the cod-fish, and that on his arms Cheena, the salmon. The design
on his back is shown in Fig. 2, Plate V, and represents Wasko, a mythological
being of the wolf species.

of a pulley to keep it in place. Each succeeding year a larger and
larger lip-block is inserted, the effect being in old age to drag the lip
down, exposing the discolored and worn teeth, and forming altogether,
to the European, a disgusting spectacle, but to them a thing of beauty
and a token of rank, maturity, and social position. In running, it flops
up and down between the nose and chin in a very undignified manner.
Itis as embarrassing to an Indian woman to be seen without her labret as
for a European woman to be seen with uncovered bosom.* Female
slaves were invariably forbidden the privilege of wearing them. The
size of the labret measures the social importance and wealth of the
wearer. The custom is now dying out, but is still seen amongst the
older Haida women, the labrets being principally made of wood. Form-
erly it was the custom to ornament them with copper and inlay them
with haliotis shell by way of beautifying them. They varied in size
from 4 inches long by 3 broad down to small buttons to wear in the
first incision. Now that this custom is dying out, a form of it is seen
in the piercing of the lip with a small hole and the insertion of a silver
tube or bar (Plate x1).

Piercing the nose.—Both sexes pierce the septum of the nose and in-
' sert ornaments, originally of copper, bone, wood, or haliotis shell, but
now of silver, such as rings or bars or tufts of red woolen yarn, with
pendent shark’s teeth. The Tlingit wear a silver or bone ring through
the nose, aS seen in several accompanying plates, but formerly the cus-
tom cf wearing an ivory stick or pin obtained in some localities.

Piercing the ears.—Both sexes pierce the lobe of the ear and wear or-
naments as in thenose. Around the rim of the ear additional heles are
pierced. Men of rank have as many as five or six of these latter. For-
. erly, according to Dawson,{ “these held little ornaments formed of
plates of haliotis shell, backed with thin sheet copper or the small teeth
of the fin-whale.” This custom is also fast dying out. Amongst the
older men and women one still sees these practices, but in a modified
and less pronounced form.

- Tattooing.—This practice is found rarely among the Tlingit, if at all,
and only occasionally amongst the Tsimshian, although it crops out
here and there, in a very mild form, all along the coast. With the
Haida alone, of all the Indian stocks, tattooing is a fine art, and is com-
mon to both sexes. The figures are conventional representations of
their totems, pricked in charcoal, lignite, or black pigment, and serve to
identify the individual with his or her totem. The men have these de-
signs tattooed on their breasts, on their backs between their shoulders,
on the front part of their legs below the thighs, on the shins below the
knee, and on the back of the fore-arms. Occasionally the men also have
these designs on the cheek and back of the hands, although rarely seen

now.* The women tattoo the same as the men, excepting that the de-
signs on the upper part of the leg are said to be omitted. The designs
on their fore-arms invariably extend down over the back of the hands
and knuckles, and this alone serves to distinguish the Haida women
from those of other tribes on the coast. Plate rv shows the tattooing on
Kitkin, Chief of Laskeek, Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia.
Plate v shows the details of tattooing, which subject will be found more
thoroughly treated in a paper by Judge J. G. Swan, in the Fourth
Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, pp. 66-73. Fig. 2, Plate v,
is the design on back of Kitkun. Frequently the tattooing on the hands
represents finger-rings and bracelets. A Haida woman who had on her
person a figure of a halibut laid open, with the face of the chief of her
tribe shown on the tail, told Poole that it would protect her and her
kin from drowning at sea.t * * * Judge Swan says:

It should be borne in mind that, during these festivals and masquerade perform-
ances, the men are entirely naked, and the women have only a short skirt reaching
from the waist to the knee; the rest of their persons are exposed, and it is at such
times that the tattoo marks show with the best effect, and the rank and family connec-
tion are known by the variety of designs. Like all the other coast tribes, the Haidas
are careful not to permit the intrusion of white persons or strangers to their Tomana-
wos ceremonies, and as a consequence but few white people, and certainly none of
those who have ever written about these Indians, have been present at their opening
ceremonies when the tattoo marks are shown. * * * As this tattooing is a mark of
honor, it is generally done just prior to a Tomanawos performance, and at the time
of raising the heraldic columns in front of the chief’s houses. The tattooing is done
in open lodge and is witnessed by the company assembled.. Sometimes it takes sey-
eral years before all the tattooing is done, but when completed and the body is well
ornamented, then they are happy and can take their seats among the elders.

The design is carefully drawn in charcoal or lignite (ground in water)
on the body and then pricked in with needles. It takes some time to
finish a design, but once completed the status of the individual is fixed
for life.

Painting the body.—From the Yakutat, throughout the region south,
the custom obtains, on ceremonial occasions, of painting the face and
body a variety of colors, and daubing the hair with red, black, or brown
pigments. This custom is now becoming rare. On ceremonial occa-
sions of importance the white down of eagles or other birds is pow-
dered over the paint on the body and head, giving a polite coat of tar
and feathers. In war various hideous and grotesque patterns were
formerly adopted for the face, such as a circle of black with a red chin,
giving to the wearer the appearance of having on a mask. The colors
on the body are removed in lines by brushes or sticks in order to trace
the pattern of the totem of the wearer, similar to the tatooing on the
body. Amongst the Tlingit this in effect takes the place of tattooing ;

*Seen by the writer at Kasa-an village (Kaigani) 1885. The practice of tattooing
is dying out and only found among the older people.

sometimes the designs are laid over the other paint with charcoal.
Nowadays the paint is washed off after the ceremonies, but formerly
it was the custom throughout the coast for the rich to renew the
coat daily, while the poor would have to manage according to their
abilities. Vancouver thus describes the war paint of the Nass, with
whom he had a hostile encounter:

These had contrived so to dispose of the red, white, and black as to render the nat-
ural ugliness of their countenances more horribly hideous. This frightful appearance

did not seem to be a new fashion among them, but to have been long adopted by
their natural ferocious dispositions.*

Before the advent of looking-glasses the Indians made one another’s
toilets. A chief was served by his slaves or his wife. This custom
of adorning the body with paint served other than «esthetic purposes.
In war and ceremony it added to the effect on the observers; it identi-
fied the wearer with his totem, and finally served as a protection to
the body against mosquitoes and the weather, This last named is the
principal use to which the custom is now put, viz, of wearing a coat of
black paint on the face and hands. This must be distinguished from
the mourning paint made from charcoal. The other referred to is a
brownish-black paint, now commonly worn to prevent the burning of
the skin in hot weather from the glare of the sun on the water, and as
a protection against mosquitoes and sand-flies. This coat consists of a
soot, like burnt cork, made from a charred fungus, rubbed into the
skin with grease. This gradually turns black and is frequently re-
newed.

In general the paints used were charcoal, charred and roasted fun-
gus; white, red, and brown earths (ochres); lignite, vegetable juices ;
and powdered cinnabar.

Hair.—As mentioned, ochres and bird’s down are used for dressing
the hair for ceremonial occasions. Portlock says that among the Tlin-
git, this was only practiced by the men.t Ordinarily the hair is
worn short by the men, excepting the shaman, and long by the women,
who usually wear it done up in two plaits down the back, but sometimes
in one plait, or ‘‘clubbed” behind and bound with red cloth. The ear-
lier custom was somewhat different, according to Portlock (1787), who
says: ‘“‘The women wear their hair either clubbed behind or tied up in
a bunch on the crown of the head; the men wear theirs either loose or
tied at the crown.”

The hair is dressed with combs of a somewhat conventional pattern,
as illustrated in Figs. 11¢ and 11d, which are from two specimens in the
Emmons Collection in the Museum of Natural History, New York.
Figure 11¢ is made from a small, thin piece of bone, while 11d is carved

ORNAMENTS.

With the practice of mutilations comes the adornment of the person
with ornaments fashioned from a great variety of materials. It seems
that, not content with the facilities offered naturally for securing these
to the person, mutilations were often practiced solely to enable the
wearer to attach ornaments to the ear, lip, nose, or cheek.

Labrets or lip ornaments.—These are made of stone, wood, bone, shell,
ivory, silver or copper, sometimes of one material only, sometimes of a
combination of several. In form they vary from a pulley-shaped disc
to a collar button, and in size from 4 inches to a small cylinder of
one-eighth inch in diameter. The labret shown in Plates xLix and

L in the figure of the “‘ Bear Mother” is a good illustration of the size
and appearance of this appendage as worn up to recent, years.

Nose ornaments.—lig. 13, Plate v1, is the general type of silver nose-
rings in use around Dixon Entrance. It is often worn in this same
shape made of bone. Another favorite ornament both for the nose and
ear is the sbark’s tooth, as shown in Fig. 20, Plate vu. As such it is
usually attached to the hole in the nose or lobe of the ear by a yarn of
‘red worsted. Sometimes the red worsted is alone worn; sometimes a
piece of bone triangular in shape replaces the shark’s tooth which it is
meant to imitate. A bone or ivory stick or cylinder was formerly worn.
Fig. 17, Plate VIl, is an illustration of a primitive bone nose ornament
of a different type from any of these mentioned.

Har ornamenis.—Figs. 12 and 14 represent the common types of sil-
ver ear-rings now worn in the northern region around Dixon Entrance.
As- mentioned above, sharks’ teeth and red worsted are favorite ear
ornaments. These are illustrated in Figs. 20, 21, and 23, Plate vit.
Fig. 12a is a Tlingit ear ornament of ivory from the Emmons Collection
in the Museum of Natural History, New York. In its ornamentation
and design it shows the effects of intercourse with the Aleut and
Koniagas to the north. Fig. 12) is a pin or peg of ivory or bone of a
type sometimes worn by the Tlingit and Haida.

Hair ornaments.—Fig. 11a, Plate v1, is an iron
hair-pin from Fort Wrangell, Alaska (Tlingit.) It
is inlaid with haliotis and highly polished. Fig.
11, Plate v1, is an iron “tchene”
highly polished and inlaid with
haliotis shell. Itis worn by young
girls as an ornament in the hair.
This specimen is from the Nass
Indians (Tsimshian), but they are
also found amongst the Tlingit
and Haida, and were formerly
valued at from one to two slaves.
Red is the favorite color for cloth

further ornamented with a square

piece of abalone shell pendent. This specimen is from Mas sset, British
Columbia (Haida), as is also that shown in Fig.9, Plate v1, w hide is made
of twisted copper wire and is of a very primitive type. Fig. 10 is the
same kind as that shown in Fig. 9, but it has been oxidized by the heat
and looks somewhat like iron wire instead of copper.
262 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Finger-rings.—These were formerly made entirely of copper, bone,
shell, or black slate, and were ornamented with totemic designs. Now
silver has so generally displaced all other materials that the primitive
types are rarely seen.

Bracelets.—Fig. 5, Plate VI, is a pair of copper bracelets from Bella
Bella, British Columbia, (Kwakiutl) similar to those worn north. Fig.
6 represents a pair from Fort Wrangell, Alaska, also of copper, in-
laid with haliotis shell. Fig. 7 is one similar in style to that shown in
Fig. 6, from Fort Simpson, British Columbia (Tsimshian), Fig. 8 rep-
resents a very primitive type of copper bracelet of twisted copper wire,
from Fort Rupert, British Columbia (Kwakiutl), but similar to those
worn north. Fig. 16) is a Tlingit iron bracelet of native workman-
ship, from the Emmons Collection. Plate v111
represents the types of silver bracelets worn
on the northwest coast at the present day.
They are made from silver coin, and have re-
placed those of bone, horn, copper, shell, and
iron formerly worn. Fig. 24 represents the
coin hammered out into a flat strip of the re-
quired width with ends rounded into shape.

Fig. 16d.

Baca ey Fig. 25 represents the same bent nearly into
(Tlingit. Emmons Collection. ) shape by gentle hammering.

In its flat shape the silver has little or no elasticity or spring, so the
next step is to round the bracelet out on the inside, as shown in cross-
section, Fig. 26. This is done by means of a hammer and a blunt cold
chisel. In the process of hammering the bracelet curls up more and
more, and is beaten out thinner and broader. This economizes silver,
and gives elasticity and clasp to the bracelet. The next step is to carve
the design on it as shown in the finished bracelet, Fig. 27. On this
width totemic designs are seldom carved, scroll work being used. The
tools are of the most primitive kind, consisting of a hammer, blunt cold-
chisels, and a sharp steel carving or etching tool. Figs. 28 and 30
represent a style of clasp somewhat in vogue, but Figs. 27 and 29 are
the prevailing patterns. On the larger bracelets the totemic design of
the wearer is usually carved. Fig. 31 represents the design on Fig. 29
rolled out, and Fig. 32 the same for Fig. 30. The former design repre-
sents the Bear, and the latter the Thunder Bird. Figs. 27, 28, and 29
are Tlingit, Fig. 30 Haida, but the same types are found amongst all
the northern tribes; the Haida being the most expert silversmiths, as
they are also in general the best carvers on the coast.

Dixon (1787) states that the Tlingit and Haida wore large circular
wreaths of copper about the neck, evidently of native manufacture.
With the introduction of iron by Europeans bracelets of iron wire some-
what took the place of the more expensive copper ones, to be in turn
later succeeded by those of silver. The present custom is to wear

bracelets and ear, nose, and finger rings of silver. The natives prefer
silver to gold. Their fondness for red worsted as ear ornaments has also
been alluded to, and is well illustrated in Plate VII.

DRESS.

Primitive clothing.— What early attracted the traders to this region
was the character of the clothing worn by the natives, consisting of
valuable furs roughly sewn together, seal and sea-otter being the most
common and the most sought after. The costume of the men was
scanty, consisting of an under coat, a cloak, and sometimes a breech
clout, although the last named seemed to be a very unimportant and
often omitted article of dress. Dixon (1787) describes their clothing as
‘‘made of such skins as fancy suggests, or their success in hunting fur-
nished them with, and sometimes loose cloaks thrown over the shoulders
and tied with small leather strings. * * * The dress of the women
differs in some respects from that of the men. Their undergarment is
made of fine tanned leather, and covers the body from the neck to the
ankle, being tied in different parts to make it fit close. * * * The
upper garment is made in much the same manner as the men’s coats,
and generally of tanned leather, the women not caring to wear furs.
* * * Over this is tied a piece of tanned leather like an apron, and
which reaches no higher than the waist.”*

In other words, both sexes wore a cloak and an under garment or coat
reaching to the waist. To this the men added a belt or breech piece,
and the women a skirt or gown reaching to the calf or ankle. Both
sexes went barefooted, although wearing, as now, in very cold weather,
a kind of moccasin.

Sea-otter skins were a staple article of trade amongst the Indians
themselves, and were stored in large quantities, being the basis of
wealth and the unit of value. The eagerness of Europeans to trade for
them led to the exhaustion of the stock on hand, the sacrifice of their
clothing, the practical extinction of the sea-otter, the
adoption by the Indians of European clothing, and sub-
stitution of other standards of value and wealth. Gar-
ments of fur are still worn in cold weather, the skins of
the less valuable animals, such as the rabbit, squirrel,
and goat being used. These skins are fastened together
with cords of twisted linen or finely spun vegetable 4
fibre. Figs. 21a and 21) represent two varieties of bone Figs. 21a, 210.

Ceremonial blanket—These northern Indians, particularly the Chil-
kat tribes (Tlingit), have possessed from time immemorial the art of
weaving twisted bark thread and the wool of the mountain goat into
blankets. These they value most highly, and persons of rank and

264 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

wealth wear them only on extraordinary occasions. They are com-
monly called Chilkat blankets, and form heir-looms in every wealthy
family. One of these is pictured in Plate x, Fig. 33. To-day they are
worth from $25 to $40 each. Dawson states that the Haida obtain
them from the Tsimshian. The warp consists of twine of finely
shredded cedar bark spun into a thread or cord. The woof is of yarn
spun from the wool of the mountain goat. (The details of the weaving
are shown in Plate x, Fig. 33a.) Much confusion exists on this point.
The mountain goat resembles our domestic animal in external appear-
ance, but has beneath the hair an inner coat of white, soft, silky
wool, while the mountain sheep (big-horn) has a thick covering of hair
like a deer. The fringe on the side is shorter than on the bottom. The
wool is woven into a pattern representing the totem of the owner, dif-

ferent dyes being used in the wool, the conventional colors being black, -

yellow, white, and sometimes brown. The black is obtained from char-
coal and the yellow dye froma moss called sekhone (Tlingit). The
blanket is woven in different designs skilfully blended into a complete
pattern, as in tapestry, Fig. 33. A ceremonial coat or gown similar
in design is also woven in this way. A specimen is figured in Plate x,
Fig. 34. The details of the method of weaving both these garments
are shown in Fig. 33a, same plate.

Chief’s ceremonial head dress.—In connection with this blanket and
coat or gown, a conventional head dress is worn by the chiefs in this
northern region. These are shownin Plate x, Fig. 35, and consist of a
cylindrical wooden frame about 10 inches high, with an elaborately carved
front of hard wood, beautifully polished, painted, and inlaid with aba-
lone shell and copper. Pendent behind is a long cloth, on which are
closely sewn the skins of ermine, which form an important item in a
chief’s outfit. Around the upper periphery of the head-dress is an
elaborate fringe of seal-whiskers. In ceremonial dances the space within
this fringe and the top of the head-dress is filled with eagle or other
bird’s down, which falls like snow in the motions of the dance. This
costume is_completed by leggins of deer’s hide, ornamented with the
beaks of puffins, which rattle with the movements of the wearer.
These are shown in Fig. 36, Plate x. The costume complete as worn
by a chief is figured in Plate Ix.

Amongst northern tribes these ceremonial blankets are worn by the
chiefs. Amongst the Haida, women of rank also wear them in the
dances. In all its details, the costume shown in Plate 1x well illus-
trates the height to which the native arts of weaving, inlaying, carving,
and dyeing had risen on this coast before being influenced by the ad-
vent of the whites.

The dress of a Chilkat chief, encountered by Vancouver at Lynn
Canal in 1794 is thus described by him:

His external robe was a very fine large garment that reached from his neck down
to his heels, made of wool from the mountain sheep, neatly variegated with several

The details of this costume are shown in Plate X. In the top of the head-dress,
within the fringe formed by the seal whiskers, aquatic birds’ or eagles’ down is gen-
erally placed, which, in the ceremonial dances, falls and floats in the air about the
wearer like snow on a winter’s day, adding much tothe picturesqueness of the scene.

Fig, 33. CEREMONIAL BLANKET. Worn by Indians of rank and wealth on the North-

west coast, commonly called a ‘‘ Chilkat blanket,” because the best
specimens come from the Chilkat country, although other tribes are
more or less expert in weaving them. The warp is composed of twisted
cord or twine of cedar bark fiber, and the woof of worsted spun from the
wool of the mountain goat. Brown, yellow, black, and white are the
colors used, and these are skillfully wrought into a pattern representing
the totem or a totemic legend of the owner. The details of the weaving
are shown in Fig. 33a. The design on both the blanket and the cere-
monial shirt represents Hoorts, the bear.

ming on the collar and cuffs is sea-otter fur.

. CHIEF'S CEREMONIAL HEAD-DREss. Carved from hard wood, beautifully

inlaid, painted, and polished. The erect fringe on the upper circumfer-
ence is formed by seal whiskers set into the frame. The pendent trail
is made from three lengths of ermine skins, there being about ten skins
in each row. The top of the head-dress is filled with birds’ down on
ceremonial occasions, and in the motion of the dances this sifts through
and falls like snow about the person of the dancer.

. BUCKSKIN LEGGINGS. With three rows of puffin beaks, which rattle with

the motion of the wearer. This style of legging is also made from ordi-
nary cloth, or from the woven blanket stuff, similar to Fig. 33.

colors, and edged and otherwise decorated with little tufts or frogs of woolen yarns
dyed of various colors. His head-dress was made of wood, much resembling in its
shape a crown, adorned with bright copper and brass plates, from whence hung a
number of tails or streamers, composed of wool and fur wrought together, dyed of
various colors, and each terminating by a whole ermine skin.*

Another variety of this blanket is described by Lisiansky (1805), as
seen by him near Sitka:

These blankets are embroidered with square figures, and fringed with black and
yellow tassels. Some of them areso curiously worked on one side with fur ot the sea-
otter, that they appear as if lined with it, and are very handsome.t

This is not unlike a blanket described by Vancouver, as worn by the
Kwakiutl, Johnstone Strait, British Columbia (latitude 52° 20’ N.), as
follows:

The clothing of the natives here was either skins of the sea-otter or garments made
from the pine bark. Some of these latter have the fur of the sea-otter very neatly
wrought into them, and have a border to the sides and bottom decorated with various
colors. In this only they use woolen yarn, very fine, well spun, and dyed for that
purpose, particularly with a very lively and beautiful yellow.t

The art of weaving.—These fine bark garments are found also amongst
the Tsimshian, who either made them or traded for them with the Kwa-
kuitl, giving in exchange sea-otter skins.§ In general, while the art of
cedar bark weaving was understood throughout the coast, and while
the southern Indians had some knowledge of weaving in wool, it may
be said that the northern Indians were more expert in weaving wooi and
making baskets of grass, and the southern Indians in weaving bark
fibre. To-day, at the two extremes, we find the northern Tlingit tribes,
and the Makah Indians of Cape Flattery, the expert basket makers,
but the character of their work is so different that it can be readily dis-
tinguished. The southern tribes are also the expert cedar bark weavers,
and the northern Tlingit the best weavers of wool. Wherever these or
other arts may have been developed, it is amongst the Haida of the
Queen Charlotte Islands that we find the best specimens of workman-
Ship. Originally the wealthiest stock on the coast, they have from
earliest times been remarkable for their readiness to adopt the customs
and ideas of others, and to develop and adapt them to their own pecu-
liar needs. The Tsimshian seem to have acted as the middlemen, for
most of the trade and intercourse of the Haida with the other tribes has
‘been through them. In this way it will be found that the Tsimshian
have influenced the Haida not a little in the development of their pecu-
liar customs and ideas. :

Modern dress.—The change in ordinary dress, as the Indians became
stripped of sea-otter and seal skins, consisted largely in the substitution

266 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

of cloth for garments and European blankets for fur cloaks. Langs-
dorff says of the Tlingit in 1806: _

The clothing of these people is very simple, consisting of a covering around the
waist, and an outer garment made of a piece of cloth or skin about 5 feet square, two
ends of which are either tied round the neck or fastened together with a button and
button-hole.*

The favorite colors were red and blue, but this costume was only worn
about the villages. Out hunting and fishing they practically wené
naked. Later, when the European blanket replaced the cloth cloaks,
they were ornamented with a border of red or blue cloth, on which was
sewn rows of pearl buttons, thimbles, Chinese coins, etc. This style of
blanket obtains to-day. (See Piate x1.) Plate xi represents the
modern costume of the Tlingit. The ear pendents of the man are
shark’s teeth. The labret of the woman is bone or silver, and illustrates
the transition stage from the large labret to none at all, or almost none.

The early voyagers were astonished at the demand for thimbles on the
coast, and supposed the women to need them for sewing. It was found,
however, that the use of the needle was very little understood,t and
that the thimbles were regarded as rare ornaments for blankets and
clothing. Formerly abalone and dentalium were looked upon as the
most valuable kind of trimmings and ornaments, but their importation
in quantities by Europeans cheapened their value. The Chinese coins
were admired for the cabalistic characters on them.

The women early adopted European dress, supplemented with the
ordinary blanket. The present costume, with headkerchief of black silk,
is seen in Plate x1. The earlier costumes, however, were ornamented
more elaborately. On the dress were tightly-fitting stays of cloth, often
of scarlet color, ornamented with pearl buttons. These, with silver or
bone nose-rings, bracelets on the arms, braids of silk or red worsted in
the ears, and European blankets across the shoulders, made up the
costume of the Indian women around Dixon Entrance up to more recent
years, since when plain ‘‘ store clothes” have displaced the former more
gaudy vestments. To complete the former costume, it should be added
that the hair worn long, was usually parted in front and bound elub-
shaped behind with scarlet cloth. At present the hair is usually worn
in two plaits down the back. Both sexes as a rule go barefooted, but
before the introduction of European shoes moccasins of one or two thick-
nesses of deer or elk hide were worn in cold weather. The older Indians
still wear them in out-of-the-way localities. These they either make
themselves or trade for with the Tinné tribes of the interior.

Head-covering.—Both sexes, until recent years, either went bare-
headed, or wore hats woven of grass and painted with the totem of the
owner. In ceremonies, of course, various styles of ceremonial head-
dresses are and were formerly worn; and in war costume, heavy wooden
helmets protected the head. At present, all styles of European hats

MODERN TLINGIT MALE AND FEMALE COSTUMES.

The costume of the man is more or less ceremonial, as the native dress has re-
cently been generally abandoned and European clothes adopted. The dress of the
women is that now generally worn by all the northern Indian women. The plate
represents the costume of ten or twenty years ago, and in this sense is modern. The
labret, a small cylinder of silver with a broad head, is the modern style of lip-orna-
ment, differing materially trom the large ones worn until a few years ago.

and caps are worn, but the women use generally only a black silk hand-
kerchief. The grass hats are still seen on the coast in out-of-the-way
places, particularly around Dixon Entrance. These are cone-shaped,
with considerable spread, being particularly adapted for protection, in
rainy weather, to the elaborately dressed hair worn on ceremonial occa-
sions. In the north, the truncated cone-shaped form is surmounted by
a more or less tall cylinder, in the ceremonial hats reaching an absurd
height; in the south, it becomes more parasol-like in shape, although
both styles are found throughout the whole coast, excepting that the very
tall ceremonial hat is limited to the north. Plate x11 illustrates the
varieties. Fig. 37 is the usual type, ornamented with the totemic device
representing the Raven, painted on the hat in red and black, the detail
being shown in Fig. 37d, which is a top view of Fig. 37. The details
of the weaving or twining are illustrated in enlarged section in Figs. 37)
and 37c. The hat naturally divides itself into two sections—the
crown and the rim—the dividing line being at a in Fig. 37. The method
of making the crown is the same as that used in the Haida basketry,
and shown in 37), while the rim is woven by a variation in the above
method shown in Fig.37c. These figures are from an article by Professor
O. T. Mason on Basket Work, in Smithsonian Report, 1884, Part 11. Of
Fig. 37c¢ he says: “It shows the regular method of twined weaving, the
introduction of the skip-stitch or twilled weaving into the greatest
variety of geometric patterns, and the ingenious method of fastening
off by a four-ply braid showing only on the outer side.” At the divid-
ing line, marked a, on the inside, a cylindrical head-band of spruce root
is stitched to make the hat fit the head, a string passing under the chin
being usually added. Fig. 38 is an ordinary type of spruce root hat
also found on the coast. Amongst the southern Indians, where cedar
bark is so much used, these two styles of hat are reproduced in that
material, which, not being tough enough to twine, is woven, as shown
in detail in Fig. 38e. This is the same pattern as their mats. The hats
thus made are light and flimsy and soon lose their shape, whereas the
twined spruce root ones and the baskets both retain their shape and be-
come water-tight after a preliminary soaking. Fig. 39is another varia-
tion in the shapes found on the coast. Itis often painted in solid colors
and ornamented on top with a totemic design. Fig. 40 is a ceremonial
head-dress, similar in design and outline to the wooden helmets illus-
trated in Plate x11. This shape is seen in the carvings in the large
totemic columns, and is doubtless an imitation of the wooden helmets
formerly worn in battle. These survivals and imitations are spoken of
elsewhere. The animal represented in Fig. 40 is the Raven.

Rain Cloaks.—Along the whole coast a peculiar form of cloak was
worn in rainy weather to shed water. Dixon (1787) says of them, as
seen at Sitka: “TI had no opportunity of examining them minutely, but
they appear to be made of reeds, sewed very closely together, and I
was told by one of our gentlemen who was with Captain Cook during
268 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

his last voyage that they were exactly the same with these worn by the
inhabitants of New Zealand.”* Mackenzie mentions this rain dress
amongst the Bilqula (1793).t These mats or cloaks were circular in
form, with an opening in the center for the head.

Ceremonial Paraphernalia.-—The origin of the custom of wearing cere.
monial masks and head-dresses, in this region, would seem to have
originated in the actual wearing of them in war. Much of the cere-
monial display amongst these Indians has reference to prowess in com-
bat, and it is an undoubted fact that, in the survival of many primitive
implements of war we have the origin of much of the dance and cere-
monial paraphernalia peculiar to this region.

With the desire to protect the body, armor naturally originated. The
masks and visors worn were painted in all the hideous colors and pat-
terns adopted ordinarily for the face. They were sometimes carved
with representations of the totem of the owner, but were intended in
any case both to protect the wearer and to strike terror to the enemy.
Vancouver (1793) mentions an encounter with the Tlingit, up Behm
Canal, Alaska, in which the chief put on a mask consisting of a ‘* Wolf’s
face compounded with the human countenance.” The masks were often
worn without head pieces or visors, and some of them were so thick that
a musket ball fired at a moderate distance could hardly penetrate them.t

There seems nothing unreasonable in tracing the origin of much of
the dance and ceremonial paraphernalia to customs originating in war.
Most of our secret and benevolent societies which parade in public have
a military organization and uniform. The grass hat shown in Fig. 40,
Plate xu, is in imitation of the wooden war helmet, and other sur-
vivais will be pointed out from time to time.

Armor.—Formerly the body was protected in combat by various de-
vices, the simplest being a leather garment, jerkin, or doublet. This
was usually made of one, two, or three thicknesses of hide and in itself
offered considerable resistance to arrows, Spears, or dagger thrusts, but
was still further re-inforced by a cuirass or coat of wood, made of
strips or slats, worn either over or under the doublet, but usually over.
These are illustrated in Plate xv, Figs. 52 and 53. The doublet or
shirt has an opening for the neck and one for the left arm; the right
side is not sewed up, faciliting the putting on of the garment and be-
ing secured by ties or toggles and straps. ‘There aretwo other admir-
able specimens in the National Museum (Nos. 46465 and 60240), but
as they are similar in patterns to the one illustrated in Plate xv
they are not reproduced here. They differ only in having shoulder
_ pads of hide secured on by toggles and straps and in offering some
protection to the arms. Vancouver (1793) thus describes a similar
shirt worn by a war party of Nass, which his boat parties encountered :

Their war garments were formed of two, three, or more folds, of the strongest hides
of the land animals they are able to procure. In the center was a hole sufficient to

admit the head and left arm to pass through, the mode of wearing them being over
the right shoulder and under the left arm.

The left side of the garment is sewed up, but the right side remains open; the
body is, however, tolerably well protected, and both arms are left at liberty for action.
As a further security on the part which covers the breast they sometimes fix on the
inside thin laths of wood.*

DETAIL OF WEAVING ARMOR.
(Cat. No. 49213, U.S.N. M. Tlingit. Collected by J. J. McLean.)

Fig. 53 is a rear view of a wooden cuirass or body armor from
Sitka, showing method of strapping it to the body. It is from a
specimen in the National Museum (No. 49213) consisting of numerous
(seventy-four) rods of hard wood about 2 feet long, woven together with
dark and white twine in alternate bands. The threads are sometimes
single and sometimes in pairs, and are made to pass over and under the
rods in pairs, but in such manner that the overlappings alternate from
one row to the next. This is shown in detail in Fig. 46, where la and
1b represent the parts of one cord, and 2a and 2b represent those of
another. The view represents the upper left hand corner of the weav-
ing and two upper threads, showing seven rods in both plan and sec-
tion. As stated, this method of running the cords or twine is varied by
ogeasionally running them in pairs. Fig. 43, Plate x1II, is a front
view of the same specimen of armor. Fig. 49, Plate xiv, represents
another variety of body armor in which the wood is in the shape of
laths or broader flat strips of wood, also woven together with twine.
Strips of hide were sometimes used to secure the strips of wood to-
gether; and sometimes the breast piece or covering was in one solid
thick piece. The armor shown in Plate xiv is from a sketch in
Lisiansky’s Voyage, p. 150, Plater. The method of wearing it is shown

*Vancouver, Voyage, Vol. 11, p. 339.
270 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

in Fig. 51, Plate xiv, which also shows the mask and helmet in place.
The parts are very heavy and clumsy, and the most that can be said in
their favor is that they protected the vital parts from injury.

With the introduction of iron and of fire-arms the Tlingit adopted
a new form of protection, consisting of a buckskin strip around the
neck, with iron plates attached pendant down the breast.*

Helmets and head-dresses.—The chief’s ceremonial head-dress has
already been described, and is illustrated in Fig. 35, Plate x. In Plate
XIII a variety of helmets is shown. Fig. 41 represents a wolf's head,
the wearer or owner belonging to the Wolf totem. It is so light that it
could not have served as a protection of any kind, and hence is cer-
emonial in its nature. Fig. 42 is a thick massive helmet similar to the
one illustrated in Plate xiv, Fig. 47. Fig. 44 represents the Bear
totem, while Fig. 45 is carved in representation of the Beaver. On the
rim of the latter four copper plates or shields are painted. These two
helmets (Figs. 44 and 45) are similar in shape to the grass hat shown
in Fig. 40, being that of an oblique truncated cone surmounted by a tall
cylinder, and evidently represent the ancient form of helmet worn by
the chiefs as seen in the carved columns and other old-time pictographs.
They are now worn only in the ceremonial dances, the two illustrated
being of light cedar wood and of rather recent make. Another variety
of head dress is a ring of shredded cedar bark, twisted into a rope,
stained dull red with the juice of the bark of the alder, and made into
a circular grommet like a crown Plate xvill. Some of these are orna-
mented with bows, rosettes, and tassels of the same material, the finest
and most elaborate being found amongst the Haida, although clearly
borrowed or copied in design from those of the Tsimshian and Kwakiutl.
With the latter these are only worn in the winter religious ceremonies,
and their use is considered improper on any other occasions, whereas
the Haida wear them in any of their dances without the peculiar signi-
ficance attached to them by other tribes.

Masks.— What has been said in a general way of helmets and head-
dresses is equally true of masks, with the addition that the latter are
found even in much greater variety and more ingenuity is displayed in
constructing them. The writer has endeavored to trace the origin of the
custom of wearing masks in ceremonies to the original practice of wear-
ing them in war asa protection. In this view, the simplest form is
that shown in Figs. 48 and 50, Plate xiv, the former being a side and
the latter a top view. The top rim is thinner than the lower part, and
has several grooves or peep-holes cut in it to enable the wearer to see
through, as shown in the plate. The front is carved or painted with
the totemic representation of the owner. Fig. 50 shows a projection
on the inner side (front), which consists of a leather becket or eyelet,
covered with a wrapping of grass or cedar bark, and let through the
front of the mask, being secured by a knot outside. This goes in the

mouth of the wearer, and is firmly gripped in the teeth to hold the
mask in place. Above this becket the mask is recessed or hollowed
slightly, to give a clearance to the nose of the wearer. Altogether it
may be seen to be a very clumsy method of protecting the face. Other
kinds of masks were worn to protect the face in war, having the addi-
tional objects of representing in their carved outlines the totem of the
wearer, or, by their hideousness and grotesqueness, of striking terror to
the enemy by lending to the effect of their menacing gestures the ap-
pearance of some superhuman being. Often these masks were so mas-
sive as to be worn without helmets or head pieces. Straps or thongs
of leather fasten them to the head, or a loop of cedar bark cord in the
hollow side of the mask is held in the teeth.

The ceremonial masks are carved from spruce or yellow cedar and
are generally very elaborate, being highly colored in grotesque or hide-
ous designs, and often inlaid with abalone shell or copper. The eyes
are pierced through to enable the wearer to see about him, and the
mouth is also usually cut through, or, if not, teeth are carved or inlaid
in bone. Lips, teeth, nostrils, and eyelids are sometimes represented
in copper. The top of the mask is usually bordered either with hair,
feathers, or down. By means of ingeniously concealed mechanism
the eyes are sometimes made to roll and the jaws and beak to snap.
(See Fig. 60, Plate xvi). Some of them, representing ravens and
cranes, have beaks projecting from two to four or five feet. In con-
junction with the masks are often worn wooden fins or wings on the
back of the head or on the back at the shoulders. ‘Fig. 59, Plate Xv1,
represents the raven as a ceremonial mask with lips of copper, sur-
mounted by a tall fin of wood representing the fin of the orca or killer.
This is fringed with human hair, and the figure carries in its mouth a
bow and arrow of copper. Fig.56 represents a woman’s face, with
nose and lip ornaments of conventional pattern, and with curiously
painted lines in unsymmetrical design. A variety of masks are
sketched in the foreground of Plate Lxvil. The custom of wearing
wooden masks and head-dresses in ceremonies and dances is found
throughout the whole northwest coast from the Aleuts to Puget Sound.
There is a large coilection of these in the National Museum, which in
themselves are worthy of separate illustration. The limits of this
paper admit only of presenting the few shown in Plates xvi and LXVII.

Ceremonial Batons, Wands, etc.—In Plates xVI and XVII are repre-.
sented various ceremonial implements carried in the hands of the
chiefs and shamans on state occasions, and permitted to be carried only
by men of such rank. Fig. 54 is a carved representation of a bow, the
figures on the ends representing the whale. Itis carried by the Haida
shamans in their medicine dances. Fig. 58 is a ceremonial bow carried
by a Haida chief. The two carved heads represent the bear. Carved
ceremonial arrows go with this type of bow, and in them we see the
survival of the ancient weapon as a purely ceremonial emblem, just as
272 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

to-day we have the court sword as a survival of the sword or rapier
carried by gentlemen of other periods. In the same way, Fig. 63 is a
Tlingit ceremonial dance wand in the shape of a dagger; and Fig. 64 is
a Haida baton (called by them Taskear), in the shape of a war lance of
earlier days. Fig. 55 is a fragment of an ancient Haida baton (Taski
or Taskear,) the lower part being missing. The top figure of the carving
represents the raven, below that the crow, and then the whale. Be-
tween the whale and the next lower figure, which is Skamson, the spar-
row-hawk, is a spindle and socket, which pull apart. The sparrow-hawk
rests on Stillik, the ceremonial hat, which in turn rests on Tsing, the
beaver. ‘This baton is carried in the hand by the chief on the occasion
of a great potlatch or feast. At a given signal the two parts are sepa-
rated and the distribution of presents begins, the chief retaining one
partin each hand. Fig. 57 is a carved cane or wand from Vancouver
Island, British Columbia, inlaid with pearl shell, and is the finest spe-
cimen of native carving from the southern Indians in the Museum.
Figs. 61, 62, and 65 are types of the Haida chiefs’ batons or Taskears ;
they are held in the hand on occasions of ceremony. Ata potlatch the
chief calls the name of the recipient of a present, and then thumps on
the floor if the gift is satisfactory to the guests, as explained later on.
In the totemic theatrical exhibitions these batons indicate the totem
and rank of the bearer. When a chief dies and is laid out in state the
baton stands near his body. In Fig. 61 the top figure is a chief wear-
ing a ceremonial hat, or Skillik, similar to the grass hat in Fig. 40. The
lower carved figure is the frog. In Fig. 65 the upper figure is Koot, the
eagle, and the lower Tsing, the beaver.

Rattles, Snappers, and Whistles.—In dealing with ceremonial parapher-
nalia it might be well to describe here all the accessories of ceremo-
nial costumes, such as the accompanying rattles, snappers, drums,
whistles, etc. These, however, are reserved for Chapter VII, where
they are dealt with as musical instruments.

Ceremonial Blankets—In connection with Plates Ix and X, a very
well-known type of chief's ceremonial costume has been described in this
chapter. The Chilkat and cedar-bark blankets are important factors in
. all ceremonial dances and functions. Otherforms of ceremonial blankets
or mantles are made from Hudson Bay Company blankets, with totemic
figures worked on them in a variety of ways. The usual method is to
cut out the totemic figure in red cloth and sew it on to the garment (or-
namenting it with borders of beads and buttons) by the method known
as appliqué work; another method is to sew pieces of bright abalone
or pearl shell or pearl buttons on to the garment in the totemic patterns.
Plate x1x well illustrates the appliqué method. Fig. 74, Plate XIx, is
a vestment which hangs pendant down the back, representing the
totem or crest of the wearer. Fig. 75 represents a cloak with a neck
opening ornamented in red cloth with the totemic¢ design of the Orea
or killer.

ant beaks of the puffin, shown in the detail of the same figure. Other
kinds are cut out in the pattern or outline of some totemic animal and
either painted in design or worked on in colored cloth by the appliqué
method.’ They are secured to the leg by straps of cloth or buckskin
and are usually worn in conjunction with moccasins or the bare feet.

Slave-killers.—These are ceremonial implements formerly used by
the chiefs in dispatching the slaves selected as victims of sacrifice on
occasions of building a house, or on the death of a chief or other impor-
tant personage, as described in Chapter xu. Some varieties of these
instruments are illustrated in Plate xtvr. The pointed ends were
driven by a quick blow into the skull of the victim, whose body was
accorded special consideration in burial. They seem in general to have
been made of bone, or of wood tipped with stone. Naturally, with the
advent of the whites, this custom has had to be abandoned, and these
implements have, in time, become very rare.

FOOD; IMPLEMENTS AND WEAPONS; HUNTING AND FISHING.
FOOD: ITS PREPARATION AND HOW OBTAINED.

Food.—Fish and berries form the staff of life amongst the Indians of
this region. Around the summer camps, at all times, can be seen strips
of halibut or salmon suspended in the smoke of the dwelling-houses, or
drying in the open air on frames erected for the purpose. In the sum-
mer season there is an abundance of all kinds of food, but the energies
of the Indians are directed to laying up a stock for winter’s use. Hali-
but abound from March to November, and are readily caught on their
favorite banks, known to the natives who camp near such localities.
Halibut and salmon, fresh and dried, form the basis of the food supply.
The salmon are caught during the “runs.” After the daily wants are
supplied, and a sufficient number dried for winter’s use, the surplus fish
are converted into oil. This oil, as well as all other kinds, is used as a
sauce, into which nearly everything is dipped before eating. Seal and
porpoise flesh, or blubber, is esteemed a great delicacy, although they
will not eat whale’s blubber for superstitious reasons. Any kind of meat
of wild animals is eaten when procurable, but it is only in recent years
that they have ever salted down or dried meat for winter’s use. Other
kinds of fish, such as- cod, herring, and eulachon, are much esteemed.
During the run of herring large quantities are dried or pressed into oil.
Eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus), the so-called “candle-fish,” a kind of
smelt, run in March and April at the mouth of the Skeena, Nass, and
Stikeen Rivers. These have the greatest proportion of fatty matter
known in any fish. In frying they melt almost completely into oil, and
need cnly the insertion of some kind of a wick to serve as a candle.

Fish roe.—The roe of fish is: esteemed a great delicacy, and great
care is taken to collect it in the water, or remove it from captured fish.
It is either eaten fresh, or dried and preserved for winter’s use, when
it is eaten in two ways: (1) It is pounded between two stones, diluted
with water, and beaten with wooden spoons into a creamy consistency ;
or (2) itis boiled with sorrel and different dried berries, and molded
in wooden frames into cakes about 12 inches square and 1 inch thick.

Herbs and berries.—Roots, herbs, berries, and snails are amongst the
luxuries of the summer season. Raspberries, salmon berries, straw-
berries, currants, red and blue huckleberries, salal, and thimble berries
abound late in the summer. Some of these are collected and dried for

276
. THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 277

winter’s use, forming, with the dried fish, the principal winter’s supply
Poole (1863) says of the Haida, that they often, through feasting or
improvidence, eat up all the dried berries before spring, and “ were it
not for a few bulbs which they dig out of the soil in the early spring-
time, while awaiting the halibut season, numbers of Indians really
would starve to death.” *

Portlock mentions the root of the wild lily as very much used by the
Tlingit. Crab-apples are found, but are scarcely edible. Wild parsnips
are abundant and palatable. Many years ago an American ship cap-
tain gave the Indians potatoes, and they are now regularly cultivated,
and form a considerable item in the winter food supply. Other vegeta-
bles may be and are grown. Near all the villages now may be seen
patches of ground planted, however, principally in potatoes.

Oil.—Fish is eaten dried by breaking it up and soaking the bits in
fish-oil or grease, having the consistency of uncooled jelly. This oil
is obtained from seals, porpoises, herring, salmon, eulachon, goat, deer,
bear, and the livers of the dog-fish, shark, and other vertebrates. It
is the odor of this rancid oil which permeates everything Indian, and
renders a visit to a lodge on the northwest coast somewhat. of an
ordeal.

Invertebrates.—Invertebrates and several species of marine algae or
sea-weed are eaten. Of the former there are clams, crabs, cuttle-fish,
and mussels or oysters, the last named being often poisonous at certain
seasons. The clams, echinoderms, and sea-weed are gathered at ebb
tide. The shell fish are usually eaten in the winter months.

Sea-weed.—The sea-weed is dried for winter’s use and pressed into a
kind of cake, like plug tobacco. A species of it, quite black when dried,
is used for making a dish called sopallaly, of which the Indians are im-
moderately fond. This is made by breaking up a very small piece of
the pressed sopallaly cake into little bits in a bowl or dish and adding
warm water. It is then beaten with a wooden spoon and sugar is
added. It froths and foams like the white of an egg or like soap, and
gradually turns from a terra-cotta color to white. Berries, fresh or
dried, are sometimes added, and the mixture is consumed with avidity
by old and young. Langsdorff (1805) says in spring and summer the
Tlingit gather several sorts of sea-weed, which, ‘“‘ when cooked, make a
bitterish sort of soup.” t

He mentions also “a sort of square cake made-of the bark of the
spruce fir, pounded and mixed with the roots, berries and train oil.” t

Bark.—The inner bark of the spruce and hemlock forms an important
part of the food supply of the Haida, Tlingit, and Tsimshian. The
southern Indian eats pine bark. Plate xx, Fig. 79a, shows a stone
scraper used by the northern Indians for removing this inner bark from
the trunk. The scrapings are molded into cakes about a foot square

* Poole, Queen Charlotte Islands, p. 315. t Langsdorff, Voyages, Pt. 11, p. 131,
278 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

and an inch thick, dried and preserved for winter's use. It is eaten,
like dried fish, with oil as a sauce.

Birds.—The Indians are remarkably fond of wild fowl, but the diffi-
culties of shooting and entrapping them with their ordinary imple-
ments and means have made them a very inconsiderable source of their
food supply. At certain seasons, however, they capture them by strat-
egy. Wild geese they catch after they have shed their large wing
feathers and are unable to fly.* At other times they hunt wild fowl
by night with torches and fell them with clubs. Poole (1864) thus de-
scribes bird slaughtering amongst the Kwakiutl:

The birds, which are small but plump, burrow their holes in the sand-banks on the
shores. When the slaughtering season arrives the Indians prepare torches composed
of long sticks having the tips smeared with gum taken from the pine trees. Armed
with handy clubs, they then place these lighted torches at the mouths of the holes,
and as soon as the birds, attracted by the glare, flutter forth, they fell them to the
ground.t

Birds’ Eggs.—Birds’ eggs are collected, wherever possible, in early
summer. The Haida derive their supply from the outlying rocks of
the Queen Charlotte Islands. The Kaigani make trips out to Forrester
and other islands. Each location is pre-empted by particular families,
and considered hereditary property, which is handed down from gen-

eration to generation.

Cooking and Preparation of Food.—Dried fish, bark, roe, ete., are
eaten with grease or oil, as before stated. Salmon roe is buried in
boxes on the beach, washed by the tide, and eaten in a decomposed
state. The heads of salmon and halibut are esteemed a great luxury
when putrefied in the tide or salt water. Meat is either broiled on a
stick, roasted on hot stones, or boiled in a kettle. Before the intro-
duction of kettles, meat was boiled in a wooden dish or water-tight
basket by means of red hot stones added to the water. Fresh fish and
cuttle fish are always cooked. Oil is extracted from the livers of dog-
fish and stranded sharks and whales, to sell to the whites. Oil is ob-
tained in differentlocalities from salmon, herring, eulachon, and pollock.
The fish is usually allowed to partially putrefy and then boiled in wooden
boxes by means of hot stones dropped in the water. The grease or oil
is skimmed from the surface. The refuse is squeezed in mats, and the
grease obtained is stored in boxes. Sometimes this grease or oil is run
into the hollow stalks of giant kelp, which have been tanned or pre-
pared beforehand as follows: The stalks are soaked in fresh water to
extract the salt, dried in the sun or in the smoke of the dwelling, and
then toughened and made pliable with oil, rubbed thoroughly in. In
this form of storage the oil is as portable as in bottles, or in jars, with
less danger of breakage. Birds or wild fowls are toasted on a stick
before a slow fire without any previous plucking or cleaning, and the
feathers and skin removed afterward. The entrails are supposed to
add a decidedly better flavor to the bird.

When the salmon or halibut are caught, it is the duty of the women
to clean and dry them. The head is cut off, the fish slit down the
back, back-bone and entrails removed, and the tail and fins cut off.
The cleaned fish is then cut into long flakes, which are hung on a
wooden frame, and cured, without salt, either in the sun or by means
of a slow fire beneath. Sometimes they are dried in the smoke of the
dwellings. The fish when dried are either wrapped in bark or stored
in chests or boxes, and stowed for future use out of the reach of the
dogs and children. When bear, deer, goats, or other game are killed,
the skin is not generally removed from the carcass until most of the
flesh has been eaten. In this way the skin forms a wrapper to preserve
and protect the flesh. Grease obtained by boiling the meat is skimmed
from the surface of the water and esteemed a great delicacy.

INDUSTRIAL IMPLEMENTS OR TOOLS.

In general.—Primitive tools were of stone, the most common edged
ones being of flint, or a peculiar hard green jadeite, or, where possible
to obtain it, of jade, which last named they got from the north in trade.
Rough tools and implements, such as sledges, hammers, mortars, pes-
tles, scrapers, etc., were of igneous rock, roughly carved in the totem
of the owner. The knives for more delicate carvings in wood were of
copper, flint, jade, or the bones of fishes and mammals, the work being
smoothed down with shark skin used as a sand-paper. Steel: has now
been substituted for stone in all of their tools, but the native shape has
been in a measure retained.

Hummers and Sledges.—These were of hard igneous stone, rudely
carved, and are used here and there even to this day. Figs. 81, 82, 85,
and 86, Plate XxII, represent a variety of these as regards shapes, sizes,
and methods of hafting, while Plate xx, Figs. 79, b and ¢, show a very
primitive form of hammer and sledge-head, respectively.

Adzes.—A variety of adz-blades of a green jade-like stone are shown
in Fig. 79, same plate, d,e,and f. Figs. 88 and 89, Plate xxi, are other
varieties of this pick-shaped blade, of which Figs. 90 and 91 show
methods of hafting. A more handy variety of adz, for finishing and
planing work, is shown in Fig. 79 g, f being a variety of blades as re-
gards size. The methods of hafting this flat-shaped blade throughout
the northwest coast are shown in Fig. 79 g and Figs. 87, 92, 93, and 94,
Plate xx. Iron or steel is now substituted for stone, and the favor-
ite form is that made by sharpening the end of a broad flat file. Dixon
(1787) says the only stone implement he saw amongst the Tlingit and
Haida was an adze made of jasper, ‘‘ the same as those used by the
New Zealanders.”*

Knives.—Before the introduction of iron the only metal available was
copper. This was not used for industrial purposes, as knives, on ac-

count of its softness. Chief reliance was placed in jade, flint, or other
stone, and upon shells and bone. In the Emmons Collection in the
Museum of Natural History in New York are two primitive Tlingit
stone knives, with horn handles, and illustrated in. ~s. 99 a and 99 b.
The handles are of deer horn, the blades of jade, ana __> lashing of
buckskin. Marchand (1791) expressed his astonishment at che elab-
orately carved posts in front of the
Haida houses of Queen Charlotte Isl-
ands, which, he says, were fashioned
out with ‘‘a sharp stone, hafted on a
branch of a tree, the bone of a quadru-
ped, the bone of one fish and the rough
skin of another.”* On the introduction
of iron, which both Cook and Dixon
attribute to the Russians, the Indians
were not slow to adapt it to their pur-
poses. Dixon says that in Captain
Cook’s time *“‘iron implements were
then also in use” among the Tlingit
and Haida, while, in 1787, their knives
were ‘‘sovery thin that they bend them
into a variety of forms, which answer
their every purpose nearly as well as
if they had recourse to a carpenter’s
tool chest.”+ This applies, however,
equally well to-day, as Plate xxtv will

having their handles carved with totemic designs after the usual custom

Scrapers.—T wo varieties of stone scrapers are shown in Plate xx, Fig.

off the inner bark of the spruce and hemlock for food. The latter is a
stone skin scraper used in cleaning hides in the process of tanning. These
are also of bone, as shown in Fig. 79k from the Emmons collection,
and are often ornamented with totemic designs, as in the specimen
shown.

villages are now found large and small stone mortars and pestles, sur-

prisingly well carved in totemic designs.

These were by some people supposed to indicate that
in early days these Indians ground maize, as did and
do the hunting Indians of the interior, but such is not
the case, as they were unacquainted with cereals of any
kind. These mortars were used for an entirely different
purpose. Inthe larger ones were ground and prepared
the tobacco plug. for chewing; in the smaller were
mixed and ground the different paints used for the
body, masks, carvings, and all the various purposes to
which these native pigments were and are now applied.
Fig. 83, Plate xxi, represents a paint-pestle, which was
also used as a weapon or missile, carried in the hand in
times of local feuds, brawls, and quarrels. Fig. 83a
represents a pestle of this kind in the Emmons Col-
lection already referred to. Another variety of pestle is
sh vu in Plate Lx, Fig 338. Fig.339 of same plate
is an ancient tobacco mortar of marble or calcite, neatly
carved on the exterior with a totemic design. Other
mortars carved in likeness of frogs, birds, fishes, and
flower-pots are found throughout the northern region.

Wedges.—These are usually of wood and formerly
were entirely so. Now, however, iron wedges are some-
times used. These, in any case, are for splitting up logs
into boards, and in getting out timber in the rough
generally. A very useful type of wooden wedge is
shown in Fig. 84, Plate xxt1, general throughout the
coast. These were used in connection with the heavy
sledges shown in the same plate. The heads of the

illustration. The skill with which hugeslabs, rafters, and boards are
gotten out with the rough tools employed is surprising.

Chisels.—A primitive type of chisel is shown in Fig. 78, consisting of
a green stone blade mounted in a wooden handle. The blade is similar
in shape to those of the adzes. This instrument was
used in roughing down the surface, the smoothing being
done by scraping with sharp-edged shells or stones, or
even by rubbing with shark or dog-fish skin to get a
finished surface.

Drills.—Woles, where drilled, were made by patient
digging with a pointed instrument of stone or bone, or
by driving ina copper spike and withdrawing it. Joints
were made by dovetailing, mortising, tonguing and
grooving, or notching and lashing, great imgenuity
being shown in avoiding the necessity for pegs or nails.

Paint-brushes.—These are shown in all their varieties
in Plate xv, A and B, and are well adapted to the
neat work demanded of them. Bristles, hair, and vege-
table fiber are the materials used for the brush-heads.
The handles of those from the northern region are carved
with the usual totemic designs.

Other tools and implements adapted to special uses
in their arts and industries will be described in Chapter
VIL.

WEAPONS OF WAR AND OF THE CHASE.

Weapons.—The principal weapons before the advent
of the whites were clubs of wood and stone, bows and
arrows, spears with shell, bone, flint, copper, or jade
tips, and, above all, the dagger, the constant companion
of the Indian of this region.

CHISEL. Clubs.—These were of wood, of stone, or of stone
(Emmons Collection.) afted with wood. The hafted stone clubs were simply
industrial implements already described and used for the time being
as weapons. A Tsimshian stone war-club is illustrated in Fig. 122,
Platexxvul. A Tlingit stone war-club in the Emmons Collection, New
York, isshown in Fig. 1194. It is possible that the slave-killers, shown
in Plate XLVI, were also carried as weapons, althongh no war-clubs of
this type are now found in this region. Plate xxviir illustrates a
variety of clubs used for different purposes. Fig. 132 is a war-club
pure and simple, the others being hunting or fishing implements and
used to give the death-blow to seals, sea-otters, or fish after their cap-
ture by the different methods explained hereafter. These are all carved
either with the totemic design of the owner or a representation of the
animal itself. Hach club is used distinctly for the purpose of dispatch-

THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST, 283

ing the animal for which it was made. Figs. 128 and 129 are sea-otter
clubs; Figs. 130 and 131 are seal clubs. The halibut and other fish
clubs are similar in design. A type not here illustrated is a round
wooden knob with straight handle.

Daggers.—Dixon (1787) says of the
Haida and Tlingit:

Their weapons are spears fixed to a pole &
or 8 feet long, and a kind of short dagger,
which is worn in a leather case, and tied
round the body; to this dagger a leather
thong is fastened, at the end of which is a hole
for the middle finger; the leather is afterwards
twisted round the wrist in order to fix the
dagger firm in the hand, so that the warrior
loses his weapon only with his life.*

The handle is generally nearer one
end than the other, giving’a long blade
and a short one. The leather sheath
is usually strapped to the waist or
hung about the neck, concealed be-
neath the blanket. The handle is small
in diameter, wrapped with leather, and
secured by a thong to the wrist when
carried in the hand. The blades are
flat and thicker down the middle than
towards the edges, being generally
grooved on each side of the center
ridge. All varieties of patterns, how-
ever, are found, the different types
being well represented in Plate xxv,
of which Fig. 108 represents a primi-
tive dagger of copper inlaid with hali-
otis shell, while Fig. 107 is the same
type, of steel, with copper mountings. Se

the same for the long blade, the latter RE athe eae
having, as shown, a strap to go about the neck. The dagger shown in
Fig. 107 is from the Copper River Indians, but is clearly a Tlingit type,
having undoubtedly reached that region in the course of trade. Fig. 106
shows a one-bladed dagger with acarved handle. Fig. 104, with its three
details, a, b, and c, shows the method of securing the handle to the blade.
Fig. 105 is a Tlingit chiet’s dagger. The edges of all of them are rather
dull and the points somewhat blunt, but the execution which these
deadly weapons do is in the force with which they are driven into an

back into the interior. Fig. 116 is a slight modification in the type of
117, in the direction of 118. The first daggers that were made of steel,
after the advent of the whites, were converted by the natives from

large flat files, which they also
made into adze blades. The skill-
ful manner in which the Indians
ground down the files into beauti-
fully fluted daggers challenged
the admiration of the traders,
who found the work as skillfully
done as that by European metal-
workers. The primitive dagger
was of stone or bone. Those of
bone were of the shape shown in
Fig. 107, Plate xxv, with a sharp
ridge running down the middle.
Fig. 108) represents a Tlingit
stone dagger from the Emmons

about one-third of the distance

ay equally with the
harpoon, a weapon of the greatest importance, and a high
type of each has been developed. The backing of sinew
on the bow is occasionally found amongst the Tlingit, but
not so skillfully applied as in the north (see Smithsonian
Report, 1884, “A Study of the Eskimo Bows in the U.S.
National Museum,” by Mr. John Murdoch). Amongst the
Indians of the northwest coast the bow and arrow is and
always has been only an auxiliary hunting implement,
although a very important one, in the capture of sea-otter.
To-day the bow and arrow survives only as a means of
despatching wounded game to save powder and ball. The
two types of coast Indian bows, the broad and narrow,
are shown in Plate xxvi. The narrow type (Figs. 109, 110,
and 115) is principally confined to the Tlingit, whereas the
broader one (Figs. 111, 112, and 114) is found amongst not
only the Tlingit, but the Haida and Tlingit as well. In
Fig. 112 the peculiar groove down the inside of the bow
is shown. The device in Fig. 115 to protect the thumb
from the snap of the bow-string consists of a wooden
bridge lashed to the inner side of the bow at the middle.
This is a willow bow of the type found in the interior

amongst the Tinne, and either copied from their type or obtained by
trade from them. Cedar and yew are the principal woods used by
the coast Indians for bows, the strings being of hide or sinew. Few
bows are now seen amongst these Indians except as toys for the chil-

dren.

Arrows.—Before the introduction of iron, arrow-heads were of bone,
flint, shell, or copper. The copper and later iron heads were of the
shape shown in Fig. 133a or i34a, Plate xxIXx, fitting into an ivory or

bone fore-shaft, the shaft being of cedar. In some varieties the barbs
are on one side only. Fig. 124, Plate xxvilI, represents a bone-headed
arrow. Figs. 135 and 136, Plate xxix, are bone spear-heads, but the
same shape of smaller size are used for arrows. These are set into a
bone or ivory fore shaft similar to the Eskimo arrows. Fig. 125 rep-
resents an arrow with a head made of shell. The fore-shafts are of light
cedar wood let into the larger shafts. In the Emmons Collection is a
black flint arrow-head represented as coming from this region. The
style of blunt-headed arrow is shown in Fig. 126: These are generally
used for despatching wounded game. Fig. 126a shows one variety of
bone arrow-head of this blunt pattern. The tenon at the butt fits into

a socket either in the bone fore-shaft or in the cedar shaft itself.
Fig. 1266 shows another kind, in which the shaft fits into the head
itself, where it is secured by means of a tight lashing of twisted bark,
cord, or sinew. “Fig. 126c shows a third variety, in which a thin tongue
or projection on the side of the bone arrow-head lets into a groove on
the side of the shaft. Through holes pierced in this tongue and through
the head of the arrow-shaft wires are run to attach the head to the
shaft. The general types of iron arrow-heads are shown in Figs. 119,
120, 121, and 123, Plate xxvii, and 133a, 134a, and 138, Plate xxix.
The fore-shafts of 119 and 120 are of bone. Arrows with bone fore-
Shafts, or bone or ivory sockets on the head of the arrow-shafts, and
with detachable heads similar to those used by the Eskimo, are occa-
sionally found amongst the Tlingit. The arrows of the southern Indians
are in general superior to those of the northern, and of the interior In-
dians to those on the coast.
_ War spears.—The primitive form was a simple wooden pole sharpened
and hardened in the fire, or pointed with copper and later with iron. *

* Bodega y Quadra, quoted in Bancroft, Native Races, Vol. 1, p. 104.
288 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Not many stone spear heads are found in this region. There is one
in the Emmons Collection in New York, but how it was attached to the
spear shaft does not appear. Marchand (1793) describes the war spear
as consisting of two parts, a wooden shaft and an iron head, shaped like
a Swiss halberd.* Plate xvi, Fig. 64, shows a wooden ceremonial
spear, doubtless an imitation of an ancient form of copper or stone-
headed spear. Fig. 113, Plate xxvVI, is a Sitka war spear with carved
handle or shaft and steel bayonet pointed head. In general the war
spears have shafts from 10 to 14 feet long, whereas the hunting spears
are much shorter.

Fur-seal spear.—This in general consists of a long, light cedar shaft and
a detachable head. The shaft is of the primitive type with a socket in the
upper end to receive the butt end of the detachable head. This latter.
was formerly made of bone but later and at present of iron or steel.
(Plate xx1x, Figs, 133a, 134a, 135 and 136.) The steel ones are generally
made by the Haida themselves from old flat files which they purchase
from the traders. The end is sharply pointed, as shown in the figure,
while the edges and back are wrought into sharp barbs to hold in the
flesh. A loop of wire, or a shackle near the butt end, serves for the
attachment of one end of a strong cord of plaited sinew, sea-weed, or
vegetable fibre, the other end being secured to a float or bladder. This
spear is nothing more nor less than a harpoon. The seal being struck,
the head detaches itself and the animal is thus secured to one end of a
line. When not in use, the head is carried in a sheath made of two
pieces of cedar wood in the shape of a fish’s tail, securely lashed together
with bark or spruce root lashings. (Figs. 133) and 134b.) When
about to be used, the sheath is removed and the detachable head fixed
in the socket of the light cedar shaft. Figs. 135 and 136 represent de-
tachable spear heads of bone, with barbed edges. The cross sections
ec and d show that one is lenticular in shape and the other triangular.
This type of spear head is not unlike that of the Eskimo and Aleut and
is of very primitive design. Arrow-heads of this shape and description
are common amongst the Eskimo but are rare in the coast Indian region.
The fur-seal spears here described are virtually harpoons.

Salmon spears.—Primitive types of salmon spear heads are shown in
Figs. 137 and 138, Plate xxtx. The shafts are now, as always, of light
cedar wood, the recent changes in the character of the spears being due
to the substitution of large steel fish hooks for spear heads. These
hooks, purchased from the traders, are lashed to the spear shaft near
the end, as shown in Fig. 149, Plate xxx, and the old-fashioned spear
head done away with altogether. This is a very effective spear, and in
the Indian’s hands seldom fails to bring up its victim. Fig. 137e is a
bone salmon spear head from the Emmons collection. Fig 149a is a
Tlingit salmon gig of deer antler for snagging salmon, also from the

drift. This type is adapted to the capture of other kinds of fish and
even the sea-otter, but one better for all purposes of hunting and fish-
ing is that shown in Fig. 150, Plate xxx. A detailed description of the
spear complete may not be out of place, as it is the general coast Indian
type from Puget Sound to CapeSt. Elias. Such aspear consists of three
parts, the shaft, fore-shaft, and head. The shaft is a light cedar pole,
having in the outer end a socket, and served on that end with a wrap-
ping of cedar bark fibre or spruce root to prevent its splitting. The
general type of fore-shaft is that shown in Fig. 1370, Plate xx1x. It is
of cedar wood, about 8 to 10 inches long, and pointed at both ends, that
at c being a flat leaf-shaped expansion fitting into the socket in the end
of the shaft. The point d fits into a socket in the butt of the spear head.
The usual type of spear head as now found is that shown in Fig. 150),
Plate Xxx, consisting of a barbed arrow-shaped head of steel with asocket
at the butt formed by two pieces of bone lashed to the end of the steel tip.
The lashing tapers, and is usually covered with spruce gum so as to
offer no obstruction to the whole head entering a fish, seal, or other vic-
tim. The lashing also secures the end of a laniard about 2 feet or more
long, the other end of which goes to the end of the shaft and is there
lashed. In other words, the detachable head is really attached to the
spear shaft by a very stout cord. The two bone barbs at the butt of
the spear head form the socket for the end ¢ of the fore-shaft. When
the game is struck the fore-shaft comes away from both the spear shaft
and spear head, but the head is secured to the spear shaft by its lan-
iard, and a harpoon line is bent to the spear shaft, so that the capt-
ured animal is on one end of a continuous line of which the other is

either attached to a float or is in the hand of the Indian. Fig. 150a is
another steel salmon spear head of the same type, while Fig. 138, Plate
XXIX, is a three-pronged spear of a very different type. In its more primi-
tive form the three barbed prongs are of long pieces of
bone with barbed and serrated edges. Sometimes the
same design as that shown is found, in which the arrow-
Shaped tips are of bone or shell. Steel is now generally
used, the fore-shaft of the head being permanently se-
cured into a socket in the head of the cedar wood spear
shaft with a tough lashing and a coating of spruce gun
at the joint.

Fish hooks.—The apparently clumsy hooks of this re-
gion have been found to possess so many advantages
over the type used by Europeans that they are retained
by the Indians to this day. Curiously enough the use to
which they put our large steel hooks is shown in Fig.
149, Plate xxx, viz, as spear heads, to which they are
admirably adapted. There is little in the art of fishing
that we can teach these Indians, and their conservatism
is founded on exceedingly good judgment, although it
is not to be denied that superstitious belief in the effi-
ciency of certain forms of hooks is somewhat of an ele-

Bs ment in such conservatism. One advantage the native

Peon "4 hooks undoubtedly possess over our ownis in not being —
(Tlingit. Emmonsco.  Wable to foul the bottom. A very primitive type of hook
a. is that shown in Fig. 147, Plate xxx, in which the barb

is a straight piece of bone, the shank a piece of wood, and the snood or
snell a piece of whale bone. The snood is attached to the shank by a
lashing of bark. This type of hook must be distinguished from the
double-pointed one similar in general construction shown in Fig. 146.
This is a sort of gig or snag for hooking fish where they are plentiful.
Fig. 145 is such an instrument pure and simple, the iron head shown fit-
ting to a cedar pole shaft. It is used for gigging salmon where they are
thick and sluggish during the “runs.” A very primitive type of hook
not uncommon in Alaska is that shown in Fig. 142, consisting of a small
narrow block of wood with a spike of bone, shell, or iron, and a snood
of spruce root, kelp or whale bone. The general varieties of hooks
used in the northern region about Dixon Entrance are shown in Plate
XxXxI. Of these the primitive halibut hooks are Figs. 155, 156, 159, and
161. The first two are made in two pieces, each lashed at the joint
with cedar bark, the shanks being carved with designs supposed to
give good luck to the fisherman. The barbs were formerly of bone or
shell, but later of iron. The last two are made from the forked
branches of a tree dressed down to neat dimensions, and are very
strong and serviceable, often bringing up halibut weighing from 50 to
120 pounds. The bait is lashed to that arm of the hook which carries

the barb and just under it. Fig. 158 is also a primitive type of hook
made in two pieces and of the same character as those just described.
A second primitive variety is that made by steaming and bending a
tough limb of yew or other wood into the shape shown in Fig. 153,
which is a Makah hook from Cape Flattery, Washington Territory
(Wakashan stock). Their hooks are by far the neatest on the coast,
and are traded to the northern Indians. The lashing shown across
it in the plate is for securing the bait, this being the method of winding
the string when the hook is not inuse. Fig. 152 1s a Chilkat and 157
a Haida version of this same type of hook. Fig. 152 is an iron one
modeled also on this design, and similar in shape to Fig. 161.

Another kind of hook differing from those just described in shape,
principle, and freedom from fouling the bottom, is used for catching
cod, flounders, etc., and is thus described by Judge J. G. Swan in a
pamphlet on the fisheries of the north:

They are made of the knots of hemlock limbs cut out from old decayed logs.
These are split in pieces of suitable size and whittled to the required shape, and
bent by being steamed into the form which in the skil hook resembles the longitu-
dinal section of a goose egg. The lower portion of these hooks are curved inward to
form a barb, and when not in use the two ends of the hook are fastened together by
a piece of twine, which is also used to tie on the bait. When the hook is to be used
the two parts of the hook are separated by means of a stick or peg, which the fish
knocks out when he takes the bait, and the two ends of the hook close together and
hold him fast; the peg floats to the surface and indicates to the Indian that he has
caught a fish.

The sinker is another ingenious contrivance; it is a large stone, weighing from 12
to 15 pounds, and a smaller one to serve as a tripping stone; the line is firmly wound
around these stones with many turns, and a bight or loop tucked under one of the
parts in the same manner a signal officer rolls up a flag in a ball and tucks a bight
of the haliard under a turn, which, when pulled out, sets the flag free; so when the
Indian fisherman thinks, from the number of floating pegs, that he has enough fish,
he pulls out the loop of his line, the stones become loosened and fall out, and he
hauls in his line relieved of their weight.

The Haidas frequently put on one hundred hooks to a single line, which acts like
a trawl, and so plentiful are the black cod that often from fifty to seventy-five are
hauled in at one time. The bait used seems to be anything handy, as the skil is a
greedy feeder, and will take either fresh herring, squid, or a strip of the white skin
from a halibut’s belly. The Indian, however, has enemies to contend with; one of
the most formidable is the ground shark, or nurse fish, as the sailors call them, which
will eat off the bodies of a whole line full of fish, leaving only their heads; there is
a small fish of the cottoid or sculpin variety (Blepsias cirrhosus)—Nukaio, kaiungo—
(Haida) which will steal the bait and sometimes gets caught. Dogfish also are at
times very troublesome. Whenever the Indian is sure of the presence of these pests
he goes to another place to fish.

This type of hook is also reproduced in iron. A sketch is given in
Plate xxx, Fig. 148 a and b. The former shows the hook baited and
pried open with a peg; the latter shows it when not in use, lashed to
preserve the spring in the wood or iron. Fig. 160, Plate xxx1, shows
a peculiar device used by the Haida for catching red fish. The withe
of wood, a, is tough and elastic, and secured at its middle point to the
992 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

line. The hooks are somewhat on the pattern of those just described,
but no pegs are used. Fig. 141 represents an Indian trawl line for the
ocean fisheries of the northwest coast. The ground-line is made of
cedar roots, the snoods or gaugings of whalebone and cedar, and the
hooks of steamed and bent cedar wood, with barbs of iron. Except in
the use of an iron barb the whole device is a very primitive pattern.

It should be noted here, however, that the use of whalebone is found
extensively amongst the southern coast Indians (especially of Vancou-
ver Islands), and the Kenai, Aleut, and Eskimo, but rarely amongst
the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian. For superstitious reasons the whale
has never been hunted in this last named locality, and the eating of
whale’s blubber has been prohibited to them by tradition and custom.
Where whalebone is found in use amongst them it has reached them
in the way of trade from the north or south.

Fish-rake.—A rake consisting of a long thin lath with sharp spikes of
bone, copper, or iron on one edge, like a comb, as shown in Fig. 139,
Plate XXIx, is used in herring and eulachon fishing. With these in-
struments the Indians beat the surface of the water, during the “run”
of these fish inenormous shoals, seldom failing to bring up two or three
at a time, transfixed on the sharp teeth.

Fish-baskets.— These differ little from the open mesh type of basket
hereafter described. They are used for dipping out fish during the
“runs” and in this sense are simply dip-nets.

Fishing-lines.—These are either made from the stems of the giant
kelp, which grows so abundantly on the coast, or from vegetable fiber,
. such as bark, spruce, and cedar roots, ete. Sinew and whalebone are
little used amongst the northern coast Indians. The vegetable fiber is
_ neatly twisted into two or three strand cord, as shown in Fig, 144, Plate
Xxx, although sometimes plaited with threads of wild hemp or shredded
sea-weed. The stems of the giant kelp are cured in the smoke or sun
and simply knotted together, the usual knot being that shown in detail
' in Fig 143, Plate xxx. This kelp grows in from 3 to 30 fathoms, or
deeper. At the root it is about one-fourth inch in diameter, and
solid, expanding upwards and becoming hollow about half way up.
Its upper end is surmounted by a large hollow bulb, from which floats
long, streamer-like, or lanceolate leaves. These are great rock or shoal
indicators, and are invaluable “ notices to mariners.” JudgeSwan says:
“The Indians cut these stems close to the bottom with a simple instru-
ment formed of a V-shaped branch, across the smaller portion of which
a knife blade is secured; this is lowered over a kelp plant in 20 or 30
fathoms, and the stem easily cut off by a sudden pull of the line at-
tached to the cutter.” The solid stems are used for fishing-lines and
the bulbs for oil bottles, both being cured by soaking in fresh water
and drying in the smoke or sun. The smoke-dried lines are black, and
the sun-dried of a light yellow or neutral color. It should be noted
here that the Yakutat and other Tlingit of the extreme North have

been much influenced by the Kenai and Aleut, who use sinew, blad-
ders, and intestines of animals, in the manufacture of their fishing im-
plements. Dixon (1787) speaking of the Yakutat halibut fishing says:

They bait their hooks with a kind of fish * * * orsquid, * * * and
having sunk it to the bottom they fix a bladder to the end of the line as a buoy, and
should that not watch sufficiently they add another. Their lines are very strong, be-
ing made of intestines of animals. One man is sufficient to look after five or six of
these buoys; when he perceives a fish bite he is in no great hurry to haul up his line,
but gives him time to be well hooked, and when he has hauled the fish up to the sur-
face of the water he knocks him on the head with a short club provided for that pur-
pose, and afterwards stows his prize away at his leisure. This is done to prevent
the halibut (which sometimes are very large) from damaging or perhaps upsetting
his canoe in their dying struggles. Thus were we fairly beat at our own weapons,
and the natives constantly bringing us plenty of fish our boat was never sent on this
business afterwards.t

Amongst the Tlingit these floats are generally duck-shaped and
carved from wood, although bladders are also used amongst them as
mentioned by Langsdorf (1805), who says: ‘To every line is fastened
a small bladder, which floats upon the surface of the water, so that one
person can attend fourteen or fifteen lines.” t

Floats—The modern type of fishing-float is of wood, carved to repre-
sent an aquatic bird of some sort, and these floats are of two kinds,
under-water and surface. The surface floats have been spoken of
above, and one is represented in Fig. 140, Plate xxix. The under-
water ones are to float the halibut hooks just clear of the bottom, as
shown in Fig. 151), Plate xxx, as it is here that the halibut feeds.
The stone sinker, a, is detachable from the line, and is used to keep
the hook and float both near the bottom. This style of float is also
illustrated in Fig. 159, Plate XxxI. |

Fishing-clubs.—These have been spoken of at the beginning of this
chapter and illustrated in Plate xvi. A peculiarly carved club is
used for each different kind of animal, superstitious reasons being given
for such variety.

Drag-nets—Nets are made from cedar bark, wild hemp, or wild
nettle fiber, spun into twine, and now woven with a shuttle similar to
that used by fishermen on our own coast. Some of these are small, and
are secured to poles and dragged between two canoes; others are long
and are similiar to our seines. Fig. 162, Plate xxxtl, represents a Haida
drag-net of this last kind. The roping is of cedar bark; the netting,
of hemp twine; d is a wooden float on the end of the drag-line; the
floats along the head are thin flat blocks of cedar wood, spaced about
3 feet apart; the sinkers at the foot are black pebbles or stones lashed
in a circular hoop and spaced about 8 to 10 inches apart. Details of
the netting areshown in Fig. 162a. The net from which this illustration
was drawn is 52 feet long and 64 inches deep, from Masset, Queen
Charlotte Islands, British Columbia. What were the styles and by

* Dixon, Voyage, p. 174. t Langsdorf, Voyages, pt. I, p. 134,
294 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

what means nets were woven before the advent of the whites, the
writer was unable to learn.

Dip-nets.—Two varieties of these are shown in Plate xxxu, Figs.
163 and 164, the frame of the one being oval and the other triangular.
Details of the netting are shown in bande. Fig. 163 is the kind used
by the Indians for scooping up echini or sea-urchins at low tide, while
Fig. 164 is the kind used for dipping out salmon caught in the river-
traps, and for herring, eulachon, etc., during the “runs.”

Weirs.—Across the streams where salmon run weirs are usually
built for trapping them. Where the water is shallow and swift, frames
of split sticks, interwoven with older branchesin a kind of basket-
work, are stretched across, driven into the bottom, and strengthened
with braces held in position by pegs. These frames,‘or weirs, are
spaced a little distance apart, so that when the salmon leaps the first
frame he is trapped between it and the second, and is removed by a
dip-net or speared at leisure. In deeper water the dam, or weir, consists
of a basket-work frame with round openings here and there, with pass-
age-ways conical in shape, formed by converging pointed sticks, like
some kinds of wire rat-traps. The salmon going up stream forces his
way through and is trapped in a basket-work compartment and dipped
out. at leisure. ;

Bird and other land traps.—The usual forms of Indian traps are found
in this region, consisting of a cage and figure-of-four trigger, a bent
sapling with snare noose, and the larger game traps of the usual dead-
fall pattern.

Canoes.—The canoe is to the northwest coast what the camel is to the
desert. It is to the Indian of this region what the horse is to the Arab.
It is the apple of his eye and the object of his solicitous attention and
affection. It reaches its highest development in the world amongst
the Haida of the Queen Charlotte Islands. Classified according to
shapes, sizes, and uses, there may be said to be four kinds on the north-
west coast: (1) hunting, (2) family and transporting, (3) voyaging,
and (4) war. The voyaging and war canoes, although kept for different
purposes are practically the same in size and shape, the differences, if
any, being slight.

Hunting and fishing canoes.—These are somewhat similar throughout
the whole coast and are well illustrated in the models shown in Plate
XXxIlI, The upper view in the illustration is by far the most common
type of hunting canoes, but the lower one is that seen about Dixon
Entrance. They are light portable dugouts carrying from one to three
people.

Family or transportation canoes.—These are from 25 to 35 feet long
and 4 to 6 feet beam, carrying whole families of from four to fifteen with
camping outfit, trading supplies, baggage, provisions, etc., amounting
often to 2 tons weight or more. Farther south, around Puget Sound
and Vancouver Island, this kind of canoe has a straight stern post, as
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 295

shown in Plate xxxiv, Fig. 171. Amongst the Haida and other north-
ern tribes the stern projects backwards and slightly upwards, forming
a long spur running down to a straight edge near the water line (Fig.
172, same plate). The bow also curves upward and has a regular and
eracefully shaped cut- water.

Voyaging canoes.— | hese are from 35 to 65 feet long and 6 to 8 feet beam,
with flaring gunwale and long projecting spurs on both bow and stern.
These latter are generally scarfed on to the main body of the canoes,
and with the flare of the bows help to make them more sea-worthy.
Poole (1863) describes the canoe of Chief Kene, of the Queen Charlotte
Islands, British Columbia (in which he made a voyage from the latter’s
village to Victoria, British Columbia), as having three masts, three sails,
and a mainstay-sail, and carrying thirty-seven people, with two tons of
baggage, freight, etc.* When it is reflected that these large canoes,
often with 5 tons capacity, are hewn from a single log, our marvel at the
skill displayed in their construction is decidely increased. To-day the
custom of painting the bow and stern in elaborate totemic patterns is
rapidly dying out, but formerly it was practiced throughout the whole
coast. The totem was also sometimes indicated by a carving, either
wrought on the spur or secured to it on the top or sides. Vancouver
(1793) found this custom as far south as the Kwakiutl, of Gardner
Channel, British Columbia. Of a canoe which he saw there he says
‘its head and stern curiously decorated with carved work and rude
and uncouth figures in painting.”+

War canoes.—These, in primitive times, are said to have formed a
distinct class in themselves, having been elaborately painted and
decorated, but latterly the voyaging canoes have practically taken their
places, there having been no real difference in point of construction or
size between the war and transporting craft. It is doubtful if any real
distinction could ever have been drawn.

Canoes in general.—There is a marked difference in the canoes of the
northern and southern Indians. it is not so much in the mere outward
appearance as in the shape of the cross-section and in the lines. The
northern canoe is superior in all the points by which we judge their
qualities. At the head of the respective types are those of the Haida
in the north, and of the Makah, of Cape Flattery, Washington Terri-
tory, in thesouth. The former have projecting prows, high, spur-shaped
Sterns, flaring gunwales, and a gracefully rounding or curving cross-
section, although without any distinct keel. The latter have the blunt,
Straight stern, a gracefully curving bow, but a flat bottom, with little
curve in the cross section. This type is heavier, roomier, stronger,
less cranky, and more durable than the Haida type, but the latter is
swifter, handier, and more buoyant. The Haida have in some of their
larger canoes somewhat copied the Makah type for the greater strength

secured. An admirable illustration of this adaptation is seen in the
enormous Haida canoe in the U.S. Natonal Museum (No. 26785), which
is very much like Fig. 171, Plate XxxIv,in appearance. Its dimensions
are as follows: Length, 59 feet; beam, 8 feet; height of stem, 7 feet 3
inches; height of stern, 5 feet 3 inches; height amidships, 3 feet 7 inches.
However much the larger canoes may differ in shape and character, the
light, portable hunting canoes (Fig. 169, Plate xxx1m1) are much the
same throughout the coast.

Before the sea-otter became extinct they were hunted well out at sea,
- the Haida being particularly venturesome and successful, and hence
rich, and respected accordingly. One of their chief sources of revenue
to-day is in the building and sale of canoes, which they tow to Port
Simpson or up into Alaska and sell or trade to their neighbors. The
tendency of the day is in the direction of smaller sizes for the canoes
than formerly.. This is but the natural result of peaceful times, when it
is not necessary to travel in such large parties for mutual protection.
However, the Yakutat and Sitka canoes were never as large as those of
the Haida, as from earliest times the latter have possessed the largest
canoes on the coast. The post of honor in a canoe is at the steering
paddle aft. Usually this position is occupied by a woman or an elderly
man, the steering being accomplished by a few adroit side strokes inter-
jected into the regular process of paddling. In the family canoe there
are few idlers, even the young children wielding paddles and “ working
their passage.”

Canoe Outfit.—This consists of masts, sails, paddles, bailers, and mats.
Ballast of stone is sometimes, though rarely, carried. The masts and
sails have been added since the advent of the whites, the rig being
sprit-sail, and the number of masts varying from one to three. Masts
and sprits are of light cedar wood, and sails, originally of mats, are
now invariably of white cotton sheeting. ‘These canoes will not sail on
the wind, but with a flowing sheet the speed made is astonishing. The
northern type of paddle is that shown in Fig. 165 a, b, and ec, Plate
XXXII; the southern, that in Fig. 166. As may be expected, the north-
ern paddle is ornamented with the design of the owner’s totem. Fig.
167 is a New Zealand paddle, introduced by way of showing the simi-
larity of this in connection with the many other objects common to
these two remote regions. A bailer is imperfectly shown in Plate xxxm.
It is simply a scoop of wood with a short straight handle. Mats are
sometimes carried in the canoes to cover them when hauled up and to
throw over the cargo or household or camping effects in transit. The
Indian is exceedingly careful of his canoe and all that pertains to it.
In landing, a gravel beach is selected, where possible, and the canoe
hauled well up beyond high tide. When it is to remain any time ex-
posed to the weather, it is protected from warping and cracking from
the sun’s heat by a cover of mats or boughs of trees.

Canoe making.—The primitive tools used in canoe construction are
so simple as to excite our surprise. The principal and almost only one
used is the adze of some pattern or other shown in Plate xxItl, Figs.
92, 93, and 94. The logs for the purpose are usually gotten out in the
summer season and rough hewn to somewhat the shape of the canoe in
odd hours about the summer camp—the finishing work being left until
winter. The trees are generally selected near some watercourse and
felled in such a direction as to admit of launching them into tide water.
The log is trimmed where felled to rough dimensions, launched, and
towed to summer camp, where the preliminary work is done. Often by
combined labor numerous logs are gotten out in this way at one time,
made into a raft, and by means of sweeps and sails and by dint of
working the tides brought to the village or to the neighborhood of the
camps. Good trees for canoe purposes are sufficiently rare to make their
selection difficult and expensive in both time and labor. The best wood
for all purposes is the yellow cedar (Chamecyparis Nutkaensis), found on
the Queen Charlotte Islands and in spots around the southern Alaska
boundary. The smaller canoes are made from the Sitka spruce (Picea
Sitchensis), and the very largest from the giant cedar (Thwa gigantea).
The whole process of canoe construction may be briefly described as
follows: The tree is felled with an ax (formerly stone ones were used).
The trimming and,rough hewing is done by wedges and sledges. The
rest of the work is done by patient cutting with an adze. The canoe
being roughly worked out is widened in beam by steaming it with wa-
ter and hot stones placed in the bottom of the canoe, stretchers or
thwarts of gradually increasing sizes being forced in as the wood ex-
pands. The long spur ends in large canoes are neatly scaifed on to
the body with a dovetailed joint and finished down as part of the whole.
The smoothing work on the outside is of{ten-done with a chisel, but usu-
ally the interior of the canoe shows the thipping marks of the adze. The
smoothing work on the exterior to lessen the friction of the water is
furthered by the use of sandpaper, sandstone, or shark’s skin. The
conventional colors used now in painting are black outside and white
inside, with a red strip on the inside of the gunwale running quite around
the canoe and upon the bow and stern spurs. The process of painting
is described in the next chapter. The lines of these canoes are re-
markably fine and good; and«when of considerable size and intelli-
gently handled they are remarkably good sea-boats. Trips are often
made in them to Victoria, British Columbia; and the Kaigani visit the
outlying islands of the Prince of Wales Archipelago in the early sum-
mer in search of birds’ eggs about 25 miles out to sea.

HUNTING AND FISHING.
METHODS OF CAPTURING ANIMALS,

Salmon.—The first run of salmon occurs about the middle of July,
when they swarm in myriads into the mouths of the small fresh-water
298 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

streams. Itis difficult to picture in the mind the abundance of these
fish and the mad abandon with which they hurl themselves over obsta-
cles, wounded, panting, often baffled, but always eagerly pressing on
up the streams there to spawn and die. In some of the pools they
gather in such numbers as to almost solidly pack the surface. When
there is a waterfall barring their progress they may be seen leaping at
the fall endeavoring to ascend it, often as many as six or more being in
the air at once. The flesh at first hard and firm on contact with fresh
water soon loses its color and palatableness, so that the sooner they
are captured the better. The species of the first run vary along the
coast. They are comparatively small, do not remain long, and do
not furnish the bulk of the supply, although at the canneries now
erected as many as two to five thousand have been known to be caught
with one haul of the largest seines. About the middle of August the
Tyee ,or King salmon arrives, the run often lasting the year out.
When they first appear they. are fat, beautifully colored, and full of
life and animation; but soon are terribly bruised, their skin becomes
pale, their snouts hook-shape, their bodies lean and emaciated, and
their flesh soft, pale, and unwholesome. In Wrangell Narrows is a
waterfall of about 13 feet. At high tide the salt water backs up the
stream and reduces this fall to about 8 feet, but never less even at
spring tides, but the King salmon leaps the falls and numbers of them
may be found in the fresh water above. The writer has deposited in
the Smithsonian Institution several instantaneous photographs of leap-
ing salmon taken by himself at this locality, but it is unnecessary to
reproduce them in this connection. ‘The whole of the territory on the
northwest coast adjacent to the Indian villages is portioned out
amongst the different families or households as hunting, fishing, and
berrying grounds, and handed down from generation to generation and
recognized as personal property. Privilege for an Indian, other than
the owner, to hunt, fish, or gather berries can only be secured by pay-
ment. Each stream has its owner, whose summer camp, often of a per-
manent nature, can be seen where the salmon run in greatest abun-
dance. Often such streams are held in severalty by two or more families
with equal privileges of fishing. Salmon are never caught on a hook ;
this method, if practicable at all, being too slow. At the mouth of the
streams they are speared or caught in nets. High up the streams they
are trapped in weirs and either speared or dipped out with dip-nets.
The Indians are beginning now to use Seines and to work for salmon on
shares, but the older ones are very conservative, and cling somewhat to
primitive methods in a matter even so important to them as the capture
of salmon, their chief food supply.

Halibut.—These may be taken at almost any season in certain locali-
ties, while they are more numerous during certain months in others.
The Indians make the subject quite a study, and know just where all
the banks are and at what seasons it is best to fish. Often villages are
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 299

located on exposed sites for no other reason than to be near certain
halibut grounds. This fish varies in size from 20 to 120 pounds, and is
caught only with a hook and line. The type of hook is that shown in
Plate xxx1, and the method of sinking it shown in Plate xxx, Fig. 151.
This fish stays close along the bottom, and is such a greedy feeder as
to be readily caught by the clumsy hook shown. In fishing tor halibut
the canoe is anchored by means of stones and cedar bark ropes. The
bait is lashed to the hook, a stone sinker attached to the line, and the
contrivance lowered to the bottom. Sometimes the upper ends of the
lines are attached to floats and more than one line tended at atime. A
fish being hooked is hauled up, played for a while, drawn alongside,
grappled, and finally despatched with blows of a club carried for the
purpose. It requires no little skill to land a hundred-pound halibut in
a light fishing canoe. <A primitive halibut fishing outfit consists of
kelp-lines, wooden floats, stone sinkers, an anchor line, a wooden club,
and wooden fish hooks. It is impossible with our most modern appli-
ances to compete with the Indians in halibut fishing. With their crude
implements they meet with the most surprising success.

Herring and eulachon.—Herring are found in the summer months in
numerous parts of.the coast, depending on the nature of the feeding
ground. They run in large shoals, breaking the surface of the water,
and attracting in their wake other fish, porpoises, whales, whale ‘ kill-
ers,” flights of eagles, and flocks of surf birds, all feeding either on the
herring or on the same food as that of which they themselves are in
search. They are dipped out by the Indians with nets or baskets, caught
with drag-nets, or taken with the rakes previously described. Hulachon
or ‘‘ candle-fish” run only in the mouths of rivers, particularly the
Skeena, Nass, and Stikine in this region. They are considered great
delicacies, and are dried and traded up and down the coast by the
Indians who are fortunate enough to control the season’s catch..

Cod are caught with the skil hook previously described. Dogfish,
flounders, and other kinds are caught with almost any kind of hook,
there being no especial appliances used or required.

Spawn.—For taking fish eggs that have already been spawned, the
Indians use the branches of the pine tree, stuck in the muddy bottom,
to which it readily adheres, and on which it is afterwards dried. When
dry it is stripped from the branches and stored in baskets or boxes;
sometimes buried in the ground. The spawn gets a pleasing flavor
from the pine. Roe is taken from captured fish and either dried or
buried in the ground to become rank enough to suit the epicurean pal-
ate of the Indian gourmand.

Sea-otter.—The custom in former days was to hunt the sea-otter either
from the shore or in canoe parties. They were shot with arrows from
behind screens when they landed to bask on the sand or on the rocks,
or approached noiselessly by canoe parties when asleep on the water.
300 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

. Very thin light paddles were used, and if the Indian could get near
enough the sleeping animal was harpooned. The common custom was,
however, to hunt in parties. An otter being sighted was surrounded by
canoes in a very large but gradually lessening circle, advantage being
taken of the necessity of the animal to come to the surface to breathe,
when it would be shot with arrows or harpooned from the nearest
canoe. The Tlingit and Haida were not so expert as the Aleut, because
their canoes were not so well adapted to the exposure at sea. In recent
years the few remaining sea-otters have been hunted with fire-arms.
The Indians are poor marksmen, and under the excitement of firing the
instant the otter rises many accidents to their own number have hap-
pened, particularly to those on opposite sides of the circle. Bya curious
rule the otter, and all other game, belongs to the one who first wounds
it, no matter who kills it. As the otter floats when killed, the same
skill is not required as in seal hunting, but so scarce have they become
now, that not more than forty or fifty are killed in a season throughout
the northern coast Indian region.

Seals.—Seals are hunted in practically the same way as just de-
scribed, but from the fact that on account of their bodies not floating
it is necessary to harpoon them before they sink, the percentage of loss
is very large, although they are more abundant than the otter. The
Indians rely to a great extent on shooting them in very shallow water
or on rocky ledges near shore.

On shore the Indians are very poor still-hunters, and luck and abun-
dance of game are large elements in their success. Fur-bearing animals,
such as bear, lynx, land otter, beaver, ete., are generally trapped, al-
though shot whenever chance offers. Breech-loading arms are not
allowed to be sold to the Indians. With
the use of muzzle-loaders we find such
necessaries in the outfit of a hunter as
Figs. 140a and 140), which are powder-
chargers of bone, and Fig. 140¢, which is
a percussion-cap box made from the 2OEA
of a mountain goat.

Deer.—Deer are very abundant, and
form a large item in the food supply of
the region. They are hunted in the
rutting season with a call, which lures
them to the ambushed hunter, when

Fig. 140 abe. they are readily shot. So effective is this
Powper Horn AND CHARGERS. call, that it is not unusual to be able to
(Tlingit. Emmons Collection. ) get a second shot at them in case of first

failure. Stili hunting is very little resorted to, and an Indian seldom
risks wasting a charge until he is somewhat sure of his distance and
chances. They are often captured swimming, and in winter recklessly

slaughtered for their hides when driven down to the shore by heavy
and long-continued snows. The deer-call is made from a blade of grass
placed between two strips of wood, and is a very clever imitation of the
cry of a deer in the rutting season. The wolves play great havoc in
this region with the deer, and it seems remarkable that they exist in
such numbers with so many ruthless enemies.

Mountain goats and sheep.—On the mainland these are shot with very
little difficulty if one can overcome the natural obstacles to reaching
the lofty heights which they frequent.

Bears.—The brown and black bear are the two species quite gen-
erally found in Alaska. Both are hunted with dogs, shot when acci-
dentally encountered, or trapped with dead-falls. The brown bear —
(Ursus Richardsonit) is from 6 to 12 feet long and fully as ferocious as
the grizzly. The hair is coarse, and the skins, not bringing a good price,
are generally kept by the Indians for bedding. This fact, coupled with
the natural ferocity of this species, has led to the brown bear being
generally let alone. An accidental meeting in the woods with one of
them is regarded as a very disagreeable incident by an Indian. When
women and children run across bear-tracks in the woods, in deference
to a generally recognized superstition, they immediately say the most
charmingly complimentary things of bears in general and this visitor
in particular. Petroff gives the origin of this custom as follows:

The bear was formerly rarely hunted by the superstitious Thiinkit, who had been
told by the shamans that it is a man who has assumed the shape ofan animal. They
have a tradition to the effect that this secret of nature first became known through
the daughter of a chief who came in contact with a man transformed into a bear. ~
The woman in question went into the woods to gather berries, and incautiously spoke
in terms of ridicule of the bear, whose traces she observed in the path. In punish-
ment for her levity she was decoyed into the bear’s lair and there compelled to marry
him and assume the form of a bear. After her husband and her ursine child had been
killed by her Thlinkit brethren, she returned to her home in her former shape and nar-
rated her adventures.*

This legend is found in other forms throughout the coast, and occasion
will be taken in another chapter to comment on it further. In conclu-
sion, it may be said that the brown bear are expert fishers and frequent
the streams in the salmon season along their well-beaten tracks, which
form the best paths through the woods.

The black bear (Ursus americanus) is, on the other hand, rather timid
and eagerly hunted, not only for his valuable black skin, but for his
flesh, which, when young and tender, is very palatabie. In the spring
they are readily killed along the edge of the woods, when they come out
to feed on the first sprigs of skunk-cabbage and other plants brought
out by the warm sun. Later in the summer they are found along the
streams, where they feed on the dead and dying salmon.

Taking it altogether, the Indians are expert fishermen but poor hunt-

which the hunting Indians of the interior are famous.
Besides the animals hunted for their skins as men-
tioned, there may be added the fox, wolf, mink, mar-
ten, land-otter, and an occasional Canada lynx and
wolverine on the mainland. The method of dressing
the skin is not different from that of the interior
Indians, so generally described in works of travel.
The skin scrapers or dressers are either of stone or
bone, and of the pattern shown in Fig. 79 h, Plate
xx and Fig. 79k.
Ermine and marnot.—In Figs. 145 a and 145d are
shown two bone trap sticks, to which are fastened
the sinew nooses used in the capture of ermine and
marmot. Those for ermine are somewhat smaller
than those shown in the figure. They are, more-
over, sometimes made of wood instead of bone, and
are elaborately carved in totemic designs. These

LAND-WORKS, HOUSES, VILLAGES.

Dwellings in general on the northwest coast may be classed as the
fortified and the unprotected. These may be either temporary or per-
manent.

LAND-WORKS: FORTIFICATIONS.

In the past century, the form, location, and construction ot villages
have undergone considerable change in this region. The rules or prac-
tices of war were such as to entail the necessity for some form of forti-
fication. Often, in addition to the regular villages, fortifications were
erected near by, into which they might withdraw in time of danger, but
sometimes fortified sites were permanently occupied. Before the advent
of the whites, two considerations of prime importance obtained in the
location of a site for a village, (1) proximity to halibut banks and fish-
ing grounds, and (2) possibility of fortification against attack. Van-
couver says of the Kake villages, at the head of Keku Straits, Kupre-
anoff Island:

They all uniformly were situated on the summit of some precipice, or steep insular
rock, rendered by nature almost inaccessible, and by art and great labor made a
strong defense, which proved that the inhabitants had been subject to the incursions
of hostile visitors. These fortified places were well constructed, with a strong plat-
form of wood, laid on the most elevated part of the rock, and projecting so far from

its sides as to overspread the declivity. The edge of the platform was surrounded
by a barricade raised by logs of wood placed on each other.*

In the narrative of Dixon’s voyage (1787) a sketch is given of a Haida
fortified house on Hippah Island, off the west coast of Queen Charlotte
Islands. He says of it: .

The tribe who inhabit this hippah seem well defended from any sudden assault of
their enemies, for the ascent to it from the beach is steep and difficult of access, and
the other sides are well barricaded with pines and brushwood, notwithstanding
which they have been atinfinite pains in raising additional fences of railsand boards,

so that I should think they can not fail to repel any tribe that should dare to attack
their fortification.*

Captain Dixon further pronounces it as ‘“ built exactly on the plan of
the hippah of the savages of New Zealand.” t

Strong natural defensive positions seem to have been generally
selected along the whole coast. Vancouver (1793) notices this point

* Vancouver, Voyage, Vol. 111, pp. 289, 290. t Dixon, Voyage, p. 206.
303
304 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

among the Bilqula and Kwakiutl.* These were noticed by Mackenzie
in the same year in the same localities.}

Dunn states (1834) of the Sebassa (southern Tsimshian) :

They built their villages chiefly upon high and precipitous rocky islands or prom-
ontories, having steps cut down to the water. This is done to prevent any sudden
attack from the enemy.t

The skill of the Indians in erecting fortifications is well illustrated
by Lisiansky (1804), who aided Baranoff in reéstablishing the Russian
settlement at Sitka after the massacre. In Voyages, page 163, Plate
11, is given a detailed plan and sketch of the palisade fort erected by
the Sitkas. Itis unnecessary to reproduce it here, but in structure and
design it would have done credit to European ingenuity of that date.
Langsdorff (1805) describes the fortifications erected a year later by the
Indians expelled from Sitka as follows:

They have fortified themselves here upon a rock which rises perpendicularly to the
height of some hundred feet above the water. * * * The rock itself is secured
against the attack of an enemy by a double palisade of large trunks of trees stuck
_ close together, measuring from 12 to 15 feet in height, and from 3 to 5 feet in thick-
ness. A natural wall of earth, beyond the palisading, on the side towards the sea,
conceals the habitations effectually, so that they can not be discerned by any ship.$

The only possible access to this fortification is described as on the
northwest side, but the approach was strewn with very large trunks of
trees to make it additionally difficult of access.

TEMPORARY DWELLINGS.

In summer camps, in hunting and fishing, and in canoe trips, the
form of dwelling is temporary in construction.

Summer fishing camp.—Near the mouth of some fresh-water stream
owned by a household or family, where the salmon run thickest, a rough-
ly-built house will generally be found. ‘This varies in size and care of
construction according to circumstances. Usually the frame is light,
and the roof, instead of being made of split boards, is formed by broad
strips of bark which are laid on thus _—~ =~ —~_, and held down by stones"
and cross pieces. The larger kind have a smoke hole, but usually the
fire is built outside, where the smoke assists in curing the strips of
salmon and halibut hung on frames above it.

Tents.—The primitive form of tent for traveling consisted simply of
strips of bark carried in the canoes. To erect the tents two saplings
or branches would be cut, pointed, and stuck in the ground, forked ends
up, with a cross pole resting in the forks. The bark strips would then
be rested against the pole, forming a sloping wall towards the wind.
This half-open tent was airy in form, but would shed the water of a
driving rain. The fire was usually built in front. To-day the Indians

t Mackenzie, Voyages, p. 345, et seq. § Langsdorff, Voyages, Pt. 1, pp. 128,
129,
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 305

use cotton sheeting for a cover in the form of an A tent. Along most of
the water-courses where there is much travel the frames may be seen left
standing near the good camping spots. These latter are selected from
their having a good beach to haul up the canoes, fresh water near, unex-
posed position and proximity to good hunting ground. The cotton
sheeting is stretched taut across the frame and the edges pegged into the
ground. This form of tent was also used in primitive times, mats of cedar
bark fibre or skins of animals forming the tent walls. At these camp sites
are often deposited piles of wood already cut for use. In the short
winter days it often happens that a belated canoe load arrives after
dark. Here they find wood already cut, and they build a fire and warm
up without the necessity of searching in the dark or in the snow for fire-
wood. It is part of the unwritten code that an Indian using such fire-
wood must in the morning replace what he has used by a Similar
amount gathered at his leisure before setting out again on his journey.

HOUSES.

The permanent houses are similar in form and type throughout the
coast, but reach their highest development amongst the Haida. North,
the Yakutat dwellings are but little better than the summer dwellings
of the Haida, while to the south the houses are equal in size but inferior
in artistic construction. In general, houses may be divided into three
classes: (1) those built on the surface of the ground’; (2) those built
on a foundation of logs or slightly raised platform; (3) those raised on
high logs or stilts.

Raised houses.—The last named are found amongst the Kwakiutl
and Bilqula, and their primitive form of construction is fully described
in Mackenzie, Voyages, p. 329, and Vancouver, Voyage, vol 11, pp. 268,
272, 274, and 284. They both visited this region in 1793. According
to Vancouver, amongst the Kwakiutl of Johnstone Strait, there were
dwellings “raised and supported near 30 feet from the ground by per-
pendicular spars of a very large size” with “ access formed by a long
tree in an inclined position from the platform to the ground, with
notches cut init by way of steps about a foot and a half asunder.* This,
however, was only one of several styles of their dwellings. In general,
they were ornamented in front, at the gables, and above the doors, as
now, with hieroglyphic drawings of their totems.

Tlingit dwellings.—Amongst the Tlingit, the permanent dwellings are
as a rule built on a slightly raised foundation of logs, the approach to
the doorway being by three or four raised steps with a platform in front
of the door of the principal houses. This latter is the loafing place,
and where the gamblers congregate for their incessant gambling bouts.
This form of construction is by no means universally adopted, as some
of the dwellings are built on the level of the ground. In any case, the

*Vancouver, Voyage, vol. Il, p. 274.

306 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

level of the door-sill is about that of what may be called the ground floor.
Entering the door, one stands on a platform about 6 feet wide, running
around the four sides of the house. Next, one steps down about 3 feet
upon a ledge the same width, also running around the four sides. The
next level, 3 feet below this, is the solid ground, sometimes bare, some-
times with a board floor. In the center of this the fire burns, the smoke
ascending through a square smoke-hole in the roof in the center of the
building. All houses were formerly without windows, ventilation being
secured by the door and the smoke-hole. If the house is built on the
surface of the ground, the interior is excavated into a kind of cellar, the
ledges being cut in the earth and covered by large hewn slabs of cedar.
These ledges serve not only as sleeping and lounging places, but as
shelves to deposit all sorts of boxes, utensils, etc., belonging to the
family. In the Tlingit dwellings, the fire-place is usually boxed in with
boards, and filled in with stones. When the house is built on the sur-
face of the ground, one enters the door at the level of the ground, and
descends to the lower floor inside. If the house is built on a raised
foundation, the bottom floor or court is usually on the level of the out-
side ground. One mounts to the door, enters, and descends to the
ground inside. Between these two types are slight variations in which
the foundation of logs is not so high, and the interior is dug down only
about 2 or3 feet. Amongst the Tlingit, the interior platform at the level
of the door-sill is sometimes divided into living apartments, or small
state-rooms, so to speak. Lisianski (1804) describes the houses about
Sitka as square in form and spacious, with openings all along the top
about 2 feet in width to let out the smoke. The fire-place was fenced
around with boards, the place between the fire-place and the walls be-
ing partitioned by curtains for the different families living in the lodge-
There were board shelves fixed around inside of the room for the stow.
-age of boxes and utensils.*

The primitive form of construction is not materially different from
that described and illustrated in Plate xxxv. The Tlingit form of front
is shown in Fig. 176, a local characteristic being given te it by the
vertical boards a a at each corner of the front as shown. Throughout
the whole coast, it was somewhat the custom to ornament the fronts with
painted representation of the totem of the chief occupant. To the south
this wasthe general custom. Amongst the Haida, Tsimshian, and Tlin-
git, it was only occasionally practiced. In Plate xxxv various styles
of house fronts are illustrated in connection with the typical method of
house construction.

after Boas. The Haida fronts are rarely ornamented with totemic rep-
resentations.

Totemic and mortuary columns.—It is the custom amongst the Tlingit,
Kaigani, and Tsimshian to erect carved columns in frout of the houses.
These usually stand some feet from the fronts. Amongst the Haida
they are generally in contact with the front, the doorway or entrance
being through a hole in the carved column about three feet from the
ground, into which the occupant appears to dive when he enters. This
form of entrance is shown in Plate xxxv, and is found occasionally
elsewhere, but is rather peculiar to the Haida. It is now, however,
being generally superseded by the European type of doorway. The
carved columns will be described in detail in a subsequent chapter.

Haida permanent dwellings.—Fig. 179, Plate xxxv, represents a Haida
house of the conventional pattern. The posts, gg, hollowed out on the
backs, as shown, to reduce the weight, with carved faces, are firmly
planted in the ground. The upper ends are also hollowed to receive the
enormous log plates, s s, which give strength and solidity to the build-
ing. The carved column, m, at the front of the house, is usually next
erected, as the work up to this point requires the co-operation of many
hands, the gathering being the occasion of a feast and a grand distribu-
tion of presents (a potlatch, as it is called) amongst the participants.
Often, through lack of funds, the work of building a house has to be
postponed, the whole process often requiring several years. The ex-
penses are usually reckoned in blankets, as they are the conventional
gifts on such an occasion. The huge plates and purlines, the hewn
cedar planks, and the logs for posts and carved columns, are gotten out
from the forests with great labor and expense, and are towed to the vil-
lage site, where they are hauled up on skids, and the work of smooth-
finishing begun. Plate Lxx illustrates an animated scene at Fort Simp.
son, British Columbia, where a party of Haida are represented as hauling
up a log on skids in the process of house construction. The relief carving
on the totemic columns and the posts is done either by the owner, if he
be expert, or if he be rich, by others hired or kept in the establishment for
the purpose. The materials being ready, the invited guests assemble
from far and near, and the different timbers are gotten up to the site of
the house. The posts are raised into position by means of rope guys
and props, and firmly planted in the deep holes dug in the ground. The
plates or huge logs which rest on the upr'hts are gotten into position
by what a sailor would cal) technically skids and parbuckles. To de-
scribe the process in detail, imagine the four posts (or, as in Plate Lxx,
Six posts) in Fig. 179 firmly planted in the ground, their heads being
hollowed out as shown. The log (or plate, as it is technically called in
architecture) is rolled to a distance of about 14 feet from theuprightsand
parallel to its final position. The uprights are braced or shored on the
opposite side, while on the adjacent side skids are rested atan angleto
form an incline, up which the plate is, by the combined effort of many,
308 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

gradually rolled. Ropes are rove over the top of the posts under and
over the plate, then back again over the upright. These ropes constitute
the parbuckle, which is designed to take the weight of the log and hold
it in position. Forked sticks are rested against the log with their other
ends in the ground to help the parbuckle take the weight as the plate
is gradually rolled up, the forked sticks being gradually also shifted up
as it rises. By dint of pushing, shoving with poles, and pulling on the
parbuckle, the plate is gotten to the tup of the incline. It is nowa
- question of lifting the dead weight of the log by means of poles and by
pulling on the parbuckle. At last the plate is hauled to the top of the
upright and rolled into the hollow in which it rests. The carved
totemic columns are raised into position by means of poles, props,
and rope guys, and firmly imbedded in the deep hole dug for it in
the ground. The whole process is an occasion of much ceremony,
and the work occupies but a small part of the time, the remainder
being filled in with gambling, dancing, feasting, singing, speech-making,
_ and ceremonial display intended to inspire the visitors and guests with
the wealth and prowess of the host. Judge Swan says:

The self-denial of comforts and even necessaries exercised for many years in the
accumulation of property by man and wife is very remarkable, but, in their estima-
tion, is amply repaid on the occasion of a distribution of the same and the erection of
a decorative column, which in many instances stands in front of an unfinished lodge
frame as a visible monument of the owner’s folly and extravagance. * ~ * The
owner probably lives in the lodge of some relative, or perhaps is dead. It has been
beyond his means to finish his house, but for that he cares little; his vanity has beer
gratified ; his pride satisfied. On the day when he stood presiding over his piles oi
goods and chattels, previous to their distribution amongst his eager and expectant
guests, he had reached the summit of his ambition. * ~ * MHeis thenceforth a
petty chief of the village.

In some of the very latest types of the houses, instead of the corner
posts 77 and the smaller posts r 7 supporting the eaves-plates e e, there
are four posts and two heavy rafters similar to g and s._ In either case
the eaves-plates e, or one similar to s, are beveled to receive the upper
ends of the boards forming the side walls of the house, as shown in w
and adjacent details. The heavy plank frames h/ h and ¢ ¢ are beveled,
as shown in section q, to receive the boards forming the end walls, or
front and back ofthe house. The top purlines jj jj form the supports
for the roof-planking, and are held in place by the superimposed frames
uu. The roofing is formed either of planks or slabs of bark held down
by rocks, beams and ecross-pieces, as Shown in Figure 178. The smoke-
hole kis surmounted by aframe p p carrying a shutter 0, which is closed
in the direction of the wind. This shutter has a motion about the axle
pp. When the wind changes and blows down the smoke-hole, a chain
or rope is pulled and the shutter revolves to the other position against
the wind. As the house faces the channel, and the wind usually draws
up or down it, the shutter works to face one side of the house or the
other. The entrance is shownata. Below, the sketch of the house is
dotted in the form of the excavated interior. The upper ledge or plat-

form is at the level, d; cis the lower platform. The fire, b, burns on
the bare earth, or in a frame-work of boards filled with rocks. It is
here that the family sleep in winter, stretched out on the bare floor
or on mats with feet towards the fire. As stated, the occupants
of such a house are numerous, amounting in some cases to thirty or forty
in all, and the household may embrace a chief, his family, grand-
children, and the families of several of his brothers. Amongst the Kai-
gani most of the houses are built on log foundations, a little above the
ground, and the European form of door is used. In some eases the
carved column is set a few feet off with a small opening in it, but the
real entrance to the house is by a doorway, thus keeping up a semblance
of the ancient custom. The Haida houses are quite generally excavated,
and seldom built on raised foundations. The smaller houses, and not
unusually the more modern houses, consist principally of a frame
erected on four posts, one at each corner.

VILLAGES.

The villages are invariably situated along the shore, and usualiy near
a shelving beach, which admits of easily hauling up the canoes. Often,
through the desire to be near a good halibut fishing bank, a very ex-
posed site is of necessity selected. The houses are usually in a single
row, a few feet above extreme high water, facing toward the beach and
not far back from it. At high water the canoes can be hauled well up.
Between the houses and high-water mark is a space which serves as a
street, with a beaten path near the houses and patches of grass be-
yond. This space serves for hauling up canoes for long periods and
drying fish, as well as the usual purposes of a street. Sometimes the
two rows of houses are built, where the space is contracted, with a
narrow street between the rows. The houses are not very far apart in
the rows, are often in contact, and arranged without regard to rank or
precedence. There are one or more carved columns in front of each
house. These are at first usually painted (formerly daubed with ochre),
but the coat is seldom renewed. Owing to the bleaching effect of the
weather, the columns and houses after a while assume a grayish white
appearance, and become covered with moss. In the weather-cracks moss
and vegetation flourish, giving a very ancient appearance. At the end
of the village is the graveyard, with its variety of sepulchres and mort-
uary columns of ancient and modern form, as shown in Plate It.
Scattered throughout the villages, in front and near the corners of the
houses, are the mortuary or commemorative columns similar to those in
the graveyards. These are pictured in all their variety in Plate 11.

Behind the village, or at one end, are the small sheds in which the
dead are placed.

Names of villages.—Considerable confusion has originated in the
enumeration of villages amongst the Haida and Kaigani by Europeans,
through the different names assigned to the same village. The Indians
310 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

have their own names, but the traders and others often call a village
after the name of the chief; for instance, Kasa-an is popularly cailed
Skowl’s village; the village of Skidegate, Queen Charlotte Islands,
British Columbia, is popularly so called from the name of the heredi-
tary chief; the Haida name is Hyo-hai-ka, but the Tsimshian eall it
Kil-hai.oo. *

Groups of villages.—Kach village practically constitutes a tribe.
There never have been any permanent leagues or associations of vil-
lages to constitute a nation with head ruler, although, for certain rea-
sons of defense or offense, villages have so co-operated temporarily for
mutual benefit or protection. The totemic systems of the Tlingit, Haida,
and Tsmishian kings, in some senses uniform, have often operated to
make the alliance between phratries and totems of different villages in
some measure stronger than the clannish feeling due to close ethnical
affinity. :

Residence.—During the summer but few Indians are found at the
permanent villages. Occasionally a canoe load returns to deposit a
cargo, or to get something needed in the distant summer eamp.
Where the fishing and hunting ground is near the village, it is contin-
ually occupied, but if at a distance there are times when the viilage is
entirely abandoned, although there may be some camps quite near.
Under such circumstances property is entirely safe. Early in the sum-
mer, during the first run of salmon, and when birds’ eggs are to be
gathered, the Indians are widely scattered. Later on they congregate,
but disperse again for the run of King salmon, which lasts well into
December. By Christmas time they have all gathered in, and in the
long winter nights take place all those social and ceremonial gatherings
and feastings of which only a winter’s residence amongst them can give
an adequate idea. Gathered around the blazing fire then are related
those legends and traditions which illustrate their beliefs. Then also
take place those dances, ceremonials, and theatrical performances which
graphically illustrate and perpetuate these traditions, and glorify the
prowess and might of the chiefs and their ancestors.

ARTS AND INDUSTRIES—HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS— PAINTING, DRAWING
AND CARVING—MUSIC.

While the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian are essentially wood car-
vers, this is by no means their only talent. Out of the abundance of
their resources they have not only adapted wood to their every need,
but along with it have developed many other industries. They are, as
well, expert carpenters, basket makers, weavers, and metal workers.
Their tools are crude, but with them they accomplish the most surpris-
ing results. Along with the totemic system, we find thé identification
of the individual with his totem carried out in the carving or painting
of his crest on every article of personal property. The simplest imple-
ment or utensil is ornamented with some pictograph relating to the
legends of the totem to which he belongs. Tattooed on the body,
woven into fabrics, etched on the metal bracelets and ornaments,
painted on the house fronts, drawn on the canoe outfits, emblazoned on
the household boxes, carved on the huge columns—commemorated in
metal, wood, and stone, the totem of the Indian is his earliest and
latest care, yet it is all subservient to the ever-recurring struggle to
live. In the circuit of the seasons a regular routine of duties is ob-
served. In the time not devoted to hunting, fishing, and the procure-
ment of food the various arts and industries are practiced. In the
summer camp odd hours are spent in cutting down trees, collecting furs,
bark, and grasses, roughing out lumber, and in general collecting the
raw materials, which, in the winter’s leisure, they convert into the
various implements, utensils, and finished products for their own use
and for trading purposes.

Raw materials—Various kinds of grasses are gathered, and after
being dried, are dyed and trimmed to finished dimensions. Spruce
roots are boiled until they become pliable, beaten with sticks, and the
fibres picked into threads. The cedar bark gathered for industrial
purposes is from the inside of the outer bark, that for food being
scraped from the trunk itself. The former is soaked in water for
several days, then beaten to make it pliable enough to enable it to be
Stripped into shreds. Fig. 179 is a bone bark-scraper used in removing
the bark from trees, in scraping it down, and in the preliminary process —

of hackling it, which, with the beating it receives from a bone mallet
such as shown in Fig. 179m, separates it into fibres. These two
specimens are in the Emmons Collection.

Other kinds of vegetable fibre, such as wild nettle and a species of
wild hemp, are beaten on the rocks, shredded, and spun with a rude dis-
taff and spindle into a strong twine or thread. Wood for canoes,
houses, columns, paddles, dishes, masks, helmets, spear-shafts, arrows,
floats, hooks, ete., is also gotten out during the summer season and
roughly worked up in camp, the finishing being often left for winter *
leisure. At this time also the trading is done to obtain supplies of
cloth, horn, copper, shell, etc., for the accessories of costumes for ordi-
nary and ceremonial occasions. Fibre of cedar bark, hemp, and goat’s
wool are spun into threads for use in weaving the blankets for which
certain tribes are famous.

Ropes and cords.—The simplest. cords or lines are those of kelp, some-
times single, sometimes laid up into two or more strands for additional
strength, as rope. The neatest ropes and cords, however, are made
from strands of spruce root or bark fibre, the small stuff being dexter-
ously twisted between the hand and thigh. The cordage for raising
large timbers and columns is regularly laid up and twisted like our
own ropes. A few of the most important uses to which the different
varieties of native cordage are put may be enumerated as follows:
Warp for blankets, fishing lines, canoe anchor lines, sheets for sails,
lashings for boxes, grommets for heads of chisels and wedges, head-
dresses, girdles, guys for erecting columns, and diy ving lines for turning
the smoke-hole shutters of the houses.

Mats.—These are made principally of bark and: ’e used for bedding,
for sails, and as covers for canoe cargoes. The coar, er kinds are thrown
over the canoes to protect them from the weathe and as screens for
building temporary camps at nightin traveling. Th use of mats, how-
ever, for sails and tents has given place to the substitute already men-
tioned—cotton sheeting. Amongst the Tlingit, on ceremonial occasions,
the chiefs were carried on mats borne by the slaves from the canoes to
the houses or in embarking in state. Matting from the different parts
of the northwest coast can be distinguished by the pattern and
texture. The method of weaving is that shown in Fig. 38e, Plate X11.
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 313

In general, the mats of the southern Indians are made of soft, red, plia-
ble cedar bark, while those of the northern are stiffer, coarser, lighter
in color, and bordered with black strips interwoven into the texture of
the fabric.

Baskets.—The most expert tribes in basket making are found at the
extremes of the northwest coast. In the south the Makah excel all
others; in the north the Chilkat. The method of weaving is, however,
radically different. Amongst the Makah and other tribes of the Waka-
shan stock the pattern is that shown in Fig. 168, Plate xxx11, described
by Prof. O. T. Mason as follows:

It may be called the ‘‘fish-trap style,” since without doubt the finer basketry is the
lineal descendant of the rude wicker fish-trap. Imagine a number of stakes driven
into the ground pretty close together. A horizontal pole is laid against them in the
rear, and by the wrappings of a withe around the pole and each upright stake diag-
onally on the outside and vertically on the inside a spiral fastening is produced.
This stitch crosses the two fundamentals in front at an angle and the horizontal frame
piece in the rear at right angles, or vice versa.*

Patterns in geometrical figures are worked on the baskets in black,
yellow, drab, red, etc., in dyed straws. Amongst the Haida and the
Chileat and northern Tlingit generally the method of weaving basketry
is by that known as “twining;” that is, twining two woof strands
around aseries of warp strands. This is illustrated in detail in Figs. 37¢
and 37d, Plate x11, which represent the same method used amongst
these Indians for rain hats. Different varieties of Haida and Tlingit
baskets are shown in Plates xxxvi and xxxvu, and Figs. 180 to 189,
inclusive. Fig. 180 of the first-named plate represents a Tlingit
“ coiled” basket, of which Fig. 185 is another variety. This method of
construction differs from the “‘twined” basketry. The bottom of this

‘type is made of a number of straight rods sewed into a rectangular mat,
around which the sides are built up by coiling. ‘The mat-like bottom
is ornamented by sewing on straws longitudinally with stitches wide
apart, so as to show a checker pattern of straw and stitching. This
method of ornamenting the bottom is often pursued over the whole
external surface of the basket.”+ Figs. 185 and 186 are from Pro-
fessor Mason’s article on basketry just quoted. Fig. 186 shows the
method of covering up the coiled work of the sides by an ornamental
arrangement of bark and straw. The concealed texture is “ built up by
whipping a coil of rushes or small splints with splint or birch bark.
* * * The imbricated effect upon the surface is produced by sewing
on little loops of bark and straw, white and brown, with blind stitches,
in such a way as to conceal the manner of attachment.”} (See Fig.
186.) Fig. 180 is a top view and Fig. 186 is a side view of this type of

The method of manufacture of Haida
twined basketry as shown by Mr. J.G. Swan
in a specimen collected expressly for the
National Museum (Fig. 187, No. 88956.
Masset, Queen Charlotte Islands, British
Columbia). Mr. Swan says: “ This style
of making baskets differs from that of
Cape Flattery. There the women sit on
the ground and weave baskets and mats,
both of which rest on the ground. With
the Haidas the mats are suspended on a
frame and the baskets supported on a stick

spruce root used in making ornamental
patterns is produced by soaking it in the
mud. Fig. 188 shows the bottom of the
basket made by the twining process. The

The principal difference between the styles of baskets shown in Figs.
181 and 182 is in the size, the former being broader and flatter than the
latter, which is about 9 inches deep and 64 inches in diameter. Fig. 184
represents a 12 by 12 inch twined circular basket made by tie Chilcat
Indians with embroidered design on the exterior. Fig. 189 represents

is copied by the Haida, who, however, use gaudier colors and are not
quite so expert as their northern Tlingit neighbors. The specimen

Dishes.—In nothing more than in their wooden and horn dishes have
these Indians been conservative. Portlock and Dixon (1787), Marchand
(1791), and Lisiansky (1805), all describe the same types of household
utensils as are found to-day in this region. A few of the general va-
rieties of wooden dishes are shown in Plates XXXVIII, XXXIX, and XL.
These are usually carved from blocks of spruce wood, ornamented with
rows of shells, and have in more or less elaborate detail the totem of
the owner etched or carved upon them. Often the carving represents

~ some legend of the coast; again, a mythical animal. With regard

to the materials of which these native dishes are made, they may be
divided into wooden and horn. In shapes they may be classified as
boat-shaped, flat, square, round, spherical, oblong, and_tub-shaped.
They are all essentially food dishes, but one or two exceptions will here-
after be noted. Inthelarge feasts given by the chiefs, ceremonial dishes
are used, differing in size and character from the ordinary household
variety. Figs. 191 and 192, Plate xxxvVIII, represent the two extremes
of this type of dish, the former being deep, painted in totemic design,
and ornamented with opercula, while the latter is shallow and deeply
carved but not otherwise ornamented. Figs. 195 and 199 represent
another type of ordinary food dish with rounded sides and elaborate
relief carving, the former being a top and the latter a side view.
Uther varieties are discussed in connection with the explanations of
illustrations.

- Fig. 198 is a carved wooden treasure-box. The larger boxes of-
this type are used for transportation, and storage cases for dog-
fish oils, dried fish, and other food supplies, and are often as large as
24 inches in height by 14 inches in breadth. These must be distin-
guished from the household boxes used for the storage of goods and
chattels. These latter are lighter and more beautifully carved and
painted. The former are heavier and clumsier, and, although carved,
are generally soiled with oil and grease. It is in this style of box that
the Indians transport eulachon and other kinds of oil, grease, or fats
in quantities of 100 pounds or more. The chests or household boxes
are described in another paragraph. Boxes of a shape corresponding
to Figs. 195 and 199, also used for food and supplies of grease, are
often as large as 20 inches in length by 12 inches in height. Fig. 209,
Plate XL, represents a tub-shaped dish, ornamented with a totemic de-
sign. A specimen of this kind in the U.S. National Museum measures
32 inches in length and 17 inches in extreme height. It may be noted
in passing that these native wooden dishes are now being rapidly su-
perseded by cheap earthernware purchased from the traders. Dishes
and spoons have been made on the coast from the horns of the mountain
sheep and goat from time immemorial. The Haida have excelled all
others, however, in the art of carving in general and inlaying in shell,
yet curiously enough they have to get the horn by trade with the
Tsimshian and Tlingit on the mainland, as the goats and sheep are only
found in the loftiest parts of the main coast ranges. Fig. 217 repre-
sents an end view of an elaborately carved Haida horn dish, of which a
side view is not unlike Fig. 209. A top view of a similar dish isshown
in Fig. 222. ~
_ Spoons and ladles.—Plates XLI and XLtit illustrate a sufficient variety
of spoons to give an idea of how elaborately so simple a household
article as this is carved and ornamented. The first mentioned plate
shows a variety of horn spoons, Fig. 218 being a representative one in
318 - REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

point of size, although it is severely plain and unornamented. Looking
at a horn of a mountain sheep it seems difficult to conceive how the Indians
can get so large a spoon out of such a curled and unpromising looking
object. The bowl of the spoon comes from the largest part; the handle
runs the full length to the tip, and is afterwards straightened out by
steaming it. In general, spoons are shaped by steaming in a wooden
mould made in two pieces, and scored out inside to the required shape.
This type of great horn spoon is usually elaborately and deeply carved |
in totemic design, and sometimes inlaid with abalone shell. They are
preserved as heirlooms iu the families and considered of great value.
A not uncommon type of spoon is shown in Figs. 210, 212, 213, and
221, the bowl being trom the horn of a mountain sheep and the handle a
mountain goat horn, elaborately carved in a legendary or totemic de-
sign. The handle is very ingeniously secured to the bowl by a sort of
tongue and groove rivetted through with copper. The significance of
the carvings on the handles of those shown in the plate, as far as known
to the writer, is given in the explanation of the figures. The spoons
shown in Figs. 211, 214, and 219 are made entirely of the horns of the
mountain goat, the bowls being formed by splitting the horn at the
base and rolling it out flat by steaming and bending it. Fig. 220 is a
plain sheep-horn spoon, similar in shape to the wooden one shown in
Fig. 238. The long, flat putty-knife or spatula-shaped objects shown
in Plate XLII are berry spoons. or ceremonial feast spoons, made of wood
and carved or painted in totemic design. These are shown in different
views, well illustrating the variety of shapes. Fig. 224 of the pre-
ceding plate represents a pair of spoons of this type carved from whale-
bone and obtained at Sitka, Alaska. A most elaborately carved pair of
wooden ceremonial spoons in the collection resemble the orca or
whale-killer. Other types of ordinary wooden spoons are shown in
Figs. 233, 237, 238, and 239. Fig. 274, Plate LI, illustrates a wooden
ceremonial spoon of enormous size found amongst the Haida, the
bowl having a capacity of two quarts. This is used in the ceremonies
attending the initiation of young men into°the responsibilities of
rank, when the novice must publicly drink to the last drop the contents
of the bowl consisting of fish oil, without removing the spoon from
his lips. The exact nature of this ceremony is not understood by the
writer, but this use for such a large spoon has been explained to him
by several people well versed in Haida customs. Fig. 201, Plate
XXXIX, represents a carved wooden oil ladle or spoon.

Household boxes or chests.—These are for the stowage or packing away
of ceremonial paraphernalia and the goods and chattels of the household.
They vary in size and shape, as shown in Plate LI. .

The oblong chests are simply great wooden boxes with heavy bottoms
and peculiarly shaped lids. The sides of these are made either in two
or in four pieces. When made in two pieces a thin wide piece of cedar
is bent at right angles by means of hot water, forming a side and an end,

above the box, two figures or faces may be seen. The upper one with
the rows of teeth and protruding tongue is Hoorts, the bear. The two
small oblong figures, one in each upper corner, represent the ears of
the bear; the lower figure on the lid the face and flippers of Kye, the
sea-lion: also seen in the handles on each side of the box. In the latter
the sea-lion has in his mouth the salmon. The face on the side of the
box is that of Hoorts, the bear, having in his mouth the hunter. This
legend is explained in Chap. VII. The oblong figures in each corner
are the paws of the bear. It should be mentioned here that in the
Haida drawings an eye is placed in the breast, in the ear, paw. tail,
etc., of figures, presumably on the belief that each member of the body
has the power of looking out for itself or controlling its own move-
ments. Cat. No. 89000, U.S. N. M. Haida Indians, Queen Charlotte

a similar piece forming the opposite side and end, and the joints secured
by pegs or dowels. Where four pieces are used the corners are secured -
either by dove-tailing or by pegging. The bottom is made in a separate
piece and pegged to the sides and ends. The top is slightly arched at
the crown and bevelled on the under side to fit over the chest. Some-
times the top is flat and as thin as the sides, the edges having a broad
strip running around them to fit over the box. Another type of house-
hold box is about 18 irches square by 24 inches high, as shown in Fig.
272, Plate L1, which also shows the method of cording. The top and
bottom are made in somewhat similar shape of separate pieces. Thesides
are of a single wide thin piece of cedar, which is scarfed and deftly bent
three times at right angles by steaming and hammering, with very little
appearance of breaking at the bends, and pegged at the fourth corner,
making a neat and tight joint. These boxes and chests are either carved
or painted, or both, in totemic design, and are very elaborate and or-
namental. A smaller and more handy type of wooden box is shown in
Plate XLil, which has a use, at times, other than that as a household
utensil, viz, in receiving the cremated ashes of the dead. Its use asa
funeral box is shown in Plates Lxi1v and Lxv, Figs. 340, 343, and 348.
A beautifully carved and polished Haida black slate box is represented
in Plate xtiv. It is purely a work of art, and as such is a splendid
illustration of the skill of these Indians in stone carving. The joints are
made with wooden dowels and further secured with fish glue.

Cradles.—These are vow rarely found, the child being carried slung
in a shaw] or blanket over the back in the usual Indian fashion. Dixon
41787) describes the primitive cradle which he saw amongst the Haida
and Tlingit as follows:

Three pieces of bark are fastened together so as to form a kind of chair} the infant,”
after being wrapped in fur, is put into this chair and lashed so close that it van not
alter its posture even with struggling, and the chair is so contrived that when a
mother wants to feed her child, or give it the breast, there is no occasion to release it
from its shackles. Soft moss is used by the Indian nurse to keep the child clean.*

Lisiansky mentions the wife of a chief coming on board his ship (1805)
earrying her childina basket. At the present day a canvas or blanket
hammock is sometimes used, in camp or indoors, to rock the baby to
sleep.

Paints.—As previously mentioned, the different kinds of paints used
by the Indians in this region are chareval, roasted and- burnt fungus,

- white, red, and brown ochres, lignite, cinnabar, berry juice, spruce sap,
and various other kinds of vegetable compounds. For tattooing and
painting the face and body black, charcoal and lignite are used. Oil is.
mixed with all paints used on the body. Where lignite is used on wood,
or for other purposes of a permanent nature, itis ground dry with salmon
eggs, first chewed with cedar bark. This gives consistency to the paint

* Dixon, Voyage, p. 239.
320 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

and makes it stick well. A fungoid growth from the hemlock tree by
various treatment becomes yellow, red, or black. When decayed to
a powdery consistency, it is yellow; when roasted, it is red; and .
when charred, black. The Chilkat get the brilliant yellow for their
blankets from a kind of moss called sekhone. Paint-brushes have been
described in Chap. v, and are illustrated in Plate xty. The stone
mortars and pestles for grinding paint are similar to those shown in
Figs. 337 and 339, Plate Lx, for preparing native tobacco.

Metal working.—The tools with which the Indian artisan works out
the surprisingly well-finished metal ornaments and implements of this
region are simple and few in number. For bracelet making the silver-
smith has a hammer, several cold chisels, and an etching tool which is
merely a sharpened steel point.or edge. Improvised iron arivils replace
the stone implements of this kind doubtlessly used in former days. The
details of bracelet making are given in Chapter Iv. Copper is beaten
into the required shapes. Steel tools now used are very deftly tem-
pered and sharpened by the native artisan, who retains the primitive
form of his implement or tool, and merely substitutes the steel for the
former stone blade or head. The ingenuity which the Indians show
in adapting iron and steel to their own uses is but one of the many
evidences of their cleverness and intelligence.

Lumber and wood-work.—Incidental to the description of tools, houses,
canoes, etc., allusions have been made to the expertness of the Indians
in getting out lumber in the rough from the forests. The tools employed
in wood-work have been described, but it is a never-failing source of
wonder to Europeans that they can accomplish so much with so little.
Portlock (1787) observes:

It is very surprising to see how well they [Tlingit] will shape their boards with
the shocking tools they employ; some of them being full 10 feet long, 24 feet broad,
and not more than an inch thick. *

It is, however, still more surprising to see the exquisite finish
wrought on the rattles, head-dresses, masks, etc., in the relief carving
for which these Indians of the north are famous.

PAINTINGS, DRAWINGS, AND CARVINGS.

The pictographic art of these Indians is illustrated in nearly all the
accompanying plates. A few details need to be added to explain the
significance and trace the origin of the designs so lavishly bestowed
upon nearly every article of personal and household property. The
early voyagers were much struck by the artistic abilities of these peo- ~
ple, and Dixon (1787) voices this feeling when he says of the Tlingit
and Haida:

Many of these carvings are well proportioned and executed with a considerable de-

gree of ingenuity, which appears rather extraordinary amongst a people so remote
from civilized refinment. t

no other significance than the practice in idle hours of an art in which

they were all striving to attain excellence. Some, outstripping others,

ings on the rocks are in the nature of drawings, as they appear also in
painted figures on the simpler objects, but in the paintings on wood the
patterns are very much more elaborate than those simple etchings on
the rocks, as shown, for instance, in the carved and painted figures on
the chest and box in Plate LI. In their paintings the favorite colors
used are black, light green, and dark red. Whether produced in paint-
ing, tattooing, or relief-carving the designs are somewhat conventional.
However rude the outline, there are for some animals certain conven-
tional signs that clearly indicate to the initiated what figure is meant.
With the brown bear it is the protruding tongue; with the beaver and
wolf it is the character of the teeth; with the orca, the fin; with the
raven, the sharp beak; with the eagle the curved beak, ete. Certain
groupings or figures are also generally recognized as portraying certain
well-known legends, such, for instance, as the ‘bear and the hunter”
(Plates XXXV, XLI, and XLIv); the “raven and the moon” (Plate xxxv),
etc., which will be explained hereafter. In the interweaving of colors
to form a totemic pattern or design, as in the Chilkat blankets, the
Indians attained the greatest perfection in their art up to their contact
with the whites. Since then the carvings of the Haida in black slate
may be said to show the height which their art has now attained.

Drawings and paintings.—In plate xx, and in Figs. 278, 279, 296, and
297, the crude sculpturing on the rocks near Fort Wrangell are shown.
In Plates rv and v various tattooing devices are illustrated. Indeed, in
nearly every plate some form of totemic pictograph is represented, and
it only remains to explain the significance of some of the figures.
Plate Lit is reproduced from illustrations in the “* West Shore,” August,
1884, accompanying an article by Judge J. G. Swan, of Port Townsend,
Washington Territory. The drawings were made by Johnnie Kit-Elswa,
the young Haida interpreter, who accompanied Judge Swan on a trip to
the Queen Charlotte Islands, in 1883. It may not be out of place here
to say that, in the estimation of the writer, there is no more competent
authority on the ethnology of the northwest coast than Judge Swan,
and he is particularly well informed in the matter of coast Indian my-
thology and folklore, a branch of which subject the writer can only
touch on in this connection. It is to be hoped, however, that a syste-
matic Governmental investigation will be undertaken in the next few
years, for it will soon be too late to gather the materials needed. Fig.
280, Plate LI, represents the orca, or whale-killer, which the Haida
believe to be a demon called Skana. Judge Swan says that, according
to the Indian belief: :

He can change into any desired form, and many are the legends about him. One
which was related to me was that ages ago the Indians were out seal-hunting. The
weather was calm and the sea smooth. One of these killers, or black-fish, a species
of porpoise, kept alongside of a canoe, and the young men amused themselves by
throwing stones from the canoe ballast and hitting the fin of the killer. After some

pretty hard blows from these rocks the creature made for the shore, where it
grounded on the beach. Soon a smoke was seen, and their curiosity prompted them

HAIDA SLATE-CARVING, REPRESENTING THE ‘‘ BEAR-MOTHER.

Fig. 263b. This specimen is also shown in Plates XLVII and L. The legend is
given in Chapter V, under the subject of bears. The Haida version of
it is as follows:

A number of Indian squaws were in the woods gathering berries when
one of them, the daughter of a chief, spoke in terms of ridicule of the
whole bear species. The bears descended on them and killed ail but
the chief’s daughter, whom the king of the bears took to wife. She
bore him a child half human and half bear. The carving represents
the agony of the mother in suckling this rough and uncouth offspring.
One day a party of Indian bear hunters discovered her up a tree and
were about to kill her, thinking her a bear, but she made them under-
stand that she was human. They took her home and she afterwards
became the progenitor of all Indians belonging to the bear totem.
They believe that bears are men transformed for the time being. This
carving was made by Skaows-ke’ay, a Haida. Cat. No. 78117, U.S. N.

to ascertain the cause, but when they reached the shore they discovered, to their sur-
prise, that it was a large canoe, and not the Skana that was on the beach, and that a
man was on shore cooking some food. He asked them why they threw stones at his
canoe. ‘You have broken it,” said he, ‘‘and now go into the woods and get some
cedar withes and mend it.” They did so, and when they had finished the man said,
“Turn your backs to the water and cover your heads with your skin blankets, and
don’t you look till I call you.” They did so, and heard the canoe grate on the beach
as it was hauled down into the surf. Then the man said, “Look, now.” They looked,
and saw the canoe just going over the first breaker and the man sitting in the stern;
but when it came to the second breaker it went under and presently came up outside
of the breakers a killer and not a canoe, and the man or demon was in its belly.
This allegory is common among all the tribes on the northwest coast, and even with
the interior tribes with whom the salmon takes the place of the orca, which never
ascends the fresh-water rivers. The Chilkat and other tribes of Alaska carve figures
of salmon, inside of which is the full length figure of a nude Indian. * * *
Casual observers, without inquiry, will at once pronounce it to be Jonah in the fish’s
belly, but the allegory is of ancient origin, far antedating the advent of the white
man or the teachings of the missionary.”

Fig. 281 represents the raven and the fisherman. The same authority
gays:

Hooyeh, the raven, had the mischievious propensity of descending into the ocean
and investigating the fishing-lines of Houskana, the fisherman, and stealing both
bait and fish. At last Houskana, tired of this work, put on a magic hook to ascertain
who his enemy was at the bottom of the sea. The raven was caught, and when the
fisherman hauled in his line the rayen resisted by pressing his feet and wings against
the bottom of the fisherman’s canoe. But Houskana was the stronger and pulled the
raven’s beak entirely off, and, seizing the raven, took him ashore to find out who he
was, for, as soon as his beak was pulled off he changed to a man, covering his head
with his skin mantle so that nothing but his eyes could beseen. The fisherman tried
in vain to make him uncover his face. At last one of the young men took a handful
of filth and rubbed it in the raven’s eyes. This made him throw off his mantle, and
then they saw that it was the Hooyeh. This made the raven so angry that, in re-
venge for this indignity, the raven and his friends, the crows (Kaltzda), have ever
since annoyed the Indians by soiling their canoes and eating all their fish.”

Fig. 282 represents the ‘‘ Man in the Moon.” According to Judge
Swan:

Koong, the moon, discovered Leihlinga, the man, about to dip his bucket in the
brook for water, so it sent down its arms or rays and grabbed the man, who, to save
himself, seized hold of a big solal bush (Gaultheria shallon), but the moon being
more powerful took man, bucket, and bush up to itself, where they have ever since
lived and can be seen every full moon when the weather is clear. The man isa
friend of T’kul, the spirit of the winds, and at the proper signal empties his bucket,
causing rain upon the earth.

Fig. 283 represents the raven (Hooyeh) in the belly of the whale
(Koone), Judge Swan explains it as follows:

The Haidahs are not whalemen, like the Makahs of Cape Flattery, and I never
knew of their killing a whale: but occasionally a dead one drifts ashore, having been
killed by whalemen, or sword-fish, or orc (killers). The Haidahs do not care to
look for natural causes, but adopt the mythological dogma that the raven goes into
the whale’s belly, which, frantic with pain, rushes ashore, while the invisible Hooyeh
walks quietly out and is ready for another adventure.
324 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Fig. 284 represents Hooyeh, the mischievous raven that possesses the
power of changing itself into countless forms, and which has, from the
creation of the world, been the benefactor of mankind, but which like-
wise delights in playing pranks. Endless legends are told of his ad-
ventures.

Fig. 285 represents cirrus clouds:

The center figure is 7’kul, the wind spirit. On the right and left are his feet, which
are indicated by long streaming clouds; above are the wings, and on each side are
the different winds, each designated by an eve, and represented by the patches of
cirrus clouds. When 7’kul determines which wind is to blow, he gives the word and
the other winds retire. ‘The change in the weather is usually followed by rain,
which is indicated by the tears which stream from the eyes of T’kul.

These legends illustrate how pregnant with meaning is every carving
and pictograph of this prolific people, and what work must be embodied
in the task of tracing them out and comparing them with those of ad-
jacent regions. No idea of the ethnical affinities of the various stocks
can be formed without comparative mythological study, and the sooner
the work is undertaken the better.

Carvings.—Fig. 286 is a carved wooden rattle, which is pictured in
other positions in Figs. 287, 288, and 290, Plate Liv. According to
Judge Swan, the carving on the breast of the bird represents the
sparrow-hawk, the bird itself representing Hooyeh, the raven. The
tail of the raven is carved to represent a bird’s head, carrying in its
beak a frog. The frog is supposed to possess a subtle poison in its
head, which, when sucked out, enables a medicine man to work bad
spells. The figure on the back is Oolalla, or Ka-ka-hete, the whist-
ling demon, who lived in the mountains and was once traveling in his
canoe when he was capsized and nearly drowned. He swam ashore
and ran into the woods for shelter. He occasionally descended to the
villages and stole the children, which he took into the woods and ate.
Ka-ka-hete afterwards turned into a land-otter. This type of rattle is
found quite generally among all the northern tribes, and is carried by
the chiefs in the ceremonial dances. (See Plate 1x.) The carved col-
umns in front of the houses may be divided into two classes, totemic
and commemorative.

Totemic columns.—These are the very tall ones erected in front of the
houses, and are generally sarmounted by the clan-totem of the chief
occupant. Those below may represent the totem of his wife (and hence
of his children), or illustrate some legend intimately connected with or
referring to the totem of the owner. Some columns are purely legendary,
but. refer to the totem of the owner, and are in this sense totemie.
Amongst the Tlingit the phratry totem often surmounts the column
with the clan and other totems represented below it. None but the
wealthy can afford to erect these carved columns, and the owner of one
is thereby invested with so much the more respect and authority that
he becomes, as the head of the household, a petty chief in the village.
As heretofore and hereafter described, the ambition of a life centers in

the endeavor to accumulate enough property or wealth to enable a free-
man to rise to this dignity of a petty chief. A great deal of mystery
has been thrown around these pictographic carvings, due to the igno-
rance and misconception of some writers and the reticence or deliberate
deception practiced by the Indians themselves. They are in no sense
idols, but in general may be said to be ancestral columns. The legends:
which they illustrate are but the traditions, folk-lore, and nursery tales:
of a primitive people; and, while they are in some sense childish or
frivolous and at times even coarse, they represent the current of human
thought as truly as do the ancient inscriptions in Egypt and Babylonia,
or the Maya inscriptions in Yucatan. The meaning of a few of these
columns may, by inference, be taken to represent the general character
of all.

In Plate xxxv, Fig. 179, is a carved column in front of the model of
a Haida house. The surmounting figure represents Hoots,* the brown
bear, which is the totem of the head of the household who erected it.
At the bottom is Tsing, the beaver, the totem of the wife and children.
Above it is the figure of the “‘ bear and the hunter,” already alluded to.
According to Judge Swan, the hunter Toivats on one occasion visited
the house of the King of the Bears, who was absent. His wife being
at home, he made love to her. When the bear returned he found his
wife in confusion and accused her of infidelity, but she denied it. She
went regularly to get wood and water, and the bear, still suspicious,
one day fastened a magic thread to her dress. On following it up he
found her in the arms of the hunter, whom he forthwith killed, as in
the pictograph. Whether or not this legend originated in the confusion
arising from a failure to distinguish between one of the bear totems
and a real bear, it is impossible to say, but for our purposes as a carv-
ing it illustrates three points: first, that as a legend it refers to the
bear totem; second, that it warns wives to be faithful to their hus-
bands; and third, it indicates a belief, on the part of these Indians, in
the possibility of human relations with animals, which, as shown in
Chapter I11 must of necessity precede a belief in totemism itself.

Above the “bear and hunter” is Tetl, the great raven, having in his:
beak the new moon and in his claws the dish containing fresh water,
illustrating the common and familiar legend of the creation:  Tetl, the
benefactor of man, stole from his evil uncle Kaunk,t} the enemy of man,
the new moon, Aung, which he had imprisoned in a box, and also got
fresh water by strategy from the daughter of Kaunk, to whom he made
love, and, deceiving her, stole a dish of fresh water and flew with it
out the smoke-hole of Kaunk’s house. Above the raven are four disks

*In the Kaigani dialect the brown bear is hoots ; wolf, howootz ; hawk, howot, and
hair seal, howoot. By inflection and aspiration these names are pronounced so dif-
ferently as to leave no room for mistaking one for another. The black bear is tan,
the same as in the Skidegate dialect of the Haida language.

t By some Kaunk is identified with the eagle in the creation legend (Boas) and by
others with the wolf (Veniaminoff).
326 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

called skil. These appear also on the top of several ceremonial grass
hats and wooden helmets and batons, illustrated in the accompanying
plates. Their exact significance is uncertain, but the number of these
skil disks is in general an index of the rank, wealth, and standing of
the chief or owner. It is stated on some authorities and disputed on
others, that each disk commemorates some meritorious act of the owner,
such as the giving of a great potlatch, or the gaining of a victory over
anenemy. In this sense it indicates the right of the owner to the
enjoyment of the respect and esteem of the tribe. It is also stated
that the holes pierced in the lobes of the ear and the disks worn on the
ceremonial hat also correspond to this same number. The difference of
opinion is doubtless due to the variation in the custom amongst differ-
ent stocks. The form of carving may be borrowed without the signifi-
cance being understood or remembered. The weight of evidence would
seem to favor the belief that each disk or skil had the significance indi-
cated, that is, of commemorating some deed of prowess of the possessor.

Plate Ly., Fig. 292, represents another column which may be taken
asatype. It is found at the Kaigani village of Kasa-an, Skowl Bay,
Prince of Wales Island, Alaska. The top group represents the head
of a European, with whitened face and long, black whiskers, flanked on
either side by two figures representing children in sitting posture,
wearing tall hats. These hats in Kaigani are called Hat cachanda,
and each have four skil. The group represents the following legend,
either commemorating an actual occurrence or else being a nursery
tale originally invented to frighten refractory children, becoming in
time, through repetition and misconception, a veritable tradition. Many
years ago the wife of a chief went out in a small fishing canoe, with
her two children, near the summer camp to get the pine boughs, on which
salmon spawn is collected. She drew up her canoe on the beach, and
warned the children not to wander off. On her return they had dis-
appeared. She called to them, and they answered her from the woods
with voices of crows. Always when she sought them, two crows
mocked her from the trees. The children never returned, and it was
said that the white traders had kidnapped them and carried them off
in their ship. The face with the beard represents the trader, and the two
figures the kidnapped children. The figure next to the top, with the
instrument in his claws across his breast, represents the crane (he ko),
and the legend, or rather an incident in a legend, is roughly as follows:
The crane was formerly an expert with tools, but they were stolen from
him by a mischievous character, (Z’skan-ahl), and ever since he
has been bewailing his fate. The cry which the crane now utters is,
“T want my tools.” The next figure below is hoots, the bear, holding
between his paws the butterfly. At the creation, when the great Teil,
the benefactor of man, was looking for fairland for man to occupy, the
butterfly hovered over his head as he flew. When he came to the
country now occupied by the Haida, the butterfly pointed with his

examples of native carving to be found in New Zealand. The precise
object of the tiki is uncertain, but the protruding tongue of the upper
figure seems to show that it is one of the numerous defiant statues
which abound in the islands. The natives say that the lower figure
represents Maui the Atui who, according to Maori tradition, fished
up the islands from the bottom of the sea.”

proboscis to the good lands, and said: ‘‘Where the bear is there are
salmon, herbs, and good living;” so that accounts for how the Haida
came to the Queen Charlotte Islands, and why bears are so abundant.
This is similar to the story told Judge Swan by EHdniso of Masset, .
British Columbia. The next figure is the giant spider sucking the
blood and killing a man. One of the numerous adventures of 7’skan-
ahl was to kill the giant spider, which was such a mortal enemy to
man. Z’skan-ahl overcome the spider and threw him into the fire, but
instead of burning he shriveled up and escaped as a mosquito, carry-
ing away with him a small coal of fire in his proboscis. Now instead
of killing men he can only suck a little blood, but in revenge he leaves
a coal of fire inthe bite. My informant, a Kaigani, stated that it would
take three days to relate all the adventures of T’skan-ahl. The lowest
figure is Koone, the whole representing the totem of the owner of the
column.

The key to all the carvings is found in the legends of the Indians.
Often their significance is lost; often individual eccentricity leads an
Indian to make a carving of which he alone knows the meaning; often
only the older Indians are well informed enough to tell off-hand what a
carving means. These causes, combined with the indifference of the
younger generation and the sensitiveness and reticence of the older,
makes it extremely difficult to arrive at the significance of the figures.
Often they concoct stories to mislead an inquirer, and laugh in their
sleeve at the credulity shown. Until a general collection of the legends
of the coast is made we must remain content with selecting a few types,
as in the foregoing, to illustrate the motive and significance of these
remarkable carvings.

Commemorative columns.—There are two classes of these (1), com-
memorative proper and (2) mortuary. It has been explained, in the
description of Fig. 292, that the upper group of figures commemorates
a real or supposed incident in the kidnapping of two Indian children
by the white traders. It is the generally accepted opinion that these
columns are in no sense historical, but purely ancestral or totemic.
This claim is entirely too sweeping. Fig. 293 shows the details of a
column erected in front of the feast house of the famous Kaigani
Chief Skowl at Kasa-an. This is in the rear of the living house,

_on the back street, so to speak. In front of the latter is his totemic
column, a tall, slender, finely carved one, surmounted by his totem, the
eagle, resting on seven disks or skil, as shown in Plate m1. The feast
house column (lig. 293) is surmounted by Skowl’s crest, the eagle.
Just below it is a carved figure of a man with right hand uplifted and
index finger pointing to the sky. It signifies that in the heavens God
dwells—the God of the white man. Below this is the representation
of an angel as conceived by the Indians from the ‘description of the

whites, and then comes a large figure intended to picture a Russian
missionary with hands piously folded across the breast. This group
328 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

of the figure with uplifted hand, the angel, and the missionary, commem:
orates the failure of the Russian priests to convert Skow!’s people to their
faith, and was erected in ridicule and derision of the religion of the white
man. Below this group is a magnificent carving of a spread eagle, and
at the bottom of the column a figure intended to represent one of the
early traders on the coast. Skowl was always an enemy to the mis-
sionary and resisted their encroachments to the last, being remarkable
for his wealth, obesity, and intemperate habits. He weighed at the
time of his death, in the winter of 1882~’83, considerably over 300
pounds. As a young man, his physical prowess, wealth, and family
influence, made his tyrannical rule at Kasa-an one long to be re-
membered, as he did much to keep his people to the old faith and to
preserve amongst them the manners and customs of his forefathers.
Plate LXVilis a sketch of this chief lying in state in his lodge at Kasa-an
village, from a photograph taken by the writer in 1885. To illustrate
further the nature of some of these commemorative columns, it may be
well to mention here the case of Chief “ Bear Skin,” of Skidegate, Queen
Charlotte Islands, British Columbia, as cited by Judge Swan. “ Bear
Skin,” on his return from a visit to Victoria, British Columbia, had
erected in front of his house two wooden effigies of Judge Pemberton
of that city to show his contempt for him as a magistrate for putting
him in the lockup at Victoria. In the Berlin Museum is a small slate
carving, illustrated in Fig. 275, Plate L1, which commemorates the
prowess of a certain medicine man who came up to Skidegate from
Klue village to work his charms on two dead men. He was observed
by numerous witnesses to squat upon their graves, and by invoking
the power of his yakes with rattles, masks, and songs, to raise them
from the dead. Coming to life, they clung to him as in the image.
This incident is of course vouched for by reliable witnesses, but no
further testimony is needed to insure its acceptance as gospel by the
Indians than that it should be thus carved in slate. It lifts the story
to the first rank as a tradition to be handed down as long as the image
shall recall it or the Indian mind cherish the recollection of it. It can
not be claimed that a good case has been made out in the illustrations
here cited to show that these columns and carvings are ever historical
in the strict sense of the word, but they are, nevertheless, at times com-
memorative of certain real or supposedly real incidents, and the state-
ment that they are never historical at least needs qualification.
Mortuary columns.—A broad distinction is drawn here between columns
that in themselves form a mode of sepulture and those which are com-
memorative and erected at some distance from the site of the grave in
which the body isinterred. The former are described in detailin Chapter
X11, on Mortuary Customs; the latter are in imitation of the former, and
preserve the shadow of the primitive mode of sepulture just as to-day
the funeral urn on a modern grave is symbolical of the old custom of
cremation. These are illustrated in Fig. 1, Plate 11, Fig. 179e, Plate
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 329

XXXV, and in Plates LV, LXTv, and LXIX, as well as in the genéral views of
Kasa an village. They are erected usually near the corner of the house
at one side, and consist, as a rule, of a short stout post or column sur-
mounted by a carved representation of the crest or totem of the de-
ceased. The erection of these takes place at the ceremony known as
the “ elorification or elevation of the dead,” described in Chapter XIII.
After the body has been entombed it is incumbent on the heir of the
deceased, if the latter has been a person of any importance, to make a
feast and erect one of these commemorative columns. In the southern
part of the Queen Charlotte Islands a very common form of this column
is a short stout post with a sign-board-like square formed of split planks
earved on the outer face. This kind is rare to the north, and not seen
at all amongst the Kaigani, as far as known to the writer.

The decay of totemic carving.—Amongst the northern Tlingit these
carved columns of all kinds have largely disappeared. At Sitka only
the stumps of the ancient ones are now found. Wherever the mission-
aries have gained influence with these Indians the totemic columns
have gradually disappeared and the old ways been given up. Of the
Tlingit villages which have retained many of the primitive customs.
Tongass (Tunghaash) is the most representative. Kasa-an stands at
the head of the Kaigani and Skidegate of the Haida villages in this
respect. Wars, evidemics, and emigration have reduced the population
to such an extent that former sites have been abandoned and the Indi-
ans are gradually concentrating into a few villages. Graves, ruins,
decaying houses, grass-grown village sites, graphically picture the re-
sults of the contact of the coast Indians with our civilization.

Slate carvings.—The slate from which the elaborate Haida earvings
are made is obtained at the Slate Creek, Queen Charlotte Islands. It
has the desirable quality of being soft and easily carved when freshly
quarried, and of hardening and taking a polish after exposure to the
weather for some time. The general range of these carvings in boxes,
dishes, pipes, and models is shown in Plates XLIV, XLVII, and XLVII.
Sometimes highly polished copper and the iridescent shell of hali-
otis, and sometimes bone or ivory, are inlaid to represent eyes, teeth,
ete. The finest specimen of Haida sculpture known to the writer is
that illustrated in Plates xL1x and L. Numerous other kinds of carv-
ings in bone, ivory, and slate, used as talismans or doctor’s charms are
‘not illustrated here, bein g left for separate treatment under the head of
Shaman Paraphernalia and and Shamanistic Rites.

Singing.—While in recent years, in the decay of the ceremonial in-
stitutions of the Indians of this region, the custom of singing has some-

“In Pilling’s Bibliography of North American Languages is mentioned a manu-
script of 500 pages in Russian and Tlingit of vocabularies, texts, sentences, songs,
etc., in the Tlingit language of Sitka. Unfortunately this manuscript was inac-
cessible, being in the hands ofits author, Mr. Alphonse Pinart.
330 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

what died out, in early days they were passionately addicted to the
practice. In the ceremonies of welcome, of war and peace, of trade,
and of all the endless social gatherings of these exceedingly sociable.
people, singing was the invariable accompaniment. Dixon (1787) says:

When the trafic of the day is pretty well over, they begin to sing and never leave
off till the approach of night; thus beginning and ending the day in the same man-
ner. ~*~ * ™* It must be allowed that their songs are performed with regularity and
in good time, but they are entirely destitute of that pleasing modulation and har-
mony of cadence which we had usually been accustomed to hear in the songs at
other parts of the coast.*

Marchand (1791) says that amongst the Haida, at fixed times morn-
ing and evening, they sing in chorus, in which every one takes part.
Poole says of their singing: ‘a peculiar plaintiveness of tone and a
quaint hitch of the voice at the end of each line redeems the so-called
singing from the charge of inflicting torture on human ears.”+ He
gives in this connection a Haida carroling song, which is a repetition of
the words given below like the note B in the Key of E. The notes to
the two upper lines are semi-breves, those to the under line crotchets,
thus:

Equal—ah, ah, ah, ah, he, he he, andante.
Kqual—ah, ah, ah, ah, he, hé, he, crescendo. =
Equal—ah, equal—ah, he, he, he, decrescendo.

Plate LVI is a trading song, sung by the Sitka Indians in 1787, as
reproduced in Dixon’s Voyage, page 243, and described in Chapter vir
of this paper. Fig. 300 is a song of the Haida, used as an accompani-
ment to their ceremonial dances reproduced from Poole’s Queen Char-

SONG OF THE HAIDA.
(From Poole. )

The dance songs in this region of the coast are accompanied by the
beating of drums and the spasmodic shaking of rattles. Amongst
the Tlingit the women rarely dance, but sit at some distance from the
dancers, ‘and sing a not inharmonious melody, which suyplies the
place of music.” ¢

THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 331

Additional notes on the subject of singing will be given in Chapter
XIII, in the description of the various ceremonies.

Drums.—Portlock (1787) says of a Tlingit chief whom he traded with:

He was not for transacting his business in a hurry; and perhaps he thought that
on his last visit we were not impressed with a sufficient idea of his importance; for
now he came along-side, with his party, in great pomp and solemnity, all of them
singing; and in addition to the vocal concert, they entertained us with instrumental
music, which consisted of a large old chest, beaten with the hands, by way of a drum,
and two raitles. The rattles were 2 feet long, and about 2 inches round, made of
hollow pieces of wood neatly joined together, and a number of small stones being
put in, they were closed at bothends. The chief held one of these rattles in his hand,
which he frequently shook with an air of meaning intelligence, and the rest of his
tribe seemed to follow his directions in singing in the most exact manner.

* The usual type of drum, however, is that shown in Fig. 302, Plate
LVI, which consists of a piece of deer-hide or sheep-skin stretched
across a circular hoop. ™

Rattles.—These are usually made of cedar wood, generally in sections
neatly joined together, and elaborately carved and painted in totemic
designs. There are two kinds, snappers and rattles proper. Snappers
are usually made in two pieces hinged together in such a way that by
pulling a string or jerking it bodily, the two parts come together with
a snapping noise. Often these are carved in the form of the head of
some animal with enormous teeth and jaws, controlled by a string, being
very effective in amusing the multitude when carried in the native
dances. The most primitive rattle, mentioned by the early voyagers, is
that shown in Fig. 73, Plate xvi11, composed of two hoops joined by a
wooden cross-piece, the circumference being closely strung with the
beaks of the puffin. The usual form of rattle is a hollow wooden
chamber with about a dozen small pebbles in it. The forms, variety
of carving, and general shapes are so great that only a few typical ones
are illustrated in the accompanying plates (LVIII, LIX, and Lx). They
are carried in the hand on ceremonial occasions, and serve by their
noise to accentuate the measured time of the music in the dance.
Those shown in the plates are described in detail in the legend accom-
panying each.

Whistles.—These are shown in great variety in Figs. 298, 299, and
301, and in Plates Lxt and Lx. While they are not, in one sense, mu-
sical instruments, not being capable of giving forth more than two or
three distinct notes, yet they serve the purpose of the Indians, although
they do not speak very highly for their advancement in a musical way.
Some of their devices of this kind are essentially for the purpose of
making a hideous noise, such, for instance, as that in Fig. 298, consist-
ing of a wooden whistle and a bladder like a toy balloon, or, Fig. 329,
consisting of a whistle backed by a pair of bellows to furnish the wind.
Such instruments are essentially for “ cultus” dances, or those intended
to amuse the populace. Others are highly ceremonial in their nature.

* Portlock, Voyage, p. 282.
332 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The most elaborate one of this kind is shown in Figs. 301, Plate Lvmmt,
and 319, Plate Lx1, both being views of the same instrument, the latter
in detail and the former put together for use. It consists of six pieces
of wood, forming a kind of trumpet, with five openings. Through these
is stretched a continuous narrow band of silk. When blown through it
gives forth a noise like a deer call, each section being pitched slightly
different, although not in any musical scale. Fig. 299, of which Fig.
326, Plate LXI, is another view, is a whistle pure and simple, being
blown by applying the lips as in a fife. The other instruments shown
are blown like a flageolet, some of them having several finger-holes to
change the note. Fig. 324 has a reed or vibrating piece within, as shown
in one section of corresponding type in Fig. 327. Dawson states that
among the Haida “ certain secrets are reputed to appertain to the office
of chief, among which is the possession of various articles of property
which are supposed to be mysterious and unknown to the rest of the In-
dians, or common people. * * * * When my informant was about
to engage in the dance, the chief took him aside, showing him various
articles of the mysterious chief’s properties, among others a peculiar
whistle, or cell with vibrating reed tongues, which, concealed in the
mouth, enables the operator to produce strange and startling noises,
that may be supposed by those not in the secret to indicate a species
of possession in the excited dancer. These things are explained by
the chief to his probable successor, and are also known to some of the
more important Indians, but not to all. They are, no doubt, among
the devices for obtaining and holding authority over the credulous
vulgar.” *

SUMMARY.

It can not be said that in a musical way, according to our standard,
these Indians have made much progress, but the music, such as it is,
has the nature of an accompaniment to their dancing, or is at least
subordinate to other forms of entertainment. Instrumental music
pure and simple, as an enjoyment in itself, is practically unknown, but
the passion of these Indians for vocal music has been commented upon
by nearly every visitor to the coast who has published the account of
his experiences. In the art of painting, drawing, carving, and sculpt-
ure they stand at the head of the savage tribes of the world. In the
wealth of their traditions, in the abundance of their industrial products,
in the range of their capabilities as a people, there is so much that is
worthy of illustration and description that what has been said here
seems as but the bare outline of a subject worthy of the special study
of all ethnologists.

PRODUCTIONS, LOCOMOTION, WEALTH, AND TRADE.

PRODUCTIONS : REARING AND CULTIVATION.

Rearing.—The only domestic animal is the Indian dog. It resembles
the wolf, having a sharp nose, a. long bushy tail, and being in fact a
-eross-breed from the wolf.* The Indians are remarkably fond of them,
and, in every canoe, three or four may be seen sticking their sharp muz-
zles over the gunwale. The poorer the Indian the greater the number
of dogs he owns. Practically they are not of very great use to their
masters; they occasionally run down deer in the winter and are used
to hunt bear, but are very badly trained, as they are allowed to bark
furiously on scenting a trail and are very cowardly. They are, how-
ever, of little care to their owner, as they pick up their own food from
around the refuse of the tide, camp, and village. The pure strain has
been crossed with the cur dogs of the whites and the present result is
a degenerate variety. Bancroft is authority for the statement that
‘Dogs of a peculiar breed, now nearly extinct, were shorn each year,
furnishing a long white hair, which, mixed with fine hemp and cedar,
made the best cloth.” +

Cultivation.—The only thing cultivated amongst the Tlingit, Haida,
and Tsimshian, before the advent of the whites, was a species of nar-
cotic plant similar to tobacco, but about which it is difficult to obtain
definite information. Vancouver (1793) first saw it at Kootznahoo or
Admiralty Island, and of it he says:

On each side of the entrance some new habitations were constructing, and, for the
first time during our intercourse with the Northwest American Indians, in the
vicinity of these habitations were found some square patches of ground in a state of
cultivation, producing a plant that appeared to be a species of tobacco, and which
we understood is by no means uncommon amongst the inhabitants of Queen Char-
lotte’s Islands, who cultivate much of this plant. t

All the evidence points to the Haida as being the chief cultivators of
this species of tobacco plant. To-day one finds stored away in the
out-of-the-way nooks in the older houses huge stone mortars, in which
this weed was pounded up for use. (Plate Lx11, Fig. 339). It was not
smoked, as may be supposed,.but chewed or held in the cheek. Its
preparation consisted in drying it, pounding it in a mortar, and press-

ing it into plugs or cakes. Lime, made from burnt clam-shells, was
mixed with it to give a good “bite.” The practice of smoking came in
with the whites, and our tobacco has completely replaced the native ©
article, which is now only cultivated, if at all, in the most remote regions,
and the writer was unable to obtain any specimens of it.

Gardens.—Around all the villages garden patches may now be seen.
The principal vegetable cultivated is the potato, although turnips and
a few others are found occasionally. The Haida in particular cultivate
potatoes in large quantities to trade on the mainland.

LOCOMOTION: CANOE TRAVEL.

From the diversified nature of the country and the numerous inland
water-ways, travel is of necessity by canoe. It is unnecessary to treat
of the subject here after what has been said under the titles of tents,
tents, p. 304, and canoes, p. 294.

WEALTH: CURRENCY, PROPERTY, SLAVES, LAND.

Primitive wealth—Before the advent of the whites, wealth consisted
in the possession of sea-otter skins, hunting and fishing grounds, slaves,
and household and personal property, such as dance paraphernalia,
household furniture, hunting and fishing implements, canoes, houses,
and articles of trade. Practically, however, the unit of value was the
sea-otter skin, as if was also the basis of wealth. As the Haida were
the most expert hunters of this animal in this region, they became in
time the most wealthy and influential people on the coast. The prin-
cipal changes in the forms of wealth have been in the substitution of
blankets for skins and furs and the abolition of slavery. Otherwise
the enumeration of articles of wealth is as given above.

Currency—Amongst the interior Indians of North America the
beaver skin was the medium of exchange. In the trade between the
coast Indians and those of the interior, the dentalium shell was valued
_ by the latter, who gave in exchange the abalone shell so highly prized
by the former. Amongst the coast Indians themselves, as stated, the
sea-otter skin was the basis of exchange, although the shell currency
seems to have had a relative value. This latter lost its function when
the whites began to import such quantities of shell later on. These
have, however, remained as a favorite ornament, occupying somewhat
the place of jewels amongst civilized people. With the almost total dis-
appearance of the sea-otter through the greed of Indian and white man
alike, a new currency sprang up. It happened that, through the com- .
petition in trade between the French, English, Americans, and Rus-
sians, success crowned the English through the superiority of the
material which they offered in trade, and with the establishment of the
Hudson Bay Company their blankets, through uniformity and excel-
lence in grading, became the recognized currency. These vary from
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 335

“one point,” the poorest, to ‘‘ four points,” the best. These “ points ”
are woven into the texture on the edge, and it has happened that the
“two-and-a-half point” has come to be the unit, valued now at about
$1.50. Just as in former times, as the sea-otter skins were stored away
representing so much wealth, so to-day the blankets are folded and
packed away in their boxes. They are generally received at face value
by all traders when unused and in good condition. The value of every-
thing is referred to the unit blanket. A four point blanket is worth so
many blankets (two-and-one-half point), aud the cost of everything is
reckoned in the same way.

Property in land.—Throughout this region the coast line, streams,
estuaries, and adjacent lakes are divided amongst the different families,
the right of possession descending from one generation to another as
personal property. The larger salmon streams are sometimes jointly
owned by several families, or owned by one family and leased for a
consideration to one or several others. Stranded marine animals, or
other débris washed by the tide, belong to the family owning that por-
tion of the shore line, the boundaries of possessions being definitely
marked and respected accordingly. Nor is this boundary confined to
the strip of coast, but extends well out to sea, carrying with it the
right to shoot seals and gather birds’ eggs on outlying rocks, hunt sea-
otter, and to fish on well-known halibut or cod banks.

Major Powell says: ‘‘ Land tenure does not begin in grants from the
monarch or the feudal lord, but a system of tenure in common by
gentes or tribes is developed into a system of tenure in severalty.” *
This is admirably illustrated in this region, for the ownership of a tract
of land by a family has come, through being vested in an individual or
the head of that family, to mean practically individual ownership.
Dawson gives an instance on Queen Charlotte Islands where a rich
tract of country called Tl-ell, which had come into the possession of a
former Chief of Skidegate as the property of his wife, ‘‘ was afterwards
given by him to the Skedans of that day as a peace-offering for the
wounding or killing of one of his (Skedans) women. The tract thus
now belongs to Skedans, and is valued as a berry ground.” t¢

Disputes over ownership of land, boundaries, ete., have been the
cause of many feuds. At Thom Bay, adjoining Tolstoi Bay, Prince of
Wales Island, Alaska, a valuable tract of hunting and fishing ground
is in dispute between the Stikines and Kaigani, both tribes in true
American style having up “ No trespassing” signs on the trees.

Coppers.—Throughout the Northwest coast copper plates or ‘ cop-
pers” of a conventional pattern are valued as emblems or tokens of
wealth, and have been handed down for generations. They originally:
came from the Chilkat country, where virgin copper is found in consid-
erable quantities, and are made in the form of a shield from 24 to 34

feet in length, 12 to 25 inches in width, and one-sixteenth to one-eighth
of an inch in thickness. They have a groove running vertically in the
lower half and transversely across the middle at the narrow part, form-
ing a figure like the letter T. They are sometimes painted, but more
commonly etched on the outer surface with the design of the crest or
totem of the owner. If they ever served as shields in battle such use
lhas long since disappeared, and now they have only a ceremonial or
emblematic significance. To be of great value these plates must be
large, of virgin copper, worked by hand, of native manufacture, of
uniform thickness, except at the edges, where they should be thicker
than elsewhere; and, finally, when struck should give forth a dull
sound and not ring. Totemic etching on the outer surface also adds
value to them. Modern “coppers” of European manufacture are not
very highly prized, as compared with the ancient ones. Lisiansky
(1804) says that amongst the Tlingit they were ‘only possessed by the
rich, who give for one of them from twenty to thirty sea-otter skins.
They are carried by their servants before their masters on different oc-
casions of ceremony, and are beaten upon so as to serve as a musical in-
strument. The value of the plate depends, it seems, on its being ne
of virgin copper, for the common ones do not bear a higher price th?

a single skin.”* The best, according to Dunn (1834), were we
around Dixon Entrance nine slaves, and were transmitted as a precic
heir-loom.t Now they are valued at from forty to eighty blanket¥.
They are called by the Kaigani Dow, and are shown in Plate LXVII.
Dr. Boas says of them:

“They are given as presents by one tribe to another. The Indians value a copper-
plate the more the more frequently it has been given as a present. Every single
plate has its name and its own house, and is fed regularly. No woman is allowed to
enter its house. Almost every tribe has a tradition referring to their origin. Some
say that a man who visited the moon received it from the man in the moon. Others
say a chief living far into the ocean gave it to aman who came to visit him, ete.
Similar legends refer to the haliotis shells which are used for ear and nose ornaments
and bracelets.” { ee

This may be the custom with regard to copper plates amongst the
southern coast tribes, but it differs materially from that of the Tlingit,
Haida, and Tsimshian, With them they are simply tokens of wealth.
These are shown in Plate LXviI as forming no inconsiderable portion
of the wealth of Chief Skowl, amounting to hundreds of blankets.
Dawson says that amongst the Tsimshian these coppers are exhibited
in a circle in upright position at the ceremony of “bringing out” a
young girl, who sits within the circle and sings.§

Amongst the Kaigani these ow are often displayed over the grave
of a deceased person of wealth. One is shown in Plate 11, left of ©
upper view. Some miles below the village of Kasa-an, on Prinee of

Wales Island, one is nailed to a tree on a point of land to mark the lo-
cality where a canoe was upset and the occupants drowned. Lisian-
sky, as quoted, shows that they were occasionally used by the Tlingit
as a sort of gong or musical instrument, being carried before the chiefs
by the slaves and beaten upon.

The change in the articles of value accumulated and stowed away as
wealth is illustrated by an incident in the summer of 1886, where some
white men robbed a cache of the Klawak chief Tin-ga-ate of all its con-
tents to the value of over $2,000. The booty included five hundred
blankets, fifty wash-bowls, thirty-six mirrors, six valuable dancing
robes, and many other articles. It may be mentioned in this connec-
tion that the wash-bowls are used as receptacles for food, and are
taking the place of the native wooden bowls.

TRADE: EXCHANGE OF COMMODITIES.

Port Simpson, from its central location.at the head of Dixon En-
trance, has come to be the great emporium { trade for the surrounding
region. Dunn says that, in 1834, the Haida, Nass, Kaigani, Tongass,
Port Stewart and Stikines generally rendezvoused there in the month

f September to trade.* Simpson estimates that, in 1841, about four-

-n thousand from the various tribes of Stikines on the north to the

yassa on the south, resorted there, although many of them merely
,aid passing visits en route to the Nass River to fish for eulachon.+

In earlier days, previous to the advent of the whites, the trading
was carried on less systematically and with more formality on account
of the feuds between the different tribes. The Indians of this whole
region are expert traders. Every article purchased undergoes the
closest scrutiny. Every defect is discovered and the value scaled
down accordingly. If once a certain price is obtained for a commodity
of theirs it is adhered to thereafter as the set price, and the knowledge
of such value travels fast. Time and distance are unimportant factors
in a bargain. If 200 miles farther on the price paid for a commodity
is considerably greater, the distance is reckoned as nothing in going
there to get the difference. On the other hand, in purchasing goods
from the traders, they show rare good sense in their selection of the
better qualities, mere cheapness being in itself no recommendation.
From the earliest times they have preferred articles of use to trinkets.
Dixon (1787) says that they refused beads with contempt. What Van-
couver said of the Tlingit or the Kaigani of Prince of Wales Island, in
1794, applies with equal force to-day :

In all the commercial transactions the women took a very principal part, and
proved themselves by no means unequal to the task. Nor did it appear that either
in these or in any other respect they were inferior to the men; on the contrary, it

should rather seem that they are looked up to as the superior sex, for they appeared
in general to keep the men in awe and under subjection.

338 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Dixon (1787) says of the Sitka Indians:

The chief of the tribe has always the entire management of all the trade belonging ~
to his people, and takes infinite pains to dispose of their furs advantageously. * * *
The moment a chief has concluded a bargain he repeats the word Coo coo twice, with
quickness, and is immediately answered by all the people in his canoe with the word
Whoah, pronounced in a tone of exclamation, but with greater or less energy, in pro-
portion as the bargain he had made is approved. *

In general notes on the northwest coast the same author says:

Whenever any large party came to trade these treasurers [dance paraphernalia]
were first produced, and the principal persons dressed out in all their finery before
the singing commenced. In addition to this, the chief (who always conducts the vo-
cal coucert) puts on a large coat, made of elk skin, tanned, round the lower part of
which is one or sometimes two rows of dried berries or the beaks of birds, which
make a rattling noise whenever he moves. In his hand he has a rattle, or more
commonly a contrivance to answer the same end, which is of a circular form, about
9 inches in diameter, and made of three small sticks bent round at different distances
from each other; great numbers of birds’ beaks and dried berries are tied to this
curious instrument, whicb is shaken by the chief with great glee, and in his opinion
makes no small addition to the concert. Their songs generally consist of several
stanzas, to each of which is added a chorus. The beginning of each stanza is given
out by the chief alone, after which both meu and women join and sing in octaves,
beating time regularly with their hands or paddles; meanwhile the chief shakes his
rattle and makes a thousand ridiculous gesticulations, singing at intervals in differ-
ent notes from the rest; and this mirth generally continues near half an hour with-
out intermissiou.t

The song which was usually sung on such occasions is reproduced
from the same volume (p. 243), in Plate LVI.

As mentioned, the course of the slave trade was from the south to
the north and from the coast inland. The Tsimshian were the middle
men, and were, and are still, the great traders in oil and grease, of
which they prepare large quantities from the eulachon, seal blubber, deer
and goat flesh. Computed in blankets, the euiachon grease or oil now
brings one blanket for from 10 to 15 pounds. With the disappearance
of the sea-otter, the Haida, with great foresight and judgment, began
the cultivation of the potato, which was first introduced amongst them
by an American ship-captain. Dunn (1834) says: “Ihave known from
500 to 800 bushels being traded in one season from these Indians
(Haida) at Fort Simpson.”+ It is not unusual now to see fleets of
canoes coming in from the Queen Charlotte Islands bringing pota-
toes, etc., and towing new canoes to trade or sell. The Hudson Bay
Company now has a * guest house” near its post, to accommodate the
visiting Indians who come to trade with them. Ordinarily, however, the
visiting Indians are the guests of their own gens at the Tsimshian vil-
lage near by. Large fleets now also visit Victoria each spring and fall
from the north, not only to trade, but too often, unfortunately, for im-
moral purposes.

SUMMARY.

Rank and social standing amongst these Indians being based largely
upon the possession and distribution of wealth, it is not surprising to
find a uniform currency amongst the different tribes, and a regular
system of exchange or trade based on considerations both of supply
and demand, and of the adaptability of certain tribes or regions to the
production of certain’ things needed in other parts of the coast. The
advent of the whites and the abolition of slavery have destroyed in a
measure the tendency towards feudalism in the village communities,
due to the possession of property and lands by a few families, and
practically changed the development of their tribal organization into a
tendency towards industrialism or division into trades crafts. This
tendency is seen to-day in the adoption of certain trades by the Indians
and the gradual breaking up of the old system of household organiza-
tion for industrial purposes. The writer once asked an Indian who was
loafing around Fort Wrangell in the summer doing nothing, while most
of the other Indians were off in summer camp or working in the can-
neries, how business was, and he answered “very dull.” When asked
what his business was, he replied “ Oh, eberyting.” Asa matter of fact
he was a canoe-man, carrying freight up the Stikine River, and at odd
times chopped wood for a living. The capabilities of these Indians in
a business way is well illustrated by an incident which the writer wit-
nessed at Port Townsend, Washington Territory, early in October of
1886. It was just at the end of the hop-picking season around Puget
Sound, and hundreds of Indians were coming in to Port Townsend en
route to their villages to the north. <A party of young Haida stopped,
and one of their number telegraphed over to Whidby Island to offer the
services of the party to a farmer to dig potatoes for him. In view of
the glut in the labor market, due to the presence of so many idle In-
dians just then, this clever bit of enterprise showed an appreciation of
the telegraph in a way that needs no further comment other than that
they secured the job ahead of all rivals.

WARK AND PEACE.

As arule, the feuds between gentes, phratries, and tribes in this re-
gion have originated from such causes as gambling quarrels, failure to
pay indemnity for wrongs done, or breaches of custom or etiquette, for
the observance of which all are great sticklers. Their wars have been
characterized by treachery, surprise, ambush, night attack, superior
numbers on the aggressive side, massacre of women and children, im-
pressment into slavery of the prisoners of war, and scalping of the
slain enemies. Fair fight, excepting in duels, seems to have been un-
known or unrecognized. The ceremonies attending both warlike and
peaceful demonstrations have always been of an elaborate character,
and, as has been pointed out, many of the existing elaborate ceremo-
nials, with the accompanying paraphernalia, are survivals of practices
originating in war. Since the military occupation of Alaska by our
Government, and the suppression of slavery throughout the north-
‘west coast, Indian wars have practically ceased; and, in describing the
practices of war, it becomes necessary to speak in the past tense.

WAR CUSTOMS.

In preparation for war the men painted the body, powdered the hair
with eagle’s down, and got themselves up in the most hideous attire.
The wooden masks, helmets, and armor were carried in the war
canoes, ready to be put on for an encounter; and the war parties con-
sisted usually of both freemen and slaves. The war canoes were gen-
erally steered by some old crone whose courage and influence had been
found oftentimes to be of the greatest incitement to the warriors.
From various accounts, it would appear that, in early times, when two
hostile canoe parties met accidentally, preparations for the encounter
consisted in putting on the masks and war garments, throwing over-
board the dogs, and cautious advance, accompanied by songs, men-
acing speeches, and gestures. Arrows, missiles, and even bullets
(after the introduction of fire-arms) were avoided by gently heeling the
canoe and interposing its gunwale as a protection. In an encounter,
the victorious usually slaughtered their opponents, scalped them, and
cut off their heads, either sticking up the latter on poles to grace their
triumph or carrying them off to prevent the friends of the deceased
from recovering them. In the first encounter of the Russian com-
manders Lisiansky and Baranoff with the Sitka Indians, in 1804, the
latter remained in possession of the battle-field, and the bodies of the

340 :
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 341

slain Russians and Aleuts were displayed by the Indians, borne aloft
on spears. Subsequently they were compelled by the Russians to
abandon their fort, which they did secretly at night, first killing their
- dogs and young children to prevent their noise giving notice of their
flight.*

Vancouver (1794) mentions an encounter between some Kaigani In-
dians, who were on board ship trading with him, and some Stikine
who suddenly appeared, coming around a point of land. The former
rushed into their canoes, which were alongside, put on their war gar-
ments, and. rested their spears on the gunwale. Thus prepared, they
advanced slowly to meet the new-comers, meanwhile making the most
violent and passionate speeches, which were answered in a similar tone
by some persons who stood up in the Stikine canoe. After a parley,
lasting some moments, an amicable understanding was reached, and
both parties returned to the ship, though on their guard towards each
other. At the head of the Stikines was the great chief O-non nis toy,
who, with all his party, for safety, slept on board the Discovery, while
the Kaigani went to their camp on shore. In the morning the Stikine
went on shore with great ceremony and arranged with the Kaigania
combined entertainment for the benefit of Vancouver, which they gave
alongside in their canoes. ‘It consisted in singing and a display of
the most rude and extravagant gestures that can be imagined. The
principal parts were performed by the chiefs, each in succession becom-
ing the leader or hero of the song; at several pauses of which I | Van-
couver| was presented by the exhibiting chief with a sea-otter skin.” t+

SCALPING AND OTHER WAR CUSTOMS.

The scalps of the slain were usually removed by the medicine men,
or Shamans, who accompanied the war party. Poole (1864) says that he
saw ‘at least a hundred scalps in Chief Klue’s lodge, on a pole.”{ Dall
states that, amongst the Tlingit, the scalps were woven into a kind of
garter by the victor.§ On the death of a chief of great prowess, the
scalps which he had taken were sometimes used to decorate his tomb. ||

‘Once I saw a party of Kaiganys of about two hundred men returning from war.
The paddles of the warriors killed in the fight were lashed upright in their various
seats, so that from a long distance the number of the fallen could be ascertained ;
and on each mast of the canoes—and some had three—was stuck the head of a slain
foe.” 7

Simpson thus describes a feud at Sitka (1841), growing out of a
drunken quarrel between a chief and a man of rank, in which the
former stabbed the latter to death:

The party of the deceased, to the number of about a thousand men, immediately
turned out, with horrible yells, to revenge his death, painted in the most hideous

manner and armed with all sorts of weapons, such as spears, bludgeons, dirks, and
fire-arms; while the women, more ferocious, if possible, than the warriors themselves,
were exciting the tumultuary band to actual violence by the most fiendish screams
and gestures * * * The chief’s life was demanded in atonement, but refused by
his party as being of more value than that of the person slain. * * * The parties
met with a loud war-whoop ; for a minute or two a clashing of arms was heard ; and
when both sides simultaneously receded from the spot, we beheld the bodies of two
slaves that had been sacrificed in lieu of the chief. *

This atoned for the outrage and satisfied the requirements of blood
revenge.

Dunn (1835) mentions a feud between the Port Stewart and Tongass
Indians, in the course of which the latter cut off a war party of thirty
of the former and massacred them.t In the Port Stewart region,
Vancouver (1793) has left a record for all time of the character of this
tribe in the names given to Traitor’s Cove and Escape Point, commem-
orative of his hostile encounter with them, and his narrative makes
them out to have been the most villainous Indians on the coast.t
Simpson (1841) says that between the Haida of Queen Charlotte Is]-
ands, and the Bella Bella, a deadly feud had long subsisted :

About six weeks before our arrival, the latter, to the number of three hundred,
had attacked a village of the former, butchering all the inhabitants but one man
and one woman. These two the victorious chief was carrying away as living tro-
phies of his triumph; * * * while standing in a boastful manner on the gurwale
of his canoe, and vowing all sorts of vengeance against his victims, he was shot
down by a desperate effort of his male prisoner. The Bella Bellas, their joy being
now turned into grief, cut the throats of the prisoners, threw their spoils overboard,
and returned home rather as fugitives than as conquerors. §$

Poole (1863 ), speaking of the ravages of Small-pox on the coast, says:

The Bella-Bella tribe, though not to be despised, were formerly by no means a
match for their born foes the Bella Coolas, who used always to cut off a great num-
ber of the Bella-Bella whenever these ventured from their own territory. But now
the Bella-Bella, though deplorably reduced in their own tribe, found themselves in
numbers and force far ahead of the Bella Coolas, and were accordingly preparing,
might and main, to administer condign punishment to their ancient enemies. ||

DUELS.

Duels or trials by combat were sometimes resorted to not only in case
of dispute between indivduals, but to settle feuds between families or
gentes. The combatants protected their bodies with thick leather
shirts and wooden armor outside; wore masks and helmets of wood;
and, armed with daggers, stepped forth to the encounter, encouraged
by the songs and cries of their friends.

PEACE CUSTOMS.

On the approach of a canoe or party the intention of which is at first
doubtful, the token of peace was the blowing in the air of white feath-

ers plucked from an eagle’s skin, or by the display of a tuft of white
feathers on the end of a pole or at the mast head of the canoe.* In the
friendly dances and ceremonies of welcome a fan or tuft of white
eagle feathers was carried in token of friendship and peace.

TREATIES OF PEACE.

At a conclusion of peace it was the custom to exchange hostages in
token of good faith. Dall says of them:

These are obliged to eat with their left hands for a certain period, as they carried
weapons in the right hand during combat. Each hostage has two companions of
equal rank assigned to him by the tribe which holds him.t

Lisiansky (1804) says of the hostages sent by the Sitka to the Russian
forces :

They were in one canoe, and suug as they approached a sort of song of a melan-
choly strain. On landing, the hostage threw himself flat on his back in the shallow
water, according to the custom of the country, and continued in this posture till
some of our people arrived who were sent to lift him up and conduct him. ¢

In general the treaties of peace were ratified by feasts and elaborate
ceremonies often lasting many days.

VICES AND DEMORALIZATION OF THE INDIANS — GAMBLING — RUM —
TOBACCO—IMMORALITY.

Before the advent of the whites gambling, immorality, and the use of
tobacco, although not unknown, were at least not such pronounced
vices as they have come to be under the stimulus of contact with ecivil-
ization. The use of liquor was, however, quite unknown. Langsdorff,
who was at Sitka in 1805, says of the Tlingit: ‘‘ Brandy, which is some-
times offered them by the Russians, they reject as a scandalous liquor,
depriving them of their senses.”* It would have been of great advan-
tage to them if they had continued to so regard it. Unfortunately the
example of the whites and the deliberate corruption of the Indians by
unscrupulous traders have made them in recent years only too well
acquainted with the evils of rum drinking. Just now they are begin-
ning to rally from the demoralization due to contact with the whites
and to adjust themselves philosophically to their changed environ-
ment. The former custom of chewing tobacco, in vogue from the earliest
times, has now given way almost entirely to that of smoking the weed
which they buy from the traders. In Chapter VIII, ‘‘ Rearing and Cul-
tivation.” the production and preparation of the native tobacco has
been fully described. Although in one sense a vice, the use of tobacco
can hardly be said to have contributed much to the real demoralization
of the Indians.

GAMBLING.

The Haida, Tsimshian, and Tlingit are inveterate gamblers. Dur-
ing the winter leisure or whenever, for any reason, they are gathered
together in considerable numbers, gambling is the invariable and con-
stant amusement, often continuing for several days on a stretch with-
out rest or intermission. These bouts are usually conducted on the
platform in front of the houses in good weather, but indoors in bad. |
The gamblers sit on the ground or squat about the platform in a circle,
in the centre of which a clean mat of the inner bark of the cedar is
spread. Each man produces a bag containing from thirty to fifty round
sticks or pins about 5 inches long by three-eighths or one-half of an
inch in diameter, and beautifully polished and carved in totemic design
or painted in black, blue, and red rings. One of the players, selecting
a number of these pins from his bag, covers them up in a heap of finely

GAMBLING STICKS; MORTARS AND CARVED PESTLE FOR PREPARING NATIVE TOBACCO.

cut bark tow. The workings and significances of these sticks is per-
fectly understood, and the game is either odd or even, or to guess in
which of two piles a certain stick is hidden. Poole thus describes the
game among the Haida:

One of the players, selecting a number of these pins, covers them up in a heap of
bark cut into fibre-like tow. Under cover of the bark he then divides the pins into
two parcels and having taken them out passes them several times from his right
hand to his left, or the contrary. While the player shuffles he repeats the word
I-E-Ly-Yah to alow monotonous chant or moan. The moment he finishes the in-
cantation, his opponent, who has been silently watching him, chooses the parcel
where he thinks the luck lies for odd or even. After which the second player takes
his innings, with his own pins and the same ceremonies. This goes on till one or the
other loses all his pins. That decides the game. *

Another form of this is for the player to shuffle together all the pins
and count out seven. The game is to guess in which pile a certain pin
is, say the one carved like a beaver, or whale, or eagle. The fortunate
guesser gets one or more pins according to rule, or, if he fails, pays a
forfeit of so many pins. The Indians stoically sit for hours conning over
the melancholy chant, apparently indifferent to loss, gain, time, or hun-
ger, often losing everything he owns in the world without the slightest
expression of emotion. Poole mentions the case of a Haida chief who
continued playing for three days without eating a mouthful of food, but
perpetually losing. By the fourth day he had even parted with the
blanket on his back, when a woman of his tribe, taking pity on him,
loaned him her only blanket, and he renewed the contest, this time suc-
cessfully, not only winning back what he had lost, but finally getting
all his opponent’s property, consisting of powder and shot, muskets,
revolvers, blankets, skins, paints, tobacco, fish, etc. *

Two sets of gambling sticks are shown in Plate Lx1t, Figs. 335 and
336. For convenience of illustration they are laid out on the wrapper
of the wallet in which they are usually kept. The carving on some of
the more expensive sets is of the very highest order.

Rum.—Impure, monstrously vile liquor has been the greatest curse
to the Indians of this region. Having furs and other valuable products
sought by the traders, the latter have been only too ready to debauch
and despoil them. In all the criminal record of shameless commercial
conquest of a rich and prosperous territory, no region has suffered more
unless it be the Aleutian Islands in earlier days. This can not be laid
at the door of any of the large commercial companies, for in the main
such a policy is suicidal to their own interests. With the small dealers,
the owners of small trading craft, those whose only thought and inter-
est has been the business in hand, the policy has been one of unscru-
pulous rum selling. Poole (1863) says:

The so-called whiskey which is shamelessly sold to the Indians by traders along

the coast or even by certain unprincipled merchants of Victoria, contains very little
of what is wholesome or genuine liquor. What it really does contain is not generally

* Poole, Queen Charlotte Islands, p. 319,
346 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

known, but I hear on good authority that the bulk consists of water flavored and
colored with grain whiskey in the smallest possible quantities. Itsstrength proceeds
wholly from the blue-stone, vitriol, and nitric acid which the manufacturers largely
infuse into it. The conseqnence is that when the Indians imbibe this drink freely—
and they always do so whenever they can get it—their naturally fiery temperaments
are wrought up into a state of savagery so intense as to leave no white man’s life safe
in their presence while they remain under its influence. *

The orgies and debauchery of the Indians up to recent years have
been something to shock even the most hardened trader. Liquor being
obtained in quantities, either by the distillation of sugar or molasses or
purchased from the traders, a systematic plan of getting drunk in de-
tachments was practised and is to-day in certain regions when they can
get the liquor. It is the duty of those sober about the village to look
out for the drunk and tend to the various household duties, look after
the canoes, children, ete. When the first detachment has sobered up
the others sometimes take their turn. Pandemonium reigns, and it often
takes the intervention of the whites to get things going smoothly again.
Unfortunately the women are worse drunkards than the men, and it
is in their demoralization that the Indians have suffered most. The
hoochinoo, which they make themselves, is not a native invention, as the
process has been picked up from the whites. It has flourished amongst
the Tlingit since our acquisition of Alaska in 1867, and common report
credits its introduction to American officials. Hoochinoo is simply a
distillation from potatoes. The still generally consists of a square tin
kerosene can, with a worm, made either of tin pipe or the stems of the.
giant kelp. The worm is either packed with snow or placed in a stream
of fresh water. The mash is made from potatoes, which are cooked,
dumped into a tub, and allowed to ferment, a little sugar or very cheap
molasses being added to produce the alcohol. It suffers only one dis-
tillation, and the horrible product is taken in its raw state, the effect
being to almost instantly rob an Indian of his senses. Largely through
the influence and authority exerted by the commanding officers of our
men-of-war before the establishment of the civil government in Alaska
the practice of distilling hoochinoo has been greatly broken up and de-
cidedly discouraged. t

Immorality.—The chief demoralization in this region has been amongst
the women, brought about by the independent position they occupy in
the social organization of the tribe, by the peculiar laws or customs re-
lating to marriage by purchase, and by the right to return a female to
her people in case she proves unsatisfactory or undesirable. Through
the influx of whites, due to the establishment of industries, the pros-
ecution of trade, and the development of mineral resources, the Indians
have been brought in close contact with most unrefined elements of our
civilization. Money earned in the summer months by these adventurous

spirits is squandered in the most reckless dissipation about the various
settlements in the winter months. Jealousy being unknown amongst
the Indians, and sanctioned prostitution a common evil, the woman who
can earn the greatest number of blankets or the largest sums of money
wins the admiration of others for herself, and a high position for her
husband by reason of her wealth. It is not an uncommon thing for
whole families to resort to the settlements for the winter, and return to
their villages in the spring to give grand potlatches with their ill-gotten
gains. The influence of the missionaries and of the respectable element
in the settlements has, from the first, been used against the extension
and growth of this evil, but it can not be said that, until in the last few
years, much progress has been made in stemming this tide of reckless
physical and moral debasement. Its effects are seen in the alarming
number of deaths due to dissipation, and the great decrease in the ratio
of births to deaths throughout this whole northern region. The part
which rum has played in causing this havoc is not to be underestimated,
and it is fortunate that a steadily growing sentiment is making itself
felt towards the suppression of these two alarming evils.

SUMMARY.

The native vices of these Indians are simply those due to savagism.
Contact with the whites has, through the greed for wealth operating on
both sides, produced an abnormal departure from primitive ways.
Gambliig is found almost universally amongst savage tribes, and with
progress in civilization, the first steps are always in the direction of the
aggravation of primitive and the adopticn of foreign vices. Rum drink-
ing has been nowhere so disastrous as in this region. With the smok-
ing of tobacco by the Indians of the Atlantic coast region, and the
chewing of it by those on the northwest coast, it has remained for our
civilization only to invent the snuffing of it. Peculiar marriage cus-
toms and the greed of wealth have here contributed more to the alarm-
ing increase of immorality than any inherent love of vice on the part of
the Indians.

WITCHCRAFT—SUPERSTITION—SICKNESS AND DEATH—MEDICINES—
TREATMENT OF THE SICK.

WITCHCRAFT.

All severe diseases or illnesses are ascribed to the evil influence of
enemies, and, in case of the death of an important personage, a victim
is usually found who has presumably charmed away the life of the de-
ceased. The Indians are intensely superstitious and have naturally
been encouraged in ideas of this kind by both the chiefs and the
shamans, whose sway over the tribe depends largely upon the fear and
respect excited by belief in their influence and power over good and
evil spirits. Largely through the action of the commanding officers
of our men-of-war stationed in Alaska, this hold of the chiefs and
shamans on the people has been broken. By the bombardment and de-
struction of several villages the Indians have been compelled to
abandon the punishment of victims accused of witchcraft, but the chief
stumbling block has been the surprising admission of guilt which nearly
all of the accused Indians make when charged with charming away
life, and this, too, in the face of the death penalty. Such is their credu-
lity that when accused they believe they must be guilty. Amongst the
Haida the guilty Indian, according to Judge Swan, is discovered as
follows:

The mouse is the judge by which the Haida detect the persons who work bad
magic and cause sickness and death. When a person is taken sick or dies, three men
are selected who prepare themselves by pulverizing a dried frog, mixing it with salt
water and drinking it. This decoction produces vomiting and purging, and when
their systems are thoroughly cleansed their minds are supposed to be clear and bet-
ter able to judge of the merits of the case about to be submitted to their decision.
They next catch a wood-mouse and put it ina little cage, which is set on a raised
platform in front of the judges. The little mouse, sadly frightened, retires to a cor-
ner of his cage and eyes the judges. They then commence naming over suspected
persons, and presently the little mouse nods its head. The victim has to pay money
or blankets to get*clear. * * * (West Shore, August, 1884.)

A narration of the superstitious beliefs of these Indians would in
itself exceed the limits of this paper. Charms of all kinds are worn
and the most implicit faith is placed in the significance of dreams, signs,
and omens. Certain forms are gone through with to propitiate the vari-
ous spirits and invoke their aid in all enterprises. A consideration of
this subject belongs properly to a study of the religious beliefs and
practices of these Indians, which must come later.

SICKNESS.

In cases of serious illness chief reliance was, up to recent years,
placed upon the incantations of the medicine men, who were paid liber-
ally if the patient lived, or, if he died, were compeiled to restore the
goods he had previously received on account. If any one other than
a shaman attempted to do anything to cure a sick person and the pa-
tient died, the self-constituted doctor had to pay a heavy indemnity to
the person’s relatives. In out-of-the-way villages the shamans still have
a hold on the Indians, and in case of sickness one is called in by the
head of the household. If the latter falls sick it devolves upon his
brother or nearest male relative to call in the Indian doctor. On all
such occasions friends are invited in to see the evil spirits exorcised.
While these shamans possess some knowledge of the medicinal proper-
ties of herbs and are not slow to avail themselves of them, their duty
is to drive out the evil spirit which haunts the sick man. Any virtue
that medicines may in themselves have are ascribed to the charm sup-
posed to be wrought by the doctors in their decoction or preparation.
The incantations and exorcising consist in beating drums, dancing,
making passes with subtle charms, blowing in the patient’s mouth and
nostrils, kneading and pounding his body, chanting, swinging to and
fro, frothing at the mouth, and every conceivable practice foreign to
our own ideas of the treatment of the sick. As a rule the patient that
survives the din, foul air, and excitement of such a visit must needs
have been on the high road to recovery, for the shaman usually con-
tinues this performance until the patient declares himself better or
well.

The initiation, practices, rites, exhibitions, dances, and incantations
of these medicine meu deserve separate consideration as connected in- -
timately with their religious beliefs and customs. In connection with
witcheraft, it may be said that the shamans are supposed to possess
the power of charming away life by incantations and the use of certain
charms. In such cases, where the charge can be reasonably laid at
their door, they are not beyond the reach of a kinsman’s revenge.

MEDICINES.

The internat administration of native medicines is rarely practiced.
Wounds and injuries are treated locally with several specifics known
to them, and scarification is sometimes resorted to. Hemorrhages are
stopped by the application of bird’s down to the wounded parts. The
healing qualities of pine and cedar are recognized, and pine-tree gum
is applied as a poultice to wounds by some tribes. Salt-water taken as
an emetic is a favorite remedy for those not feeling well. This is also
taken when they wish to produce quickly that profound impression on
body and mind which fasting brings about in preparation for some or-
deal or ceremony. As stated, the virtue of any medicine administered
350 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 18388.

is supposed to be due to the charm wrought in it by the shaman or
other person in its preparation or decoction. Preparations of bark are
the principal specifics, but Langsdorff (1804) says of the Tlingit, ‘the
root of a particular species of valerian is considered as the most effectual
remedy that can be administered. * * * ‘The wing bones [of the
eagle], particularly the radius and ulna, are used in illness as tubes for
sucking up fluids.”* Around Sitka, the virtues of hot sulphur baths
were recognized by the Indians long before the advent of the whites.
Near that settlement are some natural hot springs impregnated with
sulphur, salt, and magnesia. In addition to these, however, the in-
dians take steam baths by pouring water on red-hot stones in an in-
closed tent or shed. In bathing and in some attempt at personal
cleanliness, the Indians of the northern region of the northwest coast
compare favorably with any of those in the world living in the temper-
ate zone, but their ignorance of the Smaps laws of health is child-
like and lamentable.

ANCIENT SEPULTURE.

The earliest historical accounts are those of the early voyagers, and
it is from these that we must get our descriptions of primitive methods
of sepulture.

Dixon, who was amongst the Yakutat in June, 1787, says:

The manner in which they dispose of their dead is very remarkable. They sepa-
rate the head fromthe body and wrapping them in furs, the head is put into a square
box; the body in a kind of oblong chest. At each end of the chest which contains
the body a thick pole, about 10 feet long, is drove into the earth in a slanting posi-
tion, so that the upper ends meet together, and are very firmly lashed with a kind of
rope prepared for the purpose. About 2 feet from the top of this arch a small piece
of timber goes across, and is very neatly fitted to each pole; on this piece of timber
the box which contains the head is fixed, and very strongly secured with rope; the
box is frequently decorated with two or three rows of small shells, and sometimes
teeth, which are let into the wood with great neatness and ingenuity ; and, as an ad-
ditional ornament, is painted with a variety of colors, but the poles are uniformly
painted white. Sometimes these poles are fixed upright in the earth and on each
side the body, but the head is always secured in the position described.*

Dixon also describes a grave discovered by one of his officers near
Sitka: Ina cave *‘he found the object which attracted his attention
to be a square box with a human head in it,” ete., beautifully orna-
mented with small shells somewhat like those at Yahkutat.*

Portlock, who was also in this region in 1787, describes a grave just
above Sitka as follows:

‘This edifice was composed of four posts, each about 20 feet long, stuck in the
ground 6 feet distant from each other, and in a quadrangular form. About 12 or 15
feet from the ground there was a rough-boarded floor, and two of the sides were
boarded 4 feet higher up; the other sides were left open. In the middle of this floor
an Indian chest was deposited, which most likely contained the remains of some
_person of consequence; and on that side of the edifice to the westward, and which
pointed up the sound, there was painted the semblance of a human face.

It is further described as showing evidence of having been recently
repaired and the painting touched up.*

352 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Vancouver describes a Kootznahoo grave (Tlingit) which they saw
on Admiralty Island, near Point Caution, in 1794, as follows:

They rested for the night in asmall cove under a high hill, where a box was found -
about 4 feet square, placed on wooden pillars about 6 feet from the ground. This
box contained the remains of a human body very carefully wrapped up, and by its
side was erected a pole about 20 feet high, painted in horizontal streaks red and
white; the colors were fresh and lively.*

Vancouver also describes as follows Kake Indian graves on Keku
Strait, Kupreanoff Island, which he saw in 1794:

In the vicinity of these rnins were many sepulchres or tombs, in which dead bodies
were deposited. These were made with a degree of neatness seldom exhibited in the
building of their habitations. A wooden frame was raised about 10 feet from the
ground, the upper half of which was inclosed, and in the open part below in many,
though not in all, of them was placed a canoe. The flooring of the upper part was
about 5 feet from the ground, and above that the sides and top were entirely closed
in with boards, within which were human bodies in boxes wrapped up in skins or in
matting. These repositories of the dead were of different sizes, and some of them
contained more bodies than the others; in the largest there were not more than four
or five, lying by the side of each other, not one appearing to be placed above the
rest; they were generally found near the water side, and very frequently on some
conspicuous point. Many of these sacred monuments seemed to have been erected a
great length of time, and the most ancient of them had evidently been repaired and >
strengthened by additional supporters of more modern workmanship. Hence it
would appear that whatever might be the enmity that existed between the several
tribes when living, their remains when dead were respected and suffered to rest
quietly and unmolested.t

An earlier description (1793) by Vancouver of some graves up Behm >
canal, near Point Nelson, is as follows:

Near the ruins of a few temporary huts of the natives we found a box about 3 feet
square and 14 feet deep, in which were the remains of a human skeleton, which
appeared from the confused situation of the bones, either to have been cut to pieces,
or thrust with great violence into this small space.

These were not numerous, and from the circumstances they con-
cluded that only “ certain persons” were thus entombed.t

Another description by the same author (August, 1793) of a grave at
cape Northumberland, Graving group, South Alaska, is as follows:

On a high detached rock were the remains of a large village, much more exposed
to the inclemency of the weather than any residence of the natives I have before
seen. Here we found a sepulchre of a peculiar character. It was a kind of vault,
formed partly by the natural cavity of the rocks and partly by the rude artists of the
country. It was lined with boards, and contained some fragments of warlike imple-
ments, lying near a square box covered with mats, and very curiously corded down.§

This description is similar to one given to the writer by Judge J. G.
Swan, of Port Townsend, Washington Territory, as found by him in
1883, in a cave on North Island of the Queen Charlotte group.

From the descriptions that have been given it would appear that the
primitive methods of sepulture in this region were far from uniform in
their character. However, amongst those tribes which practised cre-

mation, the custom very generally obtained cf depositing the ashes in
boxes mounted on columns or on shelves or compartments in the col-
umns themselves.

DEPOSITORY OF ASHES.

Vancouver describes a method which he saw at Cross Sound, in 1793,
as follows :

Here were erected two pillars, 15 feet high and 4 feet in circumference, painted
white; on the top of each was placed a large square box; on examining one of them
it was found to contain many ashes and pieces of burnt bones, which were considered to
behuman. These relics were carefully wrapped up in skins and old mats, and at the
base of the pillars was placed an old canoe in which were some paddles.*

Plate LxIv., Figs. 340 and 343, show two types of primitive Haida
sepulture of cremated ashes, on the site of the ancient and abandoned
Kaigani village of Chasina, at the entrance of the Cholmondeley Sound,
Prince of Wales Island, Alaska. The boxes containing the ashes have
somewhat fallen into decay, but are seen on the shelves. This is the
most primitive form of the sepulture of ashes. Fig. 341 is the sketch
of a column at Kasa-an, Prince of Wales Island (Kaigani) in which
the shelf and compartment containing the ashes are boarded up. This
was generally the custom, and a curious survival of it is shown in Fig. .
344, from Masset (Queen Charlotte Islands), in which the boards are
simply nailed across the top of the post or column in the semblance
of a box, while the body itself is deposited elsewhere in some other
form of sepulture. In this we have both a commemorative column and
an imitation of the ancient or former method of depositing the ashes,
very much as to-day the funeral urn in marble marks with us, in some
instances, the site of a grave in which the body is inhumed. The form
given to the cross boards is that of an end or one side of a funeral box
carved with the totem of the deceased. Fig. 342 of the same plate
represents another form of depositing, in which the compartment con-
taining the body of the dead or the boxes of ashes is borne between two
plain columns or posts from about 6 to 10 feet apart, there being
room for the body or two or more boxes on the shelf. This is also
boarded up. The sketch is from one by the writer, made at the village
of Kaigani, near Cape Muzon (latitude 549, 38’ N.), the southernmost
village of Alaska. There is every reason to believe that at this now
almost abandoned village we tind the most primitive form in which
these depositories existed. Marchand, who visited the Queen Char-
lotte Islands in 1791, says:

These monuments are of two kinds; the first and most simple are composed only
of a wooden column about 10 feet high and 1 foot in diameter, on the summit of
which planks are secured, forming a platform. In some this platform is supported by
two columns. The corpse, deposited on this platform, is covered with moss and large
stones. The graves of the second kind are more elaborate; four posts planted in the
ground, and supporting, only 2 feet above the ground, a sarcophagus artistically or-
namented and hermetically sealed.t

304 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 18838.

As cremation preceded aerial deposit with the Haida, it is to be pre-
sumed that the forms of sepulture illustrated in Figs. 340 to 343 in-
elusive, from the Kaigani villages, antedate in type those described by
Marchand. According to Lisiansky (1805) the same forms as described
by the latter were found amongst the Tlingit at Sitka, excepting that
the ashes were deposited instead of the corpse:

The bodies here are burned, and the ashes, together with the bones that remain un-
consumed, deposited in wooden boxes, which are placed on pillars, that have difter-
ent figures painted and carved on them, according to the wealth of the deceased.
On taking possession of our new settlement [Sitka] we destroyed a hundred at least
of these, and I examined many of the boxes.*

Fig. 345 represents a survival of the form of deposit in which the box
is supported by two posts from the village of Skidegate, Queen Char-
lotte Islands, the boards from post to post having the semblance of the
end of a huge box, in which the ashes or remains were formerly de-
posited. This is similarin significance to the one shown in Fig. 544,
being a survival of the semblance of a former custom. Wherever cre-
mation was practised in this region, it seems to have been the earlier
custom to deposit the ashes in boxes on columns. These latter must
- however be distinguished from the strictly commemorative columns
erected to “ giorify the dead.” The carved columns, erected at the end
of the village, as in Plate 111, stand somewhat between the two, having
the double purpose of “ glorifying the dead” and serving as mortuary col-
umns, to symbolize the old and mark the new form of the interment:
of the remains. While they do not in themselves serve as a sepulchre
or receptacle, they seem in a vague way to have had their origin in the
ancient custom of depositing the dead in boxes on or shelves in these
carved columns. The origin of the custom of cremation amongst the
northern tribes of this region seems traceable to the belief that a piece
of the flesh in the possession of an enemy gave him the power to work
evil to his spirit and to his kin. This belief in witchcraft is general
throughout the coast. Dunn gives acurious illustration of thisamongst
the Kwakiutl. He says of his. dealings with them:

This exasperated the Indians against me; and they gave me the name of shloapes,
i. e., ‘stingy ;” and when near them, if I should spit, they would run and try to take
up the spittle in something; for, according, as they afterwards informed me, they
intended to give it to their doctor or magician; and he would charm my life away.t

The bodies of warriors killed in battle were formerly cremated, the
head being severed from the body and preserved in a box, supported
by two poles over the box holding his ashes. This was the form of
sepulchre described by Dixon amongst the Yakutat, as previously
quoted in this chapter, the idea of cremation being to prevent an enemy
from mutilating the body. Itis believed also amongst the Tlingit that
the souls or spirits of those whose bodies are cremated will be very
comfortable in the spirit world. Whatever may have been the origin

of cremation, with them it would seem that the reasons for it were not
convincing to the larger portion of the southern Tlingit, Haida, and
Tsimshian, where sepulture by interment is practised similar to our
method of burial.

Amongst the northern Tlingit, where cremation is still practised to
a considerable extent, the present form of sepulture is that shown in
Fig. 352, Plate LXv1, which represents a group of graves near Sitka
similar to the type found in other northern Tlingit villages. They are
simply frame houses, with a small window or opening in the side,
through which the boxes containing the cremated ashes of the dead
are introduced. The funeral boxes containing the ashes of the differ-
ent members of a family rest side by side on the floor, raised a few
feet above the ground, and are generally visible through the window.
The form of construction and interior arrangement is illustrated in Fig.
348, Plate Lxv. The window is sometimes covered with a Chilkat
blanket, as in the illustration, serving to adorn the outside, and to in-
dicate that the remains of persons of wealth repose within. The
wooden knob or ball on top is frequently replaced by a carved totemic
figure. The dead houses are often painted with totemic designs on the
outer walls, and ornamented with scalp locks and other trophies of the
deceased.

Cremation is not the universal practice even amongst the northern
Tlingit, a large proportion of sepulture being by inhumation. Langs-
dorff (1805) says that sometimes at Sitka, ‘ The corpse is laid out in a
new chest, and interred in a remote part of the forest, commonly be-
tween four trees forming a square.” Figs. 347 and 349, Plate Lxy,
illustrate modified forms of sepulture at Fort Wrangell (Stikine)
Alaska. The former is the grave of Chief Shustack, on Shustack
Point, at the south entrance to Wrangell Anchorage, directly opposite
the town. It represents a form of aerial sepulture, in that the remains
are not actually buried in the ground, but remain above the surface en-
closed in abox. Fig. 349 is that of an Indian chief of the Wolf totem,
the form of construction being similar to that of Fig. 346, the grave of
a Shaman or medicine man.

SHAMAN GRAVES.

These are uniform in type amongst all the Tlingit, and have been the
same from time immemorial, as their bodies have never been burned, for
the reason that it is acommon superstition that fire will not touch them.
The bodies are doubled up with the chin near the knees and the upper
part covered with a bark or basket-work mat. The graves are of the
type shown in Fig. 346, Plate Lxv, and are invariably located at some
little distance from the village on a small island, conspicuous point, or
high promontory, sometimes selected by themselves before death. The
sepulchre itself consists of a small pen or enclosure of logs, usually ele-
vated above the ground on four short posts, and facing towards the
506 | REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

water, the roof sloping back in the other direction. The body is borne
to the grave in the canoe he used in life; is lowered into the sepulchre
through an opening in the roof, and deposited on its side on the floor.
With it are placed the talisman, charms, and paraphernalia which served
in life to give the power of evil to their possessor. The canoe is hauled
up on the beach near the grave with the paddles in it, in preparation
for launching, and sometimes placed on rollers or skids.* These
graves are usually along some frequented water-course, and are very
conspicuous. Whenever an Indian passes one of them in his canoe he
drops an offering of some value (usually a piece of tobacco) into the
water to propitiate the yake of the deceased and bring fair winds and
good luck to the superstitious donor.

Amongst the Haida and Tsimshian, the shaman graves are usually
small and made of split boards instead of logs, but are substantially
the same in form as the Tlingit ones here described. The body is, how-
ever, more usually deposited in a sitting posture. The only ones who
have the privilege of looking intu these graves are the other shaman,
who sometimes, under the inspiration of a dream, can goto them and
remove certain charms of the deceased for their own use. The ordinary
Indian, however, has a most wholesome dread of these graves, and be-
lieves that if in passing one he sees any part of the bones protruding
through the flesh either himself or some member of his family will soon
die. :

SLAVES.

The custom with regard to slaves that died a natural death was to
throw the bodies into the sea or otherwise cast them aside. Certain
slaves, however, were selected by a master to be killed or sacrificed at
his funeral ceremonies, in order that their spirits might accompany his
in the next world and minister to it as they did to him in life. Those
so selected esteemed it a great honor, as their bodies were accorded the
same sepulture as their master’s. In ease of cremation the bodies of
the slaves were cremated with that of their master, or in case of inter-
ment were buried with it, thus securing to their spirits a comfortable
time in the next world. Slaves killed on the occasion of a person of
consequence building a house or giving a great feast were accorded also
the right of burial of a freeman. There is, therefore, no special form
of sepulture for slaves.

CHRISTIAN BURIAL.

Under the religious influence of missionaries the Indians have been
led to give up many of their former customs, and inhumation or inter-
ment is gradually supplanting all other forms of sepulture. Fig. 350,
Plate LXVI, is a characteristic group of modern Tlingit graves at Na-

* This is the case at a grave. near Point Nesbitt, Zarembo Island, described for the
writer by Lieut. D. W. Coffman, U. 8. Navy.

ah Bay (Tlingit), in southern Alaska. The body is enclosed in a rough
casket and buried, a temporary tent of white sheeting being erected
over the grave. Later this is replaced by either a fence, as shown in
Fig. 352, or a pyramidal structure surmounted by a cross, as in Fig.
350, or an eagle or other totemic carving, as in Fig. 351. This fencing
in of the grave is now quite generally practised throughout the region
of the Tsimshian, Kaigani, and southern Tlingit. Fig. 351 is a group of
graves near the village of Tongass (Tlingit). Plate 11 presents a view
in two sections of the grave-yard at the Kaigani village of Kasa-an,
Prince of Wales Island, and, with Plates Lxv and LXVI, gives a general
idea of the graves seen to-day in this region, being sketches, or sketches
from photographs, with one exception, taken by the writer in 1585~87.

IN GENERAL.

As a summary, it may be stated that Christian burial is rapidly sup-
planting all other forms. Cremation is still in vogue amongst the north-
ern Tlingit, the ashes either being deposited in boxes in a small house,
or, according to Dunn, in boxes in a secluded spot in the woods. *

Amongst the other tribesinterment is now pretty generally practised,
the spot being marked either by a carved column, or by an enclosure in
the form of a fence.

MORTUARY CEREMONIES.

Although the methods of sepulture have changed in recent years, the
attendant ceremonies have not altered much. On the demise of an im-
portant personage in this region, it is customary to array the body in
ceremonial apparel and surround it with the tokens of his or her wealth.
Thus laid out in state, the relatives and friends of the deceased view the
remains. In the case of the death of a great and well-known chief, In-
dians come from other villages, and the body is thus displayed until in
an advanced stage of decomposition, when the final rites take place.
Dunn (1835) says of the Tsimshian, ‘* When a chief dies, he is, before in-
terment, dressed up, his face painted, and placed, sitting up, in a canoe,
and paddled round the maritime village, looking almost life-like.” *
Amongst the Haida, Tsimshian, Kaigani, and southern Tlingit, when
cremation was practised, the attendant ceremonies were about as fol-
lows:

The members of families belonging to the wife’s totem, and to totems
other than that of the deceased, were invited to a mourning feast, last-
ing usually four days. The feasting and display of the body in state were
accompanied by the dismal lamentations and wailing of the mourners,
who, after the guests had entered and were seated, came in dressed in
mourning costume and leaning on long staves or carved ceremonial
Sticks. Arriving in the middle of the floor, they wept, moaned, wailed,

058 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

and sang in a most dismal manner. In the intervals of mourning the
feasting took place, and it was then also that the slaves were sacrificed.
The nearest relative or leading man who gave the feast despatched the
slaves by a sharp blow on the head with a “slave-killer,” a variety of
which instruments is Shown in Plate xLy1. The most elaborate kinds
were carved from deer antlers, but the points were sometimes of copper
or stone. ‘

Usually the body of the deceased was borne to the pyre and burned
at the beginning or on the first day of the ceremonies, the feasting and
mourning following that event. In any case, the bearers of the body
are the invited guests. The funeral pile is usually built just back of the
house of the deceased. The mourners range themselves around the
funeral pyre, their faces painted black, their hair cut short, and some-
times their heads covered with eagle’s down. It was the early custom
amongst the Tlingit to disjoint the body before burning it. Sometimes
the pipe was passed around before the fire was lighted, which last was
done at asignal from the master of ceremonies. As the fire was lighted,
drums were beaten, and the mourners wailed and cried until the pyre
was consumed. The ashes and burnt bones were collected in an elabo-
rately carved wooden box, which was deposited in the mortuary houses,
or on the columns described. The relatives washed and repainted their
faces, presents were made to the guests who had assisted, and a feast
took place, terminating the ceremonies.*

An anonymous writer in the American Naturalist thus describes a-
Tlingit funeral which he witnessed :

In one corner of the room we found the corpse, completely encased in blankets,
which in turn were enveloped by a large woven sea-grass mat, and tied up in such a
manner as to bring the knees nearly to the chin, and, thus enshronded, it was placed
in asitting posture. The house was about half filled with Indians—men, women,
and children.

On one side of the room a young brave was busily engaged with a pair of scissors
in cutting off the long black hair of all the near relatives, male and female. This
seems to be one of the usnal mourning customs among these Indians. After he had
completed this tonsorial duty, during which he had been frequently interrupted by
their sudden outbursts of grief, a procession of about twenty Indian warriors, headed by
old An-a-hoots, the war chief of the tribe, filed through the small portal. Each carried
in his hand a long slender staff made of a hard wood and carved all over with fantastic
figures, while bright-colored Hudson Bay blankets fell in not ungraceful folds from
their broad, square shoulders. These staves bore evidence of their great age by the
high poiish which they possessed, as well as by their smoky colorandpungentodor. The
warriors ranged themselves in line along one side of the house, facing the center, and
immediately began a lugubrious death chant, keeping time by raising their staves
about three inches from the floor and letting them drop together. This doleful air

was much more monotonous than musical.
All this time the relatives of the deceased were rending the air with their lamenta-

tions. Every Indian present had his face thickly smeared with a fresh coat of seal
oil and black paint, thus rendering himself inconceivably hideous,

At the close of the death song two stalwart young braves mounted to the roof and
lowered bark ropes through the aperture, which were made fast to the matting that
enveloped the corpse. An-a-hoots made a sign to the young men, and they began
raising the body toward the opening in the roof. They always remove their dead
from their houses in this manner, instead of through the door, on account of a super-
stition they have that the spirit of the defunct made its exit in this way. But just as
it arrived at the roof one of the ropes broke, precipitating the lifeless bundle upon the
fire below, scattering the burning coalsinevery direction. For a moment all was ter-
ror, confusion, anddismay. Theshrieks and yells of superstitious horror that went up
from the women and children baffle description. The body was hastily snatched from
the fire and hurriedly carried out through the door to the funeral pyre, which was
about 40 yards in rear of the house.*

The following is a description of an Indian cremation witnessed at
Sitka, Alaska, during the winter of 1886~87, as described for the writer
by Lieut. George Barnett, U. S. Marine Corps:

For several days after death the body was lying in state, surrounded by all articles
of value which had been the property of the deceased. The face was covered with a
mask, and on the head was a handsome head-dress trimmed with ermine skins which
hung down the back; the body, which was in a sitting posture, was covered with
Chilkat blankets.

During the time the body was lying in state some of the friends of the deceased
kept up a doleful chant, keeping time with carved mourning sticks, while others pre-
pared the funeral pile in rear of the house; this pile was made of yellow cedar logs
so arranged that a solid mass was formed about 3 feet high and then the sides and
one end were continued for about 2 or 3 feet more, thus forming a box open at one
end and on top, extra logs being on hand to cover the top and fill the open end after
the body was in place.

When all was ready four men took hold of the corners of the blanket, which had
been placed on the floor under the corpse, and carried all to the window, resting it
on the window-sill, where it was held by four women, while the men went out through
the door and again took hold outside of the window; they then carried the body
toward the pile, while an old woman, who was left in the house, took a tin pan and
gathered up some coals and ashes from the fire in the center of the house; she car-
ried the fire to the window and threw it out after the body, as she said, to purify the
house; she then took up a small dog and likewise threw it out of the window to ac-
company the departed.

Under no circumstances will the Indians take a corpse out through the door; if
there is no window, they will make a hole in the side of the house or take it out through
the smoke-hole in the roof.

The body was then placed in the hollow part of the pile and the top and end logs
put in place, after which all was covered with seal oil and the fire started.

During the burning two men used long poles to stir the fire, so that all would be
burned; at the same time about a dozen mourners with their faces blackened kept
up a funeral chant, keeping time by beating on the ground with their funeral sticks.

About 30 or 40 feet from the fire a hole had been dug in the ground and partially
covered with brush, and here the widow was attended by several female friends, who
combed her hair and changed her clothes, as they said, to cleanse her and make her

eligible for matrimony again.

After the corpse was consumed the bones and ashes were collected and placed in

360 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Indian boxes, which were deposited in the dead house in rear of the former house of
the deceased,

Although large quantities of unburned wood remains after a cremation, the Indians
will not use it, but will go miles for their fuel rather than act contrary to custom
founded on superstition.

The trives that now do not practice cremation, such as the Haida,
Kaigani, and southern Tlingit, enclose the corpse in a sitting posture
in a large covered box, similar to those ordinarily used, and stow it
away in the dead house, which is usually a shed or small house behind
the lodge of the deceased or at one end of the village. Some of these
dead houses contain tbree or four bodies. After the ceremony of de-
positing the box, the brother, or other near relative, gives a potlatch
and a feast to repay those who have contributed to the ceremony,
either in helping construct the box, or the dead house, or in carrying
the body. This practice is not very different where the body is interred
according to the rites of Christian burial or in imitation of it. The
mourning, feasting, and painting of the face is still generally practised
with any form of burial, save that directly under the supervision of the
missionaries. :

It is the present custom, however, amongst the Kaigani, Haida, and
southern Tlingit when a chief or very wealthy person dies, to display
the body in state for awhile and then enclose it in a casket, which re-
mains in the house in which the deceased lived, the other occupants
moving out and finding quarters elsewhere. The casket is surrounded
by the boxes containing the ceremonial apparel of the deceased, bis
household utensils, personal property, and tokens of wealth in general,
and thus left for several years, admission being given from time to
time to visitors to view the spectacle. Plate LXVIT is a view of such a
disposition of the body of the famous chief Skowl, at Kasa-an village,
Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, from a photograph by the writer.
Plate Lx vit, Fig. 353, is a view of chief Shakes lying in state at Fort
Wrangell, Alaska.

The grandest feasts and ceremonies in this region are in honor of the
dead, and in celebration and commemoration of the prowess, good
birth, and wealth of the deceased.

SHAMAN BURIAL.

Dall, speaking of the customs at the death of a shaman, says:

For the first night he remains lying in the corner where he died; but on the fol-
lowing day he is removed to the opposite corner, and this is continued until the body
has visited each of the four corners of the house. All the inmates of the house fast
meanwhile. On the fifth day the body, dressed in the garb of his profession, is bound
to a board. Two ivory or bone wands, which the shaman used in his performances,
are placed, the one in the cartilage of the nose, and the other in the hair, which is tied
together. The head is covered with a piece of basket-work, and the body is carried
to its final resting place.*

Chief Skowl] died in the winter of 1882-83, and, according to the custom of the
region, his body was first displayed in state dressed in the ceremonial robes of a
chief. Later it was inclosed in a casket and deposited, as shown, on a pile of boxes
containing his clothing and ceremonial dance paraphernalia. The group is at the
end of the building, opposite the entrance, between the two carved posts holding
the rafters of the house. The piles of boxes, all full of valuables, the row of cop-
pers, the bronze howitzer, etc., all indicate the rank and wealth of the deceased.
Just below the casket are grouped his personal household utensils, consisting of
porcelain bowls, platters, wooden buckets, spoons, etc., which are cared for as per-

SUMMARY.

It is impossible to generalize with regard to the mortuary customs of
the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian. The methods of sepulture differ
in different localities, and have undergone many changes since the ad-
vent of the whites. Around Sitka the custom of burning the dead has
obtained from the earliest times, but the sepulture of the ashes has
radically changed; whereas, cremation has now been almost entirely
given up by the Tsimshian, Haida, and southern Tlingit, having been
originally somewhat the prevailing custom. With regard to the burial of
shamans the custom seems to have been from the earliest times the same
as now, and quite uniform in character throughout the northern region
of the coast,

Festivities in general in this region consist in singing, dancing, feast-
ing, and in the distribution of presents; in the parade of ceremonial
paraphernalia, and in elaborate ceremonies, accompanied by all the
pomp and display that native wealth, ingenuity, and resource can add
to make them effective. Invitations to attend are sometimes extended
only to the people of certain totems in the settlement; sometimes the
whole village is invited; often all from distant tribes are summoned.
The host invites according to the significance of the entertainment, or
to his resources and abilities to bear the expense. People of small
means do not as arule go outside of tieir own village, while a chief,
from his wealth and the dignity due his position, extends his summons
to the people of distant villages. Long before the occasion messen-
gers are sent out to notify the guests, the invitation being general,
to men, women, and children. Some of the ceremonies are initiatory
in their nature, celebrating the advance of children towards manhood
or womanhood; some mark the endeavor of men to attain respect and
consideration by the display of wealth, by the giving of presents, and
by lavish entertainment; while others are obligatory on aspirants for
rank or authority. Running through it all are the regard for wealth
and show; the petty envies, jealousies, and rivalries of ambitious indi-
viduals and families; the tricks, fictions, and debasements to attain
ends; the love of applause, power, and advancement; and, above all,
a nicety in the gradation of presents to correspond with the abilities
of the recipients to return in kind. This marks a great step in the
evolution of the sentiment of gratitude, which is purely a product or
attribute of civilization. In facet, in this curious social organization,
based on wealth and family, we recognize so many touches of nature,
that our kinship with them is too apparent to admit of our judging

them harshly. Time and whitewash have accomplished wonders for
us, but the coating is too thin in places to entirely conceal our savage
selves of yesterday.

On all festive occasions, which are numerous, singing and dancing
are indulged in, the social proclivities being strong withinthem. The
dancing usually takes place indoors, and is accompanied by the singing
of a selected few, who sit apart and beat on a drum similar to that
shown in Fig. 302, Plate Lvit, the time being still further emphasized
by the leader or others, who carry rattles or thump on the floor or ground
with batons similiar to those shown in Plate xvi.

Dancing.—Some of the dances are stately, dignified, and formal; some
are wild, passionate, and furioas ; others are ludicrous; but in general
the method of dancing them is the same, the movements simply being
slow or exaggerated, as the case may be. It consists mainly in contor-
tion of the body and hips, with the feet firmly planted and the knees
slightly bent. The body is wiggled and swayed from side to side or
forward and backward, the legs remaining bent at about the same
angle. The dancers advance or change about, by a spasmodic hop
or shuffling of the feet, but the movements of the feet play only a
small part in the so-called dancing itself. Now and then, with the in-
troduction of a new figure or movement by the leader, or the interjec-
tion of a witty remark by one of the dancers, the audience will laugh
or express its approval by gruntsand cries. As the dance proceeds the
movements gradually become more and more animated. The leader
now and then addresses remarks and ejaculations to the singers and to
the other dancers, and the din and contortions are redoubled in fury.
Suddenly the music stops and the dancers rest. The costumes worn are
various, depending upon the signifiance of the dance; head dresses of
cedar bark, and the tall chief’s head dresses (Fig. 35) filled to the top
with birds’ down; Chileat and cedar blankets ; masks of various kinds .
and devices; cedar-bark girdles; ceremonial coats and Jeggings ; rattles
and whistles ; dance wands and mechanically working snappers ; wooden
helmets; ceremonial bows and arrows; wooden spears and batons of
rank; to all this add the painted faces and bodies, the eagle’s down
on the heads and over the paint, and the clouds of birds’ down blown
from tubes and scattered by the dancers, and one has an outline of
these picturesque and interesting gatherings. Some members of the
tribe become famous as dancers and as wits. Their antics and contor-
tions are always watched with interest, and their sallies greeted with
laughter by the women and children. This individual may be a woman
or man, or formerly might have been a favorite slave, who posed as a
clown or fool to amuse the multitude, and who was granted many priv-
ileges not given to other slaves. Amongst the Tlingit the men do most
of the dancing, whereas amongst the Haida and Tsimshians both sexes
participate alike, sometimes one or the other, or both, taking part.
364 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Dawson, in a recent magazine article, thus deseribes a dance which he
saw at Skidegate, Queen Charlotte Islands:

The performers, about twenty in number, were dressed according to no uniform
plan. * * * ‘Some had rattles, and added to the din by shaking these furiously at
the accentuated parts of the song. Five women took part in the dance, standing in
front in a row, and were dressed with some uniformity, several having the peculiarly
valuable cedar bark or goat’s wool shawls made by the Tsimshians. The head dresses
of the women were all alike, consisting in each case of a small mask or semblance
of a face carved neatly in wood and inlaid with pearly haliotis shell. * * * *
The drum was beaten very regularly with double knocks—thus, tum tum, tum tum,
tum tum—and with the sound the dancers kept time in a sort of chant or song to
which words are set, and which swells into a full chorus or dies away according to
the notions of a leader, who stood among the dancers, who, besides marking time,
now and then gave a few words of direction or exhortation. *~ * * To the drum-
ming and singing the dancing also keeps time, following it very closely. At every
beat a spasmodic twitch passes through the crowd of dancers, who scarcely lift their
feet from the floor, but move by double jerks, shuffling the feet a little at the same
time. After the performance has continued for ten minutes or so the master of the
ceremonies gives a sign and all stop with a loud hugh! The dance is resumed by the
perspiring crowd at the signal of the drum, which strikes up after a few moments’
rest has been allowed.

Langsdorff (1805) thus describes a dance which he saw at Sitka:

The dance itself consists chiefly in a very eager spring, in executing which the
dancers scarcely remove at all from one spot. They are all barefooted, and wear a
single garment only, commonly the woolen carter’s frock mentioned above. One of
the dancers seems, as it were, to lead the rest, carrying in his hand a thick sort of a
staff ornamented with the teeth of sea-otters; with this he strikes upon the ground
to mark the measure, All, without exception, hold in their hands either the tail or
wing of the white-headed eagle or a piece of ermine. The latter is valued by them
very highly as an article of Juxury. They not only ornament their heads with it,
and hold it in their hands, but sew it about their garments. The women sit upon
the ground at the distance of some paces from the dancers, and sing a not inharmo-
nious melody, which supplies the place of music.*

This description of a dance answers very much to one seen by the
writer at Fort Wrangell, in September, 1887, called the “stick” dance,
in imitation of the Tinne Indians of the interior, up the Stikine River.
It consisted in raising the feet alternately in quick succession as high
as possible, without moving the body, to the sound of a drum, chorus,
and rattle. It differs radically from the usual coast Indian dancing.
From the details given by Langsdorff it would appear that the carry-
ing of white plumes indicates that the ceremonials which he witnessed
were those of welcome and friendship or peace, as they took place after
strained relations between the Russians and Indians. In the “stick”
dance, witnessed at Wrangell, the Indians wore the buckskin costume
of the Tinne, andit was given only for the amusement of the guests.
As a summary it may be stated that amongst the Tsimshian, Haida, and -
Tlingit the form of most dancing ceremonies is as follows:

The guests sit around on the elevated ledges on the sides, as does
also the chorus, which latter keeps time to the beating of a drum or

*Langsdorff, Voyages, Part 11, p. 114.
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 365

tambourine. There is a master of the ceremonies, who leads off the
chorus, and who may himself participate in the dance. The song is
usually in praise of the strength, riches, and prowess of the host, and
to this the dancers keep time with rattles, grunts, contortions of the
body, and shuffling of the feet, or spasmodic hopping, with knees con-
stantly bent. Dancing is an invariable accompaniment of potlatch
ceremonies, but may take place without the distribution of gifts.

The potlatch.—This is one of the most wide-spread and curious cus-
toms on the northwest coast. It has its origin not only in the custom
of the exchange of gifts, but in securing the good-will of others by
presents. To procure a wife; to enter the ranks or obtain the influ-
ence of medicine men; to become a great chief; to give social standing
to one’s children; to take on oneself the name of a paternal ancestor;
to build a house; to become a respected member of the community; to
atone for a wrong done; to resent an insuit—property in some form or
other must be sacrificed either by destroying it, to show one’s rage,
erief, or disregard of wealth, or by giving it away to obtain the good-
will of others. The accumulation of property is a necessity in these
Indian communities in order to stand well in them, and wealth becomes
primarily the basis of social organization. Under the head of wealth
the general question of property has been discussed. In a potlatch all
kinds of personal and household property—blankets, dishes, bowls,
canoes, guns, ammunition, money, mirrors, knives, garments, spears,
furs, robes, pots, kettles, spoons, etc.—are give away. Discrimination
must, however, be made between a reward for services rendered, dam-
ages mulcted, or the dot paid to the wife’s parents, and the ceremonial
distribution of gifts, which last is the potlatch proper. The custom is
a very widely-spread one, and is practised by some tribes of the inte-
rior, even east of the Rocky Mountains, particularly amongst those of
the Dakotan stock.

Amongst the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian the potlatch is a per-
fectly systematized distribution, involving much more thoughtful con-
sideration and balancing of obligations than the giving of a select
german or limited entertainment by a well-recognized leader of society
in any of our large cities. The occasions on which they are given will
be enumerated later on in the description of the different ceremonies.
In general, the more frequently and liberally an Indian distributes
property the better his standing with the others, the greater his chances
of reaching the dignity of chief in his village, and the more is due him
when some other member performs the same ceremony. An ordinary
man confines his potlatch to-those of his own village, while a chief usu-
ally sends out to certain individuals of distant villages by name. Often
a chief is assisted by his people, whom, in this case, he invites to a
feast, and from whom atterwards he receives gifts which, with those
of his own, are given away subsequently at the grand potlateh. When-
ever it is the intention of an individual, other than the head chief,
366 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

to make such a distribution, he calls together his friends and rela-
tives, makes an inventory of his property, and, with their help, makes
out a list of persons to whom he intends giving presents and what,
articles go to each. It is often the custom, however, previous to eall-
ing together the friends, for the host to’ quietly distribute his property
among his friends and the principal people of the village, who by eti-
quette are required just before the time set for the potlatch to return
the presents with interest or increase—that is, for four blankets to re-
turn six, or in some such ratio. In this way all the tribe immediately
concerned know what they are to get, and the immediate friends and
relatives know what the visitors are to receive. The inventory being
made ont and the council of advisers assembled, the list is read out
name by name. AS soon as a name is read, the friends present ex-
press their approval or disapproval of the intention to give the indi-
vidual named such and such present. The list being finally made
out, the messengers are sent out to announce the date and to invite
the guests. On the assembling of the guests, on the date fixed, feast-
ing and dancing are indulged in. If the occasion is for the purpose
of raising a house, cutting out and erecting a new carved column, or
undertaking some industrial enterprise requiring the combined effort
of many, the feasting and dancing alternate with the work, gambling
being indulged in during spare times, and the distribution takes place
when the work in hand is finished, after which all disperse. In this
case, however, the gifts are in the nature somewhat of reward for serv-
ices, and go to the guests pure and simple, the relatives receiving none;
but in case of a grand potlatch, unconnected with the industrial idea,
all receive presents according to the list made out. In any case, how-
ever, the distribution is the final ceremony, and is conducted as follows:
The guests all being assembled, the goods are displayed about the
walls and on poles and cords or piled up on the floor in a great mound.
The host stands or sits arrayed in ceremonial attire, and presides over
the affair with the cerenionial baton in his hand. The herald blows a
call similar to that shown in Fig. 334, announces the opening of the
ceremony in a speech, extolling the liberality and prowess of the host,
and calls a name, giving the present he is to receive. An attendant
takes the present and deposits it in front of the person who is to re-
ceive it, where it remains until all are thus honored, the names being
called out one by one. On the announcement of each name, the host
solemnly nods his head and thumps on the floor with his baton. The
whole ceremony forcibly reminds one, in a general way, of a Sunday-
school Christmas-tree distribution. Formerly slaves were given away
to the rich and powerful visitors, but to the poorer guests worn-out
blankets, or even pieces or strips of blankets were and still are given,
on the principle that to those who have shall be given. A song is sung,
a dance performed, and the guests disperse, but frequently a repetition
of the whole affair occurs in the next lodge, and so on until the whole
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 367

community has coutributed to make the affair one long to be remem-
bered, and handed down by tradition as an epoch in the history of the
village.

Feasts.—So far we have considered in general dancing, singing, and
the distribution of presents. In preparation for a feast the northern
Indians (Tsimshian, Haida, and Tlingit), if not now at least formerly,
washed off all the old paint, and, after smearing their bodies with
fresh grease, repainted their faces, chests, and arms red, etching on
their totemic designs, and sprinkling it all with white down in a full-
dress but polite coating of tar and feathers. The feasts consist of all
kinds of food, quantity being the chief requisite. ‘This, however, is
served on large feast dishes and eaten with ceremonial spoons, both of
which have beer illustrated in the accompanying plates. The guests
sit around on the ledges or surrounding platforms, and all eat out of
the dishes nearest at hand. The feasts are usually kept up as long as
there is anything to eat. ;

I.—INITIATORY CEREMONIES.

In this class are included all the ceremonies that mark the different
steps in life from birth to death. Funeral ceremonies have been de-
scribed. The most important voluntary step in life, and one that has
the greatest significance in our higher civilization at least, is matri-
mony.

Marriage.—As a rule the Indians marry young. Polygamy is the
natural result of the custom by which a sister’s son or a brother falls
heir to the relict of the uncle or brother, in addition to his own wife.
While the custom is now dying out, vet it is in the relations of the
sexes that the Indians most tenaciously cling to old-time customs.
Polygamy is rare, but the number of wives is regulated purely by the
ability or desire of the husband to maintain them. Dunn (1834) men-
tions a Sebassa (Tsimshian) chief who had twenty wives and hosts of
slaves.* The first wife has precedence. It is not uncommon amongst
the Tlingit for “rich and substantial men to have two wives, an old
and a young one.”+ Sometimes there is a great deal of sentiment in
the selection of a bride; sometimes a match is arranged or schemed
for by the families; but more often it is a commercial transaction of
buying and selling. A man desiring to marry a girl sends his mother
or a middle man to her parents to negotiate. An understanding having
been arrived at, he sends as many presents as he can get together to
her father. The ceremony is about the same throughout the northern
region, consisting mainly in the assembling of friends, the exchange of
presents, feasting, and dancing. The father invites all the daughter’s
relations to the ceremony. On the day appointed the man invites his

they enter and sit down at one end of the room, the girl and her rela-
tives being at the other. The young man’s friends make a speech in
his favor, and the girl’s relatives sing a song, after which the bride
goes over and sits down beside her to-be-husband and takes his hand.
Dall thus describes the further custom amongst the Tlingit:

All the guests dance and sing; when tired, diversifying the entertainment by eat-
ing. The pair do not join in any of the ceremonies. That their future life may be
happy they fast for two days. Then taking a little food to sustain life, they fast for
two days more. Four weeks afterwards they come together and are then recognized
as man and wife.*

When the ceremony is complete the father of the girl gives her a
dowry equal in value to that received from the husband, and she goes
to live with her father-in-law. If they afterwards separate through
dissatisfaction the presents are all returned; but if a wife is unfaithful,
the husband can send her back with nothing and get his own property
from the father. in any case the children go with the mother. The
husband may claim indemnity from his wife’s seducer. When the mar-
riage festival is all over, the fact is marked by the removal from the
bride’s lower lip of the button or pin, and the substitution of the plug
or labret.

Child-birth.—It appears that only amongst the Tlingit are peculiar
customs in vogue in the treatment of women at child-birth. Petroff
says in his report:

The special suffering imposed upon all womankind by nature is increased here a
hundred fold by ancient custom and superstition. At the time of child-birth, when
women more than at any other time are in need of assistance, the Tlingit females
are driven out of the house and left to their fate, shunned by everybody as unclean.
The child is born in the open air, no matter at what season, and only some time after
the birth is the mother allowed to enter a rude shed erected for the purpose, where
she is confined for ten days. * * * A new-born child is not allowed to taste its
natural food until it has vomited, and if this does not occur naturally its little
stomach is pressed and squeezed until the desired effect is secured. At the age of a
few weeks the babe is wrapped in furs and strapped upon a board, and is always car-
ried about by the mother. The infants are given the breast from ten to thirty months,
but they are accustomed to other food after they are a year old. The first strong
nourishment given them is generally the raw blubber of marine animals, except
that of the whale. As soon as the child begins to walk it is bathed daily in the sea,
without regard to the season, which accounts to some extent for the robustness of
the body of the Tlingit after he has once passed the tender age.t

This custom relating to women at child-birth is much less rigorously
carried out now than formerly, and diligent inquiry by the writer has
failed to discover that such practice was ever in vogue amongst the
Haida or Tsimshian. The cradle-board has been very generally aban-
doned in this whole region, the child being slung in a blanket or carried
in the arms, as with us. When used formerly the board was padded
with moss, which was renewed daily. Children are treated with great
kindness and leniency and rarely chastised. :

THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 369

Naming.—Children are given more than one name, but the custom
varies somewhat in different localities. The first is applied soon after
birth by the mother, and is usually that of a maternal ancestor or near
male relative of the mother. Ancestral names are preserved with the
greatest care, this being favored by the custom of erecting mortuary
columns and preserving traditions of the prowess of ancestors. The
first name is conferred without any ceremony. An exception to this
has been noted in the adoption of a son as an heir by a wealthy chief,
where his sister takes the child and figuratively adopts it, the name of
a paternal (or adopted maternal, which is the same) ancestor is applied
to the child. The chief makes her a present, and when the boy grows
up it becomes his duty to also suitably remember or reward her. Where
parents are too poor to prepare feasts for their children they retain their
first name; but with families of wealth there are several ceremonies
which must be complied with to insure social standing to their children.
The first ceremony is a very expensive one, involving in former times for
the parents an enormous outlay.

Piercing the nose and ears.—This most important ceremony is intended
to give social standing to the children, and involves, or formerly in-
volved (for the practice has almost gone out of date), the following de-
tails: (1) A house-building ‘‘ bee”; (2) a potlatch ; (3) the bestowal of
a second name on the child or children; (4) the freeing of slaves, and
(5) the piercing of the nose and ears, although not in the exact order
named. <A new house is first built for its express celebration, feasts
being given during the progress, and dancing, singing, and gambling
being indulged in. The relatives and guests being all assembied, the
final ceremonies take place as follows: (During the period when slaves
were held a number of them equal to that of the children for whom
the celebration was given at this point received their liberty.) The
children are brought forward according to their age, and the incisions
made in the septum of the nose and the lobe of the ear with a sharp
instrument or awl of copper, bone, shell, or iron. A second name is
bestowed on each, which amongst the Haida is (according to Dawson)
for male children determined as follows :

With the Haidas a first-born son may be called by the name of the mother’s eldest
brother; the second born after the mother’s second brother, or by one of the addi-
tional names of the first. Should the mother have no brother the name of some dead
friend is chosen, or in cases where the medicine man reveals the return of some one
formerly dead inthe new-born child, thename of the person supposed to be thus return-
ing to the tribe takes precedence ofall others. A chief’s sonis named by its mother af-
ter consultation with a medicine man, whom she pays. He takes a night to think, and
mayhaps dream, about it. Thereafter he gives the name of a deceased male relative
on the mother’s side, which is adopted. The ceremony of naming is witnessed by
many, and presents are given. * * * Fourtimes in all a youth changes his name,
always taking one from his mother’s family.*

After the naming a feast takes place, followed by singing, dancing,
and a grand potlatch, when all disperse and the festival comes to an

end. At the potlatch it may be well to mention, all the assembled peo-
ple, both relatives and guests, receive presents, which is different from
a simple house-building or other industrial ‘“‘bee,” where only the
guests are rewarded.

Tattooing—Amongst the Tlingit and Tsimshian, where tattooing is
not practiced, the child receives simply the birth name, the second name
as in the preceding, and either one or two other names later on, as here-
after explained. With the Haida, however, the ceremony of tattooing,
which occupies three separate occasions or gatherings, a name is each
time bestowed or assumed. According to Dawson* a bouse-building
bee and potlatch is given by the parents on the first two occasions of
the tattooing of a child or several children, and on the last occasion
the young man, aided by his mother’s people, makes the potlatch from
his own house and adopts formally the name of a maternal relative or
ancestor. On this occasion the tattooing is finished; but the ceremony
will be spoken of under the head of Last naming. The process of tat-
tooing has been described.

Puberty.—The ordeals through which a young girl was required to
pass on attaining the age of puberty were formerly very severe, but in
recent years have been almost entirely relaxed. Amongst the Tlingit
they were peculiarly trying, but the custom varied in different localities.
According* to Langsdorff, who was amongst them in 180405, it was
not ‘*uncommon when a young girl is grown up to shut her up, even for
a whole year, in a small house by herself at a distance from her family
and acquaintance, where she is kept constantly employed; the idea
is that by this means she acquires habits of industry and diligence,
reserve and modesty, which will afford the better chance of her becom-
ing a good wife, and lay a solid foundation for wedded happiness.” t
This exclusion, however, had a deeper reason, in that young girls were
at this period considered unclean, and both among the Haida and Tlin-
git were compelled to wear a peculiar cloak, hood, or hat as a badge of
seclusion, and to protect the sky from pollution. The face was painted
with charred fungus, and the girl required to fast more or less, only her
mother or a female slave being allowed to carry her food. Amongst
the Tlingit she was confined to a small hut for six months or so, but
amongst the Haida it was customary to screen off a corner of the house
and give her a separate fire and a separate exit out of a small back
door cut for the purpose. According to Dawson, if if was necessary
for her to pass out by the front door, preparations were made by remoy-
ing everything with which there might be danger of her coming in con-

‘tact. In meeting men she was required to avert her face and cover it
with a corner of her blanket. The hood or cloak she wore was made of
woven cedar-bark, nearly conical in shape, and reached down below the
breast, though open before the face.

* Dawson, Report, p. 131.
t Langsdorft, Voyages, Part I, p. 183,
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. o¢1

These or other similar customs were also in vogue among the Tsimshians, whose
practices so closely resemble the Haida’sin most respects. Among these people great
care was taken to teach the girlssubmission, contentment, and industry. At certain
times they were not allowed to lie down to sleep, but if overcome with drowsiness
must prop themselves in a sitting posture between boxes. Before drinking the cup
must be turned round four times in the direction of movement of the sun. It was
also usual for the mother to save all hairs combed out of the girl, and twist them into
cords, which were then tightly tied round the waist and ankles, and left there till they
fell to pieces of themselves. This was supposed to give a fine shape to the body. In
eating, the girl must always sit down to prevent a too great corpulence. If orphaned,
the various ceremonies must be again performed by the girl, even skougin already
attended to.*

If the parents were rich or important people, on releasing the girl a
great feast was given by the relatives in her honor by way of bringing
her out or making her début.

Bringing out.—On the occasion of the feast or ceremony celebrating.
the release of a girl from her seclusion, she was richly dressed (formerly
in sea-otter skins) and the garments worn during her restriction burned
up or otherwise destroyed. As arule this ceremony was accompanied
with more or less theatrical effect, in that the girl was seated on a divan
surrounded by borrowed wealth, and a curtain arranged to be removed
at a given signal. Dawson says:

Among the Tsimshian peculiar ceremonies exist in connection with the ‘“ bringing
out” of young women, and it is the occasion of public feasting. In case of a young
woman, the people being all collected, a curtain is raised, and she is seen sitting with
her back to the spectators, peculiarly dressed, and surrounded by a circle of upright
“coppers,” if enough can be mustered. She then begins to sing, or if she does not,
an old woman begins to sihg near her, and she becoming encouraged joins. The old
woman then gradually drops her voice till the novice is singing alone. She then
eventually makes a dance before all the people. The songs and dances are practised
before the time for the rite arrives. Similar customs probably exist among the
Haidas, though I did not learn any detail concerning them.t

A girl being thus Jaunched forth into the social life of the commu-
nity became eligible for marriage. In the general idea we see the be-*
ginnings of similar customs with which we are familiar in our own more
complex social organization.

Self-naming—Among the Tlingit and Tsimshian a child receives (1)
a birth name, (2) an ancestral name, (3) one other name as here ex-
plained, and (4) possibly a name late in life when a chief has a son
who becomes distinguished, and a name is bestowed on the former im-
plying that he is the father of this distinguished son. Among the
Haida two names are bestowed other than the first and second as above,
one each on two occasions when a youth undergoes the preliminary tat-
tooing. On the third and final tattooing the youth himself assumes a
fifth name after due ceremonies.

It is of this self-assumed name, the third amongst the Tlingit and
Tsimshian and fifth ones the Haida, that we shall here apeale AS

“Dawson, Report, p. 130, B. “+ Ibid., p. 131,
372 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

a youth of good family approaches man’s estate it becomes his duty to
accumulate all the property possible, and, with the help and material
contributions of his mother’s people, to make a grand feast and potlatch
from his own house. Practically it is simply a house-building “ bee,” in
which the young man erects his carved column and the rafters of his
house, takes on himself the name of an ancestor (usually maternal) ;
and becomes a petty chief or man of influence in the village. It is on
this occasion that the tattooing of the young Haida is finished and
when the aspirantfor honors drinks down the oil from the great wooden
spoon as shown in Fig 27 and Plate LI. These ceremonies are no-
where accurately described, and the writer gathered but a meagre out-
line of them at Port Simpson, British Columbia. The significance of
the affair is similar to that of the “bringing out” of girls, in that it
marks the arrival of the youth at man’s estate. At the conclusion of
the grand feast and potlatch, the young man is known by his newly
adopted name.

Chieftaincy—Chieftaincy is to a certain extent hereditary, but as it de-
pends upon wealth, any freeman who can accumulate property may, by
erecting a house and giving potlatches and feasts in honor of his ances-
tors, come finally to be the head of a household and be regarded as a
petty chief or one of the principal men of the village. Good birth and
wealthy and influential family connections are the first requisites of an
aspirant for the highest rank. To bea petty chief in the village a man
must practically be at the head of a household, hence the necessity for
building a house and for marrying. To build a house the united labor
of many people is required, hence the house-building “bees.” To re-
ward those who participate and to gain the good will of others, feasts
must be given and presents distributed ; hence the potlatch. To retain
the respect and esteem of others these feasts and potlatches must be re-
peated at intervals. By an alliance with medicine men, whose influence

eis purchasable, various deceits and tricks may be resorted to in order
to impose on the credulity of the vulgar herd and increase the respect
they have for the rank and power of the aspirant for honors. In order
to strengthen this feeling of respect itis necessary to brush up the coat-
of-arms, so to speak, and give a grand feast in honor of some departed
ancestor. This is called “ elorifying the dead,” and may take place a
few years after the decease of the relatives or many years atterwards.
Finally, by dint of giving feasts, potlatches, and “ bees;” by intrigue,
display, and prowess; by push, energy, and enterprise, the aspirant
finds himself in the front rank of the chiets, a respected and influential
elder in the village.

Glorification of the dead._In Chapter x11 the mortuary customs of
the different tribes of this region were discussed. On the death of a
chief, or other very important personage, the body, after lying in state
for a year or more, is finally interred with great ceremony, or, as amongst
the northern Tlingit, burned on a funeral pyre. It then-devolves upon

the brother or other relative to whom the estate of the deceased has
come down to erect a carved mortuary column in front of his house,
and give a grand feast and poflatch to glorify the dead. This is by far
the most elaborate and important ceremonial of these Indians. The
carved columns are shown in Plate LxIx, and in Vigs. 1, i79, 294, 344,
and 345, as well as in Plates 1 and 1 in the general views of Kasa-an
village. These are carved usually by one of the experts of the village,
and, although less costly than the large columns, are quite expensive.
The time being set for the ceremony, guests are invited from far and
near and entertained by the host and his relatives. The monumental
column is erected, and at the feast which follows speeches are made
extolling the virtues of the departed, but dwelling particularly upon
those of the giver of the feast. Although the latter practically squan-
ders his substance in thus entertaining his visitors, he feels well repaid
in receiving their expressions of approval and high esteem. Gambling,
feasting, and dancing occupy, as in all such gatherings, the leisure
time not devoted to the work or entertainment in hand.

Summary.—In these initiatory or commemorative ceremonies we see
the gradual identification of the individual with his totem and the cele-
bration of the different steps in the progress of the child from birth to
womanhood and manhood and in commemoration after death. .The
initiatory ceremonies of medicine men and of the four religious orders of
the Tsimshian are reserved for aspecial chapter, which wili not appear
with this paper, being withheld, with several others, on account of the
incompleteness of the data, and the hope on the part of the writer that
the task will be undertaken by some organized department of the Gov-
ernment. (See Synopsis of Contents.)

If.—FESTIVE CEREMONIES.

In the exchange of social amenities and in the round of ceremonial
gatherings which take place as just described there are many forms of
etiquette to be observed. In one sense these are not rigid, but are,
however, sufficiently uniform in their character to admit of classifica-
tion and description. .

Welcome.—These Indians welcomed the arrival of the early European
navigators and traders by paddling their canoes several times around
the ship, making long speeches, scattering bird’s down and singing.
The significance of bird’s down has been alluded to as an emblem of
friendship and peace in Chapter Ix. Two parties of Indians meeting
in canoes exchange civilities very impassively by talking or shouting
out. Poole (1867) describes the meeting of two friendly canoe parties
which had been separated by stress of weather and each believed the
others to have been lost. They danced in a circle together, the two
chiefs capering about madly while the air rang with shouts.* The cere-

mony of weleome at a village is rendered practically in the assistance
which they lend in helping to unload and haul up the canoe of the vis-
itors. Official ceremonies of welcome to guests by a chief consists in
the reception of the visitors in state in his house or lodge. To make it
impressive he sits cross-legged on the ledge or platform, surrounded by
his friends and relatives, who squat about. On the arrival of the guests
the chief delivers a long speech, interspersed with sudden outbursts
and grunts of approval by his people. After that an exchange of pres-
ents takes place and a feast or dance is given in honor of the visitors.
When a party of friendly Indians arrive at a village the chief receives
them in a dance ceremony performed by himself. Their canoes are
hauled up on the beach by the villagers, but the chief does not come
down to meet them. He stands near the fire in the back of the house
dressed as in Plate 1x, with the top of his head-dress filled with swan’s
down. As the visitors enter, the people sitting about the fire break
forth into a song, accompanied by a drum, and the chief makes his pas
seul, scattering the down, filling the air, and covering the spectators.
In the case of an Indian arriving at a strange village, he goes to the
house of one of his totem as indicated by its totemic column. The
owner comes out to welcome him, and if he likes makes a dance and a
feast in honor of his visitors. Guests arriving to take part in some gen-
eral ceremony are entertained by the relatives of the host and of his
wife.

Trade.—The ceremonies attending trading in the early days of the
intercourse of the Europeans and Indians have been described in Chap-
ter vill. They really differed little from the general ceremonies of wel-
come, but were intended to impress the visitors with a due sense of the
rank and importance of the head of the household. The time thus
spent by the Indians in dancing, singing, etc., was a source of great an-
noyance to the traders, who were generally eager to transact their busi-
ness and seek other villages while the good season lasted.

House-building.—In Chapter vi, under the head of ‘‘ Haida perma-
nent dwellings,” the process of erecting a house is described in detail.
Through the kindness of Mr. Henry Elliott we have in Plate Lxx an
excellent sketch, made at Fort Simpson, British Columbia, in October,
1866, illustrating a house-raising by a party of Haida who had secured
permission from the Tsimshian Indians to erect it near their village for
the accommodation of visiting Haida. This spirited sketch by Mr. El-
liott has remained in his portfolio for twenty-two years, and is now
published for the first time. The immense size of the beams and planks
used necessitates the co-operation of many individuals, and the ocea-
sion of their gathering from other villages is made as enjoyable as pos-
sible. The great labor and expense involved requires the whole proc-
ess to extend over a period of several years. The cutting and rough-

A BAND OF HAIDA ERECTING A HOUSE AT THE TSIMSHIAN VILLAGE OF PORT SIMPSON,
BRITISH COLUMBIA, IN OCTOBER, 1866.

From a sketch by Mr. Henry W. Elliott.

The scene is that of the co-operative building of a house, a band of howling, yell-
ing, half-naked Haida being engaged in hauling up a huge rafter on skids by means
of ropes of spruce-root or twisted cedar-bark. The canoes on the beach, and the
village in the distance, lend to it the characteristic features of a view in this region.

huge beams or rafters, and their final erection into the frame work of a
house, all require not only the expenditure of much time and labor, but
a very extensive outlay of wealth. The gathering is an occasion of
much ceremony, but the work in hand, conducted always with dire con-
fusion, shouting, and yelling, occupies but a small portion of the time,
the remainder being filled in with gambling, feasting, dancing, speech-
making, and dissipations of various kinds. Formerly the custom ob-
tained of killing several slaves when a person of consequence built a
house, the victims being selected sometime before the ceremony. The
bodies of those slain were accorded the right of burial, and in this much
were deemed very fortunate. Petroff says:

If an intended victim managed to escape or to conceal himself he was allowed to
live, and might return after the conclusion of the festivities at the house of his master
without imeurring punishment. It frequently occurred that powerful chiefs assisted
favorite slaves on such occasions to make their escape.*

After the house has been finished all these ceremonies take place
therein. The dancers paint their faces, and, attired in their best, go
through with a dance lasting an hour or so. Amongst the Haida the
dancers are the relatives of the host’s wife. At its conclusion speeches
are made (and formerly the slaves sacrificed) and the potlatch takes
place, the host presiding. After that they disperse.

Potlatches.— The potlatch, as entering into other ceremonies, has been
described in the first part of this chapter. It is the accompaniment of
every gathering designed to elevate the host in the good will of the
community and advance him in rank by increasing the respect felt for
him in his own and other villages. The potlatch in itself as a separate
ceremony is, however, practiced. Invitations to it are sent out as for
other gatherings. Usually they are given by chiefs or persons of
wealth well-established in the community. According to Dawson,

Each chief with the Tsimshians had also [in former days] his jester, who is sent on
errands of invitation, announces the guests on their arrival, and makes jokes and
endeavors to amuse the company, though preserving his own gravity. The jester is
not, of course, always in attendance. He receives nothing for his trouble, appar-
ently looking on the position as honorable, and inherits nothing on the chief’s death.

The object of the potlatch thus given as a separate ceremony is to
Strengthen the giver’s position in the community and to increase his
reputation at home and abroad.

Ceremomal dances.—Sufficient data is not at hand to classify the vari-
ous dances of the northern Indians of this region. The weight of evi-
dence seems to be that amongst the Haida the Tsimshian language is
used in the songs accompanying their dances, and that in all probability
most of the religious and winter-dance ceremonials of the Haida were
originally borrowed from their Tsimshian neighbors. ~Little is known
on this subject, and it presents a most interesting field for future
investigation, particularly in the relation of these to the winter dances
of the Kwakiutl and other southern tribes.

376 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Cultus dances.—This is a term usually applied to dances carried on
without any apparent motive other than amusement in imitation of the
actions during the greater festivities, possibly, however, as much for
practice as anything else.

Theatricals.—Portlock (1787) gives an interesting account of the cere-
monies of the Tlingit with whom he traded. After an elaborate enter-
tainment of welcome by singing and dancing in the canoes alongside
the Indians adjourned ashore, and returning again began their song.

This time, by way of varying our amusement, the chief appeared in different
characters during the time his people were singing, and always changed his dress
when he varied his character, in doing of which some of his companions held up a
a large mat, by way of a screen, to prevent us from seeing what was going on behind
the curtain. At one time he appeared in the character of a warrior, and seemed to
have all the savage ferocity of the Indian conqueror about him. He showed us the
manner in which they attacked their enemies, their method of fighting, and their be-
haviour to the vanquished enemy. He next assumed the character of a woman, and
to make his imitation more complete he wore a mask, which represented a woman’s
face with their usual ornaments; and indeed it so exactly resembled a woman’s face
that I am pretty certain it was beyond the reach of Indian art, and must certainly
have been left by the Spaniards in their last visit to this part of the coast.*

The type of mask referred to is shown in Fig. 56, Plate xvi, and in
spite of Portlock’s doubts is a veritable product of Indian art.

Dunn says of the Kwakiutl :

In the winter months these, as well as the neighbouring tribes, assemble in great
numbers in the chief’s house for the purpose of witnessing the chief imitate different
spirits, whom they are supposed to worship. He puts on at intervals different
dresses and large masks of different kinds, entirely covering his head and neck.
The masks are made to open at the mouth and eyes by means of secret springs, invisi-
ble to the spectators and different noises are sent forth. He dresses for each char-
acter behind a large curtain, drawn quite across the room, like the drop curtain in a
theatre, and then comes forth and stands on a sort of stage in front of it, while the
spectators are ranged on benches placed along the side walls. In one of the charac-
ters he imitates the rising sun, which they believe to be a shining man, wearing a
radiated crown, and continually walking round the earth, which is stationary. He
wears on this occasion a most splendid dress of ermine and other valuable furs, and
a curiously constructed mask, set round with seals’ whiskers, and feathers which
gradually expand like a fan, and from the top of the mask swan-down is shaken out
in great quantities, according as he moves his head. The expanding seals’ bristles
and feathers represent the sun’s rays, and the showers of down, rain and snow; the
Indians chanting at the same time in regular order and in a low key showing rev-
erence, devotion, and awe. * * * Sometimes the various divine personages are
represented by one man; sometimes there are two or three personators on the stage
all at once, representing different divinities.t

In Plate Lxvit are shown some of the masks belonging as personal
properties to the late Kaigani chief Skowl. In the boxes are the cere-
monial vestments worn on occasions. In Plate LXVIII are two views of
the paraphernalia belonging to Chief Shakes of Fort Wrangell (Tlingit),

tracing the descent of Chief Shakes from the bear. Amongst the
Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian these theatrical entertainments are also
given by the chiefs, but have more of a totemic than a religious sig-
nificance, as in the south. It was formerly and is now somewhat the
custom in the more out of the way villages for each chief to have a
helper or principal man, who enjoys the confidence of the chief, has
considerable authority, gives advice and instruction to the chief’s
successor, and has the care and keeping of certain secrets and prop-
erties belonging to the chief. These last duties pertain largely to
assistance rendered in the production of the theatrical representations
of the traditions and legends relating to the chief’s totem. On such
occasions, the guests being assembled, the chief presides, while the prin-
cipal man directs the entertainment. Tig. 354 represents a scene taken
from a representation witnessed by the writer at Chief Shakes’s, Fort
Wrangell, Alaska. The figure of the bear is a mannikin of a grizzly
with a man inside of it. The skin was obtained up the Stikine River,
in the mountains of the interior, and has been an heirloom in Shakes’s
family for several generations. The eyes, lips, ear lining, and paws are
of copper, and the jaws are capable of being worked. A curtain screen
in one corner being dropped, the singing of a chorus suddenly ceased,
and the principal man, dressed as shown, with baton in his hand, nar-
rated in a set speech the story of how an ancestor of Shakes’s rescued
the bear from drowning in the great flood of years ago, and how ever
since there had been an alliance between Shakes’s descendants and the
bear. This narration, lasting some ten minutes, was interrupted by
frequent nods of approval by the bear when appealed to, and by the
murmurs and applause of the audience.

In these various representations all sorts of tricks are practised
to impose on the credulous and to lend solemnity and reality to the
narration of the totemic legends. The masks shown in Plate Lxvw are
those worn by the different characters in the entertainments offered by
Chief Skowl.

GENERAL CHARACTER OF TRADITIONS, MYTHS, AND FOLKLORE—
BIBLIOGRAPHY.

The .traditions and myths of the northern group of the northwest
coast (Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian) are very similar, but with pecul-
jar local variations. No attempt can be made here other than to out-
line the principal tradition of the creation and of the origin of man,
and that only to illustrate the general character of their beliefs and
ideas. In their legends and traditions we have the unconscious ex-
pression of their religious, moral, and esthetic ideas, their views of life
and death, their cosmogony and astrology, their fanciful biographies
and history, and their explanations of all the phenomena of nature.
Related around the log fire in the family circle, with loud and confident
voice, with labored and dramatic imitations and gestures, and listened
to with wrapt attention by the inmates of the lodge, they represent the
history of human thought—the blind gropings of the mind to know—
in this narrow pocket of the world, and as such are as worthy of care-
ful compilation and study as if they were facts of veritable history.

The creator of all things and the benefactor of man was the great
raven called by the Tlingit Yetl, Yeshl, or Yeatl, and by the Haida Ne-
kil-stlas. He was not exactly an ordinary bird, but, like all old Indian
mythical characters, had many human attributes, and the power of
transforming himself into anything in the world. His coat of feathers
could be put on or taken off at will like a garment, and he could as-
sume any character whatever. He existed before his birth, never
grows old, will never die. Numerous are the stories of his adventures
in peopling the world and giving to man the earth, fire, fresh water, life,
fish, game, ete. According to the Haida and Kaigani the first people
sprung from a cockle-shell (Cardium corbis, Mart). Ne-kil-stlas became
very lonely and began to look about him for a mate, but could find
none. At last he took a cockle-shell from the beach, and marrying it,
he still continued to brood and think earnestly of his wish for a com-
panion. By and by he heard a faint ery in the shell, which gradually
became louder till at last a little female child was seen, which by de-
erees grew to be a woman and married the raven. From this union
came all the Indians of this region, who at first lived in darkness and
want. As they multiplied Yetl or Ne-kil-stlas endowed them with the
various gifts of light, fresh water, fire, etc. All these were in the pos-

session of the chief evil spirit, a great chief, the uncle of Yetl, who
lived on the mainiand where the Nass river now is. He was master of
the tides and had great power, and the stories of how Yeél circumvented
him are numerous and interesting. The Haida name for this unele is
Setlm-ki-jash, the Tlingit designation being Mees-du-je-al-ity Kah or
Keesshusaah Ankow. We had a wife and sister, or according to some
versions a wife and daughter. Of his wife he was very jealous, and
whenever for any reason he was away from home, hunting, fishing, or
working, he imprisoned her in a box or basket, and tied her up to the
rafters in the lodge, setting a number of little red birds te watch her.
If by any chance the box were opened the birds would fly to him and
warn him. He was also very jealous of the posterity of his sister (or
daughter), whose children he killed for fear that when they grew up
they would prove rivals to him in his wife’s affections.* According to
the Haida tradition, he threw her progeny into the fire; according to
the Tlingit, he drowned them. This sister (or daughter) was not al-
lowed to eat or drink anything until the chief had examined it, as she
had become pregnant from eating certain things many times before.
As every part of the house was so jealously guarded, Yetl or Ne kil-
stlas did not know how to get in to steal the various things he
wanted for the good of man, but finally he hit upon the plan of
being born into the family. One day he saw the sister (or
daughter) go to the brook to get a drink, so transforming himself
into a drop of water (or spear of cedar or blade of grass), he eluded
the vigilance of the chief and was swallowed by the girl, and
in due time Yetl was born to her as ason.t She concealed the fact of
his birth from the chief for some little time. In ten days’ time he grew
to almost man’s size. His mother taught him many things, amongst
others the use of the bow and arrow, and he became an expert shot.
With his arrow he killed the magical crane whose skin enabled the
wearer to fly, and the diver with whose skin he could float. One day
the chief discovered Yet! and pretended to be pleased with him, but he
took him out in a canoe and threw him overboard. Yeél, having on
‘his diver’s skin, walked along the bottom and met his uncle on shore.
Next the chief threw him into the fire and piled logs on him, but hav-
ing ona magic cloak he came out of the fireunharmed. One day when
the chief was away, he opened the box in which his wife was confined
and released her, but the little birds flew to him and informed him.
The chief returned in a great rage, but Yetl sat calmly without noticing
him. This was too much for the master of the tides, so he commanded
the floods to rise and destroy this impudent meddler, but Yeti, giving

*This is on a parallel with the habits and morals of these Indians. We have here,
as in all traditions, an expression of the moral ideas of the people.

t It is interesting to note in this connection the widespread belief both among say-
age and civilized peoples in the possibility of pregnancy through indiscretion in
eating.

his mother the skin of the diver to enable her to swim, himself put on
the skin of the crane. The salt water rose until it began to come in the
door, when the chief put on his tall dance hat which made him amphib-
ious, and Yetl flew out through the smoke-hole. As he flew, he began
to tire, and was compelled to come back from time to time to rest on the
chief’s dance hat, which was the only thing visible, till finally he gained
strength enough to fly to the sky, which he pierced with his beak and
hung to until the tide reached to his wings, when it began to subside.
Finally he let go of his hold and, flying for some days, he lit on a bunch
of kelp to rest. At this point the story varies so much in different
localities that it is difficult to make it at all general. According to the
Kaigani Yetl descended into the sea and rescued his mother from the
lord of the tides ; according to the Tlingit a sea-otter carried him ashore
from the kelp; according tothe Stikine Indians he lit originally on the
Queen Charlotte Islands, and picking up pieces of the wood of the
Douglas pine in his bill he flew all over the other islands, and where-
ever he let fall a piece of this wood, the Douglas pine is now found.
Fresh water he stole from the lord of the tides by strategy ; also the
new moon. In the carved column shown in Fig. 179, Plate xxxv, one
of the figures represents Yetl with the new moon in his bill and the dish
of fresh water in his claws, in illustration of this part of the legend.
He also stole the sun and the stars from the boxes in which they were
imprisoned by the Jord of the tides.* When the sun shone forth for
the first time all the people were frightened and ran in all directions ;
some of them into the mountains, some into the woods, and some into
the water, and all of these were transformed into animals according to
their hiding place. Fire he obtained from an island in thesea. He
reached there by the help of his magic bird skin, and seizing a burning
brand in his beak he started back, but the journey was so long that
nearly all the wood burned up, and even the point of his bill was
scorched black and he had to let it drop. The sparks flew over the
ground in all directions. From this time both the wood and stone con-
tain fire, which can be obtained from the one by striking it and from
the other by rubbing. Endless are the details of the adventures of
Yetl, not to mention the other traditions and myths which no one In-
dian can ever learn. Many of them are remembered simply as bearing
on or relating to the totem of the individual. In general their belief
is in indwelling spirits. The sea, the woods, and the air are peopled
with them. Ail the phenomena of the universe are attributed to their
action and most of the rites of these Indians of a religious natureare in
the direction of propitiating them. It is not the purpose here to treat
of the traditions, myths, and beliefs of the Indians. The subject is
worthy of special study and will undoubtedly receive the attention it
merits.

* This idea of ditterent valuables being stored in boxes naturally arises from their
own time-honored custom of storing things in this way.

GENERAL NOTES.

RELATIONS AND AFFINITIES OF THE TLINGIT, HAIDA, TSIMSHIAN,
AND KWAKIUTL—THKHK HAIDA. REMARKS ON THE MAORI OF NEW
ZEALAND—THE* KAIGANI. ETHNOLOGICAL WORK TO BE DONE.

A thorough study of the ethnical affinities and mutual influences of
the various Indian stocks of the northwest coast is out of the question
with the data at hand, vet many attempts have been made to isolate
the Haida and to give them an origin different from the others. It is
held by some that this stock is an offshoot of the Asiatic Mongoioid
group, particularly of the Japanese branch, and by others that they |
are of Aztec origin. The supporter of this latter theory is Mr. J. G.
Swan, of Port Townsend, Washington Territory. A comparative study
of the languages, customs, habits, and traditions of the different In-
dian stocks of this region even with the meagre data at hand, would,
however, seem to locate the Haida as of near kin to the Tsimshian and
Tlingit. Difference in environment would seem to account sufficiently
for the physical and linguistic differences. Along with much originality,
the inhabitants of the Queen Charlotte Islands have shown so much
genius and receptiveness in adapting and adopting the customs of others,
that they present some very puzzling affinities with distant stocks, giving
color to these various theories as to their origin. In their legends «the
Haida are at one with the Tlingit, and the totemic organization of the
two stocks do not differ very materially, although this needs further
study. Their languages are, according to Dr. Franz Boas, very much >
alike in structure, while their vocabularies show great differences. In
their arts the Haida have borrowed so largely from so many sources,
that they are considerably in advance of the Tlingit. All things con-
sidered, the Tlingit and Haida show evidences of near relationship and
of intercourse at a remote period. A consideration of the mutual influ-
ences of the Tsimshian stock and the northern Kwakiutl tribes of the
Haeltzukan stock will throw much light on the origin of certain cus-
toms amongst the Haida, for the last named have been considerably
influenced by the Tsimshian. Indeed, the Tsimshian seem to have been
the middle men or center of distribution in this region.

The Tlingit present the simplest problem. Confined to the northern
end of this region and only slightly influenced by adjacent tribes, their

382
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 383

totemic organization into phratries, totems, and subtotems, their
legends and their matriarchal organization, all bear a distinct and orig-
inal stamp. The Tsimshian, on the other hand, have been greatly influ-
enced by the northern Kwakiutl tribes, who have been, by the reciprocal
influence of the former, in turn drawn away from the southern tribes
of their own stock. In the legends of the Tsimshian we find much that
is peculiar to themselves, much in common with those of the Tlingit and
Haida, and a good deal borrowed from the northern Kwakiutl. On the
other hand, their totemic organization is according to Boas a modifica-
tion of that of the Kwakiutl, and radically different from that of the
Haida and Tlingit.* The totems of the Tsimshian are the wolf, raven,
eagle, and the bear, with no phratries ; those of the Kwakiutl the raven,
eagle, and the bear, with no phratries. It may possibly be that the Haida
have been the centre of impulse on the northwest coast and that in
_ their development they may have influenced the adjacent tribes to a
great degree, but the weight of evidence is that, with no great origi-
nality in themselves, they yet present the curious and puzzling circum.
stance that they extensively borrowed their ideas from the other stocks
but developed what they have borrowed with a marvelous skill and
independence. They seem in themselves to have typified or intensified
the representative characteristics of the Indian stocks of the northwest
coast. Whether they have originated or borrowed their ideas can not
be made apparent with the data at hand, but it may be well to here
state briefly the peculiarities of the Haida as they have struck the writer
in their relation to the other Indians of the region.

Tattooing, found hardly at all amongst the other tribes and then
without much importance attached to it, is with them a fine art, and
has both a bearing on their totemic system and the deepest signifi-
cance in their ceremonies. The Tlingit and Tsimshian only occasion-
ally etch the totemic figures on their painted bodies on ceremonial occa-
sions, while their neighbors of whom we are speaking take every possi-
ble occasion to display their family crests. The carved totemic columns,
stunted and dwarfed in the south amongst the Kwakiutl and also in
the north amongst the Tlingit, here become the most elaborate and
striking characteristic of the Indian village, so much so that a Haida
Settlement looks at a distance like a forest of stripped, bare tree
trunks.t The mortuary and commemorative columns are also more
elaborate here than elsewhere, and the memory of the.dead is celebrated
in feast, legend, and carving with the greatest pomp and ostentation.
The Chilkat blankets pictured in Plates rx and x, and the copper
shields from the Chilkat region are nowhere so numerous and elaborate
as in the Queen Charlotte Islands. The art of basket-making, first

developed amongst the northern Tlingit, has been taken up by the
Haida with marked success. ‘This is true also of metal-working. The
conical-shaped basket-work hats so common about Dixon Entrance are
particularly abundant in this group. The primitive copper and shell
ornaments were nowhere in such demand as amongst the Haida.
Labrets of the largest size are worn by the Haida women, who are the
last on the coast to cling to this custom. The origin of the tobacco
plant in this region is credited to the Queen Charlotte Islands, where
the first potatoes were also raised. While the Haida are the most ex-
pert canoe. builders on the coast, they have sensibly adopted the Sa-
lishan or Wakashan type for certain purposes where strength has been
the prime consideration. Cedar-bark mat-making developed amongst
the Kwakiutl and practised by the Tsimshian is here also successfully
imitated. Nowhere is the art of carving and painting amongst savage
tribes so highly developed. Their houses are exceptionally well con-
structed, and the custom of erecting the carved column in contact with
the front of the house and cutting a circular door-way through both,
seems to be nowhere so universally practised. It is in their elaborate
ceremonials that the most puzzling instances of foreign influence occurs.
The cedar-bark rope head-dresses, sashes, and girdles amongst the
Kwakiutl play the most important part in their winter ceremonial
dances, and are only worn by certain people on special occasions and
with special significance. Amongst the Haida the cedar-bark para-
phernalia is just as elaborate and worn without any special significance.
The whistles, trumpets, and other so-called musical instruments have
more of a Tsimshian than a Haida origin, butare found in equalabundance
and variety amongst both. The wearing of masks peculiarly enough
has no especially deep significance amongst the Haida other than re-
ferring to and illustrating their totemic legends, yet nowhere in the
world are such elaborate ones made and worn. Wooden masks are
worn by the Eskimo of southern Alaska on ceremonial occasions, but it
would seem that the custom of wearing masks in ceremonies amongst
the Haida and Tlingit really originated in the wearing of them for pro-
tection in war, and that this custom was in no way borrowed or derived
from the Eskimo.

The number of masks in the collections of the U. S. National Museum
is out of all proportion to their importance or their use by the Indians.
There are only one or two ceremonial dances in which they are worn,
which is quite contrary to the accepted opinion. In most of the songs
accompanying the Haida dances the Tsimshian language is used and
many customs of the Tsimshian are avowedly tollowed. In this way,
through the latter, probably some of the practices of the Kwakiutl
reached the Haida. From all this it would appear that the latter have
been influenced in a not remote period largely by others through the
Tsimshian, but that the original affinities and relationship of the Haida
were with the Tlingit.
THE INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 385

Many resemblances of the Haida to widely remote stocks have been
pointed out by writers, but to illustrate how futile such clues are in
tracing the origin and relationship of the tribes of the world, a paral-
lel is here briefly drawn between the Maori of New Zealand and the
Haida. In point of physical resemblance both are of the Mongoiloid
type and both live on groups of islands whose climates are remarkably
similar. Poole says of the climate of the Queen Charlotte Islands that
the most graphic comparison he could draw was with that of the north-
ern island of New Zealand.* Their political organization of the tribe,
their ownership of land, and their laws of blood-revenge are similar.
The men tattoo with designs intended to identify them with their sub-tribe
or household, and they ornament their canoes, paddles, house fronts,
etc., in somewhat the same manner as on the northwest coast. In
Chapter Iv, p. 267, under the head of “ Rain Cloaks,” Dixon (1787) is
quoted as saying that the cloaks of the Haida and Tlingit were the same
as those worn by the New Zealanders. In Chapter VI, p. 303, is also
quoted from Dixon a statement that a Haida fortified house on an is!l-
and of the Queen Charlotte group was * built exactly on the plan of
the hippah of the savages of New Zealand;” and in Chapter Vv, p. 279,
that the adzes of the Tlingit and Haida, made of jasper, were ‘the
same as those used by the New Zealanders.” The cloaks of shredded
inner bark in the National Museum from New Zealand and the Queen
Charlotte Islands are so much alike, that it takes a close inspection to
distinguish them. In Plate xxx, Fig. 167, a New Zealand paddle is
reproduced, with a few from the northwest coast. The resemblance
is marked and interesting. In Plate Ly, Fig. 295, a Maori tiki is illus-
trated along with several Haida carved wooden columns. The carved
wooden mortuary columns erected in front of the Maori houses are also
suggestive, but it is safe to say that while all this is not in one sense
accidental, yet the resemblances and similarities are as likely to have
arisen from the like tendencies of the human mind under the same ex-
ternal conditions, or environment to develop along parallel lines as
through contact of these tribes or through a common origin.

The Kaigani.—The Kaigani are a branch of the Haida of Queen Char-
lotte Islands, having for some cause or other split off from their breth-
ren and settled across Dixon Entrance on the southern end of Prince
of Wales Island and adjacent archipelago. As near as can be figured
from the Indian accounts, this must have happened at the least one-
hundred and fifty years ago. Their three principal villages now are
Ifowkan, Kliuquan and Kasa-an. Howkan is a thriving village, with
a winter population of about three hundred. Under the ministration
of the Rey. J. L. Gould, of the Presbyterian Board of Missions, it is
fast losing its native characteristics. A saw-mill is run in connection
with the mission, and the Indians are gradually building an American
village in rear of the old time lodges. Many of the totemic columns
have been cut down, and the native characteristics are fast disap-

pearing. It is to be said in favor of the new order of things that Mr.
Gould has fortunately impressed upon this village the stamp of his
own personal qualities, thriftiness, industriousness, fair dealing, sobri-
ety, and enterprise, Just below Howkan is the village of Koianglas,
consisting of three houses and several interesting totemic columns.
The population, made up of a few families, will soon be absorbed
in that of Howkan. Nearly opposite Koianglas, on Dall Island, and
also situated on Kaigani strait is the site of the old time village of
Dat-ghaya. On the southern end of Dali Island, just north of Cape
Muzon (the extreme southern point of Alaska) is the small village of
Kaigani. The winter residence of the former population is now at
Howkan. There are seven or eight houses, which are occupied only at
certain seasons of the year, but there are no totemic columns. Klieu-
quan or Kliuquan is said to be about half as large as Howkan, but to
have retained its native characteristics almost intact. At the south-
ern entrance to Cholmondeley sound is the site of the abandoned vil-
lage of Chasina or Chachina. There is only one house there now and
the stumps and remains of mortuary columns. Early voyagers de-
scribe it as a populous village in the early part of this century. At the
head of Kasa-an Bay, at what is called Karbo Bay, is a small village,
called by some authorities Kasa-an. Kasa-an proper is, however, on
Skowl Arm, a branch of the bay. Being somewhat off the steamer
route, and the missionaries never having settled there, Kasa-an has
preserved its native characteristics more markedly than any other vil-
lage in Alaska. Just above Kasa-an Bay, at Toistoi Bay, is the north-
ern limit of the Kaigani territory on Prince of Wales Island, as the
adjoining arm, Thorne Bay, is in dispute between the Stikines and
Kaigani. Tlevak straits, on the other side of the island, is the northern
limit on the west shore. The hunting and fishing grounds, as claimed
by the different tribes in Alaska, are as accurately plotted in Chart II
as the data at hand will admit. From Admiralty Island south the
writer has relied on his personal knowledge, based on inquiry in that
region. The duty of the government in recognizing the Indian titles
to these lands held by them for generations in the different families seems
very clear, and an inquiry into the subject would not be amiss in con-
nection with ail governmental investigations and reports on this region.

As outiined in the synopsis of this paper, there are several chapters
which ought to be added, to complete the study of the ethnology of
this region. The character of the work yet to be done is such as to
call for action by the government in undertaking it on a large scale.
Linguistically, considerable has been accomplished. But with regard
to the traditions, religious beliefs and practices, folklore myths, totemic
subdivisions, shamanistic practices, fetishism, particularly all the local
or tribal variations of each, there is a vast deal to be done.

If what is here submitted will accomplish no more than to eall atten-
tion to the little known concerning the Indians about Dixon Entrance,
the author’s effort will not have been in vain.

A CATALOGUE OF THE HIPPISLEY COLLECTION OF CHINESE PORCELAINS:
WITH A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF CERAMIC ART IN CHINA,

By ALFRED E. HIPpPIsLeEy.

NoTE.—In 1887 Mr. A. E. Hippisley, of the Imperial Maritime Customs Service of
China, deposited in the National Museum a large and important collection of Chinese
porcelains, with the understanding that they should be allowed to remain on exhi-
bition for at least two years, and that the Museum should print a descriptive cat-
alogue. The catalogue, carefully prepared by Mr. Hippisley, is now published, with
the hope that it will enable visitors to the Museum to study the collection with more
intelligent appreciation during the time it shall remain in the Museum.

———————

For such information as we possess regarding the history of the Cer-
amic Art in China, we have till recentiy been chiefly indebted to the
labors of the famous French sinologue M. Stanislas Julien, who, under
the title of “L’histoire et la fabrication de ]a Porcelaine Chinoise,”
translated, and published in 1856, the History of the Manufactory of
Chingté-chén (a small town in Kiangsi province, but for centuries the
most important seat of the Chinese porcelain industry,) a work written
by a local magistrate in 1815 from oJder documents, and to the valua-
ble letters from the same town written in 1712 and 1722 by the Jesuit
' missionary Pére d’Entrecolles, the priest in charge there, which have
been published in the collection of ‘‘Lettres édifiantes et curieuses.”
Within the past three years, however, very valuable additional light
has been shed upon this subject by the labors of two gentlemen who are
at once collectors and Chinese scholars, 8. W. Bushell, M. D., physi-
cian to H. B. M. Legation, Pekin, and IF’. Hirth, PH. D., a member of
the Imperial Maritime Customs Service of China. Dr. Bushell has
been fortunate enough to:secure from among the dispersed library of
the Prince of I, the MS. of a descriptive catalogue (of which native ex-
perts see no reason to doubt the authenticity), with illustrations painted
_ in water color, of eighty-two celebrated specimens of old porcelain seen
in the collections of noted connoisseurs or possessed by the author him-
self, one Hsiang Yiian-p‘ien (styled Tzti-ching) a native of Tsui-li, an
ancient name of Chia-ho, now Chiahsing-fu, in Chehkiang province, who
was a celebrated collector of all kinds of antiquities during the latter
half of the sixteenth century. A translation of this work, with explan-

atory details by Dr. Bushell, bas been published in the Journal of the
Pekin Oriental Society, under the title of ‘‘ Chinese Porcelain before the
present Dynasty,” and it is, I believe, to be shortly republished in an
amplified form with reproductions of the original drawings. Should this
be done, the work would, in my opinion, form by far the most important
and valuable contribution to our knowledge of this interesting subject.
The information regarding Chinese porcelain which has been bequeathed
to us by native authors is to be found in their encyclopedias or in spe-
cial treatises chiefly based upon the encyclopedias. These are, however,
compilations of such vast extent that the authors had not, nor could be
expected to have, the intimate knowledge of an expert upon all of the
very many subjects treated in them. Hearsay evidence or unverified
rumors have thus but too often been allowed to erystalize into perma-
nent record, with the result that it is impossible after an interval of
centuries to attempt to reconcile the many contradictions of statement
contained in the different works. In this catalogue, however, are con-
tained the reproductions in color of eighty-two specimens of the choicest
productions of a period extending over upwards of five centuries, from
A. D. 960 to 1521, either possessed or seen by the artist, and scattered
notes from the pen of one of the most noted connoisseurs of his age re-
garding the respective merits and rarity of the various kinds of ware.
Existing realities are presented to us in place of the vague generalties
and contradictory essays of the eneyclopedists, and there can, I appre-
hend, be little doubt as to the comparative value of the two varieties of
evidence. Dr. Hirth’s contribution—‘ Chinese Porcelain: a study in
Chinese Medieval Industry and Trade ”—is an important paper, treating
chiefly of Chinese céladon porcelain and its distribution over the Mo-
hammedan world.

EARLIEST MENTION OF PORCELAIN.

According to the legendary records of the prehistoric perid of Chinese
chronology, porcelain was already manufactured under Huang-ti, an
emperor who is stated to have entered upon a reign of one hundred
years in B. C. 2697; and the Emperor Yu-ti-Shun, another monarch of
the legendary period, is believed to have himself made porcelain before
mounting the throne in B. C. 2255. Under the succeeding dynasty of
Chou, mention is made of an official director of pottery, and the pro-
cesses of fashioning on the wheel and of molding are distinguished ;
sacrificial wine jars and altar dishes, coffins, and cooking utensils and
measures being mentioned among the articles produced. Later, Chinese
writers have, however, long admitted that the productions of that age
could only have been of earthenware (possibly glazed), and that no
greater antiquity can be claimed for the manufacture of real porcelain
than the reign of the Han dynasty, which held the throne of China from
B. C. 202 to A. D. 220, and that after this date progress in the system
of manufacture was for a long period but slow. At one time, early in
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. 389

the present century, Kuropean archeologists were inclined to beiieve
that an antiquity might be conceded to Chinese porcelain almost equal
to the wildest claims of Chinese historians.* Some small porcelain bot-
tles, decorated with flowers and inscriptions in Chinese, having been
brought to Europe by M. Rosellini, who stated that they had been found
in undisturbed Egyptian tombs dating from at least 1800 B. C., it was
concluded that the manufacture of porcelain must have existed in China
anterior to that date. M. Julien discovered, however, that the inscrip-
tions upon these bottles were written in the grass or cursive character,
a style of writing not introduced till B. C. 48; and later Mr. (afterwards
Sir Walter) Medhurst, then an interpreter in the Hongkong government
service, was able with Chinese aid to identify the inscriptions with
quotations from poems written during the T‘ang dynasty, and later than
the seventh century of the Christian era. Any title based upon these
bottles, which had evidently been surreptitiously introduced into the
tombs by fraudulent Arabs, for so great an antiquity in the manufacture
of Chinese porcelain, thus fell to the ground. Indeed, M. du Sartel,
who has published an exhaustive work on *“‘ La Porcelaine de la Chine”
argues that the manufacture of true porcelain in China did not com-
mence till some centuries later than the period assigned to it by M.
Julien, who dates it from the reign of the Han dynasty and somewhere
between the years B. C.185 and A. D. 87. This point will be considered
when we come to the reign of the T‘ang dynasty, the period in which M.
du Sartel claims true porcelain was first made.

HAN DYNASTY, B. C. 202 To A. D. 220.

It is during the Han dynasty that mention is first made of Tz‘w, the
Chinese designation of porcelain. It was then made at Hsinp‘ing, a
district in the state of Ch‘en, and corresponding with the modern Huain-
ing district, in Honan province.

WEI DYNASTY, 221 To 265.

Under the Wei dynasty, which from A. D.221 to 265 enjoyed, with the
dynasties of Wu and of Han of Szechuen, divided supremacy as rulers
of China, manufactories are mentioned at several places in the depart-
ment of Hsi-an, in Shensi province (the products of which were known
as Kuanchung-yao), and at Loyang, in Honan province (products termed
Loching-t‘ao), as supplying porcelain for the imperial palace.

CHIN DYNASTY, 266 To 419.

Under the Chin dynasty (A. D. 266 to 419) another manufactory is
mentioned as existing in the present department of Wénchon, in Cheh-
kiang province, which produced porcelain (known as Tung-ou t‘ao) of a
blue (or possibly céladon) color which was held in high esteem.

390 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888,

SUI DYNASTY, 581 To 617.

Under the Sui dynasty, in spite of its short-lived existence, consider-
able progress appears to have taken place. Mention is made of a
green porcelain manufactured under the directions of Ho Chou or Ho
Kuei-lin, president of the board of works, to replace glass, the method
of making which had been forgotten “since its introduction into China
by Indian or Syrian artisans about A. D. 424.”"* A celebrated workman
named Tao Yiit is said to have produced porcelain so like jade, that is,
semi-transparent and of vitreous appearance, that his vases were known
as “artificial jade;” and about the close of this or the beginning of the
following dynasty, porcelain, white in color and bright as jade (known
as Ho-yas, 7. e., Ho porcelain) was manufactured by Ho Chung-ch‘u, a
workman who came from Hsinp’ing, the district where porcelain (tz‘w)
had its first origin ander the Han dynasty. An imperial decree of 583
ordered the establishment of a manufactory at the place now known
as Chingté-chén (so named from the title of the period,j Chingté, in
which it was inaugurated) for articles for the use of the imperial house-
hold, and several others sprang up in the vicinity shortly afterwards.

* Dr Hirth: China and the Roman Orient, pp. 230 et seq.

+ The producer’s reputed name, meaning as it does ‘‘faience or klin jade” sounds
apocryphal, and seems more likely to have been the term by which this ware was
known.

{ It being contrary to etiquette to mention the personal name of a Chinese sovereig 1,
the practice was introduced B. C. 163, under the earlier Han dynasty, of the mon-
arch, on his accession to the throne, selecting some title for his reign in place of the
title of Prince so-and-so, which had been usually employed prior to the time of Shih
Huangti, B. C. 221. These titles were usually so chosen as to be of happy augury,
but if, in spite of such good omen, disorder or misfortune ensued or some other reason
seemed to render a change advisable, one title would be abandoned in favor of
another. This title is termed nien-has, ‘‘the year designation,” because so long as
it lasted the date of all events was chronicled as such and such a year of such and
such a title or nien-has. Upon his death, however, the emperor received an honor-
ific title, and but one title, no matter how many nien-has or ‘‘ year designations”
he may have employed while alive, under which the religious ceremonies due to him
were offered, and which is therefore termed the mias-has or ‘‘temple designation.”
Thus it results that when in Chinese literature a deceased emperor is personally
alluded to, he is spoken of under his ‘‘ temple designation,” while if the date of an
event which occurred during his reign is quoted, it is said to have taken place in such
and such a year of the appropriate ‘‘ year designation.” Take as an instance the
last emperor of the Yiian dynasty, who reigned from 1333 to 1367: if spoken of per-
sonally, his title would be Shunti of the Yiian dynasty; but if the year 1334 were
spoken of, it would read ‘‘the second year of (the) Yiian t‘ung (period),” and simi-
larly 1336 and 1334 would read ‘‘ the second year of (the) Chihyiian (period) ” and
‘the second year of (the) Chihchéng (period).” Owing to the fact that dates are
thus rendered by the Chinese, foreign writers have at times erroneously spoken of
the nien-has or ‘‘ period” as the reign, whereas the mias-has or ‘‘ temple designation ”
alone corresponds to the western idea of reign, so far as any time prior to the Ming
dynasty is concerned. During the Ming and its successor, the present dynasty, how-
ever, each emperor has practically used but one ‘‘ year designation ” throughout the
period he has occupied the throne, practically because though Ying Tsung of the
Ming dynasty employed two such designations, they were separated by an interreg-
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. 391

T‘ANG DYNASTY, 618 To 906

Under the succeeding, the T‘ang dynasty, which ruled from 618 to
906, the manufacture appears to have spread over the greater part of
the empire, and to have reached in some places a degree of excellence
far in advance of that previously attained. The following varieties,are
specifically enumerated (in the reverse order of their merit):

The Hungchou-yao, a yellow black porcelain from Hungchow, the pres-
ent department of Nan-ch‘ang, in Kiangsi province.

The Shou-yao, a yellow porcelain, from Shouchou in (present) Kiangsu
province.

The Yo-yao, a blue porcelain according to Julien, but the color was
more probably a pale green, for the Ch‘a ching, a “Treatise on
Tea” written in the eighth century, says cups of this ware gave
to the infusion a green tint—from the department of Yochou, in
(present) Hunan province.

The Wu-yao and Ting-yao, of colors unspecified, from the department of
Wuchou, corresponding with the present department of Chinhua in
Chehkiang province; and from the department of Tingchow, corre-
sponding with the present district of Chingyang in the Hsi-an
department, Shensira province, respectively.

num of seven years’ duration; and though T‘ai-Tsung-Wén of the present dynasty
also employed two, he seldom or never comes to the notice of foreign writers. The
term ‘‘ period” being in any case an inconvenient one, and the ‘ year designation ”
under the Ming and the present dynasty being synchronous with the reign, it seems
hypercritical to insist on uniformly translating nien-has by “period” in the case of
emperors of those dynasties, especially as consistency would require that names so
well known to every school-boy, as Kanghsi, Yungchéng, and Chienlung be replaced
by the proper titles, Shéng-Tsu-Jén Huangti, Shih-Tsung-Hsien Huangti, and Kas-
Tsung-Shun Huangti. In the following pages, therefore, the nien-has or ‘‘ year
designation” has been rendered ‘‘ period ” prior to the accession of the Ming dynasty
in 1336, and subsequently to that date as ‘‘ period” or ‘‘ reign,” according to circum-
stances.

The dates upon porcelain are also usually recorded by the use of the nien-has -
as above described, though other marks are mentioned by Chinese writers, and if the
article has been manufactured for the special use of some emperor or prince, it will
possibly bear the name of the pavilion or portion of the palace for which it is spe-
cially intended. Chinese writers state that the practice of marking the date of man-
ufacture was instituted by the Emperor Chén Tsung of the Lung dynasty, when, on
the establishment of the government factory at Chingté-chén, he ordered that each
article manufactured should be marked with the nien-has then used ‘‘Chingté, 1004
to 1007.” Foreign writers on the marks upon porcelain specify other marks of the
same dynasty, but upon what authority is not clearly specified. So far as my own
knowledge goes, I am unaware of any such date-marks being inscribed under the
glaze prior to the Ming dynasty. Since that time, putting aside monochromes,
which, in probably the majority of instances, bear no mark, they have been em-
ployed uninterruptedly, except during a portion of K’anghsi’s reign. In 1677 the
magistrate in charge at Chingté-chén forbade the practice alike of inscribing the
date and of portraying the actions of celebrated personages, on the ground that if
the article were broken, disrespect might be shown to them or to the emperor. Dur-
ing this period, which was of but short duration, however, a leaf, a cepser, and other
marks replaced the nien-has. ;
392 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The Yiieh-yao, a blue, or for the same reason as in the case of Yo-yao a
pale green porcelain, much sought after from the earliest times,
from Yiiehchou, corresponding with the present department of
Chaohsing in Chehkiang province; and lastly

The Shu-yao or Szechumen porcelain, facile princeps among the pro-
ductions of that age, snow-white in color, with a clear ring, thin
but strong, and graceful in shape, from the city of Ta-i, in the de-
partment of K‘iuingchou, in (present) Szechuen province.

THE ANTIQUITY OF TRUE PORCELAIN.

As already stated, M. du Sartel declines to admit the antiquity attrib-
uted by M. Julien, on the authority of the native work he translated,
to the production of true porcelain in China, namely, the time of the
Han dynasty, and somewhere between the years B. C. 185 and A. D. 87.
His arguments, however, are marked by strange inaccuracies. Having
referred the productions of Hangchou, Shouchou, Yochou, and Yiieh-
chou, which, as above, Chinese authors state to have been first manu-
factured under the T‘ang dynasty, back to the Ch‘in dynasty, that is,
to a period nearly two centuries earlier, M. dn Sartel argues that the
remarks made in the Treatise on Tea above referred to (which, when
enumerating the varieties of T‘ang porcelain, classifies them merely.
according to the suitability of their colored glazes to impart an agree-
able tint to tea held in them) tend to show that the bowls or cups in
question could not have been transparent porcelain, bearing a decora-
tion in the colors named under the glaze, but must have been of an
opaque substance, covered internally with a thick colored glaze. In
this view he considers himself supported by the description given of the >
Sui dynasty manufactures. This, he argues, gives an idea of trans-
parence, but the transparence is due merely to the use of a more vit-
reous composition or to a more thorough baking than had been pre-
viously customary, and the white color and other distinctive qualities
of true porcelain are only to be first found in the productions of the
Tang dynasty—that is, in those productions which M. du Sartel, in
disregard of the statements of Chinese writers, the only authorities we
have to guide us, himself elects to refer to this dynasty. Secondly, he
argues that the porcelain manufactured under the Sui and preceding
dynasties is uniformly denominated ¢‘ao, that from the latter half
of the T‘ang dynasty, this word is replaced by the designation yao
which has continued in use up to the present time; and that the change
in name coincides with a change in the character of the porcelain man-
ufactured.

The word yao as a designation of porcelain came into general use,
it is true, at the commencement of the T‘ang dynasty, but that fact
would scarcely justify the conclusion that it was designedly intro-
duced in order to mark a synchronous change in the character of the
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. 393

ware, since the same word, which is in any case but a neutral term
applicable to any kind of pottery, is met with four centuries earlier
to designate some of the products of the Wei dynasty; and, besides,
in the titles of the chapters in the Provincial Topographies dealing with
these manufactures, also in the Treatise on Pottery (the T‘ao shuo,
written by Chu T‘ung-ch‘uan during the reign of Chien-lung, 1736 to
1795, the autbority on this subject), and in the work translated by M.
Julien, it is the word t‘ao, not yao, that is used to designate porcelain.
Chinese terminology is but an insecure foundation on which to base
arguments, and it might with no less fairness be contended, as the Chi-
nese author, translated by M. Julien does contend, that the introduc-
tion of the character tz‘i, signifying “porcelain,” and employed down
to the present day to designate the pottery of the Han dynasty, was
rendered necessary by the production of an article hitherto unknown,
and that this article was true porcelain.

On different grounds from those advanced by M. du Sartel, Dr. Hirth,
also, refers the earliest manufacture of true porcelain to the T‘ang in-
stead of to the Han dynasty. He says: ‘The Chéng-lei-pén-ts‘ao, the
pharmacopeceia of the Sung dynasty, compiled in 1108, under the head
of ‘Porcelain Earth’ (Kaolin) or Pai-ngo, quotes from the writings of
T‘ao Yinchii that ‘this substance is now much used for painting pic-
tures,’ and from the T‘ang pén-ts‘ao, the pharmacopeeia of the Téang
dynasty, compiled about 650: ‘This earth is now used for painters’ work,
and rarely enters into medical prescriptions; during recent generations
it has been used to make white porcelain.” As T‘ao Yin-chii was a cel-
ebrated author on pharmaceutical and other scientific subjects, who died
A. D. 536, Dr. Hirth argues that had the pai-ngo or kaolin been used in
his time on an extensive scale in the manufacture of chinaware, so
learned a writer would almost certainly have mentioned the subject, and
he therefore concludes that the use of porcelain earth for the manufac-
ture of pottery came into use later than 536, and at some time during
the T‘ang period, prior to 650, about which date the pharmacopeia of
that dynasty was compiled.

This negative testimony does not, however, dispose of the strong
argument in favor of the earlier date, afforded by the coining during the
Han dynasty of a new word, tz‘w#, to designate the productions of that
age, a word which, as already stated, is still in ordinary use to desig- ©
nate porcelain. On this point Dr. Hirth thinks he has detected that
the word tz‘u has had different significations at different epochs, for
while in the Shuo-wén, a glossary published A. D. 100, te‘% is defined
as “ earthenware,” it is defined in the dictionaries of the Sung period—
nine centuries later—as ‘“ hard, fine-grained pottery ;” and calling atten-
tion to the fact that there are now two forms of this character in use, the
original form with the radical denoting “brick or earthen material,”
and a later form with the radical “stone,” he thinks that “this substitu-
tion by later generations for the original sign of a character of the same
sound, but with a radical more appropriate to the category of the word
394 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

as it was at the time understood, may be regarded as indicating a
‘change from the original meaning.”* Evenif this be true, no data are
thereby afforded to help fix even the approximate date of change in the
method of manufacture. For after the change in the system of manu-
facture had taken place, a considerable period would almost certainly
elapse before an author of sufficient literary importance to impose a new
style of writing on the nation would learn sufficient regarding the al-
tered ingredients employed to have the corresponding modification in
the descriptive word suggested to his mind, and a still longer period
would elapse before this newly-coined word would pass into current use.

The authors translated by M. Julien, too, state distinctly that the
introduction of the later form—that with the radical “‘stone”—and the
continued use of it, are due to ignorance and error. At Tz‘ii-chou, a
district anciently within the department of Changté, in Honan prov-
ince, but now belonging to the department of Kuangp‘ing, in Chihli
province, a kind of porcelain was made during the Sung dynasty which
enjoyed a very high reputation, the plain white specimens bringing
even higher prices than the celebrated productions of Tingchow, which
it closely resembled. This ware was known as Tz‘% ware, or porcelain
from Tz‘u-chow, and thus this form of the character, which was origi-
nally a local designation, not an intentional modification of the older
form introduced to typify a modification in the system of manufacture,
passed into general use to designate not merely this special class, but
(erroneously) all porcelain.t ;

ORIGIN OF TERM “ PORCELAIN.”

It is a curious coincidence that no less diversity of opinion has ex-
isted regarding the date at which the western equivalent of this word
t2’u, the term ‘ porcelain,” was introduced and the article it has at dif-
ferent times been used to designate. Pére d’Entrecolles affirms that
the name porcelain was first given by the Portuguese to the Chinese
vases imported by them into Europe in 1518, but further researches
into the history of the word by M. Brongniart and M. de Laborde show
that the name arose from a supposed resemblance in appearance of sur-
face between the transparent pottery of the East and certain shelis
which had been previously so designated. M. de Laborie says:

Les anciens ayant trouvé ou cherché une ressemblance entre ce quils appelaient
porca et certaines coquilles, donnérent a celles-14 le nom de porcella. Le moyen age
accepta cette analogie en appelant porcelaine une famille entiere de coquilles, et

aussi les ouvrages quiétaient faits de nacre de perle, ct, par métonymie, la nacre
seule tirée de la coquille.

*Dr. Hirth: Ancient Chinese Porcelain p. 2.

t Julien, op. cit., p. 29: This is, I think, probably the true explanation of the change
of form; though, writing from memory as I do, and without the necessary works at
hand to refer to, I can not state this to be a fact. I believe that the only correct
form of writing this character recognized at the present time by the Imperial Acad-
emy is the original form, with the radical ‘‘earthenware,” not that with the radical
“stone.”
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. 395

A partir du XIV® siecle, les gardes des joyaux décrivent en grand nombre dans les
inventaires, et les experts mentionnent et estiment dans leurs rapports, des vases, des
ustensiles de table, des tableaux de dévotion, et des joyaux faits de la porcelaine.
Cette expression a4 travers quelques variantes sans importance, reste la méme et s’ap-
plique aux mémes choses jusqu’au XVI° siécle; de ce moment elle se bifurque pour
conserver d’une part sa vieille signification, et s’étendre de Vautre a des vases et
ustensiles d’importation étrangére qui oftraient la méme blancheur nacrée. C’était
la poterie émaillée de la Chine qui s’emparait de ce nom auquel elle n’avait droit que
par une analogie de teinte et de grain.

M. du Sartel is strongly of opinion that the word porcelain was used
in its present sense far earlier than the date assigned by M. de Laborde,
and in support of his view quotes the mention of “ pourcelaine” in royal
inventories dating from 1360 to 1416 for France, and from the beginning
of the sixteenth century for the Roman Empire. These documents
appear to me, however, rather to support M. de Laborde’s views; for
the details given in the French inventories of representations on the
articles named, of our Lord, the Blessed Mother, and of Saints, and of
their decoration with jewels,* would seem to make the possibility of their
being oriental porcelain more than doubtful; while the inventories be-
longing to the Roman Empire, 7. e., from the date M. de Laborde says
the word was applied to oriental pottery, do mention articles undoubt-
edly of real porcelain, all, with one exception, in monochrome.

A statement quoted by M. du Sartel from Pierre Bélon, of 1553, is
worth reproducing, as evidence that in the latter half of the sixteenth
century the word porcelain was still applied to shells, to mother-o’pearl,
to oriental pottery, and even to Italian faience. He says:

Tes vaisseaux de porcelaine, quw’il a vus vendre en public au Caire, lesquels vases
de porcelaine sont transparents et coustent bien cher au Caire et ilz disent mesme-
ment qwilz les apportent des Indes, mais cela ne me sembla vraysemblable; car on

* With regard fo the last mentioned, it should be stated that in the magnificent
Dresden collection, formed chiefly by Augustus the Strong, King of Poland and
Elector of Saxony, between 1694 and 1705, there is a small ivory-white plate with
uncut rubies and emeralds in gold filigree let into the paste, with the character fu,
happiness, on the foot in blue under the glaze, which is said to have been brought by
a crusader from Palestine in the twelfth century.

THE FIVE DYNASTIES, 907 To 959.

To the T’ang succeeded the epoch of the five dynasties, all of them
short-lived and naming themselves successors to some one of the more
important dynasties that had preceded them.

Under one of these, the Posterior Chou, during the reign of the
Emperor Shih-tsung (954 to 959), a celebrated porcelain, far superior to
any yet produced, was manufactured in the district of Pien, the present
department of K‘aiféng, in Honan province. It is described as being
sky-blue in color, of brilliant surface, thin as paper, and giving out a
clear musical sound when struck, the only defect being that the base
was apt to be disfigured by the remains of the coarse sand on which the
vessel had rested in the furnace, and which had become attached to it
during the process of baking. The color was adopted in obedience to
an imperial order that porcelain intended for palace use should thence-
forward be “as blue as the clear sky after rain.” This porcelain, which
was consequently termed Yii-yao, ‘“ Imperial porcelain,” and after the
accession of the succeeding dynasty Ch‘ai-yao, Ch‘ai porcelain (Ch‘ai
being the Emperor’s family name), was very highly prized, and becom-
ing in subsequent years, owing to its delicate make, exceedingly rare,
the smallest fragments were treasured as cap ornaments or necklace
pendants. Porcelain, blue in color and with the characters “blue as
the clear sky after rain” stamped in the glaze, is at the present time to
be obtained in China. It is scarcely necessary to state, however, that
such specimens do not date from the time of Shih-tsung; on the contrary,
they are of quite modern manufacture. Already in the sixteenth cent-
ury Hsiang Tzu-ching writes in the preface to his catalogue, “ In the
present day men search for a fragment of this porcelain without being
able to find one, and declare it to be but a phantom.” *

EARLIEST PORCELAIN EXTANT DATES FROM SUNG DYNASTY.

In truth, the description which has been attempted of the varieties
of porcelain hitherto enumerated possesses merely a historical interest.
No specimens manufactured prior to the advent of the Sung dynasty
have survived to the present day, and even of the Sung productions the
finer kinds have entirely disappeared. Such specimens as have weathered
the storms and dangers of the subsequent eight centuries are, so far as I
am aware, only céladons of considerable solidity—chiefly Lungeh‘itian
or Chiinchow ware—or small pieces of no great finenéss. Three cent-
uries ago even the finest varieties were already scarce, as is evident

a Venus basin,” i. ¢., a Venice basin. It may remain a question whether Majolica,
exported by way of Venice, was called China from asupposed resemblance to oriental
porcelain, or whether the wares alluded to by Florio were in fact oriental. Minsheu,
in his Spanish dictionary (1599), gives ‘* Porcellana, a kinde of earthen vessell painted ;
costly fruit dishes of fine earth, painted ”—quoted in Marryat’s History of Pottery and
Porcelain, p. 242.

*Bushell: Chinese porcelain before the present dynasty, p. 72.
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. 397

from a passage in the Pring hua-p‘u, an essay on flower-pots and flowers
in pots, from the pen of Chang Ch‘ienté, an author who wrote near the
close of the Ming dynasty, that is, about the beginning of the seven-
teenth century :

In ancient times no vases were made of porcelain, and up to the T‘ang dynasty all
such vessels were made of copper. It was not till then that pottery came into vogue.
After this period we find a large number of classes of porcelain, such as the kinds
known as Ch‘ai (that described above), Ju, Kuan, Ko, Ting, Lungch‘iian Chiinchou,
Changshéng, Wuni (all of the Sung dynasty period), Hsiianté and Ch’énghua (of the
Ming dynasty). Among antiquities, copper articles are the best; of porcelain, the
Ch‘ai and Ju kinds, though the best of all, have ceased to exist; Kuan, Ko, Hsuan,
and Ting porcelains are the most precious curiosities of the present day; whereas the
porcelains called Lungch‘iian (the heavy old celadons of modern collectors), Chiin-
chou, Changshéng, Wuni and Ch’énghua are esteemed as objects of only secondary
value.” *

As Chang Ch‘ien-té further says that he constantly met with speci-
mens of Juchou porcelain, and since vases of that ware are figured
in Hsiang Tzt-ching’s catalogue, it would appear that this highly
esteemed porcelain must have disappeared from the*market towards
the close of the sixteenth century. It is curious, too, that while Chang
Ch‘ien-té places the productions of the Ch’énghua period (1465 to 1487)
at the foot of the list of porcelains of ‘‘only secondary value,” the
prices paid for this ware within a century of its production were very
high. In Hsiang Tzti-ching’s catalogue the price paid for a tazza-shaped
cup is stated to have been 60 taels (or $90 gold); and of two miniature
wine-cups he says, *“ these are choice specimens of the wine cups of
this celebrated reign, and are valued at 100 taels ($150 gold) the pair,
yet now even for this money it is impossible to get them.”t

SUNG DYNASTY, 960 To 1259.

The porcelain manufactured under this dynasty appears to have far
excelled in quality and delicacy of workmanship all that preceded it,
the Ch‘ai-yao alone perhaps excepted. The shapes and ornamental ~
decorations appear to have been modelled, as a rule, after ancient
bronzes, as figured in illustrated catalogues of the most celebrated
specimens of such vessels (as the Po-ku-t‘u), published during the
Hsiian-ho period, 1119 to 1125, and the K‘ao-ku-t‘u; and when not
modeled after such ancient designs, the vessel took the form of some
natural object, as a tree or flower or of some animal real or imaginary.
In the former the pattern was engraved with a pointed style in the
paste, and was broken here and there by lions’ or dragons’ heads in
bold relief, with an elaboration and wealth of ornament hitherto un-
dreamed of. That a remarkable degree of proficiency had by this time
been obtained in the Ceramic art is evident from the descriptions pre-

served by Hsiang Tzit-ching of some specimens of Tingchou ware seen
by him.

(1) A sacrificial jar in the form of an elephant from an ancient bronze design.
The body forms the wine vessel, the uplifted trunk the spout, a narrow canopy arch-
ing over the saddle the handle, to which is attached a round cover ornamented with
geometrical and spiral scroll borders surmounted by a knot. The rope girths and
ornamental details engraved under a white glaze.

(2) A branched pricket candlestick—a slender pillar on a solid foliated stand
curves at the top to end in a pheenix-head, from the back of which hangs a ring chain,
which suspends the stem of a lotus, branching into three flowers to hold the candles,
which are shaded by a huge overhanging leaf. Ornamented with engraving under a
pure white glaze.

(3) A jar which was of irregular quadrangular section, carved in relief after an an-
cient bronze design, with lobes on the body, a scroll border below, and a band of
ornament in the form of coiled dragons round the neck. Loop handles terminating
in horned heads and with rings hanging from them project from the neck. Covered
with glaze the color of ripe grapes, transparent and of a perfect luster—a beautiful
vase to hold flowers for the table.*

INTRODUCTION OF COLORED DECORATION.

Prior to the Sung dynasty the external color of all porcelain appears
to have been solely determined by that of the glaze, and to have been
almost entirely monochrome. Ina few instances vases were covered
with parti-colored glazes, which were apt to flow into one another in the
heat of the kiln, and so gave rise to the fortuitous productions known
as Yao-pien (the French flambés), articles the decoration of which
‘““changed during the process of baking.’ The Sung porcelain was
essentially, I believe, of the same character, the coloring of the article
produced being determined only by the kind of glaze which was spread
over the paste or biscuit.

With the sole exception of the Nanténg ware, and a portion of that
from Linch’uan, produced during the Yiian dynasty, none of which
seems to have survived to the present day, but which is described as
having been decorated with flowers coarsely painted under the glaze,
I can find nothing in the works of Chinese writers on this subject to
justify the concession of a greater antiquity than the early part of the
Ming dynasty, 2. e., the first half of the fifteenth century, to the orna-
mentation of vases with arabesques and scroll work, with landscapes,
historical scenes, or genre paintings in several colors.

This conclusion, if correct, is a point of considerable importance as an
aid in determining the true age of specimens which are at times credited
with an origin far remote. Itis true that céladon vases into the orna-
mentation of which leaves enter, are sometimes described as having the
leaves veined with dark green, but these deeper shades may result from
the fact that the ornamentation has been engraved in the paste, and
that the coloring matter has sunk into the line of engraving, thereby
producing a darker shade along the lower levels. Other specimens of

* Bushell: Op. cit. Nos. 33, 80, 18.
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. o99

céladon ware had one or sometimes two bands of ornamentation of a
- deeper green than the body of the vase. This deeper tone might, how-
ever, have been produced by a double layer of glaze; in any case the
peculiarity would not amount to ornamentation in several colors in the
sense in which I use that expression. Again, the single specimen of
black Tingchou porcelain illustrated (and indeed ever seen) by Hsiang
Tzi-ching is described as ‘‘a duck-headed vase, bottle shape, with swell-
ing body and ringed neck, which curves over to end in a duck’s head,
a round orifice with a small cover being on the convexity of the curve.
The black color is painted on the head and neck, gradually fading away
on the body of the vase, which is enamelled white.”* This description
conveys the idea that the head and neck of the duck were covered with
black glaze, the body of the vase with white glaze, and that in the bak-
ing the former spread downwards and gradually merged into the white
of the body. Itin no way invalidates the conclusion above suggested.

It will be advisable to examine in greater detail the several varie-
ties of porcelain manufactured under this dynasty; following the order
of merit usually ascribed to them by Chinese writers.

JU-YAO.

Ju-yao or Juchou porcelain.—Chinese authors state that the porcelain
manufactured at Tingchou (see p. 402), being unfit for presentation
to the emperor, the establishment of a factory for the manutacture of
more suitable articles was ordered at Juchou, in Honan province. Ac-
cording to some writers the defect of the Tingchou ware was its gritty
character; according to others, the frequency of cracks caused by too
rapid or careless baking. As, however, they agree in ascribing the in-
troduction of Ju-yao and its success to the early part of the Sung dynasty,
1. é., to the very time from which date the finest specimens of the Ting-
chou porcelain, it is difficult not to conclude that native authors, writing
centuries later, have ascribed the establishment of this factory to erro-
neous causes.

The finest specimens, which were very thin and delicate, were supe-
rior to imperial ware (Auan-yao), and were of either plain or crackled t

* Bushell: Op. cit. No. 35.

t Crackling (craquelure) was originally considered in Europe a defect of baking,
which resulted from a lack of homogenity between paste and glaze, causing one to
contract more rapidly thandidthe other. It was not tillacomparatively recent date
that the actual facts came to be appreciated, namely, that in the eyes of the Chinese
the craquelure is a species of decoration, and that they have a special kind of en-
ame!, into the composition of which steatite enters largely, the sole object of which
is to produce this curious appearance. By means of this enamel they can at will
cover the surface of a vase with any one of a variety of craquelure, either large
“like cracks in ice,” or small as ‘“‘ the fishroe,” “‘ the dodder” or “‘ the crabs’ claws.” -
Ir some specimens, bands are found crackled separating other bands not crackled ;
or colors, usually either black or red, are rubbed into the crackling to render it more
apparent, or to impart a tinge to the entire suzface. In other specimens again,

surface, with the ornamentation engraved under the paste. The
craquelure, though coarse in inferior specimens, must in the better
grades have been very close and fine, as it is described as resembling
fishroe. But that not crackled was the most highly esteemed. Hsiang
Tzi’-ching, describing a beaker of old bronze design with engraved dec-
oration under a bluish-green color not crackled, speaks of it as ‘a rare
kind of Juchou ware.” In colorit was céladon. In one place this por-
celain is described, it is true, as being like the sky after rain, but as
elsewhere it is stated tohave resembled the Ko-yao, or crackled céladons
in color, though somewhat darker in shade, there seems no reason to
doubt that its real tint was bluish-green, ?@. ¢., céladon, especially as the
specimens of this ware illustrated in the catalogue translated by Dr.
Bushell are so painted.* Hsiang Tzii‘-ching, the author of this cata-
logue, after describing a vase 63 inches high, which is stated to have
cost 150,000 cash, or about $150 gold, says ‘‘specimens of Juchou ware
are very rare, and, when met with, are usually plates and bowls. A
perfect unbroken vase like this is almost unique, and as it excels both
Kuan and Ko porcelain both in form and glaze, it is far more valua-
ble.” Within three or four decades later, as has already been stated,
it seems to have been impossible to find any specimens at all of this
ware.

KUAN-YAO.

Kuan-yao—t. ¢., official or government porcelain—was the produce of
the imperial factories established under the Sung dynasty between the
years 1107 and 1117 at Pienliang, the present department of K‘aiféng,
in Honan province, and after the removal southwards of the court
before the advancing Mongols, at the southern capital, Hangechou, in
Chehkiang province. During the Takuan period (1107 to 1110) the

though for what reason is not known, the paste, after having been decorated, is cov-
ered with a crackled glaze, and a second decoration, having no apparent connection
with that beneath, is painted above the glaze. The colors of the Juchou, govern-
ment (Awan), Ko, Lung ch‘iian and Chiinchou porcelains were all some shade of what
the Chinese call ch‘ing. Now ch‘ing means in some combinations blue, in others a
pale dull green, as of the fresh olive, which is called by the Chinese ch‘ing-kuo, the
ch‘ing-colored fruit. Pére d’Entrecolles, when writing of the Lung ch‘tian ware, de-
scribes its color correctly as teinte d’olive. M. Julien, however, in spite of a hint
given from the technical annotator M. Salvetat, which might have set him right,
rejected this sense on what seemed to him sufficient grounds, and insisted on (errone-
ously) translating this word throughout his work as ‘‘ blue,” though by so doing he
had to make his porcelain ‘‘as blue as (green) jade ”—with the result that subsequent
writers on this subject have failed to derive any assistance from his work in deter-
mining the origin and history of céladon porcelain. Hirth: Op. cit., p. 7.

Céladon was originally the name of the hero in the popular novel l’ Astrée, written
by Honore d’Urfé in the seventeenth century. Céladon was attired in clothes of a
kind of sea-green hue with gray or bluish tint, and his name thus came to be applied
to the clothes he wore, precisely that designated by the Chinese as ch‘ing.

* Julien: Op. cit. p. 63. Bushell: Op. cit. Nos. 19, 22, 34.
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. 401 -

shades specially affected were, first, pale white like the moon, the
French clair de lune; second, pale bluish green; and third, dark green;
but during the Chingho period (1111 to 1117) the only color employed
was bluish-green, both dark and pale in tint. This porcelain was very
thin, and in some cases crackled all over so finely as to resemble erab’s
claws in shape, with the red brim and iron-colored foot distinctive of
the true céladon. The Po-wu-yao-lan, quoted in the T’a0-shuo Treatise
on Pottery (ch. 2, p. 9), explains this latter expression as follows:

As regards Kuan-yao, it should be known that the porcelain earth found at the foot
of the Fénghuang-shan, or Pheenix hill, near Hangchou, is red; for this reason the
foot (the base on which the vessel rests when being fired, and which is therefore not
covered by the enamel), resembles iron in color. This was at the time called ‘‘red-
mouthed and iron-footed.” The term ‘‘red mouth” refers to the brim or opening of
the vessel, which becomes red by the enamel flowing down and away fromit, so as to

be much thinner on the brim than it is on the body of the vessel, thus allowing spots
of red paste to become visible.

Dr. Hirth, after quoting this explanation, adds:

The red or iron colored bottom, usually appearing in the shape of a ring, is a char-
acteristic feature of the Lungch‘iian céladons; but if the above explanation is cor-
rect, the bottom of Lungch‘iian vessels differed from MKuan-yao bottoms, since the
paste of Hangchou céladons (the southern Kuan-yao) is said to be red in itself,
whereas that of the Lungch‘iian-yao is originally white, and merely turns red in such
- parts of the surface as are not covered by the enamel.*

From. Hsiang Tzt ching’s catalogue it would seem as if there were
originally two recognized classes of this ware: ordinary Kuan-yao and
Ta-kuan, or superior Kuan-yao. Among the latter he mentions an
ink-slab for the emperor’s use, in which ‘‘an oval was left unglazed in
the center for rubbing the ink on, showing the red paste.” Both were
céladon in color; in the superior variety (ta-kuan), however, the glaze
appears to have been more brilliant—it is described as “ clear and lus-
trous, like an emerald in tint.” The two specimens of this ware de-
scribed were both coarsely crackled. The ordinary Kuan-yao was in
some cases crackled with a glaze varying from pale green to deep onion ;
in other specimens uncrackled, the latter being seemingly of a lighter
tint than the crackled, the ornamentation, consisting of a variety of
scroll designs or of some geometrical patterns broken by animals’
heads in relief, was engraved under the glaze.t :

After the court had been removed southwards to Hangchou, Shao
Ch‘éng-chang, superintendent of the Northern Imperial Park, is said to
have established a factory in the residence of the junior director of the
palace. Made of very pure clay, with great grace of form and covered
with a transparent, brilliant glaze, this porcelain, which was termed
Nei-yao porcelain of the palace or Kuan-yao—government porcelain—
gained a high reputation.

TING-YAO.

Ting-yao, or porcelain of Tingchou, was marufactured originally in
the district of that name in Chihli province, near the present depart-
ment of Chéngting. It was known as Pei-ting or Northern Ting
(960-1126), in contradistinction to the Nan-ting or Southern Ting, pro-
duced at Hangchou after the retreat uf the court southwards before
the advancing Mongols in 1127. The former was the more highly
prized, and the finest specimens of this ware were those produced, it is
said, during the period Chéngho (1111 to 1117) and Hstianho (1119 to
1125). In color they were brilliant white, purple or black; and though
the Ko-ku-yao-lan (a work treating of antiquities, completed in 1387), as
quoted in the T‘ao-shuo, or Treatise on Porcelain, from which the au-
thors translated by M. Julien derive most of their information regarding
the ceramics of earlier dynasties, gives as the test of Tingchow porce-
lain “the purity of its white color and brilliancy of its glaze,” it is evi-
dent that the connoisseur Hsiang Tzti ching experienced a stronger
affection for his ‘‘ beautiful purple glaze, uniformly brilliant and trans-
parent, resembling the tint of ripe grapes or of the anbergine (egg-
plant)” and his black, than he did for the white glaze, though it were
in his own words “uniformly lustrous and translucent, like mutton-fat
or fine jade.” Both the purple and black varieties were far rarer than
the white. ‘I have seen,” says the collector, ‘“ hundreds of specimens
of the white, scores of purple-brown, but the black is extremely rare,
and I have only seen the one specimen I have described in my whole
life”—-and he then had at least one of his specimens more than fifty
years. It is, I think, in this rarity of the purple and black glazes that
the explanation of the dictum above quoted is to be found, and prob-
ably they were unknown to its authors. The varieties mentioned in
the Ko-ku-yao-lan as inferior to the white do not include these colors,
and seem to result from impure clay or defective glaze.

The same work (the Ku-ku-yao-lan) says that one of the signs of the
genuineness of this ware was the presence of marks on it like tears. This
probably means granulations, for it is explained that these marks were
caused by the manner in which the enamel was thrown upon the white
paste. Specimens having ornamental designs engraved in the paste
were the best, though the plain or unornamented were also highly
esteemed ; the second-class consisted of such as had the ornamentation
worked into the enamel, and a third of such as had the decoration
printed or pressed upon them with a mold, the ornaments chiefly used
being the Chinese peony or Peonia moutan, the hsiian-ts‘ao or Hemero-
callis fulva, and the flying fénghuang (Phenix). In Hsiang Tzu-ching’s

is in general character exactly similar to that found on the Juchou
ware already described.

Tingchow ware was well imitated during the Yiian dynasty (1260 to
1367) by one P‘eng Chiin-pao at Hochou, in Kiangnan province, and
later on very successfully at Chingté-chen.* His productions, known
as P‘éng porcelain, after himself, and Ho porcelain, from the locality,
are described as “fine in paste and white in color, looking very much
like real Ting-yao.”

LUNGCH‘UAN.

Lungchian-yao (Lungeh‘iian porcelain) was manufactured from the
early part of the Sung dynasty (end of tenth or beginning of eleventh
century) in the district of that name, situated in the department of
Chitichou, Chehkiang province. The ornamentation was engraved
under the glaze, which was of various shades from the color of grass to
deep onion-green, sometimes crackled and sometimes not crackled; and
occasionally bands of foliate or scroll pattern are found of deeper tone
than the rest of the vessel, The biscuit. which was of fine clay, turned
brown when the absence of glaze had exposed it to the effect of heat
during baking, though when covered by the glaze and in fractures it
remained white, and on the base or foot was a ferruginous ring. The
specimens which survive are mostly coarse and thick, but as the best
specimens were considered but little inferior to Kuan-yao, these prob-
ably represent only the rougher and inferior grades. In the designs no
little artistic merit is shown at times. One specimen which is described
by Hsiang Tzt-ching (and I have myself seen one exactly similar)
consists of a whorl of palm-leaves surrounding a hollow stem to hold
flowers. Another is ‘‘a sacrificial urn moulded in the form of a horn-
less rhinoceros, the body hollowed out to hold wine, with a peaked
saddle on the back as cover, after a bronze design from the Po-ku-t‘u
“enclycopeedia.” The author translated by M. Julien states that this
ware was subsequently successfully imitated at Chingté-chén, and that
the latter surpassed the originals in beauty. Dr. Hirth, however, avers
ou the authority of native connoisseurs that the pure Lungch‘iian
products can be distinguished from all imitations; first, because it is
a peculiarity of the clay used in the manufacture of the former alone
to turn brown or red on the surface when left exposed during baking,
while the biscuit remains white where covered; and, secondly, because,
owing to this peculiarity of the clay, the ferruginous ring on articles
of white porcelain manufactured elsewhere can only be produced by
artificially coloring the foot or base; an act which of course admits of
ready detection on the part of an experienced collector.t

KO-YAO OR CHANG-YAO.

Subsequently, after the removal of the court southwards in 1127, ac-
cording to an authority quoted in the Topography of the Chehkiang
province, the brothers Chang, natives of Ch‘iichow, but having their
factory in the Lungceh‘iian district, gained a high reputation for their por-
celain. These brothers are known as Shéng-i, the elder-born, and Shéng-
érh, the second-born. The produce of the former’s kiln was called
Ko-yao, or elder-brother’s porcelain, to distinguish it from that manu-
factured by the younger Chang, which was termed Chang-yao or Chang
Lungchian yao, t.é., Lungeh‘iian porcelain made by Chang (the younger).
Both are céladon in color, though the elder brother’s ware appears to
have been lighter in tint, and both have the distinctive marks of céladon,
the red mouth or opening and ferruginous ring on the foot. The main
difference between the two seems to have been that the Ko-yao was
crackled—so closely in the best specimens as to resemble the fishroe—
whereas the Chang-yao was uncrackled. In other respects the descrip-
tions are curiously conflicting. The history of the Chingté-chén factory
states that Ho-yao was extremely thin, while the Ww-ts‘a-tsu, a work of
the Ming dynasty, speaks of it as the one kind of porcelain of this epoch
‘of which it is not too difficult to-obtain specimens, owing to its pecul-
iar heaviness, which enables it to last long.” As compared with the
more ancient porcelain of. Lungceh‘iian, the productions of the two Chang
are described as “smaller, more graceful in shape, and showing greater
delicacy of workmanship.”*

CHUN-YAO.

The Chun-yao was a porcelain made from the early part of the Sung
dynasty, in the district of Chiinchou or sometimes wrongly correspond-
ing to the present district of Yii-chow, in the department of K‘aiféng,
Honan province. It was sometimes molded in grotesque forms (e. g.,
a lamp formed of a hornless dragon with scaly body and four short legs,
the serpent-like head protruding with mouth open to receive the wick
and body hollowed into a receptacle for oil), but was usually modelled
after ancient bronzes and ornamented with scroll or floral patterns under
the glaze, which, according to Hsiang Tziiching, was either vermilion-
red or aubergine purple—the two most valuable colors—moonlight
white (clair de lune) or pale green, and sometimes marked with granu-
lations. The authorities quoted in the T‘ao-shuo, or Treatise on Pottery,
would lead one to believe that the best pieces had two or more colors
of glaze on the same vase. The higher quality, according to them, con-
sisted of pieces having a color red like cinnabar and green like onion-
leaves and kingfisher’s feathers, which is commonly ealled parrot-green,
and aubergine purple, or of pieces red like rouge, green like onion-leaves

and kingfisher’s feathers, and purple likeink; these three colors being
intact and unchanged by baking. M. Julien enumerates seven varie-
ties: (1) green or blue like plums; (2) purple-brown like the auberg-
ine; (3) red likethe Pyrus japonica; (4) pig’s liver; (5) mule’s lungs;
(6) mucus; (7) sky-blue. But such differentiation appears erroneous,
for the Treatise on Pottery says:

Pieces that have one or two numbers on the bottom as a trade mark, and are of a
color resembling pig’s liver—since the red, ch‘ing (céladon), and green colors got
mixed together like salvai hanging down through not being sufficiently fired—are
not to be distinguished as different kinds. For such names as mucus or pig’s liver,
which are given to this class of porcelain, have been invented for fun’s sake. Among
these porcelains those which have bottoms like the flower-pots in which sword-grass
is grown are considered the most excellent; the others, viz, those which have ton-
shaped censers, Ho-fang jugs, or Kuan-tzu, are all of a yellowish sandy paste, for
which reason they are not good in appearance.*

The same authority adds that none of these porcelains lasted long.
‘Specimens are, however, I believe still to be found. Hsiang Tzii-ching,
after describing a small jar, of globular form, with two boldly designed
phoeenixes molded in high relief as handles, interrupting a border of
spirally ornamented medallions, adds:

Chiinchou porcelain is put at the bottom of the Sung potteries, yet a jar like this
oue, of elegant form, good color, and fine engraved work, equals, if not excells, as a
flower-vase, one of Ju, Kuan, Ko, or Ting pottery. It is marked beneath with the
numeral wu, five, an additional proof that it is really a Chiin piece. t

TUNG-CH‘ING-YAO.

Tung-ch‘ing-yao, or céladon porcelain, from the eastern capital, was
produced at factories situated in the department of K‘aiféng, Honan
provinee, the so-called eastern capital of the Sung monarchs, before
their retreat southwards, from 960 to 1126. It was of various shades
of céladon, uncrackled (seemingly), with the ornamentation engraved
under the glaze. The description given by Hsiang Tzii-ching of a small
vessel of this ware will convey a truer idea of its character than the
vague disquisition of the encyclopedists.

*The translation followed is Dr. Hirth’s, but the sense is better brought out by Dr.
Bushell’s more correct rendering, which runs thus: ‘“‘Among these porcelains the
flower-pots and saucers for growing sword-grass are the most beautiful; the others,
namely, the barrel seats, censers aud boxes, square vases and jars with covers,” etc.
(North China Herald, 12th May, 1888.) The words here rendered, ‘‘the flower-pots
and saucers for growing sword-grass” are translated by M. Julien ‘‘les plats sous le
pied desquels on a peint un glaieul.” This misconception of the meaning has, as Dr.
Hirth points out, led astray all later writers on porcelain and its marks who have re-
lied on Julien into describing the acorus as a mark, when found on the foot of a ves-
sel, of its being a Kinn (Chiin) piece of the finest quality. Dr. Hirth also draws at-
tention to the fact that the expression f‘u-ss% wén, translated by Julien when treating
of one class of this porcelain as showing ‘‘ veines imitant les soies (poils) du liévre,”
really means showing veining lile the cu&scuta or dodder—t‘u-ssii being the name of
that pliant.

“Tt is of hexagonal form, with lobed border, decorated in panels, with
formal sprays of flowers, plum blossoms, polyporus fungus, and grass,
chrysanthemum, bamboo, ete., carved in relief under a glaze of bright
ereen color like jade, raised in faint millet-like tubercles.”*

LESS CELEBRATED VARIETIES.

In addition to the above celebrated productions of the Sung dy-
nasty, the following less remarkable varieties may be mentioned :

The Hsiao-yao, from the Hsiao district, in the department of Hsiichou,
Kiangnan provinee, extremely thin and brilliant, white in color,
and very elegant in shape and workmanship.

The Chichou-yao, from the district of that name, corresponding with
the present Luling district, in the department of Chi-an, Kiangnan
province, both white and violet, the latter closely resembling the
violet porcelain of Tingchou. The best was made by the family
Shu; that produced by the daughter Shu Chiao realizing almost as
much as fo-yao (the elder Chang’s porcelain). Her large vases for
holding flowers would fetch several ounces of silver each. Regard-
ing the violet variety, the technical annotator of M. Julien’s work
adds the following note: ‘11 est probable que ces porcelaines vio-
lettes étaient fabriquées a Vétat de biscuit, et colorées ensuite avec
un émail plombeux coloré parle manganése. Cette considération
reporterait 4 ’année 960 de notre ere les glacures plombiféres; ce
nest qwen 1283 qu’un potier de Schelestadt trouva le procédé de
vernir la poterie au moyen du plomb, et put eréer une fabrication
véritablement industrielle.” |

The Hsiuchou-yao and Ssuchou-yao, from the districts respectively of

the same name in the Kiangnan province. They resembled the
(white?) Tingchow porcelain, but were far inferior in quality.

The T‘ang-yi-yao and Téngchou-yao manufactured in the T‘ang Téugehou
districts of the department of Nayang, Honan province—both
céladon, but, like the next, inferior to Juchou ware.

The Yaochou-yao, from the district of that name in the department of
Hsi-an, Shansi province. They were originally céladon, but vases
of white porcelain, possessed of considerable merit, but lacking in
grace and strength, were subsequently produced.

The Wuni-yao, from the department of Chienning, Fukien province—a
céladon made from black coarse clay, lacking in polish and with
dry looking glaze.

The Chien-yao, from the department of Chienchou, the present district
of Chienyang, in the department of Chienning, Fukien province—
thin, of pale black color and of high polish, it was highly esteemed ;
some specimens were studded with granulations resembling drops
or yellow pearls.

THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. AOT

The Yiuhang-yao, from the Yiihang district, in the department of Hang-
chou, Chehkiang province—a kind of céladon, resembling Kuan-
yao, but inferior, possessing neither the same crackle nor bDril-
lianey.

The Lishui-yao, from Lishui district, in the department of Ch‘iichou,
Chehkiang province—heavy and thick, resembling in color the
Lungceli‘iian. (7. ¢., céladon) ware, but far inferior to it.*

YUAN DYNASTY, 1260 To 1349.

Under the Mongol dynasty, the Yiian (1260 to 1349), the manufact-
ure of porcelain generally appears to have retrograded. Exceptions,
however, must at least be made in favor of that produced for the special
use of the emperor. This ware--to judge from the specimens de-
scribed by Hsiang Tzii-ching—was white in color, with the ornamenta-
tion faintly engraved inthe paste. Plates, bowls, etc., are said to have
borne the characters shu-fu, “the palace,” inscribed on the interior on
the foot. Hsiang Tzt-chingt states that this shu-fu porcelain was
copied from the Tingchou ware of the Northern Sung dynasty, and the
vase in his own collection he considers altogether like a Ting piece in
its form, in the color of the paste and in the engraved design.

The details given by native writers regarding the productions of
this period are scanty in the extreme. They mention, however, that
at Lungch‘iian céladons were produced on the model of the Chang
ware, but the clay used was coarse and dry, and failed to give the fine
color which had characterized the older productions.

At Ho-chou, in the Kiangnan province, P‘éng Chiin-pao produced,
as already stated, some excellent porcelain, known as New Ting-yao and
from the name of the district in which it was produced, Ho-yao or ware
of Ho, and closely resembling the older ware from Tingchow. Made
from fine, white, plastic clay, it was very thin and céladon in color.
Other varieties mentioned are:

The Hstianchou-yao, from the department of that name in Kaingnan
province, very thin and white in color.

The Linch‘uan-yao, from the district of that name in the department of
Fuchou, Kiangsi province, was a porcelain made from soft white
clay. It was thin, and generally white, with a light yellow tinge;
but some bore flowers coarsely painted.

The Nanféng-yao, from the district of that name in the department of
Chienchang, Kiangsi province, was a somewhat thick porcelain, in
many cases ornamented with flowers in blue. These two latter
kinds appear to have been very famous under the Yiian dynasty,
and to have been much preferred to the productions of Chingté-
chén.

The Hut‘ien-yao, manufactured in the neighborhood of Chingté-chén,
was either a yellowish-black, or, if white, had a tint of that color. {

408 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888

No specimens of these wares have, however, so far as I am aware,
survived to the present day, and among those which Chinese connois-
seurs now declare to be red products of the Yiian dynasty one seldom
sees any but such as are of a uniform whitish-purple with deep red -
splashes.

MING DYNASTY, 1368 To 1649.

Under the Ming dynasty the ceramic art made great progress, both
in the fineness of the ware and in the excellence of the decorative
workmanship. It would appear that under the Yiian dynasty imperial
orders were not invariably executed at the government factories, but
were frequently entrusted to private enterprise. None, however, of the
articles tendered was accepted unless considered perfect, and the test
was so severe, that as much as 90 per cent. was at times rejected.
Under the Ming dynasty, however, the manufacture appears to have
been more and more restricted to the Chingté-chén factories, which
thenceforward practically monopolized the production of artistic por-
celain. The administration was reformed, and officers were despatched
from the capital with the orders, the execution of which they had to
superintend, and on completion to deliver to the palace—duties which,
like most others of emolument and dignity, were absorbed by eunuchs
during the reigns of the last emperors of that dynasty.

In their paintings, which are always in water color, the Chinese, while
of course requiring on the artist’s part a knowledge of the technique
adequate to a proper treatment of the subject chosen, admire chiefly a
boldness of stroke which proves complete mastery over the pencil, and
a facility of conception which permits of improvisation, so to speak; that
is, of the elaboration of the original design currente calamo, and with-
out having previously outlined a sketch of it upon the object to be
decorated. This style of painting is termed pi-i, “ following the will of
the brush.” An artist who first sketches out his design and then care-
fully and elaborately fills in the details, a style which is depreciatingly
termed kung-i, “‘ mechanical ”, occupies in their estimation a very sub-
ordinate position. And the characteristics of the two styles are so
clearly defined, or at least are so patent to the practised native eye,
that a single glance almost suffices to enable a connoisseur to determine
to which of the two a painting belongs.

In a country, too, where painting as a profession does not exist, and
where the interchange of fans or scrolls painted by the donors, as one
of the most ordinary forms of courtesy, generates, if not a profound
knowledge of the art, at least a very general practical proficiency in
it, it has resulted that the most noted artists are to be found among the
class enjoying the most leisure—that formed of the successful competi-
tors in the literary examinations which constitute the one entry to offii-
cial employment. Inthis way the more highly esteemed style of paint-
ing, with its bold free stroke, came to be considered (as indeed it prac-
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. 409

tically was) the almost exclusive production of the literary or official
class. Hence when, during the Ch‘énghua period, the decoration of
porcelain in many colors came to be that most highy prized, it became
customary to have the designs drawn by the most celebrated artists
amony the palace officials and to transmit them to the manufactory to
be there executed by the most skilled painters.

Owing to the care thus exercised in obtaining decorative designs from
the brushes of the best artists and in having them executed by the most
able workmen, the manufacture reached a higher point of excellence
during this (the Ch‘énghua) period than at any other time during the
Ming dynasty, and the steps of development which led to this result
may be distinctly traced.

As has been remarked earlier, decoration by painting in colors as dis-
tinct from the general coloring imparted by glaze is, I believe, first
reached under the Ming dynasty. In the Yunglo period (1403 to 1424)
it took the form of decoration in blue under the glaze. Special atten-
tion was paid to this style during the Hsiianté period (1426 to 1435),
and owing probably to the adoption of a special kind of foreign blue
(known in Chinese as Su-ni-po, which appears to have been obtainable
during this period alone), a brillianey of color was attained which was
never afterwards quite equaled. At the same time, however, a brilliant
red color attracted universal admiration. At first this was used by itself
either as a uniform coloring over the outside of bowls and cups, or for
the delineation of fishes or peaches upon the white ground, the contrast
of the two colors, both striking in brilliancy, being highly admired.
Then a form was adopted which, while it gave due prominence to the
bighly prized crimson, admitted of the introduction of other colors in
a subordinate capacity, such as vessels in the shape of persimmons
(Diospyros kaki) on a leafy branch forming the handle, the fruit being
red, and the leaves and stalk of their natural colors, green of various
shades and brown respectively. From this form of decoration it required
but a step to reach the use of the enamel colors for which the Ch‘énghua’
period (1465 to 1487) is famous.

The use of enamel colors continued during the Hungchih period
(1488 to 1505), some of the specimens being scarcely inferior to
the best pieces of Ch‘énghua ware, but gradually gave way in public
favor to a pale yellow glaze covering an ornamentation engraved in the
paste. This was also the most highly esteemed production of the
Ch‘éngté period (1506 to 1521): though the efforts to obtain further
supplies of blue from the west being crowned with success, a revival
in favor of “blue and white” china took place during this and
especially the following reign till the supply was once more exhausted.

Peculation, misgovernment and its attendant disorders and an in-
creasing difficulty in finding the finer qualities of clay combined to cause
a Steady decline from this period onwards in the artistic excellence of
the porcelain produced. The rapidity of the downward course was con-
410 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

siderably accelerated by the enormous extent of the imperial orders
for the supply of the palace, which, sometimes aggregating 100,000
pairs of articles on a single occasion, taxed the resources of the
government factories beyond their strength, with the result that, in
order to economize money and labor, colors which were expensive or
difficult to procure, were replaced by others less costly and more simple
in their ingredients, and artistic beauty and excellence of workmanship
were sacrificed to promptness in providing the supplies ordered. It is
the gradual dispersion of the articles comprised in the vast orders
issued during the Lungch‘ing (1567 to 1572) and Wanli (1573 to 1619)
periods that has provided the bulk of the specimens in the possession
of modern collectors of what has come to be considered (though in view
of the much higher artistic merit of the ware produced under earlier
emperors very unfairly considered) the characteristic Ming porcelain,
porcelain somewhat coarse in make, faulty in shape, and decorated with
paintings which, though characterized by boldness of design, are usually
marked by ait of care in execution.

While, however, the work of the government fachonies showed these
unmistakable signs of decadence, strenuous efforts were made by a
few isolated private manufacturers to raise the art to its earlier level
of excellence. The imitations by Chou Tan-ch‘iian of the beautiful old
Tingchou ware, and the cups of Hao Shih-chi of a “ dewy-dawn red”
and of egg-shell (the latter at times only weighing one-fortieth of an
ounce apiece) are spoken of in terms of the highest admiration, and
brought fabulous prices. But though these efforts were, if the
statements of Chinese writers can be relied upon, crowned with
complete success so far as the artist’s individual productions were
concerned, they were inadequate to prevent the downward tendency
exerted by the government establishments at Chingté-chén, which
had already for a long while almost monopolized the production of
porcelain in China.

During the remainder of the period that the Ming dynasty held the
throne its energies were so much occupied in endeavoring to suppress
internal disorder and in resisting the attacks of the Manchu Tartars >
on its northern frontiers that no attention was paid to the ceramic art.

From 1403 To 1424.

During the Yunglo period (1403 to 1424) much white porcelain, with
ornamentation in blue under the glaze, commonly known in Europe as
“blue and white china,” was manufactured, which holds third place in
regard to excellence among this class of ware produced during the
Ming dynasty, that of the Hsiianté period (1426 to 1435) occupying the
first, and that of the Ch‘énghua period (1465 to 1487) the second place.
The blue employed is stated in the annals of Fouliang to have been
brought from some Mohammedan country as tribute, and was thence
known as Mohammedan blue. Daring the Yunglo and Hsiianté periods
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA, 411

it was termed Su-ma-li or Su-ma-ni blue, and during the latter Su-ni-po
also. Where this blue came from and whether these Chinese designa-
tions are the reproductions of the name of a country or of a color has
never been determined. Dr. Hirth, while pointing out the resemblance
of the former in sound to smalt (medieval Latin smaltwm), and of the
latter to Schneeberg, “under which name the Saxon biue afterwards
became famous all over the world,”* thinks a search into Arabian or Per-
sian records of that day may yet supply the missing explanation. What
ever it was, the supply was exhausted during the Ch‘énghua period.
Somewhat later, however (during the Chéngté period (1506 to 1521),
Tatang, the governor of Yiinnan province, succeeded in obtaining fur-
ther supplies of Mohammedan blue by paying for it twice its weight in
gold; and during this and the greater part of the subsequent reign
(Chiaching period, 1522 to 1566) it continued available; a fact to which
is doubtless attributable the excellent color of the productions of that
time. Towards the close of the latter reign, however, the supply again
gave out, when an incinerated cobaltiferous ore of manganese (termed
wu-ming-t) replaced the western product; the color obtained from this
native ore, far from equalling the brightness and transparency of the
foreign blue, however, showed a dull and heavy tint after baking.

EGG-SHELL PORCELAIN.

Egg-shell porcelain of very. delicate workmanship was produced, but
owing to its extreme fragility good specimens are now very difficult to
obtain. It appears also to have had a tendency to crack during the
process of firing. These porcelains are termed among the Chinese
t‘o-t‘ai, or porcelain from which the “embryo” or biscuit has been re-
moved, and are divided into two classes: ‘ True ¢‘o-¢‘ai,” the very thin,
also known as egg-shell (¢an-p‘7 or luan-mu) and ‘semi t‘o-t‘ai,” the
somewhat thicker. The true t¢‘o-¢‘ai especially present great difficulties
in the manufacture and require extraordinary dexterity in the hand-
ling, for so thin is the portion of the body the workman allows to re-
main, that if seems as though all had been removed; and it is only quite
recently that the government manufactory at Sevres has succeeded in
producing such porcelain, and then by an entirely different process,
by casting or moulage en barbotine.

The work translated by M. Julien states that while the production of
this ware originated during the Yunglo period it was only the thicker
variety that was then madg, and that the true t‘o-t‘ai dates from a later
epoch, having been produced during the Ch‘énghua period (1465 to 1487)
at the government manufactory and during the Lungeh’ing (1567 to 1572)
and Wanli (1573 to 1619) periods at private factories. This statement
appears, however, to be erroneous; for in No. 295 of this collection will
be found a specimen, so at least Chinese experts state, of the semi Vo-?ai

*Hirth: Op. cit., p. 65.
412 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

(though it seems difficult to believe that a bowl of such size could be
made much thinner and yet be of practical utility), and in Nos. 289 to
294 specimens of the true ¢‘o-t‘ati, both having the inscription Yung-lo-
nien-chih *‘ Made during the Yunglo period” engraved in the old seal
character on its foot. Moreover, the one specimen of this ware described
by Hsiang Tzti-ching is a small cup ‘‘as thin as paper, called ¢‘o-t‘at,
body-less,” @. ¢., true t‘o-t‘ai, not semi t‘o-t'ai, of which he says “there
are not a few of these wine-cups left, yet they are highly appreciated by
collectors of taste.* Specimens of the Ch‘énghua egg-shell will be found
in Nos. 296 to 303.

In spite of the extreme thinness of this ware many specimens—such
as Nos. 289 to 294, already referred to—are adorned with very elabo-
rate designs engraved under the glaze (an operation requiring except-
ional delicacy of workmanship), which are scarcely visible unless the ves-
sel be held against the light or be filled with liquid. These specimens
possess additional interest from the fact that they enable us to picture to
ourselves what the porcelain manufactured for the special use of the pal-
ace under the Yiian dynasty (the Shu-fu) and the Tingchou ware of the
Sung dynasty were like; though, of course, these latter had not the
thinness and delicacy of the egg-shell porcelain. For Hsiang Tzt-ching,
after describing a specimen of Shu-fu porcelain decorated with dragons
in the midst of clouds and with lion’s head handles, all faintly engraved
in the paste under a white glaze, states that ‘‘the porcelain of our own
dynasty (the Ming) of the reigns of Yunglo and Hsiianté, decorated
with patterns engraved under a white glaze, was made after this Shu-fu
porcelain, which was itself copied from the Tingchou porcelain of the
northern Sung dynasty.t

FRom 1426 To 1435.

Among the porcelain manufactured during the Hsiianté period (1426
to 1435) that covered with crimson glaze or bearing designs in that
color holds the highest place in the eyes of Chinese connoisseurs. ‘ It
truly stands pre-eminent among the celebrated porcelains of different
dynasties, a precious jewel of our own times,” says Hsiang Tzt-ching.
Some of the descriptions left by this author are worth reproducing. (1)

the body and the handles, which are moulded in the form of fish, are

is said to have cost the owner 200 ingots of silver in paper notes, a sum
Dr. Bushell estimates to be equivalent to about £600.

Another style of decoration much esteemed at the time for open ves-
sels was ‘“‘three red fish on a white ground pure as driven snow, the
fish boldly outlined and red as fresh blood, of a brilliant red color daz-
zling the eyes.” Occasionally these fish would be represented on the
outside swimming on waves engraved in the paste, with two more on the
inside. Though no less than four vessels so decorated are described
by Hsiang Tzt-ching, they are stated to have been even then “precious
specimens of this rare kind of porcelain”—they are certainly so now.

A rarer kind of decoration still was three pairs of peaches in red on a
white ground—of these “ only two or three were then known to exist
within the four seas,” 7. ¢., the empire.

A still rarer decoration, found on a wine-cup, is described as “* the
white ground decorated inside and outside with cloud scrolls engraved
in the paste, a scroll border above colored.crimson: the handle a dragon
of bold design moulded in high relief coiled round the top, with teeth
and four claws fixed in the rim, enamelled vermilion red.” (Vessels
with a dragon moulded in relief upon the brim are, it may be added,
always highly esteemed by the Chinese when intact, partly because of
the artistic ability required to suecessfully execute the design, and
partly because old specimens are seldom met with undamaged.) ‘Only
one or two of these beautiful little cups remain throughout the empire,
and 100 taels ($150 gold) is not considered too much to pay for a spec-
imen.” Hsiang Tzti-ching states that the brilliancy of this crimson
glaze was obtained by the addition of powdered red gems from the
west to the ordinary materials. Dr. Bushell, commenting upon this
statement, says ‘this is impossible, and the colors being painted on
under the glaze shows it to have been a copper silicate, the same doubt-
less that gave the bright red (hsten hung) to the monochromes of the
period.* M. Julien states that among the colors for porcelain painting
brought from China by M. Itier (an employé in the minstry of finance,
who accompanied the French ambassador to that country) and pre-
sented in 1844 to the manufactory at Sevres, was one named pao-shih-
hung, ‘‘ precious stone red”, which when analyzed by M. Salvetat proved
to be merely ‘‘ oxyde de fer avee du fondant.” t

A decoration first met with in the productions of this period is
obtained by the entire excision of a delicate pattern, by some sharp
instrument, from the biscuit of which the cup or bowl is formed. When
the vessel is dipped in the glaze, the latter fills up the excised open
work with a thin film sufficiently thick after baking to retain the
liquid in the cup, though so thin that the pattern is thrown out as a
transparency upon the more opaque body. This decoration is com-
monly known among English collectors as “lace-work,” and the French
term pieces so decorated reticuleés.

414 REPORT: OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.
From 1465 ro 1487.

During the Ch‘énghua period (1465 to 1487) the production of porce-
lain bearing a blue decoration under the glaze continued, but owing
chiefly to the fact that the supply of Su-ni-po blue from abroad was
exhausted and partly from the growing preference for ornamentation
in enamel colors, this ware was inferior in color to that of the Hsiianté
period; and it is for the decoration in enamel colors that this period is
chiefly and justly famous.

One authority states that among the productions of this period are
the most beautiful of wine-cups, the upper part of which is adorned
with a Chinese peony ( Paonia moutan) and having at the base a hen and
chickens full of life and movement.* Hsiang Tztiching thus describes
@ pair:

They are of rounded form, swelling below, so thin and delicate that one weighs less
than a third of an ounce. The cockcombs, narcissus and other flowers, the flying
dragon-fly and crawling mantis, painted after life, in green, yellow, and crimson
enamel. These are choice specimens of the wine-cups of this celebrated reign, and
are valued at 100 taels (say $150) the pair, yet now even for this money it is impossi-
ble to get them.t

Another miniature wine-cup described by him is said to have been
purchased for 60 ounces of silver ($90), while a pair in the possession
of one of the high officers of the court under the Emperor Wanli is
stated by another writer to have been valued at 1,000 ounces, or $1,500.
Whatever may be thought of the last statement, the prices mentioned
by Hsiang Tztiching are fully confirmed by contemporary writers.
The Treatise on Pottery (the T‘ao-shuo) quotes from a work written
towards the end of the Ming dynasty as follows:

On the days of new moon and of full moon I often went, while at the capital,
to the fair at the Buddist temple Tz‘ti-én-sst, where rich men thronged to look at
the old porcelain bowls exhibited there. Plain white-cups of Wanli porcelain were
several ounces of silver each, those with the marks of Hsiianté and Ch‘énghua were
twice as much more, up to the tiny cups decorated with fighting cocks, which could
not be bought for less than a hundred ounces of the purest silver, pottery being
valued far more highly than precious jade.

From the time of the Emperor Wanli it was the endeavor of every
man of taste, whose wealth could support such a strain, to set wine-cups
of Ch‘énghua ware before his guests. Considering how many pieces of
this choice porcelain must have been thus sacrificed, it is not surprising
that it is almost impossible to procure specimens at the present day—
nearly three hundred years after they were selling at twelve times
their weight in gold—though Dr. Bushell states that ‘one may be
occasionally seen in a Chinese collection preserved in an ebony box
softly lined with padded silk.” Four specimens of these cups are con-
tained in the collection—Nos. 300 to 303.

From this period also are supposed to date many of the large vases
which form so prominent a feature in the European collections, dec-
orated with historical scenes, in the coloring of which green plays so
large a part, and which have in consequence been termed by French
writers “la famille verte.” They are really, however, more modern.
“The finest,” as Dr. Bushell truly remarks, ‘“‘belong to the reign of
K‘anghsi, so that one of a pair is often found with a Ming mark be-
neath, the other with a censer, flower, or other emblem (of the K‘anghsi
period); yet some connoisseurs pride themselves on being able to dis-
tinguish the genuine Ming in this class from the false, confessing,
however, that it is a difficult matter.*

This period is also noted for its egg-shell porcelain. It was not,
however, invented at this time, but, as we have already shown, first
manufactured during the Yunglo period. The four small plates of this
ware (Nos. 296 to 299) are worthy of special note, not only for their
extreme thinness and transparency, but for the very unusual style of
their decoration—landscapes in enamel colors above the glaze.

From 1488 To 1505.

During the succeeding period, Hungehih, 1488 to 1505, while enamel
colors were still used, a very pale yellow glaze of the color of a newly
husked chestnut was the tint most highly prized, the two kinds of deco-
ration being at times combined. If the uniform yellow glaze was em-
ployed, ornamentation would be at times engraved in the paste or
moulded in relief beneath it. So little is said regarding the ware of
this period by Chinese authors, that it is worth while recording the
descriptions of two choice specimens given by Hsiang Tzti-ching—
(1) a wine pot * moulded in the form of a gourd contracted in the mid-
dle, the brown stalk forming the handle of the cover, a winding branch
the tapering handle, from which spring green tendrils and leaves
and a miniature gourd, all worked in relief in the yellow body, a second
miniature gourd being fashioned into the spout. Light yellow was the
color most highly valued in this reign, but enamelling in color was also
employed, as in this piece, which reminds one of the porcelain of the
reign of Ch‘énghua;” (2) a teacup ‘in the form of a hibiscus flower,
covered outside with a delicate yellow glaze imitating the natural tint
of the flower; white inside. I have seen many specimens of Hungchih
porcelain, but nothing to surpass these little cups.” *

FRomM 1506 To 1521.

During the Chéngté period (1506 to 1521), so far as the meagre de-
tails chronicled allow us to judge, while decoration in enamel colors
continued and the successful endeavors of the governor of Yiinnan to

416 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

again turned to the production of porcelain ornamented with designs
in blue under the glaze, the ware most highly prized was that covered
with a yellow glaze, introduced under the previous reign, over patterns
engraved in the paste, and a red monochrome termed chi-hung. This
term appears to have included two shades, one the pao-shih-hung, or
‘ precious-stone red” already discussed under the Hsiianté period,
(page 412), and the hsien-hung, a bright red, produced by a silicate of
copper. This color, the Chinese records state, could not be success-
fully produced subsequent to this period under the Ming dynasty,
owing seemingly to inability to maintain a suitable condition of atmos-
phere in the kiln; a difficulty explained by M. Salvetat thus:

Si Vatmosphere du four est trop réductrice, le cuivre passe a l'état de cuivre mé-
tallique; si Vatmosphere du four est trop oxydante, la coloration rouge disparait et
la couverte devient verdatre (Recueil des travaux scientifiques de M. Ebelmen, Tome I, p.
437): le protoxyde de cuivre seul donne un silicate d’une couleur rouge.*

A curious kind of earthenware is mentioned by Hsiang Tzt-ching as
having been produced in the Yi-hsing district, of the department of
Changchou, Kiangsu province, by a celebrated potter named Kung
Ch’un. Teapots of this ware were of a light brown-like felt, or covered
with a vermiliun red glaze. In either case the color is said to have
changed to a bright green when tea was poured in, and to have gradu-
ally reverted to its original color, line by line, as the liquid was poured
out. This curious peculiarity is said to bave been merely the acci-
dental result of some change effected by baking, but was highly
prized by collectors—300 ounces of silver ($750) having been paid for
the two specimens described by our author.t

From 1522 To 1566.

During the Chiaching period (1522 to 1566) the yellow glaze, so par-
ticularly affected during the two previous reigns, appears to have been
entirely, and decoration in enamel colors to have been almost entirely,
abandoned, the old style of ornamentation in blue under the glaze
being chiefly admired, till the supply of that color from the west was
again exhausted during the later years of this reign: and to the pres-
ent day the “blue and white” of this period is much sought after by
collectors. Apart from this, the only kind of ware at all remarkable
mentioned by Chinese writers is cups intended for use upon the palace
altars, and hence termed t‘an-chan, which are said to have resembled
white jade and to have been exceptionally beautiful. One maker,
named T's‘ui, who is stated to have lived during this and the following
reign, is however mentioned as a successful imitator of the porcelain of
the Hsiianté and Ch‘énghua periods, his productions being known as
Ts‘ui kung yao tzu, “ Mr. Ts‘ui’s porcelain-ware.” ¢

FRom 1567 To 1619.

During the Lungeh‘ing (1567 to 1572) and Wanli (1573 to 1619) periods
it appears to have been difficult to obtain supplies of good clay, and
this fact, combined with the increasing disorder throughout the empire
and the enormous extent of the supplies ordered for palace use, caused
a marked deterioration in the quality of the ware produced, though the
workmanship is at times highly spoken of, especially in the case of porce-
lain decorated in enamel colors—the most highly prized having marks
on them resembling “ millet grains,” or a surface marked as with the
pittings on orange peel (Vapparance chagrinée @une peau Worange).

While, however, the productions of the government factories were
marked by an ever-increasing decadence, serious efforts were made by
private producers to stay the downward tendency, and two individuals
would seem to have won for themselves and their ware a very high rep-
utation. Chou Tan-ch‘iian, a native of Wumén, imitated the ancient
masterpieces of Tingchou porcelain so successfully, that the most expert —
connoisseurs failed, it is said, to detect the fraud, and willingly purchased
them at such enormous sums as 1,000 ounces of silver each ($1,500).
Another maker, of unknown origin, but whose name tradition says was
‘Hao Shihchiu, made cups of “ liquid-dawn tint,” bright as vermilion, and
of egg-shell of a beautiful brilliant white, and weighing in some cases only
just over half a penny weight, or about one- fortieth of an ounce, for which
extravagant prices were paid (this all sounds, however, much exagger-
ated). Other productions of his were céladon vases resembling Muan-
yao or the elder Chang’s ware (Ko-yao), except that they were not
crackled, and vases of a color which the French term /euille-morte, or
fond laque, a brown or coffee tint, derived from ferruginous clay. This
artist was known as Hu-kung, *“‘ Mr. Pots,” or Hu-yin-tao-jen, ‘ the Taoist
hidden in a pot,” apparently pseudonyms adopted by him in allusion
to an old legend preserved in the Shén-hsien-chuan, au ancient work
on Taoist immortals, and signed his jars with the mark Hu-yin-lao-jen,
‘6 the old man hidden in the pot.” According to the legend, Hu-kung,
the Old Man of the Pot, was a magician, endowed with marvellous
powers of healing, who lived during the third and fourth centuries, and
was accustomed to distribute in charity the vast sums he received in
payment for his miraculous cures. He disappeared each night from
mortal view, his retreat remaining a mystery till he was watched, when
it was discovered that the leech was accustomed to withdraw at sunset
to the interior of a hollow gourd which hung from a door-post. Julien
translated these characters as le vieillard ou qui vit dans le retraite:
but says Dr. Hirth “it seems tome that these four characters have rather
an epigrammatic sense, and if translated into Latin would be among
the most delicious of Martial’s Apophoreta; for the ‘old man,’ as the
clever maker styles himself, ‘is concealed in the pot,’ like the fairy

Hu-kung was in his, and although invisible, he himself—that is, his in-
ventive genius—is contained init. Itimpresses me as the most sympa-
thetic device a ceramic artist could select as a mark.” *

PRESENT DYNASTY, 1644 to DATE.

The factories at Chingté-chén,which had been closed during the last
years of the Ming dynasty, were not re-opened till the Manchu emper-
ors had firmly seated themselves upon the throne—during the reign of
K‘anghsi (A. D. 1662 to 1722). He and his two successors, Yungchéng
(1723 to 1735) and Chienlung (1736 to 1795), while maintaining the
qualities which had enabled their race to gain its high position, at once
adopted the civilization of the conquered nation. No less eminent as
scholars and statesmen than as able generals, loving the magnificent
but no less aiming at practical utility, they set vigorously to work to re-
form those portions of the theoretically admirable system of govern-
- ment which had been allowed to fall into decay, to improve and beautify
the capital and its palaces, to diffuse education and to encourage the
finearts. The factories at Chingté-chén were not slow to feel the effects
of this change of system. The kilns increased rapidly in number, till
at the date of P. d’Entrecolles’ letters, they aggregated over three -
hundred in full activity, the fires of which at night so illuminated the
hills surrounding the plain in which the town stands, that if seemed as
some vast city abandoned to the flames, and over a million souls found
a means of livelihood in its busy streets. The production was not char-
acterized by activity alone, however. The ablest artists were employed
to paint and to design ornamentation, to enhance the beauty of which
they at times availed themselves of foreign ideas; odes from the emperor’s
pen were reproduced upon vases in fac simile, or short extracts were in-
troduced as subjects for illustration; vases and cups were specially or-
dered to confer upon distinguished personages, their achievments being
epitomized in the paintings which decorated these precious heirlooms
(No. 169); the workmen and decorative artists were educated to a
higher level of proficiency; and the direction of the factories was con-
fided to officers who were known to be possessed of the knowledge re-
quisite for such a position. Progress was sure andrapid; and during
the seventy-five years between 1698 and 1773—comprising roughly the
latter half of K‘anghsi’s reign, the whole of Yungchéng’s and rather
more than half that of Chienlung—the manufacture and decoration of
porcelain in China attained a degree of excellence which in my opinion
has never been reached either before or since.

During the early part of K‘anghsi’s reign (1662 to 1722) green was,
as it had been among the later productions of the Ming dynasty—dur-
ing the Lunching and Wanli periods of 1567 to 1619—the predominating
color employed in decoration, such porcelain being hence termed la

THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. - 419

famille verte; and to this period belongs, in part, much of the ware
so decorated, which is usually ascribed to the earlier dynasty and is
considered a characteristic Ming porcelain. To the colors applied
under the glaze was now added a blue above glaze, which does not
seem to have been known under the Mings. During the later years of
this reign, however, green gave way to red as the predominating
color, and a style of decoration was adopted which has been classed by
M. Jacquemart and subsequent writers under the title of la famille rose.
It is easily distinguished by its half tints and broken colors, having
for decorative basis a carmine red lowered to pale rose, and obtained
from gold, which is called in Europe purple of Cassius. The addition
to their palette of this color, of yellow derived from autimony and of
white from arsenical acid, enabled Chinese artists to considerably in-
crease the variety and beauty of their decorations. A director of the
government factories named Ts‘ang Ying-hsiian, is mentioned by
Chinese writers as having about this time gained considerable dis-
tinction by his productions, which were of thin porcelain, covered with
a brilliant, and, in the most highly valued specimens monochrome, glaze.
The colors are stated to have been “snake-skin green,” “mud-eel
yellow,” blue, and dappled yellow. Other, but less esteemed, colors
were pale yellow, pale violet, pale green, and blue or red, both soufflé.

FRoM 1723 To 1796.

Shortly after the accession of Yungchéng, Nien Hsi-yao was, in 1727,
entrusted with the direction of the imperial manufactories. He per-
sonally selected the materials and superintended the execution of the
emperor’s orders. Ali the articles made by him—which are known as
Nien porcelain, nien yao, were graceful in form and of fine workman-
ship. They were chiefly monochrome in color, blue, bright and carmine
reds, céladons, and “of egg-color as bright as silver,” but some were
ornamented with painted flowers, either incised or plain. Some of the
monochrome vases, dating from this or a slightly later period, have
lately obtained an extraordinary vogue among the foreign collectors,
and bring prices ridiculously above any value to which they could
justly lay claim on the score of either rarity, color or workmanship.
A small vase only 8 inches high, of a dull white-pink shade upon an
underground of pale sea-green, which has been dignified by the name
of “‘peach-blow” (in some specimens this underground forces itself into
notice in the form of splotches on the pink), was offered to the writer
in Peking for less than $200 gold, and, having been purchased by a
foreign dealer, was eventually sold in New York for $15,000. With
Nien Hsi-yao was associated in the management a year later a Man-
chu officer in the lord chamberlain’s office named T‘angying, who
fifteen years later succeeded to the sole direction. Possessing an inti-
mate knowledge of the different varieties of clay and of the effects of the
fire upon them and on colors, he exercised the greatest care in the
420 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

choice of materials, and every article made under his orders was re-
markable for delicacy of workmanship, purity of form, and brilliance
of coloring. He imitated with wonderful precision the most beautiful
of the ancient designs, and his efforts at reproducing the most cele-
brated glazes were crowned with equal success. In addition he is
credited with the invention of several new styles of decoration, of which
the most remarkable were: The use of European blues and violets, a
ground of enamel black, white flowers or designs in gold upon a black
ground, the French method of painting, and the yao-pien or flambé
style. In a word, “under his direction,” Chinese writers state, ‘the
products of the imperial factories attained their highest perfection.*

The work translated by M. Julien distinctly states that the introduc-
tion of the black grounds dates from the early part of Chienlung’s
reign. Treating, as this work does, of events of such comparatively
recent occurrence, its reliability would at first glance seem scarcely open
to doubt. I am, however, strongly of opinion that the statement is
erroneous, and that black grounds originated some decades earlier. I
have seen specimens which, the black ground apart, have all the char-
acteristics of the K‘anghsi period, and far inferior in delicacy of execu-
tion to specimens which were undoubtedly manufactured under the
direction of T‘angying, such as No. 93 of this collection. The accuracy
of the statement in other respects is, however, confirmed by experience.
The use of violet, or of magenta with a violet tone, with most happy
effect, especiaily for grounds, is one of the characteristics of this period,
while the best blues fully equal anything in that color produced during
the best periods of the Mings.

Special attention, as has been seen, was also paid at this time to the
production of yao-pien, of which Chinese writers distinguish three kinds,
two due to celestial agency; one, the flambé glaze, to human ingenuity.
As regards the latter, oxydulated copper, it is well known, furnishes
vitrifiable painting with a fine red. This, thrown in a body on a vase,
forms the tint called haricot, a kind of fawn color; with a further quan-
tity of oxygen of equal amount a protoxyde is formed, producing a
beautiful green, that may be changed into sky-blue by increasing the
oxygenation. ‘The tints upen a vase may thus be modified almost indef-
initely by a due regulation at different periods during the process of
baking of the currents of air admitted. ‘‘ When aclear fire placed ina
strong current draws a considerable column of air, all the oxygen is not
consumed, and part of it combines with the metal; if, on the other hand,
thick smoke is introduced into the furnace, of which the carbonaceous
mass, greedy of oxygen, absorbs everywhere this gas, necessary for
its combustion, the oxydes will be destroyed and the metal completely
restored. Placed at a given moment in these given conditions, by the
rapid and simultaneous introduction of currents of air and of sooty
vapors the haricot glaze assumes a most picturesque appearance; the

whole surface of the piece becomes diapered with veins and streaked
colorations, changing and capricious as the flame of spirits, the red
oxydulate, passing by violet into paie blue and to the green protoxyde,
evaporates itself even completely upon certain projections, which
become white, and thus furnishes happy accidental combinations.*
The supernatural changes are either of color, as when a piece of porce-
lain is taken from the kiln having developed a patch of some new color
ina natural shape, or of form, ‘‘as when some unusually large slabs
were requisitioned by one of the Ming emperors, which were trans-
formed into beds and boats, with equipage complete, and forthwith
broken up by the startled potters, as gravely reported by the official
in charge by way of excuse for their absence.”+ In the Buddhist tem-
ple Pao-kuo-sstt in Peking is a famous yao-pien image of Yuanyin, a
finely designed figure enamelled in colors, light blue, crimson, yellow,
and two shades of brown; of which, from an ode from his pen engraved
on the shrine, the Emperor Chienlung says the goddess descended into
the kiln to fashion an exact likeness of herself.
The reference to the introduction to *“‘ the French method of painting”
is of so interesting a nature as to merit more detailed consideration.
The Jesuit missionaries of the seventeenth century gained for them-
selves a position of dignity and influence beside the Dragon throne such
as no foreigner before or since has succeeded in attaining. This position,
and a tolerance which saw nothing incompatible with the Catholic re-
ligion in the cherished observance of the Chinese—in the payment of
official honors to the sage Confucius and in the worship of ancestors—
caused a remarkable spread of Catholicism, which, owing to the labors
of Father Ricci and his successors, had already established itself under
the Ming dynasty, counting among its members many officials and the
consort of the last of the line, who proclaimed himself emperor in the
Kwangtung (Canton) province. But Pope Clement XV’s bull Ex illa
die, confirming an earlier bull on the same subject dated the 4th Novem-
ber, 1704, by deciding that these observances were incompatible with
Catholic beiief, aroused violent anger on the part of the Emperor
K’anghsi and dealt a blow to the missions from which they have never
recovered. The emperor died before the legate especially sent to China
to carry out the bull could perform his promise to endeavor to persuade
the Pope to modify its terms ; and decrees of great severity were issued
against Christianity by his successors, Youngchéng and Chienlung, to
which Pope Benedict XIV replied in 1742, by issuing a bull deciding this
unfortunate question in its narrowest sense. The severity of the im-
perial decree was, however, mitigated in favor of the missionaries at
court—at first Jesuits, and after the dissolution of that order Lazarists ;
and a European religieuse continued to be a director of the board of
astronomy down to 1814.

422 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The high position gained by the Jesuits was both won and maintained
chiefly by their high attainments in astronomy, in mathematics and in
geometry. It, however, enabled these able and enlightened representa-
tives of western learning to exercise a considerable degree of influence
upon other matters not directly connected with the studies for which they
were chiefly famous, but in which their scientific education gave them
the power and right to speak with authority. When, therefore, contem-
poraneously with the enjoyment by them of this position of influence, a
style of decoration was adopted for porcelain and enamels for both im-
perial and general use purely European in its character—not only in the
more intimate acquaintance, as compared with previous native drawing,
of the laws of perspective displayed, but even to the reproduction of
European dress and figures and eminently European scenes and pas-
times—it seemed that this could scarcely be mere coincidence. It was
more natural to suppose that under the direction of one of these able mis-
sionaries a school had been established in connection with the govern-
ment porcelain factories for instruction in European designs, in Euro-
pean ideas of grouping floral ornamentation and in the European style
of painting generally. Pére d’Entrecolles, it is true, makes no allu-
sion in his famous letters to such a school. But, as they were written
for the purpose of enlightening the west regarding the composition of
the materials and the system of manufacture employed by the Chinese,
the use of Kuropean designs in the decoration of porcelain might well
have been passed over in silence, and the absence of such reference
would not necessarily prove that such a school had not existed.

The supposition that some of the Jesuits were at this time more or less
intimately associated with the manufacture and decoration of porcelain
was supported by the belief, which is still current among Chinese ex-
_perts, that the secret of the composition of the sang-de-beuf coloring
and of its peculiar glaze marked with pittings resembling those notice-
able on orange peel (specimens of which are now so highly prized by
collectors) was discovered by a missionary, and that its Chinese desig-
nation (Lang-yao or Lang ware) preserves to the present day the first
syllable of the inventor’s surname.* Researches kindly undertaken at
my request by Abbé Alphonse Favier, the vicar-general of Chibli pro-
vince, into the ancient episcopal records and valuable library at Peking
have, however, failed to discover any mention of the establishment
under missionary direction of a school for the special purpose of por-
celain decoration. Had it existed, the fact would undoubtedly have been

* How much, or if any, eredence should be attached to this statement is doubtful.
This is the only explanation I have heard given of the Chinese name of this porcelain.
On the other hand, I can find among the list of missionaries of that time no sur-
name commencing with any syllable at all like Lang. In China omne ignotum pro
magnifico is especially true; and, as in the case of the beautiful red coloring of the
Hsiianté period, so in the sang-de-bwuf, the brilliant tint is commonly believed to re-
sult from the use of powdered rubies.
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. 423

chronicled in the records left by such careful and methodical workers
as these Jesuits priests were; and the explanation which the existence of
such a school would have afforded must therefore be abandoned. Abbé
Favier, however, informs me that FF. Castiglione and Attirer were noted
painters at Peking both of portraits and of landscapes, and that they
formed aschool, paintings by their pupils having come into his posses-
sion. It may then, I think, be confidently assumed that the imperial
family having in the first instance been struck with the beauty of the
ornamentation on the enamel watches, snuff-boxes, etc., which came to
China from France during the reign of Louis XIV, a somewhat similar
style of decoration was introduced about 1728, or shortly after, for ar-
ticles intended for imperial use; and that subsequently the Jesuit
brothers, Castiglione and Attirer were commissioned to execute Euro-
pean designs, which were sent to Chingté-chén, to be there copied on
porcelain. As no article which was not pertect in every detail could
be forwarded to Peking, many of the pieces ordered for the court
would then (as now) be rejected by the superintendent of the manu-
factory, and be retained by him or his subordinates. These would
gradually pass into other hands, and possessing at once the charm of
novelty and the merit of being in a style appreciated at court, would
serve as models in the decoration of more ordinary ware.

About the same period, that is, during the later years of Yungchéng’s
reign, which ended in 1735, Ku Yiich-hsiian, a subordinate officer, I
believe, in the directorate of the Chingté-chén factories, introduced the
use of an opaque-white vitreous ware for the manufacture of articles
of small dimensions, such as snuff-bottles, wine-cups, vessels for wash-
ing pencils in, ete. The vitreous nature of the body imparted a tone
and brilliancy to the colors used in the decoration which was greatly
admired ; and, under the auspices of T‘angying, all the artistic and
technical skill of the government factory was lavished upon these lit-
tle gems, which are certainly among the masterpieces, if not the mas-
terpieces, of ceramic art in China, being valued more highly than jade
by Chinese connoisseurs of the present day. The decoration of the
best specimens of this ware will well repay minute study. The choice of
groundwork is effective, the grouping of the colors soft and harmoni-
ous, the introduction of Kuropean figures is interesting, and the ar-
_rangement of flowers evidences the highest artistic skill. Nos. 324 to
327 are admirable specimens of this very rare ware. The earliest pieces
were marked, usually in red, ta-ch‘ing-nien-chih, “ Made during the great
Pure (the Ch‘ing or present) dynasty, ” as in No. 323; the later pieces,
during Chienlung’s reign (1736 to 1795), had the mark within a square
seal-like border, Chien-lung nien-chih “ Made during the reign of Chien-
lung,” engraved in the foot, and filled with a thick, bright-blue enamel
glaze. It is said that when specimens of this ware were submitted to
the Emperor Yungchéng he expressed his high admiration of their
beauty, but at the same time a regret that it should not be possible to
424 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

obtain the same brilliant transparency of color upon the ground of
greater purity which was afforded by the best porcelain as compared
with the vitreous composition employed. ‘T‘angying’s energies were
immediately devoted towards fulfilling the emperor’s desire, his efforts
being certainly crowned with a very large measure of success. He
appears to have employed for his purpose a very pure glaze of a highly
vitrifiable nature, and to have thereby obtained an enamel brilliancy
that no other porcelain shows, and to have also secured to a considera-
ble extent the same soft transparency in the decorative colors which
was so much appreciated on Ku Yiich-hstian vitreous ware. The man-
ufacture of this porcelain appears to have been carried on simultane-
ously with that of the Ku Yiich-hstian proper, some dating from Yung-
chéng’s reign and some from Chieniung’s. The marks it bears corre-
spond exactly with the later products of vitreous composition, and
indeed, owing to its origin, itis known as fang-ku-yuch-hsuan, “modelled
on the pattern of the Ku Yiich-hstian.” Specimens of this porcelain,
which is quite rare, are held in very high esteem by the Chinese, alike
for the purity of the paste, the brilliance of the glaze and the beauty
ot the decoration, and are considered among the first productions of
the period during which the manufacture attained its highest excel-
lence. Nos. 328 to 336 are good specimens, and afford a fair criterion of
the merits of this porcelain.

The three-quarters of a century above mentioned (1698 to 1773) was
marked by the production of articles which are masterpieces of Chinese
ingenuity and of skilful workmanship. Vases of various forms are
fitted with a central ring, which, while it is separate from the vase and
movable at will in a horizontal direction, still cannot be detached.
Other vases there are having the body formed of two shells, the outer
portion consisting in part of a geometric design or of bunches of flow-
ers in open-work, revealing a historical representation, or a grou) of
flowering plants beautifully painted upon the inner tube. Others
again exhibit the peculiarities of both these varieties combined, it
being possible to make the open-work exterior revolve, in order. to —
bring to light the painted decoration within, but without possibility of
separating it from the vase itself. There are still others of which the
exterior shell is divided into two, generally unequal, parts, each hav-
ing scallopped or lambrequin edges some inches in depth, which fit ex-
actly into one another but are still movable, though neither can be
detached entirely from the internal body. What process was adopted
to secure this mobility and prevent the movable section from becoming
attached to the other portions of the vase in the process of baking is
a mystery which has never as yet, I believe, been satisfactorily ex-
plained. The beautiful hexagonal and octagonal lamp-shades of deli-
cately thin porcelain either reticulated or ornamented with paintings
and reticulated edges are productions of this period equally admired
and now no less rare than the above.
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. 425

During Chienlung’s reign a considerable change is noticeable in the
style of ornamentation—a change undoubtedly brought about by the
influence of foreign designs. During the latter portion of the Ming
dynasty, though arabesque decoration was known to the Chinese under
the title of huei-huei, or Mohammedan style, and was also utilized, tbe
ornamentation upon porcelain, when it was not floral in its character or
formed of historical or mythological scenes, consisted almost entirely of
reproductions of the patterns found upon the brecaded satins of that
date. Under the earlier emperors of the present dynasty, though the
decoration was marked by greater wealth of detail and by far greater
artistic skill than at any previous time, it remained in essential charac-
ter the same. On Chienlung porcelain, however, it exhibits a decided
tendency towards the styles of western decoration, showing in some
cases a close resemblance to the foliate ornamentation which plays so
important a part in the illumination of medieval missals, in others to
designs which are usually considered Persian or arabesque in their
origin. This marked modification is no doubt due in part to the in-
fluence of the designs sent from Persia to be copied in China on por-
celain ordered from that country, and after their return home to that of
the Chinese potters (whom Shah Abbas I, about the year 1600, had in-
vited to Persia, with the object of improving the manufacture of porcelain
at Ispahan), and in part to the influence of the Limoges enamels which
had been sent by Louis XIV to the Emperor K‘anghsi and which, sub-
sequent to that date, succeeding emperors had obtained from the Jesuit
missionaries. These enamelsseem indeed to have served as models to be
reproduced with fidelity in every detail. For M. du Sartel gives the
drawing of a low, open porcelain cup with two handles in the collection
of M. Marquis of Paris, which is described as being the exact counter-
part of a Limoges enamel, even the signature J. L. (Jean Landrin, an
enameller of that town) being reproduced upon the foot.

At about the same period it became customary for nobles and wealthy
individuals in Europe to order services of porcelain from China bearing
their family arms. Indeed if tradition can be trusted the practice
originated two centuries earlier; for the Emperor Charles V (1519 to
1555) is said to have ordered from China a complete service orna-
mented with his armorial bearings and monogram. ‘The service is sup-
posed to have passed into the hands of the Elector of Saxony after the
emperor’s withdrawal to Innspruck, and some plates now in the Dres-
den collection, marked with a double C, enclosing the crowned double-
headed imperial eagle, with coat of arms and collar of the Order of the
Golden Fleece, are believed by the writers responsible for the above
statement to be portions of this service. Judging, however, from the
style of decoration, I am of opinion that this belief is erroneous, and that
the plates in question were manufactured more than a century later
than Charles V.’s abdication. The French Compagnie d’ Orient et des
Indes Orientales, whose title was shortly afterwards changed to Com-

pagniede Chine, during the short period it existed, 1685 to 1719, brought”
from China, together with an extensive supply of other porcelains,
services specially ordered, bearing the arms of France, of Penthiévre,
and of other distinguished families. Some of the services, ¢. g., the
plates bearing the arms of England, France and the provinces of The
Netherlands, preserved in the Huis ten Bosch at the Hague, undoubt-
edly date from the first half of K‘anghsi’s reign, but the great majority
are of later origin, and possess a considerable degree of excellence both
as to form and decoration.

From 1796 To 1820.

The truly great monarchs K‘anghsi, Yungchéng and Chienlung *
were succeeded by Chiach‘ing (1796 to 1820), Chienlung’s idle and
dissolute son, whose administration was characterized by a feeble-
ness hitherto unknown under Manchu rule, and was so detested
as to occasion attempts to assassinate the vicegerent of Heaven—a
stupendous crime in such a country as China. The porcelain factories,
in common with all branches of the government service, languished un-
der the effects of this want of energy, and little worthy of special mention
was manufactured. As the result of the high excellence already at-
tained, good work continued to be performed, but it fell short of what
the court had grown accustomed to, and no initiative was taken to
attempt originality either in design or decoration.

From 1821 To 1850.

Chiach‘ing was succeeded by his second son, who assumed the title of
Taokuang (1821 to 1850), a ruler whose good intentions to root out the
abuses which had grown up during his father’s reign were largely
neutralized by naturalindolence. His difficulties were, besides, greatly
increased by the war with France and England, and the outbreak
shortly after of the great T‘aip‘ing rebellion, which during his reign
and that of his son (Hsienféng, 1851 to 1861) devastated sixteen out of
the eighteen provinces of the Chinese Empire, and threatened the over-
throw of his dynasty. Notwithstanding these serious causes for anx-
iety, he found time to devote some attention to the ceramic art, and the
porcelain manufactured for his own use, and marked with the designa-
tion he gave to his own palace, Shen-té-t‘ang, compares not unfavorably
with similar productions under Yungchéng and Chienlung, and is at
the present day much sought after by Chinese connoisseurs.

From 1850 To 1888.

The productions of his successor are marked by rapid decadence, and
the rebels, when they overran Kiangsi province, having entirely

ing the throne for so long a period as he had reigned.

destroyed Chingté-chén and its factories, the manufacture of porcelain
ceased entirely.

During the reigns of his son T‘ungchih (1862 to 1874) and nephew
Kuanghsii (1875 to date) the manufacture has been renewed and great
attention paid to its improvement, but it still falls far short of the
classic periods of Yungchéng and of Chienlung. Some of the decora.
tions in sepia exhibit considerable artistic merit, and a style of decora-
tion consisting of flowers and butterflies in black and white upon a pale
turquoise ground was highly appreciated some fifteen years ago among
foreigners. The greatest measure of success has, however, of late
years been gained in the reproduction of the famille verte decoration of
the first half of K‘anghsi’s reign, and of this ornamentation or of plum-
blossom on black grounds. So good are these imitations that a prac-
tised eye can alone detect the false from the real, and I have known a
pair of black-ground vases, only two or three years old, purchased by a
foreign dealer for over $1,000, under the belief, no doubt, that they
dated from the time of K‘anghsi or of Chienlung.

INTRODUCTION OF CHINESE PORCELAIN INTO EUROPE.

M. Brongniart stated that porcelain was first introduced into Europe -
by the Portuguese in 1518. Researches made since the publication of
this work in 1844 prove, however, that oriental porcelain was known in
Europe many years prior to that date. In New College, Oxford, is
still preserved a céladon bowl mounted in silver richly worked, known
as “Archbishop Warham’s cup” and bequeathed by that prelate (1504
to 1532) to the college, which was imported into England before the
reign of Henry VIII. Marryat, in his history of Porcelain, also men-
tions some bowls which were given to Sir Thomas Trenchard by Philip
of Austria when, after leaving England to assume the throne of Castile
in 1505, he was driven back by a storm to Weymouth and entertained
there by Sir Thomas. ‘These bowls are said to have been preserved by
the Trenchards, and to be of white porcelain decorated with blue under
glaze. From M. du sartel’s work we learn that amongst presents sent
by the Sultan to Lorenzo de Medici in 1487 were porcelain vases; and that
this ware is mentioned about the same time in the maritime laws of
Barcelona as one of the articles imported from Egypt. In letters, too,
addressed by the Venetian ambassador at the court of Teheran in 1471
to his government frequent mention is made of porcelain; and some
decades earlier, in 1440, the Sultan of Babylonia sent three bowls and
a dish of Chinese porcelain (de porcelaine de Sinant),* to Charles VII,
King of France, by the hands of a certain Jean de Village, the agent
in that country of a French merchant named Jacques Coeur.

Nearly three centuries earlier still, mention is made in an Arabian
MS., known as the Makrizi MS., in the National Library, Paris, and

“Du Sartel: ‘ Histoire de la Porcelaine Chinoise, ” p. 23.
428 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

translated by the Abbé Renaudot, of a service of china-ware, consisting
of forty pieces of different kinds, sent with other presents to Nur-ed-
din, the Kaliph of Syria, by his lieutenant, Saladin (afterwards the hero
of the Crusades), soon after his conquest of Syria, in the year of the
Hegira 567 (A. D. 1188). “This,” says Mr. A. W. Franks in the cata-
logue of his own collection, now in the British Museum, ‘is the first
distinet mention of porcelain out of China”; but, in common with other
writers on the subject, he refers the date of the present to 1171,
though that year appears not to correspond with the Mohammedan
date mentioned in the original text.

From Chinese sources (the Ming-shih, or History of the Ming Dynasty,
and the Hsi-yang-ch‘ao-kung-tien-lu, or Records of Tribute Missions
from the West), we learn that the famous eunuch Chéngho carried
Chinese arms as far as Ceylon during the reign of Yunglo (1403 to
1425); that under his successor in 1430 the same eunuch and an asso-
ciate envoy, Wang Ching-hung, were sent on a mission to Hormuz and
sixteen other countries, and that Chéngho dispatched some of his sub-
ordinates on commercial ventures to Calicut, on the coast of Malabar,
and even as far west as Djiddah, the port of Mecca. ‘ Hn 1431 ou
1432,” says Heyd,* ‘on y vit méme arriver plusieurs jonques chinoises
qui n’avaient pas trouvé 4 écouler leurs marchandises 4 Aden dans de
bonnes conditions. On les y regut avec empressement dans Vespoir que
leur visite serait le début d’un traffic avec la Chine.” The expedition
was evidently a large one, and one of its objects was commercial in-
tercourse, porcelain being specially mentioned among the articles with
which the vessels were freighted. Porcelain had, however, reached
these countries at a far earlier date. Marco Polo, traveling in 1280,
mentions the trade in this ware from Quinsai, the present Hangehou,
and from Zaitun, a port on the Fukien coast, which has been identified
with Ch‘iianchou (better known as Chinchew) by Klaproth and other
writers, whose view has been adopted by Colonel Yule in his magnifi-
cent edition of that famous traveler’s voyages, and with Changchou
and its port, Geh-Kong (a short distance south from Chinchew, and
inland), by Mr. George Philips, of Her British Majesty’s consular service
in China. And Ibn Batuta, an Arabian traveler, who wrote in 1310,
states distinctly that ‘‘ Porcelain in China is worth no more than pot-
tery is with us; it is exported to India and other countries, from which
it is carried even to our own land Maghreb,” i. e., the sunset, the name
given by the Arabs to all that part of Africa which lies to the west of
Egypt.

ROUTE FOLLOWED.

Chinese history fully confirms the above statement, and, indeed, shows
that this commerce had already long existed at the time Ibn Batuta

moire sur l’Kgypte” (Vol. 1, p. 291).

wrote. In a gigantic compilation of the works of earlier authors under-
taken during the reign of Yunglo (hence termed the Yung-lo-ta-tien),
the MS. of which was presented to the throne in 1407, is preserved “an
account of the countries fringing the Chinese border” (Chu-fan-chih), writ-
ten by Chao Ju-kua, who was inspector of foreign trade in Fakien during
the Sung dynasty. As the author speaks of the time of Mohammed
‘Cas twenty-nine generations, or six or seven hundred years ago,” his
work would seem to have been written during the first halfof the thir-
teenth century; but as he mentions a tribute mission sent by the Arabs
to China in the K‘aihsi period (1205 to 1208), probably later than the lat-
terdate. The compilation was, however, considered too extensive and the
printing was never completed, though the more important works relat-
ing to periods preceding the Yiian dynasty were re-edited and published
by the Emperor Chienlung. One of these was Chao Ju-kua’s work. It
contains much valuable information regarding the Arab trade of the
twelfth century, and, as it takes Chii‘anchou (Chinchew) as the starting-
point from which all voyages start and distances are computed, it ap-
pears to support Klaproth’s identification of Marco Polo’s Zaitun with
that town. From this work it is evident that a large and valuable
trade was carried on between China and Brni in Borneo, with Chanch‘éng,
comprising a portion of Cochin China, with Cambodja (Chénla), with
Java (Shé-po), with San-po-ch't, which another Chinese work, the Ying-
hai-shéng-lan, states to be another name of Palembang (Po-lin-pang)
in Sumatra—at which latter place the products of China and coun-
tries south of it were stored up for barter with Arab traders for the
goods of Europe, India, West Asia, and Africa—and with Lambri, on
the northwest coast of the same island. Occasionally Chinchew junks
proceeded onward to Coilom, a well-known sea-port (the present Quilon)
on the coast of Malabar, which is described under the name of Lampi;
but as a rule it would seem that the trade westward was in the hands
of the Arabs, and Chao Ju-kua mentions, indeed, incidentally that a
family from Malabar was established in the southern suburb of Chin-
chew itself. From this point the goods were carried to Guzerat (‘Hu-
ch‘a-la), as part of the country of Lampi, and thence to the Arab colony
in Zanzibar (ts‘éngpa, Cantonese ts‘ang pat-ts‘ang par). Porcelain is dis-
tinctly mentioned among the principal articles carried away from China
by the vessels to each of these ports and to Ceylon.* The correctness
of this author’s statements has lately been confirmed in a striking man-
ner. Sir John Kirk, during his residence in Zanzibar as consul-general,
formed a collection of ancient Chinese céladon porcelain, some of the
specimens having been dug up from ruins, mixed with Chinese coins of
the Sung dynasty.

Indeed it seems very probable that porcelain was sent at least as far
west as India in the tenth century, or even earlier; for commercial rela-

430 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

tions between China and Sumatra are stated to have existed from the
Tienvu period (904 to 909) of the T’ang dynasty, and the name Sar-
baza, which has been identified with San-fo ch’i (above mentioned) or
Palembang, was known to Arab traders of that time, as we learn
from translations of their travels by Renaudot and Reinaud. They
were also acquainted with Chinese porcelain, for mention is made by
one of them, Soleyman by name, who visited China towards the middle
of the ninth century, ‘of a very fine clay in that country, of which
vases are made having the transparence uf giass; water can be seen
through them.”* Indeed earlier, during the eighth century, Arab writ-
ers mention the presence in the Persian Gulf of fleets of large Chinese
junks.

At this date the Arab trade with China was evidently very exten-
sive, and the colonies of Arabs at Canton and at Canfu, the port of —
Quinsai (the present Hangchow), very large. They are said to have
been so numerous at the tormer place in the eighth century as to
have been able to attack and pillage the city. While at Canfu the
Soliman above referred to (the manuscript account of whose travels
was written, says his commentator, Abu Zaid Al Hasan, in A. D. 851)
mentions the fact that ‘‘a Mohammedan held the position of judge over
those of his religion, by the authority of the Emperor of China, who is
judge of all the Mohammedans who resort to those parts. Upon festival
days he performs the public service with the Mohammedans, and pro-
nounces the sermon or kotbat, which he concludes in the usual form,
with prayers for the Sultan of Moslems. The merchants of Irak—i. e.,
Persia—who trade thither are no way dissatisfied with his conduct or
administration in this port, because his decisions are just and equitable
and conformable to the Koran.” And the commentator on these travels,
Abu Zaid Al Hasan, who probably wrote early in the tenth century,
when speaking of the interruption then recently caused in “ the ordi-
nary navigation from Siraf to China,” states this to have been occa-
sioned by the revolt of ‘‘an officer who was considerable for his em-
ployment, though not of royal family,” named Baichu. He laid siege
to Canfu in the year of the Hegira 264 (A. D. 885). “At last he be-
came master of the city, and put all the inhabitants to the sword.
There are persons fully acquainted with the affairs of China, who as-
sure us that, besides the Chinese who were massacred on this occasion,
there perished 120,000 Mohammedans, Jews, Christians, and Parsees,
who were there on account of traffic. The number of the professors
of these four religions who thus perished is exactly known, because the
Chinese are exceeding nice in the accounts they keep of them.”t

Apart, however, from this sea route, porcelain might possibly have
followed the course of the everland traffic through Central Asia, the
use of which can be traced back to a very remote antiquity, some au-

thorities claiming that there are indications of communication by this
route between China and the West so early as 2698 B. C., and that in
2353 B. C. an embassy arrived in China from a country which is sup-
posed to have been Chaldea.* ‘There is, therefore, nothing impossible
in the claim put forward that a small ivory-white plate having uncut
emeralds and rubies, set in gold filigree, let into paste, and the Chinese
word fu (happiness) marked on the foot in the seal character under the
glaze, now in the royal collection at Dresden, was brought into Hurope
by a crusader in the twelfth century; provided, of course, the paste,
glaze, ete., correspond with those which characterize the porcelain
manufactured in China about that date or prior to it.

KIND OF PORCELAIN CARRIED WESTWARD.

What then was the porcelain that participated in this early trade?
Chao Ju-kua, in the single instance in which he alludes to its color,
states it to have been “ white and ching, or céladon.” It would almost
necessarily have consisted of strong, coarse ware, in order to resist the
chances of breakage consequent upon the many transshipments inci-
dental to these long voyages in the rude craft of those early ages, and
to allow its sale at the comparatively cheap rates at which it was dis-
posed of in Ibn Batuta’s day. Colonel Yule has thought that during
the Yiian dynasty it prebably came from the Chingté-chén manufac-
tories, but this scarcely seems probable, for the Z’ao-shuo, or ‘‘ Treatise -
on Pottery,” states that no porcelain was then made there, except by
imperial order and for the court. Zaitun—whether Chinchew. Chang-
chou, or “the Amoy waters” (Dr. Douglas’ compromise between the
two—as the headquarters of the western trade, would naturally re-
ceive supplies for export of Kuan-yao and of Ko-yao (both céladon in
color) from the not far distant factories at Hangchow and Lungch’iian
respectively, as well as from the more distant factories, most of the
productions of which were at this time also céladons. And céladon
porcelains bearing all the distinctive characteristics of the Chinese
manufactures of that nature have been discovered in almost all parts
of the then Mohammedan world and in the countries visited by the
early Arab traders.

Mr. Carl Bock, speaking in his ‘“‘ Head Hunters of Borneo” of he
Dyak, says:

Amung his greatest treasures are a series of gudji blanga, a sort of glazed jar im-
ported from China, in green, blue, or brown, ornamented with figures of lizards and
serpents in relief. These pots are valued at from i00 florins to as much as 3,000 flor-
ins (£8 to £240) each, according to size, pattern, and, above all, old age, combined
with good condition. According to the native legend, these precious vases are made

of the remnants of the same clay from which Mahatara (the Almighty) made first the
sun and then the moon. Medicinal virtues are attributed to these urns, and they are

regarded as affording complete protection from evil spirits to the house in which they
are stored. A very full account of the various legends connected with these gudji
blanga is given in Mr. W. T. H. Perelace’s most interesting work Lthnographische
Beschrijving der Dyaks, pp. 112-120.”

Mr. Bock saw Dr. Hirth’s collection of Lungch‘iian céladons, and
found in it pieces resembling the ware preserved by the Dyaks, but
specimens are, it appears, common among them which bear no resem-
blance to any of the celebrated monochrome wares of the Sung and
Yiian dynasties, a fact Dr. Hirth would explain by supposing that
“they came from factories equally old, but less renowned, such as the
place where the Chien-yao of the Sung dynasty was made, the city of
Chien-yang in the north of Fukien, which is all the more likely since
Chao Ju-kua, in his description of the trade with Borneo, specially men-
tions ‘ brocades of Chien-yang’ among the articles of import there.”+

A controversy has, however, recently arisen as to whether the céla-
don vases found throughout the Mohammedan world are really of Chi-
nese origin at all. Professor Karabacek, an Arabic scholar of Vienna,
maintains that the “large, heavy, thick, green céladon dishes with the
well-known ferruginous ring on the bottom, which have been found
spread over all the countries of Arab civilization,” are not of Chinese
origin, basing his theory mainly on the statement made by Hadschi
Chalfa, an encyclopedist who died in 1658, that * the precious, magnifi-
cent céladon dishes and other vessels seen in his time were manufact-
ured and exported at Martaban, in Pegu.” The Arab designation
Martabani is applied by Professor Karabacek to the thick, heavy céla-
dons. It would, however, appear to have been also applied to a variety
of entirely different character.

Jacquemart, in his “‘ History of the Ceramic Art, ” quotes Chardin’s
“ Voyages en Perse” as follows: “ Everything at the King’s table is of
massive gold or porcelain. There is a kind of green porcelain so pre-
cious that one dish alone is worth 400 crowns. They say this porcelain
detects poison by changing color, but that is a fable; its price arises
from its beauty and the delicacy of the material, which renders it trans-

* The possession of these vessels by the Dyaks, their use and value, are also chron-
icled by earlier travelers. The belief in the efficacy of porcelain vessels to detect
poison in liquids contained in them is of ancient date and not confined to Asia alone,
though the manner in which the porcelain was affected by the presence of poison
appears to have varied in different cases. Thus, Guido Pancirolli, the learned juris-
consult and antiquary of Padua (d. 1599), and his editor, Salmutti (‘‘Guidonis Pan-
cirolli, J. C., claris. rerum memorabilium libri duo; ex Italies Latiné redditi et eotis
illustrati ab Henrico Salmutti,” Antwerp, 1612) state that the presence of poison
caused the porcelain either to break or to change color; while Dumont, in his ‘‘ Trav-
els in Turkey,” 1699, states that it caused the liquid to effervesce in the center while
it remained cool near the vessel itself, the Turks, owing to this property, preferring
porcelain to silver as the material of dinner services, Salmutti mentions the presen-
tation to himself of one of these vessels by an Austrian prince, and Paul Hentzner
(‘‘Itnerarium Galliz, Angliz, Italie,” 1616) says he saw some of them in the Farnese
Palace at Rome.

parent although above two crowns in thickness,” and then adds: “This
last peculiarity has a great importance. It is impossible to suppose
travelers would here allude to the sea-green céladon—this, laid upon a
brown, close paste approaching stoneware, is never translucent. In the
martabani, on the contrary, a thin, bright, green glaze is applied upon

Its name leaves no doubt of its Persian nationality. Martaban (Mo-ta-
ma) is one of the sixteen states which composed the ancient kingdom
of Siam; it would not be impossible, then, that we must restore to this
kingdom the porcelain mentioned in the Arabian story.”

No porcelain, however, is known to have been made at Moulmien
(Martaban), Bangkok, or Burma, and the burden of evidence is strongly
against Professor Karabacek’s contention of a non-Chinese origin for
the martabani or céladon porcelain. Probably the designation marta-
bani was applied to this ware in much the same manner as ‘‘ Combron-
ware” was applied in England after 1623 to porcelains brought from
China to that port on the Persian Gulf, and purchased there for ship-
ment home by the factory of the India Company before it extended its
operations to China (when these products came to be termed “ China-
ware”), or in the same manner that “Indian China” is applied in
America to porcelain shipped from Canton, and with as much reason.

Indeed, M. du Sartel, in accord with most other writers on the sub-
ject, maintains that no true porcelain was produced in Persia at all,
and that the designation of such ware Tchini not only means that the
earliest specimens and mode of manufacture were of Chinese origin,
but that they one and-all actually came from China. The Persians, it
is true, manufactured a kind of ware which has been designated ‘“ Per-
sian porcelain,” but it was of so soft a nature that it could be not only
scratched, but actually cut, with a knife, and was entirely distinet
from hard, kaolinic porcelain. The supplies of the latter were, M. du
Sartel maintains, derived entirely from China, to which country mod-
els, shapes, and special kinds of ornamentation were sent for repro-
duction, a custom which sufficiently explains the presence of a Persian
name, or the word fermaiche (“by order”), written in Arabic charac-
ters, upon porcelain of undoubtedly Chinese origin.

This opinion requires, I apprehend, further investigation prior to its
acceptance as fact. It is, however, recorded that Shah Abbas I, a great
patron of all the arts, about the year 1600 invited a number of Chinese
potters to establish themselves at Ispahan for the sake of introducing
improvements in the manufacture of porcelain. Though several new
methods were adopted, and though a new style of decoration, half
Chinese, half Persian, was largely used for a long period after the arri-
val of these potters, it is generally admitted that no hard porcelain re-
sembling that of China was even then produced in Persia. And one
can not help being struck by the strong similarity, amounting practi-

cally to identity, between the vases contained in the cases devoted to
so-called Persian porcelain in the Dresden collection and certain other
vases in the same collection which are classed as Chinese.

CHINESE AND EUROPEAN SYSTEMS OF MANUFACTURE COMPARED.

Whatever the variety of the Chinese porcelain was which consti-
tuted so important a factor in this early Arab trade, and whatever the
date at which it made its first appearance in HKurope, specimens of it
had, prior to the commencement of the second half of the seventeenth
century, found a place in the collections of princes alone. About that
time, however, Chinese porcelain became more generally known, and
the fine quality of the glaze, its transparency, and the brilliant style
of its decoration excited universal admiration. Strenuous efforts were
at once made on all sides to discover the secret of its manufacture, but
these researches, though resulting indirectly in other discoveries and
in great progress in the European manufacture, were not crowned with
success. They had, in fact, led to the creation, in France and England,
of soft porcelain, which, if in some respects superior to the Chinese
porcelain from a decorative point of view, was also more fragile and
more easily scratched than the latter. This soft porcelain was made in
France, at St. Cloud perhaps about 1695, at Chantilly in 1735, at Vin-
cennes in 1740, and at Sevres in 1756; and in England, at Chelsea in
1745, at Derby in 1748, and at Worcester in 1751. Recourse was then
had to the Jesuit missionaries in China, with the result of obtaining the
valuable letter from P. d’Entrecolles, dated 1712, supplemented ten
years later by further details. The difficulty incident to translating
technical Chinese expressions, combined with want of acquaintance with
chemistry on the part of the author, as well as the primitive condition
of that science more than one hundred and fifty years ago, prevented
the practical use of the information supplied by P. d’Entrecolles. An
attempt was made to secure the knowledge desired by obtaining speci-
mens of the materials employed. The fact, however, that these were
sent either in a partially fused state or in the forms of several almost
impalpable powders mixed together prevented a recognition of their
real nature.

What it had been impossible to learn by direct inquiry was, however,
discovered by chance. In 1718 Bottger found an important bed of
white and plastic clay in Saxony, and with it made the first “ hard”
porcelain manufactured in Europe. The Government had this bed
carefully guarded, imposed oaths of secrecy upon the staff employed,
had a strict account kept of all the clay taken out, and transported it
under armed convoy to Albrechtsburg, the place of manufacture,
which was converted into a veritable fortress. In spite, however, of
these precautions the secret leaked out in course of time, and with it
the clay also, to Vienna and St. Petersburg. Later, in 1765, Guettard
discovered in France the kaolin of Alengon, and Macquer, three years
later, found the remarkable beds of Saint-Yrieix.

The History of the Porcelain manufactories at Chingté-chén, trans-
lated by M. Julien, containing as it does a detailed account of the pro-
cedure followed there, permits a comparison between the systems em-
ployed in China and in Europe. In view of the interest attaching
to such a comparison no apology is needed for the following brief notes
on that subject, based chiefly upon the preface to M. Julien’s work
from the pen of M. Salvetat, a member of the directory of the Govern-
ment manufactory at Sevres.

COMPOSITION OF PORCELAIN.

Porcelain is composed of two parts—the one, infusible, the paste
(pate), which is required to supply the body of the vessel, or, as the
Chinese term it, to give it ‘““bone;” the other, fusible, the glaze (glag-
ure, couverte), which imparts its characteristic transparency to porce-
lain and at the same time prevents the vessel retaining its porousness
or contracting under the influence of heat.

The principal ingredients of the paste are clays, which are classed
according to their greater or less degree at the same time of plasticity
and fusibility. The porcelain clay par excellence is kaolin, a white sil-
icate of alumina produced by the decomposition of granitic or felds-
pathic rocks, almost infusible, and if not always perfectly white by
nature, losing its tint in the kiln. It derives its name originally from
that of the hill whence the manufactories at Chingté-chén procured
their supply of this clay. The main object of the glaze is, as has been
stated, while securing transparency, to prevent the paste remaining
porous. Now, the substances unaffected by water but fusible by fire
are quartz, silica, certain limestones, pegmatite, feldspar, silex, and the
compounds resulting from a superficial fusion of these substances, which
are then reduced to a fine powder. The relative proportion of these
substances in the composition of the glaze may be raised at will with a
corresponding diversity of result—M. Brongniart dividing the com-
pound into three classes, each subdivided into three groups.

In ordinary language porcelain is classified under two grand divisions,
hard paste and soft paste—la pate dureand la pate tendre. The latter is
characterized by the presence, either naturally or artificially, of limestone
products or alkalies, either in the condition of phosphates or in that of
marl or chalk, which lower its degree of fusibility, so that it becomes fus-
ibie or at least soft at a temperature of 800° C. The absence of tbese
matters in the hard paste causes it to retain its original consistency in
far greater heat, and it can resist a temperature of 1,500° C., or above.
Upon these two divisions are grafted several minor ones determined
by the kind of glaze, which, according to its composition and mode of
application, is termed vernis, émail, or couverte. After unglazed tiles
and bricks, the primitive thin glaze, vernis, is found on the pottery of the
Ktruscans, ancient Arabs, Persians, and the early inhabitants of
America; then, on that manufactured in Germany and Italy in the
436 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

fourteenth century, a sort of transparent glass with a foundation of
lead—a glaze stillcommon in country productions. Later, in the fifteenth
century the true white enamel, émail, a mixture of salt, of lead and
tin, the thickness of which concealed the color of the paste, was dis-
covered in Italy and gained immortality for Luca della Robbia of
Florence, and Oragio Fontana of Pesaro. In this category also belong
the majolicas, faenza, the faiences of Niirnberg, Bernard Palisy’s pot-
tery, the faiences of Nevers, Rouen, and other places, ancient and
modern. The cowverte is confined to porcelain proper.

Crude Chinese kaolin, when cleansed by washing out its impurities,
and ready for use in making the paste, gives a very white clay, soft to
the touch, possessing a plasticity very similar to that of Saint Yrieix,
which is derived from decomposed pegmatite. The residue left by the
washing contains a good deal of quartz, crystals of feldspar partially
decomposed, and flakes of mica, as would be found in graphic granite.
Analysis shows that the fusible portion consists chiefly of petrosilex
and, by its composition and density, closely resembles the rock found
in abundance at Saint Yrieix, which, without addition, furnishes the
glaze for hard porcelain at Sevres.

The composition of Chinese and of the most celebrated of European
porcelains may be compared in the following table:

Thus, generally speaking, Chinese porcelain contains more silica and
less alumina than do the products of the manufactories of Sevres, Vi-
enna, and Saxony, respectively. The effect of the presente in greater or
less degree of these components is well known by the Chinese, who say
that to produce fine porcelain the ratio of alumina must be increased;
to produce the commoner kinds that of silica must be increased. In
Europe experience has taught the same results. The porcelain of com-
merce shows much the same composition as do the specimens of Chinese
analyzed by M. Salvetat, also presumably ordinary ware and not the
finest grades intended for Imperial use, while in the three Government
establishments mentioned a larger ratio of alumina is introduced, be-
cause it resists high temperatures and is therefore necessary to enable
the designs painted to maintain their sharpness of outline. In some
cases the Chinese also employ ferruginous kaolins, which sensibly di-
minish the value of the manufactured article.
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. 437

SHAPING THE PASTE.

In China the paste is roughly shaped, is turned, and is molded when .
in a malleable state, in much the same manner as in Hurope. Casting
or moulage en barbotine appears to be unknown in China. The ab-
sence of this process, which has enabled European artists to produce
such grand results, only increases our admiration of the manual dex-
terity which has enabled the Chinese to manufacture such numbers of
jars of large dimension and cups so thin, as egg-shell porcelain, which
can now, or could at least when M. Salvetat wrote, only be produced
at Sevres by casting. The sculpture, the hollowing out, the shaping,
ete., are practised also in China in much the same manner as in Hurope.
Among the happiest effects produced in this line are engraving in the
paste, sculpture in relief on the paste, and the open work which the
French term piéces réticulées.

One peculiarity of the Chinese system is the method of completing
the footin the unbaked state and after being covered with glaze. This
custom of laying on the glaze before the article has been completed,
the method in which the glaze is applied, and the composition of the
glaze present, perhaps, the greatest contrasts with the corresponding
manipulations employed in Kurope. Itis certainly curious that the Chi-
nese after a practical experience extending through so many centuries,
should be ignorant of the advantages to be derived from submitting
the article to a slight baking before applying the glaze, which is then
in a condition termed by the French [état dégourdi. Porcelain earth,
like other clays, is dilutable by water, but it ceases to be so after ex-
posure to a temperature which makes it red. On this property is based
in Hurope an expeditious and easy method of covering porcelain
with glaze. The porcelain having been rendered indissoluble and
absorbent by a preliminary slight baking, it may be covered with a
uniform layer of suitable thickness by a simple immersion in water
holding the finely crushed material in suspension, provided that the
proportions of water and glaze (relatively to the thickness of the ves-
sel to be covered) have been duly determined. The failure to em-
ploy this process is the more curious since, from Mr. Hoffman’s
sketch of the Japanese system of manufacture appended to M. Julien’s
work, it appears that in that country the glaze is applied to porcelain
after preliminary baking.

GLAZE.

In Europe porcelain glaze is generally composed of pure pegmatite,
finely crushed and applied by immersion after a preliminary baking.
In Germany other substances, such as kaolin or paste, have been added
to diminish its fusibility ; but at Sevres pegmatite from Saint Yrieix is
alone used. The addition of lime in forming the glaze is a rare excep-
tion in Europe. In China, on the contrary, pure petrosilix is but very
438 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

seldom used for this purpose. The greater part of Chinese and Japan-
ese porcelains is covered with compound glazes, obtained by a mixture
_ of substances of which the proportions vary according to the nature
of the article, lime being the material added to the petrosilix to ren-
der it more easily fusible; and, in some cases, the ratio added is so large
that it represents a fourth of the total weight. In the preparation of
the glaze the use of fern leaves is sometimes mentioned. The residue
of the leaves after burning appears, however, to be cast aside, and
what purpose these leaves exactly served has never been determined.

As regards the manner of applying the glaze the Chinese, as has
been Shown, are ignorant of the method of subjecting the porcelain to
a preliminary baking and then utilizing the want of porousness thus
gained to immerse the vessel in the liquid glaze. Instead, they apply
it by aspersion and immersion or by insufflation. For example, take
a cup. It is held by the outside slanting over a basin contain-
ing the liquid glaze. Sufficient of the glaze is then thrown on the
inside to cover the surface. This is aspersion. The outside is then
immersed in the liquid, the workman dexterously keeping the vessel in
equilibrium with the hand and asmall stick. The foot having remained _
in its original state, the cup is then carried, covered as it is with glaze,
to the wheel that the foot may be hollowed and finished; a mark in ~
color is added on the hollowed portion, which is then covered with glaze.
When the ware is too delicate to be treated in this manner, the glaze is
applied by insufflation. A piece of gauze attached to a hollow tube
having been plunged in the colored glaze (red or blue) or uncolored
glaze, the workman scatters the liquid from the gauze onto the vessel
by blowing through the opposite end of the tube three, four or even as
many as eighteen times.

BAKING.

The porcelain being then ready for baking, it is taken to the kilns,
which are usually situated at some distance from the workshops andbe-
long to persons whose sole occupation is to superintend the baking.
The large pieces are placed one by one in a separate seggar made by
hand, covers being dispensed with by piling the seggars one on another.
Several of the smaller pieces are placed in the same seggar, the floor un-
der each being covered with a layer of sand and kaolin refuse to pre-
vent adhesion. The porcelain being still in a soft state, great care must
be exercised in placing it in its seggar. It is not touched, therefore,
with the hand, but transferred into the seggar by an ingenious contriv-
ance of cords and sticks. The bottom of the kiln is filled with a thick
layer of gravel on which the seggars are piled, those under the chim-
ney, the two seggars at the bottom of each pile, and that at the top be-
ing left empty, as their contents would not be thoroughly baked. The
finest pieces are placed in the center, those with harder glaze at the
entry near the hearth, and the coarsest farthest in. The piles are
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. 439

strongly bound together, and the stacking of the oven being completed,
the door is bricked up. From the description given of the kilns by P.
W’Entrecolles it appears that they are much the same as those used in
early times at Vienna and Berlin.

After the baking commences a low fire is kept up for twenty-four
hours, which is then followed by one more powerful. At the top of the
kiln are four or five sinall holes covered with broken pots, one of which
is opened when it is thought the baking is completed, and by means of
pincers a cage is opened to test the condition of the porcelain. The
baking ended, firing is stopped, and all openings closed during a period
of three or five days, according to the size of the pieces, when the door
is opened and the articles removed.

To bake porcelain decorated with soft colors or du demi-grand feu, two
kinds of kilns are used—one open, the other closed—the former of which
bears a close resemblance to the enameler’s kiln (moufle). This kind of
furnace has been used in Germany to bake painted porcelain; but evenin
China the liability to breakage confines their use to articles of small
size. The large pieces are baked in closed kilns, the general arrange-
ment of which resembles that of the kilns known as moufles, but being
circular in form, they are really porcelain kilns of small size.

DECORATIONS.

In the decoration of Kuropean porcelain one of three methods is fol-
lowed: (a) The use of paste of different colors; (b) the introduction of
the coloring matter in the glaze; (c) the application of the colors upon
the white surface of the porcelain. The two former methods require
the application of a temperature as high as that necessary to bake the
porcelain; they are, therefore, termed colors du grand feu. The third
method requires for the vitrifaction of the colors a much lower temper-
ature; the colors used are therefore termed de moufle or of the enameler’s
furnace. It is the use of this latter system which permits the repro-
duction with exactness of the works of celebrated oil painters.

The substances employed in the decoration of porcelain in China may
be divided into two similar categories, colors du grand feu and de
moufle.

Colors du grand feu.—The varieties of the grounds in these colors
have played probably as important a part in the high reputation gained
by Chinese porcelain as have the originality and rich harmony of the
designs. The blue decoration under the glaze is made with the brush
on the unbaked porcelain; the coloring matter being peroxide of
cobaltiferous manganese, the shade, dark or light, depending on the
quantity used, and the greater or less trending towards violet on the
richness of the ore in cobalt. It resists the fire well, retaining great
distinctness and at lower temperatures than are necessary at Sevres.
Céladon and the red grounds, at times showing an orange, at others a
violet shade, had not been successfully reproduced in Kurope when
440 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

M. Salvetat wrote in 1855, and he considered their production in China
as due rather to accident than design. The justice of this view is,
however, perhaps open to question, for the Chinese appear to have
at least an empirical knowledge of the conditions necessary to produce
these colors, though they are unable in all cases to insure those con-
ditions. The fond laque or feuille morte is obtained by the use of oxide
of iron, the amount of that metal and the nature of the gas surrounding
the vessel in the kiln determining the tone of the color from a light
shade to one resembling bronze, and warmth of color being obtained by
an oxidizing atmosphere. Black grounds are produced in a variety of
ways, either by the thickness of the colored glaze, or by laying several
shades of different colors one on the other, or, again, by laying a blue
glaze on a brown laque, or vice versa.

M. Salvetat states that among the colors for the ground employed in
China some are evidently applied upon the biscuit, 7. e., porcelain
already fired at a high temperature. These are violet, turquoise blue,
yellow, and green, all containing a pretty large proportion of oxide of
lead; and, vitrifying as they do at a medium temperature, hold a posi-
tion half way between the two main categories and may be therefore
termed colors du demi-grand feu. Nothing approaching these colors, he
says, is produced in Europe. ‘To do so, however, would not be difficult,
the green and turquoise blue owing their colors to copper, the yellow
to lead and antimony, and the violet to an oxide of HN use TER contain-
ing but little cobalt. |

Colors de moufle-—In Europe these colors are obtained by mixing one
oxide or several metallic oxides together with a vitreous flux, the
composition of which varies with the nature of the color to be devel-
oped. That most generally used is termed ‘the flux for grays.” It
serves not only for grays, however, but also for blacks, reds, blues,
and yellows, and is composed of six parts of minium, two parts of sili-
cious sand, and one part of melted borax. The colors are obtained by
mixing by weight one part of metallic oxide with three parts of the
flux, so that the composition may be expressed thus:

100. 0

In cases where, as with oxide of cobalt, the colors are produced by
mixture with the flux and ought to have the required shade when
applied, the metallic oxides are melted with the flux prior to use; in
those, however, where the desired colords that inherent in the oxide,
the tone of which would be changed by a double exposure to fire, as is
the case with reds derived from peroxide of iron, the union with the
flux by melting is dispensed with. The colors so made suffice to permit
the reproduction on porcelain of oil paintings; but it is essential that
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. 441

they all melt at the same temperature and after baking present a
sufficient and thoroughly uniform glaze.

In Chinese decorations these conditions, insisted upon in Europe,
are both absent. Some colors, such as the rose tints derived from gold,
the blues, greens, and yellows, are brilliant, thoroughly melted, and so
thick as to stand out above the general level of the surface; others,
such as the reds derived from iron and the blacks, are much thinner,
and are almost always quite dull or only slightly glazed when thin.
The style of painting in Chinese differs entirely from the European.
In the majority of the specimens the forms and flesh are not modeled;
strokes of black or red define the outlines; the tones do not shade;
the colors are laid in flat tints on which a damask is sometimes drawn
afterwards, either in the same or in different colors, but the mixture on
the palette of different crushed colors, which permits of so much variety
in European painting, appears not to be practiced by them. Their
colors (as indeed seemed probable from the lightness of the shades ob-
tained in spite of their thickness before analysis had confirmed the
presumption) contained far less coloring-matter than do the European,
a peculiarity which makes them approach nearer to the vitrified sub-
stances known as enamel than to any other. They are characterized
by great simplicity and a considerabie degree of uniformity.

The flux, which is not distinct in color, is always composed of silica, of
oxide of lead in but slightly varying proportions, and of a larger or
smaller quantity of alkalies (sodaand potash). This fiux contains in disso-
Jution, in the conditions of silicates, some hundredth parts only of color-
ing oxides. The number of these is very small, being oxide of copper
for greens and bluish-greens, gold for the reds, oxide of cobalt for the
blues, oxide of antimony for the yellows, and arsenical acid and stan-
nic acid for whites. Oxides of iron to produce red and oxides of impure
manganese to produce black are not used, because no doubt these colors
ean not be,obtained from the oxides named by means of dissolution.

In Europe, in addition to the oxides already mentioned, important re-
sults are obtained from substances unknown in China. The shade
derived from pure oxide of cobalt is modified by mixing with it oxide
ot zine or alumina, and sometimes alumina and oxide of chrome; pure
oxide of iron gives a dozen reds, shading from orange-red to very dark
violet; ochres, pale or dark, yeliow or brown, are obtained by the com-
bination in different proportions of oxide of iron, of oxide of zine, and
of oxide of cobalt or of nickel; browns are produced by increasing the
amount of oxide of cobalt contained in, and blacks by omitting the
oxide of zinc from, the composition which gives the ochers, Theshades
of yellow are varied by the addition of oxide of zinc or of tin to render
them lighter, and of oxide of iron to render them darker. Oxide of
chrome, pure or mixed with oxide of cobalt or with oxides of cobalt
and of zine, gives yellow-greens and bluish-greens, which may be made
to vary from pure green to almost pure blue. Metallic gold supplies
442 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

the purple of Cassius, which may be changed at will into violet, purple,
or carmine. Other useful colors are obtained from oxide of uranium
and from chromate of iron, of baryta, and of cadmium.

In European colors all these coloring matters are merely mixed. In
the Chinese the oxides are on the contrary dissolved. This peculiarity,
no less than their appearance, closely connects the Chinese colors with
“enamels.” Both present the same coloring, obtained from the same
oxides and a composition of flux very similar, sometimes identical.
Transparent enamels are vitreous compounds, the composition of which
varies according to the amount of fusibility required and which are
colored by a few hundredths of oxides. Blues are supplied by oxide of
cobalt; greens by protoxide of copper; reds by gold; opaque enamels,
yellow or white, owe their color and opacity either to antimony or to
arsenic or stannic acids, together or alone. It had, however, been
found impossible to utilize these enamel substances in the decoratiun
of European porcelain, owing to the fact that they scaled off; and when
the Chinese colors (as sent by MM. Itier and Ly) were experimented
upon at Sevres, they did precisely the same thing. When placed upon
Chinese porcelain, however, they developed at a temperature below
that used at the Sevres manufactory for retouching flowers, and did
not scale. The explanation is no doubt to be found in the fact that
the paste of Chinese porcelain being more fusible than the European,
the glaze must also be more easily fusible, and the lime introduced into
it to increase the fusibility adapts it in some manner for closer union
with the compounds forming the enamel.

If, then, the appearance of Chinese porcelain differs from that of
European productions, if the harmony of their paintings offers greater
variety, it is the necessary result of the process employed in China.
All the colors used contained but little coloring matter and have no
worth unless applied in a depth which gives to their paintings a relief
impossible to obtain by other means. The harmony of their decoration
results from the nature and composition of their enamels.

The lung or dragon is the chief of the four Chinese supernatural beasts, the
other three being the féng huang (usually translated phenix), the
ch‘ilin (usually translated unicorn), and the tortoise. It is usually
represented with scowling head, straight horns, a scaly, serpentiue
body with four feet armed with formidable claws ; along the length
of the body runs a line of bristling dorsal spines, and on the hips and
shoulders are flame-like appendages. The claws appear to have
originally numbered three on each foot, but the number has in sub-
sequent ages been increased to five. The Shuo-wén, a dictionary pub-
lished in the second century A. D., states that of the three hundred and
sixty scaly reptiles the dragon is the chief. It wields the power of
transformation and the gift of rendering itself visible or invisible at
pleasure. In spring it ascends to the skies and in autumn it buries
itself in the watery depths. The wacery principle in the atmosphere
is essentially associated with the lung, but its congener, the chias-
lung, is inseparably connected with waters gathered upon the surface
of the earth. A denizen of such waters is also the variety p‘an-lung,
which does not mount to Heaven. There is also a species of hornless
dragon—the chin-lung. Kuan Tz’u (seventh century B. C.) declares
that ‘the dragon becomes at will reduced to the size of a silk-worm
or swollen till it fills the space of Heaven and earth. It desires to
mount, and it rises till it affronts the clouds; to sink, and it de-
scends till hidden below the fountains of the deep.” The early cos-
mogonists enlarged upon the imaginary data of previous writers,
and averred that there were four distinct kinds of dragons proper—
the t‘ien-lung or celestial dragon, which guaras the mansions of the
gods and supports them so that they do not fall; the shén-lung or
spiritual dragon, which causes the winds to blow and produces rain
for the benefit of mankind; the ti-lung or dragon of earth, which
marks out the courses of rivers and streams; and the fu-ts‘ang-lung
or dragon of hidden treasures, which watches over the wealth con-
cealed from mortals. Modern superstition has further originated
the idea of four dragon kings, each bearing rule over one of the four
seas which form the borders of the habitable earth. The huang-lung
or yellow dragon is the most honored of the tribe; and this it was,
which, rising from the waters of Lo, presented to the eyes cf
Fuhsi the elements of writing (see No. 36). The dragon, as chief
among the beings divinely constituted, is peculiarly symbolical of
all that pertains to the Son of Heaven—the Emperor, whose throne is
termed lung-wei, the dragon-seat, and whose face is described as lung-
yen, the dragon-countenance (see Mayer’s Chinese Readers’ Manual
No. 451). At his death the Emperor is believed to be borne by dragons
to the regions of the blessed. The dragon thus intimately associ-
ated with the Emperor is always depicted with five talons on each
claw, and it is he alone, properly speaking, who can use such a de-
vice upon his property; the dragon borne by the princes of the
blood has but four talons on each claw. The distinction, however,
is not at present rigidly maintained, and the five-clawed dragon is
met with embroidered on officers’ uniforms.

“Tn Chinese Buddhism,” says Dr. Anderson, in his ‘‘ Catalogue of Japan-
ese and Chinese Paintings in the British Museum,” “the dragon
plays an important part, either as a force auxiliary to the law, or as
a malevolent creature to be converted or quelled. Its usual char-
acter, however, is that of a guardian of the faith under the direction
of Buddhas, Bédhisattvas, or Arhats. As a dragon king it officiates
at the baptism of S’akyamuni, or bewails his entrance into Nirvana;
as an attribute of saintly or divine personages it appears at the feet
of the Arhat Panthaka, emerging from the sea to salute the goddess
Kuanyin, or as an attendant upon or alternative form of Sarasvati,
the Japanese Benten; as an enemy to mankind it meets its Perseus
and St. George in the Chinese monarch Kao Tsu (of the Han dynasty),
and the Shinto God, Susano no Mikoto. * * * As to the origin of
the relation of the Cobra to Indian Buddhism, there appears to be
little doubt that the Cobra kings represented a once hostile Scythic
race of serpent-worshippers which first invaded India in the seventh
century B. C., and that a subsequent alliance with portions of the
fureign tribes gave rise to tlhe stories of converted Nagas, and of
Nagas who defended the faith. When the religion made its way into
China, where the hooded snake was unknown, the emblems shown
in the Indian pictures and graven images lost their force of suggest-
ion, and hence became replaced by a mythical but more familiar em-
blem of power. The multiplication of the cobra-head seen in the
Amravati topes becomes lost in Chinese Buddhism, but perhaps may
be traced in the seven-headed dragons and serpents of Japanese le-
gend. The high position occupied by the dragon in Chinese imagi-
nation may perhaps be a relic of ancient serpent-worship in that
country. Illustrations of the identity of the dragon and serpent in
Japanese art and the portrayal of creatures in transitional forms be-
tween the two are suggestive of such an origin.

Féng, the name of the male, and huang, of the female, of a fabulous bird of
wondrous form and mystic nature, the second among the four super-
natural creatures. The compound of the two féng-huang is the gen-
eric designation usually employed for the bird, and is frequently
translated ‘‘ pheenix.” One writer describes it as having the head of
a pheasant,the beak of a swallow, the neck of a tortoise, and the out-
ward semblance of a dragon, to which another version adds the tail
of a fish, but in pictorial representations it is usually delineated, as
here, as a compound of a peacock and a pheasant, with the addition
of many gorgeous colors. Very early legends narrated that this bird
made its appearance as a presage of the advent of virtuous rulers,
whose presence it also graced as an emblem of their auspicious gov-
ernment. It sat in the court of Huang Ti, who is credited with
having entered upon a reign of one hundred years ia B. C. 2697,
while that sovereign observed the ceremonial fasts; and, according
to the Classic of History, it came with measured gamblings to add
splendor to the musical performances conducted by the great Shun
(B. C. 2255 to 2206). The five colors of its plumage are supposed to
be typical of the five cardinal virtues. As the lung or dragon has
become the emblem of the emperor so the féng-huang has become that
of the Empress.

The mang would appear to be properly a huge serpent or boa-constrictor.
In paintings, however, and in sculpture it is usually represented as
a lizard having a scowling head, with a beard at times depending
from the chin, ana four feet bearing claws but without talons. On
the mang-p’ao, i. e., mang robe, the court dress, no mang, properly
speaking, appears, its place being taken by a four clawed or taloned
dragon. cS

side over the brim to inside, where at bottom, confined by a double circle, is
a blue dragon in white, green, and red clouds. Round foot on outside is
small pattern. Marked as last, but decoration and caligraphy of date mark
show the ware to be of Japanese manufacture. Height, 34 inches; diameter,
72 inches.

figures in beautiful deep blue under glaze and in,pale and dark green enamel
colors. Above, a formal pattern encircles the jar below the neck, round which
are small sprays of flowers in-brick-red with leaves alternately green and
blue.

This represents the well-known legend of Wang Chih, who, having wan-
dered in the mountains of Chl’iichow to gather fire-wood, came upon
two aged men, the Southern Pole star, the genius of longevity, and
the Northern Pole star, the genius of death, intent upon a game of
chess. He laid down his ax and watched their game, in the course
of which the former handed him something resembling a date-stone,
which he was told to place in his mouth. No sooner had he tasted it
than he became oblivious of hunger and thirst. After sometime
the donor turned to him and said, ‘‘It is long since you came here;
you should go home now.” Whereupon Wang Chih, proceeding to
pick up his ax, found that the handle had moldered into dust.
On reaching his home he found that centuries had elapsed since the
time when he left it for the mountains, and that no vestige of his
kinsfolk remained. Retiring to a retreat among the hills he devoted
himself to the rites of Taoism, and finally attained to immortality.”
Wang Chih is stated to have lived under the Chin dyuasty in the
third century B. C. The appearance of this South Pole star is sup-
posed to announce peace throughout the world.

19, 20. Jars (2) with covers, of the small potiche shape, of pure white porcelain, with
paintings in deep, dull blue under glaze, of children playing in garden and
plucking flowers from the trees; cover ornamented with children, similarly
painted, in grotesque attitudes playing. A reproduction of a popular Chinesa
painting, the Po-tzu’-t’u, ‘‘ Drawing of (lit.a hundred) Children.” Mark on

by the French blane de Chine. Tall, circular in shape, tied at center with
ribbon. Spout formed by lizard with four legs and branching tail, which
clings torim and turns head outward, the wine issuing from its mouth. The
handle is formed by a similar animal twisting head downwards from rim

25. Pencil-holder, tall, circular in shape, of pure-white Ming dynasty porcelain,
formed of sprays of lotus flowers and leaves admirably molded in relief
and covered with lustrous, transparent glaze, the spaces between the flowers
and leaves being excised to form open-work. No mark; bottom unglazed.
Height, 33 inches; diameter, 2} inches.

171. Pencil-washer of white Ming porcelain, of globular form, with low, open neck,
and a handle on either side formed of a grotesque lion’s head molded in
relief. Decoration consists of six genii riding on a sword, a carp, a tiger,
a hat, a bunch of sticks, and a dragon, painted in deep blue through
brick-red waves under glaze. Round neck and foot a narrow band of white
studded with blue spots. Mark 7s’ai-hua-t’ang, the designation of a portion of
some princely palace not yet identified. Height, 2f inches ; diameter, 34 inches.

The sage riding the waves upon the sword is Lii Fung-pin, stated to
have been born A. D. 755. While holding office as magistrate of
Té-hua, in modern Kiangsi, he is said to have met the immortalized
Chung li Ch’iian, who instructed him in the mysteries of alchemy.
On his subsequently begging to be allowed to convert his fellow-
countrymen to the true belief, he was, as a preliminary, exposed to
ten temptations, which he successfully resisted. He was then
invested with the formulas of magic and a sword of supernatural
power, as the Taoist legends relate, with which he traversed the
empire during a period of four hundred years, killing dragons and
ridding it of divers kinds of evils. In the twelfth century temples
were erected to his honor under the title of Ch‘un Yang. (Mayers,
No. 467.)

He of the carp is Kin-Kao, ‘‘a sage who lived in northern China about
the twelfth century. Itissaid that he wandered over the province of
Chihli for two centuries, and then, taking leave of his disciples
with a promise to return by a certain day, he plunged into the river.
When the appointed time for his re-appearance arrived, the pupils,
with a great multitude, assembled upon the banks, and, having
duly bathed and purified themselves, made offerings to him. At
length, in the sight of ten thousand persons, he sprang from the water

- riding upon acarp. After tarrying with his friends for a month he
again entered the river and was seen no more.” *

The sage on the tiger is perhaps Chii Ling-jeu, a rishi of marvelous
powers.

He on the bundle of sticks is perhaps Damma, son of a king in southern
India, ‘‘ who,” says Mr. Anderson in his catalogue, p. 511, ‘‘ was the
first Chinese patriarch. He arrived inChina A. D. 520, and established
himself in a temple in Lozang. During nine years of his stay there
he remained buried in profound abstraction, neither moving nor
speaking, and when he returned to consciousness of his surroundings ~
his legs had become paralyzed by long disuse. In the Butsu-zo-dzu-i
it is said he came to Japan A. D.613, and died on Mount Kataoaka.
The Chinese, however, maintain he died and was buried in China,
but that three years after his death he was met traveling toward
India, with one foot bare, and when his tomb was opened by the
emperor’s order it was found empty save for a cast off shoe.”

The dragon genius is Ch‘én Nan, a sage possessed of supernatural powers
to cure the sick, transmute metals, travel enormous distances, etc.
Passing through a place where the inhabitants were praying for rain
he stirred a pool where he knew a dragon lived, with a long iron
pole. So plenteous a downpour at once ensued that all the rivers
were filled.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

172-175. Plates (4 small) of white Ming dynasty porcelain, decorated inside, the

genius of longevity accompanied by the spotted stag, amid waves and clouds
in deep blue upon brick-red waves. On the outside are the eight immortals
venerated by the Taoist sect, in blue or vermilion waves. Mask as on
The decoration shows them to have been intended to hold sweetmeats
during birthday ceremonies.

The eight immortals venerated by the Taoists are Chung-li Ch‘iian, Chang

Kuo, Lii Tung-pin, Ts‘as Kuo-ch‘iu, Li Tieh-kuai, Han Hsiang-tz‘u,
Lan Ts‘ai-ho, and Ho Hsien-ku. Though some, if not all, of these
personages had been previously venerated as immortals in Taoist
legends, it would appear from the K‘é-yii-ts‘ung-k‘ao (ch. 34) that
their defined assemblage into a group of immortalized beings can not
claim a higher antiquity than the Yiian dynasty, i. ¢., the end of the
thirteenth or beginning of the fonrteenth century.

Chung-li Ch‘iian is reputed to have lived under the Chou dynasty (B. C.

1122 to 256). Many marvelous particulars are narrated respecting
his birth and career, in the course of which he met Tung Hua Kung,
the patriarch of the Genii, ‘‘ who revealed to him the mystic formula
of longevity and the secret of the power of transmutation and of
magic craft.” He was eventually permitted to join the Genii. and
has appeared from time to time as the messenger of Heaven. He is
usually represented as a martial figure with a sword.

Chang Kuo is said to have flourished towards the close of the seventh and

middle of the eighth century. Leading an erratic life, he performed
wonderful feats of necromancy. Hisconstant companion was a white
mule which could carry him thousands of miles in a single day, and
which, when he halted, he folded up and hid away in his wallet.
When he again required its services, he spurted water upon the packet
from his mouth and the animal at once resumed its propershape. Ac-
cording to Taoist legend, the Emperor Hsiian Tsung, of the T‘ang
dynasty, repeatedly urged him to visit his court and assume a
priestly office there, but the ascetic wanderer rejected every offer.
He is reputed to have entered immortality about 740 A. D. without
suffering bodily dissolution. He is usually represented conjuring his
mule from a wallet or gourd, or holding an instrument of music.

Lii Tung-pin said to have been born A. D. 755. While holding office at

Té-hua, in modern Kiangsi province, he is reputed to have met
Chung-li Ch‘iian (see ante) among the Lu mountains, and was instruc-
ted by him.in the mysteries of alchemy and the magic formula of the
elixir of life. Having expressed a desire to convert his fellow-men to
the true belief, a series of temptations, ten in number, was imposed
upon him as a preliminary. These he successfully overcame, and
was thereupon invested with the formulas of magic and a sword of
supernatural power, with which he traversed the Empire during a
period of four hundred years, slaying dragons and ridding it of vari-
ous kinds of evils. In the twelfth century temples were erected to
him under the title of Ch‘un Yang. Like Chung-li Ch‘iian, he is usu-
ally depicted as of martial bearing, armed with a sword.

Of Ts‘as Kuo-ch‘in little is known. He is reputed to have been the son

of Ts‘ao Pin, the great military commander, who largely contributed
to the establishment of the Sung dynasty upon the throne of China,
and the brother of the Empress Ts‘ao of the same dynasty. He would
thus have lived in the eleventh century. He is usually represented
as a military officer, holding a pair of castanets.
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA, 449

Li T‘ieh-kuai, or T‘ieh-Kuai-Tsien-Shéng, i. e., ‘‘Li of the Iron Statt,” or
‘the gentleman of the Iron Staff.” His birth is assigned to no pre-
cise era; his name, however, is stated to have been Li, and he is de-
scribed as of commanding stature and of dignified mien. He was
entirely devoted to the study of Taoist lore, his instructor having
been the philosopher Lao Tz‘u himself, who for that purpose descended
at times from Heaven, and at others summoned his pupil to his celes-
tial abode. ‘‘On one occasion, when about to mount on high,” says
the legend as given by Mayers (No. 718), “‘at his patron’s bidding
the pupil, before departing in spirit to voyage through the air, left
a disciple of his own to watch over his material soul (p‘o), with the
command that if, after seven days had expired, his spirit (hun) did
not return, the material essence might be dismissed into space.
Unfortunately, at the expiration of six days the watcher was called
away to the death-bed of his mother, and, his trust being neglected,
when the disembodied spirit returned on the evening of the seventh
day it found its earthly habitation no longer vitalized. It, therefore
entered the first available refuge, which was the body of a lame and
crooked beggar whose spirit had at that moment been exhaled, and
in this shape the philosopher continued his existence, supporting his
halting footsteps with an iron staff.” Li T‘ieh-kuai is, in consequence,
usually depicted as a lame and ragged beggar exhaling his spiritual
essence in the form of a shadowy miniature of his corporeal form, or
conjuring five bats, symbolical of the five kinds of happiness (see No.
27) from a gourd.

Han Hsiang-tz‘u is reputed to have been the grandson of the famous
statesman, plilosopker, and poet of the T‘ang dynasty, and to have
lived in the latter half of the ninth century. He was an ardent
votary of transcendental study, and the pupil of Lii Tung-pin (see
ante), himself one of the immortals, who appeared to him in the flesh.
Having been carried up into the peach-tree of the Genii (see Nos. 27
and 28), he fell from its branches, and in falling entered into immor-
tality. He is usually depicted playing upon a flute or sitting upon
a portion of the trunk of a peach-tree.

Lan Ts‘ai-ho is of uncertain sex, but usually reputed a female. The t‘ai-
p‘ing-Kuang-chi states that she wandered abroad clad in a tattered
blue gown, with one foot shoeless and the other shod, in summer
wearing a wadded garment next the skin, and in winter sleeping
amid snow andice. ‘‘In this guise,” says Mayers, ‘‘the weird being
begged a livelihood in the streets, waving a wand aloft and chant-
ing a doggerel verse denunciatory of fleeting life and its delusive
pleasures.” Lan Ts‘ai-ho is usually drawn as an aged man or as a
female clad in leaves or rags, carrying a basket, (?) to hold the alms
given.

Ho Hsien-Ku was the daughter of one Ho T‘ai. a native of Tséng-ch‘éng,
near Canton, and was born in the latter half of the seventh century.
Born with six hairs growing on the top of her head, she at fourteen
vears of age dreamed that a spirit visited her and instructed her in
the art of obtaining immortality by eating powdered mother-of-pearl.
She complied with this injunction and vowed herself to a life of vir-
ginity. Her days were henceforth passed in solitary wanderings
among the hills, among which she moved as on wings, to gather
herbs, and eventually renounced all mortal food. Her fame having
reached the ears of the Empress Mu, a concubine endowed with a
masterful intellect, who succeeded in usurping the sovereign power,

450 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

and who, but for a revolution, would have deposed the dynasty of
T‘ang, she was summoned to court, but vanished from mortal sight
on her way thither. She is said to have been seen once more, in
A. D. 750, floating upon a cloud at the temple of the Taoist immortal
Ma-Ku, and again some years later near Canton. She is sometimes
represented clothed in a mantle of mugwort leaves and holding a
lotus-flower.

26. Bowl of white K’anghsi (1662 to 1722) porcelain, with scalloped edges dividing
the vessel into eight flattened sections, each filled with a scene admirably
painted, chiefly in blue, but with small details in enamel green, on a ground
inside and out of deep yellow under thick transparent glaze. These paint-
ings are copies from celebrated pictures, drawn by a famous artist named
Fei of the Yiian dynasty, i. e., latter half of the twelfth or early in thirteenth
century, illustrative of the pleasures of the Hsi-ytian or Western Park. At
bottom inside, a man holding a jar, alsoin blue. An admirable specimen of
a highly prized ware. Mark Ta-ch’ing-k’ang-hsi-nien-chih, ‘Made during the
k’anghsi period of the Great Pure or Ch’ing (the present) dynasty.” Height,
38 inches; Diameter, 7% inches.

Of this ware the ‘‘ Ambassade de la Compagnie Orientale des Provinces
Unis vers /Empereur de la Chine ou Grand Can de Tartarie fait par
les Sieurs Pierre de Goyer et Jacob de Keyser” (Leyden, 1665), and
the ‘‘ Travels from Muscovy to China, by E. Ysbranti Ides, Ambassa-
dor from Peter the Great to the Emperor of China in 1692” (pub-
lished in Harris’s ‘‘Collection of Voyages”), say: ‘‘ The finest, rich-
est, and most valuable china is not exported, at least very rarely,
particularly a yellow ware, which is destined for the imperial use,
and is prohibited to all other persons.”

The Hsi-Yiian was a park laid out by Yang Ti (A. D. 605 to 616) of the
Sui dynasty. It was over 60 miles in circuit, and ‘‘exhausted the
utmost degrees of splendor and beauty. When the foliage became
decayed and fell, it was replaced upon the trees by leaves of silk.
Here the imperial débauché was accustomed to ride on moonlit
nights, accompanied by a cavalcade of thousands of the inmates of

: his seraglio.” (Mayers.)

27. Bowl of pure white K’anghsi porcelain, wide spreading, decorated on outside with
mythological subjects admirably painted in great detail and with great del-
icacy of brush in the characteristic tones of the latter half of this reign.
Vermilion-red and enamel colors. Inside a branch of the peach-tree, bearing
one fruit and several leaves, in green shaded and varied with darker tints of
the same color, with the exception of two, which show a great variety of
shades of decay, the veins alone remaining in parts; on the peach, which, as
here, is usually pointed in China, is the character Shou, longevity, in the
“seal” style in gold. An almost unique specimen of the highest style of
decoration during the period when the manufacture of porcelain had reached
its highest point.

This bow] from its decoration was undoubtedly intended for use in the
palace on the occasion of an imperial birthday. The peach is one
of the emblems of longevity, from a legend which traced them to the
gardens of the fairy Hsi Wangmu, where they ripened but once in
three thousand years, and conferred that term of life upon those who
were fortunate enough to taste them. The legend runs thus: ‘In
the first year of the period Yiian féng inthe Hau dynasty (B.C. 110)
the fairy Hsi Wang had descended from her mountain realm to visit
the Emperor Wu Ti, bringing with her seven peaches. She ate two
of the number, and, upon the Emperor expressing a wish to preserve
the sced, sabe told him that the tree from which they came bore once

only in three thousand yeurs, but each fruit conferred three centuries
of life upon the eater. At that moment she perceived Tung Fang—
peeping at her through the window, and so, pointing to him, said:
‘That child whom you see yonder has stolen three of my peaches
and is now nine thousand years old.’”* The gum of the’ peach-tree
mixed with mulberry ash is used as an elixir vite by the Taoists.t

The decoration on the outside is an adaptation of the allegorical repre-
sentation of the prayer for ‘‘ happiness, cistinction, and longevity”
(fu-lao-show), met with in Chinese paintings under many forms, but
always with the same general characteristics. One of the immortals,
the great sage Lao Tz’u, accompanied by attendants, the crane
(Grus viridirostris Veillot), the stag, the hairy tortoise, all emblems of
long life; another, Li ’Tich-Kuai, with attendants, evolving from a
gourd contracted at the center, five bats, emblematic of the five bless-
ings—longevity, riches, peacefulness and serenity, the love of virtue,
and an end crowning the life—the Chinese characters for bat and
happiness having the same pronunciation.

28-31. Plates (4) of white porcelain. Hsi Wang Mu, depicted as a beautiful female
in the ancient Chinese dress, is represented accompanied by one of her at-
tendant maidens holding a tray containing peaches and other articles, and
by the spotted stag, symbelical of longevity, very delicately painted in enamel
colors. The rim is ornamented with a narrow band in vermilion red of de-
tached flowers of the Chinese peony (Pwonia Moutan) and of butterflies.
Mark Ta-Ming-ch’eng-hua-nien-chih, ‘‘ Made during the Ch’énghua period (1465
to 1487) of the great Ming or Bright (dynasty);” the colors and style of
painting, however, point rather to the K’anghsi period as that of their manu-

Hsi Wang Mu, literally Royal Mother of the West, is the legendary
queen of the Genii, who is supposed to have dwelt in a palace in
Central Asia among the K’unlun Mountains, where she held court
with her fairy legiuns. Upon some slight allusions to this personage
in earlier works the philosopher Lieh Tz’u, in the fifth century, B.
C., based a fanciful and perhaps allegorical tale of the entertain-
ment with which King Mu of the Chou dynasty was henored and en-
thralled by the fairy qneen during his famous journeyings B. C. 985.
In later ages the superstitious vagaries of the Emperor Wu Ti of the
Hau dynasty gave rise to innumerable fables respecting the alleged
visits paid to that monarch by Hsi Wang Mn and her fairy troop;
and the imagination of the Taoist writers of the ensuing centuries
was exercised in glowing descriptions of the magnificence of her
mountain palace. Here, by the borders of the Lake of Gems, grows
the peach-tree of the Genii, whose fruit confers the gift of immor-
tality, bestowed by the goddess upon the favored beings admitted
to her presence, and hence she dispatches the azure-winged birds,
Cl’ing-niao, which serve, like Venus’ doves, as her attendants and
messengers. In process of time a consort was found for her in the
person of Tung Wang Kung, or King Lord of the East, whose name
is designed in obvious imitation of her own, and who appears to owe
many of his attributes to the Hindoo legends respecting India. By
the time of the Sung dynasty (the tenth century, A. D.) a highly
mystical doctrine respecting the pair, represented as the first created
and creative results of the powers of nature in their primary process
of development, was elaborated in the Kuang-Chi. The more sober re-
search of modern writers leads to the suggestion that Wang Mu was
the name either of a region or of a sovereign in the ancient West. *

32, 33. Bowls (a pair), everted, of thin white K’anghsi porcelain decorated with the
eighteen Lohan or Arhats in groups, very delicately painted in vermilion.
Mark as in No. 26. Height, 22 inches; diameter, 6 inches.

In his ‘‘ Hand-book of Chinese Buddhism,” Dr. Eitel states that the orig-
inal meaning of Arhal (‘‘ deserving”) is overlooked by most Chinese
commentators, who explain the term as though it were written Arihat,
“destroyer of the enemy,” i.e., of the passions, and ‘‘not to be re-
born,” i. e., exempt from transmigration. A third explanation, based
on the original conception, is ‘‘deserving of worship.” The Arhat
is the perfected Arya, and can therefore only be attained by passing
through the different degrees of saintship. It implies the possession
of supernatural powers, and is to be succeeded either by Buddhaship
or by immediate entrance into Nirvana. In popular acceptation,
however, it has a wider range, designating not only the perfected
saint, but all the disciples of S’Akyamuni, and thus it includes not
only the smaller circles of cighteen and five hundred disciples, but
also the largest circle of one thousand two hundred.

The first Saitra (that of forty-two sections) was translated into Chinese
in the year A. D. 67, during the time of the Later or Eastern Han
dynasty, whose capital was at Loyang in Honan province, by Kas’-
yapa Matanga, a disciple of S’Akyamuni, who entered China with
Han Ming-ti’s embassy on its return from Badakshan. By its means
the Buddhist doctrines first became known in China. Such transla-
tions from the Sanskrit form the earliest and still continue to be the
most important part of Chinese Buddhistic literature; but from the
fifth century onward they have been supplemented by original com-
positions in the Chinese language from the pens of native adherents
to that religion. During the first eight centuries of the existence of
the Buddhistic religion in China the smallest circle of S’Akyamuni’s
disciples comprised the same number as in India, sixteen, which was
increased under the T’ang dynasty, in the ninth century, A. D., by
the enrollment of two additional disciples to its present complement
in China—eighteen.

34, 35. Bowls (2), everted, of thin white K’anghsi porcelain. Replicas of Nos. 32, 33,
but of larger size. Mark, same as in No. 26. Diameter, 6? inches.

36. Wine-cup, tall, everted, of thin white K‘anghsi porcelain; ornamentation: Be-
tween borders of Grecian pattern are diamond-shaped panels containing the
pa-hua, in deep-blue under transparent glaze. Mark, as above. Height, 3
inches; diameter, 34 inches. ;

The pa-kua, or eight diagrams, are the combinations which may be formed
of three lines, whole or divided into two equal parts. They are stated
to have been developed by Fuh-hi, the legendary founder of Chinese
polity, who is believed to have lived from B. C. 2852 to 2738 by aid
of a plan or arrangement of figures revealed to him on the back of a
‘‘dragon-horse.” These eight figures, which can be traced back to
the two primary forms representing the first development of the Yin
and Yang (the primordial essences) from the Ultimate Principle,
together with certain presumptive explanations attributed to Fuh-hi,
were the basis, according to Chinese belief, of an ancient system of
philosophy and divination during the centuries preceding the era of
Wén Wang (twelfth century B. C.), but of which no records have
been preserved beyond the traditional names of its schools. Wén
Wang, the founder of the Chou dynasty, while undergoing imprison-
ment (B. C. 1144) at the hands of the tyrant Shou, devoted himself
to study of the diagrams, and appended to each of them a short ex-
THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. 453

planatory text. These explanations, with certain amplifications by
his son, Chou Kung, constitute the work known as the ‘ Book of
Changes” of the Chou dynasty, which, with the commentary added
by Confucius, forms the Yih Ching, “‘ the Canon of Changes,” the most
venerated of the Chinese classics. In this work, which serves as a
basis for the philosophy of divination and geomancy, and is largely
appealed to as containing not alone the elements of all metaphysical
knowledge but also a clue to the secrets of nature and of being the
entire system reposed npon these eight diagrams, a ceaseless process
of revolution is held to be at work, in the course of which the various
elements or properties of nature indicated by the diagrams mutually
extinguish and give birth to one another, thus producing the phe-
nomena of nature.*

37. Vase of white K‘anghsi porcelain, in the shape of a gourd contracted in the middle
(hu-hw), having a vine trailing over it, from which hang large bunches of
grapes on which a squirrel is feeding, in various shades of blue under a trans-
parent glaze. Mark, as above. Height, 4% inches.

This is a well-known Chinese motive. ‘The first picture of the squirrel
and the vine” (says Anderson, catalogue of Japanese and Chinese
paintings in the British Museum, No. 747); ‘‘ appears to have been
painted by Wing Yiian-chang, a famous artist of the Sung dynasty,
A. D. 960 to 1259, and has been repeated by innumerable copies in
China and Japan.”

33, 39. Plates (a pair) of white K‘anghsi, having a large-sized character in center, be-
lieved to be Thibetan, surrounded on the sides by three concentric lines of
smaller characters of similar type; on outside are three similar lines of char-
acters in deep blue under transparent glaze. Mark, as above. Diameter, 5%
inches,

40,41. Bowls (a pair) of thin white K‘anghsi porcelain. Ornamentation on outside
consists of a delicately-drawn band of waves on lower portion where bowl
springs from foot, with the pa-kua or eight diagrams (see No. 36) above. In-
side, within double circle, at bottom, the yin and yang, all in deep blue
under transparent glaze. Mark, as above. Height, 2? inches; diameter, 42
inches.

The circle represents the ultimate principle of ‘‘ being,” which is divided
by a curving line into two equal portions, the positive and negative
essences, yang and yin, respectively. Yang, the more lightly colored
portion, corresponds to light, heaven, masculinity, etc.; yin, the more
darkly colored, to darkness, earth, femininity, ete. To the introduc-
tion of these two essences are due all the phenomena of nature.

42, 43. Bowls (a pair), small, everted, of white K‘aughsi porcelain, plain inside.
Decorated on outside with iris, grasses, longevity fungus (ling chih, a species
of (?) poJyporus), tea-roses, and other flowers delicately painted in enamel
colors upon a brick-red or vermilion ground. Mark, K‘ang-hsi-zii-chih, ‘‘Made
by special order of Emperor K‘anghsi.” Height, 2} inches; diameter, 44
inches.

44, 45. Plates (a pair) of white K‘anghsi porcelain, having a ‘‘sitting” Imperial five-
clawed dragon on center, and similar flying dragons (see No. 4) amid clouds
around the shelving side. Engraved in the paste under a thick deep-blue glaze
(bleu de roi) which covers the entire plate inside and out, except the foot, on
which appears within a double circle Ta-ch‘ing KW ‘ang-hsi-nien-chih, ‘‘Made
during the K‘anghsi period of the Great Pure (the present) dynasty.” Diam-

eter, 9% inches.

46. Bowl, large, everted, of pure white I’anghsi porcelain, plain inside. On outside
is a branch of peach tree bearing fruit and leaves, the latter in all stages
from the light green of the newly burst leaf to the brown of the withered and
worm-eaten, admirably painted. On the branch is seated a large bird, termed
by the Chinese a paroquet, but having a red beak, brown breast, green
plumage around neck and below it, with brown on back, and black and
gray wings and tail. A finespecimen. Mark,as above. Height, 34 inches;
diameter, 8} inches.

47. 48. Wine-cups (a pair), small, with straight lips, of white K’anghsi porcelain,
covered outside with a monochrome dull glaze of violet magenta; plain in-
side, except at bottom, where are two plumsand some beans delicately painted.
Mark, as above. Height, 13 inches; diameter, 3} inches.

49-52. Bowls (4), everted, of white K‘anghsi porcelain, having Imperial five-clawed
flying dragons (v. No. 4) engraved in paste, over which are sprays of roses
and plum-blossoms, buds and leaves of various shades of green, open flowers
and butterflies alternately yellow and aubergine purple-brown under a trans-
parent glaze. Mark, as above. Height, 2? inches; diameter, 5 inches.

a3. Vase, of square body, contracting to form short, circular, everted neck, on which
above each side of the body is the character for “ longevity,” shou, in four out
of the hundred forms it may take in the ‘‘seal” style of writing. The four
sides of the body bear two paintings in the distinctive colors of la famille
verte, one of the famous club of the seven worthies of the bamboo grove
amusing themselves with music, chess, and wine; the other a historical scene
representing an ancient general on his way to attack the Man-tz’u, or South-
ern Chinese, giving audience during a halt upon the banks of the Yangste.
Between the paintings are lengthy disquisitions suggested by the subjects of
the drawings. As these are dated ‘the 29th day of the 9th moon of the year
of the cyclic characters Kwei mo,” i. e., 1703, it is justifiable to conclude that
is the date of the vase, that being the only year to which these characters
would apply during K‘anghsi’s reign to which the coloring shows it to belong.
Mark, a leaf. Height, 182 inches.

The club of the seven worthies of the bamboo grove was an association
of convivial men of letters, formed in the latter half of the third
century, who were accustomed to meet for learned discussions and
jovial relaxation in a grove of bamboos. The seven worthies were
Hsiang Tz’u-Ch‘i; Chi Shu-Zeh, a celebrated functionary and man of
letters, but no less renowned as a lover of the wine-cup and as a
musician. He was also an ardent devotee of alchemy. Incurring
the displeasure of Ss’u-ma Chao, minister of the last sovereign of the
house of Wri, he was executed as a propagator of magic arts and
heretical doctrines, when he showed his contempt of death by tun-
ing his guitar on the way to execution; Lin Po-lun, who was wholly
devoted to joviality and wished he could be accompanied by a grave-
digger to at once inter him, should he fall dead over his cups; Shan
Chii-yuan, a statesman, under Wu Ti of the T‘ang dynasty, cele-
brated for the patronage he extended to rising talent; Wang Chiin-
chung, a minister of Hwei Ti of the house of Chin, at once infamous
for his avarice and for having intrusted the discharge of his duties
to base underlings that he might abandon himself to a life of ex-
travagance and pleasure; Yiian Chung-jung, famous as a lover of
music and wine, and as a philosopher studying content and modera-
tion in preference to the ways of ambition; and Yiian Tz’u-tsung,
uncle of the last, a public functionary, but preferring the quietism
preached by the philosophers Lao-Hze and Chuang-Hze, whose fol-
lower he professed himself to be, to the toils of public life.*

54, 55. Plates (a pair) of white K‘anghsi porcelain, decorated inside with a painting
in natural colors of the great Taoist sage and philosopber Lao Yze, with
lofty head, seated under a tree; his attendant is preparing writing materials
for his use. Round the brim are the eight Buddhistic emblems joined by
conventional foliage of natural color, but of paler tones than the central
design. Mark, ason No. 44. Diameter, 64 inches.

Lao Tze was the founder of the Taoist system of philosophy. He is said
to have been surnamed Li and named Erh, but his history is almost
altogether legendary. His biography, as given by the great histo-
rian Ss’u-ma Chie, who wrote the first comprehensive survey of the
history of China from the legendary period of Huangti down to B.C.
104, contains, however, some particulars which may be considered
authentic. According to this account he was the keeper of the records
at Lo, the capital of the Chou dynasty, about the close of the sixth
century, B. C., and professed a doctrine of abstraction from worldly
cares based upon speculations regarding Tao, Reason, and Zé, Virtue.
This excited the curiosity of Confucius, who is said to have visited
him and to have retired disconcerted at his bold flights of imagina-
tion. The veracity of the statement regarding this meeting is, how-
ever, open to doubt. After a long period of service Lao Tze is said
to have retired to the West, after confiding to Yin Hsi, the keeper of
the frontier pass of Han Ku, a written statement of his philosophy,
the Tao-té-ching, or Classic of Reason and Virtue. Later mystics im-
proved upon this account by assigning a period of mythical antiquity
and a miraculous conception through the influence of a star to Lao
Tze’s birth, alleging him to have been the incarnation of the supreme
celestial entity. According to the Lieh-hsien-ch‘uan, an accountof the
Taoist genii, he became incarnate B. C., 1321, in the State of Ts‘u.
His mother brought him forth from her left side beneath a plum
tree, to which he at once pointed, saying: ‘‘I take my surname
(namely, Li, a plum) from this tree.” When born his head was white
and his countenance that of an aged man, from which circumstance
he derived his name of Lao Tze, the Old Child. The remainder of
the account resembles that given above, except that he is made to
live for centuries, eventually retiring to the West about B. C., 1080.
No countenance is given, however, in the writings ascribed to his
pen to supernaturalism of any kind, and the legends regarding his
life have evidently been largely colored by the accounts given by
Buddhistic writers of the lifeof SXakyamuni. ‘The ideas contained in
the Tao-té-ching of Lao Tze, which has been translated into English,
French, and German, are thus summed up by Mr. Mayers (op. cit.,
No. 336): ‘‘Creation proceeding from a vast, intangible, impersonal
first principle, self-existent, self-developing, the mother of all things.
The operation of this creative principle fulfilled in the nature of man,
the highest development of which again is to be sought for in a re-
turn through ‘quietism’ and ‘non-action’ to the mother principle.
The highest good is accordingly to be enjoyed in a !ranscendental
abstraction from worldly cares, or freedom from mental perturbation.
In a doctrine such as this it is not difficult to trace at least a super-
ficial likeness to the theories of Brahminism, and whether originally
derived from Hindu thought or not it is probable that the culti-
vation of Lao Tze’s teachings had a potent influence in preparing
the way for an influx of the metaphysical speculations of Indian
philosophers to satisfy a mental craving not provided for in the sim-
ple materialism which Confucius expounded. At least the latitude

allowed by the vagueness of Lao Tze’s writings both enabled and en-
couraged hjs so-called disciples and adherents to graft upon the lead-
ing notions of his text an entirely adventitious code of natural and
psychical philosophy, which, on the one hand, expanded into a sys-
tem of religious belief, a simple travesty of Buddhism, and, on the
other, became developed into a school of mysticism, founded appar-

_ ently upon the early secrets of the professions of healing and divina-
tion, from whence it rose to occult researches in the art of transmut-
ing metals into gold and insuring longevity or admission into the
ranks of the genii. ‘To all these Professions and pretensions the title
of the religion or teachings of Tao was given, although they were in
reality in no wise countenanced by the doctrines of Lao Tze himself.
His professed disciples, Lieh Tze and Chuang’7Tze in the fourth cen-
tury, and Huai Nan Tze in the second century B. C., progressively de-
veloped the mystic element thus introduced, and a notable impetus
accrued to it from the superstitious belief with which the pretensions
of the alchemists were received by the Emperor, Wu Ti, from whose
period onward the reverence paid to the founder of the sect began to
assume a divine character.” In A. D. 666 he was for the first time
ranked among the gods, being canonized by the Emperor as ‘“‘ The
Great Supreme, the Emperor of. the Dark First Cause,” and _ his title
was again enlarged in 1013. The achievement of corporeal immor-
tality having been the chief aim of the sect named after him, the
founder, Lao Tze, naturally came to be considered the God of Longev-
ity, and as such he figures in all the paintings symbolical of a prayer
for ‘‘ dignity, happiness, and long life,” being usually depicted as an
aged man leaning upon a staff, his head being of abnormally lofty
proportions.

The pa-chi-hsiang or “ Hight lucky Emblems” are of Buddhistic origin
and derived from India. Formed in clay or of wood, they are offered
on Buddhistic altars, and largely enter into the architectural deco-
ration of the temples. They are found with variations both of esnpe
and of detail. In their ordinary form they are:

(1) A bell (chung), or more usually a wheel (lun), chakra, the wheel of
the law, with fillets.

(2) A univalve shell (lo), the chank shell of the Buddhists, with fillets.

(3) A state umbrella (san), with fillets.

(4) A canopy (kai), with fillets.

(5) A lotus-flower (lien-hua), without fillets; sometimes represented as a
Peonia montan.

(6) A vase with cover (kuan), with fillets.

(7) Two fishes (erh yii), united by fillets. Said by some to be figurative
of domestic happiness.

(8) An angular knot with fillets, termed ch‘ang, the intestines, an emblem
of longevity.

Another style of decoration, also consisting of eight emblems, is that
known as the pa-pao, ov “eight precious things;” they vary consid-
erably in form, and the explanations of their meaning are unreliable
and conflicting. ‘The more usual forms, all of which bear fillets, are:
(1) an oblate spherical object (chén), representing a pearl; (2) a
hollow disk inelosing an open square, possibly a copper cask em-
blematical of riches; (3) an open lozenge, placed horizontally ; (4)
a lozenge placed horizontally, with a section of a second lozenge in
the upper angle; (5) an object resembling in shape a mason’s square
—the sonorous stone ching, emblematic by symphony of ‘‘ good-

ness,” ‘‘happiness;” (6) two oblong objects placed side by side, pos-
sibly books; (7) two rhinoceros’ horns shaped into quadrangular
form; (8) a leaf of the Artemisia, an emblem of good augury. Other
forms found in these emblems are a branch of coral, a silver ingot,
a cake of ink; and the shell, lotus-flower, and fishes belonging prop-
erly to the “‘ eight lucky emblems.”

56,57. Plates (a pair)of thin pure white K‘anghsi porcelain, having a flying Féng huang
and an Imperial five-clawed dragon (see No. 4) amid clonds contained by a floral
scroll pattern within bands, all engraved in the paste. Round the rim is a
border of bats set close to one another in vermilion red; and in center, within
a medallion, are the characters hung-fu-ch‘i-t‘ien, ‘‘ great happiness fills the
heaven,” in the old seal form engraved in the paste from beneath the foot,
but reversed so that they read correctly on the upper side of the plate.
Mark, Ta-ch‘ing-k‘ang-hsi nien-chih, ‘Made during the K‘anghsi period of the
great Pure Dynasty.” Diameter, 7% inches.

58, 59. Plates (a pair) of white K‘angnhsi porcelain, for use on “birthday occa-
sions in the palace. The ornamentation consists in the center of the
plate of a large show (longevity) character in blue, containing a pointed
peach of the genii in enamel glaze, upon which is represented a stork (Grus
viridirostis Veillot) in blue (the peach and stork being emblems of immortal-
ity, see No. 27). Round this medallion is entwined conventional foliage in
enamel colors, branching apart to afford eight spaces, in which are alter-
nately a peach and the character show in gold on blue medallion. Outside,
on the rim, light-green bamboo stalks spring from rocks on which grow the
red fungus of the immortals (ling chih). Mark as in last. Diameter, 8}
inches.

60. Vase, circular in shape, of white K‘anghsi porcelain, belonging to the famille
verte. On it is represented a garden with a pavilion in the rear. In it the
Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove (see No. 53) are depicted engaged in
chess-playing, music, and writing upon the rocks, the main picture being
confined by bands of arabesque ornament interrupted by panels, containing
scholars’* requisites, books, scrolls, etc., and above around the neck, a rod-

fishing scene. Mark as above. Height, 18+ inches.

61-68. Panels (8) of white K‘anghsi porcelain, bearing representations of famous
scenes from the celebrated historical novel, ‘‘ San kuo-chih, or Records of the
Three Kingdoms.” This work, the most popular of its kind in China, details
the triangular contest engaged in for the throne between Liu’ Pei, assisted
by Chu- Ko hiang, Chang Fei, and Kuan Yii and Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, after his defec-
tion from Liw’ Pei, and the Sun family, which resulted in the partition of
the Empire among the houses of Han of Szechuen, of Wu and of Wei, founded,
respectively, by Liu Hsiian-té, Sun Chung-mon and Ts‘ao Méng-té (A. D.
220 to 280). é

69-76. Panels (8) of white K‘anghsi porcelain decorated with flowers and butterflies
in enamel colors and gold, surrounded by a border of the same upon a pale-
green ground picked out with black.

These panels were originally in the form of bricks of about an inch and
a quarter thickness. It was customary in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries for princes to have large couches, 6 to 8 feet in
length and having two end pieces, of ebony beautifully carved. The
one I have seen had five of these square porcelain panels or bricks
let into the back with a circular panel above the central one of
the five, and one in either end piece. They were so fixed by means
of square projections from the wood-setting which fitted into corres-

ponding holes left for the purpose in the bricks that one surface
showed on either side of the setting with a rich and pretty effect,
one surface displaying some historical scene, the other a group of
flowers. Good specimens are now comparatively rare, and are now
much sought after by foreigners to saw in half for the manufacture
of cache-pots.

77,78. Panels (2) of white K‘anghsi porcelain, of similar origin to the above, but of
inferior style of painting.

79. Brick (small) of white K‘anghsi porcelain, showing the appearance of Nos. 61 to
78 in their original condition, before the surface-plates had been sawn away
from the central portion into which fitted the wooden projections serving to
keep the porcelain ornamentation in its position in the couch.

80. Vase of white K‘anghsi porcelain; shape, slender potiche. The ornamentation in
chief seems to depict a young officer leaving his post after a virtuous tenure
of office, which has won for him not only promotion from the Emperor but
also the love ofthe people he has ruled over. A young man dressed in pink is
represented riding a piebald horse. (In the time of K‘anghsi the Manchu
officers despised and ridiculed Chinese luxury and ceremony, and with them
the Sedan-chairs they have in later days adopted, with almost all else that is
Chinese, from the conquered nation ; and rode on horseback with but few
attendants.) Over him an attendant is holding an official umbrella, which
from its three flowers of different colors would appear to be a wau-ming-san,
or “umbrella of ten thousand names,” an offering made to a virtuous and
upright officer on his departure from his post by a grateful people, and so
called from the fact that it bears upon it the names of the donors either
embroidered or in black velvet appliqué. He is preceded by men bearing
lanterns and followed by an attendant carrying a scroll wrapped in Imperial
yellow silk, indicative of a communication from the throne. Round the part
where the vase diminishes in size runs a band of floral pattern on a pink
ground interrupted by panels containing grotesque representations of
dragons, the whole bounded on either side by bands of a geometric pattern in
blue—all painted seemingly above the glaze. Nomark. Height, 10% inches.

81. Vase of pure white K‘anghsi porcelain, tall, the body bellying out from the foot
and then gradually tapering upwards. On one side is a character show
(longevity), on the other the character fu (happiness) in a diaper pattern in
black upon a dark-enamel green. In the center of either of these characters
is a medallion about 4 inches in diameter, containing mythological represen-
tations appropriate to the character in which it is placed. On the former is
the Genius of Longevity (as Lao Tze, see No. 54) riding a white stork into the
midst of the Immortals. On the latter Tung Wang Kung, the consort of the
Queen of the Fairies (see No. 28), is handing a baby the elixir of life, while
another of the sages stands by holding the ju-i. Where the body of the vase
springs from the foot is a band of formal geometric pattern and around rim
is a border of flowers on dark grey ground interrupted by white panels in-
closing flowers, the whole supported by a narrow band of geometrical design.
A beautiful specimen of K‘anghsi ware. Height, 16+ inches.

The ju-i is a curved baton, generally carved in jade or some other valua-
ble material. It is probably of Buddhistic origin as it is one of the
seven precious things (Sansk. Sapta Ratna) and appears in Buddhist
pictures in the hands of priests of high rank. It is also regarded as
a symbol of the power of the faith. In China it is commonly
considered an emblem of good luck, its name signifying “ (May
all be) as you wish,” and is therefore frequently used as a present
to friends or at a wedding. It is also a sign of authority, owing
to the fact that it is believed to have been used in India as a scepter. _

82. Vase of pure white K‘anghsi porcelain, tall, circular in shape, the outline rising
almost perpendicularly but with a slight slope outwards, then contracting
gracefully to neck, which everts at brim. A child holding in his hand a
pink lotus flower (Nelumbium speciosum) is being presented to a tall Rishi
(? Lao Tze) standing, dressed in embroidered robes of pink, with Tung
Wang Kung (see No. 28) dressed in robes of yellow and blue and holding in his
hand the peach of the Genii. On neck are sprays of bamboo and the fungus
(ling chih) of the Immortals. A very beautiful specimen of K‘anghsi ware.
The figures are quite large, Lao Tze being 8 inches in height, and painted
with considerable force and attention to detail. Height, 174 inches.

83. Vase of white porcelain, small, with swelling body suddenly contracting to form
long, tapering neck, covered with the deep red glaze, known as lang yao or
sang-de-beuf, which has retreated from brim, though vase is colored inside.
No mark. Height, 44 inches.

84, Vase of wuite porcelain, pen-shaped with short, narrow, everted neck. Covered
with a deep green glaze, termed by the Chinese lu-lang-yao or green lang
ware, the lang in the case of this specimen and of the last perpetuating,
according to the statement of Chinese dealers, the first syllable of the sur-
name of a Jesuit missionary who is credited with the invention of the com-
position used in these glazes. (See Glazes ante). The glaze is coarsely crackled
inside and out. This is the only specimen of green lang-yao I have ever seen
or heard of. Nomark. Height, 73 inches.

85,86. Plates (a pair) of pure white Yungchéng (1723 to 1735) porcelain. Ornamen-
tation consists of two branches of the peach tree, one bearing pink, the
other white blossoms. The branches spring from the foot, and, after
spreading over the outside, cress the brim to cover the inside. Five
peaches, varying from deep red at the pointed end to green near stem,

As each artist gives some more or less romatic designation to his studio,
so the Emperor and Princes give some fanciful name to their palace,
or a portion of it, which is not unfrequently found upon porcelain
specially made for use in a special hall or pavilion, or for use by the
owner of the “hall.” In this case Fwi-ss’u-t‘ang was the designation
given to a portion of his palace by the Imperial Prince Ho, living
during Yungchéng’s reign, who enjoyed one of the eight titles of
hereditary princedom by biood royal conferred upon as many of the
most noted Manchu captains at the time of the conquest of China.
These hereditary princes. are commonly termed ‘‘ Iron-helmet
princes,” and the distinction is one very seldom conferred since.
During the present reign an exception has been made, as a reward
for his distinguished services, in favor of Prince Kung, who for a
quarter of a century was head of the Board of Foreign Affairs.

of miniatures. Attached is a metrical inscription to the following effect:

““ Above a sheer abyss crag o’erhangs crag,
Whose heads aloft fn purple distance soar,
Whose look to mind recalls the five Star-gods
Who help’d great Shun to rule in days of yore;
And shay glens betwixt form cool retreats
Where sages meet to con their mystic lore.”

It is recorded that the ‘‘Five Old Men,” the spirits of the Five Planets,
appeared at Court B. C. 2246, and assisted the Emperor Shun with
their counsels till he abdicated in favor of Yii, when they disap-
peared. Shn then dedicated a temple to the five planets and offered
sacrifices in their honor, whereupon ‘five long stars” appeared in
the heavens with other auspicious signs.

169. Cup of pure white Yuugchéng porcelain of circular shape, everted. Decoration

Emperor himself) with two attendants descending the steps of a pavilion
built under the shade of wide-spreading trees, and bearing in his arms the ju-i,
oremblem of power, to meet a military officer, who, having just dismounted
from his horse, around which stand subordinate officers and attendants,
is advancing to meet the former. The inscription Ch‘u-chiang-ju-huang-chih-
pei, ‘‘Cup of him who departed as General and returned as Grand Secre-
tary,” shows the cup to have been ordered by the Emperor to confer upon
some high officer who had been commander-in-chief in some war, and who
had been invested with the high distinction of grand secretary upon his return
crowned with victory. It should be added that in China military officers
always occupy a relatively lower rank than do civil officers, and that
the dignity of grand secretary, of which there are four, is the highest to
which any subject, not of princely rank, can attain. Who the officer so
honored in this instance was has not been as yet determined. Apart from
the intrinsic interest attaching to such a specimen, the cup is remarkable
for the miniature-like delicacy and wealth of detail which characterize the
painting. Mark Asii-hua-t‘ang-chih-taéng, ‘‘Made for MHsii-hua Pavilion

longevity (ling-chih), surmounted by svastika; around the rim another band
of delicate foliated scroll-work. Mark asin last. Height, 5% inches.

The svastika is a mystic diagram of great antiquity. It is mentioned in
the Ramayana and found in the well temples of India, as well as
among all the Buddhistic people of Asia, and, as the emblem of Thor,
among Teutonic races. In China it is the symbol of the Buddha’s
heart, i. e., of the Esoteric doctrines of Buddhism, and is the special
mark of all deities worshipped by the Lotus school.

Vases (2) of pure white Chienlung porcelain. The shape resembles that of a
pear, swelling gently as it rises until it suddenly contracts to terminate in
a short, narrow, everted neck. At neck a light formal pattern, below which
is a collar of scroll-work in panel form. Upon the body are sprays of peony
(Peonia Moutan), plum-blossom, and chrysanthemum above, and below
branches, each bearing fine fruits, of pomegranate, peaches, and lichees;
confined at foot by a deep band of upright leaves—all in deep blue, shaded,

one of plum-blossom, and one of pine. Mark as in last. Height, 2% inches;
diameter, 5} inches.

P’énglai-shan (Mount Horai of the Japanese) was one of the three isles of
the Genii, supposed to lie off the eastern coast6f China, in which flowed
the fountain of life in a perpetual stream, giving sempiternal vigor
to the happy denizens of this paradise who drank its waters. The
pine, the bamboo, the plum, the peach, and the fungus of longevity
grew forever on its shores; the long-haired tortoise disported in
its rocky inlets, and the white crane built her nest in the limbs of
its everlasting pines. All these have thus come to be emblematical of
long life. The first three, however, are almost always found in com-
bination under the title of sung-chu-mei (pine, bamboo, and plum);
the remainder either separately and alone or as adjuncts to the ap-
propriate genii.

Vases (2) of white Chienlung porcelain of potiche shape, but with everted
neck, requiring no cover; bearing ornamentation of bats, emblematical of
happiness, and lotus flowers with formal foliage interlacing of various shades

roses and chrysanthemums painted in deep blue under thick, transparent
glaze, leaving three medallions of pure milk white, on which as open-work;
chrysanthemums and bamboos, roses, and plum blossoms are respectively
molded with great delicacy in relief under thick white glaze. Round the pro-
jecting edge at neck runs a foliated scroll engraved in relief under a white

of varied colors outlined in gold. This main decoration is confined at foot
by a deep border of formal foliated scroll pattern in brick red on a yellow
ground, and at base of neck, by a narrow border of same; from which
springs a crown of banana leaves of light green veined with gold and out-

to whom a boy dressed in pink is presenting on bended knee a bat, while
four other bats hover in the air, well painted under a brilliant glaze. No
mark. Height 142 inches.
A common motive with Chinese artists is the presentation to Lao Tze (sea
No. 54), the great philosopher and founder of the Taoist sect, of an
immortality peach, by Tung Wang Kung, the consort of the legend-
ary Queen of the Fairies, Hsi Wang Mu, or by one of his attend-
ants, on the Sage’s arrival at her mountain palace in the K’unlun
range (see No. 28). The same subject is here depicted, a bat re-
placing the peach. Since the pronunciation of the character for
““bat” is the same as of that for “ happiness,” the five bats sym-
bolize the ‘‘ five blessings or happinesses.” Lao Tze is receiving the
first, ‘‘longevity ;” the remaining four, riches, peacefulness and se-
renity, love of virtue, and an end crowning the life, hover over his
head.

foliate scroll-work. Round the neck is a border partly of geometrical pat-
tern, partly of foliate scroll-work; above, in middle panel, a medallion of

ground color of the vase is brown aubergine, covered throughout with a
brilliant transparent glaze. The date is uncertain, but the style of decora-
tion indicates that it may belong to a period considerably anterior to Chein-
lung’s reign; it certainly is not of a later date. Height, 154 inches.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Yang Kuei-fei, the daughter of an obscure official in the modern Szeehuen,
was introduced by the designing minister Li Liu-fu into the seraglio
of the Emperor Ming Huang, of the T‘ang dynasty (died A. D. 762),
Becoming enamored of her beauty, the Emperor abandoned the wise
counsels of Chang Yiich, Chang Chin-ling, and other ministers,
under whose administration the empire enjoyed great prosperity, and
sank, year by year, more deeply in the toils of amorous dalliance.
The Princess Yang’s three sisters were also introduced into the
seraglio and endowed with valuable fiefs. No outlay was spared in
gratifying the caprices and covetousness of his family of favorites,
and the nation was sacrificed to the licentious enjoyment of the
court, till at last the people rose. in revolt, the aged monarch was
forced to take refuge in western China and, after undergoing the
misery of witnessing the butchery of his favorites, to abdicate in
favor of his son.

Hsi Shih, the daughter of humble parents, but the ne plus ultra of loveli-
ness in Chinese tradition. A report of her consummate beauty
having reached the ears of her sovereign, Kon Chien, Prince of Yiich,
a state occupying the east coast of China below the Yangtsze in the
fifth century B.C., he had the girl trained in all the accomplish-
ments of her sex and sent her as a present to his victorious rival, the
Prince of Wu, in the hope that her charms might prove his ruin.
The stratagem was successful and Fu Ch’a, Prince of Wu, abandon-
ing himself to lustful dalliance, was ere long defeated and crushed.
It is said of Hsi Shih that finding her beauty was enhanced by an air
ot melancholy, she was accustomed to knit her brows as though in
pain, and this device, adding as it did to her attractiveness, was
copied by rival beauties who vainly sought to equal her charms. *

handle just below neck, which is of same shape as that of the body of vase.
Covered with splotches, which have run into another, of several dull colors,
black, bottle-green, and deep lake, giving the appearance of mottled agate,
under a thick glaze. The porcelain in coarsely crackled like ice. No mark.
Height, 54 inches.

frame-work of bottle-green hue. Outside similar splotches are arranged reg-
ularly around brim. A curious variety of flambé style. No mark. Diame-
ter, 92 inches. ;

The use of spiked metal supports to keep vessels of porcelain in position
within the kiln has been generally considered peculiar, in the East,
to the Japanese system of manufacture. The marks of a seven-
spiked stand on the feet of these plates show, however, that metal
supports within the seggars have also, at least occasionally, been
employed by the Chinese.

276. Vase of white Chienlung porcelain, of slender bulbous shape with long taper-
ing neck, of the flambé variety. From its appearance one would judge the
decoration to consist of a deep red ground on which has been blown (souflé)
a blue and white composition, which had formed a multitude of closely packed
blue and white circles, of irregular edge owing to their having run in the

K baking, under a thick, brilliant vitreous glaze. At mouth the color has dis-
appeared, discovering the white porcelain under a crackled glaze. Lower
down inside the color re-appears. Nomark. A veryfinespecimen. Height,
16 inches.

277. Vase of pure white Chienlung porcelain, of bulbous shape with long neck
ending with a small globe. Inside without color. Outside it is entirely

about mouth. Nomark. Anexceptionally finespecimen. Height, 132 inches.

278. Fish-bowl (small) of white Chienlung porcelain, globular, colored sang-de-beuf
under a deep vitreous glaze. Rim white; then, on inside, red close to rim,
and lower down where glaze has run in baking, streaked—of good color. No
mark. Height, 3 inches.

279. Vase of white Chienlung porcelain. Globular in shape, upper part of globe
being cut at an angle of 45° to long neck which everts at mouth. On either
side of neck is a handle formed by an elephant’s head with inward curved
trunk molded in relief on the paste. Covered with flambé colors, red, blue,
and white, which both inside and out merge into one another, each predomi-
nating in turn, under a thick vitreous glaze pitted like orange-peel. Mouth
rim remains white. No mark. Height, 144 inches.
478 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

280. Vase of white Chienlung porcelain, in shape of an inverted bulb, with small
low neck covered with blue, red, and white flambé. Predominating color is
red, but mottled with purple tints with blue and white appearing in places,
under deep vitreous glaze pitted like orange-peel. No mark. Height, 8
inches.

251-284. Screen panels of white Chienlung porcelain. ‘Two central panels, each 232
inches high by 94 inches broad, are flanked on either side by a panel of same
height and 51 inches broad. On these is depicted, beautifully painted, Lao
Tze, with lofty forshead and flowing white beard, in the mountain home of
the Immortals, receiving two children riding the stag of longevity, with other
children playing around, and genii coming to pay homage to the great
sage, some on foot descending the mountains, some approaching on clouds,
with Hsi Wang Mu herself preceded by her attendant birds (see No. 28)
Around are twelve panels 34 inches wide and in length some 94 inches and
some 112 inches, covered with formal lotus flowers and conventional scroll-
like foliage, all in natural colors. A very beautiful piece of furniture, the
frame being carved black wood.

285. Fish-bowl of thick white Chienlung porcelain, bulging gently from base to wide
open mouth. Among thick fleecy clouds of soufflé blue-black is a very boldly
drawn flying princely four-clawed dragon with row of large spines running
along back, body of slightly yellow tinge, the scales beneath belly, horns and
nose white. Nomark. Height, 8} inches; diameter, 102 inches.

286. Plate of enamel upon copper base; decorated with a painting of Wang Chih
watching two genii engaged in game of chess (see No. 18) under treein valley
between rising hills; confined above and below by band of foliated scroll pat-
tern in black, picked out with gold on a light-blue ground ; outside around
rim a foliated scroll pattern in blue on white ground. Mark, a féng hwang (see
No. 4). Diameter, 82 inches.

287. Plate of enamel upon copper base ; decorated with a painting of the famous poet
Li T‘ai-po, and companion in open country among rocks and trees engaged
in the enjoyment of wine, of which, to judge by the size of the blue jar in
background,they have a plentiful supply; outside decoration and mark same
as onlast. Both admirably painted. Diameter, 82 inches.

Li T‘ai-po (A. D. 699 to 762) is the most famous among the poets of China,
and scarcely less noted for his love of wine. The curiosity of the
Emperor Hsiian Tsung of the Sung dynasty having been aroused
by the accounts made to him of the poet’s genius, Li T‘ai-po was
summoned to an interview in the palace,where he was received with
exaggerated honors. The Emperor himself handed the dishes, his
favorite and haughty concubine was required to rub the ink for his
use, and the chief eunuch and privy counsellor, Kao Li-Ss‘u, had to
divest him of his boots when overcome by wine. The Emperor’s fay-
orite, smarting under the indignity to which she thought herself sub-
jected in his honor, barred the door to his official employment, and
Li T‘ai-po led ‘‘for the remainder of his life a wandering existence, .
celebrating in continual flights of verse the praises of bacchanalian
enjoyment and of the beauties of nature in the various localities he
visited.” (Mayers. )

288. Yea-pot and cover of earthenware from the Ni-hsing district in Kiangsu province.
Of globular shape much flattened. Round the lower portion are pine and
plum trees very delicately molded in bold crisp relief; above, separated by
a band of Grecian pattern incised in the paste, in single row of ‘‘old seal”
characters in relief, from which it appears that the tea-pot was made at the
special order of the Emperor Chienlung. On the cover is a scroll pattern,
in relief, confined on either side by a band of Grecian pattern, and round
the knob in the center is another band of same. A very beautiful specimen
of this ware. Height, 23 inches; diameter, 44 inches.

leaf with crinkled edge, of which one-half (that forming the receptacle for
water) turns up at edges, forming a smail basin, which is half covered by the
remainder of the leaf, arching over from the stalk. In the recess of the bent
leaf are a pink, a beetle, and a fly, of tiny dimensions painted with extreme
delicacy and care. The top of the stalk and veining of the leaf are incised
in the paste, and, owing to the thinness of the latter, appear in relief under-
neath. A most beautiful specimen. Height, 1 inch; length, 3} inches.

323. Snuff-bottle (small) of dull, opaque, white vitreous ware, of flat elongated potiche

shape, decorated with red lotus flowers and green leaves. Mark Ta-ch‘ing-
nien-chih, ‘‘ Made during the Great Pure dynasty,” the distinctive mark of the
earlier productions of Ku Yiich-hsiian. (See page 423.) This ware is so highly
esteemed by the Chinese that it sells for higher prices than would similar
articles of jade. Height, 2% inches.

324. Water-holder (small) of dull, opayue, white Ku Yiich-hsiian vitreous ware of

cylindrical shape. Decorated with a landscape very beautifully painted in
natural colors, representing a young shepherd clad in Chinese dress, but

_ whose features are unmistakably European, tending a ram and two ewes on

a grassy sward confined by lofty rocks, among which grow herbs and flower-
ing trees. The painting is characterized by all the delicacy of touch of a
miniature. Mark in form of a seal engraved in foot and filled with blue
enamel, Chien-lung-nien-chih, ‘‘Made in the Chienlung (17:36 to 1795) period.”
This and the next twelve specimens, i. e., down to No. 336, inclusive, were
made under the supervision of T‘ang ying (see page 419). Height, 1 inches ;
diameter, 14 inches.

$25. Pencil-holder of same ware, of cylindrical shape. Decorated with a group of

the Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove (v. No. 53) conversing together or

326. Wine-cup (small) of same ware. Round the foot is a band of delicate red scroll-

work on a yellow ground, with a very narrow band above of white foliate
pattern on black ground. This and a broader foliate pattern at rim of the
dull white color of the glass carefully shaded with straw-yellow upon a very
pale green ground, confine the body of the cup, on which a yellow scroll-work
forms two landscape panels. The intermediate spaces, slightly smaller than
the panels themselves, are completely filled with peonies, chrysanthemums,
convolvulus, lilies, asters, and many other flowers. A more artistic or deli-
cately beautiful ornamentation than this and that of the following cup it
would be difficult to find. Mark as on No. 324. Height, 1¢ inches; diame-

THE CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. 481

327. JWine-cup (small) of same ware. Round the foot is a band of same pattern as in
last with an arabesque pattern above in carmine on a pink ground. Within
this and a similar band around brim are delicate foliate patterns of the dull
white color of the glass shaded with light brown on a ground of the same
color, which confine the body of the cup. Here on a ground of the natural
color of the ware is a fine damask in olive-green supporting four panels confined
by yellow screll-work—two square and two oblong. The former contain
valley landscape scenes in winter season, and the latter similar scenes in
summer season, very delicately painted in deep pink or carmine. Mark as
on No. 324. Height, 12 inches; diameter, 2 inches.

328, 329. Rice-bowls (a pair) of thin, pure white Yungchéng (1723 to 1735) porcelain
covered with a very brilliant, transparent vitreous glaze to secure the delicate
transparency in the coloring remarkable in the Ku Yiich-hsiian ware (Nos.
323 to 327), and hence termed, as are Nos. 330 to 336, by the Chinese, fang-
ku-ziieh-hsiian, modeled after that ware. Decorated with branching sprays
of plum blossom beautifully drawn and shaded in sepia above the glaze,
the artist’s idea being explained by a stanza to the following effect:

The student sees the outline sharp
Of plum-bloom by the moonlight cast
On window blind, and breathes the scent
Of unseen flow’rets wafted past.
Mark as on No. 324. Height, 24 inches; diameter, 4% inches.

330. Tea-pot of pure white Chienlung porcelain of globular shape and covered with
brilliant vitreous glaze, upon which are very beautifully painted groups of
white and of pink lotus flowers, and leaves crinkled into many, but quite
natural, shapes and showing the dark upper and light lower sides, with buds
and seed-pods. On cover are groups of the same flowers and leaves arranged
in three clumps around the knob, which is a flattened globe bearing the
character show (longevity) in carmine. On tea-pot is the inscription: ‘‘ Pure
as the virtue of the perfect man,” that is, as jade, which from a passage in
the ‘‘ Classic of Ceremonial ” is considered the symbol of such virtue, “ har-
monious as the strength of him who fulfills all his duties to his fellow-men.”
Mark as on No. 324. Height, 4} inches.

331,332. Cups of same porcelain and bearing precisely the same decoration. No.
330 came from the collection of the Prince of I. Several months later these
corresponding cups, which doubtless at one time belonged to the same
owner, were purchased from among unclaimed goods in a Peking pawnshop.
Curiously enough, however, the seal attached to the inscription on the cups,
though this is evidently by the same hand as is that on the tea-pot, differs
from the seal on the latter. Height, 12 inches; diameter, 24 inches.

333, 334, Vases (a pair) of pure white Chienlung porcelain, Of flattened globular
shape, with slender neck representing half total height, and everted brim,
covered with brilliant vitreous glaze, on which the decoration is painted.
Around the foot is a band of light blue ornamented with delicate foliate
scroll in violet. Above the band runs another band of panel ornamentation
in carmine edged with dull green, which, with a band below neck of con-
ventional dragons, alternately green and pink, on a magenta ground, in-
close the body of the vase. This, on a deep blue ground, ornamented with
conventional clouds of yellow, green, blue, and red, and bats of pink shaded
with carmine, and of yellow shaded with orange, bears four medallions with
pure white ground of dazzling brilliancy, containing groups of flowers most
delicately painted—peonies and bamboos; lilies, longevity fungus, and red-
seeded heavenly bamboo (Nandina domestica), lilies and poppies, and yellow
hibiscus and green and red celeus. At foot of neck is a band of orange, the
neck itself being of lemon yellow ornamented with conventional flowers and
foliage in many colors, confined below by a band of foliated pattern in blue

very rich and harmonious effect. Mark as on No. 324. Height, 74 inches.

335. Bowl (small) with slightly everted brim of thin white Chienlung porcelain cov-
ered with brilliant vitreous glaze. On a pale lemon yellow ground are large

383. Of white Chienlung porcelain and of small potiche shape, decorated with plum
trees of the pink and white blossom varieties, perched on which and on
ground are one hundred magpies, symbolizing ‘‘a hundred, i. e. every kind of
happiness,” the magpie, from its merry-sounding chatter, being termed ‘the
bird of happiness.” Mark as on No. 380.

The magpie is especially dear to the present occupants of the throne of
China from the part it played in the divine origin of their first ances-
tor. ‘The Chinese chronicle runs as follows: ‘Immediately east of
the pumice peaks of the Ch‘ang-hai-Shan (Long White Mountain)
is a high mountain called Bukuli, at the foot of which is the small
lake or pool Buhuli. After bathing one day in this pool, the maiden
Li Fokolun found on the skirt of her raiment, placed there by a
magpie, a fruit which she ate, and which caused her to give birth to
a boy of an appearance different from ordinary people, whence she
called him You heaven-born to restore order to the disturbed nations.
His surname she called Aisin-Gioro, his name Bukuii-yung-shun.
She disappeared, and he, embarking ina small boat, floated with the
river stream. Inthe neighborhood of a place where peoples of three
surnames were at war, he disembarked, and was breaking off willow
branches, when one of the warriors, coming to draw water, saw him.
Amazed at his strange appearance, the warrior hastily retired to in-
form the people of the remarkable man he had seen. The curious
people went to the bank and asked his name and surname, to whom
he replied: I am the son of the heavenly maiden Fokolun, ordained by
heaven to restore peace among you, and thereupon they nominated him
king, and he reigned there in Odoli City,in the desert of Omohi,
east of Ch‘ang-hai-Shan.” Another version of the legend states that
there were three heavenly maidens Angela, Changhela, and Foko-
lun. The first two returned to heaven, while Fokolun remained on
earth to nurse the miraculous babe till he grew up. Then she told
him to wait till a man came to fish. The fisherman came and
adopted the boy, and Fokolun ascended to heaven. Pére Amyot,
from whom this account is taken, identifies Fokolun with a sixteen-
armed goddess whom he calls Pussa, or the Chinese Cybele, but
described at the present day as a Boddhisatwa, a celestial candidate
for Buddhahood. The story continues that Aisin-Gioro, in spite of
his heavenly birth, was put to death by his people, and only his
youngest son, Fancha, escaped by the aid of a magpie, which
alighted on his head as he ran and made his pursuers think him the
stump ofa tree. Fancha fled from Odoli across the Ch‘ang-hai-Shan
to Hotuala and there, some two centuries before the birth of Nur-
hachu, the first Manchu chieftain who took up arms against the
Chinese, he laid the foundations of the future dynasty of China.”

Ch‘én P‘ing was of very humble origin, but his virtue having brought
him into prominent notice he rose tohigh rank. Subsequently, like
Chang Liang, he espoused the cause of Lin Pang B. C. 205, and made
himself famous on six occasions by master strokes of policy, which
greatly aided the successful issue of the contest for the throne.

seized by the Ch‘in dynasty. He also espoused the cause of Lin Pang,
whose armies he commanded. After subjugating principality after
principality he was raised to princely rank, but having been accused

animal creation. It is said to attain the age of one thousand years,
and to be the emblem of perfect good, its apparition being consid-
ered the happy portent of good government, or of the birth of virtu-

THE EXPEDITION tO FUNK ISLAND, WITH OBSERVATIONS UPON THE
HISTORY AND ANATOMY OF THE GREAT AUK.

By Freperic A. LUCAS.

Norer.—In 1885 the writer suggested to Professor Baird the desirability of visiting
Funk Island for the purpose of obtaining remains of the Great Auk, but in view of
the attendant expense and many difficulties to be surmounted, the project was not
then carried out.

In 1887 Professor Baird decided to send the U. S. Fish Commission schooner Gram-
pus to northeastern Newfoundland and Labrador to investigate the truth of the many
reports of the abundance of mackerel in the adjacent waters, and since the route pro-
posed would take the vessel to the vicinity of Funk Island, the writer was detailed
to accompany the expedition.

The Grampus left Gloucester, Massachusetts, on July 2, andreturned to Wood’s Holl,
Massachusetts, on September 2, having visited the following places: the Magdalen
Islands, Bird Rocks, St. Johns, Newfoundland; Funk Island, Penguin Islands, off
Cape Freels; Seldom-Come-Ry, Fogo Island; Toulinguet, Canada Bay, Black Bay,
Labrador; Mingan Islands, and Percé, Canada.

So far as possible collections were made at these localities, and while in many the
fauna was extremely scanty, the material obtained was extremely valuable.

The collection of bones of the Great Auk obtained at Funk Island equaled in ex-
tent all other existing collections combined, and the opportunity was afforded for
thoroughly exploring this interesting spot for the first time.

Professor Baird never knew of the complete success of the expedition, and the sad
intelligence of his death reached the party at Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia, while
on its return.

A.—THE BriRD Rocks AND FuNK ISLAND IN 1887.

It is now about fifty years since the Great Auk succumbed to the
incessant persecution of man, disappeared almost simultaneously from
the shores of Europe and America, and became extinct.

Found along the coast of Newfoundland by the early explorers, the
countless myriads of this flightless fowl had been hunted to the death
with the murderous instincts and disregard for the morrow so charac-
teristic of the white race.

While from a strictly utilitarian stand-point there may be no reason
to mourn for the Great Auk, the naturalist can but regret its wanton
destruction and deplore the loss of so interesting a bird.

As the buffalo contributed to the opening of the great West, and the
Rhytina aided in the exploration of the northwest coast, the Great Auk
played its part in settling Newfoundland, and we may derive what con-
solation we can from Richard Whitbourne’s dictwm that “God mada
the innocency of so poor a creature to become such an admirable

instrument for the sustentation of man.”

494 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The early navigators, the French fishermen and the English colonists,
each availed themselves to the utmost of the store of this sea-fowl
which a (to the unfeathered bipeds) kindly Providence had placed at
their disposal.

For many years the birds were used for provision, both fresh and
salted, and probably for bait by the fishermen, but great as was the
drain made on the birds for these purposes it seems unlikely that this
alone would have caused their extermination in so short a time, as the
Great Auk was not such a delicacy that unusual eftorts would have
been made to obtain it.

The trade in feathers must probably be debited with having caused
the destruction of the species, for although there seem to be no data
showing when or why the demand for Auk feathers arose, there are ref-
erences to it in various works on Newfoundland, which seem to be cor-
roborated by the hundreds of thousands of Auks whose bodies were
left to molder on the heights of Funk Island.

Cartier, who visited this spot in 1534, makes mention of the bird under
the name of Apponath, and in the chronicles of voyages from 1536 on-
ward, it is frequently spoken of under the title of Penguin.*

There is reason to believe that the Garefowl was abundant at Pen-
guin Islands, off Cape la Hune, on the southern coast of Newfound-
land, and although it is difficult to certainly identify this as the Island
of Penguins mentioned by Master Robert Hore, there is in this case
something in a name.

Names, however, are by no means to be relied upon unless supported
by other evidence, and there is great difficulty in definitely locating
many of the places mentioned in the early chronicles.

A spot might receive several names from several different parties, or,
as in the present instance, several places might be christened alike.
Again, it has frequently happened in Newfoundland that French and
Portuguese names have been so altered by the English colonists as to be
quite unrecognizabie. Thus Cape Race of to-day was originally Cappa
Razza, the flat cape; Cappa Speranza hides its identity under the com-
monplace name of Cape Spear, and Bai d’ Espoir is hopelessly lost as
Bay Despair.

_ However abundant the Great Auk may have been elsewhere, Funk
Island seems to have been its chief breeding place, and here it doubt-

“The name Penguin was first applied to the Great Auk; its application to members
of the Spheniscide came afterwards.

The name Apponath, according to Cartier, was applied by the natives to a species
of bird, supposably the Great Auk, that he found in great abundance at the Island of
Birds (Funk Island).

These natives were very likely the Beothuces, although, making due allowance for
the twists a word receives in being adopted into a new language, the term Apponath
may have come from the Eskimo word agpa, an Auk.

The Eskimo for the Great Auk was isarokitsok, he that has little wings; for little
auk, agparak.
EXPEDITION TO FUNK ISLAND. 49D

less lingered long after it had become extirpated in other and more ac-
cessible Incalities. Lying 32 miles out in the Atlantic, environed by
rocks and shoals, where the sea breaks heavily during storms, the
vicinity of Funk Island is by no means attractive to the modern navi-
gator, and of late years has been seldom visited except by sealers, par-
ties of eggers, and occasional fishermen.

The sailors of old and the hardy colonists seem to have habitually
resorted to this spot for supplies, partly because there were no charts
to warn them of hidden perils, and partly for the reason that supplies
must be had at any risk.*

Therefore the work of slaying the Great Auks went steadily on until
the last of the species had disappeared from the face of the earth, and
the place to which it resorted for untold ages knew it no more.

With few exceptions naturalists seem not to have been aware of the
fact that the Great Auk wa3 being exterminated nntil the catastrophe
had actually taken place, and fewer still appear to have thought of the
calamity as occurring in America as well as in Europe.

Audubon, who, by the way, wrote of the bird at second hand, says in
his work (published between 1839 and 1844) that the Great Auk is rare
or accidental on the coast of Newfoundland, and is said by fishermen,
who kill the young for bait, to breed on a rock off the southeast coast of
that island.

This speaks of the bird as rare, giving no hint that it was then looked
upon as extinct, but in the “ Gloucester Telegraph” for August 7, 1839, is
an article from the ‘“‘ Salem Register” signed ‘ A Fisherman,” in which
the Great Auk is spoken of as being already exterminated. —

This paragraph which is interesting in that it adds one more cause
for the extermination of the bird to those already known, is as follows:

All the mackerel-men who arrive report the scarcity of this fish, and at the same
tine I notice an improvement in taking them with nets at Cape Cod and other places.

If this speculation is to go on without being checked or regulated by the Govern-
ment, will not these fish be as scarce on the coast as penguins are, which were so
pleuty before the Revolutionary War that our fishermen could take them with their
gaffs? But during the war some mercenary and cruel individuals used to visit the
islands on the eastern coast where were the haunts of these birds for breeding, and
take them for the sake of the fat, which they proctred and then let the birds go.t

This proceeding destroyed the whole race.

The Rev. William Wilson, who resided in Newfoundland as a mission-
ary from 1820 to 1834, and who once preached a sermon against the

“The writer has no intention of picturing the difficulty of landing on Funk Island
in too dark colors. It is simply a question of striking a favorable time, and while
the dweller on the coast can choose his time, the chance visitor must trust to luck,
and luck is ever an uncertain element. At the time of our visit landing on ‘The
Bench” was a simple matter, although at any other point a boat would have been
dashed to pieces in the surf; a little later another collector lost a fortnight in trying
to land, and then gave it up.

tOf late years the penguins of the Antarctic Seas have been killed by sealers and
tried out for oil.
496 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

wanton slaughter of the bird,* wrote of the Great Auk in 1864 that
‘‘ Half a century ago the penguin was very plenty. * * * The pen-
guinis now but seldom seen; such destruction of the bird was made for
the sake of its feathers that it is now all but extinet.t

The exact derivation of the word penguin and the date at which it
came into use is uncertain, although it occurs in the ‘* Voyage of M.
Hore and divers other gentlemen to Newfoundland and Cape Breton in
the yeere 1536.” Professor Newton (than whom there can be no better
authority) considers it probable that penguin is derived from pinwing,
a name still somewhat used in Newfoundland, and that this term was
bestowed on the Great Auk by the English fishermen from the fact
that the bird was as flightless as if pinwinged, in more modern parlance
pinioned. This operation consists in bending down the outer joint of
the wing, as in plucked chickens, or in locking the wings together
across the back.

Professor Steenstrup, on the other hand, believes the word to be of
Welch origin, from pen, white, and gwin, head; and although the head
of Great Auk is not white, yet there is a large white spot just in front
of the eye of sufficient size to warrant the appellation.

The French pingouin is of later date than penguin and was probably
derived from the English word, and though the supposition that both
came from the Spanish pingue, fat, meets with no favor from either
Professor Newton or Professor Steenstrup, it is after all not without
some slight show of reason.

The fishermen of Normandy, Brittany, and the Basque provinces
were the earliest to resort to Newfoundland, and these were on the
ground as early as 1504, only seven years after the discovery of the isl-
and by Cabot. In 1517 there were forty Portuguese, French, and Span-
ish vessels engaged in the cod fishery; and in 1578, according to Hak-
luyt, three hundred and fifty Spanish and French vessels and only fifty
English.

Thus it would appear that there was some chance of the Great Auk
having received its original name from the Spanish or French fishermen
although the English-speaking race has ever possessed the happy fac-
ulty of forcing its language upon all with whom it comes in contact.

That the Great Auk was well known at an early date is shown by
Anthonie Parkhurst’s statement, written in 1578, that “ the Frenchmen
who fish neere the grand baie,{ doe bring small store of flesh with them,
but victuall themselves with these birds” (penguins).

The extermination of the Great Auk took place so suddenly that a
comparatively small number of skins, skeletons, and eggs were pre-
served in museums, aud in America, where the garefowl had been most
abundant, scarce a specimen existed.

EXPEDITION TO FUNK ISLAND. A497

The U.S. National Museum possessed a stuffed specimen and an egg,
but in going over the osteological collection a single humerus of the
Great Auk was all that could be found, and even this was from a New
England shell heap. In the spring of 1885 the writer suggested the
ereat desirability of securing, if possible, other bones of this extinct
bird, which could doubtless be found on Funk Island, where Professor
Milne had secured a number during a brief visit in 1874. This sugges-
tion met with the approval of Professor Baird, but some correspond-
ence with the Rev. M. Harvey, of St. John’s, Newfoundland, made evi-
dent the fact that in order to insure the success of an expedition to Funk
{sland some naturalist should accompany the party, and that such a
trip would entail the expenditure of considerable time and money.

So the matter rested until the year of 1887, whe it became apparent
that the work of the U. S. Fish Commission would make it desirable for
the schooner Grampus to visit the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador,
and the question of visiting Funk Island was referred to Captain Col-
lins.

The undertaking met with the approval of Captain Collins, who by
indorsing the enterprise at. the outset, aud by cordial co-operation
throughout the resulting trip, ensured the complete success of the ex-
pedition.

It was my good fortune to be detailed to accompany the Grampus,
primarily to collect remains of the Great Auk, and also to secure as
much other anatomical material as might be obtainable.

As the proposed route would take the vessel to some localities where
little collecting had been done, Mr. William Palmer was also detailed
for the trip. He devoted himself especially to the birds and his inter-
esting observations appear elsewhere.

A more harmonious party probably never cruised together, and to
this, and to the fact that the rig and equipment of the Grampus fitted
her perfectly for the work in hand, may be attributed the success of
the voyage.

The middle of June was the date set for sailing, but owing to cireum-
stances the Grampus did not leave Gloucester until July 2, a delay,
however, that proved to be for the best, as the summer of 1887 was
unusually backward in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

The Bird Rocks of the Gulf of St. Lawrence was the first place set
down for a visit, but as wind and sea were then too high for janding
July 8 was passed at Grindstone Island, of the Magdalen group, where
a few birds were collected,

The only mammal seen was a young seal (Phoca vitulina), and it is
difficult to realize that the Magdalen Islands were once the seat of a
flourishing walrus fishery, and that thousands of these hage beasts were
annually slaughtered along their barren shores.

Molineux Shuldham, writing in 1775, speaks of the walrus as_ being
found on the Magdalens, St. John’s Island, and Anticosti, and the

animal was occasionally seen in the gulf during the first part of the
present century.

A little after noon on July 9 we came to anchor off the Bird Rocks, a
spot full of interest both to the naturalist and historian, for these little
islets were resorted to for supplies by the old navigators, and we find
them several times mentioned in Hakluyt’s Voyages, first, so far as I am
aware, by Jacques Cartier in June, 1534,

Cartier’s account runs thus:

The next day being the 25 of the moneth, the weather was also stormie, darke,
and windy, but yet we sailed a part of the day toward west-northwest, aud in the
evening wee put ourselves athwart untill thesecond quarter; when, as we departed,
then did we by our compasse know that we were northwest by west about seven
leagues and an halfe from the Cape of S. John, and as wee were about to hoise saile
the wind turned into the northwest, wherefore wee went southeast about 15 leagues,
aud came to three ilands, two of which are as steepe and upright as any wall, so
that it was not possible to climbe them, and betweene them there is a little rocke.

These ilands were as ful) of birds as any field or medow is of grasse, which there
do make their nestes, and in the greatest of them there was a great and infinite num-
ber of those that we call Margaulx, that are white and bigger than any geese, which
were severed in one part. In the other were onely Godetz, but toward the shoare
there were of those Godetz and great Apponatz like to those of that iland that we
above have mentioned. We went downe to the lowest part of the least iland where
we killed above a thousand of those Godetz and Apponatz. We put into our boates
so many of them as we pleased, for in lesse than one houre we might have filled thirtie
such boats of them.

We named them the Ilands of Margaulx.*

Charles Leigh’s account of his visit in 1597 is as follows:

The 14 (of June) we came to the two Islands of Birds, some 23 leagues from Mene-
go, where there were such abundance of birds asis almost incredible to report. And
upon the lesse of these Islands of Birds we saw great store of morsses or sea-oxen,
which were a sleepe upon the rocks, but when we approached nere unto them with
our boate they cast themselves into the sea and pursued us with such furie as that
we were glad to flee from them. ‘The 16 we arrived at Brian’s Island, which lyeth 5
leagues west from the Island of Birds.t

Aud a little further on we find him telling us that—

The greatest of these islands is about a mile incompasse. The second is little lesse.
The third is a very little one, like a smallrocke. At the second of these three lay on
the shore in the sunshine about thirty or forty sea-oxen or morses, which, when our
boat came nere them, presently made into the sea, and swam after the boat.

That Cartier’s “Isles des Margaulx” are the Bird Rocks of to-day
seeins unquestionable, although no locality at all can be found by fol-
lowing the courses and distances given as having been sailed on June
24 and 25, 1534. :

But by following Cartier northward from Buena Vista, through the
Strait of Belle Isle, and thence southward, we learn from the latitudes

EXPEDITION TO FUNK ISLAND. 499

now and then given that on June 25 he must have been somewhere in
the vicinity of the Bird Rocks.

It is also difficult to resist the temptation of suggesting that there
has been a mistake in translating Cartier’s log, and that “15 leagues
southeast” should be 15 leagues southwest. This is certainly a some-
what radical change, but the difference between sudest and sudouest is
not very great to the eye, and the translator might easily have gone
astray there.

Moreover why Cartier should have run dead before the wind to the
eastward when he seems to have been trying to work to the westward,
and could have held his ownsimply by keeping the wind abeam, is rather
strange.

Finally, if he was seven and a half leagues northwest by west from
some point on the west coast of Newfoundiand, a run of 15 leagues »
southeast would have carried him plump ashore, owing to the great
amount of westerly variation.

In this connection I desire to express my indebtedness to the courtesy
of Commander J. R. Bartlett, Chief of the Hydrographic Office, and to
Mr. G. W. Littlehales, of the Division of Chart Construction, for very
kindly supplying me with the necessary data for solving this problem.

Fortunately, too, there is a reference to the island of Brion, giving its
distance and direction from the Iles des Margaulx, and this is alone suf-
ficient to identify the spot, as they harmonize with existing facts.

Brion Island, like Blanc Sablon and Chateau Bay (the Bay of Castles
in Hakluyt), has luckily retained its name unchanged, while so many
other places have either been re-named or had their original appellations
anglicized out of existence.

Further confirmatinn is found in the Margaulx themselves,these birds,
‘‘ which bite even as dogs,” being gannets, whose descendants, in spite
of centuries of persecution, may still be found breeding where their
ancestors did before them. Ordinarily the presence or absence of any
given species of bird might seem of small value as a factor in the
identification of a locality, but the gannet is extremely critical in the
choice of a breeding place, and extremely pertinacious in clinging toit
when once selected.

Once established, nothing short of complete destruction appears to
drive them away, and unless carefully protected this curiously conserv-
ative spirit will eventually result in extermination.

Thus, while there are many points along the coast from Maine to Lab-
rador where the Gannets might breed, they are found, so far as I have
been able to ascertain, only at three places, an island in the Bay of
Fundy, the Bird Rocks and Bonaventure Island at Percé, Canada, the
colony at Mingan being too small and too nearly exterminated to be
taken into consideration. *

*Dr. Stejneger tells me that the same thing occurs in Europe, where the Gannets
cross the North Sea to breed on the Scottish coast, although there are numerous
favorabie localities on the coast of Norway.
500 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

That Cartier’s description of the islands does not quite accord with
their present appearance is not to be wondered at.

The material of which they are composed isa soft, decomposing red
sandstone that succumbs so easily to the incessant attacks of the sea
that Dr. Bryant’s description of them in 1860 does not hold good to-day.
If, then, the Bird Rocks have undergone visible changes in twenty-five
years, it is easy to imagine how great are the alterations they may have
undergone during three and a half centuries.

Dr. Bryant, in 1861, wrote as follows: *

These (the Bird Rocks) are two in number, called the Great Bird or Gannet Rock,
and the Little or North Bird; they are about three-quarters of a mile apart, the
water between them very shoal showing that, at no very distant epoch, they formed
a single island. * * * The North Bird is much the smallest and though the base
is more accessible, the suinmit can not, I believe, be reached; at least I was unable to
do so; it is the most irregular in its outline, presenting many enormous, detached
fragments, and is divided in one place into two separate islands at high water, the
northerly one several times higher than broad, so as to present the appearance of a
huge rocky pillar.

Gannet Rock is a quarter of a mile in its longest diameter from SW. to NE. The
highest point of the rock is at the northerly end, where, according to the chart, it is
140 feet high, and from which it gradually slopes to the southerly end, where it is
from 80 to 100.

The sides are nearly vertical, the summit in many places overhanging. There are
two beaches at its base on the southerly and westerly sides, the most westerly one
comparatively smooth and composed of rounded stones.

The easterly one, on the contrary, is very rough and covered by irregular blocks,
many of large size and still angular, showing that they have but recently fallen from
the cliffs above.

This beach is very difficult to land on, but the other presents no great difficulty in
ordinary weather; the top of the rock can not, however, be reached from either of
them. The only spot from which at present the ascent can be made is the rocky
point between the two beaches.

It was on this point, by the way, that Audubon’s son landed June
14, 1833.

The Great Rock has apparently altered but little during the past
twenty-five years, but such changes as have taken place have tended
to improve the character of the southerly beach, which has been selected
by the keeper of the light-house for the customary landing place.
Two long ladders, bolted to the rock and leading to the summit have
been erected.

The westerly beach is, however, the most accessible, and it is here
that the heavy light-house supplies are landed, a large hoisting appa-
ratus having been placed at the top of the overhanging cliff.

If the Great Rock is but little changed, its lesser relative has suffered
greatly, sea and frost, rain and ice having wrought sad havoe with it,
splitting great fragments from the sides so that a landing once effected
it is now an cas matter to reach the top.

Landing ean hardly be called easy in any but the finest of weather,
but on the afternoon of our visit we were favored with a calm, and suc-
ceeded in beaching our boat on the southerly side without difficulty,
possibly on the same spot where nearly three centuries before Charles
Leigh found a herd of huge walruses basking in the sun.

The Little Rock is about 75 yards long and perhaps 50 feet in height.
It is divided into two portions by a wide cleft, that seems from the con-
dition of the fallen rocks to be of comparatively recent origin, and it is
only a question of time when there shall be two islets instead of one.

Twenty-five yards from the eastern point lies the little rocky pillar
mentioned by Dr. Bryant, but this is now separated from the Little Rock
even at low tide, although if one does not mind cold water and slip-
pery rocks, it is then an easy matter to wade across the- connecting
ledge.

About midway between the Great and Little Rocks is a shoal which
may possibly mark the site of the little rock mentioned by Cartier,
although the islet, that for lack of a name may be called the Pillar,
agrees sufficiently well with the description.

It has been considered probable that the Great Auk once bred here,
and that this was the bird Cartier calls the Great Apponatz. True, a
few may have strayed here from the colony at Penguin Island, off Cape
la Hune,* but this, from the clannish habits of the bird, seems doubtful.
Besides the area available for breeding purposes is limited to a narrow
strip on the northeastern point, and a still more restricted portion on
the southern side, these being the only places accessible to a flightiess
bird lke the Garefowl. .

Mr. Grieve suggests in a recent letter that in former times the space
at the base of the Little Rock was much more extended than at present,
since Cartier’s crew “killed above a thousand of these Godetz and Ap-
ponatz” * on the lowest part of the least island.”

This supposition may well be correct, yet careful observation of the
rock and the depth of water immediately about it leads to the conclu-
sion that the changes it may have undergone have been the result of
the fall of fragments from the overhanging sides rather than the wearing
away of the base.

Jharles Leigh makes no mention of Penguins at the time of his visit
jn 1597, although it seems probable that he would have done so had
they been there.

On the other hand, the Bird Rocks agree in location with the “Island
of Penguin,” mentioned by Silvestre Wyet, shipmaster of Bristol, in
1594, ‘which lyeth south from the easternmost part of Natiscotec
(Anticosti) some twelve leagues. From the island of Penguin wee
Shaped our course for Cape de Rey and had sight of the Island of Cape
Briton.”

*The presence of the Great Auk at the Cape la Hune, Penguin Islands, is very
largely presumptive, positive evidence to that effect being lacking.
They may be the islands mentioned by M. Hore, or they may not.
502 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

If the Godetz and Apponatz were Murres and Razor-bills it would
have required but a comparatively small extent of cliff for their accom-
modation, for at this early date every available inch of room must have
been occupied.

The top of the Little Rock was covered with a thin deposit of guano,
marked with many shallow, saucer-like depressions where the Gannets
had made their nests, but not a single egg of this species was to be
seen, and the few eggs of the Murre and Razor-bill that were subse-
quently found had evidently been overlooked by the fishermen who
resort to this rock for supplies, and who had made a clean sweep of
everything within reach.

A few Kittywakes had literally reared their young on the southern
side, and under the overhanging cliff on the northwest a small number
of Murres, Razor-bills, and Puffins were breeding.

Careful search brought to light a few eggs and nestlings, some of
these latter so carefully concealed among the bowlders that but for
their incessant peeping they would have been passed by.

The top of the pillar was closely packed with breeding Gannets, while
a few were sprinkled along the sides. As this rock is somewhat diffi-
cult of access these birds, together with a small colony of Murres and
Razor-bills, probably succeeded in raising their young. From this spot
three young Gannets were obtained, these being the first of the season,
according to Mr. Turbid, the light-keeper, who most kindly gave us all
the aid and information in his power.

The Great Rock is the real breeding place of the birds, Gannets,
Murres, Paffins, and Razor-bills being both abundant and tame, in spite
of the fact that they are subjected to continual persecution. The birds
do not seem to be divided into colonies according to species, Gan-
nets and Murres being found in juxtaposition, and although the
Gannets prefer the upper ledges, yet their distribution is to a great ex-
tent regulated by the width of the rocky shelves, the Murres taking
possession where there is not sufficient room to accommodate their
larger companions. There is, however, a tendency of birds of afeather
to flock together in little groups of a dozen or two, and at a distance the
cliffs appear seamed with white, owing to the long lines of perching
Gannets.

The top of the Great Rock is now entirely deserted by all birds ex-
cept the little Leach’s Petrels, who burrow in security among the frag-
ments of stone that everywhere show through the shallow soil.

It is evident from the accounts of previous visitors that the interest-
ing colony at the Bird Rocks has become sadly diminished in numbers.
At the time of Cartier’s visit, every inch of available space seems to
have been occupied by breeding birds, and in 1597 Charles Leigh said
“the three islands of birds are sandy red, but with the multitude of
birds upon them they looke white. The birds sit there as thicke as stones ©
lie in a paved street.”

EXPEDITION TO FUNK ISLAND. HO3

At the time of Audubon’s visit in 1833 he compared the effect of the
birds, seen from a distance hovering over the summit, toa heavy fall
of snow.

The Gannets were then largely used for bait by the fishermen of
Bryon Island, no less than forty boats being supplied from the Bird
Rocks, and Audubon relates how a party of six killed with clubs five
hundred and forty birds in less than an hour.

In 1860 Dr. Bryant estimated the number of Gannets breeding on the
summit of the Great Rock alone at 50,000 pairs, the total number at
75,000 pairs, although these figares are very likely too high.

In 1872, owing to the erection of the light-house, the colony on top
of the rock had become reduced to 5,000, and in 1881 Mr. Wm. Brew-
ster found that the Gannets had been entirely driven from the summit,
although the Little Rock was still densely populated. He places the
total Gannet population of the rocks at 50,000, which is still an ex-
traordinary andimpressive number, although much less than the figures
of previous observers.

In 1887, only six years later, not a single Gannet bred on the Little
Rock, although perhaps a hundred and fifty may have found nesting
places on the Pillar, while according to M. Turbid not more than ten
thousand dwelt on the ledges of the Great Rock.

Besides the Bird Rocks the only large colony of Gannets in the Gulf
of St. Lawrence is at Bonaventure Island, on the Canadian coast, where,
on the lofty and vertical cliffs of the eastern side (250 feet high), these
birds breed in a state of semi-security. Dr. Bryant inadvertently locates
this colony at Pereé, or Arch Rock, but although this curious and
inaccessible islet is only a mile or so distant, and the birds breeding on
its summit are perfectly safe, not a single Gannet is to be found among
them.

Here, too, the number of Gannets has greatly diminished, and when
later on we visited Bonaventure Captain Collins expressed surprise at
the marked decrease in their numbers. That this colony ever compared
in extent with that at the Bird Rock is very doubtful, although Dr.
Bryant states that it is “ perhaps even more remarkable.”

A few Gannets were found at Perroquet Island of the Mingan group,
in spite of the incessant persecution of the Indians who regularly make
a clean sweep there. In 1860 Dr. Bryant predicted that the locality
would soon be deserted, but in 1881 Mr. Brewster found several hun-
dred birds still there, although shortly after his visit the Indians took
every egg.

No Gannets were seen east of Mingan, and none on the eastern coast
of Newfoundland, although in the time of Cartier there seems to have
been a colony of these birds on Funk island, where, if one may credit
the testimony of fishermen, they were still breeding thirty years ago.

The same decrease of Gannets seems to be taking place elsewhere,
and Professor Newton tells me thatat Lundy Island in the Bristol Chan-
504 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

nel, the only British locality where this bird is found, there were in 1887
but a dozen pairs left.

The decrease of Gannets at the Bird Rocks is the most perceptible
owing to their size, but the smaller birds have doubtless suffered in the
same proportion. Scarce a day passes during fine weather without a
visit from fishermen * in search of eggs or Murres, these latter being
used for food and making anot unpalatable stew.

Many barrels of eggs are gathered during the season, and altogether
the birds lead rather a precarious existence. Still a large portion of
the Great Rock is practically inaccessible, and unless the feather hunt-
ers afflict this interesting spot with their presence the birds may con-
tinue to breed here in diminished numbers for long years to come.

The extermination of birds is largely a question of sentiment, but
these sea-fowl exist in such numbers that they play a not unimportant
part in supplying food to the residents of the gulf and coast of Labrador,
and hence their extirpation is to be doubly deplored.

There is a law regulating t he taking of eggs, and if this were observed,
or could be strictly enforced, a large number of eggs could be gathered
annually while at the same time the number of birds would steadily in-
crease. Butin a region so thinly peopled as the coasts of Labrador
and the gulf, game laws are difficult to enforce and each party of fisher-
men acts on the principle that it is useless to leave what the next visitor
will be sure to take.

Mr. Turbid, however, who has resided on the Great Rock as light-
keeper since 1880, states that latterly the birds are on the increase and
that in the last eight years the Murres have doubled in numbers, the
Gannets increased one-third, and the other birds from one quarter to
one-third. Mr. Turbid also told us that the Murres were becoming used
to the fog-gun, which at the time of Mr. Brewster’s visit was, indirectly,
a source of great destruction.

At each discharge the frightened Murres fly from the rock in clouds, nearly every
setting bird taking its egg into the air between its thighs and dropping it after fly-
ing a few yards. This was repeatedly observed during our visit, and more than once
a perfect shower of eggs fell into the water around our boat. Sv seriously had the
Murres suffered from this cause that many of the ledges on the side of the rock where
the gun was fired had been swept alm ost clear of eggs.t

It was the intention to have visited the Cape la Hune Penguin Islands,
but rough weather made this impracticable, and from the Bird Rocks
the Grampus went direct to St. John’s, Newfoundland. Here we had
the pleasure of meeting the Rev. M. Harvey, who most kindly gave us
all the aid in his power, and here Capt. Duncan Baxter joined the ves-
sel as Newfoundland pilot, although he also rendered most efficient aid
as a collector.

* We found a party on the Little Rock at the time of our visit, and later in the day
another boat’s crew landed on the westerly beach of the Great Rock.

EXPEDITION TO FUNK ISLAND. 505 ©

During our stay at St. John’s we met several fishermen who had vis-
ited Funk Island on egging expeditions, but beyond ascertaining the
position of the best landing little knowledge was gained, nothing con-
cerning the character of the soil, or the chances for and against securing
remains of the Great Auk.

Leaving St. John’s on the morning of July 21, we sailed northward
toward Cape Bonavista, a headland that still bears its original appel-
lation, following almost exactly the track pursued by Cartier’s vessels
more than three centuries ago.

Daybreak on the morning of the 22d found usin sight of Funk Island,
but the wind was so light that not until noon were we near enough for
a boat tobe lowered and a start made for the shore.

But two collectors had visited Funk Island before us, Peter Stuvitz
in 1841 and Prof. J. W. Milne in 1874, both of whom had been compelled
to cut short their stay and hasten back to their vessels on account of
threatening weather. Warned by their experience, it had been decided
to take ashore in the first boat a camping outfit and provisions for sev-
eral days, so that in the not impossible event of a fog or fresh breeze
springing up we could remain on the island and proceed with work while
the Grampus sought safer quarters.

Accordingly the dory set out with a load large enough and varied
enough to have started a small country store. Besides tent and tent
poles, a huge firkin of provisions, and three breakers of water there
-were digging utensils of various descriptions, a gun and plenty of
ammunition, buckets, baskets, rope, anchor, and a general wilderness
of rubber boots, coats, and southwesters. -

We were not, however, compelled to avail ourselves of these elabo-
rate preparations, for the weather continued so fair that at night we
returned to the Grampus, and although after sunset the wind freshened
and next morning the weather looked decidedly threatening, the squalls
passed over and gave place to light southerly breezes.

Viewing the island from a distance it had seemed possible with the
faint air then stirring to beach a boat on the southerly slope; but
closer approach transformed the narrow line of foam and gently shelving
rock into the wash of a heavy swell on a steep and slippery slope of
granite, whereon landing was quite out of the question.

The best landing is at a spot termed “The Bench,” lying a hundred
_yards or so to the west of the northeastern or Escape Point, and
toward this portion of the island, where from time immemorial man
had landed to despoil the feathered inhabitants, we directed our course.

The Bench is a narrow path, hewn by nature in the side of alow,
almost vertical cliff, leading at high tide from the water’s edge to per-
haps 20 feet above it.

At the widest this path is 4 feet across, but from that it tapers
either way to nothing, terminating at the upper end ina fissure just
wide enough to accommodate one’s foot, the rough granite furnishing a
very good substitute for a hand-rail.
506 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Below “the bench” the rock descends almost vertically to a depth of
120 feet beneath the sea, this combination of deep water and smooth,
perpendicular rock offering no obstacle to chafe the sea into breaking,
so that with southerly winds, as at the time of our visit, the swell merely
rises and falls along the wall of rock.

With northerly winds this landing of course is impracticable, and
boats then seek a more precarious spot near Gannet Head, on the south-
west, where Stuvitz seems to have landed in 1841.

Once on “ the bench ” it is an easy matter to reach the summit of the
island, either by scrambling directly up the face of the rock or by an
easier but more circuitous path, if path it can be called, leading from
the fissure in which “ the bench” ends.

While the height of Funk Island is put down on the chart at 46 feet,
it certainly looks to be much higher, whether seen from the deck of a
vessel or viewed from the eastern blufts.

The entire eastern end of the island is very precipitous, as is also the
southwestern extremity, but on the northwest and along a lesser
portion of the southern side the rock slopes gradually into the sea, and
it was here that the Great Auk scrambled through the breakers to
meet its fate.

The greatest length of the island from east-northeast to west-south-
west is about half a mile, its breadth a quarter, these distances being
set down in the sailing directions as 800 and 400 yards.

Lying respectively 600 and 1,200 yards off the western point are two
small, rounded islets, so low that they must be completely washed over
in rough weather, and consequently untenable as breeding places.

Two faults, deepened by time into shallow valleys, divide the island
into three ridges running nearly east and west. The northern and
central of these are bare rock, for the most part smoothed and rounded
by rain and ice, although here and there the decomposition of the feld-
spar has tormed curious, overhanging ledges, especially toward the
eastern end.

Tn these depressions are numerous pools of brackish water, the more
extensive—interspersed with patches that may be dignified by the
name of marsh—lying along the line of the southernmost fault, which
terminates in a small, natural amphitheater, floored with pebbles.

Growing amidst these pebbles were patches of a blue-flowering weed,
around which white butterflies (Pieris) were sufficiently numerous to .
indicate that they were regular inhabitants of the island.

Indian Gulch, the eastern termination of the northern fault, opens
into this amphitheater from the sea by a narrow cleft, into which the
swell rushes in a seething torrent of foam, emphasizing the remark of
the sailing directions that “at all times the scend of the sea would
make it unsafe for a boat in such narrow waters.”

A large portion of the southern and most extensive swell of rock is
EXPEDITION TO FUNK ISLAND. 5O7

thickly covered with vegetation*, this, the former breeding ground of
the Great Auk, being mapped out in vivid green by the plants nour-
ished by the decomposed bodies and slowly decomposing bones of the
long extinet bird.

It would seem that the Auk inhabited every accessible foot of ground,
the inability of the bird to fly restricting it of necessity to such portions
of the island as could be reached after a landing had been effected on
the northerly or southerly slope.

Any abrupt rise of smooth rock, although comparatively low, would
interpose an insurmountable barrier to further progress, and from the
character of the rock and total absence of bones, it does not seem that
the Auk ever passed beyond the southernmost line of fault, or even
reached the eastern part of the island.

Here the Auk bred in peace for ages, undisturbed by man} until
that fateful day in June, 1534, when Cartier’s crews inaugurated the
slaughter that terminated only with the existence of the Great Auk.

Here to day the bones of myriads of Garefowl! lie buried in the shallow
soil formed above their moldered bodies, and here, in this vast Aleine
cemetery, are thickly scattered slabs of weathered granite, like so many
crumbling tombstones marking the resting places of the departed Auks.

It is rather curious that these blocks of stone should be found on this
part of the island, just where they would be most needed by man, but
for some reason the rock seems to weather into slabs more on the
southern rise than elsewhere. It is also an interesting coincidence, to
say the least, that Robert Hore and another of the old navigators
speak of Penguin Island as “‘ very full of rocks and stones,” although
their accounts seem to refer to Cape la Hune, Penguin Islands, rather
than to Funk Island.

Those preceded by an asterisk (*) were collected by Mr. William Palmer, and those
preceded by the dagger (+) were noted by Professor Milne.

It is a little curious that but a single species was observed by both naturalists, the
more that Professor Milne was on the island but half an hour and Mr. Palmer parts
of two days.

tA paddle and remains of canoes are said to have been found here, as well as stone
arrow heads, and this would indicate visits from the Indians. Professor Milne con-
siders this doubtful, owing to the indifferent seagoing qualities of the Beothue canoes.
There seems, too, no reason why they should incur the risk of visiting this island so
far at sea when plenty of sea fowl could be obtained nearer home. Still, if the remains
actually were found, they could scarcely have come here by accident.
508 ' REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

On the summit of the island, and not far from the center, are the
ruins of a stone hut, built of the abundant slabs, and visible for a con-
siderable distance. This hut is said by Professor Milne to have been
the residence of the party who resided on the island for a short time in
1863 for the purpose of procuring guano. But according to another ac-
count it was built for the accommodation of a sealing crew who, some
years ago, was placed on theisland to pass the winter and obtain the
first chance at the seals who come down on the floe-ice in the spring.
The entire crew, with the exception of the cook, were lost while out
sealing, and the sole survivor rescued in an almost insane condition.

The strongest point in favor of the more poetic version is found in
the fact that the guano party were on the island but a few days in sum-
mer, and they would scarcely have taken the trouble to build so sub-
stantial a dwelling.

In 1863 * Mr. Thomas N. Molloy, now United States consul at St.
John’s, fitted out the expedition to seek for guano at Funk Island, Cap-
tains Burke and Glyndon being at the head of the enterprise. They
landed on the island, taking with them a large skiff, while their schooner
returned to the harbor of Seldom Come By, Fogo Island.

In all 35 tons of guano were secured, four laborers obtaining 20 tons
in ten days. Five tons were sold at auction in St. John’s for $19 per
ton and the remainder consigned to a Boston house, by whom it was in
turn sent to Baltimore and Washington.

Just where the guano came fromitis difficult to say, for there is now no
trace of it on Funk Island, except in the shape of a strong smell on the
oare rocks of the eastern part, resorted to by Murres and Razor-bills.

The climate is not favorable to the formation of guano deposits, such
as are found in dry tropical regions, and on Funk Island the rain must
long ago have washed out the soluble constituents of the old “ soil” of
that part of the island formerly inhabited by the Great Auk.

The soil consists of two distinct layers, the lower portion, formed
during the occupancy of the Auk, being from 3 inches to 1 foot in thick-
ness and consisting largely of fragments of egg shells, although next to
bed rock are numerous angular pebbles of various sizes.

The black dust from the decayed, overlying vegetation and abundant
patches of charcoal has filtered into the lower stratum, but so numerous
are the fragments of egg-shells that the deposit has a yellowish gray
color.

The upper layer of soil, also from 3 inches to 1 foot thick, has formed
since the extermination of the Auk, principally by the growth and
decay of vegetation nourished by their bodies.

In fact it is possible, from the character of the plant growth above,

_to tell something of the probable abundance of Auk remains below;
thickness of the one indicating corresponding plenty of the other.

*Mr. Molloy gave the date as 1866, butas the ‘‘ mummies ” were certainly obtained
in 1863, this may have been a slip of the pen.
EXPEDITION TO FUNK ISLAND. 509

So little could be ascertained regarding the soil of Funk Island, that
we came provided even with a pickaxe, while we were told that we
might be compelled to dig through several feet of turfin order to reach
the bones of the Garefowl. ‘The most thoroughly useful tools proved
to be two clam hoes, with which rapid progress could be made through
the matted roots and scanty soil.

Peter Stuvitz, who visited Funk Island in 1844, wrote that—

On the southwestern side a little vegetation is found and sufficient soil to support
an extremely scanty flora; but it is there that I discovered remains of bones in great
number, and itjis probable that the thin layer of vegetable mould which is met with-
in that locality is due to the destruction of the animals to which they belonged.

The skeletons lie in a compact mass in the earth, and according to the depth at
which they are found one can estimate the time necessary for the formation of the
layer of mold above them. Moreover, this layer of earth was usually very thin,
and in places the bones were not covered at all.

During the last forty or fifty years the thickness of the layer of earth formed is
consequently not appreciable, for a slaughter of these birds sufficiently extensive for
the accumulation of such heaps of bones must antedate that epoch.

On this side are found the stone inclosures called pounds, in which the hunters con
cealed themselves to slay the birds.*

This description is very accurate and is as true to-day as when it was
written, except that the layer of soil is thicker, and vegetation more
abundant. Two of the pounds near the western landing place, whose
position is indicated on the accompanying map, still remain untouched.
and although the stones lie prostrate, not one is wanting. Remains o|
other pounds, more or less overgrown by weeds, are to be seen here and
there along the central ridge of the island, and hard by the ruins of the
hut recently mentioned are the traces of two other small structures partly
hidden by the vegetation.

Concerning these there seems to be no tradition, but it is not at al
improbable that they were the dwellings of the old-time destroyers oj
the Auk, for there is no reason why parties should not have passed the
entire breeding season on the island in order to prosecute their work
without interruption, and Cartwright says that this was done.

By placing the huts along the crest of the island they would be free
from surface drainage during rains, while the “ compounds” would nat
urally be located near the huts for convenience, and away from the
water to avoid unnecessary fright to the landing birds.

The most abundant deposits of bones are found in the vicinity of the
ruined hut, partially in the upper stratum of soil, where the bones of
thousands of birds are mixed together in inextricable confusion.

In the upper layer of soil, too, lie the patches of charcoal and charred
fragments of bones, showing where the kettles once swung in which
the birds were parboiled to render plucking them an easy operation.

Tradition says that the bodies of the Great noes were so fat that

* This i is Rioemicdin an error, Yin all anor pice agree in - uieutone that the
pounds were used for confining the birds until they should be needed.
510 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

they could be used for fuel, and while this seems a little doubtful it
may yet be true, or partially so.

It certainly would have been a great convenience to the Auk exter-
minators to be thus relieved of the difficulty of bringing fire-wood from
the mainland, more than 30 miles distant.

Close by the two best preserved pounds we upturned the sod over a
circle 10 or 12 feet in diameter, beneath which was a compact layer of
charcoal and bones, while not far away another excavation told as
plainly as words that here was one of the last abiding places of the
Auk.

Barely 2 inches of turf covered the shallow soil in which lay embedded
a few fresh-looking bones of the Great Auk, mixed with others of its
lesser relative, the Murre. Evidently at the time of this deposit the
Great Auk was on the wane and its numbers were no longer sufficient
to meet the demands of the feather hunters, who promptly supplied
the deficiency with those of the bird most easily secured.

The Great Auk, by the way, is not the only bird which has been ex-
tirpated on Funk Island, for the Gannet lives in name alone, although
Cartier found it abundant, and men still living remember to have seen
the bird. Thanks to the efforts of the eggers, the numbers of birds of
all species, with the possible exception of the Puffins, have been greatly
lessened during the past twenty-five years.

Stuvitz in 1844 called Funk Island ‘¢a mountain of birds and was
above all surprised at the abundance of the Arctic and Common Tern,
while in 1874 Professor Milne wrote that “ although it was the 20th of
July, we were almost everywhere in danger of placing our feet upon
eggs.”

We found the Arctic Terns still very numerous, and the shrill cries
of the large flock that circled round our heads were so loud and in-
cessant as to be positively annoying.

Their young, and eggs in an advanced stage of incubation were scat-
tered here and there from one end of the island to the other, but not a
single specimen of the Common Tern was noticed.

The number of Murresand Razor-bills was comparatively insignificant,
and the few eggs of these species that were seen were placed in the most
secluded spots attainable.

The Kazor-bill in particular seems to be learning wisdom by bitter ex-
perience, and, as we first noticed at the Bird Rocks, hides its egg when-
ever practicable in some nook or cranny, or under an overhanging ledge
where it will be safe from all intruders.

The Paffins, however, who find security in their burrows, exist in
great numbers, and to them, at least, the extermination of the Great
Auk has proved a decided advantage by providing soil in which to dig
their habitations.

The entrance to each burrow is surrounded by small collections of
Great Auk bones which these little resurrectionists have brought to
EXPEDITION TO FUNK ISLAND. ~ 511

light, and the intermingled condition of the buried remains is in no
small degree due to the labors of the busy Puffins.

During the day, perching upon the ruins of the hut, or standing on
the blocks of granite, they watched our labors with mingled interest
and suspicion, while towards sunset, returning from distanf fishing ex-
peditions they gathered along the bluffs in battalions, flanked by com-
panies of Murres and Razor-bills.

The Puffius were the first to assure us of the success of the expedition,
for the many specimens of the unmistakable humerus of the Great Auk
contained in their little osteological collections were certain evidence
of the quantities of bones that lay beneath the soil. The modus oper-
andi in digging was to skim off the superficial layer of turf and witha
few strokes of the hoe bring up some samples of bones. If, on inspec-
tion, the quality of the bones was found to be good, careful excavation
with hoe and fingers followed, but if, as often happened, the exhumed
bones were brown and weatherworn, another spot was tried at once.

Quantity was a secondary consideration, for where the remains were
most abundant they were usually in a poor state of preservation, the
more scattered specimens being the best.

On the northerly slope a stroke of the hoe made anywhere would
bring to light at least a score of bones, but on the west, and more espe-
cially on the south, the deposits rapidly thinned out, although no spot
was tried where Auk bones were not found, and it is no exaggeration
to say that millions of Garefowl gave up their lives on these few acres
of barren rock.

Professor Milne seems to have had some doubt of all the bones he
discovered being those of the Great Auk, for he remarks: ‘at nearly
every trial bones were found, but there was nothing that could be
identified as ever having belonged to the bird for which I searched.”

For the benefit of future visitors to Funk island it may be said that
bones, other than those of the Great Auk, are of very rare occurrence,
so much so that two barrels of earth and bones, gathered haphazard, con-
tained less than a handful belonging to any other bird.

Contrary to what might be supposed the more recent bones are in the
worst state of preservation, for owing to their protection from the sun
and the fact that they are kept damp for the greater part of the time,
those found in the lower stratum of soil are in ane better condition
than those nearer the surface.

The majority of the bones are weather-worn, others are stained but
perfect, while now and then a bone may be tound looking as fresh and
white as if the bird to which it belonged had been killed but a year or
SO ago.

Some of the best preserved bones lay at the entrance of Puffin bur-
_ rows and had evidently been brought to light in the course of their
spring house-cleaning, but it proved a futile task to follow the course
of the hole in the hope of finding others equally good.
512 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The skull usually breaks across at the articulation of the nasals with
the frontals and many a time did we work carefully around the point
of some projecting beak only to find that the back of the skull was en-
* tirely lacking. The sternum and pelvis are very rarely found in good
condition, the thinness of these bones, and their immediate contact.
with the viscera having caused their rapid decay so that although we
disinterred hundreds we suceeded in obtaining but a single perfect
specimen of each.

It would seem that these alcine remains are rapidly deteriorating,
although so few visits have been made to Funk Island with the view
of procuring bones that it is difficult to make comparisons, while at the
same time the element of luck must, to a large extent, enter into the
finding of buried bones.

In 1863 three ‘‘ mummies,” or dried bodies of Great Auks, were se-
cured by the party in search of guano, and in 1874 Professor Milne ob-
tained in half an hour bones representing fifty individuals, from which
four more or less complete skeletons were constructed.

In 1887 our party passed portions of two busy days in exhuming
thousands of bones, and yet this great number will ‘‘make up” not
more than a dozen skeletons, and these not absolutely perfect, while
no entire specimen was found, although in the hope of coming upon
a ‘‘mummy ”, holes were dug in many places quite to the bed rock.
Neither did we secure more than a single membranous lining of the
egg of the Great Auk, although Professor Milne in less than half an
hour found “ the inner iain of a few eggs.”

The mixed condition of the remains has already been alluded . and
so completely are the bones intermingled, that after many endeavors to
obtain those of a single individual, the attempt was abandoned in
despair, heads and feet, sterna and pelves being intimately associated
with one another, and not more than six, or at the most eight, consecu-
tive vertebrie being found together.

An idea of the great abundance of bones may be gathered from the
fact that while many humeri were thrown aside while digging the col-
lection was found to contain over fourteen hundred specimens of this
bone.

Every part of the skeleton was secured, including even the small
ethmo turbinals, although in spite of careful search but one or two of
the first rib and third phalanx of the wing were found.

The number of bones from young birds is extremely small, bee this
all but total lack of them is readily accounted for by the fact that after
the merciless slaughter of the Auks had fairly commenced, few, if any,
eggs were allowed to hatch.

There was a small number of diseased bones present, the result of in-
juries, and one of these, a broken and re-united ulna, had apparently
been shattered by a shot. Comparatively few of the crania show any
evidence of their original owner having met with a violent death, but
EXPEDITION TO FUNK ISLAND. 513

this is largely due to the selection of the best specimens that offered ;
any that were obviously poor being passed by.

Professor Milne remarks that ‘the fact that there remains no evi-
dence of cuts or blows leads to the supposition that these birds may
have died peacefully ” but some of the crania do show the marks of cuts
and blows, and, moreover, there is plenty of local history or tradition
to show exactly how these birds were done to the death.

It should also be vorne in mind that birds seldom die peacefully, for
nature rarely accords this boon to her subjects, and when they do meet
their end, they seem to have a habit of making away with their skele
tons: it would be more accurate to say have their skeletons made
away with, for dead birds do not often go to waste, but usually find
their way into the stomach of some hungry animal, possibly of the
same race.

Dr. Stejneger tells me that during his stay at the Commander Isiands
many sea birds were washed ashore during or after gales, but unless
one was on the beach before daylight the bodies were destroyed by foxes.
Even in the immense guano deposits of the Chincha Islands, where
every circumstance is favorable to the preservation of inhumed speci-
mens, bird remains are of comparatively rare occurrence, while in lo-
calities where the climate is subject to extremes of heat and coid, rain
and sunshine, they go to pieces rapidly.

It was not without regret that we prepared to leave so interesting a
spot as Funk Island, but having successfully accomplished our mission
of collecting bones of the Great Auk, no good reason remained for a
longer stay when many miles of our proposed route yet remained to be
traversed., Accordingly we gathered up our various impedimenta, the
_ boat was brought alongside “the bench” for the last time, and laden
with the spoils of our two days’ labor we returned to the Grampus, which
lay at anchor a mile to the eastward of Escape Point.

Fortune continued to smiie on us, and as the threatening weather of
the morning had given way to calm, so now that we were ready to leave
a fair breeze sprang up that carried us rapidly toward the mainland.

Funk Island grew lower and lower in the distance, and as the sun was
nearing the western horizon we bade the home of the Great Auk a long
farewell.

It was the intention to visit, if possible, any localities whose names
indicated that the Great Auk might once have been found there, espe-
cially Penguin Islands on the south coast, and Penguin Islands near
Cape Freels. A brisk southwester drove us by the former place at a
very lively pace, while with the visit to Funk Island still in prospect, it
was not deemed advisable to lose any time in waiting for the wind and
sea to go down, so this portion of the trip was abandoned.

On the eastern coast, however, the weather was more favorable; so
after leaving Funk Island, the Grampus ran over to the well-named
harbor of Seldom Come By, and the next morning started for Penguin

H. Mis. 142, pt. 2——33 : f
514 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Islands, which lie about 3 miles from shore and 10 miles northwest of

Cape Freels.

' Passing Peckford Reef, the Schoolmarm, and Scrub Rocks (nature is
very liberal with rocks and reefs in this part of the world), the Grampus
anchored at noon off two low, grassy islets, whose appearance was not
at all suggestive of an Alcine breeding place. Nor did careful exami-
nation reveal any traces of former habitation by the Great Auk, and
if the bird once dwelt here, he left nothing behind to indicate the fact,
for not a bone, nor even a speck of eggshell could be found.

This is in marked contrast with the condition of affairs at Funk Is-
land, where, aside from the bones that the upturned sod shows every-
where present, the soil itself, thickly sprinkled with crumbled egg
shells, bears mute testimony to long years of occupancy by the Great
Auk.

Still one of these islets may be that certain flat island where Captain
Richard Whitbourne tells us men ‘*‘ drave the Penguins on a board into
their boats by hundreds at a time,” although it must be said that this
and similar stories have rather an apochryphalring tothem. Certainly
so easy a method of loading a boat with Garefowl, as that of putting out
a gang plank and driving them aboard like sheep, was not of common
occurrence at Funk Island, where the slope of the rock and wash of the
sea would render such a thing impossible.

Although at the time of our visit it was remarkably calm, yet the boat
rose and fell along the cliff4 or 5 feet at every heave of the swell, while
on the sloping rock, even to leeward, the sea came rolling in in a man-
ner fit to test the seaworthiness of a Great Auk, to say nothing of a
small boat.

Whoever may have been the former residents of Penguin Islands, to-
day their most numerous inhabitants are field mice (Arvicola riparia),
which, if one may judge by the abundance of their burrows, exist in
almost incredible numbers, while well worn connecting paths cover the
ground in places with a veritable network.

A little investigation showed that many of the deserted burrows,
possibly some recent ones also, had been taken possession of by breed-
ing petrels (Oceanodroma leucorrhoa) which were thus saved the trouble
of digging their own nesting places.

A few Puffins (Fratercula aretica) are also found on the island, but
they seemed to have been no more successful than ourselves in finding
bones, for none lay scattered about the entrance to their holes.

Taking into consideration the general character of the islets, the
thickness of the turf that covers them, their nearness to shore aud the
absence of remains of the Great Auk, it seems at least doubtful if the
bird ever dwelt here, although the absence of remains is, it must be
said, negative evidence of but small value.

If the Great Auk once bred in this vicinity, Offer Wadham, 9 miles
farther seaward, is much more likely to have been its habitat, but it
may be questioned if the bird was found there in historic times.
EXPEDITION TO FUNK ISLAND. 515

There can be little doubt that the extent of the breeding range of the
Great Auk has been as a rule much overestimated, and the writer’s
own belief is that, like the Gannet, the Garefow] was confined to a very
few localities. This is known to have been the case in Kurope, and,
while the fact is more difficult to prove in regard to America, it must
be borne in mind that all definite accounts of the Great Auk in the
New World point to, at the most, three or four localities, although dur-
ing its migrations the bird occurred along the Atlantic coast from New-
foundland to Virginia.

Had it been otherwise, and had the Great Auk, as is so often stated,
bred at numerous localities along the coasts of Newfoundland and Lab-
rador, the bird in limited numbers would probably be alive to-day.

The circumstance that the bird, with suicidal persistence, resorted to
a few chosen breeding places, and that it was there found in great num-
bers, rendered its destruction not only possible but probable, and when
the white man first set foot in America, the extinction of the Great Auk
became merely a question of time.

The only thing that has kept the Gannet from sharing the fate of the
Garefowl is the inaccessible nature of its nesting places, and even this
may not save him much longer, while the Razor-bill and Murre, in spite
of their wide range and similar choice of steep cliffs whereon to raise
their young, have sadly fallen off in numbers.

This decrease is due to the fact that the eggs of these birds are taken
at all seasons when they are to be had, and although the law may check
the practice it can not puta stop to it, so that the sea-fowl are gradu-
ally lessening in number. Still it is scarcely probable that any of the
smaller Auks will suffer the fate of their great relative whose flightless-
ness foreordained its extermination, and whose sole chance for safety
lay in the choice of uuknown or inaccessible breeding grounds.

B.—SKELETAL VARIATION OF THE GREAT AUK.

The material collected by the Grampus comprised 2 cubic feet of earth
brought away as nearly as possible undisturbed, in order to show the
bones im situ, a barrel of Auk remains gathered along the crest of the
island, and nearly another barrel of select material, containing the best
preserved bones that could be found.

The disposition so far made of this material is as follows: a perfect
Skeleton has been placed in the exhibition series of the U. S. National
Museum, one has been presented to the Museum of Comparative Zéology,
Cambridge, Massachusetts, and another to the American Museum of
Natural History, New York.*

One specimen, sent in exchange to a well-known London dealer in
natural history material, has found its way to the Museum of Science

*It is of course understood that these skeletons are “made up” from bones of yva-
rious individuals.
516 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 18838.

and Art, Edinburgh, and another has been sent in exchange to the
Australian Museum, Sydney, New South Wales. Two skeletons are
retained for the reserve series, U. S. National Museum, and three or
four less complete can still be made up from the bones remaining, while
there is besides a large number of individual bones, good, bad, and
indifferent, left for study.

This wealth of material has offered an unusual opportunity for the
study of individual variation, and it is hoped that the following notes
may be of some interest in connection with that most interesting prob-
len.

Unfortunately the conditions under which the remains were found
limited all comparisons to individual bones, the inextricably mixed
state of the skeletons precluding all possibility of comparing them with
one another in their entirety.

Variations are of degree or of kind, due to modifications of develop-
ment or of structure, and the importance of any departure from a given
type depends very largely on the answer to the question to which of
these two categories does the variation belong. Moreover, in consider-
ing the variations of any one species the variations of the group to
which that species belongs must be taken into consideration also, as
well as the liability to modification of each and every part.

Differences of size, unless excessive, are of little value, provided the
parts preserve their relative proportions, and in judging of differences
in proportion the age of the individual must be taken into account.
This fact was very strongly impressed upon the writer many years ago
by the study of an extensive series of skulls of the Orang, represent-
ing individuals of all ages, and Mr. J. A. Allen has noted similar dif-
ferences, due to age, in skulls of the spider monkey.

The examination of some considerable series of skeletons of various
animals has confirmed my belief in the existence of a large amount of
individual variation, while at the same time creating an equal. belief
that, as a rule, the difference between specific and individual variation
is readily recognizable.

In the present case the amount of variation is no more than might
be expected to be found in any large bird were an equal series of bones
examined. The skulls in particular present a striking similarity not
only in shape but in size, and of seventeen crania ten have exactly
the same parietal breadth, while the largest differs from the smallest
by little more than 6"™, a difference that must be considered trivial
when the size of the skull is taken into account. Moreover, this vari-
ation is due to two skulls, one of which is unusally large, while the other
is equally small.

By far the largest skull on record is one collected by Professor Milne
and now in the museum of the University of Cambridge, England. The
measurements of this specimen appear in the table given farther on.

The shape of the foramen magnum and the number of perforations
EXPEDITION TO FUNK ISLAND. 517

in the depressions for the supraorbital glands are of no value whatever,
nor is the varying outline of the region bounded by the supraorbital,
temporal, and crotaphyte fosse of much more importance, since these
are all characters largely influenced by age.

Mr. G. K. Gilbert’s address on special processes of research sug-
gested that the graphic method might be employed to good advantage
in showing the relative sizes and range of variation in the crania, and
also in some of the other bones, as well as the correspondence in size
between bones from the right and left sides.

give the length, the horizontal columns the breadth, in millimeters. Black dots indicate parietal
breadth; circles indicate frontal breadth.

The table giving the relative measurements of crania shows that, as
might have been expected, the length is subject to greater positive va-
riation than either the frontal or parietal breadth, although the com-
parative variation of these parts is greater than the linear variation.
The table shows very clearly too that the frontal and parietal width of
the greater number of crania is the same—48™, and that the frontal
width is slightly in excess of the parietal.

The amount of linear variation is 15™™, the frontal 7™™, and the pari-
etal 8™™,
518 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The vertebra differ considerably among themselves in size, but for
reasons already given it is impossible to determine the amount of varia-
tion in the vertebral column taken in its entirety.

The odontoid notch of the atlas presents great diversity of shape, ap-
pearing in two cases as a mere slit, while in three out of fifteen speci-
mens ossification has bridged over the notch and converted it into a
foramen so that the atlas presents very much the appearance of having
belonged to one of the higher altrices. -

The shape and size of the neural canal varies, but it is always wider
than high. The centrum of the axis is subject to much variation in
size and shape, and the various processes are equally diversified. In
very rare instances the vertebral artery sends a branch upward through
a minute foramen at the base of the metapophysis, but ordinarily there
is only a notch present at this spot. The sixth to ninth cervicals, in-
clusive, have many features in common and these resemblances render
it extremely difficult to distinguish them from one another when, as in
the present instance, a large number are mixed together, since, for ex-
ample, the sixth vertebra of a large bird is almost the exact counterpart
of the seventh of a smaller specimen. In fact, but for Professor Owen’s
memoir on the Great Auk, the “ making up” of skeletons would have
been extremely difficult owing to the amount of individual variation.

The tenth cervical, however, was shown by Professor Owen’s paper
to have a very characteristic shape, being distinguished ‘by a broad
hypapophysis directed forward, and this furnished one point of depart-
ure for the arrangement of the vertebral column.

In the dorsal region there are differences in the development of the
hypapophyses, but these seem as might be supposed, to be correlated
with differences in the size and strength of individuals.

The length, strength, and curvature of dorsal and sternal ribs is of
course variable, and the number of epipleural appendages seems to have
been by no means constant.

It may be said that comparatively few epipleurals could be found, as
these little bones are so thin that they readily decompose.

The skeleton described by Professor Owen seems to have been that
of a very old bird, and epipleurals were present on the second pair of
cervical ribs, this, in the light of the material in hand, being of ex-
tremely rare occurrence.

A most interesting and instructive variation is of frequent occurrence
in the  sacram ” which is composed of fourteen vertebre, the first bear-
ing the eighth, and ordinarily the last, pair of ribs. But it often hap-
pens that the second sacral also shows articulations, indicating the
presence of a ninth pair of ribs, and it is interesting to note that when
this extra pair of ribs is present there is usually found to be arudimen-
tary pair of parapophyses developed on the first true sacral, as if the
rib creating force had been felt still further down the line of vertebre.

Twenty-three out of one hundred and forty-four sacra had an extra,
EXPEDITION TO FUNK ISLAND. 519

ninth, pair of ribs, and one had an extra rib on one side only. In one
case the ninth pair of ribs was completely fused with the sacrum, show-
ing not the slightest trace of former articulation, although the eighth
pair was free. Twenty-three sacra also, bet not those just noted, were
composed of fifteen vertebrie, owing to the inclusion of the seventh
dorsal by anchylosis. Of course the number of caudals included in the
sacral mass may be one less or one more, this depending largely on the
age of the individual; but the normal *‘sacrum” is composed of five
pre-sacrals, three true sacrals, and six uro-sacrals.

The Great Auk has the characteristic alcine sternum, and this is
subject to the same variations found in other members of the family,
the xiphoidal extremity being entire, perforate or notched.

These differences are largely due to age, notches becoming trans-
formed into foramina, and foramina being obliterated by the extension
of ossification into the membrane filling the vacuities. The same thing
may be seen to some extent in the Loons, and the character of the
xiphoid extremity of the sternum has by no means the same value among
the generalized water birds that it has among the more specialized
Passeres.

The extra ribs furnish another case in point, for although variation
in the number of ribs is liable to occur among mammals, and is not in-
frequent in passerine birds, such variation would naturally be oftener
found in more generalized forms.

The greater the number of similar skeletal parts and the more gen-
eralized the form the greater would seem the tendency to variation.
Thus among the Urodele Batrachia the number of presacral vertebree
is not specifically constant, and so frequent are variations in the post-
sacral region that total number of vertebre is almost of no importance
even as a Specific character.

Fishes might seem to offer an exception to this for in the families Ser-
ranide, Sparide and Carangide the number of abdominal and caudal ver-
tebre is not only remarkably constant for the species, but even for the
family. But these fishes have a comparatively small number of verte-
bral segments (generally ten to fourteen), while in other members
of the same superfamily, groups in which the number of vertebre is
greater, the amount of variation is greater. And the specialized Aca-
thopterygians mentioned stand in relation to other fishes much as the
Passeres do to other birds.* Occasionally eight pairs of ribs were con-
nected with the costal margin of the sternum, the normal number thus
attached being seven.

It would be interesting to know if the sterna with eight pairs of cos-
tal facets belonged to the birds, with nine pairs of ribs, but this ques-
tion can not be answered, although from one or two similar instances

that have come under my notice among other birds it is quite probable
that this was the case.

al

* For the above facts pertaining to fishes I am indebted to Dr. Theo. Gill.
520 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The following table gives the result of the examination of thirty-one
sterna, although it should be said that in some cases one costal border
was wholly or partially lacking. Still as only one case occurs among
the entire sterna in which the number of ribs attached to each side
varied, the fact is comparatively unimportant.

Of the sterna with eight pairs of articular facets two had evidently
borne a hemapophysis attached to the second, posterior cervical rib.
While the coracoid presents considerable variety in the amount of de-
velopment of the epicoracoid as well as in the shape and extent of the
sternal articular surface, it is always unmistakable in its general con-
tour, and the same may be said of nearly all the bones of the Great
Auk.

The greater number of humeri are from 103 to 108 ™™ in length, and
it is interesting to note that the mean of three hundred humeri agrees
very nicely with these figures, being 105.75 ™™,

This bone, perhaps the most characteristic of the entire skeleton,
seems to vary less in its proportions than any of the other long bones,
not presenting such perceptible differences in diameter as are found in
either the femur or tibia.

It is a little singular that the greatest pmomnt of linear variation—
taking into consideration the length of the bone—should be found in the
femur, while it also shows very considerable differences of proportion,
some femora being much more slender than others of the same length,
the longest not always being the strongest.

The same differences of length and proportions found in the femur
obtain to a lesser degree in the tibia, and also in the tarsus. This last
bone occasionally develops a small tubercle on the postero-internal edge,
about where the first metatarsal arises in four-toed birds, a pecaliariy,
noticed by Professor Milne.

Thirteen out of one hundred and forty-two tarsi have this tubercle,
and although it ordinarily appears to form an integral part of the tarsus
there are some specimens which indicate that in young birds it may
have been free, so that the tubercle probably represents a rudimentary
first metatarsal.

This and the frequent presence of an extra pair of ribs would seem to
be reversionary characters, hinting at some ancestral form with more
digits and more ribs than the Great Auk.

The measurements of so considerable a number of bones from oppo-
site sides may be looked upon as throwing some light on the question
of correspondence in size between bones from the right and left sides,
EXPEDITION TO FUNK ISLAND. 521

although naturally the results are by no means so satisfactory as if each
pair of bones came from one individual.

The bones measured were taken at hap-hazard, care being taken only
to select such as were in good condition and whose measurements
would not be lessened by any wearing away of their extremities. In
the three following tables the vertical columns show the number of in-
dividuals, the horizontal giving the extreme length of the bone, ina
straight line, in millimeters. The unbroken line represents bones from
the right side, the interrupted line those from the left. In all cases an
equal number of bones were taken from either side.

In all cases the perpendicular column indicates number of individ-
uals, the horizontal column length in millimeters.

EXPEDITION TO FUNK ISLAND. 523

It is singular that the closest correspondence between the curves rep-
resenting right and left sides should be exhibited by the diagrams giv-
ing the measurements of the femur, the most variable bone—while the
least harmony is found among the humeri, bones which differ least
among themselves.

This discrepancy is caused by an unusually large number of left hu-
meri having a length of 110™™, but on the whole the curves follow one
another very closely, the maximum point being reached with great una-
nimity, and the sizes of the bones decreasing or increasing quite regu-
larly from that.

From the examination of this large amount of material it would seem
that considerable variation may exist in the size of individuals, that the
number of ribs may be slightly inconstant and that a certain amount
of variation may be found in the development of the various processes
of the vertebre. On the other hand the skull, sternum, and pelvis
afford very substantial comparative characters.

In regard to the question of size, it can be said that there is nothing,
as in the case of Didine remains, to indicate sexual difference in this
particular, for between the largest and the smallest bones may be found
all intermediate grades.

This, however, is what might have been expected, for the Alcide »
present but slight sexual variations in size, while Professor Newton
has pointed out a good reason for the slight amount of proportional
variation in the fact that the bones represent individuals from the same
epoch and locality, and not those separated from one another by long
intervals of time or space.

C.—List OF BooKS AND PAPERS RELATING TO THE GREAT AUK

Although it is believed that no paper of importance has been omitted
from this list, it is by no means a complete bibliography of the literature
pertaining to the Great Auk.

The numerous incomplete lists of specimens have been designedly
left out, as well as the republications of many articles and some short
notes that contributed nothing to the subject.

Some short notes are cited from their bearing on particular points in
the history of the Great Auk, and the earlier allusions to the Garefowl
in America are included, owing to the general interest attached to
them. :

I am greatly indebted to Mr. Stejneger for assistance in preparing
this portion of the paper, and have drawn upon the bibliography of Dr.
Coues and from the monograph of Mr. Grieve, which contains a host of
valuable references to the earlier notices of the Great Auk.

On page 133 speaks of “one iland named Penguin, where we may drive them

almost the exact language used by Whitbourne, and it looks as if it had
been taken by him from Parkhurst. Parkhurst seems to have been engaged
in the fishing business, and gives a very careful account of the composition
of the Newfoundland fishing fleet, showing that in his time the English were
greatly in the minority.

of Fogo Island make voyages there to load with birds and eggs. When the
water is smooth they make their shallop fast to the shore, lay their gang-
boards from the gunwale of the boat to the rocks, and then drive as many
penguins on board as she will hold, for the wings of these birds being re-
markably short they cannot fly. But it has been customary of late years
for several crews of men to live all summer on that island, for the sole pur-
pose of killing birds for their feathers; the destruction which they have
made is incredible. If a stop is not soon put to that practice, the whole breed
will be diminished to almost nothing, particularly the penguins, for this is
now the only island they have left to breed upon.” This long quotation is

While Audubon never saw the bird alive, his figure is undoubtedly the best
published. The Great Auk was a stout, thick-necked bird, built much on

* the plan of the Razorbill, yet nearly all plates represent it as a sort of cross
between a Murre and a Loon, with a small head, slender neck, and unduly
obese body. Audubon’s figure was probably made from an English specii-en,
and his knowledge of the bird’s habits and habitat was derived from hearsay.

THE GREAT AUK.
ABOUT ONE-QUARTER NATURAL SIZE.

From the specimen in the U. S. Nationa) Museum, No. 57338.

Wilhelm Schluter, of Halle, Germany, from whom this Auk was procured, gives
its history as follows: It was obtained by Mr. Salmin, of Hamburg, from Iceland;
by him sold to a merchant of Hamburg, who sold it to Mr. Goetz, of Dresden, who
in turn parted with it to Mr. Schluter.

In the U. S. National Museum catalogue of birds it is recorded as g ad. Eldey,

Since the photograph was taken from which the accompanying plate was made
the specimen has been remounted in a different attitude and shortened between two
and three inches. It is still, like nearly all mounted skins, considerably too long,
but could not be shortened any more without cutting the skin, a proceeding that,
under the circumstances, was deemed inadmissible.

Before remounting a full-sized figure of the specimen was made.

EGG OF THE GREAT AUK.

ABOUT FOUR-FIFTHS NATURAL SIZE.

From the original in the collection of the U. S. National Museum, No. 15141.

The specimen measures 125"™ by 74™™, This egg was obtained from the Academy
of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, Pa., and was originally in the collection of O,
des Murs.

It is the egg figured on Plate I, Revue et Magazin de Zoologie, 1863, and the ene
to which des Murs refers in the text as having been broken and restored. That des
Murs had three eggs of the Great Auk is extremely improbable, as he states that he
never even saw more than the two in his possession, and the reference to three is
either a slip of the pen or of memory.

The egg seems to have been washed since it was figured, and the freshness of the
markings thereby impaired.

EGG OF THE GREAT AUK.
FIRE-MAKING APPARATUS IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

By WALTER HOUGH.

Man in his originals seems to be a thing unarmed and naked, and unable to help
itself, as needing the aid of many things; therefore Prometheus makes haste to find
out fire, which suppediates and yields comfort and help in a manner to all human
wauts and necessities; so that if the soul be the form of forms, and the hand be the
instrument of instruments, fire deserves well to be called the succor of succors, or
the help of helps, that infinite ways afford aid and assistance to all labors and the
mechanical arts, and to the sciences themselves.—Bacon.— Wisdom of the ancients,
Prometheus, Works, vol. iii. Lond., 1825, p. 72.

There is a prevalent belief that to make fire by rubbing two pieces
of wood is very difficult. It is not so; the writer has repeatedly made
fire in thirty seconds by the twirling sticks and in five seconds with the
bow drill.

Many travelers relate that they have seen various peoples make fire
with sticks of wood. The mostcommon way, by twirling one stick upon
another is well described by Pere Lafitau with reference to the Hurons
and Iroquois.

They take two pieces of cedar wood, dry and light; they hold one piece firmly down
with the knee and in a cavity which they have made with a beaver-tooth or with
the point of a knife on the edge of one of these pieces of wood which is flat and a
little larger, they insert the other piece which is round and pointed and turn and
press down with so much rapidity and violei.ce that the material of the wood agi-
tated with vehemence falls off in a rain of fire by means of a crack or little canal which
leaps from the cavity over a match [slow match]. This match receives the sparks
which fall, and preserves them for a long time and from which they can make a large
fire by touching it to other dry materials.*

All these descriptions omit details that are essential to the compre-
hension of the reader. There is a great knack in twirling the vertical
stick. It is taken between the palms of the outstretched hands, which
are drawn backwards and forwards past each other almost to the finger
tips, thus giving the dri!l a reciprocating motion. At the same time a
strong downward pressure, is given which may be called a rotating
pressure. The hands move down the drill; when they nearly reach the
lower end they are brought back to the top with a quick, deft motion,
This is repeated as rapidly as possible, If the lower part of the drill is
observed when the motion begins it will be seen that powder is ground

(

off and is collecting in the canal cut into the cavity from the side of the
lower piece of wood. Soon, as the motion progresses, the powder be-
gins to increase and to get darker, the odor of burning wood is noticed
and the smoke is seen. Probably when the next motion ceases there
will be a little curl of peculiarly colored smoke, which shows that active
combustion has begun. The pellet of ground-off wood may now be
shaken out of the slot or canal. At first it isdark; a thin line of smoke
comes from it; gradually the fire spreads through it unul it glows.
In this semi-charred dust the heat is held until it increases to about
450°, or higher. Everything depends on keeping the dust in a heap;
it is impossible to make fire without doing this. This is true in all
kinds of wooden fire-making tools.

By examination of many specimens of aboriginal fire apparatus it is
found that both the drill and lower piece, which, for convenience, shall
be called the hearth, must be of dry, inflammable wood. Wood that is
soft from incipient decay is chosen; most often pieces riddled by worms.
This is the felicis materia spoken of by Festus as used by the Vestals.
Wood of this kind is not only easier of ignition, but it is ground off
more easily and retains the heat generated until enough is accumu:
lated to ignite the powder. In strong, skillful hands fire can be made
from wood that does not wholly fulfill these conditions.

Woods vary in combustibility, depending on their density, coloring
matter, and, perhaps, their chemical constitution. Sap wood of juniper
and soft, white maple yield fire with the bow, but light mesquite is the
best of all. The vascular, starchy flowering stems of plants have always
been a favorite fire-generating material.

It will be seen that the Eskimo attachments to the simple drill enable
him to use wood ordinarily of no account for making fire. Sand is used
by Indians and other peoples to increase the friction.

From the material in the collection at the Museum, it is found that
nearly every method that is or was used in the world is represented.
The following classification, based upon the presumed order of develop-
ment of the invention, is followed in this paper:

I.—Fire-making by reciprocating motion.

1. Simple, two-stick apparatus : Indians of the two Americas, Ainos, Somalis,
Kaffirs, Veddahs, Australians, etc.
2. Four-part apparatus: Eskimo, some Indians, Hindoos, and Dyaks.
3. Weighted drill, with spindle whorl; Iroquois and Chukchis.
IJ.—Fire-making by sawing.
Malays, Burmese, etc.
III.—Fire-making by plowing.
Polynesians, Australians, and Papuans.
IV.—Fire-making by percussion.

1. With pyrites, or stone containing tron, and flint; Eskimo and northern In-
dians.

2 With flint and steel; General,
FIRE-MAKING APPARATUS. 533

i. FIRE-MAKING BY RECIPROCATING MOTION.
1. SIMPLE TWO-STICK APPARATUS.

This method may be said to have a world-wide distribution, and to
have had no narrow range in time. It is a very interesting study to
observe the many different practices that have been superadded to the
simple task of twirling two sticks with the design of creating fire. It
is also instructive to note how fixed have become tribal characters in
so smail a thing as the shaping of the elements of the fire drill. It has
well been said by Dr. Schweinfurth, that—

A people, as long as they are on the lowest step of their development, are far bet-
ter characterized by their industrial products than they are either by their habits,
which may be purely local, or by their own representations, which (rendered in their
rude and unformed language) are often incorrectly interpreted by ourselves. If we
possessed more of these tokens we should be in a position to comprehend better than

we do the primitive condition of many a nation that has now reached a high degree
of culture.*

This fact holds good with reference to tribes in a higher plane than
the learned writer included in this statement, in this way. There are
many little things that have not been subject to the modification of
time, intercourse, or environment, but co-exist with an art. To particu-
larize: Prof. E. S. Morse has shown the value of the simple act of re-
leasing an arrow from a bow-string as a classifier. Close attention to
the minor acts and arts will reveal much more than the nice measure-
ments of man’s practically unmodified skeleton.

Differences that have become functional in the arts have come down
from an early period; when they can be found they are of the greatest
value as aids in ethnology. :

The ethnography of the simple fire drill is studied geographically,
beginning in North America with the most northerly tribes that use it,
and ranging from north to south in the different sections of the country,
among the tribes from which there are specimens in the Museum.
Other countries are examined from west to east.

The Sitkan fire-drill spindle is unusually long and thick (fig. 1). Both
hearth and drills are of the Thuja gigantea, a tree that enters so largely
into the life of the Indians along this coast. The wood grinds off
very well with much friction; at ordinary speed there is soon a small
heap of powder at the bottom of the fire slot. The latter is deeply cut in
from the side nearly to the center of the fire-hole. The whole hearth
has been charred at the fire. This repels moisture, and also renders
it easier to ignite the wood, charring being a process somewhat analo-
gous to the decay of wood by rotting. If kept carefully in a dry place,
this apparatus was perfectly adequate for the purpose of the Sitkan,
and in his skillful hands would no doubt give the spark in a minute or
so. The long drill would indicate that two worked at it consecutively

534 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

to keep up a continuous motion, as will be noted in the use of the
Aino drill (p. 551).

For tinder, the bark of the arbor vite was used. It is finely frayed,
and is much improved by being slightly charred. They also use, pref-
erably, a tinder made from a fungus, because itis “quicker,” 7. ¢., ignites
more readily than the frayed bark.

The hearth is squared and measures 23 inches; the drill is of equal
length.

Going southward from Sitka the next fire-making set in the series
is from Bella-Bella, British Columbia. These Indians are of the Sali-
shan stock, and are called Bilhulas. The horizontal is a piece of cedar
wood dressed square on three faces. Itis apparently a piece of an oar or
spear handle. The fire-holes are shallow, and the fire slots are quile
narrow (fig. 2). The drills have been scored longitudinally near the
rubbing end; this may be a device to cause the wood to wear away more
rapidly, and furnish fuel to the incipient fire. Fire has evidently been
made with this set. Both parts are 14 feet long; the drill is much
thinner than that of Sitka. The tinder is of frayed cedar bark.

From a southern family of the Salishan stock, called the Quinaielt In-
dians, of Washington Territory, the museum has a complete set col-
lected by the late Charles Willoughby. It consists of a hearth, two
drills, and a slow-match. The hearth isarounded piece of cedar wood;
opposite the fire-holes it is dressed flat, so as to rest firmly on the ground.
There are three fire-holes with wide notches. The drills taper to each
end, that is, are larger in the middle (fig. 3). The powder, a fine brown
dust, collects at the junction of the slot and fire-hole, where they form
a lip and there readily ignites. This side of the hearth is semi-decayed.
No doubt the slots were cut in that side for the purpose of utilizing this
quality. The drills are bulged toward the middle, thereby rendering
it possible to give great pressure and at the same time rapid rotation
without allowing the hands to slip down too rapidly, a fault in many
fire-drilis. The slow-match is of frayed cedar bark, about a yard
long, folded squarely together, and used section by section. Mr. Wil-
loughby says:

The stick with three cavities was placed upon the ground, the Indian kneeling and
placing a knee upon each end. He placed one end of the smaller stick in one of the
cavities, and, holding the other end between the palms of his hands, kept up a rapid
half-rotary motion, causing an amount of friction sufficient to produce fire. With this
he lighted the end of the braided slow-match of cedar bark. This was often carried
for weeks thusignited and held carefully beneath the blanket to protect it from wind
and rain.

Fireis easily procured with this set. It takes but aslighteffort to cause
a wreath of aromatic smoke to curl up, and the friction easily grinds off a
dark powder, which collects between the edges of the slot. When this
ignites it drops down the slot in a little pellet, and falls upon the tinder
placed below to receive it. Both drill and hearth are 18 inches long.

536 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The Klamaths, of Oregon, of the
Lutuamian stock, use a fire appar-
atus that looks very much like that
of the Utes. The hearth is a
rounded piece of soft wood thin-
ned down at the ends (fig. 4). The
drill is a long, round arrow-stick,
with a hard-wood point set in with
resin and served with sinew (see
Ute drill, fig. 7). The holes in this
hearth are very small, being less
than three-eighths of an inch in
diameter. They are in the center,
and the fire slot being cut into the
rounded edge widens out below, so
that the coal can dropdown and get
draught. The wood is quite soft,
apparently being sap-wood of yew
or cedar, while the drill-point is of
the hardest wood obtainable. It is
probable that sand is used on the
drill. The hearth is 13 inches long,
and the drill 26.

The Chinooks, a tribe of Indians
of a separate stock, called Chi-
nookan, formerly lived about the
mouth of the Columbia River, in
Oregon, but are now nearly ex-
tinct. Hon. James G. Swan, the
veteran explorer, investigator, and
collector among the Northwest
coast tribes, says that the Chi-
nooks are the best wet-weather
fire-makers he ever knew.*

To kindle a fire the Chinook twirls rap-
idly between the palms a cedar stick, the
point of whichis pressed into a small hol-
low in a flat piece of the same material,
the sparks falling on finely frayed bark.

Sticks are commonly carried for the pur-
pose, improving with use.t

Mr. Paul Kanet describes the
hearth as a‘ flat piece of dry cedar,

in which a small hollow is cut with a channel for the ignited charcoal
to run over. In a short time sparks begin to fall through the channel
upon finely frayed cedar bark placed underneath, which they soon
ignite.” The Ahts and Haidas also use cedar fire-sticks of the usual
Indian kind.

The Hupa Indians of California are of the Athapascan stock. Their
fire-drill is a carefully made piece of apparatus (fig. 5). The hearth is
ot a reddish, punky piece, probably of mesquite, Prosopis juliflora,
somewhat harder than the drill, which is charred slightly for some dis-
tance along the grinding end. Fire has been made in one of the holes ;
the others show the rough, frayed cavities which have been made to
start the drill. The notches at each end of the hearth seem to be to
facilitate the tying of the pieces together as a precaution to prevent
their loss or separation. They are usually intrusted into the hands of
the most skillful fire-maker, who wraps them up to keep them from be-
coming damp. The effectiveness of the sticks increases with use and |
age; a Stick and hearth that have been charred by the former making
of fire in most cases yields the spark in half the time required for new
apparatus. Another advantage is that the drill is softer from incipient
decay.

That this set is in the highest degree efficient is shown by the fact
that the writer repeatedly got a glowing coal, the size of a pea, from it
in less than twenty seconds. The hearth is 18 and the drill 21 inches
long. ;

The McCloud River Indians (Copehan stock) make the drill from the
buckeye tree.

The Indians of Washoe, Nevada, from their language, have been
classed by the Bureau of Ethnology as a separate stock, the Washoan.
Stephen Powers, many years ago collected a rather remarkable hearth
from these Indiaus. It has eight rather small holes, in every one of
which fire has been made. The wood is soft, well-seasoned pine. <Ap-
parently sand has been made use of to get greater friction, as is the
eustom of the Zuiiis and Apaches. This device, in a measure, obviates
the necessity of having tinder-like wood, or wood in a state of partial
decay. For the drill any hardwood cylindrical stick might be em-
ployed. A strip of buckskin about an inch wide is passed around the
hearth over the fire holes to keep them dry (fig. 6).

At the end of the hearth is a mass of cement made of the resin of a
pine mixed with sand, apparently ; a kind of material used by the In-
dians over a large area in the Great Basin and southward to fix their
arrowheads, pitch the water-bottles, and for other purposes. It is quite
probable that this stick was the property of an arrow-maker, whose
need of fire to melt the somewhat intractable cement, caused him to
combine these functions in one tool.

It has a better finish, and displays greater skill in its manufacture
than the fire-tools of the neighboring tribes of Shoshonian (Utes) and
538

Moquelumnian stocks.

In fact, it has a close affinity in appearance to

those of the very near Athapascan
(Hupa, ete.) stock. It is a matter
of very great interest to compare
with this a stick from the Macken-
zie River. (See Fig. 28.) The re-
semblance is striking; it is as
though one found a word of famil-
iar sound and import in an unex-
pected piace. The related tribes
of the Indians dwelling on the
Mackenzie have a wider range than
the distance between the localities
whence the respective sticks came;
in fact, the Athapascans range
about 50 degrees in latitude and
the southern colonies of this great
family are only about 250 miles
southeast of the Washoans, while,
as has been stated, the Hupas are
quite near,

It would be presumptuous to say
at present that this tool is a rem-
nant of the influence of the Atha-
pascan wave that swept along
the Great Interior Basin, leaving
groups here and there in Califor-
nia and other parts to mark its
progress, but there is more to its
credit than a coincidence of form
and function.

The museum is in possession of a
complete collection of fire-making
material from the tribes of the
Shoshonian stock. They were col-
lected by Maj. J. W. Powell. The
native name for the Ute fire set is
whu-tu-ni-weap. While the lower
member of the set—the hearth—
differs among the several tribes in
point of material, shape, etc., the
spliced drill is characteristic of the
whole stock. It has never been
noticed outside of the southern
part of the Great Interior Basin

straight sprout, usually the former.
At one end a short piece of very
hard wood—greasewood, sarcoba-
tus vermiculatus—is set in and
lashed with sinew. It resembles
the Shoshonian arrows, which are
foreshafted in this way. They also
use sand in common with other
neighboring tribes.

The Pai-Utes, of Southern Utah,
make their hearths of a short,
rounded piece usually of the sap-
wood of juniper. It is tied to the
drill with a thong of buckskin when
not in use (fig. 7). The drillis like
the usual one, just described. This
is the common form of the Pai-Ute
apparatus. The small, two-holed
hearth of rounded form, and the
shortened, spliced drill are for con-
venience of carrying, this kind be-
ing used by hunters while away
from the lodges. Mr.S. J. Hare
says that the men do not usually
make the fire, except when out on
a hunting excursion. At the lodge
it is the squaw’s duty to make the
fire when it is needed.

The Pai-Ute is rarely at a loss to
get fire; he is master of various
devices. Mr. Hare, who was among
the Utes for some time, states that
when the Indian is in need of a
light he uses either the flint and
steel, the drill, or, if these are not
at hand, he takes two branches,
and rubs one up and down on the
other, soon getting fire. The Aus-
tralians are said to have practiced
fire-making by rubbing in the way
mentioned. This is the only obser-
vation collected of its occurrence in
America. It is, in all probability,
a difficult, unusual way; only prac-
ticed under pressure of necessity
among the Utes. They take great

pride in their skill; to be a quick fire-maker is to achieve fame in the
tribe. They are fond of exhibiting their art to white travelers in the
hope of gain.

Another form of hearth (fig. 8.) is made of yucca flower stalk, like
those of the Apache and Navajos. The drill is of tule reed, set with a
very hard wood head. It is suggested that the reason for splicing
the drill is that the hard wood of the kind used for the head (grease-
wood) can not be procured in pieces long enough to make the whole
drill. This set is apparently one used as a fixture in the Ute domestic
economy, the squaws having to light the fire. The duty is mainly
relegated to the females in several other Indian tribes, and among the
Eskimo. Mr. Catlin says that the Sioux objected to letting the squaws
have their portraits painted, saying that their women had never taken
scalps, nor done anything better than make fires and dress skins.*
The hearth and drill last figured are respectively 20 and 23 inches
long, while in the hunting set (fig. 8) the length is 7 and 18 inches.

The Wind River Shoshones are also represented (fig. 9). The hearth
is of hard wood, rudely hacked out, and rounded. Upon the slanting
edge are eight holes, or shallow depressions, prepared for the drill,
with notches cut in to meet them from the sides. The drill is a willow
branch, 25 inches long, with a hard wood head mortised in, and served
with buckskin. It is most probable that sand was used with this set,
because, if the parts are not models, it would be necessary to use it on
sticks of equal hardness like these. I am inclined to believe that they
are models, from their appearance, and from the difficulty of setting up a
pyrogenic friction upon them even with sand. They were collected
some fifteen years ago by Maj. J. W. Powell.

The Mokis are the most differentiated members of the Shoshonian
stock. Mrs. T. E. Stevenson collected the two excellent fire-making
sets in the Museum from the Moki Pueblos. The hearth is a branch
of the very best quality of soft wood. In one hearth an end has
been broken off. but there still remain eighteen tire-holes, showing that
it was in use for a long time and highly prized (fig. 10). The drill isa
roughly dressed branch ofhard wood. It is comparatively easy to make
fire on this apparatus. In the set numbered 126,694 these conditions are
reversed; the hearth is tolerably bard wood and the drill soft wood.

. The Moki fire-tools are used now principally in the estufas to light
the sacred fie and the new fire as do the Zunis, and the Aztecs ef
Mexico did hundreds of years ago. They use tinder of fungus or dried
grass rubbed between the hands.

By their language the Zuiii people belong to a distinct stock of In-
dians. Their fire-sticks are of the agave stalk, a soft, pithy wood with
harder longitudinal fibers, rendering it a good medium for the pur-
pose of making fire.

preserving the fire for any

(Figs. 11 and 12.)

Viewed in another aspect
than as an implement of

this set is an important
cult apparatus in the won-
derfully complicated relig-
ious worship of the Zunis.

them to the list of peoples who have held it in similar reverance and
have practiced similar customs all over the world,
ranging widely in time. The wetting of the drill,
increasing their labor, may be done to please their
Gods.

This art must have been practiced for a long time
in this region, for Mr. Henry Metcalf found a hearth
(Fig. 13) with three fire-holes in a cave-dwelling at
Silver City, New Mexico. It is apparently very an-
cient. The wood is much altered and has become
heavy by impregnation with some salt, probably niter.

The Apaches and Navajos belong to the great Atha-
pascan stock, that ranges so widely in North America.
Capt. John G. Bourke, U. S. Army, collected the
hearth of yucca wood shown (Fig. 14), and says:

With the stick you now see, the Apache Indians in my pres-
ence made fire in not quite eight seconds by the watch, and one
asserted that he could make it in a number
of motions, which, on the watch, occupied
exactly two seconds, that is, under most
favorablecircumstances. The experiments,
made under my own observation, ran all
the way from eight to forty-seven seconds ;
sand is generally used, although not essen-
tial to success.
| Captain Bourke’s observation is
very interesting, as it records the
fact that the Apache is the most
skillful fire-maker in the world.
Many other tribes can make fire in
less than a minute; I think by far
the majority of them, but there is no
eight-second record, while if he could
prove his ability to do it in two see-
onds he would arrive at the facility
of striking a match.

Mr. William F. Corbusier has no-
ticed the fire-making of the Apache-
Yumas of Arizona (Yuman stock).*
They use a drill about 2 feet long
and one-half inch thick, made of
o-oh-kad-je, or “ Fire-stick bush.” Its
end is dipped in sand and drilled on
a soit piece of agave or yucca stalk

and also use a flint and steel. For tinder they use
dry grass or bark fiber. They use also a fungus,
polyporus sp., for the same purpose.

Another reference to the fire making of this stock
(Yuman) is found in the translation by the late Dr.
Charles Rau of the writings of Father Baegert on
the Californian Peninsula.* He says:

To light a fire, the Californian makes no use of steel and
flint, but obtains it by the friction of two pieces of wood.
One of them is cylindrical and pointed at one end, which fits
into a round cavity in the other, and by turning the cylin-
drical piece with great rapidity between their hands, like a
twirling-stick, they succeed in igniting the lower piece if
they continue the process for a sufficient length of time.

The Navajo fire-set looks very much like a mere
makeshift. The hearth is a piece of yucca stalk
and the fire-holes have but a shallow side notch.
The drill is a broken arrow shaft, to which has been
rudely lashed with a cotton rag a smaller piece of
yucca wood (fig. 15). ‘This carelessness, which it is
rather than lack of skill, is characteristic of the Na-
vajos in their minor implements. They resemble
the crude Apache in this. One thinks of the Nava-
jos only with regard to their fine blanket weaving
and silver working, so well presented by Dr. Wash-
ington Matthews in the reports of the Bureau of
Ethnology, and does not consider their arts in other
lines.+

Mr. Thomas C. Battey, a Friend, long missionary
among the Indians, kindly gives a description of
the Kiowan fire-making process, not now practiced
among them, but shown to him as a relic of an
abandoned art:

A piece of very hard and coarse, rough-grained wood, per-
haps 8 inches in length, 2 in width, and three-fourths of an
inch in thickness is procured. In one side of this and near
one edge several holes are made, about one-half an inch in
diameter by five-eighths of an inch in depth, rounded at the
bottom, but left somewhat rough or very slightly corrugated,
In the edge nearest these holes a corresponding number of
smaller and tapering holes are made, opening by a small ori-
fice into the bottom of each of the larger ones. These are
made very smooth.

A straight stick, also of hard, rough-grained wood, about 8
or 10 inches in Jength, about the size they usually make their

arrows or larger, is provided. Both ends of this
are rounded, but one end is made smooth, the
other is left slightly rough. The dried pith of
some kind of reed, or more probably of the yucca,
some fibers of the same loosely prepared like
hackled flax, some powdered charcoal, I think
formed by charring the yucca, and a piece of hard
thick leather similar to sole leather, completes
the outfit, which is carried in a leather bag made
for the purpose. The first described piece of
wood is placed upon the knees of the operator
witha quantity of the fibrous substance beneath
it which has been powdered with charcoal dust ;
some of the latter is put into one of the holes
and the rough end of the stick inserted, the
other end is put into an indentation of the
leather placed under the chin, so that a gentle
pressure may be exerted. The spindle is then
rapidly revolved by rolling it one way and the
other between the hands. The friction thus pro-
duced by the rubbing of the roughened surfaces
ignites the fine coal dust, which, dropping as
sparks of fire through the orifice at the bottom
of the hole, falls into the dry fibrous prepara-
tion, thus igniting that, then by the breath
blowing upon it a flame is produced and com-
muunicated to some fine dry weod and a fire is
soon obtained. The whole operation occupies
but a few minutes.

One of the rudest fire-making appli-
ances in the Museum was collected by
Prof. W. M. Gabb, at Talamanca, Costa
Rica. The hearth is a rude billet of
charred, black wood, resembling mahog-
any. It has central holes, with no-gut-
ter usaally, though sometimes a shallow
notch is cut on both sides of the fire-
hole. The drill is a light branch, rather
crooked, but dressed down roughly with
a knife. Another hearth is of partly de-
cayed, worm-eaten wood; with this a
hard wood drill can be used, the hearth
wasting away instead of the drill (fig.
16.) The absence of any fire slot, that
is, the use of the central fire-hole, is
worthy of notice in this locality. I have
only observed its use in various parts of
the Eskimo area, from East Greenland
to Kadiak; outside of this range I have
not noticed it anywhere else among the.
FIRE-MAKING APPARATUS. 545

scriptions given it seems to have been practiced by the Caranchua
Indians, a recently extinct tribe in Texas and Mexico. (See below.)

These specimens from Costa Rica are the crudest fire tools, not to be
mere make shifts, that have come to my notice or have been described
in the literature examined. The Costa Rican Indians are very inter-
esting in their preservation of several other arts that may justly be
classed among the most ancient. One may be mentioned, that of bark
cloth making. Professor Gabb made quite a collection from Talamanea,
but has not left any notes on these remarkable people, who are well
worthy of the careful study of ethnologists.

A curious modification of this central hole plan is figured and de-
scribed in Oviedo, folio 90, as occurring in Hispaniola; that is, the West
Indies, Hayti, San Domingo, ete. He says that ‘‘two dry light sticks
of brown wood were tied firmly together, and the point of the drill of
a particular hard wood was inserted between the two and then worked.”
Mr. H. Ling Roth* thinks that if one can judge from the illustration
(which is a miserable one) in Benzoni’s work, the natives of Nicaragua
also used three sticks in making fire. Benzoni, however, says: t

All over India they light fire with two pieces of wood; although they had a great
deal of wax, they knew no use for it, and produced light from pieces of wild pine
wood.

From Oviedo’s description I am inclined to believe that the dust in
which the fire starts was allowed to fall below on tinder placed beneath
the hearth.

Through the kindness of Prof. F. W. Putnam, curator of the Peabody
Museum, at Cambridge, Mass., I have received an extract from a manu-
script written by Mrs. Alice W. Oliver, of Lynn, who, as a girl, in 1838
resided on Matagorda Bay, and learned the language and customs of
the Caranchua Indians, a separate stock, now thought to be extinct.

Mrs. Oliver says:

After the hut is built a fire is made, the squ.ws usually begging fire or matches from
the settlers, but, in case their fire is out and they have no other means of kindling it,
they resort to the primitive method of producing it by friction of wood. They
always carry their fire-sticks with them, keeping them carefully wrapped in several
layers of skins tied up with thongs and made into aneat package; they are thus kept
very dry, and as soon as the occasion for their use is over, they are immediately
wrapped up again and laid away.

These sticks are twoin number. One of themis held across the knees as they squat on
the ground, and is about two feet long, made of a close-grained, brownish-yellow wood
(perhaps pecan), half round in section ; the flat face, which is held upward, is about an
inch across. Three cylindrical holes about half an inch in diameter and of equal
depth, the bottoms slightly concave, are made in it. The three holes are equally
distant apart, about 2 inches, and the first one is the same distance from the end
of the stick, which rests upon the right knee. In one of the holes is inserted the
slightly-rounded end of a twirling stick made of a white, softer kind of wood, some-
what less than the diameter of the hole, so as to turn easily, and about 18 inches long.

alternating rotary motion is imparted. After continuing this for about five minutes
the abrasion of the softer wood causes a fine, impalpable dust to collect in the hole,
from which soon issues a thin, blue line of smoke.

As soon as the Indian sees this he quickly withdraws his twirler with one hand,
while with the other he catches up and crushes a few dry leaves previously placed
on a dry cloth close by (having been produced from thin wrappings, in which they
have been preserved for this very purpose, to serve as tinder), and quickly but
lightly sprinkles them in and around the hole, over which both hands are now held
protectingly, the head bent down, and the incipient fire fanned to a blaze with the
breath. As soon as the blaze has fairly caught, the stick and tinder are deftly turned
over upon a little pile of dry twigs and leaves, got ready beforehand, and the fire is
started.

This operation of getting fire is always performed by the men, and not by the
squaws. The fire is invariably bnilt in the center of the hut, upon the greund, and,
is usually kept burning, for the Indians never slept regularly, but whenever they
pleased, often asleep in the day time and awake nights, or vice versa, as they felt in-
clined. f

The Iroquois are unique in America, and perhaps in the world, in
making fire with the pump-drill. Several other tribes in America use
the pump drill to pierce stone and shell, for which purpose it is an ex-
cellent tool, but the mechanical difficulties lying in the way of making
fire with it have only been overcome by the Iroquois. Pump-drills are
intended for light, fine work, with uniform, light pressure; hence, with
little friction. The Iroquois have added this element by increasing the
size of the balance-wheel and stock. Mr. Morgan, in his “ League of
the Iroquois,” p. 381, figures a fire drill with a wooden stock 4 feet long
and 1 inch in diameter. This stock has at the upper end a string and
bow, while near the lower end is a ‘small wheel.” Mr. Morgan says
this is ‘an Indian invention of great antiquity. ”

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, of the Bureau of Ethnology, has kindly given
the writer a set of apparatus and valuable information with reference
to fire-making among the Iroquois, especially the Onondagas and Tusca-
roras. He states that at times when there is disease among the people
they say itis because the fire is “‘ old.” They then determine to make
‘‘ new fire, ” so all fires are put out and two slippery-elm logs are selected
and one of these is laid on the ground and a Y-shaped notch is cut on
the upper side. In this notch some tinder of dry slippery-elm is put
and three (mystic or sacred number) men at either end work the other
log backward and forward until fire is generated, and from this the fires
are lighted. He believes that the new fire is made at the winter feast
of the Iroquois. They say that the drill with the weight is their
own invention. They use elm for that also. In making the pump-drill
they sometimes cut an elm sapling and work out the drill, leaving
the tap root for the fore part, the knot for the weight, and part of the
stem for the top part of the drill.

It is not improbable that the Iroquois —the most advanced Indians
in some respects on the continent, invented this use of the widely dif-
fused pump-drill. It scarcely seems to be a practical way to make fire,

and, despite the assurances and beliefof the Iroquois, is not very ancient,
but was perhaps suggested by the white man. Indeed, Pere Lafitau,
that keen and careful observer, in his ‘‘Moeurs des Sauvages A meri-
quains,” written in 1724, on page 242, gives a description of Indian fire-
making that includes the Iroquois. He says:

The Hurons, the Iroquois, and the other peoples of North America do not make
fire from the veins of tlint, but rub two pieces of wood one against the other.

Then follows a description of fire-making, taken probably from the
Iroquois, that is as good an account of the Indian apparatus and the
way of working it as exists in the literature of the subject.

The drill was’ sufficient for its time for the reason that there was at
that period rarely necessity for generating fire; the art of fire preser-
vation was at its height.

The Cherokees, the most southerly of the Iroquois, Mr. James Mooney
states, kept fire buried in the mounds upon which the council houses
were built, so that if the house was destroyed by enemies the fire
would remain there for a year or so. The Cherokees use the simple
rotation apparatus, and, as far as Mr. Mooney can ascertain, never used
the pump-drill. They have a tradition that fire originally came out of
an old hollow syeamore tree (Platanus occidentalis).

Capt. John Smith tells how the Indians of Virginia made fire. He
says:

Their fire they kindled presently by chafing a dry pointed sticke in a hole of a little
square piece of wood, that firing itselfe, will so fire mosse, leaves, or anie such like drie
thing that will quickly burn.*

Writing in the first quarter of the next century, Beverley says:

They rubbed Fire out of particular sorts of Wood (as the Ancients did out of the
Ivy and Bays) by turning the end of a Piece that is soft and dry, like a Spindle on
its Inke, by which it heats and at length burns; to this they put sometimes also rotten
Wood and dry leaves to hasten the Work. t

Loskiel says of the Delawares:

Formerly they kindled fire by turning or twirling a dry stick, with great swiftness
on a dry board, using both hands.{

The Cherokees used for a drill the stalk of a composite plant
(senecio), and twirled it on a piece of wood. The art has long been out
of common use, but they employed the wooden drill to make fire for the
Green Corn Dance into the present century, though flint and steel was
then in vogue. Sometimes they passed the bow over drill. The tinder
was of a fungus or dried moss. Mr. James Mooney collected this in-
formation from some of the older men of the tribe in North Carolina,
who have retained the ancient customs and traditions, which the part
of the tribe removed to the West bas entirely lost.

The Creeks (Muskogean stock) had a regularly authorized fie maker,
who early in the morning made fire for the Green Corn Danee. The

apparatus that he made use of was four sticks placed end to end to form
a square cross. This was oriented, and at the junction of the sticks
new fire was made by friction.*

The Choctaws (also Muskogean) of Mississippi, Mr. M. F. Berry
writes, make fire in the following way: One stick of dry wood that
has a hole in it, with a smaller hole at the bottom going through, is
placed between the feet. Another piece made round and about 3 feet
long is made to revolve rapidly back and forth between the hands in
the hole, and the fire drops through the small hole below.. When new
fire was wanted for the Green Corn Dance, or other purposes, three men
would place themselves so that each in turn could keep the stick re-
volving without a stop, until fire would drop down through the hole,
which was nursed with dry material into a flame.

This form of the fire hearth is not represented in the collections of
the Museum; the only other description of a process closely like it was
given by Mr. Thomas C. Battey, who observed it among the Kiowas.
It was shown him at that time as a revival of the ancient method (p. 543).
The pierced fire hearth is somewhat impracticable, except in the Malay
sawing method. In the rotary drill the small hole would come over the
axis of least friction and heat. Unless provision was made for the dust
to fall freely underneath by a double cone perforation worked from
both sides the dust is likely to become obstructed and smother the
fire. It will be seen, too, that it departs very much from the simplicity
of the usual fire drill in the fact that a hole must be made through the
piece of wood, a matter of some difficulty before the introduction of iron
awls.

The Seminoles of Florida, the most Southern Muskoki, have neglected
the art of fire making by simple friction, unless at the starting of the
sacred fire for the Green Corn Dance, says Mr. Clay MacCauley.t A
tire is now kindled either by the common matches, ma-tci, or by steel
and flint.

Thus it is seen that wherever in the earlier period of the exploration
in this country the observation has been made, the Indian, almost with-
out exception, was found to be using the friction apparatus, consisting
of two sticks of wood. Some tribes had improved on the working of
the invention, while a very few others had perhaps arrived at the use
of the higher invention of the flint and pyrites.

Returning to the tribes of the wide central plains of our country, we
find that the flint and steel soon displaced the fire-sticks, except for
religious purposes. The Mandans, of the great Siouan stock, were using
flint and steel at the time of Mr. Catlin’s visit in 1832.4

There seems to be a great misapprehension among some of the writers

on ethnology, as to the general use of the bow-drill among the Indians.
In mentioning that the Sioux use the bow-drill, Schoolcraft is quoted as
authority. Asa matter of fact the reference is to a “made-up” figure
of a bow-drill set, marked “‘ Dacota.” On the same plate there is a
representation of an Iroquois pump-drill that is obviously wrong. The
lower part of the plate is taken up by a picture of an Indian woman
(presumably Californian) pounding acorns in a mortar. To complete
the absurdity the whole plate is entitled “* Methods of obtaining fire
by percussion,” and is placed in the text of a questionnaire on the Cali-
fornian Indians, opposite a description of the Californian way of mak-
ing fire by twirling two sticks.*

Mr. Schoolcraft is not to blame for this state of affairs; in those days
illustrations were not ethnological, they were ‘‘ padding” gotten up by
the artist. Nowhere in his great work does Mr. Schooleratt deseribe
either the Dacota or Iroquois drill. Among the northern Indians in
central and northern Canada, however, the bow is used.

Sir Daniel Wilson, in his work on Prehistoric Man, notes that the
Red Indians of Canada use the drill bow. In August, 1888, at the meet-
ing of the American association, at Toronto, he gave an account of the
facility with which these Indians make fire. He said that at Nipissing,
on the north shore of Lake Superior, while he was traveling in a pour-
ing rain, and not having the means wherewith to light a fire, an Indian
volunteered to light one. He searched around for a pine knot and for
tinder, rubbed up the soft inner bark of the birch between the hands,
got a stick from a sheltered place, made a socket in the knot and another
piece of wood for a rest for the drill, tied a thong to a piece of a branch
fora bow. He put the tinder in the hole and rested his breast on the
drill and revolved it with the bow and quickly made fire.

It is perhaps true that some of the Dacotas did use the bow at times,
but it is not correct to place it as the customary tool of the whole stock.
On the contrary, there is evidence that they used the simple means.
Dr. J. Owen Dorsey writes:

I was told in 1879 by the late Joseph La Fleche, that the Omahas, prior to the ad-
vent of the white men, made fire by using pieces of the ‘‘ du-a-du-4-hi,” a grass (?)
that grows in the Sand Hill region of Nebraska, near the sources of the Elkhorn
River. One piece was placed horizontally on the ground, and aslight notch was cut
at one end, wherein a few grains of sand were put. The other stick was held be-
tween the palms of the hands, with one end in the notch of the horizontal stick, and
then rolled first in one direction then in the other till fire was produced. A fresh
notch was made in the first stick whenever the old one became useless, and so on un-
til it became necessary to procure a new stick.

In the Green Corn Dance of the Minitaries, another Siouan tribe, the
“ corn is boiled on the fire, which is then put out by removing it with
the ashes and burying them. New fire is made by desperate and pain-
ful exertion, by three men seated on the ground facing each other and
violently drilling the end of a stick into a hard block of wood by roll-

* Schooleraft.—Indian Tribes, 1851-60. 111, Pl, 28,
550 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1388.

ing it between the hands, each one catching it in turn from the others
without allowing the motion to stop until smoke, and at last a spark of
fire is seen and caught in a piece of spunk, when there is great rejoicing
in the crowd.”* The desperate exertion was not necessary, except in
imitation of the Zuni fashion of wetting the drill to create sacred fire.

It will be seen from these references given that the Sioux used the
customary Indian method. Later, they may have used the bow to ex-
pedite the drill when the wood was intractable. The bow may have
been borrowed from more northern tribes, the Algonquians are said to
use it;t Mr. Thomas C. Battey says that the Sac-Fox Indians (AI1-.
gonquian stock) used a soft wood drill and a hard wood hearth. ‘‘ The
drill was worked by a bow and the fire caught on the end of the drill
and touched to tinder.”

Throughout South America the art of fire-making with two sticks of
wood is found to be as thoroughiy diffused as it is in North America.
Many of the tribes still use it; we may say that in all tribes the use of
flint and steel was preceded by that of the sticks of wood.

The Guanchos, a mixed tribe of herders on the Pampas of Ven-
ezuela, practice a peculiar way of fire-getting. They select a pliant
rod, place one end against the breast and the other against the block
forming the hearth, held on a line with the breast. By pressing against the
rod it is bent and turned rapidly around like an auger. This imprae-
ticable and no doubt very local method isdescribed by Prof. &. B. Tylor.t

In Brazil, in the Province of Goyaz, the Chavantes, Cayapos, and
Angaytés, use the simple fire drill. -The Angaytés drill figured looks
somewhat like that of the Mokis. It is usually 28°". long for the
hearth, and for the drill 20°". They use the throat skin of the Nandu,
Rhea Americana, for a tinder sack. The Lenguas of the same province
use a Strike a-light consisting of a tinder horn, flint, and steel, which is
also figured in the cited report. This set is very interesting, because
from if we can say with certainty where the Lengua got it. The steel
is the English “ flourish,” and the flint is the oval, old English shape,
probably broken somewhat by blows. The Lenguas, being on the line
of travel, have adopted the method from English traders. In Kio
Janeiro the Indians had an angular recess at the back of their snuff
mills for the purpose of making fire by friction.||

The Ainos of Japan formerly used fire-sticks, and are said even yet
to resort to this method when they have no other means of getting fire.
They use also flint and steel, adopted from the Japanese. A specimen
(No. 22257) is figured and described on page 583 of this paper. The fire-

sticks of the Ainos of Yezo (No. 129970, fig. 17) were loaned to the
Museum by Prof. F. W. Putnam, who also secured the following letter
of Mr. D. P. Penhallow, who collected
the sticks:

At our request the chief brought several fire-
-sticks to my house, together with the neces-
sary number of men to get fire in the approved
style. Upon examination the sticks were found
to be from 6 to 9 inches long, and very dry.
Our informant stated that they were from the
root of the elm Ulmus campestris, var. levis, and
that it was customary to keep a supply ahead,
as the sticks require to be seasoned for about
one year, by hanging them from the rafters of
the house above the fire. To prepare them for
the process of making fire, a shorter stick was
cut flat on opposite sides, and about midway
of one of the flattened sides a small hole was
made with the point of the knife for the pur-
pose of establishing the center of action.
Another stick about 9 inches long was then
well sharpened at one end. Three men now
seated themselves in a circle, facing inward,
with the flattened stick notched side upper-
most in the center.

The point of the long stick was now placed
in the notch, and with the stick in a vertical
position and grasped between the extended
palins of the hands, a steady and somewhat
fast rotating pressure was brought to bear,
exactly as in the use of the old-fashioned awl.
As soon as the first man became weary, the
second brought his hands to bear upon the
upper end of the stick, and continued the mo-
tion without allowing it to cease. This was
repeated as often as necessary until fire was
obtained. Owing to the very dry character of
the sticks used, the parts in contact rapidly

wear away, so that the notch quickly becomes Fig. 17.

The motion is now continued until the smoke is well established, when the verti=

the porous nature of the stick, the spark is drawn into a flame.

The actual operation as witnessed by us consumed about two hours, and the Ainos
state that the process requires from one and one-half to two and one-half hours.

The sticks figured are the actual ones that were used in the operation
above described.
552 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The Japanese formerly used the simple drill; a few are yet preserved
in thetemples. Under the name of * Sacred fire drill” it is described *
as a board 1 foot wide, 1 foot 4 inches long, 1 inch thick, and with a
step 1 inch wide or over on one edge. It has holes and grooves like
the Eskimo hearth. The drill is a stick twirled between the hands.
The parts are of the hi-no-ki, or fire tree, Chameocyparis obtusa. The
drill is called hi-kiri-usu, or fire drilling mortar. It was and perhaps is
yet used for the purpose of drilling fire at the four corners of the temple
inclosure to ward off the calamity of fire. They are said also to have
used the rokuro, or pump-drill. It is interesting to note that the Jap-
anese carpenter’s drill with the iron point is rotated between the palms.
They are still in use. The one figured is in the Tokio Museum.

Prof. Romyn Hitchcock has kindly allowed a drawing to be made of
a photograph which he procured of a sacred fire drill preserved in the
temple called Oyashiro, at Idzumo, Japan (fig. 18). The hearth of

this set is made of hi-no-ki wood and the drill of the Ut-su-gt, Deutzia
scabra.

Professor Hitchcock says:

The fire drill is used at the festivals of the Oyashiro to produce fire for use in cook-
ing the food offered to the gods. Until the temple was examined officially in 1872,
the head priest used it for preparing his private meals at all times. Since then it
has been used only at festivals and in the head priest’s house on the eve of festivals,
when he purifies himself for their celebration in the Imbidous, or room for preparing
holy fire, where he makes the fire and prepares the food.

The art of fire-making by sticks of wood by the method of rotation is,
or has been, as far as we know, universal on the African continent as
it was in the two Americas at the time of the discovery. There is not
a clue as to how the ancient Egyptians generated fire.

The Somalis are a pastoral people of Arab extraction, inhabiting a
large maritime country south of the Gulf of Aden. Their fire-sticks
(fig. 19) are pieces of branches of brownish wood of equal texture, in
fact the hearth has formerly been used as a drill, as may be seen by its
regularly-formed and charred end. This is another proof that it is not
necessary that the sticks should be of different degrees of hardness.
The grain of the wood, that of the drill being against and the hearth

qualities results in. The hearth and drill are in the
neighborhood of 12 inches long, the former with a diam-
eter of three-eighths of an inch and the latter one-fourth
of an inch. They were collected by Dr. Charles Pick-
ering in 1843,

It is possible that the Somalis may have carried this
method with them from Arabia. They conquered this
coast, driving back the earlier tribes inhabiting the coun-
try in the early part of the fifteenth century. Long since
that time, and even now, some Arab tribes practice the
drilling of wooden sticks to produce fire.

In eastern equatorial Africa the Wataveita, says Mr. H.
H. Johnston, generate fire in the common African way
by rapidly drilling a hard-pointed stick into a small hole
in a flat piece of wood. An interesting bit of custom
comes out in connection with this art among the people.
‘‘ It is the exclusive privilege of the men, and the secret
is handed down from father to son, and never under any
conditions (as they say) revealed to women.” I asked

one man why that was. ‘ Oh,” he said, “if women knew
how to make fire they would become our masters.” * The
figure (fig. 20) shows how this people of the great Bantu
stock make fire; this tribe visited by Mr. Johnston lives
on the slopes of the beautiful Kilimanjaro Mountain.

Mr. R. W. Felkin*, in a study of the Maidu or Moru negroes of
Central Africa, 5° north latitude, 30° 20’ east longitude, describes the
fire-making of that tribe. He says that one piece of wood about the
size and shape of a large pencil is rotated in a hole in a flat piece of
hard wood. One man holds the wood steady whilst two others take it
in turn to rotate the stick. This article of Mr. Felkin’s is commended to
ethnologists as a model ethnologic study in method and research.

That veteran and renowned explorer, Dr. Schweinfurth, gives the
following:

The method of obtaining fire, practiced alike by the natives of the Nile lands and
of the adjacent country in the Welle system, consists siinply in rubbing together two
hard sticks at right-angles to one another till a spark is emitted. ‘The hard twigs of
the Anona senegalensis are usually selected for the purpose. Underneath them is placed
either a stone or something upon whicb a little pile of embers has been laid; the
friction of the upper piece of wood wears a hole in the lower, and soon a spark is’
caught by the ashes and is fanned into a flame with dry grass, which is swung to and
fro to cause a draught, the whole proceeding being a marvel which might well-nigh
eclipse the magic of my lucifer matches.t

Kaffir fire-making is described in some detail in the following:

The Kaffir blacksmith never need trouble himself about the means of obtaining a
fire. Should he set up his forge in the vicinity of a Kraai, the simplest plan is to
send his assistant for a fire-brand from one of the huts. But if he should prefer, as
is often the case, to work at some distance from the huts, he can procure fire with
pertect certainty, though not without some labor. He first procures two sticks, one
of them taken from a soft-wood tree and the other from an acacia or some other tree
that furnishes a hard wood. Of course both sticks must be thoroughly dry, a condi-
tion about which there is little difficulty in so hot a climate. His next care is to
shape one end of the hard stick into a point and to bore a small hole in the middle of
the soft stick. He now squats down * * * places the pointed tip of the hard
stick in the hole of the soft stick, and, taking the former between his hands, twirls
it backwards and forwards with extreme rapidity. As he goes on the hole becomes
enlarged and a small quantity of very fine dust falls into it, being rubbed away by
the friction. Presently the dust is seen to darken in color, then to become nearly
black, and presently a very slight smoke is seen to rise. The Kaffir now redoubles
his efforts; he aids the effect of the revolving stick by his breath, and in a few more
seconds the dust bursts into a flame. The exertion required by this operation is very
severe, and by the time the fire manifests itself the producer is bathed in perspiration.

Usually two men at least take part-in fire-emaking, and by dividing the labor
very much shorten the process. It is evident that if the perpendicuiar stick be thus
worked, the hands must gradually slide down until they reach the point. ‘The soli-
tary Kaffir would then be obliged to stop the stick, shift his hands to the top, and
begin again, thus losing much valuable time. But when two Kaffirs unite in fire-
making, one sits opposite the other, and as soon as he sees that his comrade’s hands
have nearly worked themselves down to the bottom of the stick he places his own
hands on the top, continues the movement, and relieves his friend. Thus the move-
ment of the stick is never checked for a moment, and the operation is consequently
hastened. Moreover, considerable assistance is given by the second Kaffir keeping
the dust properly arranged round the point of the stick and by taking the part of the
bellows, so as to allow his comrade to expend all his strength in twirling.{

It is an anomaly that the African, to light the fire to smelt the iron
out of which he forges his remarkable weapons, should use sticks of
wood.

2. ESKIMO FOUR-PART APPARATUS.

The arts of the Eskimo yield more satisfactory results to students of
comparative ethnology than those of any other people.

In all their range the culture is uniform; one finds this fact forced
upon his vbservation who has examined the series of specimens in the
National Museum, where they are arranged in order by localities from
Labrador to southern Alaska. Prof. Otis T. Mason’s paper on Eskimo
throwing-sticks * gave a new interpretation to this fact and powerfully
forwarded the study of ethnology by showing the classificatory value
of the distribution of an art.

Professor Mason points out that though the Eskimo culture is uni-
form in general, in particular the arts show the modification wrought
by surroundings and isolation—tribal individuality, it may be called—
and admit of the arrangement of this people into a number of groups
that have been subjected to these influences.

The Eskimo fire-making tools in the Museum admit of an ethno-
graphic arrangement, but in this paper it is not found necessary to
make a close study of this kind. From every locality whence the Mu-
Seum possesses a complete typical set, it has been figured and deseribed.

The Eskimo are not singular in using a four-part apparatus, but are
singular in the method of using it. The mouth-piece is the peeuliar
feature that is found nowhere else.

The drilling and fire-making set consists of four parts, viz:

Tie mouth-piece,—sometimes a mere block of wood, ivory, or even the
simple concave vertebra of a fish, or the astragalus of a caribou. More
often, they show great skill and care in their workmanship, being carved
with truth to resemble bear, seals, whales, and walrus. The seal is
the most common subject. The upper part is almost always worked
out into a block, forming a grip for the teeth. The extent to which
some of these are chewed attests the power of the Eskimo jaw. Fre-
quently the piece is intended to be held in the hand, or in both hands,
hence it has no teeth grip. In the under part is set a piece of stone, in
which is hollowed out a cup-shaped cavity to hold the head of the drill.
These stones seem to be selected as much for their appearance as for
their anti-friction qualities. They use beautifully-mottled stone, marble,
obsidian, and ringed concretions.

The drill is always a short spindle, thicker than any other drill in
the world. It is frequently of the same kind of wood as the hearth.

The thong is the usual accompaniment of the fire drill. It is raw-
hide of seal or other animals. The handles have a primitive appear-
ance; they are nearly always made of bears’ teeth, hollow bones, or

bits of wood. Sometimes handles are dispensed with. Mr. Warren
K. Moorhead found some perforated teethin an Ohio mound that in every
respect resemble the Eskimo cord handles. They have also been found
in caves in Hurope decorated with concentric circles like those on the
Eskimo specimens.

The bows are among the most striking specimens from this people.
They are pared down with great waste from the tusks of the walrus,
taking the graceful curve of the tusk. The Museum possesses one 244
inches long. It is on their decoration that the Eskimo lavishes his ut-
most art. The bow does not lend itself well to sculpture, as does the
mouth-piece; so he covers the smooth ivory with the most graphie and
truthful engravings of scenes in the active hunting life in the Arctic, or
he tallies on it the pictures of the reindeer, whales, seals, and other ani-
mals that he has killed.

Professor Baird was interested more with these bows than with any
other Eskimo products, and desired to have them figured and studied.

The distribution of the bow is remarkable. It is not found south of
Norton Sound, but extends north and east as far as the Eskimo range.
The Chukchis use it,* but the Ostyaks use the ancient breast drill.j

The bow is used by individuals in boring holes. It is presumed that
its use as a fire-making tool is secondary, the cord and handles being
the older. The difficulty of making fire is greatly increased when one
man attempts to make it with the compound drill; at the critical mo-
ment the dust will fail to ignite; besides, there is no need of one man
making fire; a thing that is for the common good will be shared by
all. Hence the cord with handles, which usually requires that two men
should work at the drill, is as a rule nsed by the Eskimo.

Though the Sioux, and some other North American tribes, made use
of the bow to increase the speed of the drill, they did not use the thong
with handles, nor was the bow common even in tribes of the Siouan
stock that had attained to its use (see remarks p. 549). The bow may be
termed a more advanced invention, allowing one man with ease to bore
holes.

The hearth is made of any suitable wood. It is commonly stepped
and has slots. The central hole with groove is also found. These
hearths are preserved carefully, and fire has been made on some of them
many times.

The distribution of the central-hole hearth (see fig. 21, pl. LXxIv), and
the slot-and-step hearth (see fig. 36), is rather striking. The central holes
are found in the specimens observed from the north coast of Alaska, In-
sular British America, and Greenland, exclusively. Thestepped hearth
with edge holes and slots is by far the more common in western Alaska,
though the other method crops out occasionally ; both ways are some-
times used in the same tribe. More often, the central holes are bored

on a groove (fig. 34), which collects the ground-off particles and facili-
tates ignition. Rarely fire is made by working the drill on a plane sur-
face, in single, non-connecting holes.

The difference between these features is, that it is found to be more
difficult to get fire by a single hole without groove, or slot, than when
the latter features are added. The powder forms a ring around the
edge of the hole, is liable to be dispersed, and does not get together in
sufficient amount to reach the requisite heat for ignition. Of course
this is obviated when a second hole is bored connecting with the first,
when the latter becomes a receptacle for the powder.

It is found that these different ways are due to environmental modi-
fication, showing itself as remarkably in fire-making, as in any other
Eskimo art. Both the stepped and central-hoie hearth are different
devices for the same end. ‘The step on the hearth is to keep the pellet
of glowing powder from falling off into the snow, so universal in Es-
kimo-land; hence, the simple hearth of primitive times and peoples of
warmer Climates has received this addition. The same reason caused
the Eskimo to bore the holes in the middle of the block.

By following the distribution of the center hole method, a clew may
perhaps be gotten to the migrations of the Eskimo.

From Labrador to Norton Sound, by the collections in the Museum,
the center hole is alone used; south of Norton Sound both methods
prevail, with a preponderance of the stepped-hearth species. The step
seems to be an addition to the Indian hearth; the center is an inde-
pendent invention.

The operation of the drill is well told in the oft-quoted description
by Sir. E. Belcher. The writer can attest to the additional statement,
that the teeth of civilized man can scarcely stand the shock. He says:

The thong of the drill bow being passed twice around the drill, the upper end is
steadied by a mouth-piece of wood, having a piece of the same stone imbedded, with
a counter-sunk cavity. This, held firmly between the teeth, directs the tool. Any
workman would be astonished at the performance of this tool on ivory; but having
ounce tried it myself, I found the jar or vibration on the jaws, head, and brain, quite
euough to prevent my repeating it.” *

The ethnographical study of the Eskimo fire-drill begins with Labra-
dor, including Greenland and following the distribution of the people
among the islands and around the North American coast to Kadiak
Island and the Aleutian chain. The following is an interesting account
from Labrador, showing what a man would do in the exigency:

He cut a stout stick from a neighboring larch, and taking out the leather thong
with which his moccasins were tied, made a short bow and strung it. He then
searched for a piece of dry wood, and having found it, cut it into shape, sharpened
both ends, and twisted it once around the bowstring; he then took a bit of fungus
from his pocket and put it into a little hole which he made in another dry piece of
wood with the point of the knife. <A third piece of dry wood was fashioned into a
handle for his diill.t

558 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 18838.

Eskimo in other localities often use such make-shifts. Cup cavities
are often observed in the handles of knives and other bone and ivory
tools where they have used them for heads or the fire-drill.

Cumberland Gulf is the next locality to the northward. There are
several specimens in the collection from this part of Baffin Land, pro-
cured by the famous explorer, Captain Hall, and the less known, but
equally indefatigable Kumlein. The fire-making implements from
Cumberland Gulf have a markedly ditferent appearance from those of
any other locality in the Eskimo area. They have a crude look, and
there is a paucity of ornamention unusual among this people. The
drill bow is one of the things which the Eskimo usually decorates, but
these bows have not even a scratch.

It can be inferred that in Baftin Land, more unfavorable conditions
prevail than in southern Alaska. It must be this cause coupled with
poor food supply, that have couspired to make them the most wretched
of the Eskimo. |

The hearth (fig. 21, pl. LXX1v) is of drift oak. It was collected at Fro-
bisher Bay by Capt. Charles F. Hall. It has central holes, and appears
to be very unfavorable wood for fire-making. The block hearth is also
from Frobisher Bay (fig. 22, pl. LXxtv). It is an old piece of hemlock,
with two central communicating holes. The mouth-piece is a block a
ivory. Another mouth-piece is a bit of hard wood soaked in oil; it was
used with a bone drill having an iron point. A very small, rude bow
goes with this set (fig. 24).

== by the explorations of Holm
aud Garde, who reached a
village on the east coast
never before visited by a

lections were made, both of

In reference to fire-making,
Mr. Holm reporis :

with bone, and the otherend is pressed down into a cavity on the lower piece of wood
(fig. 25). Therefore there must be two persons in order to make a fire. One turns
the drill with the cord, while tho other presses it down on the hearth ; both support
the block with their feet. As soon as the dust begins to burn they fan it with the
hand. When it is ignited, they take it and put it into dried moss (sphagnum), blow
it, and soon get a blaze. In this way they make a fire in an ineredibly short time.”*

In the preliminary report, Mr. Holm gives the time at almost less
than half a minute. It was made by the Eskimo, Illinguaki, and his
wife, who, on being presented with a box of matches, gave up their
drill, saying that they had no farther use for it.

In the same report Mr. Holm gives an interesting note. Hesays:

This fire apparatus is certainly better developed than that which has been de-
seribed and drawn by Nordenskiéld from the Chukehis (Voy. of the Vega, 1, p. 126).
The principle is the same as the Greenlander’s drill, which they employ for making

holes in wood and bone, and which is furnished with a bow and mouth-piece.* (fig.
26.)

The central holes of this hearth are worthy of note, occurring in the
farthest eastern locality of the Eskimo, and in Labrador.

Western Greenland.—The material in the Museum from western
Greenland is very scanty. The southern coast has been settled for so
long a time that the Eskimo and many of their arts have almost be-
come extinct. No view of fire-making in Greenland would be complete
without Davis’s quaint description of it, made three hundred years ago,
but it was the upper end of the spindle that was wet in Trane. A
Greenlander ‘‘begaune to kindle a fire in this manner: He tooke a
piece of a boord wherein was a hole half thorow ; into that hole he puts
the end of a round sticke like unto a bedstaffe, wetting the end thereof
in Trane, and in a fashion of a turner with a piece of lether, by his
violent motion doeth very speedily produce fire.”t

Eskimo graves and village sites vield evidence also thatthe fire-
making tools were not different from those at present used higher north
along the coast, and on the east coast.

sparks produced by grinding two pieces of stone. Also
the widely diffused ‘ fire-drill’ is found here; the spindle
is held between a piece of bone and a fragment of semi-
decayed wood, and is set in motion by the well-known
bow, and is turned until the wood begins to ignite.”*

The “ fire-bag” is an accompaniment to all sorts of fire-
making apparatus. The fire-bag shown (fig. 27, pl.
LXXV) was collected by Captain Hall, at Holsteinberg,
western Greenland in 1860. Itis made of sealskin, and
is a good specimen of the excellent needlework of these
Eskimo. It was used to carry, more especially, the fire-
drill and tinder which require to be kept very dry.

There is a wide gap in the collections of the Museum
between the locality of the specimen just mentioned, and
the fire hearth from the Mackenzie River (fig. 28). This
specimen is from Fort Simpson presum-
ably, where B. R. Ross collected. It is
said to be difficult to discriminate the
Eskimo from the Indian on the lower
Mackenzie. This hearth may be Indian,
as it has that appearance; besides, no
Eskimo hearth yet observed has side
holes and slots like this without the
step. The Indians of this region are of
the great Athapascan stock of the North.
The close resemblance of this stick to
the one from the Washoans of Nevada
has been commented upon. (See fig. 6,
p. 937.)

There is also a very fine old central-
hole hearth from the Mackenzie River,
collected also by Mr. Ross. It isa rough
billet of branch wood, cut apparently
with an axe, or hatchet (fig. 29). It is
semi-decayed and worm-eaten. It has
ten central holes where fire has been
made; they are quite deep, forming a
gutter in the middle of the hearth. There
is, aS can be seen, no need of a groove,
as the dust falls over into the next hole,
collects in a mass, and ignites.

FIRE-MAKING APPARATUS. 561

Tbe Anderson River set is a very complete and interesting outfit. It
was collected many years ago by C. P. Gaudet. The parts are small
for convenience of carrying. It is the custom of those who live in snow-
covered regions to wrap the drill and hearth together very carefully to
keep them dry, as these are the
essential parts of the apparatus.
It does not matter about the
mouth-piece or bow. In this ex-
ample there is a groove cut along
the bottom of the hearth in order
to facilitate tying the drill and
hearth securely together. The
hearth is a square block of soft
wood with three central holes (fig.
30).

The other parts of this set are
also worthy of consideration. The
mouth-piece is set with a square
piece of black stone. The part
held in the mouth is very much
chewed. One of the wings has a
hole for tying, as has the hearth.

This is an usual Eskimo precau-
tion to prevent small objects from
being lost in the snow. The drill
is short, being only 7 inches long,
The bow is the fibula of a deer,
pierced at each end for the frayed
thong of sealskin. It has a primi-
tive look, but it admirably serves
its purpose.

The Point Barrow set was col-
Jected by the most successful ex-
pedition under charge of Lieut. P.
H. Ray, U.S. Army. The knuckle-
bone of a deer serves as a mouth-
piece, the cup cavity and its gen-
eral shape fitting it for the pur-

The drill is regularly made of (©: No. 1827 U.S. N.M. Eskimo of Anderson River, B. C

light pine wood; it is slightly
smaller in the middle. The hearth is a rudely rounded piece of pine.
A fragment has been split off, and on this surface a groove has
been cut and three fire-holes bored along it. The thong is without
handles; it is used to tie the parts together when they are not in

use. A bunch of willow twigs, the down of which is used as tinder,
is also shown (fig. 31).
This set is especially interesting, because it shows the degeneration
: of anart. The fire-drill is so rarely
used at Point Barrow, Mr. John
Murdoch says, that it was not pos-
sible to get a full set devoted to
that purpose. Those here shown
area make-shift. The method only
survives by the conservatism of a
few old men of the tribe, who still
cling to old usages. One of these
made the drill for Lieutenant Ray,
telling him that it was the kind
used in old times. It seems primi-
tive enough; the knuckle-bone
might well have been the first
mouth-piece. The Eskimo farther
east sometimes use a fish vertebra
for the same purpose; one from the
Anderson River has this. The cord
without handles is undoubtedly the
earliest form also.

The small wooden and bone
mouth-pieces of the Eskimo east
of Point Barrow to Cumberland
Gulf seem to be copies of the deer
knuckle-bone. Another primitive
adaptation is found in an Anderson
River bow, which is made of the
fibula of a deer (see fig. 30).

The fire-making dill collected
from the Chukchis by the Vega ex-
pedition in the Cape Wankerem re-
gion, in northeastern Siberia, about
the same latitude as Point Bar-
row, is figured in Nordenskiéld’s
Report.* It is worked by a bow,
and the drill turns in a mouth-
piece of a deer astragalus like the
Point Barrow specimen. The block
has central holes, with short
grooves running into each one.

tailed. He records that the “women appear to be more accustomed
than the men to the use of this implement.”

He gives also a most interesting observation on the use of a weighted
pump drill among the Chukechis. The Chukchis also use flint and
steel.*

The drilling set from Point Barrow (pl. LxxvI, fig. 32), will show
the appearance of the parts of the fire-drill if we substitute the round
stick for the flint drill. Some of the old drill stocks are pointed with
finely chipped flint heads. The length of these points varies from 2 to 4
inches; the transverse section of one would be a parabola. They are
in general more finely wrought than any of the prehistoric drills found
in various localities all over the world. Prehistoric man was an adept
in the art of drilling stone, bone, and shell; the stone tubes, some of
them 18 inches long, bored very truly, are triumphs of the American
Indians. Without doubt the prehistoric drill points were mounted like
the Eskimo specimen, and were, perhaps, twirled between the-hands,
the almost universal method of using the fire-drill. Japanese carpen-
ters drill holes in this way.

The winged mouth-piece is also a good example of workmanship. It
is set with a mottled, homogeneous stone that is tolerably soft, which
gives a minimum friction. This stone is much affected by the tribes
over quite an extent of coast for labrets, etc. It is probably an article
ot trade asare flints. The bow is of walrus tusk, accurately made, but
poorly engraved in comparison with the life-like art work of the south-
ern Eskimo.

Another drilling set is from Sledge Island (pl. LXxvIl, fig. 33). The
Museum has no fire-making specimen from this locality. The drill
stock is set with a point of jadeite lashed in with sinew cord. The bow
is of walrus ivory; it is rounded on the belly and flat on the back.
All Eskimo bows of ivory have a like curve, no doubt determined by
the shape of the walrus tusk. In another, the most common form of
the bow, its section is nearly an isosceles triangle, one angle coming in
the center of the belly of the bow. The head is intended to be held in
one or both hands; it agrees in form with the rude St. Lawrence
Island heads.

Mr. Ei. W. Nelson collected at Unalakleet, in Norton Sound, a fire-
drill, and the native names of the parts. The name of the set is
the hearth of tinder- wood, athl-uk; the bow, arshu-low-shuk-pish-ik-
sin-uk.

This is a complete set (fig. 34) in first-rate order. The hearth has
central holes along a deep median groove. Its bottom is flat, and it is
rounded off on the sides and ends. All the parts are of pine wood,
decorated in places with red paint. The drillis quite long, much longer
than in any Eskimo set observed. It resembles more the Indian drill

for rubbing between the hands. The bow is of
wood, which also is quite the exception in other
Eskimo regions, where it is of ivory. There are
many bows of antler from Norton Sound in the
Museum, some of them skillfully and truthfally
engraved, The mouth-piece is plain; not very
well made. It is set with a square block of
marble. It has the usual hole in one of the
wings for the passage

of a thong.

Cape Vancouver is represented by a fine old hearth. This object
has evidently been prized by its owner; it has had two rows of fire-
holes (fig. 35), one row bored on the step in front of the first holes made ;
some of the holes are bored clear through. The reason why this was
valued is, because the wood is so tindery that it is easy to make fire
upon it.

Chalitmute, in the Kuskokwim region, on the northern side of the
bay of that name, opposite Nunivak Island, is the next locality south-
ward, to be considered. The parts of this set are exceptionally well-
finished. The hearth is (pl. LXXvu1, fig. 36) stepped. It has four holes
prepared for use; on one, fire has been made. The drill is unusually
thick. The mouth-piece has no teeth-grip, and there is no evidence
that it was ever held in the mouth. It is intended to be held in the
hand. This mouth-piece is set with an oval socket-stone of black
obsidian, ground down into facets and polished. The cord handles
are fine, large teeth of the sea lion. The centers of the circies so char-
acteristic of Eskimo art, are inlaid with wood. The holes for the
drill cord are narrow ; they must have been dug through with a sharp,
narrow instrument. As before remarked, this is the region where the
hand rest is more used than the mouth-piece, and the bow is not used
at all.

The fire-making set from the Togiak River, was collected in 1886, by
Seret. I. Applegate, of the U. S. Signal Corps. Kassianamnte, from
which village it comes, is in the Bristol Bay region, but this set has a
different appearance from the former outfits (pl. LXxIx., fig. 37). The
hearth is a block of wood worked out at one end into a handle. It is
remarkable in having central holes not connecting, and with no con-
necting grooves. In this it closely resembles the block from East
Greenland (fig. 25). This hearth is of soft, tindery wood, and doubtless
when the holes became too deep to allow the powder to mass around the
edge, the upper part of hearth was scarped down, The mouth-piece is
large, and is in the form of a seal. It has only a shallow, crescentic
teeth-grip ; from the size of the mouth-piece, its shape, and the absence
of a block to fasten between the teeth, it must have been nearly always
held in the hand of one of the operators. It is set with a round pebble,
mottled with green. The cord is a thong of rawhide with handles of
wood.

The next locality is Koggiung, on the southern shore of Bristol Bay,
near its head. Two sets are shown from this locality. From the
hearths it will*be seen that both fire-slots on the side and center holes
are used here. These sets are called ni-tshiin (fig. 38). The apparatus
shown in figure 38 has the stepped hearth. Both drill and hearth appar-
ently have been made for sale. The mouth-piece is a good one, set with a
large socket-piece of a black stone with green mottlings. This stone
is tolerably soft. It is much used by the Bristol Bay Eskimo for
making labrets, ete. The teeth-grip is very shallow. The hearth
566 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

(fig. 39) is of avery peculiar shape; only one other has been noticed like
it. The wood is of the best kind, and fire has been made on it a num-
ber of times. In several places the holes have been bored clear through.

The mouth-piece bears no evidence that it has been held between the
teeth. It is highly probable that fire was made on these outfits more
often by two persons, one holding the mouth-piece, or rest, and fanning

the flame, the other pulling the cord. This must be the method in
Bristol Bay. Neither the true mouth-piece nor any bow has been pro-
cured by the Museum from this interesting region, from whence there
are copious collections of ethnological objects. The cords without han-
dles are worthy of notice.

Another set from Bristol Bay is said by its collector, Charles McKay,
to be used by both Eskimo and Indians. It is a very valuable outfit
because of its completeness (pl. Lxxx, fig. 40). The hearth is a rounded
piece of wood with four large holes opening by slots onto the step. The

drill is a thick, tolerably hard piece of close-
grained wood like the hearth. The mouth-
piece has no regular block for the teeth-grip,
but has a crescentic gash on each side in-

stead. Itis set with a socket of a rock resem-

bling marble. Nearly all the mouth-pieces
south of Norton Sound are in the shape of
seals, or other long animals. Cord handles
are used attached to a thick thong of buck-
skin. Fungus is used for tinder and a blaze
is started with cones of the larch. These are
kept in the box, the lid of which is tied on
with a thong.

Kadiak, the lowest limit of the western Es-
kimo, is as far south as the four part fire-drill
extends by specimens in the Museum (tig. 41).
The hearth is of cedar wood with three cen-
tral holes with a connecting groove. It is
neatly finished. The drill is also of cedar and
bears the marks of the use of the thong; the
top has also been used in the socket of a rest.
The drill approaches in length those used
for twirling between the hands by the In-
dians.

While the Aleutians use flint and steel, or
a stone containing quartz aud pyrites, struck
against another stone, they still make use of
the four-part drill at certain times. Hunting
parties, says Mr. L. M. Turner, carry the drill
to use when their matches run out. It takes
two men to work it, one holding the kand rest
and the other pulling the thong. The spindle
ismade of harder wood, so as to wear the light
dust which ignites, from the hearth. A mo-
ment only is necessary to get fire; this is fed
with tinder made of willow catkins and pow-
dered charcoal. Sometimes, in order to get
fire, they hold tinder at the mouth of a gun
and ignite it by firing off a light charge of
loose powder.

Possessed of four methods of getting fire,
the Aleutian is superior to more fortunately
situated people who depend wholly on
matches.

il.—FIRE-MAKING BY SAWING.

Prof. Alfred Russel Wallace has noted the method by sawing in his
work entitled ‘‘The Malay Archipelago,” p. 332: Two pieces of bamboo
are used; a Sharp edge piece like a knife is rubbed across a convex piece
in which a notch is cut, nearly severing the bamboo (fig. 42); after sawing
across for awhile the bamboo is pierced, and the
heated particles fall below and ignite. The Ternate
Malaysand the Tungaras of British North Borneo*
have improved upon this by striking a piece of china
with tinder held with it against the outside of a
piece of bamboo, the siliceous coating of the latter
yielding a spark like flint. Both of the methods
mentioned are in use at different points in the area
affected by Maiay influence.

The Chittagong hill tribes, on the eastern frontier
of British India, use sand on the sawing knife to
increase the friction.t

The Karens of Burma, Dr. Kh. M. Luther informs
the writer, hollow out a branch of the Dipterocarpus
tree like the lower piece of bamboo spoken of, cuta
transverse notch, and saw across in it with a rubber
of iron-wood. The wood fibers ground off form the
tinder; the coal is wrapped up in a dry leaf and
swung around the head till it blazes. It takes only
two or three minutes to get a blaze this way.

Bearing upon the origin of this method of sawing
in these localities, nature is alleged to suggest the
way and to repeat the process that would give to
fireless man the hint. Mr. W.'T. Hornaday relates
that many fires are started in the jungle vy bamboo
rubbing together in a high wind-storm. The creak-
ingis indescribable; the noise of the rasping and
grinding of the horny stems is almost unendurable.

In many tribes it is found that often there is more
than one method of fire-making practiced. - For in-

520 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Soin Australia, while the rotary drill is the usual way, some tribes
have acquired the art of producing fire with knife or rubber, that is,
the sawing method presumably under foreign influence.*

III.—FIRE-MAKING BY PLOWING.

One of the most marked of fire-:making methods in its distribution is
that pursued by the Pacific Islanders, confined almost entirely to the
Polynesian cultural area. It has spread to other
islands, however, being met with among the Negritos
of New Britain:

They rub a sharpened piece of hard stick against the inside
of a piece of dried split bamboo. This has a natural dust that
soon ignites. ‘They use soft wood when no bamboo can be pro-
cured, but it takes longer to ignite. The flame is fed with
grass.t

There is a close connection between the Malay saw-
ing method and this, as there is a decided Malay pre-
ponderance in the make-up of the population of the
Islands.

The fire-sticks shown (fig. 43) were procured by Mr.
Harold M. Sewall, at Samoa, and deposited in the
museum by him.

The wood is a light corky variety, probably of the
Hibiscus tiliacus, which is used for this’ purpose at
Tahiti, or perhaps it is of the paper mulberry. The
rubber may be of some hard wood, although fire may
be made by means of arubber of the same kind of wood
as that of the hearth, though no doubt it requires a
longer time to make fire if thisis done. In the Sand-
wich [slands, Mr. Franklin Hale Austin, secretary of
the King, states that the rubber is of koh or ohia,
that is, hard wood and the hearth of hon, or soft wood,
and the friction is always in soft woods; this is true,
I believe, everywhere this method is practiced, in

(Gat. No. 130675, U s.N. a Lieut. William I. Moore, U.S. Navy, gave the writer
eee a complete description of the manipulation of the Sa-
moan fire getting apparatus.

The blunt pointed stick is taken between the clasped hands, somewhat
as one takes a pen, and projected forward from the body along the groove
at the greatest frictional angle consistent with the forward motion which
has been found to be from 40 to 45 degrees. Kneeling on the stick the
man forces the rubber forward, slowly at first, with a range of perhaps

6 inches, tillthe wood begins to be ground off und made to go into a little
heap at the end of the groove; then he gradually accelerates the speed
and moves with a shorter range until, when he pushes the stick with
great velocity, the brown dust ignites. This is allowed to glow and if
it is required to be transferred to dry leaves or chips of wood it is done
by means of a tinder made of frayed or worn tapa cloth.

The groove (fig. 43a) is the most characteristic feature of this appara-
tus, there being apparently no definite form of implements for this pur-
pose. Fire is made on any billet of dry wood that is available. It is
not necessary to cut a slot, or even a groove, the hard wood rubber will
form one, so that there is no more need of apparatus than among the
Navajos, where two bits of yucca stalk collected near by form the fire
tools.

That making fire by this way is difficult to those inexperienced in it
is not strange. Mr. Darwin found it quite so, but at last sueceeded.
The Samoan gets fire in forty seconds, and so great is the friction and
the wood so well adapted that Mr. Austin, before quoted, says it some-
times actually bursts into flame.

The Australians in some parts use a method very much like the one
described. They rub a knife of wood along a groove made in another
stick previously filled with tinder.*

IV.—PERCUSSION.

1. FLINT AND PYRITES.

Ac primum silici scintillam excudit Achates
Suscepitque ignum foliis atque arida circum
Nutrimenta dedit, rapuitque in fomite flammam.
(Aneid B. 1, 174-176.)

One of the oldest methods of fire-making that we know of is, that by
the percussion of flint and pyrites. It is believed to have been the
original discovery. If there is any difference in the difficulties of con-
ception and execution in either of the inventions, it lies in favor of the
sticks of wood.

The distribution of the flint and pyrites method, both in time and
place, is very interesting. Mr. Evans, in his epoch-making work,
“Ancient Stone Implements,” page 14, remarks that the name of pyrites
(xup, fire) is itself sufficient evidence of the purpose to which the mineral
was applied in ancient times. Whatever the fact is in Roman history,
the Eskimo ealls pyrites firestone, some Indian tribes call flint fire-
stone, the German name for flint is fewerstein, and it is a reasonable
supposition that whatever people used flint or quartz, pyrites, or other
forms of iron ore for making fire, would call the stone firestone. The
statement of Pliny that fire was first struck out of flint by Pyrodé, the
son of Cilix, Mr. Evans thinks, is a myth which points to the use of
silex and pyrites, rather than to steel.

*R Brough Smith.—The Aborigines of Victoria. London, 1878. 1, p. 304.
572 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Mr. Thomas Wilson calls my attention to a discovery of a pyrités
nodule by M. Gaillard, in a flint workshop on the island of Guiberon
in Brittany. The piece bore traces of use. Mr. Wilson thinks that
the curved flakes of flint like the one figured, found so numerously,
were used with pyrites as strike-a-lights. The comparative rarity of
pyrites is, perhaps, because it is easily decomposed and disintegrates
in unfavorable situations in a short time, so that the absence of pyrites
does not militate against the theory that it was used. <A subeylindrical
nodule of pyrites 24 inches long and bruised at one end was found in
the cave of Les Eyzies, in the valley of Vézéere, Perigord, mentioned
in Reliquae Aquitanice, page 248. This is supposed to have been a
strike-a-light.

Prof. W. B. Dawkins thinks that—

In all probability the Cave-man obtained fire by the friction of one piece of hard
wood upon another, as is now the custom among many savage tribes. Sometimes,
however, as in the Trou de Chaleux, quoted by M. Dupont (Le Temps Prehistorique
en Belgique, second edition, page 153), he may have obtained a light by the friction ofa
bit of flint against a piece of iron pyrites, as is usnal with the Eskimos of the present
day.*

Mr. Dawkins also says that fire was obtained in the Bronze Age by _
striking a flint flake against a piece of pyrites, sometimes found together
in the tumuli. He figures a strike-a-light from Seven Barrows, Lam-
bourne, Berks, England, an outline of which is reproduced here for com-
parison with the one from Fort Simpson, British Columbiv (fig. 44a
and b). Pyrites has been found in a kitchen-midden at Ventnor, in
connection with Roman pottery t+ Chambers’s Eneyclop:edia, article,
Pyrites,t is authority for the statement that pyrites was used in kind-
ling powder in the pans of muskets before the gun flint was introduced.

It is thus seen that this art has a high antiquity, and that on its
ancient areas its use comes down nearly to the present day, the flint
and steel being its modern or allied form.

In North America this art is distributed among the more northerly
ranging Indian tribes, and the Eskimo of some parts. Its use was and
is yet quite prevalent among the Indians of the Athapascan (formerly
Tinné) stock of the north. By specimens in the Museum, and notes of
explorers, it is found to range from north of Dixon’s Sound to Labrador,
the following localities being represented, viz: Stikime River, Sitka,
Aleutian Islands, Kotzebue Sound, Point Barrow, the Mackeuzie River
district, at Fort Simpson, and probably Hershel Island, Pelly Bay, Mel-
ville Peninsula, Smith Sound, and Labrador. The Canadian and Algon-
quins strike two pieces of pyrites (pierres de mine) together over an
eagle’s thigh, dried with its down, and serving instead of tinder.|| From

other sources we know that the extinct Beothucs, of Newfoundland,
did the same.*

As far as can be ascertained, the Eskimo and Indians both use the
method, so that it is not characteristic of either, as the four-part drill
is of the Eskimo, as contrasted with the simple rotation sticks of the
Indians. A description of a flint and pyrites outfit, as at present used,
will give a general idea of the status of the invention. In different
localities the manipulation differs somewhat, as will be noted farther on.

he assigned the specimen to this
locality on the evidence. Mr.
John Murdoch has, with a great
deal of probability, questioned
this and thinks that it came
from Herschel Island with the
rest of Mr. Herendeen’s collec-
tion and did not come from as
far east as Cape Bathurst.
While there is no improbability
that this method is practiced at
Cape Bathurst, yet the specimen
has the appearance of the Mac-
kenzie River strike-a- lights,
hence it is deemed advisable to
locate it in the Mackenzie River
district at Herschel Island.
The essential parts of the ap-
paratus are a piece of pyrites, a
piece of flintand tinder. In the
more northern parts of the
Eskimo area, tinder is made

from the down from the stems and catkins of various species of dwarf

arctic willows. At present the
natives often soak the tinder in
a strong solution of gunpowder
and water to make it quick; an
older way was to mix powdered
charcoal with it. This plan is
like the charring of the linen rags
used in the old-fashioned tinder
boxes of forty years ago. The
Eskimo then puts the tinder into
a little round, flat pouch, with a
flap in the middle (fig. 45, 1).
The pyrites (fig. 46, 3) looks like
a short pestle, too much of which
appearance the repeated scraping
has no doubt given rise. The up-
per end is concave, while the lower
end has the original smooth sur-
face of the concretion. Pyrite is
found at Point Barrow in spher-
ical masses of various sizes up to
several pounds in weight. These
spheres are nearly always cracked
in two and scraped on the plane

surface for very obvious reasons. This gives the shape seen in Fort
Simpson and Long Barrows specimen. Mr. Murdoch says that the Ks-
kimo think that pyrites comes down from above in meteors. They eall
it ‘“‘firestone.” A native related that in old times they did not use
flint, but two pieces of pyrites, and got “big fire.”

The flint (fig. 46, 4) is an oblong piece of chert, square at the base
and rounded at the forward end. It is more elaborately made than the
flakes so numerous in Europe, one of which was found with the piece
of pyrites in the English Barrows. The Mackenzie River scraper is
more like the curved ancient one (fig. 44)). In most cases the flints
used are not mounted in a handle; this specimen, however, is fixed ina
handle made of two pieces of wood held together by a thong of seal-
skin (fig. 46, 4a).

The bag (fig. 45, 2) is made of reindeer skin. The little bag that
hangs from the larger has a double use; it is a receptacle for reserve
tinder, but its chief use is for a toggle; being passed under the belt it
prevents the loss of the outfit, which is said to be carried by the
women.

An oblong pad, stuffed with deer hair, is sewed to the mouth of the
fire-bag to protect the hand from sparks and blows of the flint.

To get aspark, the Eskimo places (fig. 47) the piece of pyrites on the
pad held in the left hand over the curved ‘
forefinger, the large end down and the
thumb set in the cup shaped cavity in
the top. The flap of the tinder pocket
is turned back and held on the forefinger
under the protecting pad. The flint is
held in the right hand and by a scrap-
ing motion little pieces of pyrites at a
dull red heat fall down into the tinder.
The pellet that glows is transferred to
the pipe or fire, and the flap of the tinder
pocket is turned down, serving to keep
the tinder dry and to extinguish it if
necessary.*

on Greenland, Cranz and Egede, though they carefully note and de-
scribe the plan by wood-boring. Later explorers going higher north in
western Greenland have found it. Dr. Emil Bessels, writing about the
Itah Eskimo of Smith Sound, says:

The catkins of the arctic willow are used as tinder to catch the sparks which have
been produced through the grinding of two pieces of stone.*

Dr. E. K. Kane gives a more complete account from nearly the same
locality, the Arctic Highlands of northwest Greenland. He says that
the Eskimo of Anoatok struck fire from two stones, one a plain piece
of angular milky quartz, held in the right hand, the other apparently
an oxide of iron [pyrites or iron ore?| They were struck together after
the true tinder-box fashion, throwing a scanty supply of sparks ona
tinder composed of the silky down of the willow catkins (Salix lanata)
which he held on a lump of dried moss.t

Very much farther west on Melville Peninsula Parry gives a com-
plete and interesting description of the primitive way. This account
gives us a link between the western and eastern Eskimo. He writes:

For the purpose of obtaining fire, the Eskimo use two lumps of common pyrites,
from which sparks are struck into a little leathern case (see fig. 25, pl. LXXIV) contain-
ing moss well dried and rubbed between the hands. If this tinder does not readily
catch, a small quantity of the white floss of the seed of the ground willow is laid
above the moss. As soon as aspark has caught it is gently blown till the fire has
spread an inch around, when the pointed end of a piece of wick being applied, it
soon bursts into a flame, the whole process having occupied perhaps two or three
minutes. $

The Museum was in possession of a specimen catalogued, ‘‘Moss-
bag and lumps of pyrites used by Innuit for getting fire,” collected by

*Capt. C. F. Hall at Pelly Bay, in latitude 69°, longitude 90°, several
degrees west of Melville Peninsula.

The only other record of the process under consideration among the
Eskimo is found in the Aleutian Islands. There is absolutely no evi-
dence had by the writer that the Eskimo south of Kotzebue Sound
(Western Eskimo) use the pyrites and flint for making fire. The latest
information about the Aleutian Islanders is given in a manuscript
of the careful explorer, Mr. Lucien M. Turner. His observation will
serve to explain the description of striking a light by earlier travelers.

They use the four part drill but they also use pyrites. A stone containing quartz
and pyrites is struck against another similar one, or a beach pebble, into a mass of
sea bird down sprinkled with powdered sulphur. This ignites and is quickly caught
on finely shredded blades of grass or beaten stalks of wild parsnips. This method
prevails to this day on the islands west of Unalashka.

The people told Mr. Turner that this was the ancient way. There is
a doubt in the writer’s mind that Sauer’s (Billing’s Expedition, page
59), and Campbell’s (Voyage, page 59,) observations, brought together
by Bancroft,§ were accurate with regard to the stones used. All the

other details are correct, but they say they took two pieces of quartz,
rubbed them with sulphur, and struck them together. It is well known
that pieces of quartz even when rubbed witb sulphur will not strike
a spark of sufficient heat to cause ignition. The pieces used must
have been pyritiferous quartz as noticed by Mr. L. M. Turner.

To resume, the following facts arise out of the foregoing considera-
- tions of the flint and pyrites method:

(1) It is very ancient, inferring from the few reliable finds of pyrites
and flint in juxtaposition.

(2) Its distribution is among high northern tribes, both Eskimo and
Indian.

(3) As far as known, its range is limited to this area, only one other
instance coming to our notice, that of the Fuegians.

2. FLINT AND STEEL.

The flint and pyrites method is the ancestor of the flint and steel.
The latter method came in with the Iron Age. It is found in the early
settlements of that period. <A steel for striking fire was found in the
pile dwellings of the Ueberlinger See.* The Archeological Department
of the Museum has a specimen of a strike-a-light of the early age of
iron in Scandinavia. It is a flat, oval quartz stone with a groove
around the edge; it is thought to be for holding a strap by which it
could be held up and struck along the flat surface with the steel. It is
scored on these surfaces. The specimen in the Smithsonian is from
the national museum atStockholm. In Egyptit is believed to have been
used for a long period, though there is no data at hand to support the
conelusion.t In China it has been in use for many centuries. Chinese
history, however, goes back to the use of sticks of wood. The briquet
must have been carried nearly everywhere by early commerce from the
ancient countries around the Mediterranean, as it was into new lands
by later commerce.

Many persons remember the tinder-box that was taken from its
warm nook beside the fire-place whenever a light was wanted; the
matches tipped with sulphur used to start a blaze from the glowing tin-
der are also familiar to the older generation. The tinder-boxes in use
in this country were just like those in England from time immemorial
down to fifty years ago (fig. 48). Mr. Edward Lovett, of Croydon,
England, who has studied this matter thoroughly, calls attention to the
resemblance of the old English tinder-flints to the neolithic scrapers.
These scrapers, picked up at Brandon, can scarcely be discriminated
from those made at the present time at that place, and there is a sus-
picion that the present tinder-flint has come down directly from neo-

lithic times. The old English steel, or ‘ Flourish,” (fig. 48) is the char-
acteristic shape, and has been carried by English commerce into many
places. A picture of a strike-a-light used by the Lenguas of Brazil,
seen lately, shows the unmistakable old ‘“ flourish.”

The tinder-boxes had alsoa damper to extinguish the tinder of burnt
linen and to keep it dry. The lids were furnished often with a candle
socket. This feature, says Mr. Lovett, has led to their preservation as

candle-sticks long after they were superseded by matches.

Many devices were invented in order to improve on the crude way of
holding the flint and steel in the hands to strike the spark into the
tinder-box. One of these was the wheel tinder-box (fig. 49). The com-

socket on the sliding lid, and the wheel was turned by unwinding a

flint was pressed against the rapidly revolving wheel and a shower of
sparks fell into the tinder. The tinder pistol, whose name suggests its
use, was another device.*

Other devices were intended to be carried in the pocket, and were
probably brought out by the introduction of tobacco and the need of
smokers for a convenient light.

The pocket strike-a-light is still used. The one shown (fig. 50) was
bought in 1888 by Mr. E. Lovett, at Boulogne-sur-mer. They are still

used by the peasants and work-people of France. An old specimen
in the Museum of this character is from Lima. The roll of tinder, or
‘““match,” is made of the soft inner bark of a tree.

Among many of our North American tribes the flint and steel super-
seded the wooden drills as effectually as did the iron points the stone
arrow- heads.

Some of these tribes were ripe for the introduction of many modern
contrivances. Civilized methods of fire-lighting appealed to them at
once. Among the Chukchis, Nordenskiéld says, matches had the honor
of being the first of the inventions of the civilized races that have been
recognized as superior to their own.t It was so among our Indian
tribes ; the Mandan chief “ Four Bears” lighted his pipe by means of a
flint and steel taken from his pouch when George Catlin visited him
_in 1832.4

The Otoes (Siouan stock) made use of the flint and steel shown in
fig. 51. The flint is a chipped piece of gray chert, probably an ancient
implement picked up from the surface.

The steel isa very neatly made oval, resembling those of the Albanian
strike-a-lights,§ or the Koordish pattern, ( fig. 54). Here arises one of
the perplexities of modern intercourse, perhaps both of these steels
were derived from the same commercial center.

The pouch of the Cheyennes(Algonquian stock) is compact, and neatly
made of leather (fig. 52). The equipment is complete and of a supe-
rior order. The bone cup is used to hold the tinder while striking a
sparkintoit. Itis the tinder horn of early days, a cow’s horn which was
used to hold tinder before sheet-iron boxes came into use. The Lenguas
of Brazil use a horn for the same purpose.* In the Aino set, (fig. 57),
and the Eskimo strike-a-light, (fig. 45), can be seen this feature. The
tinder with this set is rotten wood. Nearly all Indians know the value
of fungus tinder.

The Comanche Indian strike-a-light is a similar pouch to the one de-
scribed, but much poorer in equipment (fig. 53.) A broken rasp, a piece
of chert, and a piece of spunk, is enough for the purpose, and a bag made
from a saddle skirt to hold them, completes the outfit.

The flint and steel is still used nearly all over Mexico, Dr. Palmer
informs me. There is at present a manufacture of gun and strike-a-
light flints at Brandon, England, whence they are shipped to Spain,

The Ainos of Japan use flint and steel for striking-a-light, this method
having supplanted the generation of fire by sticks (p. 551.) This out-
fit shown (fig. 57, pl. LXxx1) is complete. The shoe-shaped steel is at-
tached by a piece of sinew to the cork of a small wooden bottle con-
taining the soft charcoal used as tinder. The flint is a small piece’
of ferruginous silex. With this set is a piece of stick which retains
fire for a long time. It is the root
of the Ulmus campestris, or levis,
formerly used for the fire-drill (see
fig. 17), but has come into a sec-
ondary place since the introduc-
tion of the flint and steel.

twined weaving. A much ruder pouch of fishskin is in the Museum.

The Japanese tinder-box has two compartments, one with a damper
for the tinder, and the other larger one for the flint and steel. This box
is a familiar objectin Japanese kitchens yet. The mounting of the steel
in wood is an improvement on holding it between the fingers (fig. 58 and
59). No one it seems ever thought of so mounting the steel in Western
countries. The matches are broad shavings tipped at both ends with
sulphur, and are the Japanese rendering of the “‘spunks” used with our
tinder-box.

THE COLLECTION OF KOREAN MORTUARY POTTERY IN
THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

By PrieRRE LOuIS Jovy.

On arriving in Fusan, in the winter of 1883, my attention was early
attracted to the subject of Korean pottery, and several pieces of a ware
entirely different from the ordinary pottery of the country were brought
to me for examination by Japanese residents. These pieces, to which a
remote antiquity was ascribed, were held in high esteem by Japanese
connoisseurs who delight in rare and curious objects. An extraordinary
value was given to fine specimens and they were often sent to friends
in Japan, and especially to Osaka, which port has long enjoyed direct
communication with Korea.

The discoveries of Professor Morse in Japan* and the researches of
Japanese archeologists in bringing to light the ancient stone imple-
ments and numerous other prehistoric objects, including pottery, had
inspired me with the desire to form similar collections in Korea. This
seemed all the more encouraging as the country was not only practically
a virgin field of research, but abounded in monuments of great antiquity
and evidences of long occupation of the soil. Korea is one vast grave-
yard. Burial mounds and monuments of varying age and rich in arche-
ological interest are a prominent feature of the landscape. Althougha
tolerably thickly populated country there are many sections where the
cemeteries occupy at least a quarter as much space as that used for
agricultural purposes. From the capital to the southeastern, coast, a
distance of about 200 miles, they are scarcely ever out of sight of the
traveler, their prominent position on the hillsides making them very
conspicuous. Isolated graves of greater distinction are of frequent oc-
currence and are tended from generation to generation with great care.
The grass is kept well cropped to avoid danger from fire, and a grove
of evergreen trees surrounds the grave. These groves, frequently the
only trees on a hillside, are arranged in the shape of @ horseshoe, the
mound, from four to five feet high, being in the center, and the open
space on the lower side.

Some mounds are further protected by a wall on three sides still fol-
lowing the shape of a horseshoe, and the open side is guarded by nearly
life-sized effigies in stone arranged in pairs on each side of a slab of
granite on which is carved an inscription.

Most graves, however, have simply an upright slab of granite, rect-
angular in shape, bearing an inscription, and supported by a low ped-
estal.

(Places underscored show where mortuary pottery has been found.)

Owing to the recent opening of the country and the utter impossibility
for a foreigner to evade the curious eyes of the natives for any length of
time, it was well-nigh impossible to accomplish any original investiga-
tions. I therefore considered myself fortunate in securing the services
of a young native who trom time to time brought me many specimens
of pottery and other objects which he described as having taken from
the earth buried in the ancient graves near the cities of Taiku, Uru-
san, and Torai. Among other objects, besides pottery, were rings of
copper heavily gilded, parts of bronze horse-trappings, such as buckles
and other ornaments, and objects of stone ; the most interesting of these
objects were arrowheads of slate, and daggers of slate or shale with the
handle and blade in one piece. These latter are considerably weathered,
showing signs of great age, but were described as having been taken
from stone coffers in the graves, which would account for their almost
perfect state of preservation.
KOREAN MORTUARY POTTERY. 591

The pottery in common use in Korea at the present time consists of
three kinds; the finest of white, pale buff, or bluish, porcelain sometimes
decorated in blue and with a high glaze, is used for the table, and con-
sists of dishes, bowls, and bottles, also wash basins; the second quality
is a pale yellow ware, glazed, mostly made into bowls, undecorated, and
used by the poorer classes. Itis very similar to the common kitchen
ware in use all over the world in civilized as well as barbarous kitchens.
The third style of pottery is of the commonest kind, made of dark
brown, or reddish earth, is glazed inside and out, and has little or no
decoration except a wavy line produced by wiping off the glaze, leav-
ing the lighter under surface to show through. Some pieces have their
edges scalloped or fluted and are adorned with incised lines, but gener-
ally they are quite plain and without these ornamentations. This ware,
of which a specimen is shown in this collection (an oil-bottle, No. 94519),
is used mainly for oil and water jars and for the common bowls and
dishes of the Korean kitchen. House tiles are also made of this clay.

The most ambitious specimens of this latter ware I have seen are the
water jars, huge vessels suggesting possibilities of concealment as great
as the famous jarsin the Arabian tale* ; these are often greater in capac-
ity than an ordinary barrel. There are generally at least two of these
huge receptacles placed just outside of the kitchen door. Another cu-
rious form is a kind of oven consisting of ashallow vessel with a cover
and raised some 8 or 10 inches from the ground on three legs, the whole
being made of pottery.

The specimens of ancient Korean pottery, enumerated in the follow-
ing list, which I have called mortuary pottery, are unglazed (a few
pieces show apparently accidential glazing in splashes); they range in
color from a dull bluish or slate color to dark brown or light red. In
form they are archaic, containing many shapes not seen in the modern
pottery of the country. In some cases they closely resemble the an-
cient Etruscan, notably in the various styles of tazza, a shallow goblet
on a stem supported by a flaring base; sometimes they are provided
with handles, but more frequently are without them.

This pottery is of various styles of workmanship, some pieces being
modeled by the hand, others paddled into shape by an instrument,
others turned on the wheel,t while the larger and more elaborate pieces

*In southern China, in the vicinity of Hong-Kong, similar jars, though not quite
so large, are used for burial purposes in place of a coffin.

tThe Korean potter’s wheel consists of a circular table from 2 to 3 teet in diameter
and 4 to 6 inches thick, made of heavy wood so as to aid in giving impetus to it
when revolving. In general appearance it is not very unlike a modeler’s table.
This arrangement is sunken into a depression in the ground, and revolves easily by
means of small wheels working on a track underneath, the table being pivoted in
the center. The wheel is operated directly by the foot, without the aid of a treadle
of any kind. The potter sits squatting in front of the wheel, his bench or seat on a
level with it, and space being left between his seat and the wheel to facilitate his
movements. With his left foot underneath him, he extends his right foot and strikes
the side of the wheel with the bare sole of the foot, causing 1t to revolye.—The
Korean Potter’s Wheel: P. L. Jouy. Science: September 21, 1888, p. 144.
592 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

show all of these methods combined. Many of the ancient shapes,
although of great beauty and utility, are not seen in the modern ware
which is far inferior to it in gracefalness of design and variety of pat-
tern of vessel. For instance, the handled mug, which is quite a com-
mon shape in the mortuary vessels, is not seen at all among modern
Korean, or indeed among Oriental vessels in general, except where it is
of obviously modern introduction.

The decoration of these vessels is in incised lines, in most cases made
by a comb-shaped instrument; simple geometrical patterns and cross-
hatching is also seen; also dots, and excisions which ornament the bases
of the jars and the covers of some of the vessels.

Inquiry among the educated classes elicited the information that
these vessels were made in ancient times to hold offerings to the dead,
and were interred in the grave with the body, and that this practice
obtained up to about the twelfth century.

A similar custom prevailed in southern Japan, and the vessels were,
moreover, of almost exactly similar shapes and style of ornamentation
as shown in Nos. 94520-1 and 94520-2 of this collection, specimens
obtained from Nara, the ancient capital of Japan. In the collection of
Mr. W. Gowland, late superintendent of the Imperial mint at Osaka,
Japan, and in the national collections in Tokio are many examples of
pottery taken from graves in Yamato which could be duplicated in this
Korean collection.

The present series and the collection in possession of the writer are
the only specimens of Korean mortuary pottery that I have any
knowledge of in this country.

In plate LXxxVI are shown, besides the example of Korean ware, an
oil-bottle, No. 94519; two specimens of ancient Japanese mortuary
pottery; also examples of Etruscan and Roman pottery showing two
styles of tazza, the ‘“tulip-shaped” vessel and the handled mug; but of
especial interest is the Roman vessel, No. 136549, in the center, which
has a base ornamented with the triangular openings of exactly similar
design as those seen in the Korean ware.

A STUDY OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY.*

HAND-BOOK FOR BEGINNERS.

By THomas WILSON.

Prehistoric anthropology is susceptible of many divisions, each of
which is sufficiently extensive to form an independent branch of sci-

ence, such as the following:

Biology and comparative anatomy.
Human anatomy.
Anthropometry, craniometry.
Comparative psychology.
Literature, language (written, oral,
sign).
Industry.
Materialsand implementsof every craft.
Clothing and personal adornment.
Habitations, and household utensils.
Weapons.
Objects for amusement.
Articles, uses unkown.
Architecture. Fine arts.
Monuments and public works.

Architecture. Fine arts—Continued.

Cliff or cave dwellings.
Towers, ruined or otherwise.
Engraving.

Painting.

Sculpture.

Ceramics.

Decoration.

Ornamentation.

Sociology.

Love and marriage, child-life.
Social organizations, customs and be-
liefs, pastimes.
Tribal organization.
Government, property, law, etc.

Roads, trails, canals, irrigating, etc. Religion, myths, creeds and cults. Folk-
Mounds—sepulchral, effigy, altar. - lore.

Forts and earth-works. Education, relief and charities.
Graves and cemeteries. Mortuary customs and furniture.

Idols and temples.

Short experience in the field will demonstrate the necessity of a
_knowledge of science, or of certain branches, of even wider scope than
those enumerated. Remains of human industry may be found which,
insignificant in themselves, derive their value from their geologic ho-
rizon. Of this kind may be mentioned the Trenton implements found
by Dr. Abbott in the gravel deposits of the Delaware River; the same
of the quartz implements found by Miss Babbitt in the terraces of the
Mississippi River, at Little Falls, Minn.; the discovery of the remains of
a prehistoric fire-place, decided by Professor Gilbert to belong to the

quaternary deposits between Lakes Erie and Ontario; and of an ob-
sidian spearhead in the white marl of the Walker River Canon formed
by the fossil Lake Lahontan in northwest Nevada, discovered by Pro-
fessor McGee; and the paleolithic implements found by Dr. Hilborn
T. Cresson, at Claymont, Delaware, and at Upland, Pa.

So also animal remains are frequently found associated with human
remains, and therefore some knowledge of zoology is required. The
stone implements themselves belonging to the prehistoric peoples re-
quire a knowledge of geology and mineralogy to determine their names
and the locality from which they come, both of which items may be of
great importance.

THE DISCOVERY OF PREHISTORIC MAN.

Denmark is entitled to the credit of the discovery of the existence
of man on earth in the ages before history began. The historic period
proper of Scandinavia began about 1000 A. D. But for centuries
before that time there had been made, frequently on stone monuments,
but also in other ways, runic inscriptions and the poetic legends of
the early times of that country, called Sagas. The antiquarians of
that country in the past century delighted in studying these Sagas.
In this pursuit they discovered Kjokenmoddings, the Danish name for
kitchen refuse, the dolmens, the polished stone hatchets, the beautiful
flint poignards, and the daggers, knives, spear, and arrow-heads, for
which that country has been so justly celebrated. They became im-
pressed with the idea that these belonged to a more ancient race of
people than that which had written the Sagas and had erected the
runic stones. They were able, by their examination and study, to sep-
arate the implements found into three grand divisions, which they des-
ignated, respectively, the ages of stone, of bronze, and, lastly, of iron.
These ages were found to have endured in these countries for a long
period of time and came to a high perfection. Thomson published his
memoir in 1536, announcing these discoveries. The conclusions were
that the Kjokenmoddings were places of habitation of prehistoric
man, or, at least, places occupied by him, and that the shells which
formed the heaps were but the refuse from his kitchen. The pieces of
flint and bone were his implements, the dolmens were his tombs, and
the polished and beautifully-worked flints were but his tools and
_ weapons. They placed his earliest occupation of these countries at

from three to four thousand years B. C. and continued it down through
the epochs of the different ages until that period when the written his-
tory of their country began.

The age of stone, when applied to the Scandinavian countries, refers
only to polished stone, for no traces of man’s existence in those coun-
tries during the paleolithic period have been found. Public attention
became attracted to the subject of prehistoric man by Dr. Ferd. Keller
in 1853, when he discovered in Lake Zurich the remains of the Swiss
Lake dwellers of prehistoric times. He found the same ages of stone,
A STUDY OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 599

bronze, and iron as have been found in Scandinavia. Other men took
up the investigation, and finally the opening of the canal between
Lakes Bienne, Neuchatel, and Morat not only brought to light the great
deposit of the iron age at La Tene, but so lowered the waters in the
two former lakes as to expose their shores, and to turn loose upon them
an army of seekers after the implements of prehistoric man.

In 1859 was developed and acknowledged as genuine the discovery
of the paleolithic period, an earlier epoch in the existence of prehistoric
man. This was called at first the age of chipped stone, because the
implements were chipped or flaked, and not polished. This discovery
was made by M. Boucher de Perthes in the valley of the river Somme,
France. Thus there were found two kinds of stone implements—the
chipped and the polished—and from their respective positions it was
concluded that they belonged to two different races of men occupying
the country at different and perhaps remote periods of time, in which
the earlier chipped the stone to make his implements, while the other
had so increased his knowledge as to be able to polish them. These
different periods were named by Sir John Lubbock paleolithic, meaning
ancient stone; and neolithic, recent stone. From that moment. prehis-
toric anthropology received an impetus proportionate to its importance,
and since then has gradually elevated its rank among the sciences.

BIBLIOGRAPHY.

Prehistoric anthropology is a new science, and although its bibliog-
raphy is not extepsive, it has attracted much public attention and many
books have been written in later years. These have either been of a.
popular character or else have related to a particular epoch or a single
locality. No complete or standard work has yet been published, either
in Europe or America. Professor Worsaae, of Copenhagen, contem-
plated such a work, of which Hon. Rasmus Anderson, United States
minister to Denmark, was to have been the English translator. But Pro-
fessor Worsaae’s death prevented the carrying out of this undertaking.

Monsieur de Mortillet published “‘ Le Préhistorique,” which, with its
album of illustrations, has become a standard work for the age of stone
in France. He now has in press.a work to be called “* The Protohisto-
rique or the Aurora of History.”

MM. de Quatrefages and Hamy have now under way a work to
be entitled “‘ Histoire Générale des Races Humaines,” to be published
by the ethnologic library, but of which there has, as yet, been issued
only the introduction by M. de Quatrefages; and “The Aztecs,” by
M. Lucien Biart.

Dr. D. G. Brinton, professor of ethnology and archeology in the
Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, has edited the portions
of the ‘“Iconographie Encyclopedia” which relate to anthropology,
ethnology, and ethnography. The articles on the two former subjects
were prepared by Dr. Brinton, and the latter was translated from the
German of Georg K. C, Gerland.
600 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

“The Prehistoric Times,” by Sir John Lubbock, is the most complete
work yet published in English.

It would be useless to attempt the mention of every book extant,
dealing with the subject of Prehistoric Anthropology. I give only the
most prominent works which should be found in almost every public
library. From these a choice can be obtained, and with these the stu-
dent may obtain a fair start in the science.

The prehistoric ages have been divided in other parts of the world
into stone, bronze, and iron, so called from the material principally em-
ployed for cutting implements.
604 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.
THE STONE AGE.

The stone age has been divided, in Europe, into periods, although
scientists are not entirely harmonious therein. The names given, are:
Eolitiic, or dawn of the stone age; the Paleolithic, or ancient stone;
and the Neolithic, or recent stone. The first two are of chipped stone,
the last is of polished stone. The first or Eolithic period belongs en-
tirely to the tertiary geologic epoch, and is not accepted by many of the
scientists of Europe. I give it a place here because of the possibility
of information we may obtain concerning it in America from disputants
and investigators. By being thus forewarned they might find imple-
ments or evidence in this country which would materially assist in solv-
ing the riddle and establish the existence of this period.

THE EOLITHIC PERIOD.

But little is known concerning this age in any part of the world.
But enough has been discovered to justify attention to and a search for
its evidences in places where.they are likely to occur. ‘The implements
will be of the rudest possible form, so much so that their human manu-
facture has been the subject of much discussion, doubt, and, many
times, denial. The materials of which the implements found have been
made are usually flint or chert, but there is no reason why the man of
that period, if he had an existence, may not have used any stone which
was capable of being chipped.

It is possible that bone or shell may have been used for implements,
and fossil specimens may be found bearing evidence of human work-
manship. While no such instance has been recognized, yet the objects
are worthy of attention. Fossilized human remains mightalso be found.
Some examples are declared to have been discovered in Europe and in
South America, not to mention the contention over the Calaveras skull.

The man of this age is claimed to have had an existence during the
tertiary geologic period. On this question the world needs enlighten-
ment. This can only be obtained by intelligent observation, accompa-
nied by accuracy of statement, with minute details, as everything de-
pends, in case of the discovery of a piece of evidence, upon the location,
situation, and association of the object, which once disturbed from its
original position can not be replaced. It is always best to call what-
ever of scientific aid is obtainable before any removal is made; also as
many witnesses as practicable.

The value of human implements or remains will be greatly enhanced
if they are found associated with the remains of fossils, especially ani-
mals belonging to that period. These shouid be gathered and reported
with all possible detail and the specimens preserved, no matter in what
number. In all discoveries of this kind the contention has heretofore
been whether the stratum in which the object is found belongs really to
the tertiary or to some later geologic formation, and after that whether
there has been any subsequent disturbance or intrusion.
A STUDY OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 605

By all means do not seek to clean the specimens by scraping or wash-
ing, nor even by brushing. The archeologic value of the Calaveras
skull was destroyed by this means.

These objects may be sought for in the clays and gravels of the
Washington Columbia formation, in the phosphate beds of South
Carolina, the coral beds in the lagoons of Florida, and the equus beds
of Texas and Mexico. It is the contention of some geologists, though
disputed by others, that the auriferous gravels of California also be-
long to the tertiary formation.

THE PALEOLITHIC PERIOD.

The paleolithic period of the stone age has been subdivided into vari-
ous epochs, though in these subdivisions and their nomenclature the
scientists of Europe are by no means agreed. M. Lartet named the
epochs after the animals which have been found associated with the
implements and called them, respectively, the epochs of the cave bear,
the mammoth, and the reindeer. Monsieur Dupont, of Belgium, divided
it only into two and named the epochs after the mammoth and the
reindeer. M. de Mortillet has divided it into four epochs and has
named them, respectively, the Chellian, after the station of Chelles, a
few miles east of Paris; the Moustierian, after the cavern of Moustier
on the river Vézere, Dordogne; the Solutian, after the cavern of Solu-
tré near Macon; and the Madelenian, after the cavern or rock shelter
of La Madeleine, Dordogne.

In later days the tendency seems ‘to be to divide them otherwise.
M. Cartailhac, M. Reinach, following Mr. John Evans, are in favor of
the first period being called that of the alluvium and the second that
of the caverns. All these gentlemen are, however, unanimous in their
agreement that this period and all these epochs, whatever they are to
be called, belong to the quartenary geologic period; that they were
earlier than the, present geologic period, and that they came to an end
before its commencement. The most certain, and therefore to me the
most satisfactory division, has been that of M. de Mortillet, named
after the various localities where the respective implements have been
found in their greatest purity. I give my preference to it, but do so
subject to the correction incident to further discovery. If for no other
reason it is more convenient. The names given are for localities and,
consequently, are purely arbitrary. They may not, perhaps, serve for
general terms over the world, but within their own locality they have
a definite and certain meaning, while to say the epoch of alluvium,
the epoch of caverns, the epoch of the drift, or the epoch of the mam-
moth, bear, reindeer, etc., might have an application in other coun-
tries which would deceive the student or reader. The names of Chel-
lian, Moustierian, ete., have no such application, are not possible to be
applied to other countries. They mean, then, just one kind of civiliza-
tion, one kind of implement, and thus we know what is meant when
606 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

these terms are used. If other countries have different things to be
described, if different epochs are found, then other names may have to
be given, but when we speak now of these epochs, the Chellian, Mous-
tierian, etc., and the implements that belong to them, the speaker and
hearer are on a common ground in which both understand the same
terms used to mean the same thing.

The world is indebted principally to M. Boucher de Perthes for the
great discovery of prehistoric man in the paleolethic period. He lived
at Abbeville, on the river Somme, about half way between Paris and
- Calais. In 1841 he found in asand-bank, then being worked at Menche-
court, a piece of flint rudely fashioned to an edge and point, which ex-
cited his attention and wonder, for he asked himself, ** How could this
stone have taken this form by any other than human intervention?” He
continued his investigations at occasional intervals, chiefly in the ex-
eavations and fillings at Abbeville and in the gravel which was be-
ing removed he found many of the same implements. In the year
1846 was published his first work on the subject, in which he announced
his belief that these were human implements and of the same age as the
gravels in which they were found. This statement made but few con-
verts; nevertheless, being an enthusiast, and pressing his belief always
in season and sometimes, possibly, out of season, came to be regarded
as what would now be called a “crank.”

Doctor Rigollot, in 1853, was the first to make such examinations of
the locality by which, finding the implements in situ, he became a be-
liever in the new theory. M. Boucher de Perthes was no exception to
the rule that prophets are without honor in their own country. At
last, however, the tide turned in his favor, and I can not do better
than to quote from Sir John Lubbock, himself one of the actors, his
description of the event: .

In 1859 Dr. Faiconer, passing through Abbeville, examined the collection of M.
de Perthes, and on his return to England called the attention of Mr. Prestwich,
Mr. Evans, and other English geologists to the importance of his discoveries. In
consequence the valley of the Somme was visited in 1359 and 1860, firstly by Messrs,
Prestwich and Evans, and shortly afterwards by Sir C. Lyell, Sir R. Murchison,
Messrs. Busk, Flower, Mylne, Goodwin-Austen, and Galton; Professors Henslow,
Ramsay, Rogers; Messrs. H. Christy, Rupert Jones, James Wyatt, myself, and other
geologists.

Mr. John Evans, in his ‘Ancient Stone Implements of Great Britain,”
describes the same event:

We examined the local collections of flint implements and the bed in which they
were said to have been found, and, in addition to being perfectly satisfied with the
evidence adduced as to the nature of the discoveries, we had the crowning satisfac-
tion of seeing one of the worked flints still in situ in its undisturbed matrix of gravel,
at a depth of 17 feet from the original surface.

The locality was also visited by the French savants who were especi-
ally qualified for such a scientific investigation. MM. Mortillet, d’Acy,

Pouchet. Dr. Gosse, of Geneva, was also an earnest and ardent
investigator. Mr. John Evans says:

Indeed it turned out, on examination, that more than one such discovery had
already been recorded, and that flint implements of similar types to those of Abbe-
ville and Amiens had been found in the gravels of London at the close of the seven-
teenth century, and in the brick earth of Hoxne, in Suffolk, at the close of the
eighteenth, and were still preserved in the British Museum and in that of the So-
ciety of Antiquaries.

The name “ paleolithic” was given to this period by Sir John Lubbock.
It is composed of two Greek words signifying ancient stone. Belong-
ing to the stone age, all its cutting implements were, of course, of stone.
The method of manufacture was by chipping, and all cutting edges or
points were thus made. The man of this period seems not to have
known, at least never employed, the method of smoothing or sharpen-
ing a stone by rubbing it against or upon another. Bone and horn
implements were also made during this period, and in its latter part
were apparently greater in numbers than the stone.

This period belongs entirely to the quaternary (pleistocene) geologic
period, and is assumed to have been contemporaneous, in Europe at
least, with the formation of the river valleys and the deposit of the
gravels therein. The climate of the first epoch is supposed to have
been warm and moist; that it afterwards grew cold, and man in West-
ern Kurope sought the caves for protection. It is believed by many
this period of cold corresponds with the glacial epoch of that country.

The fauna of the first epoch was composed principally of animals
which were extinct before our earliest knowledge of natural history.
The Hlephas antiquus, a pachyderm, the ancestor of the elephant tribe;
Rhinoceros Merckit, Trogontherium, a large beaver, have been found at
Chelles, associated with implements of human industry.

These animals are now all fossil. They belong to the quaternary
geologic period, and have never been seen or known in the present day.
They have been found in many other prehistoric stations associated
with the Chellian implements of human manufacture. Here was the
beginning of human art. This was the first art product.

The foregoing sentence might be easily overlooked. Its importance
is largely out of proportion with the space which it occupies, for it
tells the story that man existed in that country contemporaneous
with these animals, and in a geologic period so much older than the
present that one can scarcely imagine man’s antiquity as having any
relation thereto. The succeeding epochs were more like that of the
present. The mammoth came first, and after it the reindeer. One
can obtain a faint idea of the time by considering that the reindeer
which occupied Southern France in probably greater numbers than it
now does in Lapland, was the animal on which the prehistoric man of
this epoch in that country relied principally for his food. A study of
the fauna of that period in southern France, as compared with that of
the present, shows that there were eighteen species of animals, then

occupying that country, which in the present time have immigrated
to the colder regions. Thirteen of them have gone to the north, by
degrees of latitude, while five, like the chamois, mountain goat, etc.,
have retreated to the mountains in search of that cold which was nec-
essary to support their lives, and which they did not find in the sub-
sequent warm climate of southern France.

THE CHELLIAN EPOCH.

The Chellian implements here figured are the standard ones for this
period, though they were mostly almond-shaped or oval, with the cutting
edge to the point, which is the contrary to those of the neolithic period.
The body of the implement was thick, after the shape of an almond or
peach stone. It was net thin and flat like those of the later epoch, the
Solutrian, and the two are not to be confounded. They are made of
flint where that stone was obtainable; where it was not, quartz and
quartzite seems to have been employed, although any stone would serve
which was homogeneous, so that it might be flaked in every direction ;
tough, that it might hold an-edge, and hard, that it would not break or
crumble. The flint always broke under a blow with a conchoidal frac-
ture, and this may be frequently seen.

These implements differ somewhat in form and size, though they are
substantially the same. Some of them are more round; others more
pointed. A few approach the disk form, and have an edge which
might have served for scraping rather than cutting; but all we know
of this is obtained from an examination of the object itself. They were
all made by chipping, and were usually brought to an edge by the re-
moval of smaller and finer flakes. Chips, flakes, spawls, ete., the dé-
bris of manufacture, are frequently found in the deposits associated
with finished implements. Many, indeed most of the specimens, show
signs of use. Some are broken and others apparently unfinished.

Occasionally the cutting edge extends nearly around the implement,
but many times a portion of the pebble is left for a grip. So, while it is
possible it may have been attached to a handle in some ¢ases, it is evi-
dent that sometimes it was intended to be taken in the hand. The
hand may have been protected against the sharp ones by a bit of skin,
fur, grass, or other substance. I much doubt whether any of them
were attached to a handle, for it must have been with great care and
labor that the workman was able to bring them to this sharp edge all
around, and when so done it produced a form of implement very diffi-
cult to successfully insert in a handle. To make a firm attachment the
handle must envelop it at its greatest diameter, and herein lies the
difficulty. If the sharpened implement be only partially inserted, a
few hard blows would split the handle; if it be inserted too far the
same blow will drive it through. Plate LXxxvit, Figs. 1-2.

The flint of which these implements are made has, in many speci-
mens, passed, since their manufacture, through certain chemical and

physical changes on their surface. Some show a brilliancy called
patine; in some the color has changed to red and yellow, and so on
through the scale to chalky white. This change is produced by con-
tact with the atmosphere or earth, or by the contact of water which
has percolated through the various earths in the neighborhood, gener-
ally those containing iron, and has changed the chemical combination
of the flint on its surface. This change sometimes extends deep into
the stone, and in small specimens may pass entirely through it. In
the United States all this might be called weathering; in France it is
called patine. The objection to the former word is that it conveys,
possibly involuntarily, some relation to the weather, while the patine
may be formed on a specimen deep in the earth.

Dendrites are also formed on the specimens. These changes are all
evidences of antiquity of the specimen, and to the experienced eye
become testimonials of its genuineness.

The use of the Chellian implement is unknown. The wise men of
Europe have made many guesses and suppositions, but these are at
best nothing more than speculation. Many of them bear undoubted
traces of use on their edges. Mr. John Evans in his latest work re-
verts to his first and original opinion, ‘That it is nearly useless to
speculate as to the purposes to which they were applied.” Sir John
Lubbock says, “ Almost as well might we ask to what would they
not be applied. Infinite as are our instruments, who would attempt
even at present to say what was the use of aknife? But the primitive
savage had no such choice of tools. We see before us, perhaps, the
whole contents of his workshop, and with these weapons, rude as they
seem to us, he may have cut down trees, scooped them out into canoes,
grubbed up roots, kill animals and enemies, cut up his food, made holes
in winter through the ice, prepared firewood,” etc.*

The implements of the Chellian epoch are found substantially all
over the world. This would indicate, if it does not prove, the expan-
sion of that civilization, and the duration of that epoch to have been
much greater than hasever heretofore been supposed. Those from Great
Britain are found only in the eastern and southern portion, from Nor-
folk around to Devonshire and Land’s End. They have been found in
every quarter of France and southern Belgium, Italy in all its parts,
also in Spain and Portugal. They have not been found in northern
England, Scotland, Wales, or northern Ireland. Neither in northern
Belgium, or Holland, or in the Scandinavian countries, or that por-
tion of Germany bordering on the Baltic, or in northern Russia.
These countries were probably covered at that epoch with glaciers, or
possibly by the Great North Sea. Paleolithic implements have been
found in Asia, Palestine, in India from Bombay to Calcutta, in Cam-
bodia, Japan, in Africa all along the shores of the Mediterranean, and
up the valley of the Nile, and lately in the United States.

They have been called in England drift implements, because they
have been found in the river drifts or deposits. Their position when
thus found indicates the same antiquity as the river valleys themselves.
There was a time when the rivers filled the valleys from hill to hill,
pouring down with a rush and carrying the greatest quantity of water
to the sea. In that time the irresistible current eroded the earth, and,
if need be, the rock, to make for itself a waterway. As time progressed
the water subsided more or less, and the current become siower and less
powerful. The sand and gravel which had before been carried out to
the sea began to be deposited here and there in this bend and on that
point, until the deposit came to the surface of the water and formed
what is now the highest terrace. Then the river was narrowed and the
terrace became a newriver bank. This process was repeated again and
again until the river finally retreated to its present bed, and left ter-
races, sometimes three in number, the first being higher, deeper, and
more distant from the river than the others. These are now the marks
of the successive stages in the formation of the river valleys.

The sand and gravel deposit of the river at Chelles spreads out and
forms the plain of the river valley. It is from 22 to 26 feet in thick-
ness. The sand and gravel rests upon the original chalk, and is about
on a level with the highest floods of the river in modern times. These
deposits are of different degrees of fineness, and are laid in strata or
layers, showing that they were made by the action of water. The strata
are not always continuous, and differ in thickness and position, showing
that the water had varying currents. There are to be found occasional
huge blocks of erratic stone. The sand and gravel is sometimes in-
tercalated by other strata which could not have been laid down at the
same time or in corresponding manner. One of these is a stratum of
calcareous cement several inches in thickness. In many other places,
but nearer the top, are pockets or strata which contain various solu-
tions of iron, the percolating water from which gives the color to the
implement heretofore described.

There have been many and great discussions over the formation of
these river valleys and the deposits of their sand and gravel. These
as to the time, manner of formation, and antiquity. Ido not enter into
this discussion now. I merely state a fact on which all disputants
are agreed: that the implements of human industry belonging to this —
epoch are found in these river gravels, in positions which indicate their
deposit at the time of the original formation and at a distance from the
river and depth below the surface which indicates their antiquity to
be equal with the first deposit. Whetier they were swept down from
the springs which formed the headwaters of the river, were dropped on
the borders in the near neighborhood, or precisely in what manner
they became involved with the sand and gravel in which they are now
found, is not only unknown but there has as yet been developed no sat-
isfactory theory. .
A STUDY OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 611

In seeking to establish the existence of a paleolithic period in
America, it has been objected that many of the implements introduced
as evidence were found on the surface. In western Europe surface
finds are not at all uncommon. The St. Germain Museum, at Paris, ex-
hibits six cases of Chellian implements. In five of them are displayed
those from the river gravels, and in one is shown similar implements
from the surface. These are distinguished as being from the plateau.
(The plateau in this case meaning the surface of high level unaffected
by the wash of the water which formed the river.) Mr. Solomon
Reinach, curator of that museum, in his catalogue and “ Description
Raisonnée,” says, page 84:

The implements found in the ancient alluvium of the rivers are those which have
been used or have been rejected. Sometimes they are water-worn, sometimes alto-
gether new and even unfinished. * * * The implements gathered on the plateau
come from the camps or workshops. They are much less interesting than those of
the alluvium, not being accompanied by a fauna which can serve for their chrono-
logic classification. * * * As the soil of the plateaus is continually upturned
by its cultivation, which has thrown together in the same layers the remains of suc-
cessive civilizations, so the paleolithic and neolithic instruments are often found
on or near the surface mixed with those of the epoch of metal and of modern times.

The plateaux on the surtace of which these Chellian implements were
tound extends largely over the interior of France.

Dr. John Evans, the celebrated prehistoric archeologist of England,
and the author of “Ancient Stone Implements of Great Britain,” says
in that work (page 531), “ Not far from Currie Farm I found on the
surface of the ground, in 1869, a well-marked paleolithic implement, in
character and size resembling that of Stud-Hill (Fig. 462), and stained
arich ochreous color.” During a visit to Dr. Evans’s collection in 1889
the writer saw thirty or more paleolithic implements which had been
found on the surface in the neighborhood of Ightham, Kent. Mr. B.
Harrison has gathered in the same neighborhood nigh six hundred
paleolithic implements which are described by Mr. Prestwich in the
Quarterly Geologic Journal, No. 178, of May 1, 1889. I quite agree
with Mr. Reinach that these surface implements are much less inter-
esting than those found in the river gravels. I agree and have
always said that the implements thus found are not proof of the
antiquity of the paleolithic period. The most I have ever contended
was that they were evidence of its existence. The paleolithic imple-
ments of Europe have been found by the ten thousand in the river
gravels at various depths, and associated with the extinct fauna
of the Quaternary geologic period. Thus the antiquity of the paleo-
lithic period has been established without the aid of the implements
found upon the surface. In the United States this is not the case; there-
fore the discovery of the paleolithic implements on the surface have a
greater relative importance than in Europe. They, however, are evi-
dence only of the existence and not of its antiquity of a paleolithic
period. The antiquity remains to be solved by other means.
612 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Enough has been said to demonstrate that the paleolithic implements
of this epoch belong to one general type. ‘Their similarity of material,
mode of manufacture, and general appearance all testify thereto.
While there is this similarity they are not copied one from another.
Each one has an individuality, yet they can be recognized as belonging
to a common family and having a common origin. In this manner,
and for these reasons, a person acquainted with them, or who has had
sufficient experience, will be able to recognize a Chellian implement
independent of its locality or its associations. This knowledge comes
only from experience, but it is the same experience by which the Ameri-
can archeologist recognizes the genuineness of the arrow or spear
head, the polished stone hatchet, Indian pipe, and similar objects, and
is fairly able to assign them to their proper localities.

The following paragraphs, relating to the differences in form between
paleolithic and neolithic implements, may be found of interest:

A glance at the stone implements hitherto discovered in the river drift, whether of
England or France, will at once show how different in character they are, asa whole,
from those of the neolithic period, excepting, of course, mere flakes, and implements
made from them, and simple blocks and hammer-stones. So far as we at present
know, not a single implement from the river drift has been sharpened by grinding or
polishing, though, of course, it would be unsafe to affirm that such a process was.un-
known at the time when they were in use. With the unpolished implements of the
neolithic period, which most nearly approach those of the paleolithic in form, it will,
as a rule, be found that the former are intended for cutting at the broader end, and
the latter at the narrow or more pointed end. Even in the nature of the chipping a
practiced observer will, in most instances, discern a difference.

When first treating of the character of these instruments (in the Archologia, now
thirteen years ago), I pointed out these differences between the implements of the
two periods as being marked and distinct; and though since that time, from our
knowledge of the form and character of the stone implements of both periods having
been much enlarged, some few exceptions may be made to a too sweeping assertion
of the distinctions between the two classes, yet, on the whole, I think they have been
fully sustained.

Unground flint implements, with a sharp point and a thick truncated butt, and,
in fact, what I have termed tongue-shaped in form, are, for instance, no longer con-
fined to the drift, but have been found by myself, with polished implements, on tho
shores of Lough Neagh, in Ireland; and yet, though analogous in form, they differ
in the character of the workmanship, and in their proportions from those from the
gravel. The difference is such tuat, though possibly a single specimen might pass
muster as of paleolithic form, yet a group of three or four would at once strike an
experienced eye as presenting other characteristics,

In the same manner some of the roughly chipped specimens from Cissbury and
elsewhere—such, for instance, as Fig. 28*—appear to be of the tongue-shaped type,
or like other river-drift forms. These are, however, exceptional in character, and as
their finding appears to be confined to the sites of manufactories of flint implements,
where a very large proportion of the specimens found are merely ‘‘ wasters” produced
in the manufacture, it is doubtful how they are to be regarded as finished tools.

On this subject of the difference in character between the paleolithic and neolithic
forms I have been severely taken to task by M. Zinck, in the Proceedings of the So-
ciety of Northern Antiquaries of Copenhagen, who has figured several Danish neo-
lithic specimens in juxtaposition with some of my own figures of implements from the
drift. In many cases, however, the comparison is made between implements of very

——-

A STUDY OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY.  - 613

ditferent dimensions, though, by being drawn to difterent scales, they are made to
appear of the same size in the figures; and, in other cases, the specimens engraved
are apparently unfinished, or merely wasters thrown away.

But, even granting that these exceptional instances of resemblance can be found, |
there is no one who can deuy that the general facies of a collection of implements
from the river drift, and one from the surface, is totally and entirely distinct. With
regard to the Danish stone antiquities, I think I may safely say that I have as ex-
tensive a collection of them as any one out of that country; and, further, that I have
more than once examined the collections, both public and private, at Copenhagen,
as well as at Stockholm and Lund, and yet that Ido not remember to have seen any
specimen—unless possibly a mere flake or rough block—which, if placed before me
without comment, I should have taken to be paleolithic.

In most cases, even if a similarity of form should be found to exist, there will be
a difference in the character of the surface of the material; the deep staining more
especially, and the glossy surface so common on the implements from the gravel,
being but rarely met with on those from the surface soil.

But, though, on the whole, so widely differing from the implements of the neo-
lithic period, those belonging to paleolithic times show a marvelous correspondence
with each other in whatever part of England they are found; and this correspond-
ence extends, in an equal degree, to the implements found in the river gravels of
France. In illustration of this, Mr. Flower has engraved, side by side, two imple-
ments from Thetford and two from St. Acheul, each pair being almost identical
both in shape and size. But what is more remarkable still, this resemblance in form
prevails not only with the implements from the river gravels of western Europe,
but with those from the laterite beds of southern India. It is true that the material
is somewhat different, the Indian implements being formed of compact quartzite
instead of flint, and that this circumstance somewhat affects the character of the
fracture and facets, but, so far as general form is concerned, they may be said to be
identical with those from the European river-drifts.*

MOUSTIERIAN EPOCH.

This is the commencement of the cavern period. During this epoch
and the two succeeding, man inhabited principally the caverns and
rock shelters. While I would not assert that the implements and ob-
jects belonging to these epochs are not to be found on the surface and
otherwheres, yet it is true that the habitations, the workshops, the
residences, the fireplaces, hearths, ete., of these three epochs, are to be
found principally in the caverns or under the rock shelter. When
Monsieur Reinach speaks of the epoch of alluvium, he means the epoch
prior to this; when he speaks of the period of the caverns, he means
these three epochs following. It is entirely possible that these may
have been contemporaneous, that man may have occupied them all
at once, to have made and used the implements belonging to these
epochs all at one time, and such has been the contention of some emi-
nent scientists. But they are not by any means agreed upon that
theory or statement. These subdivisions of the cavern period, made
by M. de Mortillet, are Moustierian, the Solutrian, and the Madelenian.

The Moustierian is so named after the Cavern de Moustier, on the
river Vézére, Dordogne, France. The typical implements are the

point and seraper.* The point is different from all other points, in that
while one side is left flat and smooth as it was struck from its nucleus,
the retouching by which the point and edge are made is all done from
the opposite side. The scraper is made in the same way, and its pecul-
iarity is that its edge is upon the side rather than upon the end, as
it was in all succeeding epochs. These appear to have been the first
scrapers used by the pre-historic man. While the Moustierian imple-
ments have been found in the river gravels of Europe, there has been
much contention as to their contemporaneity with those of the preced-
ing epoch. But they have been found in the caverns at such depths
and with such associations as to cause many pre-historic anthropolo-
gists in Europe to believe that they formed a separate epoch, during
which the caverns were occupied by the inhabitants for a long period
of time. It has been contended that this epoch was, at least in south-
ern France, contemporary with the glacial period. This, if established,
would sufficiently account for his occupation of caves and rock shel-
ters. The extinct fauna of the preceding epoch is not found in con-
nection with these implements. The animals become more like those
of our own time. This epoch begins what has been called the cavern

period. SOLUTRIAN EPOCH.

Is so named after the Cavern of Solutré, near Macon, Saone et Loire.
The Chellian implement had in this epoch ceased to be made; also the
one-sided Moustierian point. They were probably replaced by the large
and thin spear-head which is shaped like a laurel leaf. The scrapers
have been changed in form. They are smaller, and the scraping edge
is on the end instead of being upon the side. Knives and saws of
flint also appear. The man of this epoch exceiled in the art of chip-
ping flint. Indeed, it is doubtful if any subsequent age or epoch even
equalled him. The implements are renowed for beauty of form and
fineness of finish. It is by this progress that this epoch has become
recognized. It is remarkable that these leaf-shaped implements should
be found in France in nests or en cache, and that great numbers of sim-
ilar instruments should be found in the United States likewise fre-
quently in nests. It would be exceedingly strange if, upon further
study and careful investigation, it should be discovered that the Ameri-
can implements should belong to the same paleolithie epoch, as do
those of France.t

Points were also made of bone, sometimes apparently for use in
piercing skins, or for sewing garments. Sometimes to replace the
chipped flint for spear-points. Another implement peculiar to this
epoch was a fine flint-point, apparently a spear, with a tang and shoul-
der on only one side.

But it isin its art products that this period is remarkable. The
Chellian implements and the Moustierian points and scrapers are
scarcely fine enough to be worthy of the title of artistic.

A STUDY OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 615

The art of the third period, the Solutrian, was much finer, although
confined to the chipping of flint and the making of bone and horn im-
plements. The representative implement of this epoch is the flint
spear-head or dagger, which was shaped like the laurel leaf. It was in
the working of the flint to make these objects that the best art of the
Solutrian epoch is manifested. It may be objected that there was no
art required in chipping flint implements, but an inspection of those
from the Solutrian epoch, coupled with an attempt on the part of the
objector to make one of the larger and finer, will show how far he is
from the truth.

An examination and measurement of these implements is required
to understand the delicacy of their manufacture. It must have re-
quired much education and experience and a large amount of manual
dexterity.

Figure 1 represents one of these leaf-shaped points found en cache
with ten others. It is one of the largest known, and is in the Museum
of Chalon-sur-Saone. Its length is 14 inches, its breadth 34, and its .
greatest thickness less than three-eighths of an inch. It is made en-
tirely by chipping, which is not either primary or secondary, but ap-
pears to be even tertiary. The flakes by which it has been reduced
have been struck or pressed off from the edge, and are so long and
thin as to resemble shavings rather than chips.

The art of chipping flint attained its highest point during this epoch.
It has never been exceeded, and rarely equalled in any time and by
any people. The pre-historic people of Scandinavia, in Europe, and
those of Mexico and California, in America, are the only ones which
have in any way approached it. The modern Indian has chipped his
arrow-heads, and many persons of high artistic abilities have, in the
interest of science, reproduced them, making them sometimes of flint,
obsidian, and even of common bottle-glass. Occasional persons have
used their abilities, like “ Flint Jack,” in making spurious implements
to be palmed off as genuineones. But no flint-knapper of the present
day, whether amateur or professional, has yet been able to reproduce
one of the fine, Solutrian, leaf-shaped implements. We have had to
contend many times with other fraudulent and spurious specimens
which evinced a high degree of art and manual dexterity, but never
with forgeries or counterfeits of these beautiful im plements.

MADELENIAN EPOCH.

-So named from the rock shelter, La Madelaine, on the Vézére, Dor-
dogne, about half way between Le Moustier and Les Hyzies.

This epoch endured longer than the preceding. Its stations are
more frequent; the area more extended; its implements increase in
number, variety, and form, and indicate continued progress. While in
former epochs the material used by man for the fabrication of his uten-
sils and implements was almost entirely of flint, or at least stone, in
616 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

this epoch he used bone, horn, and ivory. He made the long straight
flakes of flint in profusion, for his need for knives and saws was natur-
ally great.* Scrapers, gravers, ete., were also of flint (Figs. 1, 3, 4);
but piercers or points, needles, barpoons, hooks, and ornaments of
divers sorts, were made of bone, horn, or ivory.t

It. was in the Madelenian epoch that pre-historic art attained its per-
fection. The art of that epoch seems to have been indigenous to that
country in which its greatest manifestations have been discovered ;
that is, the Dordogne district of France. It does not seem to have
been an imitation, nor to have been borrowed from any other country
or people, but only to have been a display of the artistic tendencies of
the human mind, and a manifestation of the manual dexterity of that
period and locality. It consisted sometimes of sculpture done in the
round, sometimes of engravings or etchings on stone, bone, or horn,
possibly on wood (though such specimens have decayed), and also the
making of the bone and horn implements such as points, harpoons,
daggers, needles, etc. The decoration was sometimes of geometric
designs made by curved or straight lines, by festoons, zigzag, or her-
ring-bone, or by the same figures made by dots or points.

The principal and wonderfal manufacture of art in this epoch was
the representation of living things. Sometimes the animals represented
are at rest, but many times they are in action. Hunting scenes are
depicted in which the hunter, a man, is shown in the chase and engaged
in active conflict with his game. In one, a man is throwing a spear;
in another, the serpent bites his heel ;¢ deer in action; the reindeer with
his nose high in the air and horns thrown on his back. A reindeer
browsing, which represents a veritable landscape with perspective
drawing. The engraving and sculpture represent the mammoth, the
reindeer, horse, bison, birds, fish, serpent, musk-ox, and others.§ Some
of these are Arctic animals now found only in cold countries. Some of
these are of animals now extinct. A mammoth is found engraved on a
piece of ivory (part of his own tusk), a cave-bear was engraved on a
flat stone of schist, a poignard was made of reindeer horn, the handle
of which is in the form of a reindeer himself. These all came from
southern France, and are evidence of their existence in that locality,
for the artist must have seen them before he could depict them.

The art tools with which this work was*done have been found in con-
siderable numbers. They are of flint, and have been chipped to the
same sharp, triangular point as the steel graver of modern times.||

The implements and utensils of every-day use were objects of an art
by no means contemptible, even as compared with those of our times.
The harpoons, needles, daggers, and other implements and utensils
were so ornamented as to show an appreciation of decorative art applied
to household or domestic uses which would not be unworthy the decora-
tive schools of art of the nineteenth century.

There has also been found an instrument made of reindeer horn, the
use of which is as yet unknown. It has been named ‘ Baton (or stick)
de Commandement,” and is supposed to have been some sort of emblem
of authority. Their length was such as to require the principal part of
a reindeer horn, and from two to three holes about three-fourths of an
inck in diameter were drilled through sideways.*

These artistic manifestations are intended not alone for utility, as in
the decoration of implements, weapons, and utensils, but they display
art for its own sake. Sketches have been discovered which, like those
of many artists of the present day, appear to have been purely for
practice or for innate love of the work.t ‘l'hey are mere essays, attempts
in which the artists have made various efforts on the same piece with-
out any attempted reiation one to the other. The piece known as the
combat of reindeer, five animals, Marquis de Vibraye’s collection, is
an example. Another is a sketch of eight animals, horses and deer,
from the Cavern of Lartet, Judge Piette’s collection. These are each
on one piece; the lines run into each other. The animals represented
are without relation to each other. They have even been done from dif-
ferent planes, so that some are upside down. Some are complete ;
others incomplete. The author of these sketches was only utilizing his
material, as does the artist of to-day when he puts many studies on
the same canvas. The mammoth engraved on a laminated piece of
his own tusk, and the bear on a flat pebbie, are purely artistic, are
done solely for their art; while the sculpture of the mammoth and
reindeer, decoration of the handles of daggers and poignards are such
utilization as put one in remembrance of like work done by Benvenuto
Cellini. Similar illustrations are found in the various ‘ Batons de Com-
mandement.”

The excellent and artistic work shown in these engravings and sculp-
tures is itself strange enough. But the really wonderful and incompre-
hensible thing concerning them and the civilization belonging to this
epoch is that at the close of the period the entire culture painted on its
existence disappeared. It passed away and left no trace. Whatever
may be the trath concerning this in other parts of the world, it appears
to be certain in its relation to western Europe. This leads one to speak
of the close of this period, and what has been called by some of the
archeologists the hiatus; that is, the gap between that and the suc-
ceeding epoch or period.

- I have already shown how the human occupation during the paleo-
lithic period was spread generally over western Europe, but whether
the subdivision or epochs according to the classification of de Mortillet
extended to and were developed in other countries than France has not
been determined, and there were persons of both ways of thinking. On
one proposition, however, the archxologists seem to be agreed, that there
were subdivisions in the paleolithic period, and they are to be traced
and recognized by the differences in the human industry according to

* Plate xci, Fig. 2, and Plate xctv, Figs. 1, 3. t Plate xciv, Fig. 4.

618 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

their association and superposition. There are many illustrations to be
given. The Grotte de Placard is situated on the banks of the river
Tardoire, a branch of the Charente in the department of the same name.
A cut of this grotte is given in Plate xc, Fig. 1. By its side is shown
a section of the grotte made during its excavation. It is drawn to scale
and shows the various strata of earth or débris with which the grotte
was filled. The top layer was naturally the last in point of time to be
laid down; the bottom was just as naturally the first. The divisions
in the scale from the bottom to the top represent the various strata
found during the excavation and their component parts show by their
differences how they were deposited, each one subsequent to the other,
and what were the distinctions between the habits or industries of the
man who successively occupied the cavern during the filling of the re-
spective strata.

A.—Strata of small pieces of rock and débris fallen from the roof of the cavern, and
separating the archeologic layers: No traces of human industry, and, conse-
quently, man was not present.

B.—A stratum of the same with a fine streak of clay.

C.—The top archeologic strata, 38 centimeters in thickness, belongs to the neolithic
period tor it-contained pieces of property, fragments of polished stone flint
hatchets, barbed arrow-heads, together with the bones of modern animals.

D, ©, F, and H.—Four strata with the characteristic fauna and objects of industry
of the prehistoric period, Madalénian epoch. These four, together with the
intermediate strata are nigh 4 meters (5 feet) in thickness.

J.—A stratum of Solutrian industry of the finer and later order. Flint arrow or
spear-heads with shoulder on one end.

K.—A stratum of the lower or earlier Solutrian with leaf-shaped implements.

L.—Stratum Moustierian with a characteristic point.

Although this evidence of chronologic and successive occupations
can be repeated in many cases, yet it has not been universally ac-
cepted, and when accepted it has been with a different classification
and nomenclature. The division into epochs according to the classifi-
cation here adopted is not laid down as a hard and fast rule. It is
only tentative and liable to be changed and modified by future dis-
coveries. Whether all these subdivisions of the paleolithic period
extended to and were developed in other countries than France has
not been determined, and there are persons of both ways of thinking.
The principal cause of my willingness to adopt the theory is that it
makes a segregation of the objects and implements of the paleolithic
period, and gives them a nomenclature by which they can be described
and understood; it provides‘a common language for both hearer and
speaker.

The man of the paleolithic period left no monuments. It appears
that he built no houses for either the living or the dead. Indeed, it is
doubttul if the dead were buried or had any place of sepulcher. The
general belief is that he made no pottery. The sole exceptions to this
have arisen in Belgium, since the discovery by M. Dupont in the
Grotte de Furfooz, and MM. Fraipont and Lohest in the Grotte de Spy.
A STUDY OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 619

Portions of the skeleton of paleolithic men are believed to have been
found in several places throughout western Europe. It is useless to
attempt a full description of them; sufficient for my purpose to say
that they have been determined, from investigation of the skull, to have
been a long-headed race with retreating forehead and heavy frontal
projection. Enough bones have been found to determine that he was
of small stature, the extremities being comparatively short but heavy.
The sinuses indicate the attachment of heavy muscles, and, conse-
quently, great strength. The typical skulls of this race of men, and
which have given their names respectively to it, are that of Neander-
thal, the original of which is now at Bonn, and of Cannstadt, which is
at Stutgard, both in Germany.

I have said that the human occupation during this period, as indi-
cated by the remains of its civilization, extended generally over the
world. What became of man at its close is not at all determined, and
has searcely been studied. In western Europe the scientists have had
bettter opportunities than in this country, and, consequently, have
made greater discoveries. It is the opinion of some that there was a
hiatus between the two races; others, without admitting this, are
equally satisfied of the great differences between the two. The neo-
lithic man, so far as concerns western Europe, must have come from
the east, that great foundation of civilization and unknown cradle of
the human race. He occupied the same territory which was before
occupied by paleolithic man, but what became of the paleolithic man
is unknown and amystery. Whether he migrated to the north, follow-
ing up the Arctic animals when they took their departure; whether
the neolithic man came down upon and exterminated him; whether he
drove him off or absorbed the remnents, is as yet unknown. It may
never be known, but it is a subject for investigation, and the scien-
tists of these countries are engaged seriously in the work of examination.

On the subject of this hiatus or gap, Mr. John Evans says:

There appears, in this country at all events, to be a complete gap between the
river-drift and surface-etone periods, so far as any intermediate forms of implements
are concerned; and here, at least, the race of men who fabricated the latest of the
paleolithic implements may have, and in all probability had, disappeared at an
epoch remote from that when the country was again occupied by those who not only
chipped out but polished their flint tools, and who were, moreover, associated with
a mammalian fauna far nearer resembling that of the present day than that of the
quarternary times.

So different indeed are the two groups of animals that, as has been already re-
marked, Mr. Boyd Dawkins has shown that, out of forty-eight well-ascertained spe-
cies living in the post-glacial or river-drift period, only thirty-one were able to live
on into the prehistoric or surface-stone period. Such a change as this in the fauna
of a country can hardly have been the work of a few years, or even of a few cen-
turies; and yet we must intercalate a period of time sufficient for its accomplish-
ment between the farthest date to which we can carry back the neolithic period, and
the close of the paleolithic period as indicated by the low-level gravels. The an-
tiquity, then, that must be assigned to the implements in the highest beds of river-
620 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

drift may be represented (1) by the period requisite for the excavation of the valleys
to their present depth; plus (2) the period necessary for the dying out and immi-
gration of a large part of the quarternary or post-glacial fauna and the coming in
of the prehistoric; plus (5) the polished stone period; plus (4) the bronze, iron, and
historic periods, which three latter in this country occupy a space of probably not
less than three thousand years. A single equation involving so many unknown
quantities is, as already observed, not susceptible of solution.*

And Prof. Boyd Dawkins:

The great changes in the fauna and geography of Britain, at the close of the Pleis-
tocene age, render it very improbable that the cave men were in any way repre-
sented by the neolithic tribes who are the first to appear in prehistoric Europe.
The former possessed no domestic animals, just as the latter are not known to have
been acquainted with any of the extinct species, with the exception of the Irish
elk. The former lived as hunters, unaided by the dog, in Britain, while it was part
of the continent; the latter appear as farmers and herdsmen after it became an is-
land. Their states of culture, as we shall see presently, were wholly different. We
might expect, on @ priori grounds, that there would be an overlap, and that the former
would have been absorbed into the mass of the new-comers. There is, however, no
evidence of this. * * ” ;

From the facts at present before us we may conclude that they belonged to two
races of men, living in Europe in successive times, and separated from each other by
an interval sufficiently great to allow of the above-mentioned changes taking place
in the physical conditions of Britain. * * *

From the preceding pages the reader will gather a distinct idea of the physical
condition of Britain in the neolithic age, and of the manners and customs of the
inhabitants. The population was probably large, divided into tribal communities
possessed of fixed habitations, and living principally on their flocks and herds, ac-
quainted with agriculture, and subsisting in a lesser degree by hunting and fishing.
The arts of spinning, weaving, mining, and pottery-making were known, and that
of boat-building had advanced sufficiently far to allow of voyages being made from
France to Britain, and from Britain to Ireland. Traffic was carried on by barter, and
- stone axes were distributed over areas far away from those in which the stone was
found. Tombs also were built, some of imposing grandeur, for the habitation of the
dead in the after-world, in which the spirits were supposed to lead a life not very
different from that of the living, and at which they were worshiped by the family
or tribe, after the manner of the red Indians and many African peoples. *~ * *

The neolithic implements and the domestic animals and plants, described in the
preceding pages, have been discovered over the whole of Europe, with the exception
of northern Russia and northern Scandinavia. They imply that the neolithic civil-
ization was long established, and that it underwent so little change, if any, in the
lapse of ages that no traces of a change have been preserved to our times. Its dura-
tion varied in different countries, and it yielded place to a higher culture in Greece
and Italy long before it passed away from central and northern Europe. * * *

The introduction of this civilization is the starting-point of the history of the pres-
ent inhabitants of Europe. To the neolithic peoples we owe the rudiments of the
culture which we ourselves enjoy. The arts which they introduced have never been
forgotten, and all subsequent progress has been built upon their foundation. Their
cereals are still cultivated by the farmer, their domestic animals still minister to us,
and the arts of which they only possessed the rudiments have developed into the
industries—spinning, weaving, pottery-making, mining; without which we can
scarcely realize what our lives would be.t

A STUDY OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 621

Monsieur Gabriel de Mortillet in Le Prehistorique, page 479, dis-
cusses this hiatus between the paleolithic and the neolithic periods.
He considers that the former belonged to the quaternary geologic
period, while the latter belongs to the present, or period actual. He
says that ‘Between these two epochs (that is, between the Madalen-
ian epoch and the neolithic period) “ there are differences every where;

there exists a veritable revolution.”

(1) In the Madalenian the climate was
cold and dry, with extreme tem-
peratures.

cies—the mammoth.

And he puts in the form of a

This revolution is at once physical and industrial, natural and social.
In the physical or natural there have been great changes in the climate,
which proves changes of equal importance in the orography and geog-
raphy, which in its turn was followed by profound geologic modifica-
tion. This could be done but very slowly, and, therefore, there must
have existed a long period of time between the two epochs. This can
be assured by certain proofs. In the Grotte de Placard one can see
between the uppermost stratum, containing implements of the Madal-
enian epoch, and that which contains implements of the neolithic period
there is to be found a depot or stratum of fallen rubbish, principally
small stone from the roof of the cavern, which is completely sterile, so
far as concerns archeology, and is 70™ in thickness. The Cavern of
Laugerie Haute gives the same evidence and is even more conclusive.
Between the strata of the two periods there exists a sterile stratum of
1.30". In the Grotte dela Vache there exists a thick stratum of sta-
-lagmite, sometimes 45°", between the Madalenian epoch and the neo-
lithic period and the same difference exists between the industrial and
622 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

social cultures of the two epochs. The table just given, and which
need not be repeated, shows the industries and customs of the two
epochs to have nothing incommon. There was a substitution complete
of the former by the latter. The more advanced have entirely replaced
the primitive. It has produced a phenomenon analogous to that which
took place in America or the Oceanic Islands after the arrival of the
Kuropeans. There is no progressive or local development, but an in-
vasion of a superior civilization. There are the same changes in the
races of the men of the two epochs, but, by atavism, we may find the
type of the Chellian man reproduced in theneolithic period. If this be
established by future discoveries, it would tend to show a contact of
the two populations and that the hiatus was not real, but only a gap
in our knowledge of the civilizations of the two peoples.

NEOLITHIC PERIOD.

There was a marked improvement in the civilization of this period
over that of its predecessor, the paleolithic. This extended to many
things, but the distinguishing feature was the art of polishing or
smoothing the stone implements and weapons. Therefore it has been
called the polished stone age.

The characteristic implements of this period are the polished stone
hatchets, called celts in England and America. They are found like
the paleolithic Chellian implements, which preceded them, substan-
tially all over the world, thus showing that this civilization must have
endured for a long period of time and comprised an extensive popula-
tion. The materials differ according to locality, and the form may
vary with the requirements of the material.

The standard hatchet in Alaska is made of nephrite, that of the West
Indies may be made of shell ; there may be also slight differences of
form, some having a square FO: others being pointed. The Scandinavian
hatchees are usually square in section and therein are different from
others; they are also much longer, but this arises from the peculiarities of
the material. The general likeness in these implements prevails through-
out the world notwithstanding the minor differences mentioned. While
an experienced prehistoric archeologist may be able to determine from
an inspection of the polished stone hatchet from what country it comes
and possibly to what locality it belongs, yet the statement is true that
they are substantially the same implement and that the invention of the
art of polishing, together witi the form of hatchet, has passed by com-
munication from people to people, country to country, and descended
from generation to generation until it has spread everywhere. A series
of the polished stone hatchets, or celts, from almost any one of the
United States will stand as a fair representative of the same implement
in any other State or country. The single exception to the universality
of this statement is from Scandinavia. I shall not at present attempt
any general description of the implements, weapons, or ornaments of
A STUDY OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 623

this period. That will be reserved until I come to speak of those from
the United States, when it can be done more in detail and will not be a
repetition.

The stone arrow or spear-head or knife is another equally charater-
istic implement or weapon of this period. The North American Indian
was in the neolithic period of the civilization at the time of the discovery
of the continent by Christopher Columbus. Although he used copper
as a material for implements, yet it did not displace stone nor was its
use sufficiently extended to establish an age of copper.

Another characteristic of the neolithic period was its monuments.
Their erection and construction by man began in this period, and are
therefore its oldest representatives in every country. In the United
States they consist of mounds and earthworks, likewise stone and other
forts. In western Europe principally of dolmens, menhirs, cromlechs,
and alignments. I will not attempt any description of the monuments
of the United States further than to say that many of them are believed
to have been places of sepulture. Some of the forts, from their appear-
ance and location, seem to have been erected as places of defense or for
safety. But there are vast numbers both of mounds and earthworks
which would seem so illy suited for the respective purposes indicated as
that it is difficult to believe they were sointended. Many theories and
arguments have been presented, but much of it has been of that kind
which darkeneth wisdom by words without knowledge.

The excavations into the mounds and other prehistoric monuments
in the United States have been unfortunately made more in pursuit of
trinkets and to add numbers to the owner’s collection than in the in-
terest of science or for the purpose of discovering the history, customs,
or civilization of the men who made the mounds. Any description at
this time would necessarily be imperfect, and probably all who read
this pamphlet will have had as much general and indefinite knowledge
of these monuments as could be here given. Those who would know
more concerning this subject must be referred to the special works

treating thereon.
DOLMENS.

The neolithic monuments of western Europe may be briefly described.

The dolmen was made in the form of a chamber or series of com-
municating chambers or alley-ways with sides, floor, and covers, and
was atomb.* Its floor and entrance were at about the level of the
neighboring surface, and the entire monument is believed to have been
covered with earth; thus in ancient times it was a tumulus. t

The covering stones of a dolmen have been found to weigh 5; 10, 20,
and 40 tons.t Used for sepulture they may be described as houses for
the dead. They are perhaps the earliest form of receptacle for the dead,
although the Kistvaen, made of smaller flat stones with sides, ends, top,

* Plates xcv to XCIX. aes iH Plate Xovu, Fig. 1.

624 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

and bottom shaped like a box or chest (Kist) and covered with stones
like a cairn, may be older, but they may also have only been the sep-
ultures of a poorer people. —

The dolmens, usually square but sometimes round, were made in the
form of chambers, sometimes as small as 4 by 6 feet, 4 feet high; some-
times these were 16 feet wide, 30 feet long, and 8 feet high. Most of the
dolmens consist of a single chamber, but many have as many as six
lateral chambers. They are made of huge flat unhewn granite stones,
which are stood on end or edge to form the sides and ends of the cham-
bers.* The covering stones (which are called tables) are large, and a
single one is sometimes sufficient to cover the entiremonument.t The
dolmens usually have a gallery or corridor leading to the chamber,
made in the same way. This is for approach to the chamber. This
gallery is about 3 or 4 feet wide and as many or more high, sufficient
fora man to make easy entrance. It is sometimes blocked with an-
other slab of granite at the inside and nearest the chamber, sometimes
at the outside, and sometimes both. Fig. 2¢ will explain this. In this
example the door has fallen in. Their orientation is irregular. They
open in every direction, north and south, east and west; but there are
more to the south than to the north, and more to the east than to the
west. The greater number open towards the southeast. For purposes
of comparison the ground plan of several of the important dolmens are
here given.§ It will be perceived that though they are all one general
type, yet no particular or precise form has been invariably followed in
their construction. Each one has its own individuality and differs from
any other.

The fine unshaded lines indicate the covering stones. The direction
of the opening is indicated by letters SSE, ete.

It is believed that the interments were made continuously in the same
sepulcher (as is done partially in our own vaults), a practice which pre-
vails to a certain extent in the country to the present day. When the
dolmen or tomb became full, the skeletons could have been taken out
and deposited in an ossuary.

It was once the fashion to speak of these monuments as having be-
longed to the Druids. This seems to have been a tradition that has
grown up within historic times and long after the Druids had passed
away. The dolmens belonged as well to the age of bronze as to that
of polished stone. Incineration and inhumation were both customary,
but the former method pertains more to the bronze age.

There are about thirty-five hundred dolmens in France. They are
plentiful in the center, south, and west, but rarer in the north and east;
plentiful in Great Britain and Ireland, in Spain and Portugal, in Den-
mark and Sweden; some in Belgium and Holland, the Rhine country,
and Western Germany; none in Norway; almost none in Italy; none
in Eastern Europe. The city of Dresden marks about the dividing
longitudinal line. They are found on the coast of Northern Africa be-
tween Morocco and Tripoli, in Palestine, in Asia, in South and Central
America, but not in North America.

Many of the dolmens are now covered with earth, and these have
been called tumili. It is believed by those best qualified to judge, after
the longest experience and closest examination, that all have been at
one time so covered. One reason for this belief is that it is universal
to find the gallery, corridor, or covered way made of the same kind of
Stones in the same way, on the same level, and leading from the prin-
cipal chamber, gradually narrowing in both width and height to what

‘would appear to have been the circumference of the tumulus. In this
regard the dolm:n now without a tumulus corresponds exactly with
those covered by one. Some of these corridors are 40 and 50 feet
in length. In this way the tomb could be covered, the monument com-
pleted, and yet the entrance be easily opened and entered upon the
occasion of a second or subsequent interment.

The covering of these tumuli consists of layers of broken granite alter-
nated with layers of clay and mud from the seashore and vegetable
earth from the neigboring surface.

The tumulus of Gav’r Inis has a dolmen remarkable for the sculp-
turings. It is 8 feet by 7, 5 feet 8 inches high, with a corridor or
alley 14 feet long, 4 feet 6 inches wide; 5 feet 4 inches high, while the
tumulus crowning it is 180 feet in diameter and was 30 feet high, (See
Plate xcvi.) .

156 wide and 30 feet high; Mont Saint Michel 320 feet long, 120 feet
wide and 80 feet high; Kercado is about 100 feet in diameter and 20

feet high.
MENHIRS.

The dimensions of some of the menhirs is as follows:

Penmarck, 25 feet high;* Cadiou, 28; Mount Dol, 31; Plouarzel, 363;
Plesidy, 37, and Lochmariquer, 673. The latter, fallen and broken, is
134 feet wide and 74 feet thick, and weighs 347 tons. There are seven
hundred and thirty-nine of these in Brittany. The menhir stands sin-
gle and alone. Whenarranged in parallel lines, as they sometimes are,
they are called alignments.

ALIGNMENTS.

The Province of Brittany has twenty-three alignments—one-half of
those in all France. The department of Morbihan and Finistére have,
together, seventeen of these. Carnac has in its immediate neighbor-
borhood six out of these seventeen. These six alignments represent
three thousand menhirs.

Menec, near Carnac, has eight hundred and thirty-five menhirs, ar-
ranged in eleven parallel lines, 3,778 feet in length, and 328 feet in
breadth at the head, tapering to 200% feet at the tail. It has atits head
a cromlech of sixty-two menhirs.

Kermario has six hundred and seventy-eight menhirs, no cromlech,
nine parallel lines, 4,037 feet in length—same width as Menec.

Kerlescant has two hundred and fifty-eight menhirs, a cromlech
Square of thirty-nine menhirs, thirteen lines, 1,000 feet in length—393
feet width at the head and 164 at the tail.

Erdeven has thirteen lines, one thousand one hundred and twenty
menhirs, 6,886 feet in length, 836 in width at the beginning, and 180 at
the end.

About one-half of these have been overthrown and are lying on the
ground. Nearly 10 per cent. should be added for the menhirs known to.
have been destroyed in modern or historic times. Without doubt the
gaps now existing were once filled. This would double, at least, the
number. These monuments have served as stone quarries for the
neighborhood, and doubtless the great castles and churches of the early
ages were built therefrom.

There is on the menhirs no mark of tool or quarrying, yet I think
they were quarried. They are so much weathered that all marks are
worn away. Look at the weathering on the top of the menhir of Pen-
marck (Pl. ©, Fig. 2). No traces of a quarry have been discovered,
though the granite of which the menhirs are formed is the local rock,
coming always and many times quite to the surface. The menhirs have
evidently been planted. In most cases they stood on the surface with-

out any foundation, but foundations had been built where needed. In
many cases the smaller end of the stone was downwards.

Flint implements and chips, and broken pottery are found about and
among the alignments as elsewhere over the country, especially around
the foot of the menhirs, showing a prehistoric occupation; but no
traces of the use or purposes of the menhirs or alignments have ever
been discovered. There have been many theories broached but no
facts adduced sufficient to support them. ‘They have been called mili-
tary camps or religious or other rendezvous for the people. They may
have been tents. No trace has been found of their use as burial places,
and so far as established by ascertained fact, the popular idea is as
near the truth as any other, viz., that they were the columns of a sac-
rilegious invading army, turned to stone by the wrath of an offended

God. .
SCULPTURINGS.

Many of these stones or monuments have marks or sculpturings on
them. The menhirs of the alignments have cup markings only, and
these are rare. In some cases they have been marked in modern times
with crosses, made sometimes by religious devotees, sometimes by the
priests, done in order to prevent or break up any chance remaining
pagan custom of worshipping, revering, or employing these stones.
The dolmens are marked with various signs. These might be set out
in full but for want of space, though none however have any discovered
signification.

LAKE DWELLINGS.

Switzerland is the country of lake dwellings, because it abounded in
lakes, and the mountains were not inviting dwelling places; but lake
dwellings extended over the adjoining districts of France, Italy, and
Germany, were similarly situated, and they have lately been found in
Scotland.

The lake dwellings were, as their name imports, human habitations on
the lakes. They were built near the shore, consisted of houses, and
possibly other structures, such as shops, barns, stables, granaries, —
erected on piles placed in the lake bottom, and which, standing above
the surface of the water, were cut to a general level and then floored
over for the entire settlement. The houses were connected with the
mainland by a bridge (probably with a draw), the piles of which it was
constructed being often found.

There have been differences of opinion as tothe houses. Keller sup-
posed them to have been square or a parallelogram, while Dr. Gross
believes them to have been round. They were destroyed before the
beginning of history, and practically all that is known of them is de-
rived from the discovery of the relics. The water has preserved the
piles so that they are frequently visible from the surface, though they
are usually decayed to the surface of the earth at the bottom of the
628 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

lake. Many times, as at Robenhausen, the lake has filled up with peat
and turf, and the piles and other objects are only found by digging.

Such is always the case with the terremare of northern Italy. These
were probably lake dwellings similar to those of Switzerland. The evi-
dence of the use of piles is manifest, and from the relics found it is
believed that they were contemporaneous in time and in civilization.

The greater number of lake dwellings are supposed to have been over
the water, although near the shore and where it was shallow, but many
(the number can not be estimated, owing to the greater facility for decay
and destruction) were on the mainland.

The era of lake dwelling forms no epoch in itself; they were only the
incidents of location. The dwellings on a given spot may have been
removed again and again, even in the same age, the preceding settle-
ment having been destroyed, possibly by fire, possibly by an enemy.
At Robenhausen, which station has given its name in France to the
neolithic age, there were three prehistoric occupations, one on top of
the other, and each was destroyed before the next began. The tops of
each set of piles are from 3 to 5 feet higher than the earlier set. The
number of houses in the first occupation has never been estimated ;
that of the second has been estimated at thirty, and the third and last
at fifty houses. The settlement covered nearly three acres and con-
tained about 100,000 piles.

Keller reported in 1879 one hundred and sixty-one prehistoric lacus-
trine stations, and I can suppose the number discovered has doubled
since then.

The occupation of the lakes for dwellings continued through the
bronze and iron ages, as well as during that of stone. These different
occupations were not always continuous, perhaps never were. In many
places, notably at Morges, on Lake Geneva, there are three different
stations occupied by prehistoric man, each independent of the other—
all within a space of 500 or 600 yards. The first was called ‘‘The
Church,” the implements of which were all stone—no metal; the second,
Roseaux—a mixture of stone and the straight flat bronze hatchets be-
longing to the earliest period ; the third, the great city of Morges, in
which the implements found, to the number of five or six hundred, all
belonged to the fine age of bronze—no stone. Here there could have
been no contemporaneity—no mixture. Each must have been destroyed
before the other began. That this could be, is proved from what we
know from history, for the present town of Morges has existed for a
thousand or fifteen hundred years, until 1854, without a suspicion that
these other three towns had consecutively existed on its site.

In the Lake of Geneva there are fifteen or twenty stations belonging
to the neolithic age and twenty-five or thirty to the bronze age. In the
common cantonal map there is shown in Lake Bienne two stations of
the stone age, four of bronze, and four of iron—in Lake Morat five of
stone, four of bronze, and two of iron—in Lake Neuchatel nineteen of

stone, sixteen of bronze, and four of iron. This is highly imperfect, for
I know many stations not noted, and where noted as one they really
include several stations. At Chevroux, Lake Neuchatel, I found twelve
stations, of which seven belonged to the neolithic and five to the
bronze age, yet they are noted at only one of each. An idea of the ex-
tent of these stations may be obtained from the fact that they contain
from ten thousand to one hundred thousand piles. I drew one out at
-Estavayer, Lake Neuchatel, and brought it home, and it and its cast
are now in the Smithsonian Institution. At the station of Wallishofen,
Lake Zurich, discovered about three years since, there have been found
no less than two thousand bronze hair-pins, some long with large and
beautiful heads, which, when polished to their original gold color, must
have given a gorgeous appearance to the female head-dress of that age.

BRONZE AGE.

So called because bronze was the material of which the cutting im-
plements were made. The progress in its manufacture is plainly indi-
cated in both form and method. The material is not a natural primi-
tive one, but a combination of copper and tin in varying proportions
of 9tol. It was not made in Europe, but seems to have been brought
from Asia, and was used over many times by recasting. No less than
fifty-seven foundries of bronze have been discovered in France, and a
proportionate number in Italy, the one at Bologna having no less than
fourteen thousand pieces broken ready for melting and recasting. The
people of the bronze age in Europe were the desc2ndants of those of
the neolithic age, and their hatchets were at first made in the same
general form as the polished stone hatchet of their ancestors. They
were straight, flat, thin, and made by hammering. Increased strength
was obtained by hammering the edges into projections which after-
wards increased to wings. This was the second step of progress. Then
the hatchets were cast in moulds with wings and a stop which pre-
vented the splitting of the handle. Lastly was invented the socketed
hatchet, into which the handle (bent at the poll) was inserted. Nearly
ail the latter forms had an eye with a hole therein, on the inside of the
hatchet, by which it could be lashed to the handle which prevented
the edge from working outwards.*

PALEOLITHIC IMPLEMENTS IN AMERICA.

The paleolithic implements of the United States are similar to those
of Europe in form, appearance, and mode of manufacture, though not
usually so well finished. If classified according to Mortillet, they
would belong to the earliest epoch of the paleolithic period—the Chel-
léen. The investigations concerning these implements have not been
very profound, nor has it been settled to the satisfaction of all prehis-
toric archeologists, perhaps not even to a majority, that they are truly
paleolithic implements. There have been various contentions concern-
ing this.

* Plate ci, Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4.
630 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

They have been discovered in almost every State of the United States,
and if they be accepted as such, their presence would prove the occu-
pation of America by man during that period. This presence and oc-
cupation, and the consequent antiquity seems to have been established
by the discovery of implements of human manufacture which it is not
possible to avoid calling paleolithic, at various localities in the United
States. These implements have been found to the number of several
hundred by Dr. Abbott in the gravels of the Delaware River, as they
were washed from the glacial terminal moraine and deposited at Tren-
ton, New Jersey ; also by Miss Franc E. Babbitt, in the gravels of one
of the terraces of the Mississippi River, at Little Falls, Minnesota.
Similar implements have also been found in the gravels of the Little
Miami River, at Loveland, Ohio, in White River, Indiana, and in the
Columbia gravels of the railway cuts south of Chester, Pennsylvania.
The association and condition of these finds would seem to satisfaeto-
rily establish the antiquity of man’s occupation in this country. Simi-
lar implements have been discovered on the surface in almost every
State.

A circular, No. 36, was issued by the Smithsonian Institution in
January, 1888, in which the following questions were put for informa-
tion concerning these implements:

Question 1.—How many of these rude stone implements have you in your collec-
tion ? ;
Question 2.—Of what material are they made?
Question 3.—Where have they been found ?
(1) As to locality.
(2) Position, condition and associated with what objects.
(3) Whether on or under the surface, and if so, at what depth, and in what kind
of geologic formation.
(4) Were they found in mounds, tombs, or other ancient structures.
(5) Were any other ancient implements found with them, and if so, of what kind.
(6) Did their deposit seem to be accidental or intentional.
(7) Have they been described in any publication, and if so in, what, and where
can it be obtained. ;
(8) Can you forward specimens (as many as possible) to this Museum in exchange
for publications or duplicate specimens.

Answers and information responding to these questions not hereto-
fore given are still desired, to the end that the record may be kept up.*

Cuts of certain paleolithic implements were given for information
and comparison, among which were the following:

*The information received up to date in reply to this inquiry is embodied in a
paper in this report entitled ‘‘ Results of an inquiry as to the existence of man in
North America during the paleolithic period of the stone age.”

This implement* was made from a pebble which has been split in two.

The upper or flat surface shows the chips
with the bulb of percussion by which it was
worked. A portion of the rolled surface of
the pebble is left untouched, and shows in the
cut, proving beyond doubtits intentional and
consequently human manufacture. It is im-
possible that these fractures should have
been either natural or accidental. This ex-
hibition of the rolled surface, the crust of the
pebble, is a peculiarity belonging chiefly to
the valley of the Potomac, where they have
been found in considerable numbers. Ihave
ventured to name this the Washington imple-
ment, in contradistinction from that other
kind which is chipped all over, shows no
trace of the crust of the pebble, and which

found more frequently in the river valleys and on the lowlands, while
the others are found more on the bluffs and highlands. They may be
found in the neighborhood of mounds and other places of apparent
Indian occupation, while the larger kind do not always seem to be.

This implement* corresponds closely in appearance, material, and
mode of manufacture to the average paleolithic implement; but there
is a remarkable difference in that this is notched on the edges, appar-
‘ently for the purpose of attaching a handle with a withe or thong,
and some of them show traces of such usage by these edges being
worn smooth. This feature is unique and has never been found
belonging to an undoubted paleolithic implemment. The question
whether they are paleolithic must therefore be held in abeyance and
for further examination. They have been reported principally from
the Atlantic slope. The United States National Museum possesses
about sixty-five specimins. It has been suggested that these imple-
ments have been used as agricultural digging implements, also that
they have been used as adzes for the making of canoes and for scooping
out soap-stone pots and vessels. If any of these uses should be accepted
it would decide prima facie that they were not paleolithic.

The following is a résumé of the information and contributions
received in response to this circular.

There is a question yet to be examined, whether certain leaf-shaped
implements (see Fig. 15), the same being long, thin, and well-formed
chipped points (spear-points), made frequently of the same material, and
found associated with the ruder forms just described, may not also be-
long to the paleolithic period, but not to the same epoch. These may
possibly be found to belong toa later epoch which corresponds with the
Solutréen of Europe. This, however, waits further investigation.

NEOLITHIC IMPLEMENTS IN AMERICA—INDIAN RELICS.

The civilization of the aboriginal occupants of the United States,
whether mound-builders, or the red Indian in possession of the country
at the time of its discovery has been assigned to the neolithic period.
Many cupper implements have been found, and were used, but there
was never such general use of that metal as to establish what might be
called the epoch of copper. Stone does not appear to have been super-
seded as material forimplements. This can not be attributed to scareity
of copper, but rather to its want of favor among the savages. They
were about as difficult and tedious to make as were the stone imple-
ments, while, when made, they were much softer and more inefficient.
Altogether, they do not seem to have possessed sufficient advantages
over the stone implement to have displaced it. The principal objects
and implements, whether tools, weapons, domestic articles, those for
ceremony, gaming, and many for ornamentation, continued to be made
‘of stone. Pottery was, of course, made and used to a great extent.
Some domestic articles and many for personal decoration were of bone
and shell.

Illustrations of types of these objects taken from the originals in the
National Museum will be given in the following pages.

ARROW OR SPEAR-HEADS, OR KNIVES.

These are of almost every form, material, and size. With but slight
differences in these qualities, they are found all over the United States,
and are substantially the same as those of the prehistoric ages in
all parts of the world. Their various uses, as indicated in the title,

are net known with certainty in all cases. Their difference in size

seems to have indicated the difference in name. Except for this the
same implement might have served as either arrow or spear-head
or knife. A tang indicates attachment to a shaft or handle, and this,
if found, would determine its purpose. Instances of this attachment
occur on the Pacific slope, but in the eastern half of the United States
specimens bearing such evidence are practically unknown. They might
have been fastened with a cord, or with some adhesive substance.

Every finder should examine his specimens carefully for evidences of
any sort of attachment, and if found the specimens should be for-
warded for examination.

CHIPPED DAGGER OF GRAY FLINT.
(Cat. No. 9330, U. S. Nat. Mus. Froma mound in Alabama. Collected by N. T. Lupton.)

The Museum possesses one specimen of a knife or dagger with the
handle complete, chipped from a single piece of flint somewhat after
the fashion of like implements from Scandinavia. It also possesses a
dozen or more specimens of knives, principally from California, the
handles being short, with the flint blade inserted and fastened with
bitumen. In some cases the handle has been preserved, but in others
the bitumen alone remains as evidence of the attachment.

Fig. 14.
Fiint KniFe, attached to short wooden handle by bitumen.
(Cat. No. 14329, U.S. Nat. Mus. Southern Utah. Collected by Maj. J. W. Powell.)

The Museum possesses a specimen which has served as a knife, but
without any handle being attached thereto; instead it is wrapped with
a strip of otter skin. It is a large specimen, 7 inches long, 24 wide,
and one-half inch thick, and is leaf-shaped. It was collected by Capt.
Philip H. Ray, U.S. Army, from the Natano band of Tinneh (?) Indi-
ans at Hupa Valley, California. It is of mottled obsidian, which is
said to have come from Oregon. Captain Ray relates that these imple-
ments were held in great veneration by the old Indians, and that this
had been used as a charm or talisman. In writing of the Hupas, Mr.
Powers, in his ‘‘ Tribes of California,” says, page 79:

There are other articles paraded and worn in this and other ceremonial dances
which they will on no account part with, at least to an American, though they some-
times manufacture them to order for one another. One of these is the flake or knife
of obsidian or jasper. I have seen several which were 15 inches or more in length
and about 24 inches wide in the widest part. Pieces as large as these are carried
aloft in the hands in the dance, wrapped with skin or cloth to prevent the rough
edges from lacerating the hand, but the smaller ones are mounted on wooden handles
and glued fast. The large ones can not be purchased at any price, but I procured
some about 6 inches long at $2.50 apiece. These are not properly “knives,” but
jewelry for sacred purposes, passing current also as money.
640 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

LEAF-SHAPED IMPLEMENTS.

These, or similar implements, generally called leaf-shaped, have been
found nearly all over the United States, many times deposited inten-
tionally in nests or caches, sometimes to the number of a hundred or
more, placed on end or on edge, and together as close as they can
stand or lie. It is curious to note that in that portion of the United
States east of the Rocky Mountains we are practically without informa-
tion concerning their use or purpose, whether they were used as spear-
heads or knives; whether they were objects of ceremony, as mentioned
by Powers above, or whether they were intended for practical use.
No one knows whether they were used naked in the hand or were at-
tached toa handle. Dr. Metz and Professor Putnam discovered in 1884.
in the Mariott Mound, No. 1, Little Miami Valley, ten points of deer
antlers, which were grooved or chamfered, so that they might have
served as handles for these leaf-shaped implements. But no leaf-
shaped implements were found in connection therewith. Of the ten
handles one had a piece of bone inserted for a cutting or piercing im-
plement, and another a bit of worked flint, but it was triangular, and
had no relation to the leaf-shaped implements, and was to be classed
among the arrow-heads of common form.

LEAF-SHAPED IMPLEMENTS.

Barbaraand the adjacent portionsof Mexico. Here they have been found
in burial places which appear to be, without doubt, prehistoric. The
great archologic interest of these leaf-shaped implements is that in
Europe they belong to the paleolithic period, and are the type of the
Solutréen epoch. They have been called in France fewille de laurier,
laurel leaf. In America but a slight consideration has been given to
them. They have always been considered as Indian, and the possibility
of their belonging to the paleolithic period has never been contemplated.
H. Mis, 142, pt. 2——41
642 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

It would become intensely interesting if, now that the attention of the
public is directed to these implements, they should be found so associ-
ated with other paleolithic implements, or with the fauna, or under cir-
cumstances which would point to their belonging also to the paleolithie
period.

NorrE.—Between the time of the preparation of this paper and the
reading of its proof, I have prepared for the Museum, a classification of
arrow or spear heads or knives, ashort description of which is as follows:

LEAF-SHAPED.

Sub-class A: Thin and finely-shaped implements of the form of a laurel leaf; ellip-
tical and pointed at both ends. They correspond substantially with the French
Solutrian type of the paleolithic period of the stone age.

Sub-class B: These may be thicker and ruder than subclass A. Some are more
oval, and the bases are not pointed, but are either straight or convex. The class in-
cludes the leaf-shaped argillite implements found by Dr. Abbott in the Delaware
River gravels of Trenton, N. J.

Sub-class C: These are long, thin blades with nearly straight edges, more like a
dagger or poignard. The base may be either convex, straight, or concave. Many of
them show traces of attachment to a handle by means of bitumen or gum. They
are peculiar to the Pacific Slope.

TRIANGULAR.

This class includes all forms approaching a triangle, whether the bases or edges be
convex, straight, or concave. They are without stems, and cousequently without
shoulders, but in some specimens the concavity of the base produces barbs.

STEMMED.

This class includes all varieties of stems, whether straight, pointed, or expanding,
and all varieties of bases and edges, whether convex, straight, or concave.

Sub-class A: Lozenge-shaped.

Sub-class B: Shouldered, but not barbed.

Sub-class C: Shouldered and barbed.

Notre.—Nearly all of the convex bases are smooth, asthough they had been worn.
The purpose or cause of this is unknown.

PECULIAR FORMS.

These have such peculiarities as distinguish them from aiJ other classes, but by rea-
son of their restricted number or locality can scarcely form a class of themselves.

Sub-class A: Beveled edges. The bevel is usually in one direction.

Sub class B: Serrated edges.

Sub-class C: Bifurcated stems.

SCRAPERS.

Thick flakes of flint, obsidian, ete. Worked at one extremity to a
convex edge. They were inserted in a handle and used for scraping
any needed substance, but principally for dressing skins. Nos. 38 and
41 are from Texas; 39, 40, and 319 from Ohio.
A STUDY OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 643

Occasional specimens are found shaped more or less like No. 40, with
a tang and barb much resembling in that regard certain arrow or spear

SCRAPERS.

heads, from a broken one of which it is supposed they have been made,
thus serving a secondary purpose.

PERFORATORS.

They may have served to drill the harder substances, but also softer
materials, as wood, hides, bone, etc. But slight traces of usage are
found. Their form has given rise to the theory that they were drills
or perforators, and they may have been so used, but it is by no means
certain, and they may have had another origin or purpose. Old Indians
have declared them to have been charms or fetiches.

Fig. 18.
PERFORATORsS.

Nos. 32, 35 are from Ohio; 33 from Oregon; 34 from Missouri; 36
from Tennessee, and 37 California. No.7 is triangular, of brown flint
from Santa Cruz Island, California.
644 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.
HOES OR DIGGING TOOLS.

Dr. Rau describes these as “large, flat implements of siliceous mate-
rial, usually ovoid in shape and sharp around the circumference. They
are supposed to have been used as spades or hoes. The lower part is
often smoothed by wear, appearing almost glazed.” These are prob-
ably the largest style of chipped implements belonging to prehistoric
times. The Museum possesses specimens 16 inches long, 6 wide, and 1
inch thick. I am not satisfied with the explanation of the smooth or

polished appearance at the lower end. ‘They may have been smoothed
by use in digging, but many times the polish appears to be indicative
of another origin.

No. 54 is from Tennessee; 54a and 55 are from Illinois.

POLISHED STONE HATCHETS.

These are sometimes called celts, from the Latin word chisel, but
they are not chisels, but chopping tools used as axes or hatchets.
The correctness of the Latin word has been assailed, and the name is
being gradually abandoned. They have been also called in the United

‘States (I think improperiy) fleshers. They are the standard implement
representing the neolithic period, or polished-stone age. They were
often made of flint, but any hard, close-grained, and tough stone in the
locality would serve. They are substantially the same in form, size,
and, subject to the above suggestion, the same material in all parts of
the world. <A series of these implements from the United States will
not differ essentially from a like series of any other country. They
were used as a hatchet, being inserted in a handle of wood; occasion-

ally in a socket of deer-horn, which, in its turn, was inserted in a
wooden handle.

Specimens made of hematite are, I believe, peculiar
to the United States.

coast.

GROOVED AXES, HAMMER HEADS, AND HAMMER-STONES.

The grooved axes are peculiar to the United States. They are not
found at all, or rarely, in European countries. They were used with a
handle, which was attached by means of a withe or thong which passed
around in the groove. They were of nearly all sizes, from 2 inches
in length, weighing 3 or 4 ounces, to one in the Museum from IIli-
nois 13 inches long, 74 wide, and weighing 205 pounds. The different
styles are shown by the figures. No. 72, greenstone, is from Massachu-
setts. The average size and weight was from 5 to 7 inches in length
and weight 14 to 2 pounds. No. 73, greenstone, is from Arizona; 74,
greenstone, is from South Carolina; 75 is from Wisconsin ; 76, green-
tone, is from Alaska; 77, graywacke, is from Pennsylvania.

Hammer-stones.—The largest number of these are simply pebbles or
broken stones which have been used by holding in the hand. Their
broken and battered corners and edges, pecked and roughened by num-
berless strokes, are the only evidence of their use. Some large and

the attachment of a handle. These are called mauls. No. 78, granite,

hammer-stones are flat or oval pebbles, with an intentional worked de-

Kurope. The Brothers Siret found similar implements in the mines of
southeastern Spain, ‘The British Museum has some specimens from the
English mines.

No. 79 is a weapon or implement belonging to the modern Indians,
a quartzite pebble weighing 2 pounds, incased in rawhide, which con-
tinues and is sewed around the withe which forms the handle.

ORNAMENTS, CEREMONIAL AND DECORATIVE OBJECTS, GAMING IM-
PLEMENTS.

There are a great number of objects widely different in form and
material, but which, with all their differences, may be classed together.
They have largely passed out of use by the modern Indians, and their

actual purpose is unknown. Divers names have been given to them,
all of which have been based upon a theoretical idea of their purpose
or because of their appearance. Some have been called banner-stones,
some drilled ceremonial weapons, some pierced tablets, others gorgets,
pendants, bird-shaped objects, boat-shaped objects, ete. The names
thus given may or may not be correct, but are as good as others that
have been suggested in their stead. They should be retained until
something more correct can be given. ‘They are all supposed to fall
within the category given in the title above.

Banner-stones, or drilled ceremonial weapons.—These are for the most
part symmetrically shaped and well polished. Their material is gen-
erally a soft kind of stone, principally slate, ofttimes banded. They
are all drilled with a small hole. These holes have apparently never
been used, for their edges (as well as the corners of the implements) are
as fresh and sharp as the day they were made, showing no trace of
usage. They have been drilled apparently with a hollow reed, and the
annular strie is frequently to be seen. Many specimens are found
partly made, then broken and rejected. These show that they had
been shaped approximately before the drilling commenced.

No. 84, of serpentine, is from Pennsylvania; 85, striped slate, from
Wisconsin; 86, striped slate, from Indiana; 87, striped slate, from Penn-
sylvania; 90, striped slate, from Indiana; 92, striped slate, from Indi.
diana; 88, bruwn jasper, from Louisiana; 91, translucent ferruginous
quartz, from Indiana.

Pierced tablets and boat-shaped articles.—These are mostly made of
slate, the greenish striped variety having been preferred. The tablets
are flat and thin; the holes may be drilled from one side or from both,
and are accordingly of a conical or biconical shape. They bear no
trace of usage. The same remarks apply to the boat-shaped articles,
except as to the difference in shape.

No. 127, slate, from New York; 128, slate, from Pennsylvania; 129,
from Louisiana; 130, 131, 132, slate, from Tennessee; 133, potstone,
from Pennsylvania; 134, striped slate, from Ohio; 135, greenstone,
from Kentucky.

Stone beads, pendants, and other ornaments.—Stone beads are found of
different forms and material. No. 200 is serpentine, from Santa Bar-
bara, California; Nos. 201 and 202 are of soapstone, from Pennsylvania;
204, catlinite, from New York; 203 is a straight tube nearly 3 inches
in length, from Mississippi, beautifully drilled with a small hole its
entire length. It is of a siliceous material resembling yellow jasper.
A manufactory of beads of this material was discovered in Lawrence
County, Miss., in the spring of 1876, and four hundred and forty-
nine specimens were sent to the Museum by Mr. T. J. R. Keenan. An

account of this find was given in Smithsonian Report for 1877, pages
293-298.
650 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Another specimen, 211, striped slate, from a mound in Ohio, muen
Jarger and longer, not drilled lengthwise, but diagonally across the
corners, may have served the same purpose of ornament, as likewise
212, which is of fine-grained argillaceous sandstone, from Kentucky.

the neck of a skeleton. :

Bird-shaped objects —Though this name has been given to numerous
relics from their general resemblance to birds, their shapes are so vari-
ous as to leave the design often uncertain. Some specimens more re-
semble the fence-lizard, and the eyes are frequently indicated by small,
round protuberances. The objects are generally of soft stone, such as

STONE BEADS, PENDANTS, AND OTHER ORNAMENTS.

No. 210 is striped slate from Pennsylvania. Small holes are drilled
from the bottom and end, respectively, diagonally so as to meet and

form a continuous hole. The purpose of these have been for a long
period unknown. A Chippewa Indian told me, in the Smithsonian In-
stitution, last summer, that they served for gaming. They were placed
in a pan or basket, which, being covered, was shaken and then set down
quietly, the cover removed, and an inspection would show how many
of the birds were seated upright. The player having the greatest num-
ber thus won the game.

Plummets and sinkers (Fig. 26).—These are analogous in name, and
possibly sometimes in appearance, to the pendants just described ; but
an examination of the real object in the number as possessed by the
Museum shows such differences as that they can not be classed together.
Taking the last numbers on Fig. 26 for first description, Nos. 111 and 113
are of quartzite, from Pennsylvania; 112 is of graywacke. from New
York. They are simply flat pebbles with notches chipped out on oppo-
site sides to receive a cord or thong. Another variety, but of the same
class, are pebbles more nearly round, which are still in their natural
state, but have been grooved around the circumference. No. 104 is
greenstone, from California ; 107, granite, from Rhode Island; 108, soap-
stone, from Georgia; one with two grooves at right angles is 109, taleose
slate, from Rhode Island ; while No. 110 is sandstone, from Oregon, and is
decorated with engraved lines. The latter may have served as an orna-
ment. These specimens show a substantially different purpose from
the gorgets or pendants (No. 205 et seq.), and it is alleged were used
as plummets or sinkers, but on that opinions differ. No. 107 may pos-
sibly have been used with a handle and served as a weapon. The
others, Nos. 100 to 105, are totally different from the pendants, and
have been manufactured into their present state. They are of hard
material, red or brown hematite, Jasper quartz, greenstone, etc., and
are made with grooves, knobs, or holes, apparently all for suspension.
Their form would indicate them to be plummets. They much resemble
the modern plummet, but their actual use is unknown. No. 100 is horn-
blende, from Ohio; 101, hematite, from Tennessee; 102 is from Arkan-
sas; 103, greenstone, from Ohio; 105 is quartzite from Massachusetts;
106, greenstone, from Massachusetts. This class are supposed to have
served as sinkers for the nets of prehistoric fishermen, but nothing
more is known with certainty than is indicated by their appearance.

Discoidal stones (Fig. 27).—These are supposed to have been used for
games among the Indians, probably in playing the game called ‘‘chung-
kee.” It resembles the modern game of quoits, except that the stones
are rolled on the ground instead of being pitched through theair. Some
of these discoidal stones measure 6 inches and more in diameter with a
regular dish-shaped cavity on each side. Their material is always hard
and is often ferruginous quartz. They are carefully made, evidently
with great labor; their outline is regular and true, and they have been
rubbed and polished smooth.

No. 116 is yellow-brown ferruginous quartz, from Tennessee; 117,
brown ferruginous quartz, from Tennessee; 118, dark greenstone, from
a mound in Illinois. In some specimens the cavities on the sides are
carried deeper than in others, and their center marked by a perforation.
Nos. 119 and 120 are quartzite, from Ohio. Other specimens are with-
out the dish-like cavity. No. 121 is quartzite, from Georgia. Some
specimens, similar in every other appearance, are diminutive, scarcely
more than an inch in diameter. No. 122 is argillite, from Pennsylvania;
and curious to remark, relics presenting the same appearance have
been made of broken clay vessels, which, except the hole, resemble the
spindlewhorl. The writer found a specimen of this kind in a prehistoric
workshop in Brittany, France. It has been suggested that they were
used as paint cups, and possibly this may be true.

DISCOIDAL STONES (3).

When in Italy I remarked a game which had a great similarity to
the chungkee of the Indians. In 1889 I wrote to my friend, R. Mancini,
for a description, which he gave in the following :

LETTER FROM R. MANCINI, ORVIETO, ITALY, TO MR. WILSON.

The play, made by rolling discs at a mark, which you saw in one of the streets out-
side the city of Orvieto, has several names. It is called Ruzzola, or Ruzzoletta when
played by the children with small dises; but if the play be by adults and with large
discs it is called Ruzzolone, or sometimes Giuoco del Formaggio, or Play of the
Cheese, because when played by the peasants or shepherds they use their dises of
655

cheese, betting one cheese against another. It is usually played by two persons,
but may be by four. They divide themselves into opposite parties, and each one
alternately throws the cheese or the disc, rolling it on its periphery at the distant
mark or peg.

The discs are generally of hard wood. Sometimes the children, for economy, make
them of terra-cotta, and also sometimes, but rarely, of stone. The small discs are
from 7 to 12 centimeters in diameter, while the large ones are from 18 to 20 centime-
ters.

‘The following are the principal rules of the game:

Choice is made by ‘‘odd and even” as to which party shall have the first play.
The line or point of departure is fixed by consent, and here the player stands to roll
his disc. The goal or mark for its arrival is also fixed, and he whose discs rest near-
est the mark or line is declared the victor.

This play dates from high antiquity, and is believed to be the modern repetition
of the ancient classic game made known generally by the antique statue of Discob-
olus.

In excavating the ancient tombs I have found terra-cotta discs placed as covers for
amphora in crematory burials, but which appeared to have been first used as dis-
cobolo.

Perforated stones—club-heads or riatta.—The discoidal stones of the
perforated kind pass by degrees into the ring form, a type exemplified

by a large number of specimens from southern California. Their mate-
rial is sandstone, serpentine, soapstone, etc., though occasional speci-
mens have appeared of a harder material like greenstone. They vary
much in size and character. They are from 14 inches in diameter
to 5 inches and more. Some are only half an inch in thickness,
while others are so thick as to equal their diameter, almost forming a
globe. Some are pear-shaped; others, with the globular form like No.
125, have their holes drilled the same size all through. They are ocea-
sionally decorated, and may have served as heads for a club or staff.
Specimens with a staff 5 feet long have been found in California and
Mexico, and also in New Zealand.

No. 124 is hornblende, from Santa Catalina Island; 125 greenstone,
and 126 serpentine, from Santa Rosa Island, California.

Evidences of usage are to be seen in specimens resembling 124, 126,
and similar objects are used in Mexico called riattas. A lariat is passed
through the hole in the stone and stretched, and is polished and
smoothed by the stone rubbing back and forth.

CUTTING-TOOLS, SCRAPER AND SPADE-LIKE IMPLEMENTS.

Cutting tools.—No. 93 is of black slate, from Pennsylvania; 94, hard
red shale, from Pennsylvania; 95, from Indiana. Implements similar
to these are used on the northwest coast for opening fish. (Fig. 29.)

Scraper and spade-like implements.—These have been classed as axes,
but an examination shows them more likely to have served as scrapers
or spades. They are of large size, hard material, and scarcely enough
examples have been found to establish them as a class. They are pos-
sibly abnormal specimens. No. 96 is greenstone, from Kentucky; 97,
from Arkansas; 98 and 99, from South Carolina.

STONE VESSELS FOR CARRYING OR HOLDING LIQUIDS—COOKING AND
GRINDING UTENSILS.

Vessels like a pot or platter were made and used by the aborigines.
East of the Rocky Mountains they were made of soapstone; while on
the western side the material used was much harder. Soapstone quar-
ries have been found in many parts of the United States where these
utensils had been manufactured by the prehistoric man. Uncompleted
vessels and those in fragments are frequently found. They were many
times made of a size and depth sufticient to hold, and if need be cook,

There is a class of small conoid-shaped mullers made of hematite, which may have
been used for rubbing paints (No. 174, greenstone, Ohio).

ROCK SCULPTURES OR PICTOGRAPHNS.

These represent sometimes human, sometimes animal, forms, and
sometimes forms which can not be identified. They may have been
made by scratching, pecking, or cutting. Occasionally they are coiored.
The figures are often large and complicated, and could only have been
produced by long-continued labor, which, from their position (many
times on naked rocks, high up on a precipice), was not unaccompanied
‘by danger. Their position should be noted by the observer; when pos-
sible, sketches should be made and the discovery reported to the Smith-
sonian Institution.

They, like the rock-sculpturing, are distributed almost over the en-

on the face of the rocks in the Himalaya Mountains. They have been

on the stones composing the megalithic monuments of prehistoric man,
where the cavities are often polished smooth. They are numerous in
Scotland and England on pebbles or small bowlders, and equally so in

the United States. They are found in abundance in Ohio. Their use
or purpose is entirely unknown. The subject forms an interesting
study. Dr. Rau published an interesting monograph thereon, entitled,
‘Observations on Cup-shaped and other Lapidarian Seulptures,” con-
tributions to North American Ethnology, vol. v, ete. He inclines to
give them a religious rather than a utilitarian character.

PIPES AND SMOKING TUBES.

No class of aboriginal productions of art exhibit a greater diversity
of form than do the pipes of the prehistoric man of North America.

STONE PIPEs.
A STUDY OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 663

They are chiefly carved from stone, but not unfrequently were molded
in clay.

Messrs. Squier and Davis, in their explorations of mounds in Ohio,
discovered many curious and interesting types. They were supposed
at one time to have been made of hard stone, a kind of porphyry, but
later examinations and scientific analyses have shown them to be of
softer materials, composed of slaty and calcareous minerals.

Nos. 177 to 184 represent types of those found by Squier and Davis.

from Ohio; 190, from Virginia; 191, serpentine, from New York; 192,
steatite, from Pennsylvania, highly polished, representing a lizard;
193, soapstone, from North Carolina; 194 is from Texas; 195 from a
mound in Kentucky. The latter is of compact limestone, and evidently
of high antiquity. Its form is somewhat peculiar, in that it is the fav-
orite among those who manufactured pipes from the catlinite or red
pipestone, aud has been continued into recent times. No. 196 is from
Georgia; Nos. 198, 199 are made of clay, aud were both found in Mad-
ison County, New York.

Stone pipes of entirely different character are found in California.
They are represented by No. 197, of serpentine, from Santa Barbara
County. These were in the form of tubes of various sizes and lengths,
some of which are very large. Specimens have been found with a
piece of bone inserted in the tapering end and cemented with bitumen
for use as a mouth-piece, after the fashion in amber at the present day.

Allied in appearance to the California pipes are tubes which may
have served as pipes, though neither in the instrument nor in the hole
drilled therein is there apparently any provision for insertion in the
mouth. The hole through the tube is sometimes biconical, having
been drilled from both ends, and is smaller in the center, but quite too
large at either end for the mouth. It has been suggested that these
wide-mouthed pipes might have had two reeds inserted, which, being -
cemented with bitumen, were smoked through the nose. The smoke
would thus be inhaled into the lungs, and so have a more powerful in-
toxicating effect. This, if true, might account for the small size of the
bowl in many Indian pipes, a smaller quantity of tobacco being re-
quired in this than in the usual mode of smoking.

The material was soapstone, slate, and chlorite. Nos. 175 and 176

The name ‘‘calumet pipes” has been given to those of large size
smoked with a stem and representing usually a bird, animal, and some-
times a human figure. They are thus called by the Indians on account
of their bulk and their use on occasions of great ceremony. |

No. 185 is one of the finest possessed by the Museum, and is from
Kentucky.

BONE IMELEMENTS.

The adoption of bone instead of stone for the implements of the pre-
historic man differed widely in different countries. It is diffienlt to
give satisfactory reasons therefor. It has been said that bone imple-
ments were not made in the United States, because the stone was so
easily obtained. But in France, where bone implements are in greatest
profusion, the flint suitable for chipping, and of which the finest imple-
ments could be and were made, was to be found, and is still very abun-
dant. Bone, horn, and ivory were tised indiscriminately, and served.
‘according to the need, as perforators, points, harpoons, fish-hooks, ete,
They were often drilled, and so formed objects of suspension, ornaments,
ete. Hollow bones might serve as tubes. They might be also sawed to
serve as rings or beads of varying size and length. One of the most
interesting varieties of implements in bone are those found almost only
at the prehistoric cemetery at Madisonville, Ohio, by Dr. Metz and Mr.
Low. Any discoveries made, information obtained, or specimens
found of scientific interest should be reported. (Fig. 39.)

COPPER IMPLEMENTS AND ORNAMENTS.

Implements and ornaments of this metal are shown in figure 40.
They need not be described; their appearance will be sufficient. The
remarks concerning the fraudulent character of some specimens sought
to be foisted upon museums and collectors, and the necessity for the
greatest care concerning the preservation of proofs and of genuineness,
apply with even greater force to copper implements than to those of stone.

HUMAN REPRESENTATIONS.

Occasionally, though rarely, specimens of sculpture representing
the human face or figure have been found in the United States. Those
represented in the cuts are mostly from Mexico, but they will serve as
illustrations. In consequence of their rarity and the superior art dis-
played, they have been much sought, and these with representations of

finder of such a specimen should take every means possible, by the call-
ing of witnesses, identification of the precise locality, the preservation,
if possible, of the matrix or bed in which it is found, and by any other
means, to preserve the evidences of its authenticity and genuineness.

670 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

The various shells of the rivers and ocean furnished a material of
great value to prehistoric man, and one which he could without much
labor apply to a variety of uses. Small shells were perforated and
used as beads; others were cut from the clam and mussel shells, which
furnished the wampum. The haliotis was ground from the back and
center so as to form bracelets. The same ornament made in the same
way has been found in great numbers by the brothers Siret in their
late discovery in southeastern Spain. The most interesting, as well as
artistic, of the ornaments made from shell are the gorgets, which are
especially noticeable for their engravings. They are sometimes cut so
as to represent, upon the outside, a human face, but many have been
found beautifully engraved in elaborate designs much resembling the
mythologic art of Mexico and Central America. Ne. 272, found in Ten-
nessee, represents one of these.

POTTERY.

The prehistoric pottery of Mexico and Central America forms a spe-
cial group; that from the Pueblos of Arizona and New Mexico, another;
while that made by the North American Indian constitutes a third
group. Each of these has distinctive characteristics.

The pottery of the North American Indian is in some respects like
the dolmen pottery of Europe, although it differs in many details of
form, mode of manufacture and ornamentation. The North American
Indian used neither wheel nor furnace, nor did he, except rarely, deco-
rate it with colors. The clay was frequently mixed with pounded
shells. The decoration of pottery made in the eastern portion of the
United States was effected by incised lines and dots, with various com-
binations. The spiral and volute were employed. Among the Southern
Indians much of the decoration was made by the impress of textile fab-
rics, sometimes with only a string or cord. In the interior, and princi-
pally on the Mississippi River, the pottery vessels were made to rep-
resent sometimes the human form, sometimes animals. There was a
much greater prevalence of the bottle-form in the United States than
in Kurope.

Prof. W. H. Holmes, of the Bureau of Hthnology, has written an in-
teresting monograph upon aboriginal pottery in the United States, and
the late Col. James Stevenson described the Zuni and Pueblo pottery.
Both these papers have been published in the Reports of the Bureau of
Ethnology, and are profusely and elegantly illustrated.

ANCIENT INDIAN MATTING—FROM PETIT ANSE ISLAND, LOUISIANA,

By Tuomas WILSON.

In the hall devoted to the collections of prehistoric anthropology in
the U.S. National Museum there isexhibited a mat of interlaced or woven
reed or cane which has been claimed, by reason of its locality, condi-
tion, and association, to be evidence of the great antiquity of man, and
as tending to establish his existence during the tertiary geologic period,*
Plate CVII.

The label affixed to this specimen tells its whole story.

Specimen of ancient matting from Petit Anse Island, near Vermilion Bay, Coast of”
Louisiana. Presented to the Smithsonian Institution by J. F. Cleu, esq., May, 1866.
“Petit Anse Island” is the locality of the remarkable mine of salt rock discovered
during the late rebellion, and from which, for a considerable period of time, the
Southern States derived a great part of their supply of this article. The salt is
almost chemically pure, and apparently inexhaustive in quantity, occuring in every
part of the island (which is about 5,000 acres in extent) at a depth below the surface
of the soil of 15 or 20 feet.

The fragment of matting here exhibited was found near the surface of the salt
and about 2 feet above it were the remains of tusks and bones of a fossil eleyhant.
The peculiar interest in regard to the specimen is in its occurrence in situ 2 feet below
the elephant remains, and about 14 feet below the surface of the soil, thus showing
the existence of man on the island prior to the deposit in the soil of the fossil elephant.
The material consists of the outer bark of the common southern cane (drundinaria
macrosperma), and has been preserved for so long a period both by its silicious char-
acter and the strongly saline condition of the soil.

The letter of transmission accompanying this specimen is from Mr.
Cleu, dated New Orleans, May 10, 1866. It forms the basis of the
label. He sends specimens of the rock salt, pieces of the fossil bones,
and tusk of the elephant, and then says:

Below the fossil of the elephant, near the salt, we found pieces of matting made
of the enamel of the canes. That work was beautiful and well preserved. It tastes
salty and looks as if it had been made a few weeks ago. If I had not taken them up
myself I could not believe it possible that they were found where I have stated;
many more will be found but more carefully dug up. We have bought the mines
and nearly the whole island, and intend to go in operation on a large scale, ete.

An inspection of this specimen caused me to suspect its antiquity.
When I remarked the small and thin strips of the substance and its
fragility and compared them mentally with other objects of the same
reputed age, as, for example, the fossil mastodon teeth and bones which

674 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

were found overlying it, and saw the effect of time upon them [ became
more than ever dubious of the high antiquity claimed for this matting.
I submitted it to Professor Mason, who has made aspecial study of the
basket-makers of antiquity.* He pronounced it at once to be a speci-
men of the common basket work of the Southern Indian, probably
Cherokee. As to its actual antiquity he could give no opinion. Those
Indians had made such plaited work ever since our earliest knowledge
of them, and still continne it. He said one could purchase at the
present day in the market at New Orleans modern Indian baskets of
the same work and in every way similar.

An examination of the record of the Smithsonian Institution devel.
oped the following facts bearing upon the subject of the antiquity of
this specimen:

In the summer of 1866, not long after the receipt of this specimen of
matting from Mr. Cleu, Professor Henry, Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, directed, or requested, Prof. E. H. Hilgard to undertake a
geologic examination of the Louisiana salt region, the particular out-
cropping of which had been discovered in May, 1862, on this island of
Petit Anse. Professor Hilgard availed himself of all former publica-
tions, interested numerous scientific gentlemen with him, and made an
extensive geologic investigation, commencing at Vicksburg and extend-
ing down the Mississippi to its mouth, thence west up the Gulf coast
to Vermilion Bay, and finishing with the five islands located therein,
one of which was Petit Anse. The results of his investigations are pub-
lished in the Smithsonian “Contributions to Knowledge,” Vol. XXIII,
and is No. 248 of the regular series. Of his conclusions as to the geologic
formation of this country, or of this island, it is unnecessary to speak.
He does not mention or refer in any manner to the discovery of this
piece of basketry, which had been presented to the Museum only in the
May previous to his detail, and which one may suppose contributed
somewhat to the necessity for his investigation. The following para-
graph from his report, however, bears upon the subject (page 14). He
Says:

Up to the time of Dr. Goessmann’s visit (in November, 1866) all the borings and
p'ts which had reached the salt had been sunk in detrital material washed down
from the surrounding hills, and frequ ntly inclosing the v stiges of both animal and
human visits to the spot. Mastodon buffalo, deer, and other bones; Indian hatchets,
arrow-heads, aud rush baskets, but above all an incredible quantity of pottery frag-
ments which have been extracted from the pits. The pottery fragments form at
some points veritable strata 3 to 6 inches thick; this is especially the case where Mr.
Dudley M. Avery found what appeared to have been a furnace for baking the ware
(a process very imperfectly performed), and near it three pots of successive sizes,
inside of each other. The pots must be presumed to have subserved the purpose of
salt-boiling; for although human handiwork has been found so close to the surface
of the salt as to render it probable that its existence in mass was once known, yet the

boiling process alone has been resorted to within even traditional times until the
discovery, at the bottom of a salt well, of the solid rock-salt.

ANCIENT INDIAN MATTING.

From Petit Anse Island, near Vermillion Bay, Louisiana. Presented by J.F. Cleu, 1866. (Cat. No.
1133, U. S. N. M.)
ANCIENT INDIAN MATTING. 615

With a foot-note thus:

It is very positively stated that mastodon bones were found considerably above
some of the human relics. In a detrital mass, however, this can not be considered a
crucial test.

The discovery or finding of this piece of matting by Mr. Cleu in the
position indicated, to wit, above the rock-salt, but beneath the fossil
bones, tusks, etc., of the elephant or mastodon may be conceded. There
seems to have been nothing strange or suspicious in such a discovery.
But finding it in the detrital mass, as reported by Professor Hilgard,
robs it of all weight as evidence of the antiquity of man. The surface
or top of the solid body of rock-salt appears to have been somewhat
irregular, to have conformed generally to the surface of the earth above
it, to have been at a depth of about 15 feet, to have been principally
under the line of high-tide water, though at one place it appeared above.
The island is quite small, nearly round, with an area of 2,240 acres, and
dotted over with hills, the highest being 180 feet. From this descrip-
tion it can be easily understood, as Professor Hilgard says, that a
‘(detrital material was washed down from surrounding hills and fre-
quently inclosing the vestiges of both animal and human visits to the
spot.” Mr. Cleu says that many more of these pieces of matting will
be found, ete.

In the light of these examinations the position of this matting is ex-
plained, and we see that it has no bearing upon the question of the
antiquity of man. The same claim would apply with equal propriety
to the buffalo, deer, and other bones, to the Indian hatchets and arrow-
heads, and to the incredible quantity of pottery fragments found by
Professor Hilgard. These, together with the matting and the fossil
mastodon bones and tusks, have all been washed down from the sur-
rounding hills and swept back and forth, in no one knows how many
relative changes of position, by each recurring tide. The matting being
found under the mastodon fossils in the detrital mass is no evidence
that this was their original position or that the deposition of both may
not have belonged entirely to modern times.
RESULTS OF AN INQUIRY AS TO THE EXISTENCE OF MAN IN NORTH
AMERICA DURING THE PALEOLITHIC PERIOD OF THE STONE AGE,

By THOMAS WILSON.

The existence and the antiquity of the paleolithic period in Europe
had been so well established by the investigations of Huropean pre-
historic anthropologists as to neither require demonstration nor admit
of discussion.

The prehistoric people of North America, as they have been generally
known, whether mound-builders or Indians, all belonged to the neo-
lithic period of the stone age, unless there is to be established an age
of copper.

Their cutting implements of stone were not brought to an edge by
chipping as was done in the paleolithic period, nor were these impli ments
chipped in the sense of the term as used in connection with that period.
Ou the contrary, they were polished or made smooth by rubbing against
or upon another stone. Their cutting edges were made sharp in the
same way. This was a new invention, and constituted the distinctive
mark between the civilization of the two periods. The peoples of the
neolithic period had much the higher civilization. They made pottery,
had flocks and herds, a knowledge of agriculture, a society organized
into tribes or bands, buried their dead with ceremony, mourned their
loss, and erected burial monuments.

They were numerous in North America, and spread over or occupied,
at one time or another nearly, if not quite, the entire continent; their
tribes were many, they employed differeit languages, made and used a
variety of curious implements, and their monuments are yet a source
of wonder and surprise. These things have rendered the mine of eth-
nologic lore in America so rich and with such great opportunities, that
the attention of the anthropologist and ethnologist of our country have
been fully absorbed and left with but little incentive to investigate
that ruder but earlier period—the paleolithic.

My attention has been turned towards this period, and I determined
to give it a share of that consideration to which I felt it was entitled.
I make but small claim to original discovery; most of my facts have
been heretofore known, but they were isolated, disconnected, unrecog-

filled the gaps with new facts, formulated all, and hope I have estab-
lished their bearing one upon another, and thus proved (to my own
satisfaction, at least) the general occupation of the United States by
man during the paleolithic period. Other persons have heretofore ex-
pressed their belief in this proposition, but as yet it has not been
proved. The evidence which they presented may have been good, but
it was insufficient.

Many years ago Signor Capellini, rector of the University of Bologna,
visited the United States, and reported having found at Burlington,
Iowa, a paleolithic implement of white flint.*

Professor Joseph Leidy, in 1873, reported having found paleolithice im-
plements in flint, jasper, and quartzite at or near Fort Bridger,
W yoming.t

Professor Leidy says:

‘Tn some places the stone implements are so numerous, and at the same time so rudely
constructed, that one is constantly in doubt when to consider them as natural or
accidental and when to view them as artificial. Some of the plains are so thickly
strewn with natural and artificial splintered stones that they look as if they had
been the battle-fields of great armies during the stone age.”

But Dr. Leidy did not know these implements to be what they really
were, that is, implements of the paleolithic period. His friend Dr. Van
A. Carter, residing at Fort Bridger, and well acquainted with the lan-
guage, history, manners, and customs of the neighboring tribes of
Indians, informed him that they knew nothing about these implements.
He reported that the Shoshones looked upon them as the gift of God to
their ancestors.

The discovery by Dr. Abbott of paleolithic implements in the gravel
drift of the Delaware River at Trenton was the leading discovery which
bore testimony to the existence of man in America during the paleo-
lithic period. His discovery was valuable, and no doubt is to be thrown
upon the genuineness of the implements. They tend to prove as well
the antiquity as the existence of the paleolithic period in America,
By this discovery Trenton occupies much the same relation to American
prehistoric anthropology that Abbeville does to European.

Less known, but believed to be equally authentic, was the discovery
of paleolithic implements by Miss Frane E. Babbitt in 1879 at Little
Falls, Minnesota; by Dr. Metz, in the river gravel of the Little Miami
at Loveland, near Cincinnati; by Professor McGee of a possibly paleo-
lithic spear-head of obsidian in the valley of Lake Lahontan in north-
western Nevada; by Dr. Hilborn T. Cresson, of Philadelphia, at Clay-
mont, Delaware, and Upland, Chester County, Pennsylvania, and of a
supposed paleolithic fire-place or hearth, explained by Prof. G. K.
Gilbert.

Conceding for these finds of paleolithic implements full authenticity,

they oniy show an isolated and widely scattered occupation by man
during the paleolithic period. They are far from showing a general
occupation as has been established in southern and western Europe.
If the occupation shown by these finds was truly that of the paleolithic
man I could not bring myself to believe that it was restricted in this
way, and I thought that his implements should be found elsewhere.
This was needed to establish a general occupation, and a general occu-
pation must be established before the scientific world would accept the
fact as proved.

Myresidencein Europeand my acquaintance with European prehistoric
anthropology, especially that portion relating to the paleolithice period,
caused me to be deeply interestedin the question of the existence of man
during a like period in America, and I began my investigations immedi-
ately uponmyreturn. Ifoundin the Museum many objects labeled ‘Rude
and Unfinished Implements of the Paleolithic Type,” and I queried
whether they were not truly paleolithic. I was answered in the nega-
tive, and it was said that they were but the unfinished implements of
the Indians; in fact, his failures when making the more finished and
perfect implements. And it was further said that they were always
found in connection, and associated with the more perfect implement.
While it was not said that they could not be found under the surface
or in gravels, yet it was declared that they had not been so found; on
- the contrary, all had come from the surface. The argument did not
satisfy me, and I pushed my investigations and comparisons. I dis-
covered that certain of the implements displayed in the Museum under
the name aforesaid, had been found by Mr. E. P. Upham, my assistant,
in times past on the hills around the city of Washington, chiefly those
of Piney Branch and Rock Creek. Guided by him I visited the neigh-
borhood and our searches were crowned with such success that in the
first afternoon we found a greater number than we could carry home.
I have since visited the same places in company with several scientific
gentlemen of the Geological Survey, Professors Gilbert, McGee,
Holines, Henshaw, and Mr. DeLancey Gill, whose knowledge and ex-
perience were of great benefit. We were aided by Mr. 8S. V. Proudfit
and Mr. E. R. Reynolds, who have pushed their explorations on the
Eastern Brauch of the Potomac and in the vicinity of the Chain Bridge.
These rude implements were found every where in profusion.

Comparison is as good a rule of evidence in archeology as in law. If
applied it by comparing these unknown and unrecognized implements
with those from foreign countries which were recognized and admitted
as genuine implements made by man during the paleolithie period in
those countries, and as representatives of its civilization. The result
was not less surprising than gratifying. My examination proved to me
that, though coming from lands however distant, from other continents
separated from ours by wide oceans, these were all the same imple-
ments. Their identity was complete. Both showed the handiwork of
680 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

man, and were undeniably manufactured for the same purpose and
representing the same civilization or culture. An examination and
comparison of the implements themselves are necessary in order to un-
derstand the full force of these statements.

The remarks of Dr. Leidy as to the great number of these implements
which he found in the Bridger basin apply with equal force to the bluffs
and hills around the city of Washington. The reports of these imple-
ments in the Museum. from the District of Columbia, are as follows:

Extending these investigations over the United States, Professor
Langley, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, at the instance
of this Department, issued in January, 1888, Circular No. 36, already
mentioned, and of which the following is a copy:

CIRCULAR CONCERNING THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTIQUITIES.

The Smithsonian Institution desires answers to the following questions concerning
that class of American aboriginal stone relics which have been heretofore denomi-
nated ‘‘rude or unfinished implements of the paleolithic type.”

Cuts of some, together with their localities, are herewith given.

Question 1. How many of these rude stone implements have you in your collection ?
Question 2. Do you know of any in other museums or collections?
Question 3. Of what material are they made?
Question 4. Where have they been found ?
(1) As to locality.
(2) Position, condition, and associated with what objects.
(3) Whether on or under the surface, and if so, at what depth, and in what kind
of geologic formation.
(4) Were they found in mounds, tombs, or other ancient structures.
(5) Were any other ancient implements found with them, and if so, of what kind.
(6) Did their deposit seem to be accidental or intentional.
(7) Have they been described in any publication, and if so,in what, and where
ean it be obtained.
(8) Can you forward specimens (as many as possible) to this Museum in exchange
for publications or duplicate specimens.

The Museum received two hundred and nine responses. . The number
of implements reported by the correspondents from twenty-three States
and Territories is six thousand seven hundred and sixty-two, but
twenty-eight persons report an indefinite number in their collections
which is incapable of addition: **A few,” “some,” ‘“ many,” ‘“ plenty,”
“hundreds,” ‘‘a large number,” etc. These have not been counted into
this aggregate. Thirty-three persons sent one thousand one hundred
and eighty-nine of the ‘rude implements” for which they all received
an equivalent in exchange. The objects actually received from those
thirty-three persons were nearly double the number mentioned. Those

THE PALEOLITHIC PERIOD OF THE STONE AGE. 687

In the science of prehistoric anthropology almost the sole means of
study are the implements and monuments made and used by prehistoric
man. To render this study available it becomes of prime importance
that we should know not only the locality of the implement or object
studied, but also its position, condition, and relation to other objects
with which it may be found associated. It is coming to be recognized

.as the duty of every discoverer, if he would make his find of any value,
to note carefully its condition, position, and association with other ob-
jects. His failure to do this destroys its principal value.

I have endeavored during the past year to secure such a description
of all specimens received. The official catalogues of the Museum are
furnished to us with their numbers completed, one line only to each
number, and this is subdivided so as to give name, date, locality, donor,
etc., which, with the official number, fills the line. It is manifestly im-
possible to give in this catalogue the description needed to make the
specimen appreciated or valued. It is almost, if not quite, as imprac-
ticable to give the specimen its proper value if all the information
concerning its discovery is allowed to lie in the registrar’s files and to
be found only there. Therefore I have briefed all letters giving such
information concerning the specimens received, putting it in the most
concise form possible, which | transmit with this report, to the end that
they may be printed with it and so be made accessible to the student,
to the public, and to the office.

The following are briefs of these letters. The type Solutreen men-
tioned refers to leaf-shaped implements, which would in Europe be
classed as paleolithic. Whether they are to be so classed in America
awaits future investigation. The other paleolithic implements, usually
unmentioned in the brief, refer to Chellian implements which are not
considered doubtful :

C. M. Sawyer, Mechanics’ Falls, Maine, April 2, 1888. Sends sixteen specimens, seven
of which are paleolithic (type Solutreen). Material, jasper. Found on the surface
of the shores of Sebago Lake and at Raymond, Cumberland County, Maine. Ac-
cession 20446 ; catalogue Nos. 137593-137606.

Prof. G. H. Perkins, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, February 15, 1838.
Has many rude implements. Material, bluish-gray quartzite, argillite, hornstone,
and some of granite. Found on the surface near streams. Deposit accidental.
Sends forty-six specimens, eighteen of which are paleolithic, Accession 20554; cata-
logue No. 139429.

ABSTRACT OF LETTERS RECEIVED IN ANSWER TO CIRCULAR 36.

Albert I. Phelps, Damariscotta, Maine, February 14, 1838. Has fifteen rude imple-
ments. Material, feldspar and porphyry. Found at Revere, Massachusetts, (surface)
Penaquid Pond Damariscotta, Maine, and from shell-heap at Friendship, Maine.
The implements from Revere were associated with arrow-points, those from Penaquid
Pond with rude arrow-points, scrapers, and fragments of pottery, those from the
shell-heaps with flakes, arrow-points, bone implements, and fragments of pottery.

George A. Boardman, Calais, Maine, February 9, 1888. Has no rude implements.

James E. Knowlton, Damariscotta, Maine, May 5, 1888. Has one hundred and
forty-four rude implements of porphyry, jasper, quartz, etc.; found in Lincoln and
Knox Counties, on the coast between Kennebec and George Rivers, and on borders
of lakes and rivers further inland, also in and beneath shell-heaps and associated
with the usual fragments and implements. Sends seventeen specimens from Lincoln
County, Maine. These belong to the shell-heaps, and may not be paleolithic. Acces-
sion 20612; catalogue Nos. 139448-139461.

‘« The shell-heaps in this region may be divided into two classes—the recent and
ancient. The recent shell-heaps contain objects of European make associated with
the implements of the stone age, and the rude pottery in these heaps has pounded
shells mixed in with the clay. Shell-heaps of this class where undisturbed are ar-
ranged in small mounds resembling cradle knolls and are not over three feet deep.
The shell-heaps of the older period vary in depth from three inches to thirty feet.
The pottery contained in them has gravel, pounded rock, or mica, mixed in with the
clay ; it breaks with a shelly fracture, and was made inside a closely woven basket,
while that in the recent heap breaks with a spiral fracture indicating that the coil-
method was employed in manufacturing it, although most of it, like that from the
older heaps, plainly shows the basket marks. With one exception objects of Euro-
pean make have never been found in the heaps of this class. Around and beneath
the shallow heaps is a black stratum formed of ashes and decomposed animal and
vegetable matter, while the deeper heaps are irregularly stratified from top to bottom.
Animal bones, pottery, amd implements are more frequently found in these strata
than in the shells. The decaying of the branches used by the savages as bedding,
the rubbish accumulating around a savage habitation, and finally the decaying of
the habitations themselves have, I believe, contributed largely to the formation of
these strata in and about the shell-heaps.”

A. T. Gamage, Damariscotta, Maine, February 28, 1888. Sent five rude implements,
Material, black horustone and quartz. Found in shell-heaps at McFarland’s Cove,
on John’s Bay in the town of Bristol, on the coast 1 to 6 feet deep, with other stone
implements and pottery. Deposit accidental. Also one water-worn implement found
on the beach near shell-heap. He has explored the shell-heaps of the county, and
THE PALEOLITHIC PERIOD OF THE STONE AGE. 693

found more of these kind of implements than perfect ones. He has never found any
stone tools in or near the shell-heaps that he thought were deposited or buried with
human remains, but Mr. Phelps and himself took from a deposit, which was found
four miles from the salt water, about one hundred and fifty stone tools of different
kinds, all perfect and some very nicely finished. They were mostly celts and spear-
heads. Of the five rude implements which he sent four are paleolithic. Accession
20251; catalogue Nos. 139151, 139152.

Aug. C. Hamlin, Bangor, Maine, February 18, 1888. Has no rude implements and
knows of none. Thinks he has seen a few similar, but believes them to haye been
of recent date.

J. L. M. Willis, Eliot, Maine, February 16, 1888. Has five rude implements. One
from New Jersey, two from North Carolina, and two from Newbury, Massachusetts.
(One of argillite, two of quartz, two of fine granite.)

line drawings. Nos. 1 and 3 are flint found on the surface at Fairfield, Indiana. No.
2 is a dark flint found on the surface in Tennessee. No. 4 is of brown flint found on
the surface near a mound in Illinois. No. 5 is white quartzite found on the surface
near a system of earch-works in Missouri. Other relics were found in close proximity.
No. 6 is a fragment of a polished implement of porphyritic stone found in a mound
in Fairfield, Indiana, associated with arrow and spear-points, and stone ornaments.

John M. Currier, Newport, Vermont, February 8, 1888. He has gathered these im-
plements in Castleton, Monkton, New Haven, and Lincoln, in Vermont. Nearly alt
have been donated to the University of Vermont, Vermont Historical Society, and to
the Smithsonian Institution. Material, Hudson River limestone, quartzite, and
jasper. Those of gray quartzite are the most common, next the Hudson River lime-
stone, and black marble. They are found on the surface. Has found some from
one-half to six inches in diameter.

Prof. Henry W. Haynes, 239 Beacon street, Boston, Massachusetts, February 15»
1888. Has a collection of paleolithic implements; 23 from Trentou, New Jersey (five
his own find), Dr. Abbott; 2 from Allentown, Pennsylvania (A. F. Berlin), quartzite;
1 from Millbank, Tennessee (A. F. Berlin); 16 from Little Falls, Minnesota (Miss
Babbitt), quartz; 10 from eastern Massachusetts (his own find), white quartz; 10
from northern New Hampshire (his own find), white quartz; 1 from Bar Harbor,
Maine (his own find), white quartz; 1 from Perkins County, Georgia (his own find),
white quartz; 30 from Wakefield, Massachusetts (his own find), brown felsite; 20
from eastern Massachusetts (his own find), brown felsite; 25 from Moosehead Lake,
Maine (his own find) green felsite, speckled with white quartz; 4 from Plattsburgh,
New York (Dr. D. 8. Kellogg); 7 from Washington, District of Columbia (his own
find), yellow, quartzite; 1 from Saguenay, Lower Canada; 1 from Castine, Maine
(N. S. True), fine grain argillite; 10 from Burlington, Vermont (own: find), pink
quartzite; atotal of 162.

The green felsite speckled with white quartz, from Moosehead Lake (twenty-five
specimens), is the same material of which most of the Indian implements are made,
which he found in the shell-heaps in the southeastern part of Maine, at Frenchman’s
Bay and elsewhere. Has described his white quartz implements in Proc. Boston Soc.
Nat. Hist., February 1, 1852, vol. xx1, p. 382. Meny of these were found in “hard
pan” or glacial till, 3 or 4 feet below the surface, and where no Indian implement
could be found. But has found some associated with Indian implements. ‘Their
deposit seems to have been always accidental.

Professor Haynes, of Boston, read a paper, February 1, 1882, before
the Boston Society of Natural History, vol. xx1, page 382, in which he
reports the finding of similar implements in various localities in New
694. REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1888.

Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts. He enlarges (and very
properly to) upon his extended experience with the paleolithie imple-
ments of the world. He expresses, without hesitation or doubt, that
these implements were the intentional work of man; that they were not
made by, nor did they belong to the Indian of that country. He says,
page 385:

But no such traces of Indian occupation has the most painstaking investigation

revealed to me in many places where I have found the new types of rude implements
in considerable quantities.

Again, page 388:

It will be noticed that all of these rude and simple tools have been fabricated out
of the hardest, heaviest, toughest kinds of rocks that the region where they are found
can furnish. They are commonly made of white or milky quartz, or quartzite, felsite,
or of some very compact variety of syenite or granite. Often they have been fash-
ioned out of a pebble from the glacial drift, which still retains a portion of its original
surface or crust. This circumstance proves that they must necessarily be post-glacial
in date, whether they have been found deeply bedded in the earth or upon the sur-
face of ploughed fields.

Professor Haynes sums up his argument:

I infer the former existence in New England of a race of men different from and less
advanced than the Indians, because I have found in many localities, where none of
the ordinary traces of Indian occupation could be discovered, a large quantity of
stone implements of ruder types and coarser make than those habitually used by
them. Whether these are actual relics of primeval man, 7. e., of a race who lived
long anterior to the Indians, or whether they are the work of the degraded descendants
of an earlier people who had succumbed to the Indians, I do not undertake to pro-
nounce.

The difference between Professor Haynes and myself is that he is un-
willing to attribute these implements to a paleolithic period. He insists
that to be evidence of this the implements in question should be found
in the river gravels, or in a corresponding geologic stratum. I know
that in many countries where the existence of a paleolithic period is
undoubted, the implements (principally Chellian or of the earliest
epoch) have been found on the surface, and they are identified as such,
by comparison with others found in the river gravels. My experience
with these implements in the two continents justifies me in identifying
those found in America as belonging to the same stage of culture to
which the Chellian implement of France and England belonged, and,
consequently, enables me to call them paleolithic implements.

implements, principally of gray stone or trap rock, white quartz, jasper, and flint,
found on the banks of the Susquehanna River and in plowed fields in Pennsyl-
vania and Maryland, and in Florida on the banks of a lake, associated with arrow

dred of quartz or quartzite, found on the Eastern Branch Potomac River, District of

cache of twenty from Anne Arundel County. Ten feet away was another cache. One
cache of one hundred; one of twenty-six. All of the cache implements found near

Mem.—May not these belong to the prehistoric man who made the shell heaps?
There are believed to have been two epochs of prehistoric culture represented in the
kjoekenmoddings of Denmark. The shell heaps of America should be carefully ex-
amined for evidences of paleolithic man or for an earlier epoch than the neolithic
period.

WaLTER HoueH. An Eskimo Strike-a-light from Cape Bathurst, British America.

Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., x1, 1888, pp. 181, 184.

Reprinted in ‘‘Scientific American Supplement,” xxvut, No. 694, April 20, 1889.

This paper describes a very complete set of fire-making apparatus used by the Eskimo of
Cape Bathurst, a region lying hait way between the great groups of the east and the Alaskan
Eskimo. The ordinary processes of fire-making among the western Eskimo have been de-
scribed by Mr. Hough in an extended paper, published in this volume. The strike-a-light
herein described consists of a cylinder of pyrites, or sulphate of iron, a piece of flint, and a
little pouch of dried cedar bark, to serve as a tinder, the whole packed in a water-proof bag of
fur and arranged in the most convenient manner. The importance of this specimen lies in the
fact that it raises the question of the antiquity of this method of fire-making among the aborig-
ines of America.

General revision of the Pteropoda Gymnosomata, or naked Pteropods, for which water- color
drawings taken from life and alcoholic specimens of various species were furnished to the
Royal Museum of Natural History, Brussels, Belgium, for the use of M. Pelseneer. It should
be noted that by neglecting to use the drawings and depending on diagrams prepared from
specimens preserved in spirits, grave errors of form and proportion have been introduced into
the plates of this work. The wing-like processes which give the Pteropods their name, shrink
out of all proportion when immersed in alcohol. In the case of Pnewmodermon pacificum the
“wings” are 8.3" long by 6™™ wide in a specimen 16™™ jn length of body. In the plates
referred to, the measurements would be 4.2™ long and 3.1™™ wide. For this extraordinary
misconception the drawings, accurately made from life and furnished by the U.S. National
Museum, should not in any way be held responsible.

Twenty-three species of Porites and three of Synarwa are enumerated. Prof. J. D. Dana
described eighteen new species of Porites from the collections of the United States Exploring
Expedition of 1838-'42. Four of these are now referred to the genus Synarea Verrill. The

- type specimens of sixteen of Dana's species are now contained in the U. S. National Museum
and are included in this list. One new species, P. Brannervi, is described from Brazil. Notes
are given on P. astreoides, solida, clavaria, and fwreata, all of which are represented by large
series of specimens. The principal varieties of clavaria and furcata, and the cell structure of
Brannevi, are illustrated on the plates. )

represented in the U. 8. National Museum.

Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., X, 1887, pp. 440-449, Plates XXI1I-XxXVI.

Four species are described and figured, and brief diagnoses of each are also given. They
are as follows: Heliaster microbrachia Xantus, Cumingii Gray, helianthus Gray, and multira-
diata Gray. The types of Xantus’s species, microbrachia and Kubingii, described in 1860, are
preserved in the Museum. Recent collections from the Galapagos Islands contain two species
which are evidently those described by Gray, in 1840, from the same region (Cumingii and
multiradiata), but which have not since been observed by naturalists, Gray’s types haying
also disappeared. H. Kubingii of Xantus and A. multiradiata of Gray are shown to be iden-
tical.

RICHARD RATHBUN. Ocean Temperatures of the Eastern Coast of the United States,
with thirty-two charts.

The Fisheries and Fishery Industries of the United States, Section 111, 1887, pp. 155-177.

This report is based upon temperature observations taken twice daily at twenty-four light-
houses and light-vessels, more or less favorably located for ascertaining the ocean temperatures
along the coast, and covers the five years from 1881 to 1885, inclusive. Each station is repre-
sented by a graphic chart, on which the temperature of the surface water 1s plotted by curves
for each of the five years, and that of the air for two years (1881 and 1882), being reduced to ten-
day means. Seven charts relate to the surface isotherms derived from the same observations.
These are shown for every five degrees of temperature from 40° to 80° by yearly charts, and
ly one chart giving the mean results for the five years. One chart also exhibits the relations
between the air and surface isotherms. These charts were constructed to illustrate the influ-
ence of temperature upon the movements of the mackerel, menhaden, and other species of
migratory fishes.

classification, numeration, and nomenclature conform strictly with the ‘‘Check List of North
Ameiican Birds” recently published by the Americai Ornithologists’ Union. The geographical
limits of the worls also conform to those adopted by the Ametican Ornithologists’ Union; but
it has been deenied advisable, for the special benefit of observers or investigators along our
southern border, to include in the synopsis all Mexi¢an, Cuban, and Bahaman species of each
North American genus, and also, in the keys te the genera, additional Mexican genera. Spe-
cial exception to geographical limitation has been made in the case of the Petrels and Alba»

to occur in our Waters as an accidental visitor. The frontispiece is an excellent engraving

Gives, first, the result of an examination of the stomach contents of 522 sparrows, of which
92 only, or 17.6 per cent., contained any insects. These insects examined by the author showed
a large preponderance of innoxious or actually beneficial species. All are such as can be
readily picked up by the birds in their search for their more usual vegetable food. A review
of the literature is theu given, showing that the general results attained agree with the author’s
own conclusions. which are that the bird is not only useless, but actually ‘‘ destructive,” as
termed by Dr. Merriam, and is essentially graminivorous, not insectivorous. The paper con-
tains the substance of a communication made by the author to the Biological Society of Wash-
ington.
