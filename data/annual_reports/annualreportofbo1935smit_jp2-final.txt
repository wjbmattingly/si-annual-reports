REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

CG. ABBOT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1935

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith my report
showing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution
and the Government bureaus under its administrative charge during
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1935. The first 12 pages contain a
summary account of the affairs of the Institution, and appendixes
1 to 10 give more detailed reports of the operations of the National
Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the Freer Gallery of Art,
the Bureau of American Ethnology, the International Exchanges,
the National Zoological Park, the Astrophysical Observatory, the
Division of Radiation and Organisms, the Smithsonian Library,
and of the publications issued under the direction of the Institution.
On page 81 is the financial report of the executive committee of
the Board of Regents.

OUTSTANDING EVENTS

Despite the continued curtailment of funds available for the Insti-
tution’s work, notably the drastic reduction in appropriations for
printing the scientific series normally issued by the National Museum
and the Bureau of American Ethnology, marked progress has been
made along several lines. Study of periodicities in the weather,
related to similar periodicities found in the variation of the solar
radiation, has progressed to the point where test weather forecasts
have been made for 30 stations in the United States for the years
1934, 1935, and 1936. The forecasts for 1934 gave satisfactory agree-
ment with the actual weather conditions for about two-thirds of the
stations. Reductions of the solar observations for a year at the new
Mount St. Katherine station indicate that they will be quite as excel-
lent and numerous as those of the best Smithsonian station at Monte-
zuma, Chile. John A. Roebling has generously provided funds for
the continued occupation of Mount St. Katherine till 1988.

Special attention was given to the problem of the so-called Folsom
man, a people associated with the earliest known phase of aboriginal

1
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

American culture. In Colorado a Smithsonian expedition unearthed
for the first time a variety of implements belonging to that culture,
including many of the typical Folsom points. A number of these
implements were found in direct association with bones of an extinct
form of bison. Further work at this site was under way at the
close of the year.

An allotment of $680,000 from the Public Works Administration
was made for the erection of three much-needed buildings at the
National Zoological Park. The Walter Rathbone Bacon traveling
scholarship was awarded to Dr. Richard E. Blackwelder for an
intensive study of the staphylinid beetles of the West Indies. The
seventh award of the Langley Medal was made to Dr. Joseph S.
Ames, chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronau-
tics, for his outstanding work in connection with the scientific devel-
opment of aviation in America. In the Division of Radiation and
Organisms experiments were carried through relating to the growth
of tomato plants under controlled conditions of temperature, humid-
ity, and radiation; the growth of wheat out-of-doors with controlled
quantities of carbon dioxide; and the dependence of the growth of
wheat and of algae on the wave lengths of radiation.

Among the year’s publications may be mentioned Dr. Strong’s
account of the results of his archeological expedition to the Bay
Islands, Spanish Honduras; Dr. Roberts’ paper on his investiga-
tions of Folsom man; and the second in the Freer Gallery’s series
of Oriental Studies, “A Descriptive and Lllustrated Catalogue of
Miniature Paintings of the Jaina Kalpasitra as Executed in the Early
Western Indian Style ”, by W. Norman Brown, with 45 full-tone plates.

SUMMARY OF THE YEAR’S ACTIVITIES OF THE BRANCHES OF THE
INSTITUTION

National Museum.—The appropriations for the year totaled
$716,071, an increase of $61,200 over last year. New specimens
added to the collections numbered 296,468. These included an-
thropological material representing many of the North and South
American Indian tribes, large collections of natural-history speci-
mens resulting from field work in Brazil by Dr. Doris Cochran
and from a third Hancock expedition to the Galapagos Islands par-
ticipated in by Dr. W. L. Schmitt, biological specimens from Siam
and China sent by Dr. Hugh M. Smith and Dr. D. C. Graham, a
valuable collection of Paleozoic fossils presented by Edward N.
Hurlburt, of Rochester, N. Y., and nearly 50,000 plant specimens
from various sources. To the industrial series were added the motor-
less sailplane Falcon (1934), the cup presented to the winner of the
first Vanderbilt automobile race 30 years ago, several interesting
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 3

ship and locomotive models, and a complete Mergenthaler linotype
(no. 9). Field work, though greatly limited from lack of funds, was
carried on chiefly through the cooperation and generosity of out-
side individuals, through grants from the Smithsonian Institution,
and through assistance from the P. W. A. It will be described in
detail in the special report of the Museum in Appendix 1. Visitors
to the several Museum buildings during the year totaled 1,841,306.
Under the auspices of various educational, scientific, or Government
agencies, 17 special exhibits were held during the year in the foyer
of the National Museum.

National Gallery of Art.—Seven special exhibitions were held dur-
ing the year, representing the work of Clayton Knight, Alexander
Trowbridge, Emil Jacques, William Woollett, Elena and Bertha de
Hellebranth, Howard Fremont Stratton, and the artists enrolled in
the Civilian Conservation Corps camps. A number of art works
were accessioned subject to transfer to the Gallery if approved by
the National Gallery of Art Commission. Under the Catherine
Walden Myer fund, two early American miniatures were purchased
for the Gallery. The fourteenth annual meeting of the National
Gallery of Art Commission was held on December 11, 1934.

Freer Gallery of Art—The year’s additions to the collection in-
clude Chinese bronzes, jade, and ceramics, Syrian glass, Arabic and
Persian manuscripts, Chinese, Indian, and Persian paintings, Persian
silver, and Arabic wood-carving. Curatorial work was devoted to
the study of Chinese, Japanese, Armenian, Arabic, and Persian ob-
jects, and of the texts and seals associated with them. During the
year 1,268 objects and 153 photographs of objects were submitted
to the curator for an opinion as to their identity, meaning, or his-
torical or esthetic value. Visitors totaled 130,346, and 78 groups
were given docent service. The special exhibition of Whistler’s work
installed on May 14, 1934, in honor of the Whistler Centenary, was
taken down on December 26.

Bureau of American Ethnology.—Systematic researches conducted
by members of the Bureau staff included investigation of finds of
the eastern type of Folsom points in Virginia, inspection of mound
excavations near Macon, Ga., examination of archeological sites in
Georgia and Florida, researches on the ethnology of the Indians of
California and other related western Indians, and extensive study
and publication on the problem of Folsom man, based on explora-
tions at the Lindenmeier site, Colorado. Linguistic studies were
conducted on several Indian languages, including Timucua, Natick,
and Algonquian. Further researches were carried on relating to the

4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

at the Century of Progress Exposition. Extensive reports were pub-
lished on the archeology of Nebraska and of the Bay Islands of
Spanish Honduras.

International Exchanges——In the official exchange with other
countries of governmental and scientific documents, the exchange
service handled during the year a total of 654,181 packages, weigh-
ing 560,381 pounds. There are now 111 full and partial sets of
governmental documents and 102 copies of the daily issue of the
Congressional Record sent to foreign depositories.

National Zoological Park.—Accessions to the collection during the
vear numbered 627, and removals through various causes totaled
695, leaving the collections at the close of the year at 2,170 animals,
representing 665 different species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and
other forms. The number of visitors was 2,046,149, including groups
from 394 schools in 20 States and the District of Columbia. An allot-
ment of $680,000 was made on January 26, 1935, by the Public Works
Administration for the construction of a small mammal house, a
pachyderm house, an addition to the bird house, and mechanical
shops, buildings that have been urgently needed for many years.
Work was immediately started on the plans and specifications in the
office of the Supervising Architect, with Edwin H. Clarke as con-
sulting architect. Much work was also done on the buildings and
grounds with labor and materials supplied by the Emergency Works
Administration. The greatest need of the Zoo is for more liberal
appropriations for the purchase of specimens.

Astrophysical Observatory.—Regular observations of the solar
constant of radiation have been continued daily at the three solar
observing stations at Table Mountain, Calif.; Montezuma, Chile;
and Mount St. Katherine, Egypt. The observations from Mount
St. Katherine have been reduced at the central station at Washing-
ton under the direction of the assistant director, L. B. Aldrich,
assisted by a special staff of computers made available under a grant
from John A. Roebling. The results indicate that this station,
established in 1934, will prove to be one of high excellence. Analysis
of solar variation since 1920 has revealed 12 periodicities, all aliquot
parts of 23 years. These periodicities are also found in temperature
and precipitation records for six terrestrial stations for the past cen-
tury, and the 23-year cycle is found in the levels of lakes and streams,
the widths of tree-rings, the catches of ocean fish, varves of Pleisto-
cene and Eocene geologic age, and other phenomena depending on
weather. Forecasts of temperature and precipitation for 1934, 1935,
and 1936 for over 30 stations in the United States have been made,
and satisfactory agreement between forecasts and the events have
been found for two-thirds of the stations during 1934.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 5

Division of Radiation and Organisms.—TVhe following investiga-
tions were undertaken by the scientific staff of the Division: The
dependence of the growth of algae and wheat on the wave lengths of
radiation, determined by experiments conducted with Christiansen
filters specially adapted to this work by improvements made in the
Division; growth experiments on tomato plants under control as to
temperature, humidity, and color and intensity of radiation; experi-
ments in cooperation with the United States Department of Agri-
culture on the promotion and inhibition of the germination of seeds
under different selected wave lengths of light; and an experiment
on the growth of wheat under out-of-door conditions with controlled
quantities of carbon dioxide. Several papers embodying the results
of these investigations were published during the year in the Smith-
sonian Miscellaneous Collections, and others were in preparation.

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting
the trust, Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and, therefore,
constituted an “establishment” whose statutory members are “the
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the
executive departments.”

THH BOARD OF REGENTS

The affairs of the Institution are administered by a Board of
Regents whose membership consists of “the Vice President, the
Chief Justice, three Members of the Senate, and three Members of
the House of Representatives, together with six other persons other
than Members of Congress, two of whom shall be resident in the
city of Washington and the other four shall be inhabitants of some
State, but no two of them of the same State.” One of the regents
is elected chancellor of the board. In the past the selection has
fallen upon the Vice President or the Chief Justice, and a suitable
person is chosen by the regents as Secretary of the Institution, who
is also secretary of the Board of Regents, and the executive officer
directly in charge of the Institution’s activities.

Changes in the personnel of the Board during the year included
the appointment on January 23, 1935, of Senator Charles L. McNary,
of Oregon, as a regent to succeed Senator David A. Reed, whose term
6 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

as a Senator expired January 3, 1935; and the appointment by the
Speaker on February 21, 1935, of Representative Clarence Cannon,
of Missouri, to fill out the unexpired term to December 25, 1935, of
Representative E. H. Crump, whose term as a Representative had
expired on January 3, 1935.

The roll of regents at the close of the year was as follows:
Charles Evans Hughes, Chief Justice of the United States, Chan-
cellor; John N. Garner, Vice President of the United States; mem-
bers from the Senate—Joseph T. Robinson, M. M. Logan, Charles L.
McNary; members from the House of Representatives—T. Alan
Goldsborough, Clarence Cannon, Charles L. Gifford; citizen mem-
bers—F rederic A. Delano, Washington, D. C. (reappointment pend-
ing before Congress); John C. Merriam, Washington, D. C.; R.
Walton Moore, Virginia; Robert W. Bingham, Kentucky; Augustus
P. Loring, Massachusetts.

Proceedings.—Only one meeting of the full Board was held dur-
ing the year—the annual meeting on January 17, 1935. This date
for the annual meeting was fixed by a resolution adopted by the
Board on December 14, 1933, naming “ the second Thursday follow-
ing the first Monday in January” thereafter as the date for the
annual meeting, on account of the change of the date for the annual
convening of Congress to January 3. The regents present were Chief
Justice Charles Evans Hughes, chancellor, Senators Joseph T. Rob-
inson and M. M. Logan, Representatives T. Alan Goldsborough and
Charles L. Gifford, Frederic A. Delano, Hon. Irwin B. Laughlin,
Hon. R. Walton Moore, Augustus P. Loring, Dr. John C. Merriam,
and the Secretary, Dr. Charles G. Abbot.

The Secretary presented his annual report, detailing the activities
of the several Government branches and of the parent Institution
during the year, and Mr. Delano presented the report of the execu-
tive committee, covering financial statistics of the Institution. The
Secretary also presented the annual report of the National Gallery
of Art Commission.

The Secretary presented his usual special report reviewing the
outstanding events of the year, and Mr. Delano presented resolutions
prepared by the Permanent Committee, calling the attention of the
President of the United States to the urgency of grants from the
Public Works Administration to carry out the Institution’s build-
ing program. A resolution was adopted authorizing the transfer
of the income of the Loeb fund for a chemical type museum to other
purposes in connection with the library of the Chemists’ Club of
New York City, under certain conditions.

The Board adopted a resolution awarding the Langley Gold Medal
for Aerodromics to Dr. Joseph Sweetman Ames,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 7

The meeting then adjourned, and the regents inspected the special
exhibits in the Secretary’s office illustrative of some of the Institu-
tion’s recent activities.

MATTERS OF GENERAL INTEREST
CENTENARY OF THE BIRTH OF SAMUEL PIERPONT LANGLEY

On August 22, 1934, the Institution commemorated the one-
hundredth anniversary of the birth of Samuel Pierpont Langley,
its third Secretary, and one of the foremost American scientists of
the nineteenth century. On that date there was issued a pamphlet
consisting of extracts from Langley’s own writings, in which he de-
scribed his important discoveries in astronomy, astrophysics, physics,
and aeronautics. This pamphlet reveals strikingly the value and
breadth of Langley’s researches. To the public, his name is best
known in connection with his work in aeronautics, but to men of
science his fundamental researches in astronomy and physics are of
outstanding importance. The titles of some of the papers from
which quotations are given in the memorial pamphlet will reveal
the scope of his interest: “On the minute structure of the solar
photosphere ”; “The total solar eclipse of July 29, 1878”; “The
bolometer and radiant energy”; “On the amount of atmospheric
absorption ”; “The temperature of the moon”; “On hitherto un-
recognized wave-lengths”; “On a possible variation of the solar
radiation and its probable effect on terrestrial temperatures.”

A special exhibition was also arranged in the Smithsonian Build-
ing of scientific apparatus invented by Langley and of articles as-
sociated with him during his lifetime. Outstanding among his
inventions was the bolometer, an electrical thermometer capable of
detecting a change of heat as little as a millionth of a degree
Centigrade.

AWARD OF LANGLEY MEDAL TO JOSEPH S. AMES

The Langley Medal for Aerodromics of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution was presented on May 21, 1935, to Dr. Joseph S. Ames, of
Johns Hopkins University, Chairman of the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics, and for years one of the foremost
figures associated with the scientific development of American
aviation. The presentation was made by Chief Justice Charles E.
Hughes, Chancellor of the Institution, in accordance with the award
of the Board of Regents at their annual meeting in January. The
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

award, it was stated in the resolution accompanying the medal, was
“in recognition of the surpassing improvement of the performance,
efficiency, and safety of American aircraft resulting from the funda-
mental scientific researches conducted by the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics under the leadership of Dr. Ames.”

He was one of the 12 original members of this committee
appointed by President Wilson in 1915. He has served on 20 of its
subcommittees and acted as chairman of many of them. He has
been executive head of the organization since 1919, during which
time it has developed the famous Langley Laboratory, where many
airplane improvements now universally in use have been devised.

In accepting the medal, Dr. Ames said:

Mr. CHANCELLOR:

It is with the utmost pleasure that I accept the Langley Medal, and I beg
to express to you and your associates my sincere thanks for the great honor
paid me. There is no honor in the field of aeronautics as great as this.

When your secretary, Dr. Abbot, informed me that it had been voted to
bestow the medal upon me, I was overwhelmed by a feeling of unworthiness.
I had not made any contribution of note either to the science or to the art
of aeronautics. But I soon realized that the award was not made to me as
the result of such services as these, but rather as the result of my connection
with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. I think everyone will
grant that no single factor has had such a great influence in the notable
progress in both theoretical and applied aeronautics in this country during
the past 20 years as the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, and I
am proud to think that your Committee of Award consider me as in some way
responsible for the guidance of this work. This point of view I can under-
stand. For I have been a member of the committee since it was established
and its executive head for many years. But only I know how far from justi-
fied anyone is in attributing the good work of the committee to me. I have
simply done my best to make it possible for our scientists and engineers to
perform their investigations and to so cooperate with my associates on the
committee as to direct its policy wisely.

In recognizing this type of administrative work as of such value as to merit
the award of the Langley Medal, I think that your committee, Mr. Chancellor,
is not alone justified but also wise, and I am particularly pleased by the fact
that this honor comes to our committee while I am its chairman.

WALTER RATHBONE BACON TRAVELING SCHOLARSHIP

The Walter Rathbone Bacon traveling scholarship of the Smith-
sonian Institution was awarded in May 1935 to Dr. Richard E.
Blackwelder, at that time engaged in entomological work at the
United States National Museum, for an intensive study of the
staphylinid beetles of the West Indies. Dr. Blackwelder will collect
these beetles, comprising one of the largest and least-known animal
families on earth, on 25 West Indian Islands, including Cuba,
Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and Jamaica. Because of the small size
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9

and, as a rule, economic unimportance of this family, it has been
much neglected.

The entomologist will make an intensive search for specimens in
West Indian anthills. Several species are commensal with ants and,
because of this way of life, have developed curious forms. Some of
them seem to be kept by the ants as “ domestic animals.” They are
housed, protected, and fed by their hosts because of the body secre-
tion, which is a favorite food of the hosts. Some, on the other
hand, seem to live with the ants entirely for the purpose of feeding
on them and on their young. Even these are tolerated by their
hosts, who apparently have no realization of how they are being
victimized.

Staphylinid beetles are also numerous in fungous deposits and in
decaying vegetable matter. They remain hidden much of the time,
so that little information is available on their habits and life his-
tories. They are found over most of the world. Large collections
have been made in Europe and in the United States, and the Na-
tional Museum has a considerable representation of the different
species. The West Indies constitute largely unexplored territory,
so far as these beetles are concerned, and it is probable that many
new species will be identified from Dr. Blackwelder’s collection.

After completing his work in the West Indies, Dr. Blackwelder
will study the large collections in the British Museum.

FOURTH ARTHUR LECTURE

Under a bequest received in 1931 from the late James Arthur, of
New York City, a lecture is delivered each year at the Institution on
some phase of the study of the sun.

The fourth annual Arthur Lecture was given in the auditorium of
the National Museum on December 18, 1934, by Dr. Walter S. Adams,
director of the Mount Wilson Observatory, on “'The Sun as a Typi-
cal Star.” Dr. Adams, one of the foremost astronomers of the world,
has made original researches on the place of the sun among the
billions of stars of the galaxy. The lecture will be published in the
general appendix to the Smithsonian Report for 1935.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION EXHIBIT AT THE CALIFORNIA PACIFIC
INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION, 1935

The Smithsonian exhibit at the California Pacific International
Exposition, which opened at San Diego May 29, 1935, was prepared
under the direction of Carl W. Mitman, head curator of arts and
industries, National Museum. It is one of a group visualizing activ-
ities of the major departments and independent establishments of
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

the Federal Government. All these exhibits are installed in a newly
constructed permanent building simulating an Aztec temple erected
in the Exposition grounds. They are distributed over the single
floor of the building, the area of which is 170 by 150 feet. The space
assigned to the Smithsonian Institution is 38 feet long by 138 feet
wide, and is situated along the wide wall to the west or right of the
main entrance.

The limited allotment of space and money for the participation of
the Smithsonian Institution in the Exposition precluded the prepara-
tion of either a general exhibit of all Smithsonian activities or a
complete exposition of any single activity. A small exhibit was,
therefore, prepared to indicate some of the ethnological work of the
Institution in the Southwest.

The space is arranged in the form of a rectangular alcove, the
sides of which are exhibition cases 12 feet deep by 9 feet wide. For
the rear wall area there was designed a pictorial map of the South-
west, 8 by 6 feet in size. This was painted by Benson B. Moore,
of Washington, D. C., in old cartographic style and portrays the
journeys of the Spanish explorer, Coronado, in the Southwest in
1540-1543, together with many sites of modern explorations made
in this area by the Institution.

According to the historic record of his explorations, Coronado
first contacted the Apache Indians and subsequently conquered the
Zuiis. In the exhibition cases flanking the map, therefore, there
are installed life-size habitat groups of these tribes; the Apache
family group of five figures on the left flank and the Zuni family
group of eight figures on the right flank—all dressed in original cos-
tumes from the National Museum collections. Landscapes typical
of the country in which these tribes live are painted on the closed
sides of the cases and form realistic backgrounds for the groups.
These paintings were executed by Richmond I. Kelsey, of San Diego,
Calif. A descriptive label for each group is mounted on the rear
wall in the space between the map and exhibition case. A third
label records briefly the Institution’s history and activities.

The Exposition was still open at the close of the year and was
expected to remain open at least until November 1935.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

Although still considerably hampered in its field operations by
lack of funds, the Institution conducted or took part in 20 expedi-
tions, 7 more than in the previous year. Secretary Abbot and his
colleagues continued the study of the radiation of the sun, both at
Washington and at the three field stations, Table Mountain, Calif.,
Mount Montezuma, Chile, and Mount St. Katherine, Egypt. Dr.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 11

W. F. Foshag collected minerals and studied mineral deposits in both
northern and southern Mexico. Dr. C. Lewis Gazin directed an
expedition to collect vertebrate fossils in the Snake River basin of
Idaho. Dr. G. A. Cooper established a correlation of middle Devo-
nian deposits in Ontario, New York, and Michigan. Dr. W. L.
Schmitt again accompanied the Hancock expedition to the Gala-
pagos Islands. Rev. David C. Graham continued his zoological col-
lecting for the Institution in Szechwan, China. Dr. Hugh M. Smith
collected birds, mammals, and other forms in various parts of Siam.
Austin H. Clark collected butterflies in Bedford and Princess Anne
Counties, Va., in continuation of his survey of the little-known butter-
fly fauna of Virginia. Jason R. Swallen collected grasses in north-
eastern Brazil,

Dr. C. W. Bishop, director of the Freer Gallery Field Expedition
to China, brought the work to a close in 1934 and returned to the
United States. The work of the expedition occupied a period of over
4 years and included the excavation of a number of archeological
sites and an archeological reconnaissance of nearly the entire province
of Shansi. Dr. Ale’ Hrdli¢ka continued his archeological investiga-
tions on Kodiak Island, Alaska, unearthing much new evidence on
the identity of the ancient inhabitants of the site. H. W. Krieger,
through an allotment of P. W. A. funds, excavated archeological
sites in Oregon in the area that will be flooded with the completion
of the Bonneville Dam. M. W. Stirling supervised several archeo-
logical projects in Florida conducted in cooperation with the Federal
Emergency Relief Administration. Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, Jr., ex-
cavated a camp site and workshop in Colorado attributable to Folsom
man, bringing to light for the first time a variety of implements
belonging to that early horizon. Dr. Roberts also excavated an
extensive Indian site on the former battlefield at Shiloh National
Military Park, Tenn. Dr. W. D. Strong conducted archeological
excavations at Buena Vista Lake, Calif., and later made a brief
archeological reconnaissance of the Cuyama Valley and also of the
mountainous district adjacent to the Sisquoc River. W. M. Walker
excavated ancient Yokuts shellmounds near Taft, Calif. Dr. J. R.
Swanton was successful in further determining points on the route
followed by Hernando De Soto in 1540 through Georgia and part
of South Carolina. Dr. J. P. Harrington conducted ethnological
studies among the Indians of California. Dr. Truman Michelson
studied the Passamaquoddy Indians on the State reservation on the
coast of Maine.

These expeditions are briefly described and illustrated in the
pamphlet entitled ‘“ Explorations and Field-Work of the Smithson-
ian Institution in 1934”, Smithsonian publication no. 3300.
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

PUBLICATIONS

Again this past year the drastic curtailment of printing funds
for the Government bureaus under the Institution has vitally affected
the work of those bureaus. The scientific series normally published
by the National Museum and by the Bureau of American Ethnology
have again been virtually suspended. During the emergency period
of the depression, when ordinary governmental expenditures were
greatly reduced, the brunt of the cut in Smithsonian appropriations
was borne by the printing fund, as only there could a saving be made
without throwing employees out of work. For 3 years the printing
appropriation has been reduced to a point where it is possible only
to do routine printing of blank forms and reports and a few very
small pamphlets, with the result that there is now on hand an ac-
cumulation of valuable manuscripts, many of them representing the
results of years of research by the Institution’s specialists. This
basic information in biology, geology, and anthropology should with-
out further delay be made available to students and research workers,
and it is the hope of the Institution that, now the peak of the de-
pression is past, adequate funds will again be made available so that
a normal flow of scientific publications may again issue from this
Institution, whose very purpose, as incorporated by act of Congress,
is “the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

The publications issued during the year, paid for mostly from
the private funds of the Institution, totaled 64; 54 of these were pub-
lished by the Institution proper, 8 by the National Museum, 1 by the
Bureau of American Ethnology, and 1 by the Freer Gallery of Art.
The number of publications distributed was 124,186.

LIBRARY

The accessions to the Smithsonian library during the year num-
bered 6,105 volumes and 6,578 pamphlets and charts, bringing the
total number of items in the library to 848,517. Most of the addi-
tions were exchanges for Smithsonian publications, but there were
also the usual large number of gifts from organizations and indi-
viduals. In addition to the routine work of the library, the staff
completed several important projects begun last year, with the as-
sistance of F. E. R. A. workers assigned to the library; these proj-
ects included sorting and arranging foreign scientific and technical
duplicates in the west stacks of the Smithsonian building, and sorting
and reassigning the contents of the sectional libraries of administra-
tion and engineering.

Respectfully submitted.

C. G. Aspor, Secretary.
APPENDIX 1
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the
condition and operation of the United States National Museum for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1935:

Appropriations for the maintenance of the National Museum for
the year totaled $716,071, which was $61,200 more than for 1934.

COLLECTIONS

Material added to the collections during the year came in 1,794
separate accessions, mostly as gifts from outside individuals and
organizations, and was varied and representative in character. It
totaled 296,468 specimens, divided as follows: Anthropology, 3,758;
biology, 258,692; geology, 28,528; arts and industries, 3,808; history,
1,682. Gifts to schools and other educational institutions numbered
4,039 specimens. Exchanges of duplicate material with other insti-
tutions and individuals totaled 17,194 specimens, and 17,783 specimens
were lent to workers outside of Washington.

Following is a summary of the more important accessions received
in the various departments:

Anthropology—American ethnological material received from va-
rious sources represented the Point Barrow Eskimos, the Haida
Indians of British Columbia and Alaska, the Navaho, the 'Tarahu-
mare Indians of Mexico, the Delaware, Osage, Plains, Pueblo, and
Yakima Indians of North America, and the San Blas Indians of
Panama. From Matto Grosso, Brazil, came a number of weapons
of the fierce Parintintin Indians, and from the head-hunting Jivaro
of Ecuador a collection of textiles and adornments received through
the Bureau of American Ethnology. Specimens came also from
Africa, Oceania, and Malaysia. As in former years, ethnological
material presented by Dr. Hugh M. Smith, fisheries adviser to the
Royal Siamese Government, was extensive.

Among the noteworthy archeological material received was a
plaster cast, presented by the Carnegie Institution of Washington,
of the elaborately carved surface of a Maya altar at Quirigua,
Guatemala, regarded as one of the finest examples of aboriginal

13
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

sculpture recovered from the Maya area. By transfer from the
Bureau of American Ethnology came over 300 specimens collected
by Dr. W. D. Strong from the Bay Islands and from the mainland
of Spanish Honduras. Also may be mentioned 214 flint objects
from a Paleolithic deposit in Mugharet et-Tabun (Cave of the
Oven), near Mount Carmel, Palestine, deposited by the Archeologi-
cal Society of Washington; 1,188 stone artifacts, basketry frag-
ments, and other material collected by Frank M. Setzler from 2
caves in Val Verde County, Tex.; 3 terra-cotta cones from Ur of the
Chaldees, Iraq, bearing inscriptions that date them about 2075 B. C.,
given by the Bruce Hughes fund; 52 stone implements from South
Africa, donated by W. C. Abbott, of Cape Town; and earthenware
vessels from Panama, ivory and bone harpoon heads from St. Law-
rence Island, Alaska, and Paleolithic implements from the Thames
Valley, England.

Skeletal material received came from Florida, California, and
North Carolina, and from Kodiak Island, Alaska, collected by Dr.
AleS Hrdlicka. Skeletons collected by Frank M. Setzler, though
few in number, were important because of the new type and area
represented.

Biology.—A special feature of this year’s biological accretions was
the large number of genera and species new to the collections. Much
invaluable type material also was received. Many rare species of
mammals and birds from Siam and China came from Dr. Hugh M.
Smith and Dr. D. C. Graham, respectively, who contributed from
these countries also considerable collections of reptiles and amphib-
ians, fishes, insects, mollusks, marine invertebrates, and plants.
Among the forms now represented for the first time were the Saiga
antelope from the Kalmuk Steppes of South Russia (of which the
Museum formerly had only a skeleton), a sloth (Scaeopus) and a
monkey (Brachyteles) from South America, a porpoise taken on
the third Hancock Galapagos expedition, 15 genera of birds, and a
number of species of West Indian beetles. Other noteworthy acces-
sions include: A large collection of Brazilian reptiles, amphibians,
fishes, insects, and mollusks made by Dr. Doris Cochran; over 3,000
fishes comprising the private collection of Dr. G. S. Myers; 2,400
Florida fishes collected by C. R. Aschmeier; a collection of South
American Homoptera made by the late Dr. F. W. Goding; a collec-
tion of Oriental insects made by T. R. Gardner; the J. E. Guthrie
collection of Collembola; 3,000 New England insects, mostly Ho-
moptera, from P. W. Oman; a valuable series of invertebrates col-
lected under the auspices of the late C. C. Nutting, of the University
of Iowa; crustaceans and other forms collected by Dr. W. L. Schmitt
on the third Hancock expedition to the Galapagos Islands; about
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

30,000 mollusks, chiefly European, from Dr. H. R. K. Agersborg;
and nearly 50,000 specimens of plants from many sources, repre-
senting a wide variety of localities.

Geology.—To the Canfield collection were added 174 mineral spec-
imens, including a rich mass of North Carolina uraninite showing
crystals and weighing over 5 pounds, obtained through the interest
of Dr. H. P. Barret. Through the income of the Roebling fund 393
mineral specimens were added, of special interest being a collection
of minerals from pegmatitic pockets in the granite area of Striegau,
Germany, and the material resulting from Dr. W. F. Foshag’s field
work in Mexico under the auspices of the fund. Many of the
Museum’s friends contributed valuable mineral specimens, many of
them from Mexico. Species of minerals new to the Museum include
ahlfeldite, blockite, kolbeckine, and selenolite from Bolivia; aglau-
rite from Czechoslovakia; igalikite, metejarlite, and naujakasite
from Greenland; johannsenite from Mexico; repossite from Italy;
and sahlinite from Sweden. Dr. Eugene Poitevin presented a speci-
men of his new mineral ashtonite.

The increase in the meteorite collection was especially notable, 25
new falls being added, bringing to 592 the total number of distinct
meteoric falls now represented.

About 500 rock specimens were added to the Henry S. Washington
petrographic series. Accession of ores was of increased importance,
several mining companies as well as individuals donating valuable
samples. From the United States Geological Survey a collection of
described material was received illustrating the petrology of the
Louisiana and Texas cap-rocks.

The outstanding gift of the year in invertebrate paleontology was
the Hurlburt collection of Lower Paleozoic fossils, especially rich in
rare New York Ordovician trilobites, crinoids, cystids, and mollusks.
This collection was presented by Edward N. Hurlburt, of Rochester,
N. Y., as a memorial to his father, who assembled it in the early days
of American paleontology. Nine gifts furnished fossils from coun-
tries beyond North America, which are especially valuable for com-
parative purposes. About 30,000 Devonian and other Paleozoic
fossils were collected for the Museum by Dr. G. A. Cooper in Mich-
igan, Ontario, and New York, and (with R. D. Mesler) about 10,000
fossils in Virginia, Tennessee, and Arkansas.

Materials resulting from the field expedition to Idaho under Dr.
C. L. Gazin are of first importance in vertebrate paleontology. Fos-
sil remains of the extinct horse Plesippus shoshonensis formed the
bulk of the collections. An excellent skeleton of the sauropod dino-
saur Camarasaurus was obtained through exchange with the Car-
negie Museum of Pittsburgh.
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

Arts and industries—The outstanding accession in aeronautics was
the motorless sailplane Falcon, built in 1934 for the late Warren
Eaton, which well illustrates modern progress in aerodynamic ef-
ficiency. It was presented by Mrs. Genevieve J. Eaton. The May-
bach Motor Co. presented a Maybach engine, type VI-2, like that
used in the Graf Zeppelin and other recent airships. Other aero-
nautic material received included the magnetic compass used by
Admiral Byrd in his 1926 North Pole flight, 13 excellent scale models
of aircraft, and a series of aluminum alloy fittings and airship
girders.

In mechanical technology, models of watercraft figured in the ac-
cessions, the most important being the original models of the schooner
James S. Steele and the knockabout Helen B. Thomas, designed by
Capt. Thomas F. McManus.

The automobile collection was enhanced by the gift of William K.
Vanderbilt of the cup presented to the winner of the first Vanderbilt
Cup Race 30 years ago. One railroad accession was received—a
model of the locomotive DeWitt Clinton and train, the first loco-
motive to run in the State of New York.

One hundred and eight specimens of new textile fabrics, illustrat-
ing new weaves and combinations; 31 dioramas showing the history
of medicine-making; and a complete Mergenthaler linotype (no. 9)
were among other outstanding accessions.

History.—Over 1,600 articles of historical and antiquarian import
were received, many falling within the military and naval categories.
The numismatic collection was increased by 186 coins and the phila-
telic series by 1,314 stamps.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

Field work carried on during the year was financed mainly
through grants from the invested funds of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, with some additional assistance from such outside sources
as the P. W. A. and interested friends.

Anthropology.—tiIn December, Herbert W. Krieger, curator of
ethnology, brought to a close the archeological work commenced last
year in the Columbia River Valley. Search for new light on early
Virginia tribal life was made by Mr. Krieger and H. B. Collins, Jr.
in field studies made at Indian village sites along the lower Potomac
River and elsewhere in the State.

Frank M. Setzler, assistant curator of archeology, late in 1934,
accompanied Dr. John R. Swanton in a trip by automobile through
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, to
seek information concerning the route traveled by Hernando De
Soto in 1539 and 1540 and to examine vestiges of certain Indian vil-
lages mentioned by the chroniclers of the De Soto expedition.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 17

Dr. AleS Hrdli¢ka, curator of physical anthropology, with a group
of five students, continued his archeological work on Kodiak Island,
Alaska, which has been in progress intermittently since 1932.

Biology.—Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt, curator of marine invertebrates,
by invitation participated again in Capt. G. Allan Hancock’s expe-
dition to the Galapagos Islands on the yacht Velero JI, and brought
back several thousand natural-history specimens.

Dr. Doris M. Cochran, assistant curator of reptiles and am-
phibians, under a grant from the Smithsonian Institution, was de-
tailed to Brazil to study Brazilian amphibians. She returned early
in June with many thousand specimens, including not only am-
phibians and reptiles but also representing several other branches of
zoology.

Gerrit S. Miller, Jr., curator of mammals, spent several weeks study-
ing the fauna of the outlying keys of southern Florida and made
extensive collections there of mammals, reptiles, and other forms.

Dr. Hugh M. Smith, honorary associate curator of zoology, who
for many years has represented the Museum in explorations in Siam,
returned to Washington and brought with him large collections that
added greatly to the Museum’s Siamese material. Dr. D. C.
Graham, honorary collaborator in biology, from his headquarters at
Chengtu, China, continued to send valued specimens resulting from
his excursions in the Chinese province of Szechwan.

Jason R. Swallen, Department of Agriculture botanist, brought to
a close a successful period of exploration for grasses in Brazil and
obtained about 8,000 specimens. Another piece of field work con-
cluded was that of Dr. Alan Mozley, working under the Walter
Rathbone Bacon traveling scholarship in a study of Siberian mol-
lusks. Also may be mentioned local work by members of the Mu-
seum staff on a study of the biota of Maryland and Virginia: Dr.
G. S. Myers and E. D. Reid studied and collected fresh-water fishes
from this area; Dr. Paul Bartsch made extensive collections of mol-
lusks, amphibians, and birds with reference to the District of Colum-
bia fauna; and Austin H. Clark studied Virginia butterflies, visit-
ing 54 counties of the State.

Prof. C. E. Burt, of Southwestern College, under a grant from the
Smithsonian, worked in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas collecting
a series of turtles for the Museum.

Geology—C. W. Gilmore, curator of vertebrate paleontology, near
the close of the year left for Montana to take charge of an expedi-
tion into the Judith River (Upper Cretaceous) of that State, where
a search was to be made for dinosaur material.

The expedition under the direction of Dr. C. L. Gazin, assistant
curator of vertebrate paleontology, at the fossil quarries near Hager-
man, Idaho, was gratifyingly successful, the material acquired nearly
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

equaling the previous combined collections from the same locality.
Fossil remains of the horse Plestppus formed the bulk of the
material.

Dr. W. F. Foshag, curator of mineralogy, spent 4 months in Mex-
ico collecting minerals under the auspices of the Roebling fund,
visiting important mining districts in the Sierra Madres of western
Chihuahua and vicinity and in southern Mexico.

E. P. Henderson, assistant curator of mineralogy, investigated
reports of meteorites and collected minerals in Arkansas, Kansas,
and Virginia.

Dr. G. A. Cooper, assistant curator of stratigraphic paleontology,
with a group of Geological Survey geologists, studied the region
near Phillipsburg, Quebec, and collected many fossils. He also vis-
ited the lower peninsula of Michigan, to study the Devonian strata
near Alpena, as well as southwestern Ontario, northwestern Ohio,
and western New York. Also, with R. D. Mesler, of the Geological
Survey, he collected fossils at Batesville, Ark.

MISCELLANEOUS

Visitors —Visitors during the year to the various Museum build-

129,386. During April 1935 there were 307,739 visitors, the largest
number ever recorded for a single month.

Publications —On account of the greatly curtailed allotments for
printing, the publication output of the Museum was small. Only
8 papers were issued during the year, including the annual report
for 1934 and 7 Proceedings papers. These are listed elsewhere in
this report. Volumes and separates distributed during the year to

on the preparation of the index to Museum publications started last
year.

Special exhibits—Seventeen special exhibits were held during the
year, under the auspices of various educational, scientific, and Gov-
ernment agencies, including, among others, the American Forestry
Association, the Potomac Rose Society, the District of Columbia

APPENDIX 2
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Smr: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activ-
ities of the National Gallery of Art for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1935:

In the past 12 months several events have taken place which may
have a bearing on the future of the National Gallery of Art, and
so it will be of interest to record them here.

The press has reported that the Mellon Foundation may locate in
Washington a gallery of art to house the Mellon collection of paint-
ings as well as other masterpieces. The details of the foundation and
its relation to the National Gallery of Art have not been definitely
decided.

Senator David I. Walsh, of Massachusetts, introduced into the
Senate a bill which may lead to the formation of a National Portrait
Gallery under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution.

Representative William I, Sirovich, of New York, Chairman of the
Committee on Patents, held extensive hearings on House Joint Reso-
lution No. 220, which relates to the proposed formation of a new
Government department to be called the “Department of Science,
Art, and Literature.”

The Government has placed artists in the Civilian Conservation
Corps camps to record their activities. It has also awarded many
contracts for the decoration of Government buildings throughout
the United States.

These events show that there is a widespread interest in art in our
country and raise the hope that the Government will sooner or later
provide a building where the works of art in its possession can be
properly shown. Collectors as a rule want their treasures in some
permanent museum, and would be attracted by the high standing of a
national gallery comparable to those of the European countries. Sel-
dom are collectors able to do as did Mr, Freer—furnish the material,
the building, and also the money for its upkeep, so that the Freer
Gallery is an almost independent unit under the direction of the
Smithsonian Institution. Many collectors, when they shall see a
proper building for the National Gallery of Art, and the material in
it properly cared for, will feel that they have found the most suitable
place to give their collections. But without a building, with no room
to expand, our collections must stand still.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 21

APPROPRIATIONS

For the administration of the National Gallery of Art by the
Smithsonian Institution, including compensation of necessary em-
ployees, purchase of books of reference and periodicals, traveling
expenses, uniforms for guards, and necessary incidental expenses,
$32,768 was appropriated.

THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART COMMISSION

The fourteenth annual meeting of the National Gallery of Art

of the Smithsonian Institution, who is ex-officio member and also
the secretary of the Commission; Frank Jewett Mather, Jr., vice
chairman; Herbert Adams; Gifford Beal; Charles L. Borie, Jr.;

the United States National Museum and acting director of the
National Gallery of Art, was also present.

The Commission recommended to the Board of Regents the re-
election for the succeeding term of 4 years of the following members:
Herbert Adams, Gifford Beal, and Charles Moore.

The following officers were re-elected for the ensuing year: Joseph
H. Gest, chairman; Frank Jewett Mather, Jr., vice chairman; and
Dr. Charles G. Abbot, secretary; as well as the members of the
executive committee: Charles Moore, Herbert Adams, and George B.
McClellan. Joseph H. Gest, as chairman of the Commission, and
Dr. Charles G. Abbot, as secretary of the Commission, are ex-officio
members,

The following resolution was adopted as an expression of the Com-
mission’s general policy in connection with gifts or bequests offered
with certain undesirable restrictions:

Resolved, That it is the recommendation of the National Gallery of Art
Commission that the Smithsonian Institution do not in general accept for the
National Gallery of Art gifts or bequests of miscellaneous collections of objects
of art when a condition is attached thereto that the objects must be exhibited
in perpetuity.

[Joseph H. Gest, chairman of the National Gallery of Art Commis-
sion, died on June 26, 1935, at Cincinnati, Ohio. |

Curatorial work within the collection has been devoted to the
study of Chinese, Japanese, Armenian, Arabic, and Persian objects,
and of the texts and seals associated with them, including those newly
acquired ; also to the examination of objects submitted to the curator
by other institutions or by private owners for an opinion as to their.
identity, their meaning, or their historic or esthetic value. A total
of 1,268 objects and 153 photographs of objects were examined in
this way and written or oral reports were made upon them. Also,
14 texts were submitted for translation.

Changes in exhibition have involved a total of 190 subjects, as

APPENDIX 4
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1935, conducted
in accordance with the act of Congress of March 28, 1934. The act
referred to contains the following item:

American ethnology: For continuing ethnological researches among the Ameri-
can Indians and the natives of Hawaii, the excavation and preservation of
archeologic remains under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, includ-
ing necessary employees, the preparation of manuscripts, drawings, and illustra-
tions, the purchase of books and periodicals, and traveling expenses, $52,910.00.

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

M. W. Stirling, Chief, left Washington on October 23, 1934, to
investigate the location of finds of the eastern type of Folsom point
in King and Queen and Halifax Counties, Va., and in Granville
County, N. C. It was discovered that the points in question were all
surface finds, the exact location of several being examined. Two in-
teresting facts developed from this study: None of the Folsomlike
points was found in connection with village site material, and all of
them were recovered from hilltop fields or other elevations where
erosion had removed the topsoil. Until finds are made in situ, and
in association with other material, very little can be said as to the
antiquity of the specimens beyond the fact that they appear to be
earlier than the ceramic horizons in the same region.

On January 18, 1935, Mr. Stirling arrived at San Jose, Guatemala,
from which point he visited archeological sites on the Pacific Coastal
Plain. Proceeding to the highlands of Guatemala, he visited several
Maya Quiche villages in the vicinity of Lake Atitlan and Chichi-
castenango. Subsequently he studied the old empire ruins of
Quirigua on the Motagua River and Copan in Honduras. After
returning to Guatemala from Honduras, Mr. Stirling proceeded to
Yucatan, where he spent a week as a guest of the Carnegie Institu-
tion in viewing the sites of Uxmal and Chichen Itza. On February
12 he returned to Washington.

On June 18 Mr. Stirling left Washington for Macon, Ga., to
examine the progress made by Dr. A. R. Kelly on the large-scale

31
30) ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

mound excavations near that city. From Macon Mr. Stirling pro-
ceeded to Brunswick, Ga., to view some of the archeological sites on
the Sea Islands and to consult with National Park Service officials
regarding the establishment of archeological monuments in that area.
From Brunswick he went to Manatee, Fla., to examine some interest-
ing Calusa material discovered by Montague Tallant. Following
this, a brief trip was made to Cape Sable and the Florida Keys to
locate some of the southernmost examples of Calusa archeological
sites. On the return trip to Washington, he spent 2 days at Talla-
hassee, Fla., in consultation with Vernon Lamme, Florida State
Archeologist, and visited several interesting sites in the vicinity.

Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, devoted a considerable part of
the year to the amplification of his report on the Southeastern
Indians, material being added from Spanish, French, and English
sources,

In November and the first week of December, Dr. Swanton, accom-
panied by F. M. Setzler, assistant curator of archeology in the
United States National Museum, visited Macon, Ga., as the guests of
Dr. and Mrs. Charles C. Harrold, stopping on the way at various
points in North Carolina to examine archeological collections and
sites connected with the expedition of De Soto. They remained in
Atlanta, at the invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Beverly M. Du Bose, long
enough to view the famous Etowah mounds at Cartersville. Besides
visiting several sites in the immediate neighborhood of Macon, they
made a trip to Panama City, Fla., and with the helpful cooperation
of Judge Ira A. Hutchinson of that place viewed many of the sites
explored by Clarence B. Moore and obtained an excellent collection
of potsherds from one of the large shell heaps. On the return trip
to Washington productive attempts were made to identify sites
visited by De Soto in both North and South Carolina. Lectures
were delivered at Macon and also at Emory University, Atlanta,
before those interested in the local archeology.

During the last week in December, Dr. Swanton took part in a
conference on the prehistory of the lower Mississippi Valley at
Baton Rouge, La., and on his way back spent some time visiting
Indian sites along Alabama River with James Y. Brame, Jr., of
Montgomery, Ala.

Shortly before the end of the year Dr. Swanton took up again
his work on the Timucua linguistic material, which had been laid
aside for some time. Timucua is no longer spoken, and, with the
exception of two letters and some isolated words, all that is known
regarding it is contained in five early seventeenth-century religious
works published by the Franciscan friars Pareja and Movilla, with
a grammar by the former.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 30

At the beginning of the year Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist,
was engaged in working out the phonetic shifts of Natick on the
basis of the material contained in Trumbull’s Dictionary. With
very few exceptions these are now satisfactorily solved, and have
been indexed on file cards. When a few remaining obscure points
are elucidated it will be possible to present a complete paper for
publication. During the year a number of technical papers were
prepared for publication in certain professional periodicals. Among
these is a series of papers solving certain difficulties in Algonquian
sound-shifts and etymologies as well as showing that some sound-
shifts took place in Proto-Algonquian times. An article on Winne-
bago social and political organization should also be noted. The
data extracted from Caleb Atwater’s writings, previously neglected,
are important. A new technique of determining the gentes of some
tribes at certain times is given. Since gentes often own personal
names, it is clear that personal names occurring as the signers of
treaties and in early documents can be utilized in determining the
gentes. Of general ethnological interest will be Dr. Michelson’s
communication, shortly to be published in the American Anthropol-
ogist, on Miss Owen’s Folk-Lore of the Musquakie Indians. Since
the book deals with the Musquakie Indians, we have a right to
suppose that the Indian words cited are Musquakie. However, Dr.
Michelson shows that several are not even Algonquian but Siouan.
Dr. Michelson has prepared and submitted for publication two
papers: “Further Notes on Algonquian Kinship Terms” and
“What Happened to Green Bear Who Was Blessed with a Sacred
Pack”

Dr. John P. Harrington, ethnologist, continued during the year
his researches on the Indians of California and other related western
Indians, both in the field and in Washington. At the beginning of
the year he was engaged in work in southern California with an
aged Indian, reviewing with him the ethnology contained in Father
Boscana’s unique report on the culture of the southern California
coast Indians, written in 1822, the manuscript of which Dr. Harring-
ton recently discovered. The rehearing and annotating of this im-
portant manuscript was continued with other informants until well
into the fall, resulting in the elucidating of practically every passage
of the old text. On the completion of this work Dr. Harrington
returned to Washington, D. C., to continue the annotation of the
Boscana manuscript. Owing to the presence of Mission Indians in
the city of Washington during all the latter part of the year, as
delegates in connection with legislative work, Dr. Harrington
availed himself of this opportunity to amplify the work. Legends
and other materials from these Indians were reheard, discussed, and
edited. This work was still in continuation on June 30.
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., archeologist, devoted considerable
time during the year to a study of the problem of so-called Folsom
man. Extensive correspondence was carried on with collectors
throughout the country concerning their finds of Folsom points and
many examples were sent to him for study, photographing, and
measuring. Asa result of this work much new information was ob-
tained concerning variations in this peculiar type of projectile point
and its distribution.

Dr. Roberts left Washington September 23, 1934, for Fort Collins,
Colo., to investigate a site which had been reported to the Smithso-
nian Institution by Maj. Roy G. Coflin, professor of geology in Colo-
rado State College. The site was discovered in 1924 by Judge C. C.
Coffin and his son, A. L. Coffin, of Fort Collins. Among the speci-
mens were points which later were identified as belonging to the
Folsom type, the oldest thus far known in North America. Dr.
Roberts spent 6 weeks exploring the site, with the permission of the
owner of the land, William Lindenmeier, Jr., of Fort Collins. From
an intact midden layer 14 feet below the present ground level, and a
quarter of a mile distant from the place of the original finds by the
Coffins, he procured a whole series of implements which definitely
establish a complex for the Folsom horizon.

Dr. Roberts returned to Washington November 20, 1934, and dur-
ing the winter months prepared a manuscript detailing the results of
his work. This paper, entitled “A Folsom Complex: Preliminary
Report on Investigations at the Lindenmeier Site in Northern Colo-
rado”, was published June 20, 1935, in the Smithsonian Miscel-
laneous Collections, vol. 94, no. 4, publ. no. 3333.

Dr. Roberts left Washington again for Fort Collins on May 26. A
camp was established at the Lindenmeier site and excavations on
a larger scale than those of the preceding autumn were begun. The
digging yielded numerous specimens of stone implements and a con-
siderable quantity of bison bones, indicating that they are from much
larger animals than the modern bison. A number of stone imple-
ments were found in direct association with these bones, and one
vertebra contains the tip end from a typical Folsom point.

While the work at the Lindenmeier site was progressing, Dr.
Roberts visited a number of locations in the northern Colorado area
where Folsom specimens have been found. None of the latter indi-
cated possibilities for increased knowledge on the subject comparable
to those at the Lindenmeier site.

During the month spent in the office Dr. Roberts also worked on
manuscripts detailing the results of archeological work conducted
in Arizona and at Shiloh National Military Park, Tenn.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 35

From July to October 1934, Dr. W. D. Strong, ethnologist, was
in Washington working with the collections made in Spanish Hon-
duras during the preceding years. During the year a report on one
phase of this work, entitled “Archeological Investigations in the Bay
Islands, Spanish Honduras ”, was completed. It was published Feb-
ruary 12, 1935, in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, vol. 92,
no. 14. In October 1934 Dr. Strong was sent to Fort Collins, Colo.,
to examine and assist in work at a newly discovered site where a
habitation level occupied by Folsom man was being investigated by
Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, Jr., of the Bureau of American Ethnology.
Returning to Washington in the same month, he was occupied for
some time in revising and amplifying an earlier report, “An Intro-
duction to Nebraska Archeology ”, which was completed and went
to press March 1, 1935. From December 1934 until the end of the
year, Dr. Strong served as an adviser in anthropology to the Bureau
of Indian Affairs. Prior to May 1934 this work was carried on in
addition to his other duties but, subsequent to that time, through an
arrangement between the Bureau of American Ethnology and the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, full time was devoted to this task.

Winslow M. Walker, associate anthropologist, devoted the time
from July 1 until the end of the calendar year in working with the
collections made in connection with the Federal Civil Works Admin-
istration relief project at Buena Vista Lake, Calif. At the same
time Mr. Walker was able to continue work in connection with his
researches in the lower Mississippi Valley, and completed for publi-
cation the report of his work on the large mound at Troyville, La.

J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, was engaged during the year in a
revision of the native Onondaga text of the Requickening Address
of the Condolence Convocation of the Iroquois League, adding to
the text and translation the summarizing speech introductory to the
Second Part of this Address, retranslating the whole. He also re-
vised the historical tradition of the founding of the League of the
Iroquois, not only words but incidents as well, retranslating the
whole to conform to the corrections. Texts of laws relating to other
aspects of the League were also revised and made to conform to later
information obtained in his researches.

Mr. Hewitt worked on the preparation of a paper analyzing
approximately 400 Chippewa place names. He also prepared a list
of over 200 Seneca personal names arranged according to the age
grades of the individual.

In the course of the year Mr. Hewitt attended the meetings of the
Advisory Committee to the Division of Geographic Names of the
Department of the Interior, for which he also did some research
work.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

Miss Frances Densmore, a collaborator of the Bureau, continued
her study of Indian music during this year, submitting disk records
of Indian songs made at the Century of Progress Exposition. The
records of seven songs were submitted, with transcriptions of two
Navaho and four Sioux songs, and accompanying data. ‘These have
been cataloged consecutively with her former work. Two of the
Sioux songs were selected by Dean Carl E. Seashore for graphic
reproduction by his method of phonophotography, the work being
done at his laboratory at the University of Iowa, Iowa City. This
is the first use of this technique of graphical recording in connection
with the study of Indian music. Dr. Seashore states: “From a
single playing before the microphone three groups of records are
made: First, a re-recording of the song on hard disks for auditory
reference; second, a phonophotographic record of pitch, intensity
and time; and, third, an oscillogram for harmonic analysis to deter-
mine tone quality.” Through his courtesy there was submitted a
print of a portion of the original phonophotogram of one of these
songs, and a graph, or “ pattern score” made by Dr. Harold Sea-
shore from the phonophotogram. A comparison of this score with
the transcription made by Miss Densmore corroborates the evidence
of the ear in discerning the pitch of Indian singing and also opens
interesting new avenues of investigation. Miss Densmore added a
chapter on a summary of analysis to her book on British Columbian
music, awaiting publication.

Acknowledgment is made of the courtesy of Mrs. Laura Boulton
and Dr. George Herzog in providing the use of the Fairchild disk
recording apparatus on which Indian songs were recorded at the
Century of Progress Exposition.

EDITORIAL WORK AND PUBLICATIONS

The editing of the publications of the Bureau was continued
through the year by Stanley Searles, editor. In addition to the
current work of the office, considerable progress was made on com-
paring and correcting the comprehensive manuscript index of Bul-
letins 1-100 of the Bureau. Every entry is being verified.

An index of Schoolcraft’s work entitled “ Indian Tribes ”, in six
volumes, begun last year, is well advanced.

Bulletin 112, “An Introduction to Pawnee Archeology ”, by Waldo
Rudolph Wedel, was edited and prepared for printing; and work
has been done on other manuscripts in the custody of the editor.
Publications distributed totaled 11,955.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 37

LIBRARY

The reference library has continued under the care of Miss Ella
Leary, librarian. The library consists of 31,101 volumes, 17,189
pamphlets, and several thousand unbound periodicals. During the
year 400 books were accessioned, of which 47 were acquired by pur-
chase, the remainder being received through gift and exchange of
Bureau publications; also 94 pamphlets and 3,125 serials, chiefly
the publications of learned societies, were received and recorded.
Books loaned during the year numbered 1,069. In the process of
cataloging, 1,550 cards were added to the catalog files. Requisition
was made on the Library of Congress during the year for 140 vol-
umes for official use. This year, more than in previous years, advan-
tage was taken of the interlibrary loan service for books needed by
the staff.

As usual, hundreds of publications were consulted in the library
during the year by investigators and students, other than members
of the Smithsonian Institution. Individual contributors both at
home and abroad continued to show their interest by sending contri-
butions to the library.

APPENDIX 5
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the International Exchange Service during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1935:

The total appropriation made by Congress for the Service for
1935 was $41,188.17, of which amount $39,692 was included in the
regular appropriation act and $1,496.17 was allowed for the purpose
of restoring the remainder of the 15 percent economy reduction made
in salaries a few years ago. The above is an increase of $2,134.17 in
the amount granted for the exchanges during the fiscal year 1934.
The repayments from departmental and other establishments aggre-
gated $3,616.05, making the total resources available for conducting
the Service during the year $44,804.22.

The total number of packages that passed through the Service
during the year was 654,131, a decrease of 21,849. The weight was
560,381 pounds, a decrease of 64,360 pounds.

The publications sent and received are placed under three classes—
parliamentary documents, departmental documents, and miscellane-
ous scientific and literary publications. The number and weight of
packages containing the publications coming under these headings are
given in the table below.

The total number of boxes used in dispatching consignments
abroad was 2,187, a decrease of 155 from the preceding year. Of
these boxes, 460 were for the foreign depositories of full sets of

39
40 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

United States governmental documents and the remainder (1,727)
were for distribution to miscellaneous establishments and in-
dividuals.

In addition to the packages sent abroad in boxes, 58,878 packages
were transmitted directly to their destinations by mail.

In July 1934 a valuable consignment of exchanges, consisting of
eight boxes from New South Wales, was destroyed by fire and
water on the pier at New York. Five of the boxes contained pub-
lications requested by the Institution to complete the collections of
official documents of the Government of New South Wales in the
Library of Congress. These publications were procured by the
Public Library in Sydney, which conducts the Exchange Agency
for New South Wales. The Principal Librarian of the Public
Library has advised the Institution that he would keep the list of
wanted publications in hand and from time to time endeavor again
to obtain copies of as many of the documents as are available.

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

The full set of governmental publications sent to the American
Library in Paris has been discontinued, the number of full sets for-
warded abroad now being 61. There are 50 depositories of partial
sets, making the total number of full and partial sets 111.

Following is a list of full and partial sets of depositories:

INTERPARLIAMENTARY EXCHANGE OF THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL

During the year one additional foreign depository was added to
the list of those countries receiving the daily issue of the Congres-
sional Record, the depository being located in Albania.

The two chambers of the National Congress of Cuba having been
superseded by a Nationa] Assembly with a single chamber, only one
copy of the Record is now being forwarded to the Cuban Legislature
instead of two. The Records sent to Baden and Mecklenburg-
Strelitz were discontinued. There now are 102 copies of the Record
forwarded to foreign depositories, a complete list of which is given

About 2 o’clock almost every afternoon a census is made of the
cars parked on the Zoo grounds. During the year 53,877 were so
listed, representing every State in the Union, Hawaii, Philippine
Islands, Canal Zone, the Bahamas, Cuba, Alaska, Canada, and
Mexico. Since the total number is merely a record of those actually
parked at one time, it is not of value as indicating a total attendance
but is of importance as showing the percentage attendance by States,
Territories, and countries. The District of Columbia comprised only
a little over 32 percent; Maryland 14 percent; Virginia 5 percent, and
the remaining cars were from other States, Territories, and countries.

Fach year increased use is made of the Zoo’s facilities by students,
artists and modelers, for motion-picture photography, recording of
sounds made by animals for phonograph records, and other studies.
Numerous clubs and societies visit the Zoo as part of their programs.

IMPROVEMENTS

The outstanding improvements of the year were made possible by
funds from the Public Works Administration and labor and ma-
terials from the Emergency Works Administration.

On January 26, 1935, an allotment was made by the Public Works
Administration of $680,000 for the construction of a small mammal
house, a pachyderm house, an addition to the bird house, and
mechanical shops in the Zoo. Edwin H. Clarke, an architect who
has specialized in zoo construction, was engaged to take charge of
the designing and construction of these buildings. The work of
preparing plans and specifications for these structures was at once
started in the Office of the Supervising Architect with Mr. Clarke
consultant in charge. The completion of these projects will be one of
the most important single events in the history of the Zoo since its
foundation, for it will provide some of the structures most urgently
needed for many years.

The accomplishments with the Emergency Works Administration
men and materials were gratifying. For the most part, these con-
sisted of finishing work that was started and left incomplete when
the C. W. A. activities ceased at the end of March 1934, and the
carrying on of similar work. The more important pieces of work
completed were: Finishing of the mountain-sheep mountain and
erection of fence around it; completion of the condor cage; comple-
tion of a frame building 40 by 22 feet for the wild-horse group;
pouring of a concrete foundation for another similar building and
the moving of a previously built structure onto this foundation; fin-
ishing of the pouring of terrazzo floors in the lion house and the
grinding of terrazzo floors in the entire structure, including the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 55

erinding of drains in front of the cages; grinding of 75 linear feet of
terrazzo gutter in the floor of the bird house; completion of a stone
building 15 by 88 feet, roofing of same, construction of dens in the
building and cages outside for the housing of hardy outdoor animals
of medium size (this structure is known as the outdoor Cat House
and replaces a group of unsightly dilapidated cages formerly on this
site) ; construction of 800 linear feet of stone wall, grading and plant-
ing adjacent to the Cat House; construction of a concrete pool of
irregular shape 20 by 60 feet and 2 feet in depth, partially surrounded
by a shallow moat, low concrete wall and guard rail (for swans, cor-
morants, and pelicans), and planting of trees and shrubbery adjacent
thereto; construction of a stone wall to retain and protect the high
bluff at the south end of the eagle flight cage and planting of
shrubbery thereon; surfacing with broken concrete and stone of 2,500
square yards of hillside road excavated under C. W. A. and the
placing of 1,000 linear feet of Belgian block gutter at the edge of this
road; construction of two double and six single rustic drinking
fountains with terrazzo bowls and installation of these about the
park; considerable painting; grounds improvement consisting of
removal of perennial weeds from lawns, making of minor fills, seed-
ing with grass seed, removal of excess shrubbery, including an
intensive campaign against poison ivy, removal of dead trees and
limbs that were dangerous over about 100 acres of the park; planting
of a few trees and shrubs, with the result that the grounds are now
in much better condition than ever before.

Tn addition to the materials furnished by the E. W. A., materials
were purchased from park funds so far as possible for use by the
labor assigned by the E. W. A., and in this manner the accomplish-
ments were of much more lasting benefit than would otherwise have
been possible.

This opportunity is taken to place on record our keen appreciation
of the valuable and cordial assistance rendered by the District
K. W. A. officials, particularly Capt. Howard F. Clark and William
C. Cleary.

Through the cooperation of W. L. Corbin, Smithsonian librarian,
the Zoo was permitted to select from the considerable mass of sur-
plus publications accumulated by the Institution a large number of
volumes and pamphlets on vertebrate zoology that will be valuable
additions to the Zoo library. Also through his office, arrangements
were made with the officials of the Library of Congress for the Zoo
library to select a number of publications that will be useful. The
repairing, cataloging, accessioning, and filing of these publications
in the Zoo library remains to be done.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

Some of the greater needs in equipment for the Zoo have been
supplied through Public Works funds and the Federal Emergency
Relief Administration. There is still a need for more lberal ap-
propriations for the purchase of specimens; the Zoo has always
been handicapped by the small amount available for this purpose.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 7
REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1935:

This observatory comprises: (a) The central station at Washington
where apparatus is made and standardized; where reports are com-
puted, written, and published; where preparations for expeditions
are made; and where a general oversight is maintained of the field
stations. (0b) A station on Mount Wilson, near Pasadena, Calif.,
where brief expeditions for special researches go from time to time.
(c) A station on Table Mountain near Swartout, Calif., where daily
observations of the solar constant of radiation are carried on. (d)
A similar solar-constant station on Mount Montezuma, near Calama,
Chile. (e) A similar station on Mount St. Katherine near Mount
Sinai, Egypt. These stations are supported principally by annual
Government appropriations, but in a considerable part by private
funds.

REVISION OF SOLAR-CONSTANT METHODS

Records of daily observations at Mount St. Katherine since Decem-
ber 1933 being available, a complete reduction of them was under-
taken by the assistant director, L. B. Aldrich. Additional assistance
was generously made available under a grant from John A. Roebling,
so that at times as many as six computers assisted Mr. Aldrich in
this work. By these means he was able to compute numerous “ long
method ” values of the solar constant of radiation, base thereon a
suitable “short method ” of reduction, and compute so many values
by the short method as to show that the Egyptian station bids fair
to prove of high excellence. Although the complete computation of
all available days would not be finished before August 1935, Mr.
Roebling was so far pleased and satisfied with the results from Mount
St. Katherine, and so impressed with the need of this cooperating
station, that in June 1935 he made a further grant to finance its
occupation as a solar radiation station until 1988. At the same time
he provided for a revision and extension of “short method ” tables
for the stations at Montezuma, Chile, and Table Mountain, Calif.,
which will be undertaken as soon as the work of reduction for Mount
St. Katherine is completed. It is pleasant to recall that the project

57
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

of a station in the Old World was initiated under a grant from the
National Geographic Society. The outfit at Mount St. Katherine,
originally employed at Mount Brukkaros, Southwest Africa, is the
gift of the National Geographic Society.

Mr. Roebling also made it possible to send W. H. Hoover with
supplies to inspect the stations at Montezuma and Mount St. Kath-
erine, and to install there improved pyrheliometric apparatus. The
apparatus referred to is a specially constructed pyrheliometer of the
Angstrém type. It is to be read as often as possible during bolomet-
ric observations, and is to be calibrated daily, or nearly so, against
the Abbot silver-disk pyrheliometers heretofore used for daily solar
radiation observing. In this way the advantage of the smaller acci-
dental error of the Angstrém type instrument will be combined with
the long-continued stability of scale of the silver-disk pyrheliometer.
It is believed that the accuracy of the daily values of the solar con-
stant will be decidedly enhanced by this improved apparatus, and by
the revised short method tables. Mr. Hoover visited the Montezuma
station in February and March 1934, and will go out to Egypt in
September or October 1935. During his stay at Montezuma all parts
of the apparatus and methods were rechecked, and several improve-
ments were made,

The new apparatus above referred to was prepared by the observa-
tory instrument maker, A. Kramer, and the fine electrical devices
therein by L. B. Aldrich.

PERIODICITIES IN SOLAR VARIATION AND WEATHER

Studies of the periodicities which superposed make up the varia-
tion of the solar radiation were continued by Dr. Abbot, with the
assistance, as computer, of Miss L. B. Simpson, under a grant from
Mr. Roebling. Using the best available monthly mean values of the
solar constant from 1920 to 1934, inclusive, additional periodicities
of 934, 34, 3914, 92, and 276 months were found in the variation of
solar radiation besides the seven formerly discovered of 7, 8, 11, 21,
25, 46 and 68 months respectively. All 12 are approximately integral
submultiples of 23 years. A synthesis of these 12 periodic variations
in the solar radiation was made. The synthesis represents the origi-
nal values to within an average deviation of !%o9 of 1 percent.

Two 2-year forecasts of solar variation were prepared in 1930 and
1932, and were approximately verified by the event. The maxima
and minima were nearly correctly forecasted as to time, but the
curve of observation separated toward the end, as well as in 1932,
from the curve of forecast. These defects seem likely to be corrected
by the new analysis, and a forecast for 3 years in advance has been
ventured.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 59

Having so satisfactorily analyzed the variation of the sun, Dr.
Abbot has sought to detect the influence of the newly discovered
solar variations on weather. For this purpose he analyzed the pro-
longed records of departures from normal for temperature and
precipitation for the stations Helsingfors, Berlin, Copenhagen,
Greenwich, Cape Town, and Adelaide. Monthly mean departures
were computed from “World Weather Records” (recently pub-
lished by the Smithsonian Institution under grants from Mr. Roeb-
ling). For greater simplicity the departures were smoothed by
5-month traveling means. They were then analyzed to detect the solar
periodicities above listed, and any others which might be disclosed.

As a result Dr. Abbot was convinced that all the 12 solar period-
icities named above except that of 3914 months, and in addition sev-
eral others, viz, 18.6, 55, and 138 months, occur in both temperature
and precipitation at all stations investigated. But changes of phase
in the periodicities were found to occur occasionally. An important
regularity in these changes of phase was discovered. They are apt
to occur abruptly at times which are integral multiples of 1114
years, or still more frequently of 23 years after January 1819.

Having discovered the importance of the cycle of 23 years, both
as least common multiple of all periodicities disclosed in the varia-
tion of the sun and the weather, and also as a master key to changes
of phase in weather periodicities, the next step was to inquire if this
cycle appears in the levels of lakes and streams, the life cycles of
animals and plants, and in other terrestrial phenomena related to
weather. On investigation, the 23-year cycle was disclosed in the
level of the Nile for 600 years, the levels of the Great Lakes since
1837, the catch of cod and mackerel since 1812, the rainfall of south-
ern New England since 1750, the thickness of tree-rings in many
localities and over many centuries, and in varves of Pleistocene and
Kocene geologic time.

Finally, on plotting the temperature and precipitation of more
than 30 stations distributed over the United States, numerous detailed
features which appeared in a cycle of 23 years seemed to repeat
themselves, though with some modifications of phase and amplitude,
in successive cycles of 23 years. Assuming that this phenomena
will continue, forecasts for the 30 or more stations for 1934, 1935, and
1936 were prepared, based on the weather of the preceding half
century or more. The year 1934 has now elapsed, and the forecast
for that year has been compared with the event. The predictions for
1934 have been grouped in four grades of success in the forecasts
both of temperature and precipitation. They are: A, excellent, show-
ing a close accord throughout the year; B, good, nearly as satis-
factory; C, accordant half the time; D, bad, showing complete dis-
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

agreement. Of 66 forecasts, including 31 of temperature and 35 of
precipitation, 27 percent are of grade A, 42 percent of grade B, 17
percent of grade C, and 14 percent of grade D.

Reverting to the levels of the Great Lakes, not only the 23-year
cycles, but apparently the double cycle of 46 years is of great impor-
tance. It appears to be associated with the drought which has oc-
curred in the northwest-central States since about 1930. It is, of
course, plain that the low lake levels are subject to a lag of perhaps
3 years behind the drought conditions which cause them. Hence
recovery may be expected several years before the return of the lakes
to normal levels.

FIELD WORK

Observations of the solar radiation have gone on regularly at Table
Mountain, Calif., Montezuma, Chile, and Mount St. Katherine,
Egypt. Besides the solar observatories, Mr. Butler, field director
at Montezuma, at his own initiative, has continued for several years
highly valuable seismographic observations there in cooperation
with the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. Also, the as-
sistant at Montezuma, Mr. Maltby, has undertaken certain cosmic
ray work in cooperation with the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.

For several years the observers at Table Mountain, Calif., carried
on regular daily and nightly measurements of astronomical “ seeing ”
to assist in selecting the best location for the 200-inch telescope of
the California Institute of Technology. The “seeing” at Table
Mountain proved to be of the highest excellence. The observations
are now discontinued.

The expedition of Messrs. Abbot and Aldrich to Mount Wilson,
referred to in last year’s report, proved less successful than was at
first thought. The comparison of silver-disk pyrheliometers with
the standard water-flow instrument indeed was highly successful,
and a paper thereon has been published. But the investigation of
the extreme infrared solar spectrum, although incidentally leading
to a great improvement in the kampometer, a very sensitive radiation
instrument, requires further improvements of apparatus for success.
Observations were undertaken in cooperation with Dr. Joel Stebbins
on the energy spectra of the stars. In this experiment the stellar
spectral rays were selected by a battery of Christiansen filters, and
the intensities were measured by means of the Stebbins photoelectric
cell. Though apparently promising, the results were found to be
vitiated by stray light. This occurred because the photoelectric cell
is so disproportionately sensitive at certain wave lengths. It will
be necessary to substitute some other receiver, as for instance the
thermoelectric cell, if energy spectra of the stars are to be observed.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 61

PERSON NEL

No change has occurred in the regular personnel. Temporary com-
puters under Roebling grants have been employed, including the
Misses L. B. Simpson and Frances Holly, Mrs. F. E. Fowle, and E. S.
Chappell, Jr.

SUMMARY

Regular observations of the solar constant of radiation have been
continued daily when possible at Table Mountain, Calif., Monte-
zuma, Chile, and Mount St. Katherine, Egypt. Improvements in
instrumental equipment and in methods have been made tending to
increase the accuracy of the daily results. Reductions almost com-
pleted, including tables required in future reductions, have been com-
puted for Mount St. Katherine. They seem to indicate that the sta-
tion will be nearly, if not quite, on a par with our best station,
Montezuma. Through the generosity of John A. Roebling, it is ar-
ranged to continue the Mount St. Katherine station to 1938. Analy-
sis of solar variation since 1920 has revealed 12 periodicities, all
approximately aliquot parts of 23 years. Their summation repro-
duces the entire solar variation to an average agreement within 14
of 1 percent. These 12 periodicities, with three more not as yet
found in solar variation, but all approximately aliquot parts of 23
years, are found in temperature and precipitation records for six
terrestrial stations for the past century. Inversions and changes of
phase occur, but these are found to take place at integral multiples
of 1114 years measured from 1819. The 23-year cycle, which Hale
found in the magnetic polarity of sun spots, is found in the levels
of lakes and streams, the widths of tree-rings, the catches of ocean
fish, varves of Pleistocene and Eocene geologic age, and other phe-
nomena depending on weather. Numerous repetitive identifiable
features occur in temperature and precipitation within each 23-year
cycle. Forecasts of both elements for 1934, 1935, and 1936 for over
30 stations in the United States have been made. Satisfactory agree-
ment between forecasts and the events have been found for about
two-thirds of the stations during 1934. It has not been deemed wise
to publish the forecasts until further tested.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 8

REPORT ON THE DIVISION OF RADIATION AND
ORGANISMS

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the
activities of the Division of Radiation and Organisms during the
year ended June 30, 1935:

It is a pleasure to acknowledge further financial support for the
Division during the past year from the Research Corporation of
New York.

An important improvement of the Christiansen filters used for
selecting desired spectral rays for carrying on plant growth exper-
iments was perfected. The difficulty hitherto has been that when
powerful beams of white light enter a Christiansen filter, the central
parts of the filter, farthest from the control of the water jacket, rise
considerably above the temperature of control. This spoils the
selective properties of the filter and gives rise to a broad, indefinite
spectral band. The defect was remedied by inserting parallel with
the transmitted beam a grill of thin aluminum strips intimately in
contact with the outer wall of the filter. In this way, without much
loss of light, the excess heat at the center is conducted away and the
selective properties are greatly improved.

Christiansen filters thus equipped have been used to repeat exper-
iments on the dependence of the growth of algae and of wheat on
the wave length of radiation. In the experiments on wheat a
further improvement was made by setting up the great coelostat
referred to in the Smithsonian Report for 1903, constructing for
use with it a pair of very large Christiansen filters and using sun-
light in place of electric light, thus multiplying the available intensi-
ties. By controlling the temperature of the water jacket it was then
possible to select from the solar spectrum any desired color from
the extreme red to the deep violet.

With these improvements, studies of wave-length influence on the
growth of unicellular algae and on photosynthesis of wheat have
heen repeated with great success, much improving earlier results.
The study of the lethal effects of ultraviolet rays on unicellular algae
has also been repeated and carried to a wave length of 2,250
Angstroms, with highly accurate results. Further experiments in
phototropism are in progress, and new results of especial interest

62
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 63

seem to have been found. Growth of tomato plants under control
as to temperature, humidity, and color and intensity of radiation are
in progress. The interesting and important observation was made
that these plants require a resting period at cooler temperature as
well as darkness.

In cooperation with the United States Department of Agriculture,
experiments were made and published on the promotion and inhibi-
tion of the germination of seeds under different selected wave lengths
of light.

An experiment on the growth of wheat under out-of-door condi-
tions with controlled quantities of carbon dioxide was carried
through with satisfactory results.

Absorption spectral apparatus has been adjusted for use.

A number of papers embodying the results of all of the above-
mentioned experiments were published during the year, and others
are in preparation for publication.

Personnel.—No changes occurred, except that Dr. Enoch Karrer
was employed temporarily.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the Smithsonian library for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1935:

THE LIBRARY

The library of the Smithsonian Institution is in reality a library
system, for it is composed of 45 libraries, each related to the work
of the Institution as a whole or to that of one of its branches. Out-
standing among them in point of age, size, and importance of ma-
terial are the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress and
the libraries of the United States National Museum and the Bureau
of American Ethnology. The other members of the system are the
libraries of the Astrophysical Observatory, Freer Gallery of Art,
National Gallery of Art, National Zoological Park, the Langley
aeronautical library, radiation and organisms library, Smithsonian
office library, and the 35 highly specialized sectional libraries of the
National Museum. The libraries, taken together, number nearly
850,000 volumes, pamphlets, and charts.

PERSONNEL

Margaret Moreland, senior stenographer and secretary in the office
of the librarian, resigned to accept a position in New York. The
vacancy was filled by the transfer, from the examining division of
the Civil Service Commission, of Lucile A. Torrey, an A. B. from
Tulane University and a B. S. in library science from the Louisiana
State University, with stenographic training.

Grace A. Parler, who since 1930 had been on temporary appoint-
ment as under library assistant in the Freer Gallery of Art, was
made a permanent member of the staff and advanced in grade.

Bruce Middleton resigned the position of minor library assistant
in the Astrophysical Observatory to accept promotion in the Depart-
ment of Agriculture.

A temporary position of minor library assistant was established
in the National Zoological Park and filled for 3 months.

The temporary employees were Clarence Athearn, Alice Elizabeth
Hill, Margaret Link, Grace A. Parler, and Helen Rankin. There

64
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 65

were also for varying periods during the year several student assist-
ants, including one assigned to the library by the school of library
science of Simmons College, and a number of F. E. R. A. workers.

EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS

The exchange work of the library continued much as usual. The
number of packages, each of one or more publications, that came
by mail was 20,376—a gain of 332 over 1934; and through the In-
ternational Exchange Service, 1,880—a loss of 96. Of especial value
to the Smithsonian deposit and the library of the National Museum
were the sendings from the Arctic Institute, Leningrad; the Frank-
lin Institute, Philadelphia; the Peabody Museum, Cambridge; the
Geografsko Drustvo na Univerzi and Slovenska Matica, Ljubljana;
the Sociedad Cientifica Argentina, Buenos Aires; and the Tokyo
Geographical Society, Tokyo. Among the publications received
were 4,787 dissertations. These came from the Academy of Freiberg,
the universities of Basel, Berlin, Bern, Bonn, Breslau, Budapest,
Erlangen, Freiburg, Giessen, Greifswald, Halle, Heidelberg, Helsing-
fors, Jena, Johns Hopkins, Kiel, Konigsberg, Koln, Lund, Marburg,
Pennsylvania, Rostock, Tiibingen, Utrecht, and Ziirich; and tech-
nical schools at Berlin, Braunschweig, Delft, Dresden, Karlsruhe,
and Ziirich. The number of letters written was 2,185. The library
arranged for 264 new exchanges—26 more than the year before—
and obtained 6,728 publications—an increase of 2,614 over 1934—
especially requested by the various libraries of the Institution.
Many of these items, however, it should be explained, were found
among the Smithsonian duplicates.

GIFTS

As usual, there were many gifts. Prominent among them was a
copy of the Yellow Book of Lecan, edited by Robert Atkinson, from
the Royal Irish Academy. Others were Corpus Doctrinae Christianae

Many publications were received from Mrs. Charles D. Walcott,
and 22 volumes of a miscellaneous character from Mrs. George Cabot
Lodge. Other gifts included 1,221 publications from the Geophysical
Laboratory, 657 from the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, several hundred from the Library of Congress,
and a number from the Department of State, Department of Com-
merce, Pan American Union, American Association of Museums,
and Anthropological Society, Biological Society, and Helmintho-
logical Society of Washington. The largest gift, however, came
from the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, which late
in the year turned over to the library about 7,000 publications, chiefly
scientific serials, embracing more than 100 titles and not a few long
runs. These will be of great value to the library, especially as they
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 67

contain many items that are lacking in its sets. Gifts also came
from Secretary Abbot, Assistant Secretary Wetmore, and the fol-
lowing other members and associates of the scientific staff: Dr.
Paul Bartsch, Dr. R. S. Bassler, Dr. A. G. Boving, August Busck,
A. H. Clark, H. B. Collins, W. L. Corbin, F. E. Fowle, Dr. Herbert
Friedmann, L. C. Gunnell, Dr. Walter Hough, Dr. Ale’ Hrdlicka,

G. S. Myers, A. J. Olmsted, R. G. Paine, Dr. Mary J. Rathbun, and
Dr. Waldo Schmitt.

SMITHSONIAN DEPOSIT

The Smithsonian deposit is the main library of the Institution.
The collection was kept at the Smithsonian until 1866 when, under a
special act of Congress, it was deposited in the Library of Congress,
where it has steadily grown, by regular additions from the Institu-
tion, from 40,000 volumes, pamphlets, and charts to 540,000. It is
distributed among the various divisions of the Library according to
the nature of the material, but, as the deposit is largely scientific and
technical in character and abounds in the reports, proceedings, and
transactions of the learned institutions and societies of the world
and in periodicals, both American and foreign, it is shelved for the
most part in the Smithsonian and Periodical Divisions. It is the
great central collection on which the other libraries of the Institution
rely almost daily for necessary publications, many of which can be
obtained nowhere else in Washington and some in few other places
in America.

To the deposit the Smithsonian library added during the fiscal
year just closed 16,500 items, consisting of 2,639 volumes, 9,148 parts
of volumes, 3,128 pamphlets, and 1,585 maps and charts. As in
former years, several thousand statistical documents that the library
received from foreign governments were forwarded, mainly un-
opened, to the Division of Documents in the Library of Congress.

NATIONAL MUSEUM LIBRARY

Next in importance to the deposit, among the libraries of the
Smithsonian Institution, is the library of the United States National
Museum. At the close of the year it numbered 88,377 volumes and
112,693 pamphlets, chiefly on natural history and technology. The
additions were 11,321 publications, or 1,639 volumes, 8,697 parts of
volumes, 980 pamphlets, and 5 charts. The staff sent 101 volumes
to the bindery, recorded 8,709 periodicals, cataloged 2,592 publica-
tions, and added 21,896 cards to the main catalogs and shelf lists.

36923—36—6
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

They filed 469 cards of the Wistar Institute and 3,774 of the Concil-
ium Bibliographicum, besides sorting 8,871 of the latter for the
subject files of the curators. They assigned to the sectional libraries
4,233 current publications—as well as 6,512 reprints that had accumu-
lated over a period of years—and lent to the scientific staff 9,636, of
which 2,489 were borrowed from the Library of Congress, especially
the Smithsonian deposit, and 442 from other libraries, including 15
from outside of Washington. They made 486 loans to other libra-
ries—an increase of 326 over the year before. They also assisted the
libraries of the Bureau of American Ethnology, National Gallery
of Art, and National Zoological Park, and advanced materially the
work of reorganizing the general collection on technology and the
special collections on administration and engineering in the old
Museum. The requests for reference and bibliographical service
were more numerous than usual and frequently required hours and
even days of research not only in the Museum library but in the
Library of Congress and elsewhere.

The sectional libraries, which number 35, were not changed during
the year. They are as follows:

Administration Invertebrate paleontology
Administrative assistant’s office Mammals

Agricultural history Marine invertebrates
Anthropology Medicine

Archeology Minerals

Biology Mollusks

Birds Organic chemistry
Botany Paleobotany
Echinoderms Photography

Editor’s office Physical anthropology
Engineering Property clerk’s office
Ethnology Reptiles and batrachians
Fishes Superintendent’s office
Foods Taxidermy

Geology Textiles

Graphie Arts Vertebrate paleontology
History Wood technology

Insects

OFFICE LIBRARY

The Smithsonian office library is shelved partly in or near the
offices of the administrative staff and in the main reference and
exhibition rooms of the Institution, and partly in the library of
the old Museum. It numbers approximately 30,000 items and com-
prises, in addition to an extensive collection of works of general
reference and publications of learned institutions and societies, a
small rare-book collection, several important special collections on
history and the natural sciences, and many books and periodicals
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 69

of less scholarly interest designed primarily for the home hours of
the employees.

The additions to the library in 1935 were 240 volumes, 773 parts
of volumes, and 22 pamphlets. The staff entered 3,448 periodicals,
prepared and filed 1,683 catalog cards, classified 3,665 aeronautical
clippings and mounted 1,415, made 146 cards for the aeronautical
file, received 2,252 visitors, and loaned 2,954 publications, These
statistics include some for the technological library of the National
Museum, inasmuch as both collections are served, for the most part,
by the same library attendants.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY LIBRARY

The library of the Bureau of American Ethnology concerns itself
chiefly with the primitive peoples of the Western Hemisphere, nota-
bly the North American Indians. It consists of 31,101 volumes
and 17,189 pamphlets, besides important manuscripts, vocabularies,
znd photographs. It was increased during the year by 400 volumes
and 94 pamphlets. The staff cataloged 788 publications, recorded
3,125 periodicals, added 3,865 cards to the catalog, made 1,069 loans,
and rendered even more than usual reference and bibliographical
service to the scientists of the Bureau and other investigators. The
regular attendants had the assistance at different times during the
year of two trained employees from other libraries of the Institu-
tion, who advanced materially the preparation of cards for the
Bureau’s catalog, as well as for the union catalog of the Smith-
sonian, and began the checking of the sets of society publications,
with a view to obtaining needed numbers by exchange while they
are still available; 81 of these were found in the duplicate collection
of the Institution.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY LIBRARY

The library of the Astrophysical Observatory deals largely with
meteorology and astrophysics. Its accessions of 57 volumes, 1,033
parts of volumes, and 75 pamphlets increased the collection during
the fiscal year to 4,624 volumes and 3,903 pamphlets. The number
of cards added to the catalog was 1,633. The loans were 127.

RADIATION AND ORGANISMS LIBRARY

The library of radiation and organisms, the youngest and smallest
unit in the Smithsonian library system, is a collection of 207 vol-
umes, 14 pamphlets, and 6 charts pertaining mainly to the radiation
ef the sun and its effect on plant and animal life. It was increased
in 1935 by 6 volumes, 224 parts of volumes, and 2 pamphlets.
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

LANGLEY AERONAUTICAL LIBRARY

The Langley aeronautical library is the Institution’s well-known
collection of aeronautical publications, which was brought together
in the first instance by Samuel Pierpont Langley, and later increased
by gifts from Alexander Graham Bell, Octave Chanute, and James
Means, and since by regular additions from the Smithsonian. In
1930 most of the library was sent as a special deposit to the Library
of Congress, where, under its own name and bookplate, it supple-
ments in important respects for research purposes the Government’s
chief collection. The library has 2,009 volumes, 1,179 pamphlets,
and 29 charts. Among its items are many early aeronautical maga-
zines, as well as manuscripts, photographs, and newspaper clippings.
The accessions in 1935 were 31 volumes, 538 parts of volumes, and
51 pamphlets. In response to special requests from the division of
aeronautics in the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian library ob-
tained 78 publications needed in the Langley sets.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

The library of the National Gallery of Art has no regular trained
attendant. The staff of the Smithsonian and Museum libraries, as-
sisted by several F. E. R. A. workers, however, were able to keep up
most of the current work of the library to continue, in a measure,
the task of bringing together and cataloging its collections, which
was begun several years before. The accessions were 316 volumes
and 3806 pamphlets, which increased the library to 2,447 volumes and
2,030 pamphlets. The staff entered 1,621 periodicals, cataloged 672
publications, added 2,341 cards to the catalog and shelf list, prepared
543 cards for other files, and labeled 668 books. Of the accessions,
142 were obtained by special exchange correspondence. Toward the
close of the year, 1,935 publications were transferred to the library
from the section of administration in the National Museum.

FREER GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

The library of the Freer Gallery of Art received further expert
attention in 19385. Consequently by the close of the fiscal year the
dictionary catalog, which had been begun several years before, was
finished to date, except for a number of the Chinese and Japanese
items. The staff cataloged 225 publications, prepared 3,018 cards
for the library files, as well as 658 for the union catalog at the
Smithsonian Institution, and sent 19 volumes to the bindery. The
main collection, which numbers 5,297 volumes and 3,521 pamphlets,
was increased by 826 volumes, 170 parts of volumes, and 56 pam-
phlets; the field collection by 369 volumes, 627 parts of volumes, 103
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY rial

pamphlets, and 69 maps. The latter, which had been for some years
in China, where until recently the Freer was carrying on important
archeological investigations, was brought back to Washington and
deposited in the Gallery. During its sojourn abroad it grew consid-
erably and now numbers 1,920 volumes, 640 pamphlets, and 69 maps.
Together the two collections, which relate almost entirely to the
chief interests of the Freer—namely, the art and culture of the Far
East, India, Persia, and the nearer East, and the activities of certain
American painters, notably James McNeill Whistler, many of whose
works are owned by the Gallery—contain not a few rare items and
supplement to an important degree the collections at the Library of
Congress, particularly those in the manuscript, fine arts, and orien-
tal divisions. The treasures of the library are, of course, the
“Washington Manuscripts” of the Bible, dating from the fourth
and fifth centuries.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK LIBRARY

The library of the National Zoological Park comprises 1,412 vol-
umes and 1,962 pamphlets chiefly on the care, study, and exhibition
of wild animals. ‘The accessions in 19385 were 82 volumes, 107 parts
of volumes, and 102 pamphlets. Besides these, 2,394 publications of
special interest to the scientists of the Park were selected late in
the year from the duplicates at the Smithsonian Institution and the
Library of Congress and will in due time be made part of the col-
lection. The number of cards added to the catalog was 540. Two
trained assistants were employed for brief periods during the year.

SUMMARY OF ACCESSIONS

The accessions for the fiscal year may be summarized as follows:

These accessions, together with the additions represented by the
Freer field collection, incident to its being brought to Washington
and given a place in the library of the Gallery, increased the ap-
72 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

proximate number of publications in the library system of the Insti-
tution to the following:

This total does not, of course, include the many thousands of
volumes that are not yet completed, bound, or cataloged.

SPECIAL ACTIVITIES

Besides meeting the current demands, the staff continued several
important undertakings left over from the C. W. A. days, and en-
gaged in two or three new ones, related to the general work of re-
organizing the Smithsonian library system that was begun some
years ago. In carrying out these special projects, it was assisted
by a number of F. E. R. A. workers, who were assigned to the Insti-
tution for different periods during the year.

Among the projects, two were outstanding. The work of sorting
and arranging the foreign scientific and technical duplicates in the
west stacks of the Smithsonian Building and labeling the shelves of
the entire collection, both American and foreign, was carried toward
completion. One result of this undertaking was that, of the 6,728
publications especially requested during the year by the libraries
of the Institution, about 40 percent were found in this collection.
It is expected that as the checking of the standard sets in the libraries
goes on, thousands more of the items lacking will be available here.
Another result was that it was possible for the Smithsonian library
to cooperate, to the extent of more than 1,100 numbers, with the
American Association for the Advancement of Science in its en-
deavor to form a set of the publication Science for its office use—a
slight return for the many generous gifts that the Association has
made to the library in recent years; it was also possible for the
library to present 283 numbers of the Journal of the Washington
Academy of Sciences, as suggested by the Library of Congress, to
the Akademiia Nauk, Leningrad, to help that institution fill out
its set. Still another result was that substantial runs of various
important serials were assembled, to be filed later in the reserve
section of the library for use either to reinforce the main sets or to
replace them when they are worn out.

The second outstanding project was the sorting and reassignment
of the contents of the sectional libraries of administration and en-
gineering. The material no longer needed by the officials concerned
was disposed of in various ways. The work of taking inventory and
arranging the items to be retained in the sections was also undertaken.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 73

Another activity of considerable importance was the careful ex-
amination of a large accumulation of maps—the second to be treated
in. this manner the last few years—with the result that about 500
were chosen for the Museum lbrary and 1,576 sent to the Smith-
sonian deposit, where they would be of service in completing the
files of the Library of Congress and still be available to the scientists
of the Institution as well as to investigators outside.

Among other activities a few should be mentioned. Special send-
ings of duplicates were made to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Brown,
the University of Pennsylvania, Vanderbilt, and the Marine Biolog-
ical Laboratory at Woods Hole, and 150 or more publications, both
old and new, which were needed by the National Museum and the
National Gallery of Art, were obtained in exchange; about 20,000
publications, many of them Government documents, not required
by the library, were sent back to the issuing bureaus or transferred
to various Federal libraries; 2,750 returned publications of the Smith-
sonian and its branches were checked and 351 found that were needed
in the library sets; the dictionary index of Smithsonian publica-
tions was kept up to date, and considerable progress was made on
the index of exchange relations; the union catalog was also advanced,
as the following table will show:

CONCLUSION

The year, then, was one of noteworthy progress, despite the re-
grettable fact that it was again found necessary, owing to economic
conditions, to curtail the funds, almost to the vanishing point, cus-
tomarily allotted to the library for binding and for the employment
of extra trained assistants.

Respectfully submitted.

FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Early in 1906, by deed of gift, Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, gave
to the Institution his collection of Chinese and other oriental objects
of art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art by
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 83

Whistler, Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also gave
funds for the construction of a building to house the collection, and
finally, in his will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock
and securities to the estimated value of $1,958,591.42 as an endow-
ment fund for the operation of the gallery. From the above date
to the present time these funds have been increased by stock divi-
dends, savings of income, etc., to a total of $4,769,362.53. In view
of the importance and special nature of the gift and the require-
ments of the testator in respect to it, all Freer funds are kept sepa-
rate from the other funds of the Institution, and the accounting in
respect to them is stated separately.
The invested funds of the Freer bequest are classified as follows:

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1935

89
ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Grenrrat Appenprx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific
discovery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such
papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific
progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely
the prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy,
geology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zool-
ogy, and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not
altogether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them origi-
nal) embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and
discussion. This method has been continued in the present report
for 1935.

WEATHER GOVERNED BY CHANGES IN THE
SUN’S RADIATION

By C. G. ABBor
Secretary, Smithsonian Institution

[With 1 plate]

It is now nearly 20 years since the Smithsonian Institution began
to observe daily, whenever possible, the intensity of the rays of the
sun. These studies have been continued first at the city of Calama,
in northern Chile, and since 1920 by the generous aid of John A.
Roebling, at Montezuma, a mountain 9,000 feet high about 12 miles
south of Calama. Plate 1 shows the barren location at Montezuma.
Neither bird nor beast, shrub nor tree, grass nor desert plant, in-
sect nor creeping thing (except the ubiquitous house fly) can exist
in this waterless desert. The great naturalist Darwin, in his journal
entitled “The Voyage of the Beagle”, relates that he rode all day in
that Desert of Atacama seeing no live thing except some flies feast-
ing on the body of a dead mule. In such a place our observers de-
votedly measure and compute about 9 hours each day for a 3-year
period before being relieved. Water and provisions they must haul
by auto from Calama, 12 miles distant.

Two other Smithsonian solar stations are in occupation. One is in
a still more desolate and remote location, Mount St. Katherine, 8,500
feet in elevation, 10 miles from the ancient monastery of St. Kath-
erine on Mount Sinai in Egypt. The other, at 7,500 feet elevation,
overlooks the Mojave Desert in California. But here trees, water
and easy accessibility relieve the lonely plight of the observers.

At these desert mountain stations, where rain seldom falls, it is
possible to observe the sun through cloudless sky on upward of
75 percent of all days. The great majority of dwellers on low ground
and in the cities have never in their lives seen such blue, cloudless,
and limpid sky as these stations afford. They have been chosen after
much research, travel, and actual testing. For to measure the rays
of the sun in such a way as to be able to eliminate the losses its beam
suffers in passing through our atmosphere, so as to determine the real
emissive power of the sun, is a task of extreme difficulty, even under
ideal sky conditions, and is impossible otherwise.

ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

It is not sufficient to measure the solar
rays as a whole. They must be resolved
into their spectrum in order to evaluate
the losses from water vapor, ozone, and
other atmospheric absorbents. The spec-
trum includes not only the seven familiar
colors as described by Sir Isaac Newton,
but beyond the violet and beyond the red
lie long regions, dark to our eyes, but
containing a substantial proportion of the
energy of the solar beam. To measure all
these rays we use the bolometer, invented
by Langley. It is an electrical thermom-
eter so sensitive that a millionth of a
degree of heat is easily measured by it.

Observations with the bolometer and
other instruments occupy the observers
for about 3 hours each morning. From 5
to 8 hours of computing follow before
they are ready to send their telegram to
Washington, announcing their result for
the intensity of the solar rays on that day.
The measures are expressed in heat units
called calories. The calorie is the amount
of heat required to warm a gram of
water 1° C. Those more familiar with
English units may recall that there are
about 28 grams in 1 ounce, and 1° C.=
1°.8 F. The intensity of solar radiation
as it is in free space just outside our at-
mosphere at mean solar distance is found
to fluctuate about a mean value of 1.94
calories per square centimeter per minute.

Having now accumulated for more than
15 years measures of the solar emission
(which has long been called the “solar
constant ”, though as we shall see it is
variable), we have examined its variations
to detect periodicities. This search has
now revealed 12 periodicities by the com-
bination of which the sun’s heat available
to warm the earth fluctuates through sev-
eral percent. Figure 1 illustrates this
fluctuation since 1920, as far as it appears

in the 10-day mean values. There are, indeed, quicker solar varia-
tions which run their courses in a few days, and these are believed
to have important effects on weather, but the study of them must
be deferred until steps now being taken somewhat increase the ac-
curacy of our daily observations. In mean values covering 10 days,
or better still 1 month, the daily errors, some being plus, some minus,
are largely smoothed away.

Figure 2 shows the monthly mean solar-constant values since 1920
analyzed to yield the 12 periodicities above referred to. In making
the analysis the data are treated in several separate parcels for all
the periodicities of 25 months and less, so as to see if the earlier and
later years agree in presenting similarly the periodicity in question.
In illustration, I call attention to the periodicity of 11 months, for
which the results of three partial analyses of 5 years each are first
shown. At the bottom of that series a heavier line gives the general
mean for 15 years. A fair agreement between the three 5-year
intervals is apparent. However, as all the periodicities, and the
accidental errors besides, are confused in the original data, it is not
possible to separate perfectly and determine accurately the indi-
vidual periodicities as well as one would like to do. Especially for
the longer periodicities, of 834 months and over, the determinations
of the curves are imperfect because in 15 years there are so few
repetitions of them.

Curve B is the summation of the 12 periodicities indicated by the
heavy lines at the bottom of figure 2. When compared with the
original curve of observation A, it is apparent that a very good fit
has been obtained. Not only major changes such as that of 1922, but
minor details in the curve of observation A are closely repeated in the
synthetic curve B. In fact, the average departure between curves A
and B over the 180 months covered by curve A, figure 2, is less than
one-fifth of 1 percent. This is really a surprisingly good result and
les, indeed, within the accidental error of the observations.

It seems apparent, therefore, that the emission of the sun varies,
and that its variation is the complex result of the simultaneous exist-
ence of at least a dozen periodic terms. But what adds decidedly to
the interest of this conclusion is a fact that happened to be noticed
after many of the periodicities had been found. It is this: They
are all approximately integral submultiples, or, as we should say in
arithmetic, aliquot parts of 23 years. For 23 years is 276 months,
which divided by the numbers 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 18, 25, 28, 34, and
39, gives, respectively: 23 years, 92, 68, 46, 39%, 34, 251, 21%, 11%s,
9%, 8%7, and 7%; months.

If 274 months rather than 276 had been chosen as the least common
denominator, the series of numbers just given would certainly have
96 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

fitted within the error of determination with the lengths of the
periods given in figure 2. It is not to be supposed that the period of
the fundamental solar fiuctuation, whatever its cause, has any exact
relationship to the year or the month, but it is probably a period of
time lying somewhere between 272 and 276 months.

It is interesting to remember that nearly 30 years ago Dr. George
E. Hale discovered magnetism in sun spots. It has been observed
ever since. The curious fact has been observed that the magnetism

Ficurp 3.—Predicted and observed solar variation. The maxima and minima occur in
the two curves at nearly identical phases. The observed curve may be faulty in 1932
owing to the Chilean voleanic eruption. The separation of the curves toward the
end is due to a 23-year periodicity not taken account of.

of sun spots reverses its sign approximately each 111% years, so that
approximately 23 years are required to carry the sun through a com-
plete magnetic cycle. Also, it has been well known for over a cen-
tury that sun spots fluctuate in prevalence with a period which is
irregular, but averages about 1114 years. The irregularity of the
sun-spot cycle is, however, large, ranging from 8 to 16 years, so that
the discrepancy between the usually preferred period, 111% years,
and the half of 23 years is not perhaps significant.

As we well know, a violin string, for instance the A string above
middle C of the scale, vibrates in a fundamental and many har-
WEATHER GOVERNED BY THE SUN—ABBOT 97

monics at the same time. The harmonics are, indeed, the sources
of the distinguishing quality of the violin sound. The sun’s radia-
tion seems to behave similarly. But it is not clear why the sun,
a great ball of compressed hot gas, should vibrate in a fundamental
and numerous harmonics, as a violin string or a bell does. Though
the cause is obscure, it is believed that the fact is demonstrated.
So confident of it was I, that in 1930, and again in 1982, though not
then in possession of analyses of the solar variation as satisfactory
as figure 2, I ventured to forecast publicly for 2 years in advance the
solar variation. Figure 3 shows these forecasts and the event. It
will be seen that maxima and minima fall about at the times ex-
pected, but that the fit is by no means so close as in figure 2. This
was due to the lack, at the time of those predictions, of the more
recent discovery of the terms of 34, 3914, 92, and 276 months.

Everyone is aware that the weather is in the main controlled by
the earth’s relation to the sun. Our alternate exposure to the sun
and to dark space by the daily rotation of the earth produces day
and night, with their warming and cooling. Revolution about. the
sun in a plane 2314° out of the plane of the Equator causes the
sun to appear far south in January and far north in July, with
attendant cooling and warming of the Northern Hemisphere. ‘The
ellipticity of the earth’s orbit removes us to 3,000,000 miles farther
from the sun in July than in January, and causes the sun’s heat
upon the earth to be 6 percent more intense in January than in
July. This tends to make winters in the Northern Hemisphere more
mild, and in the Southern Hemisphere more severe than otherwise
they would be. All these effects are well known. We may now
inquire whether the recently discovered variation of the sun’s emis-
sion is also of sufficient importance to affect the weather.

We have studied this question in many ways. In the Smith-
sonian publication called “ World Weather Records” are given
monthly mean temperatures and precipitations for several hundred
stations in many countries. Some of these stations, as, for instance,
Helsingfors, Berlin, Copenhagen, Greenwich, Capetown, and Ade-
laide, present observations covering nearly, or quite, a century The
records of all the cities just named were studied. To avoid per-
plexing details, the original monthly mean observations were
smoothed by 5-month traveling means. For instance, for March use

98 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

The analysis of these records was very laborious, involving thou-
sands of pages of tabular matter. As a result, however, every
periodicity found in the solar variation, except one of 3914 months,
was also found in the departures from normal temperature and pre-
cipitation at all these stations. In addition, periodicities of 12, 13.6,
55, and 138 months were discovered. These, like the solar periodici-
ties, are also appreximately aliquot parts of 23 years, being closely
represented, respectively, by 23 years divided by 23, 20, 5, and 2.
These relationships hold within the limits of accuracy to which the
periods are determinable.

The magnitudes of the periodicities in temperature ranged from
0°.2 to 1°.5 C. (0°.4 to 2°.7 F.), and in precipitation from 20 to
300 percent of normal. But though so large as to be obvious, the
periodicities in weather in no case continued in the same phase
throughout the entire intervals of from 60 to 110 years over which
the several investigations extended. On the contrary they often
abruptly reversed in phase, so that the part of a peried which had
consistently been a maximum for many years suddenly changed into
a minimum and so continued for many years to follow.

By a very lucky observation it was discovered that there is a
saving regularity about these abrupt changes of phase. For if we
take January 1819 as a time of departure, we find that the changes
of phase tend to occur at integral multiples of 1114 years measured
from that date. This is the case at all stations employed, and both
for temperature and precipitation.

Vigure 4 gives for Berlin the 11-month and the 21-month periodic-
ities in temperature departures. For each of these two periodic-
ities there are shown curves which express the results arising from
successive intervals of about 1114 years from 1819 to 1930. In the
case of the 11-month periodicity the forms of the curves evidently
occur in pairs, so that for each 23 years at a time the temperature
follows a single law in its 11-month periodicity. However, in the
case of the 21-month curves, changes of form generally occur each
1114 years, theugh with some exceptions, as from 1841 to 1864, when
for 23 years there is no marked change.

Figure 5 shows how very abrupt is the change from one form to
its inverse. In the upper part of the figure are given two curves
relating to the 11-month period at Berlin, representing respectively
the last 22 months prior to December 1841 and the first 22 months
following that date. Even in details the two curves are opposite.
The first gives its maximum at the fifth month, just like the first
two curves in figure 4, while the second curve of figure 5 gives its
minimum at the sixth month, just like the second pair of curves in

figure 4. A similarly abrupt inversion is shown at the bottom of
figure 5 relating to the 21-month periodicity. The third curve
represents the 44 months ending with June 1864, and the lowest
curve represents the 44 months beginning July 1864, The inversion,
even in details, is marked, and the similarity to the corresponding
mean curves covering 1114 years each in figure 4 is obvious.

As another illustration, figure 6, I give the departures from the
normal of 110 years in the 12-month periodicity in the temperature
of Berlin. As the 12-month periodicity is primarily due to the
yearly revolution of the earth in its orbit around the sun, no one
would have anticipated that the departures from its normal course
would be governed by the 23-year cycle. Yet observe in figure 6
how the curves of 12-month periodic departures from normal tem-
perature at Berlin go in pairs, each pair covering 23 years beginning
1819, and how the phases change sharply at the conclusion of each
93-year interval. Finally in figure 7 I give a complete analysis of
the temperature departures at Cape Town. The phase changes are
very obvious.

Having discovered that the periodicities of solar variation were
also found in weather, and that all were integrally related to 23
years, both as to period and as to change of form or phase, it
seemed to us appropriate to search for the 23-year cycle itself in
weather and in phenomena closely related to the weather. Figures
8 to 13 show the effects of this cycle in the level of the Nile, in the
levels of the Great Lakes, in the catches of mackerel and cod in the
Atlantic, in the width of tree rings, and even in the thickness of
varves or layers formed by the yearly settling of sediment in glacial
lakes in Pleistocene geologic age.

But perhaps most interesting of all is the 23-year cycle in ordinary
weather. Figure 14 shows a plot of the smoothed monthly mean
percentage precipitation at Peoria, Ill., and figure 15 a similar plot
of monthly mean percentage precipitation at Nagpur in central
India. In figure 14 various features have been marked with letters
to show their approximate repetition at successive intervals of 23
years. Besides these small details the reader may trace some prin-
cipal trends of the successive curves which show much similarity 23
years apart. In figure 15 note that in 1865, 1868, and 1870 there are
three pillarlike features of high percentage precipitation bounding
two features of subnormal precipitation. Thus there stand out
two intervals of 3 and 2 years, respectively, as if guarded by these
sentinal features, but embracing besides nearly ascore of subordinate
features. The reader’s attention is now invited to similar features,
1888-93, and 1912-17, in which nearly all the details are recognizable.

Doubtless readers will wish to inquire whether it is reasonable that
periodicities of small amplitude in solar variation, such as those
shown in figure 2, are competent to produce temperature changes
as large as those found. In the following table, I give a percentage
analysis of this question. Unconsciously, when we think of the
temperature, we base it approximately on the zero of the ordinary
thermometer, so that a change of 5° F. seems to us as if it were a
change of 5 percent or more in temperature. Really we should con-
sider the temperature as measured from the absolute zero. This is
—273° of the Centigrade scale and —523°.4 F. Thus a Fahrenheit
temperature of 70° is really 593°.4 Absolute, and a change of 5° is
only about 1 percent in temperature.

The table shows that though the ranges of the periodic changes
in solar radiation are all less than 1 percent, so too are almost all the
corresponding changes in temperature. Indeed, if measured in per-
centages, the temperature changes average but from one-third to
nine-tenths as great as the changes in solar radiation. On the whole,
the relationship does not seem unreasonable and leads us to the
remarkable conclusion that an important and perhaps a major part
of the departures from normal, which make up weather as distin-
guished from climate, originate in these newly discovered variations
in the radiation of the sun. If so it is clear that long range weather
prediction is impossible if based solely on the earth’s conditions,
excluding solar variation as a factor.

SEASONAL WEATHER AND ITS PREDICTION’

By Sm Giugert T. Waker, C. S. IL, F. R. S.

I have chosen the subject of seasonal weather for my address,
because its economic importance is obvious to most men who have
lived in the Tropics, and its scientific problems are full of interest.
Unfortunately there is an additional motive, the need of warning
against dangers ahead. For the difficulties of long-range forecast-
ing are not in general adequately recognized, so that some of the
most progressive countries in the world are inclined to make pre-
dictions on an insecure basis; their technical staff does not realize
that though the prestige of meteorology may be raised for a few
years by the issue of seasonal forecasts, the harm done to the science
will inevitably outweigh the good if the prophecies are found un-
reliable. We only learn from experience that while the forecasting
efforts of a charlatan are judged by their occasional successes, it is
the occasional failures of a government department which are re-
membered against it.

In a country where conditions are as changeable from day to day
as they are here, it is natural that we should think in terms of wet
or fine days rather than of wet or dry periods; but in the greater
part of our empire the different seasons are much more sharply
defined, and so their dominant features stand out more clearly. Also
the variability of their seasons is in general materially greater than
here. Thus, in the annual rainfall measurements of the last half
century the smallest rainfall of Great Britain has been 23 percent
below normal; but that of large areas in South Africa has been in
defect by 40 percent, in northeast Australia by 50 percent, and in
the Punjab by as much as 58 percent, or two and a half times that
of this country.

Now, a season that is unusual seems to have some abnormal factor
permanently at work diverting the weather from its ordinary course;
in India I found, when issuing the daily forecast in a dry winter,

1 Presidential address before the section of mathematical and physical sciences, British
Association for the Advancement of Science. Reprinted by permission from the Report
of the Association for 1933.

117
118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

that I had at times to predict no rain, when with identical condi-
tions as shown by the weather map I should in a wet winter have
predicted a widespread fall. Even in England, in winter, there
is an appreciable persistence in the characteristics: During the last
60 years the 15 wettest Januarys were followed by Februarys of
more than average rainfall in 10 cases; and with dry Januarys also
there is a similar two-to-one chance of a prolongation of the char-
acter. It is this persistence, especially when it is preceded by
abnormal features in other regions, that seems now to hold out most
promise of reliability in forecasting. In agricultural countries in
which a failure of the rains involves a national calamity, the desir-
ability of making preparations in advance has long ago led to efforts
at prediction; and the demand has been so great that the supply has
been forthcoming before its quality would bear the most cursory
examination. The causes of unusual weather seem hopelessly ob-
scure to the layman; and hence primitive ideas, surviving in the
depth of our natures from countless ages of magical practices, still
come to the surface in connection with it. In India I have been
officially asked what is the need of an expensive and difficult scien-
tific inquiry into the causes of drought when Hindu astrology will
indicate what is coming; and many a country that claims to be dom-
inated by western science fails to recognize that events in weather
obey the ordinary laws of physics and chemistry. The almost uni-
versal idea that weather must repeat itself after a certain number
of years finds its origin, I believe, ultimately in the ancient belief in
the control of our affairs by the heavenly bodies with their definite
cycles—a belief which clearly shows itself in the supposed influence
of the moon on the weather. Be that as it may, the faith in periods
is so deep-seated that even in scientific discussions the ordinary tests
for validity are very often ignored: More than once I have seen in
journals of repute the artless remark of an author that if he were
to limit his results to those which would satisfy the criteria of reality
he would obtain few results of interest.

Another regrettable feature of current practice, even in important
memoirs, is that of classing together processes with true periods and
those sometimes called “ quasi-periodic ”, of which the period varies.
If our ideas are to be applied with success in the present enterprise
their currency must be stabilized, and no good can come of attempt-
ing to pass off a vague surge of a few years as a 3-year period.

After these preliminary remarks I propose to make a rapid sketch
of the relationships that have been found between seasonal features
in different parts of the world, then to describe the efforts that have
actually been made to issue long-range forecasts, and finally to
consider the directions from which improvements can be hoped for.
SEASONAL WEATHER PREDICTION—WALKER 119

In the collection of World Weather Records, of which the publi-
cation was made possible by American generosity 6 years ago, there
are about a thousand series of monthly data of pressure, tempera-
ture, and rainfall; and these form but a scanty network. If quar-
terly values were computed and correlation coefficients between each
pair for contemporary seasons, as well as for seasons one quarter
before and after, we should have about 4,000,000 coefficients. Coordi-
nation and generalization are imperatively called for, and the devel-
opment of the subject lies in the discovery of regions over which the
variations are linked together.

After preliminary efforts by Buchan, Hoffmeyer, Blanford, de
Bort, Hann, Meinardus, and Pettersson, the far-reaching possibilities
were first visualized by Hildebrandsson, who plotted pressure curves
for 10 years of 68 stations scattered over the world and drew atten-
tion to the relations between them; among these the opposition be-
tween Sydney in Australia and Buenos Aires was fated to have
great influence; his subsequent studies involved temperature and
rainfall also. In 1902 the Lockyers confirmed the existence of the
see-saw between pressure in the Argentine and in India or Australia;
and using graphical methods produced a world map, dividing areas
in it according as their pressures varied with India or South Amer-
ica. They were followed by Bigelow’s study of relationships with
solar prominences. During recent years considerable development
has followed the introduction of statistical methods, particularly in
the hands of Exner, and of members of the meteorological services
of England and India.

It will be convenient if I may here introduce a technical phrase.
If we have two series of numbers of which the variations are con-
nected, there will be a certain proportion of the variations of each
which are associated with those of the other, and this proportion
is called the correlation coefficient between the series. If it is nearly
unity the numbers vary closely together; if it is small there is little
relationship between them; and if it approaches —1 the relationship
is close, but one series goes up when the other goes down.

Let us now consider some of the results of the analysis of sea-
sonal features. It has long been known that in the North Atlantic
Ocean there are two types of winter. In one, pressure is high near
the Azores and southwest Europe, and low in Iceland, while tem-
peratures are high in northwest Europe; in the other type all these
features are reversed. (See the three upper graphs in fig. 1.) Let
us suppose that we want to know the effect of these types on, say,
temperature in Labrador. An obvious plan would be to plot the
variations in successive winters, December to February, of the
quantities which increase together, such as Vienna pressure and
120 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

Stornoway temperature, and also of the quantities which decrease
when the former increase, such as Iceland pressure, reversing these
so as to secure similarity of the graphs. We could then draw a
graph which is the mean of all these, and could regard it as ex-
pressing the variations of the North Atlantic fluctuation as a whole.
(See the lowest graph of fig. 1.) If now we were to plot Labrador
temperature below it we should see that its variations were, like
those of Iceland pressure, strongly opposed, and on reversing Lab-
rador there would be very strong similarity. So Labrador becomes
a good example of the second group. Now we want to know the

effect of the North Atlantic oscillation on the pressure, temperatures,
and rainfall of a large number of places; and if in this way we put
a hundred graphs under one another, some easy to classify and
some doubtful in character, it would be difficult to draw satisfactory
conclusions in a manner capable of convenient and accurate ex-
pression. So instead of graphs we use numbers. Having found by
preliminary investigation the stations which are most representa-
tive, we calculate the figures in successive years for the North At-
lantic oscillation as a whole, and then work out the correlation
coefiicients of this with the pressures, temperatures, and rainfalls
of all the places in which we are interested. These coefficients are
plotted in figure 2, and in its top chart we see that the rise of

pressure with a positive fluctuation is greater as far east as Vienna
and as far west as the Bermudas than it is at the Azores. There
is also to be seen in the second chart conspicuous warmth in the
east of the United States as well as in northwest Europe, and
marked cold to the southeast of the Mediterranean as well as along
the northeast of North America. On rainfall, in the lowest chart,
the influence is less wide-spread. The small amount of persistency
is shown in figure 3. The first of its three graphs shows how close
are the relationships of pressure in December with the figures ex-
pressing the fluctuations of the North Atlantic in that month; the
second and third, which give the relationships of pressure and tem-
perature in January with the fluctuations of the oscillation of the
December before, show that little effect of the December conditions
continues after a month.

The more critical in my audience may object that if you are suffi-
ciently astute in choosing your successive numbers for the fluctua-
tion you can make a certain amount of agreement with any system
of pressures and temperatures; and to this the reply is that the fit is
very much closer than can be explained in this way. Others may
urge that all these arguments are merely numerical, and quote the
jibe that by statistics you can prove anything. But if you wish to
understand phenomena you must collect the facts, and if they are
numerical it is only in the very simplest of cases that you can see
relationships by merely plotting curves and comparing them. Statis-
tical methods are inevitably forced on us by common sense when we
want accurate and reliable inferences from series of data, just as a
sextant is forced on a sailor when he wants to determine accurately
the altitude of the sun. One who has lost an important lawsuit,
owing to the ingenious argument of the opposing counsel, may object
that by logic you can prove anything; but that is an indequate de-
fense for being illogical on all occasions. As a matter of fact, when
studying relations of cause and effect statistical methods show us
what quantities vary together, but strictly by themselves they tell us
nothing as to causation. If we compare heights of fathers and sons,
we learn that tall sons have tall fathers; but in spite of that fact
we are not convinced that the child is literally father to the man.

Let us consider an example from data published in 1906 regarding
unemployment and illiteracy as measured by the percentage of per-
sons who could not sign their name in the marriage register (fig. 4).
Clearly the correlation coefficient between these two factors might
lead to most undesirable inferences regarding the usefulness of edu-
cation. But we could not expect to arrive at the truth if we ignored
such an important fact as the amount of trade, and on admitting the
data of this factor we see at once that faith in the value of our ele-
SEASONAL WEATHER PREDICTION—WALKER

Ficure 3.—Relations with the North Atlantic oscillation of December.

123
124 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

mentary schools need not be uprooted; for the revival of prosperity
produced marriage, especially among those in a humble position who
could not write, as well as a decrease in unemployment; so that the
last two factors varied similarly. We see, then, that we may be mis-
led if we do not take into account all the factors that may be opera-
tive. In other words, statistical methods hke logarithm tables are
invaluable as a tool for giving correct numerical results with the
minimum of mental labor; but neither tool possesses imagination or
judgment, and neither of them is a substitute for expert knowledge
of the subject to which it is applied.

FiGurRE 4.—Illiteracy and unemployment.

Let us now turn to the North Pacific Ocean, which, in spite of its
limited access to the Arctic seas, is subject to fluctuations very simi-
lar to those of the North Atlantic. A similar treatment yields figure 5,
in which increased pressure gradients go with high temperature to
the northeast and southwest, and low temperature to the north-
west and southeast. It will be noted that in both the North Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans a fluctuation is classed as positive when the pres-
sure gradient is strong and the wind circulation is active.

The largest known system of related seasonal weather is that
called the “ southern oscillation ” (or “ southern fluctuation ”), which
has features in the southern summer of December to February some-
what different from those of the southern winter of June to August.
It will be seen in figures 6 and 7 that at both times of the year the

fluctuation is called positive when pressure is high in the southern
Pacific and low in the Indian Ocean, and temperature is mostly low
in the Tropics; but the economic importance is in connection with
rainfall, for the fluctuation has a correlation coefficient of over 0.8
with the summer rainfall of northeast Australia, over 0.7 with the
monsoon rainfall of India and with the Nile floods, 0.6 with the
rainfall of large areas in South America, and over 0.5 with that of a
region in South Africa.

A surprising fact comes out on comparing the numerical series
giving the characteristics of the summer and winter values of this
fluctuation, the control of the southern winter on the succeeding
summer being expressed by a coefficient of 0.82, the corresponding
data being plotted together in figure 8; but the relationship with
the previous summer is only 0.2. The immediate effect of this is

that numerical values of the winter oscillation give us a means of
predicting 3 months in advance, at any rate approximately, the sum-
mer values of the oscillation and therefore of the pressure, tempera-
ture, and rainfall associated with them. In figure 9 are the rela-
tionships of the values of the pressure, temperature, and rainfall of
December to February, with the numbers indicating the fluctuation
of the previous June to August. These express relationships which
have held for about 50 years, and show that we have arrived, not
at a mathematical figment, but at a physical reality of commercial
value.

These methods of prediction can be improved on by study of the
relationships of individual areas. For example, the coefficient of
0.64 of rainfall of northeast Australia with the oscillation of the
previous winter becomes 0.79, when we base it on previous pressure
at Honolulu, Port Darwin, and South America; a comparison of the

actual rainfall with that given by the formula is shown in figure
10. Similarly, the 0.56 of South Africa becomes 0.72. But a cer-
tain amount of the improvement effected in this way by selecting
the biggest factors is bound to be fictitious, even when there appear
to be adequate independent reasons for thinking that the relation-
ships are real; and, if this precaution is ignored, the more promis-
ing the formula, as indicated by the closeness of its apparent rela-
tionship, the greater is the likelihood of disappointment.

It must be admitted that a real control of 0.7 by previous condi-
tions is about as good as is now available for forecasting, and the
difference between the actual and the forecasted amounts will still
be considerable; so predictions can only be issued with restraint if
public confidence is to be won. The natural consequence is silence,
except when the indications are markedly favorable or unfavorable:

undue risk, be backed to come in within the foremost 6, and we may
feel confident that a thoroughly bad animal will be in the last 6;
but it would be unwise to hazard much on the likelihood that a com-
monplace individual will finish among the central 6. It may at
first sight seem a confession of weakness to issue no forecast when
conditions appear roughly normal; but it is better to admit your
limitations, and only speak when you can do so with some safety,
than to issue predictions when they are little more than guesses.
The objection is sometimes raised that though a foreshadowing
of abundant or scanty rain over a region may be right four times out
of five, owing to local variations the predictions will not be so suc-
cessful when applied to a particular farm; and it must be admitted
that this criticism is valid. But in England, as I learn from Sir John
Russell, there are modifications of treatment and manuring that are
appropriate before wet seasons and others before dry; in South
Africa, in hilly country, the upper levels are better for cultivation in
SEASONAL WEATHER PREDICTION——-WALKER 131

wet years and the lower ones in dry years; in India, if the rains fail,
cotton and millets will grow though the ordinary crops may perish.
We may hope that, when our methods have improved, the predictions
when applied to a particular farm will be right at least three times
in 5 years; and if they are consistently acted upon, they will prove of
material value in the long run.

Of further applications of these methods some are worthy of a
passing notice. For Siam, whose summer rain has a coefficient of
0.7 with the contemporary southern oscillation, a former Indian col-
league has worked out a foreshadowing formula with a relationship
of 0.8. And at length China, which has suffered terribly from floods
as well as droughts, is receiving attention. A graduate from Shang-
hai, now working in London, finds that the Yangtse valley and three
areas along the coast have enough data for a preliminary investiga-
tion, and has worked out formulae for prediction with coefficients
between 0.6 and 0.7. Mention should also be made of the researches
of Okada in connection with the rice crop of Japan.

Let us now turn from the academic to the practical, and see how
far these theoretical methods justify themselves in actual experience.
I believe that the earliest regular seasonal forecasts based on meteor-
ological instead of astrological data were those of the Indian mon-
soon of June to September, started half a century ago in India by
H. F. Blanford, and depending mainly for their success on the ill-
effect upon the monsoon of excessive winter or spring snowfall in the
Himalayas; finally, however, he made the big generalization that
droughts might be associated with unusually high pressure over a
great part of Asia, at Mauritius and in Australia. Eliot continued
the monsoon forecasts from 1887 to 1903, but data in those days were
scanty; he attempted far too much detail, his mode of expression
was somewhat pontifical, and the newspapers became sarcastic; so
latterly he obtained immunity from criticism by printing the fore-
casts as confidential documents. The gradual introduction of statis-
tical methods in India has undoubtedly led to improvement; but,
as we have seen, it is much easier to predict the rainfall of December
to February than that of June to September, and the length of the
series of Indian data is not yet great enough to give complete relia-
bility. After careful scrutiny I estimate that of the forecasts issued
before the monsoon periods from 1905 to 1932 two-thirds were cor-
rect; but I consider that this is not good enough and that we have
been too ambitious. Also while the approximate prediction formula
of 1908 has stood the test of time with credit, the later ones of 1924
for northwest India and the Peninsula separately, although certainly
better in theory, have not, in the short period of trial, proved so

36923—36——10
132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

successful. The contrast between the working of the formulae before
and after their date of preparation will be seen in figure 11.

Happily in Southern Rhodesia, which in 1922 adopted statistical
methods similar to those of India with only 24 years of data to work
upon, the results have been eminently satisfactory. Out of 11 years
since publication was begun, there have been 8 in which a departure
of over 3 inches was given by the formula, and in 7 of these the
character was correctly indicated (fig. 12).

At Batavia the efficient Dutch observatory under Braak started in
1909 to issue forecasts founded on the simple rule that low pressure
from January to June was followed by abundance of rain from July
to December. The rule demanded a more complete persistence of
pressure than actually prevails, and in 1927 Berlage adopted a
formula based on three local conditions, together with data of the
rare rains of northern Peru: this gives, on paper, a relationship of
over 0.8.

In Australia calamitous failures in the rains have long demanded
forecasts, and these led to the production of weather cycles, which
broke down so frequently that their use was discarded. In spite of
this experience, however, Hunt, the Commonwealth Meteorologist,
put forward in 1929 a theory of a 4-year period, based on the cool-
ing effect of the wide-spread growth of luxuriant vegetation pro-
duced by the rainfall in areas that were parched. I believe that the
theory has not been adopted officially.

When we turn from the tropical and subtropical to the temperate
regions, where the persistence of conditions is in general conspicu-
ously smaller, we must expect greater difficulties in making long-
range forecasts. In America the relations of weather and crops
have probably been worked out more scientifically than in any other
country, so that the commercial value of reliable predicting has long
been recognized; and not only by farmers, but by those interested
in water supply, in power schemes, in transport, and in commerce
generally. Thus one of the Californian hydroelectric companies
makes its own forecasts, because it may spend $4,000,000 more for
crude oil in a dry than in a wet year. In a country of exuberant
vitality it is not surprising that many efforts should have been made
to provide for the general demand. In an article in 1927, by C. F.
Brooks, we read that in the absence of forecasts “ western farmers
have paid a ‘rainmaker’ thousands of dollars at a time” actually
to produce rain; that during the previous 10 years “ well over 50
long-rangers of greater or lesser repute have been publishing and,
in a great many cases, accepting money for worthless or damaging
forecasts.” As in Europe, they have predictions based on occur-
rences on critical days, such as Candlemas or St. Swithin’s, as well

as on the doings of animals and birds. Thus Brooks quotes from an
almanac of 1870: “When you see 13 geese walking injun file and
toeing in you can deliberately bet yure last surviving dollar on a
hard winter, and grate fluktuousness during the next seazon in the
price of cowhide boots.”

Undeterred by the difficulties, G. F. McEwen, of the Scripps Insti-
tution of Oceanography in California, has for some time been fore-
casting rainfall by empirical methods, and at first attained con-
siderable success, largely on the basis of a short series of ocean tem-
peratures. These, however, as he has recognized, have not of late
made good their early promise; and he is driven to using sun-spot
numbers, a cycle of 5 or 6 years, and a complex method of smoothing
in the hope of attaining reliability.

FiGur® 13.—Atlantic icebergs and the previous oscillation.

A less difficult task confronts the International Ice Patrol Service
of the United States in their desire to obtain advance information
of the amount of Arctic ice drifting into the western North Atlantic.
I do not know what progress has been made, but the dependence on
the previous North Atlantic oscillation, with which there is a coeffi-
cient of 0.60, would appear to suggest a useful starting-point
(fig. 13).

In Europe the only seasonal forecasts known to me that have a
scientific foundation, and have been made for a number of years, are
those of Sweden and Russia. In Sweden Wallén has for 18 years
made predictions for rainfall and for the height of water. Regard-
ing rainfall, he smooths by taking the sums of consecutive 12
months; and then, assuming that the nature of the fluctuations so
disclosed will not change suddenly, he forecasts that the total rain-
fall of some definite period, usually 6 months or a year, will be
greater, or less, than it was in the previous year. Now a moment’s
SEASONAL WEATHER PREDICTION—WALKER 135

thought will make it clear that a man will in the long run be right
three times out of four if, when last year’s rain was in defect, he
predicts an increase, or if it was in excess he forecasts a diminution.
So I think it is not unfair to say that success under the Swedish
conditions begins at 75 percent. The success actually attained is 82
percent, which is encouraging; and the success in dealing with water
levels is phenomenally great, being slightly over 90 percent.

The seasonal conditions of Russia, which are not very closely
related with those of the North Atlantic, have been carefully
examined by W. Wiese. In 1923 the Hydrometeorological Office
of Leningrad started publishing forecasts of ice in the Barents Sea,
and out of 17 monthly forecasts of which I have information 15 were
approximately correct. Predictions of the rainfall of April and
May in central and east Russia were initiated at the same time, and
all the first 4 years they were approximately correct; the biggest
difference between the actual and forecasted amounts was only
20 percent.

No account of European activity in this department could ignore
the enterprise of Prussia 4 years ago in creating at Frankfort a. M.
a post for research into long-period forecasting. Dr. Franz Baur
has for the present wisely limited his activity to the issue of a fore-
cast of 10 days; it would be impossible to expect results under these
conditions which are as accurate as those of daily weather work, but
I am informed that their standard fully demonstrates the trust-
worthiness of the principles employed. It is only by experiments of
this kind that satisfactory methods of prediction can be developed.

We may now pass to the consideration of improvements in our
methods, and the fundamental question at once arises—what is the
physical cause of seasonal fluctuations? We should naturally look
for it in variations in the energy received from the sun, and it is
surprising that an increase in solar activity as measured by sun spots
produces a slight decrease in the circulations in the North Atlantic
and the North Pacific. In the southern fluctuation the tendency of
numerous spots is to produce positive values, but even there the
biggest seasonal correlation coefficient is only 0.26, which is much
too small to provide the explanation that we seek. Moreover, it
probably arises because a positive fluctuation is associated with
low temperatures between latitudes 40° N. and 40° S., and these are
linked with an increase in sun spots.

In order to verify that the daily pressures are not produced by
short-lived emanations from the sun tabulations of the relationships
between daily and weekly, as well as the monthly and seasonal, values
at distant places have been made; for if the daily values over the
136 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

earth are controlled from outside there will be close parallelism
between these daily and weekly pressures. It was found that be-
tween 31 daily contemporary pressures at Honolulu and Batavia
the coefficient was —0.12, which is negligible; between 39 weekly
ones it was +0.10; between 47 monthly June pressures it was — 0.12;
and between the pressures of 47 three-monthly seasons of June to
August it was —0.46. Between Samoa and Batavia December
pressures the coefficient was —0.88, and for the season December to
February it was —0.60. Thus it is between the characteristics that
persist over months, not over days or weeks, that relationships exist.

Being forced off short-lived phenomena we search for an expla-
nation in terms of slowly changing features, such as ocean tempera-
tures; and the big variations from year to year in the amount of
pack ice in the antarctic seas forces itself on our attention. But
here the reports of 12 years from the South Orkneys yield a rela-
tionship of only 0.32 with the southern fluctuation, instead of about
0.9, as we should want in a prime cause; and the variations at the
South Orkneys come after rather than before those of the southern
oscillation. The biggest ocean region is the Pacific, and as an index
of its seasonal water temperature we may use the corresponding
air temperature of Samoa, which shows a greater persistence than
any factor in the world as yet examined; the relationship between
its summer and autumn values is as large as 0.94. But unluckily the
correlation coefficients show clearly that it is mainly the southern
fluctuation in winter that controls the Samoa temperature. Thus,
a short-cut to the explanation of our fundamental problems seems
as far away as ever. Our three big fluctuations each form a system
of changes which are apparently held together by meteorological
links; and there is, in my opinion, as yet no satisfactory proof of any
free periods associated with them.

Let us now consider in what direction new developments seem
likely. A moment’s reflection will convince us that in view of the
variations of rainfall over large areas, such as Brazil and Central
Africa, which are scarcely affected by the three big fluctuations,
there must be others, some of which are probably on a big scale. For
example, we should, on the analogy of the northern oceans, expect a
fluctuation of pressure between the antarctic low-pressure belt and
the high-pressure belt of 30° S. We are at once reminded of the
marked opposition which Simpson found during the short period of
4 years for which data were available between pressure at McMurdo
Sound and that in a belt round the earth extending from about 25°
S. to about 50° S. All students of this subject have found it natural
to regard the fluctuations in the amount of pack ice in the antarctic
seas as likely to control sea and therefore air temperatures over
SEASONAL WEATHER PREDICTION—WALKER 137

large regions, and the most southern station from which as many as
25 years of data are forthcoming is the South Orkneys. Its winter
pressure does show the opposition that we should expect with that
of Australia, but not with the high-pressure region of South America
or Mauritius; so that it gives little support to the view that there is
a general pressure oscillation between the low- and the high-pressure
belts of the Southern Hemisphere. On the other hand, the air tem-
perature at the South Orkneys may be regarded as an index of the
sea temperature; and as the ocean current through the Drake Pas-
sage would take about a year to reach South Africa, we are not
astonished at the relationship of 0.56 between the South Orkneys
air temperature in winter and that of the next winter at Cape Town.

Figurn 14.—Departures from normal of Ano Nuevo temperature, June to August, and of

This is not, however, as close as the corresponding relationship of
0.84 shown in figure 14 between the winter temperature at New
Year Island at the extreme southeast of South America, and that
at Cape Town a year later. The far greater influence of New Year
Island is interesting, since between Cape Horn and the South Ork-
neys there runs ENE. a line which the recent Discovery expedition
calls the Antarctic Convergence; here the cold antarctie water meets
the northern warmer water and dives under it. So while the current
flowing past New Year Island can after a year approach South
Africa, that from the South Orkneys is cut off by a barrier.

If I may summarize these remarks, I would say that although
seasonal foreshadowing is still very imperfect it has come to stay; for
situations will arise from time to time, as they did in India in 1905,
in which it can be foreseen with practical certainty that rains will
1388 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

fail and a warning will then be of great value. But those who pre-
pare formulas by the selection, based merely on the closeness of their
apparent relationship, of a few out of many factors must remember
that they cannot expect the value of all these factors to be main-
tained ; and if they have a forecasting formula which on paper works
out with a coefficient of, say, 0.75, they must realize that this is in
reality probably not more than 0.6, or in some cases even.0.4.. And I
would plead for a much severer standard in handling questions of
periodicity. If these views are right, no anticipations should be
published except on the strongest evidence of excess or defect until
the experience of 15 or 20 years has justified a less cautious policy.

Finally I would express the hope that the subject may, by its
potential value to the race, and by the many-sided nature of its
interests, enlist the services of some of my hearers who are qualified
to unravel some of its intricacies.
THE SUN’S PLACE AMONG THE STARS?’

By WALTER S. ADAMS
Mount Wilson Observatory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington

[With 5 plates]

In previous lectures in this series you have had described to you
the many skillful and important investigations that have given us
such extensive knowledge of the sun as a source of light and heat,
of its composition, physical nature, and characteristics, and of the
far-flung gravitational attraction by which the sun holds the planets
in their courses. I should like to consider with you the sun in its
relation to the stars, how it compares in size and brightness and mass
with the vast number of other suns by which it is surrounded, and
what from analogy and comparison with the stars we may reason-
ably expect its future life history to be.

It will perhaps be of interest at the outset to interpret our subject
literally and to define according to the best of our knowledge the
geographical location of the sun among the stars. The stars in the
observable universe are grouped into systems scattered like islands
throughout space and separated by enormous distances, which light
requires millions of years to traverse. These systems of stars, the
extra-galactic nebulae of the astronomer (pl. 1, fig. 1), extend out
to the limits of the largest telescopes and, generally speaking, seem
to be distributed uniformly; that is, the same volume of space in
all directions and at all distances contains about the same number of
stellar systems or nebulae. Occasionally clusters of nebulae are
found in which hundreds of these objects appear upon a single
photograph, but from a statistical point of view these clusters do not
affect the uniformity of the distribution seriously. The space be-
tween the nebulae seems to be singularly free from matter; probably
some traces of gas and of cosmic dust are present here and there, but
observations of the light of the most distant nebulae show that even
throughout these immense distances there can be but very little
obscuring material.

140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

The sun is situated within one of these systems of stars, which
is known as the galaxy. Like most other well-developed stellar
systems containing great numbers of stars it is not round but lens-
shaped in form, with a length some 5 to 10 times its thickness
(fig. 1). As we look out into the galaxy from our position inside,
the circle of the Milky Way forms the largest dimension of our
lens, or the equator of our galaxy, and we see a vast number of
stars because we look through a great depth throughout which they
are scattered. At right angles to the galaxy where the thickness
is much less the number of stars is also much less. Our system of
stars is probably not definitely bounded but fades off more or less
irregularly intoempty
space, and included
within it are not only
stars but clouds of
gas, cosmic dust, star
clusters, star clouds,

local system about our sun is also indicated. 3 f
other forms in which
the material that builds the stars can occur. Especially in the direc-
tion of the center of the galaxy in the constellation of Sagittarius
are there great masses of dark cosmic clouds, nebulous stars, and
star clouds that point to a marked concentration of matter in this
region (pl. 2).

Our galaxy is about 100,000 light-years along its greatest diameter,
and the sun is situated about halfway between the center and edge,
or some 25,000 or 30,000 light-years from the center, and slightly
north of the equatorial plane. As a result of modern investigations
it is certain that the entire galaxy is in rotation about its center or,
more accurately, that the stars are in revolution about the center of
gravity of the system just as the planets are in revolution about the
sun. The stars nearest the center revolve most rapidly and in the
shortest period. The velocity of revolution of the sun about the
center of the galaxy is about 165 miles a second, and it would require
some 225 million years for the sun to complete one entire revolution.

Scattered throughout this great volume of space are the stars that
constitute our system, variously estimated at from 100 to 200 billion
in number. The difficulty in determining the number of the stars
arises from the necessity for making the proper allowance for the
great proportion of faint small stars, which certainly outnumber
greatly the more luminous stars in our galaxy. These small stars,
the dwarfs of our system, which we shall have occasion to consider
later, become so faint at great distances that they are quite beyond
the reach of the largest telescopes. Accordingly such stars can be

observed only in a limited volume of space around the sun, and it is
only by assuming that their frequency throughout the whole galaxy
approximates that in this small sample volume that any estimate
can be made of their total number.

If we sum up our conclusions, therefore, we find that our sun is
one of many billions of stars forming a flattened system similar
to many other systems scattered throughout the observable region
of space. It was long thought that the size of our system was con-
siderably greater than that of the nearer extra-galactic nebulae which
can be studied in detail, but recent observations have tended both
to reduce the earlier estimates of the size of our galaxy and to
increase the size of the outer stellar systems. As a result the size
of our system of stars is now believed to be quite comparable with
that of the Andromeda nebula (pl. 1, fig. 2), one of the nearest
and best observable of the outer nebulae, which has a distance of
about 900,000 light-years.

The total mass of our galaxy, including not only the stars but
all the other material contained within it, is estimated at about
160 billion times the mass of our sun. This value is derived from
the rotation of the galaxy. So large a figure gives an impression
of considerable average density, but the size of the galaxy is so great
that the actual density is extremely small. In the vicinity of the
sun the average separation of even the faintest dwarf stars is of
the order of 10 light-years. Throughout the observable universe
the average density is, of course, very much lower, and recent investi-
gations give a value corresponding to that of 15 grains of matter
distributed uniformly throughout a volume of space 1,000 times
the size of the earth.

When we begin to consider the place of the sun among the stars
as a physical body and attempt to compare it with other stars we
naturally start with its brightness. We know that the sun is very
bright and that the stars are faint, but we also know that the stars
are very far away. A natural question to ask is how the sun would
compare in brightness with the average stars of the night sky if
it were removed to the average distance of a star. The answer is
comparatively simple. Among the stars, just as on the earth, the
so-called “ inverse-square law ” of light and heat holds accurately in
the absence of any obscuring material. This means that if we double
the distance we divide by four the amount of light and heat we
receive from an object, whether that object be a candle, the sun, or
a star. If the sun were 10 times as far away from us as it is we
should receive only one hundredth part of the present amount of
light. Now the average distance of the sun is about 92,000,000 miles,
and the distance of an average nearby star is at least 33 light-years
142 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

where a light-year is the distance which light travels in a year at
the rate of 186,000 miles a second. Roughly a light-year is 6,000,000
million miles. If we carry through the arithmetic we find that at a
distance of 33 light-years the sun, although still visible, would be
among the fainter of the stars seen with the naked eye, and only
about three times as bright as the faintest star that can be seen
with the eye under the most favorable conditions. The great ma-
jority of the naked-eye stars are much farther away than the 33
light-years which we have assumed, so that as compared with these
stars our sun is a relatively insignificant body.

This result shows us at once that the stars differ greatly from one
another in the amount of light they give out, or, in other words,
in their luminosity or candlepower. If all the stars had the same
luminosity their brightness as we see them would depend solely
upon their distance, but since this is not the case both distance
and luminosity are involved. The inverse-square law, however, at
once gives us a simple relationship between apparent brightness,
intrinsic brightness or luminosity, and distance, and this relation-
ship forms the basis of all studies of the distribution of stars accord-
ing to their true brightness. Since this relationship is a simple
equation between three quantities, we can always find the third quan-
tity when the other two are known. But the apparent brightness
or magnitude of a star may be assumed to be known: it is obtained
from direct observation, and existing catalogs list hundreds of
thousands of stars with accurately measured apparent magnitudes.
So all we need to solve our equation is to know either the distance,
in which case we can determine the luminosity directly, or the
luminosity, in which case we can determine the distance.

The first and for many years the only way in which the luminosity
of a star could be obtained was from a previous knowledge of its
distance. Naturally the earliest method of measuring stellar dis-
tances grew out of accurate measurements of position. If the posi-
tion of a star with reference to the faint stars in the background
of the sky can be measured with great accuracy at a certain time,
and again 6 months later when the earth is on the opposite side of
its orbit around the sun, we have a base line of about 185,000,000
miles by which to measure its distance. As seen from the ends of
this line the star should be slightly displaced with reference to the
fainter stars in the background which are vastly more distant. If
this angle can be measured, it is a simple matter, since the length of
the base line is known, to calculate the distance. The method is very
similar to that used in ordinary surveying. ‘The difficulty arises, how-
ever, that the stars are so far away that even with this great base
line the angle to be measured is extremely small. In the case of
SUN’S PLACE AMONG THE STARS—ADAMS 143

but a single star does it amount to as much as 1’’ of arc, and for
the vast majority of stars it is less than one-tenth of this amount.
A tenth of a second of are with the telescopes usually employed for
these investigations corresponds to about 0.00015 inch on the photo-
graphic plate; but such is the accuracy of the method and the skill
of the observers that the distances of about 3,500 stars have been
determined in this way. The measurements give directly a small
angle, and one-half of this angle is called the parallax of the star.
It corresponds to the angle subtended by the distance of the earth
from the sun as seen from the star. The full moon as seen from
the earth subtends an angle of about 1,900’ of are.
This direct or trigonometric method of determining the distances
of the stars is an extremely valuable one, and gives us our most

accurate knowledge regarding the distances of the stars in the
neighborhood of the sun (pl. 3). Beyond distances of 300 or 400
light-years, however, its value in the case of individual stars falls
off rapidly, since at these great distances the parallaxes are so
small that the inherent error of measurement becomes a large frac-
tion of the parallax, and finally equals or surpasses it. For the
most distant stars, therefore, we must find other methods that do
not depend upon direct measurements of position.

Several such methods are known, some of which give us with
high accuracy not the distances of individual stars but the aver-
age distance of groups of stars of different brightness. Still others
are applicable only to special classes such as double stars, or the
interesting moving clusters in which the stars move together through
the galaxy just as flocks of birds move together through the air
(fig. 2). All these methods give parallaxes and distances directly,
144 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

and from these distances the luminosities can be calculated readily
by the aid of the relationship which we have already considered
connecting apparent brightness, distance, and luminosity.

There are, however, other methods that reverse the process, and,
instead of deriving the distances directly and then the luminosities,
we derive the luminosities directly and then the distances. A simple
example will illustrate how such a method operates. Suppose we
observe an incandescent lamp some distance away and can measure
accurately the amount of light we receive from it, or its apparent
brightness. If we know its distance we can determine its candle-
power by the aid of the inverse square law as we have already seen.
If, however, we do not know its distance but do know its candle-
power, we can use the same law to determine the distance. So in
the case of the stars the question at once arises whether there is
any means for determining their candlepowers or luminosities
directly.

There is a class of stars in the sky that vary in light in a peculiar
way throughout a definite period. A careful study of stars of this
class in star clouds where they are known to be at closely the same
distance, and of others at known distances, has led to the estab-
lishment of a law connecting the luminosities of such stars with the
length of period of their light-variations. This law is quantitative,
so that the luminosity can be determined when the period of varia-
tion is known. Stars of this character have been recognized in the
stellar systems of outer space, their periods of light-variation have
been observed, and from these periods the luminosities of these
stars have been derived. These in turn give us at once the distances
of the nebulae of which they form a part—the only accurate means
as yet devised for determining the distances of these enormously
remote objects.

This method illustrates one of the direct ways in which stellar
luminosities can be determined for stars of a certain class. Another
method which has very wide applications depends upon the physical
properties of stars, and a somewhat more detailed analysis will per-
haps be of interest, not only because the method has been fruitful
in its results, but also because it illustrates many of the principles
used in modern astrophysical study.

The temperatures of the surfaces of stars have been measured by
several different methods and are known with considerable accuracy.
As we might expect they differ widely: some of the dull red stars
have temperatures as low as 2,000° on the Centigrade scale, while
many of the blue stars reach temperatures of 20,000° or more. The
temperature of the surface of our sun is about 6,000° C. or nearly
11,000° on the Fahrenheit scale. One of the ways in which the
SUN’S PLACE AMONG THE STARS—ADAMS 145

temperature of a star is very quickly recognized is from the analysis
of its light into a spectrum. The distribution of the light of dif-
ferent colors throughout the spectrum, the presence or absence of
certain lines, and many other features determine the temperature of
the star rather definitely (pl. 4). So stars of the same spectral type
have closely the same temperature. Now, it is a fact of observation
that the masses of stars of the same spectral type do not differ very
greatly. A factor of 10 would cover the vast majority of cases. We
know this from a great variety of evidence, mainly from double
stars for which the masses can be calculated accurately. On the
other hand, we know that the luminosity or candlepower of stars
shows enormous variations, stars of the same spectral type some-
times differing as much as hundreds of millions of times in the
amount of light they give out.

Since the surface brightness, or the amount of light each unit of
area gives out, is nearly the same for stars of the same temperature
or spectral type the only explanation for the immense difference in
luminosity is a great difference in size. In other words, the very
luminous stars must be very large as compared with the fainter
stars. Since the masses, however, do not differ very greatly, the
brighter stars must be very much less dense than the fainter stars.
We conclude, therefore, that many of the brighter stars in the sky
must be enormous masses of gas of very low density, a conclusion
fully borne out by measurements of diameter with Michelson’s inter-
ferometer, which show the existence of great red stars as much as
200,000,000 miles in diameter, or more than 220 times the diameter
of our sun. (Fig. 3.)

Such stars are recognized through a study of their spectrum.
When a star gives out light, the atoms of the gases in its atmosphere
are in an excited state and absorb light in the particular wave lengths
that correspond to the spectrum lines of each element involved. So
we get a pattern of lines of all the elements in the star’s atmosphere.
When the temperature of the star is low, we obtain the lines of
what is called the neutral atom, the atom in its normal state, but
if the temperature is high the atom is modified by having one or
more of its electrons pulled off and becomes what we call ionized.
Ionized atoms give rise to a different class of lines from neutral atoms,
but in stars of ordinary temperature both sets of lines are usually
present, some of the atoms being neutral and some ionized. In
stars of low temperature the neutral lines are the stronger, in stars
of high temperature the lines due to the ionized atom.

There is, however, another factor that favors the detachment
of electrons from atoms, and this is the density of the star’s atmos-
phere. If the density is low, there are fewer collisions and fewer

opportunities for a detached electron to reunite with an ionized
atom. So we should expect the lines due to the ionized atoms to be
strong in the spectra of stars of low density and weak in those of
high density. This is just what observations show. An interesting
application of this theory is found in the case of the spectrum of
the sun’s atmosphere (pl. 5, fig. 1). In the upper levels of the
atmosphere the lines due to the ionized atoms are much stronger
than at lower levels and this in spite of the fact that the tempera-
ture is lower. The lower density is the significant factor and leads
to a great predominance of ionized atoms.

The application of these principles to the problem of determining
the luminosities of stars is very simple. If we select two stars of
the same spectral type whose distances have been measured by any
one of the methods I have described, one of which has a high

luminosity and the other a low luminosity, we find the lines due
to the ionized atom strong in the star of high luminosity because
the density is low. By taking a sufficient number of stars of known
distance and luminosity a correlation can be established between
the intensities of ionized and neutral lines and the luminosity.
Then in the case of any other star whose spectrum can be photo-
graphed it is merely necessary to measure the intensities of the
selected lines and from the correlation-curve to read off the corre-
sponding luminosity or absolute magnitude. In practice, pairs of
neighboring lines are selected, one of which varies greatly with
luminosity whereas the other is comparatively insensitive (pl. 5,
fig. 2). In this way each spectrum of a star can be treated inde-
pendently, and no absolute scale of intensities is necessary (fig. 4).
This is, very briefly, the method for deriving the luminosities of
stars directly from their spectra. It is not so accurate as the method
of angular measurement, the so-called “ trigonometric method ”, for
36923—36——11
148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

the stars in our immediate neighborhood, but for more distant stars
it is superior since its accuracy is independent of the distance. Thus
the two methods supplement each other in a most valuable way, and
between the two we have acquired a knowledge of the luminosities
and distances of about 6,000 individual stars.

When we begin to consider these results, we are led to some very
interesting conclusions. In the first place, we find that the apparent
brightness of a star as we see it may bear very little relationship to
its real brightness or luminosity. Sirius, apparently the brightest
star in the sky, is comparatively near us and gives out about 25 times
as much light as our sun; Canopus, the second brightest star, is
very far away and is almost certainly 10,000 times as luminous as
the sun. Similarly Procyon, one of the brightest of the stars in the
winter constellations, has 5 times the luminosity of our sun, while
Rigel, the brightest star in Orion and of nearly the same apparent
brightness as Procyon, gives out from 10,000 to 15,000 times as much
light asthe sun. The color of Rigel is bluish white, and its tempera-
ture is very high, so that its surface brightness is great. On the
other hand, Betelgeuse, the other chief star in Orion, is red and has
a low temperature and surface brightness; its diameter, however, is
so enormous—over 200,000,000 miles—that its luminosity is nearly
1,500 times that of the sun.

The contrast between the luminosities of these giant stars and the
faint dwarf stars is very great. The faintest star intrinsically of
which we have any knowledge is the small companion of the nearest
star in the sky, a Centauri. This star has a distance of 4.3 light-
years, and its luminosity is 0.00006 of that of the sun. About a
dozen stars are known the luminosity of which is less than 0.0001
part of that of the sun. So we find that among the stars already
studied the luminosity or candlepower varies through a range of
at least 200,000,000. This factor would be multiplied at least a
thousandfold if we were to include the brightest of the new or
temporary stars which suddenly blaze out and die away within a
few days or weeks. The luminosities of some of these stars must
be at least a million times that of our sun. So we find that the Bib-
lical statement that “one star differs from another star in glory”
is even more true of the stars as they really are than as they
appeared to the eyes of the shepherds of Palestine.

A very remarkable result is found when the stars are grouped
accerding to spectral type, or surface temperature, and their true
luminosities. (Fig. 5.) The resulting diagram resembles a reversed
7, with the faint low-temperature stars lying along the stem of the
figure and the bright low-temperature stars along the upper horizon-
tal bar. Between the two there is a wide gap in which few or no

150 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

stars are found. These two classes of stars, to which the names
“giants” and “dwarfs” have been given by astronomers, differ
enormously in luminosity, the average low-temperature giant being
at least 10,000 times as bright as the corresponding dwarf. This
conclusion, originally drawn from trigonometric observations, is
fully confirmed by the luminosities of nearly 4,200 stars recently
determined by the spectroscopic method.

In general, stars may be divided according to luminosity into
three classes, dwarfs, giants, and extremely bright stars that may be
called supergiants. The separation between dwarfs and giants is
widest among the stars of lowest temperature and becomes pro-
gressively less for stars of higher temperature, the dwarfs becoming
brighter and the giants slightly fainter. Some stars of intermediate
luminosity appear among these stars of increasing temperature, and
the two chains of dwarfs and giants come together and may even
cross among stars somewhat hotter than the sun with temperatures
of 7,000° or 8,000° C. The supergiants, which include the most
luminous stars in the sky, are found among stars of all tempera-
tures and show a much greater range in luminosity than either the
giants or the dwarfs of the same spectral type or temperature.
They are especially numerous among the stars with temperatures
slightly higher than that of the sun; in fact, stars of these types
seem to contain few normal giants, the great majority being either
dwarfs or stars of the supergiant class. Another interesting fact
about the supergiants is that a large proportion of them vary in
light, and it seems probable that such variation indicates a kind of
instability that is associated with great size and high luminosity.

Perhaps the single most interesting result which comes from a
study of the luminosities of stars is the remarkable tendency to
group around definite values of brightness. This is especially
marked in the case of giant stars, although very evident among the
dwarfs. About 90 percent of giant stars with temperatures near
4,000° C. have the same luminosity within a range of twofold or
threefold. In other words, most stars of a given temperature, like
the bulbs of our electric lamps, are built to give out a definite num-
ber of candlepower and do not show the almost infinite range in
luminosity we might so readily expect. The luminosity especially
favored among the giant stars with temperatures less than our sun
is about 100 to 150 times that of the sun. It does not change rapidly
with decrease of temperature but on the whole increases slightly for
the cooler giants. This is doubtless due to the larger size of these
stars, the increase in the area which emits light more than counter-
balancing the smaller amount given out by each unit of surface.
SUN’S PLACE AMONG THE STARS—ADAMS 15

Among the dwarf stars, on the other hand, the change of lumi-
nosity with temperature is very marked. As the temperature de-
creases the luminosity decreases regularly and then drops abruptly
as we reach the coolest stars. This is to be expected as the limits of
visible radiation are reached and the light of the stars goes out.
The dwarf stars are comparatively small, dense bodies, and the
lower the temperature the less massive and the denser they are
found to be. So there is no increase of size as among the giants to
balance the effect of the decrease of surface brightness due to
decreased temperature.

Our sun belongs to the sequence of dwarf stars that forms an un-
broken chain between the faintest stars intrinsically of which we
have any knowledge, stars that give out less than 0.0001 part the
light of the sun, and the bright white stars with luminosities 50 or
more times that of the sun. Within this sequence the sun agrees well
with other stars of the same temperature: its luminosity seems to
be slightly less than that of the average star of its type but well
within the range that similar stars exhibit. In mass, spectral type,
and many other characteristics the sun can be almost precisely
matched by many of the stars which have already been observed.
As a typical dwarf star, therefore, we can reason that the sun in
its future history will pass through the evolutionary changes of
similar stars in the main sequence to which it belongs. What these
changes may be is very far from certain, for our theories of stellar
evolution are still in a most indefinite state. The probabilities are
that in the course of sufficient time the sun will radiate away much
of its mass, will decrease in temperature and luminosity, and arrive
at a condition similar to that of the faint red dwarf stars which are
our most frequent neighbors. The time required for such processes,
however, is almost incredibly long. It would take 40,000,000 million
years for the sun to lose half its present mass through radiation,
and it is quite possible that during a considerable part of that period
the output of light and heat would not differ seriously from that at
present. Every aspect of the study of the relationship of the sun
to the stars as a physical body leads to a time-scale of enormous
length, and it is clear that, whatever the future history of the earth,
its destiny will be defined by limitations quite other than those set
by a cold and inert sun.

THE ATMOSPHERES OF THE PLANETS’

By Henry Norris RUSSELL
Research Professor of Astronomy, Princeton University

Two ways are open to the retiring president of this association
when he makes what small return he can for the honor of his
election. By a sound and time-honored custom, it is his duty and
privilege to speak of some topic, within his own technical field,
but of general interest. He may therefore either report on his own
researches—if he is fortunate enough to have recent or unpublished
results good enough to measure up to the standard of a presidential
address—or he may survey some section of his part of the field of
science in which important gains have lately been made, though his
own contribution to this advance may be small. Only the latter
course is open to the present speaker, and so, this evening, we may
devote a little time to the atmospheres of the planets.

As soon as telescopes became good enough to give a tolerable view
of details on the planets, evidence began to accumulate that some
of them, at least, possessed atmospheres. Doubtless the first to be
noticed were the changes in the markings on Jupiter, which differ
radically from one year to the next, and often appear suddenly
and last but a few weeks, though thousands of miles in diameter.
Only clouds forming and dissolving in a Jovian atmosphere can
account for such rapid and capricious changes.

Evidence for an atmosphere on Mars is afforded by the polar
caps. The steady shrinkage of these during the summer, accom-
panied by the growth of the opposite cap during the long, cold polar
night, is explicable only by the melting or evaporation of deposits
of some snowlike substance, which is carried as invisible vapor to the
opposite pole, and there deposited. A permanent, noncondensible
atmosphere is required for the transport of this vapor.

Venus, when she is considerably nearer to the earth than to the
sun, shows a crescent phase, like that of the moon, and for the
same reason. As she comes more nearly into line between us and

the sun, her crescent narrows, and the horns begin to project beyond
their normal position, so that she has been seen as three quarters
of a circle, and even as a thin bright ring, with a dark interior. This
remarkable phenomenon can be seen only when Venus is within about
a degree of the sun, and no chance to observe it again will occur till
near the end of the present century; but it has been recorded in the
past by several competent observers. Such an extension of the
horns—and, above all, the ring-phase—can be explained only as
effects of twilight, the illuminated atmosphere of the planet being
visible across the narrow dark strip of its surface on the side farther
from the sun.

For the three brightest planets, then, the presence of an atmos-
phere is proved by observation, in three quite different, but equally
conclusive ways, all of which were well known to astronomers before
the end of the eighteenth century.

Later observations have added evidence of the same type—a few
white spots on Saturn, appearing at irregular intervals of some
decades, which change shape, shift, and disappear as clouds would
do—occasional though fugitive clouds, and a measurable effect of
twilight, upon Mars; and elusive markings on Venus, which can be
photographed only with ultraviolet light, and change greatly
between one evening’s observations and the next. The extent of
atmosphere can also be roughly estimated from the results of direct
telescopic observation. The surface details of Jupiter (and of
Saturn when any appear) may be seen, and photographed, close up
to the limb, despite the very oblique angle of view. It is therefore
evident that there can be no such extensive gaseous mantle as veils
the earth. At least, there is none above the visible cloud surfaces
of these great planets—how much there may be below is another
matter. The rarefied layer which exists, however, suffices to cut
down the apparent brightness of the edge of the planets’ disks. The
effect of contrast against a dark sky conceals this in an ordinary tele-
scopic view; but the first look at one of these planets in strong twi-
light shows that it is actually of surprising magnitude.

There is more “limb-light” on Mars, and there may be more
atmosphere above the visible surface—the real surface, this time;
but an atmosphere as thick as the earth’s, even if free from clouds
or haze, would produce a much greater effect.

For Venus the layer which produces the elongation of the crescent
is remarkably thin, rising only about 4,000 feet above the visible
surface. But this represents only the part of her atmosphere which
is hazy enough to be seen through the glare of our own sky close to
the sun. The top of the atmosphere must be much higher; and the
bottom, if the visible surface is composed of clouds, much lower, so
that its whole amount may be great.
ATMOSPHERES OF THE PLANETS—RUSSELL 155

The celestial body which we can observe in far the greatest detail
tells quite another story. The moon, viewed telescopically, shows no
more atmosphere—whether in the artist’s or the physicist’s sense—
than a bare plaster cast illuminated by a powerful searchlight.
Far more delicate tests are possible here than in other instances, and
neither refraction nor twilight is present to the minutest degree. Our
satellite is naked rock in vacuo. Mercury, too, shows little evidence
of atmosphere, though Antoniadi reports occasional obscuration of
dark markings, which he attributes to dust-haze.

The existence of atmospheres on the majority of the planets,
though not on all, is thus established by direct telescopic observation.
To determine their composition we must, as usual, have recourse
to the spectroscope; but we meet with two difficulties.

In the first place, many possible atmospheric constituents show no
selective absorption whatever in the region accessible to our study.
Hydrogen, nitrogen, helium, neon, and argon belong in this group,
and are hopelessly beyond the reach of our investigation. Sec-
ondly, the other gases of the earth’s atmosphere absorb too much for
our advantage. The worst by far is ozone. Though present in but
small amounts, and mainly in the higher layers, it cuts off the whole
spectrum short of 2900 angstroms, and deprives us of any hope of
studying the most interesting parts of all celestial spectra.

Were we working in the infrared, water vapor would be almost as
troublesome. There are long stretches of the solar spectrum, within
the range of present-day plates, in which we can find out little or
nothing about the sun’s own spectrum. The great wide lines of the
water-vapor bands, often overlapping, hide almost everything else.
The band near 11500 A is quite hopeless; that at 18000 would be
worse, if our photographs got so far; one near 9600 is still very bad;
while in those near 8200 and 7200 the solar lines can be picked out,
with care, among their stronger telluric neighbors.

Oxygen reveals itself by a strong band, with very regularly spaced
lines, at A7594 (Fraunhofer’s A), the weaker B band near 6867,
and the much fainter a band at 6277. ‘The terrestrial origin of all
these lines is conclusively settled by two tests: first, their changes
with the altitude of the sun (varying the air-path) and, for the
water-vapor lines, with weather conditions; second, the absence of
the Doppler shift, due to the sun’s rotation, when light from the
east and west limbs is compared. The absence of even faint com-
ponents of solar origin is explained by the high temperature, which
dissociates such molecules completely.

The intensities of these bands are in inverse order of the abundance
of the molecules which produce them—an apparent anomaly, ex-
plained by the circumstances of their origin. The ozone band is
part of the main system of the O; molecule, and, like all such bands,
156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

is very intensely absorbed, a layer of the gas, at its worst, being as
opaque as one of metal of equal mass per square centimeter. For
water vapor the main absorption bands lie far in the infrared, and
are very strong—those with which we are now concerned involve
high harmonics of the fundamental vibrations. The coefficient of
absorption, and the intensity of the bands, diminishes rapidly with
increasing order of the harmonics and diminishing wave length.

The oxygen bands are produced by a “ forbidden” transition
within the molecule, for which the probability of absorption is ex-
ceedingly small. This is why the whole mass of oxygen above our
heads (equivalent to a layer 2 kilometers thick at standard tempera-
ture and pressure) produces absorption lines no stronger than the
sodium vapor in a Bunsen flame an inch thick, which contains but
a minute percentage of the vapor of the metal. The principal bands
of oxygen, in the ultraviolet beyond 1800, are so strong that light
of shorter wave length cannot be observed at all in air. The experi-
menter must put his whole spectroscope in a gastight case, and pump
it out to an almost perfect vacuum.

In the visible spectrum, the portions cut out by oxygen or water
vapor are very small in extent; but they come exactly in the wrong
place—in other words, they hide, line for line, absorption by these
same gases which might be produced in the atmosphere of a planet.

If the planet’s atmosphere was decidedly richer in either constitu-
ent than the earth’s, we might detect the fact, for the lines in the
planet’s spectrum would be stronger than in that of the moon. Com-
parisons of this sort, however, must be made with great precautions.
The moon and planet must be at the same altitude when the observa-
tions are made (to get equal air-paths). It is not safe, either, to
observe the planet early in the evening and wait till the moon rises
to the same height, for a change in temperature may have caused
the precipitation of water out of the air, though the oxygen, of
course, remains the same. With sufficient patience, a time may be
found when planet and moon can be seen together, at equal altitudes,
and observed almost simultaneously, with the same instrument.

Early observations of this sort were supposed to show the presence
of oxygen and water vapor on Venus and Mars; but the careful and
accurate work of Campbell, in 1894, led him to the conclusion that
there was no perceptible difference in the strength of the bands in
the two cases, and hence that the amounts of these important
substances, above the visible surfaces of either planet, did not exceed
one-fourth of those above an equal area of the Earth’s.

A more delicate and very ingenious test was invented, independ-
dently, by two distinguished American observers, Lowell and Camp-
bell. When Mars (or Venus) is approaching us, or receding, most
rapidly, the lines in its spectrum are displaced by the Doppler shift,
ATMOSPHERES OF THE PLANETS—RUSSELL 157

while lines produced in the Earth’s atmosphere are of course un-
affected. Were this shift great enough the planetary and telluric
lines would appear double, and the former, even though faint, could
readily be detected. The greatest available shift is not enough to
resolve the lines completely ; but measures of the blended lines suffice
to show whether any important planetary contribution is present.
A still more delicate test is afforded by microphotometer measures
of the contours of the lines, which would reveal even a slight asym-
metry. These observations are very exacting, requiring high dis-
persion and a great deal of light, so that the best evidence is that
from the great coudé spectrograph of the 100-inch telescope at
Mount Wilson. St. John and Nicholson found, in 1922, that there
was no perceptible trace of planetary lines in Venus, and Adams and
Dunham, in 1934, have come to the same conclusion in the case of
Mars. An amount of oxygen, on either planet, equal to a thousandth
part of that above an equal area on earth, could certainly have been
detected. For water vapor, the tests have so far been less delicate,
and are not fully decisive—though the quantity present on either
planet must be small. More delicate tests, with stronger lines, may
soon be made on new red-sensitive plates.

There can be no reasonable doubt, on quite different evidence, that
some small amount of water vapor is actually present in Mars’
atmosphere. Radiometric observations of the planet’s heat show
definitely that the surface rises to temperatures above 0° Centigrade
at noon every day in the Martian tropics, and at the pole at mid-
summer, though falling far below freezing at night. The polar caps
must therefore really be composed of snow, and evaporate into water
vapor, even if the pressure is so low that the ice turns directly into
vapor without melting. The only plausible alternative suggestion—
carbon dioxide—would volatilize at much lower temperatures than
the actual polar caps do. But, judging from the amount of solar
heat available to evaporate them, the polar caps must be very thin,
probably only a few inches thick. The vapor resulting from the
gradual sublimation would never attain any considerable density,
and might easily fail of detection by the tests which have so far been
Peaeinle,

No such independent ee is available for Venus, but fate
and Dunham, in 1982, discovered, in the infrared region of her spec-
trum, three "ee ale defined bands with heads at A7820, 7883, and
\8689, and evidently of atmospheric origin. They had not then been
observed elsewhere; but an immediate suggestion regarding their
origin was obtained from the theory of band-spectra—by that time
well developed. The spacing of the individual lines in a band arises
from the rotation of the molecule and depends upon its moment of
inertia. For the new planetary band, it showed that, the otherwise
158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

unknown molecule involved must have a moment of inertia of 70.5 X
10-*° c. g. s. units. This agreed almost exactly with that of the mole-
cule of carbon dioxide—already known from laboratory observations
in the infrared. All doubt regarding this identification was removed
when Dunhan, passing light through 40 meters of CO, at a pressure
of 10 atmospheres, found that the strongest of the bands found in
Venus was faintly absorbed. Recently Adel and Slipher, using a
path of 45 meters through gas at 47 atmospheres’ pressure, have
found the bands considerably weaker than they appear in the planet.
They conclude that the amount of carbon dioxide above the visible
surface of Venus is at least 2 mile-atmospheres—that is equivalent
to a layer 2 miles thick at standard atmospheric pressure and tem-
perature. The whole amount above the planet’s solid crust may be
much greater. TFor comparison it may be noted that the whole at-
mosphere of the earth amounts to 5 mile-atmospheres, and the oxy-
gen in it to one and a quarter.

These bands do not show in the solar spectrum, even when the
sun is setting. But there is very little CO, in the earth’s atmosphere,
and the whole amount in the path, even at sunset, amounts to only
30 feet under standard conditions.

The weak absorption in these bands, like that in the visible bands
of water vapor, arises because they involve high harmonics of the
fundamental vibration-frequencies—in this case the fifth.

So far we have had to do with bands of familar and readily
identified molecules; but the major planets have been much more
puzzling.

Jupiter shows a conspicuous band in the orange, which was dis-
covered visually by Huggins in the earliest days of spectroscopy, and
fainter ones in the green. These appear more strongly in Saturn,
but only in the spectrum of the ball of the planet, and not at all in
that of the ring—which might be anticipated, since the ring consists
of a multitude of tiny isolated satellites, and should be quite devoid
of atmosphere. Uranus, though its light is faint, shows the same
bands, much more strongly, and many others in addition. One of
these, which closely coincides with the F line of hydrogen (\ 4861)
led Huggins to conclude that the planet’s atmosphere was rich in
hydrogen.

This interpretation, though quite permissible at the time, was
erroneous, for the line is absorbed only by dissociated atoms of hy-
drogen, which will not be present except at very high temperatures.

The bands cut out so much of the red and orange light that the
whole disk of Uranus appears decidedly green—an unusual color,
noticed from the time of the planet’s discovery.

In Neptune’s spectrum, the bands are of enormous strength, cut-
ting out the red almost entirely and making the planet look still
ATMOSPHERES OF THE PLANETS—RUSSELL 159

greener. They are hard to observe visually in so faint an object, and
the full realization of their intensity came only with the admirable
photograph of V. M. Slipher, in 1907. In later years, and with
modern plates, Slipher has extended his observations far into the
red, finding bands of ever-increasing strength—up to A 10000 for
Jupiter, where there is light enough to follow the spectrum farthest.

For more than 60 years after their first discovery, and 25 after
Slipher’s spectrograms, these bands presented one of the principal
unsolved puzzles of spectroscopy—for no one had duplicated them in
the laboratory. To be sure, one group, near A 7200, agrees fairly well
with a band of water vapor—but the still stronger water-bands
deeper in the red are absent, so that this must be a chance coincidence.

When the radiometric measures of Coblentz and Lampland, and of
Nicholson and Pettit, showed that the temperature of the visible sur-
faces of Jupiter and Saturn must be well below —100° Centigrade—
while Uranus and Neptune are doubtless colder—the range of pos-
sibilities was very much narrowed. But it was not until 1932 that a
young and brilliant German physicist, Rupert Wildt, realized the
solution of the problem.

Other gases, like water vapor and carbon dioxide, have strong
fundamental absorptions in the infrared, and fainter harmonics in
the more accessible part of the spectrum, which demand a long
absorbing path in the laboratory to bring them out. Utilizing ob-
servations of this sort, Wildt showed that certain bands in the
spectrum of Jupiter near » 6470 and A 7920 agreed with those of
ammonia, and others, at » 6190, » 7260, and A 8860, with bands of
methane. The original comparison was not quite conclusive, for
with the moderate dispersion then employed the planetary bands
had not been adequately resolved into their component lines. This
was soon accomplished, by Dunham, who found so complete a coinci-
dence of the accurately measured individual lines that both identi-
fications were put beyond all question. For ammonia more than 60
lines were found to agree, and for methane 18 lines in part of one
band. Some expected band lines were naturally blended with solar
lines, but not one of importance failed to appear.

From these comparisons Dunham estimates that the quantity of
ammonia gas above the visible surface of Jupiter is equivalent to a
layer 10 meters thick under standard conditions. In Saturn it is
less.

The climax of the tale came this year, when Adel and Slipher an-
nounced that practically all the bands had been identified, and were
due to methane. The 45-meter path and the 40-atmosphere pressure
got enough of the gas into the way of the light to produce bands
intermediate in intensity between those in Jupiter and in Saturn.
160 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1935

At this high pressure the lines flowed together, and produced dif-
fuse bands; but the agreement of these with the planetary bands was
so complete as to be decisive.

A further, and wholly conclusive, test could be added. The funda-
mental frequencies of vibration of the methane molecule were al-
ready known, from observations in the infrared. For the higher
harmonics of these vibrations the frequencies are not exact multi-
ples of the lowest, but nevertheless bear a simple numerical relation
to them (as is well known in the case of other gases). Applying
this test, the strongest bands (including Huggins’ band in the orange,
and the one jcoumeident ee as blue nueueeen Eee) were found to be
