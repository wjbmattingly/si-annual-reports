REPORT OF PROFESSOR BAIRD,

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR 1880.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith a report of the
condition of the Smithsonian Institution for the year 1880.

As heretofore, in addition to matters pertaining strictly to the Smith-
sonian Institution, I shall give an account of the operations connected
with the National Museum, placed by Congress in charge of the Smith-
sonian Institution, as well as of those of the United States Fish Com-
mission, of which the present Secretary is the chief officer.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
INTRODUCTORY.

In the report for 1879 the announcement was made of an appropria-
tion by Congress for the purpose of constructing a new building for the
service of the National Museum, and of the commencement and rapid
progress of the work upon the same. I now have the pleasure of stat-
ing that the work has been in the greater part completed during the
year 1880, and that a portion of the building is already occupied for its
legitimate objects.

The details of progress and completion will be given in full in the
report of the building committee and of the architect, to which I would
refer. It will be sufficient to say here that the work has all been done
within the estimates, and that it promises to be even more suitable to
_ its purpose than was anticipated. All the requirements in regard to
light and heat are fully met ; and in this respect, and in that of its slight
cost in proportion to the space obtained, the building is believed to have
no parallel in the country. Including the building proper, the steam
heating apparatus, the gas and water fixtures, and all their accessories,
the cost has amounted to less than $3 per square foot of ground floor,
and to about 6 cents per cubic foot of entire capacity.

Another noteworthy event of the year has been the election of Mr.
James A. Garfield, one of the Regents of the Institution, to the office of
President of the United States.

of the year 1879 were presented. Prior to that date a bill had been
introduced into the Senate by Mr. Booth, a Regent of the Institution,
providing for the erection in the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution
of a statue of Professor Henry. This, in a somewhat modified form,
passed the Senate and House and became a law by the signature of the
President on the 1st of June, 1850.*

The total appropriation was $15,000, and it was agreed that one-fourth
should be paid on the completion of the design, one-fourth on the com-
pletion of the model in clay, one-fourth on the completion in bronze,
and the remainder on the placing of the statue in the Smithsonian
grounds.

Memorial representations of Professor Henry.—The Institution is in-
debted to Mr. F. Gutekunst, of Philadelphia, for copies of an excellent
phototype of the late Secretary, Professor Henry, copied from a photo-
graph taken by the same artist during the time of the Centennial Exhibi-
tion. The portrait is a mechanical imprint of cabinet size, a close re-
production of the original photograph.

Although a partial account of various portraitures of Professor Henry
was given in the last annual report, it may not be improper, with the
view of making the record more complete, to repeat those formerly men-
tioned, as well as to indicate additional likenesses.

Of original photographs, there are one small front face (carte size) by
H. Ulke; one profile head (carte size) by T. W. Smillie; one small size,
full-length, standing, by the same; one front view of head and bust, cabi-
net size, by the same, and one, imperial size, by the same; one, carte
size, and four different views, cabinet size, by M. B. Brady, of Wash-

*In view of the adjournment of the Board of Regents at the time of the passage of
the law, it was impossible to take any formal action in the matter: but in the exer-
cise of its general discretion, the executive committee entered into correspondence with
Mr. Story, the artist designated in the act as the sculptor, and obtained from him his
acceptance of the trust, and some suggestions as to the design and the general condi-
tions of carrying it out.

As the executive committee was doubtful as to its authority to carry out fully the
yrovisions of the proposed agreement with Mr. Story, the members of the Board were
communicated with by letter and their assent obtained to such action as the com-
mittee might deem best in the premises.

It was therefore thought best to make a provisional ratification of the agreement
with Mr. Story, the session of Congress in the beginning of December rendering it
possible to obtain the action of the Board before anything could be done by the sculp-
ter. A meeting of the Board therefore, was held on the 8th day of December, 1880,
and the action of the exec utive committee was approved and authority given to carry
jt into effect. A dispatch was sent by Atlantic cable to Mr. Story, and the work, ac-
cording to a recent communication from Hon. George P. Marsh, United States minis-
er at Rome, Mr. Story’s place of residence, is progressing satisfactorily.

ington; two, cabinet size, by A. Gardner, of Washington; three, cab-
inet size, by S. M. Fassett, of Washington; and one of cabinet size and
one of imperial size, both by F. Gutekunst, of Philadelphia.

Of crayon heads of life size, there are one by H. Ulke, from an oil
pertrait by the same; one by Mrs. Fassett, from a portrait by 8. M. Fas-
sett; one by Mrs. M. G. Dayton, from a photograph by Fassett; one by
R. Reichmann, from a photograph by T. W. Smillie; and one by A. J.
Janvier, from a photograph by M. B. Brady.

Of wood-cuts, one was published in an “Account of the Smithsonian
Institution,” by W. J. Rhees, Washington, 1855; and one in Harper’s
Weekly of June 1, 1878, accompanying an obituary notice.

Of engravings on steel, one was produced by L. lL. Punderson, from
a painting by Mooney, and published at Boston in the Annual of Sei-
entific Discovery for 1852; one was engraved by G. R. Hall, from a
photograph, and published at New York in the Eclectic Magazine for
March, 1875; one was engraved by 8S. Hollyer, from a photograph, and
published at New York, in Appleton’s Annual Cyclopedia for 1879;
and one of small size, vignette, was engraved by the Bureau of En-
graving and Printing of the Treasury Department, at Washington, 1880,
for publication in the Memorial volume ordered by Congress.

Of oil paintings, of bust or half-length life size, one was painted by H.
Ulke, of Washington; one was painted by W. Ingalls; one by Thomas
Le Clear, of New York; and one by Theodore Kaufmann, of Washington.

Of busis in plaster, one of small size was modeled by C. W. Burton, of
Washington; one of life size by Clarke Mills, of Washington; one of
life size by Fisk Mills, of Washington; and one of life size by Mrs.
C. S. Brooks, of New York.

In the last report it was stated that Congress had authorized the
printing in one volume of the memorial services held in honor of Pro-
fessor Henry in the House of Representatives on the 16th of January,
1879. Of this volume a large edition was ordered; and after various
delays, beyond the control of the Institution, it will soon appear in a well-
printed form, accompanied by an excellent portrait engraved by the
Treasury Department. There has been a great demand for this work
from ali quarters of the country, and copies ef it will be placed in all
the principal libraries at home and abroad.

Smithson’s Effects.—By the 6th section of the organizing act of Con-
gress of August, 1846, it was provided that “the minerals, books, manu-
seripts, and other property of James Smithson, which have been received
by the Government of the United States, and are now placed in the
Department of State, shall be removed to said Institution, and shall be
preserved separate and apart from other property of the Institution.”

The books belonging to the founder of the Institution have been cata-
logued and placed in a handsome walnut case with plate-glass front.
They consist of 45 duodecimo, 110 octavo, and 26 quarto volumes, many
of them in a worn, and a few ina dilapidated condit on. It has been
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

thought proper, however, to leave them exactly as they were when form-
ing the library of Mr. Smithson.

Such of the relics of Smithson and his family as have come into pos-
session of the Institution have also been appropriately arranged in frames
and placed on exibition in the Regents’ room. They consist of the follow-
ing articles:

1. An oil portrait of Smithson as an Oxford student.

2. An oil portrait in miniature of Smithson, painted by Johns, at Aix-
la-Chapelle, in 1816.

3. An oil portrait in miniature of Col. Henry Louis Dickinson, a half-
brother of James Smithson.

4, The dinner invitation card of Smithson.

5. His visiting card, used in Paris.

6. A copy of his will in his own handwriting.

7. A manuscript in his handwriting.

8. A commission from George III to Major Henry Louis Dickinson,
as Lieutenant-Colonel, dated 1st Jan., 1800.

- 9. A commission from the same King to Lient.-Colonel H. L. Dickin-
son, as Colonel of the 84th Regt., dated 4th Aug., 1808.

Smithson’s Tomb.—Itis, of course, eminently proper that the Smithsonian
Institution should do all in its power to preserve the remembrance of its
great founder, Mr. James Smithson ; and an endeavor toward this end has
been made by the publication of a Life of Smithson and a reprint of all
lis works. In the efforts to obtain a memorial of some kind of the last
resting place of Mr. Smithson, at Genoa, in Italy, a photograph of the
tomb was obtained from Mr. Hazelton, the United States consul in
that city, with a statement of its present condition. In accordance
with a suggestion from him he was authorized to put the monument
in thorough repair and to arrange to have it kept in good condition at
the expense of the Institution. The monument is an appropriate and
substantial one, and as long as the Institution is in existence this
reminder of its founder should be carefully protected.

INAUGURAL RECEPTION.

Reference should be made to the granting of the use of the new Museum
building for the purpose of holding the inaugural reception in honor of
the newly-elected President. A petition to that effect, from a committee
of citizens of Washington, was presented at a meeting of the Board on
the 8th of December, and the following resolution, granting the request,
was passed :

‘“ Whereas the new Museum building is unfinished and not ready for
occupancy of the government collections, and whereas such a contin-

gency will not again occur, and no precedent is to be given for the use
of the building for other purposes:

“Resolved, That the use of the new National Museum building be
granted for the inaugural reception of the President of the United
States, on the 4th of March, 1881, and that the Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution be authorized to make all necessary arrangements
for this purpose.”
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

Subsequently application was made to the Institution by several
other committees for the use of the building after the inaugural recep-
tion on the 4th of March. These were all refused, although the objects
in view were praiseworthy in themselves.

FINANCES.

General Condition.—It is believed that the finances of the Institution
have never been in amore favorable condition than they are at the pres-
ent time.*

As the income of the Smithson fund is a definite one and can be
calculated upon almost to a cent, year by year, it is, of course, practicable
to estimate the expenditures with much precision. Nothing but some
calamity, such as the destruction or serious injury of the building, is
likely to involve an outlay that would seriously interfere with the general
programme for the year.

Under the general limitations of the appropriations made by the
Board of Regents, for the different classes of expenditure, it 1s, of course,
amatter of proper business management to incur no liabilities for the
year beyond those that the fund is able to meet; and a strict adher-
ence to this rule has prevented any embarrassment in regard to pay-
ments. There has been no indebtedness at the end of the year except

* that for some incomplete publications, and for which the necessary pro-
vision had been made.

Reference has been made in this report to several bequests, by which
the principal of the fund has been increased, the first of these being
that of Mr. James Hamilton, of Carlisle, which, amounting to $1,000
was added to the principal of the Smithson fund in the United States
Treasury.

Habel Bequest.—An account was given in the last report, of the
bequest of $402.59 to the Smithsonian Institution by Dr. 8. Habel, of
New York. By authority of the executive committee, the sum of
$97.41 was appropriated from the annual income of the Institution and
added to the above in order to make up the amount of $500. This
was then deposited in the United States Treasury to the credit of the
Smithsonian endowment, under the provisions of law.

The Habel bequest thus slightly enlarged and added to the Hamilton
fund of $1,000, making the sum of $1,500, will yield annually at 6 per
cent. an income of $90. It is proposed to devote this special income to
the prosecution of ethnological and archeological research.

The funds of the Institution now in the treasury, according to the
report of the executive committee, amount, with these two bequests, to

*The endowment (referred to elsewhere) is for the most part in the U. 8. Treasury,
where the principal can never be touched, and it yields an annual interest of six per
cent. A small portion is invested in Virginia State securities.
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

$651,500, leaving a balance of $348,500 necessary to make up the million
dollars authorized by Congress as its perpetual endowment. It is very
much to be hoped that some of our wealthy men may feel inclined to
contribute a part or even the whole of this sum, as it is believed that
no more desirable contribution to science and education could be devised.
The machinery of the Institution is extensive enough to administer a
much larger amount than it at present possesses, so that no part of such
contribution would be required for salaries, rent, or other. attendant
expenses. It may safely be said that the addition of one-half to the
present fund would at least double the efficiency of the Institution in
carrying out its mission of the “increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.”

Relation to the National Museum.—It is, of course, fully understood.
that while the Smithsonian Institution is supported and administered
at the expense of the Smithson endowment, the cost of carrying on the
National Museum is necessarily defrayed entirely by Congressional
appropriations. Although the estimates presented by the Institution
from time to time as desirable for the prosecution of the work have
sometimes been reduced by the Congressional committees, there is no
reason to complain of the feeling of Congress toward this interest, and it
is confidently believed that as the plans in regard to the reorganization
of the Museum in the new building are carried out a cordial support
will be extended in the future. The appropriations required for the
maintenance of an establishment five times as great as the present one
must necessarily be largely increased, although not in proportion to its
expansion. It is evident that to supply a building covering two anda
halfacres of ground with cases willrequire a large expenditure of money
until they are completed. It is estimated that the cases needed will
in a continuous line extend a mile and a half; and of course several
years will be required for their proper construction. After this the cost
of the Museum will be essentially that of maintenance only, and be
reduced much below the figures for the fiscal year of 1881.

BUILDINGS.

Smithsonian Building.—The disastrous fire which destroyed a large
portion of the roof and upper story of the Patent Office building in the
summer of 1877, gave rise to the formation of a commission of govern-
ment officers, consisting of Col. Thomas L. Casey, Mr. E. Clark, and Mr.
J. G. Hill, to inspect all buildings of the government in the city, and to
report what measures might be necessary to better secure them and
their contents from injury by fire. The Smithsonian building was one
of those carefully examined by the commission, and it was recommended
that iron doors should be placed in the passage ways between certain
rooms. An appropriation of $3,000 was subsequently made by Con-
gress for this purpose; and a contract for its execution was accordingly
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. (

entered into with Mr. George L. Damon, of Boston. After considerable
delay in the performance of this contract, the doors were delivered and
put in place by Mr. Damon, to the entire satisfaction of the executive
committee. This arrangement has greatly promoted the safety of the
building and its contents from the risk of the spreading of any fires which
might accidentally occur within its walls. A few additional changes
are still desirable to give still further security to the public property
placed in the charge of the Institution.

For the purpose of facilitating the operations of the freight and trans-
portation department of the Institution, an elevator was constructed in
1879, by which packages could be carried from the southeastern entrance
of the building, either to the basement floor below, or to the document
room above. During 18890, the work has been completed by the erec-
tion of a very substantial platform outside of the door, on which boxes
can be conveniently delivered, or from which they can be shipped.
From the rapidly increasing amount of transportation connected with
the natural history operations and the scientific exchanges, every facility
in the handling of packages, by economizing labor, becomes an item
of importance.

For many years a pump at the southeastern corner of the Smithsonian
building has furnished a supply of excellent water, esteemed throughout
the neighborhood. Although the introduction of the Potomac water
naturally reduced considerably the demand upon this pump it was still
constantly drawn upon by persens passing by, and was used for supply-
ing the water-coolers in the building. A chemical and microscopic ex-
amination of the water made during the summer showed that it was not
entirely wholesome, in consequence as was thought, of the rotting of the
inner wooden lining of the well. As a necessary step to the improve-
ment of the sanitary condition of the water the original lining was
replaced by one of brick. An iron pump was also substituted for the
former wooden one. These repairs have been satisfactorily completed,
and the water is now restored to its original quality.

The protection of the buildings in charge of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and the preservation of the property contained therein require, of
course, the vigilance of competent watchmen, both day and night.
One of these, Mr. T. 8S. Nelligar, a night watchman in the new
museum building, has been made a special policeman by the Board of
police.

The situation of the Smithsonian building, so far to the south of the
principal avenues of travel in Washington, renders it somewhat incon-
venient of access, especially during inclement weather. At present
the nearest street railways are those along Seventh street and along
Twelfth street. The completion cf the new building for the ac-
commodation of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing of the
Treasury Department, on South B street (at the corner of TFour-
teenth street), as also of the new National Museum building, on
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the same street (near Ninth street), occasioning a large increase of travel
in that direction, induced the proprietors of the so-called “ Belt Line”
of railway to memorialize Congress for permission to change the track of
their road by extending it down Fourteenth street to South B street,
thence along South B street past the entrance to the National Museum,
and thence south along Ninth street to Maryland avenue, along which
it now passes. Congress has not yet taken any action on this memorial.
Should that body authorize the proposed change of route it will add
greatly to the convenience of all who are interested in that line of travel.

Armory Building—The Armory building is still in use as the deposi-
tory of the Centennial and other collections belonging to the govern-
ment. These articles will be removed to the new Museum during the
present year, but as there is no provision in this building for storage of
boxes, packing materials, &e., a part of the Armory will always be re-
quired for this purpose. It is also contemplated to use one of the halls
or stories of the Armory for the storage of the large amount of property
belonging to the United States Fish Commission, and the lower fleor
may perhaps be occupied by aquaria, hatching apparatus, We.

Laboratory of Natural History.—The building erected as a laboratory
of natural history and a photographie atelier in which to prepare speci-
mens, illustrations, We., for the Centennial Exhibition is still devoted to
similar uses. <A large number of photographs of fish, ethnologica, &c.,
have been made during the year by the artist of the Institution, Mr.
T. W. Smillie.

Mr. Joseph Palmer and his son have continued in this building the
preparation of plaster casts of fish, reptiles, and antiquities, and in
another apartment these have been colored by the artist, Mr. A. Z.
Shindler, the reproductions thus furnished being admirable fac-similes
of the living or original objects, and attracting general commendation.

Another large room occupied by Mr. Henry Marshall, the taxidermist,
has mainly been devoted to the mounting of birds and mammals.

In the new Museum building very commodious apartments have been
assigned to the photographer and other artists, a large and well arranged
sky-light has been provided, and everything will be done by the
Institution to secure the best possible results with all the apparatus
and appliances obtainable. To obtain ample working rooms in case
of an emergency, however, the tanks, dark-room, sky-light, &c., in the
old building will be left undisturbed so that if necessary an extra force
of photographers may be enabled to carry on their work.

ROUTINE WORK OF THE INSTITUTION.

Administration.—No change has been made in the officers and assist-
ants of the Institution since the death of the late Secretary. Mr. Wil-
liam J. Rhees, who has been chief clerk since June, 1853, still discharges

}
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

the duties of executive officer with zeal, industry, and efficiency. Dur-
ing the absence of the Secretary for several months in the year, when
on duty connected with the United States Fish Commission, Mr. Khees
has been intrusted with the general administration of the business of
the Institution; having also the charge of publications, of financial de-
tails, of the purchase of supplies, and of the supervision of clerks and
employés, &c. The operations connected with the erection of the new
Museum building have added greatly to the labors and responsibilities
of the chief clerk, as well as of the other officers of the Institution.

The correspondence is in charge of Mr. Daniel Leech, who has been
in the Institution since 1867, and who has also acted as the secretary
of the National Museum Building Commission. In both these relations
his duties have been satisfactorily and creditably performed.

The division of accounts has been in charge of Mr. Clarence Bb. Young,
who entered the service of the Institution in 1870. To his duties as
bookkeeper is added that of the charge of the physical apparatus, the re-
vision of proof, mathematical calculations, and other work requiring
skill as a computer, and knowledge of physics and technology:

To Mr. Wm. B. Taylor has been assigned the duty of preparing re-
plies to correspondents involving scientific details in special depart-
ments; and he has also edited—under the direction of the special com-
mittee of the Board of Regents—the ‘“ Memorial Volume” in honor of
Professor Henry.

The management of the literary and scientific exchanges has been
intrusted to Messrs. H. Diebitsch and G. H. Boehmer. The labor in
this department has grown to large proportions, and is increasing with
every year.

The reception, entry, and transfer of books for the library are in
charge of Miss Jane A. Turner, whose faithful and intelligent services
have frequently been recognized by my predecessor.

The translation of French and German letters and various clerical
duties have been well performed by Mrs. L. Stoerzer, while the filing of
letters, indexing, making out receipts and orders for books, and various
other duties have been assigned to Miss M. EH. Griffin, Miss H. de C.
Daingerfield, and Miss F. R. Schaeffer, who deserve commendation for
their faithfui services.

It is also proper to mention the fidelity and efficiency in the subordi-
nate duties assigned them of Messrs. Henry Gass and John 8. Pollock.
Mr. Solomon G. Brown, in charge of the transportation department,
has discharged his duties satisfactorily.

Correspondence.—A. most important branch of Smithsonian opera-
tions is that of correspondence, which expands from year to year in the
direct ratio of the ever widening influence and increasing activity of
the establishment. The principal consideration, however, in this de-
partment, is not the amount but the continuity of the labor involved,
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

since the rules of the Institution, while they insure a respectful reply
to all communications demanding an answer, also require that each
day’s mail shall be attended to on the day of its receipt, excepting where
immediate action is impracticable. In other departments of the Insti-
tution, as, for instance, that of publications, operations being more or
less dependent upon outside agencies, there is sometimes a temporary
respite; but in the department of correspondence this is absolutely im-
possible.

As during the past three years, so during 1880, the number of com-
munications has been very great in regard to anthropology, natural
history, mineralogy, exchanges, employment, and publications. In re-
gard to the first of these the immediate cause has been the unprecedented
interest awakened in the subject of anthropology by the Smithsonian
circular to which attention was called in the report of the Secretary
for 1878.

As the near completion and occupation of the new building for the
National Museum has become generally known, hundreds of colleges,
as well as proprietors of private collections, aware that the Institution
has only awaited the room requisite for the collation of its vast stores
of specimens of natural history and the elimination of the duplicates
previous to the distribution of the latter, have hastened to apply
for a share in this material, the applications in almost every instance
necessitating answer by reason of inquiries for information upon points
not covered by any of the many printed circulars of the Institution.

In mineralogy the number of applicants for information has largely
increased during the past year. Supposed discoveries of mineral wealth
still continue to be reported to the Institution, and specimens are for-
warded for examination. Qualitative determinations only, however, are
made gratuitously for individuals or for private or commercial purposes;
but these generally suffice. In making known the results of mineral
examinations the mineralogist presents his reports to the Secretary, on
blanks prepared for the purpose. If approved the substance of his re-
port is communicated by letter to the party submitting the specimens.

The increased activity in the department of exchanges has not only
continued, but this source of correspondence has during the past year
proved far more productive of communications than was anticipated;
and while the increase in the number of these has been marked, in very
many instances their nature has been such as to call for a general review
of the entire subject of exchanges, thus giving to the replies, on the part
of the Institution, the character more of memoirs than of letters. ‘This
feature of a large part of the exchange correspondence grew out of the
action of the Paris Geographical Congress of 1875, in recommending to
the nations of the world the establishment of a system for the inter-
change of the official documents of their respective governments, which
recommendation has recently been favorably acted upon by a number
of governments, including the United States, which has designated the
Smithsonian Institution as its agent in the premises.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. mL

With reference to applications for employment, it may be said that
while in no single year of its history could the Institution claim en-
tire exemption from the receipt of this class of communications, the
year 1880 marks an epoch in this respect as being the period in which

the maximum number has claimed attention. Indeed, it is far from an

exaggeration to say that written and oral applications of this kind
have averaged half a dozen a day. As a majority of those in writing
are in the nature of requests through members of Congress, or other
persons of prominence, a double answer frequently becomes necessary,
one to the applicant and a second to the party through whom the claim
is presented, the latter generally necessitating a detailed explanation
of the cause for the refusal.

Lastly, an important part of the correspondence consists in the con-
stantly increasing demands for the Smithsonian publications. With
the increase of popular education throughout the land, and the springing
up of new villages or towns, new public libraries and scientific societies
are started, and very soon an application is made to the Smithsonian
Institution for its publications. Applications of this kind are required
to be entered on printed forms, and forwarded through the member of
Congress representing the district in which the establishment is located,
the member thus becoming sponsor for the library or society, so far
as its existence and standing are concerned.

The requests from individuals for publications, however, are not in-
frequently difficult to deal with. In a country where all are equal it
is sometimes difficult to satisfactorily explain why each individual
cannot receive this or that publication gratis. It is often useless to
state that the publications of the Institution are issued at the expense
of its own fund, and not at that of the general government; that this
fund is so limited as to forbid the issuing of more than a comparatively
small number of copies; that with these both hemispheres must be
supplied; that they are distributed free of expense to public libraries
and colleges throughout the country on condition that they shall be
accessible at all times to any who may desire to consult them; that
to individuals, other than specialists and contributors of material for
the national collections, they are sold at about the cost of paper and
printing; or, that the desired memoir, or memoirs, will be cheerfully
furnished in return for desirable objects for the National Museum. It
might reasonably be supposed that a statement of this character would
prove satisfactory ; but, unfortunately, this has not been our experience,
such a result being the exception, not the rule, and shortly the demand
is renewed through the member of Congress from the district in which
the applicant resides.

ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS BY TELEGRAPH.

The existing arrangements for disseminating telegraphic announce-
ments of astronomical discoveries, particularly between America and
i - REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Europe, were set forth in the last report. This Institution is the center
of diffusion throughout our own country, of astronomical announce-
ments received by telegraph from foreign countries, and in like manner
acts as the medium of communication of American discoveries through
Atlantic cables to the European observatories of Greenwich, Paris,
Berlin, Vienna, and Pulkova; from which points the information is
spread throughout their respective countries. Through the courtesy of
various telegraph companies, the information received from abroad is
transmitted to the principal observatories (some seventeen in number)
throughout the United States, and also to the “ Associated Press,” free of
charge. This generous concession to the urgent needs of astronomical
research and progress is so valuable a boon to science that it should
annually receive a grateful.and public acknowledgment. The com-
panies to whose liberality we are thus indebted are: The Atlantic Cable
Company, The United States Cable Company, The Pacific Cable Com-
pany, The Western Union Telegraph Company. To these must be
added the Northwestern Telegraph Company, which gives gratuitous
transmission of astronomical telegrams to Northfield, Minn.

Prot. B. A. Gould, the eminent superintendent of the observatory of Cor-
doba, of the Argentine Republic, when making a visit lately to the United
States on his way to Europe, had some conference with several leading
astronomers respecting certain proposed improvements in the exchange
of telegrams, and of the character of the abbreviations to be employed.
These suggestions, presented to the Institution, were by it embodied in
a circular, which was referred to the directors of the different observa-
tories scattered over our country soliciting their opinion as to the
desirability of the changes proposed. Dr. C. H. F. Peters, of the
observatory at Clinton, N. Y., to whom the original suggestion of tele-
graphic announcement is mainly due, was particularly desired to give
the subject his consideration. When the various responses to these cir-
culars of inquiry are received, it is intended to have them carefully con-
sidered by a commission of astronomers, and the formulas which appear
to meet the general approval will be finally adopted as the uniform and
permanent method of designation.

The announcements of astronomical discoveries made during the past
year are as follows:

An arrangement in regard to the exchange of telegrams of astro-
nomical discoveries was proposed by Lord Lindsay in connection with
the working of his private observatory of Dun Echt, in Scotland, and
the Institution was invited to exchange therewith telegraphic commu-
nications in regard to the discovery of comets and asteroids. After
further conference with the director in charge of the observatory of
Greenwich it was concluded that dispatches sent to the latter would
answer all the purposes by simply providing for the prompt repetition
of these dispatches from Greenwich to Dun Echt.

EXCHANGES.

International Exchanges.—The system of international exchanges which
has been successfully prosecuted for thirty years may be regarded as
having been inaugurated by this Institution. A method of exchange
had indeed been carried on for some years previously by Mr. Alexander
Vattemare, of Paris, France, but on essentially different principles. Mr.
Vattemare’s plan consisted in obtaining duplicate volumes and contri-
butions from booksellers, literary and scientific societies, public libraries,
and other sources, and then from the collected mass making to his
various contributors returns, at his own discretion, of what appeared to
him a fair equivalent. Such a method of course presupposed a great
familiarity with the actual possessions of the various bodies in corres-
pondence, as well as of their needs; and while undoubtedly beneficial in
some cases, was likely to be entirely unsuccessful in others.

The Smithsonian system consists substantially in offering to cor-
respondents a safe and gratuitous channel of intercommunication, each
being responsible to the other for the amount and character or value of
the packages interchanged, the Institution assuming, between them,
only the relation or function of carrier. It naturally happens, however,
not unfrequently, that the Institution is requested to designate suitable
parties to whom publications of a particular character should be sent.
Such a request is responded to, either by furnishing such lists of names
or societies as may be supposed to be desirable, or by undertaking the
actual assignment of such works as are submitted to its discretion, dur-
ing the process of making up its own packages.
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Attention has frequently been called in previous reports to the steadily
increasing expense attending this system of international exchanges.
The cost of prosecuting various researches and investigations and the
general expenses of the Institution being provided for, the residue of
the income has usually been divided between the department of publica-
tions and that of international exchanges. So long as the latter interest
required the expenditure of but a few thousand dollars, a considerable
amount was available for the former, and the Institution was thus in a
condition to publish many important memoirs; but of late years the
cost of maintaining the exchange system has increased at so rapid a
rate (the expense for 1879 and 1880 having reached nearly $10,000 each
year) that only an inadequate and continually decreasing balance is
available for the very important department of publication of original
contributions to knowledge.

The official designation of the Smithsonian Institution by the State
Department, as the American agent of international exchange has
naturally, with the rapid extension of its operations, also added con-
siderably to the burden of expense.

In view of these circumstances, a communication was addressed to
the honorable Secretary of State, some months ago, by the Secretary of
the Institution, asking that an application be made to Congress for a
special appropriation toward defraying the expenses of international
exchanges, to be disbursed under fhe direction of the State Department.
This favor has been promised, and it is hoped that the desired relief
will be granted.

Asa result of the convention already referred to as held in Paris a
few years ago, for promoting international exchanges between the vari-
ous governinents of the world, the interest and exertions in this direc-
tion are slowly extending. In addition to the commissions and bureaus
of Belgium, France, Holland, and the Confederacy of Switzerland, men-
tioned in the last report as co-operating with the United States govern-
ment, the Government of Brazil has since been included in the move-
ment, and arrangements between it and the Institution have been sat-
isfactorily adopted. A disposition to co-operate in this work has also
been expressed by the Governments of Russia and of Italy, but no defi-
nite arrangements have as yet been concluded by them.

The interchange of seientific publications between the United States
and Cuba has for a number of years been effected through the agency
of Prof. Felipe Poey, of the University of Havana; and to that emi-

nent naturalist, for both the extent and the efficiency of his labors,
this Institution is greatly indebted. As the packages transmitted have
been addressed to Professor Poey, questions have constantly arisen as to
the duties charged to the Institution, in addition to the other cost of the
enterprise. As it was thought unjust that the Smithsonian fund should
be taxed with the entire expenses of this interchange, in both directions,
while the main benefits of the transactions were experienced by Cuba,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 1b

the subject was referred to his excellency Senor Don Felipe Mendez de
Vigo, minister from Spain; through whose courteous efforts, a very sat-
isfactory arrangement has been efiected, whereby the governor-general
of Cuba, in his official capacity, takes charge of our packages and de-
livers them to the University of Havana for distribution to their re-
spective addresses. This arrangement constitutes in effect an additional
link in the chain of international governmentagencies already referred to.

The total number of establishments outside of the United States with
which correspondence and exchange have been conducted amounts to
2,602—an increase of about 120 over the list of 1879. The number of
packages received from Europe for distribution in the United States
during the past year amounted to 6,670; the number of packages from
the United States received for transmission abroad has amounted to
14,175; making an aggregate of 20,845 packages.

The parcels received from Europe for distribution in America are gen-
erally forwarded to their respective destinations in smaller bundles, or
in paper wrappers. The parcels received for transmission to foreign
countries are carefully packed in boxes. Of these, there were shipped
during the past year 268; occupying a bulk of 1,976 cubic feet, and
weighing 60,300 pounds.

As heretofore, the Institution is greatly indebted to the lines of ocean
steamers between the United States and other countries of the world ;
and grateful acknowledgment is due particularly to the agents of the
following companies for the continuation of their important favors in
the free transmission of Smithsonian packages: Anchor Steamship Com-
pany, Atlas Steamship Company, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique,
Cunard Steamship Company, Hamburg American Packet Company,
Inman Steamship Company, Merchants’ Line of Steamers, Netherlands
American Steam Navigation Company, New York and Brazil Steamship
Company, New York and Mexico Steamship Company, North German
Lloyds Steamship Company, Pacific Mail Steamship Company, Pacific
Steam Navigation Company, Panama Railroad Company, Steamship
Lines for Brazil, Texas, Florida, and Nassau, N. P., White Cross Line
of Antwerp.

The railroad companies connecting Washington and Baltimore and
New York have also continued their favor of special rates of charges for
freight. These are the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad, and the Baltimore and Potomae Railroad.

Acknowledgments are also due to the foreign ministers and consuls
of the various governments, for their assistance in taking charge of the
packages intended for the countries which they respectively represent,
and transmitting them with care to their destination.

In connection with the establishment of definite relations between
this Institution and the French commission of international exchanges
(a branch of the department of the ministry of public instruction), the
French Transatlantic Steamship Company has, through its agent, M.

Government Document Exchange.—In addition to its general function of
intermediary. between the institutions of the New World and the Old,
the Smithsonian Institution has been for some years the agent of the gov-
ernment for the exchange of public documents and other official! publi-
cations, in the interest of the Library of Congress, and under the provi-
sions of law. By act of Congress, fifty copies of all publications of the
United States Government, whether ordered for the use of Congress or
of the departments, are available for distribution, under the direction
of the Joint Library Committee of the two Houses of Congress, to such
foreign governments as agree to make a corresponding return. These
returns, when received, are forwarded directly to the Library of Con-

DISTRIBUTION.

Distribution of Publications.—One of the operations of the Institution
requiring constant attention and involving much labor and expense is
that of distribution of publications. Aside from the sending of books
and parcels through the great international exchange system there is a
constant demand upon the institution for works it has published or those
of a scientific character supposed to be at its disposal. These demands
have become sonumerous and are made by so many persons unknown to
the officers, while the supply ot books is so limited, that it became neces.
sary to adopt a new rule in reference to distribution. Each applicant
jS how required to furnish evidence that he has contributed in some
way to the library, museum, or collections of the Institution, and an ex-
change is thus established, intended to supersede the former promiscu-
ous method of bestowing a gift. It may be mentioned that latterly no
lists have been kept of persons entitled to receive from year to year the
publications or even the reports of the Institution. It is necessary that
direct application be made by each person for any work desired.

Distribution of Specimens.—In view of the immense mass of material
received at the National, Museum from the various government expedi-
tions and the geological survey, as well as from the contributions of cor.
respondents, it will be readily understood that the duplicates have ac-
cumulated very rapidly for many years and that the proper disposal of
this surplus has occupied the attention of the Smithsonian Institution.

Under the organic law the Institution is authorized to increase the
collections of the National Museum by the exchange of duplicate speci-

mens ; but only a small amount is conveniently disposed of in this man-
ner, and by far the greater proportion is issued without any expecta-
tion or desire forareturn. The table appended to this Report will show
what has been done up to date, as the distributions of the year 1880,

The distributions indicated have represented a fair average for the
year 1880. It is expected that in the year 188:, the amount will be
vastly increased by the disposal of the Centennial collections, which
have been so long stored in the Armory building, and which it is ex-
pected will soon be transferred to the new Museum building, just com-
pleted. These objects will be principally those relating to the mineral
kingdom, the ores and building stones being in the largest proportion.
Applications for collections from establishments not well known, are
usually referred to the member of Congress in the district in which the
applicant belongs, and an expression of opinion is invited as to the char-
acter and standing of the same.

Asa general rule, no specimens are sent away without being authori-
tatively and accurately labeled by an expert, so that they become stand-

ards of reference.
LIBRARY.

The additions to the library of the Institution through its system of
scientific exchanges, continue to be very large. During the past year,
the books, pamphlets, and charts received, have amounted to 8,570
pieces: a portion of which consists of parts or continuations of volumes,
such as the current proceedings and transactions of learned societies,
and the accessions to established scientific journals. Making due allow-
ance for such fragmentary continuations, the whole number of complete
volumes may be estimated at 6,000 titles; of which by far the greater
portion has been as usual transferred to the custody of the Library of
Congress, where they constitute an important section of the great
national collection.

In this statement is not included the large number of volumes received
under the arrangement for international government exchanges, and
-sent directly to the Library of Congress without being opened or cata-
legued at the Institution.

The Institution has received from Mr. John T. Fisk, president of the
American Industrial Deputation, at Puebla, Mexico, through his excel-
leney the Mexican minister, a very handsomely bound volume of small
size, of Prayers and Devotions, in the Spanish language. The binding
of this book is quite unique, the sides and back being covered with
highly polished plates of Mexican onyx, cemented upon a purple silk
cover, which is exposed only in the groove forming the flexible joint be-
tween the sides and the back. The front plate (four and a half inches
long, by two and seven-eighths inches wide, and probably about three-
sixteenths of an inch at its middle, gently rounding and thinning toward
its edges) is of a delicate mottled pink color, and is embellished with orna-
mental engraving filled in gilt. The corresponding plate forming the
opposite cover is, of course, of exactly the same size; but it is of a deli-
cate mottled green color: its ornamentation is similar to that of the front
side, though of a different design. The back of this curious volume is
entirely covered with a finely polished piece of delicately mottled blue
Mexican onyx, without ornament, nearly one inch in width, which has
been laboriously and skillfully hollowed out to conform to the rounded
back of the volume. On the front fly-leaf of the book the following in-
scription is written: “The Very Rev. Monsignor Eulagio G. Gillou, do-
mestie prelate of the Pope, to the American Industrial Deputation, on
its visit to this city, presents this small token of the mineral produce
and industry of the State: it contains, besides, specimens of Mexican
poetry; with the request that it be placed by its distinguished president,
Mr. John Theo. Fisk, in some public institution of the United States
for the inspection of its citizens and artisans. ”

The Institution has also received, through the honorable Secretary of
State (by official letter of the department dated December 3, 1880),
from the international exhibition commission of Sydney (N. 8. W.),
Australia (under cover of a letter dated November 8, 1880, from R. W.
Cameron, esq., one of the United States commissioners to said exhibi-
tion), a specimen bronze medal of award of the said Sydney international
exhibition of 1879. This medal, three inches in diameter and a quarter
of an inch thick at its outer rim, presents a very fine specimen of die-
sinking. On its obverse side, within a border bearing the legend of the
exhibition, is represented in bold relief a female figure, standing, sur-
rounded by emblems of the arts, supporting with her left hand a shield
bearing the arms of the province, and extending with her right hand
the victor’s laurel wreath, while in the rear is shown in low relief the
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

exhibition building. On its reverse side an elaborate floral wreath com-
prising native products forms the embellishment.

By the transfer to the Library of Congress of the greater portion of
the books belonging to the Smithsonian Institution, effected shortly
after the disastrous fire of 1865, the former library room was rendered
available for other uses. This occupation for other more pressing re-
quirements and purposes, necessarily prevented its further employment
as areading room. In view of the increasing number of employés con-
nected with either the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum,
or the United States Fish Commission and Fishery Census Division, it
was thought proper to make some provision by which some of the more
interesting domestic and foreign periodicals received might be ren-
dered easily accessible to them. Accordingly the corridor of the east
range of the building has been fitted up as a reading room by the erec-
tion of reading desks on which are placed the successive numbers of
certain serials as they come to hand. These, of course, comprise but a
very small portion of the journals received by the Institution; a full
list of which is given in the appendix.

RESEARCHES.

An arrangement was made by the Institution a number of years ago for
the compilation of a series of tables of ascertained altitudes in the United
States, to be collected from data derived from State and county surveys,
and from miscellaneous surveys made in the construction of railroads,
wagon roads, &c.; the ultimate object being the preparation of a topo-
graphic relief model of the country. This work was put in charge of
Mr. Walter L. Nicholson, and a considerable amount of work was ac-
complished towards the end in view. Mr. Nicholson having, however,
been appointed topographer of the Post-Office Department, the con-
stant occupation of his time in the duties of his position interfered
with the prosecution of this work, so that he was unable to complete his
report, and for some years nothing further has been accomplished. The
United States Coast and Geodetic Survey having had committed to it
by act of Congress the charge of conducting a system of triangulations
to connect the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, has requested the use of this
material collected by the Institution with reference to elevations ; but
its transfer to that establishment has not yet been determined on.

A subject which has of late years attracted considerable attention
from physiologists and others is the peculiar affection of vision known
as color-blindness.* This defect of chromatic sensibility exists in various
degrees, and to a much larger extent than is generally supposed ; and as
it does not appear to be usually accompanied with other optical imper-
fection of the eyes, many of its subjects are even unconscious of their
deficiency in this respect. Inasmuch as danger signals used at sea, upon

*This abnormal condition of sight is by many French writers characterized (not
very appropriately) as ‘‘ Daltonism.”
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21

coasts, on railroads, at draw- bridges, and elsewhere, are usually character-
ized by special colors, it obviously becomes a matter of the greatest mo-
ment to public safety that those immediately in charge of such signals,
or appointed to observe them, should be known to be entirely free from
any imperfection or disqualification in this direction. The subject has
accordingly with justice assumed a character of great practical impor-
tance. In the Smithsonian Report for 1877 the Institution published
the translation of a paper by Prof. I’. Holmgren, of Stockholm, in which
the vital consequence of this subject in many of the vocations of life,
and especially those connected with traveling and communication by
sea and by land, were strongly pointed out; and to this memoir is un-
doubtedly due in large degree the present appreciation of the subject.

An edition of this work had been contemplated by Prof. B. Jay Jeffries,
of Boston, who has himself conducted a very extended series of independ-
ent researches in the same direction.*

LABORATORY WORK.

A large part of the time of the chemist of the Institution is occupied
in determining the character of minerals sent to the Institution, with the
request for information. Under arule of the Institution, of which a copy
is herewith submitted, the examination of minerals for private parties
and private interests is confined to a simple qualitative examination, or, in
other words, an indication of the more important elements contained
therein. It is a comparatively easy matter to ascertain whether a cer-
tain specimen contains gold, silver, lead, or other metal, and examina-
tions of this kind are made daily. In all cases, however, where an act-
ual chemical analysis or assay is required, it is only done at the request
or in behalf of some branch of the government, or for some other public
purpose ; in all other cases the applicant is referred to professional chem-
ists for the investigation. It will, of course, be readily understood that
if the Institution once establishes the precedent of making such assays
and analyses, it would soon require the services of dozens of chemists,
thus involving expense for which no adequate provision could be made,
and interfering with the business of those who depend upon such work
for a subsistence.

In the report of the chemist, which is submitted in the Appendix, will
be found a statement of the general character of the chemical work con-
ducted during the year, among which have been quite a number of in-

vestigations made for the government. Perhaps the most important of
these was the inquiry into the so-called Tichenor process of reducing
ores of gold by the use of one of the chlorides of gold. This investiga-
tion was made at the special request of the Commissioner of Patents,
and conducted at the expense of the Patent Office, and an elaborate re-
port transmitted to that officer. Very much public interest centered
around the analysis, as the disposition of a large amount of money in
the way of investment depended upon the decision.

In addition to the chemical work actually performed in behalf of the
government, the Institution is not unfrequently asked (especially by the
Treasury Department) to nominate chemical experts for special inquiries,
a request always promptly complied with.

In view of the large amount and variety of analytical investigations
continually required by the government for the faithful and intelli-
gent administration of several of its bureaus or departments, it is much
to be desired that a first-class laboratory, under efficient direction,
be established in official connection with some branch of the gov-
ernment, where all chemical work of a public character or value can
be thoroughly executed. Questions of grave importance, and subjects
requiring elaborate and conscientious research, are constantly being
presented in the revenue and other branches of the public service, which
demand precise and authoritative determination for the satisfactory
guidance of official agents, and which should be placed under the imme-
diate supervision of those (of whatever government bureau) charged
with the responsibility and interested in the accurate execution of the

work.
EXPLORATIONS.

e

In the summer of 1879, Mr. F. H. Cushing, the assistant in charge of
the ethnological department of the museum, was granted leave of
absence by the Institution for the purpose of accompanying a commis-
sion detailed to carry on ethnological research and exploration among
the Pueblo people of New Mexico. This expedition, in charge of Mr.
James Stevenson, was very successful in its mission; collecting large
numbers of specimens, an account of which was duly given in the Report
of 1879. Mr. Cushing found the field of inquiry among the Indians so
rich and extensive that he obtained permission to remain a longer time,
and is still there. He has established himself with the Zuni Pueblo,
under the special protection of the chiefs, and has gained the confidence
of the people to such a degree as to be permitted to attend all their
ceremonial observances, and make notes and even drawings. An inves-
tigation into the traditions and history of the people, their manners and
customs, their songs and dances, and their relationship to other tribes,
has kept Mr. Cushing constantly occupied. A rich harvest of inter-
esting discovery will undoubtedly result from his residence among these
people.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 2a

Mr. Cushing has also been enabled to obtain many interesting speci-
mens of the handiwork of the Indians, both ancient and modern, and
has visited some of the mines from which minerals valued by them as
precious stones were obtained. In addition to the general inquiry into
the history of the Indians, Mr. Cushing has been instructed to take the
census of the Zuni village, at the request of Major Powell.

Dr. F. M. Endlich, the mineralogist of the Institution, received, in
January last, leave of absence, for the purpose of visiting, as an agent
of the Treasury Department, certain sugar-producing islands of the
West Indies and Demerara, with a view of investigating the mode of
preparation of sugars, intended especially for exportation to the United .
States. During his stay in the West Indies, as also in South America,
he made some interesting collections for the National Museum, among
them specimens of curious aboriginal pottery.

Dr. Endlich returned to Washington, after an absence of several
months, but was occupied for some months in completing his report;
receiving then an appointment in charge of certain mining operations
in Arizona, he resigned his position in the National Museum. The work
of the department of which Dr. Endlich had charge was then placed in
the hands of Dr. I’. W. Taylor of Washington, as will be seen by his
report, given elsewhere.

The services to natural science, of Capt. Charles Bendire, of the First
Cavalry, have been appreciated for many years past by scientific men,
this officer, whose military record is understood to be entirely satisfae-
tory, devoting his leisure time to collecting specimens in all branches
of natural history and making very full notes in regard to the man-
ners, habits, and peculiarities of various Indian tribes. His succes-
sive assignments to military duty have taken him into the most
inaccessible and least-known portions of the American Continent, in-
cluding portions of Arizona, California, Oregon, &c., which have been
thoroughly explored by him. Several questions having arisen during
the year in reference to the character of certain species of salmonidie
in Oregon and Washington Territory, the acquisition of specimens of
which was considered very desirable in the interest of fish culture and
the fisheries, Captain Bendire expressed his willingness to undertake
a journey to the localities involved, provided the necessary authority
and orders could be obtained from the War Department. Application
to General Sherman and to the Secretary of War resulted in the comple-
tion of the necessary arrangements, by which Captain Bendire was
instructed to prosecute some desired reconnoissances and inquiries, in
which he would have the necessary opportunities for natural history
research. Under this arrangement he left Fort Walla Walla with a
portion of his command, and after an interval of several months spent
in the field, returned with rich results, consisting of very complete col-
lections of the fishes of the rivers and lakes of the interior of the
country, and with other objects of natural history, which have been re-
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ceived at the Institution and will shortly be made the subject of special
investigation on the part of its specialists.

Mr. F. A. Ober, whose important researches into the natural history
and ethnology of numerous islands in the West Indies have been referred
to in previous reports, made an expedition to that group of islands
during the past summer, in connection with certain business enterprises.
As before, he devoted such of his time as he could spare to scientific
inquiry, and secured an excellent series of birds from several of the
islands not previously visited. These have been duly received and
entered in the catalogue of the Museum, making its series of West
Indian birds by far the most complete of any in existence. It is pro-
posed at no distant time to prepare a catalogue of the West Indian birds
in the National Museum, with appropriate notes.

Mr. Ober also secured important collections ofreptiles, fishes, mammals,
and objects of archeology for the National Museum.

In December, 1879, Prof. David S. Jordan, of the Indiana University,
as assistant to the United States Fish Commission and special agent
of the Census Department, was sent to the Pacific coast to investigate
the fishes and fisheries of that region. Prof. Charles H. Gilbert, of the
same institution, accompanied him as assistant. These gentlemen re-
paired at once to San Diego, Cal., where they began work January
1, 1880. Statistics were obtained at each of the fishing towns, and
large collections of fishes were made in turn at San Diego, San Pedro,
Santa Barbara, Monterey, Soquel, and San Francisco. The collection
obtained in Monterey Bay was especially extensive, comprising nearly
one hundred and fifty species. A stay of several weeks was made
in San Francisco, after which, about May 1, Professors Jordan and
Gilbert left for Astoria, Oreg.; here studies were made of the “spring
runs” of salmon, which, supplemented by Professor Gilbert’s subse-
quent studies of the “fall runs” in the various rivers, have thrown much
light on this intricate subject. Later a visit was made to Puget Sound,
and considerable collections were obtained at Seattle, Neah Bay, Vie-
toria, and New Westminster. On June 15, the party returned to Asto-
ria and soon after to San Francisco. The chief ports south of San Fran-
cisco were again visited and large collections made.

About September 1, Professor Jordan returned eastward, stopping at
Lake Tahoe, Utah Lake, and Burlington, lowa, for the purpose of study-
ing the fisheries of these regions. Professor Gilbert returned to the Co-
lumbia and Puget Sound to investigate the fall runs of salmon. In Novem-
ber he left San Francisco for Mazatlan, Panama, and Aspinwall, at each
of which places considerable time was spent and large collections made.

he chief results of the expedition may be here briefly summarized.

1. The collection of statistics of the various fisheries along the coast.

2. The discovery of about 50 species new to science on our Pacific
coast, and of nearly as many more on the coasts of Mexico and Central
America.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

3. The collection in large numbers of nearly every species known on
our Pacific coast, about 265 in all. About 10,000 duplicates from this
collection have been already distributed to the principal museums of
the world.

6. The solution of many of the problems relative to the life-history of
the salmon.

In April, 1880, Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, one of the assistants in the Mu-
seum, was detailed to visit Alaska to collect fishery statistics, fishes,
birds, and such other objects of interest as could be obtained Through
the courtesy of Capt. Carlile P. Patterson, Superintendent of the United
States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and at the suggestion of Mr. W. H.
Dall, who was in command of the vessel, Dr. Bean was permitted to ac-
company the party of the schooner Yukon, and was allowed all possible
assistance and facilities for making collections. While Mr. Dall devoted
his leisure more particularly to the dredging for invertebrates and bar-
tering for native implements and ornaments, he also contributed largely
to the collection of fish and other marine vertebrates. Valuable aid was
extended also by Capt. E. P. Herendeen, Mr. Marcus Baker, Mr. Wm.
E. Noyes, Mr. H. W. McDonald, and Mr. Sylvanus Bailey.

Dr. Bean was absent from April to the middle of November, and dur-
ing that time visited Sitka, Port Althorp, Port Mulgrave, Cook’s Inlet,
Kodiak, the Shumagin Islands, Belkoffsky, Unalashka, Saint Paul Isl-
and, Plover Bay (Siberia), Cape Lisburne, Icy Cape, Point Belcher,
Eschscholtz Bay, Port Clarence, Big Diomede Island, and Saint Mathew
Island. One hundred days were spent at sea, and seventy-eight days
in the various ports named. When it is remembered that rain pre-
vented work to some extent while in port, it will be seen that the sea-
son of actual collecting was short; yet the party succeeded in obtaining
47 packages, including 32 boxes, 10 kegs, and 3 tank-boxes of natural
history specimens.

Upwards of 80 species of fish and 50 of birds were secared—some
rare fishes being taken in considerable numbers with a view to their
distribution to other museums. Of the fish Dr. Bean has already de-
scribed 14 species as new to science—one of them representing a new
genus. The chief value of the fish collection, however, lies in the fact of
its including many hitherto doubtful or unknown Pallasian and Tilesian
species. A full series of specimens was secured, which establishes the
identity of the commercial cod and halibut of the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans. Not fewer than 14 species of fishes were collected that are
common to both sides of Northern America. With the addition of this
summer’s results, the Museum is in possession of nearly all the known
Alaskan fishes. Hurynorhynchus pygmeus was obtained in Plover Bay,
and information of its occurrence at Point Barrow. Larus marinus was,
for the first time, taken in Alaska. A very large series of the great
Unalashkan song sparrow (Melospiza insignis Baird) was brought down
and formed the basis of demonstrating a perfect intergradation with
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the M. melodia. Actodromas acuminata was again captured at Port
Clarence, farther north than ever before in Alaska.

A single reptile—a toad caught by Miss Sallie Ball near Sitka—forms
a part of the collection.

Mr. Dall was fortunate in procuring a perfect skin and skeleton of the
banded seal (Histriophoca equestris) in spite of the determination of its
Eskimo captors to carry off at least a piece of the nose! A very large
number of skulls of Eskimo dog was gathered at Plover Bay. A few
good bones of fossil mammals were brought from Esehschoitz Bay.

On the island of Unalashka many skulls and implements of prehistoric
Aleuts were found in cliff burial-places. At Uiuliuk, Mr. Dall obtained a
great prize in the skull of a prehistoric Aleut dog from a village-site
near Ulakhta Head. Throughout the Territory large coilections of
implements of bone, ivory, stone, wood, copper, &c.. were made, some
of the Eskimo north of the Arctic Circle furnishing many really valu-
able articles of ivory and stone.

Dr. Bean is now preparing a detailed report upon the fishes; and this,
in connection with some notes on the birds, and lists of the coleoptera,
lichens, &c., will form material for a Bulletin of the Museum.

Mr. H. H. Rusby, a well-known botanist of New Jersey, has been en-
gaged for some time in investigating the botany, natural history, and
archeology of New Mexico, and it gave the Institution much pleasure
to be able to obtain for him certain facilities from the War Department,
to aid him in his researches. His special attention has been given to
botany, and he has already addressed to the Institution a number of
interesting collections in this department. In archzxology his princi-
pal work has: been the investigation of a cave, near Silver City, New
Mexico, filled with aboriginal relics, many of which he has succeeded in
securing. None of these collections have, so far, come to hand; but
they will probably be received in the early part of 1881. Mr. Rusby,
with the true zeal of the explorer, finding his means inadequate to the
carrying out of his plans, entered into certain business relations with
parties in New Mexico, by means of which he earned enough to con-
tinue his labors.

An exploring trip to the remarkable natural cave at Luray, in Virginia,
was made by a party from the Institution in the month of July last. An
account of this visit is given in the General Appendix to this Report.

Ever since the return of the schooner Florence from her expedition to
Arctic America, Captain Howgate, of the Signal Office, has been en-
deavoring to secure the interest of Congress in a second expedition;
and to that end he purchased in Scotland the steamer Gulnare, and had
it brought to Washington and placed in a condition of thorough repair.
Additional timbers were placed in the vessel and it was overhauled and
placed in an effective condition.

In connection with the same enterprise Congress passed a law author-
izing her acceptance, by the Navy Department, and her equipment for
the purpose, should she be considered seaworthy. The Secretary of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. nF

War was also authorized to make a detail of officers and men from the
Army, to accompany the expedition. The plan of operations was to
send the vessel to Lady Franklin Bay, with a shore party, which was
then to be landed and to be provided with houses on shore, the vessel
herself returning to the United States for additional supplies. The War
Department did its part, by detailing Lieutenant Doane and a number of
men for the purpose in question, the general supervision being placed
in charge of the Signal Office. A critical inspection of the vessel was
made by the several bureaus of the Navy Department, and after a careful
consideration she was declared to be not sufficiently reliable to be ac-
cepted and the Secretary of the Navy declined to take the responsibility
of forwarding her on the voyage. In this emergency Captain Howgate
himself provisioned the vessel and furnished the necessary commander
and crew, and she started on her journey via Newfoundland. Severe
storms, however, were encountered and her boilers became so injured
as to require repair in Newfoundland. She experienced numerous mis-
haps, some of which greatly injured the vessel itself and rendered the
further prosecution of the enterprise inexpedient. The vessel accord-
ingly returned to Washington with the party, and the expedition was
practically abandoned for the present. Dr. Pavy, the surgeon and
naturalist of the expedition, and one other, however, remained in Green-
land to carry on independent researches.

Captain Howgate, with his usual appreciation of all branches of science,
invited the Institution to furnish a collector to the expedition, promising
to supply the necessary quarters and subsistence. It was, however,
found impossible, in the brief notice given, to secure the services of a
competent person, and nothing was done beyond supplying some ap-
paratus for deep-sea research.

PUBLICATIONS.

The activity of the Institution is more marked and its influence more
extended through its publications than by any other of its agencies for
the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men. However useful
and important its researches, explorations and collections, these would
be very limited in advantage to the public were it not for the dissemina-
tion of the new truths discovered and the facts collected through the
various classes of publications carried on by the establishment. These
publications are growing in number, size, frequency of issue, and value
every year, and more has been done in this way in 1850 than during
any previous period.

For many years past the Smithsonian Institution has been in the
habit of having all its memoirs (both octavo and quarto) stereotyped,
as thereby the number of copies of any memoir required for the use of
the public could be conveniently regulated. The demand by the public
(beyond the regular supply of everything to a definite number of insti-
tutions) being very unequal, there was danger of printing either too
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

many or too few. This induced my predecessor, many years ago, to
order that everything published by the Institution should either be elec-
trotyped or stereotyped, and the first edition for miscellaneous distri-
bution of 250 copies was generally printed. If more than this was
required a second and a third edition of similar extent were ordered.
In this way the expense of an investment in paper and printing, as
well as an inconvenient and possibly dangerous accumulation of mate-
rials in the building, was avoided; and it has now become possible to
keep down the stock to the minimum. The stereotype and electrotype
plates have usually been kept in the bascment of the building; but for
the greater convenience of reference and transfer to the printer when
required, they have been arranged during the year in a large fire-proof
room in the upper stories of the south tower.

By far the largest proportion of electrotype plates have been stored
in Philadelphia in a portion of the building of the Academy of Natural
Sciences of that city, and under the charge of the printers of the Insti-
tution, the T. K. Collins establishment. The Institution is under great
obligations to the Academy for permission to occupy so much of its
basement and for allowing, at the same time, free access to it by the
agents of the Institution.

Index to Smithsonian Publications.—In the constantly-increasing mass
of serial publications the general titles of which express but indefinitely
the character of their contents, the preparation of special indexes has
become a matter of great importance; and within the last twenty years
quite a number of such publications have been made; one of these, of
the most importance, namely, the Index of Periodical Literature, by Mr.
Henry Poole, has been of very great assistance to students and investi-
gators, and a still more elaborate system of indexing has lately been
carried out. An association of persons familiar with this kind of work
has been formed for the purpose of continuing this series of indexes.
Two propositions have been made to the Institution to prepare a full
digest of all the papers it has published.

Such a bibliography has, however, been in preparation by the Institu-
tion for some time past. Mr. Boehmer, one of the assistants, has prepared
a full alphabetical index to the subjects of ethnology and archeology,
contained in the Contributions to Knowledge, the Miscellaneous Collec-
tions, and the Smithsonian Reports; an abstract of which, published in
the Report for 1879, will give some idea of its plan. The complete work
will be printed as soon as funds are available for the purpose, and it
will meet an acknowledged want. Similar indexes will, in time, be
furnished, relating to other branches of science.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.—During the year, Volume
XXII of the quarto series of “Contributions” has been made up and
published, consisting of independent memoirs previously issued by the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

Institution. This volume comprises 544 pages of text, illustrated by 20
plates and 474 wood-cuts; and embraces the following subjects :

Introduction, 16 pp.—1st. Explorations of the Aboriginal Remains
of Tennessee. By Joseph Jones, M.D. Published October, 1876. 4to.,

in the Catherina Archipelago, Alaska Territory, and especially from
the Caves of the Aleutian Islands. By W. H. Dall. Published Janu-
ary, 1576. 4to.,44 pp. 10 plates.

Palenque Tablet.—F rom the interest expressed by Mexican archzolo-
gists in the history of the Palenque Tablet, and in Dr. Raw’s memoir on
that subject, it was presumed that this paper would be translated and
published by the National Museum of Mexico, under the charge of its
eminent director, Senor Don Gumesindo Mendoza, and accordingly as
an act of international courtesy it was determined to offer to him
electrotype copies of the plates, as also a supply of phototype prints
from the tablet itself. This proposal was at once thankfully accepted
by Senor Mendoza, and the preparation of the translation of the text
promptly undertaken. Copies of the memoir in the Spanish version,
giving the text and all the notes in full, have lately been received by
the Institution.

Physiological Research A memoir has been published during the
past year on the subject of “Fever,” considered physiologically as well
as pathologically. The researches set forth in this work were under-
taken by Dr. H. C. Wood, jr., of Philadelphia, under the auspices of the
Institution; and a notice of the character of the investigation, pre-
pared by the author, was presented in the Report for 1878. The print-
ing of the memoir was considerably delayed by the necessity of a criti-
cal revision of the tables and calculations, which was intrusted to Mr.
C. B. Young, of this Institution, and which has received from him eareful
and laborious attention. He also corrected all the proof-sheets. This
memoir, forming No. 357 of the Smithsonian publications, comprises 266
quarto pages, illustrated by 5 plates and 16 wood-cuts. The general
conclusion arrived at, as summarized in the memoir, is that the cause
of fever ‘is simply a state in which a depressing poison or a depress-
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ing peripheral irritation acts upon the nervous system which regulates
the production and dissipation of animal heat”; and that the nature
of fever is “a nutritive disturbance in which there is an elevation of
the bodily temperature and also an increase of the production of heat
by an increase of the chemical movements in the accumulated material
of the body; this increase being sometimes sufficient, sometimes in-
sufficient, to compensate for the loss of that heat which is derived di-
rectly from the destruction of the surplus food in the body; very little
or no food being taken in severe fever.”

It is the custom of the Institution to give to the author a certain
number of copies of his memoirs, this varying with the extent and cost
of production. The author is also invited to furnish a list of specialists
particularly interested in the research covered by the memoir, whether
resident at home or abroad, and to these, or as many as can conveniently
be supplied, copies are sent free of cost, and the fact of this being done
by the request of the author is stated.

The author is also allowed to print as many additional copies as he
thinks proper, at his own expense, and to dispose of them as he pleases,
either by giving them away or selling them. The more extended the
distribution of a memoir, the better is the principle of the Institution
carried out, viz, that of the increase and diffusion of knowledge.

Dr. Wood has availed himself of this opportunity by having 250 extra
copies printed and placed on the market with the imprint of J. B. Lip-
pincott, & Co., of Philadelphia.

Meteorology—The relationship of the Smithsonian Institution to
the subject of American meteorology is well known, especially the
fact that until the establishment of the Weather Bureau of the War
Department the Institution had the entire burden of maintaining a series
of observing stations throughout the country and of publishing the re-
sults in a series of memoirs, which are accepted as of standard value by
all meteorologists. When in 1871 its system of active work was trans-
ferred to the Signal Office of the War Department the publication of
digested results was not intermitted, but continued, so as to cover the
entire period of activity up to the year in question.

Among the meteorological monographs published by the Institution,
that on the rainfall of the United.States prepared under the direction of
Mr. Charles A. Schott, of the United States Coast Survey, was one of the
most important. This work, with its digested tables of rainfall and the
series of rainfall maps, extending from the earliest records to the year
1866, was used for a number of years in determining the questions of
general climatology and the relations of plants to altitude and locality,
and to the extent and degree of reservoirs for storing water, &c.

In the interval between the completion of the first work to the trams-
fer of the system many additional observations had been made, involv-
ing the rectification of some of the general conclusions, and it was
determined to publish a continuation of the work, down to 1878, em-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ol

bodying at the same time a recast of the generalizations. The work
was accordingly placed under the supervision of Mr. Schott, as-
sisted by Mr. E. H. Courtenay, of the Coast Survey, and completed
during the year. Arrangements were immediately made for publica-
tion, including the construction of new base charts. The printing of the
charts has been completed by Mr. Julius Bien and the text is in an ad-
vanced stage of preparation, and will probably be ready in a few months.

Among the important papers still on hand which have been accepted
and are awaiting publication are the continuation of Professor Caswell’s
meteorological observations, of Providence, and the observations made
by Mr. Sherman, while on board the schooner Florence as a member of
Captain Howgate’s polar expedition.

The observations of Mr. Sherman present many new points in the
climatology and physical condition of the arctic regions, and will be a
valuable addition to the other papers of a similar character published
by the Institution, as illustrating the works of Hayes, Kane, McClintock,
and others. The delay in the publication of these works is due to the
large amount of material on hand. It is hoped, however, that in the
course of a year they may be sent to press.

Archcology.— Reference has been made in previous reports to an ex-
tremely interesting collection of West Indian antiquities, probably of
Carib manufacture, presented by the late Mr. George Latimer to the
National Museum. This collection embraced many new forms of much
interest. The stone implements of this collection possessed many peculi-
arities, for the most part not illustrated at all by those of the continent of
North America; and amemoir by Prof. O. T. Mason, published in the An-
nual Report in 1876, illustrated by suitable wood-cuts, has attracted great
attention at home and abroad. Its dissemination has brought to light
additional collections in the West India Islands, and arrangements have
been made to obtain the use of some of these for publication.

Mr. Frederick A. Ober brought from Antigua a number of inter-
esting objects, quite different from those of Mr. Latimer; and Mr.
Guesde, of Guadaloupe, has communicated to the Institution a large num-
ber of beautifully-executed drawings of full-sized specimens in his collec-
tion, accompanied by detailed descriptions. Professor Mason has un-
dertaken to compile a special memoir on Mr. Guesde’s collection, to be
illustrated by his drawings and published at an early date.

The publication by the Smithsonian Institution, many years ago, of a
memoir by Mr. Lewis H. Morgan, upon the terms of relationship and con-
sanguinity employed by various nations of the world, led to the establish-
ment of almost a new branch of philological and ethnological investiga-
tion; orat least placed it upon a substantial footing. At the time of the
publication of the memoir there were few persons prepared to follow the
reasoning of the author ; but under its stimulus corresponding researches
have been carried on in various parts of the world and have produced
very good fruit.
32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Among such investigations was one by Mr. L. Fison, in regard to the
aborigines of Australia, and an agreement was entered into with him
by which the Institution was to publish it, uniform with Mr. Morgan’s
memoir. The number of manuscripts in hand waiting for publication
prevented Mr. Fison’s article from going to press, and he finally was
able to make arrangements at home for its appearance. The paper was
accordingly withdrawn and transmitted to the author through Mr. Mor-
gan.

There is now a sufficient number of the quarto memoirs completed to
form another volume of the “ Contributions,” Volume XXIII; and this
will be issued early in the year 1881. It will probably comprise :

Ist. Lucernaric and theirallies. By Henry James Clark. (130 pages,

Memoir of James Smithson.—lt has long been the intention of the In-
stitution to publish a memoir of its founder, and. from time to time ef-
forts have been made to collect materials for this purpose. It is much
to be regretted, however, that this work was not undertaken at an earlier
date, while some of Smithson’s contemporaries were living who could
have imparted valuable information as to his peculiarities and charac-
teristics.

Mr. Rhees, Chief -Clerk of the Institution, has at last supplied the
want so long felt in the history of this establishment, and has made use
of every known source of information in the preparation of the work in
question. By extensive correspondence and advertisements in several
of the leading English periodicals some facts of interest not hitherto
known were secured, and the author was thus enabled to present a
more extended notice of Smithson than was at first anticipated.

The memoir under notice commences with a sketch of the ancestry of
the Smithson family, gives an account of the education of James Smith-
son at the Oxford University, where he graduated in 1786, describes his
devotion to scientific pursuits, his love of adventure in the search for
knowledge, recounts his achievements as a chemist and mineralogist,
enumerates his published scientific works, and gives the testimonials to
his worth and ability from the president of the Royal Society and
others.

An inventory of his personal effects is presented, and an account of
the likenesses of Mr. Smithson known to be in existence and in the pos-
session of the Institution.

Some attention is paid to a consideration of the motives which probably
actuated Smithson in bequeathing his fortune tv the United States, and
a resumé is given of the intellectual condition of the period in which he
lived, which is shown to have exhibited a remarkable spirit of scientific
activity, and the formation at that time of some of the most important
organizations for the advancement of science, education, and philan-
thropy.

S. Mis. 31——3
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The promotion of knowledge was peculiarly a characteristic of the
period, and Smithson was undoubtedly impressed with this idea.

Full details of the will and a fae simile of it are given.

Mr, Rhees then traces the steps taken by the United States Govern-
ment to secure the bequest, the various acts of Congress, the debates,
resolutions, messages of Presidents, &c., in relation to the subject, and
finally the reception, on the 29th of August, 1838, of £104,960 8s. 6d,
which, converted into American gold, realized $508,318.46 as the Smith-
son foundation.

A recapitulation is next furnished of the legislation of Congress in
relation to the disposition of the Smithson fund, and a brief abstract of
the notable speeches made from time to time in which various plans
for establishing the Smithsonian Institution were advocated. These
speeches are given in full in the “ Documents relative to the history of
the Smithsonian Institution,” published in 1879; but in the present vol-
ume the narrative is continuous and the references to the names and locali-
ties of the Senators and members of Congress more minute and explicit.
In an appendix additional facts are given relative to the father of
Smithson, the first Duke of Northumberland; the half brother of Smith-
son, Marl Perey, who commanded the British re-enforcements at the battle
of Lexington, 1775; notices of some of Smithson’s papers; extracts from
his writings: a catalogue of nis library now deposited in the Smithso-
nian Institution; and notices of the city of Washington found in Smith-
son’s books.

The whole forms an octavo of 76 pages, with the following illustra-
tions :

Portrait of Smithson. Heliotype; from an oil miniature by Johns.
1816.

Portrait of Smithson. Heliotype; from an oil painting. Cabinet
size; full-length figure, sitting, in the costume of an Oxford student.
1786.

Portrait of Smithson. Profile; engraved on steel; from a medallion.

Temb of Smithson, at Genoa, Italy. Wood-engraving; froma recent
photograph.

Fac simile of Smithson’s visiting card, and of his dinner invitation
eard.

Silhouette portrait of Henry James Hungerford, nephew of Smithson.

Fac simile of Smithson’s will. Two sheets, of four quarto pages.

Portrait of Smithson’s father, Sir Hugh Smithson. From an engrav-
ing belonging to James Smithson.

North view of the Smithsonian Institution building at Washington.

The Memorial Volume in honor of the late Professor Henry, author-
ized to be published by Congress, though somewhat delayed, has been
completed, and is now practically ready for distribution. It forms a
handsome octavo book of 528 pages, of which the main subject-matter
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

is divided into three parts. <A brief introduction of 4 pages presents
the proceedings of Congress in relation to the holding of memorial serv-
ices in the hall of the House of Representatives, and also in relation to
the printing of the same, together with such other testimonials of respect
as the Regents might deem congruous with the object of the work. Part
first embraces the primary proceedings more immediately connected
with the obsequies, commencing appropriately with the reproduction
of the announcement of the death of Joseph Henry, by the Chancellor,
Chief Justice Waite, issued on the day following that melancholy event,
and addressed as a formal or official obituary notice to all the cor-
respondents of the Institution, in our own country or abroad, followed
by an account of the proceedings of the Board of Regents on the occa-
sion of the funeral services, with the sermon of the Rev. Samuel S.
Mitchell, and of the steps taken by the Regents on the day following to
obtain a public commemoration. Part second comprises an account of
the memorial services at the Capitol, presided over by the Vice-Presi-
dent, taken from the Congressional Record, and consisting of an open-
ing prayer by President McCosh of Princeton, addresses by Senators
Hamlin and Withers, Representatives Garfield and Cox, Professors
Gray of Cambridge and Rogers of Boston, and by General Sherman,
the reading of telegrams by Representative Clymer, and a closing prayer
by the Chaplain of the Senate, Rev. Dr. Sunderland. Part third com-
prises proceedings by, and addresses before, various bodies with which
Professor Henry had been prominently connected. The volume con-
cludes with an appendix of 4 pages, recounting the proceedings of
Congress with reference to the erection on the Smithsonian grounds of
a statue of Joseph Henry. The whole is followed by a general index of
12 pages.

Digest of Atomic Weights—Among the Miscellaneous Collections a
earefully-prepared digest of “Atomic Weights,” by George FI. Becker,
of California, has been published during the past year, constituting No.
398 of the Smithsonian series. This work, comprising 150 octavo pages,
consists of a collection of all the determinations of the atomic weights
of the chemical elements heretofore made. The elements are alphabet-
ically arranged, with critical notices under each, and the authorities for
varying determinations, together with precise citations to the publica-
tions or records, are fully given. The whole is accompanied with a full
index of the journals and other publications, both foreign and domestic,
which have been laid under contribution ; and a second index gives an
alphabetical list of the authors of atomic weight determinatioas. The
work evinces a pains-taking diligence in collecting from every available
source (in whatever language) the information desired ; and it will prove
a valuable work of reference to both the theoretical and the practical
chemist.

This publication is in continuation of a line of scientific manuals on
the “Constants of Nature,” projected by the Institution, and may be

regarded as forming Volume IV of the series thus far attempted:
Volume I being tables of the Specific Gravities of bodies, and also of
their Boiling and Melting Points ; Volume I, tables of the Specific Heats
of bodies; and Volume III, tables of Heat Expansion of bodies. All
three volumes were compiled by Prof. F. W. Clarke of the University of
Cincinnati.

The Toner Lectures.—On the 15th of April, 1872, a deed of conveyance
of several pieces of property in Washington, with money and other
securities amounting in value to $3,000, was made by Dr. Joseph M.
Toner, of this city, to five trustees, instituting the Toner lectures, and
establishing a permanent and increasing fund for their support and con-
tinuance annually.

The trustees named in the deed were the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution (then Prof. Joseph Henry), the Surgeon-General of the United
States Army (then J. K. Barnes, M. D.), the Surgeon-General of the
United States Navy (then J. M. Foltz, M. D.), the president of the Med-
ical Society of the District of Columbia (then Grafton Tyler, M. D.).

The interest of this fund was set apart to be applied for annual
memoirs or essays relative to some branch of medical science, each to
contain some new truth fully established by experiment or observation ;
no such memoir or leeture to be given to the world under the name of
the “Toner Lectures” without having first been critically examined and
approved by competent persons selected by the trustees.

In accordance with this trust; arrangements were made for the deliv-
ery of annual lectures on subjects relative to medical science, and the
Smithsonian Institution undertook their publication in its series of Mis-
cellaneous Collections. The following is a list of the lectures published
up to 1880, and already described in previous reports: I. On the
Structure of Cancerous Tumors and the Mode in which adjacent parts
are invaded. By Dr. J. J. Woodward. Published November, 1873, 44

lections, and discusses a subject of special and practical importance to
the residents of this city.

The heaith and comfort of the Capital of the nation is a matter of so
zeneral interest that its hygienic conditions deserve careful study and
consideration. Very difficult problems are presented to the sanitary
engineer by the topography of the city and the river frontage on a large
area of flat land. The drainage of so large and so populous a city is
one of the first subjects requiring the attention of the local authorities
and of Congressional action. Mr. Waring having had long experience
and much distinction in investigation of such topics, was, therefore, in-
vited by the trustees of the Toner fund to make a thorough examination
of the city and District, and requested to make suggestions for the im-
provement of their drainage.

Mr. Waring in his lecture presents Holland as furnishing a suitable
example for imitation in regard to the reclamation of low areas. In
that country about 4,000 acres have been reclaimed annually, while in
Washington the improvement of not more than 2,500 is required. He rec-
ommends strongly the adoption of the Dutch method of constructing de-
fenses, embankments, and bulk-heads, leaving the inclosed ground at its
present level, and to drain it by artificial power to a sufficient depth to se-
cure the same result as to dryness that would be secured by the filling it
with earth. This would substitute a dry and pleasant meadow for the
present noisome mud flats, would be economical, simple, and practically
equivalent to raising the whole city six or eight feet above its present
level, and give it high and dry ground to the shore of a clear running
stream on each side.

Next to bringing the flats about the city into a proper condition, the
drying of the soil of those parts now subject to saturation is considered
by the author, and for the latter purpose he recommends that the damp
lands should be drained by an independent system of pipes, entirely
disconnected, except at their outlets, with the sewer system. ;

The sewerage of the city is next considered, and the use of the same
drains for the streets and for houses is condemned as very objection-
able. It is urged as of prime necessity that every foot of the sewers
with which habitations are connected should be at all times free from
deposits of organic matter.

The best size of sewer-pipes is fully discussed, and the conclusion
stated that large ones should be restricted to the removal of storm-water
only, and small ones used for house drainage.

A radical and almost universal improvement of the interior drainage
of houses is demanded, the defective house-drains being a far more im-
portant factor in the production of disease than defective sewers. By
the official statement, the deaths in the District in 1879 from diseases
which are believed to be very materially affected by bad drainage, either
by soil-moisture or by filth, amounted to just about one-half of the total
mortality. The author believes that five hundred persons annually die
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

within the District of Columbia because of the defective condition of
the houses in which they live.

The main features of a comprehensive scheme adequate to the im-
provement required are stated by Mr. Waring to be—

1. The flats and marshes to be reclaimed by embanking and pumping.

2. The discharge of the lateral streams and of storm-water sewers to
be carried beyond these defenses and delivered into the main channels
of the river.

3. The complete underdraining or subsoil drainage of the site of the
city.

4. The separate removal of the foul drainage.

5. The abolition of privy vaults and cesspools and the complete
reformation of the interior drainage of houses.

Physical Tables—Among the earliest publications of the Institution,
one now exhausted, but which has ever since been in great demand both
at home and abroad, is the very full series of meteorological and phys-
ical tables prepared by Prof. Arnold Guyot. This work (No. 31 on our
list), published in 1852, constitutes the principal portion of the first
volume of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, and is universally
recognized as a standard work of reference on the subjects to which it
is devoted.

The expansion of certain branches of physical inquiry has made some
supplementary tables desirable, and Professor Guyot was invited by
my predecessor to prepare the material for a new series. The greater
part of the work will of course be unchanged, and will be printed from
the original electrotype plates. But some modification of certain tables,
together with a number of new ones, has been arranged for.

Professor Guyot’s laborious duties at Princeton have interfered with
the speedy completion of the new edition; but the material is now
nearly ready, and the additional pages will be put in type at an early
day.

Bulletins of the National Museum.—In addition to the regular series
of publications printed entirely at the expense of the Smithsonian fund,
several series prepared under the direction of the Institution have the
expense of the printing of a small edition provided for from other sources.
Stereotype plates of these issues are ‘preserved, and are afterward in-
eluded in the Miscellaneous Collections. These consist especially of the
Bulletins and Proceedings of the National Museum, the printing of which
is authorized by the Department of the Interior, and paid for out of its
fund. Anedition of one thousand copies is published, of which one-halfis
distributed by the Department of the Interior and one-half by the Insti-
tution. As the pages are stereotyped, the cost of additional copies is
slight; and for the purpose of making sure that a sufficient number of
sets will be accessible forever to students in all parts of the world, it has
been considered expedient to print fifteen hundred additional copies of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

each asa portion of the Miscellaneous Collections. In this way the dis-
tribution of the first edition can be made to special students and the
minor societies that do not receive full series of Smithsonian publications.

In this manner the various numbers of the Proceedings of the Na-
tional Museum (forming the volumes for 1878 and 1879) have been asso-
ciated together to form the nineteenth volume of the Miscellaneous Col-
jections as already indicated. A similar arrangement has been made
in reference to the transactions of the Philosophical Society of Wash-
ington, the first three volumes of which have been printed from the
stereotype plates, and will probably form Volume XX of Miscellaneous
Collections, to be issued early in 1881.

The ‘‘ Bulletins” of the Museum, as heretofore stated, are designed to
furnish check-lists, system of classification, and descriptions of the
natural history material on hand, for the purpose of illustrating the
zoological and ethnological collections belonging to the U.S. National
Museum, We.

The seventeenth Bulletin of the National Museum is on the zoological
position of Texas, by E. D. Cope. The author considers the subject of
the influence of environment on animal life, and the relation of the ne-
arctic and neotropical faune at their point of junction. Studies into the
zoology of Mexico have shown that the high plateau is populated by an
animal life which differs from that of the coastward plains. From in-
vestigations of the Batrachia and Reptilia, which are incapable of per-
forming migrations, the line of demarkation between the great northern
and southern realms is clearly indicated. The genera of South America
advanee northwards along the lower lands of Central America and
Mexico to the mouth of the Rio Grande, which is about their northern
boundary. On the other hand various genera of the southern regions of
North America extend their range southward as far as the city of
Mexico.

The great State of Texas is the field where the boundaries of the va-
rious genera is to be sought, since its fauna is of a most diversified
character. The geology, topogravhy, climate, and vegetation of this
region are described, and the author then proceeds to a consideration of
the distribution of its vertebrate animals in the following order: Mam-
malia, Aves, Reptilia, Batrachia, Pisces.

The author concludes that Texas is to be placed within the nearctic
realm, for although it possesses a number of genera which are common
to this realm and the neotropical, there are numerous genera which be-
long to the former exclusively and very few that belong to the latter
alone. To display these relations lists are given side by side of genera
whose geographical relations are in these three directions.

The species are shown in four geographica. groups, (1) those of the
extreme southwest, (2) those of the plateaus, (3) those of the low coun-
try, and (4) the east.

The discussion is a valuable contribution to science, and the paper has
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

attracted marked attention from naturalists. It forms an octavo of 51
pages.

Bulletin No. 18is a pamphlet of 278 pages, and is entitled ‘ Exhibit of
the fisheries and fish culture of the United States of America, made at
Berlin in 1880, prepared under the direction of G. Brown Goode, deputy
commissioner.”

This work is a catalogue of the articles brought together by the United
States Fish Commission for exhibition at the International Fishery Ex-
hibition held in Berlin in April, May, and June, 1880. An account of
this exhibition and of the display made by the United States, with the
awards to exhibitors, will be found in another place in this report.

The bulletin or catalogue was used as the official list or guide to the
American part of the exhibition, was republished in Berlin, translated
into German, and on account of its extent, classification, detail, and ac-
curacy, elicited much praise.

The work is arranged under six sections or heads, viz:

A. Aquatic animals and plants of North America beneficial or in-
jurious to man.

B. Fishing-grounds of North America.

C. Means of pursuit and capture.

D. Methods of preparation.

K. Animal products and their applications.

F. Research, protection, and culture.

Under each of these sections, subdivisions are made for the purpose
of systematic classification.

Proceedings of the National Museum.—As stated in the reports for
1878 and 1879, another series of publications relating to the Museum
has been introduced, designed to furnish to naturalists early anneunce-
ments and descriptions of specimens received, particularly when of new
species, together with such other matters of zoological interest as may
be furnished by correspondents, to which series the title of ‘“‘ Proceed-
ings of the National Museum” has been given. Of the articles published
in the Proceedings for the year 1880, Mr. R. Ridgway has furnished the
following:

(1) Revisions of Nomenclature of certain North American Birds. This
paper is an explanatory list of the names of North American birds
which, in accordance with the recognized rules of nomenclature, have
been changed or amended since the publication (in 1873) of the latest
catalogue of the species—Coues’s ‘Check List.” Thirty-one specific or
subspecific and twenty-five generic names are given as changed or
amended since that date, from the form given in the above-named
catalogue, while nineteen species given therein as geographical races or
varieties are raised to full specific rank, seven others being reduced to
the rank of subspecies.

(2) A Catalogue of the Birds of North America.—This catalogue is pre-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Al

pared with the view to supply the wide-spread demam/ for a catalogue
of North American birds which shall be complete up to date as >+gards
the enumeration of species known to occur in North America, and at the
same time includes a thorough though condensed digest, with references
of the additions to the fauna and changes of nomenclature which have
been made during the period of twenty-one years which has elapsed
since the publication of the last Smithsonian catalogue, in 1859, This
new catalogue, with numerous revisions and additions, is now (Decem-
ber, 1880) being printed for publication in pamphlet form.

(3) Catalogue of Trochilide in the collection of the United States Na-
tional Musewm.—This is a list of the species of humming birds contained
in the National Collection, all the localities represented by the specimens
being given with each species. The chief object of this list is to call at-
tention to the desiderata, so that correspondents may be able to furnish
species which are ledaine to the collection, and thus render it more com-
plete.

Dr. Tarleton H. Bean has furnished among other papers:

A list of European fishes in the collection of the United States National
Musewm.—About 350 nominal species are mentioned. As this list is in-
tended simply to facilitate exchanges with museums in Europe, the
names under which the fishes were received are retained without refer-
ence to our latest knowledge concerning the classification and specific
identity of certain species.

Other articles have been supplied by Messrs. S. T. Cattie, F. M.
Endlich, 8. Garman, C. H. Gilbert, T. Gill, G. B. Goode, O. P. Hay,
A. Heilprin, D. S. Jordan, G. N. Lawrence, W. N. Lockington, RK.
Rathbun, J. A. Ryder, R. Smith, J. J. Smith, J. G. Swan, A. E. Verrill,
and C. A. White.

Systematic Nomenclature.—In carrying out investigations in systematic
natural history a large part of the labor consists in determining the prior-
ity of names, especially those of the genera employed or proposed; and
for many years each inquirer was obliged to repeat the labors of others
and to waste a vast amount of his time thereby. In 1846. the late Prof.
Louis Agassiz prepared a listof all names of genera that had been pro-
posed in zodlogy, giving the dates, references to place of publication, and
the group of the animal kingdom to which they belonged. No greater
boon could have been extended to students than this compilation,
which answered its purpose fully for a number of years. In 18/5, Mr.
Marschall prepared a supplement to the work of Professor A gassiz,
which was also of very great moment. For many years past, however,
no convenient digest has been available to cover more recent researches,
as the spirit of scientific investigation is increasing in almost gecmet-
rical ratio, and the need of anew nomenclature has been apparent.
Mr. 8. H. Scudder, of Cambridge, Mass., has devoted a large povtion of
time lately to the preparation of a second supplement to Pyofessor
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Agassiz’s work, to include a general index to the whole; and by this
means, when published, the naturalist will be able to reduce the time
and trouble of a given research enormously. Mr. Scudder offered this
memoir to the Smithsonian Institution for publication, but as its own
funds were required for the other memoirs previously in hand, it was
accepted by the Department of the Interior, as a bulletin, and work
begun upon it. Some hundreds of pages have already been printed,
and it is hoped that the whole will be completed in the course of 1881.

Smithsonian Annual Report.—In consequence of the delay at the Gov-
ernment Printing Office, referred to in the last report, the Report for
1878 was not ready for distribution until March of the past year. Being
the first issued after the death of the late Secretary of the Institution,
Professor Henry, it was deemed proper to devote considerable of its space
to a presentation of his Hfe and scientific work. For this purpose, the
biographical memoir prepared, at the request of the Board of Regents, by
Dr. Asa Gray was appended to the Proceedings of the Board, while in
the General Appendix were inserted the accounts of his researches on
sound with reference to fog-signaling—his latest scientific work—re-
printed from the several reports of the Light-House Board, in which they
originally appeared, the whole being arranged in a connected article.
With the same view, also, an article prepared by W. B. Taylor on Prof.
Henry’s connection with the telegraph’was inserted, presenting his, as
yet, imperfectly recognized contributions to the scientific basis of that
invention.

The other articles in the Appendix are: Accounts of explorations in
Greenland by L. Kumlien, and in the Caribbee Islands by F. A. Ober;
a table of some physical constants by J. Le Conte—a contribution to the
proposed collection of all the constants of Nature and Art; an account
of some experiments on the effect of irritation of a sensitive nerve by B.
F. Lautenbach; translations of Arago’s biography of Condorcet, and of
Favre’s biographical notice of Agassiz; an abstract of the results of the
researches on Fever, made, with the co-operation of the Institution, by
Dr. H. C. Wood; and a republication of a list of the apparatus in various
institutions in the United States available for scientific research. The
whole forms a volume of 575 pages with 12 illustrations.

A nunber of ethnological articles, intended for this report, were un-
avoidably thrown over to the next.

The report for 1879 was presented to Congress on the 10th of March,
1880, and an edition of 15,500 copies were ordered, 2,500 for the
use of the Senate, 6,000 for the use of the House of Representatives, and
7,000 for the Institution. It is again a matter of regret that the publi-
cation of this work has been so long delayed. The amount of work or-
dered to be done at the Publie Printing Office is enormous and increases
every year, while the facilities for doing it remain very much the same.
As an evidence of the increase of work in this office, the Public Printer
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

states that the number of blanks printed during the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1880, exceeded those printed during the previous year by
25,000,000. The number of copies of unfinished works on December 1,
1880, ordered by Congress was 922,107. It is absolutely impossible to
satisfy all the requirements of the Departments and of Congress in a
reasonable time, and unfortunately the Smithsonian report is delayed
much beyond the desire and intention of the Institution.

In this report an unusually large space of the Appendix is devoted
to anthropology—all but four of the papers, in fact, coming under that
head. This was due, in part, to the increased attention given to that
branch of sciénce within the past few years, and in part to the fact that
the ethnological articles prepared for the report of 1878 were unavoid-
ably thrown over to this.

The full list of titles comprises: A study of the savage weapons at
the Centennial Exhibition, by E. H. Knight; reports of American obser-
vatories, prepared by E. S. Holden from the answers to the Smithsonian
circular asking for information in regard to the equipment and opera-
tions of the observatories in the United States; translations of Pisko’s
lecture on the present fundamental principles of physics; of Baumhauer’s
account of his proposed universal meteorograph for detached observa-
tories; and of: Worsaae’s statement of the measures taken for the pres-
ervation of antiquities and national monuments in Denmark ; abstracts
of replies to the Smithsonian archeological circular; and a statement
of the anthropological investigations pursued in 1879, both prepared by
Otis T. Mason; an Index to the Papers on Anthropology, published by
the Smithsonian Institution from 1847 to 1878, prepared by George H.
Boehmer, and the following papers on local ethnology and anthropology:
The French Half-Breeds of the Northwest, by V. Havard; Prehistorie
Remains in Montana, between Fort Hilis and the Yellowstone River, by
P. W. Norris; the Shoshonee or Snake Indians, their religion, super-
stitions, and manners, by Albert G. Brackett; Ruins in White hiver

among Indian mounds in Southern Florida, by 8. T. Walker; Report on
the shell-heaps of Tampa Bay, Florida, by 8. T. Walker; and Mounds on
Gideon’s farm, near Excelsior, Hennepin County, Minnesota, by Frank
H. Nutter.

The whole forms a volume of 631 pages, with 205 illustrations.

Of the documents published annually by the United States Govern-
ment, those of the Agricultural Department and of the Smithsonian
Institution are most in demand, as furnishing general information,
much sought after by various classes of the community. There is no
person of general literary or scientific taste who does not find in the
Smithsonian Reports something of interest, especially in the copious
store of archeological information and the statements of the present
condition and progress of science. The demand for the Smithsonian
Reports has been responded to by the publication of quite large editions
and the occasional reprints from the authorized stereotype plates. It
has been found, however, impossible of late years to meet the demands
in the increasing amount of interest manifested by the growing popula-
tion of the United States ; and although a liberal edition is published by
Congress, of Which about 6,500 have been assigned to the Institution
for years, copies of the Report for 1877 are entirely exhausted.

Fully realizing this fact, Senator Hamlin, a Regent of the Institution,
introduced a resolution providing for the increase of the printing of the
number of copies to 15,500, of which 7,000 were to be distributed to
the Institution. This resolution became a law, and it is hoped that
the demand for the volume for 1879 now about being delivered by the
Public Printer will be met.

The series of the stereotype plates of the volumes begins with 1862,
and it is proposed to make application to Congress for the printing of a
small edition of the volumes extending from that year to 1878, inclu-
sive, so that sets can be furnished to the many new public libraries
which have made their appearance wlthin the last few years.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The reasons for asking Congress for a museum building of suitable
magnitude, and the steps by which this end was accomplished, have been
duly presented in the preceding reports. Iam happy to announce at
the present time that the edifice has been substantially completed, and
that preparations are being made to oecupy it. In the accompanying
report of the architect of the building commission all the necessary de-
tails of the plan, cost, &e., will be found.

The magnitude of the edifice, and the complexity of the organization
necessary to fully occupy it, it is expected will require a considerable
time, but it is hoped that the work will be complete by-the end of the
year 1831, and that the establishment will thereafter be in full tide of
success.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

As has already been explained, the new museum is not intended
simply for the exhibition of objects of natural history, the controlling
idea being rather that of an ethnological exhibit, especially to include
illustrations of the applications of objects belonging to the animal, veg-
etable, and mineral kingdoms, and the requirements or luxuries of man.
To this end the collections made by the Smithsonian Institution and the
United States Fish Commission, for exhibition at the Centennial Expo-
sition of 1876, and the Berlin International Fishery Exposition of 1880,
come admirably into play, and constitute the basis of the material, which,
however, has been largely increased from other sources.

It is proposed to devote one-fourth of the space, about 25,000 square
feet, to an illustration of the mineral resources, in the form of building
stones, ores, combustibles, clays, pigments, We.

Another fourth of the building will be taken up by illustrations of
the animal industries, with representatives of the originals, or plaster
or papier-mache casts, of the principal animals used for food or other
purposes by man, together with all the various apparatus by which
they are pursued, captured, and utilized; then the results of the manip-
ulation, and also illustrations of the methods by which animals are pro-
tected or multiplied; this confining itself principally to an exhibition in
connection with the artificial propagation of fishes and other aquatic
animals.

A portion of the building will be filled by the display of othef special
objects, including the materia medica, foods, paints, and dyes of all
nations.

In the purely ethnological collections, or such as relate to the savage
or semi-civilized races of modern times, space will be provided for in
this building, and a small area assigned to the exhibition of mounted
mammals and osteological specimens. Fuller details of arrangement
will be reserved for the next report.

The expansion of the scope of the National Museum of course in-
volves an enlarged force, and the engagement of several specialists to
take charge of their respective departments. This has been deferred
until 1881.

in view of the large number of cases required in this building—not
less than one thousand in all—the selection of suitable plans and modes
of construction has been a matter of great importance, and we have
accordingly endeavored to obtain ail possible information as to methods
of arrangement in foreign and home ntuseums. Professor Agassiz has
kindly supplied working drawings of the newer cases of the Museum
of Comparative Zoology; and the authorities of South Kensington and
the new British Museum, as well as those of the Royal Museum of
Dresden, and other establishments, have rendered similar facilities.
Mr. G. Brown Goode, the curator of the museum, during the period of
his action as commissioner to the Berlin International Fishery Exposi-
tion, took occasion to visit all the principal museums in Germany, Italy,
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and Great Britain, and made himself familiar with the arrangements
prevalent therein. The result has been to supply many important ideas,
which will be carried out in connection with the new National Museum
at Washington.

In the necessary reorganization of the whole force of the museum, in
connection with the new departure, occasion was taken to reiterate and
enforce the rule which is adopted in most public museums through-
out the world, namely, that the officers connected with the museum
shall make no collections of any kind whatever for themselves
during the period of their connection with it. Although in most
cases a mere matter of form, it has been thought well to make such
a rule a condition of acceptance of a position and salary, as thereby
preventing any misunderstanding and removing any danger of making
an ollicial position the means of promoting private interest. Persons
in charge of a collection have many opportunities of securing speci-
mens from visitors, who offer objects of more or less interest, and who
are sometimes inclined to give them to the officer rather than to the
collection.

Increase of the Museum.—The additions to the National Museum dur-
ing the year 1880 have been fully up to the average, indeed scarcely
inferior to those of any previous year, with the exception of that of the
Centenhial Exhibition at Philadelphia. The collections of marine
animals, especially fishes and invertebrates from the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts of the United States, far exceed in value and extent those ever
before obtained. The most important sources of supply have been (1)
the collections of the United States Fish Commission, made on the
south coast of New England, and of the Gloucester fishermen, obtained
for the most part off the eastern banks, and transmitted through the
comission; (2) the collections made by Profs. D. 8. Jordan and Charles
H. Gilbert, of fishes and invetebrates, between San Diego and Puget
Sounds; (3) the collections of Dr. T. H. Bean and Mr. William H. Dall
in Alaskan waters of the North Pacific and in the Arctic Ocean; (4)
collections of marine animals made by Dr. White, Surgeon of the United
States revenue steamer Corwin, and by Captain Hooper commanding ;
(5) the general ethnological and zoological collections of Mr. E. H.
Nelson, of the United States Signal Service; (6) collection of archao-
logical objects made by Mr. James Stevenson, assisted by Mr. F. G. Gal-
braith. While, however, these are the most noteworthy there are many
others of great interest that will be referred to hereafter. The catalogue
of donations accompanying the report will give fuller details on this
subject, bearing in mind that no small number of contributions have
been received without indications of their origin, so that it becomes impos-
sible to make the proper acknowledgments to their contributors.

The regions covered by these contributions relate almost exclusively
to North America, a few collections only coming from Mexico or the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 47

West Indies; and a still smaller number from the rest of the world. A
number of very important series of fishes was obtained by Mr. Goode at
the Berlin Fishery Exposition, but as they have not been unpacked and
arranged, reference to them will be deferred until the next report.

Alasia, as the least known portion of North America, and the one pre-
senting the most numerous problems of interest, received special atten-
tion during the year, and the amount of material gained has been pro-
portionally great.

Mr. E. W. Nelson, observer of the sional office at Saint Michaels, has
continued his most important transmissions covering all branches of
scientific inquiry; among these the most specially noteworthy is the
collection of ethnological materials, illustrating the manners and customs
of the living Esquimaux of the region, as well as much of prehistoric
antiquity. Mr. Nelson has already sent in about 6,000 pieces of anthro-
pological matter. His collections of mammals, birds, &c., have been
of very great importance.

Under orders from Captain Patterson, of the Coast and Geodetic Sur-
vey, Mr. Dall, assistant of the Coast Survey, made a second visit to the
Alaskan seas in the schooner Yukon, originally built under his direction
for the service. By permission of Gain Patterson, seconded by the
invitation of Mr. Dall, Dr. T. H. Bean was detailed to accompany the
expedition for the purpose of investigating especially the fish and fish
eries of the northern waters.

The vessel left San Francisco in April, 1880, and touching at various
points passed into the Arctic Ocean, where quite an extended cruise
was prosecuted in the interest of the survey. It returned to San [ran-
cisco in November, 1880, and the collections of specimens, in forty-five
packages, were received not long after in Washington. ‘These embrace
very large numbers of ethnological and archeological objects, speci-
mens of birds, fishes, invertebrates, and other articles of great interest,
to some of which further reference will be made.

No collections were received this year from Mr. Lucien Turner, super-
intendent of the volunteer stations of the Signal Service of the Aleu-
tian Islands. Large gatherings, however, have been made by him
which will be due during the year 1881.

Mr. James G. Swan, of Neah Bay, Puget Sound, has continued his
valuable contributions to the National Museum, which have now ex-
tended over a period of many years. Being especially interested in
ethnology, specimens belonging to that branch were particularly at-
tended to, while many fishes also have been forwarded. -

Commander L. A. Beardslee, of the Jamestown, stationed at Sitka,
Alaska, has also made many contributions of birds and ethnological
objects.

A most important and extended exploration of tHe Pacifie coast was
that conducted by Prof. D. 8S. Jordan, assisted by Charles H. Gilbert.
Professor Jordan was detailed by Mr. Goode, in charge of the fishery
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

branch of the census of 1880, to obtain all the procurable information
in regard to fishery of the western coast; and leaving Washington in
December, 1879, after spending some time in San Francisco he proceeded
to San Diego and thence by successive stages to Puget Sound, his work
there overlapping and uniting with that of Mr. Swan. In this work he
embraced the opportunity of making extensive collections of alcoholic
specimens, of which no less than 65 large cans were transmitted. These
contain about 260 species of fishes, a number of them new to science,
and for the most part in sufficient numbers to supply many institutions
with duplicates, and to transmit desirable exchanges abroad.

The revenue steamer Corwin, on her usual cruise in the seas of Northern
Alaska, during 1879, was accompanied by Dr. R. White, of the Marine
Hospital Service, and a trained, ardent naturalist. Many important col-
lections were made by Dr. White, especially of seals, including many
foetuses, birds, and fishes. His specimens were received in the early
part of the year, and submitted for examination to various experts. I
regret extremely to have to report the untimely death of Dr. White,
partly from exposure in the service. In a second cruise of the Corwin
in the North Pacifie and Arctic Ocean, in 1880, Captain Hooper made
another collection of great interest, including a series of fossil bones from
Kotzebue Sound.

Mr. Belding, of Stockton, Cal., has furnished some interesting objects
from the interior of the State. The most important contributions, how-
ever, from the inland portion of the Pacific region have been those
supplied by Capt. Charles Bendire, of the First United States Cavalry,
an officer the value of whose services in the development of a knowledge
of the natural history of the West can scarcely be overestimated. For
many years, while stationed at military posts, he has been occupied in
securing eggs, nests, and birds, and other objects, and placing the infor-
mation and material thus gained in the bands of correspondents and
scientific specialists throughout the country. This service to science has
not involved any interference with his duties as an officer, his military
record being a brilliant one. Some months of the year 1880 were occu-
pied by Captain Bendire in the investigations of certain vexed questions
connected with the salmonide of Oregon and Washington Territory.
Leaving with a small party of men he visited numerous localities and
brought in a series of fishes, which, when fully examined, will enable us
to solve many problems in regard to them. Many other specimens, as
birds, &c., were obtained by Captain Bendire and transmitted to Wash-
ington.

Arizona has been represented by collections of living reptiles, fur-
nished by Dr. Corson and Dr. Moran, of the United States Army, as
also by a series of plants from Colonel Burr.

The contributions from New Mexico have been extremely important,
consisting, first, of a series, in 1879, of specimens gathered by Mr. James
Stevenson, with the assistance of Mr. Frank H. Cushing; and, secondly,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

of a series gathered by Mr. Stevenson in 1880, assisted by Mr. Galbraith.
These explorations were under the immediate direction of Maj. J. W.
Powell, in charge of the Smithsonian Bureau of Ethnology ; their special
object being the acquisition of a complete series of objects illustrating
the manners and customs of the pueblo towns of New Mexico and Ari-
zona. The investigation was carried from village to village, and about
one-half of the articles have been thoroughly worked up. The collection
embraces an immense quantity of pottery, of stone implements, dresses, or-
naments, &c. Mr. Hillers, a competent photographer, accompanied both
expeditions and obtained a large number of photographs, as also the
measurements of various Indian towns, both occupied and abandoned,
to serve as materials for a series of models.

Dr. J. C. Merrill, of the United States Army, has sent in a valuable
general collection from Fort Shaw and Montana.

Mr. Charles Rusby has also sent in some rare mammals from Wyoming
Territory.

The collections from Florida have been very extensive and valuable-
These consist, in part, of large numbers of fishes, furnished by Mr. Silas
Stearns, of Pensacola, while in the employ of the fishery branch of the
United States census and subsequently; and Mr. S. T. Walker, who, in
addition to fishes and reptiles, has sent large numbers of objects obtained
from the Indian mounds. From Mr. James Bell, of Gainesville, have
also been received valuable collection of ethnologicai objects and of liv-
ing reptiles, including many specimens of serpents of unusual size, which
have served to swell the series of plaster casts exhibited in the National
Museum.

The Atlantic coast of Florida and other Southern States is well repre-
sented by collections of fishes by Mr. R. E. Earll and Prof. M. McDon-
ald, of the fishery census department. From, or through, Mr. C. C. Les-
lie, an extensive and well-known fish dealer of Charleston, have also
been received many rare and some undescribed species of fishes.

The operations of the United States Fish Commission have furnished
a large number of objects from the middle coast of the United States,
especially from the line of the Gulf Stream south of New England,
Further reference to this will be made under the special head of the
Operations of the United States Fish Commission. The receipts through
the Commission include, also, large numbers of specimens obtained by
the Gloucester fishing fleet, and which is furnished in an alphabetical
record of the donors.

The ornithology of the peninsula of Virginia in the vicinity of Cobb’s
Island has been well investigated by Mr. Robert Ridgway, Mr. Henry
Marshall, and Mr. P. Jouy, all connected with the National Museum.
Many interesting birds, with their eggs, and of the young in downy
plumage, were secured in good condition for mounting.

On the western coast of Mexico, and especially in the Gulf of Cali-
fornia, Mr. Charles H. Gilbert, after completing his census work on the

S. Mis. 31——4
50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

California coast, made large collections of fishes for the National
Museum. Not much else has been received from Mexico beyond some
contributions from its National Museum, through the director, Mr. G.
Mendosa, and some interesting objects from Prof. A. Dugeés, of Guan-
axuato.

Previous reports have contained an account of the important services
of Mr. I. A. Ober in his natural history explorations in the West Indies.
This gentleman has renewed his work in that region in visiting a num-
ber of islands previously unexplored by him, and in sending the material
resuits to the Institution. The National Museum now, by his assistance,
contains by far the most complete collections of the birds of the West
Indies in existence.

Dr. H. H. Nicholls, of Dominica, W. I., has also made some valuable
contributions, including a large and undescribed species of parrot, named
by Mr. Lawrence Chrysotis nichollsii. The collections from Dr. Nicholls
include, also, some very interesting fishes, &c. From Mr. L. Guesde
has been received a series of excellently painted illustrations of Carib
antiquities in his possession, or accessible to him on the island. These
it is proposed to reproduce in a memoir to be published by the Institu-
tion.

Mr. Edward Newton, colonial secretary of Jamaica, has favored the
Institution with several specimens of living boas, to be reproduced in
plaster. Professor Poey, the eminent naturalist of Havana, has also
sent living reptiles, together with a number of fishes,—types of his elab-
orate papers.

South America is mainly represented by the contributions of Mr.
Figyelmesy, United States consul at Demarara. This collection con-
sists of ethnological objects, including a large boat, such as is used by
the natives.

As already stated, the collections from Europe have been principally
Series of fishes obtained for the most part by Mr. Goode at the Fishery
Exposition in Berlin, and furnished in exchange for series of fishes, &c.,
carried from Washington for the purpose.

Some desirable specimens of native handiwork from Western Africa
have been forwarded by Mr. Smythe, the United States minister at
Liberia.

Having thus given a brief sketch of the principal regions illustrated
by the collections transmitted during the year 1880 to the National
Museum, a reference to the objects themselves in their systematic order
may not be amiss.

Mention has already been made of a large number of general collec-
tions from different localities; that is to say, transmissions embracing
more than one particular group of objects. The most important of these
were received from Alaska, Florida, and New Mexico, although many of
more or less importance came from other regions. In later years the col-
lections most attractive to visitors in a public museum have been
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51

those illustrating the character and mode of life of the various portions
of the human race, more especially of those whose existence on the
zlobe dates back to a greater or less period in the remote past; and
it is in this direction that the National Museum may claim a special
importance so far as North America is concerned. With the exception of
fishes, the larger number of objects received relate to archeology and
ethnology. A prominent collection of this character is that transmitted
by Mr. E. W. Nelson from Saint Michaels. This embraces illustrations
of the handiwork of the Esquimaux of a large portion of Northwestern
Alaska, gathered in the journeys made by Mr. Nelson under great risks
and privations, They include objects of special interest in the way of
modern carvings of bone and stone, as well as many purely prehistoric
articles obtained from old Esquimaux settlements, long since aban-
doned. Mr. Nelson’s return is expected in a year or two, and he will
then devote himself especially to the preparation of a series of elaborate
reports on these and other researches.

Searcely inferior in interest and value are the ethnological collections
made by Dr. T. H. Bean and Mr. William H. Dall, on the voyage of the
United States schooner Yukon, to which reference has been made in
previous pages. These were gathered at points of the cruise of the
vessel on her journey from Sitka and various landing places of the
North Pacific and the Arctic Oceans.

Captain Beardslee, of the Navy, has also furnished some valuable
additions to the Alaskan series.

The collections made, under the direction of Maj. J. W. Powell, by
Mr. James Stevenson, with the assistance, first, of Mr. Frank H. Cush-
ing, and, second, by Mr. Galbraith, constitute enormous additions of
material to the National Museum, illustrating the character of the pueblo
tribes of New Mexico. They embrace many thousands of specimens of
pottery, dresses, ornaments, weapons, &c.

For further information in regard to the smaller collections in anthro-
pology, reference may be made to the alphabetical index of donors. Of
special note, however, among these, are some objects of stone collected
by Judge Henderson from the Naples mound in Illinois.

From Don Ignacio Galendo, of Monterey, was received an ancient
mummy from a cave in Coahuila. A stone image from Mr. Latimer, of
Porto Rico, constitutes an important addition to the collection of Porto
Rican antiquities bequeathed to the Smithsonian some years ago by Mr.
George Latimer, his uncle.

Mr. Figyelmesy, of Demarara, has sent some interesting objects, con-
sisting of an Indian boat, some Indian pottery, &ce.

Of mammals, the most important contribution is that of a large series
of fossil bones (including some reptiles) from Capt. E. Crawford, U.S.
A. These, at his request, have been placed at the command of Pro-
fessor Marsh for investigation.

A fine skull of the fossil beaver (Castoroides) was obtained by ex-
change from Professor Kost, of Adrian College.
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

An extremely important addition to the collection of North American
mammals is that of two good, mountable skins of the Histriophoca
equestris, or parti-colored seal of the North Pacific, of which only a
tanned skin had been previously in possession of the Museum. These
were obtained through the instrumentality of Mr. Dall.

Dr. White, of the Revenue Marine, obtained many specimens of fur
seals, including several embryos in alcohol. The Alaska Commercial
Company also supplied a similar collection. Judge Caton, of Illinois,
so well known for his great work on the ruminating animals of North
America, has furnished a specimen of Hydropotes inermis, a small horn-
less deer belonging to China.

Captain Howgate has presented two full-blooded Esquimaux dogs,
which have been sent to the Zoological Garden in Philadelphia for safe
keeping. From the garden itself has been oltained a series of skele-
tons of monkeys that had died in the garden. An embryo porpoise
from Mr. E. E. Small, of Provincetown, is also highly valued.

Of birds, many collections have been received, the most important
being the Alaskan series from Mr. Nelson, Dr. Bean, and Captain
Beardslee. Captain Bendire has furnished some much-appreciated
skins from Washington Territory; and a series of the birds of Cali-
fornia, from Mr. L. Belding, of Stockton, has filled some important gaps
in the collections.

During the summer Mr. Ridgway, curator of ornithology in the Insti-
tution, accompanied by Mr. Henry Marshall, taxidermist, and followed
subsequently by Mr. P. Jouy, an assistant in the Museum, visited Cobb’s
Island on the peninsula of Eastern Virginia, and obtained a series of
adults and young of a number of water birds from the remarkable breed-
ing grounds of that island.

A few specimens of Barrow’s Golden eyed duck, in the flesh, were
furnished by Mr. G. A. Boardman.

The barnacle goose (Lernicla leucopsis), presented by Mr. J. J. Kendall,
of New York, is the first specimen of that species obtained by the
Museum from a locality within the limits of the United States, although
a skin was received several years ago from Hudson’s Bay.

A finely-mounted specimen of the trumpeter swan, killed in Wiscon-
sin, was furnished by Prof. T. Kumlien, and a mounted sand hill crane
by Mr. Prouty.

The accessions of birds from Mexico and Central America were
fewer than usual, although some interesting Mexican specimens were
furnished by Professor Dugés.

An important addition to the West Indian collections was made by
Dr. Nicholls, of Dominica, in the form of a new and large species of
parrot. This, as previously stated, has been described by Mr. Law-
rence as Chrysotis nichollsii. Mr. Ober, in a renewed visit to the West
Indies, also added considerably to his former gatherings from islands
previously unvisited by him. The first series of his collections was
obtained by the Institution and placed in the National Museum.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

The additions of reptiles, although not very extensive, have been very
important, especially in the way of living specimens to serve as models
for a series of plaster casts. Among these were living Gila monsters
(Heloderma suspectum), from Dr. Corson and Dr. Moran, of the United
States Army, together with some turtles and lizards.

A living leather back turtle was sent from York River, Chesapeake
Bay, by Mr. J. Henderson. Mr. Bell, of Gainesville, Fla., transmitted
a magnificent series of most of the serpents of that State; among them
a banded rattlesnake, nearly seven feet in length. These have been for
the most part cast inplaster. Some of them were supplied to Dr. Mason,
of Newport, for examination and to serve as material for microscopical
investigations of the tissue of the brain and spinal marrow.

Living boas were furnished by Mr. Edward Newton, of Jamaica, and
Professor Poey, of Havana, the latter gentleman sending also some
living species of lizards and snakes.

Fishes.—As might be imagined from the activity manifested during
the year by the United States Fish Commission, and the fish census of
1880, the collection of fishes has received great additions, no previous
year in the history of the National Museum comparing with it in this
respect. The most important contributions in this department consisted
of the collections by Prof. D. 8. Jordan and Mr. Charles H. Gilbert, of
the fishery census. These gentlemen devoted a number of months dur-
ing the year to the systematic investigation of the food-fishes of the
western coast of the United States, and traversed the whole region from
San Diego to Puget Sound in their researches. The results filled 65
large tin cans, of 4 to 6 cubic feet each. About 260 species in all were
obtained, many of them new to science. Seventy duplicate sets of
Specimens were secured for distribution to the principal museums, at
home and abroad, and will be promptly transmitted to their respective
destinations.

Mr. Gilbert, after completing his work on the California coast, started
on his homeward journey by way of the Isthmus of Panama, and has
already made very large collections in the Gulf of California.

Mr. James G. Swan, of Neah Bay, Puget Sound, also obtained and
transmitted many specimens of fishes of that locality. The American
waters farther to the north were thoroughly explored in the interest of
ichthyology by Dr. T. H. Bean. The results amounted to between 80
and 100 species, some of them new to science, and others, long lost spe-
cies, of Pallas, &c.

Captain Hooper, of the revenue cutter Corwin, also transmitted some
valuable collections from the Arctic Ocean, among them a species of
Coregonus from Point Barrow.

Commander Beardslee, of the sloop of war Jamestown stationed at
Sitka, secured a number of desirable species. One of the most interest-
ing collections of the year was that made by Captain Bendire in the
interior waters of Washington Territory, in the course of a journey
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

instituted by him, with the permission of the War Department, for the
purpose of solving certain problems connected with the fishes of the
Columbia River and other waters, and especially the red fish of the
Wallowa Lake. His collections are now in the Museum, and will be
duly reported upon at the proper time.

A number of collections of fresh-water fishes from the interior of the
continent, especially from Utah, were furnished by Mr. G. K. Gilbert,
&ec. <A collection of Mississippi Valley fishes, from Prof. O. P. Hay, is
also highly prized.

The fishes of the Gulf of Mexico were furnished in large numbers dur-
ing the year by Mr. Silas Stearns, of Pensacola, and Mr. 8. T. Walker,
many of them undescribed species.

The South Atlantic coast is represented by some very valuable speci-
mens obtained by Mr. C. C. Leshe, a fish-dealer of Charleston, who has
previously placed the Institution under many similar obligations. He
was also instrumental in securing a number of collections made from the
outer islands or banks of the southern coast.

Mr. R. E. Earll and Col. M. McDonald, of the fishery census, have
also made and transmitted many extremely interesting collections, all
tending very greatly to complete the east coast species.

The first specimens of the eagle ray, sometimes called the devil fish,
obtained by the Institution were furnished by Lieutenant Sweitzer, U.
S.A. This species sometimes obtains an enormous magnitude, reach-
ing 20 or even 25 feet across the fins.

As a regular contributor, Mr. E. G. Blackford, of Fulton Market, New
York, has continued to furnish some very desirable species, his vigilance
being constantly exercised to obtain whatever he thinks is new, and to
forward it to the Institution.

The collections made by the United States Fish Commission, in its coast
explorations during the year, have been of unusual value, no less than
20 undescribed species of deep-sea fish having been taken during the
summer, with others not previously obtained, but already known.

As usual a large number of rare, and some new, species were obtained
from the members of the Gloucester fishing fleet, through the instru-
mentality of Mr. A. Howard Clark, of the Fish Commission, stationed
at Gloucester. The most noteworthy additions to the Museum resulted
from the work by the Fish Hawk, on the edge of the Gulf Stream, where .
four day’s work furnished 20 new fishes and over 150 species of mol-
lusks, of which about 40 were new to science. Other invertebrates of
interest were supplied by the Gloucester fishermen, and a number of
desirable species were obtained by Professor Jordan, Mr. Swan, Captain
Beardslee, and Messrs. Bean and Dall from the Pacific coast.

Among interesting illustrations of the progress and results of the fish-
cultural operations of the country received during the year have been
several species of salmonide, sent in by Mr. Stone from the McCloud
River. Mr. N. K. Fairbanks has furnished a specimen of California
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

salmon, caught in Geneva Lake during the summer, weighing about 10
pounds, this being undoubtedly one of the young fish introduced into
that lake some years before, hatched from eggs supplied by the United
States Fish Commission from the McCloud River establishment.

Another important specimen was that of a carp, from Mr. G. B. Mob-
ley, of Texas. This fish was one of a sending into Texas by the United
States Fish Commission in April, 1880, at which time it was about 4
inches long and probably weighed but little over an ounce. Hight
months after it was brought back from Texas to Washington, measur-
ing 21 inches and weighing more than four pounds! a very remarkable
illustration of the rapidity of the growth of this fish in America.

The acquisition, through the instrumentality of Mr. KE. W. Dennison,
of Boston, of a large brook trout was also a subject of interest, this fish
weighing more than 11 pounds and being one of the largest of the kind
ever taken within the limits of the United States.

Of exotic fishes the most important are several series of European
species, obtained by Mr. Goode at Berlin and from his colleagues at the
International Fishery Exhibition.

Reference to these will be found on another page.

A collection of fishes made some years since at Beyrout, in Syria, by
Dr. Kidder, of the Navy, was received last year, in good condition.
Professor Poey has continued his contributions of type species from the
Cuban waters.

A valuable miscellaneous series of fishes was supplied by the Museum
of Comparative Zoology of Cambridge, embracing species from both
North and South America.

Mr. Vinal Edwards, of Wood’s Holl, an agent of the United States
Fish Commission, has also continued his services in the constant watch
for rare stragglers.

In the preparation of the exhibit by the United States at the Inter-
national Fishery Exhibit at Beriin in 1880, invitations were sent to many
firms for contributions of specimens. These were quite readily complied
with. Purchases were made from other parties who declined to contrib-
ute, and who consequently lost the opportunity of competition. A
special catalogue will be furnished of this series. The collections, for
the most part, have been brought back to Washington, to form part of
the exhibit of fishery products in the new National Museum.

Shells —One of the most important additions to the collections of the
National Museum during the year has resulted from the presentation by
Mr. W.G. Binney of his entire collection of American Land Shells. The
history of this division of the mollusca, so far as North America is con-
cerned, is closely connected with the name, Mr. Amos Binney, father of
William G. Binney, having devoted especial attention to the air-breath-
ing land shells, and published a very elaborate and costly work on the
subject. The son took up the same group with the material left by Dr.
Binney, and has devoted many years of an active and laborious scien-
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tific career to it. In the collection received from Mr. William G. Binney
are to be found the types of both these series of researches, furnishing
a collection scarcely equalled, certainly not surpassed, by that of any
other museum in the country.

The possession by a public museum of such a type collection as
Mr. Binney’s is always considered a matter of very great importance,
especially as the objects are thereby more assured of continued preser-
vation and ready accessibility to students. It is to be hoped that ad-
ditional donations of the same character may be made from time to
time, as no better depository can be found in any other establishment.

Plants.—As the Department of Agriculture has the special charge of
the investigations relating to the vegetable kingdom, and is supposed to
take the necessary steps towards securing representations in its her-
barium, no special effort is made by the Smithsonian Institution to invite
or secure contributions, although whatever is received is immediately
transferred to that establishment. The only accession of importance
during the year is that of a series of plants of Japan, contributed by the
Mombusho or educational department of Tokio.

Fossils. —Of fossil remains large collections of invertebrates have been
deposited by Capt. Geo. M. Wheeler, and others have been presented
by Mr. B. H. Lyon and other paleontologists.

Minerals.—Many valuable mineral collections have been received from
various sourees, for the most part illustrating economical geology rather
than geology proper. The largest collection has been that of eight boxes
collected by Mr. Thomas Donaldson. Mr. Anthony Pirz has furnished
two magnificent stalactites from the Adelsberg cave in Carniola.

Paintings — Among the collections which will form part of the objects
in the National Museum, a very interesting and instructive exhibit will
consist of the Indian portraits and scenes painted by the late George
Catlin. These pictures, all from living subjects and of great merit as
faithful portraitures of aboriginal life and manners, were presented
to the Institution in 1879, by Mrs. Harrison, of Philadelphia, but
the paintings have necessarily been stored since their receipt, await-
ing the completion of the new Museum. They had also been stored in
ware-rooms in Philadelphia for many years, so that to preserve and
‘present them in a suitable manner with frames, &c., will require con-
siderable expenditure.

Miscellanea—The institution is under many obligations to General
Meigs for the presentation of medallion likenesses in plaster, of the size
of life, of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, W. F. Seward, and Sal-
mon P. Chase, which were prepared for use in the extension of the
U. S. Capitol building. As works of art, as well as likenesses of
eminent citizens, they are regarded as of much value and will be care-
fully preserved in the historical and art department of the National
Museum.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Bt

Work done in the Museum.—As in previous years, the time of the sev-
eral curators of the Museum and of their assistants has been, toa great
degree, occupied in receiving the collections coming from various sources,
doing to them what is necessary for their permanent preservation, en-
tering them in the record-books, properly labelling them, and then plac-
ing them in their appropriate receptacles.

The magnitude of this labor may be easily understood from what has
been said of the increase of the Museum during the year, no single
establishment in the United States, nor, perhaps, in the world, being in
receipt of so great a number of objects requiring such treatment. In
most establishments where a large amount of material is received
from time to time, this comes, for the most part, by purchase or dona-
tion, the several collections having already passed under the hands of
the taxidermist or specialist, so that all that remains is to properly place
the matter in a position for permanent preservation. The aggressive
campaign, carried on directly or indirectly by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion in unoccupied fields of research, involves a greater amount of labor
in treating the spoils of conquest. A statement of the general circum-
stances attendant upon the transmission of a miscellaneous collection of
specimens may perhaps serve as an illustration of what is here stated.
Thus, an explorer in the field announces that he las transmitted a cer-
tain collection from a given locality to the Institution. An entry is
made of the fact in what is called the announcement book, which is
ruled in columns to show successively the date of announcement, the
name of the sender, his address, the point from which the sending is
made, the general nature of the transmission, the agent to or through
whom forwarded, and the mode of conveyance. There are then left
two blank columns, one indicating the date of the arrival, the other the
freight and other charges, which are filled up at the proper time. When
the package arrives the date is entered in the announcement book, and
an entry made in another volume (the transportation record). The col-
lection or object is then recorded in still another volume (accessions to
the Museum), and has affixed to it a “ donation” number. Should there
be any letter or memorandum accompanying the parcel or consignment,
with fuller details than simply the locality and sender, it is transmitted
with the package to the general curator, under whose direction the
latter is opened and the contents assorted. Mammals, birds, reptiles,
&e., are assigned respectively to the various curators, whose business it
is, if possible without delay of a single day, to enter the specimens
in the respective Museum registers, and to affix a number, as inefface-
able as possible, corresponding to the entry in what is called the Muse-
um Register.

At this stage it is not necessary that the specimen be accurately
identified and named, as it is supposed that this can at any time be
done by the specialist. Care, however, is exercised to make an entry
of the donor, locality, date, and other facts of the history of the object
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

that a simple inspection or study will not furnish. After this the various
articles are placed where they properly belong. Some, however, require
further treatment by the taxidermist or otherwise.

Should the specimens belong to the ethnological series, and be com-
posed of animal substances, as of woolen material, fur, &c., they are care-
fully treated with a solution of corrosive sublimate in alcohol, so as to pre-
vent danger from insects, and finally placed in the cases where they be-
long, or packed away until they can be properly considered. Of course,
collections well dried, shells, minerals, fossils, &c., require little treat-
ment preliminary to their final disposition.

This Museum work, as already stated, occupies the greater part of the
time of the assistants, although most of them find the occasion and the
leisure to prepare critical monographs in regard to certain species, which
are then, for the most part, published in the Proceedings of the National
Museum.

The total number of entries in the record books of the Museum dur-
ing the year, as shown by the detailed list appended, embraces 14,586
numbers, averaging probably four or five distinct objects to each entry.
Where a number of articles of the same general character, from the °
same locality, are received from the same donor at the same time, the
same number may be affixed to all of them, as in the case of a collection
of shells, of fossils, of stone implements, &c. The total number of en-
tries and dates amounts to over a quarter of a million (actually, 281,511),
and fill over 60 large folio ledgers.

Among the more special investigations conducted by the naturalists
of the Institution, upon which papers have been prepared, are those on
archeology, by Dr. Charles Rau; on fishes, by Mr. G. B. Goode, and Dr.
T. H. Bean; on the birds, by Mr. Robert Ridgway; on the fossils, by
Dr. ©. A. White. Dr. I’. M. Endlich, before leaving for the West Indies,
and subsequently Dr. F. W. Taylor, made numerous examinations as
well as analyses of minerals.

Among investigations by collaborators not directly connected with the
Institution have been, those of crustacea, by Profs. 8S. J. Smith, Oscar
Harger, and E. B. Wilson, of Yale College; of mollusks, by Professor
Verrill and Mr. Sanderson Smith, of New York; of radiates and worms,
by Professor Verrill; of reptiles, by Prof. EZ. D. Cope, of Philadelphia ;
of fishes, by Mr. 8. E. Garman, of Cambridge ; of birds, by Mr. George
N. Lawrence, of New York, Dr. Elliot Coues, and Mr. Henshaw; of
mammals, by J. A. Allen, of Cambridge, and Dr. Coues.

The more important investigation in the marine invertebrates, how-
ever, has been made directly by Prof. A. E. Verrill, of Yale College, or
under his supervision. The insects have been transmitted to Prof. C.
V. Riley and Professor Comstock, of the Department of Agriculture;
the plants have been referred to the Department of Agriculture or to
Prof. Asa Gray, of Cambridge.

Work done on collections.—For a number of years past the Smithsonian
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

Institution has been in receipt of soundings taken by vessels of the
United States Navy in various parts of the world, and they have been
held in the hope of being able to make some definite arrangement for
disposing of them. As, however, there were no funds of the Smithson-
ian Institution or of the Navy for meeting the cost of investigating
them and publishing the results, with the necessary illustrations, nothing
was done beyond placing them in charge of Prof. Hamilton L. Smith, of
Geneva, N. Y., one of our best-known microscopists, and particularly
interested in the class of objects referred to.

During the explorations of the Challenger particular attention was
paid to the collecting of samples of the sea bottom, and on her return
to England this branch of research was placed in charge of Mr. J. Mur-
ray, and at the request of this gentleman, indorsed by Professor Smith,
the material in hand was sent to him to be elaborated in the prepara-
tion of the systematic work covering the entire field. This was with the
stipulation that a special report should be prepared upon the material
collected by the vessels of the Navy, to be published, if so desired, by
the Navy Department.

A very desirable arrangement has been made during the year by the
Institution in regard to the large collection of fossil plants brought in to
the National Museum by the explorations of Dr. Hayden, Major Powell,
Lieutenant Wheeler, &e., Prof. L. Lesquereux, of Columbus, Ohio,
having agreed to receive the collection in mass, to pick out*a reserve
series for the Museum, and to bring all the duplicates of each species in
separate packages, so that sets can be readily made up for distribution
to the educational establishments and museums of the United States.

The material sent to Professor Lesquereux filled many boxes, and a
portion of the reserve has already been returned to the Institution,
although not yet unpacked for want of a place for its exhibition. The
work will be completed with the publication of a report as soon as cer-
tain memoirs, now in press, are published, and it becomes possible
to state the page and plate where each type specimen is illustrated.

A part of the agreement with Professor Lesquereux is for the prepa-
ration of a complete check-list of the fossil plants of America, to include
Greenland and Alaska, to be used in connection with the proposed dis-
tribution of definite specimens and for the final arrangement of the
reserve series.

Dr. C. A. White has been engaged upon the examination, classifica-
tion, and registering of the paleontological collections, embracing those
which have for many years been in the possession of the Museum, as
well as those which have been more recently received, preparatory to
their final arrangement in the new building. This work of investigation
has embraced a more or less complete study of those forms which have
been found to be new to science or otherwise of especial interest, and
their publication and illustration in the Proceedings of the National
Museum ; and also, incidentally, the separation and labeling of the dupli-
60 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

cate specimens for exchange. All the invertebrate fossils at present in
the possession of the Museum have thus passed under a preliminary
examination by Dr. White.

Among the results of the investigation of the invertebrate fossils may
be mentioned the recognition of Productus giganteus Martin, in a collee-
tion obtained by the United States Fish Commission at McCloud River,
Cal., which species was not previously known to occur in American strata;
the recognition of Stricklandinia salteri and S. davidsoni Billings, among
some Upper Silurian fossils brought from Northern Georgia by Lieut.
A. W. Vodges, which two species had hitherto been found only in the
island of Anticosti.

As already stated, the fossil plants have been referred to Prof. Leo
Lesquereux for classification, which work is now in progress and in
large part completed, the specimens as fast as they were labeled having
been returned to the Museum. The greater part of the vertebrate fos-
sils have not yet been investigated, but a considerable number of boxes
received from Capt. G. M. Wheeler contain the types of vertebrate forms
which were described and figured by Professor Cope in Volume IV
Explorations and Surveys west of the 100th Meridian.

A large proportion of these paleontological collections, vertebrates
invertebrates, and plants, consists of the type specimens upon which
species and genera have been founded, and many other species and
genera are represented among these collections by authentic examples.
Among them are the types of the greater part of the species which
have been published in the reports of the different explorations and
surveys by authority of the general government, and by the Smithso-
nian Institution and National Museum.

The following is a list of the titles of the articles from the pen of Dr.
White, based on the museum collections, which have been published in
the Proceedings:

Descriptions of new species of invertebrate fossils.

Note on Hndothyra ornata.

Note on Criocardium and Hthmocardium.

Descriptions of New Cretaceous Invertebrate Fossils from Kansas and

Texas.

Note on the Occurrence of Productus giganteus in California.

Note on Acrothele.

Description of a New Cretaceous Pinna from New Mexico.

Note on Stricklandinia salteri and S. davidsoni in Georgia.

Description of a very large Fossil Gasteropod from the State of Pueblo,

Mexico.

Descriptions of New Invertebrate Fossils from the Mesozoic and Ceno-
zoic rocks of Arkansas, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah.

Distribution of duplicate specimens.—It is a question whether any
museum has ever made so systematic, thorough, and extensive a disposal
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

of its surplus material as has been made by the Smithsonian Institution
within the last twenty-five years. There is scarcely a public museum in
the country, especially if connected with a scientific society, university
or college, that has not received a share. In later years these distribu-
tions have been extensive including, as they have, the surplus stock
gathered by the extensive operations of the United States Fish Com-
mission.

An additional advantage connected with these distributions is the
fact that nothing is ever sent out without being thoroughly identified
and named by competent masters, so that the objects constitute types
of the utmost value.

The extent to which this distribution has been carried during 1880
may be understood from the fact that it embraced over 14,000 specimens,
each accompanied by labels showing name, locality, &c. The total num-
ber of specimens distributed to date is not much short of half a million
(actually 407,255).

Assistants in the Museum.—A large appropriation was made by Con-
gress for the service in the National Museum required by the erection
of the new building, and available first in 1880. This required a reor-
ganization of the entire force and a more specific definition of the duties
and responsibilities to the Institution. All persons who had been em-
ployed received a specific letter of appointment, a condition of which
requiring formal acceptance in writing was that the incumbent, during
his connection with the Institution, should make no private collections
in natural history of any kind whatever. This rule is in force in all the
European museums, and is considered absolutely necessary for their inter-
ests, as the curators have ample opportunities of inducing the diversion
of material from the museum to themselves, if they are so inclined. In
the experience of the Smithsonian Institution there has been no reason
to suppose that this danger is to be guarded against; but it was thought
best to establish a general principle, so that there should be no misun-
derstanding at any time. All the persons appointed have agreed to the
condition, which is now in full force.

Courtesies from Foreign Museums.—The authorities and trustees of
the British Museum have been engaged for several years in the pre-
paration and erection of new buildings at South Kensington, for the
accommodation of the natural history collections, transferred from the
location where they have been housed for so many years; and as it was
presumed that the architects and curators of the museum would make
a very exhaustive study in regard to what was needed for the exhibition
of the specimens in the new building, application was made to Dr. Giin-
ther, the chief of the zoological department, for such information as he
might feel at liberty to render. He kindly and promptly responded by
sending numerous drawings and specifications, whichhave been carefully
studied and made good use of in connection with the arrangements for
the National Museum building.
62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The directors of the science and art branch of the South Kensington
Museum have very kindly supplied a volume containing engraved plans
and elevations of the glass cases of that establishment.

To Prof. A. B. Meyer, of Dresden, the Institution is also indebted
for drawings of certain new iron cases lately erected in the Zoological
Museum of that city. He added to the obligation also by having pre-
pared and sent to us the elementary parts of the cases, of natural size,
so as to furnish a better idea of the mode of construction and fitting.

THE ETHNOLOGICAL BUREAU.

As in previous years, an appropriation was made by Congress for the
prosecution of researcbes into American ethnology in 1880, under the di-
rection of the Smithsonian Institution. The superintendence of this work
was continued in charge of Prof. J. W. Powell, the appropriation: being
expended partly in keeping up the office organization of the Bureau and
partly in continuing the series of special researches into the ethnology
and linguistics of the Indian tribes. A portion of the appropriation was
also expended in continuing the explorations under the direction of Mr.
James Stevenson into the ethnology of the pueblos of New Mexico. In
1877 a number of villages were visited and complete collections of every-
thing illustrating their domestic habits, their weapons of war and the chase,
their religious ceremonies, &c., were obtained. During the present year _
other villages were visited by the same parties, and large collections
were made and shipped to Washington. These have not yet been re-
ceived, but when they arrive will constitute a very important addition to
the National Museum.

In addition to the general work prosecuted by Major Powell, he has
been requested by General Walker to superintend the work of taking
the census of the Indians for the census of 1880; and for this purpose
he has appointed a number of agents to visit various portions of the
United States for carrying out this business. Major Powell himself has
spent a number of months in the field in connection with the same work.

RELATIONS OF THE INSTITUTION TO OTHER DEPART-
MENTS AND ESTABLISHMENTS.

As shown by the past history of this Institution, its relations to the
different departments of government and to numerous establishments
in this and other cities have been varied and important.

The Government.—With the Library of Congress, the Institution is
brought into constant intercourse, from the many contributions of valu-
able scientific works and journals continually made from donations, ex-
changes, purchases, and other sources. With the Army Medical Museum
there is the exchange of anatomical objects for ethnological and zoological
specimens. With the Signal Office of the War Department there have
been interchanges of meteorological observations and records. With
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

the Interior Department has naturally arisen a frequent communication
relative to the material and information derived from the various gov-
ernment explorations and geological surveys. The Treasury Depart-
ment has had occasion to institute investigations relative to the precise
identification of manufactured and other articles, and the methods of
detecting substitutions or adulterations, with special reference to cus-
toms duties and the prevention of fraud in the collection of revenue.
With the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, interesting rela-
tions have sprung up relative to certain features in physical geography.
The scientific character of the National Observatory has naturaily
brought about an affiliation of the interests and purposes of the two
institutions, and co-operation has been maintained especially with refer-
ence to the international transmission of astronomical discoveries by
telegraph. To the custody of the Agricultural Department, the In-
stitution has transferred from time to time all the entomological and
botanical material coming into its possession from the contributions of
its numerous correspondents.

Gallery of Art.—In conformity with the established policy of the In-
stitution— co-operation rather than competition”—it has made the
Corcoran Art Gallery its depository of any works of fine art it may re-
ceive by exchange or otherwise.

A portrait which is claimed to be an original likeness of General
Washington was sent to the Institution by Mr. E. C. Bruce, of Virginia,
to be placed on exhibition in hopes of finding a purchaser at a satisfac-
tory price. This portrait, said to have been painted by Mr. Polk, was,
with the consent of the owner, deposited in the Corcoran Art Gallery,
where it is now on exhibition.

In the early part of the year a letter was received from Mr.
W. W. Evans, of New York, suggesting that communication be ad-
dressed to the Government of Italy for the purpose of obtaining some
of the numerous duplicates secured by the latter in the progress of the
excavations at Pompeii. In pursuance of the suggestion a correspond-
ence was entered into, through the American minister in Rome, with the
proper authorities in Italy. . This is not yet concluded, but it is thought
that whenever a suitable exchange can be offered on the part of the Na-
tional Museum the desired object may be accomplished.

In connection with the subject of art, a favorable mention should be
made of a life-size bust of Professor Henry, by Mrs. C. 8. Brooks, of
New York, now on exhibition in the Regents’ room of the Smithsonian
building. This bust, of considerable merit as a portraiture, is remark-
able as having been modelled entirely from a photograph.

Polaris Expedition.—The history of the expedition of Capt. C. IF’. Hall
in the direction of the North Pole, on the steamer Polaris, and its gen-
eral results, have already been referred to in previous reports. As was
64 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to be expected, Congress made a liberal provision for the publication of
the results of the expedition. The narrative volume was prepared un-
der the supervision of Admiral Davis, at the time Superintendent of the
Naval Observatory at this city, and the volume of physical results, pre-
pared under the direction of Dr. Emil Bessels, the chief of the scientific
corps of the expedition, and pr:nted by Congress. There still, however,
remains a large amount of material relating to the geology, natural his-
tory, and ethnology of arctic America, and Dr. Bessels has been con-
tinuing the elaboration of this work for publication, having a room in
the building assigned for the purpose.

Congress at the last session made an appropriation of $8,000, and
placed it under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, to be ex-
pended in preparing this material for final publication. The supervi-
sion of the work was placed in Dr. Bessel’s hands, and in order to com-
plete his researches on the history of the Esquimaux, it became necessary
for him to visit Copenhagen and have conference with Dr. Rink in ref-
erence to that branch, as also to study the collections in the Copenhagen
Museum. He has been very sucessful in his mission, and expects to re-
turn in February, and immediately thereafter to begin the printing of
his final report. By authority of the Secretary of the Treasury the dis-
bursal of the funds was placed in charge of Mr. Thomas J. Hobbs, one
of the disbursing clerks of the Treasury Department.

The Alaska Commercial Company.—For many years the Alaska Com-
mercial Company has acted to a great degree as the agent of the Smith-
sonian Institution on the Pacific coast, and the heartiest acknowledge-
ments are due for its assistance during the year 1880, as well as in pre-
vious years. It has not simply been the agent for the transmission or
reception of packages between Washington and San Francisco, but has
readily undertaken the purchase of supplies and their transmission to
the agents of the Institution, in many cases making large money ad-
vances. The entire business has necessarily involved the employment
of much official time, and in some cases doubtless considerable annoy-
ance. This, however, has been cheerfully rendered by the company
without any consideration whatever.

The company has also made many contributions to the Museum from
the collections sent toit by its own agents.

Centennial Commission Archives.—In the latter part of 1880 a meeting
of the executive committee of the International Exhibition of 1876 was
held in Philadelphia for the purpose of closing up the business of: the
exhibition. It was then decided to deposit all the archives of the com-
mission in the National Museum at Washington, and the Secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution was notified of this action.

The value and importance of these papers, plans, &c., will increase
with time, and the determination of the commission to secure for them
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 65

permanent preservation at the national Capital is to be considered as
patriotic and judicious. I have formally assured the commission of the
willingness of the Institution to receive the articles as soon as a suitable
place can be prepared in the new Museum for their reception.

National Academy of Sciences.—The regular meeting of the National
Academy of Sciences was held in Washington on the 20th day of April,
the accommodations being furnished, as in 1879, by the officers of All
Souls’ Church. It is hoped that at no distant day it may be in the power
of the Smithsonian Institution to again offer the necessary facilities of
room, “c., to the Academy. Prof. Wm. B. Rogers, president of the
Academy, presided, and the meeting was in every way a successful one,
a very large proportion of the members being in attendance and
many interesting papers communicated. As the early history of the
Academy was closely connected with that of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, by reason of Professor Henry having been the president for many
years, the files, correspondence, and archives were searched for data
illustrating this relationship, and the results transmitted to Professor
Rogers.

Paris International Congress and Exposition relative to Electricity.—
Through the courtesy of the State Department, this Institution received
early copies of circulars and programmes relative to a proposed inter-
national congress of electricians, and also to an international exhibition
of electrical apparatus and applications, to be held at Paris in 1881.
These papers have to some extent been appropriately distributed. By
an official decree of President Grévy, of the French Republic, dated
October 23, 1830, a congress of electricians is invited to meet at Paris
on the 15th of next September (1881), the presiding officer of which
body will be the minister of the postal service and telegraphs, M.
Ad. Cochery. An international exposition of electrical apparatus of
all kinds, designed for the production, propagation, avd utilization of
electricity (as well as of ail memoirs and treatises relating to that subject)
is appointed, to be held in the palace of the Champs Elysées, from the
Ist of August to the 15th of November, 1881. M. George Berger has
been appointed the commissioncr-general of the congress and of the ex-
hibition.

As a token of interest and co-operation in this enterprise, the Insti-
tution has sent to the commission, for deposit in the bibliographical
class, a copy of each of its publications relating to electricity and ter-
restrial magnetism, to wit, four numbers of its octavo series (of Miscel-
laneous Collections), and thirteen numbers of its quarto series (of Smith-
sonian Contributions).

Recognition by Foreign Governments.—A gratifying testimonial to the
appreciation of the Smithsonian Institution in its labors connected with
the results of international exchanges, &c., was furnished by the action

of the International Exposition in Sydney, Australia, in presenting to it
a bronze medal, although no exhibit of any kind was made by the Institu-
tion on that occasion.

MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS.

Loss of Employés and Collaborators.—It is seldom that a year passes
without entailing the mournful task of recording the loss by death of
one or more of those who have been either directly employed by the
Institution, or have rendered it assistance in the prosecution of its varied
scientific operations. In the necrology of the past year, several valued
names are to be included.

In the death of Dr. THomAs M. BREWER, at his residence in Boston,
on the 2d of January last, the Smithsonian Institution loses one of its
best and earliest friends, and one who always rendered important serv-
ice in his capacity as editor of a leading Boston daily journal, and did
much toward keeping the public advised of the true spirit of the opera-
tions of the Institution. ;

In his death the science of ornithology loses one of its earliest votaries,
constituting, as he did, a exnnecting link between the present epoch and
the period of Audubon and Nuttall. Dr. Brewer’s specialty was in his
knowledge of the history and the habits of birds, and especially of their
nidification, and he has always been the highest authority on everything
relating to the eggs of North American species. Many years ago he
planned an exhaustive work on North American Oology, to be illustrated
by the best drawings that could be procured, and an agreement was
made by the Smithsonian Institution to publish this work in successive
parts. The first number of this North American Oology was published
by the Institution, and embraced more particularly the rapacious birds,
the swallows, the goat-suckers, and the king-fishers. This publication
took place at a time when the knowledge of North American birds was
undergoing many changes, resulting from the expansion of the territory
of the United States and the better knowledge of its different portions.

The further publication was deferred for a time, but arrangements
were being made at the time of his death to take up the work again and
carry it to its completion.

Dr. Brewer has done a great deal towards popularizing American
ornithology by his investigations and correspondence with ornithologi-
cal students of all grades of advancement. To no one so much as to Dr.
Brewer is due the love of ornithology that is so prevalent in New Eng-
land. In 1840, he published an American edition of Wilson’s Crnithol-
ogy, Which met for a time a much felt want, and he has also published
a large number of papers on ornithological subjects. His most im-
portant work, however, was in connection with the History of North
American Birds, by Baird, Brewer, and Ridgway, printed by Messrs.
Little & Brown, in 1873, of which three volumes have so far appeared,
namely, those on land species. Of these the entire biological text was
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

furnished by Dr. Brewer. At the time of his death, he left behind the
manuscript of the water-bird portion of the same history. This is now
in the hands of Mr. Alexander Agassiz, and will probably be published
soon as one of the remaining portions of the work.

Dr. Brewer had been threughout his life one of the chief supporters
of the Boston Society of Natural History, of which, indeed, he was
one of the founders, occupying year by year important posts in con-
nection with the society; and his influence upon it cannot easily be over-
estimated.

After giving up his editorial connection with the Boston Atlas and
Traveller, Dr. Brewer entered into business as a publisher and book-
seller; and retiring from this a few years ago, he spent a year and a
half in travelling in Europe, in the course of which he visited all the
ornithological and oological establishments, and arranged special con-
nections between their owners or the curators. Partly as the result of
this visit, and partly of long-continued and persistent efforts, he became
possessed of one of the finest general collections of eggs in the world,
but especially rich inthe North American species. These collections he
caused to be passed over at his death to the Museum of Comparative
Zoology of Cambridge, where they are safely preserved, and constitute
one of the most striking features of that great museum.

The death of Mr. JAMES W. MILNER, which occurred at his residence,
Waukegan, illinois, on the 6th of January, 1880, was a serious loss to
the science of fish-culture. Mr. Milner had been connected with the
United States Fish Commission as assistant commissioner for many
years past, having been in its service indeed, from the first year of its
‘organization. He commenced his labors, as a collector of statistics in
regard to the fisheries of the great lakes, the results of which appear
in the reports of the commission. In later years he had had charge
more particularly of the division of the propagation of food-fishes, in
the course of which he invented or brought into use many important
practical discoveries. In the course of his visits to different parts of
the country he also took occasion to make extensive collections in
natural history for the National Museum, all of which are recorded in
its catalogues.

Mr. Milner’s illness was induced by a severe cold (taken in the spring
of 1878,) which assumed a malarial tendency, and required his return to
Lake Michigan for recuperation. He again assumed charge of his work
in the autumn of that year, organizing the arrangements for the hatch-
ing of codfish by the United States Fish Commission at Gloucester, in
the months of October and November. His increasing indisposition,
however, made it necessary for him to go to some other locality, and he
returned to Washington, and after spending a short time he went to Flor-
ida, where he remained during the winter.

He returned to Waukegan in the spring of 1879; but this season was
exceptionally raw and trying on the lakes, and by the direction of his
68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

physician he visited Colorado for the summer. He, however, failed to
improve, and was brought to Waukegan in the autumn, and after much
suffering died, as stated, on the 6th of January, 1880.

A man of modest and agreeable demeanor, Mr. Milner, by careful obser-
vation and study, had mastered the theory and practice of fish-culture,
and had himself made many important improvements. His loss to the
Fish Commission is one which it will be extremely difficult to replace.

Mr. J. HOMER LANE must be mentioned as a valued collaborator of
the Institution, who died in this city May 5d of the past year. A grad-
uate of Yale College, he commenced his career as a teacher. His high
scientific and mathematical attainments having become known to the
Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey, he was early ap-
pointed to a position in that branch of the public service. About the
year 1847, on the recommendation of Professor Henry, Mr. Lane was
transferred to the United States Patent Office, as opening to him a more
varied and active occupation; and he discharged the responsible duties
of an Examiner in that institution with a pains-taking fidelity for many
years. On the death of Mr. Saxton, who had charge of the construe-
tion and verification of the national and metric standards (under the
Coast Survey Office), Mr. Lane was recalled te that bureau to fill this
vacancy,—a position held by him till his death.

Mr. Lane had given considerable attention and study to the mathe-
matical theory of electricity, and in 1859 he conducted, at the request
and under the general supervision of Professor Henry, a series of ex-
periments for this Institution, on several points of scientific interest
relating to the Atlantic telegraph, a brief notice of which investiga-
tion was given in the Smithsonian Report for 1859, p.38. To Mr. Lane
was also occasionally referred, for examination and report, communica-
tions or memoirs requiring for their thorough treatment a special famili-
arity with the higher mathematics. In 1866, he undertook an elaborate
investigation into the conditions of successive expansion or rarefaction
in gases, having particularly in view a more precise determination of
the absolute zero of temperature. In these experiments he was assisted
by apparatus specially constructed for him by the Institution.
His fastidious desire for extreme accuracy led him to postpone the
publication of results until it is feared that the valuable work actually
accomplished by him in this direction will not be available for the pro-
motion of knowledge among men, to which purpose he had so long and
earnestly devoted himself. Mr. Lane was remarkable for the logical
clearness of his mind and the strict conscientiousness of his moral
nature.

When Mr. William H. Dall returned, in 1873, from his labors in
Alaska, under the direction of the United States Coast Survey, he
brought with him a young Aleute, named GEORGE TSAROFF, who com-
mended himself to him by his intelligence. With the aid of some
persons interested in education, Mr. Dall secured for his protégé an ex-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

cellent education in Michigan, in the course of which he learned to read,
write, and speak the English language with great readiness. On com-
pleting his course of education, he was brought to Washington as an
assistant, and placed in charge of the large ethnological hall in the see-
ond story of the building, his duties being to keep everything in order
and to act as a guide to visitors. These he performed with efficiency,
himself constituting an extremely interesting exhibit —that of a native
Indian, well educated and instructed, and able to explain the special
objects and applications of many articles manufactured and used in his
own country.

I regret to say that this interesting assistant was attacked by con-
sumption, and for greater convenience of careful treatment, he was re-
moved to Providence Hospital on the 2d of March, where he died on the
Sth of May.

Among the deaths of those deserving special notice in this report
is that of Mr. WILLIAM Q. ForcE, who for many years had charge of
the meteorological department of the Institution. He was the son of
General Peter Force, of Washington, at one time mayor of the city, and
well known for his devotion to the study of American history. His col-
lection of books in this department was the largest in the country, and
was purchased by the government for the Library of Congress. Inthe col-
lection of these books and in the preparation of the ‘American Archives”
Mr. William Q. Force was the principal assistant of his father. He also
edited and published the “Army and Navy Chronicle and Scientific
Repository,” and several works relating to history and statistics. He
graduated at Columbian College in 1839, studied law, and in 1857 took
charge of the meteorological! department of the Smithsonian Institution,
discharging the duties of the position for eleven years with marked
fidelity and ability. He resigned on account of an attack of illness,
which caused a permanent derangement of his nervous system, and he
devoted the remainder of his life to literary pursuits and to quiet and
unobtrusive deeds of charity.

He held several important positions of honor and trust in connection
with religious and educational enterprises and establishments, in all of
which he was noted for his scrupulous honesty, purity, and fidelity. In
all the relations of life he was a noble example of a man wholly actuated
by Christian principle, and whose practice conformed rigidly to his pro-
fessions.

Berendt manuscripts.—The long-continued labors of Dr. CARL Hmr-
MANN BERENDT, in Mexico and Central America, relating to the eth-
nology and philology of the native tribes, prosecuted to a certain degree
under the auspices of the Institution, have been detailed in its previous
reports at various times within the last twenty years and more; and it
is with great regret that I have to announce the death of that gentleman
in the city of Guatemala on the 12th of April, 1878.

He left his valuable manuscripts and rare books with Mr. B. Wester-
70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

mann, of New York, and many similar articles were in his own rooms in
Guatemala. These, by an arrangement with his executor, Mr. Wester-
mann, were gathered together by Mr. Francis Sarg, a fellow countryman,
who was also a resident of Guatemala; and by the kind mediation of
Capt. John M. Dow, forwarded to the Smithsonian Institution, filling
five boxes.

An inventory of this property was made by the Institution and trans-
mitted to Mr. Westermann, who also had prepared a catalogue of the
first collection, the whole of which constitutes a very important mass of
historical and scientific matter, both in print and manuscript; and it is
to be hoped that some arrangement may be made by which this can be
added to some public library in the country, and no better depository
could be found than the Library of Congress.

Although engaged for many years in the researches referred to, Dr.
Berendt had printed but little, so that unless his manuscripts are care-
fully edited and published, his life work will have left but little on record.
With an assurance of long life and an ultimate opportunity of publica-
tion, a feeling not uncommon among literary men, Dr. Berendt allowed
the opportunity of presenting his labors to pass while aiming at further
perfection.

Donations.—A. large fire-proof safe was presented to the Institution
for the National Museum by the Herring Safe Company of New York; a
notice of which was given in the last Report. This safe has just been re-
ceived, and is an admirable specimen of the well-known skill of this enter-
prising company. It stands about seven feet high, and by its fine finish
forms an attractive piece of furniture. It will prove a very useful re-
ceptacle for small objects of special rarity and value belonging to the
Museum.

Mention should be made of several other contributions of interest.
One of such has been a pair of Howe scales, presented by Messrs. F. P.
May & Co., of Washington, the agents of the Howe Company. These
scales have been placed in the entrance hall of the Institution, and are
constantly in use for weighing visitors.

Among the contributions to the Institution of a miscellaneous char-
acter during the vear is that of a hydro-pneumatic fire-extinguisher, pre-
sented by the agent of the company in Washington. ‘This is claimed to
possess specially valuable qualities which fit it for practical use in pub-
lic and private establishments, and is kept in order for ready applica-
tion should an emergency requiring it arise.

Of the works published by the United States Government during the
last few years none has had more popularity than the narrative of
the second arctic expedition made by Capt. C. F. Hall, edited by Prof.
J. EK. Nourse. Congress has ordered several editions of this work and
placed copies of it for sale at the mere cost of paper and printing. In
this work illustrations are given of Esquimaux life, manners, and cus-

toms, the articles represented being specimens in the National Museum.
During the last year the Secretary of the Navy has offered to the In-
stitution the manuscripts, notes, plates, cuts, &e., of Captain Hall’s
work to be preserved in its archives.

Loan of books and apparatus.—The Smithsonian Institution has been
proverbial, from its first establishment, for the liberality with which the
use of books, apparatus, and specimens has been allowed whenever re-
quired in the interest of science, the regulations of many institutions
absolutely prohibiting the removal from their halls of such articles, not
being at all enforced. It was found necessary, however, to establish
some restrictions to the indiscriminate borrowing, as it was ascertained
that in many cases the borrower was careless about returning the ob-
jects obtained by him, so that when others required their use they were
not available for the purpose. In some instances rare volumes of trans-
actions of learned societies would be kept for years, and not unfrequently
an entire set would be returned after the death of the borrower; in
other cases, when called for, the report would be that they were not pro-
ducible.

In order to throw upon the borrower the onus of making a proper
return without unnecessary delay, Professor Henry decided to require
a deposit in money, or a certified check, far in advance of the value of
the object itself; in the case of the loan of a volume of transactions the
money security called for representing the value of the entire series.
This condition has given offense in some cases, persons thinking that
the deposit should be simply of a money value equal to the value of the
article borrowed. ‘This, however, would not answer the purpose, as, in
many cases, individuals would be glad to obtain a rare work at cost;
and as the Institution is not engaged in trade and needs its books and
apparatus for its own research, and that of its collaborators, the propri-
ety of the regulation has, I think, been fully vindicated. The required
deposit for books amounts, generally, to from $25 to $109, and of course
the borrower, whose money is in the hands of the Institution, does not
leave it there longer than is necessary. When the book is returned
the money is sent back and the transaction closed. This same regula-
tion has been extended to the loan to parties of other articles having a
definite money value. ;

Loan of specimens.—As far as specimens of natural history are con-
cerned the regulations are arranged on a different footing; and as a
further means of preserving the integrity of the Smithsonian collections,
the following form of “‘receipt” from naturalists who may borrow its
material, has been adopted by the Institution:

[ Locality ———-Date —-—]

poses of investigation, -and returned in as good condition as they were
“received, and as soon as my work upon them is completed. Second.
That no unique specimens constituting part of the reserve series of the
National Museum shall be mutilated. Third. That duplicates when
necessary may be dissected; understanding by ‘duplicate,’ a specimen
which is not necessary to illustrate variations of forms or range of geo-
graphical distribution. Fourth. That the specimens when returned
shall be labeled with the names which I have employed in my }ublica-
tions upon them. Fifth. That credit shall be given to the Smithsonian
Institution in all publications based upon material furnished by it.”

Restoration of the Declaration of Independence.—Several years ago a
commission was appointed by Congress (under an act approved August
3, 1876), consisting of the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, and the Librarian of Congress, for the purpose
of taking into consideration measures for the restoration of the faded
and now nearly illegible Declaration of Independence. Some conferences
were held on this subject and some experiments made in regard to it, but
without result. A meeting of the commission was held at the Depart-
ment of the Interior on the 5th of May last, and, after discussion, it
was decided that it was one of the subjects coming within the province
of the National Academy of Sciences, and the problem was referred to
Professor Rogers, president of the Academy, with the request to appoint
a commission of scientific experts to investigate the whole subject and
report to the Secretary of the Interior. No return has yet been made
by this commission, but it is understood that the matter is receiving
careful consideration.

UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION.

GENERAL OBJECTS AND RESULTS.

The relationship which your Secretary has borne for ten years to the
United States Fish Commission as its chief, and the time required for
the discharge of its responsibilities, makes it proper to furnish a brief
statement of the objects and results of the commission, as showing
thereby that its operations are quite in accordance with the purposes of
the Smithsonian Institution.

The inception of the commission, on a very small seale, in 1871, and
the rapid extension of its operations year by year, have all been chron-
icled in the annual reports of the Institution; and now that ten years
have elapsed, the reports of the commission will, I trust, show its
healthy growth and a successful accomplishment of some, at least, of
the objects which have been kept strictly in view from the outset.

As explained in previous reports, the commission was first established,
in 1871, for the purpose of investigating the alleged decrease of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. a

food-fishes of the country, and of inquiring as to the best methods of
remedying the decrease, should this be found to exist. It was not until
the second year, or 1872, that the responsible duty of increasing the
supply was added to the other functions of the commission.

In the preceding report of the Smithsonian Institution, for 1879, I
have stated at length the plans and objects of the commission, and to
this I refer for details. I may simply remark here that the division of
“inquiry” has been held to involve a complete investigation of and re-
port upon all the physical conditions of the waters of the United States,
and the nature, numbers, and general relationships of their inhabitants,
together with an account of the relationships of man to the same, in
the way of methods and appliances of the fisheries, and the history and
statistics of his labors.

The second division, that of propagation, of course includes the pro-
tection of the useful fishes and their multiplication, either by capturing
the fish and transferring them from one point to another, or by the pro-
cess of artificial impregnation of the eggs and the distribution of the
young.

The work of the inquiry is prosecuted, for the most part, directly un-
der my own supervision, from stations at different points along the sea-
coast, with a suitable number of assistants (volunteers for the most part)
for making the investigations referred to. The specimens collected are
placed in the hands of experts, by whom they are properly investigated
and monographed, and the results published, with suitable illustrations
in the Annual Reports of the Commission. The collections made, usually
in very large numbers, are worked up at the same time; the reserve col-
lection preserved in the National Museum, and the duplicates distributed
to the various educational establishments of the country, or exchanged
for objects desired by the Museum.

The propagation division is conducted either at some permanent sta-
tions, such as those of the salmon, whitefish, and carp, or in temporary
establishments, shifting their ground with the season, as is the case in
large part, with the shad stations.

During the past year two additional subjects have occupied the atten-
tion of the Commission; one, the preparation for the international dis-
play of the fisheries of the United States at Berlin; and the other, the
‘ontinuation of the census of the fisheries, undertaken in behalf of Gen-
eral Walker, Superintendent of the Census. Special details in regard to
these branches will be found elsewhere.

Newport was the station selected for the prosecution of the work of
inquiry into the fisheries in 1880, as representing a point between
two previous stations, Wood’s Holl and Noank. Since the year 1873 the
Commission has been indebted to the Navy Department for a steamer
with which to carry on its investigations. This year, however, it was
found possible to dispense, in large part, with extraneous aid, the Fish
74 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Haack,* the vessel referred to in a previous report, having been com-
pleted and ready for sea.

Her original purpose was that of a floating hatching establishment ;
but she was not completed until some time in July, or after the spring
hatching work was over. Her first service, therefore, was in the inquiry
division of the Commission. She is a vessel of 484 tons, and provided
with all the necessary conveniences for investigation, such as a power-
ful hoisting engine and the necessary dredging and trawling apparatus.
She proved adinirably adapted to the requirements of the occasion.

Het personnel was furnished by the Navy Department, under the law —
of Congress that directed that she be placed on the same footing as the
vessels of the Coast Survey, which gave her the officers and a crew, with
their subsistence, leaving to the Commission the running expenses, such
as the cost of coal, oil, water, ete. Lieut. Z. L. Tanner, who had been
in charge of the steamer Speedicell, at Provincetown, in 1879, was placed
in command by the Navy Department, with Mr. J. 8. Smith as mate,
Wn. B. Boggs as engineer, Geo. H. Reed as paymaster, and F. C. Van
Vliet as surgeon, and a crew of 27 men.

A large building, formerly used for the manufacture of shot, was
rented from Mr. John H. Griswold; an adjacent wharf, with a number of
buildings upon it, was also obtained for the service of the Commission.

As in previous years, the superintendence of the work connected with
the marine invertebrates was in charge of Professor Verrill, of Yale Col-
lege, assisted by J. H. Emerton as artist, Mr. Sanderson Smith of New
York, and Mr. B. F. Koons and EH. A. Andrews. Mr. Richard Rathbun
was an assistant of the Commission in the general work, and Mr. H. L.
Osborn and Frederic Gardiner had charge of the fishes during the ab-
sence in Alaska of Dr. T. H. Bean.

The census branch of the fisheries also had its quarters in the town.

My own office, those of the laboratory and of the census, and the res-
idence of Maj. T. B. Ferguson, assistant commissioner, were connected
by telephone, for the more convenient transaction of business.

I arrived in Newport with my party on the 9th of July, and was
joined by Professor Verrill a few days later. The steamer, however, did
not reach Newport until the 2d of August, and, owing to various causes,
did not get fairly at her work until about the 7th. The city wharf was
hired from the city of Newport, where she lay when in port. The work
was carried on with great zeal during the summer, and very important
discoveries, both scientific and practical, were made, especially in the
course of three visits to the Gulf Stream in September and October.
On these occasions, the vessel by starting in the evening at 6 o’clock,
and running out to a distance of about a hundred miles reached the Gulf
Stream, and explored it for a period of 12 to 14 hours, and returned to
port on the succeeding night. Tbe amount of life found along the west-

direction of the Light-House Board, and the immediate supervision of Mr. Copeland and Lieut. Z. L.

ern edge of the Gulf Stream was enormously rich; of mollusca, not less
than 175 different species were taken, forty being new to science.
Twenty new deep sea fishes, some of them of a remarkable character,
were secured. The most important observations, however, were those
in regard to the Tile fish (Lopholotilus chameleonticeps), to which refer-
ence was made in a previous report. The ascertained range of this fish
was ereatiy extended, showing the possibility of capturing it over a
wide area.

For the purpose of determining the ability to take this fish with an
ordinary fishing smack a Noank vessel was chartered for the trial. Ow-
ing to a threatening storm, however, the vessel was compelled to return,
and nothing was done beyond the capture on a small line of an enor-
mous sword-fish.

Mr. G. Brown Goode, who had represented the United States at the
Berlin Exhibition, returning, joined the party on the 17th of July and
was, for the most part, occupied in connection with the fishery census.

During the summer I visited Wood’s Holl in the Fish Hawk, for the
purpose of inquiring into the possibility of making a station at that
point, for the hatching of codfish.

The work of the Commission at Newport was closed, about the begin-
ning of October, and on the 7th of that month the Fish Hawk returned
to Wilmington for some additional apparatus, carrying a portion of the
collection to New Haven, by the way, for the use of Professor Verrill.
After taking on board further hatching apparatus, the steamer came
around to Washington, cruising along the edge of the Gulf Stream on
her route, and making additional collections of importance.

I left Newport with my party on the 8th of October, closing operations
for the season at that place.

The control of so well equipped a steamer as the Fish Hawk and the
severai visits to the Gulf Stream resulted in the acquisition of a large
amount of material, equal almost to the aggregate of all our preceding
seasons. This has been put in hand and will, as rapidly as possible, be
examined, the reserve series added to the collection of the National
Museum, and the remainder distributed as heretofore.

In the Report of the Institution for 1879 reference was made to the
operations of the Fish Commission in connection with the artificial propa-
gation of codfish at Gloucester, Mass. This work was continued into the
beginning of the year 1580 and a large number of fish hatched out and
liberated. ‘These have remained for a considerable time in the harbor of
Gloucester and its vicinity, and by their abundance and unusual ap-
pearance attracted much attention.

The work of cod hatching was again undertaken in the winter of 1851,
in the little harbor at Wood’s Holl, Massachusetts. Facilities were
granted by the Light-House Board at its depot; the machinery was erected
and everything in readiness for the work. The unusual severity of the
winter, however, which froze up the shores, rendered it impossible to
76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

keep the fish in their pens, aud prevented any measure of success. It
is hoped that during normal seasons the propagation of the cod may be
considered as a perfectly feasible undertaking, and one promising im-
portant economical results.

The operations of the Commission in connection with the hatching of
shad have also been of increasing importance during the year. The
work was commenced in Albemarle Sound, North Carolina, and many
millions of fish were hatched out. A station was then established on
the Potomac River. By the courtesy of the authorities of the Navy
Department, and especially of the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and
Docks, a hatching station was extemporized for hatching out the eggs
of the shad obtained by the steamer Lookout from the seines and gilling
stations down the Potomae, especially in the vicinity of Fort Washington.

Another station was made at Havre de Grace, Maryland, and at the
two places about 30,000,000 shad were successfully hatched out. A
large proportion of these were necessarily placed in the rivers whence
the eggs were obtained. Many millions, however, were distributed by
the messengers of the Commission to various localities throughout the
United States, especially to the waters of the Mississippi Valley.

The propagation of the Salmonide@ has also been conducted with sat-
isfactory results. The McCloud River station, for the cultivation of the
California or Quinnat salmon, was in successful operation, and furnished
many millions uf eggs, which were distributed, as usual, to all parts of
the United States. Some of these eggs went to Germany, France, and
Holland, where they arrived in good condition, and were hatched out
very satisfactorily.

After an interval of several years, work was resumed at the station
on the Penobscot River for obtaining the eggs of the Penobscot salmon,
and a distribution of these fish was made to the principal rivers of the
Northern and Eastern States.

An unusually large gathering of eggs of the land-locked salmon was
made at the station on Grand Lake Stream, this fish promising to be of
great value in the cold, deep lakes of the country.

Work on a large scale in connection with the white-fish of the great
lakes was commenced this year by establishing a station at Northvilke,
Michigan, under the charge of Mr. Frank N. Clark. With the neces-
sary number of assistants, Superintendent Clark obtained a bountiful
supply of eggs in the adjacent lakes, and gathered into the hatching-
house about 13,000,000. Some of these were distributed to different
parts of the country; but by far the greater part were hatched out and
placed partly in Lake Michigan, partly in Lake Huron, and partly in
Detroit River.

An interesting experiment was made in the artificial propagation of
the striped bass or rock-fish of the Southern States—the eggs from a
gravid female having been properly impregnated, a large number of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Fc

young were hatched out. This experiment, it is hoped, will be contin-
ued in future years on a much larger scale.

Perhaps the most important result of the work of the Commission in
the line of the propagation of fish is that of the multiplication and dis-
tribution of the imported German carp, of which, as already explained,
there are three principal varieties—the scale, leather, and mirror carp.
The distribution of the young of these fish was commenced in the au-
tumn of 187). A very large yield in 1880 permitted them to be sent to
a great many applicants throughout the country, some thousands in
number. The demand, however, is increasing, and is likely, for some
time, to more than keep pace with the supply. It is gratifying to know
that the efforts of the Commission to introduce this fish meet with favor-
able recognition.

An account of the operations of the United States Fish Commission
during the first decade of its existence, detailing somewhat fully its
plan of work, and the scientific and economical results accomplished by
it, was prepared by Mr. G. Brown Goode, and read before the American
Association for the Advancement of Science at its Boston meeting, held
August 28,1880. This paper will be found in full in the appendix to this
report.

FISHERY CENSUS OF 1880.

In July, 1880, an arrangement was made with General Francis A.
Walker, Superintendent of the Tenth Census, by which an investiga-
tion of the fisheries of the United States was undertaken as the joint
enterprise of the United States Fish Commission and of the Census
Bureau. It was decided that this investigation should be as complete
as possible, and that both the United States Fish Commission and the
Census Bureau should participate in its results. The preparation of a
Statistical and historical report upon the fisheries, to form one of the
series to be presented by the Superintendent of the Census as the re-
sult of his investigations in 1359, has been the main object of the work ;
but in connection with this statistical work, extensive investigation
into the methods of the fisheries, into the distribution of the fishing-
grounds, and the natural history of useful marine animals, has been
and is being carried on.

The direction of this investigation has been placed in the hands of Mr.
G. Brown Goode, who was appointed agent of the Census Office, and
who has been carrying on this work in addition to the performance of his
duties in connection with the National Museum. The work which was
begun on July 1, 1879, has been vigorously prosecuted since that time,
and the final report will probably be presented as early as July, 1881.

The plan of the investigation was drawn up before the beginning of
the work and has been published in an octavo pamphlet of 54 pages,
entitled “ Plan of Inquiry into the History and Present Condition of the
Fisheries of the United States.” Washington: Government Printing
Office. 1879.
78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

The scheme of investigation divided the work into the following
departments :

I. Natural history of marine products: Under this head was to be ear-
ried on the study of the useful aquatic animals and plants of the coun-
try, as well as of seals, whales, turtles, fishes, lobsters, crabs, oysters,
clams, &c., sponges and marine plants and inorganic products of the
sea, with reference to geographical distribution; size; abundance; mi-
grations and movements; food and rate of growth; mode of repro-
duction ; economic value and uses.

Il. The fishing-grounds : Under this head are studied the geographical
distribution of all animals sought by fishermen and the location of the
fishing-grounds, while with reference to the latter are considered: loca-
tion; topography; depth of water; character of bottom; temperature of
water; currents; character of invertebrate life, &c.

Ill. The fishermen and fishing towns: Here are considered the coast
districts engaged in the fisheries with reference to their relation to the
fisheries, historically and statistically, and the social, vital, and other
statistics relating to the fishermen.

IV. Apparatus and methods of capture: Here are considered all the
forms of apparatus used by fishermen, boats, nets, traps, harpoons, Xc.,
and the methods employed in the various branches of the fishery. Here
each special kind of fishery, of which there are more than fifty in the
United States, is considered separately, with regard to its methods, its
history, and its statistics.

V. Products of fisheries: Under this head are studied the statistics
of the yield of American fisheries, past and present.

VI. Preparation, care of, and manufacture of fishery products: Here
are considered the methods and thev arious devices for utilizing fish
after they are caught, with statistics of capital and men employed, We.:
preservation of live fish; refrigeration; sun-drying; smoke-drying; pick-
ling; hermetically canning; fur dressing; whalebone preparation; isin-
glass manufacture; ambergris manufacture; fish-guano manufacture;
oil rendering, We.

VII. Economy of the fisheries: Here are studied financial organization
and methods; insurance; labor and capital; markets and market prices;
lines of traffic; exports, imports, and duties.

VIII. Protection and culture: This includes all kinds of supervision
by the government, such as legislation; bounties and licenses; fishery
treaties; public fish culture. .

The various inquiries provided for in this scheme of investigation
have been made in three ways.

First. By correspondence with persons in different parts of the country.

Second. By a systematic overhauling and compilation of past records,
not the least among which are the local newspapers.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 79

Third. By sending special agents to make personal inquiries in
every part of the United States where the fisheries are of considerable
importance.

The last-named method has of course been by far the most important
and the most successful, and it is unfortunate that the length of time
and the amount of money available have not permitted the employment
of a larger number of assistants in this branch of the work, and have
not allowed them to devote as much attention to working out specific
questions as has in many cases seemed imperatively necessary.

The fishery industry is of such great importance and is undergoing
such constant changes that a visit of a few days, even by the most com-
petent experts, has invariably proved unsatisfactory. They have been
able to collect only the more important facts, leaving mavy subjects of
interest untouched.

The field work has been carried on by the following special agents:
(1.) Coast of Maine, east of Portland, R. E. Earll and Capt. J. W. Col-
lins. (2.) Portland to Plymouth (except Cape Ann) and eastern side of
Buzzard’s Bay, W. A. Wilcox. (3.) Cape Ann, A. Howard Clark. (4.)
Cape Cod, F. W. True. (5.) Provincetown, Capt. N. EH. Atwood. (6.)
Rhode Island and Connecticut, west to the Connecticut River, Ludwig
Kunlien. (7.) Long Island and north shore of Long Island Sound and
west to Sandy Hook, Fred. Mather. (8.) New York City, Barnet Phil-
lips. (9.) Coast of New Jersey, R. EB. Earll. (10.) Philadelphia, C. W.
Smiley and W. V. Cox. (11.) Coast of Delaware, Capt. J. W. Collins.
(12.) Baltimore and the oyster industry of Maryland, kh. Uf. Edmunds.
(13.) Atlantic coast of Southern States, R. E. Harll. (14.) Gulf Coast,
Silas Stearns. (15.) Coast of California, Oregon, and Washington, Prof.
D.S. Jordan and C. H. Gilbert. (16.) Puget Sound, James G. Swan.
(17.) Alaska seal fisheries, Dr. T. H. Bean. (18.) Great Lakes fishery,
Ludwig Kumlien. (19.) River fisheries of Maine, C. G. Atkins. (20.)
The shad and alewife fisheries, Col. Marshall McDonald. -(21.) Oyster
fisheries, Ernest Ingersoll. (22.) Lobster and crab fisheries, Richard

xathbun. (23.) Turtle and terrapin fisheries, F. W. True. (24,) The
seal, sea elephant, and whale fisheries, A. Howard Clark.

In addition to the field assistants already mentioned, a staff of assist-
ants from the beginning have been at work in the office of the division,
carrying on correspondence, searching past records, and preparing the
report for publication. Mr. C. W. Smiley, Mr. Jas. Temple Brown, and
Mr. George 8. Hobbs have been connected with the work from its start,
and from a later date Mr. J. E. Rockwell, Mr. C. W. Seudder, Mr. R. I.
Geare, Mr. G. P. Merrill and others have been thus employed. A num-
ber of clerks have also been detailed for this work by the Superintendent
of the Census, at one time as many as eight. A large part of the clerical
force is under the direction of Mr. C. W. Smiley, who has in special
charge the correspondence and the statistical and compiling work.

Mr. William H. Dall, of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey,
80 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

a

was detailed by the Superintendent, Captain Patterson, to visit Alaska
and the Arctic Ocean, for the purpose of obtaining information in re-
gard to the Alaska coast, a work upon which Mr. Dall has been engaged
for many years. Permission for Dr. Bean to accompany Mr. Dall was
readily obtained from Captain Patterson, and the voyage from San
Francisco was made in the schooner Yukon, of the Coast Survey, a ves-
sel originally built under Mr. Dall’s direction for service in the Alaskan
waters.

Mr. William J. Fisher, tidal observer at Kodiak, also contributed im-
portant material of the same general character. As the result of these
several explorations, over one hundred boxes and packages of natural
history collections have been received by the Institution, all more or
less incidental to the census inquiries made by the same parties.

One of the most important reports of Dr. Bean’s investigations was
the discovery that cod and halibut of the Alaskan waters were identical
with the same species as those in the North Atlantic, and consequently
all the conditions of pursuit and preservation used in the east could be
employed appropriately in the western seas.

BERLIN INTERNATIONAL FISHERY EXHIBITION.

Among recent organizations in Europe for the purpose of developing
home industries, one of the most important is the Deutsche Fischeret-
Verein, founded in 1871, for the purpose of developing the fisheries
of Germany, both inland and maritime, and of introducing improved
methods of fish culture and new varieties of fishes. The organization
is composed of some of the most eminent naturalists and pisciculturists
of Germany, and also includes many personages of the highest rank in
the empire who are most interested in the welfare of the State.

Tor the purpose of bringing together a display illustrating the meth-
ods and results of the fisheries and fish culture of the Old World, ar-
rangements were made for holding an international fisheries exhibition
in Berlin in the spring of 1880, and invitations were issued about
eighteen months before, asking the co-operation of governments, asso-
ciations, and persons interested generally. The invitation to the United
States to participate was transmitted to the Secretary of State in the
winter of 1878~79, but no action was taken by Congress. This was a
source of great regret to the German Government, as well as to the
immediate promoters of the enterprise, and urgent appeals were made
through the German and American ministers for action. A second
communication made by the Secretary of State about the beginning of
1880 was more successful, a bill introduced by Mr. Deuster, member of
the House from Michigan, being readily passed, appropriating $20,000
to enable the United States Fish Commission to make the exhibition on
the part of the United States.

I was called to appear before the Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations on the 10th of February, and explained the proposed display,
i

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 81

and gave some reasons why it would be to the interest of the United
States to participate in it. The Senate committee reporting favorably,
the bill became a law, and appropriations were inade to carry out its
provisions.

My duties in connection with the Smithsonian Institution, the Na-
tional Museum, and the Fish Commission made it impossible for me to
attend the exhibition, and Mr. G. Brown Goode, the curator of the
Museum, was appointed as the commissioner in charge, and immediate
preparations were commenced for the occasion.

Of course the time for preparation was very short, as the exhibition
was to be opened on the 20th of April, giving nearly eighteen months
less time than that enjoyed for the purpose by most of the other par-
ticipants. Fortunately, however, the components of the exhibition of
the fishery and fish-cultural interests of the United States made at the
International Exhibition of 1876 at Philadelphia were available for the
purpose, and a selection from these was made by Mr. Goode, with the
assistance of Mr. True, and invitations for contributions of later mate-
rial were promptly responded to. The most important possible addi-
tions to the display of 1876 consisted in. the improved apparatus for fish
culture, and in the samples of preparations of prepared fish, both hav-
ing made vast progress during the intervening four years.

The United States Fish Commission proposed to display, either in
original apparatus or in models, the new methods of hatching fish with
the assistance of steam power, as devised by Mr. T. B. Ferguson, of the
Fish Commission, and especially to show the model of the new fish-
hatching steamer Fish Hawk, to be used as a floating hatching estab-
lishment in the propagation of shad and other useful fishes. The model
of the new vessel was on a scale of about half an inch to the foot, and
that of the fish-hatching apparatus on a scale of one-sixth the actual
size. An enormous number and variety of samples of mackerel, cod,
smelts, crabs, oysters, lobsters, and other marine products were sup-
plied in the different forms of dried, powdered, salted, smoked, and
canned, either in oil or in spices. Certain firms were invited to furnish
their special apparatus for the capture of fish, and no time was lost in
making use of the short interval remaining. This work was carried on
so successfully under Mr. Goode’s administration that it became possible
to ship a first load, of some thousands of cubic feet, on the 28th of Feb-
ruary, the last of the lot being transmitted on the 24th of March. The
total amount of freight thus sent forward consisted of about 12,000
cubic feet.

With most commendable liberality, the North German Lloyd Co., at
the suggestion of its agents in New York, Messrs. Oelrichs & Co., agreed
to transmit and return all the packages of the Commission free; and
not to be behind a foreign corporation in this spirit, the great lines of
roads between Washington and Baltimore and New York, namely, the
Baltimore and Ohio, the Baltimore and Potomac, the Philadelphia, Wil-

mington and Baltimore, and the Pennsylvania, agreed likewise to carry
the packages free. The greater part of the exhibit of the United States
was shipped from Baltimore by the Bremen steamers, although most
of the packages concentrated at New York were embarked from that
city, as also Mr. Goode’s immediate staff, consisting of Mr. IF. W. True
and Mr. J. EK. Rockwell of his office force, with Mr. Fred Mather, expert
n fish culture, Capt. J. W. Collins, expert in fisheries, and Mr. Joseph Pal-
mer in charge of the models and casts. Mr. Goode left Washington on
the 16th of March and sailed in the Bremen steamer Neckar on the 20th,
the company granting a concession of one-fourth of the fare.

A large portion of the goods were found in Bremen on the arrival ot
the party, and these were sent forward to Berlin and unpacked in time
for very satisfactory opening of the Exhibition on the 20th of April.
Some smaller collections, sent at a later date, were received subsequently.
A large amount of space had been assigned to the United States, but
this being inadequate a portion of that granted to Great Britain, and
not occupied by her exhibitors, was added. The section of the United
States was ornamented by a large number of flags lent for the purpose
by the Navy and War Departments, and the display as a whole was very
effective.

It is now a matter of history that the United States bore off the chief
honors of the occasion, the superlatives of the critics being exhausted
in their praises of its method, richness, and great intrinsic value. Indeed
the entire collection of the remaining portion of the International Hx-

hibit of Fish and Fisheries would not have made a single exhibit ¢°

anything like the importance of that of the United States. In illustration
of this fact it may be stated that the grand prize given by the Emperor
of Germany to the Exhibition, for the best display, was awarded to the
United States. This consisted of a large vase, three feet high, beauti-
fully worked in silver and gold, and costing over $2,000. In addition
to the grand prize there were numerous other awards in the way of
medals of gold, silver, and bronze to contributors from this country, and
the number of these awards would have been much greater but for the
fact that the greater part of these contributions were made as part of that
of the United States Fish Commission. The same policy was pursued
there as at the Philadelphia exhibition; where objects were presented
to the Institution and to the United States, they were entered for special
consideration as individual exhibits; but where they were purchased for
the exhibition they became the property of the United States, and their
individuality was lost in the general display. Many persons who pre-
ferred to receive the comparatively slight money-value of the objects ob-
tained from them, were greatly disappointed on finding that, however
meritorious, their articles were passed over by the judges and no awards
made for them.

It was originally supposed that the exhibition would close on the 1st
of June, after a six weeks’ display. Very much interest, however, was
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 83

felt in the display, and it was so much more successful than had been
expected that it was concluded to keep it over until the 1st of July.
This involved an additional four weeks’ detention of the party, and of
course increased the expense. Thanks, however, to Mr. Goode’s careful
administration, I am happy to say that the work was finished and all
the exhibits returned to Washington within the appropriation, a few
dollars having been paid into the Treasury as the surplus. Owing to
the care with which the articles were packed, everything arrived in per-
fect condition at its destination; indeed, out of the large number of
plaster casts very few required any treatment for their proper exhibition.
This was in marked contrast to the experience of the British portion of
the exhibit, which, although it was much smaller in extent, was almost
utterly destroyed in transit.

Acting under his instructions, Mr. Goode disposed of some of the more
bulky and least costly articles, such as the whale boat and a number of
the dories, &c., to various governments and other establishments in ex-
change for desired objects belonging to the European divisions. This
somewhat reduced the bulk of the shipment, but not very greatly. The
entire lot of at least 10,000 cubic feet was brought by a single vessel of
the German Lloyds line from Bremen to Baltimore, and thence by the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and placed in the new National Museum
Building. The exhibition will be more fully discussed in a report now
being prepared, which in accordance with the resolutions of Congress
will also treat of the present condition of the fisheries and fish-culture
of Europe.

Respectfully submitted.
SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary of Smithsonian Institution.

RULES FOR THE EXAMINATION OF SPECIMENS SUBMITTED
TO THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

1. Qualitative examinations—that is, for determining the constituents
of the specimens—are made without charge.

2. Quantitative examinations, or the determination of the percentage of
the different components of the specimens, can only be made at the
expense of the applicant; the charge to be in proportion to the time
expended in the work, e. g., from $5 to $50, according to whether it is
partial (determination of silver, lead, or iron, &e., see or full (deter-
mination of everything).

3. The report of quantitative examinations will be given under the
name of the expert to whom the specimens shall be submitted, and not
under that of the Smithsonian Institution.

4, All applications for the determination of specimens must be made
by letter, addressed “Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.”

5. The specimens examined, or a part of them, will be retained by the
Institution.

6. All specimens to be delivered to the Institution free of expense.

SPENCER F. BArrRD,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution.

REPORT OF FRED. W. TAYLOR,
Chemist of the Smithsonian Institution.

The present chemist entered upon his duties the latter part of Janu-
ary, 1880, taking charge of the laboratory and mineralogical department
during the absence of Dr. Endlich, and has continued to perform the
duties of his office since that time. The laboratory was found to be in
comparatively good order, though the steck of apparatus and chemicals
was extremely limited. By slow additions the stock of both has been
largely increased, until now the laboratory may be said to be compara-
tively well supplied for all branches of inorganic work. As yet no pro-
vision has been made for organic work, and no such work has been
attempted, as, in addition to the lack of apparatus, the arrangement
and fitting of the laboratory render such work almost impossible. As
stated in the last annual report, the work of the laboratory consists
in the determination of various minerals sent in to the Institution
for identification, and in the investigation of such questions as may be
referred to it by the departments. No other work is attempted by the
Institution, though the chemist is kindly permitted to undertake other
work on his own account. Since February 1, 1880, the chemist has made
108 APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

about one hundred and twenty qualitative reports to the Institution on
specimens received, identifying nearly three times that number of spe-
cimens; also some fifteen quantitative reports. He regrets, however,
that nearly ninety per cent. of the specimens received by the Institu-
tion are entirely worthless, owing to the small size of specimens, and to
the partiality of senders to the sulphide of iron (Pyrite) and to the sul-
phide of iron and copper (Chaleopyrite). This unfortunate fact has
prevented the chemist fyom making any considerable addition to the
collection, or to the supply of duplicates. The cases in the mineral hall
have, however, been refitted and put in order without change in the
system followed by Dr. Endlich, and the few valuable specimens that
have been received, where space would not permit their exhibition, have
been temporarily stored in the drawers under the cases. Among the
specimens of value received may be mentioned specimens of amalgam,
crude bullion, and fine silver from Montana, received from Mr. Thos. Don-
aldson; a small but handsome collection of minerals from Mr. Geo. F.
Kunz, of New York; some fine specimens of native copper, contributed
by Dr. Reynolds; and alarge number of specimens of the gold and silver
ores of the West, from the surveyors-general of the Western States. Here
let me enter a respectful protest against the method of collecting these
speciwens. I should not say method, however, as my protest is against
the apparent want of any method or system whatever. As received the
specimens are of every size and shape, from a mere chip to a piece of
three inches cube, some labeled or numbered, some not. I would sug-
gest that each contributor of such specimens be requested to send pieces
of something like the same size, say 4” x 6” x 2”; that each specimen
be sent in duplicate, and that in all cases an invoice of specimens be
sent both with the letter of transmittal and also inclosed with the spe-
cimens. We would then have a fair collection of these ores instead .of
the present supply of chips, many of them broken from the weathered
outcrop of the ledge or vein which they are intended to represent.
Another collection received has been one of the gold, silver, and copper
ores of Alaska, from Com. L. A. Beardslee; a collection of iron, lead,
and copper ores of South Africa, from Mr. Geo. D. Sidman. Mr. F. A.
Lowe has contributed a fine specimen of Ammikite and one of Huntilite,
the two new silver islet minerals, the first containing eighty per cent. of
silver, also a small specimen of Macfarlanite. Though the chemist has
not as yet completed any sets of duplicates for distribution, he has sent
off several sets that were packed by Dr. Endlich, and has under way
some fifteen or twenty more sets for that purpose.

These sets will contain not only minerals, but also a certain number
of lithological and geological specimens, the aim being to furnish a set
of characteristic minerals and ores for class teaching. Among the ques-
tions referred to the Institution by the departments was that of the
utility of the Tichnor process for the extraction of gold from its ores,
referred by the Patent Office. This investigation was a most tedious
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 109

and laborious one, involving many weighings of a deliquescent sub-
stance, which had to be done with the greatest rapidity, and at the
same time with accuracy; also the making of some fifty careful assays,
giving the chemist nearly a month of hard and dirty work. Another
question referred to the chemist through Mr. Rhees, of the Institution,
was the character of the coloring matter used on the small squares of
paper given to the children in the Kindergarten schools of the District
and elsewhere. This paper is a thin paper, colored and glazed on one
side (in most cases), cut into five-inch squares, and is given to the chil-
dren to cut up and fashion into various patterns.

The chemist regrets that he has not been able to find time to make
more than a brief qualitative examination of the subject. Highteen
samples of paper were tested for arsenic, and out of that number six
samples were found to contain a large amount of arsenic in different
forms, probably the most dangerous being a bright green paper, the
coloring matter being the brilliant but deadly Scheele’s green. The
other colors found to contain arsenic were purple, solferino, navy blue,
carmine red, and vermillion red. Another investigation undertaken by
the chemist for prominent private parties was a thorough testing of the
so-called Robertson electric process for the reduction of gold ores. This
process, like the Tichnor, is utterly at variance with accepted ideas of
chemists and metallurgists, and the investigation showed similar results
to the Tichnor in proving itrof little value. In addition to these inves-
tigations the chemist has undertaken numerous analyses and assays for
private parties of no particular chemical interest. The time of the chem-
ist has of late been entirely occupied in overhauling and recording the
vast amount of reserve material stored in the Institution, the object
being to make a complete record of duplicates and reserves and to elimi-
nate all worthless material and make room for new contributions.

REPORT OF EXPLORATIONS IN NEW MEXICO AND ARI-
. ZONA, BY JAMES STEVENSON.

Professor S. F. BAIRD:

DEAR Sie: I have the honor to present you herewith a brief state-
ment of the explorations made by the party under my charge during
last summer; giving, for the present, only an outline of the country
traversed and the aggregate results accomplished.

The party arrived at Santa Fé, New Mexico, about the first of Sep-
tember last, where a few days were spent in arranging details for the
prosecution of the field work.

From Santa Fé the party traveled direct to the pueblo of Taos, by
way of the Rio Grande. At Taos about a week was spent in making
collections; many sketches were made, representing picture-writing on
the interior of the dwellings and estufas. Quite a number of photo-
graphic illustrations were made, showing the entire outlines of the vil-
lage, including many details of its structure, sufficiently to construct a
model. Portraits were also taken of the principal individuals of the
pueblo.

From Taos the party proceeded southward to the pueblo of San Juan.
From San Juan to Santa Clara, from Santa Clara to San Ildefonso,
from there to Nambe, thence back to Santa i’é. A few days more were
spent at the latter place in obtaining supplies for future work. We
again proceeded southward to the pueblo of Cochiti, which is situated
on the west bank of the Rio Grande, about 30 miles from Santa Fé.
The party spent several days at this place making collections, photo-
graphic and other illustrations. From Cochiti we traveled westward
about 50 miles to the pueblo of Jemez, situated near the sources of the
Rio Jemez. At this village some days were spent in making collec-
tions, photographs, &c. From Jemez we followed up the Rio Jemez to
the Hot Springs, near which we found several large ruins, both Indian
and Spanish. Many views were made of the ruins, as well as a collee-
tion of pottery fragments, stone implements, &e. From Jemez our
course was south, following the Jemez River. About ten miles below
Jemez we found the pueblo of Silla, or Sia; here, too, a collection was
made, and some photographs. Continuing down the river some miles,
we reached the pueblo of Sunta Ana. This pueblo we found to be much
larger than any we had visited, except, perhaps, Taos. Our investiga-
tions at this pueblo were as full and complete as those made at the
other pueblos. From Santa Ana we continued south, crossing the
Rio Grande, to the pueblo of Sandia. At this village a full collection
was made and an ample number of photographic illustrations to con-
vey the fullest impression of the pueblo. From Sandia we moved on
to Santo Domingo. This pueblo is located on the east bank of the Rio
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 137

Grande, and between that and the line of the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fé Railroad. We also made a complete collection of pot-
tery, &e., at this point. From here we continued our journey up the
Rio Grande to the pueblo of San Feélipé. Here we also spent several
days making illustrations and collections. We then returned to Santa Fé,
from where a special trip was made, via the railway, to the pueblo of
Isleta. At each of the pueblos a sufficient time was taken to make
investigations of all kinds in relation to the inhabitants, and to make a
full typical collection of all their utensils, fabrics, &c., illustrating their
industries, We.

There are very many details and specimens of special interest which
can only be presented after an examination of the sketches, photo-
graphs, and specimens.

The object of greatest interest to the party was the discovery of a
class of ruins occupying a large area of country about 45 miles west of
Santa Fé, and lying around the base of the Jemez Mountains, and be-
tween these mountains and the Rio Grande. These ruins extend in a
semicircular manner from near Ildefonso around to the sources of the
Rio Jemez, and are in depth from 3 to 15 miles. The houses are ex-
cavated in the faces of perpendicular bluffs composed of a soft volcanic
tufa, very much resembling pumice stone; each blufi is shaped in its
outlines somewhat like a horseshoe, the whole being situated in series,
facing the river, and receding back from it, one above the other, toward
the Jemez Mountains. The accompanying pencil sketches, by Mr. F.
G. Galbraith, and one of the photographs will convey an impression of
their appearance. From these ruins a large quantity of stone imple-
ments were collected.

One other locality which came within view of the party, but which
was not examined for want of time, will prove of much interest. The
locality referred to is on either side of the Upper Jemez River, which
is bordered by numerous mesas from four to fifteen hundred feet in
height, and much broken or cut up by canons which have in many
instances separated the mesas from.each other. Located on the sum-
mits of these mesas we found twenty-seven villages in ruins, which we
could only see with our glasses from the summit of a high mountain.
The mesas on which these ruins are situated are so high and difficult
of access that many days would be required to explore a single one
of them.

In summing up the results of the work for the season, I can do no
more than to give a list of the collections and illustrations made.

Photographs.—Twenty-two 11x14 views representing the pueblos of
Taos, San Juan, Santa Clara, San Ildefonso, Pojanquiti, Tesuque,
Nambe, Cochiti, Jemez, Jemez Ruins, Silla or Zia, Santa Ana, Sandia,
Isleta, Santo Domingo, San Félipé, and Picoris. Twenty-one 5x10
portraits, embracing the governors and other principal persons of the
Pueblo tribes visited.
138 APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Specimens.—Two thousand eight hundred specimens, embracing pot-
tery, pestles, mortars, baking stones, grinders, polishing stones, drills,
axes, spears, arrow-heads, scrapers, adzes, We. _ Fabrics, such as blank-
ets, waistlets, anklets, leggins, dresses, head-dresses, &c. Also, toys,
bird-traps, spindle-whorls, gaming-stones, cart and plow, and many other
objects too numerous to specify.

Hoping this brief statement may serve your purposes for the time
being,

IT am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JAMES STEVENSON.

140 APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

THE FIRST DECADE OF THE UNITED STATES FISH COM-
MISSION: ITS PLAN OF WORK AND ACCOMPLISHED RE-
SULTS, SCIENTIFIC AND ECONOMICAL.

By G. BRowN GOODE.*

There are nine departments of the government devoted, in part or
wholly, to researches in pure and applied science—the Geological Sur-
vey; the Coast and Geodetic Survey; the Naval Observatory; the
National Museum; the Department of Agriculture; the Entomological
Commission; the Tenth Census, with its special agencies for the study
of the natural resources of the country; the Smithsonian Bureau of Eth-
nology, and the Commission of Fish and Fisheries. The Smithsonian
Institution, established upon an independent foundation, should also be
mentioned, as well as the Medical Museum of the Army, and the various
laboratories under the control of the Army and Navy Departments.

The Geological Survey is not now carrying on any of the schemes of
zoological and botanical investigation engaged in by its predecessors.

The work of the Entomological Commission and that of the census,
though of extreme importance, are limited in scope and duration, while
that of the Agricultural Department is necessarily, for the most part,
economical.

The work of the National Museum is chiefly confined to the study of
collections made by government surveys or individual collectors and sent
in to be reported upon.

The work of the Fish Commission, in one of its aspects, may perhaps
be regarded as the most prominent of the present efforts of the govern-
ment in aid of aggressive biological research.

On the 9th of February, 1871, Congress passed a joint resolution which
authorized the appointment of a Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries.
The duties of the Commissioner were thus defined: ‘To prosecute investi-
gations on the subject (of the diminution of valuable fishes) with the view
of ascertaining whether any and what diminution in the number of the
food-fishes of the coast and the lakes of the United States has taken
place; and, if so, to what causes the same is due; and also whether any
and what protective, prohibitory or precautionary measures should be
adopted in the premises, and to report upon the same to Congress.”

The resolution establishing the office of Commissioner of Fisheries
required that the person to be appointed should be a civil officer of the
government, of proved scientific and practical acquaintance with the

« [From the PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE, Vol.
xxix, Boston Meeting, August, 1880.] °

APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 141

fishes of the coast, to serve without additional salary. The choice was
thus practically limited to a single man for whom, in fact, the office had
been created. Professor Baird, at that time Assistant Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, was appointed and entered at once upon his
duties.

The summer of 1880 marks the tenth season of active work since its
inception in 1871. The Fish Commission now fills a place ten-fold more
extensive and useful than at first. The present essay aims to show, in
a general way, what it has done, is doing, and expects to do—its pur-
poses, its methods, its results.

The work is naturally divided into three sections:

1. The systematic investigation of the waters of the United States
and the biological and physical problems which they present. The sci-
entific studies of the Commission are based upon a liberal and philo-
sophical interpretation of the law. In making his original plans the
Commissioner insisted that to study only the food-fishes would be of
little importance, and that useful conclusions must needs rest upon a
broad foundation of investigations purely scientific in character. The
life history of species of economic value should be understood from be-
ginning to end, but no less requisite is it to know the histories of the
animals and plants upon which they feed or upon which their food is
nourished; the histories of their enemies and friends, and the friends
ard foes of their enemies and friends, as well as the currents, tempera-
tures, and other physical phenomena of the waters in relation to migra-
tion, reproduction, and growth. A necessary accompaniment to this
division is the amassing of material for research to be stored in the Na-
tional and other museums for future use.

2. The investigation of the methods of fisheries, past and present,
and the statistics of production and commerce of fishery products. Man
being one of the chief destroyers of fish, his influence upon their abun-
dance must be studied. Fishery methods and apparatus must be exam-
ined and compared with those of other lands, that the use of those which
threaten the destruction of useful fishes may be discouraged, and that
those which are inefficient may be replaced by others more serviceable.
Statistics of industry and trade must be secured for the use of Congress
in making treaties or imposing tariffs, to show to producers the best
markets, and to consumers where and with what their needs may be
supplied.

3. The introduction and multiplication of useful food-fishes through-
out the country, especially in waters under the jurisdiction of the gen-
eral government, or those common to several States, none of which
might feel willing to make expenditures for the benefit of the others.
This work, which was not contemplated when the Commission was
established, was first undertaken at the instance of the American Fish
Cultural Association, whose representatives induced Congress to make
a special appropriation for the purpose. This appropriation has since
142 APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

been renewed every year on a more bountiful scale, and the propagation
of fish is at present by far the most extensive branch of the work of the
Commission, both in respect to number of men employed and quantity
of money expended.

Although activity in this direction may be regarded in the light of
applied rather than pure scientific work, it is particularly important to
the biologist, since it affords opportunities for investigating many new
problems in physiology and embryology.

The origin of the Commission, its purposes, and methods of organiza-
tion having been described, it now remains to review the accomplished
results of its work. In many departments, especially that of direct
research, most efficient services have been rendered by volunteers; in
fact, a large share of what has been accomplished in biological and
physical exploration is the result of unpaid labor on the part of some of
the most skillful American specialists. Although it would be interest-
ing to review the peculiar features of the work of each investigator, the
limits of this paper will not alld even a mention of them all by name.

Since the important fisheries center in New England, the coast of
this district has been the seat of the most active operations in marine
research. For ten years the Commissioner, with a party of specialists,
has devoted the summer season to work at the shore at various stations
along the coast, from Connecticut to Nova Scotia.

A suitable place having been selected, a temporary laboratory is fitted
up with the necessary appliances for collection and study. In this are
placed from ten to twenty tables, each occupied by an investigator,
either an officer of the Commission or a volunteer. From 1578 to 1879
important aid was rendered by the Secretary of the Navy, who detailed
for this service a steamer to be used in dredging and trawling, and this
year the steamer built expressly for the Commission is employed in the
same manner.*

The regular routine of operations at a summer station ineludes all the
various forms of activity known to naturalists—collecting along the
shore, seining upon the beaches,} setting traps for animals not otherwise
to be obtained, and scraping with dredge and trawl the bottom of the
sea at depths as great as can be reached by a steamer in a trip of three

*The number of dredging and trawling stations on record is as follows:

days. In the laboratory are carried on the usual structural and system-
atic studies; the preparation of museum specimens and of reports.
Since the organization of the Commission the deep-sea work and the
investigation of invertebrate animals has been under the charge of Pro-
fessor Verrill, who had for many years before the Commission was
established been studying independently the invertebrate fauna of New
England.

In addition to what has been done at the summer station, more or less
exhaustive investigations have been carried on by smaller parties on
many parts of the coast and interior waters. The fauna of the Grand
Banks and other off-shore fishing grounds has been partly explored.
In 1872, 1875, and 1874 dredging was carried on from the Coast Survey
steamer Bache by Professor Packard and Mr. Cooke, Professor Smith,
Mr. Harger, and Mr. Rathbun. In 1879 Mr. H. L. Osborne spent three
months in a cod-schooner collecting material on the Grand Banks, and
Mr. N. P. Scudder as long a time on the halibut grounds of Davis’
Straits. 8

A most remarkable series of contributions has been received fiom
the fishermen of Cape Ann. When the Fish Commission had its head-
quarters at Gloucester in 1878 a general interest in the zoological work
sprang up among the crews of the fishing vessels, and since that time
they have been vying with each other in efforts to find new animals.
Their activity has been stimulated by the publication of lists of their
donations in the local papers, and the number of separate lots of speci-
mens received to the present time exceeds eight hundred. Many of
these lots are large, consisting of collecting-tanks full of alcoholic speci-
mens. At least thirty fishing vessels now carry collecting-tanks on
every trip, and many of the fishermen, with characteristic superstition,
have the idea that it insures good luck to have a tank on board, and
will not go to sea without one. The number of specimens acquired in
this manner is at least fifty or sixty thousand, most of them belonging
to species unattainable. Hach halibut vessel sets, twice daily, lines
from ten to fourteen miles in length, with hooks upon them six feet apart,
in water twelve hundred to eighteen hundred feet in depth; and the
quantity of living forms brought up in this manner, and which had never
hitherto been saved, is very astonishing. Over thirty species of fishes
have thus been added to the fauna of North America, and Protessor
Verrill informs me that the number of new and extralimital forms thus
placed upon the list of invertebrates cannot be less than fifty.

A permanent collector, Mr. Vinal N. Edwards, has been employed at
Wood’s Holl and vicinity since 1871, and many remarkable forms have
also been discovered by him.

No dredging has yet been attempted by the Commission south of Long
Island, though much has been done in shore work, especially among the
fishes, by special agents and friends of the Commission, and by parties
stationed here and there in the work of fish-culture. Mr. E. G. Black-
144 APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. :

ford, of Fulton Market, New York, by carefully watching the market
slabs, has added at least ten species of fishes to the fauna of the United
States. Mr. F. Mather is studying the fish of Long Island and the
sound. Dr. Yarrow, Mr. Earll, and others, have collected from Cape
May to Key West. The Gulf States’ coast was explored last winter
by a party conducted by Mr. Silas Stearns, who spent nine months in
studying the subject relative to food and the census. The entire Pacifi¢e
coast has been scoured by Professor Jordan for the Commission and
the census, and the ichthyology of that region has been enriched by
the discovery of sixty species new to the fauna, forty of them being
new to science. A similar investigation on the Great Lakes has been
carried over a period of several years by Mr. Milner and Mr. Kumlien.
The ichthyology of the rivers of the country has received much attention
from the many experts employed by the Commission in fisheultural work.

In addition to these local studies may be mentioned the general explo-
rations, such as are now being earried on for the oyster, by Mr. Ernest
Ingersoll and Mr. John F. Ryder, for the shad by Colonel McDonald, for
the smelt and the Atlantic salmon by Mr. C. G. Atkins, and the Quinnat
salmon by Mr. Livingston Stone.

A partial indication of what has been accomplished may be found in
the number of species added to the various faunal lists. Take, for in-
stance, the cephalopod mollusks of New England. In Professor Ver-
rill’s recently published monographs, twenty species are mentioned, thir-
teen of which are new toscience. Ten years ago only three were known.

I am indebted to Professor Verrill for the following estimate of the
number of species added within the past ten years to the fauna of New
England, mainly by the agency of the Commission :

It is but just to say that many of these species were obtained by Pro-
fessor Verrill in the course of his independent explorations in Maine
and Connecticut previous to 1871.*

* A few days after the reading of this paper a new fauna was discovered about one
hundred miles southeast of Newport, and several hundred numbers might now be
added to this enumeration.
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 145

A similar estimate for the fishes indicates the discovery of at least
one hundred species on the eastern Atlantic coast within ten years; half
of these are new to science. Ferty species have been added to the
fauna north of Cape Cod; sixteen of these are new and have been found
within three years; seventeen have been described as new from the Gulf
of Mexico; sixty, and more, have been added upon the west coast. The
results of the summers’ campaigns are worked in winter by the special-
ists of the National Museum, and under the direction of Professor Ver-
rill, in New Haven.

One of the important features of the work is the preparation of life
histories of the useful marine animals of the country, and great quanti-
ties of material have been accumulated relating to almost every species.
A portion of this has been published; more or less complete biographical
monographs having been printed on the bluefish, the seup, the menhaden,
the salmon, and the whitefish, and others are nearly ready.

Another monograph which may be referred to in this connection is
that of Mr. Starbuck on the whale fishery, giving its history from the
earliest settlement of North America.

The temperature of the water in its relation to the movements of fish
has from the first received special attention. Observations are made
regularly during the summer work, and at the various hatching sta-
tions. At the instance of the Commissioner, an extensive series of
observations have for several years been made under the direction of
the Chief Signal Officer of the Army, at light-houses, light-ships, life-
saving and signal stations, carefully chosen, along the whole coast.
This year thirty or more fishing schooners and steamers are carrying
thermometers to record temperatures upon the fishing grounds, a jour-
nal of the movements of the fish being kept at the same time. One
practical result of the study of these observations has been the demon-
stration of the cause of the failure of the menhaden fisheries on the
coast of Maine in 1879—a failure on account of which nearly 2,000 per-
sons were thrown out of employment.

Another important series of investigations carried on by Commander
Beardslee, of the Navy, shows the error of the ordinary manner of
using the Casella Miller deep-sea thermometer; still another series
made by Dr. Kidder, of the Navy, and to be carried out in future, had
for its object the determination of the temperature of the blood of
marine animals.

_ Observations have also been made by Mr. Milner upon the influence
of a change from sea water into fresh water, and from fresh water into
sea water, upon the young of different fishes.

Mr. H. J. Rice carried on a series of studies upon the effect of cold in
retarding the development of incubating fish eggs.

A series of analyses has been made by Professor Atwater to deter-
mine the chemical composition and nutritive value of fish as compared
with other articles of food. This investigation is still in progress.

146 APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY

In connection with the work of fish culture, much attention has been
paid to embryology. The breeding times and habits of nearly all of
our fishes have been studied, and their relations to water temperatures.
The embryological history of a number of species, such as the cod, shad,
alewife, salmon, smelt, Spanish mackerel, striped bass, white perch, and
the oyster, have been obtained, under the auspices of the Commission,
by Messrs. Brooks, Ryder, Scheeffer, Rice, and others.

The introduction of new species, in water in which they were pre-
viously unknown, is of special interest to the student of geographical
distribution. Through the agency of the Commission the German carp
has already been placed in nearly every State and Territory, although
the work of distribution has only just begun, and the tench (Tinca vul-
garis) and the golden orfe (Idus melanotus) have been acclimated; the
shad has been successfully planted in the Mississippi Valley and on the
coast of California, and the California salmon in the rivers of the
Atlantic slope. The marzna, or lake whitefish, of Europe, has been
introduced into a lake of Wisconsin. It is not my purpose to speak of
the great success in restocking with shad and salmon several rivers in
which the supply was almost exhausted, and in planting the Schoodic
salmon in numerous lakes. By an act of international courtesy, Cali-
fornia salmon have been successfully introduced into New Zealand and
Germany. The propagation work has increased in importance from
year to year, as may be seen by the constant increase in the amount of
the annual appropriation. A review of the results of the labors of the
Commission, in increasing the food supply of the country, may be found
in the annual reports; the rude appliances of fish culture ten years ago
have given way to scientifically devised apparatus, by which millions
of eggs are hatched where thousands were, and the demonstration of
the possibility of stocking rivers and lakes to any desired extent has
been greatly strengthened. This work was for six years most efficiently
directed by the late Mr. James W. Milner, and is now in charge of
Maj. T. B. Ferguson, also commissioner for the State of Maryland, by
whom has been devised the machinery for propagation on a gigantic
seale, by the aid of steam, which is now so successfully in use, revolu-
tionizing the art of fish culture.

The investigation of the statistics and history of the fisheries has
perhaps assumed greater proportions than was at first contemplated.
One of the immediate causes of the establishment of the Commission was
the dissension between the line and net fishermen of Southern New
England with reference to laws for the protection of the deteriorating
fisheries of that region. The first work of Professor Baird, as Commis-
sioner, was to investigate the causes of this deterioration, and the report
of that year’s work includes much statistical material. In the same
year a zoological and statistical survey of the Great Lakes was accom-
plished, and various circulars were sent out in contemplation of the
preparation of monographie reports upon the special branches of the
fisheries, some of which have already been published.
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 147

In 1877, the Commissioner and his staff were summoned to Halifax to
Serve as witnesses and experts before the Halifax Fishery Commission,
then charged with the settlement of the amount of compensation to be
paid by the United States for the privilege of participating in the fish-
eries of the Provinces. The information at that time available concern-
ing the fisheries was found to be so slight and imperfect that a plan for
systematic investigation of the subject was arranged and partially un-
dertaken. The work was carried on for two seasons with some financial
aid from the Department of State. In 1879 an arrangement was made
with the Superintendent of the Tenth Census, who agreed to bear a
part of the expense of carrying out the scheme in full. Some thirty
trained experts are now engaged in the preparation of a statistical report
on the present state and the past history of the fisheries of the United
States. This will be finished next year, but the subject will hereafter
be continued in monographs upon separate branches of the fisheries, such
as the halibut fishery, the mackerel fishery, the shad fishery, the cod
fishery, the herring fishery, the smelt fishery, and various others of less
importance.

Hundreds, and even thousands, of specimens of a single species are
oftenobtained. After those forthe National Museum haye been selected,
a great number of duplicates remain. These are identified, labeled,
and made into sets for exchange with other museums for distribution te
schools and small museums. This is in accordance with the time-hon-
ored usage of the Smithsonian Institution, and is regarded as an im-
portant branch of the work. Several specialists are employed solely
in making up these sets and in gathering material required for their
completion. Within three years fifty sets of fishes in alcohol, including
at least ten thousand specimens, have been sent out, and fifty sets of
invertebrates, embracing one hundred and seventy-five species and two
hundred and fifty thousand specimens. One hundred smaller sets of
representative forms intended for educational purposes, to be given to
schools and academies, are now being prepared.

The arrangement of the invertebrate duplicates is in the charge of
Mr. Richard Rathbun; of the fishes, in that of Dr. T. H. Bean.

Facilities have also been given to many institutions for making col-
lections on their own behalf.

Six annual reports have been published, with an aggregate of 5,650
pages. These cover the period from 1871 to 1878. Many papers relat-
ing to the work have been published elsewhere—particularly descrip-
tions of new species and results of special faunal exploration.

AN EPITOME OF THE HISTORY OF THE COMMISSION.

1871.—The Commissioner, with a party of zoologists, established the
first summer station at Wood’s Holl, Mass., other assistants being en-
gaged in a similar work at Cape Hatteras and the Great Lakes. He
also personally investigated the alleged decrease of the fisheries in
southern New England, taking the testimony of numerous witnesses.
148 APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

1872.—This year the summer station was at Eastport, Me., particular
attention being paid to the herring fisheries. The survey of the Great
Lakes was continued. Dredging, under the direction of Professor Pack-
ard, was begun on the off-shore banks. At the instance of the American
Fish Cultural Association, Congress requested the Commissioner to
take charge of the work of multiplying valuable food fishes throughout
the country. Work was begun on the shad, salmon, and whitefish, and
the eggs of the European salmon were imported.

1873.—The summer headquarters were fixed at. Portland, Me. The
opportunities for research were greatly increased by the aid of the See-
retary of the Navy, who granted the use of an eighty-ton steamer.

Explorations in the outer waters between Mount ‘Desert and Cape
Cod were carried on in the United States Coast Survey steamer Bache.
Operations in fish culture were carried on upon an extensive scale.

1874-1875.—In 1874 the zoological work centered at Noank, Conn.
The attempt was made to introduce shad into Europe. In 1875 the
station was for a second time at Wood’s Holl, where a permanent sea-
side laboratory, with aquaria, was now established. The number of
investigations this year was about twenty. The increase in the propa-
gation work was proportionately much larger.

1876.—This year the Commissioner was unable to take the field for
fishery investigations, having been instructed to exhibit, in connection
with the Philadelphia International Exhibition, the methods of fish
culture and the American fisheries. Much, however, was accomplished
by single investigators in various localities. The propagation work
continued. This year the first carp were introduced from Germany.

1877.—The field of investigation was resumed at Salem, Mass., and
later at Halifax, Nova Scotia. A large steamer of 300 tons made deep-
sea research possible. The Commissioner and his staff served as experts
before the Halifax Fishery Commission. The propagating work was
on the increase, and the government carp ponds were established in
Washington.

1878-1879.—In 1878 the summer station was at Gloucester, Mass. ; in
1879 at Provincetown. ‘These centers of the fishing interests were se-
lected that more attention might be devoted to studying the history,
statistics and methods of the sea fisheries; a plan for the systematic
investigation which seems yearly more necessary in view of the dissen-
sions between the governments of the United States and Great Britain.
In 1879 a combination was formed with the Superintendent of the Tenth
Census, by which the Commissioner was enabled to carry more rapidly
forward this branch of the work. Specialists were dispatched to all parts
of the country to study the biological, statistical, and practical aspects of
the fisheries. In 1878 the breeding of cod and haddock was accom-
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 149

plished at Gloucester. In 1879 the propagation of the oyster was
accomplished, by co-operation with the Maryland Commission under the
direction of Major Ferguson, and the distribution of the carp through-
out the country was begun.

1880.—The summer station is at Newport, R. I. The Fish Hawk, a
steamer of 484 tons, constructed expressly for the work of the Commis-
sion, lies at the wharf, now equipped for scientific research, later to be
employed in the propagation of sea fish, such as the cod and the mack-
erel. Over fifty investigators are in the field in the service of the Com-
mission. The season was opened by the participation of the Commission
in the International Exhibition at Berlin. The first honor prize, the gift
of the Emperor of Germany, was awarded to Professor Baird, not alone
as an acknowledgment that the display of the United States was the
most perfect and most imposing, but as a personal tribute to one who,
in the words of the President of the Deutscher Fischerei Verein, is re-
garded in Europe as “the first fishculturist in the world.”
SPECIAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

PRESENTED TO THE BOARD OF REGENTS DECEMBER 8, 1880.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

GENTLEMEN: The Board of Regents has been called to this special
meeting at the request of the Executive Committee to consider two sub-
jects of importance, requiring action before its regular annual session.

At the last session of Congress the following act was passed :

AN ACT for the erection of a bronze statue of Joseph Henry, late Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution be, and are hereby, authorized to contract with W.
W. Story, sculptor, for a statue in bronze of Joseph Henry, late Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution, to be erected upon the grounds of
said Institution, and for this purpose, and for the entire expense of the
foundation and pedestal of the monument, the sum of fifteen thousand
dollars is hereby appropriated out of any moneys in the Treasury not
otherwise appropriated.

Approved June 6, 1880.

(Forty-sixth Congress, second session, chapter 116.)

The Secretary of the Institution immediately informed Mr. Story of -
this action of Congress, and requested his views on the subject and in-
formation as to his acceptance of the commission.

This correspondence is as follows:

‘SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
“Washington, D. C., June 10, 1880.

‘Str: A bill providing for the erection of a statue of Prof. Joseph
Henry, late Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, introduced by
Senator Morrill, has become a law. <A copy of this is herewith inclosed.

‘‘ As you will see, its essential points are the provision for a bronze
statue of Professor Henry, to be placed in the Smithsonian grounds,
and that the total cost, including exper for the pedestal, &c., shall
not exceed $15,000.

“T beg to inquire whether you will accept the commission under
these conditions; and presuming that you will, I forward herewith as

full a series of photographs of the illustrious deceased as can be sup-
150

plied by the Institution. This series includes those which in the opinion
of Professor Henry’s family are most characteristic likenesses.

“T shall be pleased to have from you any communication on this sub-
ject, and, if possible, designs for the proposed statue and pedestal, for
communication to the Board of Regents at their next annual meeting
in January, 1881.

“‘ As this Board is to decide upon the construction of the statue, it
will not be possible to give you final authority in the matter until the
Board shall have taken action thereon.

“T am, meanwhile, very truly yours,
‘“ SPENCER F. BAIRD,
“¢ Secretary.

“WwW. W. STORY, Esq.,

“American Sculptor, Rome, Italy.

Letter of Mr. Story to Professor Baird.

‘6 VENICE, July 15, 1880.

“Sir: I have just received your letter of June 10, informing me of the
bill lately passed by Congress, by which the Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution are authorized to contract with me for a statue in bronze of
the late Professor Henry, for the sum of $15,000, including the founda-
tion and pedestal of the monument, and asking me whether I will accept
this commission.

“Mr. Senator Morrill had already communicated to me this entirely
unexpected and agreeable news. Until his communication was made,
I had no notion that it was intended to erect such a statue, but I most
willingly accept the commission, with hearty thanks to those friends
who, without any knowledge on my part, put forward my name as the
sculptor.

‘“‘ My recollections of Professor Henry are in every way most pleasant.
He was very kind to me when I was last in Washington, and it will
give me pleasure to do all in my power to make a statue of him worthy
of his high distinction and his amiable character. -

The photographs which you have had the kindness to send have not
yet arrived, but I have little doubt that they will supply me with the neces-
sary material. As you say nothing of a mask in plaster from the face,
I suppose none was taken. This I greatly regret, as it would furnish
me, in connection with the photographs, the absolute facts of the face,
as well as the character and expression. If such a mask was taken, or
anything was ever made of him containing the exact measures of his face
and features, I should be most glad to have them. If any bust was ever
made, however bad, it would be of use to me in determining points of
size and measurement. I hope, too, there may be among the photo-
graphs some one or more in profile, or at least three-quarters face. Do
not in such case be prevented from sending them merely because they
152 SPECIAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

are bad in expression or otherwise. What I want is facts, and themore
I can have of these the better. They will not lead me astray as to ex-
pression. Small facts and details may be explained in one which are
not clearly determined in another, and enable me to make the head more
living and true.

“JT regret to hear that no absolute action can be taken by the Board
before January 1, 1881. This will greatly delay the execution of the
statue, to which I was intending to devote myself immediately on my
return to Rome in October or November, so as to be able to finish the
model this winter. But if all final arrangement is postponed until Jan-
uary before the absolute commission can be given and the contract
made, the winter will have passed, and the execution of the statue will,
I fear, be necessarily postponed for a year, as it is impossible for me to
remain in Rome and execute the model during the summer without very
great inconvenience and difficulty.

“You wish me to send you, if possible, designs for the proposed statue
and pedestal, for communication to the Board of Regents at their an-
nual meeting in, January, 1881. Of course I can do this, if they think it
advisable or necessary ; but [must frankly say—I hope they will excuse
me in so saying, as no kind of disrespect is intended, or want of confi-
dence in their taste and judgment—that I think, if they have any faith
in my ability, it would be better for them to leave the conception and
execution of the statue entirely to me. There is nothing so dangerous
as to interfere with an artist in his design, or to judge of it and criticise
it from a small model. The freer he is, the more responsible he feels,
and, if he has real ability, the less he is tampered with and directed, the
better his work will be. If he has not the requisite ability to do it by
himself, he should better not do it at all. No suggestions by any com-
mittee and no directions and alterations will ever make his work good.
My own experience has been that this divided responsibility and design-
ing has almost invariably resulted in dissatisfaction on both sides. The
artist can only do well with what is in his own mind, and not what is in
the mind of others, and my own judgment is that he does far better
when left to himself, always provided he has real capacity for his work.
If I may be allowed to allude to my own personal experience, I may add
that in the case of almost the only public portrait statue of mine in
America, the committee, composed of gentlemen of high taste and pre-
tension to artistic culture, after rejecting my own first sketch, and in-
Sisting on my altering the attitude and arrangement to meet their views,
contrary to my notions, were finally persuaded, when the work was
completed and it was too late, that they had been entirely wrong in
dictating these changes, and regretted that they had interfered. Never-
theless they threw upon me the responsibility which belonged solely to
them. I made their statue and not mine, and they were disappointed,
as I toretold that they would be. But Ido not need to speak of my
SPECIAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. 153

own personal experience; the experience of all artists is the same on
this point.

‘““ However, if despite this, the Board desires me to send them a sketch
I can do so; but of course, as I have stated, this will delay the statue
for a year, and I cannot see the advantage.

“Tn fact, I have already made a sketch of the statue since I received
Mr. Morrill’s communication. But I doubt whether it would mean as
much to you and to the Board of Regents as it does to me; whether you
would rightly understand it in its roughness, and whether you would not
look for that finish which no free sketch ought to have, and rather look
to details than to matters and balance of composition, which are the all
in all of a sketch. I say this because I know one case where a sketch
was rejected because the likeness in the face was not striking, as if any
true artist would, in a mere sketch, attempt exact portraiture of the face.
It would be equally good as to composition and design with no face at
all, if it had the just movement.

‘You say nothing as to details of the commission, or the size of the
statue, or the place where it is to be erected, or its surroundings. Is it
to be in the open air, or under cover in the buildings? Is its back-
ground trees, sky, or building? All these are very important consider-
ations in view of its effect and of its size.

“| take it for granted that the pedestal is to be a simple one, and not
to have illustrative bas-reliefs or figures, inasmuch as the sum appro-
priated for the whole thing is less, or certainly not more, than what is
ordinarily paid for a statue alone without pedestal or foundation. I
also suppose by the reading of the act of Congress that this sum is to
cover the cost of the statue and “the entire expense of the foundation
and pedestal,” and this is all. It does not, as I understand it, include
boxing, transportation, insurance, and placing, as they are distinctly
not mentioned.

‘Can you give me an estimate of the cost of making the foundation,
and approximate price of a simple pedestal executed in Washington, in
marble or red granite, or stone of any appropriate kind? This would
guide me in determining where I should make the pedestal, whether
here or in Washington, and of what material.

‘As to the sum of $15,000 appropriated by Congress, does interest run
upon it from the date of the enactment? In regard to payment I sup-
pose you are aware that the ordinary rule is to advance to the artist
one-half the sum when the commission is given, or the work commenced,
to enable him to meet the necessary outlay and expenses, without re-
course to his own pocket.

‘‘T mention all these particulars in order to avoid all misunderstanding.

“T again recur to the question of time, and I earnestly hope that it will
be possible for the Board of Regents to arrange definitely this whole mat-
ter at a much earlier period than that mentioned in your letter, viz:
January 1, 1881, as it will involve the loss of a year. If I could have
154 SPECIAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

the commission and authorization to commence the work by the Ist of
October or November, I could finish the model by the spring and imme-
diately arrange for its casting in bronze during the summer so as to
have it ready to send to Washington by the Ist of October following
(1881).

‘“‘] suppose that the Board of Regents is equally interested with myself
in desiring the statue to be finished as soon as possible, and if they will
definitely authorize me to begin the model by the ist of November, I
can promise, unless some unforseen accident occurs, to finish it in bronze
by the 1st of January, 1882; otherwise I fear we shall have to put it
forward to January, 1883.

‘“‘ If the Board of Regents have faith in my ability and will trust me to
follow out my own ideas in this statue, I will pledge myself to do my
best to satisfy myself and them, and to spare no pains to give them a
statue worthy of the subject, worthy of the place, and satisfactory to
the family, friends, and admirers of Professor Henry.

“ You must not expect too much. The male costume of the present
day is crude, graceless, and thoroughly unsculptural. But I will do
what I can to hide its awkwardness and ugliness without falsifying
truth and fact, and endeavor to render the statue serious and dignified
and natural. Isuppose that Professor Henry had no academic costume,
and that there is no peculiar professional dress in which he could be
represented. If there be, and the Board of Regents is willing that I
should clothe the statue in such a dress, I should most gladly do it.
Then I should be able to drape him in some way at once dignified and
true to fact. The academic costume could be treated so as to make an
imposing statue. Insuch case, would you have the kindness to forward
to me the dress, that I may use it to model from? The silk academic
robes would be admirable and advisable, but I scarcely dare to hope
that he wore one, or that I may use it. What did he wear? If this
academic dress is out of the question, what may I represent him in?
Did he wear a cloak ?

“The sketch I have made representshim as in a buttoned frock-coat,
over which is a loose open sack; it is in the attitude of meditation ; his
head bent slightly forwards, looking down, one hand resting on a desk
or stand at his side, by which to break the horrible uniformity of the two
legs of pantaloons, and give breadth and dignity to the base, and one

During the recess of Congress it was found impracticable to call a
meeting of the Regents, but their views were asked individually by the
Secretary as to the power of the Executive Committee to make a formal
contract with the artist and enable him to go on with the work.

The opinion of the majority was that this power could be exercised
by the Executive Committee. A meeting was therefore called of this
Committee on the 13th of November, 1880, when the subject was fully
considered and the following action taken:

“6 Resolved, That the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution inform
Mr. Story that the Executive Committee authorize him to proceed in
the execution of the bronze statue ordered by Congress June 1, 1880,
according to his own plan and designs, but that this Committee is not
empowered to make a formal contract for this purpose, although war-
ranted in such action by the individual expressions of Regents as con-
tained in letters received by the Secretary.

‘Resolved, That a special meeting of the Regents be called on the 8th
of December, 1880, to consider the subject, and if the action of the Ex-
ecutive Committee is not confirmed, a cable message be immediately
sent to Mr. Story, and, if approved, a contract in due form be made out
and transmitted to him.”

This action of the Committee was communicated to Mr. Story by the
Secretary on the 15th of November.

Another subject demanding the consideration of the Board has been
presented to the Executive Committee.

A committee of citizens of Washington having presented a request
for the. use of the new National Museum building for a reception to the
President of the United States elect, on the 4th of “March next, after a
full consideration of the subject, in view of the fact that the building is
unfinished and not yet occupied as a Museum, and that such a contin-
gency would not again occur and would not therefore furnish a prece-
dent ; in view also of the fact that the expense of erecting a suitable
building would be very great and unnecessary, and, moreover, that the
President elect is and has been for many years a member of the Board
of Regents, whose aid and influence contributed materially to the erec-
tion of the new Museum, the Committee adopted the following :

“ Whereas an application has been received from a committee of citi-
zens for the use of the unfinished building of the National Museum, for
156 SPECIAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

the purpose of a public reception to the President elect, Hon. James A.
Garfield, on the evening of the 4th of March next; therefore,

“ Resolved, That the Executive Committee submit this application to
the Board of Regents at its next meeting, with its approval and with
the recommendation that the request be granted.”

The Committee furthermore make the following statement :

The new National Museum building has been substantially com-
pleted and made ready for occupancy within the appropriations by Con-
gress. <A detailed account of the history of operations of its construc-
tion will be presented at the annual meeting of the Board in January
next.

The Building Commission has refrained from completing the floors of
the rotunda and large halls or naves according to the original plans,
which provided only for concrete and cement, on account of the remon-
strances of prominent members of Congress, who urged that such floors
were unsuitable to, and unworthy of, so fine a building, and their assur-
ances that appropriations would doubtless be made at the approaching
session of Congress for marble or tile floors for these halls.

The Committee report that provision has been made so that the floors
of the rotunda and four naves leading to themain entrance of the build-
ing may be laid in marble or tile instead of cement, and that if an ap-
propriation of $25,000 be made immediately, the building will be ready
for the reception of the President on the 4th of March next, fully adapted
and provided with heat, light, and all the facilities required for the oc-
casion.

In conclusion, the Committee respectfully submit the following reso-
lutions to the Board for adoption :

* Resolved, That the Chancellor and Secretary of the Smithsonian In-
stitute execute a contract with Mr. W. W. Story, of Rome, for thestatue
in bronze of the late Prof. Joseph Henry, authorized by the act of
Congress of June 1, 1880, with the provision for payment of the sum of
$3,750 to Mr. Story on completion of his design for the statue; the sum
of $3,750 on completion of the model in clay ; the sum of $3,750 on com-
pletion of the statue in bronze; and the sum of $3,750 on delivery and
erection of the statue with its pedestal in the city of Washington, on
the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution, and furthermore that Mr.
Story shall cause the said statue to be insured for the amount of the ad-
vance payments to him, against perils by land or by sea, which insur-
ance shall, in case of loss, be paid to the Smithsonian Institution for the
benefit of the United States.

‘Resolved, That for the purpose of substituting a marble or tile floor-
ing, instead of concrete, as originally designed, for the large halls in the
National Museum, an appropriation of twenty-five thousand dollars be
requested of Congress, to be expended according to the plans and under
the direction of the building commission of the Board of Regents of the

“Resolved, That the use of the new National Museum building be

make all necessary arrangements for this purpose.”

REPORT OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDING COMMISSION
FOR 1880.

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 15, 1881.
To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

GENTLEMEN: At your annual meeting on the 19th of last January,
the National Museum Building Commission submitted a report of opera-

- tions in connection with the new building for the National Museum, from

their inception to the close of 1879.

In that report attention was called to the necessity for increased
accommodations for the national collections in charge of the Smithsonian
Institution; to the endeavors of your Board in previous years to ebtain
from Congress an appropriation for the same, and to their final success
in 1879 in securing an appropriation of $250,000 for the purpose.

Mention was also made that the Executive Committee of the Board of
Regents and the Secretary of the Institution, who are charged by resolu-
tion of the Board of January 17, 1879, with the duty of “ carrying into
effect the provisions of any act of Congress that might (may) be passed
providing for the erection of a building for the National Museum,” had
organized under the title of “ National Museum Building Commission.”

Also, you were informed of the action of the Commission in early
adopting such measures as appeared to it best calculated to realize with
the least possible delay the intention of Congress in making provision
for a new building; of the employment of Messrs. Cluss & Schulze as
superintending architects; of the acceptance by General Meigs of the
invitation of the Commission to act as its consulting engineer; and of
the opinions of Mr. Edward Clark, Architect of the Capitol, and General
Meigs as to the sufficiency of the appropriation for the erection of a
building in accordance with the plans approved by Congress. Reference
was also made to the action of the Secretary of the Treasury in detailing
an officer of the Treasury Department to disburse the appropriation, by
which action the fund was made immediately available. In addition, a
resumé was presented of the active operations in the construction of the
building whereby you were made aware that ground was broken on the
17th of April, 1879; that the concrete foundations were begun April 29;
that the brick work of the walls was commenced May 21, and that the
walls were completed on the 1st day of November.

Moreover, mention was made of the good fortune of the Commission
in securing exceedingly favorable contracts, especially for the brick and
iron work, previous to the early subsequent rapid advance in the prices

of iron and other building materials; of the fact that the cost of the
heating apparatus was not included in the estimate of $250,000, and that
therefore an appropriation of $25,000 for this item had been asked of
Congress; and, finally, of the then pending efforts of the Commission to
settle the question of material for the cases, whether this should be wood
or iron.

Besides information upon the points above specified, an appended re-
port of the architects presented en interesting technical and descriptive
record of the plan and design of the building and a detailed exhibit of
the expenditures on account of construction to the close of the year 1879.
In the present report, therefore, it is only necessary for the Commis-
sion to review the operations of the year just ended.

The iron work of the roofs was satisfactorily completed by the latter
part of March, and the tin work and slating early in April.

The plastering, which was done partly by day’s work and partly under
contract, was begun early in March and finished by the latter part of
July. The plaster of the slate roofs is laid directly on the slate, and that
of the low, flat roofs on gratings fastened between the iron girders of the
roof and rendered fire-proof by a filling of mortar composed of plaster
of Paris and ashes—a form of ceiling suggested by General Meigs.

The painting and glazing has been satisfactorily done. In the inter-
est of economy in heating, it was decided to put both an inner and an
outer glass in the sash of all outside windows.

The supply-pipes for water and gas were laid by the close of February
and the work duly inspected and approved. ,

The wood floors have all been put down, excepting in the four square
halls. In the four main halls, or naves, and in the rotunda of the dome
it was originally intended to lay concrete, but owing to urgent remon-
strances against the use of this material as not being in keeping with
the architectural beauty and design of the building, Congress has been
asked for an appropriation of $25,000 to defray the expense of a marble
or tile floor for these halls. The request for this appropriation was in
accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents of December 9th,
1880.

The heating apparatus is also in, and, with the exception of bronzing
a number of the radiators, Messrs. Baker, Smith & Co. have completed
their contract for this work. During the recent severe weather the ap-
paratus was subjected to a test more severe than will be likely to occur
again for a number of years, and it is a matter of congratulation to the

Jommission, as wellas to the contractors, that the work gives entire
satisfaction.

A most economical arrangement connected with this heating appa-
ratus is that of two automatic traps whereby the condensed steam is
again brought to the boilers. While by this arrangement both time and
fuel for heating fresh water are saved, the fear of a lack of supply of
q

RFPORT OF BUILDING COMMISSION, 169

water to the boilers is eliminated, that originally used suflicing for at
least seven days.

The work of putting in the wires for the burglar-alarm telegraph,
telephone, and electric clocks and eall-bells, which was begun in the sum-
mer, is now hearly finished. These wires, which are run through under-
ground trenches, either specially constructed for the purpose or for heat-
ing-pipes, will extend from a room in one of the north towers to each
window, door, and case in the entire building, and also to the police and
fire-alarm telegraphs. This electrical arrangement will constitute a val-
uable feature in the economy of administration of a structure so immense
as, and of the peculiar construction of, the new Museum building, since
it will lessen the necessity for a large corps of watchmen and attendants,
the locality of any attempt on the part of designing persons to open a
window, door, or case being at once automatically indicated in the cen-
tral office, or instrument room, where a watchman will be on duty at all
hours.

As the original estimates upon which the appropriation of $250,000
was based did not include a provision for the expanded system of water
and gas fixtures and electrical apparatus, an appropriation of $12,500
was requested therefor and readily secured.

In addition to the above, an appropriation of $1,000 * was secured for
a sewer to connect with the B street sewer to relieve the building from
water, which, on account of the inadequacy of the Seventh street sewer,
during heavy rains, backs up in the pipes and floods the cellars. This
relieving sewer will be constructed under the supervision of the engi-
neer of the District of Columbia, Lieutenant Hoxie.

For fuller information, however, the Board is respectfully referred to
the appended report of the superintending architects, which also presents
a detailed exhibit of expenditures.

During the year past the Commission has met as often as was deemed
necessary. General Meigs, as consulting engineer, has generally been
present at the sessions of the Commission, while, as during the previous
year, his visits to the new building have been frequent and his inspec-
tion of the work close and critical.

In closing this report the Commission is happy to state that the build-
ing, with the erection of which it was charged, is substantially finished,
and that it hopes at the next annual session of the Board to be able to
congratulate the Regents on its entire completion and occupation.

Respectfully submitted.

170 REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDING ARCHITECTS OF FIRE-
PROOF BUILDING FOR NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1880.

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 1, 1881.

To the National Museum Building Commission, Smithsonian Institution,
Washington, D. C.:

GENTLEMEN: We have the honor to report to you the completion of
the new building under the appropriations available for the purpose,
and simultaneously to submit a report of operations on the construction
of the building since January 1, 1880, the date of our last report.

The progress of the work was such that the plastering of the building
could be commenced as soon as the state of the weather permitted it,
in the early part of the spring. It was completed by the middle of
August, and, after this, miscellaneous work for finishing, such as iron
balconies, railings, and stairways, were put up, all the offices were
floored and put in readiness for occupation, the cellars were laid with
asphaltic concrete, the wooden floors of all the outside halls were laid
upon a solid bed of hydraulic cement-concrete, and a concrete base was
laid for the floors of the main and square halls. All the numerous de-
tails of the steam-heating apparatus were attended to so that steam
could be put on with the advent of the cold weather; and though the
heavy walls and piers were considerably chilled by long-continued ex-
posure during the early fall and the excessive moisture in the unfinished
building, a comfortable heat was obtained within a few days and was
maintained during the coldest days of this unusually severe winter, no
more than a reasonable amount of fuel being used for heating the vast
space of about 3,500,000 cubic feet inclosed within the walls and roofs
of the building.

The asphalt facing of the floors of the main halls and rotunda, as in-
tended under the estimates, has not been put on, since with hardly any
difference of opinion it was held that nothing less than a chaste tiling
would do justice to the building, and provision ought to be made for
this without delay. On the other hand, much more than an equivalent
of the cost of this surfacing has been spent on work not included in the
estimates, but deemed more important for the opening of the building
at as early a date as possible.

The approaches to the building, for which always a separate estimate
is brought before Congress, have been mostly finished under the orig-
inal appropriation. We may be allowed to state a few of the items not
originally contemplated, but included in the construction accounts, to
wit :

The conditions imposed upon us to keep within the appropriations
have been complied with in good faith. A substantial fire-proof build-
ing has been completed at a less cost per square foot of the inclosed
area than that of the temporary buildings erected for the International
Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876.

The principle adopted to have all the windows in side walls and lan-
terns glazed with two sheets of glass, having an intermediate air-space,
has led to favorable results, and it is desirable to extend the same feature
over the under sides of the roofs in the halls by the introduction of light
iron ceilings about 14 inches distant from those plastered undersides ;
the intermediate air-space in this case to be packed with a non-conduet-
ing fire-proof material, such as mineral-wool or its equivalent. This
will secure for the building a very pleasant temperature in summer,
reduce the expense of heating the huge building in winter, and remove
any tendency towards condensation on those exposed undersides during
the rapid changes of temperature and hygrometric condition of the
atmosphere peculiar to this climate and locality.

Having given a technical description of the design and construction
of the new building in our last report, we now report specially on the
theory, practice, and results of warming the building. In consideration
of the great cubic contents of air inclosed in the building, and the com-
paratively very few sources of vitiation of the same, the system of heat-
ing by direct radiation has been adopted. For winter ventilation the
spires of eight towers and the lanterns of halls and dome are made
available whenever necessary, and for summer ventilation a sufficient
number of improved iron sashes pivoting in iron frames have been
added and inserted in the windows of the side walls and the lanterns of
the building.

The heating coils and radiators are placed in the rooms to be warmed
and heat the air by contact with the radiators; the surrounding walls
and solid objects absorbing a certain amount of radiant heat and again
heating the air by contact,
172 REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS.

To ascertain the demands to be made upon the apparatus for heating,
the conditions of the building were studied, in order to arrive at the loss
of heat inside the building for an external temperature of zero and an
internal temperature of 70° Fahrenheit. This loss of heat is caused by
the exposed surfaces of the building, which consist of hollow brick walls
plastered inside, of tin roofs lined with felt and supported by non-con-
ducting fire-proof material plastered inside, and of windows having two
thicknesses of glass with inclosed air-space. It is increased by an
amount due to leakages, absorption of heat by the soil, transfusion of air
by the opening of doors, &c. To allow for contingencies, the required
heating surfaces resulting from above causes were increased by about
fifteen per cent. and the generating power of steam three times.

The necessity for such a disproportionate amount of generating power
-S explained by the fact that the condensation is enormous when the
steam circulating pipes and radiators are first heated up, because their
specific heat is very high when compared with that of the air. When the
circulation is once established, the demand upon the boilers decreases
to an amount equal to the heat radiated and carried off by the air from
the heating surfaces, provided that the main circulating (or flow) pipes,
which are not to act as radiators, but rather as vehicles to carry the
heat to the most extreme points of the building, are protected by a suffi-
cient coating of non-conducting material, which should be provided for,
the sooner the better.

It is evident that for such nice adjustments there were no funds
available so far.

Continued satisfactory heating by the direct radiating system de-
mands, with such an extensive apparatus, constant and close attention ;
otherwise there will be a great waste of fuel in mild weather, and well-
founded complaint of overheating.

As the building is heated up, radiators must be shut off until no more
heating surface is left than is required to balance the loss of heat, which
in this climate is very variable. The offices require more heat, rela-
tively, than the halls; and if, after the building is warm throughout,
steam were shut down entirely to prevent overheating the halls, as
would happen in mild weather, the offices could not be occupied for
want of heat long before the first sensation of coolness appeared in the
halls. The cause of this is that the ratio of cooling surface to space (or
cubic contents)is much greater in the case of the small rooms than in
the halls, which form a huge reservoir of heat, contained in the inside
walls and objects as well as in the air.

It is necessary to put the whole force on once a day in order to get
circulation of steam throughout. In mild weather shut down as soon
as overheating begins. In extremely cold weather the full force is to
be kept up continuously.

It being established by experiment that about 25 per cent. of the entire
heat absorbed in evaporating the water in the boilers will be restored by
REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS. B hy (3

returning the water of condensation in the coils to the boilers, at a tem-
perature of about 175 degrees, instead of heating new supplies of water
from an average winter temperature of 56° to the boiling point, special
efforts were made in this direction. In order to prevent clattering and
noise the steam-pipes have a fall from the boilers, so that any condensed
water flows in the same direction with the steam and not against it, until
points are reached where the steam-pipes are tapped and discharge the
condensed water into the return pipes, which are started at the extreme
end or lowest point of the flow-pipes with an adequate fall towards the
boilers.

The extreme length of each of two lines of steam-conducting and re-
turn water-pipes is about an eighth of a mile.

To promote the usefulness of the building, these whole systems of
pipes were buried in large-sized underground ducts. The grade of the
public sewers does not allow the boilers to be set deep enough for re-
turning the condensed water to them exclusively by gravitation, as is
most desirable, hence it is conducted into a receiver located on the floor
of the boiler-room, from which it is raised by automatic steam-traps lo-
cated above the boilers. These traps are, firstly, supplied with steam
from the boilers. They are so constructed that by the movement of a
lever connected with a float the steam is shut off, when it condenses
in the traps, causes a partial vacuum, and lifts the water from the re-
ceiver into the traps by suction. As the ascending water fills the traps
it lifts the float, the lever of which gradually opens the steam-valve,
permits the steam to enter the traps, and at the same time causes an
equalization of pressure in the boilers and traps whereby the water, by
gravitation, flows back into the boilers. To operate these traps no more
pressure is required than sufficient to raise the water from the receiver
to the trap.

Since immediately after starting the fires the pressure in the boilers
may be too small, a steam-pump is at hand by which the water is forced
direct from the receiver into the boilers. This pump works with less than
two pounds pressure per square inch, and forces either hot or cold water.
When a fresh supply of water should be desired and the steam-pressure
is greater than that in the main water-pipes, the pump is connected with
these mains and the boilers supplied therefrom. Ordinarily the boilers
are fed direct from the water mains.

The steam for warming the building is generated in four tubular boil-
ers of 56 inches diameter and 15 feet length, containing each 72 tubes of
3 inches diameter. The heat of the fire passes first under the whole
length of the boilers, then back through the tubes and finally over the
top of the boiler, giving the greatest possible exposure of surface and
resulting in the greatest attainable economy of fuel.

The boilers are connected overhead by steam-pipes of 5 inches diame-
ter from each, with stop-valves ; these lead into a drum of 12 inches di-
ameter to which two 8-inch main steam-pipes are attached, each of which
(A REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS.

supplies a pipe system warming one-half of the building. Valves are
placed in those 8-inch pipes, and the whole apparatus is arranged so
that one, or all, or any number of the four boilers can be used at pleas-
ure and steam shut off from either half of the building, or from any de-
sired number of the radiators. The steam-conducting pipes are gradu-
ally reduced in size, as the several branches for the supply of the radia-
tors are taken off until at the ends of the lines at the northeast corner of
the building, which is most remote from the boiler-room, the pipes have
but 2 inches diameter.

The return water-pipes begin at this remote corner with 14 inch diam-
eter and are gradually enlarged as they receive the water of condensa-
tion from radiators and mains until they terminate in the receiver in the
boiler-room as above described.

Rising lines of pipes for warming the offices of the second and third
stories are attached to the horizontal piping, with suitable return-and-
relief and air-valve pipes.

The best provision is made in all lines of pipes for expansion and con-
traction by offsets, angles, or expansion joints, as the case requires.

The horizontal pipes are mainly supported on rollers. All joints of
pipes and fittings are made without the use of red lead or cement, the
threads being all tapered and exactly fitted so as to be tight when
simply screwed together, iron into iron.

Branch pipes extend out from the main pipes, and to these the valves
and pipes of 204 upright radiators are screwed. These are all finished
in bronze, and contain in the aggregate 13,600 square feet of radiating
surface, which give out the heat generated in the boilers.

The efliciency of the heating apparatus, though evident, was tested
by a series of observations made during the coldest weather of Christmas
week.

During the daytime, with the outside temperature at an average of
5° below zero, the interior temperature did not fall below 625° above
zero when but three of the four boilers were in use, the pressure of
steam being not above 12 pounds, and the consumption of coal 7,500
pounds, for twenty-four hours.

Observations were also made during the night-time, after all heat had
been purposely cut off from the building and the fires banked, with the
mean external temperature at 114° below zero, the temperature within
the building did not fall below 48° above zero. This is a creditable
result for the yet incomplete provisions taken against losses of heat by
the exposed surfaces.

The observation is also most gratifying that there is hardly any dif-
ference between the temperature on the main floor and that of the gal-
leries and occupied higher parts of the building abutting on the halls.

Thanks to the prompt and efficient co-operation of Col. Thos. L. Casey,
the engineer in charge of public grounds, the roads and lawns leading
to and surrounding the building were speedily adapted to new grades

and verdure restored.

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1880.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX is to furnish summaries of
scientific discovery in particular directions; occasional reports of the
investigations made by collaborators of the institution; memoirs of a
general character or on special topics, whether original and prepared
expressly for the purpose, or selected from foreign journals and proceed-
ings; and briefly to present (as fully as space will permit) such papers
not published in the ‘‘Smithsonian Contributions” or in the * Miscella-
neous Collections” which may be supposed to be of interest or value to
the numerous correspondents of the Institution.

180
RECORD OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS.

INTRODUCTION.

While it has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date in its history to enrich
the annual report required of them with scientific memoirs illustrating
the more remarkable and important developments in physical and bio-
logical discovery as well as the general character of the operations of
the Institution, this purpose has not hitherto been carried out on any
very systematic plan. Believing, however, that an annual report or
snmmary of the recent advances made in the leading departments of
scientific inquiry would supply a want very generally felt, and would
be favorably received by all those interested in the diffusion of knowl-
edge, the Secretary has had prepared by competent collaborators a
series of abstracts showing concisely the prominent features of recent
scientific progress in astronomy, geology, physics, chemistry, miner-
alogy, botany, zoology, and anthropology. Other subjects which might

properly have been included, such as those of terrestrial physics and

meteorology, geography and hydrography, microscopy, &c., as well as
the more practical topies of agricultural and horticultural economy, engi-
neering, technology, and industrial statistics have, for the present, been
omitted, both for want of time in which to have them properly digested
and for want of space to allow them any sufficient presentation. With
every effort to secure prompt attention to all the more important details
of such a work, various unexpected delays frequently render it imprac-
ticable to obtain all the desired reports in each department within the
time prescribed. In such cases it is designed, if possible, to bring up
such deficiencies and supply them in subsequent reports.

A similar digest, having the title of “Annual Record of Science and
Industry,” prepared under the general editorship of the present Secre-

volume for 1878. The present undertaking may, therefore, be considered
as in some sense a continuation of the work published by the Messrs.
Harper.

It is scarcely necessary to remark thatin arésumé of the annual pro-
gress of scientific discovery so condensed as the present, the wants of the
specialist in any branch can be but imperfectly supplied; and very many
items and details of great value to him must beentirely omitted. While
the student in a special field of knowledge may occasionally receive hints
that will be found of interest, he will naturally be led to consult for
fuller information the original journals and special periodicals from
which these brief notices or abstracts have been compiled.

The contemplated plan of devoting some 250 pages of the annual re-
port to such a compilation is not designed to preclude the introduction
into the “General Appendix,” as heretofore, of special monographs or
discussions that may prove interesting to the scientific student.

INTRODUCTION.

As the space available for the record of astronomical progress is com-
paratively small, the accounts here given must necessarily be the barest
summaries, whose chief end is to call attention to work which has been
done, in order that a reference may be made to more extended papers if
desired. At the same time it is clearly impossible to give a specitic ref-
erence to each of the papers consulted.

For such bibliographic information the reader is once for all referred
to DARBOUX et HounL’s Bulletin des Sciences Mathématiques et Astrono-
miques (monthly, Paris), to Nature (weekly, London), to Science (weekly,
New York), to the Observatory (monthly, London), and to other standard
journals. Free use has been made of reviews by writers in these and
other periodicals, particularly of the Record of Astronomy, published by
Dr. J. L. &. DREYER in the Scientific Proceedings of the Royal Dublin
Society.

NEBULZ AND CLUSTERS.

The Earl of RossE has published Parts 1 and 2 (0° to 14" R.A.) of
the ‘Observations of Nebulz and Clusters of Stars made with the six-
foot and three-foot reflectors at Birr Castle from the year 1848 up to
about the year 1878” (Trans. R. Dublin Soce., Vol. II). This publication
(of which the third part, comprising the last ten hours of R.A., is in
the press) embodies all the work done on nebule since the erection of
the six-foot telescope in 1845. In 1850 and 1861 abstracts of the observ-
ations on more interesting objects appeared in the Philosophical Trans-
actions, but all these abstracts are given over again in the new publica-
tion, with the sole exception of the copperplate engravings, to which,
however, in all cases references are made in the text. Though even now
not every single note in the observing ledgers is published, nothing has
been suppressed which can be of the slightest value or importance.
The observations are given in the observer’s own words, and the notes
which were added by Mr. DREYER while arranging the work for pub-
lication are easily distinguished by being inclosed in brackets. These
notes deal especially with questions of identification, and nearly all the new

nebule which were found at Birr Castle in the course of years and which
183

formed the weak point of HERSCHEL’S General Catalogue, have now by
re-examination and comparison with D’ARRES1T’S observations been iden-
tified and their positions determined. The work done during the last
five or six years (1872-78) differs in many particulars from the obser-
vations taken in earlier years, with which the paper of 1561 made the
scientific world acquainted. Most of the more important nebul having
been frequently drawn, there was latterly not much to be done in this
direction, but another important field was opened up by taking micro-
metric measures of groups of nebule, or of nebule and neighboring stars.
Tuto the text have been introduced diagrams of such groups or of a nebula
and the stars near it, while four plates contain lithographic reproduc-
tions of more elaborate sketches, which had not already been published
among the engravings in the former papers. How much more detail is
given in the new publication than in the paper of 1861 may be seen from
the circumstance that while the fourteen hours of R.A. in the latter only
cover 34 pages, in the new paper they extend over 129 pages.

A series of measurements of all the planetary nebulz has been com-
menced with the 15-inch refractor of the Harvard College Observatory.

Dr. C. H. F. PETERS has lately published in Urania an important
list of nebulz found on his ecliptic charts.

Photographs of the Nebula of Orion.— Prof. HENRY DRAPER distributed
in 1880 a large number of photographs of the nebula in Crion, taken by
means of his 11-inch Clark refractor with an exposure of 51 minutes.
Stars down to the 10th magnitude were shown and the details of the
more prominent masses of the central and brightest regions were for
the first time permanently and automatically registered. The work so
well begun has been brilliantly prosecuted, and in March, 1881, Dr.
DRAPER succeeded in obtaining fine photographs with an exposure of
140 minutes! These give a much greater extent to the nebulous por-
tions registered and bring out many details, and what is astonishing
they show stars whose magnitudes Prof. PICKERING has photometri-
cally determined to be from 14.0 to 14.7 of Pogson’s scale. The mini-
mum visibile cf an 11-inch telescope is about 14.2, so that it really ap-
pears that Dr. DRAPER has photographed stars which are very near
the limit of naked eye vision if not actually below it. The mechanical
perfection of the appliances which render such feats possible can only
be appreciated by those used to the apparatus furnished by the best
makers, which is far inferior to that made by Dr. DRAPER for his own
use.

FIXED STARS.

Fixed stars, catalogues of stars, star charts, double stars, binary stars,
variable stars, etc.—Decidedly the most important recent contribution of
observing astronomy is the “‘ Uranometria Argentina*” of Dr. GOULD.

*<* Resultados del Observatorio Nacional Argentina.” Vol. I, ‘‘ Uranometria Ar-
gentina,” Buenos Aires, 1879, 4to, with atlas.

ASTRONOMY. 185

This is the first astronomical publication of the national observatory of
the Argentine Republic.

One of the first objects of Dr. GOULD, on the establishment of the
new observatory in 1870, was the making of a uranometry of the southern
sky, which should contain the position and magnitude of every star
visible to the naked eye at his station.

The model on which it is made is the celebrated ‘ Uranometria nova,”
of ARGELANDER, of Bonn, which was published in 1843. The latter
contains 3,256 stars from the first to the sixth magnitude, which are to
be seen above the horizon of Bonn. Its magnitudes are expressed in
thirds of «a whole magnitude, and ARGELANDER’s scale, so established,
has served for a standard in all the observations in the northern hemi-
sphere. Dr. GOULD’s problem was to extend this enumeration over the
whole southern sky, keeping accurately to the standard set by ARGE-
LANDER. This is by no means an easy task, as the minimum visibile at
Cordoba was found to be not the 6.0 magnitude, but 7.1; that is, stars
can still be seen at Cordoba which have less than four-tenths of the
light of the faintest of ARGELANDER’s stars. This extraordinary trans-
parency of the atmosphere required the extension of ARGELANDER’S
scale downward, and that this was accomplished successfully is shown
by a comparison of the magnitudes of all the stars which are common
to the two uranometries. The mean difference is rather less than one-
tenth of a magnitude. The method of settling the standard was to
select from the ‘“ Uranometria nova” a belt of stars which had the same
altitude at Bonn and at Cordoba. The 722 stars of this belt were ob-
served by the four assistants at the southern observatory (Messrs. Rock
THOME, Davis, and HATHAWAY), and those stars for which their esti-
mated magnitudes were precisely the same were chosen for standards.
Thus, a number of stars of each magnitude, as 3.00, 3.33, 3.66, 4.00, 4.35,
ete., became types to be constantly referred to. From these types a
number of others in a zone near the south pole (and henee constantly
visible) were constructed. The process of observation consisted in re-
ferring each star in the heavens to this set of types, so that its magni-
tude could be finally determined upon. This was done by the four
observers independently, but often in duplicate, and so well were the
standards fixed that each observer’s comparisons differed from the mean
of all four by quantities very much less than a tenth of a magnitude.
It should be said that the magnitudes in the southern u:ianometry are
given to tenths.

In all there are 10,649 stars visible to the naked eye at Cordoba. Of
these, 8,198 are as bright or brighter than the 7.0 magnitude, and these
alone are given in the cacalogue and in the maps. Of these 10,000 stars
more than 46,000 observations were made. In the progress of the work
quite a number of variable stars were detected, of each of which a full
history is given in the notes. Indeed Dr. GoULD’s firm conviction is
186 ASTRONOMY

that “stellar variability is by no means an exceptional phenomenon,
but that at least one-half of the stars above the 7.0 magnitude vary
by amounts which careful observation cannot fail to detect.”

An atlas of fourteen charts accompanies the catalogue, and gives an
exact pictorial representation of the state of the sky at the epoch of the
work. Besides giving a representation of the isolated stars, the shad-
ings and gradations of the milky way are given with the greatest detail
from repeated observations and revisions. By no means the least valu-
able part of the work is the discussion of the course of the milky way
throughout the whole sky. The course of the galaxy is now, and only
now, known with precision. The data of this and preceding uranome-
tries are discussed by Dr. GOULD with reference to the question of the
distribution of the stars in space, starting from the assumption that, on
the whole, stars are equally scattered. Dr. GOULD finds that there is a
marked excess of the stars from the first to the fourth magnitude
Furthermore, he finds that there is in the sky a zone or belt of bright
stars as marked as the milky way, and that all the bright stars are dis-
tributed more symmetrically with respect to this belt than with regard
to the milky way itself. From these facts Dr. GOULD concludes that
‘‘our own solar system forms a part of a small cluster distinct from the
vast organization of that which forms the milky way.” This cluster may
perhaps be comparable with that of the Pleiades, since by a rough esti-
mate it would seem to consist of about 500 stars. It is situated nearly
in the plane of the belt of bright stars.

No more valuable work than this has been given to astronomy within
the decade; and it will be a source of pride to Americans to find such
important contributions coming from one of their countrymen in the
southern hemisphere, with which the name of GILLISS was already in-
dissolubly associated.

There are no marks about the work itself which would show that it
was done in a community in about the state of Europe during the dark
ages, and it will add, not to the value of the work, but to the credit of
the workers, if one remembers that this is strictly the case.

Dr. AUWERS has published, for the zone committee of the Astronom-
ische Gesellschaft, an important work, “Fundamental Catalog fiir die
Zonen-Beobachtungen am nordlichen Himmel.” (Leipzig, Engelmann,
4to.) This catalogue of 539 stars, on which the places of all the stars
between —2° and +80° Decl. down to the 9th mag. inclusive will de-
pend, is founded on the following systems of standard places: Pulkova,
1845 and 1865; MS. of Pulkova Observations, 186974; MS. of Bradley’s
Stars from Greenwich Observations 1836~72 on the system of the first
7-year Catalogue; Greenwich 9-year Catalogue; Harvard College Ob-
servatory, vol. x; Engelmann’s Declinations, 1866~70; Leiden Declina-
tions, 186470.

At the Berlin meeting of the Astronomische Gesellschaft reports on
ASTRONOMY. 187

the zone observations were read. The following account is taken from

Dr. DREYER’s report. Much progress has been made since then.

A second edition of the Washington Catalogue of Stars has been
jssued. Since the first edition was published in 1873, Professor YAR-
NALL had accumulated many observations, which he, before retiring
from the Observatory, embodied in a second edition. Many stars which
had only been observed once or twice, either in right ascension or de-
clination, were thus re-examined. The author died suddenly, on Feb-
ruary 27, 1879, the comp!ete volume only reaching him a few moments
before his death.

Dr. ROBINSON has published ‘Places of 1,000 Stars, observed at the
Armagh Observatory.” The stars are those of the fainter ones in the.
“‘ Histoire Céleste” (nearly all between 6th and 7.5 mag.), which have
not been recently observed at other observatories. The instruments at
Armagh not being optically powerful enough for this work, the mural
circle was furnished with a new telescope having an object-glass of seven
inches aperture. The observations were all made by the Rev. Cu. Farts,
in the years 1868~76, each star being observed four or five times. Only
the mean results are given.

The first volume of the second series of the ‘“‘ Annales de ’Observa-
toire de Bruxelles” contains an ‘*“‘ Uranométrie Générale,” by M. Hou-
188 ASTRONOMY.

ZEAU. During a stay in Jamaica the author resolved to form a new
Uranometry, which should possess the advantage above all others hith-
erto published, that it was to be the work of asingle individual, observ-
ing all the stars in both hemispheres visible to the naked eye within a
short space of time. He accordingly commenced working on January
28, 1875, and the work was finished on February 28, 1876. He had first
prepared maps, on which all the stars were plotted down without regard
to magnitude; then every region was gone over two or three times, and
the magnitudes carefully estimated, the six usual classes being used,
but each class only divided into two halves. The atlas thus formed
consists of five plates, on which the stars, their letters, the names and
limits of the constellations (but not their figures), and the milky way
are depicted. The latter has been attended to with great care, the
deeper or paler hue of the light-green color representing greater or lesser
brightness. The catalogue of stars for 1880 contains 5,719 stars. M.
HouzEAv has examined the distribution of the stars in four ways: 1,
with respect to the solar equator; 2, with respect to the direction of the
sun’s proper motion; 3, perpendicular to this direction; 4, with respect
to the milky way. No law whatever was found in the first three ways,
while the fourth mode of proceeding confirmed W. STRUVE’S conclusion
that the density of stellar layers parallel to the plane of the milky way
decreases very regularly and gradually towards the poles of the latter.

JULIUS SCHMIDT has, in continuation of his researches on the colors of
stars, published an extensive series of color estimations, made chiefly
with the finder of the Athens refractor, from 1872~78. Only for Arc-
turus has he been able, with any certainty, to find a variation of color.
It is mostly very bright stars he has observed, and he investigates the
difference in the estimation, according to whetber the finder or the re-
fractor was used, and finds a greater difference the nearer the color is to
white.

A “new star” of 8.8 mag. was found in November by Mr. BAXEN-
DELL, according to two Dun Eecht observations in 7° 34™ 458.67 - 8° 59!
39.6 (1879.0). According to VOGEL, the spectrum is very remarkable.
with many dark bands, especially in the more refrangible part.

PARALLAX OF STARS.

Nearly the whole of Part III of the “‘ Astronomical Observations and
Researches made at Dunsink” is devoted to annual parallax. The first
paper contains a discussion of observations ot the planetary nebula H.
IV. 37 from August, 1871, to August, 1872, by Dr. BRUNNOW. The
nebula has in the center a well-defined point resembling a star of the
eleventh magnitude. This was compared in declination with a star
of the tenth magnitude, and the parallax was found to be perfectly in-
sensible, a result which agrees well with that of a similar series of ob-
servations by Professor BREDICHIN, of Moscow.

A notice of a% elaborate paper by Dr. ELKIN on the parallax of Alpha
ASTRONOMY. 189

Centauri must be deferred till the next year, as the paper is not now
before the writer.

A new determination of the parallax of 61 Cygni, by Dr. BALL, forms
the subject of the next paper. This determination differs from others
on the same object in one particular, viz, that the preceding star instead
of the following one has been observed. The method of observation
used is that of differences of declination, and the observations were
made on thirty-five different nights between July 3, 1877, and June 1,
1878. The resulting parallax is 0.465, in pretty good accordance with
the results of BESSEL (last three months 0.54), SrRUVE (0.51), and
AUWERS (0/.56).

A third paper, also by Dr. BALL, describes the first results of a series
of reconnoitering observations in search of stars with a large annual par-
allax. These observations are only intended to reveal large parallaxes
(0.7) or more, and each object is only observed twice a year with six
months’ interval, when it is 90° from the sun, and at the two extremities
of the major axis of the parallactic ellipse. The paper contains the dis-
cussion of the observations of forty-two objects, chiefly red and variable
stars. The result is that in almost every case the parallax is certainly
less than 1’, and most probably does not exceed 0.5. These objects will
therefore not be observed any further, but it is Dr. BALL’s intention to
continue this kind of observations. His working list contains red and
variable stars, stars with a large proper motion, and others chosen for
various reasons, nearly all north of the 30° parallel.

According to Herr GEELMUYDEN, of Christiania, the star Arg. Oeltzen,
11677, has a perceptible parallax (A. N. 2237). This star of the ninth
magnitude has a proper motion of —0%.507 and + 0.21. The resulting
parallax, 0’’.27 from measures of Aa and 0.24 from measures of Ad with
a star preceding, is only considered provisional, but the subject seems
worth following up.

DOUBLE STARS.

In 1841 and 1842 the Pulkova refractor was used for an examination of
the northern hemisphere in search of double stars. The second part of
the catalogue thus formed embraces systems, the components of which
are of or above the eighth mag., and the distance between which are
from 32” to 2’. Most of these objects have never been observed micro-
metrically, and the series of heliometer measures of some of them, which
Dr. ScHuR, of Strassburg, publishes in the A. N. 2255-56, will there-
fore be of interest, though only comprising a small number of objects.
Systems closer than 40’ were measured by quadruple distances, wider
pairs by double distances. By means of an artificial pair of stars it was
found that the position angle had no appreciable influence on the meas-
ures of distance, and that the two methods of measuring the distances
showed no constant difference.

Volume XLIV of the Memoirs of R. A. 8. contains a very extensive
work by Mr. BurNuAM: “ Double-star observations made in 1877~78,
190 ASTRONOMY.

at Chicago, with the 184-inch refractor of the Dearborn Observatory,
comprising: [. A Catalogue of 251 New Double Stars with Measures;
II. Micrometrical Measures of 500 Double Stars.”

Up to afew years ago the Dearborn refractor, with which CLARK
discovered the companion of Sirius in 1862, was idle. It has, however,
since, in the hands of Mr. BURNHAM, done excellent work. Confining
himself to the subject of double stars this distinguished observer has,
in the course of six or seven years, first working with a 6-inch, after-
wards using the 184 inch refractor, made this subject his own to an ex-
tent that is truly surprising. Though many observations are yearly
being taken of double stars by a good many observers, the study of
these important objects is by no means being furthered to the extent
one should have expected from the vast amount of time and labor ex-
pended. As Mr. BURNHAM justly remarks, in the preface to the paper
we are here considering, many observers have gone on from year to
year observing over and over again the same familiar stars, of which
Castor, 7 Virginis, « Lyre may be cited as examples. Couples which
small instruments of three or four inches aperture would show suffi-
ciently well are thus again and again being observed with fine refrac-
tors of six or seven inches aperture or upwards, while a very great
number of stars are hardly ever if at all looked for. ‘Omit the observa-
tions of DEMBOWSKI and O. STRUVE and our knowledge of nine-tenths
of the double stars would not be materially advanced in the last thirty
years.” Mr. BURNHAM has from the beginning shown that he does not
follow the ordinary beaten track, and his numerous discoveries of close
and difficult pairs have proved him to be an unusually sharp-sighted
and attentive observer. In nine previous lists he had given the places
of 482 new double stars, mostly rather difficult pairs, which few would
have discovered with a 6-inch refractor. The preseut (tenth) list of 251
new objects raises the total number of new double stars discovered by
Mr. BURNHAM to 733; of these 251 stars, 75 pairs are less than 1” apart.
His observations of old double stars embrace chiefly such ones which
require a large aperture to be brought out well, or which have not been
recently observed by others. Particular attention has also been paid to
certain difficult pairs discovered by Mr. ALVAN G. CLARK.

No. 5 of the publications of the Cincinnati Observatory contains * Mi-
crometrical Measurements of 1,054 Double Stars from January 1, 1878,
to September 1, 1879.” Though the discovery of new double stars has
only been considered a secondary object, nearly 200 new pairs have been
detected during the progress of the work at Cincinnati. The measures
are all given in full detail and occupy 151 pages; the mean results are
given separately.

The systematic errors in measures of double stars have been investi-
gated by Professor THIELE in a paper: “Castor, Calcul du mouvement
relatif et Critique des observations de cette étoile double.” (Copen-
hagen, 1879.) The author has chosen Castor partly because the orbital
ASTRONOMY. 191

motion is slow and can be represented by a simple formula of interpola-
tion, partly because it has been very frequently measured by almost all
observers of double stars. First, three normal places were formed which
represented the distances and position angles observed since 1815, and
an angle of position from BRADLEY’s and W. HERSCHEL’S measures.
From these and the ratio of the sector to the time, formulz for computing
distance and position angle as functions of time by means of the eecen-
tric anomaly were derived and an ephemeris computed from 1718 to
1900. With this ephemeris all individual observations by every obser-
ver were compared and the mean error determined for every observer
within.a period during which he might be supposed not te have changed
his way of measuring. Every observer is now followed from one period
to another and the changes in the mean error determined, whereby vari-
ations in his systematic error reveal themselves.

Dr. SEELIGER has made an elaborate examination of MADLER’s
measures (A. N. 2288). MADLER’s distances appear to be considerably
less accurate than O. STRUVE’s, while his position angles do not appear
to have larger mean errors than those of O. STRUVE.

The most important series of double-star measures published since
Mensure micrometrice is that given in Volume IX of the Pulkeva Ob-
servations, comprising the work of OTTO STRUVE with the 15-inch
refractor since about 1840. An elaborate introduction details the
observations of artificial double stars and the method of applying the
corrections thus obtained to the measures of real stars. Section I is
devoted to the re-measurement of a large number of the most interest-
ing of the stars forming the catalogue of the elder SrRuvE. Section
II contains the measures of nearly all the stars of the revised edition
of the Pulkova catalogue of 1850, and about thirty additional pairs dis-
covered subsequently (02 515 to 547). The only other systematic observa-
tions of these stars were made by the late Baron DEMBOWSKI about
1860. As many of these pairs are rapid binary systems, and nearly all
of them interesting from the closeness and inequality of the components,
the Pulkova measures, giving earlier epochs, are specially valuable.

A valuable contribution to the literature of this department, and sec-
ond to none in practical value to the observer, is FLAMMARION’S “Cata-
logue des Etoiles doubles et multiples en mouvement relatif certain.”
This work contains a complete list of all double stars the components of
which have shown any decided change either from orbital or proper
motion, with all the published micrometrical measures down to 1878,
arranged in chronological order, and notes as to the character and extent
of the motion, the most recently computed orbits of binaries, ete. As a
working list for the practical observer it is specially valuable, since the
stars which most need observing can be at once selected.

The ‘“‘Hand-Book of Double Stars,” by Messrs. CRossLEY, GLED-
HILL, and WILSON, published in 1879, in addition to an extensive cata-
- -

192 ASTRONOMY.

logue of binary and other interesting stars by Mr. GLEDHILL, compris-
ing altogether some fifteen hundred objects, contains chapters on the
equatorial and the observatory by Mr. CROSSLEY; on methods of observ-
ing and the instruments which have been used in this work by Mr. GLED-
HILL; on mnicrometers by Mr. CROSSLEY; on the methods of computing
double-star orbits, analytically and graphically, by Mr. WILSON and Dr.
DoBERCK, and the bibliography of the subject by Mr. GLEDHILL. The
catalogue is conveniently arranged in order of R. A., but the measures
of each star are placed opposite the names of the respective observers,
an arrangement far less convenient than a simple chronological one.
On the whole the work is an excellent one, and contains many valuable
suggestions to amateurs, not ordinarily found in astronomical books.
Professor HOLDEN has tabulated the magnitudes and colors of 162
stars which are certainly binary, according to a list furnished by Mr.
BURNHAM, and finds that of these the components of 122 binary stars of
the same color differ in magnitude on the average only 0™ 5, whilst those
of 40 of different colors differ 2™4. The colors and magnitudes are for
the most part taken from M. SrRUVE’s estimations. Professor HOLDEN
quotes a conclusion by Dr. HuGGINS and Professor MILLER that the
characteristic colors of stars are due to the absorptive action of their
atmospheres, and compares it with the two following facts: (1) The color

of a solid body cooling would as it cooled pass through the shades white, °

yellow, orange, red, but not through green, blue, or purple. (2) Wedo not
find isolated stars of decided green, blue, or purple colors. A few such
have been recorded, but in most cases erroneously. In general such
stars are small, and apparently invariably associated with larger stars.
That is, the isolated stars appear always of the colors which would arise
in the cooling of solid or liquid masses, and never as if necessarily sur-
rounded with absorptive atmospheres—i. e., never decided violet or
purple.

Professor PICKERING has published a paper on the Actual Dimen-
sions of the Fixed Stars, in which the hypothesis that stars are of equal
intrinsic brillianey is made the basis of computation. While this hypoth-
esis is perhaps as little objectionable as any general one that can be made,
it still leads to conclusions which cannot be at once accepted, as has
been shown by Professor HOLDEN in a paper extending Professor PIck-
ERING’S work.

Variable stars.—F or some years it has been generally received that
the star Alpha Urse Majoris periodically changed its coler from yellow
through red to orange, etc., every thirty-two days. This supposed dis-
covery was made in 1867, by KLEIN, and has been confirmed; or at least
not disproved, by several subsequent observers.

This question is now tolerably well settled by SAFARIK, who has
chosen three other stars to observe simultaneously with this. He has
ASTRONOMY. 193

shown that the variations in a Urse are no greater than in the case of
these three stars, which are pretty certainly constant in color, and he
gives it as his opinion that a Urs must be considered also as of a con-
stant color, unless we are willing to admit that all stars are variable in
tint in short periods of time. This result is of more importance than at
first sight appears, as we have now no well authenticated case of varia-
tion of color separate from variation in brilliance.

Dr. GYLDEN, of Stockholm, has recently published a mathematical
investigation, in which he shows the possibility of explaining the ob-
served variation in the light of stars upon pure mechanical principles.
He takes. as a basis the idea that the surfaces of such stars are covered
in parts with a kind of crust or slag, which gives out less light than the
remaining parts of the surface, which are glowing. Further, he sup-
poses these stars to be rotating on their axes, and he shows that such a
rotation will account for all the phenomena, particularly as the axis of
rotation will itself be changed from time to time by the different dispo-
sition of the floating masses on the surface. It is noteworthy that the
possibility of such an explanation was first suggested by Sir WILLIAM
HEBRCHEL.

THE SUN.

A new determination of the inclination of the ecliptic is contained in
the doctor-dissertation by E. F. VAN DE SANDE BAKHUYZEN, of the
Leiden Observatory. The author discusses the declinations of the sun
observed in Leiden in the years 1864~’76, and enters into all details re-
lating to the instrument used, ete. He finds that the inclination for
1870 as given in LEVERRIER’S tables should be diminished by about
0.30. This result agrees well with OPPOLZER’S inclination for 1815
brought down to 1870, with a secular diminution as found by means of
the latest values of the planetary masses.

A review of the new or modified theory of the constitution of the
sun, proposed by Dr. HASTINGS, is necessarily postponed for want of
the necessary space to detail his arguments. It may be briefly said,
however, that no theory of the sun’s constitution previously proposed can
account for all the facts of both spectroscopic and telescopic observation ;
and it is clamed by Dr. HASTINGS with good show of reason that his
hypothesis does this satisfactorily. It was published in the American
Journal of Science, and will doubtless receive the consideration asked
for it.

Sun parallaxr.—Several determinations of the solar parallax have been
lately published. From his observations of Mars, made at Ascension
Island in 1877, Mr. GInu finds z= 8.78 (M.N. June, 1879). At the same
opposition Mr. MAXWELL HALL, in Jamaica, made similar observations
of the displacement of Mars in R. A. (Mem. R. A. S., XLIV.) Heused
an equatorial of four inches aperture. Mr. HALL has carefully reduced

S. Mis. 31——13
194 ASTRONOMY.

his observations, and the resulting parallax, 8’’.79, indicates that val-
uable results may be obtained by this method by small instruments.

Observations of the declination of Mars made in 1877 at Leyden and
Melbourne have been used by Mr. DowninG to find a value for the solar
parallax. The result is 8.96 (A. N. 2283). It is remarkable how well
this agrees with STONE’S and WINNECKE’s results from the opposition
of 1862 (8.93 and 8’’.96).

Vol. 1, part 3, of the “Astronomical Papers prepared for the use of
the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac,” containing the experi-
ments upon the velocity of light, made by Master A. A. MICHELSON,
U.S. N., has just been published. His method of investigation (an im-
proved form of FoOUCAULT’S method) is described in the section on
‘¢ Physics.”

The final value for the velocity of light in vacuo is 299,944 + 51 (in
air, 299,864), or, in round numbers, 299,940 kilometers per second =
186,380 miles per second, the remarkably small error, + 51 kilometers,
being composed of the total constant error in the most unfavorable case,
and the probable errors of observation. This quantity, + 51 kilometers,
cannot be said to express the probable error of the determination, in the
ordinary acceptance of the term; combining, as it does, accidental errors,
strictly speaking, and estimated constant errors.

These experiments were made by Master MICHELSON at the Naval
Academy, Annapolis, at private expense, and to him the entire credit
is due. A new determination of the velocity of light, embodying es-
sentially the same arrangement, but with more elaborate and expensive
apparatus, has been completed by Professor NEWCoMB, superintendent
of the Nautical Almanac; and this combined with a revised constant
of aberration, will give the best value of the Solar Parallax.

Transit of Venus December 6, 1882.—The Astronomer Royal has pointed
out the best stations to be occupied for observations of the next Transit
of Venus.

Ingress accelerated can be well observed in Cape Colony, Africa. Mr.
GILL will soon determine his longitude telegraphically.

Tngress retarded should be observed in the West Indies. These longi-
tudes have been determined already by officers of the United States
Navy.

Egress accelerated may be observed at the West India stations and
along the east coast of the United States.

Egress retarded: Stations in New Zealand are best suited, although
Australian stations will serve.

SOLAR ECLIPSES.

Professor NEwcomB has published a paper “On the recurrence of
Solar Eclipses, with Tables of Eclipses from B. ¢., 700 to A. D. 2300”
ASTRONOMY. 195

(Washington, 1879, 4to). The theory is founded on two remarkable and
hitherto unnoticed chance relations connected with the Saros. This
eycle takes account only of the mean motions of the Sun and Moon, but
in consequence of the eccentricity of the orbits the Sun may be 2° on
either side of its mean place, andthe Moon 5°. The relative position of
the two bodies may therefore vary 7° from their mean position at any
time, and recurring eclipses might be expected to differ widely from the
predicted time, or might not occur at ali. But, as a matter of fact, this
is not the ease, the irregularities being reduced almost to nothing by
the following remarkable relations. At the end of a Saros, not only
are the Sun, the Moon, and the node found nearly in their original rela-
tion, but the mean anomaly of the Moon happens to have the same value
to less than 3°, and the mean anomaly of the Sun toabout 12°. There-
fore, not only the mean place of the Moon, but all its larger inequalities,
will return nearly to their original values at the end of the period. This
will hold true, not only with respect to the time of the eclipse, but also
with respect to its character, as the parallax and semi-diameter of the
Moon must also return nearly to their original values. On account of
the retrocession of 28’.6 in the the argument of latitude in each cycle,
the corresponding eclipses in successive cycles are subject to a progres-
sive change. A series of such eclipses commences with a very small
eclipse near one pole of the earth; gradually increasing for about eleven
recurrences, it will become central near the same pole. Forty or more
central eclipses will then recur, the central line moving slowly towards
the other pole. The series will then become partial, and finally cease
altogether. The entire duration of the series will be more than a
thousand years, and a new series commences on an average at intervals
of thirty years. All eclipses may therefore be divided into sets, the
separate eclipses of each set being separated by intervals of one 18-year
eycle, and extending through sixty or seventy cycles. Moreover, from
the elements of the central eclipse of each set those of any other of the
same set may be readily found by applying the changes corresponding
to the number of intervals which separate it from the central one. This
circumstance Prof. NeEwcoms has utilized to form a series of tables
which give at once the cirenmstances of any eclipse between B. Cc. 700
and A. D. 2300.

Phenomena attending Solar eclipses.—The whole subject of the charac-
teristics of solar eclipses is in so undecided a state that even those who
are most familiar with it are conscious of their incomplete knowledge
of the data. A general review of the evidence on special points has
been well nigh impossible. Like all comparatively new problems, the
different branches of the research have been developed in quite an
irregular way. On some lines of research our knowledge is very con-
siderable; on others, we have scarcely any trustworthy information.

This was specially a hindrance in the study of the phenomena of solar
196 ASTRONOMY.

eclipses, because it is just here that we may hope for striking advances
within a few years. And it is necessary, in order to plan our future
work, to know what has already been settled, and along what lines of
study results are to be sought. A recent publication of Mr. RANYARD’S,
on the phenomena of “Solar Eclipses,” is intended to meet these difti-
culties. Mr. RANYARD has collected, in Vol. XLI of the ‘‘ Memoirs of the.
Royal Astronomical Society” (792 pages, 18 plates, and a great number
of wood cuts) all the accounts of solar eclipses which have been pub-
lished from the earliest times up to 1878. Hach account is cut up into
parts, as it were, and the matter of each part is inserted in its proper
chronological order, under one of forty-four headings, chosen by Mr.
RANYARD with great care. Each heading constitutes a chapter, and
the chapters are arranged about in the order in which the phenomena
of which they treat occur. Thus the chapters relating to the phenomena
near first contact have for titles: Chapter VII. “The Cusps of the
Solar Crescent seen as colored.” Chapter VIII. “The Moon seen as red
before Totality.” Chapter LX. “Shadow-Bands;” etc., etc. Perhaps the
most important chapters are numbered XLI, XLII, XLII, XLIV: On
“The Brightness of the Corona,” on “ Polaroscopic and Spectroscopic
Observations,” and on “Photographs and Drawings of the Corona,”
respectively. The last chapter consists of 238 pages, and contains a
reproduction of every important modern drawing. <A very good feature
of the wood cuts is that the axis of the sun is made vertical on the page,
and the sun’s vertex is marked also. The plates relate to the spectrum
of the corona, ete., and to the photographs, ete., of the total phase.
We are glad to notice that due credit is here given to Dr. BuscH, who
first took a daguerreotype of the corona in 1851, at Kénigsberg. The
very varied material contained in the volume is made available by an
elaborate subject and author index, and the chief problems which Mr.
RANYARD set to himself are resolved. These were: 1. To give in the
order of time all of the important observations on each of the main
topics of study ; 2. To enable the work of any particular individual to
be examined; and, 3. To enable each solar eclipse to be studied by itself
if desired.

The work has required about nine years for its preparation, and is
practically complete. We have simply to add to the data there given,
and need never go back of it. In general there is no complete discussion
of the results to be derived from each chapter, and this reserve seems
wise. In some cases the necessary conclusions are pointed out, always,
it seems, with moderation. Itis an unfortunate consequence of this kind
of semi-bibliographical work that it will be severely criticised. Each
chapter will appear inadequate to the specialist in the subject of which
it treats. There can be no doubt but that Mr. RANYARD has succeeded
in his most difficult task, and that this publication will forward the
solution of the most pont questions involved, in a very marked
ASTRONOMY. 197

way. The work comes at exactly the right time, and satisfactorily fills
its place.

A very elaborate paper on the polarization of the corona, by Dr.
ScHUSTER, is published in the M. N. for December, 1879. This paper
shows how combined measures of the polarization at different distances
‘from the Sun, and of the decrease in intensity of the total light of the
corona with inereasing distance from the Sun, may inform us in what
way the scattering matter is distributed in the solar atmosphere, what
part of the light sent out by the coronais due to scattering matter, and
whether the latter is projected outwards from, or is falling into the Sun
from outside.

Mr. LEONARD WALDO has published a report on the observations of
the solar eclipse of July, 1878, made at Fort Worth, Texas, by a party of
which he was the leading member.* An attempt was made to obtain
photographie evidence of the polarization of the corona by inserting a
double-image prism between the lenses of a camera. The photographs
obtained in this way were examined by Prof. PICKERING, who found
inequalities in them, which, as far as they go, tend to indicate tangential
polarization; but in the opinion of Dr. HASTINGS the evidence is not
conclusive. The inner corona was seen by Mr. SEAGRAVE about 30° be-
fore totality. Mr. PULSIFER, using a ten-prism spectroscope attached
to a four-inch CLARK refractor, and keeping the slit tangential, observed
the reversal of the Frauenhofer lines at the commencement of totality.
From the length of these lines, which only reached one-third across the
spectrum, the tangential thickness of the reversing layer was found, and
from this Mr. PULSIFER infers its minimum height above the photo-
sphere to be 524 miles. The © line was not shortened like the others,
but extended right across the spectrum.

The Naval Observatory at Washington, has published the reports
relating to the total solar eclipses of 1878 and 1880 in a large 4°
volume of 416 pp., accompanied by 25 wood cuts of drawings made
by observers and 30 chromolithographed plates. This important vol-
ume has been edited by Prof. HARKNESS, who has provided a com-
plete index of persons (4 pages) and index of subjects (6 pages), besides
a table of contents of 9 pages. It is worth while to mention these
indexes, because their presence seems to be an indication that men
of science are beginning to avail themselves of devices which have
long been considered indispensable to even the simplest literary per-
formance, and which in the nature of things are still more necessary to
technical and scientific writings. This special work, however, deserves
a careful review for many reasons, principally in that it is decidedly the
most important contribution which has ever been made to the literature
of any single eclipse, not excepting the memoirs of DE LA RuE, of La-
MONT, and the report of the Austrian Commission on the Aden eclipse.

* Cambridge, Mass. (J Wilson and Son), 1879. to.
198 ASTRONOMY.

The solar eclipse of 1878 is noteworthy, since it was visible over a large
portion of civilized country, each part of which it was easy to reach by
cheap transportation. The Congress of the United States also placed
the sum of $8,000 at the disposition of the Naval Observatory, which
was expended in providing the necessary instruments and in placing
men and instruments in the proper field. The expenses of 27 observ-
ers—mostly astronomers at various universities or colleges—were paid,
wholly or in part, from this sum. This governmental action is note-
worthy in the history of the country, as indicating the means by which
alone government aid to science can be afforded under our form of ad-
ministration, and it would seem that the question of the “endowment
of research,” which has been agitating Great Britain, has here been
quietly solved. The Naval Observatory accounted to the Treasury for
the money, and the funds were spent in placing its own parties and
those headed by all the eminent astronomers of the country in the field,
and under its auspices liberal arrangements with the customs depart-
ment and the railways were made for the benefit of foreigners.

To come to the most important particulars of the volume before us:
It is preceded by the elaborate Instructions to Observers, compiled by
Prof. HARKNESS, of which it may be said that it is the most complete,
and on the whole the most satisfactory, which we have. Guided by
these instructions, the amateur observers prepared their sketches of the
corona and made their observations.

In previous eclipses the principal point to be noted in regard to such
sketches has been that each sketch differed so much from every other
that only a knowledge of the circumstances under which they were
made could allow one to believe that they were representations of the
same phenomenon. Here, however, so many sketches were made, each
one readily comparable with the photographs made by the parties of
Professors HALL, HARKNESS, and HOLDEN, that for the first time a
kind of order ean be evolved from what has previously been but chaos.
The photographs serve always as a standard, and it is seen that each
sketch represents (and exaggerates) one or more special features, the
other features remaining unnoted. Thus, by combining the whole set
a very fair general representation can be had. This is one most impor-
tant lesson. The photographs themselves are of the highest excellence.
The parties of Prof. HALL and of Prof. HARKNESS were provided with
complete outfits, and each secured a series of photographs of exposures
varying from 3 to 60 seconds. The pictures with the shortest expos-
ures give the details of the corona near the Sun; those of longer ex-
posures giving details further out. In these latter pictures the inner
corona is much over-exposed, and its details are thus lost; but by a
combination of the set the whole can be built up out to the distance

_of 20’ from the Sun’s edge.

A single photograph was taken by Prof. HOLDEN’s party, which ad-

mirably supplements the others, as it begins where the others leave
ASTRONOMY. 199

off and carries the picture of the corona out to 60/ from the Sun’s limb.
Thus the pictures made by the Naval Observatory parties cover the
whole ground, and are far more complete than those of any previous
eclipse. They are not adequately discussed, however, in the volume be-
fore us, which is the less excusable as Mr. RANYARD in his recent work
on Solar Eclipses has given a practical example of how such work should
be done.

Some idea of the fullness with which these collected reports treat
nearly everything which can be made the subject of observation may be
had by a glance at the subject-index. For example, the contacts were
observed at over twenty stations by more than twenty-five observers.
Descriptions of the corona are given on thirty-nine different pages, and
these do not include the thirty or more drawings. Nearly every one or
the phenomena is attested by more than one observer of the many en-
gaged. Thus the corona was seen before or after totality at six stations.
Ten persons swept in the vicinity of the Sun for the discovery of Vul-
can. Prof. WATSON reports the discovery of two planets, Mr. Swirr
that of two different ones, making four in all, seen or suspected. The
report shows that four persons swept over the place of WATSON’S (a)
without seeing any planet there, and four also swept over the place
of Swift’s two, also without seeing them. In all these cases the tel-
escopes were of adequate power to have shown the objects of WATSON
and SWIFT.

The main results of the eclipse of 1878 may be summed up much as
follows:

The connection between the activity of the Sun’s surface, as evinced
by the number and size of the spots and protuberances, and the nature
of the corona, has been again shown. The corona in 1878 was far sim-
pler in general character than those of 1869 and 1870. It was observed
to extend to a much greater distance from the Sun in this eclipse than
in any other, but this is probably due to specially advantageous circum-
stances. Professors NEwcomB and LANGLEY both observed the corona
with the naked eye, extending 5° or 6° from the Sun’s center. There is
much difference of opinion as to the brightness of this corona; it prob-
ably was not materially fainter than that of 1869. Photometric observa-
tions were made at Pike’s Peak upon this point, but there are no earlier
observations easily comparable. The mostimportant point of difference
between the coronas of 1869 and 1878 was in their spectra. The bright
lines due to the gaseous parts were conspicuous in 1869, while in 1875
they were so faint as only to be seen by a few observers, though these
lines were undoubtedly present. A continuous spectrum was seen by
most spectroscopic observers. The 1474 line was seen at the beginning

. and end of the eclipse, but only a few observers saw it during the whole
of totality. Prof. EASTMAN traced this line all round the Sun, find-
ing it equally bright at equal distances from the center, and what is re-
markable, finding no defect in the brightness of this line in the points
200 ASTRONOMY.

where absolutely no corona was visible to the naked eye or to photo-
graphs. No new bright lines were visible in the coronal spectrum. A
new line (K. 534) in the chromosphere was discovered by Prof. Rock-
Woop, who, as well as Prof. YOUNG, saw both lines brightly reversed.
Prof. BARKER and others saw the Frauenhofer lines (dark) in the cor-
onal spectrum; they were very faint. The polarization of the corona
was observed by several parties. The photographie observations of Pro-
fessors HARKNESS and WRIGHT show it to be radial in direction. Prof.
HASTING’S eye observations give tangential polarization. Such are the
main facts of observation to be derived from the volumein question. It
is yet tov soon to state the bearing of these facts upon existing theories
or to deduce any general conclusions from them.

COMETS.

The following comets were visible in 1879:

A. BRORSEN’S periodic comet was first seen by TEMPEL on January
14, and on February 26 by TEBBUTT. It passed the perihelion on March
30, and was observed till the end of May. It was found more than a
month earlier than Dr. SCHULZE’S ephemeris commenced.

B. TEMPEL’s periodic comet was first seen by him on April 24, and was
observed until the end of June. It passed the perihelion on May 7, ac-
cording to Mr. RAOUL GAUTIER’S elements.

C. Swirt found a pretty bright comet on June 16, which was inde-
pendently discovered by WINNECKE on June 21. It was observed till
August 23.

D. PALISA discovered a pretty bright comet on August 21, which was
seen as late as October 12 (the date of the perihelion passage).

i. Another comet was first seen by HaARTWwiG on August 24. The last
observation seems to be from September 14.

The spectrum of BRORSEN’S comet appeared this year very different
from what it was in 1868. It consisted of three bands, the central one
the brightest, and the least refrangible one exceedingly faint. The
wave-lengths as determined by YOUNG, were 468+ 2, 51741, and 55843.
The abnormat character of the spectrum in 1868 (which only one other
comet, that of BO RELLY, ¢. 1877, has exhibited), has therefore disap-
peared, and the comet has now the ordinary specirum.*

The following comets were visible in 1880:

Comet A, 1880, was first seen, probably, at the Cape of Good Hope,
February 1. It has been usually spoken of as the Great Southern Comet.
Dr. B. A. GOULD, of Cordoba, Argentine Republic, says: “ It was bright-
est February 7 or 8, when its length was 40° and its, breadth 14°, but
its brightness not superior to that of the Milky Way in Taurus.” An-
other observer says: ‘The portion of the taal visible was about 34° in’
length and 2° in width, its long, straight, narrow form resembling the

ASTRONOMY. 201

one of 1843, which I remember well, although it was inferior in length

and brillianey to that famous comet.” February 4 the head of the comet

was 3 minutes of are in diameter, as reported by Dr. GOULD, who also

computed the elements of its orbit and found them to agree well with

those computed by Hinp. The elements of the orbit of this comet

agreed very closely with the one of 1843. They are compared below:

Mr. HIND, in communicating these results to the Astronomer Royal
of England, says: ‘Can it be possible that there is such a comet in the
system aimost grazing the Sun’s surface, in perihelion, and revolving in
less than thirty-seven years? I confess I feel a difficulty in admitting
it, notwithstanding the above extraordinary resemblance of orbits.”
The appearance of this great comet has again revived the discussions
of a resisting medium in space. Prof. OPPOLZER, of Vienna, has pub-
lished recently two important papers on this theme. TH. BREDICHIN,
of Moscow Observatory, Russia, has computed the numerical value of
the repulsive force necessary to produce the enormous tail of this comet,
and finds it to belong to the same type of those of 1680, 1744, 1769. I
am not aware that any observations by the spectroscope were had dur-
ing the late appearance of this comet.

Comet B was discovered by J. M. SCHAEBERLE, assistant at the Ann
Arbor Observatory, April 6, and its train was easily seen, and was three
minutes in length. On the 16th it was brighter and larger. Elements
of its orbit were computed by SAFFORD, HOLETSCHEK, BIGOURDAN.

MARTIN’S elements of this comet are in close agreement with the
above.

Comet C is FAYE’s short-period comet. It was seen by Mr. Common,
of England, August 2. It was then extremely faint. The periodic time
of this comet is 7.413. It was found by the aid of an ephemeris pre-
viously computed.

Comet D was discovered by Dr. HARTWIG, at Strassburg, September
29, and also independently announced by Prof. HARRINGTON, of Ann
Arbor, September 30. It was a bright comet, just visible to the naked
202 ASTRONOMY.

eye. ‘Prof. WINNECKE finds that this comet may be identical with
the comet of 1382, 1444, and 1569, as well as that of 1506, and he is led
to suggest a period of sixty-two and one-third years as probable.”

The spectrum of this comet was observed by KONKOLY, BACKHOUSE,
and YounG. It gives four bright lines, whose wave-lengths are, re-
spectively, 5,609, 5,492, 5,169, and 4,859 tenth-meters. The spectrum,
though faint, was continuous.

October 7, 11, and 12, the spectrum was examined at Greenwich, and
was found to consist of the three usual cometary bands, the brightest
comparing well with that of alcohol vapor and that of the Bunsen-burner
flame.

Comet E was discovered by LEWIS Swirt, of Warner Observatory,
Rochester, N. Y., October 10. It reached its maximum brightness No-
vember 16; presented an ill-defined disk several minutes in diameter.
The particular feature of interest attending this telescopic comet is that
it is identical with comet III of 1869.

Prof. FRISBY, of the United States Naval Observatory, has also com-
puted the elements of this comet from observations by the Washington
transit circle. The perihelion distance of the comet appears to be a
little greater than that of the earth, and its aphelion is just beyond
Jupiter’s orbit. These planets may greatly disturb its path in the
future. Prof. FRISBY makes its period about five and one-half years.

Comet F was a small bright telescopic object, one minute in diameter,
with a distinct central condensation. It was discovered by Dr. PECHULE
at Copenhagen; elements were computed by Dr. J. HOLETSCHEK.

Prof. YOUNG observed this comet December 18, 19, and 22, and saw
two faint tails. One direct, as usual, away from the Sun, in nearly
the opposite direction, and the other roughly toward the Sun, though
deflected some degrees to the north. The two streamers made an angle
of 150° with each other. ‘ Hach was about thirty minutes long on the
18th, and neither was seen after the 22d.” °

The three periodic comets whose orbits have been the most carefully
examined are ENCKE’S, WINNECKE’S, and FAYr’s. Their least distances
from the Sun are 535, 74%, +62, of the Earth’s distance, respectively.
It is well known that ENCK®’s original researches indicated the exist-
ence of a resisting medium in space which, by opposing the motion of the
comet through it, gradually shortened its period of revolution. All of
ENCKE’S computations were repeated by Dr. VON ASTEN, and his gen-
eral results confirmed. Dr. MOLLER, of Lund, executed a like work for
FAYE’sS comet, and found no such change in its period and the conelu-
sion was that, granting the existence of a resisting medium, it did not
extend so far as one and a half times the earth’s mean distance. Dr.
OPPOLZER has just concluded a similar investigation for WINNECKE’S
comet. He finds that its motion is altered in the same way as that of
ENcK®W’s comet, and the value of the resisting force is found to be almost

the same as that found by ENCKE. Dr. OPPOLZER goes further and
shows that, granting the existence of such a resisting force, its effect
upon the motion of FAYE’s comet would be so small as to be confounded
with uncertainties of the computed perturbations. The question of the
existence of a resisting medium will be definitively settled by computa-
tions now in progress upon the other comets of short period.

THE PLANETS.

Vulean (?).—A new attempt to find an orbit in accordance with the
more or less doubtful observations of dark round spots passing across
the Sun’s disk was published in the A. N. by HERR Vv. OPPOLZER. He
found a system of elements which was in remarkably good accordance
with the eight observations on which the calculations were founded.
WATSON’S observation during the eclipse in 1878 was not among these,
and the resulting orbit made “ Vulcan” at that moment be 7° preceding
the Sun. A nearly central transit ought to have taken place on Mareh
18, 1879, but nothing was seen, though many telescopes were directed
to the Sun that day.

In No. 2253-54 of the A. N. Dr. C. H. F. PETERS has published a
long article entitled ‘“‘ Some critical remarks on so-called intra- Mercurial
Planet Observations.” In the first part of this article the writer con-
siders at length the observations made during the eclipse of July 29,
1878, by WATSON and Swit, of two unknown objects southwest of
the Sun. The fact that the line between the two stars, called a and
b hy Prof. WATSON, is almost parallel and equal in length to the line
between @ and £ Cancri, joined to the small size of the improvised circles
of the instrument, appears to him to prove beyond doubt that the
objects seen were nothing but the stars @ and ¢ Cancri. The constant
error of about 3", which, under this supposition, would affect the R.
A.s of a and b, he explains by the different circumstances under which
the circle markings were made for the stars and for the Sun; in the
former case, in semi-darkness and in a hurry; in the latter case, in full
daylight and with leisure. Possibly, also, the markings were made at
the same side of the wire-pointer, thus creating a parallax of 3° or 34, of
aninch. Mr. Swirr’s observation is treated more summarily by Prof.
PETERS, who thinks the confusion and successive gradations in his
statements must deprive every reader of confidence in them.

To this criticism Prof. WATSON has given an indignant reply in No.
2265 of the same journal. He denies flatly that his wire-pointers were
as easily bent as supposed by Prof. PETERS, and feels confident that
the probable error of 5’, assigned by himself, is rather too large than the
reverse; the 20’ of Prof. PETERS he considers perfectly absurd. There
is only one of Prof. PETERS’S objections which he did not answer; he did
not state whether he saw « and 0 Cancri at the same time or not in this
paper. This seems to be the crucial point of the whole question, and
Prof. WATSON, in his report to the Naval Observatory, has distinctly

stated this. Mr. Swirr has also replied in the A. N. 2277. He had,
immediately after the eclipse, informed the other observers near him
that he had seen two objects with sensible (though, he acknowledged,
spurious) disks about 3° 8S. W. of the Sun, 12’ apart. Later on he
changed this estimate to 7’ or 8/ in a letter to Nature (xviii, p. 539), in
which he made a curious mistake, putting 8/=2™. Prof. PETERS can
hardly be blamed for having felt suspicious at all this confusion, or for
having made little of Mr. SwIFT’s comparison of the distance between
Mizar and Alcor, with the distance between the two unknown objects.

Venus and Mars.—Dr. HARTWIG has published an extremely import-
ant investigation of the diameters of Venus and Mars from heliometer
measures by himself. He has also thoroughly discussed previous ob-
servations, and the following instructive table gives the main results:

The negative sign of the constant error for all double image observa-
tions is very remarkable, and it appears that telescopes of all apertures
make the diameter as measured in daylight too small, while there does
not seem to be any law depending on the aperture.

The adopted value is a mean of the Oxford, Leiden, and Strassburg
values, 17/’.552, which is 0.60 and 0.65 greater than the results of ob-
servations of Venus in transit, by AUWERS and TENNANT, in 1874. The
obscured hemisphere of Venus was repeatedly seen during the obser-
vations.

The diameter of Mars is deduced (for distance 1) to be polar diameter
= 9.349 + 0.010 from the mean of ARAGO’S, BESSEL’S, KAISER’S,
MaArn’s, and HARTWIG@’s observations.

The Strassburg observations alone gave polar diameter = 9/.311;
equatorial diameter = 9.519.

Many good drawings of Mars were made in 1877, among which those
of Mr. GREEN, at Madeira, of Mr. DREYER, and of M. NIESTEN, at
Brussels, deserve especial notice. Mr. GREEN and Mr. BURTON have
also observed Mars in 1879.

Neither Mr. GREEN nor any one else in 1877 succeeded in seeing the
remarkable long and narrow canals depicted in SCHIAPARELLI’s * Osser-
vazioni astronomiche e fisiche sull’asse di rotatione e sulla topografia
del pianeta Marte,” Roma, 1878, 4to;* but M. TerBy has pointed out that
drawings made by Prof. HOLDEN, at Washington, in 1875, contain these
canals, and that thus their subsequent discovery by M. SCHIAPARELLI

- in 1877 is fully verified. This paper, published towards the end of

1878, contains first a new determination of the direction of the axis of
rotation, the measures being made by placing the micrometer wire tan-
gent to the middle of the snow spot. The results were, for September
27-0.

The second chapter contains the determination of the areographic
position of sixty-two principal points on the surface. From this an
exact map on Mercator’s projection has been constructed, but as only
two colors are used, blue and white, to represent dark and bright, and
no shading at all is given, it is rather difficult to compare this map with
others. The innumerable “canals,” which in all directions cross the
map, increase this difficulty. Four representations of the disk in ortho-
graphic projection (Table V), founded on all the drawings made at
Milan, are very much more adapted to be compared with other maps.

One of the most important publications of the year is the eleventh
volume (Part I) of the “Annals of the Observatory of Harvard Col-
lege,” containing Professor PICKERING’S Photometric Observations
made with the 15-inch refractor. The author first made experiments

with a Zollner’s photometer and other instruments in which the star is

compared with an artificial light, but on account of the want of simi-
larity between the real and the artificial star, and the difficulty of ap-
plying a correction for changes in opacity of the air, which only affect
the real star, the use of a lamp was abandoned, and all comparisons
were made with some bright star in the vicinity of the object observed.
All variations in the condition of the air were thus eliminated, both ob-
jects being equally affected by it. To insure a comparison free from

personal equation or variations due to the observer, it is very desirable
that the objects shall resemble each other as much as possible. This
result is secured by bringing the images to be compared close together,
so that they are both viewed with the same aperture and magnifying
power, and the light of both is equally distorted by passing through the
same lenses and prisms. A detailed description is given of the many
photometers employed.*

These photometers could only be used for comparing objects very
near together, such as double stars or satellites. For somewhat greater
intervals two achromatic prisms of small angle were placed in front of
a telescope, covering the central part of the object-glass. Two images
of any object would thus be formed, separated by an interval depend-
ent on the angle of the prisms, and on their relative positions.

All the photometers described are open to the objection that the loss
of light is very great, from 60 to 80 per cent. This was especially felt
during the observations of the satellites of Mars, and Jed to the inven-
tion of another class of photometers. The image of some bright star,
assumed as standard, passes outside the telescope, and is reflected into
the field, after having been reduced by some known amount, until it
equals the faint object to be measured.

The instruments having been described at length in Chapter I, the
second chapter contains the journal of the observations, while the dis-
cussions are given in Chapters II] and IV. Conjunctions of planets,
already alluded to above, afforded a good opportunity for comparing
their relative brightness. The results are:

Albedo of Saturn Albedo of Jupiter

ai Soteeinntes ste ee 9) =
Albedo of Mars ~~ 4.620.07 Albedo of Venus

A series of photometric measures of all the more conspicuous double
stars is discussed in Chapter IV.

Part Il of vol. XI of the Annals of Harvard College Observatory con-
tains the determinations of the brightness of various satellites. In these
researches Prof. PICKERING had great difficulties to overcome on account
of the extreme faintness of some of the objects whose light was to be
measured; the results, however, are.of special interest, as affording
some idea of the real size of these minute members of the solar system.
Prof. PICKERING’S attention was first directed to the newly discovered
satellites of Mars, and he devised various new forms of photometer for
the examination of these faint objects. These photometers are all de-
scribed in Part I, and the first two chapters of Part If (Chaps. V and
VI) are devoted to determinations of their constants, by various meth-
ods. The problem was one of great difficulty, involving the measure-
ment of a photometric interval as great as that between the Sun and
the Moon, the planet Mars being several hundred thousand times as
bright as his satellites. As a direct comparison was impossible, the
light of the satellite was compared with that received from a small por-

tion of Mars through a small hole 1-100th of a millimeter in diameter,
a. €., 1-100th of the diameter of Mars, or about 40 miles, the diameter of
Mars in the telescope being one millimeter. Much difficulty was expe-
rienced in making such a hole, and it was only after various attempts
that Prof. PICKERING succeeded in boring suitable hotes in a piece of
platinum foil gummed on a glass plate.

The light of Mars seen through the smallest hole that could be made
was, after all, much greater than that of the satellite, which must there-
fore, if its albedo or reflecting power is about the same as that of Mars,
have a diameter much less than 40 miles.

The following are the results of comparison with Mars, as well as with
Saturn and certain faint stars near which the satellites passed :

Mars=667,000 x Phobos in 1877; equiv. diam.=5.97 miles.
Mars=879,000 x Deimos in 1877; equiv. diam.=4.9+0.1 miles.
Mars=550,000 x Deimos in 1879 ; equiv. diam.=6.1-+ 0.1 miles.
Mars=461,000 x Deimos foll. Mars; equiv. diam.=6.7 miles.
Mars=673,000 x Deimos prec. Mars ; equiv. diam.=5.5 miles.

The equivalent diameter of the satellite is calculated on the assump-
tion that its albedo is the same as that of Mars.

It appears, then, from Prof. PICKERING’S results that Deimos was ap-
- parently much brighter in 1879 than in 1877, and that it was brighter by
nearly half a magnitude on the following side than on the preceding
side of its orbit. In support of this Prof. PICKERING points out that
there is a large preponderance of micrometer observations of Deimos on
the following side, showing that the satellite was more easily seen in
that part of its orbit. The micrometer measures of Phobos were nearly
equally distributed. No photometric measures were made of this satel-
lite in 1879. The general result of all the observations is that Deimos
is about 14.5 magnitudes (on the photometric scale) fainter than Mars,
and about 0.3 magnitude fainter than Phobos, the equivalent diameters
of the two satellites being about 7 and 6 miles respectively, correspond-
ing to 0.010 and 0.009 at mean distance. That is, the satellites are
fainter than an area of the surface of Mars having a diameter of 0/.01
at distance unity, or 1-1000th part of the diameter of Mars. Notwith-
standing the minuteness of the points of light compared, a difference
in color was detected between the outer satellite and Mars, Deimos ap-
pearing to be blue, whilst the artificial star formed by Mars was noted
as red.

The observations of the satellites of Jupiter in Chapter VIII are of
Special interest, from the comparison of equivalent diameters (photo-
metrically inferred) and the diameters as actually measured. The fol-
lowing are the results:

208 ASTRONOMY. q

The first line gives the ratio of the light of Jupiter to that of each of
the satellites, the last the albedo relative to Jupiter. To obtain the ab-
solute albedo for each satellite, the relative albedo must be multiplied
by the albedo of Jupiter (0.610). The view that the light of the satel-
lites is variable is not confirmed by Prof. PICKERING’S observations.

A large number of photometric measures of the eight satellites of
Saturn were made in 1877-8, special attention being devoted to the
variations of light of Iapetus, which were found to extend from 40 to
140 (taking the mean brightness as 100). The following formula was
found to represent the variations of light:

L = 100 — 50 sin v + 10 cos 22,
where L is the light of the satellite at any longitude v.

On this formula Prof. PICKERING remarks, ‘The absence of the term
ec cos v shows that if the variation in light is due to unequal brightness of
the two hemispheres of Japetus, one-half of each will always be turned
towards Saturn. In other words, it would present to an observer at the
north pole of Saturn the appearance of a half moon, the semicircle to
the right being about four times as bright as that to the left.

‘¢Some doubt is thrown on the term e cos 2v, since the comparisons
with Saturn do not confirm its presence. Since the value of ¢ is positive,
it cannot be supposed to indicate that Iapetus is elongated in the direc-
tion of Satrrn, although a slight elongation of this kind is probably im-
plied in the assumption that the satellite turns once on its axis during
‘each of its revolutions. An elongation sufficient to produce this effect
might be caused by the attraction of Saturn, but it would be far too
small to be perceptible photometrically. To make e = + 1, the equato-
rial diameter of the satellite turned towards Saturn should be exceeded
‘ by that at right angles to it in the ratio of 9 to 11; so great a differ-
ence does not seem probable. The term ecos 2v could also be accounted
for by two bright or dark spots on the satellite. A dark spot on one
side covering less than a hemisphere would also give a variation in light
closely resembling that given by that in the formula. The most natural
explanation, however, is that the dark and light portions are irregularly
distributed on Iapetus, like the land and water on our Earth, and that
one hemisphere is, on the whole, much darker than the other. The
smaller variations may be assumed to be such that the formula given
above represents them closely.”

The following are the equivalent diameters of the satellites in miles
found by Prof. PICKERING: Mimas 292+9; Encleadus 370+10; Tethys
570418; Dione 542417; Rhea 745427; Titan 1406152; Hyperion
19345; Iapetus, mean 48614, max. 574, min. 307.

The satellites of Uranus and Neptune have the following equivalent
diameters (in miles): Titania 586416; Oberon 544+15; satellite of
Neptune 2260460. The large equivalent diameter of the satellite of
Neptune is noteworthy.

Determinations are also given of the equivalent diameters of some
ASTRONOMY. 209

of the minor planets, as follows: Pallas 167 miles; Juno 94-4; Vesta
319+10; Antiope 5143; Brunhild 20+3; Eva 1441; Menippe 12+1.

Though these equivalent diameters must not be accepted as actual
diameters, they doubtless give a pretty close approximation to the size
of the smaller members of the solar system, even allowing for a large
uncertainty in the albedo. It would seem from the Harvard College
determinations that some of the smaller asteroids are at any rate com-
parable in size with the satellites of Mars, and the step from these to the
larger meteorites is not a very largeone. The volume also contains pho-
tometric measures of 103 unequal double stars and some miscellaneous re-
sults. Great care has been taken throughout to avoid systematic errors
by varying the methods of observation, but it is certain that some of the
measures of the light of faint companions to bright stars are in error, as
shown by comparison of pairs of the same assigned brightness.

A work of some magnitude has been undertaken by Prof. PICKERING
during the past year in the determination of the light of all the stars
visible to the naked eye at Cambridge (Mass.) As most of these stars
would be very troublesome to identify in the field of a photometer
mounted on an ordinary stand, they are observed in the meridian. The
photometer consists of a horizontal telescope pointing to the west, and
having two objectives. By means of two prisms mounted in front of the
telescope the pole star is reflected into one object-glass, and the star to
be measured into the other. The cones of light are made to coincide by
a double-image prism. the extra images being cut off by an eye-stop.
The star to be measured is thus seen in the same field with the pole star,
under exactly the same conditions. To determine the relative transpar.
ency of the air at different altitudes, a list of a hundred cireumpolar
stars has been prepared, to be observed at both upper and lower culmi-
nations. Progressive changes in the light of the pole star may thus also
be detected and eliminated.

A Persian MS. of ULuau Broa’s catalogue of stars recently presented
to the Royal Astronomical Society has been examined by Mr. KNOBEL
(M. N. xxx, 337), and compared with Hypr’s translation. A great many
discrepancies have (as was also the case with SOFI) been found to arise
from certain characters being mistaken for others by the transcriber,
and Mr. KNOBEL was hereby led to examine those of Ibn JUNIS’s lunar
eclipses, which Prof. NEwcoms had found to be irreconcilable with the
computations, and he suggests explanations, founded on the assumption
of similar errors having been made in copying a MS. The magnitudes
of ULuGH BEG never having been properly translated, Mr. KNOBEL
gives a complete translation of the magnitudes as found in the MS.
under examination.

Jupiter.—Dr. ScumipT has made a new determination of the time of
rotation of Jupiter upon its axis, from observations in 1879 and 1880, of
the red spot upon its disk. His preliminary discussion gives for the
time of rotation 9h. 55m. 34.42s,

210 ASTRONOMY.

On the evening of February 2, Jupiter was passing near the star B. A,
©. 303 (73 Piscium), and the opportunity was taken at the observatory
of Harvard College to compare photometrically the third satellite of the
planet, with the star. Three observers took part in the work, and four
sets of measurements, each consisting of eight single comparisons, were
made. The result obtained was that the star was fainter than the sat-
ellite by 0.38 magnitudes of PoGson’s logarithmic scale. For the mag-
nitude of the star we have 6.16 by the mean of the available estimates
on record, and 6.17 by the observations made at this observatory with
the meridian photometer. The resulting magnitude of the satellite is
5.28 or 5.29, in close agreement with the value, 5.24, found by a very
different method, in the Annals of the Observatory, Vol. XI, p. 276.

Saturn.—A letter from Prof. HAstines, of the Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, puts an important point in regard to the nature of Saturn’s rings
(C, the dusky ring, B, the inner bright ring, A, the outer ring) so briefly
that it may be quoted. “The ring C projected on Saturn is dark; if
the ring were composed of particles having the same albedo as the planet
it would appear neither bright nor dark, as it would return to us by re-
flection the exact equivalent of what it intercepts. But the albedo of B
is greater than that of the planet since it is the brightest part of the
system. Hence either the material of C is different from that of B, or
the planet is self-luminous.”

Possible planets beyond Neptune.—Prof. FORBES, of Edinburg, and Mr.
D. P. Topp, of Washington, have, during the year, published accounts
of their theoretical proofs of the existence of a planet or planets beyond
Neptune. Prof. FoRBEs founds his conclusions upon the statistical dis-
tribution of the aphelia of comets. These have long been known to be
grouped at certain distances from the sun, with empty spaces so, far as
known between groups. There is a group of eleven comets whose aphe-
lia are at Jupiter’s mean distance, 5, and another group of six comets
about Neptune’s distance, 30.

Another well marked group of seven comets have aphelion distances
of about 100.

The theory of the introdution of comets into the solar system, proposed
a few years since by Prof. Newton, of Yale College, is made the basis of
the investigation, and according to this, any comet which is drawn into
our system from outside and its elements so changed as to make it a
permanent member of the system must have been so influenced by a
planet which was somewhere near the aphelion point of this comet’s
orbit at the time of its introdution.

If the aphelion points of the seven comets of the last group described
be marked on a globe, it is found that they lie on or near a great circle.
Prof. FORBES further finds that a planet revolving at a distance 100 in a
periodic time of 1,000 years might have been at the points so marked
during the period cf two revolutions of the comets of this group, and from
—

this and other reasons it is concluded that there is such a planet revolv-
ing at the distance of about 100, which is at present in R. A. 112 40™ N,
ED.879.

Similar considerations are applied to the next group of comets of
aphelion distances about 300, and evidence of a disturbing planet at this
distance also is adduced. Prof. FORBES has applied the method he has
used to the case of the comets which we know to revolve near Neptune,
and, without any knowledge of Neptune’s real position, he found that
the aphelion positions of these comets indicated the existence of a planet
in longitnde 45°. In fact, Neptune is now in longitude 48°. From all
of which Prof. FORBES concludes the existence of at least one ultra-Nep-
tunian planet in the position indicated, ¢. e., for 1880, R. A. 112 40™ N.
Pe). 87°.

The publication of Prof. FORBES’s results has caused Mr. Topp, of
Washington, to print the results of some investigations he has made in
the motions of Uranus and Neptune as compared with Newcomb’s tables
of these planets. Proceeding by a graphical method he was led to the
conclusion that there must be a planet exterior to Neptune revolving in
an orbit inclined about 14°, whose ascending node is at longitude 1039,
and whose longitude is about 175°, or, for 1881, March, its position is
era le STN. Ps Di Sio:

In other words, Prof. FORBES and Mr. TopD, proceeding on utterly
different data, have arrived at identically the same result. In each case
the data are insufficient and the exact agreement is accidental. Still
it is noteworthy.

It is extremely doubtful if such a planet would be recognizable by
its disk at this distance from the sun. Still, Mr. Topp made a search for
it with the 26-inch telescope at Washington, without success however.
The true method of research would be the accurate mapping of this
portion of the sky—a work of several years.

The Jahrbuch for 1882 gives some details regarding the first 173 as-
teroids, which we condense as follows: Out of these 173, there are 120
which have been satisfactorily observed at 5 (or more) oppositions, 11
which have been observed at 4 oppositions, 10 at 3, 14 at 2, and 18 at 1
only. Of theselast18, some are new discoveries and only Dike (BORELLY),
and Scylla (PALISA) are yet to be rediscovered. Juewa (WATSON) has
been lately found, after having been lost six years.

The Moon.—The lunar photographs taken with the 13-inch reflector at
the University Observatory, Oxford, have been utilized for finding a
new value for the semi-diameter of the Moon. The process adopted was
very nearly the same as that employed by WIcHMAN, and the resulting
mean semi-diameter is 15/ 34” .175 + 0.069. Mr. NErson has, from a
careful discussion of nearly 1,100 observations, made at Greenwich, Ox-
ford (RADCLIFFE), and Washington, deduced the value—

15! 33.374 4/.10—(1 + 0.70 x aperture in inches).

This empirical formula, he adds, agrees closely with the theoretical
formula, founded on the assumpution that the differences between the
semi-diameters obtained with instruments of different aperture vary as
the diffraction dises and the amount of light. Applying the formula to
a 13-inch reflector, and adding the photographic irradiation, which Mr.
NIESON states his experiments indicate to be about + 0.3, the photo-
graphic semi-diameter should be 15! 34/’.08.

No papers on the Moon published during the past year exceed in im-
portance those by Mr. G. H. DARWIN on the secular effects of tidal fric-
tion on the configuration of a planet and its satellite. In the first paper
the theory of the deformation of a viscous or imperfectly elastic spheroid
under the attraction of satellitesis investigated. Numerical calculations
show that bodily tides in the Earth are at present very small. From this
point Mr. DARWIN was led to consider the perturbed rotation of such
a spheroid, and the reaction on the perturbing bodies. He has in
the A. N. 2294 given the following summary of the results arrived at

through these investigations, which, no doubt, mark the beginning of
a new era in our knowledge of the past history of the solar system:

1. The lunar period must have been shorter in the past, and may be
traced back from the present 27.3 days, until initially the Moon revolved
round the Earth in from two to four hours.

2. The inclination of the orbit to the “proper plane” must have
been larger in the past, and may be traced back from the present 5° 9’
until it was 6° or 7°. This was a maximum inclination, and in the
more remote past the inclination was less and initially was very small
or zero.

3. The inclination of the proper plane to the ecliptic must have been
greater in the past, and may be traced back from its present 8” until it
was in very early times about 11° 45’. It is possible that initially this
inclination was less, and that the 11° 45’ was a maximum value.

4. The eccentricity of the orbit must have been smaller in the past.
Either at one time it had a minimum value, before which it had a
maximum value, and, again, earlier it was very small or zero, or else
the maximum value never occurred, and the eccentricity has always
been increasing. The history of the eccentricity depends on the nature
of the tides in the Earth, but the former of these alternatives seems
the more probable.

At the present time the Earth rotates in twenty-four hours, its equa-
tor is inclined at an angle of 9” to a plane which Mr. DARWIN ealls
“the proper plane of the Earth” (the mean equator). This proper
plane is inclined at an angle of 23° 28’ to the ecliptic, and its intersec-
tion with the ecliptic is the equinoctial line. He finds that the fric-
tional tides in the Earth have caused changes which may be summa-
rized as follows:

5. The day must have been shorter in the past, and it may be traced
back from its present value of twenty-four hours until initially it was
from two to four hours in length. It was then identical with the Moon’s
period of revolution as described in (1).

6. The inclination of the equator to the Earth’s proper plane must
have been larger in the past, and may be traced back from the present
value of 9” untilit was about 2° 45’. This was a maximum inclination,
and in the more remote past the inclination was less, and initially it
was very Small or zero.

7. The inclination of the Earth’s proper plane to the ecliptic must
have been smaller in the past, and may be traced back from its present
value of 23° 28/ until initially it was 11° 45’, or, perhaps, somewhat less.
It was then identical with the proper plane of the lunar orbit, and this
is true whether or not 11° 45’ was a maximum inclination of the lunar
proper plane to the ecliptic as described in (1).

The preceding statements may be subject to varieties of detail, ac-
cording to the nature of the tides raised in the Earth, but the above is
a summary of what appears to be the most probable course of evolution.
214 ASTRONOMY.

The hypothesis which is suggested as most probable is, that the more
recent changes in the system have been principally due to oceanic tidal
friction, and that the more ancient changes were produced by bodily
tidal friction. The initial state of the Moon, nearly in contact with the
Earth, and always opposite the same face of it, suggests that the Moon
was produced by the rupture in consequence of rapid rotation or other
causes of a primeval planet, Whose mass was made up of the present
Moon and Earth. It is a remarkable coincidence, that the shortest pe-
riod of revolution of a fluid mass of the same mean destiny as the Earth,
which is consistent with an ellipsoidal form of equilibrium, is two hours
and twenty-four minutes; and that if the Moon were to revolve about
the Earth with this periodic time, the surfaces of the two bodies would
be almost in contact with one another. The theory gives an interesting
explanation of the rapid movement of the inner satellite of Mars.

OBSERVATORIES.

The buildings of the new observatory of the University of Strasburg
have been completed, and a description and plates of them made by the
director, Dr. WINNECKE. The principal instruments are:

1. A meridian circle by REPSOLD; aperture 162 millimeters (6.4 inches).

2. An altazimuth by REPSOLD; aperture 136 millimeters (5.4 inches).

3. A refractor by MERZ; aperture 487 millimeters (20.2 inches).

4, An orbit-sweeper by REPSOLD; aperture 163 millimeters (6.4 in-
ches).

There are three buildings—one large one containing the residences of
the astronomers, and two smaller.

On the main building is the large iron dome, some 39 feet in diameter.
There are two novelties in its construction: First, the shutters to the
dome are made in two parts, and extend from horizon to horizon. They
are opened symmetrically by screws, and leave the whole 180° open at
once. Secondly, the dome, which weighs about 95,000 pounds, is turned
by means of heavy weights, which are wound up from time to time as
required. A touch from the observer will release these, and their fall
will turn the dome right or left as required. The working of this dome
will be attentively regarded, as most of the difficulties of such structures
appear to have been successfully avoided. In windy situations the
whole slit must not be opened at the same time, but the principle of
these shutters properly modified will serve even in this case. The dome
of the new Naval Observatory at Washington is to be of the turret con-
struction, by which form the difficulties of shutters can be evaded.

The 27-inch refractor for the Vienna observatory has been finished
by Mr. GRuBB, and is now mounted, and is said to be satisfactory. An
elaborate description of it is published by Mr. GRUBB as a reprint from
Engineering.

Mr. A. A. ComMMON has mounted his new 36-inch silver-on-glass equa-
torial at Haling, near London. It is described in “The Observatory,”

III, p. 167, and Mr. CALVER has given a very full account of the pro-
cess of figuring and silvesing the mirror in the M. N. for November.

A new observatory has been founded at Kalocza in Hungary, by Car-
dinal Archbishop HAYNALD. Dr. CHARLES BRAUN is the director, and
the chief instrument is a 7-inch refractor by MERZ.

Another private observatory has been constructed at Plonsk, about
37 miles from Warsaw, by Dr. JEDRZEJEVICZ. The principal instru-
ment is 6.4 inch refractor by STEINHEIL, to be used for observations of
double stars.

The new observatory of Queen’s College, Cork, though furnished only
with small instruments, promises to become one of the most remarkable
astronomical institutes existing, on account of the unique character
and refined construction of its instruments. These have been de-
scribed at some length in the Scientific Proceedings, Royal Dublin
Society, by their constructor, Mr. HowArD Grubb. The principal
instruments are an 8-inch equatorial, a 5-inch transit circle with 20-inch
circles of glass, and a 4-inch siderostat of novel construction. The tel-
escope of this instrument points towards the south pole, and carries
outside the object-glass a plane silvered mirror, which, by the rotation
of the tube round its optical axis (either by hand or clockwork), will
keep the object under examination in the center of the field.

An observatory is being built on the site of the ‘“‘Casa deg! Inglesi,”
on Mount Etna, 9,650 feet above the sea. It is only to be inhabited
during the months of June, July, August, and September; and the 12-
inch lens, by MERZ, is then to be brought to Catania, where there is to
be a duplicate mounting for it. The observatory is to be devoted to
solar work, for which its high elevation, according to the experience of
Prof. TACCHINI, as also of Prof. LANGLEY, makes it especially suited.*

M. BIsSCcHOFFSHEIMis building anew observatory at Mont des Mignons,
Nice, of which M. PERROTIN, of the Paris Observatory, has been ap-
pointed the director. A sum of 900,000 francs is to be spent on it.

It is now more than five years since JAMES Lick, of San Francisco,
placed in the hands of trustees the sum of $700,000 for the purpose
of erecting and equipping an observatory near the Pacific coast, which
was to constitute the Lick Astronomical Department of the University
of California.t The site originally chosen was at Lake Tahoe; but
afterwards a series of experimental surveys was made, with a view
of obtaining the best location in an easily accessible place. Finally,
Mount Hamilton, in Santa Clara County, about 50 miles southeast of
San Francisco, was chosen, and negotiations were opened with the
county authorities for the building of a road to the summit. More than
1,500 acres of land were secured for the observatory, only a small por-
tion of which is essential to the immediate needs of the buildings, but

*A plan of the observatory is given in Nature, xix, p. 558.

dustry, Vol. III., p. 482. (December, 1879.)

the residue will be utilized for pasture, and for fuel and water-supply.
The steep and broken character of the ground renders a large surface of
land necessary for the adequate protection of the observatory from fire
and intrusion.

In order to observe the transit of Venus in 1882, the Lick trustees
have secured a 12-inch refractor, made by ALVAN CLARK & Sons, who
are to make a 36-inch refractor later. A 4-inch transit instrument has
been ordered from FAuTH & Co., Washington, to be mounted in 1881.
A plan for the buildings has been made by Professors NEwcoms and
HOLDEN, in which the library, study, computing and sleeping rooms
are to be attached to the main building, and the dwelling-houses, ete.,
will be close by, on a shelf of the hill lower down.

The second volume of OPPOLZER’S “ Lehrbuch zur Bahnbestimmung
der Kometen und Planeten” has appeared in October last, nearly ten
years after the first volume. Such a work was indeed a desideratum.
The book enters into the most minute details, and gives examples fully
worked out to an extent which neither WATSON’S excellent “Theoretical
Astronomy,” nor the shorter, though in some parts more comprehensive,
“Theoretische Astronomie” by KLINKERFUES, have attained.

Mr. STONE having been appointed to the Radcliffe Observatory, Ox-
ford, Mr. GILL succeeded him as Her Majesty’s Astronomer at the Cape.
Mr. GILL purchased Lord LINDSAY’S heliometer, with which he had al-
ready done such excellent work himself, and had it mounted on a new
stand by Mr. Gruss. He intends to apply this instrument to investi-
gations on the parallax of some stars having large proper motions, and
to researches on southern star-clusters. Dr. ELKIN, of New Orleans,
goes to the Cape as assistant to Mr. GIL.

Prof. HOLDEN has been appointed director of the Washburn Obser-
vatory at Madison, Wis., in the place of the late Prof. JAMES C. WAT-
SON.

INSTRUMENTS.

ALVAN CLARK & Sons, of Cambridgeport, have now on hand, in all
the various stages of completion, a most interesting collection of large
refractors, to say nothing of a number of glasses of 8 inches or less di-
ameter.

The lenses of the 23-inch equatorial for Prof. YOUNG, at Princeton,
are receiving the finishing touches, and have already shown a remark-
able degree of perfection. The glass was cast by FEm. The mounting
for this instrument is well advanced.

A 16-inch objective for Prof. Swirt, of the Warner Observatory, is
finished, and the mounting nearly so. This glass is of English manu-
facture.

The McCormick glass of 26 inches aperture, made at the same time
as the Washington refractor, and intended for the University of Virginia,
is still in the shop and has been completed for several years, while the
mounting requires but comparatively little additional work.
ASTRONOMY. 217

Two 8-inch refractors have been ordered and are partially finished—
one ordered by Prof. YOUNG for the seminary at South Hadley, and the
other by Dr. ENGELMANN, of Leipsie.

The flint glass disk for the 50-inch telescope, ordered by STRUVE for
the Russian Government, has been received from FEIL, and the crown
glass is expected shortly. The mounting for this will probably be made
abroad.

For the Lick trustees a 36-inch refractor is ordered, but it will not be
completed for several years. A 12-inch equatorial for observing the
transit of Venus is nearly finished, and orders have been received for a
5-inch photoheliograph and a smaller comet-seeker.

In all or nearly all of these instruments the cell of the object-glass is
arranged so as to separate the lenses by several inches and allow a free
circulation of air between them, as well as to afford an opportunity of
readily reaching the inner surfaces of the glass. This device is adopted
in the hope of bringing the temperature of the glass as nearly as pos-
sible equal to that of the external air, but it remains to be seen if it is
really advantageous.

A new 10-inch equatorial, with an object-glass by MERZ, has been
presented to the Geneva-Observatory by its director, Prof. Emu PLAN-
TAMOUR. It is to be devoted to observations of the major planets and
their satellites, of parallax of stars, and of double stars, with occasional
observations of minor planets.

ASTRONOMICAL BIOGRAPHY, BIBLIOGRAPHY, ETC.

The first number of the new International Journal of Astronomy—
Urania, edited by Drs. COPELAND and DREYER, contains in avery con-
venient form of 24 demy 4to pages, a number of interesting articles.
Among others, are the following papers: “ Observations of the Spee-
trum of Comet 1880 d. (Harrwic) at Dun Echt,” by COPELAND and
Louse. “A New Planetary Nebula,” by Dr. COPELAND.* ‘Observa-
tions of Comets 1880 b, c, and d, at Dun Echt. “ Uber die Auflosung
der Lambert’schen Gleichung fiir Parabolische Bahnen,” by Professor
KLINKERFUES.

A special reference should be made to the new arrangement given to
the tables of the American Ephemeris for 1882 by the superintendent,
Prof. NEwcoms, by which it has become the most convenient of astro-
nomical almanacs. It should have a short Index added to it.

“Obituary Notices of Astronomers” is the title of a littie book by
Mr. DUNKI, in which are collected some obituary notices of Fellows
and Associates of the R. A. S., mostly written for the annual report in
the Monthly Notices, but revised, and some of them partly rewritten.

occupies 271 pages in 4to of the Annales de VObservatoire Royal de

lication, and it is hard to understand how astronomers hitherto have
managed to get on without such a handbook; it is only a great pity
that it has not been published in the shape of a handbook, but in a
place where it will not be easily accessible to many people. It gives
in twenty chapters, chronologically arranged, lists of all the different
values of astronomical constants, which have been published from the
earliest times and down to 1877, in all cases describing the way of find-
ing the particular value and adding exact references, by means of which
any one can find out for himself all about any value. And more than
that, the titles of the principal books and memoirs relating to any sub-
ject within the range of the repertory are also given, but completeness
is not aimed at in this respect. The lists of constants are very com-
plete and nearly always correct, and critics of M. HouzEAU’s work must
first show that they could do better that which is extremely well done.

M. HouzeEAu, who by this excellent piece of work has shown himself
eminently familiar with astronomical literature, ancient and modern,
and who already in his “Catalogue des Ouvrages d’Astronomie et de
Meteorologie qui se trouvent dans les principales Bibliothéques de la
Belgique” (1878), has given a very convenient bibliography, is publish-
ing a “Bibliographie générale de ’ Astronomie” in conjunction with M.
A. LANCASTER, of the Brussels Observatory. This work is to be divided
into three parts, Books, Memoirs, and Observations, and will be a most
useful guide in the literature of Astronomy.

An index to the records of observations, ete., outside the ordinary
routine work at Greenwich, was printed in the Monthly Notices (xxxix,
p. 905).

A complete “ Subject-Index to the Publications of the U. S. Naval
Observatory from 1845 to 1875,” 74 pages 4to, by Prof. E. S. HOLDEN,
is published in the Washington Observations for 1876.

A list of books and memoirs on celestial spectrum analysis, by M.
FILVEZ, appears in the “Annuaire de ’Observatoire de Bruxelles” for
1879, pp. 255-338.

To commemorate the centennial of the discovery of Uranus, we have
“Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL, his Life and Worss,” by Prof. HOLDEN, of
the United States Naval Observatory, Washington.

In 1847 DE MorcGan wrote: “The clear and powerful results of
WILLIAM HERSCHEL’S mind lie buried in the Philosophical Transactions,
inaccessible to the larger portion of those who might learn from them
to form a true taste in speculative astronomy, and a true notion of the
state of our knowledge of the fabric of the universe.”

Thirty years after this was written, and two generations after
HERSCHEL’S death, there is still no readier means of studying his
works than the original volumes of the Transactions, now become rare
and costly. And what is perhaps more widely noticeable outside the
circle of special students, there is still no biography of the greatest of
practical astronomers and one of the most profound philosophers in
ASTRONOMY. 219

modern times. The discoveries recited in HERSCHEL’S wonderful series
of memoirs have now become part of the common stock of knowledge ;

even the most casual reader will care to know how they came about.

In seeking to supply for special students the first of these great
wants, by A SYNOPSIS OF THE SCIENTIFIC WRITINGS OF HERSCHEL,
now publishing by the Smithsonian Institution at Washington, which he
has written in connection with Dr. HAsTines, Prof. HOLDEN has been
led to supply the second also, for the more general reader, in the biog-
raphy above named.

An account of Part II of the Catalogus Librorum of the Pulkova ob-
servatory must be deferred until the next year, this important work
having but just reached this country.

GEOLOGY.

Curator in the National Museum.

SURVEYS.

Our National and State governments have never failed to appreciate
that the questions to be answered by geological investigation are so
numerous, and of importance in so many directions, that public aid
should be given such studies in order to render them systematic and
more nearly complete. That we remain most ignorant of the structure
and geological resources of some of the oldest and ablest States is, how-
ever, a fact which will attract attention. The investigations that have
been made during the past two years have aided much in developing a
knowledge of the natural history and resources.of wide areas. The State
of Pennsylvania, for example, has, through its geologist, Professor Les-
ley, published now in all, since 1875, forty-two volumes, seventeen of
which appeared during the last year. This may serve as an example of
the zeal with which investigation in this department of science has been
prosecuted. As the amount of work produced is dependent upon the
working force, a statement of some of the more important events that
have influenced the public surveys will be given.

Before the past year the surveys patronized by the national gov-
ernment had been prosecuted by parties working independently under
the supervision of different executive departments. Although much
of the work produced by these various surveys was acknowledged
valuable, it was thought by many that if they were consolidated and
placed under one head, this would be of weighty importance in ecaus-
ing the work to be more systematically done, and would also prove
an economical measure. A committee of the National Academy of
Science, to which this matter was referred, reported to Congress that
they advised all government surveys to be consolidated under two
heads: Ist. A survey of mensuration, by which the work previously
done by the coast, and geodetic, and land surveys should in the future
be done; and 2d. A survey to which should be referred all questions
relating to the geological structure and natural resources of the publie
domain. This resulted in the organization of the present United States

221
222 GEOLOGY.

Geological Survey, and the withdrawal of appropriations from all pre-
viously existing surveys. There was much discussion and some feeling
excited in the selection of a suitable director for this survey, though the
appointment of Clarence King, who is so well and favorably known for
his excellent geological work upon the fortieth parallel, produced gen-
eral satisfaction. He immediately organized a working force for geo-
logical investigation in the public domain, and although the new survey
has as yet made no reports, the well-known ability of the gentlemen who
are at work in this field is an assurance of many and valuable contribu-
tions to science. In the mean time the old surveys have been permitted
to finish their work, and the result is the addition of several volumes to
the geological literature treating of the Western Territories.

Several of the State surveys have issued volumes. The work of the
large and active corps engaged upon the Pennsylvania survey has
been already noticed. If in speaking of this and other work by surveys
I am unable to give any details of their interesting discoveries on ac-
count of their number, it is none the less important to draw attention
to the volumes from which information can be obtained upon the struct-
ure and resources of some of our most important territory from an
economic standpoint.

The Wisconsin survey has published a large and valuable volume,
which contains work by Irving, Pumpelly, Brooks, Wright, and others,
and which gives much information concerning Lake Superior formations
and their constituent rocks. The nature and origin of the Lake Supe-
rior iron ores and copper ores have always been subjects of much inter-
est. Foster and Whitney early examined and reported upon these de-
posits, but for many years the testimony of students has been such as
to convince that, in opposition to the views of Foster and Whitney, the
iron ores are metamorphic strata, and that the copper was introduced
into the diabases and sandstones by solutions of copper salts and there
reduced to metal and deposited. Mr. M. E. Wadsworth, however, has
reopened the question, by having reached the conviction that the iron

ores are eruptive rocks, as advocated by Foster and Whitney, and that

the copper also was an accompaniment of the eruption of the diabases.
Although few are found at present to agree with Foster and Whitney, it
is thus seen how difficult it is to establish beyond dispute even the sim-
plest questions of geological structure. The volume on Wisconsin
geology treats the iron ores as metamorphic schists, and contains a
great deal of careful lithological and stratigraphical work.

It will be remembered that the geological survey of California, which
was long directed by Prof. J. D. Whitney, has been discontinued.
What the State refused to do has, however, been pushed forward by
the private enterprise and energy of Professor Whitney, aided by Har-
vard College. His volumes upon the auriferous gravels of the Sierra
Nevadas isa very valuable contribution to science, since it treats of the
gravels from a geological standpoint, and also of the modes of working

:
GEOLOGY. 223

them. The author still holds fast to his opinion that the celebrated
Calaveras skull, which was found by him beneath the lavas and gravel
of the Pliocene formation, really was deposited with these gravels, and
is confident that he was not deceived. He is confirmed in his opinion
by the appearance of the skull and the testimony of others who have
examined it. On the other hand Hughes, Dawkins, and others are
convinced that all evidences of man’s existence on the European conti-
nent before the palolithic age are very unsatisfactory, and the age of
the Calaveras skull is a thing which even those who believe in its antiq-
uity will wait to see confirmed.

The Ohio survey has, under the direction of Prof. J. 8. Newberry, pub-
lished a large volume and an atlas; Alabama, New Jersey, Minnesota,
Indiana, Virginia, Kansas, and the Canadian geological surveys under
direction of their respective heads, have issued volumes and reports
which render knowledge concerning the structure and resources of these
areas accessible.

There has been a considerable amount of work done in the mean time
by individuals. It is to be considered as probable that such work will
always take high rank in value, because it is undertaken only on account
of deep personal interest, and is more limited in extent, and therefore
often more thorough. Much of the work referred to beyond is the
result of private enterprise.

STRATIGRAPHY.

The great mass of the communications to geological science from this
country have dealt with stratigraphical geology. The volumes of sur-
veys to which I have referred have been shown to be so numerous that
I can do no more than to simply indicate that there has been great pro-
gress in the development of detailed knowledge of the stratigraphical
arrangement all over the country. I may recall in this connection the
work of Professor Dana, by which the so-called Taconic system of schists
are shown to belong to the Hudson River period. The age of this sys-
tem of rocks, which is of much importance in Green Mountain geology,
has been long a matter of dispute, and has been discussed by very many
able geologists, and this is not the first time that Professor Dana has
expressed his opinion upon this point. His studies have also led him to
think that the limestones of Westchester County and New York Island
and the associated metamorphic rocks are of lower Silurian age, as are
also the limestones and very likely the associated schists of the Green
Mountain region. These conclusions, if they are agreed in, must be of
very great importance, for at the present time it is generally considered
here and abroad that the presumption is in favor of the Archean age
of a thoroughly crystalline schist. Note, for example, the German
nomenclature of the Archean formation. Its lowest member is the
“Urgneiss” formation, and its next member is the “ Krystallinische”
or the “Urschiefer” formation. The recognition of a whole system
224 GEOLOGY.

of Silurian crystalline rocks would certainly produce a radical change
in the existing opinions of many geologists. It is indeed recognized
that fossils have been found among crystalline rocks, but since the
lowest formations are crystalline, and the lowest of all are gneisses,
in the absence of fossils among such rocks they have been called
Archean. This has been much to the convenience of the geologists
and much to the benefit of system. Geologists are slow to change their
convictions, therefore, on this point, because also some crystalline schists
of claimed modern age, as, for example, among the Alps, have been
proved to be not so. The unaided work of Professor Dana must be
considered as an important contribution to the literature of this subject,
as also to New England and New York geology. One can not but be
struck by the fact that while the stratigraphy of the fossiliferous forma-
tions of New York were worked out in such a masterly manner as to
give the nomenclature to American geology, the crystalline formations,
both as regards their lithology and their stratigraphy, were left as a
completely unsolved riddle.

VOLCANIC PHENOMENA.

The violent eruption of Mount Etna has been the most important
volcanic event of the year. This is not because it was so especially
grand or remarkable, but Etna and Vesuvius have been longer and
more critically studied than any volcanoes on the earth; and conse-
quently every minor event connected with these volcanoes, situated so
near centres of scientific learning, is very important, while an eruption
of any voleano in distant lands is less interesting only because less
studied. Whenearly in May, 1879, it was announced that Etna was in
eruption, hours had not elapsed before eminent scientists were en route
from all parts of Europe. The lavas were not cold before they were
analyzed and microscopically examined; and the number of independent
works which have followed one another, treating of the phenomena and
products of this eruption, has been so large as to show the acute
expectation with which the operations of this great volcano are watched.
The material erupted formed very large lava streams, which crystallized
into an augite andesite. Professor von Lasaulx, of Kiel, has recently
edited the extensive work of Sartorius von Waltershausen on Etna,
and has completed it and added numerous observations of his own.

Vesuvius has also had its eruption, and this has strengthened the
opinion of some who think that there is some connection between this
voleano and Etna. Mauna Loa has also had a grand eruption, and the
voleanie glasses of the Hawaiian Islands have been studied by Cohen.
But perhaps the most interesting eruption has occurred near us, and
has been described by Mr. Goodyear and by a commission sent out by
the Government of Guatemala. In December, 1879, an earthquake
octurred at San Salvador which filled the earth with cracks, broke the
telegraph wires, shook down hills, produced great land slides, and opened

a voleanic vent.in the midst of a lake, about which a large island imme-
diately proceeded to build itself. The lake is called the Ilopango See,
and is nine kilometers long and seven kilometers wide. ‘The level of its
waters was raised before the eruption to such a degree as to make a
flood in the valley of its outlet; and its waters were so heated and im-
pregnated with sulphureted hydrogen as to exterminate the fish, which
were very abundant in the lake. The dead fish were buried with great
labor and expense, in order to avoid pestilence. The volcanic cone in the
lake repeatedly grew to considerable dimensions, and was as repeatedly
blown to pieces. This lake is surrounded by volcanic cones, and re-
minds one of the well-known Laacher See, which, however, has no out-
let. One looks forward to the time when volcanic phenomena near us
will receive the critical and continuous study which alone can make
them of extreme interest.

Some other European voleanoes beside Vesuvius and Etna have been
monographed. The work of F. Fouqué, aided by the French Govern-
ment, on Santorin and its eruptions, is one of the most beautiful and
complete treatises which has been devoted to a voleano. The topog-
raphy of the island, the history of all the eruptions, records of which
exist in history, outlines illustrating the various changes that have
taken place in the form and extent of the island, and beautiful pictures
of the microscopic sections, illustrating the mineral composition of the
various eruptions, all combine to make an interesting and instructive
volume. Santorin is a crescent-shaped island in the Grecian Archipel-
ago. It has several craters, part of which are submarine. The last
eruption occurred in January, 1866, which materially increased the
size of the island. This, together with the other historic and the pre-
historic eruptions, are treated in much detail; and the 440 pages of this
quarto volume show how greatly science is enriched by careful study of
small areas.

LOESS.

The question of the origin of the loess formations has excited much
interest. Loess is that very fine-grained calcareous unstratified deposit
which occupies the river valleys of many rivers, notably the Rhine. It
is characterized by the inclusion of the shells of land snails, and by
concretions of limestone, which take very peculiar shape, looking very
much like potatoes, but liable to take any form. The Germans call them
loess dolls. This deposit is so firm in its texture that when a cut is
made through it, its walls will not crumble and wash away, as do the
walls of ordinary loose material, but for years they will maintain their
vertical surfaces, and preserve marks that are made in them with knives
or walking sticks. Indeed, namesand pictures carved an these loess walls
form one of the characteristic fossils of the formation. Von Richthofen,
who knew this formation well, has shown that it, or a like formation, exists
over large areas in the Asiatic interior, and he has considered that it is

S. Mis. 3115
226 GEOLOGY.

there a wind deposit, and he extends this explanation to the loess in the
valleys. Pumpelly, who has also had opportunity to see these deposits
in the dry steppes of Asia, has agreed with von Richthofen, but his dis-
cussion of the question and the application of the theory to the formation
in the Mississippi Valley, incited dissent from Winchell, Hilgard, Broad-
head, and Todd, all of whom are familiar with the formation in the Mis-
sissippi Valley, and who all agree that no zolian hypothesis will explain
the accumulation of this material, and they consider that the facts show
that it was gathered in quiet fresh waters, though salt-water shells are
not entirely absent. They show that the Mississippi formation is iden-
tical with that in the Rhine Valley, and possesses all its strange pecu-
liarities, and that hence this river valley formation was not made of
drifting sands anchored by grass, such as accumulates upon the steppes
and deserts.
DRIFT.

Another of the great unsettled problems is the origin of the drift
that is, there still remain advocates of opposing theories. Credner does
not hesitate still to refer the drift that covers our northern lands to the
action of floating ice, nor is he alone in his opinion. Mr. Upham, who
worked upon the surface geology in New Hampshire, in connection with
the geological survey, has traced what he considers the terminal
moraine of the great glacier sheet that covered the northern portion of
America, almost across the country. He finds this terminal moraine
stretching along Long Island, westward across New Jersey, and thus
onward. He finds remains as well of a second parallel moraine, far-
ther to the north, which marks a stage in the retreat of the glacier.
It is worth remarking that the drift deposits which cover the extensive
North German plain have been subjected to much and careful study
during this period. The character of the bowlders, which are largely
identical with Scandinavian and Finland rocks, have been much studied,
and those works which have attracted most attention, notably that of
Berendt, do not attempt to explain all facts by referring them all to an
unyielding system. Rather, the facts tend to confirm a belief in the
alternations of the action of floating ice and glacier, and distinctions
between the undoubted action of the one and the other are clearly ree-
ognized. By Mr. Upham, as by most: recent students, the effects in
America have been mostly referred to the action of an immense glacial
sheet, with local tributaries, and to the rush of waters attendant upon
the melting of this body of ice.

COAL.

Small deposits of coal have been found in various geological horizons
lower than the carboniferous. For example, anthracite of silurian age
occurs on the Isle of Man, and is supposed to have been formed from
an accumulation of algz. It has been found in the graptolite bearing
GEOLOGY. 22%

silurian schists of Scotland, Ireland, Portugal, and also in New York
State. But Inostranzeff has shown that a large bed of anthracite,
which is worked on a large scale in the Saoneshje region of Russia, be-
longs to the Huron age. He finds four kinds of carbonaceous mate
rial, and among these graphite is found. This carries the coal period
back into the archzan, and is interesting as throwing some light on the
formation of the graphitic schists. There is, then, no break in the line
of coal-bearing rocks between the crystalline schists, and the rocks
bearing tertiary lignites or the recent peat beds.

The Pennsylvania geologists do not think that position, with reference
to the disturbing forces that have elevated the Appalachian Mountains,
will alone account for the formation of anthracite. The coal deposits
do indeed become more bituminous to the west, but not in such propor-
tion as would be expected if disturbance were the cause. The character
of the strata which cover them, and the depth of burial, are of much
importance in determining the present nature of coal beds.

CLAY SLATE.

The origin of slaty cleavage, except so far as that it results from press-
ure has never been settled. Sorby mixed micaceous hematite with clay,
and by pressure he caused these scales all to assume a Common posi-
tion, and he argued that such pressures, acting in given directions, could
give the structure to any of the schists, and cleavage to the slates by
simply arranging elongated or flattened particles. This experiment has
often been repeated with various modifications, and it surely is a fact
that such pressures acting as indicated have produced many features
that we see in the rocks. Tyndall, however, considered slaty cleavage
a resalt of the flattening of particles. Mr. E. W. Hilgard, with agri-
cultural ends in view, has made experiments upon the flocculation of
particles, and he shows that fine sediments suspended in agitated water
tend to floceulate, and form little masses which, acted upon by compres-
sion, are easily flattened. He, therefore, is strongly of the opinion
that Professor Tyndall is correct. It may further be said concern-
ing clay slates, that microscopic study has tended to modify exist-
ing opinions concerning these. They have been usually considered as
hardened indurated clays, and classed among fragmental rocks. The
microscope reveals in these rocks, however, crystalline elements which
Kalkowski has thought he proved to be staurolite, and which have been
thought by van Werveke and others to be of rutile. The fragmental
nature of the rock is very difficult to establish, and with these evidences
of crystalline structure there is no reason to think that most slate is
anything more than an excessively fine grained kind of mica schist,
made perhaps by the same forces acting in a less efficient manner.

CRYSTALLINE SCHISTS.

I think it can be said that but little progress has been made during
the past two years in the study of the crystalline schists, so far as the
228 GEOLOGY.

theory of their origin is concerned. The same old arguments of the
metamorphism of sediments are advanced, and they are met by the
same objections. One would frequently be tempted to think, on read-
ing treatises that deal with this subject, that the matter was clearly and
well understood, yet there still remain many able scholarsto whom “the
crystalline schists remain,” as Inostranzeff says, ‘lithological hiero-
glyphics.”

Moreover, the study of the rocks themselves has been in a backward
state. Lithologists have now for years been very busy investigating
the eruptive rocks, and the result is that volumes of interesting infor-
mation concerning their nature and composition have been issued, and
a system of classification devised, which, if not satisfactory to all, is at
least suited to the wants of the time. No very systematic work has
thus far been attempted on the schists, and the subject is in a rather
chaotic condition. Yetit can be said that more studies have been made
on local groups of schists during the past two years than ever before,
and many new and interesting varieties have been found, and many facts
accumulated for future systematization. The following circumstances
may be considered as interesting, and may indicate the character of the
work performed.

Olivine has been shown to be a constituent of some hornblende
schists by Kalkowsky, and a great group of stratified olivine rocks,
which occur in Sweden, have been shown by Reusch, and afterward by
Brogger, to belong to the crystalline schists. The time was when oli-
vine was considered as especially characteristic of eruptive rocks, but it
may be considered that it is very far from being confined to this group.

The very abundant occurrence of rutile in the schists has been shown
by several writers, notably by Sauer. This has provoked much discus-
sion, since some minerals, previously referred to Zircon, are probably of
rutile. Zircon is, however, sometimes a constituent of the schists. Mr.
van Werveke thinks the heart-shaped crystals in the whetstone schists
may be of rutile.

It has often been assumed that the rocks composed of triclinic feld-
spar with members of the pyroxene and hornblende group were mostly
eruptive. Even plainly stratified rocks of this kind have been con-
sidered as lava overflows or tuffs. Many studies have been made
in the period under consideration which show that such rocks occur
abundantly among the stratified schists. Benecke and Cohen describe
such in the neighborhood of Heidelberg, and Rolle a whole series of such
from the Rhiitic Alps. Fouque and Levy describe such under the name
of Amphibolite gneiss; Stelzner such from Lapland, and yet many
others have been mentioned. It will be remembered that this is a sub-
ject in which Professors Hunt and Dana have in times past taken much
interest, and the group of crystalline schists is now generally regarded
as including rocks of this class. This is an advance.

Several efforts, notably by A. Sauer, have been made to show that
GEOLOGY. 225

bowlders exist in gneiss. The theories as to the original method of
accumulation of gneisses would be modified by this demonstration.
There still remains, however, too much diversity of opinion concerning
what constitutes a gneiss. It is generally known that a purely eruptive
granite can assume a stratified structure, and many writers are not clear
enough in dividing such stratified granites from the group of crystalline
schists. Little progress will be made till this is done. A gneiss with
bowlders might be a stratified granite, and granites are liable enough
to include strange rocks.

One wr.ter has even urged that gneisses are tuff rocks. He recalls
that the moon’s surface, upon which water has not worked, is entirely
covered with eruptive rocks and voleanic products, and argues there-
from that our oldest rocks must have been volcanic. No one knows,
however, what were our oldest rocks, and it is generally supposed that
the primitive rocks were early and finally buried beneath their own
sediments.

In the mean time Lehmann, Heim, Baltzer, and still others have con-
tributed to our knowledge of the mechanical distortion, the softening
and recrystallizing of pebbles and solid rock masses by geological agen-
cies.

Schists intersected by the Gotthard tunnel, schists from the Fichtel
and Eulengebirge, schists in the districts of all the geological surveys
have been studied and their mineral components determined. Thus
our knowledge of these rocks has been much extended, and one can
conclude that although no theories are generally adopted, a very long
step has been taken in gathering together details of information, which
will all be systematized at some future time.

LITHOLOGY.

The modern methods of lithological research and the results thereby
achieved have never received much attention in annual records, nor in
any popular publications. The dropped thread can therefore scarcely
be with profit taken up as the science stood in 1879.

Lithology has always been recognized as an important department of
geology, and the rocks were studied and systematized long ago. Now
that the methods are so much improved, and questions of composition
are solved with such ease, it is only a wonder to the modern students
how the older students found out as much as they did. By the most la-
borious processes at least, the talented geologists of the past generation
investigated with great acuteness and often discovered with accuracy
the partial composition of the rocks.

The application of the microscope to lithology has now become an old
feature. The studies by Brewster on the gems and crystals, of Sorby
on crystals and on the cavities in the minerals of rocks, of Zirkel on the
basalts, and very many others, have long been classic. These studies
were made by persons of great experience and keen observational
230 GEOLOGY.

powers, who familiarized themselves with the objects that they studied
and learned to recognize them. The great step in advance, for the aid
of the new students, was made by Rosenbusch, who applied the optical
principles discovered and analyzed by Des Cloizeaux to the examination
of microscopic crystals as seen in extremely thin sections of rocks. Des
Cloizeaux having deduced the optical properties of all commonly oceur-
ring minerals, these same properties were sought in the microscopic
sections, and the determination aided by a microscope adapted to the
purpose. The limited knowledge of minerals in general and the lack of
knowledge of optical properties, had been the reason why the suggestion
of Cordier, who in 1816 recommended the employment of the microscope
in geology, had never been to any extent followed. During these last
years a very respectable proportion of the geological literature published
in Germany has been devoted to microscopical lithology. The study
has reached a high state of perfection in France, but less of consequence
has ever been done by the English or Americans. These few words
may serve as an introduction to the progress of the past two years.

As one mark of interest in this subject, the change in the editorship
of perhaps the most important geological magazine should be noted.
The “Jahrbuch fiir Mineralogie und Paleontologie,” which for a half
century had been conducted by Leonhard, and later by Leonhard and
Geinitz, has now passed into the hands of a trio of editors, one of whom
represents mineralogy (Professor Klein, of Géttingen), one paleontology
(Professor Benecke, of Strasburg), and one of whom represents inor-

ganic geology, and to this office Professor Rosenbusch, of Heidelberg,
the eminent lithologist, was called. These gentlemen HER organized a
corps of assistants in the various lands, and aim to make this periodical
a general exponent of progress in the subjects that they cover. They
have issued two volumes during the past year, instead of one as hereto-
fore, and it is certainly very pleasing to the students to have recourse
to such an encyclopedic work now that mineralogical and geological
literature is so extensively published in a multitude of often inacces
sible magazines and proceedings of societies.

The first treatise that has ever been written upon lithology in the
English language has appeared. There have heretofore, it is true, been
translations, notably of von Cotta’s work, and little chapters in geology
have been devoted to lithology ; but von Cotta’s book is old, and the
chapters in geological works laid claim to few pretensions. The new
book is by Frank Rutley, and was published in London. To be sure,
it is very poor, and is mostly abstracted from the writings of Germans,
but it is beginning to be improved upon.

In this country, within the past two years, interesting miscroscopic
lithological work has been done by gentlemen connected with the Wis-
consin geological survey, and some initiative attempts have been made
upon rocks in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Ihave already referred
to the first, and the latter are hardly in a condition to be reviewed yet.
GEOLOGY. Zo

One of the most important additions to lithological literature dur-
ing the past two years is the volume on Minéralogie Micrographique
Roches Eruptives Francaises, by Fouqué and Levy. The volume, though
large, is, however, simply an introduction, and treats of microscopic
minerals and methods of investigation. The volume is accompanied by
a large atlas of fifty-five plates; this contains lithographic and photo-
graphic reproductions of sections as seen under the microscope—pic-
tures which in beauty and accuracy have never heretofore been equalled,
- A question extensively handled in this volume is the means for the
determination of optical properties in chance sections, while the work of
Rosenbusch aimed more to show how one might find sections cut in defi
nite directions, and then determine their optical properties. By a very
elaborate study, Fouqué and Levy deduce what properties sections should
have which might be cut in a multitude of ways through a crystal of
a given kind. This subject for the feldspars had been earlier opened
by Professor Pumpelly, in our country.

Yet however accurate these calculations may be, and how far oe ond
criticism are the results, there are many practical difficulties which will
cause this method to be applied only to a most limited extent. » Much
more practical and fruitful in results is the method which, though not
original with him, Thoulet has applied to the mechanical separation of
rock ingredients. A solution of the iodide of potassium will dissolve
mercury iodide, and the resultant fluid is heavier than the more common
rock ingredients, which consequently will float upon it. By addition of
water the density of this fluid can be reduced to any desired point, and
the various constituent minerals that compose the powder of a rock
which is thrown into and mixed with this fluid can be made to settle
out one by one in a state of purity and fit for analysis. This method
has already yielded practical results; one of these is the demonstration
that rocks are even more complex in mineral composition than had
been supposed.

This brings us back once more to the question of the feldspathic con-
stituent of rocks, which is of much importance, because feldspar is the
most generally distributed of all rock constituents. Many methods
have been proposed for their determination. Optical methods usually
allow potash feldspar to be distinguished from the other species, but
if more than one of the other kinds be present, optical methods only
allow the one with greatest obliqity of elasticity planes to be determined.
Consequently, rocks have been usually determined as being composed
of one species of triclinic feldspar with other minerals, or of one species
of triclinic feldspar with orthoclase and other minerals. Fouqué, in his
work on Santorin, indicated that the feldspathic constituent of rocks
was more complex, and the application of the specific gravity fluid bids
fair to prove that this complexity is quite general.
Be GEOLOGY.
CONTACT PHENOMENA.

But the determination of the mineral composition of rocks is not the
highest end of microscopic work. The mere enumeration of the compo-
nents of various stones can prove wearisome in the extreme. When
the microscope comes to aid in the solution of geological problems, then
its developments become of the greatest interest. It has been applied
with greatest success in the study of the changes induced on schists and
stratified rocks by the influence of eruptive masses. The study of these
so-called contact phenomena had been pursued by students such as
Daubree and Lossen, in the field, with most satisfactory results, but it
never became so interesting as when Rosenbusch applied the microscope
and chemical analysis to the study of the rocks that lay against the gran-
ites in the Vosges.

Another remarkable case of contact has during the past year been
studied and described by myself. In the celebrated Crawford Notch of
the White Mountains an immense mass of granite, many square miles
in extent, comes in contact with an area of hydrous schists. If one ap-
proaches this contact from the side of the granite, most marked changes
are seen to take place, and changes of such a nature that the granite
would not be recognized as such in the neighborhood of the contact. In
fact, it becomes a quartz porphyry. But the microscope and analysis
prove that it is the same granite only modified in the style of its erys-
talization by the quicker cooling induced by the cold walls. On the side
of the schist, however, not merely have the rocks been physically altered
by the heat of the granite, but they have been materially altered in com-
position, and filled with new minerals by reason of an impregnation with
vapors and solutions brought up and forced far intothem by the eruption
of the granite. The granite upon the contact is mixed with fragments
of various kinds of schist which were torn from the walls as the molten
rock ascended, and the granite has in places thrown long arms out into
the schist. There are seven distinct zones marked by different minerals
and structural features between the granite and schist, and these zones
have definite boundaries and owe their origin to the contact. This
same granite in meeting the schists at another point has induced the
same series of zones, but the zone of mixed schists and granite is moun-
tain great, forming, in fact, Kearsarge and Moat Mountains. I speak of
this study as a stage of progress because contact phenomena have re-
ceived little attention in America, and the features that determine the
eruptive nature of a granite have been ill defined. Granite means al-
most anything in this country, and most of the granite masses, including
this one, have by some been classed among metamorphic rocks. Internal
structure and lines of stratification, which granites frequently present
have been considered as evidences of sedimentary and metamorphic ori-
gin, although it is well known that voleanic products are often stratified.

GEOLOGY. Dae

Evidences of the origin of many such rocks are to be obtained by the
study of contact phenomena, and the true line of division between gran-
ite and gneiss is to be thus deduced.

EXPERIMENTAL GEOLOGY.

There has of late years been much less interest felt in speculative ge-
ology ; or rather, it has been the tendency to bring geological phenomena
more easily within the limits of common comprehension by showing that
analogous effects can be produced by very simple causes that are within
our control or limits of our observation. The great work by Charies
Lyell on the principles of geology, in which he showed that the geo.
logical forces that are daily active about us, if allowed to operate a suffi-
cient time, would produce the results that are described by geologists,
was a great move in this direction, and students have been ever more
and more active in attempting to reproduce phenomena seen in nature
in the lavoratory. Daubrée, who has been very active in this direction,
has brought together all his researches into a single volume, which he
calls “Synthetic Studies upon Experimental Geology.” Here one finds
the results of his celebrated studies on the minerals formed by the hot
water in the old Roman baths, on the minerals formed in sealed tubes
containing very hot water, and on the production of minerals by pro-
cesses of sublimation. Here, also, are detailed the results of experiments
designed to stratify plastic materials in imitation of rocks, to joint and
cleave rocks as it is done in nature, and results of experiments designed
to form artificially products of the nature and composition of meteorites.
The book is a fascinating one, and contains in addition many new facts.

Besides this voluminous work, many contributions have been inade
to experimental geology, some of which are referred to under the head
of mineralogy. It is proper to notice here the circumstance that
Fouqué and Levy have accurately reproduced leucitic lavas like those
that have issued from Vesuvius, as well as nephelin-holding and other
common volcanic rocks. This is interesting, because leucite passes as
an infusible mineral, and for this reason, and because it is not always
the first mineral to crystallize in these rocks, the question has been dis-
cussed whether these lavas result from a purely igneous fusion. So far
as the possibilities of the case are concerned, the question may be
regarded as settled.

: EOZOON CANADENSE.

Perhaps no question in American geology has excited such long and
bitter controversy, participated in by students who have considered it
from such varied standpoints, as the question of the organic or inorganic
nature of this form that has been found in the rocks of various lands.
Those who have believed in it most fully have been those most familiar
with its mode of occurrence, and this has always strengthened their
case, Supported as it has been by eminent zodlogical authority. Yet
234 GEOLOGY.

mineralogists have never found it difficult to explain its formation by
purely inorganic forces. Perhaps the question has never been so near
settlement as when, shortly ago, Karl Mobius, professor of zodlogy at
Kiel, published a most exhaustive study of specimens obtained in part
from the original describers. He concluded, after careful micrescopie
study and comparison with assumed allied forms, that there is nothing
to justify the supposition of its organic nature. His opinion was, in-
deed, not of sufficient weight to convince those of fixed opposite opinion,
neither will probably agreement be ever reached in this generation, for,
as the believers in it say, the evidences are before us and we have but
to form our judgment.

SUBMARINE GEOLOGY.

Mr. Alexander Agassiz, incidentally to his work of dredging in the
deep waters of the Atlantic, has found that shallow waters connect the
West Indian islands with the South American continent, and this,
together with the notable fact that the flora and fauna of these islands
are related to those of Central America, and not to those of the southern
United States, indicate that in past time these were very probably a
part of the southern continent. This may be considered as another
addition to geology, gained by the investigation of the ocean’s bottom,
so many of which were gained by the British expeditions. Professor
Verrill has found tertiary fossiliferous rocks by dredging off the north-
ern coasts.

CHEMICAL GEOLOGY.

The work upon general and chemical geology by Justus Roth, one
volume of which is now issued, will be a most important addition to
literature. ‘This first volume treats of the formation and decomposition
of minerals, of spring, river, and sea water, and their depositions. It
contains in abstract, with references, all the work which, up to the pres-
ent time, has been done upon these subjects, and contains, besides, many
original contributions. Indeed, this work promises in all its parts to
form a kind of compendium of the science, which is much needed.

AMERICAN ASSOCIATION.

The American Association for the Advancement of Science met this
year at Boston, and the number of papers presented upon geological
and mineralogical subjects was so large that a permanent subsection
was organized to accommodate those especially interested in these sci-
ences. The election also of Professor Brush, one of our most distin-
guished mineralogists, to the office of president of the association is an
indication of the appreciation by the association of labors in these
departments.

PHYSICS.

By GeorGe F. BARKER,

Professor of Physics in the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.

GENERAL.

Great activity has been manifested in physics during the years
1879-80. New and important discoveries have been made, improved
modes of research have been devised, greater accuracy has been at-
tained in measures of precision, and more uniform and precise stand:
ards have been adopted as units. Sainte-Claire Deville and Maseart
communicated to the International Geodetic Association an elaborate
paper describing the construction and giving the properties of the new
platinum-iridium standard of length. The alloy was made by Johnson,
Matthey & Co., by fusing together 450 ounces of platinum and 55
ounces of iridium. After suitable working, it was drawn through a
draw-plate into abaraccurately rectangularin cross-section. Its density
now was 21.51; and it was found to contain platinum 89.41, iridium
10.19, rhodium 0.17, ruthenium 0.10, iron 0.06. This alloy is harder and
more resistant than platinum, is much more rigid, and has a high elas-
ticity, its modulus being 21,912,000,000, and its elongation-coefficient
0.0003. Its coefficient of expansion was in course of determination by
Mascart, the elaborate preliminary measurements only being described.—
(Ann. Chim. Phys., V, xvi, 506, April, 1879.) C.S. Peirce has reported
progress in the comparison of a wave-length with a meter. Using a
Rutherford ruled plate of 3404 lines to the millimeter, three complete
measures of Van der Willigen’s spectrum line No. 16 gave for the angle
of double deviation as a mean 89° 54’ 19”.5 An error of 0.4 would
make an error of a micron in the length of the meter. Subsequently
another line near the former one was selected, and a finer plate was
used. As a mean of six closely accordunt measures, the double devia-
tion was 90° 03’ 51.45. One of these plates had been compared with
all the centimeters of a decimeter scale. The other is to be compared
with the even two centimeters of the same scale. This decimeter scale
was in progress of comparison by Mr. Chapman with the decimeters of
a mneter scale. When done, a meter will have been compared with a
wave-length.—(Am. J. Sci., III, xviii, 51, July, 1879.) W. A. Rogers
has communicated valuable papers on metrological subjects, among

which may be mentioned those on “ The limits of accuracy in measure-
ments with the telescope and the microscope” (Proc. Am. Acad., II, vi,
168), on ‘Standard measures of length,” and ‘On two forms of com-
parators for measures of length” (Am. Q. Mic. J., January and April, 1879),
and ‘“‘On the present state of the question of standards of length.”—
(Proc. Am. Acad., II, vii, 273.) More recently this physicist has de-
scribed the construction and early performances of a new diffraction
ruling-engine, which promises most valuable and important results.—
(Am. J. Sci., III, xix, 54, January, 1880.) Hilgard has published, under
date of July 10, 1880, an admirable report upon the methods and results
of a comparison of the American and British standards of length, in-
tended to form Appendix 12 to the Coast Survey Report for 1877. The
final conclusions with reference to the American standards are that
bronze No. 11 is standard at 629.25 F., iron No. 57 at 629.10 F., and the
mean yard of Troughton scale at 59°.62 F.

With reference to the molecular constitution of matter, Sir William
Thomson has continued his researches upon the “ Vortex atom theory,”
and has communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh papers upon
“Vortex statics” and upon “ Vibrations of a columnar vortex,” in which
the treatment is mathematical.—( Phil. Mag., V,x,97, August, 1880.) Tol-
ver Preston has discussed the physical aspects of the vortex atom theory,
with a view to reconcile the proved indestructibility of the atom with its
capacity for executing vibrations. Heillustrates the motion of the material
forming the vortex atom by supposing a cylinder of India rubber to be
rotated about its longitudinal axis, and then, while still-rotating, to be
bent into the form of a ring and the ends joined. Such a portion of
moving matter, mathematics has proved to have all the qualities of a
solid. It is elastic, and is competent to execute vibrations of definite
periods. Moreover, it is incapable of being divided or severed by the
collisions of other similar atoms. In short, such vortex atoms are elastic,
indestructible bodies, capable of rebounding from each other without
loss of energy, and of executing vibrations of fixed periods.—( Nature, xxii,
56, 1880).

Riihimann, from considerations founded on Avogadro’s law, has given
some calculations on the dimensions of molecules. The radius of the
sphere of action for the nitrogen molecule he gives as 34x 10~—° centi-
meter; for the carbon dioxide molecule, 16x 10~° centimeter; and for
the hydrogen molecule, 41x10-° centimeter. Since one cubic centi-
meter at 0° and 760™ pressure contains nearly 100 trillions of molecules,
it follows that the molecules themselves fill only about the three-thou-
sandth part of the entire volume which the gas occupies. The author
gives 15x 10-* gram as the absolute weight of a hydrogen molecule, and
360 as the specific weight.—(Beibl. Ann. Phys. Chem., No. 2, 57, 1879.)
Hodges has also given a computation of the size of molecules, based on
the work required to convert water into steam, this conversion being
considered as a breaking up of the water into a. large number of small

parts, proportionally increasing the total surface. Supposing the mole-
cules to be spherical, he gets for their radius 0.000000005", or 5 to 6
(million)* for the number in one cubie centimeter; agreeing with the
results of Thomson and Maxwell.—(Am. J. Sci., III, xviii, 135, August,
1879.) Ina subsequent paper, the same author gives a calculation of
the mean free path of the molecules in the vapor of water lying close to
the liquid surface, which he finds to be 0.0000024™".—( Am. J. Sci., TI,
xix, 222, March, 1880.)

MECHANICS.
1. Of Solids.

The motions of finely divided solid particles when immersed in liquids,
commonly called the Brownian movement, and those of dust-particles
in air, have both been attributed to the same cause, the shock of colliding
molecules. Nageli has calculated from the data of the kinetic theory
what the velocity of the smallest fungus-particle observable with the
microscope should be, supposing an oxygen or nitrogen particle to come
in collision with it. Since such a particle is 300 million times heavier
than the molecule, the velocity would not be greater than that of the
hour hand of a watch. For ordinary motes, the motion would be 50 mil-
lion times slower. The same results essentially were obtained for liquids;
whence the author thinks the Brownian movements are phenomena con-
nected with the surface tension of the liquid.—( Ber. Ak. Miinchen, 1879,
389.)

Buchanan has communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh a pa-
per on the compressibility of glass, using a rod of this material placed
in a receiver of steel with glass ends connected with a hydraulic pymp.
The compression is read by means of micrometer microscopes, and the
pressure is determined by a manometer consisting of a mercurial ther-
mometer with a stout bulb, previously calibrated in a piezometer, the
bulb being immersed in the water under pressure, while the stem pro-
jects outside. The glass used was a flint glass, and the compression
was observed up to 40 atmospheres. The cubical compression observed
was, for each atmosphere, 2.92 parts in a million. Incidentally the
compressibility of water at 2°.5 C. was found to be 0.05160 volume per
thousand per atmosphere; and its diminution with rise of temperature
was confirmed, being 0.04831 at 129.5 C.—( Nature, xxii, 377, 1880.) Barus
has studied the influence of hardness upon the thermo-electric proper-
ties and the specific resistance of steel. The steel used was in the form
of wire and was hardened by heating it by an electric current, in a glass
tube through which a stream of carbon dioxide gas was passed and
then suddenly admitting water. The resistance and the electromotive
force vary with the hardness, so that if the electromotive force be taken
as a measure of the hardness and the magnetic constant of the steel,
the resistance is a linear function of it.—(Phil. Mag., V, viii, 341, No-
vember, 1879.) Marangoni, with reference to Bottomley’s experiment

of passing a wire through ice without cutting it in two, divides plastic
substances into two classes. Those belonging to the first class, can, like
ice, be cut in two with a metallic wire, and can be considerably deformed.
To this class belong plastic clay, fresh soap, camphor, black pitch. Sub-
stances classed in the second group give two lamellz on the two sides
of the cutting wire, which then come out of the slit, become notched and
bend over, resembling leaves. Examples of this class are found in veg-
etable Japanese wax, dry Marseilles soap, tallow, and stearin, and
especially yellow wax and paraffin. The success of the experiment de-
pends on the size of the wire and on the temperature. For yellow wax,
the wire should be from 4 to 1™™. diameter; for paraffin 4 to 0.9. The
leaves with the former are produced between —8° and 40°, with the lat-
ter (melting at 43°.5) only up to 15°. The author calls attention to the
similarity between these lamella and those separated from a rail when
a locomotive goes down a steep incline rapidly and with a powerful
brake applied.—( Nature, xxi, 21, 1879.)

Herschel has published a paper on the use of the seconds pendulum
for determining the figure of the earth, in which he comes to the conclu-
sion that the experiments made hitherto are of little use, since the prob-
lem to be solved was so imperfectly grasped. The use of the absolute
pendulum contemplated two distinct objects which had no essential con-
nection, the force of gravity and the figure of the earth; while the use |
of the differential pendulum contemplated only one. The rate of the
seconds pendulum varies along the actual equator, and the value of grav-
ity at the equator is therefore only an idea.—(Nature, xxi, 599, 1880.)
C. 8. Peirce has given the results of his pendulum experiments made
under the direction of the Coast Survey. The values obtained were:
At Hoboken, 0.9932052™ ; at Paris, 0.9939337 ; at Berlin, 0.9942399 ; at
Kew 0.9941776. Reduced to the sea-level these numbers become 0.993-
2074, 0.9939500,,0.9942482, and 0.9941790. Reduced to the equator, they
are: 0.9910003, 0.9910132, 0.9909865, and 0.9910083. These values, the
author thinks, will have to be diminished by about 20 microns on ac-
count of the error of the standard of length employed.—(Am. J. Sci.,
III ,xx, 327, October, 1880.) Mendenhall has made a series of experi-
ments to determine the force of gravity at Tokio, Japan. In the earlier
part of the investigation a Kater pendulum was used; in the latter, one
of Borda’s construction. The beats were recorded upon a chronograph
at the same time with those of a break-circuit clock, the length of one
second upon the sheet being about (gmm, so that it could easily be
subdivided. Since it was only the fractional part of a second by which
the two pendulums differed, that was to be determined, the standard
pendulum was only required to break the circuit twice, once at the be-
ginning and again at the end of the experiment. As a mean of six ex-
periments with the Kater pendulum the value of ‘“‘g” was found to be
9.7974; the mean of eleven experiments with the Borda pendulum gave |
9.7984.—(Am. J. Sci., III, xx, 124, August, 1880.)

Deprez has contrived a new velocity-rezulator for electric motors. It
consists essentially of an elastic spring, fastened at one of its extremi-
ties to the rotating axis and parallel to it. To the other end is attached
a small mass of brass traversed by a screw by which its distance from
the axis may be adjusted, and the tension of the spring at the same time
increased. The current which drives the motor passes through this
spring. If now the rotation is so rapid that the free end of the spring
is thrown away from the axis by the centrifugal force, the contact is
broken and the current is interrupted; the speed of the motor is dimin-
ished, contact is renewed, and so on, the velocity being exactly regu-
lated by the adjusting screw.—(J. Phys., viii, 10, January, 1870.) Fon-
vielle has devised a form of gyroscope whose rotation is produced by
magneto-electrie currents. A flat coil of wire, like that used in galvan-
ometers, has an intermittent current sent into it from an induction coil.
When a star-shaped piece of iron, mounted on a pivot so as to rotate
like a compass-needle, is placed in the center of the coil, it begins to re-
volve whenever a horse-shoe magnet is placed above it vertically, or
when a bar magnet is placed in certain directions with reference to it.
Reversing the direction of the current reverses the direction of the rota-
tion.—( Nature, xxi, 593, April, 1880.)

2. Of Liquids.

Rudorff has described a special form of volumenometer used by him
for the determination of the specific gravity of powders. The new ap-
paratus is composed entirely of glass, and consists of a cylindrical reser-
voir of 25°¢ capacity, from the lower part of which a tube passes, this tube
being enlarged just below the reservoir, and having a cock at its lower
end. The reservoir is closed at top by a ground stopper furnished with
a stopcock, and to it laterally is attached a long U-shaped manometer
tube. Mercury is poured into the reservoir until the tube is filled to
the mark on the neck. The upper cock is closed and the mercury drawn
out into a tared vessel till the difference of level between the two mer-
cury surfaces in the manometer is a certain quantity h. After the mer-
cury is weighed it is poured back into the tube, the substance whose
specific gravity is to be determined is introduced into the reservoir and
the above operations are repeated.* Simple caleulation gives the value
required.—(Ann. Phys. Ohem., I, vi, 288, 1879.) Buignet has improved
the Nicholson areometer by making the stem longer and larger, marking
zero at the point to which it sinks in water when empty, and n at the
point to which it sinks when loaded with n grams. To use it, the in-
strument is placed in water and sinks to zero. The mineral whose grav-
ity is desired is placed on the upper pan; the stem is immersed to a
point P. Placed in the lower pan, it sinks the stem toa point, P’.. Then

p—p’ 1s the density of the specimen. The sensitiveness of the instru-

ment depends on the size of the stem. Its use is rapid and accurate.—
(J. Phys., ix, 93, March, 1880.)
240 PHYSICS.

Spring has continued his investigations on the welding of solid bodies
by pressure, and has now subjected more than eighty pulverized solids
to pressures in vacuo up to 10,000 atmospheres, varying at the same
time the temperature. All the crystalline bodies proved capable of
welding, and in the case of amorphous bodies, crystalline structure had
been developed in the block by the pressure. He classifies amorphous
bodies into two groups, one like wax and called ciroid, which weld easily,
the other like amorphous carbon, which do not weld, and hence called
aciroid. The facts observed do not essentially differ from those observed
when two drops of a liquid meet and unite. Hardness is a relative,
even a subjective, term. Even water may appear hard to certain insects,
and if our bodies were sufficiently heavy, the pavement would not bear
us. The change of prismatic to octohedral sulphur, of amorphous to
metallic phosphorus, by compression, the change of state of amorphous
bodies, the chemical action produced when the product has a less volume
than the constituents, all result in a denser form of matter. Whence the
conclusion that the particular state taken by matter is in relation to the
volume it is obliged to occupy under the action of external forces. The
geological bearing of these facts is very evident.—(Nature, xxii, 350,
1880.)

Ridout shows the surface tension of mercury by supporting a shallow
tray, 6 by 3 inches, on leveling screws, so inclined that the mercury is
on the point of overflowing. If now the flow of the mercury be started,
it will draw the rest of the liquid after it. The mercury must be very
pure or it will leave a trail.—(Nature, xxii, 157, 1880.)

Lechat has studied the forms produced when liquids are caused to
vibrate in vessels of rectangular section, and has compared the results
obtained with those required by theory. The vessels employed were
made of wood or glass, with walls a centimeter thick. The liquid was
vibrated by a bar of steel placed before an electro-magnet, which bar
_ automatically interrupted the current. To one end of a transverse rod
a stem was attached which could be adjusted to any point of the sur-
face. The nodal lines were very distinct, and the phenomena were very
striking, especially when projected on the screen.—(J. Phys., ix, 185,
June, 1880.)

Sir William Thomson read a paper to the British Association on a sep-
tum permeable to water but not to air, and suggested its application to a
gauge for measuring depths. A small quantity of water in a capillary
tube, with both ends in air, acts like a perfectly air-tight plug against
difference of pressure at its two ends equal to the hydrostatic pressure
corresponding to the height at which water stands in the same capillary
tube when it is held upright with one end under water and the other in
air. In the meeting, he used an Argand-lamp chimney which had a
finely-woven piece of cotton cloth tied over it. When dry, the water rose
easily when the uncovered end was immersed, as well as when the cov-
ered one was. But after wetting the cloth, it seemed perfectly air-tight
PHYSICS. 241

even under 9 inches water-pressure. The depth-gauge is made by tying
a piece of cloth over the mouth of the larger leg of a U-tube, the end of
the smaller being closed by a stopper. On sinking it the air is com-
pressed, and water enters through the cloth into the smaller leg. On
raising it the air expands and forces the water out through the cloth to
the last drop. The depth can be determined from the water left in the
smaller leg of the instrument.—(Nature, xxii, 548, 1880.)

3. Of Gases.

Hannay and Hogarth have communicated to the Royal Society a re-
markable paper on the solubility of solids in gases, the research being
the starting point of the experiments which have since enabled the
former to produce crystallized carbon. They desired to investigate the
solvent power of liquids at temperatures at or above their critical points.
For if at the critical point there really occurs a transition from the liquid
to the gaseous state, and if the property of dissolving solids is one pos-
sessed by liquids alone, there ought to be precipitation of the dissolved
solid matter as the substance passes through the critical point. Absence
of such precipitation would furnish a strong independent proof of the
perfect continuity of the liquid and gaseous states. <As a preliminary
test, a solution of potassium iodide in alcohol was prepared and a strong
tube one-half filled with it. No precipitation of any solid was observable
even at 300° C., more than 100° above the critical point of alcohol.
Resin dissolved in paraffin spirit showed no decomposition at 560°.
With an improved and simplified apparatus, it was shown that a clean
crystal of potassium iodide dissolved entirely in alcohol gas (the term
“oas” referring to the fluid above its critical point). Potassium bromide.
and calcium chloride were also soluble in this gas. Cobaltous chloride
remained soluble at 520° and showed its blue color and characteristic
spectrum. Even the acid decomposition-product of chlorophyll, which
decomposes in the air below 2009, gives, when dissolved in alcohol, iden-
tical spectra at 350° and at 15° C. Some curious reactions were ob-
served. Thus alcohol or ether deposits ferric chloride just below the-
critical point, but redissolves it in the gas when raised 8° or 10° above-
that point. By suddenly reducing the pressure, the solid is precipitated
erystalline, falling as a snow. It is redissolved in the gas as the press-
sure increases.—(Proc. Roy. Soc., xxx, 178; Nature, xxi, 82, 499, 1880.)

Bottomley has described a neat experiment by Quincke, first sug-
gested by some experiments to test the porosity of glass. A glass tube,
5 inches long and three-fourths inch external diameter, with stout walls,
was closed at one end and constricted a little more than half way up.
Into the lower closed portion some sulphurie acid was poured, and above
the constriction some fragments of marble were placed. The tube was
then drawn off at top, thickened, and carefully annealed. On inverting
it the acid attacked the marble, and carbon dioxide was evolved. For
the first few days nothing peculiar was noticeable; but soon the liquid

S. Mis. 31——16
24? PHYSICS.

began to creep away from the glass, scarcely wetting it, and no doubt
was entertained that soon the phenomenon seen in Quincke’s tubes would
appear, and the acid would roll about in the tube like mereury. The
explanation is that these peculiar capillary phenomena are due to a thick
layer of gas that is condensed over the surface of the glass.—(Nature,
xx, 291, 1880.)

De la Rue and Miiller, reasoning from their electric researches on the
spark in rarefied air, believe themselves entitled to conclude on the
probable height of our atmosphere. The least resistance to an electric
discharge in hydrogen is obtained at a pressure of 0.642™™, or 845 M
(M signifying millionths of an atmosphere). When it reaches .002™™, or
3M, the discharge only just passes with a potential of 11,000 silver chloride
cells (11,330 volts). At the highest exhaustion, 0.000055™™, or 0.066 M,
no discharge took place with the 11,000 cells, but even a 1-inch spark
failed to pass. Since a discharge at atmospheric pressure which occurs
in hydrogen at 0.22 inch takes place in air only at 0.13 inch, the authors
conclude that the least resistance for air is at 0.379™™, or 498.6 M. This
pressure would be reached at a height of 37.67 miles above the sea.
Hence here the auroral discharge would have its maximum brillianey,
and would be visible 585 miles. The best vacuum produced, 0.066 M,
eorresponds to a height of 81.47 miles. At this height the discharge
would be considerably less brilliant. At a height of 124.15 miles the
pressure would be only .00000001™™, or 0.00001 M, and at such a height
it is not conceivable that a discharge would occur with any probable
potential. Ata pressure of 62™™ the discharge has the well-known e¢ar-
mine tint of the aurora. This corresponds to an altitude of 12.4 miles.
At a pressure of 1.5™™ it becomes salmon-tint, and at 0.8™™ much paler.
Above this exhaustion it becomes a pale milky white.—( Nature, xxi, 33,
1880.)

Debrun has suggested an improved barometer, which he calls an
amplifying barometer. It resembles the Fortin instrument in general,
but the point marking the zero is at the top of the tube. The cistern
has a second tube in its top, open to the air, and into which the mercury
rises, so that the reading is the difference of the levels of the mercury
surfaces in the two tubes. A third and narrower tube, also open at top,
passes through the top of the cistern. This cistern is larger than ordi-
nary, and contains water above the mercury, into which this tube dips,
and which rises into it, the level being read by means of a graduated
scale. Any variation of the height of the mercury is multiplied in the
water-column in the ratio of the section of the cistern to that of the
water-tube. Hence the sensibility of such a barometer is equal to that
of the water-barometer.—(J. Phys., ix, 387, November, 1880.)

Jordan has constructed and erected in the Kew Observatory a barom-
eter in which the liquid employed is glycerin colored with aniline-red.
As manufactured by Price & Co, the glycerin has a specific gravity of
1.26. Hence the mean height of the column is 27 feet, and a variation
a

PHYSICS. 2A3

of one-tenth of an inch of the mercurial column is more than an inch on
the glycerin scale. Moreover, the high boiling point of glycerin, 440°
F., its very low vapor tension, and its low freezing point are all in its
favor. The cistern in the Kew instrument is a cylindrical vessel of tinned
copper, 10 inches diameter and 5 deep, with a screw cover, the air having
aecess through a small hole in the cap of this, and passing through a
layer of cotton wooi to keep out the dust. The tube is of composition-
metal gas-pipe 3 inch diameter, which is soldered to a similar piece of
pipe which enters the cistern through its bottom and is closed by a
screw plug. To the top of the main tube, a glass tube 4 feet long and
1 inch inside diameter is cemented. It terminates in a cup and is closed
with an India-rubber stopper. The fluctuations are read off by means
of two verniers, one of which gives inches and tenths and the other the
equivalent value of the mercurial column. Daily observations are being
made upon it with a view to determine its accuracy.—( Nature, xxi, 377,
1880.)

Terquem has proposed a modified form of air-pump plate, which dis-
penses with the costly grinding necessary in the present form. The plate
is of brass, circular in form and about a millimeter in thickness, having
a circular cavity in it two centimeters deep and one wide, placed a few
centimeters from the edge, the mean diameter of this depression being
that of the bell to be used with it. When the plate is to be used it is
heated and the cavity filled witha cement melting at about 60° C. That
used by the author is furnished by I’. Carré with his ice-pump, and con-
sists of a mixture of resin, wax, and tallow. When melted the bell is
placed in position and the heat continued until the glass has also be-
come hot. The whole is then allowed to cool. The cheapness of these
plates allows the use of several of them for the various air-pump experi-
ments.—(J. Phys., ix, 346, October, 1880.) Rood has described an im-
provement in the form of the Sprengel pump, by which vacua as high
@S goudoo0n OF yosDd000s are readily obtained. First, the mercury
passes through an exhausted bulb to free it from air and moisture, then
through a nearly horizontal tube to the fall-tube. Secondly this fall
tube is bent four times at a little more than aright angle, forming a
lateral loop or valve, preventing the air that has passed out of the fall-
tube from returning into it. The pump is free from stopcocks and grease,
and its action is very rapid, two or three hours sufficing to reduce the
vacuum from 50 M to 0.01 M, the capacity being 100°°. Even in the
absence of all drying materials a vacuum as high as 0.033 M has been
obtained.—(Am. J. Sei., II, xx, 57, July, 1580.)

Bertin, in an interesting article on the modern methods for producing
high vacua, deseribes the McLeod gauge, that necessary adjunct to the
Sprengel pump. It depends on ge principle that if the volume of a
rarefied gas be reduced » times, the pressure becomes measurable, and
the original pressure is equal to the measured pressure divided by x. It
consists of a bulb of glass surmounted by a thick tube 10 to 15°" long

a,

and 2 or 3™™ in diameter, closed at top and carefully calibrated. Below,
the bulb connects with a straight tube 80°™ long, a lateral tube opening
jnto it just below the bulb and leading upward to the pump. The ¢éa-
pacity of the bulb above the lateral opening is ascertained by weighing
the mercury which fills it. Thus the ratio of the volumes of the bulb
and of the small tube above it is known. The long tube is connected
at its lower end with a reservoir of mercury by means of a rubber tube,
so that when thisis raised the gauge may be filled with mercury. After
the vacuum has been made in the pump, of which the gauge forms a.
part, the reservoir is lifted and the mercury rises in the long tube until
it passes the mouth of the lateral tube and seals off the air in the bulb.
As the mercury fills the bulb, the air collects in the small tube, and the
pressure under which it exists is the difference of level of the mercury
in this tube and the side tube. Knowing the volumes and the final press-
ure the initial pressure is given by Marriotte’s law. Mr. Crookes regards
it reliable to the millionth of an atmosphere, 0.000760™™. Warren de la
Rue limits its indications at 0.00005™".—(Ann. Chim. Phys., V, xix, 231,
February, 1880.)

Amagat has studied elaborately the variation of gaseous bodies from
the law of Marriotte at high pressures, exact measurements being made
of the changes in volume when the gas sustained a mercury column
over one-fifth of a mile high. The shaft of the Verpilleux coal mine,
near St. Etienne, 3527™ in depth, was chosen, the experiments here being
confined to nitrogen gas. A powerful and specially constructed pump
forced mercury at the same time up the manometer tube and into the
tube containing the gas. Since both were carefully calibrated, the meas-
urement in the former gave the pressure and in the latter the volume.
In nitrogen the compressibility increases slowly and reaches a maximum
at about 65 atmospheres. Then it decreases equally slowly, reaching a —
normal figure at about 91 atmospheres. Finally it decreases rapidly,
till at 430 atmospheres the volume is five-fourths of that required by
Marriotte’s law. This law of nitrogen being ascertained, the manometer
tube was replaced by a nitrogen tube and the other gases compared
with that. Air, oxygen, hydrogen, carbonous oxide, ethylene, and marsh
gas were examined up to 400 atmospheres. The results are given graphi-
cally, the abscissas representing pressures and the ordinates the differ-
ences between the product of the volumes by the pressures and unity,
i. e., to the deviations from Marriotte’s law. Hydrogen only does not
exhibit a minimum of volume and pressure product.—(Ann. Chim. Phys.,
V, xix, 345, March, 1880.) Cailletet has also studied the law of the com-
pression of nitrogen. He used a steel laboratory tube, within which
was a piezometer tube containing the gas. To the laboratory tube was
attached a tube of soft steel 250™ loge, rolled upon a wooden cylinder
2™ in diameter. The laboratory tube was supported by a steel wire 4™™
diameter, carefully graduated. The gas tube being put in place, the
apparatus was filled with mereury and lowered by a windlass into an arte-

sian well. The pressure was read off on the graduated suspending wire.
To determine the volume, the inside of the piezometer tube was gilded,
and the height to which the mercury rose in it was shown by the removal
of the gold. The measurements were carried on with nitrogen to 182
atmospheres. Cailletet has also studied the effect of pressure on gaseous
mixtures, and has described a method by which a pressure of 1,500 at-
mospheres may be measured to within one-half of 1 per cent. of its true
value.—(J. Phys., vill, 267; ix, 192; Ann. Chim. Phys., V, xix, 386,

ACOUSTICS.

Carmichael has devised a revolving jet to be used with Koenig’s mano-
metric capsule for the purpose of showing sonorous vibrations in class
instruction. A tube bent at right angles and tipped with a jet is sur-
rounded at its extremity by a second concentric tube also bent at right
angles, but in the opposite direction, so that the two bent parts are in
the same line and form an axis about which the jet revolves. A mica
cylinder incloses the flame, which is that of ordinary gas, enriched, if
necessary, with benzene and fed with oxygen. The gas tube is in com-
munication with a Koenig capsule, so that the flame is thrown into vi-
bration by means of it. On rotating the jet by a multiplying wheel
a brilliant ring of light appears, which is broken up into saw-teeth by
sounds.—(Am. J. Sci., TI, xix, 312, April, 1880.)

Schwedoff has described a simple apparatus for studying the vibra-
tions of cords, which consists in an electric vibrator like that in use for
bells. The cord is attached to the armature at one end, the other being
fastened to a movable clamp which slides along the top of a blackened
board divided into a number of equal divisions. To the clamp the cord
is attached by a screw, by which its tension may be regulated at pleas-
ure.—(J. Phys., vill, 23, January, 1879.)

Mereadier has exhibited in Paris a vibration micrometer for accurately
determining the vibration-amplitude of tuning-forks and other vibrating
bodies. A small piece of thin white paper bearing a fine black line is
fastened to the body whose vibrations are to be measured. If this line
is upright it will present, when caused to vibrate, the appearance of a
pale gray parallelogram, the persistence of the visual impression being
perfectly definite for the extreme positions of the vibration. To ascer-
tain the amplitude of the vibration, all that is necessary is to measure
the apparent width of this minute parallelogram in a direction at right
angles to the axis of symmetry of the oscillation. To increase the pre-
cision, the reference line is set, not perpendicular to the direction of the
movement, but inclined to it at a small angle. A fine scale of lines is
made upon the paper parallel to the direction of the movement and a
millimeter distant. The width of the parallelogram is thus read off
along a straight line, which makes a small angle with its sides, thus
giving the quotient of the amplitude sought by the tangent of a small

angle. With this apparatus the author has studied the motions of a
tuning-fork vibrating electrically.—( Nature, xxi, 189, 1879.)

Koenig has studied the influence of temperature on the vibrations of
a normal tuning-fork. He finds that up to 50° or 60° the influence of
heat upon a fork may be regarded as practically constant. Thick tun-
ing-forks are more affected by heat than thin ones of the same pitch,
showing that it is change in the elasticity rather than change in the
length of the arms which is the primary cause of the change of pitch.
On forks of different pitch and of not very different thickness, the effect
of heat is proportional to the number of vibrations. Generally the
period of vibration of a fork is increased or diminished 5,45 by a dif-
ference of temperature of 19°C. The general change in pitch of the
normal fork Ut; = 512 vibrations per second at 20°, through the varia-
tion of 1° C. in the temperature, is 0.0572 vibration per second. He has
constructed a fork which will give 512 vibrations at any temperature.—
(Nature, xxii, 90, 1880.)

Kayser has also investigated the influence of temperature upon the
pitch of tuning-forks. He used a method founded on the observation
of the alteration of the difference of phase between two forks as the
temperature varied, the forks being furnished with mirrors and the
Lissajous, curves observed with a telescope. He finds, (1) that the
vibration number of a tuning-fork between 0° and 30° is a linear fune-
tion of the temperature; (2) that the influence of temperature 1s greater
the higher the tone of the fork, and with forks similarly arranged the
variation of the vibration number is about proportional to the square
root of that number; (3) that with moderate variations of temperature,
such as occur in a room, the temperature affects the vibration number
in the second place of decimals; and (4) that the coefficient of elasticity
increases between 0° and 30° with the temperature.—(Ann. Phys. Chem.,
II, viii, 444, 1879; Nature, xxi, 243, 1880.)

Ellis has communicated to the Society of Arts an important paper
upon the “ History of Musical Pitch.” This he defines to be the pitch
of the tuning-note, or that by which all other notes on an instrument
with fixed tones are regulated according to some system of tuning or
temperament. It is convenient to consider A as the tuning-note in all
cases, though pianos and organs are usually tuned on C. In equal tem-
perament A 444 corresponds to © 528 vibrations. In mean-tone tem-
perament A 418 corresponds to C 500; whereas for a perfect minor third
between A and C, A 440 corresponds to C 528. Before 1711, the organ-
pipe was the only means of handing down pitch. Subsequently both
this and the tuning-fork were thus used. Both, however, alter with
temperature ; the former by one vibration in a thousand for each 1° F., —
sharpening by heat and flattening by cold. Hence all organ pitches —
must be reduced to a standard temperature, 59° I. or 15° C. being ©
recommended. The fork alters by one vibration in 21,000 for each 1° F.;
flattening by heat and sharpening by cold. The various pitches of

;

PHYSICS. 247

the different forks were tested by means of Scheibler’s tonometer, the
beats with the standard fork being carefully counted. Great variations
were observed, the lowest pitch for A being 374 vibrations at L’Hospice
Comtesse, Lille, and the highest 567 vibrations, the usual church
pitch in North Germany in 1619, called chamber pitch by Przetorious.—
(Nature, xxi, 550, 1880.)

Kayser, under Helnholtz’s direction, has made a series of experiments
to test the question whether the intensity of a sound has any influence
upon its velocity of propagation. He used a tube giving a continuous
note, each vibrating section of which passes through the same phase
after each semi-vibration. Hence two sections passing a determinate
phase at the same instant are distant from each other by a multiple of
half a wave length. To render visible the vibration of a gaseous section
of the tube, a small tongue was cut in a very thin plate of mica, which
was cemented by one of its extremities to a copper ring sliding within
the tube. This mica plate reproduced the phases of air vibration at the
point where it was placed. A sliding wire controlled the length of the
tongue so as to bring it into unison with the sound of the tube. View-
ing a luminous point on the tongue through a vibration microscope, a
Lissajous figure is formed by a combination of the two rectangular
vibrations. Very minute changes of phase in the tongue produce marked
changes in the figure. By displacing the mica along the tube until a
given figure is reproduced, the distance moved is obviously half a wave
length. If the mica tongue be fixed at the open extremity of the tube,
and a movable piston be made to clese the other one, the same figure is
observed on the lamina whenever the piston is displaced by half a wave
length. A constant sound was obtained in the tube by means of an
electrically vibrated fork in front of a resonator. By varying the
amplitude of oscillation, the intensity of the sound could be varied.
On comparison with a divided scale, the amplitude of the mica vibra-
tions was found to be proportional to the oscillations of the air column.
As a result, the author does not find any difference in the velocity of a
sound when its intensity is made to vary. Regnault’s results, being ob-
tained with waves of explosion very different in their character, do not
hold good for musical sounds.—(Ann. Phys. Chem., I, vi, 465, 1879.)

Jacques has experimented to ascertain the velocity of propagation of
very loud sounds produced by the firing of a six-pound brass field-piece
at the Watertown Arsenal, Massachusetts. A series of membranes was
erected at distances varying from 10 to 110 feet from the mouth of the
cannon, and in the rear of it. Each membrane consisted of a hoop 9
inches in diameter, over which a sheet of thinrubber was stretched. At
the center, on the side toward the cannon, a small brass shelf was
fastened, on which rested one end of a delicate steel spring, the other
end being held by a separate support. These metallic parts formed
portions of a continuous metallic circuit, including all the screens, and
terminating in the primary coil of an inductorium. The Schultz chrono-
248 PHYSICS.

graph consisted of a revolving cylinder of silver covered with lampblack,
connected with one terminal of the secondary coil. The other terminal
was a fine wire brought very near the surface of the cylinder. When by
the motion of the membranes the primary circuit was broken, a spark
passed to the cylinder and made a fine dot in the lampblack. By refer-
ence to a sinuous curve of times traced simultaneously on the cylinder
by an electrically vibrated fork, the time could be measured to .00001
second. When the air was quiet the gun was fired and the arrival of
the pulse at each successive membrane was recorded. By measuring
the distances the velocities are readily calculated. It was found that
immediately in the rear of the cannon the velocity was less than at a
distance, but that going farther and farther away from the cannon the

velocity o¢ sound rose to a maximum considerably above the ordinary |

velocity and then fell gradually to about the velocity usually received.
Hence the author concludes: 1st, that the velocity of sound is a function
of its intensity ; and 2d, that experiments upon the velocity of sound in
which acannon is used contain an error probably due to the bodily
motion of the air near the cannon. . For a correct determination of the
velocity of sound, therefore, he thinks that a musical sound of low in-
tensity must be used.—(Am. J. Sci., II, xvii, 116, February, 1879.)
Thlseng under the direction of Rood has measured the velocity of
sound in various kinds of wood. In his first experiments he used the
method of Kundt, vibrating a rod of the given wood, 1 to 2 meters long,
longitudinally, while one end of it, armed with a cork, entered the end
of a glass tube a meter in length, and containing a fine powder. To the
other end of the tube a piston was fitted so as to make the length used
a multiple of the half wave length in air. In this way rods of cedar,
white-wood, yellow and white pine, hickory, white ash, holly, mahogany,
black walnut, cherry, and white oak were experimented with. In a sec-
ond series of experiments a method was adopted by which the rod reg-
istered its own vibrations on a smoked-glass plate drawn rapidly across
the vibrating end of the rod ina horizontal direction by means of a
weight; while at the same time a tuning-fork registered the time. The
conclusions given are: Ist, it is possible to measure the velocity of sound
in rods with considerable accuracy by the graphic method ; 2d, Kundt’s
method gives results which are slightly higher than those by the graphic
method; and 3d, the graphic method demonstrates the existence of
transverse along with longitudinal vibration and gives their ratios.—
(Am. J. Sci., II, xvii, 125, February, 1879.)

Kohlrausch has given a method of studying the condition of the air
in a vibrating column, and of repeating the experiments of Savart and
Seebeck upon the position of the fixed nodes and loops produced by the
combination of the direct and the reflected sonorous waves. For this
purpose a caoutchoue membrane, stretched upon the extremity of an
‘open tube, is lowered into the organ-pipe which is sounding, by means
of a string passing through the cork closing the pipe. In this case the

membrane is in contact on both sides with the air in the pipe, and it
vibrates at the loops and ceases at the nodes. But if the second end
of the tube carrying the membrane be closed with a cork, the membrane
is now in contact only on one side with the air in the pipe, and it vibrates
strongly at the nodes and ceases to vibrate at the loops. Seebeck ex-
plained this by showing that one of the waves was obliged to go round
the tube to reach the membrane, and thus its velocity changed sign.
Bichat, in noticing this paper, gives the method he has used for show-
ing this result in class instruction. He uses the ordinary closed organ-
pipe with a glass side, made by Koenig. On urging the blast a sound
is obtained having a node at about one-third of its length from the
mouth and a loop at one-third from the closed end. A membrane of
gold-beater’s skin, attached to a rigid ring, is first passed through the
tube to show in the usual way that the sand placed upon it is disturbed
at the loops and not at the nodes. Then a small manometric capsule is
used in place of the membrane, having two small glass tubes passing
from its top through the cover of the pipe. Through one of these coal
gas enters, and at the outer end of the other it is burned. On examin-
ing this flame in a revolving mirror it will be seen to be in vibration
when the capsule is at the node, and at rest when at a loop.—(Ann. Phys.
Chem., I, viii, 384; J. Phys., ix, 102, 1880.)

Mayer has applied the principle of exploring the wave-surface in air
from a sounding body, which he devised some years ago, to the construc-
tion of a simple and efficient apparatus called a topophone, by which even
the unpracticed ear may determine accurately the direction of a distant
sound, even in foggy weather. It consists of a vertical rod passing
through the roof of the deck-cabin of a vessel, for example, approaching
the coast, bearing upon its upper end a horizontal bar carrying two adjust-
able resonators below which is a pointer set at right angles with the bar.
Rubber tubes from the resonators pass through the roof of the cabin and
unite in a single pipe connected with a pair of ear-tubes. The vertical
rod is turned in any direction by means of a handle. The resonators are
first accurately tuned to the sound under observation. They are then
fixed at a distance from each other somewhat less than the wave-length
for this sound, and brought by turning the handle simultaneously on the
wave-surface. As they now receive the sound-wave upon their mouths
at the same instant in the same phase, the ear will hear the sound re-en-
forced if the connecting tubes are of the same length, and diminished if
one is a half wave-length shorter than the other. When this is attained
the bar is a chord in the spherical wave-surface of which the sounding
body, say a fog-horn, is the center. Hence the pointer which is perpen-
dicular to this bar points out the bearing of the fog-horn with great
accuracy. By making a second observation at a known distance and
direction from the first, a second radius line is obtained, and the distance
of the fog-horn is computed.—( Nature, xxi, 385, February, 1880.)

Schellbach and Boehm have proposed a simple experiment for show-
250 PHYSICS.

ing the refraction of sound-waves. In an inverted bell-jar of glass is
placed a horizontal disk of smoke-blackened paper. A circular collo-
dion membrane is arranged above it, inclined 33° to the plane of the
edge of the bell. If now on the axis of this membrane, and at 13 centi-
meters distance, an electric spark be produced, the membrane vibrates
and the waves which it produces make a series of concentric circles upon
the paper, the center of which is on the axis of the membrane. If the
bell be filled with carbon dioxide the center of these circles is displaced
in the direction required by refraction and by a quantity corresponding
to the sonorous refractive index. Hydrogen gas may also be employed.
—(Ann. Phys. Chem., I, viii, 645, 1879.)

Rood, in studying the action of a revolving fan introduced inte melo-
deons for the purpose of producing a “ tremolo” effect, ascertained that
the variations in loudness produced by it were due to reflection or non-
reflection from the face of the revolving fan, and that the same effect
could be obtained from a disk consisting of closed and open sectors and
revolving in its own plane. With this simple apparatus the following
points were established: (1) At a perpendicular incidence the short
sound-waves are more copiously reflected than those that are longer, and
the regular reflection is more copious from large than from small sur-
faces. (2) When the sound-waves fall upon small flat surfaces at an
acute angle, the reflection is most copious in the same direction as with
light, but the reflected and inflected waves can be traced all around the
semicircle. (3) Qualitative comparisons between the power of different
substances to reflect sound can easily be made. (4) If a composite sound-
wave falls on the rotating disk, the shorter waves will undergo regular
reflection more copiously than the other components. (5) The reflection
of sound from very small surfaces is easily demonstrated.—(Am. J. Sci.,
III, xix, 133, February, 1880.)

Rhodes has devised a simple apparatus to aid the deaf in hearing,
called the audiphone. It consists of a thin flexible sheet of hard ebon-
ite rubber, provided with a handle like a palm-leaf fan, and with a cord
which can be tightened at pleasure to curve it into the form of a semi-
cylinder. The edge of the sheet is pressed against the upper set of
teeth, the convex surface being outwards, so that vibrations impinging
upon the sheet are transmitted through the teeth and bones of the skull
to the auditory nerve. Its use, therefore, is limited to cases where the
nerve is nearly or quite intact. Colladon has replaced the costly ebon-
ite by a sheet of fine elastic cardboard, about 18 inches by 10, and var-
nished at the edges, which is curved by being pressed against the teeth
by the hand. Experiments made with it upon deaf-mutes were highly
interesting. A professional musician, deaf for fourteen years, was en-
abled by this audiphone again to hear piano music. Fletcher, in further
experimenting, prefers birch-wood veneer cut to an oval 12 by 84 inches,
steamed and bent to a curve. It is held between the teeth. In his ex-
perience any audiphone is a failure in two-thirds of the cases of deafness
in which it is tried.—(Nature, xxi, 426, 469, 515, 1880.)

Sedley Taylor has given the name phoneidoscope to an apparatus for
studying the character of sound vibrations by causing them to act on
a liquid film thin enough to give color, such as a film of glyceric liquid.
Guebhard has proposed a modification of the method by which he has
obtained some very curious results. Beautiful interference rings are
produced by the condensation of the vapor of water upon the freshly
cleaned surface of a very impure mercury. When, for example, the
various vowel sounds are emitted above such a mercury surface, with a
pure tone maintained for some seconds, at a distance so small that the
vapor of water contained in the breath has not time to diffuse, a series
of figures are obtained which are characteristic. Figures are given of
the ten principal vowel sounds thus produced. The four nasal vowels
give more complex figures.—(J. Phys., ix, 242, July, 1880.)

Barlow has constructed an apparatus for recording the sounds of the
human voice, which he calls alogograph. It consists of a small trumpet-

‘shaped mouthpiece, the larger extremity of which widens to a diameter
of 7 centimeters. Over this end is fastened a thin caoutchoue mem-
brane. <A light arm of aluminum is fastened at one end to the frame,
and the other, which presses against the center of the membrane, with
which it is movable, carries a small brush containing color. A band of
paper, like that used in the telegraph, passes beneath, so that the point
of the brush just touches it, and traces a line upon it when the mem-
brane is at rest, which is a zero line. There is a small lateral opening
in the mouthpiece for the escape of the air. Various examples are given
of the results obtained in using the logograph for spoken language.— (J.
Phys., viii, 78, March, 1879.)

Dvorak has observed that light resonators of glass or metal are re-
pelled very decidedly when they are brought near to the resonance box
of a fork turned in unison with them. The condition essential to the
success of the experiment is that the air of the resonance box shall be
really in vibration. A metallic disk in unison with the resonator may
also be used as the vibrating body. The repulsion thus produced is so
strong that when a mill is constructed with four resonators at its ends
and placed before the resonance box of a large fork, the mill revolves.
Mayer independently discovered the same phenomenon.—(Phil. Mag.,
V, vi, 225, 1879.)

HEAT.
1. Thermometry and Change of State.

Benoit has described a new temperature-regulator based upon the
principle of the variation of the tension of a saturated vapor with the
temperature, first employed by Andres. The apparatus consists of a
small bulb, containing the volatile liquid, placed in the space whose
temperature is to be maintained constant. The end of the tube on
which this bulb is blown is connected with a gas-interrupter by means
of a rubber tube filled with mercury. This interrupter consists of a
252 PHYSICS.

glass tube over the lower end of which the rubber tube slips, within
which is a second glass tube conveying the gas, and which continues
down nearly to the mercury level. The gas enters by this tube, escapes
at its lower end, passes up between the two, and goes to the burner
through a lateral tube. Ifthe temperature rises too high the mercury
column cuts off the supply of gas by the increased tension of the vapor ;
a by-pass preventing complete extinction of the flame. The interrupter
is attached to a board which slides up and down along a graduated
seale, by means of which the pressure upon the volatile liquid can be
made to balance its tension at any temperature. Using methyl] alcohol,
for example, its tension at 10° C is 50™™, at 50° is 382™™, at 70° is 807%,
at 100° is 2405™™, So that with this liquid constant temperatures be.
tween these extremes may behad. For other temperatures other liquids
more or less volatile than methyl aleohol can be used in its stead.—
(J. Phys., viii, 346, October, 1879.)

Edison made use of his tasimeter for measuring the heat of the solar

corona at the eclipse of July, 1878. In an account subsequently pub- »

lished he gives figures of the instrument and describes the method of
using it. A carbon button is inclosed in a heavy metallic semi-conical
box. Upon this button rests a metallic plate holding the lower end of a
strip of vuleanite, the upper end of which is held by a screw which is
capable of nice adjustment. When radiant heat is allowed to fall on
the vuleanite strip, it expands and produces pressure on the carbon,
thus reducing its resistance and causing an increase in the strength of
any current which may be flowing through it at the time. Ordinarily
the tasimeter is made one side of a Wheatstone bridge. To balance it,
at Rawlins, a method of “fractional balancing” was devised, which con-
sisted of a rheostat formed of an iron wire, No. 24, 4 feet long, wound be-
tween two rows of pins on a board, used as a shunt around the galva-
nometer. When the pins of one row were all connected by a piece of cop-
per wire, the resistance of the shunt was so low that only a feeble current
passed through the galvanometer, and it was easy to balance it by ad-
justing the tasimeter. The copper wire was then taken off a single pin,
increasing the resistance of the shunt by =; ohm, and the spot of
light, deflected nearly off the scale, was again brought to zero. And so
on until the whole shunt was removed, and the whole current was used
on the galvanometer. Its sensitiveness was now adjusted by raising the
damping magnet until the top of the rod was reached. In this condi-
tion it easily indicated the heat of Arcturus focused on the vulcanite by
a 4-inch object-glass. But upon the corona the deflection was so violent
that the spot of light passed off the scale not to return.—(Am. J. Sci.,
III, xvii, 52, January, 1879.)

Ridout proposes to show the expansion of glass, as a class experiment,
very neatly, by bending a glass tube of small diameter and 18 inches
long into the form of a horseshoe, so that the free ends approach each
other within a millimeter. Springing these ends apart and introducing

,
PHYSICS. 253

a coin, it will be held there owing to the elasticity of the glass. On
warming now the outer surface of the glass it expands and the coin drops
out. LeConte, apropos of this, gives an equally striking method for
showing the same thing, first observed by Orme in 1740. A straight
glass tube, 50 or 60°" in length and one or two in diameter, is placed
transversely before the fire, supported horizontally near its two ends on
rods of hard wood of about the same diameter, carefully leveled. It
will now roll toward the fire. If the supporting rods be transferred in-
ward so as to support the tube near its middle, the tube will gradually
roll from the fire. In this case the expansion of the glass by the heat is
the moving cause, the falling of the side thus made convex producing
the motion.—(Phil. Mag., June, 1880; Nature, xxii, 157, 318, 1830.)

Villari has experimented to determine the law of the production of
heat by the electric spark in gases. He used a glass globe of about a
liter capacity, having two horizontal and two vertical tubulures. By the
former, the electrodes entered the globe; the upper vertical one carried
a stopcock, and the lower a tube plunged in a diluted glycerin, serving
as a thermometer. Care was taken to protect the globe from loss or
gain of heat. The results are given in three laws: Ist, the heat devel-
oped by the electric spark in gases is directly proportional to the quan-
tity of electricity which produces it; 2d, the quantity of heat developed
by the electric spark increases in the proportion of its length; 3d, the
heat and also the galvanometric deviations produced by the discharge
of a condenser are independent of its surface. The result was not af-
fected by the direction of the spark.—(J. Phys., ix, 5, January, 1830.)

Barrett has studied the phenomena presented by the Trevelyan rocker,
and has come to the conclusion that the theory which ascribes the mo-
tion to the rapid expansion and contraction of the metals in contact is
not the correct one. He believes this motion to be due to the action of
a polarized layer of gas between the hot and cold surfaces, like that ex-
isting between the hot and cold surfaces of the layer of vapor support-
ing a drop of liquid in the spheroidal state, termed by Stoney a “Crookes
layer.” —( Nature, xxi, 426, March, 1880.)

Carnelley, from certain of his experiments, concluded that in order to
convert a solid into a liquid, the pressure must be above a certain point,
which he calls the “critical pressure” of the substance, otherwise no
amount of heat will melt the substance ; just as in converting a gas into a
liquid the temperature must be below the critical temperature, or no
amount of pressure will liquefy the gas. As a deduction from his law, it
follows that, provided the pressure be below the critical pressure, solid
ice may be heated to temperatures far above its melting point, passing
then directly into the gaseous condition without previously liquefying.
He therefore tried the experiment, and he succeeded in obtaining “solid
ice at temperatures so high that it was impossible to touch it without
burning one’s self.” Not only so, but water has been frozen in a glass
vessel which was so hot that it could not be touched by the hand with-
254. PHYSICS.

out burning it. Ice has been maintained for some time at temperatures
far above the boiling point of water, and then it sublimed away with-
out previous melting. The pressure necessary was found to be anything
below 4.6™™ of mercury, the tension of aqueous vapor at 0° C. In the case
of mercuric chloride, these phenomena may readily be produced, since
the critical pressure for this substance is only 420™™. In commenting
on these results, LeConte has called attention to their agreement with
well-known tacts. Of course it is understood that it is the vessel which
is hot, not the ice; and that the temperature of the ice must be pre-
served at 0° by the rapid evaporation of it in the solid state. In this
sense, the phenomena are comparable to those of Boutigny on the
spheroidal state, and of Faraday on freezing mercury in a red-hot cru-
cible. Substances are known which sublime without melting. Such
bodies have their boiling points below their fusing points. By subject-
ing them to pressure, their boiling points may be raised above their
fusing points. Thus metallic arsenic, which sublimes without fusing at
180°, melts under pressure below a red heat. The rapid evaporation
prevents the body from reaching the fusing temperature. Conversely,
by diminishing the pressure its boiling point is lowered below that of
fusion. He gives a noteworthy quotation from Regnault, published in
1865: “It is evident that a volatile solid body may be always subjected
to. so slight a pressure that it will boil at a temperature inferior to
that at which it melts. Thus ice at the temperature of —1° C. possesses
an elastic force represented by 4.27"; in other words, it boils at a
temperature of —1° C. under a pressure of 4.277". Ice may therefore be
entirely volatilized by ebullition under this feeble pressure without
reaching its point of fusion, which is 0° C.”—(Nature, xxii, 434, 603, Sep-
tember, October, 1880.)

Thomson has communicated to the British Association a method for
determining the critical temperature for any liquid and its vapor with-
out mechanism. The pure liquid is placed in a glass tube about 60°™
long, about 3 or 4°%™ of the upper portion being occupied by the vapor.
The tube is then hermetically sealed and placed in a vertical position.
The upper part is then warmed until the surface of separation of liquid
and vapor sinks below 5°" from the top. Then warm the lower part
containing the liquid till the surface rises again to a convenient position.
Operate thus, keeping the surface of separation at as nearly as possible
a constant position of 3°" from the top of the tube until the surface of
separation disappears. The temperature of the tube at the place where
the surface of separation was seen immediately before disappearance is
the critical temperature.—(Nature, xxiii, 87, November, 1880.)

Von Burg has presented a paper to the Vienna Academy on the action
of safety-valves on boilers. He shows among other things that the
authoritative directions given in different countries as to the size of
safety-valves are not at all adequate, being based on erroneous concep-
tions. As to the cause of the small amount of the lifting of the valve
PHYSICS. 255

during escape of steam (seldom over $™™), a vibratory motion of this
valve was at first supposed by the author; but further study and experi-
ment led him to the hypothesis that the steam jets in lifting the valve
do not begin to move from its middle point but from the periphery of a
circle p out to the circumference of the valve of radius 7; so that the
pressure of steam on the under surface of the valve is composed of two
parts, of which the inner or aérostatic is produced Igy the solid steam
cylinder of radius p and the outer or weak aérodynamie part by the ex-
ternal hollow cylinder of r—p thickness of wall. The phases of develop-
ment of steam tension were also investigated.—( Nature, xxi, 189, Decem-
ber, 1879.)

Aitken has propounded the rather remarkable theory that dust is the
germ of which fogs and clouds are the developed phenomena. Steam
was mixed with air in two large glass receivers, one of which contained
filtered the other unfiltered air. In the former the steam condensed in
its well-known cloudy form, while in the filtered air no cloudiness what-
ever appeared. From these and similar experiments the author con-
cludes: 1st, that whenever water vapor condenses in the atmosphere it
always does so on some solid nucleus ; 2d, that dust-particles in the air
form the nuclei on which the vapor condenses; 3d, that if there was no
dust there would be no fogs, no clouds, no mists, and probably no rain,
and that the supersaturated air would convert every object on the surface
of the earth into a condenser on which it would deposit; and 4th, that
our breath when it becomes visible on a cold morning, and every puff of
steam as it escapes into the air, show the impure and dusty condition

_of ouratmosphere. The importance of these results, meteorologically, is
very great.—( Nature, xxiii, 195, December, 1880.)

2. Conduction and Radiation.

Weber has made a series of experiments upon the conductibility of
liquids for heat, resting in principle upon Fourier’s theory. Sup-
pose a thin liquid layer bounded by two parallel metallic plates, the
whole possessing a uniform temperature. At a given instant the lower
plate is cooled to 0° and the whole system is inclosed in a space at 0°.
By determining the law of the variation of the temperature at the
center of the upper plate, the coefficient of conduction may be calcu-
lated. The experiment was made as follows: Upon a plate of copper
0.05" in thickness, three small slips of glass 2 to 3™™ thick were placed

to support the second plate of copper. This plate was perforated at
center by a small hole through which the liquid was introduced until it
formed a slightly convex meniscus at the edges of the plates, care being
taken to leave no bubble of air. When the whole had acquired the tem-
perature of the laboratory one of the junctions of a thermo-electric couple
was put in contact with the center of the upper plate, the other remain-
ing in the melting ice. An aperiodic oscillation galvanometer in the
circuit gave, by a simple reading, the electromotive force, and so

the. temperature of the upper plate. By the help of a pulley and cord,
the two plates thus prepared were placed on a thick and flat plate
of ice and immediately covered with a double cylinder filled with ice.
The lower plate takes at once the temperature of the iceand remains so;
in one or two minutes the circuit of the galvanometer is closed and the
position of the needle read every 20 seconds. The value of k, in absolute
C. G. S. units, wes found for carbon disulphide, 0.0250; for benzene,
0.0200; for water, 0.0745; copper sulphate, 0.0710; for zine sulphate,
0.0691 to 0.0711; salt, 0.0692 ; alcohol, 0.0292 ; ether, 0.0243 ; chloroform,
0.0220; oillemon, 0.0210; olive oil, 0.0235; glycerin, 0.0402. These results
in general agree with those obtained by Lundquist.—(J. Phys., ix, 169,
May, 1880.)

Crova has proposed a purely optical method for measuring high tem-
peratures, founded upon the principle that two incandescent bodies,
having the same radiating power, are at the same temperature when
the spectra which they give are identical in extent. The instrument
which he has devised for these measurements he calls a spectropyrom-
eter. It is composed of a direct-vision spectroscope, having a slit in
the eye-piece to limit the field, and having the observing telescope moy-
able about an axis perpendicular to the length of the spectrum, its play
being limited to wave-length 676, and on the other side to wave-length 523.
Over half the slit is a total-reflection prism, and in front of the slit is a
Nicol prism in the center of a graduated circle, a second Nicol being"
placed either between this and the lamp, or preferably just behind the
slit of the collimator. To measure the temperature of a body in optical
degrees the telescope is first directed to the fixed point in the red, the two
Nicols are put at 0°, and the intensities of the two spectra made equal,
either by moving the moderator-lamp used asthe standard farther off, or
by rotating a Nicol placed between the body and the reflecting prism.
The telescope is then moved to wave-length 525 in the green, and two
green images are obtained of unequal intensities. If the temperature of
the body is less than that of the lamp (below 2000° C.) the greens are
made equal by rotating the Nicol. If a be the angle of rotation the in-
tensity is equal to 1000 cos 2a if the temperature of the lamp is 1000 optical
degrees. ‘To calibrate the instrument, the temperature of the lamp flame
was compared with that of an air-thermometer with a porcelain bulb
heated in a furnace until the spectra of the two were identical throughout.
In this way Crova finds in optical degrees the following values for the
sources examined: Platinum strip heated to redness in a gas flame, 524;
the same heated to a white heat in a gas blow-pipe flame, 810; moderator-
lamp fed with colza oil, 1000; stearin candle, 1162; illuminating gas (Ar-
gand burner), 1373; oxyhydrogen light (oxygen and coal gas on lime),
1806; electric light (60 Bunsen cells), 3060; solar light, 4049. The author
hopes to compare in this way the intensities of the simple radiations of
incandescent vapors, provided that the spectrum consists of more than
a single line.—(Ann. Chim. Phys., V, xix, 472, April, 1880.)
PHYSICS. 257

Mouton, in an elaborate memoir, has given the results of his experi-
ments to determine the wave-length of dark heat rays by a method
depending on the position of interference bands in polarized light. In
the formula the wave-length appears as a function of the thickness of
the interfering film, of the difference of the indices for the two rays of
this wave length, and of the number of wave-lengths concerned. By
the measurement of these values the wave-length was easily calculated.
The result obtained is noteworthy, since it gives us a wave-length
actually measured of 0.002140™™, or 2.14. If this be compared
with the wave-length of the ultra-violet line R, measured by Mas-
cart, 0.00031775, it will be seen that the wave-length of this ultra-red
line is more than six and a half times greater. The entire ether gamut
known is more than two and a quarter octaves, while the total chemical
and luminous radiation covers scarcely a single one.—(Ann. Chim. Phys.,
V, xviii, 145, 1879; J. Phys., viii, 393, December, 1879; ix, 113, April,
1880.)

Rosetti has given a series of measurements upon the temperature of
the voltaic arc, using a method which consists in receiving upon the
face of a thermopile placed at a convenient distance, rays emitted from
a surface of known area, and measuring the thermic effect on a sensitive
galvanometer. The following are his conclusions: 1st. The carbon pos-
itive pole from the moment of the production of the electric light has
always a higher temperature than the negative. 2d. These tempera-
tures vary according to the variation in the strength of the current.
3d. They are as much higher as the radiating surface is smaller, pro-
vided, obviously, that the end of the point be included. 4th. For the
negative pole the minimum temperature was found to be 1910°C., the
radiating surface being large and not very brilliant in some places. The
maximum temperature observed was 2552°C., the radiating surface being
one-half the preceding. 5th. For the positive pole the minimum temper-
ature found was 2312° C., the carbon being very large and the radiating
surface extended. For the maximum temperature, 5200° C., where the
carbon was thin and the radiating surface nearly one-fourth of that cor-
responding to the minimum temperature. 6th. The extreme point of
the negative carbon may be considered at 2500° C. at least; that of the
positive carbon not less than 3200°.—(Ann. Chim. Phys., V, xviii, 457,
December, 1879; J. Phys., viii, 257, August, 1879.)

Rosettihas published also anextended memoir on the temperature of the
sun, giving the experimental methods employed and the results obtained.
For the purpose of determining the law of radiation as a function of the
temperature, the thermopile, which was connected with a Wiedemann re-
flection galvanometer, received the heat radiated from a Leslie cube, con-
taining water for the lower and mercury for the higher temperatures,
up to 300°C. Accurate thermometers gave the temperatures of the air
outside and of the liquid inside the cube. From the data thus obtained
an empirical formula was derived, which the author thinks represents

the facts better than that of Dulong and Petit. From this, results were
calculated for temperatures beyond 300° and up to 2000°, which agreed
well with those derived from experiment. The apparatus was then ap-
plied to the determination of the solar temperature. The thermopile
was placed where the direct rays of the sun could fall normally upon its
face. Four readings of the galvanometer were made during each obser-
vation: the first with open circuit to fix the zero point; the second, with
closed circuit, the case of the pile being closed; the third, after opening
the case to allow the heat rays to act; the fourth, with the case open and
the solar rays intercepted by a double-walled screen placed one meter off.
This last reading was generally negative, the pile radiating heat into
space. Calculated from these results it appeared that the thermic effect
which would be produced by the solar radiation falling normally on the
face of the pile, if the atmosphere did not exist, or if the pile were above
it, is represented by 323 scale divisions. Since resistance was used in the
circuit in the last experiments, this value must be multiplied by 5.6921
to make it comparable to the others; this gives 1838.5 divisions. Calling
the effective temperature of the sun, that which an incandescent body
of the same size placed at the same distance should have to produce the
same effect, its emissive power being at the maximum, the formula gives
as the absolute effective temperature of the sun 10238°.4, or in degrees
centigrade, 9965.4. The author concludes that if the absorption of our
atmosphere only be taken into the account, the true temperature of the sun
cannot be far inferior to ten thousand degrees. If the absorption pro-
duced by the solar atmosphere be also considered, and Secchi’s estimate
of .88 be allowed for it, then this temperature is higher but not very far
superior to twenty thousand degrees.—(Ann. Chim. Phys., V, xvi, 177,
June, 1879.)

Langley has compared the intensity of the solar-heat radiation with
that of the incandescent surface of Bessemer steel in fusion as it flows
from the converter. The temperature of this molten metal is above that
at which platinum melts, a wire of this metal fusing in the gas stream
issuing from the mouth of the converting vessel; hence it is from 1800°
to 2000° C. The heat radiated from the liquid stream fell on one face of
a thermopile, while a bundle of solar rays was reflected on to the other
face. Though the apparant diameter of the opening of the converter
was many times that of the sun, so much greater was the energy of the
latter that a lens was interposed to form a magnified image of the sun
on the pile, and it was diaphragmed to bring the needle to zero. Caleu-
lating for equal diameters, the solar energy was found to be 86 times that
of the molten metal at least. Photometric comparison showed the solar-
light radiation to be 5,500 times that of the metal. Crova, in noting
these experiments, calls attention to the rapid increase of light emitted
by melted silver as the temperature rises, being 147 times greater at
1200° than at 916°, and hence 28,900 times at 1500°, as evidence that the
sun’s temperature is quite moderate compared with some of the calcu-
lations made on the subject.—(J. Phys., ix, 59, February, 1880.)

PHYSICS. 259

Crookes has made remarkable progress in studying the phenomena
of molecular physics in high vacua, and has obtained results even more
novel and striking than those connected with his marvelous little in-
strument, the radiometer. In a paper read to the Royal Society Decem-
ber 5, 1878, he showed that the dark space which surrounds the negative
pole in an ordinary vacuum tube illuminated by an induction coil, is the
result of intense molecular vibration which excites a molecular disturb-
ance in the surface of the disk and the surrounding gas. As the rare.
faction increases, this layer of molecular disturbance increases in thick-
ness. Ata pressure of 0.078™™, it extends for 8™™ from the disk. It
is greatest in hydrogen and least in carbon dioxide. Numerous ex-
periments were devised to ascertain whether this visible layer of molee-
ular disturbance was identical with the invisible layer of molecular
pressure. A radiometer with aluminum disks, each coated with mica,
when made the negative electrode, revolved rapidly as soon as the dark
space is made by exhaustion to extend to the glass. Witha cup-shaped
aluminum electrode, the convergence of the lines of force to a focus was
very marked. When the exhaustion becomes very high the dark space
fills the tube, and where the rays after divergence fall on the glass, a
Sharply-defined spot of greenish-yellow light appears. This greenish-
yellow phosphorescence of molecular impact is due to the particular
kind of glass used. Other kinds of glass give different colors. At 4 M
exhaustion (M refers to millionths of an atmosphere) no other light than
this is seen. At 0.9 M the phosphorescence reaches it maximum. At
0.15 M the spark passes with difficulty and the light appears in flashes.
At 0.06 M the vacuum is non-conducting, and only very intense sparks
will pass. Beyond this nothing has been observed. The rays producing
the green phosphorescence will not turn a corner. Hence a body in
their path intercepts them and casts, as it were, a shadow on the glass
behind it.

Mr. Crookes advances the theory, therefore, that the induction spark
actually illuminates the lines of molecular pressure caused by the elec-
trical excitement of the negative pole. The thickness of the dark space
is the measure of the mean length of the path between successive col-
lisions of the molecules. The extra velocity with which the molecules
rebound from the excited negative pole keeps back the more slowly
moving molecules which are advancing toward that pole. The con-
flict occurs at the boundary of the dark space, where the luminous
margin bears witness to the energy of the collisions. By using a rotat-
ing fly it may be caused to revolve with high velocity by directing the
molecular impact on one side of it. Moreover, these lines of molecular
force are markedly deflected by a magnet, the action being to twist the
trajectory of the molecules, the direction of twist when an electro-mag-
net is used being that of the electric current round the magnet. When
the magnet is so adjusted as to exert a uniform downward pull on the
molecules, the trajectory is much curved at low exhaustions, and gets

—
4

flatter as the rarefication increases, exhibiting a close parallelism with
the phenomena of projectiles. Moreover, great heat is produced by the
impact of these molecules. A large hemispherical cup of aluminum
used as the negative pole gives a focus in which platinum may be melted.
The conditions in these high vacua are special. The free path of the
molecules is so long that the average molecule is allowed to obey its
- own motions or laws without, interference; so that if this path is com-
parable to the dimensions of the vessel, the properties which constitute
gaseity are reduced to a minimum, and the matter becomes exalted to
an ultra gaseous state. The phenomena in these tubes reveal a new
world, a world where matter exists in a fourth state, where the corpus-
cular theory of light holds good, and where light does not always move
in a straight line.

In a lecture on radiant matter, delivered at the Sheffield meeting —
of the British Association, August 22, 1879, Crookes discussed and
elegantly illustrated the principles given in the paper above quoted.
His vacua are thus graphically described: ‘‘According to the best au-
thorities a bulb of the size of the one before you (13.5°" in diameter)
contains more than 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (a quadrillion) of
molecules. Now, when exhausted to the millionth of an atmosphere,
we shall still have a trillion molecules left in the bulb, a number quite
sufficient to justify me in speaking of the residue as matter. To suggest
some idea of this vast number, I take the exhausted bulb and perfor-
ate it by a spark from the induction coil. The spark produces a hole
of microscopical fineness, yet sufficient to allow molecules to penetrate
and to destroy the vacuum. The inrush of air impinges against the
vanes and sets them rotating after the manner of a wind-mill. Let us
suppose the molecules to be of such a size that at every second of time
a hundred millions could enter. How long, think you, would it take
for this small vessel to get full of air? An hour, a day, a year, a century?
Nay, almost an eternity! A time so enormous that imagination itself
cannot grasp the reality. Supposing this exhausted glass bulb, indued
with indestructibility, had been pierced at the birth of the solar system;
supposing it to have been present when the earth was without form and
void; supposing it to have borne witness to all the stupendous changes
evolved during the full cycles of geologic time—to have seen the first
living creature appear, and the last man disappear; supposing it to sur-
vive until,the fulfillment of the mathematician’s prediction that the sun,
the source of energy, four million centuries from its formation, will
ultimately become a burnt-out cinder; supposing all this—at the rate of
filling I have just described (100 million molecules a second) this little
bulb even then would scarcely have admitted its full quadrillion of
molecules. But what will you say if I tell you that all these molecules,
this quadrillion of molecules, will enter through the microscopic hole
before you leave this room? The hole being unaltered in size, the
number of molecules undiminished, this apparent paradox can only be
PHYSICS. 261

explained by again supposing the size of the molecules to be diminished
almost infinitely, so that instead of entering at the rate of 100 millions
every second they troop in at the rate of something like 500 trillions a
second. I have done the sum, but figures, when they mount so high,
cease to have any meaning, and such calculations are as futile as trying
to count the drops in the ocean.”—(Proc. Roy. Soe., December 5, 1878;
Phil. Mag., January, 1879; Am. J. Scei., 111; xvii, 218, March, 1879; xviii,
241, October, 1879; Nature, xx, 228, 250, 419, 436, 1879.)

In asubsequent communication to the Royal Society, Crookes says that
he has examined some of these phenomena more closely, and has con-
firmed the molecular-stream hypothesis. If, however, the residual mole-
cules, being negatively charged by contact with the negative pole, and so
repelled, were solely acted on by the initial impulse from the negative
pole, they would take a direction accurately normal to the surface re-
pelling them, and would start with their full velocity. But the mole-
cules, being all negatively electrified, exert mutual repulsion, and there-
fore diverge laterally. The negative pole, likewise, not only gives an
initial impulse to the molecules, but it also continues to act on them
by repulsion, the result being that they move with an accelerating ve-
locity the further they get from the pole. Within the dark space at a
moderate exhaustion, the velocity does not accumulate to a sufficient
extent to produce phosphorescence; but at higher exhaustions the
mean free path is long enough to allow the molecules to get up speed
sufficient to cause phosphorescence. The luminous boundary to the
dark space around the negative pole is probably due to the impact of
molecule against molecule, producing phosphorescence of the gas in the
same way as the impact of molecules against German glass produces
phosphorescence of the glass. The effect of deadening produced on
glass by long-continued phosphorescence, which was illustrated by
stenciling, by means of a discharge from the negative pole, the image
of a maltese cross on the end of a large pear-shaped bulb, has been
further developed by opening the bulb and heating the wide end in the
blowpipe flame until soft and melted out of shape. It was then blown
out again into its original shape and re-exhausted; on connecting it
with the coil, the original ghost of the cross was seen to be still there.
At Maxwell’s suggestion a third, idle, electrode was introduced into a
tube. On connecting it with an electroscope, it appeared that when in
a direct line between the positive and negative poles, and receiving the
full impact of the molecules driven from the negative pole, it had a
strong positive charge. The effect of magnetism on the discharge has
been further examined, and this was found to be so sensitive that when
the tube was placed parallel to the earth’s equator, the earth’s magnet-
ism was sufficient to cause the spot of light to move five millimeters
away from the position it occupied when the tube was parallel to the
dipping needle. Complete and. orderly rotation of the molecular rays
was obtained by placing an electro-magnet beneath the tube in a line

“|

with the terminals. With reference to the heating effect of molecular —
bombardment, a plate of German glass was held in the focus and soon
became red hot. Gas then appeared in the tube, which gave the hydro-
gen spectrum. This was pumped out and the experiment repeated.
The glass could be heated to dull redness without evolution of gas, but
when the heat approached the fusing point, the lines appeared. This
hydrogen the author thinks comes from vapor of water which is obsti-
nately held in the superficial pores, and which is not entirely driven off
by anything short of actual fusion of the glass. From an experiment
in which a hole in a mica disk was placed in front of a negative elec-
trode of platinum, and the tube opposite the hole was not more darkened
than the surrounding portions, Crookes infers that the molecular stream —
does not consist of particles of the negative pole shot off from it. With
regard to the production of phosphorescence by impact in crystals, the
conclusion is arrived at that the rays whose direction of vibration cor-
responds to the direction of maximum optical elasticity in the crystal
are always originated where any light is given out.—(Nature, xxii, 101,
125, June, 1880.)

More recently, Crookes has written a letter to the secretary of the
Royal Society, in answer to a challenge from De la Rue, defining his
position in reference to the ultra-gaseous or fourth state of matter.
This letter concludes thus: “The molecule—intangible, invisible, and
hard to be conceived—is the only true matter, and that which we call
matter is nothing more than the effect upon our senses of the move-
ments of molecules, or, as John Stuart Mill expresses it, ‘a permanent ©
possibility of sensation.” The space covered by the motion of molecules
has no more right to be called matter than the air traversed by a rifle
bullet can be called lead. From this point of view, then, matter is but
a mode of motion; at the absolute zero of temperature the inter-molec-
ular movement would stop, and although something retaining the prop-
erties of inertia and weight would remain, matter, as we know it, would
cease to exist..—(Proc. Roy. Soc., June, 1880; Nature, xxii, 153, J une,
1880.)

Marangoni has studied the diathermanous power of liquid films, using
for this purpose soapy water. A series of equidistant films 8 or 10 in
number was produced in a wide glass tube, and heat rays from a smoked
plate at 400° were reflected through the tube by a mirror, a second
mirror at the other end directing them on the face of the thermopile.
He found, (1) that the first film absorbs more than half the heat, re-
ducing the deflections from 38 to 18 divisions; (2) the successive films
produce decrements as theory indicates; (3) the diminution of intensity
depends very little on reflection, but almost wholly on absorption; (4)
the thinner the film the more diathermanous it becomes; (5) the dia-
thermaneity is not sensibly affected by mixing various salts with the
solution of soap.—( Nature, xxi, 620, April, 1880.)

Lecher has made further experiments on the absorbing action of car-
PHYSICS. 263

bon dioxide for radiant heat, with especial reference to the effect of this
gas in the atmosphere. Using a gas flame and a glass cylinder,
he found that a layer of the gas 214™™" thick allowed 94.8 per cent.
of the radiation to pass; 536™ allowed 93.8 per cent.; and 917™™ 89
per cent. The sun’s rays were proved to undergo considerable weak-
ening in their passage through carbon dioxide; a layer of the gas one
meter thick absorbing 13 per cent. when the sun’s altitude was 599,
diminishing as the sun got lower. The absorption of solar radiation
by carbon dioxide is selective therefore, the absorbable wave-lengths
becoming rarer as the thickness of the atmosphere already traversed
increases. From his experiments, Lecher calculates the proportion of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to be 3.27 parts in 10,000 by volume.
The agreement of this value with that obtained by direct chemical
methods suggests that absorption is a good method for its rapid deter-
mination in the air.—(Nature, xxiii, 209, December, 1830.)

3. Specific heat.

Mile. Stamo has published as an inaugural dissertation at Zurich
some researches upon the specific heat of water. In the first set of experi-
ments a brass calorimeter was used, filled to within one centimeter of
the top with copper turnings loosely packed. Into this the water,
heated gradually in a copper vessel placed in an oil bath, was poured.
The high conducting power of the copper turnings rendered it unneces-
sary to agitate the liquid. The author having determined in advance,
as exactly as possible, the specific heat of copper as compared with
water at ordinary temperatures, the comparison could easily be made
with the water heated to 60° or 80°. The mean of the coefficient of va-
riation of the specific heat of water is 0.0012559. In the second set
of experiments, the same electric current was passed through wires of
platinum, or of German silver, about 3™™ long, rolled on rubber frames
and immersed in calorimeters full of water, one being surrounded
with ice, and the other with water at a constant’ temperature ¢. From
the heating observed, the specific heats at 0° and at ¢° were calculated.
In this way the variation coefficient was found to be 0.000859, a value
of the same order as inthe first case.—(J. Phys., ix, 138, April, 1880.)

Witz has examined the cooling power of air at high pressures with a
view to verify the exactitude of the law of Dulong and Petit, according
to which the heat removed at each instant from a body by any gas sur-
rounding it depends only upon the excess of temperature of the body
- above the surrounding medium, and upon the pressure of the gas. The
apparatus consisted of a cast-iron cylinder of 13 liters capacity, strong
enough to sustain a pressure of 10 atmospheres, lampblacked on its in-
terior. Within this was placed a cylindrical cup of thin iron, 54"™ long
and 27™™ in diameter, surmounted by a tube 8™™ diameter, by which it
is adjusted to the center of the large cylinder. The cup holds 200 grams
of mercury, and the stem of a thermometer is plunged into it. The
264 PHYSICS.

volume of the outer cylinder is 400 times that of the inner. In making
an experiment the 200 grams of mercury, weighed with care, is heated
in an iron vessel, aud poured into the central cup. The thermometer is
at once immersed in it, and its temperature noted by means of a tele-
scope a meter distant. The time of passage of the column from five
to five, or from ten to ten divisions is noted on a chronograph. The
pressures experimented with were from 760 to 6,400™"; and the general
result obtained was that the law of Dulong and Petit ceased to be ap-
plicable at about 1,520™™, the pressure exponent passing from 0.45 to
0.65; though at 3,040™™ it was 0.54, and at 6,080™™, 0.44. Studying the
phenomena more carefully between 800 and 2,000™", Witz found that
Dulong’s law represented the facts from 800 to 1,200™"; and that from
1,200 to 1,600™™ there was a very rapid change, the exponent rising to
0.85, the curve of velocities presenting a point of inflection near this
pressure. This the author shows in a graphic curve.—(Ann. Chim. Phys.,
V, xviii, 208, October, 1879.)
LIGHT.

1. Reflection and Refraction.

Schwendler has proposed a new light-unit founded upon the ignition
of a strip of platinum, as originally suggested in 1844 by Draper and in
1859 by Zollner, and put into practical use for electrical illumination by
Farmer also in 1859. This unitof luminous intensity is given by a cur-
rent of 6.15 webers passing through a platinum strip 2™™ wide, 36.28™™
long, and 0.017™™ thick, weighing 0.0264 gram, having a calculated re-

sistance of 0.109 mercury-unit, and an actual resistance (including that

at the two contacts) of 0.145 mercury-unit at the temperature of 66° F.
This strip should be of pure metal, cut into the U-form, and connected
by large conductors with eight Grove cells of low resistance. The cur-
rent is maintained constant by means of a mercury rheostat, in the form
of a U-shaped groove, a millimeter in cross-section and a meter long,
eut in a board and filled with mercury. A copper bridge movable along
this groove enables the current to be kept constant, as indicated on a gal-
vanometer. The P. L. 8. (platinum light standard) is equal to nearly
0.7 standard candle. The economy of this light in comparison with that
of the voltaic are is over 70 times in favor of the are.—(Phil. Mag., V,
vill, 392, November, 1879; J. Phys., ix, 135, April, 1880.)

Eder has suggested a chemical photometer. The solutions are pre-
pared by dissolving separately, each in one liter of water, 40 grams of
ammonium oxalate and 50 grams of mercuric chloride (corrosive sub-
limate). When used, two voiumes of the former solution are mixed
with one volume of the latter, and exposed to the light. The liquid be-
comes turbid, and a black precipitate is thrown down. The weight of
this precipitate per square centimeter of surface exposed to the light
gives the measure of its intensity.—(Ber. Ak. Wien, 1879, 240; J. Phys.,
ix, 110, March, 1880.)

PHYSICS. 265

Gouy has investigated the photometry of colored flames, and has de-
vised a spectroscope by which various sources of light of different colors
may be compared with others, the comparison being made in parts of
their spectra having the same tints. The spectroscope is an ordinary
two-prism instrument, the collimator having its objective half covered
with a plate of plane glass so inclined that the light from a second colli-
mator falling on its face is reflected into the prisms. The eye, therefore,
sees in the observing telescope two spectra in exact coincidence, one
coming from each of the two collimators. One of these comes from a
gas flame, and is continuous; the other is a bright line spectrum com-
ing from an incandescent vapor. By means of two Nicol prisms the
intensity .of the’ former may be regulated. The angle between these
prisms measures the illuminating power. The author shows that for
wide bands, and for continuous spectra, their transparence is complete.
For narrow lines, it appears not to be true; that for each simple ray the
emissive and the absorptive power depend only on the quantity of vapor
contained in a right cylinder having a unit base, and for its height the
thickness of the layer; that two layers of vapor at the same temperature,
which give the same brilliance to a given line, have identically the same
vapor quantity and are optically alike; and that the widening of lines
is a necessary consequence of the fact that the radiation of the vapor is
a continuous function of the wave-length, which does not disappear be-
yond the lines, but forms a background of continuous spectrum, which
is never wanting when the illumination is sufficiently brilhant.—(Ann.
Chim. Phys., V, xviii, 5, September, 1879; J. Phys., ix, 19, January, 1880.)

Michelson read at the Saratoga meeting of the American Association
a paper describing his experimental determination of the velocity of light.
The method which he empioyed was Foucault’s, with a revolving mirror,
but in which some modifications were introduced. The chief of these
was the replacement of Foucault’s spherical mirror by a plane mirror,
thus enabling the distance between this mirror and the revolving mirror
to be increased indefinitely. Tio make the displacement of the returned
image as great as possible, the distance from the slit to the revolving
mirror and the speed of rotation should also be increased. But increas-
ing the first distance diminishes the second, from the laws of conjugate
foci. This difficulty was overcome by using a lens of 150 feet focus, and
by placing the revolving mirror 15 feet within the principal focus of the
lens. In the experiments the distance between the two mirrors was
nearly 2,000 feet, and the distance from the slit to the revolving mirror
was about 30 feet, the speed of the rotating mirror being about 207 rev-
olutions per second. The deflection obtained exceeded 135™™, being
about 200 times that obtained by Foucault. This deflection was meas-
ured to within three or four hundredths of a millimeter, and the result
therefore may be regarded as correct within one ten-thousandth part.
The mirror was rotated by an air turbine on the same axle, the pressure
of air being kept constant by means of a water-gauge. An electrically
266 PHYSICS.

vibrated tuning-fork was used to regulate and measure the speed, the
light from the revolving mirror being reflected from a steel mirror on

one of the prongs to a piece of plane glass in front of the eye-piece, and _

thence to the eye. When the mirror makes as many turns as the fork
makes vibrations, or when these are in simple ratio to each other, the
two images become stationary. The electric fork made 128 vibrations,
and was compared at each set of observations with a standard Ut; fork
making 256.072 vibrations at 65° F. The deflection was measured with
an accurate micrometer. The results are given in 100 readings, each of
which is the mean of ten separate observations. The mean value cor-
rected for temperature, for the velocity of light in air is 299,864 kilome-
ters per second. Adding 80 kilometers to reduce it to vacuo, this value
becomes 299,944 kilometers, with a probable error of +51 kilometers.—
This gives 186,380 miles per second reduced to English measure.—(Am.
J. Sci., II, xvii, 390, November, 1879.)

Ayrton has given a lecture at the Royal Institution upon magic mir-
rors, the effects of which, as it appears, so far from being intended, were
quite unknown to the Japanese, though known to the Chinese from the
earliest times. On reflecting a divergent beam of light from such a
mirror, Ayrton found that the pattern on the back appeared bright on
a dark ground; with a parallel beam no pattern could be seen; while
with a convergent beam the pattern was dark on a tight ground. Hence,
the effect must be caused by inequalities in the curvature of the reflect-
ing surface corresponding to the raised pattern on the back, the portions
where the relief increases the thickness of the plate being flatter than
the remaining convex surface, and sometimes actually concave. The
result is very exceptional, being shown well in only 2 or 3 per cent. of
the mirrors made. It is produced when the bronze casting is worked
sufficiently thin to determine a buckling of the metal.—( Nature, xix, 186,

539, December, 1878; April, 1879.)

Govi nreaunted to the Turin Academy in 1864 a valuable historical
paper upon the magic mirrors of the Chinese, called by them Theon-
kouang-kim, or mirrors which the light can penetrate. In this he shows
that if the mirror be heated from behind the thin portions heat most
rapidly, become more convex, and the magic effect is made more marked.
Bertin, associating himself with ‘Duboseq, sought to improve upon this
suggestion of Govi’s, by varying the curvature by pressure. <A frame
was constructed for holding the mirror so that air could be forced in
behind it to make its surface more convex, or exhausted to make it con-
cave. A mirror in nickel-plated brass, on the back of which figures
were engraved and relief ornaments soldered, became very magic by
pressure, giving simultaneously a dark image of the depressed designs
and light images of those in relief.—(Ann. Chim. Phys., V. xx, 99, 110,
143, May, 1880; J. Phys., ix, 401, December, 1880.)

Bibart has shown that although the images produced in the kaleid-
oscope are sharp when looked at directly, whatever be the angle between

|
| PHYSICS. 267

the mirrors, this is true of projected images only when the angle between
the mirrors is an even submultiple of the circumference. For this projee-
tion the light should be concentrated upon the object, say a small hole
_ ina blackened screen. Behind this screen are the blackened mirrors,
one horizontal, and behind these a lens for producing the image on the
sereen. If the inclination of the second mirror be varied, the number
of the images increases by doubling one of them.—(J.Phys., ix, 11. Jan-
uary, 1880.)

| Bleekrode has measured the indices of refraction of cyanogen, carbon
dioxide, and ammonia, liquefied in a Faraday tube having parallel sides
at one end. He used the method of determining the index by the dis-
placement of an object seen with a microscopic objective when the space
at first empty is filled with the liquefied gas. The index of cyanogen,
at 13°, for the sodium line, was found to be 1.320; of carbon dioxide at
19°, 1.163; of ammouia at 17°.5, in sunlight, 1.314. The index of zine-
ethyl was obtained as 1.489. The above value for CO, is very near that
obtained by Brewster in 1826, for a liquid contained in a cavity in Bra-
zilian topaz, undoubtedly liquid CO,—(Ann. Phys. Chem., U, viii, 400,
1879; J. Phys., ix, 141, April, 1880.)

Bertin has described an inverting prism devised by Duboseq for use
with the lantern, in cases where the object cannot itself be inverted. It
consists of a right-angled isosceles prism whose hypothenuse is placed
parallel to the axis of a convergent beam of light, its center coinciding
with the focal point. Under these circumstances the beam is totally
reflected from the base of the prism and inverted. In practice, two of
these prisms are placed in the beam from the lantern, with their bases
together. The use of a prism for this purpose is not new; it is figured
in Brewster’s Optics (London, 1853, p. 454,) where it is described for the
same purpose. More recently (J. Fr. Inst., xiii, 375, 1872) Zentmayer
has constructed an inverting prism for the microscope, which he has
also used for the lantern, and which would seem to be more effective so
far as amount of light is concerned than the Duboseq arrangement.—
(J. Phys., vill, 336, October, 1879.)

Gariel has proposed some ingenious mechanical models for illustrat-
ing the relations of the foci of lenses. Two rods are articulated on a
line perpendicular to the axis of the lens—drawn in section—at a point
near its circumference. These rods are attached near their ends to op-
posite parts of a cord which moves over pulleys attached to the frame.
Since the angle between the rods remains constant, by moving the cord
the variations in the positions of intersection of the rods with the axis,
4. €., the foci, may be clearly shown. A noteworthy modification of
this model enables the optical phenomena of the eye, accommodation,
emmetropia, myopia, and hypermetropia, to be shown distinctly to an
entire class.—(J. Phys., ix, 340, October, 1880.)

Stevenson has suggested an instrument for exploring dark cavities
which are inaccessible to direct light. It is simply a train of prisms by

268 PHYSICS.

which the ray is properly bent, these prisms being suitably achroma-
tized. Light is thrown into them from a mirror at the end of the train.
This traverses the system, illuminates the object by reflection from the
last surface, also a, mirror, and then returns over the same path, passing
to the eye through an opening in the first mirror. The number of prisms
which may be used is limited only by the light and the definition.—(Na-
ture, xxi, 14, November, 1879.)

Joseph Le Conte has continued his researches on binocular vision, and
has published a paper on the laws of ocular motion. The conclusion
which he reaches is that when the eyes move in the same direction,
parallel to each other, as in ordinary vision of objects, all their motions
are governed by the law of Listing; 7. e., they are effected without rota-
tion on the optic axes. But when, on the contrary, they move in oppo-
site directions, as in strong convergence, then the law of Listing is en-
tirely abrogated or overborne and another law reigns in its place—(Am.
J. Sci., III, xx, 83, August, 1880.)

Steinhauser has pointed out a fixed relation between the size and rel-
ative position of the two views of a stereoscopic picture, the lenses of
the camera with which it is taken, and the optical arrangements of the
stereoscope in which it is to be viewed. If these relations are rightly
observed the effect of relief will be much more perfectly attained for all
parts of the picture. The eye-pieces of the stereoscope above the plane
of the photographie pictures ought to be made as nearly as may be
equal to the focal length of the objective of the photographer’s camera,
and this again should be about equal to the mean distance of easy
vision, or from 10 to 12 inches. Hence he suggests: Ist, that all stereo-
photographs should be taken with lenses of the same focal length, say
1o.; 2d, that all should be made of equal breadth or about 75™™;
and 3d, that the distance between the centers of the objective lenses
should be constant.—( Nature, xxi, 117, December, 1879.)

Obach has made a series of experiments to determine whether the
phosphorescent light of Balmain’s paint would produce any sensible
effect on the conductivity of selenium. For this purpose a Siemens
Selenium cell was used, which was exposed to a phosphorescent surface
20 by 30°, placed at 60™ distance. When exposed to the light reflected
from the ceiling of a semi-dark room, the light from the phosphorescent
surface reduced the conductivity of the selenium 0.7 per cent.; light
from the ceiling of a well-lighted room for 15 minutes, 2.4 per cent.;
light of sky at 5 p. m. for several minutes, 4.6 per cent.; light from
few inches magnesium ribbon, 5.1 per cent.; sunlight for two minutes,
7.8 per cent. The influence of 350 square centimeters of Juminous sur-
face, excited by diffused daylight, was found equal to 0.0014 standard
candle or 0.04 standard candle per square meter.—(Nature, xxii, 496,
September, 1880.)

Graham Bell presented to the American Association at its Boston
meeting a paper by himself and Tainter on the production and repro-
PHYSICS. 269

duction of sound by light. The apparatus devised for the purpose he
calls a photophone; and its action is based on the fact that when an in-
termittent beam of light is made to fall on a disk of almost any mate-
rial, this disk emits sounds whose pitch is the same as the number of
intermissions. The substance most sensitive, however, is selenium,
which, as is well known, diminishes in its electrical conductivity by the
action of light. When therefore an electric current was passed through
a selenium cell and a telephone, the intermittent beam of light falling
on the selenium varied its resistance so as to reproduce an intermittent
electrical current of the same pitch distinctly audible in the telephone.
The cell was made of disks of brass, alternating with slightly smaller
disks of mica, the metal disks being alternately united electrically. In
the grooves between these metal disks melted selenium was placed, and
the whole was heated to such a temperature that the selenium passed
into the crystalline state. This cell, placed in the focus of a parabolic
mirror, constituted the receiver. The transmitter consisted simply of a
sheet of mica or thin glass, silvered, against the back of which the voice
could be directed by means of a mouth-piece. Upon this a beam of con-
densed sunlight was allowed to fall, whence it was reflected to the dis-
tant receiver. On talking into the mouth-piece, the beam of light varied
correspondingly, and the spoken words became audible in the tele-
phone.—(Am. J. Sci., III, xx, 305, October, 1880. See also Ann. Chim.
Phys., V, xxi, 399, 560, 1880; Nature, xxii, 500; xxiii, 16, 58, 1880.)

Mereadier has studied the simpler forms of the photophone, which he
calls radiophone, a sort of optical siren, in which a rotating disk pierced
with holes is interposed in the path of light-rays, causing intermittences
of a period corresponding to the speed. The disk used is simply a sheet
of black paper gummed on a glass disk to avoid the whistling sound
noticed with perforated disks. The receiving disks were fixed in a suit-
able holder, at the end of a short hearing-tube of India rubber. When
the substance used was opaque, like zinc, copper, etc., the loudness is
the same, whether polished or not. Thin disks are better than thick
ones, and glass and quartz gave good results. <A film of smoke or paint
or of metallic silver on the front of the disk diminishes the effect, while
blackening the back of the disk makes it louder.—( Nature, xxiii, 209,
December, 1530.)

2. Dispersion and Color.

J. W. Draper has described a new form of spectrometer, intended for
comparing the brillianey of lights. It depends on the optical principle
that a light is invisible in presence of another sixty-four times stronger.
To produce it, the scale-tube is removed from the common three-tubed

spectroscope, and a piece of glass ground on both sides is placed against

the aperture. By placing a gas-flame in front of this glass, the field
appears uniformly illuminated. This is the extinguishing light. With-
out it, the spectrum of a luminous flame placed before the slit appears

=
210 PHYSICS.

as usual. With it, this spectrum appears in a field of light, the bril-
liancy of which can be varied at pleasure. When the extinguishing
flame is distant, the whole spectrum is visible. As it comes nearer, the
violet first disappears, and then the other colors in the order of their
brightness. Though the yellow is commonly supposed to be the bright-
est of the rays, yet it disappears in this treatment in the order of its
refrangibility, the red being plainly perceptible long after the yellowhas
gone. ‘To render the extinguishing light more intense in order that it
may obliterate very bright spectra, the simple and efficient device was
adopted of depositing an exceedingly thin film of silver on the reflect-
face of the prism. This, while not perceptibly diminishing the
amount of transmitted light, increased markedly that of the reflected
beam. Sunlight was then tried with the same results. The prism was
then replaced by a grating, and the experiment repeated on the diffrac-
tion spectrum. In this all the colored spaces yielded apparently in an
equal manner,‘and all disappeared at the same moment. On diminish-
ing the illumination, all the colors came into view apparently at the same
time. The author concludes: 1st, that in the prismatic spectrum the
luminous intensity increases from the more to the less refrangible spaces,
its maximum being not in the yellow, but in the red. This is due to the
action of the prism, which narrows and as it were condenses the colored
spaces more and more as we pass toward the red, increasing the intensity
of the light as it does that of the heat; 2d, that in the grating or dif-
fraction spectrum the luminous intensity is equal in all the visible regions,
all the colors being simultaneously obliterated by an extinguishing light.
The distribution of heat is therefore that of light.—(Am. J. Sct., II,
xviii, 30, July, 1879.)

Cornu has contrived a spectroscope intended especially for the study
of the ultra violet rays. The object-glass alike of the collimator and the
observing telescope is an achromatic lens, consisting of a double convex
lens of quartz and a plano-concave lens of cale-spar, both cut perpen-
dicular to the optic axis. This combination is especially useful for the
ultra violet rays, allowing all the rays to pass that reach us through
our atmosphere, and being almost absolutely achromatic for them; so
that the adjustment required for different parts of the spectrum is
almost nothing. The prism used may be of cale-spar, though it absorbs
rays of the highest refrangibility; or of quartz, though if the axis is
parallel to the optic axis, the double refraction interferes. This is obvi-
ated by using a prism made of two halves of contrary rotation, the
interior face being perpendicular to the axis. To obtain a double dis-
persion, the two prisms of quartz have their bisecting planes perpen-
dicular to the optic axis, but having opposite rotatory power.—(J. Phys.,
vili, 85, June, 1879.)

Lamansky has proposed a special form of spectroscope for studying
fluorescent liquids. Ordinarily a glass plate has intervened between
the liquid and the spectrum made to enter it. Hagenbach places the
- |

PHYSICS. 271

slit and the prism-axis horizontally and projects the spectrum on the free
surface of the liquid. The author’s spectroscope consists of a graduated
circle carrying the collimator and telescope, and movable to any angle
in the vertical plane. A mirror sends the light into the collimator,
beyond the lens of which and in the same tube is a direct-vision prism.
The spectrum is thrown on the surface of the liquid contained in a small

vessel on a movable table attached to the stand. It passes from it into

the observing telescope, whose focal distance is shortened by a second
object-glass removable at will. The circle is divided for the purpose of
measuring the angles of incidence and emergence.—(J. Phys., viii, 411,
December, 1879; Nature, xxi, 267, January, 1880.)

Liveing and Dewar have snOhen the conditions of reversal of the ines
of métallic vapors. They used at first a tube, the closed extremity of
which was heated to incandescence in a furnace. The metal contaiaed in
the tube volatilizes; the light given by the bottom of the tube and by
its walls gives alone a continuous spectrum; but before reaching the
spectroscope it traverses the vapor. In the early experiments an iron
tube 15° in diameter and 80™ long was used, protected externally by a
glaze. It was heated for 30°, the upper extremity of the tube being
open and covered with a plate of mica or glass. A slow current of hydro-
geu prevented the vapors in the upper end of the tube from oxidizing.
The collimator of the spectroscope had its axis in line with that of the
tube. In this way the green thallium line, the blue indium line, the
lines }, and some blue lines of magnesium were reversed. The tempera-
ture not being sufficiently high, the authors next used a block of lime,
having a hole bored in its axis, 6 or 7™™ diameter, into the lower end
of which a lateral hole opened for the insertion of an oxyhydrogen jet.
Or two lateral holes may be bored opposite to one another and the two
carbons of a voltaic are introduced. Similar crucibles of carbon were
also used. By means of a mirror placed over the opening the light was
reflected to the spectroscope. In this way the reversal was accom-
plished of 13 of the 31 lines of potassium, of 4 of the 12 of sodium, of 6
out of 21 of barium, of 10 out of 34 of strontium, and of 11 out of 37 of
calcium. Beside these, 4 lines of lithium, 1 of cesium, 5 of magnes-
jum, and 2 of aluminum were also rev (Sm RYS., Nill,. BSD,
November, 1879. From Proc. Roy. Soc., xxvii, 132, 350, 494, 1878;

Peirce has called attention to the fact that a line in the diffraction spec-
trum (whether light or dark) must be shifted from its normal position
in case another line falls very near it. Neighboring lines must be at-
tracted if both are bright or both dark, and repelled if one is bright and
the other dark. The reason assigned is that the lines are only maxima
or minima of light, and the differential coefficient of the sum does not
vanish at the same points as the differential coefficients of the separate
terms. The shifting will be the greatest in the case of a faint line near
a very intense one. The author has succeeded in shifting the position

a

of lines by measurable amounts—one or two seconds.—(Nature, xxi,
108, December, 1879.)

Kundt has observed the phenomenon of anomalous dispersion in
sodium vapor. In preparing to reverse the sodium line for a lecture
experiment, he perceived that when the sodium vapor was very dense
and the dark line very broad a peculiar bend outward appeared at the
ends and on opposite sides of the line. The cone of sodium vapor in
the Bunsen flame acts as a prism with its refracting edge horizontal
and turned upward. If glowing sodium vapor give dispersion, this
cone should give, with horizontal rays passing through it, a vertical
spectrum, and if the rays have also passed through a glass prism with
a horizontal refracting angle, a spectrum of the form above described
should be obtained. From the position the refractive index of the
vapor is greatest for those rays which are most deflected downward.
The refractive index increases as the band is approached from the red
side, is less on the green side, and then rapidly increases again.—(Nature,
xxii, 302, July, 1880.)

Schuster has given an account of the spectra of lightning observed
by him in Colorado during the summer of 1878. He used a direct-vision
spectroscope furnished with a slit capable of micrometric movement.
A bright line in the focal plane served as a reference mark. The ob-
servations were limited to the yellow and the green regions from wave-
lengths 5000 to 5800. In making a measurement, the slit was dis-
placed until the line to be measured was coincident with the reference
line. The next morning its position was determined by reference to the
solar spectrum. A continuous spectrum was seen many times. Bright
nitrogen lines were often seen, those of wave-lengths 5002 and 5681
especially. Three bands of wave-lengths, 5592, 5334, 5182, were noted,
and a fourth about 5260. Of these, 5182 belongs to nitrogen, and 5592
and 5260 are characteristic of the oxygen discharge at the negative
electrode. The band 5354 is the most brilliant of the two green bands
of the spectrum of oxygen taken at a low temperature.—(Phil. Mag.,
V, vii, 316, 1879; J. Phys., viii, 275, August, 1879.)

Russell and Lapraik have discovered that many liquids, ordinarily as-
sumed to be colorless, give absorption bands when light passes through
them on its way to the spectroscope. The phenomenon was first noticed
with alcohol; and then it was perceived that water contained in a tube
6 feet long gave a very distinct absorption band in the orange, corre-
sponding very closely with Piazzi Smyth’s rain band and with the band
seen by Janssen in 330 feet of steam. No variations in this band were
observed by varying the source of supply, the temperature, or the sub-
stances held in solution. Other colorless liquids also gave bands. Am-
monia gave four bands; ethylamine also four, but different in character;
hydrogen peroxide, one; ethyl alcohol, one; amyl alcohol one; aldehyde
and acetic acid, each, one; benzene and toluene, three each; aniline and
toluidine, each, three; turpentine, two. These results are regarded as

preliminary, and will have further investigation.—(Nature, xxii, 368,
August, 1880.)

Rood has compared the color of the spectrum to which Newton gave
the name “indigo” with the actual color of indigo itself, and finds it to be
a representative of an entirely different region of the spectrum. He
shows: Ist, that the color of indigo is really a greenish blue when it 1s
used as a pigment or in solution; 2d, that the color of the dry cake is
not only very black, but is variable according to the mode in which it
is handled. He coneludes, therefore, that, taking all this into considera-
tion, it would appear desirable to allow the term “indigo” to fall into dis-
use, and tosubstitute for it “ultramarine,” the color of the artificial variety
being intended.—(Am. J. Sei., IL, xix, 135, February, 1880.)

Lord Rayleigh showed to the Physical Society of London a curious
experiment in color combination, by mixing a blue solution of litmus
with a red solution of potassium dichromate, and thereby producing a
yellow solution. In a similar way, a colorless liquid may be obtained
from a green solution of cuprous chloride in water and a red solution of
rosaniline acetate in amyl alcohol. When both are placed in a bottle,
the crimson solution floats on the green solution; but on agitating them,
both colors disappear, the mixture becoming grayish-white.—(Nature,
xxii, 133, June, 1880.)

Rood has presented to the National Academy a paper on memory for
color and luminosity, in which he gives the results of some interesting
experiments made to test the prevailing notion that we do not retain
for ten seconds an exact memory of a given shade or tint. The appara-
tus used consisted of two disks so arranged that either could be made
to overlap the other in any required proportion. These disks were of
different colors, which blended into a given tint when they were rapidly
revolved, a tint the percentage of whose components was known. Sup-
pose in one case this was 43 parts of yellow and 57 of red. After look-
ing at the revolving disk, an assistant disarranged the two and then
proceeded to reproduce the tint, Rood himself deciding when it was
reached. The reproduced color had 42.6 per cent. of yellov—a mean of
many trials, when the time of the entire experiment was not over a
minute. The error here was not over one-half of one per cent. When
an hour elapsed, the error was 2.2 per cent. Twenty-four hours after-
ward the error in reproducing the color was 4.5 per cent. The same
experiments tried by the assistant gave equally good results, as did also
similar experiments tried with other color mixtures.—(Nature, xxi, 144,
December, 1879.)

3. Interference and Polarization. .

Guebhard has devised a simple method of producing the phenomena
of Newton’s rings in a permanent form. While the rings obtained are
due to interference and give the colors of thin plates, they differ from
Newton’s rings proper in having the phenomena inverted, the greatest

thickness of the film being at the center. To produce the rings a little
collodion is dropped on a surface of mercury. It is drawn out on all
sides into a thin iridescent film, which when hard may be floated off on
to paper. Mastic varnish on the surface of water gives similar films.
Drops of volatile mineral oil on mercury, or even the film of moisture
condensed from the breath, give rings which of course are transient.
At a meeting of the Physical Society of Paris, Guebhard projected these
films on the screen; and showed that even the films condensed from the
breath may exhibit phoneidoscopic properties. The various vowels
being pronounced so that the breath impinges on the surface of the
cooled mercury, rings are obtained having certain forms more or less
strongly characteristic of their different qualities of tone.—(Nature, xxi,
242, January, 1880.)

Michelson has communicated to the New York Academy of Sciences
some interesting observations upon the diffraction and polarization
etfects produced by passing light through a narrow slit. If a fine ad-
justable slit be narrowed down very greatly, the colored diffraction
fringes widen out until when the width of the slit is reduced to less than
one fiftieth of a millimeter the central space only is seen, and appears
of a faint bluish tint. Moreover the light so transmitted exhibits traces
of polarization when regarded through a Nicol prism. As the slit is
narrowed, the depth of the tint and the amount of polarization increase,
until when the opening is only one-thousandth of a millimeter the color
becomes of a deep violet and the light is completely polarized. Slits of
obsidian give the best results, because finer edges can be worked on it.
The plane of polarization is at right angles to the length of the slit.—
(Nature, xxii, 133, June, 1880.)

Crova has published a note on the two forms of polarizing prisms,
those of Nicol and of Foucault. In the former the two halves are
cemented by Canada balsam; in the latter they are separated by a layer
of air. In both cases the bases are oblique to the axis of the prism and
this occasions a considerable loss of light both at entrance and emer-
gence; to which, in the Foucault prism, must be added that lost by the
internal reflections. Both Hoffmann and Duboseq constructed Foucault
prisms with faces normal to the axis, but the loss of light internally re-
mained. Prazmowski has made a polarizing prism which is ikea Nicol,
except that the halves are cemented with linseed oil, the faces being
normal, More spar is required and the manufacture is long and difficult.
Almost no loss of light, however, takes place internally, the index of the
oil being 1.485, very near to the extraordinary index of spar, 1.483.
The field is increased to 319, against 21° in the Nicol and 8° in the
Foucault. For photometric purposes especially, Crova regards this
new prism of great advantage.—(J. Phys., ix, 152, May, 1880.)

Govi has illustrated the laws of circular polarization by an exceed-
ingly beautiful projection experiment, founded on the well-known fact

that the spectrum obtained of the colors produced by the interference —
PHYSICS. 275

of polarized light contains one or more dark bands, corresponding to
the colors extinguished by the interference. If the depolarizing plate
be of quartz, the bands are moved along the spectrum to the right or
left by rotating the analyzer. Govi’s device consists in rotating the
analyzer and the direct-vision prism together at the same velocity. A
circular spectrum is thus produced, red at the center and violet on the
edges, or the reverse. As the dark quartz band moves along the spec-
trum by an amount proportional to the rotation angle, interference will
take place along this circular spectrum along points which form, geomet-
rically, a spiral of Archimedes, which persistence of vision makes per-
manent. Thicker quartz gives two, three, or more interlacing spirals,
forming a very striking optical! experiment.—( Nature, xxii, 595, October,
1880.)

Klocke has discovered that in its action on polarized light, hyposul-
phite of lead is anomalous. It ordinarily polarizes circularly, but when
plates cut perpendicuiarly to the optic axis, are viewed in a parallel beam
of polarized light they appear unequally bright, being divided by dark
bands into six sectors, opposite pairs of which are equally bright. Even
in convergent light the usual ring system of uniaxial crystals is not
seen, but in each sector there appears a figure characteristic of biaxial
crystals, the plane of the optic axes being perpendicular to the neighbor-
ing edge of the erystal. It would thus appear that the six portions are
compressed equally, each ina direction perpendicular to the neighboring
face of the prism.—( Nature, xxiii, 209, December, 1880.)

Beequerel has published a memoir on the polarization of the sky.
He finds that, contrary to the general opinion, the plane of polarization
for a given point does not generally pass through the sun, but that the
angle which this plane makes with the plane of the sun (a plane pass-
ing through the point, the sun, and the eye of the observer) varies. from
minute to minute so that the plane of polarization passes a little below
the sun, between it and the horizon. If the point be in the northern or
southern sky this angle is very small in the morning, increases to a max-
imum from nine to ten o’clock, disappears at noon, increases again to a
maximum about 2 or 3 p. m., again diminishing and becoming zero as
the sun sets. If the point be east or west, coincidence of the two planes
is not seen, though a minimum is observed about noon. At morning
and evening the angle attains maxima, reaching even 6°. From these
phenomena the appearance is as if the plane of polarization suffered a
direct rotation, viewed by an observer whose head was toward the north
and his feet toward the south. Since in a region perpendicular to the
dipping needle, the rotation is sensibly zero, the author believes that it
is due to the influence of the earth’s magnetism—an opinion strengthened
by the fact that he has just measured the amount of rotation of a polar-
ized-light ray traversing a layer of carbon disulphide, under the influ-
ence of the earth’s magnetism.—(Ann. Chim. Phys., V, xix, 90, January,
1880; J. Phys., ix, 51, February, 1880.)
276 PHYSICS.

Kerr has extended his electro-optical researches, and by the aid of new
and improved apparatus has confirmed his early conclusions. The ap-
paratus includes a paraffin-oil lamp; a Nicol with its principal section
inclined 45° to the horizon; a cell for the liquid so arranged that the
line of junction of the electrodes is horizontal; a system of compensat-
ing glass plates which can be submitted to a vertical traction by means
of known weights; a neutralizing plate of glass of irregular structure,
to compensate the double refraction of the cell; a hand-compensator ;
a vertical strip of glass which can be flexed by the hand parallel to the
axis of the luminous bundle, designed to determine the direction of the
double refraction produced in the liquid; and an analyzing Nicol in-
clined at 45° to the horizon and 90° to the principal section of the polar-
izer. When adjusted the light is completely extinguished and can be
restored by the hand-compensator. The electric machine is then put
into action. With carbon disulphide a fraction of a turn suffices to re-
turn the light, which instantly disappears again on discharging the con-
ductor. The compensator shows a uniaxial double refraction like that
of glass submitted to traction parallel to the lines of force. With nitro-
benzene the light reappears only on drawing a spark from the second
electrode. In a subsequent paper, Kerr formally enunciates the fol-
lowing law: ‘The intensity of electro-optic action of a given dielectric
(or the difference of retardations of the ordinary and extraordinary rays)
per unit of thickness of the dielectric varies directly as the square of
the resultant electric force.” On the question of stress he says: ‘The
dioptric action of an electrically charged medium is closely related to
the electric stress of the medium, the axis of double refraction coincid-
ing in every case with the line of electric tension and the double refrac-
tion varying, certainly in CS,, and probably in all other dielectrics
directly and simply as the intensity of the tension.”—( Phil. Mag. V., viii,
85, 1879; ix, 157, 1880; J. Phys., viii, 414; ix, 255, 1880.) |

ELECTRICITY.
1. Magnetism.

Carré has introduced into Paris the manufacture of magnets of su-
perior quality made of cast iron. His process is as follows: A soft and
very slightly carburetted metal is melted in earthen crucibles, and just
before running it into the moulds 10 or 15 per cent. of steel filings are
added. In order to produce a metal which will stand tempering at a
cherry-red heat, there is added either 1 to 1.5 per cent. of nickel, with
0.25 per cent. of copper, or 2 per cent. of tin and 0.5 per cent. of copper.
—(Nature, xxi, 359, February, 1880.)

Obalski has described to the Academy a very neat magnetic experi-
ment. Two magnetic needles are hung vertically by fine threads, their
unlike poles being opposite one another. Below them is a vessel con-
taining water, its surface not quite touching the needles, which are

7
PHYSICS. PCR

hung so far apart as not to move toward one another. If the level of
the water be now quietly raised by letting a further quantity flow in
from below, as soon as the water covers the lower ends of the needles
they begin to approach, and when they are nearly immersed they rush
together. The effect appears to be due to the fact that when the gray-
itation force downward is partly counteracted by the upward hydro-
static force due to immersion, the magnetic force is able to assert itself,
being greater.—( Nature, xxii, 133, June, 1880.)

Mayer has contrived an ingenious magnetic experiment to illustrate
molecular groupings and molecular actions. Sewing needles are mag-
netized all in the same direction. They are then pushed through small
pieces of cork up to the eye. On placing them in water they float ver-
tically, with the point downward. Since the similar poles are upward,
they repel each other. These needles represent molecules; their mag-
netism the repulsive force. To obtain an attractive force, a bar magnet
is held vertically over the water, so that the pole of contrary name to the
tops of the needles shall be downward. The needles are attracted and
approach each other, producing groupings which depend on the number
of the needles, their initial position, and the impulses given. Twenty-
three of these groupings are represented in the paper, the most com-
plex figures being formed of twenty needles; though the author has
formed much more complex ones, more than fifty needles having been
grouped in one of his figures. The author employs these groupings to
illustrate many of the laws of both molecular and atomic arrangement.
When projected by means of a vertical lantern they are very striking.
—(Am. J. Sci., ILI, xv, 276; xvi, 247; J. Phys., viii, 32, January, 1879.)

Barker has communicated to the National Academy the results of some
experiments made to test the alleged incorrectness of Arago’s explana-
tion of the magnetism of a wire through which a current is passing, 7. é.,
that the wire is itself magnetic. Bache had explained the result by
supposing the iron filings, held by the wire in Arago’s experiment, be-
came themselves magnets under the influence of the current, and so
became attached to each other rather than to the wire. In proof of this
he says that if a card be scraped along on the top of the wire the ring
of filings is broken and the whole mass falls. Barker used in his
experiments a quantity magneto-machine made by Wallace, the current
from which was capable of heating three feet of quarter-inch gas pipe
to bright redness in a minute. When this current was passed through
a copper wire, a 5-inch iron spike held close under the wire was mark-
edly attracted by it; and when placed in contact with the lower side of
the wire, adhered readily magnetically, placing itself with its axis per-
pendicular to that of the wire. This result was the same when the con-
ducting wire was red hot. In a second experiment the wire passed
through a hole in a large sheet of glass. When this glass was sprinkled
with iron filings concentric magnetic curves, complete and partial, were
formed round the wire for a distance of 20 inches. These experiments
seemed conclusive that the copper wire really was itself a magnet in
this case.—(Nature, xxi, 145, December, 1879.)

Lemstrém has described to the Physical Society of St. Petersburg
an experiment of great apparent significance. He finds that a ring of
insulating material, when rotating about its axis of symmetry with a
high velocity, acts like a galvanic circuit and produces a magnetic field
in the space within it. He explains it by supposing that the ether in the
insulator, being dragged along by the ring, produces. vortical motion of
the ether in the central space, which vortical motion be conceives to be
the essential condition of a magnetic field. On this experiment the
author founds his theory of terrestrial magnetism. Since rotating an
iron bar within an insulating medium ought to magnetize the bar, the
earth being a magnetic body rotating in an insulating medium ought to
be magnetized by its rotation.—( Nature, xxii, 89, May, 1880.)

Piazzoli has studied the influence of magnetism on the tenacity of
iron. Wires were hung between two hooks and ruptured by pouring
water into a vessel suspended from them. These wires were 35™ long, *
and were inclosed in a helix of four layers of wire. The current
was made to traverse these layers all in one direction, or two in one
direction and two in the opposite, the effect of heating being thus elimi- _
nated. The wires annealed in charcoal broke at 1260 to 1306 with, and

213 to 1270 without magnetization. Wires annealed in carbonous oxide
1732.4 to 1742.7 with, and 1703.62 to 1719.87 without the current.
Those annealed in hydrogen, 1289.5 to 1310.1 with, and 1263 to 1299.7
without the magnetism. The values are about from 1 to 3 per cent.
greater for the magnetized than for the unmagnetized wires, showing
that the tenacity of iron increases on magnetization.—(Nature, xxii, 89,
May, 1880.)

Righi has sought to harmonize the discordant results as to the changes
in the length of iron bars when magnetized. By means of a mirror
method which magnified the elongation 8,000 times, he ascertained tha
(1) magnetism produces an increase in iron and steel in the dimension
of the direction of magnetization; (2) a part of this increase remains
after the current ceases, being more or less according to the coercive
force; (3) when the current is not very strong, the elongations are pro-
portional to the square of the current strength; (4) after a strong current
has been sent through the spiral, a weak current sent in the opposite
direction produces a shortening, though the bar, even when demagnetized
by it, remains longer than normal; (5) during reversal of polarity the
length becomes momentarily less, the effect being oscillatory; (6) a bar
shortens at the instant of closing the circuit, when the current traverses it
directly; (7) it elongates on opening, but by a less amount; (8) on rever-
sal, the bar elongates and oscillates; (9) the contraction is greater if
the bar has been longitudinally magnetized previously ; and (10) some
bars show a tendency to take spiral magnetization, 7. e., to rotate the
magnetic axes of their molecules in the direction of the turns of the
helix.—( Nature, xxii, 543, October, 1880.)

PHYSICS. 279

Beequerel has published an extended memoir on the magnetic prop-
erties of nickel and cobalt compared with those of iron, using the oscil-
lation method, the differential method, and the electromagnetic-balance
method, for comparison, confining himself to the magnetism developed
by induction, and not the magnetism which remains permanent. The
author’s most important conclusion is that for very feeble intensities,
under conditions very far from saturation, or with substances in which
the magnetic particles are sufficiently removed, so as not to react the
one upon the other, the effects developed in the molecules of nickel and
of iron at the ordinary temperature appear to lie very near each other.—
(Ann. Chim. Phys., V, xvi, 227, February, 1879.)

Hodges has contrived a new instrument for determining the inclination
of the needle, founded on the fact that the magnetic polarity of a bar
of soft iron is greatest when the bar lies in the line of the dip. In place
of a single bar, however, the author uses two, joined to each other at
right angles. When the two branches make equal angles with the line
of dip, the ends next the junction are of opposite polarity; andif similar,
will neutralize one another so that a needle suspended near them will
remain unaffected. The results on trial were very accordant under dif-
ferent conditions.—(Am. J. Set., UI, xvii, 145, February, 1879.)

towland and Jacques have determined the diamagnetic contents of
bismuth and cale-spar in absolute measure, the former contributing the
theory, and the latter making the measurements. These latter consisted
of two: Ist, the determination in absolute measure of the magnetic
potential of the field used; and, 2d, the determination of the time of
vibration and the other constants of the little bars of the substances when
suspended in this field. The diamagnetic constant of bismuth along the
axis was found to be —.000000012554; and for cale-spar —.000000037930,
in absolute measure.—(Am. J. Sct., I, xviii, 360, November, 1879.)

2. Electromotors.

Hoorweg has investigated the conditions of the production of elec-
tricity in the voltaic cell, and has advanced a thermic theory of its origin.
The following are his conclusions: 1st. Wherever two conductors are in
contact, the heat movement has the production of electricity as a conse.
quence; hence a constant electric difference exists between the bodies.
2d. Whenever the sum of the differences of potential existing in a cir-
cuitis different from zero, a permanent current is produced. 3d. This cur-
rentabsorbs heat at certain of the points of contact and evolves it atothers.
4th. All voltaic currents are thermo-currents. 5th. All chemical actions
in the cell and in apparatus for electrolytic decomposition are a conse:
quence of the passage of the current.—(Ann. Phys. Chem., I, ix, 552, 1830;
J. Phys., ix, 352, October, 1880.)

Varenne has studied the phenomenon of the passivity of iron in nitric
acid as when employed as the positive plate of a Grove battery or the
positive electrode of a voltameter cell containing nitric acid. He con-
280 PHYSICS.

cludes that this peculiar effect is due to a film of nitrogen dioxide which
collects upon the surface of the iron and protects it from further chemi-
cal action. This film, he asserts, is apparent when the surface of the
iron is examined under the microscope. If a current of carbon dioxide
or of hydrogen gas is passed through the liquid the passivity ceases and
‘the iron is dissolved. Moreover, on placing the iron plate in vacuo
nitrogen dioxide is evolved from it.—(Nature, xxi, 117, December, 1879.)

Pellat has examined the standard cell proposed by Latimer Clark,
and finds that it is not entirely free from variations in its electromotive
force. According to his observations two of these cells may differ from
each other by a quantity equal to the one-hundredth of the electromotive
force of a Daniell cell. The method employed was to couple up the two
cells in opposition to one another, and then by means of an electrometer
to measure the residual difference of potential—(Nature, xxi, 117, De-
cember, 1879.)

Debrun has constructed an ingenious capillary electromotor, based
on the theorem established by Lippmann, that if a mercury surface be
detormed by mechanical means there is produced an evolution of elee-
tricity which tends to arrest the motion of the mercury. Through a
capillary tube mercury is caused to run drop by drop, acidulated water
being introduced, by means of a reservoir at the top, between each glob-
ule. Wires are connected with the masses of mercury at the upper and
lower ends of the tube, and a current is observed to flow, on closing
these in the direction in which the globules move. The tube actually
used was 2.5™™ in diameter at top and 1™™ at bottom, 30 long, con-
taining not less than 20 nor more than 35 globules. The electromotive
force under these circumstances is 1.4 volts, so that with Wollaston’s
points it can decompose water. The energy, however, is not very great,
since it is produced by the fall of only two kilograms of mereury per
hour through only 25°. In allowing the mercury to run for twenty-
four hours sufficient current was developed to silver strongly a five-
centime piece. The internal resistance of a column of acidulated water
1™™ jn diameter and 50™ long being so consilerable, a high-resistance
galvanometer should be used to test the currents produced by this in-
strument.—(J. Phys., ix, 28, January, 1880.)

Barrett has communicated to the Physical Society of London the fact
that the motion of a chalk cylinder under a metallic surface generates
an electric current, having an electromotive force of rather over one-
third of a volt. The strength of the current depends on the rapidity of
the rotation and the pressure on the chalk surface; the latter only
diminishing the very high internal resistance. The discovery, he says,
resulted from a suggestion made to him four or five months before, to
try whether Edison’s motograph telephone receiver could be used as a
transmitter. Then his experiments were not successful, but now he
finds that the voice is faintly but accurately transmitted on speaking
into the receiver while the chalk is made to rotate. But Edison had

— Se

PHYSICS. 281

himself published the same fact in the Scientific American one or two years
before, and had given a figure of several of these chalk cylinders con-
nected in series for the purpose of producing a current of high poten-
tial— (Nature, xxi, 417, March, 1880.)

Blyth has communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh the gen-
eral fact that electric currents are produced by the mere friction between
conducting substances. Since for all pairs of metals yet tried these
currents are in the same direction as the thermo-current produced by
heating the junction of the same two metals, the author thinks that they
may have in part a thermo-electric origin; but another part may be due
to the currents suggested by Sir William Thomson as the cause of frie-
tion, and still a third part to the force of contact between films of air or
oxide on the surfaces. One of the motors constructed consists of a
cylinder of antimony arranged so as to be rapidly rotated, and a plate
of bismuth which is pressed hard against it by a spring. When included
in the cireuit with a microphone and a Bell telephone, the current from
it is quite sufficient to serve for the transmission of musical sounds and
loud speaking. By using a cylinder of bismuth on which a bent sew-
ing needle presses as it rotates, a very good receiver is also produced.
The author ascribes the result to a heat change, analogous somewhat to
that observed in the Trevelyan rocker.—(Nature, xxii, 330, August,
1880.)

Heraud has proposed a new voltaic cell, the negative plate of which
is zine immersed in a concentrated solution of ammonium chloride, while
the positive consists of a plate of carbon surrounded by fragments of
carbon mixed with about an equal weight of mercurous chloride (calo-
mel) in powder. In action the mercurous chloride loses chlorine, and is
reduced to metallic mercury; the zine acts on the ammonium chloride,
producing zine chloride and ammonia; and the ammonia water and
chiorine unite again to reproduce the ammonium ehloride. It is claimed
that this battery does not polarize, and can be used on a closed circuit.
Its electromotive force is not far from that of a Daniell cell—(Ann. Chim.
Phys., V, xvii, 512, August, 1879.)

Niaudet has constructed a voltaic cell, the plates of which are also
zine and carbon; but the former is immersed in a solution of common
salt and the carbon in a porous cup containing commercial chloride of
lime (a mixture of chloride, oxide, and hypochlorite of caleium). Under
the action of the polarizing hydrogen, the hypochlorite is decomposed
into hydrochloric acid, which forms calcium chloride with the lime pres-
ent, and water; so that the salts produced by the battery when in action
are zine chloride and calcium chloride. Since both are extremely solu-
ble, the liquid preserves its limpidity, and no insoluble salt is formed.
The electromotive force of this battery is 1.6 volts. It polarizes only
when closed on short circuit, from which it recovers rapidly. Its chief
merit is that, like the Leclanché cell, the zine is not acted on until the
circuit is closed. ‘To prevent escape of odors, the opening in the porous
cell is closed with a waxed cork.—(J. Phys., ix, 18, January, 1880.)
232, PHYSICS.

Niaudet has given an illustrated description of the Noé thermopiles
constructed by Hauck, of Vienna, and exhibited in Paris. The elements
used are German silver, employed in the form of wire, four from each
junction, and an antimony alloy cast in a mould. Each pair has an
electromotive force equal to 0.1 Daniell cell, for a temperature at which
the ends are below redness. It resistance is 0.1 of a Siemens unit per
element.—(J. Phys., viii, 230, July, 1879.)

D’Arsonval has suggested an improvement in Plante’s secondary
batteries, which, as is well known, consist of two sheets of lead im-
mersed in dilute sulphuric acid. The action is limited at the cathode
by the hydrogen bubbles which form there, and at the anode by the
low conductivity of the lead peroxide film which forms over its surface.
The first of these difficulties d’Arsonval obviates by electrolyzing a
salt of zine instead of a dilute acid. The second he avoids by increas-
ing the surface of the anode, employing for this purpose shot heaped
about a carbon plate. The liquid employed is a strong solution of zine
sulphate. While charging, zine is deposited upon the surface of a lead
plate, or, better, upon a free surface of mercury amalgam, sulphuric acid
being produced at the same time. Its electromotive force is claimed to
be 2.1 volts.—( Nature, xxi, 409, February, 1880.) z

Breguet has published a memoir upon the theory of the Gramme
machine, and on the cause of the dissymetric position of its brushes.
The following are his conclusions: Ist. The theory of the Gramme and
von Alteneck machines is directly connected with that of Barlow’s wheel
and Faraday’s machine, and these latter machines rest on the first
principle established by Ampére, @. ¢., a movable current tends to place
itself in such a position that the observer who personifies it sees the
south pole on his left and the north pole on his right hand. 2d. The
soft iron armature of the von Alteneck machine serves only to re-en-
force the magnetic field in the region where the wires of the movable
circuit revolve. 3d. The annular armature of soft iron of the Gramme
machine has the same influence as the preceding armature, but this is
not its characteristic function. This function consists in shielding the
internal wires of the bobbin spires from the normal action of the lines
of force of the field. 4th. The angular displacement of the brushes of
the preceding machines cannot be attributed to the retardation of the de-
magnetization of the soft iron ring alone, since this displacement still
exists and may even become still more considerable in those forms de-
rived from these machines where there is no soft iron armature.—(Ann.
Chim. Phys., V, xvi, 5, January, 1879.)

3. Electrical measurements.

Pellat has devised a method for measuring electromotive force which
may be applied to a battery or may be used to determine the difference
of potential between two metals in contact. The principle consists in
opposing to the cell to be measured an electromotive force variable at
PHYSICS. 283

will continuously and by amounts exactly known by a simple reading,
until the compensation is exact. The instrument resembles that of Du
Bois Reymond, but it uses a capillary electrometer in place of a galva-
nometer, and thus, while more delicate and more rapid, polarization is
completely avoided. Moreover, the sensitiveness of the method is inde-
pendent of the resistance of the cell, batteries of 10,000,000 ohms resist-
ance being measured with ease. Ifor weak electromotive forces, the
delicacy is one ten-thousandth of a Daniell cell; for stronger ones, to one
two-thousandth of a Latimer-Clark cell. The applications of the method
to determine the contact-potential are very ingenious.—(J. Phys.,ix,145,
May, 18°0.)

Debrun has made a useful modification of Lippmann’s capillary elec-
trometer. In the original instrument, in a tube a millimeter in diameter,
the mercury level changed only 3™™ for a difference of potential of one
volt, and to measure small fractions Lippmann used a microscope. In
the new instrument this delicacy is secured by making the tube inclined
to the vertical, the effect increasing with the angle. A glass tube
7™™ in diameter is drawn out so as to give a capillary tube slightly con-
ical, and a good millimeter in diameter and 20™ long. This is bent into
a Z-form, the connecting portion being placed horizontally, but fastened
to a movable board, so that its inclination may be adjusted. The ends
of the tube open into reservoirs. It is filled with mereury and acid-
ulated water, as usual, the end of the mercury column being adjusted to
occupy three-quarters of the horizontal part. Electrical connections are
made with the mereury in each of the reservoirs. The calibration is
effected by using a battery of known potential, increasing the cells.—(J.
Phys., ix, 160, May, 1880.)

Niemdller has found the telephone capable of determining very quickly
and accurately the resistance of liquids. It is substituted for the gal-
vanometer in a Wheatstone’s bridge, and an induction current is used.
If the resistances to be compared are a large liquid resistance and a
Siemens resistance box, so that the electrodynamie constants are very
small; and if also a German-silver or platinum wire be used as measur-
ing wire, it is found that in the position where the galvanometer shows
no deflection, the tone in the telephone has a well-marked minimum of
intensity. In a liquid resistance of 2,000 units a variation of even four
units may be detected readily.—(Nature, xxi, 309, January, 1880.)

Trowbridge has studied the conditions which cause the ticking of the
time-clock of Harvard College Observatory, transmitted electrically by
wire from Cambridge to Boston, to be heard on all the telephone cir-
cuits in the neighborhood of the line. He shows from theoretical con-
siderations that the usual explanation of induction between the wires
is erroneous, and that the effects observed on telephonic circuits, which
have usually been attributed to induction, are really due to the earth
connections and to imperfect insulation. As the result, then, is due to
the fact that the wires on which the sound is heard obtain their current
284 PHYSICS.

by tapping the ground at places of different potential, the author made
experiments to determine the equipotential surfaces formed by the
ground of the time signal-service. By running a wire 500 or 600 feet,
placing its terminals in moist earth, and including a telephone in the
circuit, the ticking of the clock could be readily heard in a field an
eighth of a mile distant from the observatory ; and at one point a mile
distant the ticking was heard with only 50 feet of wire. Behind the
observatory no result was had, though at no point were earth currents
absent. ‘ Theoretically,” the author concludes, “it is possible to day
to telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean without a cable”; “ practically
the expenditure of energy on the dynamo-electric engines would seem
to be enormous.”—(Am. J. Sci., III, xx, 138, August, 1880.)

Hill has devised an electro-dynamometer for use especially with strong
currents, which in general is similar to Trowbridge’s instrument, but
differs from it in the manner of determining the deflective power of the
current. To the suspended coil a pointer-rod is attached, on opposite
sides of which silk threads are fastened, which lead over pulleys on the
side bars to small pans, one on each side of the instrument. When the
deflection has taken place weights are added to the pan on the opposite
side until the pointer-rod returns to zero. In the instrument as con-
structed a current of 20 webers required about half a gram weight, and
one of 100 webers a weight of 13.2 grams. The instrument works weil
and gives uniform results.—(Am. J. Sci., xix, 10, January, 1880.)

Hughes has devised an apparatus, which he calls an induction balance,
for comparing induced currents. It consists (1) of a battery of three
Daniell cells, the current of which traverses a microphone with an at-
tached clock for producing the sounds; (2) of the balance proper; (3) of
an electric sonometer; and (4) of a receiving telephone. The balance
itself is formed of four equal coils, a decimeter in height, 5.5°™ external
diameter, with a space of 3° internally, each covered with 100 meters of
No. 32 covered copper wire. The four coils form two groups placed be-
yond each other’s influence. At each end, therefore, there are two
coils, one inducing, the other receiving the induction, placed end to
end, and about 5™™ apart. The electric sonometer is formed of two sim-
jlar inducing bobbins fixed at the ends of a horizontal rule 40°™ long,
divided into millimeters. Along this rule moves a receiving coil. The
electric current from the microphone reaches a commutator which directs
it into the balance or into the sonometer, where it traverses the induc-
ing coils. The telephone circuit passes through the receiving coils, first
the two on the balance, in opposite directions, and then that on the
sonometer. No sound is heard in the telephone if the receiving coil in
the latter case be equidistant from the inducing ones. Nosound is heard
in the balance coils if they are empty; but if a fragment of metal be
placed between them, a sound is heard louder according to the character
of the metal. The current is passed alternately into the balance and
the sonometer, and the coil of the latter is displaced until the sounds

PHYSICS. 285

have the same intensity in each. The action of the metal is then indi-
cated on the graduation of the sonometer.—(Phil. Mag., V, viii, 50, 551,

4. Hlectric spark and light.

Spottiswoode has experimented on the use of the alternating current
of a De Meritens magneto-electric machine for exciting the induction
coil. He used a coil giving a 50™ spark, the reversals being 1,300 per
minute; no interrupter was therefore needed. Under these conditions
sparks were obtained only 18™ long, but they were as thick as an or-
dinary pencil. They showed a brilliant point at each extremity of a
tongue of yellow flame. When the current passed freely no spark
proper appeared; but by blowing on one side, brilliant sparks may be
made to pass.—(Phil. Mag., V, viii, 390; J. Phys., ix, 37, 1880; Nature,
xxi, 433, March, 1880.)

Harmer has called attention to the fact, as a contribution to the his-
tory of electric lighting by incandescence, that in July, 1859, his house
in Salem was lighted every evening by a subdivided electric light. A
galvanic battery of three dozen six-gallon jars in the cellar furnished
the electric current. On the mantel in the parlor were two electric
lamps, either of which could be lighted at pleasure or both at once by
simply turning a little button. The light was soft, mild, agreeable to
the eye, and more delightful to read or sew by than any light ever seen
before. It was discontinued on account of the expense. On the cost of
electric light as compared with gas Farmer says: ‘ On the average one
pound of illuminating gas will, if burned in an hour in five different
burners, give fifteen candle lights to each burner, or seventy-five can-
dle lights in all. One pound of illuminating gas possesses a sufficient
store of energy to enable it to give out by combustion from 18,000 to
21,000 units of heat, or the equivalent of from 13,000,000 to 16,000,000
foot-pounds of work. This, if burned in an hour, would average from
200,000 to 260,000 units of work per minute, or say from 3,000 to 3,500
foot-pounds per minute per candle light. Now a very large electric
light, say ten thousand candles, does not consume more than 15 or
20 foot-pounds of energy per minute per candle light. So it might not
seem very extravagant to expect that one pound of gas per hour could
be burned in a suitable furnace under a proper boiler, and steam be taken
from this boiler to a steam-engine, and this engine drive a magneto-
electric machine which should supply electricity to five electric lamps
that would shed forth more light than could be given by five of the best
gas lamps known, each lamp consuming at the rate of one-fifth of a
pound of the best illuminating gas per hour.”—(Am. J. Sci., II, xvii,
65, January, 1879.)

which he has made use of the electrodynamic action of a coil of wire to

keep the are steady and pointing in one direction. The two carbons are
parallel but inverted, han ging with their pointsdownward. ‘They have
no insulating material between them. Surrounding these, and in their
own plane, is a flat coil of wire through which the main current cireu-
lates. The trials with this lamp in Paris are said to have been success-
ful.—(Nature, xxii, 355, August, 1880.)

Reynier has proposed an incandescent light in which the point of a
thin stick of carbon presses against a fixed carbon contact, while on it
laterally, a short distance above, a third piece of carbon makes contact.
The current enters by this lateral carbon and traverses the carbon pen-
cil to its pointed end, passing thence to the solid carbon support. The
pencil becomes thus incandescent, emitting most light at its point. Its
photometric value varies from five to twenty carcel burners, according
to the current.—(J. Phys., viii, 400, December, 1879.)

Siemens has presented to the Society of Telegraph Engineers a paper
on recent applications of the dynamo-current to metallurgy, horticulture,
and the transmission of power. By means of an electric furnace made
of a black-lead crucible, the positive carbon entering through the bottom
and the negative through the cover, steel had readily been melted.
Using a moderate-sized dynamo-machine, consuming four horse-powers
and producing 36 webers of current—equal to a 6,000 candle light—he
raises a crucible 20° deep to a white heat in less than half an hour, and
a kilogram of steel is fused in it in another half hour. This furnace
utilizes one-third of the horse-power actually expended; and as the effi-
ciency of the engine is one-fifth, that of the electric furnace is §x1= 7).
As it takes theoretically 450 heat units to melt a pound of steel, the fur-
nace would require 450 x 15=6750 heat units to be expended, or about
the energy of a pound of coal. A ton of steel as ordinarily melted in an
air furnace requires 24 to 3 tons of coke; inaregenerative furnace about
aton. The electric furnace is economically superior to the air furnace
and nearly equal to the regenerative furnace. When the paper was read,
a pound of broken files was melted in a cold crucible, by means of a cur-
rent of 72 webers, in fifteen minutes, and cast in a mould. With refer-
ence to the action of light on plants, the interesting experiments made
by him in this direction were detailed, and an account given of the ex-
periments now in progress to produce flowers and fruits without solar
aid. Under the third head of his paper, Siemens described his brother’s
electric railway in Berlin, and its numerous applications.—( Nature, xxii,
135, June, 1880.)

Edison has finally determined upon the use of carbon filaments in his
incandescent lamps. These filaments are constructed by cutting with
a suitable punch, from a piece of Bristol board, a strip in the form of a
miniature horseshoe, about two inches in length and one-sixteenth of
an inch in width. These are laid in a wrought-iron mould, separated
from each other by tissue paper, and heated first by a gas flame and
then in a furnace to a white heat. After cooling, the charred fiber is
PHYSICS. 287

sealed in a globe, which is then exhausted to one-millionth of an atmos-
phere. Subsequently, in experimenting with various fibers, Edison came
to the conclusion that a natural fiber was more durable than an artificial
one, and that Japanese bamboo furnished the best. The lamps which
are now made on the large scale are constructed with these fibers.

Rowland and Barker have made a series of measurements to test the
efficiency of Edison’s lamp. They compared the loss of energy in the
lamp, as measured in the calorimeter, with the amount of light emitted,
measured on the photometer. The lamps used were five in number,
four of them having carbons made from paper, and one a natural fiber
carbon. The comparisons were made by having two lamps in circuit,
one being in the calorimeter and the other on the photometer in the first
experiment, and their positions being reversed in the second. No. 201,
which gave a mean of 10.1 candles on the photometer, gave 5486 foot-
pounds of energy in the calorimeter; No. 580, which gave 13.1 mean
randle lights, evolved 3540 foot-pounds. But when No, 201 was made
to give 28.9 candles, its energy was only increased to 4898 foot-pounds;
and No. 580, which gave 33.5 candles, evolved only 5181 foot-pounds ;
the cost of doubling the light being one-half more energy only. No.
809 gave 14.3 candles, and used 3330 foot-pounds; No. 850 gave 9.2
candles, and consumed 2483 foot-pounds. No. 817, the fiber lamp, gave
17.2 candles for a consumption of 2708 foot-pounds of energy. The
mean of the first two is 109 candles per horse-power of current; of the
second two, 204.3 candles; of the third two, 133.4; and of the fourth,
209.6. Or, in the first, 6.8 gas jets of 16 ondies in the second 12.8, in
the third 8.3, and in the fourth 13.1 gas jets would be yielded by each
horse-power of current. From the efficiency of Edison’s machine, the
authors think that the yield per indicated horse-power of the engine
would not be far from 70 per cent. of these values.—(Am. J. Sci., UL,
xix, 337, April, 1880.)

Brackett and Young have also made measurements on Edison’s lamp,
in addition to others upon his Faradie machine. Comparison of the
Edison dynamometer with the Prony brake showed that the latter reg-
istered 93.2 per cent. of the power transmitted by the former. In their
first experiment, the power expended was measured by the dynamometer
and the current by the copper voltameter. The total efficiency was
found to be 82.3 per cent., and the available efficiency 78.7 per cent. In
the second trial the energy produced was measured by 7a calorimeter,
and the total efficiency was found to be 84.6 per cent., the available, 78.2
percent. A third test gave 84.5 total, and 78.2 available efficiency. But
one lamp was tested, No. 853, the carbon of which was from paper.
The mean illumination was 10.1 candles; the resistance, hot, 99.6 olims;
the differcnee of potential, 74.33 volts; hence the current nee was
0.75 weber, and the lamp was consuming (0.075 horse-power. This gives
137 candies per horse-power of current, or 107 candles per horse-power
at the dynamometer; a near correspondence with the preceding re-
sults —(Am. J. Sci., ILI, xix, 475, June, 1830.)

288 - ' PHYSICS.

Morton, Mayer, and Thomas have published results of measurements
of Edison’s lamp No. 154. The resistance of the lamp when cold was
123 ohms; when giving 1.9 candles, 82 ohms; and when giving 18 can-
dles, 75 ohms. The current strength was measured on a tangent galva-
nometer, the constant of which was determined on a copper voltameter.
When the lamp was giving 0.07 of a candle, it was consuming 0.445
weber of current, equivalent to 0.024 horse-power. When it gave 14
candles, the current was increased to only 1.079 webers, equivalent to
0.116 horse-power. This latter result gives 120 candles.to the horse-
power of current, or, assuming 60 per cent. efficiency in the machine,
72 candles per effective horse-power.—(Ann. Chim. Phys., V, xx, 275,
June, 1880.)

Swan has continued his experiments on incandescent lighting, begun,
as he claims, as long ago as 1860. He uses carbon filaments made from
parchment paper, 3 inches long, 0.01 inch in diameter, weighing 335 grain,
sealed in exhausted globes. One of these has burned continuously for
three months.—(Nature, xxiii, 104, December, 1880.)

CHEMICAL PHYSICS.

Angus Smith has suggested a new series of elemental molecules, the
relative weights of which are produced by squaring the atomic weights
and dividing by the equivalence. This idea was reached in the course
of his investigations into the absorption of gases by charcoal, in which
it appeared that the gases were absorbed in perfectly definite volumes.
Thus, eight volumes of oxygen are absorbed for one of hydrogen ; but as
the former is 16 times as heavy, the weights absorbed are as 128; 1.
But this is $(16)’; 7. e., half the square of the density, or half the square
of the atomic weight, or half the product of the two. Of nitrogen 4.66
volumes are absorbed, or 14 x 4.66 by weight, 65.3; this number is $(14)?.
Of compound gases the law is different. Carbonous oxide is absorbed
to the extent of 6 volumes, carbon dioxide 64 16=22 volumes, marsh gas
6+4=10 volumes, nitrogen monoxide 8+4.66=12.66 volumes. Hence
the new molecular weight of CO, is simply 22?, &c.—(Nature, xix, 354,
February, 1879.)

Thomsen has studied the relation between the total energy developed
in the chemical reactions which occur in various kinds of voltaic bat-
teries and the energy which appears in the form of current electricity.
He used a thermal method of measuring the total energy, and found that
the whole of the energy developed in the chemical change appeared as
electric energy in Daniell’s battery on closed circuit, and also in the
other forms of battery in which the metallic surface of the negative elec-
trode is not changed by the electrolytic process. When nitric acid is
used as the electrolyte the same total conversion of energy takes place,
but the gradual absorption by the liquid of reduction products dimin-
ishes the result.—(Nature, xxiii, 207, December, 15380.)

Hesehus has made a series of experiments upon the change in vol-
ume and elasticity undergone by palladium when it occludes hydrogen.
Wires 500™™ long and 0.4" diameter were stretched in a tube of glass
placed vertically and filled with diluted sulphuric acid, and made the
cathode. By a cathetometer the elongation was directly measured
during the absorption. The pure palladium wire elongated 5™™, while

wires of alloys with 25 per cent. of silver, platinum, and gold, elongated
11.777, 6.14™™, and 0.9™™ respectively. With six bichromate cells the
action was complete in an hour. After removing the battery the short-
ening took place in the same order, though less rapidly; being for the
palladium wire only 2.6™™ in 24 hours. The law of these variations was
automatically recorded. The coefficient of elasticity of palladium pure
fell from 15540 to 14000; and that of the silver alloy from 15240 to
12500.—(J. Phys., ix, 365, October, 1880.)

Berthelot has quoted Pictet’s experiments on the liquefaction of oxy-
gen and hydrogen gases as illustrating his thermochemical views. The
oxygen was prepared by heating potassium chlorate. Now, the reac-
tion K Cl O;—=K Cl + O; according to Berthelot evolves 11 calories.
Hence, being exothermic and not limited by its inverse, it is not arrested
by a pressure of 320 atmospheres. The hydrogen was prepared by the
action of potassium hydrate upon the formate. Since K CHO, + KO
H= K, CO; + H, evolves 18.4 calories, this action is also exothermic
and not limited by an inversereaction. Hence, the gas should be evolved,
as Pictet found it to be, at over 600 atmospheres. Exothermic reactions
continue, then, whatever the pressure.—(Ann. Chim. Phys., V, xv, 149,
October, 1878.)

Thorpe has published the results of an extended research on the re-
lation between the molecular weights of substances and their specific
gravities when in a liquid state. He concludes: (1) that many isomeric
liquids, even of the same chemical type, have not identical specific grav-
ities at their boiling points, and hence not identical specific volumes.
Since this occurs mainly in compounds of carbon and hydrogen, the in-
ference is that the specific volume of one or both of these bodies is not
absolutely invariable; (2) that oxygen, sulphur, and nitrogen have also
variable specific volumes; (3) that there is no evidence that the specific
volume of any other element is variable; (4) that the number of these
latter atoms does not modify the volume, which is independent of the
molecular complexity ; (5) that the different members of a family of ele-
ments do not possess identical specific volumes, these volumes being
periodic functions of the atomic weights; (6) that no evidence is afforded
that the specific volume is modified by any variation in the affinity value
of any element.—(Nature, xxii, 262, July, 1880.)

Violle has determined the specific heat and melting point of palla-
dium, iridium, gold, and copper. For palladium the specific heat was
found to be, at 0°, 0.0582; at 500°, 0.0682; at 1000°, 0.0782; at 13009,
0.0842. For iridium, at 0°, 0.0317 ; at 500°, 0.0377 ; at 1000°, 0.0437, and
at 1400°, 0.0485. Gold has a specific teat at 0° of 0.0324; at 900°,
0.0345, and at 1020°, 0.0352. The fusing point of silver was found to
be 954° C. referred to the air thermometer; of gold, 1035°; of copper,
1054°; of palladium, 1500°; of platinum, 1775°, and of iridium, 19509.

Victor and Carl Meyer, in determining the vapor density of chlorine

CHEMISTRY. 291

by their new method, the chlorine being produced by dropping platinous
chloride into the tube heated to 1200°, have found that at these high
temperatures this gas has a density only two-thirds of that correspond-
ing to themoleculeCl,. Subsequently Craftsrepeated the determination,
using already-prepared chlorine, and found its density to be normal; a
result confirmed by Victor Meyer, working in conjunction with Ziiblin.
To reconcile these facts it seems to be necessary to admit that while
free chlorine is stable at high temperatures, nascent chlorine is not, but
undergoes dissociation into products not yet known. The results, how-
ever, obtained by the German chemists with iodine, which showed the
Same anomaly, were fully confirmed by Crafts. Its vapor has at 1570°
two-thirds of its normal density. Bromine is intermediate, its vapor
density being reduced only one-fifth at high temperatures, when the
bromine was free, and one-third when it was nascent.—(Ber. Berl. Chem.
Ges., xii, 1426, 2066, 2202, 2204, 1879; xiii, 394, 399, 401, 405, 851, 1050,

Am. J. Sci., III, xviii, 222, 1879.)

Offret has revised the calculations of Pictet by which he reached a
density of 0.9883 and 0.9787 for liquefied oxygen, and has shown errors
in them by which the density is reduced to 0.8655; a result close to
0.8402, which the author obtains by a different process of computation.
—(Ann. Chim. Phys., V, xix, 271, February, 1880.)

Berthelot has published a work in two volumes, entitled ‘Essai de
mécanique chimique fondée sur la Thermochimie.” One of the laws it
establishes is the following: ‘Every chemical change effected without
the aid of foreign energy tends toward the production of those bodies or
of that system of bodies which evolves the most heat.” Thus he shows
that for the metals K, Na, Ca, Sr, Mg, Mn, Fe” Zn, Cd, Pb, (Cu2)”
Hg,” Ag and (Al,)“, less heat results from the formation of oxides, than
from the formation of chlorides. Hence gaseous chlorine should decom-
pose these oxides, producing chlorides and evolving oxygen. This, in
fact, actually takes place provided the reaction is initiated by suitably
raising the temperature.—(J. Phys., viii, 402, December, 1879.)

INORGANIC.

Dumas has studied the property of occluding hydrogen possessed by
certain metals, and finds that aluminum may occlude as much as one
and a half times its volume of this gas, as well as traces of carbon
dioxide. These gases were given out again when the metal was heated
to redness in an exhausted tube. Magnesium exhibits a similar be-
havior; so that to obtain these metals pure, they should be distilled in
vacuo. These observations may throw some light on the anomalous
behavior of aluminum when used as an electrode in the voltameter.—
(Nature, xxii, 89, May, 1880.)

Morley has made a series of careful analyses of air in order to ascer-
tain the limits of the variation of the oxygen in a single locality. On
292 CHEMISTRY.

Loomis’s theory that sudden depressions of temperature are caused by
the vertical descent of cold air from the higher portions of the atmos-
phere, the author conceived that such air might well contain a smaller
proportion of oxygen than the average. In preparation for testing the
question, he has made a number of experiments with apparatus specially
constructed. In proof of its accuracy, he states that the probable error
of a determination of oxygen in the air, is the 7200th part; and the prob-
able difference of two determinations on the same sample is the 5200th
part. The air analyzed was taken in the open country during Decem-
ber, 1878, and January and February, March and April, 1879. The mini-
mum of oxygen observed was found in a sample taken on the 26th of
February, when it was 20.45 and 20.50 in two experiments. The maxi-
mum occurred in air taken on the 28th of December, 20.98 and 20.96 in
two analyses.—(Am. J. Sci., IL, xviii, 168, September, 1879.)

Boussingault has investigated the production of oxygen from barium
dioxide under diminished pressure, and shows that in a vacuum this sub-
stance parts with oxygen ata low red heat. Conversely at about the
same temperature, but at ordinary pressures, oxygen is readily absorbed
again from the atmosphere by the lower oxide. Barium oxide may be
successfully employed, therefore, on the large scale for obtaining pure
oxygen from the atmosphere. The difficulty hitherto experienced was
the fact that at the high temperature necessary to decompose the dioxide
under ordinary pressures, some molecular change took place which
diminished largely its power of absorption.—(Ann. Chim. Phys., V, xix,
464, April, 1880.)

Hautefeuille and Chappuis have announced to the French Academy
the liquefaction of ozone. By the use of a very low temperature they
have succeeded in producing from oxygen, by the silent electric discharge,
a greater quantity of ozone than hitherto, this at —23° C. being 21 per
cent. The ozonized oxygen was conducted into the cool tube of a Cail-
letet’s apparatus and pressure applied. After a few strokes of the pump
the gas appeared azure blue in color, which increased with the pressure
to dark indigo blue. On suddenly expanding the gas under 95 atmos-
pheres pressure, a mist appeared in the tube, indicating liquefaction.—
(Nature, xxii, 560, October, 1880.)

Ogier has succeeded in effecting the combination of hydrogen chlo-
ride and hydrogen phosphide gases by compressing them together in a
Cailletet’s apparatus. When equal volumes of these two gases were com-
_ pressed by a pressure of 14 atmospheres at 14°, combination took place
and small yellow crystals, very brilliant, appeared in the tube. If the
proportion had been accurately made and the gases were pure, they
disappeared entirely, the walls of the tube being covered with the crystals
with no traceof liquid. If, however, the upper part of the tube be warmed
with hot water to 20°, a liquid layer appears. If now the tube be cooled
slowly, maintaining the pressure at 60 to 70 atmospheres, a point is
reached when combination takes place and crystals are formed. A
CHEMISTRY. 293

partial vacuum is produced in the tube and the mercury rises. The
liguid may also be obtained by a sudden compression and the solid by
a sudden expansion, producing sufficient cold.—(J. Phys., ix, 386, Novem-
ber, 1880.)

Maskelyne has examined two samples of material said to be erystal-
lized carbon or diamond sand. The first was sent him by Mactear of
Glasgow. On testing it he found (a) that it would not scratch either
sapphire or topaz; (0) the particles polarized light; and (c) were not com-
bustible, hence the sample was not diamond dust. Since evaporation
with hydrofluoric acid caused it to disappear, it was probably a silicate.
The second sample came from Hannay, also of Glasgow, and consisted
of small crysiallized particles, which in luster, in lamellar structure
on the cleavage surfaces, and in refractive power, presented exactly
the appearance of fragments of a broken diamond. They were inert in
polarized light, they easily scored deep grooves in sapphire, and they
were combustible, burning away entirely on platinum foil. The angle
between the cleavage faces was 70° 29’, that of the diamond being 70°
31’.7. Hannay has himself given an account of the production of these
diamonds, in a paper read before the Royal Society by Professor Stokes.
This result is an outcome of his remarkable research on the solubility
of solids in gases. He observed that when a gas containing carbon and
hydrogen was heated under pressure in presence of certain metals, its hy-
drogen istaken by the metal, and itscarbonis setfree. Ifthis evolution of
carbon takes place in presence of a stable compound containing nitrogen
at a red heat and under a very high pressure, the carbon is obtained in
the clear transparent form of the diamond. The specific gravity of the
crystals is 3.5, and they yield on combustion 97.85 per cent. of carbon.
An iron tube 4 inches in diameier and half an inch bore was exhibited
as one of the tubes used in the experiment. These tubes burst in nine
cases out of ten.—( Nature, xxi, 203, 260, 404, 421, 426, 1879~S80.)

Cooke has made additional experiments in support of his early result
which fixed the atomic weight of antimony at 120.00; a result obtained
as a mean of fifteen analyses of five different preparations of antimony
bromide. In the present paper he discusses the causes of error to which
his previous method was liable, and concludes that they arise from the
analytical process, and not from a want of purity of material; and fur-
ther that they are to agreat extent under control. He then details the
Tesulits of experiments made with the volumetric method, by precipitat-
ing a known weight of antimonous bromide by a standard solution of
pure silver. As a mean of five analyses, the percentage of bromine
found was 66.6651, against 66.6665 given by the fifteen previous anal-
yses, corresponding to an atomic weight of 120.01. The silver bromide
formed in the last two experiments, on drying and weighing, gave two ad-
ditional determinations—120.01 and 120.00.—( Am. J. Sci., II, xix, 382,
May, 1880.)

of new metallic elements, of which fourteen have been added to the list
in about two years, eleven of these belonging, it is said, to the yttrium

ORGANIC.

Thomsen, in a paper presented to the Berlin Chemical Society, has
attempted to base a general theory of the structure of carbon compounds
on thermal determinations. He does this by measuring (indirectly of
course) the heat of dissociation of the carbon molecule, and from this
and other data finding a thermal value for the combination of two car-
bon atoms, to form a gaseous compound, by four “links,” by three, by
two, or by one. He thence deduces a thermal value for each link. Gen-
eral equations are given for calculating the heats of formation of various
isomers, assuming a certain linking of the atoms for each. In cases
where various linkings may be assumed, a determination of the heat of
formation may determine which linking, and therefore which structural
formula, is the more probable.—(Ber. Berl. Chem. Ges., xiii, 1388, 1392,
July, 1880; Nature, xxii, 542, October, 1880.)

Beilstein and Kurbatow have examined the more volatile portions of
the petroleum of Baku in the Caucasus, with a view of comparing them
with the corresponding portions of American petroleum. It had been
observed that for the same boiling point the Caucasus fractions had a
greater specific gravity. Hence a distrust of these Caucasus illuminat-
ing oils, until it was shown that they had an illuminating power 10 per
cent. higher than the American. The fractions obtained by the authors
were: one boiling below 80°, with a gravity of 0.717; one from 80° to
85°, 0.733; one from 85° to 90°, 0.741; one from 90° to 95°, 0.745; one
from 95° to 100°, 0.748; and one from 100° to 105°, 0.752. Below 80°
American petroleum yields hexane of gravity 0.669, while between 95°
and 100° it gives heptane of gravity 0.699. To ascertain the cause of
this difference the 80° to 85° fraction was agitated with fuming sulphuric
acid; but no aromatic hydrocarbons were thus detected. Since analysis
gives the formula C, Hp,, the fraction was examined for the olefines
with bromine; but no action took place in the cold. On further study
it appeared that these hydrocarbons belonged to a series obtained by
hex-hydrogenating the aromatic hydrocarbons, the first member of which
is hexahydrobenzene. Subsequent investigation showed the same series
to be present in American petroleum, though in much smaller amount.—

Vincent and Delachanal have determined the density and the expan-
sion coefficient of methyl chloride at various temperatures. For this
CHEMISTRY. 295

purpose they used a thermometric reservoir containing the liquid, which
with its stem was carefully calibrated. The density found varied very
regularly from 23°.7, where it was 0.99145, to 39°, with a value of
0.87886. The expansion coefficient: was found to increase with the
temperature, the ratio of the increase of the volume from ¢ to t+1 de-
grees, to the volume at ¢, being at —30°, 0.001310; at —0°, 0.001920 ;
at 40°, 0.002373.—(Ann. Chim. Phys., V, xvi, 427, 1879.)

Friedel and Ladenburg have continued their investigations upon or-
ganic compounds containing silicon in place of carbon, and have now
given the results of their study of the silico-ethyl series. Silicon, they
Say, acts in a group of carbon atoms like one of them, and nothing could
resemble a hydrocarbon more perfectly than do silicon-ethyl and silicon-
methyl. In their present paper they describe silicon hexaiodide Si, Ig,
silico-oxalic hydrate Hy, Siz O,, silicon hexethyl, Si, (C2 H5)., silicon hexa-
bromide Si, Brg, and silicon hexachloride Si, Cl. The latter has also
been obtained by Troost and Hautefeuille—(Ann. Chim. Phys., V, xix,
390, March, 1880.)

De Forcrand has studied the production of new ultramarines by re-
placing the sodium which is contained in the ordinary blue variety,
more or less completely by other metals and even by organic radicals.
Unger had obtained a green ultramarine in which half of the sodium
was replaced by silver ; and Heumann another, yellow in color, in which
this replacement was complete. When this latter body is heated dry with
a metallic or organie chloride, chloride of silver is formed and also a new
ultramarine. After treating of the production of the silver ultramarine
and the regeneration of the blue variety from it, and of the transformation
of the silver body into ultramarines of potassium and rubidium, green-
ish blue, of lithium, blue, of barium, yellowish brown, of zine, violet, and
of magnesium, gray, the author proceeds to describe the formation and
properties of organic ultramarines. When the silver compound is
heated with ethyl iodide, a gray slightly reddish body is obtained, which
heated with sodium chloride gives ethyl chloride and blue ultramarine.
It was therefore an ethyl-ultramarine. Similar ultramarines were ob-
tained with the radicals allyl, amyl, and benzyl, and even with the
quaternary ammoniums triethyl-phenyl-ammonium and tetramethyl-am-
monium.—(Ann. Chim. Phys., V, xvii, 559, August, 1879.)

Cooke has described a double tartrate analogous to tartar emetic, in
which the potassium is replaced by silver, and which he calls therefore
silver emetic, or argento-antimonious tartrate. Although previously
observed, its properties have been only incompletely examined since it
Was in an amorphous condition. It is more soluble in water than at
first supposed, requiring one hundred parts of boiling water and less
than five hundred parts of water at 15° C. for its solution. Hence by
dissolving in boiling water and allowing the solution to cool, colorless
brilliant crystals were obtained belonging to the orthorhombic system.
They blacken on exposure to light, and decompose at 200° with slight

explosion, leaving spangles of metallic silver mixed with an amorphous
powder of antimonous oxide. It contained 26.30 per cent. of silver.—
(Am. J. Sei., II, xix, 393, May, 1880.)

Grimaux and Adam have succeeded in effecting the synthesis of citric
acid from glycerin. Since glycerin is tri-hydroxyl-propane and citric
acid is hydroxyl-tri-carboxyl-propane, the theoretical conversion of the
former into the latter requires only the substitution of three carboxyls
for two hydroxyls and one hydrogen. Practically, this replacement
was effected in several stages: first, by the action of hydrochloric acid
on glycerin, dichlorhydrin, or hydroxyl-dichlor-propane, was produced.
By chromic acid this was oxidized to dichloracetone or oxydichlor-
propane. This, by the action of concentrated hydrocyanie acid, gave
dichloracetone-cyanhydrin, or hydroxyl-cyan-dichlor-propane. By sa-
ponifying with hydrochloric acid, the corresponding acid hydroxyl-
carboxyl-dichlor-propane was obtained. The sodium salt of this was
treated with potassium cyanide, giving hydroxyl-carboxyl-dicyan-pro-
pane. And this, when saponified as before, gave hydroxyl-tricarboxyl-
propane, or citric acid, identical in all its properties with that obtained
from lemons. Since giycerin can be made from trichlorhydrin, which
may be made by the action of chlorine on propylene, and since propy-
lene can be made from marsh gas and carbonous oxide, marsh gas itself
being producible from carbon and hydrogen, the synthesis is complete
from the simple elements up to citric acid.—( Nature, xxii, 585, October,
1880.)

Rosenstiehl has given the processes by which Baeyer has succeeded
in synthesizing indigotin, the coloring matter of indigo. Two of these
are described, in both of which cinnamie acid is taken as the point of
departure. On nitration, this acid yields orthonitro-cinnamic acid; and
this is converted (a) into orthonitro-phenyl-propiolic acid by bromi-
nating and subsequently saponifying; or (b) into orthonitro-phenyl-
oxyacrylic acid by treatment with hypochlorous acid and subsequent
saponification. The action of heat alone converts this latter acid into
indigotin, a temperature of 110° C. being sufficient. But the action is
complex and the yield is small. Orthonitro-phenyl-propiolic acid is con-
verted into indigotin by heating it with a mixture of alkali carbonate
and glucose, to 110° C. The action is regular, the indigotin separates
in the crystalline form, and the process has the very great commercial
advantage that the coloring matter can be developed directly on the
cloth. The mixture of the acid with the alkali and glucose being
printed on the cloth, exposure to superheated steam develops the color
fixed in the fiber.—(Ann. Chim. Phys., xxi, 286, October, 1880.)

Spiller has devised a simple means of identifying the coal-tar colors,
founded on the action of sulphuric acid on the dyeing material taken in
conjunction with the shades produced on and the tendency to dye silk,
wool, or cotton. The most striking reactions are as follows: Magdala
red with sulphuric acid gives a blue-black; saffranin a grass-green, be-

coming indigo blue on strongly heating; chrysoidin deep orange, turn-
ing almost to scarlet on heating; alizarin, ruby-red or maroon; eosin,
golden-yellow; primrose (naphthalene yellow), first yellow then color
discharged; chrysaniline, brown fluorescence; aurin, yellowish brown;
atlas orange, rose-color, changing to scarlet on heating; atlas scarlet, no
alteration; biebrich scarlet (R), blue-black; ditto (B), blue-green; aniline
scarlet, permanent golden-yellow; indulin, slaty blue to indigo. All
violets give a yellow or brownish yellow; phenyl and diphenylamine
blues dark brown solutions; iodine and malachite greens bright yellow
solutions, the former giving off iodine on heating; and finally citronin,
which gives a pale cinnamon color or a neutral tint.—(Nature, xxii, 448,
September, 1880.)

Schiitzenberger has given in an elaborate memoir the results of his
investigations into the chemical character of albumen based on the ob-
servation that when subjected, under suitable conditions, to the action
of baryta water it breaks up entirely, or almost entirely, into definite
erystallizable principles. His results show that the mixture of fixed
principles derived from albumen by hydration contains only amido-de-
rivatives, and that these may be divided into two unequal portions;
one, about 16 or 18 per cent., containing substances in which the nitro-
gen ratio is 1:3, 1:4 or 2:5, mostly acids; and a second, four-fifths of the
residue, represented by the formula (C,,H2,N.0,),, the value for n being
a little less than nine. Albumen is therefore probably an imido-deriva-
tive, which changes by hydration into a mixture of amido-deriva-
tives.—(Ann. Chim. Phys. V, xvi, 289, March, 1879; J. Chem. Soc.,
xxxvi, 546, July, 1879.)
MINERALOGY.

By GEORGE W. Hawes, Ph. D.,

Curator in the National Museum.

It is unnecessary to state that in the past two years numerous con-
tributions have been made to our knowledge of the constituents of
the earth, for mineralogical study excites interest upon so many sides,
and is demanded for so many economic as well as scieitific purposes,
that the number of workers in this department is always sure to be large.
But it is of peculiar interest to note the number and the character of the
investigations which have been made in this country, and the attention
which they have excited at home and abroad. In looking over the list
of new species it will be seen that many of the most interesting have
been found here. ‘This is not strange, considering the rapid develop-
ment of our mining industries and the explorations that have been
made in unknown territories. But the finding of new minerals is not at
present the highest of mineralogical accomplishments, and a new name
is a burden and not an aid to science. A very different thing is such
study devoted to a new species as puts us in possession of new informa-
tion; and it is to the character of the new species and to the study
devoted to them that the prominence of American work during this
period is due.

We will therefore first consider the new discoveries that are purely
American, and then we will return to more general considerations.

AMERICAN PROGRESS.

Prof. E. S. Dana, in preparing a previous record of mineralogical pro-
gress, modestly refrained from assigning a prominent position to the
results of the explorations in Branchville, yet it may safely be said that
so fruitful a locality has for many years not been found in any land.
Up to the beginning of 1879 they had extracted five new species, but
since that time they have found two additional manganese phosphates,
making seven in all, and also a new and interesting lithium aluminum
silicate. In addition, many rare though previously described minerals
have been there found by them, and much interesting analytical work
has been done upon this material by Messrs. Penfield and Comstock.

These analyses have also suggested investigations that have resulted in
299
300 MINERALOGY.

a more certain determination of the formule of several species and to
the discovery of very interesting varieties of old ones. Mr. Comstock
analyzed the tantalite, which occurs at Branchville, together with im-
mense crystals of the rare columbite, and also analyzed and fixed the
formula of uraninite, which before had never been found in such fine
and fresh crystals, and of which, therefore, no material so suitable for
analysis had been found. Mr. Penfield reached also as interesting re-
sults in his analyses of triphyllite and amblygonite, and also analyzed
a novel variety of apatite which was found to contain a large amount of
manganese. Profs. Brush and Dana have once more demonstrated the
economic value of scientific industry. Their new minerals were found in
avery coarse-grained vein of pegmatite. They also found there immense
crystals of potash feldspar of the variety microcline, also masses of clear,
pure quartz. Having extracted many tons of these materials as waste
products in their search for the rare minerals, they took occasion to call —
the attention of a porcelain manufacturer to it, and he found on trial
that the feldspar was eminently suited for the manufacture of his —
wares, aS was also the quartz. He therefore purchased the property,
and these materials have been systematically and extensively extracted
ever since.

Profs. Brush and Dana have made another most important discovery,
fully equal in interest to their discovery of new species, since by means
of it they have perfected our knowledge of a species previously little
understood. The calcium borosilicate danburite was discovered many —
years ago by Prof. C. U. Shepard, though its chemical composition was _
subsequently first correctly determined by Profs. J. L. Smith and
Brush. Yet so small and imperfect were the grains then found that its
mode of erystallization was never known, or at least its form could not
be correctly determined. It was thought to be triclinic. Through the
discovery of these gentlemen all the cabinets of the world are, or will be,
enriched with large and beautifully crystallized specimens of this hereto-
fore rare and insignificant species. The new locality is in Russell, New
York, where danburite occurs in large, compact, rock-like masses and fine
crystals of perfect form. The little crystals are white and transparent,
and the large ones are also very perfectly formed. They are rhombic
in form, and, what is most remarkable, although it possesses no appar-
ent chemical affinity with topaz, its crystals are so deceptively like it
that no one would hesitate to pronounce it topaz from its outward ap-
pearance. This resemblance extends yet further; its axes are very
nearly identical in length, and its optical properties are nearly the
same as in topaz. Other cases of close resemblance in form between
unrelated chemical compounds are known. Calcite resembles soda nitre,
for example, and aragonite resembles saltpeter. Such resemblances of
the present time can only be explained as being the accidental resem-
blances, like those of facesinacrowd. But the fact that this borosilicate
resembles topaz even in the minute details of arrangement of its crystal-

eS a a
MINERALOGY. 301

line planes, indicates that we have perhaps much yet to learn concern-
ing isomorphism.

One of the most interesting studies of this period has been made upon
the lithium aluminum silicate spodumene and the products of its alter-
ations. Mr. Alexis A. Julien, of Columbia College, first examined the
specimens that he obtained in Massachusetts. Spodumene, by the action
of decomposing reagents in nature, exchanges its lithia for potash or
soda, and becomes altered into a variety of substances, one of the most
characteristic of which has been called cymatolite. Mr. Julien analyzed
this substance and endeavored to fix its composition. But at Branch-
ville, Profs. Brush and Dana found immense crystals which were origi-
nally all of spodumene, and which had decomposed in such a way as to
enable them to make a most interesting investigation and arrive at new
results. These crystals were of very great dimensions, some being over
four feet long and a foot wide. Their interiors were still of a beautiful
clear pink spodumene, but they were mostly altered into mica, albite,
eymatolite, and a translucent substance which they provisionally called
@ spodumene. By chemical and microscopic study they demonstrated
that this so-called cymatolite was composed of a very intimate mixture
of white mica and albite, and that the @ spodumene was composed of
albite and a new mineral, which they have called eucryptite, and which
will be found deseribed beyond. The study of such processes of altera-
tion is very important, since it develops facts of geological importance,
and the changes which this spodumene has undergone form an inter-
esting chapter in the history of pseudomorphs.

Mr. Harrington, of Montreal, has made an important study of the apa-
tites and their associated minerals in Canada. As is well known, very
large deposits of clear green and otherwise colored apatite occur there
from which very large quantities are annually taken to be crushed and
manufactured into superphosphates for agricultural purposes. Such
deposits also occur in Norway, where they have been studied by Pro-
fessors Brégger and Reusch, who determined them to be of eruptive
origin. Professor Harrington, after showing that they occur in rocks of
a similar nature, though unlike in detail, shows that there is abundant
reason for considering that they are not eruptive rocks, and thinks that
they were gathered by and crystallized from solutions. I will recall in
this connection that M. Daubrée made apatite in a closed tube, by
causing a volatile phosphorous compound to act upon hot limestone,
and he thinks that some such deposits may have been formed by subli-
mation. The opinion of Dr. Harrington is sustained by the previously-
formed opinion of Dr. Hunt, and it will be seen that every possible mode
of origin has to-day weighty opinion in its favor. But argument of
such questions is progress, and is along step toward conclusion, and
these studies have contributed much to our knowledge of these deposits.
Mr. Harrington describes immense crystals of apatite a foot or more in
diameter and several feet long. Mr. Adams and Mr. Hofmann have
302 MINERALOGY.

also been busy analyzing Canadian minerals. Very interesting are
the analyses of scapolites by Mr. Adams. He found them. all to con-
tain chlorine, the overlooking of which was probably the cause of the
evident errors of previous analyses.

The relationship in which hornblende and pyroxene stand to each
other has always been a favorite subject. Although each species has
numerous varieties of very variable composition, each possesses the
same chemical varieties, and they are therefore considered as dimorphous.
Moreover there is a very definite relationship between their forms, since
doubling the length of one axis in pyroxene gives the axes of hornblende.
Another feature that has attracted much interest is that pyroxene tends
to alter its own internal molecular structure into that of hornblende.
This results in giving us quite perfect crystals apparently pyroxene,
but which possess the cleavage and optical properties of the allied spe-
cies. Since the two species may be identical in composition, this has
usually been spoken of as a case of paramorphism, of which we have
some other illustrations. Calcium carbonate crystallized as aragonite
can, for example, be internally altered to calcite, which change involves
no chemical alteration. But Mr. Harrington among the apatite deposits
has succeeded in finding pyroxene crystals in which this process of alter-
ation was in progress, and in some cases had progressed to that extent
that the crystals were internally pyroxene and externally of horn-
blende. Analyses of the materials in all cases showed that a chemical
change had taken place, which was largely expressed in a loss of lime.
In other words, the pyroxene was changed, not into a hornblende of a
like composition, but a hornblende of different composition. Pyroxene
crystals altered into hornblende have been called tiralite, because first
brought from the Urals by Gustav Rose. Professor Harrington’s analy-
ses demonstrate that his crystals are to be considered as pseudomorphs,
and not as paramorphs.

Mr. Hidden has been seeking minerals in the Southern States.
Among others he has found some very beautiful, transparent, green
crystals of spodumene, which are a novelty and an interesting addition
to the varieties of this species. Some immense crystals of sphene,
weighing fifty pounds or more, have been brought from Renfrew, in
Canada. Dr. Shepard has bought the celebrated Graves Mountain,
Georgia, and has mined from it great numbers of very large and very
beautiful rutile crystals; and the shelves of the mineral dealers will be
found enriched with a great deal of material from new localities that
have been developed during the past two years.

Meteorites.—When one remembers how very few are the meteorites
that have been seen to fall and have then been found, and the general
and keen interest felt by the whole scientific world in these celestial
bodies, the very remarkable fall of meteorites that took place in our
country last year must be considered as an important event. Most of the

MINERALOGY. 303

meteorites thus far found possess thoroughly individual characteristics ;
therefore each new discovery of a meteorite is met with the expectation
of some new information regarding the composition and history of other
worlds than ours. This new meteorite was thoroughly unique in its
general character and brought to us a mineral which was heretofore
unknown.
| In Emmett County, Lowa, on the 10th of May, 1879, at five o’clock in
_ the afternoon, although the sun was still shining and the day clear, a
large meteorite was seen to pass across the sky. One person saw it at
a distance of one hundred miles from the place of its fall. It is said to
have made a noise “terrible and indescribable,” which was louder than
| that of artillery, and which frightened the cattle as much as the people.
One piece, five hundred pounds in weight, struck the earth at such a
velocity that it buried itself fourteen feet in a stiff clay soil. A second
piece, weighing one hundred and seventy pounds, and a third, weighing
one hundred and forty pounds, were found in the neighborhood. More-
over, the prairie far and near was scattered with little pieces, hundreds
of which were gathered. One remembers in this connection the multi-
tude of little meteorites which fell at Pultusk, one or more of which are
in every collection. The largest of the pieces of this Emmett County
meteorite was sold for a great sum to the British Museum;* the second
piece remained in the Iowa University collection, and the third was
purchased by Yale College. The circumstances of the fall of this me-
teorite were first described by Professor Peckham, and Dr. J. Lawrence
Smith afterward submitted it to careful investigation in the laboratory,
and found it to contain a new magnesium iron silicate, which he named
Peckhamite. The other constituents were chiefly metallic iron and
olivine, which are common constituents of meteorites, but this meteorite
was characterized by the great size of its olivine grains. It is partly on
account of such large crystals that it is commonly believed that these
meteorites once formed parts of greater bodies, from which they have
been broken. The history of Biela’s comet will be remembered in this
connection, which on one of its periodic appearances was found to have
divided, and which subsequently finally disappeared from the sky,
though a meteoric shower occurred at about the time that it should
have appeared.

Mr. Hidden has also found some interesting meteoric irons in the
South. One of these was plowed out of the ground in Cleburne
County, Alabama, in 1873. Though the circumstance of its being
metallic iron excited the curiosity of the people, no one considered it
as anything of value. A piece of it was forged into a tool, and the
rest lay for years in the blacksmith shop, unknown and unappreciated.
It kas now been investigated by Dr. J. Lawrence Smith, who has done
so much in the chemical study of these bodies.

Another block of meteoric iron weighing 120 pounds has been found

*We should have a fund to keep such interesting things in this country.

304 MINERALOGY.

at Ivanpah, Cal., by Mr. 8. Goddard. It has been partially described
by Prof. C. U. Shepard, and is in the possession of Mr. Hanks, the
State geologist of California.

It is known that etched surfaces of meteoric irons exhibit definite
figures resultant from the crystallization of the iron, and which not
appearing upon surfaces of common iron have been considered as char-
acteristic of meteoric iron. Mr. Daubreé, and afterward Meunier,
succeeded in obtaining such figures on nickeliferous iron, and now Dr.
J. Lawrence Smith has succeeded in inducing like figures upon polished
surfaces of iron containing silicon. Add to this the circumstance that
the same happens when the Ovifak iron, which is now generally ad-
mitted to be terrestrial, is treated, and it can scarcely be claimed any
longer that these figures are alone characteristic of meteoric irons.

NEW MINERALS.

We will now refer briefly to the new minerals that have been de-
seribed. We think it will be seen that, if a few minerals should be struck
from this list, this portion might be left out of a report upon progress,
for many of these new minerals are described more for the zeal for nam-
ing than for any information of interest that their study has developed.

Abriachantite.—An impure, bluish clay, like mineral, named by Heddle
after the locality where it is found in Scotland. A name given to a
poorly identified species.

Animikite—A very basic silver antimonide found by H. Wurtz at Silver
Islet, in Lake Superior. Its name is derived from animikie, which
means thunder; whence Thunder Bay derives its name. It is not
established as a species.

Bernardinite—A new mineral resin found by J. M. Stillman, in San
Bernardino County, California. It is white im color, and so porous
and light that it will float on water. A new resin has also been
described by C. Doélter in the communications of the Steinmark natural
history society. It was found by him in the tertiary lignites.

Bhreckite—A. substance found by Heddle at Ben Bhreck, in Sutherland,
Scotland. A calcareous chlorite like mineral of undetermined com-
position. Named on account of the possibility that it might prove
new.

Eggonite.—Probably a cadmium silicate, which is found in minute light
brown crystals on calamine at Altenberg, near Aix-la-Chapelle. It
was described by Schrauf, who determined it to be triclinic, but he
did not definitely decide its composition.

Hlenorite—An hydrous iron phosphate, found by A. Nies in the Ele-
nore mine, near Giessen. It is rhombic, dark brown, translucent, and
vitreous in luster. Its investigation is, however, still incomplete.

Eucryptite—A lithium aluminum silicate, discovered by Brush and
Dana, at Branchville, Conn. It is intimately intermingled with
albite, forming what they call @ spodumene. The two minerals are

I
‘

ee ee ee
MINERALOGY. _ 305

arranged with reference to one another as are quartz and feldspar in
schrift granite, and, as in this case the mineral intermingled with
the feldspar is hexagonal. *In composition it is somewhat related
to muscovite or nephelin. It is white and fibrous, and only detected
by microscopic examination. Named from <3, well, and zpuzzds, con-
cealed.

Huralite—A dark-green chloritic substance, resembling delessite, and
found by F. J. Wiik, at Eura Kirchspiel, Finland.

Fairfieldite—An hydrous manganese calcium phosphate, found by Brush
and Dana, at Branchville, in Fairfield County, Connecticut. It is a
colorless and transparent mineral with a good cleavage, and triclinic
in crystallization.

Fillowite—A mineral found by Brush and Dana at Branchville, and
named after the owner of the property on whose land they explored.
Occurs in granular and crystalline grains, the latter looking like
rhombohedrons but really monoclinic in form. It is a manganese
phosphate containing a little iron and soda, and of a wax-yellow color.

Fredricite—A wineral related to tetrahedrite, but contains lead and
tin. It is found in massive, iron-black pieces, at the Faln mine,
Sweden, and is chiefly composed of copper, sulphur, and arsenic.
Described by Hj. Sjogren.

Gelatinous chabazite.—Renevier found a gelatinous substance in fissures
in the conglomerate near Lausanne, Switzerland, that had the com-
position of chabazite. He called it a mineral in embryonic condition.
This was inappropriate, because no such condition is possible in the
organic kingdom. A mineral is complete as soon as formed, and
its crystalline condition 1s one of its essential properties. This is a
new mineral if its composition is definite.

Guejarite—A copper antimony sulphide, found by M. E. Cumenge in a
vein of spathic iron, at Guejar, in the Spanish Sierra Nevadas. Oc-
curs in bright crystalline plates, that are sometimes quite large. It
is quite heavy, is steel-gray in color, and of rhombic crystallization.

Hannayite—A hydrous magnesium ammonium phosphate found in the
guano beds at Victoria. It was determined and named by vom Rath,
and found to be triclinic in crystallization.

Haughtonite.—A black mica, which was taken out of gneiss from Roneval,
and analyzed by Heddle. It is intermediate between biotite and lepi-
domelane, and consequently scarcely needs any new name.

Heldburgite—Another mineral of unknown composition, but possessing
angles like those of Zircon. It is a yellow mineral seen in the feldspar
of phonolite from Heldburg in Colburg, by O. Luedecke.

Herrengrundite—A basic copper sulphate from Herrengrund, Hungary.
Occurs in six-sided tabular crystals of the monoclinic system. In
color it is dark emerald green. Occurs mixed with gypsum, malachite,
and calcite. (See urvolgyrite.)

S. Mis. 31——20

Hofmannite.—A. colorless, tasteless hydrocarbon, found in tabular erys-
tals.on lignite. Deseribed by Bechi.

Huntilite—A mineral named by Henry Wurtz after Dr. T. Sterry Hunt.
It is a basic silver arsenide, but poorly determined. Found at Silver
Islet, Lake Superior.

Koflachite.—This is a kind of mineral pitch or resin, found by C. Doelter
near Koflach. The author names it with doubt, and says it is very
near Jauiingite, another resin found at the same place.

Leucomanganite.—A foliated, radiated, saow-white mineral, composed of
manganese and iron protoxides, alkali, and water in unknown pro-
portions. Named by Sandberger.

Lintonite—An hydrous calcium aluminum sodium silicate, closely allied,
perhaps, identical, with thompxonite, which was found in amygda-
loidal cavities in diabase near Grand Marias, Cook County, Minnesota.
Named after Miss Laura Linten, the analyst of the specimens.

Louisite.—A leek-green translucent vitreous brittle mineral found by D.
Honeyman, at Blomidon, Nova Scotia, and named from the princess,
It is an hydrous lime potash silicate.

Luckite—An hydrous manganese iron sulphate, found with mallardite
in the Luckyboy silver mine, Butterfield Canon, Utah. It is clear.
with a bluish tint; found in indistinct striated prisms in a black bitu-
minous rock, isomorphous with melanterite, from which it differs in
the presence of manganese. Described by A. Carnot.

Mallardite—An hydrous manganese sulphate, soluble in water, de-
scribed by A. Carnot, from the Luckyboy silver mine, Butterfield
Cafion, Utah. It occurs in colorless fibrous erystals in a gray clay
like stone, together with quartz and barite.

Mixite.—A copper bismuth arsenate containing water. It is found as
an emerald or bluish-green incrustation on bismuth ochre. It forms
spherical and reniform aggregations, and granular irregular par-
ticles. Found in the Joachimsthal, and determined by A. Schrauf.

Newberyite.—Another mineral found by vom Rath in the Victoria guano
beds; it is a magnesium phosphate containing water, and orthorhom-
bic in crystallization.

Ontariolite.—An “ embryonic” mineral, named before its investigation by
Prof. C. U. Shepard. Itis a member of the scapolite family, found at
Ottawa, Canada.

Orizite—A mineral of the composition of heulandite found in the tour-
maline granite at San Piero in Campo, by Grattarola. It oceurs in
crystals, and crystalline grains of the color and luster of rice kernels.

Peckhamite.—A magnesium iron silicate found by Dr. J. Lawrence
Smith in the meteorite that fell in Emmet County, Iowa. It is dingy-
yellow in color, has a perfect cleavage, and occurs in nodules several
millimeters in diameter. It is intermediate between olivine and bron-
zite. Named after Professor Peckham, who first described the fall of
this remarkable meteorite (see Jeteorites).

Philadelphite—A mineral found in a decomposing hornblendic gneiss
on Germantown Avenue, Philadelphia. In composition and properties
related to vermiculite. A pearly micaceous mineral, which exfoliates
when heated to ten times its original volume. Described by Henry CU.
Lewis, of Philadelphia.

Phosphuranylite—A pulverulent incrustation found on quartz and feld-
spar, of a pearly luster, and lemon-yellow color, and determined by
IF. A. Genth to be a hydrous nranium phosphate. .

Picite.—A hydrous iron phosphate which like the Elenorite, before
mentioned, is found in a mine near Giessen. It is amorphous dark
brown translucent, and has a fatty luster. It occurs in little stalac-
tites, and spherical concretions, or in coats on other minerals.

Plagiocitrite Klinophaite and Wattevillite, are some hydrous sulphates
found by 8S. Singer on the Bauersberg near Bischofsheim, on the
Rhone. They resulted from reactions between the decomposing pyrites
in some lignite beds, and an underlying basalt, or the tuff mixed with
the lignite. They remain to be further investigated.

Pseudonatrolite—A new zeolite described by Grattarola from San Piero
in Campo. It is found in minute colorless crystals with a glassy
pearly luster, and probably orthorhombic in crystallization. It is a
calcium aluminum silicate, and named from its relation to natrolite.

Randite.—A lemon-yellow incrustation found on granite and determined
to be a calcium uranium carbonate, near lebigite in composition.
Named for T. D. Rand of Philadelphia by G. A. Koenig.

Reinite.—A pure iron tungstate, discovered by Professor Rein in Kim-
bosan, Japan, and investigated by K. von Fritsch and Luedecke. It
is a black-brown opaque substance; found in large square crystals
assumed by analogy to be monoclinic.

Thaumasite—A white translucent mineral, from Aareskutan, described
by G. Lindstrom, with fatty glance, and choncoidal fracture. It is
an hydrous lime carbonate, sulphate, and silicate. One would think
it a mixture, but several analyses exactly agree, and Térnebohm, a
careful analyst, is assured that it is no mixture. One will remember
cancrinite, which is a silicate and carbonate. This mineral is justly
named from #avyatw, to wonder.

Titanomorphite.—The gray translucent substance which is so very fre-
quently found in microscopic sections of rocks as a decomposition prod-
uct of titanic iron and rutile, has been the subject of much discussion.
It has never been found practical to separate it and analyze it, hence
its composition has always been a subject of speculation; von Lasaulx
found masses in an amphibolite, from Hohe Eule, of sufficient size to
analyze. He fixed its composition as a calcium titanate, identical
with perowskite. The substance previously had two or three names,
and was best known as leucoxene, a name given by Giimbel. It was
scarcely necessary to give it another.
Trippkeite—A copper arsenite from Chili, the composition of which
was determined by A. Damour, and the crystallographic properties
by G. vom Rath. It is a quadratic mineral, the optical proof of which
was furnished by Des Cloizeaux. It was named for Dr. Paul Tripkie,
a mineralogist in Bonn, who was unfortunately killed shortly after he
had found this mineral, which he suspected to be new.

Tysonite—A mineral found by Messrs. Tyson and Wood, on Pike’s
Peak. It was found by Prof. O. D. Allen and Mr. W. J. Comstock
to be a fluoride of the rare earths cerium lanthanum and didymium.
It is a hexagonal mineral of vitreous and wax-yellow color, and very
heavy. It was named from the finder.

Urisite—An hydrous iron sulphate, containing soda, described by A.
Frenzel. It has a citron or pomegranate yellow color, and occurs in
rhombic erystals. It was obtained in the Caucasus.

Urvolgyite.—This is the same thing as. the Herren grundite described by
Brezina. This name was given by Szabo, but the lime which Brezina
found resulted from an intermixture of gypsum, Szabo considered to
be an essential constituent.

Xantholite—Another of Heddle’s possibly new minerals. Found at Loch
Ness, Scotland. Like grenatite, but of different color. A poorly de-
termined species.

308 MINERALOGY.

IMPORTANT STUDIES.

It will be noticed that many of the new studies have consisted in the
continued application of the later-developed optical methods to pre-
viously-determined species. This is because the ideas which constitute
a crystal have been changed, thus necessitating a reinvestigation of all
minerals. One sees no more in the new text books that a crystal is a
body bounded by planes symmetrically arranged by forces of ecrystal-
lization. But a erystal is a body with a defined molecular structure,
possessing like elasticity in like directions. The planes which may or
may not bound such a substance are simply one of the features of this
molecular structure, in the same way as are the optical, electric, mag-
netic, thermal, and other properties. The isonietric crystalline form
of a substance can be more perfectly established by the examination of
a pair of sections from an irregular fragment than from the outer form
of a developed geometrical form. Opaque substances only are investi-
gated in the same way as of old, and even these can be studied by thermal
methods. The degree of symmetry in crystals are considered as the
prominent features in geometrical study, and the crystalline axes, such
as are not assumed for simple convenience of calculation, are the nor-
mals to these planes, and not imaginery lines. These principles, which
have much simplified the science in some directions and complicated it
in others, are not new developments, but progress worthy of note has been
made in the more general acceptation of the new system and its intro-
duction into elementary instruction.

MINERALOGY. 309

Feldspar.—The study of the chemical relationships of the feldspars has
deeply interested mineralogists for several years. It will be recalled
that Tschermak, by a laborious investigation, attempted to systematize
all those kinds of feldspar of intermediate content of silica by a theory
of isomorphism of the extreme members of the group. This theory
was prevented from receiving general acceptation by the researches of
Des Cloizeaux, who gave definite optical properties for the oligoclase and
labradorite as well as the rest. But now Schuster, by a more extended
series of investigations, has been convinced that in optical as well as
other properties, all these intermediate species do form a regularly pro-
gressive series, such as might be expected to result from isomorphous
combinations. Many speculations have been made with the view of ex-
plaining how a lime alumina silicate like anorthite can be isomorphous
with potash or soda alumina silicates, which, like albite and microcline,
are of entirely different atomic ratio. The satisfactory understanding
of this is a thing to be determined when knowledge is further advanced.
The fact ofthe isomorphism is admitted, and the theory ofthe isomorphous
replacements to form intermediate feldspar species has gained ground.

The dimorphism of potash feldspar has been known for some time.
But it has proved to be quite surprising to find that the new species
microcline is on the whole much more abundant than the old species
orthoclase, which previously -embraced the whole. Microcline differs
but extremely little in geometrical form from orthoclase, but its optical
properties are very markedly different. It is composed of a series of
laminz most intricately interwoven, a result of twinning according to
two different systems. Now Levy has lately shown that if this system
of twinning, which is sometimes carried to such an extent that the indi-
vidual laminze become minutely microscopic, were only repeated still
further, and the laminz subdivided until even the microscope could not
detect them, such a microcline would have all the properties, optical
and otherwise, of orthoclase. In this he is supported by able French
mineralogists, and it would appear as if we were liable to lose the old
classic orthoclase altogether.

Other studies of twins.—A twinning plane becomes of necessity a plane
ot symmetry, and thus by simple repetition of this process very regular
bodies result from the least symmetrical. The process of reducing Well-
known minerals to less symmetrical systems has gone on as vigorously
as heretofore. For example, chabazite, which was considered as a most
typical rhombohedral mineral, has been shown by Becke to receive its
usual form by the repeated twinning of its triclinic crystals. Leucite,
which at the time of the last review had with general consent been re-
duced from the isometric to the quadratic system, has since been found
by Websky to be orthorhombic, and by others has been considered as
still less symmetrical. Perowskite and Boracite receive their apparent
isometric forms by the repeated twinning of rhombic crystals. Other
examples might be given, but these are suflicient to show what is being

7

done in these directions. The results of such studies, if of interest in
detail to but few (and they are treated with utmost detail), must not be
underestimated, for they tend toward a better understanding of molecu-
lar structure, a knowledge of which may at any time prove of utmost
interest to all.

Mica.—Prof. G. Tschermak, who, as is well known, has made a most
valuable investigation upon micas, the results of which proved that all
micas are monoclinic in form and that they possess variable optical
properties which necessitated a redivision and to a certain extent a new
nomenclature, has now, with the aid of Sepéez, extended his examina-
tion to the brittle micas of the clintonite group. These he finds also to
be monoclinic, and possessed of optical properties that make it possible
to systematize them in the same way as the elastic micas. Thus our
knowledge of a large number of minerals which before were very imper-
fectly understood has been much improved.

ARTIFICIAL MINERALS.

The synthetic methods of study have always found especial favor in
France. The impetus given by the men who have so distinguished
themselves in this way has in the past year brought forward a number
of new studies, almost all of them French.

Daubrée’s new book upon experimental geology contains an account
of all his previous experiments, and noticeable are the methods that he
has used to make sublimed minerals. The book is very interesting to
read, though its chief merit is the bringing together in condensed and
accessible form all the distributed writings of the author upon these
subjects.

Fouqué, who some time since succeeded in reproducing the feldspars
by the simple process of allowing fused mixtures to slowly cool, has by
the same process made leucite, nephelin, and a variety of rocks that
afte composed of minerals arranged in the same way, and scarcely dis-
tinguishable from volcanic products. These results both have a geolog-
ical interest, and are noticed in that section.

Fouqué and Levy performed the very pretty experiment of fusing
a mixture of scapolite and hornblende, and obtained by slow cooling
a mixture of labradorite and pyroxene. One recalls the old experiment
of Mitscherlich, who fifty years ago fused hornblende and obtained py-
roxene. One of the very interesting experiments of Fouqué and Levy
recently performed was that by which they produced feldspars of vari-
ous degrees of acidity, in which lead, baryta, or strontia were made to
take the place of the bases ordinarily found in them.

Velain has examined microscopically the fused ashes of grasses and
other plants, and found in them tridymite, anorthite, wollastonite, and
augite. Professor Maskelyn has described an artificial diopside rock
formed in a Bessemer steel converter. Liebethenite, the copper phos-
MINERALOGY. 311

phate, has been found to be very easily made by Friedel and Sarasin.
Scorodite, the iron arsenate, has been made by Verneuil and Bourgeois.
Hautefeuille has made leucite, also an iron leucite, that is one which
contains iron sesquioxide instead of the usual alumina. Meunier has
made enstatite, spinel, and corundum. This does not cover the whole
list, but it is sufficient to show the energy with which the synthetic
method is being pursued in France.

Some very interesting experiments have been tried in the way of pro-
ducing artificially some of the physical features of minerals. Calcite
has been noticed to be usually in the condition of polysynthetie twins
when in ordinary limestones, and it has been found that this twinned
structure can be induced in a simple crystal by pressing it in certain
directions. Baumhauer has shown how to make a perfect artificial twin
yet more simply. He takes his jackknife and presses its edge perpen-
dicularly into the pole edge of a rhomb near its apex. The parts dis-
placed by the jackknife then assume a position with reference to the
undisturbed parts as would a rhombohedron twinned with the next
more obtuse rhombohedral plane astwinning plane. One can thus easily
get a symmetrically formed twin with its re-entrant angle exactly like
the calculated angle of the twin. This is a beautiful little experiment
that any one can try in a moment for himself, but to understand its full
import and bearing is a deep problem.

Archeological Mineralogy.—Under the title of ‘‘ Nephrite and Jadeite,”
Prof. Heinrich Fischer has issued a volume which is the second that he
has devoted to a description of the results of his studies upon these and
other minerals, which in prehistoric times were cut into ornaments,
amulets, stone axes, &c. He has thus in a systematic manner 1tro-
duced the study of mineralogy into archeology. With the aid of the
microscope and all available scientific resources, he has endeavored {4
find the nature of the stones most prized by the ancients. His long:
continued studies show him that for an insufficiently understood reason,
they had a decided preference for green stones, which they brought
from most distant lands. The stones mostly obtained and modelled
were: green limestones, apatite, green quartz and serpentine, mica-
schist, chlorite schists, amazon stone (green feldspar), idocrase epidote,
hornblende, and pyroxyne; and particularly in Asia and New Zealand,
the very tough and hard nephrite and jadeite. It will never cease to
be a wonder how the ancients so beautifully cut and polished these hard
stones with their poor contrivances, and the archeologists will be thank-
ful to this eminent mineralogist who has so carefully determined the
mineral nature of so many of their objects of interest, and systematized
a great mass of their previously uninteresting material.

Other extensive works.—The fourteenth communication of Mr. W. G.
Hankel on the electric properties of minerals has already appeared.
He has demonstrated that all minerals possess poles and electric prop-
erties of one kind or another, and that the distribution of the electricity
By 17 MINERALOGY.

over the crystals is variable. He has not been able to deduce from his
studies any very complete system, and the results are therefore rather
wearisome in their details.

The optical properties of isomorphous mixtures have been studied by
Wyrouboff, and Mr. C. Délter has digested all the analyses of the min-
erals of the pyroxene family, and also studied their physical characters.
As a result he has given a classification of the varieties of this mineral,
which contains some improvements.

Mr. E. Mallard has issued the first volume of his treatise on geomet-
rical and physical crystallography, accompanied by an atlas of nine
plates. The completed work is to cover the field of mineralogy, and is
of much importance, since no very extensive general treatise on miner-
alogy has appeared in France since the time of Hauy.

Prof. J. Reinhard Blum, in his old age, has added a fourth supple-
ment to his work upon pseudomorphs. The better part of his life may
be said to have been devoted to this study. His work has become one
of the classics of mineralogy, and has had much influence in geology.
He evidently intends that so long as he lives his work shall be kept
abreast of the times. If heis not longer able to take part in the active
hard work that is being devoted to this subject, his new supplement
shows that nothing of importance escapes his attention or overtasks his
memory.

BOTANY.

By Pror. WILLIAM G. FARLOW.

PROGRESS IN 1879.

During the year 1879 publications on botany have been numerous in
all departments of the science, especially on the subjects of crypto-
gamic botany and vegetable physiology, but the number of works of large
extent and those which the Germans would describe as epoch-making
is comparatively small. The activity of the botanical world during the
year is shown, however, by the large numbers of papers containing either
the results of observations on detailed subjects in vegetable anatomy
and morphology, or in descriptions of new species, both of phanogams
and eryptogams. The proportion of valuable papers relating to the
effects of light on plants, to the physiological relations of the different
coloring matters, and to the action of the different forms of ferment is
also to be noticed.

GENERAL.

The Chronological History of Plants, or man’s record of his own ex-
istence, illustrated through their names, uses, and companionship, is <
quarto of over 1200 pages by the late Charles Pickering. It is an
immense collection of scattered facts about different common and culti-
vated plants, and the press-work is extraordinarily well done. Gray’s
Botanical Text-Book, Part 1, Structural Botany, now appears as one of
a series of three volumes, of which the second and third volumes are
to be devoted respectively to physiological botany and cryptogamic
botany. The part which has already appeared is modeled on the author’s
well-known Structural and Systematic Botany, but with much additional
matter. The first part of Luerssen’s Handbuch der Systematischen Bo-
tanik, intended especially for the use of medical students and apothe-
caries, is devoted to cryptogams, and both text and plates are excellent.
The Handbuch der Botanik, by Schenk, which forms a part of the Ency-
clopadie der Naturwissenschaften appeared in part in 1879, and contained
articles by Hermann Miiller on the Relations between Flowers and their

Crossing by means of Insects, and by Drude on Insectivorous Plants.

VEGETABLE ANATOMY AND PHYSIC LOGY.

An important paper by Pringsheim on the Action of Light and the
Function of Chlorophyl was communicated to the Berlin Academy in
July of this year. The paper is in the nature of a somewhat lengthy
preliminary communication which the writer intends to give in full with
illustrations in his Jahrbiicher. Pringsheim reports the discovery of a
substance, to which he gives the name of Hypochlorin or Hypochromyl,
which is obtained from chlorophyl-bearing tissues by allowing them to
remain in dilute hydrochloric acid for several hours. The Hypochlorin
then appears in the form of small, viscid drops or masses of semi-fluid
consistency, which ultimately are transformed into long, reddish-brown,
indistinctly crystalline needles. According to Pringsheim, he has proved
that chlorophyl, by its power of regulating plant-respiration in light by
- means of its absorption of the most active chemical rays, depresses the
amount of respiration in green plants exposed to the light below the
amount of assimilation, and so makes possible the accumulation of car-
bon-products and the persistence of the plant in the light. Hoppe-Seyler
has discovered a substance to which he gives the name of Chlorophyllan,
which has the form of dark green, velvety-looking plates, which are
curved and often united in rosettes. Gautier, in the Comptes Rendus,
regards the chlorophyllan of Hoppe-Seyler as crystallized chlorophyl
itself, and he claims for himself the priority of its discovery. The Helio-
tropic Phenomena of Plants is the title of a monograph by Wiesner, first
presented to the Vienna Academy in 1878, but not generally made public
until the present year.

The Annales des Sciences contain an article by Bonnier on nectaries,
and a copiously illustrated paper by Vesque, Sur le Sac Embryonnaire,
in which he supports the views of Warming as to the signification of the
embryo-sac, rather than the views of Strasburger. L. Koch, in his mono-
graph of the Development of the Crassulacee, gives a large number of
finely drawn plates of the microscopic structure of species of that order.
The mode of fertilization in Zostera marina has been studied by Engler,
who criticises unfavorably the views on the subject formerly held by
Hofmeister.

The American Naturalist contains a number of short papers on fertil-
ization, among which may be mentioned: Certain Contrivances for Cross-
fertilization in Flowers, by Prof. J. E. Todd ; On the Fertilization of several
species of Lobelia, by William Trelease ; The Fertilization of our native
species of Clitoria and Centrosema, also by Trelease ; and On the Fertili-
zation of Yucca, by Thomas Meehan, a paper read before the Am. Ass.
for the Advane. Science. In the Botanical Gazette are papers on Tri-
morphism in Lithospermum canescens, by E. F. Smith, and on Sexual differ-
entiation in Epigea repens, by L. F. Ward, and a note on the movement
of the stamens of Sabbatia angularis, by the same author. In the Am.
Journ. Science Prof. W. J. Beal describes his Experiments in Cross-breed-
SS

ing plants of the same variety, his conclusion being that the crossing is
highly favorable.
DISEASES OF PLANTS.

The coffee-leaf disease produced by Hemileia vastatrix is described
and illustrated in an article by R. Abbay in the Journ. Linn. Soc. In
Fungi Pomicoli, Von Thuemen gives a summary of the fungi which at-
tack the common fruit trees. A disease attacking seedling beech plants;
supposed to be caused by Phytophthora Fagi, and the distortions of spru-
ces produced by Nectria cucurbitula are described by Hartig in the Forst-
wiss. Centralblatt. Reinke and Berthold describe the manner in
which potatoes are decomposed by the action of fungi in the proceedings
of the botanical laboratory in Gottingen, and Thomas describes a large
number of galls produced in plants by different insects, in the Zeitschrift
fiir die gesammten Naturwissenschaften. A general treatise on Diseases
of cultivated plants produced by Fungi by Winter has appeared from
the press of Scholze, in Leipsic. The appearance in France of the onion
smut, Urocystis Cepule, well known in some parts of the United States,
has been recorded by Cornu, and the same botanist published several
communications on the disease of the vine known as anthracose, or, as it
is frequently called, anthrachnose. Planchon and Cornu do not agree
with regard to the fungus producing the disease in question, the former
thinking the fungus to be Sphaceloma ampelinum De Bary, and the
latter, Phoma uvicola Berk. and Curt. Under the title of Ampelomiceti
Ttalici, Spegazzini has continued his account of the fungi attacking
grapes in the Rivista della viticultura. In Die Pocken des Weinstockes
Von Thuemen gives his observations on Gleosporium ampelophagum, a
fungus which attacks grapes.

THALLOPHYTES.

Algw.—Of papers relating to the alge of the United States but
little can be said. The Bull. Torrey Club contains some new fresh-water
species by Wolle, and the Am. Naturalist contains a preliminary report
by Farlow on alge collected by Prof. A. 8S. Packard in the Great Salt
Lake. Nor have works on alge in foreign countries been as numerous
as usual. The second part of Cohn’s Kryptogamen Flora von Schlesien
contains the algze elaborated by Kirchner, and the Nuovo Giorn. Bot.
Ital. contains a paper by Borzi on the Morphology and Biology of the
Phycochromacee. Kjellman, in a short paper, illustrated by a chart,
gives an account of the distribution of alge by regions on the Skager-
Rack. Prof. E. P. Wright has two illustrated papers in the Transaec-
tions of the Royal Irish Academy: On the cell structure of Griffithsia
setacea and on the development of its antheridia and tetraspores, and On
the so-called Siphons and on the development of the tetraspores in Poiy-
siphonia. The Trans. Linn. Soe. contains an account, by D. D. Cunning-
ham, of a curious new genus, the single species of which, Mycoidea
q

parasitica, grows as a parasite on the leaves of the tea plant, the mango,
and other plants. Zopf, in a small pamphlet, has described and figured
the stages of development of Crenothrix polyspora, a species which
causes pollution of the water at Berlin and other places.

The cause of the motion of Oscillarie and Diatoms has been studied
by T. W. Engelmann, who, in an article in the Botanische Zeitung,
states that it is owing to the presence and contraction of a thin external
layer of protoplasm. Stahl found that when desmids are exposed to
the light they undergo certain peculiar motions, viz, their long diame-
ters are in the direction of the light, the distal end of the cells being
attached to the substratum, and at more or less regular periods the
cells make a half revolution, so that what was the distal end becomes
the forward end. Stahl also has a paper in the Botanische Zeitung, in
which he shows that the genus Vaucheria has a resting condition which
is identical with the so-called species of Gongrosira. Reinke, in Nova
Acta Leop. Carol., has an illustrated paper on the Cutleriacee of the Gult
of Naples, in which he claims to have seen the union of the antherozoids
and oogonia. In the proceedings of the Niederrhein. Gesellsch. Schmitz
has papers on the Structure of the Cells in Siphonocladiee and on the
Formation of the Fruit in the Squamariee.

Lichens.—In the department of lichenography very little was pub-
lished in the United States in the present year, the only notable work
being the list of lichens contributed by Professor Tuckerman to the
report of Professor Rothrock, which has already been mentioned. In
Europe, however, a number of descriptive papers has been published.
In the Journal Linn. Soe. is an account, by Prof. T. M. Fries, of the lich-
ens collected during the English Polar Expedition, 1875~76, in which, in
referring to the list of lichens collected by the Hayes Arctic Expedition
and published in the Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. of Philadelphia, he doubts
the accuracy of the determinations in the case of some of the species
there mentioned. The Jour. Linn. Soc. also has a paper by Crombie on
Australian lichens, and the same writer has a notice of new British
lichens in Grevillea. Leighton’s Lichen-Flora of Great Britain has this
year passed to a third edition. Additions to the lichen-flora of Europe
have appeared in Flora and Hedwigia from Arnold and Nylander. The
last-named writer has also a curious note in Flora entitled Circa Lichenes
vitricolas Notula. In Cohn’s Kryptogamen Flora von Schlesien, the
second part of which appeared in 1879, the descriptive part relating to
lichens was worked up by B. Stein. Inasmuch as Stein himself is a dis-
ciple of Kérber, and not a follower of Schwendener, the general intro-
duction on the nature of lichens was intrusted to Schroeter, who is a
Schwendenerite.

During the year the discussion as to the nature of lichens has been
carried on in the different journals, epecially in Flora and Grevillea, and
the articles have mostly been written by botanists opposed to the Schwen-
dener theory. In Grevilleais a paper by Cooke and in the Revue Mycol-

316 BOTANY.
BOTANY. 317

ogique one by Roumegueére, both strongly against the parasitical nature
of the lichens. In Grevillea, Crombie, while in general discrediting
Schwendener’s views, is unwilling to accept Minks’s theory with regard
to microgonidia, which he believes to be merely small particles having
a Brownian motion, as does also Nylander. The most extended work
on the nature of lichens published this year is an illustrated octavo of
about 250 pages by Minks, entitled Das Microgonidium, in which his
well-known views are given in great detail. Inthe Am. Jour. of Science
Professor Tuckerman, in discussing the question of the gonidiaof lichens,
states that he has observed microgonidium-like masses in Parmelia tiliacea
y. flavicans, and in the Bibliothéque Universelle Prof. J. Miiller states
that he has seen microgonidia in two other species of Parmelia.

Fungi.imAs usual an immense number of new species of fungi has
been described during the year, principally in a large number of small
papers seattered through the different journals. In addition to the
journals, such as Grevillea, Hedwigia, and Michelia, devoted exclusively
to cryptogams, there appeared this year a new journal, Revue Mycolo-
gique, devoted exclusively to fungi. It is a large octavo, and is pub-
lished quarterly under the editorship of M. Casimir Roumegueére of Tou-
louse.

In the United States several important papers appeared. The thirty-
first annual report of the New York State Museum of Natural History
contains the report of the botanist, Mr. C. H. Peck, in which is em-
bodied a large amount of mycological matter, including an arrangement
of the Myxomycetes of New York according to Rostafinski’s classification.
A second paper, read before the Albany Institute by Mr. Peck, is on the
United States Species of Lycoperdon. Besides these papers a number of
new species of American fungi have been described in the Botanical
Gazette by Peck, in Grevillea by Cooke and Ellis, and by Von Thuemen
in the Bull. Torrey Club and Revue Mycologique. A Californian species,
Helvella Californica, is described and figured by W. Philips in the
Trans. Linn. Soe. In the Am. Quart. Micros. Journ. is a paper by F. B.
Hines, Observations on several forms of Saprolegniee. Several works of
importance have appeared in Europe. The Mycographia of Cooke has
been continued, and the first volume brought to completion. Berkeley
and Broome have described new species from Queensland in the Trans.
Linn. Soe. The fourth part of Karsten’s Mycologia Fennica has appeared,
including the Hypodermii, Phycomycetes, and Myxomycetes, also the Dis-
comycetes of Gillet’s Champignons de la France. Oudemans has pub-
lished several papers on fungi of the Netherlands in the Archives Neer-
landaises, and for Scotland one must note the Mycologia Scottica of
J. Stevenson. The Revue Mycologique contains a number of papers by
Roumeguére relating to fungi new to France, as well as some entirely
new species as Rupinia Pyrenaica. Hedwigia contains a number of
notices of Swiss fungi, by Winter, especially of fungi of the order Ure
dinew. Besides papers already enumerated, Cooke has descriptions of
318 BOTANY.

British fungi and a paper on anew genus, Peniophora, in Grevillea. The
articles by Von Thuemen are numerous and scattered in several jour-
nals, and include descriptions of species from Egypt, Siberia, Germany,
and other countries.

The development of Acidiwm abietinum has been very carefully studied
by De Bary, who connects it with stylosporic and final forms found on
alpine species of Rhododendron. A nearly related form is found in Fin-
land, on Ledum, according to Woronin. In a paper on the Development
of some Uredinee in the Beitriige zur Biologie, Schroeter gives an ac-
count of the development of a Uredo on Ledum, and a detailed account of
a number of different Puccinie. Cornu has published a number of scat-
tered notes in the Bull. Soc. France, of which may be mentioned in this
connection some Remarks on Uredinee, especially the genus Roestelia.

HIGHER CRYPTOGAMS AND MUSCINE#.

In this country the principal work published during the year has been
the continuation of Eaton’s Ferns of North America. The same writer
also published in the Bull. Torr. Club a paper on New and little-known
Ferns of the United States, the species mentioned being principally from
Florida. A second illustrated work is Fern Etchings, by John William-
son, which contains illustrations of 68 ferns of the United States. Baker
has described, in the London Journal of Botany, ferns from Borneo, the
Fiji Islands, and the Sulu Archipelago.

In mosses we have a paper by Lesquereux and James in the Proce.
Am. Acad. of Arts and Sciences, entitled Descriptions of some new species
of North American Mosses, with a note by W. P. Schimper, and three
papers by C. F. Austin, one on Some New Musci, in the Botanical Gazette,
and Bryological Notes and Notes on Hepaticology, inthe Bull. Torr. Club.
In the last article, besides species of the United States, a number of
species were described from the Sandwich Islands. Of foreign writings
on mosses and hepatics, we may mention papers by Lindberg on northern
liverworts and mosses, Massalongo’s Hepaticologia Veneta in the pro-
ceedings of the Soc. Veneto-Trentina, and Hampe’s Enumeration of some
Brazilian Mosses.

Of developmental papers and those concerned with minute anatomy
in this department of botany the Untersuchungen tiber Lebermoose, by
Leitgeb, deserve especial notice. Of the work just named, parts four
and five appeared in 1879, and treated of the Riccew and Anthoceratee.
The same writer also published a paper on the development of ferns in
the proceedings of the Vienna Academy of Sciences. The sexual gen-
eration of the Marrattiew was described and fully illustrated by Jonk-
mann in a pamphlet published at Utrecht. Bauke, in a study of the
prothalli of Platycerium grande, came to the conclusion that the bilateral
form of the prothalli was not owing to any inherent property, but to the
action of gravity. In a short paper in Flora, Bauke also has some re-
BOTANY. 319

marks on the prothallus of Salvinia natans. Goebel, in the Botanische
Zeitung, mentions a peculiar formation of shoots on leaves of Tsoetes.

In Characee we have to notice the appearance of Characew Americane
in two fasciculi by Dr. T. F. Allen, including Chara gymnopus var. ele-
gans, A. Br. and C. crinita var. americana, of which descriptions and
colored plates are given. The proceedings of the Boston Society of
Natural History contain a paper by B. D. Halsted on the Classification
and Description of the American Species of Characee. The systematic
position of the Characew was discussed by 8S. H. Vines in a paper in the
Journal of Botany entitled The Pro-embryo of Chara, and he considers
that the order forms an independent group intermediate between the
Carposporee and the Muscinew.

PHANOGAMS.

Among the descriptive works on North American plants may be men,
tioned Reports upon the Botanical Collections made in portions of Nevada,
Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona during the years 1871~75, by J. T.
Rothrock. The work forms a part of the reports on the geological sur-
veys west of the 100th meridian made under the charge of Lieut. G. M.
Wheeler, and is a large quarto, with finely executed plates by Sprague.
In the elaboration of special orders and genera, Professor Rothrock was
assisted by the following gentlemen: S. Watson, George Engelmann,
T. C. Porter, M. 8. Bebb, William Boott, George Vasey, D. C. Eaton,
T. P. James, and Edward Tuckermann. The descriptive portion of the
work is preceded by notes on the general character of the.vegetation of
Colorado and New Mexico and notes on the economical properties of a
number of species. The botanical contributions of Prof. A. Gray consist
of two papers published in the Proceedings of the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences; Characters of some new species of Composite in the
Mexican collection made by C. C. Parry and Edward Palmer, chiefly in
the Province of San Luis Potosi in 1878; and Some new North American
genera, species, &c. The new genera are Suksdorfia, from the Columbia
River, and Howellia, from Oregon. In the same Proceedings are two
papers by Mr. Sereno Watson: Revision of the North American Liliacece
and Description of some New Species of North American Plants. In the
last-named paper, which includes the new genus Hollisteria, the species
described are principally from the west coast and from Florida, the
greater part having been collected by Dr. E. Palmer. Besides the
papers above named, there has appeared a number of shorter papers
and notes in the different journals, among which may be enumerated
Notes on Baptisia, by W. M. Canby, in the Botanical Gazette; Notes on
Vitis, by Dr. George Engelmann, and Ballast Plants in New York City, by
Addison Brown, in the Bulletin of the Torrey Club; Colorado Plants,
by I. C. Martindale, in the American Naturalist; and Catalogue of the
Phenogamous and vascular Cryptogamous Plants collected in Dakota and
320 BOTANY.

Montana, by Prof. J. W. Chickering, in the Bulletin U.S. Geol. and Geog.
Survey. The American Journal of Science contains a paper by Prof. C.
S. Sargent on the Forests of Central Nevada, with some remarks on those of
the adjacent regions, in which the comparative distribution of trees and
shrubs in the Rocky Mountain, the Nevada, and the Sierra Nevada
regions is discussed, and in the same journal is a paper by Professor
Gray on the Pertinacity and Predominance of Weeds, in which he comes
to the conclusion that “ self-fertilization is neither the cause, nor a per-
ceptible cause, of the prepotency of the European plants which are weeds
in, North America.” In addition to the papers above enumerated are
two others by foreign writers, which treat of North American plants ;
one by A. W. Bennett, on Polygale Americana, in the Journal of Botany,
and one on the Flora of the Saint Croix and Virgin Islands, published in
the Bulletin U. S. National Museum, by Baron H. F. A. Eggers.

Of the very numerous papers on local European floras nothing need
be said at present. The Conspectus Flore Europwe, by Nyman, of
which the first fasciculus was announced in 1878, has been continued,
and has for its useful object the collation of the floras of the different
European countries. Of foreign works should be mentioned the second
volume of Hooker’s Flora of British India and the continuation of
Boissier’s Flora Orientalis. One of the most sumptuous works which
appeared during the year was Aroidee Mazximiliane, by Schott and
Peyritsch, containing magnificent colored folio plates of the Aroids col-
lected during the journey of the Emperor Maximilian I to Brazil. The
Archives du Muséum contain monographs of the genera Ligustrum and
Syringa, by Decaisne, and in the Proc. Bot. Soc. of Edinburgh is a
monograph by Bennett of the genus Halophila, which enters into the
microscopic structure of the species. In an elaborate paper, entitled
Methodik der Speciesbeschreibung und Rubus, the writer, Dr. Otto Kuntze,
discusses the variability of the species of that genus, and proposes a new
method of nomenclature by means of symbols, a proposition which has met
with very little favor from systematic botanists. Beccari, in a work issued
in parts under the title of Malesia, has published the results of his travels
in the Malayan Archipelago, and the same author in the Zeitschrift
Oesterr. Vereins describes a gigantic aroid, Amorphophallus Titanum,
from Sumatra. In this connection reference should be made to Hooker
and Ball’s Marocco and the Great Atlas, which, although not a purely
botanical work, treats largely of the plants of that country. The Flora
Brasiliensis has been continued, and in 1879 there appeared the Gram-
inew, by Doll; Lobeliacee, by Kanitz; Plumbaginee and Plantaginea, by
Schmidt. An important economical as well as botanical contribution is
Todaro’s Account of the Cultivation of Cotton in Italy, followed by a
monograph on the genus Gossypium, a work published at Rome and
consisting of about three hundred pages of text with twelve folio plates.

PROGRESS LIN 1880.
GENERAL.

One of the important works published during the yearis La Phytogra-
phie or the art of describing plants considered from different poimts of
view, by A. De Candolle. Besides the instructive considerations on
nomenclature and descriptions, there is given a list of principal herbaria
and the authentie collections which they contain. We must alsomention
the Index perfectus ad Caroli Linnaei species Plantarum, nempe earum
primam editionem, by Baron F. von Mueller. A valuable new journal
has appeared during the year, the Botanisches Centralblatt, edited by Dr.
Oscar Uhlworm, assisted bya number of specialists. It is issued weekly
by Theodor Fischer, Cassel, and has for its object the presentation of
short reviews and notices of botanical works and society communica-
tions as soon as possible after their publication. The journal also in-
cludes a certain number of original communications. The number of
botanical text-books which has appeared during the year is rather large.
We would mention first, Botany for High Schools and Colleges, by Prof.
C. E. Bessey, which forms one of the American Scieuce Series issued by
Henry Holt & Co. The book covers all the departments of botany, and
is copiously illustrated. An Historical Sketch of the Science of Botany
in North America from 1840-1858, by Frederick Brendel, is finished in
the American Naturalist for 1880. Of the numerous European text-
books mention should be made of N. J. C. Miiller’s Handbuch der Botanik,
in two volumes; Reinke’s Lehrbuch der allgemeinen Botanik ; Behrens’s
Method-Lehrbuch der allgem. Botanik, and Warming’s Den almindelige
Botanth.

VEGETABLE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY.

The structure of sieve-cells has been treated in two papers by Jane-
zewski, and by Wilhelm. The distribution of stomata on the subterran-
ean parts of plants has been studied by Hohnfeldt, and the Am. Natural-
ist contains a paper by W. K. Higby, on the Microscopic Crystals con-
tained in. Plants. On the subject of morphology of special plants, we
may mention A. F. W. Schimper’s The Vegetative Organs of Prosopanche.
The Beitriige zur Biologie contains a paper by Klein, on the structure
of Pinguicula alpina, an insectivorous plant. In the Proc. Royal Soe.
is a paper by Vines, on the Chemical Composition of Alewrone-grains.
The aleurone grains in Peeonia are completely soluble in water; in some
other plants they are not. Aleurone grains are always surrounded by
an insoluble membrane which contributes to the formation of the net-
work which remains after the soluble parts have been removed. Ina
paper on the Origin of Starch-grains, by Schimper, the writer expresses
views contrary to those formerly advanced by Naegeli, and he describes

Sevinisee a
PU) aay eee

Rand BOTANY.

bodies to which the name of stiirkebildner’is given, from which starch
may be formed as well as from chlorophy] grains.

The germination of Welwitschia has been observed by Bower. Dr.
Engelmann, in the Trans. Saint Louis Academy, has some notes on the
Germination of Acorns, and in the Bot. Gazette, on the Vitality of the
seeds of serotinous cones. Prof. Sargent also discusses in the Gazette the
Vitality of the Seeds of Pinus contorta. The Am. Naturalist contains
papers by Professor Bessey, on the supposed Dimorphism of Lithosper-
mum longiflorum, and by Professor Todd on the Flowering of Saxifraga
tomentosa. Meehan, in the Proc. Am. Acad. of Philadelphia, calls atten-
tion to the Disarticulacing branches in Ampelopsis.

Two papers by Goebel should be mentioned: one on the Morphology
of the Leaf, and the other on Dorsiventral Growth, of which a large
number of instances are given. The Arbeiten des Botanischen Insti-
tuts, Wiirzburg, contains a number of important papers on physiology:
Sachs on Material and Form of Plant Organs ; Elfving on Some Hori-
zontally growing Rhizomata ; Wortmann on the Relations of the Intra-
molecular to Normal Respiration in Plants ; and by Francis Darwin on
the Growth of negative heliotropic Roots in Light and in Darkness. The
Influence of the Direction and Strength of the Illumination on some Forms
of Motion in Plants, is the title of a paper by Stahl, in the Bot. Zeitung.
Species of Mesocarpus according to Stahl are especially instructive, as
in this genus the band of chlorophyl rotates so that by strong illumina-
tion it lies in the direction of the light; by weak illumination at right
angles to it. Stahl also describes the change of position of chlorophyl
grains in cells depending on variations in the illumination. Schwen-
dener has studied the subject of several-celled scheitels, and thinks that
although such scheitels exist, they are always composed of fewer cells
than has been generally believed, and in the case of Marratia, he differs
with Russow in only recognizing the existence of four cells.

BACTERIA.

It is only possible to enumerate in this connection comparatively
few works having a botanical bearing, the majority of the papers on
bacteria being more directly concerned with pathological or chemical
questions. The Beitriige zur Biologie contains a paper by Neelsen,
called Studics on Blue Milk, in which the writer gives the resuits of
careful investigations on the cause of the blue color which is some-
times found in milk. He examined milk which had become blue spon-
taneously, and was able to produce the color in healthy miik by a pro-
cess of inoculation, and ascertain by experiment the conditions which
favored or retarded the production of the blue color. Of external
conditions favoring the production of blue milk the light has no in-
fluence, and the temperature within moderate limits has only a slight
influence. On the other hand, the presence of free oxygen and atmos-
BOTANY. 323

pheric moisture is essential for its production. The coloring matter of
the blue milk is not combined with the bacteria which may be present,
but is dissolved in the serum of the milk. A microscopic examination
shows the presence of small rod-like bodies, which ultimately form
torula-like chains. According to Neelsen, the cells of the chain, which
he ealls gonidia, remain dormant unless placed w fresh milk, in which
case they germinate. Tommasi-Crudelli and Klebs have studied the
origin of malarial fever, and conclude that malarial affections which they
induced experimentally were produced by organisms which were in the
ground in malarial districts before the outbreak of the fever, and
whose transmission in the air could be directly observed under definite
conditions of dampness and moisture. The organism which greatly
resembles Bacillus subtilis has been named B. malariv. Hansen claims
the priority of having discovered the cause of leprosy to be an organ-
ism named Bacillus lepre.

One of the most important papers published during year is that of
Dr. Hans Buehner, On the experimental production of the Contagium of
Splenic Fever from Bacillus subtls, with observations on theintroduction
of splenic fever through the organs of respiration. As is well known,
Bacillus subtilis, a common Wacterial form found in decoctions of hay,
can seareely be distinguished morphologically from Bacillus anthracis,
which is supposed to produce splenic fever in different animals. Buch-
ner undertook to ascertain whether, by varying the conditions of growth,
either of these two specics might not be transformed into the other;
that is, B. anthracis might not become harmless when inoculated and
B. subtilis might not produce splenic fever. He found by cultivation of

_B. anthracis in different solutions, as a solution of Liebig’s extract of
meat, that it gradually lost its power of producing splenic fever when
inoculated, and at the end of what he calls 1,500 generations of the
fungus he saw no difference, pathologically speaking, between the two
species in question. On the other hand, Bevcillus subtilis, which had for
a certain length of time been cultivated in defibrinated blood, when in-
jected into different animals produced symptoms of splenic fever. The
comparative distribution of bacteria in the air has been studied by Mi-
quel, who finds that they are much more Lumerous in summer than in
winter, and he states further that an increase of the amount of bacteria
is followed in a few days by an increase in the number of deaths from
contagious and epidemic diseases. ‘he commnunications of Pasteur on
the cholera of fowls, and the etiology of splenic fever, and the means of
prophylaxis, belong rather to the department of pathology than botany.
A paper on the Cause of Blight in Pear Trees was read by Prof. T. J. Bur-
rell before the Am. Assoc. Ady. of Science, in which he attributed the
disease to the presence of a minute bacterial form. Toa similar cause
it is also probable that the so-called yellows in peaches is to be attrib-
uted. Dr. George Sternberg, U.S. A., has issued a translation of Mag-
nin’s Les Bactéries, to which he has added original notes and plates.
324 BOTANY.
DISEASES OF PLANTS.

During the year numerous notices have appeared in regard to the
spread of the American vine mildew, Peronospora viticola, to the vine-
yards of Europe, where it is said to be causing great harm, especially in
Italy. The fungus has been found in several parts of France, Switzer-
land, Germany as far east as Austria, and in Italy. Rathay has de-
seribed a deformity of cherry trees produced by Exoascus Wiesneri.
Hartig has published a number of papers on injurious fungi in a peri-
odical called Untersuchungen aus dem Forstbotanischen Institut, the princi-
pal of which are Rosellinia quercina, which attacks the roots of oaks ;
Phytophthora Fagi, which attacks seedling beeches; Peziza Willkommit,
which causes a distortion ef the larch; and Nectria Cucurbitula, which
attacks the bark of spruces. The coffee-leaf disease, Hemileia vastatriz,
has been studied by D. Morris, and a preliminary report on the same
subject has been made by H. M. Ward, who was sent by the British
Government to Ceylon to investigate the subject. Die Blasenrost Pilze
der Coniferen, a monograph of the genus Peridermium, by Von Thiimen,
contains an account of the aecidial forms attacking Conifere, and
includes a number of species found in the United States.

THALLOPHYTES.

Algew.—New American species of alge have been described in the
Bull. Torrey club by Wolle. In the first annual Rep’t. Mass. State Board
of Health, Charity, and Lunacy 1s a paper by W. G. Farlow on Some Im-
purities of Drinking- Water, with two plates, illustrating the common
species which produce the disagreeable odor sometimes found in the
water supplies of Boston.

The most important work on alge which has appeared during the
year is Florideernes Morphologi by Agardh. This is a large quarto with
33 colored plates, and was originally presented at the Swedish Royal
Academy of Science in 1877, and bears the date of publication 1879, but
was not received in this country until 1880. The work is in Swedish,
and embodies the author’s views with regard to the structure of the
frond and fruit of the red-seaweeds. The text has been translated into
a Latin form, and under the title of Morphologia Floridearum has been
issued as an octavo with plates forming part ii of the third volume of
the Species Genera et Ordines Algarum. Areschoug, in the Bot. Notiser,
founds a new genus Oryglossum on Laminaria japonica, a species for-
merly included in LD. saccharina. Kjellman, in Bot. Tidsk, gives an ac-
count of Icelandic alga, and remarks that the alga flora of Iceland more
closely resembles that of Northern Scandinavia than that of Spitzber-
genand Greenland. Kuntze, in Engler’s Jahrbiicher, and also in Nature,
gives some observations on the distribution of the gulf-weed, and ex-
presses doubts as to the existenee of a genuine sargasso-sea, as de-
seribed by Humboldt and vthers. He also gives.a revision of the ge-
BOTANY. 325

nus Sargassum, in which he very much reduces the number of accepted
species of that genus. In the Journ. Linn. Soc. Dickie has some Notes
on Alge from the Amazon and its tributaries. For Central Europe we
have to mention the Contributions to the Alga-flora of Wirtemberg, by
Kirchner. Woronin, in the Botanische Zeitung, describes a new Vau-
cheria, V. De Baryana, and a curious algoid parasite, Chromophyton Ros-
anoffii, found in shallow pools in Finland.

In the Mitth. aus der Zoolog. Station of Naples is a paper by Berthold,
Zur Kenntniss der Siphoneen und Bangiaceen, in which he describes the fer-
tilization in Bangia, and the same writer also describes the Sexual Re-
production in Dasycladus claveformis. Schmitz describes the formation
of sporangia in the genus Halimeda. In Hedwigia P. Richter gives his
views on the transformations which the genius Glococystis undergoes.
Borzi has discovered antherozoids in Hildenbrandtia, which indicate its
affinities with the Squamariew. Ambronn notices some Cases‘of Bilater-
ality in Florideae in the Bot. Zeitung. Grevillea contains an account by
M. ©. Cooke of Desmids found in Great Britain since the publication of

Ralts’s Desmidiacec.

Tichens.—But very little has appeared in this department. Several
short articles were published in Flora, among which were Addenda nova
ad lichenographiam europeam; Lichenes nonnulli insule St. Thome, by
Nylander; the continuation of Arnold’s papers on Tyrolese lichens and
Lichenological Contributions by J. Miiller. A monograph of the Scandina-
vian Arthonia has been published by Almquist, and descriptions of spe-
cies from Australia and the Argentine Republic have been published by
Krempelhuber. A paper wasread by George Murray before the Linnean
Society, in which he suggested that in the gonida of lichens we have
what might be called a chlorophyl-screen by means of which the hyphae
are able to decompose carbonic acid. In Cohn’s Beitrige zur Biologie
is an interesting paper by Dr. Frank Schwarz, called Chemisch-botanische
Studien iiber die in den Flechten vorkommenden Flechtensaiiren, in which
he not only discusses the different acids, as chrysophanic, lecanoric,
erythrinic and evernic acids, in relation to their chemical composi-
tion, but also from an histological study of the thalli of different lich-
ens has attempted to ascertain exactly where the acids are found in the
thallus.

Fungi.—On fungi relating to the United States several papers have
been published. In the Bull. Torrey club is a description of a new fun-
gus, Simblum rubescens, by W. R. Gerard, with two plates. This curious
fungus belongs to the Phalloidei, and at the end of the paper mentioned
Gerard gives a list of the species of Phalloidet found in the United States.
The same writer has also two other papers in the Bulletin on Additions
to the U. S. Phalloidei, and Correlation between the Odor of the Phalloids
and their Relative Frequency. Inthe same journal is a paper by Peck on
Polyporus volvatus and its varieties, in which he founds a new genus
Cryptoporus on this species, and an article by J. B. Ellison a New Sphae-
aa0 BOTANY.

ria on Grapes, Sphaeria Bidwellit, which he regards as the ascigerous con-
dition of Phoma uvicola B. and C. In the Bot Gazette are Notes on
Fungi, by M. E. Banning, and North American Species of Septoria, by Von
Thuemen; a Catalogue of the Pacific Coast Fungi, by H. W. Harkness and
J. P. Moore, including a large number of species, was read before the
California Academy of Sciences and afterwards issued in an octavo form.
Grevillea contains papers on California fungi, by Cooke and Harkness,
and on New York fungi, by Cooke.

The fungi of the herbarium of the late MHe Libert have been the sub-
ject of papers in Grevillea by Cooke, Reliquae Libertiane, and by Rou-
meguere and Spegazzini in the Revue Mycologique, Revisio Relique
Libertiane, and specimens have been distributed also by Von Thiiemen
in Myecotheca Universalis. Cooke has a number of papers in Grevillea;
Observations on Peziza; on Hymenochaete and its allies; descriptions of
British and Indian fungi; and South African and Australian fungi by
Kalchbrenner and Cooke. Hedwigia has a number of notices of Swiss
fungi, especially Uredinew, by Winter, and new fungi trom the Jura and
the Vosges are described in Grevillea by Quelet. Additions to the
mycological flora of Finland have been made by Karsten, and to the
Italian flora by Saceardo, Spegazzini, and Passerini in Michelia, and
the Atti Soe. Critt. Ital. The Revue Mycologique contains descriptions
of new fungi by Roumeguére, Von Thiimen, Passerini, Spegazzini, and
others. .

Developmental works on fungi have not been numerous. Hartig has
connected Calyptospora Goeppertiana Kiihn with AYcidium columnare A.
and S. by means of experimental cultures. Rathay experimented on the
connection between different species of Gymnosporangium and Roestelia,
and differs from Oersted in believing that R. penicillata is the aecidial
form of G. Juniperinum, and not of G. clavarieforme. The development
of the spores in Urocystis colchict has been observed by Prilleux, who
has a paper on the subject in the Annales des Sciences. In the Beit-
rige Zur Biologie is a paper by Hidam, Beitrag Zur Kenntniss der Gym-
noasceen, in which he gives the development of Ctenomyces serratus and
Gymnoascus uncinatus. Fischer, in the Botanische Zeitung, has shown
that the enigmatical round and spiny bodies found in Saprolegnia spe-
cies are not organs of the Saprolegnia, but parasites, apparently related
to Chytridium. Reinke has studied the chemical composition of the plas-
modium of Aethaliwm septicum, the principal constituent of which he finds
to be plastin, which he has studied in detail.

ARCHEGONIATA.

In the United States, the principal publication has been the Ferns of
North America, by Professor Eaton, which reached completion this year,
including in all 181 plates and accompanying descriptions. Besides
this principal work there is a paper in the Bull. Torrey Club, on New or
ie

BOTANY. 397

little known Ferns of the United States, by the same writer ; who has also
issued a Systematic Fern-List of the species of this country. In the Bull.
Torr. Club are two papers by G. E. Davenport, on a new species, Notho-
lena Grayi, from Arizona, and on Vernation in Botrychium boreale, and
a paper on Ferns of the Cumberland, by John Williamson. The occur-
rence of the rare Schizea pusilla in Nova Scotia is recorded by Pro-
fessor Gray in the Bot. Gazette. In the same journal are notes by Pro-
fessor Gray and E. J. Loomis on an automatic movement of the frond
of Asplenium Trichomanes.

Baker describes some new ferns, collected by Beceari in Sumatra,
and a collection from Madagascar by Langley Kitcbing in the Journal
of Botany, where the same writer has also published a Synopsis of the
Species of Isoetes. In the Trans. Linn. Soc. is a Review of the Ferns of
Northern India, by C. B. Clarke.

In the department of mosses and hepatics there has appeared in the
United States a Catalogue of North American Mosses, by Ki. A. Rau and
A. B. Hervey, and Bryological Notes and Criticisms, by C. IF. Austin, in
the Bull. Torrey Club. An important work is Sphagnacee of Europe
and North America, by R. Braithwaite, and the British Moss-Flora, part 2,
including the Burbaumiacee and Georgiacec, by the same author. The
Annales des Sciences contain a paper by Bescherelle, entitled Florule
Bryologique de la Réunion, which also includes mosses from other neigh-
boring islands. Lindberg has published notes on Scandinavian mosses
and ©. Miiller a Prodromus Bryologia Argentine, the last named
paper being a continuation in the Revue Bryologique. In Grevillea
and in the Trans. of Bot. Soc. of Edinburgh are notes on British Hepatice
by Carrington. The Jungermanniacee have been studied by Gottsche
who has published new observations on the Geocalycee and Stephani
has published a paper on the Jungermanniacee of Germany with illus-
trations.

Treating of Characee we have to notice the appearance of two num-
bers of the Characece of America, by Dr. T. F. Allen, in which three
species of Nitella and three of Chara are described and figured. Dr.
Allen has also an article in the Bull. Torr. Club on the Similarity between
the Characee of America and Asia in which he calls special attention to
Nitella polyglochin A. Br. and Chara Hydropitys Reichenb. A Review of
the British Characee, by Henry and James Groves, is given in the
Journal of Botany.

On the general development of the higher cryptogams is to be men-
tioned Die Gefisskryptogamen by Sadebeck, in the Eneyklopaedie der
Naturwissenschaften and Goebel’s Embryologie der Archegoniaten in
Arbeiten Bot. Instituts in Wurzburg. Leitgeb has published several
important papers on Marchantiacee, especially with reference to their
inflorescence and stomata in the proceedings of the Vienna Academy.
Cramer has an illustrated paper on the Non-sexual increase of the Fern-
328 BOTANY.

prothallus, in which he figures some curious forms of buds and what he
calls conidia, and in Kosmos is an article by Dodel-Port on the peculiar
forms which fern-prothalli assume when grown under water.

PH ANOGAMS.

The most important work published during the year in the United
States is the second and final volume of the Flora of California, by
Sereno Watson. The work was published under the auspices of the
Geological Survey of California, aided by private subscriptions. In the
work Mr. Watson was aided by Dr. Engelmann, who elaborated the oaks,
pines, and Loranthacee ; by M.S. Bebb on the willows; William Boot
on Carices; Dr. George Thurber on the grasses; and Professor Eaton
on the higher cryptogams. The work ends with the mosses, the lower
cryptogams being entirely omitted. The appendix contains a glossary
and a List of Persons who have made botanical collections in California,
by Prof. W. H. Brewer. The botanical contributions of Professor Gray
in the Proc. Am. Acad. Arts and Sciences comprise Notes on some Composi-
te, which form a sort of prodromus of that order in the Synoptical Flora;
Some Species of Asclepias; A New Genus of Gentianacew, Geniostemon
including two Mexican species; and Miscellaneew of the North American
Flora, including the new genus Reverchonia. The Vegetation of the Rocky
Mountain Region, by Professor Gray and Sir J. D. Hooker, published in
the Bull. U. 8. Geol. and Geog. Survey, although bearing the date 1880,
was not in reality made generally public until 1881. The Trans. St.
Louis Academy contain a Revision of the genus Pinus and Description of
Pinus Llliotti, by Dr. Engelmann, with three folio plates by Roetter.
In the Botanical Gazette are several notices by Professor Gray, of which
may be mentioned an account of the genus Leavenworthia, of which
four species are described. In the same journal Engelmann describes
a new species of Catalpa, C. speciosa; Mr. 'T. Morong describes some
new species of Potamogeton, and Professor Porter a new species, Haben-
aria Garberi. Bailey gives an account of Michigan Lake Shore Plants ;
I. C. Martindale, under the title of Germination and Growth of Parasitic
Plants, relates his experience with Orobanche minor. The same botanist
gives an account of the so-called Bartram Oak, in which he concludes
that Quercus heterophylla Mchx. is a distinct species. J. Donnell Smith
has in Bull. Torr. Club a note on Wolffia gladiata var. Floridana, in
which he includes some remarks by Hegelmaier on that species. Prof.
C. S. Sargent has issued a Catalogue of the Forest Trees of North America
in connection with the work of the Census bureau.

Of foreign works may be mentioned Elmes’s Monograph of the genus
Lilium, a folio with 78 colored plates, and J. G. Baker’s Synopsis of
Aloinee and Yuccoidee in the Journ. Linn. Soc. Several additions have
been made during the year to works on local floras which had appeared
in part in previous years. The Flora of British India, by Hooker, has
BOTANY. 329
been continued in part seven to the Rubiacew ; the Biologia centrali-
americana, the botanical part of which is by Hemsley, contains the
orders from Rosacee to Loasacee ; the Flora Brasiliensis, fase. 76, con-
taining Lemnacew by Hegelmaier, and Aracew by Engler, was published
this year, although the last-named order had been’ in press for some
time. Fournier’s Mexicanarum plantarum enumeratio is devoted to the
tion of Mexican grasses in the Ann. Sci. Nat., in which he remarks that
of the 643 species in Mexico 371 are peculiar to that country. Adansonia
contains a number of papers by Baillon on the development of the flow-
ers in Berberidacee, Selaginacee, and Stylidiacew. Concerning oriental
plants, we have to mention Regel’s Description of Plants from Central

There appeared in 1880 the first volume of Botanische Jahrbiicher fiir

number of interesting papers relating to phenogams, amongst which
may be enumerated: Beceari’s Pflanzengeographie des Malayischen Archt-

Gattung Rubus; Buchenaws Verbreitung der Juncaceen tiber die Erde;
Engler’s Beitrdge ziir Kenntniss der Aracew and Verbreitung der Gattung

the distribution of species should be noticed Quelques observations sur la
Flore Alpine @ Europe, by Bonnier, in which he compares the notes made
by him on plants collected in the Carpathian Mountains, the Austrian
Alps, and the Tyrolese Alps, and concludes that the constitution of the
soil has little to do with the distribution of species, which depends, as
De Candolle maintained, on the sums of the temperatures.

ZOOLOGY.

By THEODORE GILL.

GENERAL ZOOLOGY.
FEATURES OF PROGRESS.

The progress of Zoology in the biennial period just past has shown
the usual features exhibited during the present decade. The doctrine
of evolution is now not only recognized by all scientific workers in biol-
ogy, but it is postulated as the starting-point for investigations into the
affinities of various types, and the efforts of biologists are in a great
measure directed to the ascertainment of the philogeny and derivation
of the various types. This has been exemplified during the past two
years in attempts at tracing the genealogy of the mammals, the cephal-
opods, and the acalephs, as well as various groups of the branches and
classes of the animal kingdom; as, for example, the carnivorous mam-
mals, the ungulates, various worms, We.

Perhaps the most prominent feature of the period surveyed has been
the discovery of numerous deep-sea types, mostly resulting from the
voyage of the English ship Challenger, but in part also the fruits of
dredging of minor expeditions and surveys; for example, the survey
of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, under the auspices of the
United States Coast Survey; the explorations of the United States Com-
mission of Fish and Fisheries, and the Norwegian expedition to the
Arctic Seas in 1876 to 1878. These several, expeditions and surveys
have been fruitful in the finding and revelation of many remarkable
forms. So rich have been the results that, as we shall hereafter see,
about 2,000 species of a peculiar group—the Pheodaria—have been
made known by a single naturalist, mostly from the collections of the
Challenger expedition. Our knowledge of the fishes of the deep sea
has also been greatly increased.

An especially noteworthy feature in the taxonomy of 1879 and 1880
has been the establishment of a number of “orders” in various groups
of the animal kingdom. In view of the disparity in value of these
groups, in the several departments of zoology, it seems fitting to utter
a few words of caution and explanation in this place. What is an
order ? and what shall be the limits to the range of variation of the

forms included under such designation? are questions that must nat-

urally suggest themselves and be answered. In the first place, of
course, orders, like every aggregation of animals and plants, must to
a large extent be arbitrary, and their relations have to be determined
by a certain standard, from which greater or less deviation must be
made in individual cases, according to circumstances. The standard,
however, as will be admitted by probably every rational zoologist,
should be a type that from its nature and relations may be readily com-
prehensible and appreciated by the greatest number, and in regard to
which there is general concurrence. Undoubtedly it is in the class of
mammals that we find such requisites present in the greatest degree.
Accepting Linneus as the originator, pro tanto, of the idea connected
with the name order, we naturally look to his exposition cf the mammal
groups. We find that though there have been great deviations from
his applications since his day, the fundamental idea of the group, as it
exists in nature, has been accepted, and the efforts of subsequent zool-
ogists have been chiefly in the direction of refinement and definition.
There is now a general concurrence as to the orders recognizable in the
class of mammals, although some little difference as to details still pre-
vails. Taking the most comprehensive ones, we have the Primates,
Carnivores, Ungulates, Cetaceans, Sirenians, Chiropters, Insectivores,
Rodents, and Marsupials. Now, inasmuch as several of these have
been subdivided, let it be assumed that no groups between which exist
greater morphological differences than those which differentiate the
orders, with their maximum limits, from those nearest of kin, shall be
regarded as less than orders; and, on the other hand, that we shall not
distinguish as orders such groups as have at least less differences than
those separating, for example, the Anthropoid and Lemuroid Primates,
the Fissiped and Pinniped Carnivores, and the Perissodactyle and Arti-
odactyle Ungulates. From this starting-point it will be in place to ex-
amine a couple of systematic attempts published during the past year.
One has been a new revision of the class of Birds; another, a reiterated
classification of the Fishes.

In all nature, among the major aggregates of species, there is not a
more natural and homogeneous group than that which naturalists unan-
imously*have agreed to consider as a class under the name of Birds.
So like are all the living representatives of this group in all essential
details of their morphology, that between the extremes there certainly
exist less differences than those which separate the cetaceous from any
other order, and perhaps less even than those which separate the Anthro-
poid and Lemuroid Primates, or the Fissiped and Pinniped Carnivores.
Nevertheless, the last reviser of the class has admitted no less than
26 orders. If the proposition that the order of Mammals is a proper
standard be accepted, there can be no question but that differentiation
in the class of Birds has been carried to a most unscientific extreme.

The opposite extreme has been displayed in the treatment of the
classification of Fishes, in part at least, but at the same time a like
ZOOLOGY. J Oo

extreme in excessive differentiation. Dr. Giinther has published an
“ Introduction to the Study of Fishes,” in which he recognizes as orders
certain artificial groups of Teleosts current for a long time; that is,
the Acanthopterygii, Acanthopterygii Pharyngognathi, Anacanthini,
Physostomi, &e.

The characters used to differentiate these “orders” fail in certain
representatives referred to each group, and are of really little more
systematic importance in several cases than those used to distinguish
the “orders” of Birds. Nevertheless, to each of the “orders” in
question are assigned forms which do really differ in important ana-
tomical details, and which have far less relation to the types with which
they are confounded than do the types of the so-called orders exhibit
among themselves. We have, consequently, evils here, not only of undue
valuation, but also radical defects in appreciation of relationships.
But the same author applies a standard as different as possible to the
classification of the generalized types of Fishes; committing, at the
same time, the great mistake of calling those generalized types the
highest. All the typical Ganoids, as well as the Polypteroids, and
Dipnoans are confused together in one heterogeneous order; all the
Chimeroids, and all the Sharks and Rays, are thrown together in a
second. There can be no question but that representatives of each of
these last two so-called ‘‘ orders” exhibit far greater diversities in their
structure, inter se, than do any of the orders of existing mammals.
It is difficult to believe that any consideration could have been given to
the principles of taxonomy, or that thought could have been actively
involved in such schemes as the last one noticed.

As to the new orders recently proposed, and to be noticed hereafter, it
is probable that the value of the several groups endowed with such rank
will be questioned by the majority of naturalists, and that the types so
distinguished will ultimately be degraded in rank.

The language of the original from which the abstract is compiled is
followed as closely as the case will permit, as the advantages of such a
course must be obvious to all on a little reflection. It has however
been genérally found to be necessary to limit the abstract to the illus-
tration of the prominent idea underlying the original memoir, arid pass
by the proofs and collateral arguments. At the same time it has been
often attempted to bring the new discovery into relation with the pre-
vious status of information respecting the group under consideration.
As to the special discoveries recorded, they have been generally selected
(1) on account of the modifications the forms considered force on the
system; or (2) for the reason that they are or have been deemed to be
of high taxonomic importance; or (3) because the animals per se are of
general interest; or, finally (4), because they are of special interest to
the American naturalist. Of course, zoologists cultivating limited fields
of research will find in omissions cause for censure, and may urge that
discoveries of inferior importance have been noticed to the exclusion of

those better entitled to it. It is freely admitted that this charge may
even be justly made; but the limits assigned to the record have been
exceeded, and the recorder has studied the needs of the many rather
than of the few. Thesummary is intended, not for the advanced scientific
student, but for those who entertain a general interest in zoology or
some of the better-known classes.

The compilation of this record has been greatly facilitated by the
‘Zoologischer Anzeiger” of Professor Carus and the very useful synop-
ses published in the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society of London.
The value of both of the records thus referred to is, however, very greatly
reduced by the absence of an index to names of authors cited in the
first, and to the neglect to give a reference to the exact title and place of
publication of the original paper in connection with the abstract in the
latter case. The consequence is that very much valuable time must be
lost to confirm and find references.

ANAL RESPIRATION IN ANIMALS.

Mr. M. M. Hartog, in connection with observations on the anal respi-
ration of Cyclops, as well as Canthocamptus of the Harpacticide and
Diaptomus of the Calanidze, has enumerated the forms of invertebrates
in which anal respiration is manifested.* These belong to the following
classes and major groups:

VERMES:

Rotifera.
Gephyrea.
Oligocheeta- Limicola.

EXCHINODERMATA :

Holothuroidea.
ARTHROPODA:
Crustacea (generally).
Insecta (aquatic larvee generally).
MOLLUSCA:
Dentalium.

PHOSPHORESCENCE IN ANIMALS.

Mons. Jousset de Bellesme has continued his researches upon the phos-
phorescence of animals by a special investigation of that of the glow-
worm.t He concludes that the phosphorescent substance is probably a
gaseous product, for the structure of the giand does not give us the idea
of an organ with a liquid secretion. The chemical products which are

phosphorescent at ordinary temperatures are not numerous, and the one
which chiefly occurs is phosphureted hydrogen. This, M. Jousset de
Bellesme is led to believe, is the case in the glowworm, and he is influ-
enced in his opinion by the extreme resemblance observable between the
phosphorescence of substances in decomposition which is due to the
evolution of phosphureted hydrogen and thatofluminousanimals. They
present, he thinks, the same physical characteristics, the same afiinity
for oxygen, the only difference being that the cadaveric phosphorescence
is continuous, while the phosphorescence of animals is intermittent.
But the latter is due to the fact that the cellular decomposition which
sets free the luminous product tak es place in animals of high organiza-
tion only under excitation of the nervous system, and in the lower ani-
mals (e. g.—Noctiluce) only by meaus of external excitants.

The author has been led by his investigations to regard phosphores
cence as a general property of protoplasm consisting in the evolution of
phosphureted hydrogen.

This view readily explains why many of the lower animals, although
destitute of a nervous system, are phosphorescent, and has the addi-
tional advantage of connecting the phenomena of phosphorescence
observable in living animals with those exhib: <d in organic matters in
course of decomposition. It is, he concindes, another example of a
biological phenomenon very closely related to an exciusively chemical
cause.

LIGHT AND ITS EFFECTS ON ANIMALS.

It may be recalled that some years ago General Pleasonton recorded
some startling ideas with respect to the influence of blue light. As
the observations were evidently made in a very crude fashion, little
attention was paid to them. The subject of the influence of different
colored rays has been made the subject during the past year of special
investigation by Moleschott and Fubini.* The eggs of a frog and toad
were placed in: vessels and covered with giasses or fluids oi different
colors. “At first the developmental processes did not differ among
the different ova, or from those which were exposed to ordinary day-
light.” When rotation commenced, however, it was found that the eggs
exposed to red light rotated most rapidly, while great terpor was
exhibited by those under the blue glass; the rest, exposed to vellow or
green light, did not differ at all from those developed under uncolored
glass. “The most greedy were those under the blue glass. When
brought from their artificial influence, its eifects gradually passed off.
When changed from one color to another, the activity displayed became
gradually more or less.” In investigating the action of different kinds

of colored light on the excretion of carbonic acid, the following results
were obtained :

Tt is coneluded that light has “a considerable influence on metabolic
activity. It increases the excretion of carbonic acid and the ingestion
of oxygen, but this influence is not only mediate through the eyes, it
obtains through the skin, for it is seen in eyeless animals. When the
eyes only or the skin only are affected, the result is less than when the
whole animal is brought under its influence. The tissues are no less
affected than the whole body. The chemical rays have greater effect
than the heating ones, and the result that light has a chemical influence
on metabolism cannot be evaded.” (Abstract from J. Rk. IM. 8.)

EFFECTS OF STARVATION.

Surg. D. D. Cunningham, of the Indian medical service, has investi-
gated the physiology of starvation in certain fungous plants, and Am-
phibans (of the tadpoles of a toad—bufo melanostictus and a frog—
Rana tigrina).* The result of his investigation was to demonstrate that
a fatty degeneration and disintegration of the protoplasm ensued, and
in the animals an atrophy of the intestinal canal. The fatty degenera-
tion effects in the greatest degree the lining cells of the digestive canal,
and this in time is completely left destitute of epithelium, and therefore
no longer capable of fulfilling the functions of secretion and absorption.
When this climax is reached death must ensue, but as long as any of the
epithelium is left (even though it be much degenerated) recevery is pos-
sible. In connection with these experiments Surgeon Caonningham has
studied the phenomena exhibited by starvation in the case of the in-
habitants of India who suffered and died from the famine lately preva-
lent in that country. Although patients that had been for some time
deprived of food showed no symptoms of actual disease, they were at-
tacked by diarrhcea and dysentery with almost certainly fatal results,
and thus was indieated inability for assimilation. A post-mortem ex-
amination proved that there was, as in the case of the plants and ani-
mals experimented upon, a fatty degeneration of the tissues, especially
the alimentary canal. So long, however, as the sufferers had a small
amount of nutriment no active symptoms were manifested, and it was
only when they were afforded a generous supply, that famine diarrhea
and dysentery commenced. The most rigorous attention and regimen

were found to be ineffectual in advanced cases ; but if only slight degen-
eration of the tissues had taken place, food judiciously supplied coun-
teracted the effects of previous privation. As soon, however, as exten-
sive degeneration had taken place no care was sufficient to recuperate
the patient.

RHIZOPODS.

A NEW “CLASS” OF RHIZOPODS.*

As long ago as 1859, Professor Haeckel had known several peculiar
forms of Rhizopods, which he subsequently described in a monograph
of the Radiolaria as representatives of three distinct families. In 1879
Hertwig differentiated these forms, with others subsequently made known,
as an order of Radiolaria, under the name “ Tripylee.” A large number
of forms belonging to the group were obtained by the Challenger expe-
dition, and have been subjected to a critical study by Haeckel, and, as
Murray first showed, “a striking character of all these Rhizopods is the
coustant presence of large dark-brown pigmented granules, scattered
irregularly round the central-capsule, and covering the greater part of
its outer surface.” This extra capsular mass is called by Haeckel the
“ pheodium” (dark brown or dusky). ‘The phodella, large brown
granules of the ‘ pheeodium,’ are not, as Murray supposed, true pigment
cells, as a true cell nucleus can not be observed in them; and the nature
of the peculiar pigment of these pseudo-cells is not preeisely known;
but the quantity and constancy with which the ‘ pheodium’ appears in
all ‘ Pheeodaria,’ while it is wanting in all the typical Radiolaria, gives
the Pheodaria a high degree of systematic importance.” On account of
this “‘ constant presence of the phzeodium, and the peculiarly constructed
membrane of the central-capsule,” the type thereby differentiated is iso-
lated and a distinct ‘ class” constituted for it. The species generally
attain considerable size, in comparison with other Radiolaria, and are
even visible to the naked eye. Many are a half millimeter or more in
diameter. ‘‘ The conspicuous central capsule is usually round or sphe-
roidal: it is, however, often egg-shaped or somewhat oval. In many
cases it is monaxial; in others dipleuric. Its membrane is very firm
and always double, the outer layer very thick, the inner thin. The
opening through which the pseudopodia appear has the very peculiar
structure accurately described by R. Hertwig. Many Pheodaria have
only one such opening (Monopylew), others have two at the opposite
poles of the central-capsule (Amphipylee),” and still others more. The
siliceous skeleton is extra capsular. Although the principal forms of
this group have analogues among the typical Radiolara, they are usu-
ally readily distinguished from them. Haeckel has proposed ten ‘ fam-
ilies,” and these have been segregated by him under four “orders,”
distinguished severally by characteristics of the skeleton, or the absence
of a skeleton. He has found among the forms examined by him what
he calls more than 2,000 new species !

HYDROZOA OR ACALEPHS.

WATER IN MEDUSZE.

Soine time ago it was stated by Professor Mobius that in a specimen
of Aurelia aurita, from the Bay of Kiel, it had been ascertained that
there was 99.82 per cent. of water, and consequently the solid matter
could only have formed a small fraction of 1 per cent. This statement
was so remarkable that, before acceptance, it required verification, and
Dr. Krukenberg has recently examined specimens of the class, with the
object of verifying or disproving the allegation.*

Specimens of Aurelia found at Triest were examined, and it was found
that the water formed only from 95.84 to 95.79 per cent. of the total,
the solid existing in the ratio of from 4.21 to 4.66 per cent. Chrysaora
hyoscella afforded 95.75 per cent. to 96.3 per cent. of water, and there
was from 3.7 to 4.25 of solid substances. A large specimen of Rhizostoma
OCuviert was found to contain 95.392 per cent. of water, and consequently
nearly 5 of solid matter, of which there were 1.608 per cent. of organy
and 3 per cent. of inorganic substances. It was concluded that proba-
bly the Medusz generally exhibit a close approximation to these results,
and that in none is there so small a percentage of solid matter to be
found as in the case instanced by Mobius.

EXTRA-MARINE MEDUS 4.

There is, perhaps, no type of animals that has been generally regarded
as being so eminently characteristic of the open seaas the Medusxe. While
representatives of the class exhibiting the hydriform condition have of
course been long well known as inhabitants of fresh waters, until recently
none of the medusiform groups have been specially noticed as having
been found elsewhere than in the sea. It has been said of them that
they dread nothing more than fresh water, and that such water is really
poison to them; that even brackish water kills them immediately ; and,
further, that they need a water rich in oxygen and constantly renewed
by movements of the waves and currents. “The Medusa, in fact, have
almost an equal dread of fresh water, of stagnant sea-water, and of a
slightly too high temperature.” Several cases, however, have been
recorded within the last two years which must materially modify the
accepted beliefs with regard to their habitat.

FRESH-WATER MEDUS i.

/

Mr. Agassiz has shown} that the idea respecting the exclusive con-
finement of Medusz to perfectly salt and clean sea water is exaggerated.
He records that in an estuary back of Boston harbor, at West Boston

bridge (about one mile from the head of the harbor), and where the
water, at the last part of the tide, is almost fresh and has a very slight
salt taste, there is an abundance of Hydroids, which “thrive remarka-
bly well on the drainage of the district, and grow to an unusually large
size.” The species which have free meduse are Hucope diaphana, L.
pyriformis, and Obelia commissuralis, and these are twice during 24 hours
of the day exposed alternately to salt and nearly fresh water, and thrive
under the change, both in their hydriform and medusiform conditions.
Other medusz found near the same place, and which, at low tide, were
in fresh water, were species of Sarsie, Piaropsis, and Aurelia, and these
seemed unaffected by the large quantity of fresh water in which they
were found.
NEW PALUDICOLOUS MEDUSA.*

In 1876, Dr. Du Plessis discovered “in the middle of the discharg
ing canal of the salt-works of Villeroy, near Cette,” a Medusa which
inhabits in the summer the stream thereof and the near-lying waters.
The canal is about two or three yards broad and one deep. ‘The soil
is a black putrid mud, stinking of sulphureted hydrogen,” and the water
is perfectly stagnant, very brackish, and exposed all day long to the full
rays of the sun. “The Medusa always inhabits the lower surface of
islets of floating alee. On removing these it is seen clinging like a>
flake of jelly, shining like erystal.” They only eccur in June and July,
and were looked for in vain in spring as well asin September and Octo-
ber. The Medusa in question was ascertained to belong to the genus
Cosmetira, a representative of the family of Oceanidwe, and is very
closely related to, though much smaller than, the Cosmetira punciata,
which is abundant in the contiguous sea. Dr. Du Plessis, who described
the species in 1879, considers that it furnishes an example of the influ-
ence of the surrounding medium in the gradual modification and trans-
formation of one species into another, for he doubts not that the diminu-
tive Cosmetira is a decendant of the Cosmetira punctata, from which it
has become modified and reduced greatly in size, while the canals and
stomach have assumed a green color, and the general rose-color of the
oceanic form has been changed into violet, while the tentacles become
black.

A FRESH-WATER JELLY-FISH. t

In the summer of 1880 Mr. Sowerby, the secretary of the Royal Bo-
tanical Society of London, noticed quite a number of small animals,
which were soon ascertained to be medusz, in a warm-water tank in

which plants of the Victoria regia were growing in the garden of that
society. The water in the tank had a temperature of about 90° F., and
was literally swarming with the little meduszx, the larger of which
measured nearly half an inch in transverse diameter. They were very
energetic in their swimming, and displayed the characteristic systole
and diastole of the umbrella, and were flourishing apparently in the very
conditions which contribute most completely to their well being. Speci-
mens of this form were obtained by Profs. E. Ray Lankester and Geo.
G. Allmann, and described by the former June 17, and by the latter June
24, in ‘* Nature”; by the former, under the name Craspedacusta Sowerbii,
and by the latter as Limnocodium Victoria. Subsequently an attempt
to compromise on the name was made, and Professor Lankester desired
to perpetuate the designation of Limnocodium Sowerbii. Inasmuch,
however, as Craspedacusta was first used and accompanied by a Ssatis-
factory diagnosis, there can be no question but that conformity with
the laws of nomenclature compels its retention. The most characteristic
feature of the new form is the development of otoliths and velar canals.
The otoliths are “ placed along the line of insertion of the velum—about
80 in number (fewer in small specimens). From 16 to 20 are placed
between successive perradial tentacles arranged in groups of two or three
between the successive secondary tentacles.” The velar centrifugal
canals ‘(which are really the elongated otocysts) are peculiar to this
genus; passing from the otoliths (one inclosing each otolith) into the
velum, and then ending blindly. They appear to correspond to the
centripetal canals found in other Trachomedusz, in the disk.” By Pro-
fessor Lankester it is claimed that Craspedacusta belongs to the family
Petaside among the Trachomedusz, which are distinguished by the
development of “four radial canals, in the course of which four gonads
lie, with a long tubular stomach, and no stomach-stalk.” According to
Professor Allmann, however, while some of the characters ‘ point to an
affinity with both Trachomedusz and Narcomeduse, this affinity ceases
to show itself in the very important morphological element afforded by
the marginal bodies. In both Trachomedusz and Narcomeduse the
marginal bodies belong to the tentacular system; they are metamor-
phosed tentacles, and their otolite cells are endodermal, while in the
Leptomeduse, the only other order of craspedototal Meduse in which
marginal vesicles occur, these bodies are genetically derived from the
velum. Now,in Limnocodium the marginal vesicles seem to be as truly
velar asin the Leptomeduse. They occur on the lower or abumbral side
of the velum, close to its insertion into the umbrella, and the tubular exten-
sion of their capsule runs along this side to the free margin of the velum,
while the delicate epithelium of the abumbral side passes over them, as
in the Leptomeduse. It is true that this point cannot be regarded as
settled until an opportunity of tracing the developmentis afforded ; but
in very young specimens which I examined I found nothing opposed to
the view that the marginal vesicles were derived, like those of the
ZOOLOGY. 341

Leptomeduse, from the velum.” It is concluded that Limnocodium “ will
hold a position intermediate between the Leptomedusie and the Tracho-
meduse ; but as the greatest systematic importance must be attached
to the structure and origin of the marginal vesicles, its affinity with the
Leptomedusz must be regarded as the closer of the two.”

ECHINODERMS.
A NEW ORDER OF HOLOTHURIOID ECHINODERMS.*

Quite a number of remarkable forms have been procured within the
last five years at great depths of the ocean in various parts of the world,
and these have been recently brought together by Hjalmar Théel in one
group, differentiated as an “ order ” closely related to the Holothurioidea.
These newly discovered forms essentially resemble the Holothurioids in
general structure. It is noted, however, that the Holothurioids are
mostly fusiform or cylindrical in shape, although some (e. g., Psolus and
Cuvieria) are most decidedly bilateral ; the radiate symmetry prevails so
far externally that the five radial ambulacral vessels and theirappendages
are generally similar, or nearly so, and run symmetrically at equal dis-
tances from one another from the anal to the apical pole, and they may
be even used indifferently for the purpose of progression; but, never-
theless, of these five ambulacra, three—constituting the trivium—are ven-
tral, and the other two—the bivium—are dorsal. While such is the rule
however the exceptions are such as to compel us to be cautious,
lest we place an undue value on deviations even much less than those
recognized as occurring in forms universally conceded to be true repre-
sentatives of the order.

In the newly discovered forms the body is always “ distinetly bilat-
eral,” (1) ‘the lateral ambulacra of the trivium bearing large, slightly
retractile pedicels, disposed either in a single row, or sometimes in two
rows, along each side of the ventral surface, and sometimes with another
series of larger highly elongated not retraetile processes placed exter-
nally and above the pedicels; pedieels of the two lateral ambulacra
symmetrically arranged, being more or less distinctly opposed across the
ventral surface” ; (2) “the odd ambulacrum naked, or very seldom with
a few rudimentary pedicels”; (3) ‘““bivium provided with very long, not
retractile processes, often disposed in one or more rows along each of its
ambulacra, and more or less distinctly opposed across the dorsal surface,
or with only a few rudimentary ones in its anterior part, or with a single
very large one resembling a broad, branched or unbranched lobe, and
near to it some small papille;” (4) there are ‘no respiratory trees;”
and (5) the integument is ‘naked, spiculous, or plated.” Such are the
characteristics common to the forms. While the ordinal value of this
type may perhaps be generally disputed, the forms are of no little in-

terest. Ten distinct genera have been differentiated and are represented
by seventeen known species. These have all been obtained in the deep sea,
at great depths. They exhibit extraordinary proportions and develop-
ment of the ambulacral appendages, and their singularities have given
rise to some remarkable generic names, as Deima (a fright), Oneiro-
phanta (a vision), Ilyodemon (ooze spirit), and Irpa and Kolga (both
names derived from the Norse mythology). ‘One group is very gelati-
nous, and of a rich purple color; others are gelatinous, gray, and semi-
transparent; while another series, and among these the most fantastic
of the whole, are yellowish, and have a crustaceous test, with a thick
layer of calcareous plates, often running ont into strangely shaped pro-
cesses. A peculiar little group from the Antarctic Sea are little more
than a gelatinous membrane, covering an enormously distended intes-
tine, filled with diatom ooze.” It is evident that the type is quite char-
acteristic of the abyssal fauna, for in most hauls of the dredge made in
very great depths forms are brought up in considerable number.

SYSTEM OF STAR-FISHES.

Mr. C. Viguier has investigated the comparative anatomy of the skel-
eton of star-fishes, and in connection therewith has applied the data
gained to the revision of the system.* He first recognizes two primary
groups, to which he gives (with doubtful propriety) the name of sub-
classes, and then divides these sub-classes into families, characterized
in the main by modifications of the frame work, as well as by the char-
acter of the odontophore, teeth, and pedicillaria.

The first sub-class includes the typical star-fishes and related types,
as the Asteriadv, Heliasterid, and Brisingidxe, which have, as common
characters, the mouth of the ambulacral type; pedicilaria pedunculate,
and straight or claw shaped, and the ambulacra generally in four rows.
The second sub-class is richest in representatives, and these have a
mouth of the adambulacral type, the pedicellaria sessile and valvular,
and the ambulacra are always biserial. Seven families are distin-
guished by the names Lehinasterida, Linckiade, Goniasteride, Asterini-
de, Pterasteride, Astropectinde, and Archasteride.

A GENERALIZED STAR-FISH. 4

A form of star-fish (using the word in its broadest sense) has been
found in the sea about Madagascar, which is remarkable for certain of
its characters, for although in truth an ophiuroid, it exhibits some fea-
tures approximating it to the asteroids. According to the describer (Mr.
W. Perey Sladen),* indeed, the characters of Asteroidea and Ophiu-
roidea are combined in singular manner. The disk is enlarged and pen-

tagonal and the rays singularly abbreviated and aborted, so that the
form is very unlike an ordinary ophiuroid. In fact the arms are for the
greater part of their length inclosed in a disk formed of calcareous
plates both above and below, but only a small portion of jointed arm
projects from each angle of the pentagon thus formed, and, with the
structure along the lines of the arms on the lower surface, reminds one
of the ophiurids. It is contended that the whole skeleton structure is
due to the abnormal development of the ordinary plates of the ophiurid,
but at the same time in the structure of the animal a number of charac-
ters are observable which tend toward the asteroids, such as a great
development of the ambulacral system, with formation of supplementary
plates separating the tentacular compartments, the extension of the peri-
toneal cavity into the radial portions of the animal, and the organiza-
tion of the mouth.

Mr. Sladen concludes with some general remarks on the characteris-
tics and relations of this new type. He argues that ‘‘ the pentagonal
flattened gonio-discoid body, combining within its area representatives
of the whole free radial system, as well as of the disk of the typical
Ophiuran, presents us with nothing less than the anomaly of an organ-
ism having ophiuroid ray-plates expanded and then consolidated along
with their disk into a pentagonal asteroid form of test. Such a re-
markable arrangement of the entire brachial series and abnormal devel-
opment of the side arm-plates is,” he says, ‘‘so far as Lam aware, quite
without a parallel amongst the Ophiuroidea, and constitutes a character
which I regard as an approach to the structure of the Asteroidea. <Al-
though it may be asserted that the resemblance is largely superficial,
and that the plates, when taken individually, are truly ophiuroid after
all, the objection is counter-balanced by the fact that this combination
of radial and interradial systems within a common periphery involves
morphologically a principle of much higher import than simply outward
form, and to which testimony is borne, more or less fully, by each of the
following particulars, that is, (1) ‘¢ the limitation of the tentacular pore-
system to the disk”; (2) ‘‘the extremely rudimentary condition and
aborted character of that portion of the radial series which is prolonged
beyond the body-disk, and which seem to give indications of disuse and
cessation of function in this area of Ophiuroid organization, followed by
a localization of function according to the plan of Asteroid organiza-
tion”; (3) ‘the extraordinary development of the tentacular or ambul-
acral system as compared with its usual standing in Ophiurian anatomy,
together with a most extreme modification of the muscular system char-
acteristic of that group,” indicating unequivocally atendency toward the
growth of Asteroid characters; (4) ‘the prolongation of the peritoneal
cavity into the radial portion of the animal,” evincing ‘a divergence
towards a structure usual in the Asteroid group”; (5) the simple and
rudimentary character of the mouth armature,” which differs from the
ophiuroid and approximates the asteroid type; and (6) “the abortea
344 ZOOLOGY.

character of the axis or internal arm-skeleton.” In fine, the charac-
teristics of the new type are such as to isolate it, at least with family
value, from all the other Ophiuroids, and this is established under the
name ‘ Astrophiuride,” by Mr. Sladen, with the following character-
istics :

The arms, with an Ophiuroid disk, included in a pentagonal body ;
the teeth absent ; the armature of the mouth simple and imperfect ; the
pores for the ambulacral feet separated by narrow septa, which are per-
pendicular to the rays; the interbrachial cavity very broad.

WORMS AND WORM-LIKE ANIMALS.

MODIFICATIONS OF WORM-TYPE.

The arrangement of worm-like animals in the systema nature has taxed
the learning and ingenuity of naturalists toa high degree, and especially
during the last quarter of a century. Within the last two years sev-
eral attempts have been submitted, exhibiting the widest diversities from
each other. Whatever may be the ultimate verdict, it is quite certain
that there is no concurrence now as to the value of the characters used
to distinguish the various groups. Asan indication of some of the tend-
encies in the taxonomy of the types in question, several of the sys-
tematic expositions are noteworthy.

Mr. A. Giard, in connection with a communication on the Orthonectids,
gives his peculiar views of the worm-like animals.*

The name VERMES is accepted as the designation of a “‘sub-kingdom”
which includes Orthonectids, Dicyemida, Trematoda, Cestoda, and Tur-
bellaria.

The name GYMNOTOCA is suggested for the “Annelida and associated
groups,” as well as the Bryozoa, and also the true Mollusca. (The
Tunicata, he thinks, ‘must be placed at the foot of the sub-kingdom
Vertebrata.”)

The designation NEMATELMIA is used for the Nematoida, Echinorhyn-
cha, Desmoscolecida, Gastrotricha, &e.

A NEW TYPE OF PARASITIC WORMS.

Surgeon-Major G. E. Dobson has recently made known a remarkable
parasitic worm found in the intestine of an African bat (Megaderma
frons). This has lately been examined by Dr. J. D. McDonald* as well
as by Surgeon Dobson. The former remarks that at first he agreed
with Surgeon Dobson in thinking that it represented a new order of
Annelids, but he is now disposed to look upon it as a new type, whose
alliance is rather with the Nematoda. Surgeon Dobson considers it as
the type of a new order of worms, which he calls Metabdellada, and
which he refers to the ‘‘Archzostomata,” among which, it is to be inter-
posed between the Rotifers and the Trematods.

THE CLASS OF ORTHONECTIDS.}

In 1877 Mr. A. Giard, of Paris, described some parasitic a 1mals of
very low organization as the constituents of a peculiar class to which he
gave the name Orthonectida. These Orthonectida present, as a perma-
nent feature of their existence, the planula-form, which is one of the em-
bryological stages of most animals. They occur as parasites in Nemer-
teans and Ophiuroids. Mr. Giard has since supplemented his original
observations and studied their reproduction. Their movements, inde-
pendent of vibratile cilia, are due to the presence of muscle-like bands
belonging to the endodermie cells and forming a splanchno-pleural
““ pseudo-mesoderm.” Reproduction is effected in two ways: (1) sex-
ually and (2) by gemmiparity. In the former course it is (a) by the for-
mation of a blastula or (b) by the production of an epibolic gastrula which
finally closes, and, in both cases, there ensues a permanent planula state
with a metamerized ectoderm. In the latter course gemmiparity super-
venes in the interior of enormous sporocysts formed by the endoderm of
the progenitve animal. It is as a result of gemmiparity that the Ortho-
nectids are met with in abundance in their host. The Orthonectids, it is
concluded, ‘are Gastreada brought by parasitism tothe state of planula,”
and their importance on the ‘Gastraea theory” is very great. (See,
also, Metschnikoff in Zool. Anzeiger, vol. ii, p. 547.)

A NEW PRIMITIVE TYPE OF WORMS.*

The genus Polygordius has been supposed to represent one of the most
primitive forms of Annelids, but in 1880 Dr. Hatschek made known a
species which seems to be still more simple in its organization, and there-
fore to exhibit the most archaic form in which the Annelidan structure
is known to exist at the present day. This new form has been named
Protodrilus Leuckarti, and was found near Messina. The inferiority of
its organization is manifest especially in the nervous system, the ven-
tral ciliary groove, the blood vascular system, and the intestine. The
muscular system resembles that of Polygordius. ‘‘ The nervous system is
difficult to make out in the living object, the ganglionic nature of the
frontal ganglion being indistinguishable and the presence of the organ
merely indicated by a thickening of the integument; the sensory organs
are represented by two transverse, elongated, ciliated slits, placed on the
dorsal surface of the anterior portion of the head. There are no pig-
mented eyes.” The intestine has no rectal division. ‘ Just behind the
mouth there opens into the cesophagus a muscular organ of a compli-
cated form, and terminating blindly in a chitinous vesicle very similar
to the same organ in Polygordius ; it has a function which still remains to
be discovered.” (Condensed from J. R. M. S., vol. ili, pp. 791-792.)

POLYGORDIUS AND ITS RELATIONS TO OTHER WORMS.

A worm-like form that has excited much interest and has been
regarded as the most primitive of Annelids is the genus Polygordius.
What is now known to be the larva of this form has been long known,
and had excited considerable speculation, but its parentage was discov-
ered but lately. Dr. Hatschek has been able to verify the develop-
mental stages of this type,t and has recognized six: (1) That prior to
segmentation, when the embryo is small and transparent, broader than
long, and divided into two parts by two parallel circlets of cilia in the
middle line, with the mouth placed between these and the arms, and
the latter opening at the inferior pole of the body, and with two eye
spots above; (2) the primitive segments of the body appear, the meso-
derm is further developed, as is also the posterior circlet of cilia; (3)
the larva becomes elongated, differentiation of the ventral cord and
antenne ensues, and aciliated pit supervenes on either side of the head,
and represents apparently the future olfactory organ ; (4) the walls of
the enteric cavity become strengthened by the apposition of the proper
division of the mesoderm, and the posterior circlet of cilia becomes
greatly developed; (5) the cuticle of the trunk becomes thicker, and the

1egion of the head becomes much more like what it will be in the adult,
while its circlets of cilia begin to disappear; (6) two distinct regions
become apparent in the head, the tentacles become prominent, the walls
of the mid-gut are considerably thickened; and there is still a mass of
rounded, indifferent cells, which appear to be the rudiments of the gen-
erative products.

Taking these different stages of development into consideration, Dr.
Hatschek indorses the view that Polygordius is an Annelid, although it
manifests many points in adult structure which are merely embryonic in
other forms. Polygordius thus represents what may be designated
Archi-Annelids or primitive Annelids, and its affiliations with the other
types are indicated as follows:

Annelides.

First order, Polygordiide.

Second order, Chwtopoda.
First suborder, Saccocinide.
Second suborder, Polycheta.
Third suborder, Oligocheta.

Third order, Hirudinea.

Fourth order, Gephyrea.

PLATYHELMINTHES.
PARASITIC PLANARIANS.

Inasmuch as extremely few parasitic Planarians have been hitherto
recognized, the discovery by Dr. von Ihering of one which occurs in the
kidney of Murex is noteworthy.* The new form has been called Graffilla
muricicola, and is easily perceptible in that organ by its reddish-brown
coloration. It attains a length of about 5 millimeters, and is distin-
guished by the development of a thick anterior and narrow tail-like
posterior region, quite distinctly marked off from each other. But the
most prominent characteristic of Graffilla is the structure of the pharnyx;
this is not provided with a special sac or pouch, and in this respect the
new form is distinguished from all similar species, and is therefore made
not only the type ofa distinct family, but a distinct group of Rhabdoceela.
These it is proposed to divide into (1) such as have a pharynx ( Pha-
ryngea), and (2) such as are deprived of a pharynx (Apharyngea). To
the former group the Graffillide belong; but, as already indicated, they
are differentiated from all the other Pharyngea by the absence of a special
pharyngeal pouch, and therefore stand in a section apart from the rest.

Another parasitic Planarian has been found by Dr. Arnold Lang in

*Thering (H. von). Graffilla muricicola, eine parasitische Rhabdocele. Zeitichs.

the foot of Tethys,* but at the same time it is conjectured that it does not
reside there permanently. This form has not been named, but has been
considered to be closely allied to Graffilla muricicola. The pharynx was
feebly developed and appeared to be destitute of a sheath. No peripheral
nerves or special organs of sense or water-vessels were observed. The
female organs were well developed; but in none of the specimens
examined could the male organs be detected except in a rudimentary

condition.
THE GROUPS OF NEMERTEAN WORMS.

The Nemertean worms have been examined with relation to their genera
and systematic relations inter se by Dr. A. A. W. Hubrecht.? Itis claimed
that the genera proposed for the European forms must be reduced to four-.
teen. These are grouped, first, into two sections, one distinguished (Hoplo-
nemertini) by the mouth being in front of the ganglia and the proboscis
furnished with stylets, and the second (nameless) by the mouth situated
behind the ganglia and the proboscis destitute of stylets. The latter are
subdivided into (1) Schizonemertini, distinguished by the development
of a deep lateral fissure on both sides of the head; and (2) Palwonem-
ertini, characterized by the absence of such fissures. The three groups
so named are designated as ‘suborders.”

The suborders are essentially the same as the three families generally
admitted, and which are much better so designated than as suborders.
The genera admitted are segregated under nine families, and are, for (1)
the Hoplonemertini, Nemertes, Oerstedia, Prosorhochmus, Tetrastemma,
Amphiporus, and Drepanophorus ; in (2) the Schizonemertini, Langia,
Cerebratulus, Borlasia, and Lineus, and in (3) the Palawonemertini,
Valencinia, Polia, Cephalothrix, and Carinella. (Condensed from J. R.
M. 8.)

The author seeks to determine the phylogeny of these forms, but
the data apparently are not sufficient for such purpose.

A PARASITIC NEMERTEAN.

More than a century ago (in 1779) O. I*. Miiller described a worm which
has, until lately, been regarded as being a kind of leech. This form
has been named Malacobdella grossa, and the specimens occur parasitic
in Oyprina Islandica. As indicated by the name, Jalacobdella is charac-
terized by a very soft body, and its width is nearly the same as the
length, except in the region of the sucker ; its muscular system is charac-
teristic; the mouth is placed at the anterior end and is a transverse
cleft; the proboscis is white, and is destitute of any armature or spines ;
the pharynx very white and visible through the transparent integument ;
the intestine narrow and dark. On account of this union of characters

by which it contrasts with all the three previously recognized families,
Von Kennel has lately proposed to isolate it as the type of an inde-
pendent one. This family (Malacobdellide) is distinguished by ‘the
dermo-muscular layer arranged in an external, circular or an internal
longitudinal layer; the absence of spines to the proboscis; the non-
development of cephalic grooves or lateral organs; the intestine simple
and forming several coils; the nerve-trunks free from the muscular
system and united posteriorly by an anal commissure, and the develop-
ment of a sucker at the posterior end.” *

CHABTOGNATHA.

RELATIONS OF THE CHATOGNATHA.

A form that derives considerable interest from the speculations that
have been entertained about it by the earlier naturalists, is the worm
group known as Sagitta, and for which the erder Chetognatha has
been instituted. An elaborate monograph of this order has been pub-
lished by Dr. Hertwig during the past year, and he has especially inquired
into the subject of its relationship with other types.t He recalls the
investigations of Kowalevsky and the application by Huxley of the
condition of the body cavity to taxonomy, and rehearses that in most
animals this ecelom is formed by a cleavage of the mesoblast (schizoceele),
and that in others—as in the Echinoderms, Brachiopods, and Amphiox-
us—the celom is developed from outgrowths of the endoblast (enter-
ocele). It is the latter type that is manifested in the Cheetognatha.
The Chetognatha are said to be most nearly related to the Nema-
toids and Annelids, and the relations to the latter are claimed to be
very remarkable. In both “ the enteron is invested in a fibrous enteric
layer, and is attached by mesenteries which completely divide the
celom into a right and left half. In both cases there are four bands of
longitudinal muscular fibers, the cells of which are derived from the
ceelomatic surface. The two transverse septa of the Chatognatha are
comparable to the numerous transverse septa in the Annelids, while,
lastly, in both groups the generative products are derived from cells of
the parietal layer of the mesoderm.” The olfactory organ is on the
upper surface of the head near the eye and behind the supra-cesophageal
ganglion, and is unpaired and very simple in character.

The nervous system is noteworthy, the chief ganglia and their nerves
being embedded in the epidermis, while some smaller cephalic ganglia
belong to the mesoderm; or, in other words, the nervous system is
differentiated into ectodermal and mesodermal parts. To the former
there are two central organs, the supra-cesophageal and the ventral
ganglia. In the latter are developed a lateral cephalic ganglion and
two other small ganglia.

The taxonomical deductions are that the Chetognatha form a group
characterized by the ‘body consisting of three segments, separated by
septa and provided with horizontal fins; the head with prehensile
hooks, spines, and a ‘cap,’ with two eyes, and an unpaired olfactory
organ; ccelom spacious: the enteron has two mesenteries and opens
in front of the aventerous caudal segment; four longitudinal muscular
bands: nervous system consists of the ventral, the supra-cesophageal,
and the lateral cephalic ganglia: trunk segment with two ovaries;
caudal segment with two testes.—In this group are recognized two
modifications of generic value, one (Sagitta) having an unpaired caudal
and two pairs of lateral fins, including ten species, and the other
(Spadella) with an unpaired caudal fin and one pair of lateral fins, in-
cluding three species. (Condensed from J. R. M. S., vol. iii, pp. 793-799.)

PERIPATIDEANS.

ON THE RELATIONS OF PERIPATUS.

Until lately there has been no difficulty in trenchantly separating the
arthropods from the vermiform articulates, but in Peripatus (a terres-
trial worm-like animal of tropical countries) we have a form that is at
once to some extent intermediate between the two, and that breaks
down the rigorous diagnoses of those great groups and forbids the neat-
ness and precision of definition formerly accorded to them. On the one
hand Peripatus possesses quite a well-developed tracheal system and
therein agrees with the terrestrial arthropods. On the other hand it
agrees with the worms in that the segment at organs are in all essential
respects like those of the Vermes and especially of the leeches, each organ
consisting of a coiled glandular tube connected at one end with a short
tube of somewhat different character, and probably opening into the
body cavity, and at the other end dilating into a vesicle that debouches
on the surface of the body at the base of the corresponding foot. Mr.
Balfour has now called attention to a new feature in the economy of the
animal which throws some light on its relationships.* There is a gland
which has a duct opening into the mouth, and which is comparable with
the salivary gland of the centipedes. (It has.generally been considered
as a,“ fat-body.”) Now, salivary glands are distinctive of the Tracheate
Arthropods, and are not at all represented in the worms; we have there-
fore in this structure of Peripatus another indication of its relationship
with the Arthropods. By recent authors Peripatus had been disting-
uished as the type of a primary group under the name Protracheata,
and the data thus indicated are worthy of attention in connection with
its place in the system.

MEROSTOMES OR PALAOCARIDS.
THE EYES OF THE HORSESHOE CRABS AND TRILOBITES.*

Professor Packard hasinvestigated the structure of the eyes of the horse-
shoe crab, and, in connection therewith, that of the corresponding organ
of the Trilobites. In the eye of the horseshoe crab (Limulus) the cor-
nea is developed as “a thinned portion of the integument”; on each side
are “nutrient” or pore canals, which are filled with connective tissue,
extending into the integument from the body cavity. Apposed to the
transparent cornea, and arranged in quincuncial order, are series of solid
conical lenses, of which the conical ends project inwards and are partly
buried in the black retina. ‘The long slender optic nerve, just before
reaching the eye, subdivides, sending a branch to each facet or cornea
impinging on the lens.” As this is a unique condition of the eyes in
living articulates, it was an interesting problem to discover whether the
affinities of the Trilobites with Limulus was manifested in this as in other
respects. Casts and natural sections of Asaphus gigas especially were
examined, and when the concave or interior surface was placed under a
magnifying power of 50 diameters, the entire surface was seen to be
rough, with the ends of the minute solid conic corneal lenses which pro-
jected into the body cavity. “This is exactly comparable with the cast
shell of Limulus and its solid corneal lenses which project into the body
cavity.”

CRUSTACEANS.
ABORTED DEVELOPMENT IN CRUSTACEANS.

It has long been recognized that while forms inhabiting the sea pass
through several stages of metamorphoses, species quite closely related,
living in fresh water, do not exhibit similar stages in their development.
The forms that so deviate from the general manifestations in the class
are always of interest, and Dr. Fritz Miiller has examined from this
point of view several Brazilian decapod crustaceans.t He found that
Trichodactylus and Aeglea Odebrechtii failed to pass through the regular
crustacean metamorphosis, and that the female of Palamon potiuna pro-
duces only 6 to 20 large eggs, and from these the young emerge with
the superficial characteristics of the adults, whose complete form they
assume at the fourth change of skin. But what is still more noteworthy
is that while Hippolyte polaris passes through a shortened phase of devel-
opment, on the other hand a Brazilian Hippolyte, closely related to that
species, was ascertained to emerge from the egg as a zo@a. Several
fresh-water shrimps also found at the mouth of the Itajahy River—a
Leander, a Palemon, and one of the Atyinw—also come from the egg as
ZO.

INSECTS.
SCOLOPENDRELLA, THE TYPE OF A NEW ORDER OF MYRIOPODS.

The genus Scolopendrelia has recently been re-examined by Mr. John
A. Ryder,* and he has found some remarkable peculiarities in its organi-
zation, which, in his opinion, entitle it to be differentiated as the repre-
sentative of a distinct order of Myriopods. The characteristics, accord-
ing to Mr. Ryder, “indicate as much affinity with insects as with myri-
opods, and may, indeed, be looked upon, perhaps, as representing the
last survival of the form from which insects may be supposed to have
descended.” The head is essentially like that of a true insect, and the
epicranial pieces are distinguished by well-marked suture from the
labrum. The labrum and labium are both well defined; mandibles and
maxille are developed, as well as, apparently, a ligula. The antenne
have numerous (14 to 28) articulations. The body proper has thirteen
segments. The legs (in number 12 or less) are five-jointed, and each
terminated by a pair of claws, as in the typical insects, and at the
bases of each pair, except the first, are attached simple hairy append-
ages. The genital orifice is on the ventral side, in the third or fourth
body segment, in both sexes. ‘The tracheal system is represented by a
series of simple tubular arches, without a spiral filament, arising from
openings on the ventral surface inside the base of the legs. Of this
combination of characteristics not the least noteworthy are the biun-
guiculate legs, and their nearly complete correspondence in number
with the rudimentary abdominal and functional thoracic limbs of the
Thysanura, especially Machelis and Lepisma, which have also basal ap-
pendages to the legs; it is these characteristics that point to the affinity
with Insects almost as intimate as that with the Myriopods. The order
thus distinguished has been named Symphyla, in reference to the singu-
lar combination of characters presented. It may be added that this
order has already been adopted by a special student of the Myriopods,
Latzel having accepted it in his lately published work on the Myrio-
pods of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Whether it will be hereatter
associated most intimately with the typical Myriopods or Insects, re-
mains to be seen; but it is at any rate certain now that these two types
cannot be retained as full classes.

INSECTS INJURIOUS TO BOOKS.

The question of injuries incurred by books from the attacks of insects
has been examined into by Dr. Hagen,t and Professor Westwcod. Repre-
sentatives of not less than six orders of Arthropods are more or less in-
jurionus.

Among the mites is the common Cheyletus eruditus, which attacks
paper in damp places.

ZOOLOGY. 353

Among the Thysanura, the Lepisma saccharina, which is found in
closets, &c., where provisions are kept, feeds also on paper, but leaves
untouched that which is covered by printing-ink. This species was not
known till lately to be at all injurious to paper or books.

Of the Neuroptera, the termites are injurious to paper and books as
well as to many other substances.

Of the Orthoptera, as is well known, the cockroaches (Blattide)
frequently commit considerable ravages.

Of the Lepidoptera the caterpillars of Aglossa pinguinalis and Depres-
saria frequently do damage by spinning their webs between the vol-
umes, and also by gnawing the paper with which they form their cocoons.

Among the beetles are several species. The Hypothenemus eruditus,
a very minute species, excavates tiny burrows within the binding. The
death-watches (Anobium pertinax and Anobium striatum) surpass in
their ravages all other species, gnawing and boring not only through
the pages of the volumes, but also through the binding. One instance
is recorded where 27 folio volumes, placed together on a shelf, had been
so completely drilled, that a string might be run through the hole made.

Asan antidote to and preventive of the attacks of these insects,
vaporization is suggested. The infected volumes may be placed in a
large glass case made as close as possible, and therein likewise may be
set small saucers containing benzine, or a sponge saturated with carbolic
acid. ‘A strong infusion of colocynth and quassia, chloroform, spirits
of turpentine, expressed juice of green walnuts, and pyroligneous acid
have also been employed successfully. Fumigation on a large scale may
also be adopted, by filling the room with fumes of brimstone, prussic acid,
or benzine ; or an infected volume may be placed under the bell-glass
of an air-pump, and extracting the air, the larve will be found to be
killed after an hour’s exhaustion.” *

DESTRUCTION OF INSECTS BY FUNGI.

It may be recalled that at the Portland (1873) meeting of the Ameri-
can Association for the Advancement of Science, Dr. Le Conte suggested
that an efficient mode of checking the devastations of the insects injuri-
ous to agriculture might be the “production of diseases” from parasitic
fungous growths. He mentioned, without particularizing, “ an instance
in which from the communication of the disease by some silk-worms, the
whole of the caterpillars in a nine-acre piece of woods were destroyed.”
The same proposition has been entertained and advocated by various
other writers, for example, Hagen, Bail, Xe.

Experiments have been made upon various forms, and lately on potato-
beetles. Those inoculated with the fungous disease died in from eight
to twelve days, while others in the same room, but which were not so

treated, lived through the winter. Plant-lice were killec. in a hot-house
hy similar means. Dr. Hagen therefore contends against Professor
Metsehnikoff, that fungous inoculation can be applied to practical uses,
end that it will not be necessary to wait tillthe scientific meaning of the
phenomena involved is understood ; he thinks that the plan has already
been successful in practice, although further experiments should be
made before any positive decision can be arrived at.

THE GLOWWORMS AND THEIR PHOSPHORESCENCE.

The structure of the Lampyride and their phosphorescent character-
istics have been examined by Rey. H. 8. Gorham.* The conclusion is
reached that ‘* the sexual instinct has played a large part in molding
the external structure of this group of beetles, and that it is to that we
must look for an adequate explanation of the development of phos-
phorescent light, though not perhaps for its origin.” The cases in which
both of the sexes have wings, and both exhibit also phosphorescent
qualities, form the larger proportion among existing species. It is con-
tended that in this condition the emission of light would be useful in
the attraction of the respective sexes and bring them together in swarms.
Those species, however, which are regarded as being the most typical
of the family and in which the parts are more specialized, are such forms
as Lamprocera and Cladodes. In these types the phosphorescent faculty
has not been developed in the same proportion as the organs generally,
and the eyes, tor example, are ‘“ reduced in a direct ratio with the light”
whenever the antenne are enlarged in inverse ratio to the diminution of
the phosphorescence. Whether the eyes develop at the expense of the
antenne, and are, so to speak, the receptacle of all the vital forces of
the head, or whether the antennze supplement the loss of the other
organs of sense, and are useful in detecting the presence of the female,
only one fact is in evidence, which is that the plumosity of the antenne,
in one case, and the enormous development of the eye, in the other, are
usually sexual characters predominating in the male, but sometimes
found in both sexes. Mr. Gorham has found that selected species of
Lampyride may be grouped under three categories, viz:

1. Species with plumose antenn, small or moderate eyes, both sexes
winged, light-emitting surface confined to one or more small spots:
Lamprocera, Cladodes, Vesta, Lucidora, Phenolis, and Megalophtialmus.

2. Species in which both sexes are winged; light emitted consider-
able, sometimes greater in the ¢ ; eyes large, sometimes excessive ;
antenne simple, usually filiform: Cratomorphus, Lucernula, Aspidasoma,
Luciola, and Photuris.

3. Species in which the female is apterous, or with rudimentary wings;
light emitted often very great in the female, and often only rudiment-

ary traces of it in the male; antenne usually rudimentary; eyes large
in the male, often excessively so, occupying nearly the whole head:

POLYZOANS.

RELATIONS OF ,THE POLYZOANS.

The Polyzoans form atype which, in the early days of zodlogy, was
regarded as a class of the radiate animals. Subsequently Milne Kd-
wards and others agreed that the type was most closely related to the
Brachiopods, and subsequent investigation of the embryology of the
two types confirmed this view. The question afterward came up as to
the relationship of both these types to others. Until quite recently
it was disputed by no one that the Brachiopods were true mollusks, but
when anatomical and morphological investigations had revealed so
many differences they were dissociated from the typical mollusks and
segregated with the Tunicates under the name Molluscoidea. Later
Morse claimed that the two classes in question were more closely related
to the worms than to the mollusks. Professor Allman has recently
reviewed the condition of our knowledge of the endoproctal Polyzoa,*
and confesses that while he still supports the molluscan relationships of
the type, he was nevertheless obliged to confess that there were features
in which it closely approximated the worms. Among the most signifi-
cant of these is the existence of a pair of symmetrically placed gland-
like organs which open on the surface of the body in Loxosoma, and
remind one of the segmental organs of the worms. In 187— Professor
Nitzsch proposed to differentiate the Polyzoans into two groups, dis-
tinguished by the opening of the anal cavity in one case outside of the
tentacular crown, and in the other case within the same. The former
group was named Letoprocta and included almost all the known forms.
The latter group was named Hndoprocta, and was at first framed spe-
cially for Pedicillina, but subsequently it was ascertained that not only
Pedicillina but Urnatella and Loxosoma also exhibited the same char-
acteristic ; and Professor Busk has lately made known a curious form,
to which he has given the name Ascopodaria, found in the voyage of
the Challenger in deep water. It is the Endoprocta, according to Pro-
fessor Allman, that exhibit the closest connection with the vermes.
Loxosoma, it may be added, is a parasite of Gephyreans, and attaches
itself so firmly to the host that before Zoxosoma had been described Mr.
A. M. Norman was led thereby to attribute its crown toa Gephyrean as
tentacular appendages of the tail of that worm.

BRACHIOPODS.
RANGE IN DEPTH OF LIVING BRACHIOPODS.

Mr. Thomas Davidson has examined the collection of Brachiopods
secured by H. M.S. Challenger, and in connection therewith has enu-
merated all the existing species of the class.* It was thought that
many novel forms would be obtained by the dredge from the depths of
the sea, but this anticipation has not been realized. Very few new
species were found during the voyage of the Challenger, and none rep-
resenting genera that had not before been known from representatives
living in waters of less depth. One hundred and thirty-six living spe-
cies or sub-species are recognized by Mr. Davidson, 125 so-termed “spe-
cies,” and 11 “named varieties”; but, it is added by Mr. Davidson, the
number “ will certainly have to be hereafter reduced.” Not more than
31 species were obtained by the Challenger expedition, and out of 361
stations at which dredgings were made Brachiopoda “ were brought up
38 or 59 times only.” The circumstances respecting the discovery of 107
of the recognized named forms have been ascertained, while ‘nothing is
known respecting the ranges of depths of some 25 or 26 so-called spe-
cies.” Of the 107 species (or “named varieties) some 57, or about half
the known species, were dredged at a depth of under 100 fathoms; 20 to
25 at low-water mark, or from 5 to 10 fathoms; and the remainder at
about 50 or 60 fathoms,” or, to be more definite, the status of our infor-
mation may be given in the following table:

Mr. Davidson concludes that “these facts indicate that the greater
bulk of known species live at comparatively small or moderate depths,
few in depths ranging up to 500 fathoms, and that Brachiopoda are
specifically rare at depths varying from 500 to 2,900 fathoms.

It is to be regretted that Mr. Davidson still clings to the names Clis-
tenterata and Tretenterata when exactly the same groups with the same
limits, and the same essential diagnoses, had received each several names
long before. If any objections are urged against those previous names,

analogous objections can readily be devised against those adopted, and
there is nothing easier than to devise objections when the mood impels
to seek for new names.

ANCIENT LINGULIDZ.

In the early days of Paleontology the name Lingula was applied as
the generic designation of numerous species certainly related to the
living representatives of that genus but distinct in many respects. Of
late years, however, as is remarked by Mr. Whitfield,* “it has been
supposed by many that the Brachiopodous genus Lingula, as represented
by Lingula anatina Lamarck, a living species, was not represented
among the fossil Lingulidae of the older Paleozoic formations, if any-
where in rocks of paleozoic age; and there has been a growing tend-
ency to class all Linguloid shells of ‘these formations under other
names.” While this is admitted to be correct in the main, by Mr. Whit-
field, he thinks that he has proof of a form congeneric with or at least
closely related to the modern species, in shells obtained from the Tren-
ton limestones of Wisconsin and Minnesota. He has carefully studied
the muscular and vascular sears of the shell as copied in their internal
casts, and thinks that ‘‘these markings correspond more nearly to those
of L. anatina Lamarck, than do those of any other Silurian or Devonian
species” which he ever examined, and, “although they do not exactly
correspond, still are as similar as one could expect in widely separated
species. The variations consist in the position of the various muscular
scars, and also somewhat in the lines of the pallial sinuses and in the
ramifications of their branches.” Without going into detail it is enough
to remark that there certainly seems to be considerable superficial
resemblance between the form thus signalized and the living represent-
atives of the family. Nevertheless the homologies are far from being
as close as those which prevail in all the living forms, and which, not-
withstanding, have been differentiated under two distinct genera,
Lingula and Glottidia. In view of the great antiquity of the type,
however, even the resemblance, though not very close, is noteworthy.
Whether the resemblance is a generic one (using the word “generic” in
the restricted signification) is doubtful.

GASTROPODS.
A NEW TYPE OF MOLLUSKS.

A most singular type of Mollusks, and one finding no place in the
current works on conchology, is the genus Neomenia of Tullberg (Soleno-
pus D. & K.). This is the representative of not only a distinet family
comeutd)) but of a group which stands so far apart from all others

stones. Am. Jour. Science (3), vol. xix, pp. 472-475.

as to leave even its relationship a matter of discussion. G.O. Sars dis
tinguishes it as a group (Telobranchiata) of the Opisthobranchiates,
co-ordinate with the Tectibranchiata and Nudibranchiata. H. von
Thering differentiates it as a class of “* Vermes—Phylum Amphineura,”
the Chitons forming another class. E. Ray Lankester isolates it still
further, considering it as representing not only a class (Scolecomorpha)
but a primary group (Lipoglossa) of Mollusks having no affinity to the
Chitons. A new form of this group, exhibiting characters, too, deemed
wanting in the type, must be of unusual interest. Such is the species
made known as Proneomenia Sluiteri.* Like Neomenia, Proneomenia is
worm-like and subeylindrical, but unlike that form it is provided with a
distinct though small radula. Two specimens of the species were
dredged by Dr. Sluiter in the Barent Sea.

REGENERATION OF PARTS IN GASTROPODS.

Long ago Spallanzari and afterwards Schifter experimented upon the
regeneration of parts in snails, but this subject has since been much
neglected. Recently Mr. Justus Carriere has reinvestigated the ques-
tiont, and has found, like his predecessors, that the tentacles, with the
eyes and the labial processes in the gastropods, can be completely
regenerated. On the otherhand, when the pharynx or supra-cesopha-
geal ganglion is cut out death ensues. Mr. Carriére took all precau-
tions in his investigations, and all the conditions to insure accuracy
were fulfilled, that is, with respect to the health of the animal, the
parts removed, &c., for a different result would ensue if the animal was
taken when its energy was concentrated in the formation of generative
products, and it was therefore found that a season of rest, as at the
beginning of summer, or the autumn season, was the most satisfactory
time. The individuals experimented upon represented common Euro-
pean species of Helix. Those that gave the most satisfactory result
were Helix nemoralis and H, hortensis ; H. pomatia was more sensitive,
and H. arbustarum and H. fruticum the least capable of reproduction of
parts.

In the case of the eye it was ascertained that the method of regener-
ation was analogous to that of the first formation of the organ. There
was an invagination of the epithelium, the formation of a closed vesicle,
and the primitive cylindrical cells became partly converted into corneal
cells, and partly into rods and cones. The time required for this re-
generation was fifty or sixty days.

Experiments were also instituted with respect te the aquatic pulmon-
ates, but the results were less satisfactory on account of their liability
to attack by fungus in the wounds.

GASTROPTERON AND ITS RELATIONS.

A remarkable form of gastropod mollusk, which was at one time sup-
posed to bea Pteropod, has now been well ascertained to be a Tecti-
branchiate and most closely related to the Bullidea. In general form it
has, in fact, considerable resemblance to a Pteropod, and the shell is so
small and immersed that it was not detected until ‘Krohn found it in
1860. The shell resembles somewhat that of a Carinaria in form, and is
quite translucent: it is found in the hepatic region near and somewhat
behind, but a little to the right side of, the anus.

Mr. Vayssiere has investigated the anatomy of this form, and has
reached, in respect to its relation, some conclusions diitering from his
predecessors.* He regards Gastropteron as the type of one of two major
groups, into which he would divide the Bullidea, most of the forms of
that type constituting the second group.

In this first group represented by Gastropteron the parapodia are
largely developed: a small nautiloid shell is contained within the
mantle; and the cesophageal collar is constituted by a pair of cerebral
ganglia, a pair of pedal ones, and six visceral ones; the visceral ganglia
are distributed in equal number, three to the right and three to the left.

In the second division the parapodia are rudimentary ; the shell well
developedeand generally external; and there are only three visceral
ganglia, two of which are on the right and one on the left side.

It is observed also that while in Gastropteron the genital nerve arises
directly from the commissure without the intermediation of any gan-
glionic enlargement, in the other forms the corresponding nerve always
arises from the larger of the two left visceral ganglia.

LIVING PLEUROTOMARIIDS.

Among the most interesting of the mollusks is the genus Pleuroto-
maria. ‘This genus was for a long time supposed to have become entirely
extinct, but in 1856 a species was discovered at the island of Guade-
loupe and named by Fischer and Bernardi Pleurotomaria Quoyana. Sub-
sequently a specimen of a second species was also obtained and described
under the name of Pleurotomaria Adansoniana in 1861. In 1850 further
intormation respecting the development of the genus was obtained. A
second specimen of Pleurotomaria Adansoniana (J1 millimeters wide) was
found in the “ grand cul de sac de la Point-a-Pitre,” Guadeloupe, at a
depth of 150 fathoms, and two new species were obtained in the Eastern
seas. One has been described by Hilgendorf as Pleuwrotomaria Beyrichii,
from a specimen obtained in Japan. Another has been made known as
Pleurotomaria Rumpfii by Schepman, and the specimen on which it was
based (a very large one, having a maximum diameter of 190 millimeters)
was found in a collection of shells from the Molucca Islands belonging

to the Zoological Garden of Rotterdam. It is noteworthy that these
species represent two sections of the genus, one of the species of Gua-
deloupe (P. Quoyana) and one of the eastern (P. Beyrichii) having no
umbilicus, while the other two, Plewrotomaria Adansoniana and P.
Rumpfii are deeply umbilicated. The soft parts of Plewrotomaria are
still unknown, although we may hope that our acquaintance with a form
so interesting may not be much longer deferred, inasmuch as a living
specimen of P. Quoyana was obtained by Professor Agassiz off the island
of Barbados (at a depth of 120 fathoms), and is now in the Museum of
Comparative Anatomy at Cambridge. (See HILGENDORF in Sitzungs-
berichte der Gesellschaft Naturf. Freunde zu Berlin, 1879, p. 72; SCHEP-

DENTITION OF MARGINELLOID MOLLUSKS.

The contour and development of the shell of Marginella is quite char-
acteristic, but nevertheless there are now known four distinct types of
dentition represented by forms possessing decidedly similar shells, and
if the Eratoinz are considered, we have a fifth.

(1.) As is generally known, most of the species have a single central
tooth (o—1—o) with a narrow base, and this has been regarded as
being one of the distinctive marks of the family Marginellide.

(2.) A similar form, however, was shown a number of years ago, by
Stimpson, to have a single row of teeth peculiarly modified, resembling
those of the Muricinz, being thick, strong, and armed with many (7) den-
ticles, and was theretore differentiated by him as the type of a peculiar
family—Cystiscide.

(3.) Towards the end of the year 1880 a third type was found to be
represented by what has been called Pseudomarginella leptopus, and what
has been also by some (but erroneously) identified with the “ Marginella
glabella,” of Kastern Africa. Shells with their animals were sent from
Senegambia, and the species was ascertained to have the teeth arranged
in three long longitudinal rows, (1—1—1), and their form very similar
to that of the Buccinids, the lateral teeth being broad and armed with
three cusps.

(4.) A fourth marginelliform type has aiso teeth in three series
(1—1—1), but the lateral teeth are slender and claw-like. The species
representing this has been described by Carriere as new under the
name Pseudomarginella platypus, and thus systematically arranged with
the preceding, with which it is geographically associated. The difference
in dentition is, however, generally regarded as of family value.

(5.) Still another marginelloid type, although much more differen-
tiated than any of the others, is represented by Hrato, which is now
generally regarded as a true member of the family of Cypreide: or Tri-
viidee.
ZOOLOGY. 361

The manifestation of such different types of dentition by forms hav-
ing the same kind of shell will render a re-examination of the other
parts of the animal necessary before it can be definitely accepted whether
they are distantly related, as the current views respecting the value of
dentition would imply, or whether they are closely connected, as the like-
ness of their shells would suggest. In this connection we may refer to
the similarity of the shells of the Mitridwe and Turritida. While it is
not safe to assume that the animals so distinguished are closely related
on account of the similarity of their shells, there is enough at least to
challenge doubt, which can only be settled by further investigations.
(See Crosse & FIscHER in Journ. Conchyliologie (3,) vol. xx, p. 379,

Maltzan), in Zool. Anz., vol. iii, pp. 637-641, 27 Dec., 1880.)

HPHALOPODS.

THE ARMS AND SIPHON OF CEPHALOPODS.

A number of attempts have been made to homologize the arms and
siphon of the cephalopods with the structures of the gastropods, but
the identifications have not been entirely satisfactory. Professor Loven,
as early as 1848, regarded the cephalopod arms as a persistent
velum. Professor Huxley considered that they represented the gastro-
pod foot, and the siphon was regarded as answering to the epipodial folds
of the embryonic gastropod. Dr. Grenacher, however, showed that the
foot of the gastropod is an unpaired structure, and therefore could not be
homologous with the arms, which develop in pairs, and, like Loven, he
considered that the arms represent a modified velum; the foot was
deemed to be entirely wanting, while the siphon was regarded as the
representative of the epipodium. Dr. Von Ihering contended that the
arms are tentacular appendages to the body, and that they have no
equivalent in the gastropods. The innervation of the siphon from the
pedal ganglion led him to identify the siphon as the foot, and he urged
that the valve of the siphon is a true foot or protopodium, and the two
lateral folds pteropodia.

In 1879 Mr. J. I. Blake entered upon a comparison of the cephalopod
and gastropod structures with reference to their relation to the nervous
ganglia and the flexure of the intestine.* Premising that the ciliated
bands constituting the velum had been shown to be traceable ‘from one
class to another—sometimes in the larva only, and sometimes as an
adult organ ”—he concludes as follows: ‘In the primitive condition they
formed a circle around the cesophagus, and as often as not are thrown
out into long processes; with a change in the direction of the intestine
their uniformity is broken and part dies away, while the other ‘part is
left, forming a circle surrounding, not the cesophagus, but a portion of
the body on one side of it, the foot being on the other. Since, then, in the
gastropoda the intestine turns to the cerebral side, we have the “ velum”

formed on that side; whereas in the cephalopoda, the flexure being on
the opposite side, we have what we may call the anti-velum on the pedal
side. Thus the arms are homologous to the opposite portion of the
architroch to that which forms a velum, and merely afford another in-
stance in which these primitive formations are retained as functional
organs. Moreover, from within the circle of the embryonic velum rise
np in some gastropods two long retractile tentacles in like manner
from within the later-formed circle of the anti-velum rise up the two
retractile tentacles of the decapods.” The funnel is conceded to be
homologous with the epipodium, and the valve in the funnel it is sug-
gested “may represent” the foot, although this ‘‘must be doubtful.”

Dr. Brooks has also treated of the same questions, and studied
the development of the common squid (Zoligo Pealii).* He recalls
that the molluscan foot is an unpaired structure on the ventral surface
of the body between the mouth and the anus; that in the embryo a large
sinus space separates the integument of the foot from the endoderm and
its derivatives; and that this space contains blood corpuscles; that the
embryonic foot, in fact, is a circulatory organ. The yolk sack of the
cephalopod is separated from the yolk by a corresponding sinus space,
and as the integument is rhythmically the fluid which fills this space is
kept in constant motion. Physiologically then, as well as in its posi-
tion, the yolk sack of the squid resembles the foot of the gastropod, and
consequently it is contended that we find in it the homologue of the foot.
He concludes that as a locomotor organ the foot of the cephalopod has
been suppressed by the great development of a food-yolk at the point
where it should have been found.” As to the siphon, this originates as
two pairs of folds of the integument of the lateral walls of the body, and
if we regard these four folds as homologous with the epipodial folds of
a gastropod, the arms must be regarded as independently acquired
structures. It is finally inferred that neither the exact equivalent of the
arms nor of the siphon is found in the gastropods, but that tiese parts
of the cephalopods have originated from a very generalized condition
and become developed as specialized organs peculiar to the class; con-
versely, the foot of the gastropods is represented by no specialized struct-
ure in the cephalopods.

COMPARATIVE STRUCTURES OF THE TETRABRANCHIATE AND
DIBRANCHIATE CEPHALOPODS.

As a part of his studies on the “homologies of the cephalopoda,” Mr.
Blake has examined into the structures which seem to correspond in the
nautiloids and euttle-fishes. The tetrabranchiates are undeniably a
more primitive and generalized type than the dibranchiates, and in their
adult condition exhibit characteristics which are transitory in the other.
Thus (1) in the nautilus the funnel is divided, and so it is in the embryo

cuttle-fish, but in the old it is a single tube; (2) in nautilus the eye is a
simple cavity opening externally by a minute aperture, as is the case in
the embryo cuttle; (5) in nautilus the auditory organs are close beneath
the eyes, and so they are in the embryonic cuttle, but in the mature
dibranchiates they have approximated on the ventral side; (4) in nau-
tilus the tentacular and labial processes are more or less flattened and
lie one within the other, and in analogous manner in the dibranchiates
the arms rise as broad flat processes, one pair within the others. Mr.
Blake contends (with Valenciennes) that the processes (six or eight)
from which the tentacles originate in nautilus are homologous with the
arms of the cuttle-fishes, and that the tentacles are homologous with the
suckers. The aptychus-bearing “hood” of the nautilus may be homolo-
gous either with the anterior port of arms of the dibranchiates (the ar-
gonaut thereby secretes its shell) or with the ‘‘neck-plates” just behind
the eyes and in front of the “bone” of Sepia, or the generalized basis
of both; but this the embryology of nautilus must determine. The shell
of nautilus it is thought may be represented in the dibranchiates by
the shell of Spirula, the phragmacone of a Belemnite, and the mucro of
a Sepia-bone. The ink-bag which is developed late in the embryological
history of the cuttle-fishes does not exist at all in nautilus.

THE CEPHALOPODS OF EASTERN NORTH AMERICA.*

In the earlier works upon the mollusks of the eastern coast of North
America only three or four species were recorded, and until within the
last few years that coast was supposed to have few inhabitants repre-
senting that class. Since the institution of the labors of the Fish Com-
mission, however, a number of new forms have been made known, and
some of them represent new genera. Among the most noteworthy are
species of gigantic cuttle-fish, of which quite a large number of speci-
mens have now been discovered in various places on the Great Banks,
and around or near the island of Newfoundland. The following are
all the species that have been made known as inhabitants of the north-
eastern coast of the United States to the end of 1880.

NOMENCLATURE OF LIMB SEGMENTS.

In connection with an article on the Ichthyosaurian Sauranoaon (sub-
sequently renamed Baptanodon),* Professor Marsh has proposed a new
nomenclature for “the corresponding segments alike of the anterior
and posterior limbs of the air breathing vertibrates.” Recalling that
the terms “ phalanges” and ‘“metapodials” had already been applied
and obtained general currency for the distal segments, he proposed to
complete the nomenclature as follows :

Anterior. Posterior.
Propopodial bones... -. eS es soso A UMMELUS; Femur.
Epipodial bones....-...- .-----.-Radius and ulna. ‘Tibia and fibula.
Mesopodial bones. ...-...... eos Ounpals, Tarsals.

THE SEMICIRCULAR CANALS OF VERTEBRATES.

Dr. Francis Derecum has investigated the morphology of the semi-
circular canals in the vertebrates.t He recalls the fact that the structure
of the mucous canals and of the semicircular canals is very similar, as
Leydig, in 1850, had already observed. Deeming this analogy complete
he asks, ‘Would it now be too hazardous to suggest that the two
organs which are so closely related in structure and which present
such significant facts as regards nerve supply and embryological devel-
opment, are related genetically? Such specialization would not be in-
consistent. Let us see how it may have been brought about. In an
organism provided with a general apparatus for the perception of vibra-
tions, evidently the first thing that would take place would be the
specialization of certain portions for certain classes of vibrations. This
is what may have been the case with the lateral canals and the ear,
each being a specialization in its own peculiar direction. The fact that
the involution of the side organs in Teleosts does not take place until
the organism is already far advanced towards the completion of its
development, and the fact that the mucous canal in the embryo of
Elasmobranchs does not appear until the epiblast has been differentiated

into its two layers, both imply that the side organs had for ages ex-
isted as mere “nerve hills,” or nerve epithelium, projecting into the
water, and this renders our idea not only possible but probable. In
the course of evolution of the ear, the first differentiation of structure
that occurred may have been as follows: Certain of these areas of
nerve epithelium or sensory macule may, for functional specialization
have become inclosed in canals. Now, for still greater specialization,
the whole area containing the canals, with perhaps one or two macule
not yet inclosed, may have undergone a general process of involution,
and thus given rise to the vestibule and semi-circular canals.”

FISHES, ETC.
NOTEWORTHY WORKS, ETC,

The classes of Leptocardians, Marsipobranchiates, Selachians, and
Fishes are still so generally considered together under the old designa-
tion of Ichthyology that it is convenient in practice for the present at
least to recognize this grouping. The number of men deserving of scien-
tific consideration who would now refuse the term of classes to at least
three of those groups, however, is very small.

Among the general works on ‘ Ichthyology,” thus understood, that
have been published during the past year or two, are “An Introduction
to the Study of Fishes,” by Dr. A. Giinther, and parts relative to Ich-
thyology of the general works on natural history of Brehm’s “ Allge-
meine Kunde des Thierreiches; and Cassell’s Natural History (by H. G.
Seeley). The influence of Dr. Giinther is exhibited not only in his own
work, but in the others noticed, and it is with regret that we have to
add that influence has been for evil and to propagate and continue in-
definitely some of the most unsound ideas and systematic essays that
have emanated from any worker in zoology.

The geographical distribution of fishes in general has been treated of
by L. Tillier. The species collected by the Challenger expedition have
in part (the shore fishes) been enumerated, and the new ones described
and illustrated, by A. Giinther; Arctic species have been reported on
by R. Collet, C. Liitken, and T. Bean; North American species have
been described by D. 8. Jordan, C. H. Gilbert, G. B. Goode, E. D. Cope,
W. N. Lockington, &c.; those of South America by F. Steindachner ;
Australian species by Castelnau, H. Jouan, C. B. Klunzinger, We. ;
African species by C. Dambeck, &e.

The transformations which fishes undergo after exclusion from the
egg have been studied by C. Liitken and C. Emery.

The temperature of the blood in a considerable number of species has
been ascertained by J. R. Kidder. His observations are noteworthy on
account of the modifications which they necessitate in the statements
respecting these animals current in the books.
366 ZOOLOGY.

The anatomy of fishes has received attention from many investigators,
among whom are Olga Metschnikoff, M. von Davidoff, and G. Swirski,
who have treated of the shoulder and pelvic girdles in whole or part; A.
Cisow, who has studied the ear; G. Carlet, who has examined the scales;
and M. Ussow, who has sought to explain the function of the “‘eye-spots”
on the sides of scopelids and other types; Ad. von La Valette St. George,
who has elucidated the adipose fin, and J. E. V. Boas, who has dissected
the heart and contiguous parts in Butirinus and related fishes.

Certain groups have also received special attention. Omitting all
reference to work on the Teleosts, Petromyzon has been anatomized by
ht. Weidersheim and J. E. V. Boas; the Selachians have been investi-
gated by G. B. Ercolani, C. Hasse, 8. M. Garman, and H. Rabl Ruckhard;
the osteology of Polyodon has been described by T. W. Bridge, and the
embryology of Lepidosteus by A. Agassiz. Fossil fishes have been
described by E. D. Cope, J. W. Davis, and R. H. Traquair.

ORIGIN OF SOUNDS PRODUCED BY FISHES.*

Many fishes are known to emit sounds of various kinds, and among
those inhabiting the United States are the drum-fish and other scie-
nids as well as the catfishes. As to the drum-fish a recent writer (Dr.
Giinther, “ Introduction to the Study of Fishes,” p. 427) has assuined that
‘a tremulous motion” is communicated to vessels, and that the noise is
probably “produced by the fishes beating their tails against the bottom
of the vessel in order to get rid of parasites.” This remarkable hypoth-
esis renders exact observations noteworthy. The subject has received
attention from several naturalists, and among them Mr. W. Sérensen,
who has communicated to the French Academy of Sciences an abstract
of a memoir which is to be published in full in the “ Naturhistorisk
Tidsskrift,” of Copenhagen. Mr. Sdrensen’s observations were made on
South American Characinids and Silurids. ‘“Thesound is produced by
the action of the muscles which are inserted either directly in the swim-
ming-bladder or upon the transverse apophyses of the third vertebra.
In the Characini the elastic parts of the swimming-bladder are stretched
in the direction of their length by the contraction of the muscles, and
the vibration that results from this rhythmic movement is transmitted
to the air contained in the cavity of the swimming-bladder. In the
Siluroids the anterior portion ef the swimming-bladder is drawn alter-
nately forward and backward by the contraction and relaxation of the
muscles. During these movements the air in passing across the incom-
plete transverse septa sets the latter in vibration, and the sound is pro-
duced. The height, or rather the depth, of the sound is in direct propor-
tion to the rapidity of the vibrations of the springs,”—the ‘‘ springs”
being the transverse apophyses of the vertebrie.

THE FUNCTIONS OF THE AIR-BLADDER.

The physiological relations of the swimming-bladder of fishes have
been considered by Professor Marangoni, in a special communication to
the French Academy of Sciences.* Some of the views enunciated were
quite novel; whether they are entirely tenable remains to be seen. (1)
It was contended that one of the principal results of the development
of the bladder was exhibited in the migration of fishes; those destitute
of that organ do not leave bottoms of little depth where there is tepid

rater, while those possessing it, which live in deep, cold water, periodi-
cally seek the warmer surface water to deposit their ova. (2) If living
and dead fishes are placed in a vessel three-quarters full of water, and
the air be then compressed, it is seen that the dead fish fall downward
while the living ascend toward the surface, but if the air is rarefied the
contrary is the result. They suffer from the passive influence due to
hydrostatic pressure, and when brought from great depths the bladder
is often ruptured. (3) The development of the bladder entails on the
fish a double instability: (a) that of level, and (b) that of position. (a)
A fish with its bladder adapted to the conditions existing at a certain
depth may, through variation in pressure, be forced either upwards or
downwards, and is thus in unstable equilibrium as to level. (b) The
bladder being in the abdomen below the vertebral column, the centre
of gravity is above the centre of pressure, and the animal is consequently
constantly liable to inversion, and such inversion, in fact, results when
inaction or death supervenes. This two-fold instability compels fishes
to a constant gymnastic movement, and probably tends to conserve
their strength and agility.

TEMPERATURE OF FISHES.

It has been generally asserted that the temperature of fishes was little
above that of the surrounding element, except in the case of certain forms,
such as representatives of the mackerel tribe—the tunny, bonito, &e.—
which have been stated to haveatemperature of 90° F. when the surround-
ing medium was 80.59. This statement has, however, been challenged,
and Dr. Kidder availed himself of the opportunities offered him wlile
attached as surgeon to the United States Fish Commission steamer in
1879, to institute investigations upon the subject.+ All the observations
previously made, according to Dr. Kidder, had been confined to the intesti-
nal canal, the thermometer being placed into the reetum or esophagus.
It is, however, by no means in either extremity of the intestinal canal
that we should look for the body temperature of a fish. In point of
fact the experiments show clearly enough that the rectum temperature

rarely exceeds that of the water in which the fish swims by so much as
a degree, ‘‘so that it may be quite safely taken as an index to the latter
temperature when there is no deep-sea thermometer at hand.”

The experiments of Dr. Kidder were made not only in the rectum and
stomach, but in various parts of the muscular tissues, the large venous
trunks, the cavity of the thorax after opening the heart, the interior of
the heart, and branchial artery, and the young fish intheovary. Although
Dr. Kidder admits the results to be only tentative, he considers that
enough has been ascertained to show that fishes do develop animal heat
by their own vital processes in the same manner, but in a less degree,
as do the higher vertebrate animals, and that they will be found to mani-
fest a temperature much above the water in which they swim. The
temperature, however, varies according to the organization and the
species. Thus the dog-fish (Squalus acanthias), in common with other
sharks, ‘‘ possessing a far more perfect digestive and circulatory sys-
tem than the cod, shows a much greater excess of blood tempera-
ture above that of the surrounding water; and cod taken at the depth
of 15 fathoms in water at 52° F.. show a less excess than others taken
in 25 fathoms at 41° F., but a greater excess than blue-fish (Poma-
tomus saltatrix (Linn.) Gill) taken at the surface, at 69° and 70°, which
is presumably nearer the normal temperature of the last-named fish.”

Ninety-seven fishes, representing 16 species, were experimented upon
by Dr. Kidder, and, throwing out doubtful and imperfect observations,
the following is a summary of the results:

of reproduction in the male as well as female of teleost fishes.* The

tion of the eggs upon the surface of the lamelle. As these differences
will prove of interest to the systematist and pisciculturist, the analytical

THE FLIGHT OF FLYING-FISHES.

The characteristics of the flight of flying-fishes have been much dis-
cussed and have given rise to a considerable controversial literature.
In 1878, Prof. Carl Mobius re-examined the question from an anatomical
and physiological as well as an observational basis, and gave his views
in quite an elaborate memoir.* both the Exocetines and Dactylop-
terines were considered. As a result of his studies Professor Moébius
came to the conclusion that the pectoral fins are not at all actively
employed during flight; that the fishes “do not raise themselves, but
are passively raised by the ascending currents of air, which are caught in
the grooves on the under surface of their pectoral fins.” It is admitted,
however, that either an exocetus or dactylopterus may “make powerful
and plainly recognizable movements with its tail and pectorals during
its ascent (out of water), and even occasionally in the middle of its course,
if prompted thereto by astrong wetting of the body by the waves.” These
opinions have been challenged lately, and have provoked several com-
munications.

Mr. C. O. Whitman} made special observations in the flight of Exoceti

during a voyage from San Francisco to Yokohama, and maintains (1)
that he saw them out of water ‘‘ when the air was almost motionless” and
that, in fact, “they were not much, if at all less numerous on such occasions
than when there was a moderate wind”; (2) that the flapping move-
ment is quite regular and very rapid ; and (3) that this movement “ may
be continued” for the whole or a part of the flight, but is generally discon-
tinued after the first few rods, and the course completed by a pure
skimming or sailing movement.” Itis further claimed that “the course
of the flight is generally in a straight or curved line,” but is sometimes
abruptiy changed, “apparently by the aid of the tail,” or rather the lower
lobe of the caudal fin. The average flight, it is thought, ‘‘does not per-
haps exceed fifteen seconds, nor extend above four or five hundred feet”;
the longest observed “lasted not less than forty seconds, and its extent
was undoubtedly over eight hundred feet, and may have exceeded twelve
hundred feet.”

Prof. D. S. Jordan also carefully examined the flight of an Hxocetus
(H. calijornicus) in the waters of Southern California.* He observed it
best ‘*in early morning when both air and water were free from motion.”
* On rising from the water the movements of the tail are continued for
some seconds until the whole body is out of water. While the tail is in
motion the pectorals are in a state of very rapid vibration, and the
ventrals are folded. When the action of the tail ceases, the pectorals
and ventrals are spread, and, as far as we can see, held at rest. When
the fish begins to fall, the tail touches the water and the motion of the
pectorals recommences, and it is enabled to resume its flight, which it
finally finishes by falling in the water with a splash.” The flight was
thought to sometimes extend to “nearly a quarter of a mile.”

AFFINITIES OF PLEURACANTHUS.t

Inthe Carboniferous and Permian deposits have been found the remains
of fishes described under the name of Pleuracanthus, whose affinities
have been involved in considerable doubt. They have been mostly re-
ferred to the Selachians, although suggestions have been made that
they may belong rather to the Teleosts. The question has lately been
reopened by Mr. James W. Davis, and he has come to the conclusion
that they claim a nearer relationship to the Teleosts than to the Elasmo-
branchs, although there is equal reason to believe that they possess
many characteristics in common with the Sharks and Rays, and he
is therefore led to place the genus in an intermediate position between
the two. The affinities he thinks are decidedly on the side of the Silu-
roids, and it is reasonable, he thinks, to consider them as forerunners of
that great group of fishes.

‘“‘It remains,” he says, ‘‘to be seen what were the successive steps in

ZOOLOGY. 371

development which have resulted in the completely ossified and highly
organized Siluroids now existing.”

.We give these results of Mr. Davis’ investigation on account of the
importance of the question involved, but it seems best to add that there
can be no close relationship between the Teleosts and the Selachians,
and that the question as to the relationship of the paleeozoic fishes can
only be ascertained after the examination of specimens in a far more
satisfactory condition than any that have yet been found.

THE PLATYSOMIDS AND PALAZONISCIDS.

Two of the most frequently occurring groups of fishes occurring in the
paleozoic formation are the Paleoniscide and the Platysomide. The
affinities of these types have been but little understood heretofore, and
Dr. R. H. Traquair has therefore been led to a re-examination of the
subject.* He has reached the following conclusions:

“1. That the Platysomide are specialized forms, which have, if the
doctrine of descent be true, been derived from the Paleoniscide. Their
structure presents us simply with a modification of the Palzoniscoid
type; and wherever the Paloniscide are placed in the system, thither
the Platysomidz must follow.

“2. The resemblances between the Platysomidz and the Dapediidie
and Pycnodontide are mere resemblances of analogy and not of real

affinity. The Dapediide are related not to the Paleoniscide or Platy-
somide, but to the other semiheterocercal Ganoids of the Jurassic era
(Lepidotus, &c.); and the Pycnodonts are higly specialized forms, whose
general affinities point in the same direction.”

Professor Traquair concludes that the Palwoniscide and Platysomidie
belong to the “‘Acipenseroid sub-order of Ganoids.”

The characters ascertained to distinguish the Platysomide and Pal-
ceoniscide scarcely appear to warrant the conclusions of Professor Tra-
quair. Professor Cope, indeed, has been led by the consideration of
Professor Traquair’s studies to a very different result, and one approx-
imating, apparently, more to nature. Copet has proposed to differentiate
the forms in question as representatives of ‘a distinct group of the same
rank as those [he has] called orders,” and given to it the name Lysopteri.
They are defined as ‘‘actinopterous fishes, with the median fin-rays not
joined to the interhzemal and interneural bones, and not coinciding with
them in number; and without suboperculum.”

for a long time involved in obscurity, but many data have been accu-
mulated within the last few years, and now we have the elements for ¢
pretty satisfactory determination of the sexes. The ova and milt have
beep found by several investigators, and the last statement is that the
individuals of the two sexes may be distinguished by external character-
istics. In the female eel the snout is comparatively narrow, and a very
considerable size is sometimes attained. In the male eel the snout is
notably broader, and the length attained rarely exceeds 19 or 20 inches.
The eggs of eels when mature are only about one-tenth of a millimeter
in diameter, and there are several millions in the ovary of a moderate-
sized individual. It is now well determined that they go to the sea, and
there the sexual organs are developed, and in comparatively deep water
the ova are deposited and fecundated. The young in due time ascend the
rivers. The eel is thus an example of a catadromous fish—that is, one
descending from the fresh water into the sea to breed ; and thus contrasts
with the salmon, shad, &e., which are anadromous—that is, ascending
from the sea into fresh water to breed.

PLEURONECTIDS WITHOUT PECTORALS.

As is well known, some of the Soleids are more or less deficient in
pectoral fins, and one genus has been named on account of the total
absence of these members Achirus. Until lately, however, no Plewro-
nectids, in the restricted sense of the term, were known to be destitute
of the fins. There nevertheless seem to be quite a number of forms be-
longing to the family inhabiting waters of considerable depth in which
the pectorals are reduced, or may be even almost entirely wanting.
Several types show gradations in that the fins in question are less de-
veloped and that of the blind side disproportionately small, but in
Monolene sessilicauda of Goode* the pectoral fin on the blind side is
“totally absent,” and in a new type called Lepidopsetta maculata by
Giinther, discovered by the Challenger expedition near the Antarctic
Ocean, ‘off Prince Edward’s Island,” we have the “pectoral entirely
absent on the blind side, and represented by a small rudiment only on
the colored.” t

It may be here added that Lepidopsetta of Giinther is entirely dif-
ferent from Lepidopsetta of Gill, and therefore should have a different
name. Mancopsetta may be substituted and refers to the defective
provision with fins.

A NEW CALIFORNIAN FAMILY OF FISHES.

A couple of remarkable forms were discovered, during 1880, in the
Californian seas, by Messrs. Lockington, Jordan, and Gilbert. Mr. Lock-
ington named the species discovered by him Icosteus cenigmaticus,* while
that obtained by Messrs. Jordan and Gilbert has been called Icichthys
Lockingtoni.t Both these forms inhabit tolerably deep water, and, indeed,
are known as “deep-water fish” by the fish-dealers of San Francisco.
The forms thus referred to differ in a number of peculiarities from each
other, but essentially agree and have been associated by Messrs. Jordan
and Gilbert under one family, to which the name Icosteidw has been
given. The chief distinctive character is the imperfection of the ossifi-
cation and the consequently flexible bones, as well as limpness and
flabbiness of the body and integuments. The family is considered to
belong to the Trachinoid group, and is defined as follows:

“Body oblong, compressed. Head, moderate, unarmed; the sub-
orbital without bony stay. Mouth terminal, little oblique; the premax-
illary not protractile; the maxillary slender. Teeth minute, sharp,
erect, in one series on the jaws only. No barbels. Gills 4, a slit behind
the fourth. Gill-openings wide; the membranes free from the isthmus.
Gill-rakers slender. Branchiostegals 7. Dorsal and anal fins long, with-
out spines. Caudal fin with many recurrent accessory rays, on a slender
peduncle. Pectoral fins rounded, with the carpal bones slightly ex-
serted. Ventral fins thoracic, 1,5, or 1,4. Vent normal, without anal
papilla. Pseudobranchiz present.”

Tcosteus has a naked body (save some spinules along the lateral line),
and the ventrals quadriradiate (I, 4). Icichthys has smali scales, and
the ventrals quinqueradiate (I, 5).

A NEW ECONOMICAL FISH.

On the banks off the American coast, in about latitude 40° N. and
longitude 70° W., is found a fish in large numbers of a type previously
to 1879 undeseribed.t It has been made known by Messrs. Goode and
Bean, under the name Lopholatilus chameleonticeps. It belongs to the
family Latilide, and its few-rayed vertical fins and other characters ap-
proximate it to the genus Latilus, but it is distinguished from all other
representatives of the family, and, indeed, from all related fishes, by the
development of a large adipose appendage, resembling the adipose fin of
the Salmonide, upon the nape. The labial folds upon the sides of the

mouth are also developed into fleshy prolongations, or tentacles. The
species attains a large size, sometimes reaching or even exceeding the
weight of fifty pounds. In life the color is brilliant ; above it has a vio-
laceous tint, while the lower parts are whitish, with some areas of
yellow. There are numerous greenish-yellow spots, the largest about a
third of the diameter of the eye; across the caudal fin are about eight
stripes of the same color. ‘The soft dorsal has an upper broad band
of violaceous, and a narrow basal portion of whitish.” The first speci-
mens obtained ‘were caught with menhaden bait in July, 1879, while
trying for cod, fifty miles south by east of No Man’s Land,” at a depth
of 75 fathoms, and on a very bard clay bottom. ‘‘Two miles inside of
this bottom there is nothing but a green ooze, on which no fish will live.”
The Lopholatilus is very abundant and bites freely. Large numbers
have been taken since the discovery, and it is possible that the species
may become a regular object of fishery.

THE ROCK-FISHES OF CALIFORNIA.

One of the most interesting and unexpected results of the investiga-
tions of Messrs Jordan and Gilbert* among the fishes of the Pacific
coast of North America is the great development of species of the family
of Scorpenids representing the genus Sebastichthys or closely related
ones. Excluding Sebastodes, eleven species had been previously made
known, and even then it was considered to be a remarkably well devel-
oped type, but the recent investigations of Messrs. Jordan and Gilbert
have revealed the existence of not less than 25 species. These occur in
different associations, and are found in several bathymetrical zones;
they are mostly caught in large numbers by the Italian and Portugese
fishermen, and taken to the markets of San Francisco. They exhibit
almost every gradation in the extent of the armature of the head, and
the transition between the typical representatives of the groups Sebas-
tichthys and Sebastosomus are such as to indicate that they are of not more
than subgeneric value. Some of the species are very formidably armed,
as in the ease of the S. nigrocinctus and S. serriceps, while others, as the
S. melanops and S. flavidus, have the spinous ridges almost obsolete.
Several species are very vividly colored. Such is especially the S. rubri-

vinctus, which is known to the fishermen as the Spanish Flag, and is, ae-
cording to Jordan and Gilbert, ‘the most brilliantly colored large fish
on the Pacific coast.” Of the species of the genus as understood by our
authors, 23 have been already detected in or near the bay of San Fran-
cisco, 25 in Monterey Bay, 14 at Santa Barbara, 5 at San Diego, and 9
occur as far north as Puget Sound.

A DEEP-SEA ROCK-FISH.

As has been indicated with regard to the Californian Scorpzenids, the
successive bathymetrical zones are inhabited by different species, and
as we descend downwards we find one set of species gradually disap-
pear, to be succeeded in the lower zone by another combination. It has
been conjectured that in still deeper water we may find yet other forms.
What may be expected is suggested by a species secured by the Chal-
lenger Expedition in the * Inland Sea of Japan,” off Inosima, at a depth
ot “345 fathoms.” It has been illustrated by Dr. Giinther (Report on
the Shore Fishes, p. 65, pl. 27),* under the name of Sebastes macrochir,
without any consideration of its relations. It is, nevertheless, note-
worthy for several peculiarities. The typical species of Sebastes have
15 (14+1) dorsal spines and about 30 (e. g., 12+19) vertebrae, while
the species of Sebastichthys and allied forms have 12 or 13 (12+1) dorsal
spines, and 24 (14410) vertebrae. The ‘ Sebastes macrochir” has, like
the typical species of Sebastes, 15 (14+1) dorsal spines, but the verte-
bre are unknown, although they are probably developed in increased
numbers. (The soft portion of the dorsal is said by Dr. Giinther to have
Six rays, but nine are figured.) The principal characteristics of the spe-
cies, however, aré the peculiar structure of the pectorals and ventrals,
and the position of the latter. The pectorals have a wide base, and are
produced backwards near the upper margin (and not medially), while
the (five) lower rays are thickened and extend much beyond the rays
next above in a linguiform lobe; the ventrals are situated directly un-
der (and not behind) the axils of the pectorals, and the outer rays are
produced thick and unbranched. These characteristics are the more
noteworthy, inasmuch as many deep-sea fishes have the lower pectoral
and ventral rays differentiated and modified as “feelers.” The ‘Sebastes
macrochir” is evidently not a true “Sebastes,” and, on account of the form
of the pectorals and position of the ventrals just indicated, should be
distinguished generically. It may be called Sebastolobus macrochir.

ferent classes-—-the amphibians and reptiles—which receive attention

as a whole from the same specialists. As in the case of ichthyology, only
a few of the numerous contributions to the branch made during the past
two years can be referred to.

The systematic arrangement has been exhibited in the popular works
on natural history published under the names of Bronn (by C. K.
Hoffman), Brehm, and Cassell (by H. G. Seeley).

The skull has been examined in various stages of development by P.
Stohr (for Urodela), and W. K. Parker (for typical lizards, chameleons,
and turtles), while RK. Wiedersheim has monographed the entire skele-
ton of a salamander—Pleurodeles. The heart and its functions have
been studied by M. Loéurt, B. Luchsinger, and G. Siebert; and the
Embryology by C. von Bambeke and F. M. Balfour (for the lizards).

New species have been described by many, E. D. Cope being the most
prominent among American naturalists, while several marine chelonians
have received new names from 8. W. Garman.

Various faunas have likewise received attention. O. Boettger and E.
Boser have attended to the Portuguese Amphibians and A. Tourneville
to the French ones, and discovered what they have considered to be
‘‘new species” in those old, long-known countries.

The Cecilians have been investigated by both W. Peters and R.
Wiedersheim ; the poisonous serpents of Europe by E. de Betta.

The extinct species have received the attention of E. D. Cope and O.
©. Marsh in the United States, and in England of J. W. Hulke, R. Owen,
H. G. Seeley, and W. H. Twelvetrees.

ICHTHYOSAURUS VIVIPAROUS.

Within the body cavity of various Ichthyosauri small individuals of
the form have been several times found, and it has been generally
supposed that they had been devoured by the large ones. Professor
Seeley has, however, looked into the question, and has come to the con-
clusion that Jchthyosaurus was really viviparous. The position of the
small skeletons within the body is such as to make the viviparity of the
animal much more probable than the inclusion by swallowing. There is
at any rate no inherent improbability whatever in the viviparity of
the type. Indeed the question whether a reptile is viviparous or ovipa-
rous is of comparatively little moment, as it simply depends upon a slight
degree of retardation in the retention of the ova, or the inclusion for a
slightly longer time within the body of the parent. There is no signifi-
cance such as exists between the viviparity of mammals and the oviparity
of birds. (Academy ; also, Am. Nat., vol. xiv, p. 60, January, 1880.)

are the Mosasauroids, first introduced to science through a gigantic
“Saurian” whose remains were found in the valley of the Meuse in Ger-
many (whence the name). Recent discoveries in America have greatly
enlightened us as to the characteristics and peculiarities of structure of
the type. The group was much better developed in America than
in Europe, and the skeleton is now tolerably well known. It has been
asserted that the form was destitute of limbs, or at least of a pelvis and
sternum, and that in this as well as in other respects it approached the
Ophidians rather than the true Saurians. Professor Marsh has recently
discovered remains which prove conclusively that they had a well-de-
veloped scapular arch and a sternum of goodly proportions, and that
there was an equally well developed pelvis, with pubic, iliac, and ischiac
bones, all distinct and of good size. Another bone, not previously found,
is the “transverse bone” of Cuvier, or ‘“‘ectopterygoid” of Owen. This
has likewise been detected in several genera, and is an L-shaped bone,
suturally united by one ramus with the corresponding processes of the
“pterygoid” and joining at the other the posterior end of the maxillary.
Professor Marsh has further identified (1) as pterygoid bones, those
also called pterygoid by Cuvier and which have well developed teeth,
while he considers (2) as palatines, small edentulous bones in front and
outside the pterygoids, and interposed between them and the slender vo-
mers. Hence Professor Marsh concludes that the new characters thus
presented are all Lacertilian rather that Ophidian, but inasmuch as the
Mosasauroids are distinguished by various important characters, he
proposes to segregate them, as a suborder under the name ‘“ Mosasauria.”
As a previous name had been given to the group, however—Pythono-
morpha—that name should be retained, whatever may be the valuation
that attaches to the distinctive characters.

BIRDS.
ILLUSTRATED VOLUMES, ETC.

The usual activity has been manifested by ornithologists. The tend-
ency to give an exaggerated value to trivial characters still lingers.
One author,* for example, recognizes two subclasses and 26 orders in
this most homogeneous of types, and for the little morphologically diversi-
fied Passeres not less than 53 families are provided! Numerous memoirs
on the birds of special regions, on various groups of the class, on the
anatomy of certain types, and on the system in general have been pub-
lished in the organs of sundry societies and in other periodicals and
reviews. A number of special volumes have also been issued, and among
such the following serial publications are the most noteworthy.

THE ODONTORNITHES, OR TOOTHED, BIRDS.*

Perhaps the most trenchant ideas associated in our minds with birds
relate to the development of the feathers, the insertion of the tail in a
fan-like manner, and a bill destitute of true teeth, although frequently
provided with serrations or special odontoid enlargements of the cutting
edges. In the Cretaceous period, however, there must have existed many
forms possessing characters in which they resembled reptiles rather than
living birds. One of those types, as is now generally known, was distin-
guished by the development of numerous caudal vertebree of elongated
form, extended backwards, and provided with feathers on the lateral
edges, thus contrasting remarkably with the abbreviated concentrated
coccyx and radiate feathers of the living forms. This ancient type
(Archeopteryx) also differed in so many respects from the typical birds,
and on the other hand approached the reptiles, that even recently the
opinion has been expressed by an eminent naturalist, Carl Vogt, that it
was really a reptile rather than a bird. This form appears also to have
been provided with well-developed teeth, although the exact characters
of those teeth remain yet to be elucidated. In America there existed
at nearly the same period forms which, in most respects, approached the
typical birds more than did the Archwopteryx, but which, nevertheless,
were distinguished by well marked characters. There were two of these
types.

In one form the vertebrze were bi-concave, (thus resembling those of
fishes and the Gecko lizards,) and the teeth were well developed and
implanted in regular disconnected sockets and partly shed and replaced
by others of later growth. The species possessing these characters, so
far as they have come to light, had also large wing bones, and the meta-

earpals were anchylosed. These have been distinguished as typical of
an order which has been called by Professor Marsh ‘*Odontotorme.”

Another form had vertebre like those of living birds—i. e. saddle-
shaped—and the teeth, although well developed, were implanted in a
groove and not in distinct sockets. The wing bones in the typical forms
were small, and no metacarpals have been found. These have been
regarded as also constituting a distinct order, to which Professor Marsi
has given the name “Odontolce.” ;

ARCH AOPTERYX.

It will be remembered that the scientific world was somewhat startled
by the discovery in 1861 of the body of an animal in lithographic stone
at Solenhofen in Bavaria, which appeared to be intermediate between
the reptiles and the birds, and which exhibited a combination of charac-
teristics found in neither of those classes. While by some it was believed
to bea reptile, by Professor Owen, who gave an elaborate monograph of
it, it was referred to theclass of birds, and since then has generally been
conceded to belong thereto. Lately a second specimen has been found by
Mr. Haberlein, a sonof the discoverer of the first, and has been the subject
of a renewed examination by Prof. Carl Vogt.* Some additional char-
acteristics have been revealed by the specimen; the head is preserved
in a much better condition than in the first specimen, and the jaws can
be examined. The latter in the upper mandible has two small conical
pointed teeth. Thefollowing summary gives the conclusion of Professor
Vogt:

“The head, the neck, the thorax with the ribs, the tail, the thoracic
girdle, and the whole anterior member are clearly constructed as in rep-
tiles; the pelvis has probably more relation to that of reptiles than that
of birds; the posterior limb, on the contrary, is that of a bird. In ail
respects the reptilian homologies predominate in the skeleton. There
remain the feathers. Here there is no doubt; they are birds’ feathers
with a central rachis and with perfectly formed balbules. The horny
substance of the feathers has disappeared, but the model in the fine
paste of the lithographic stone is so complete that we may study the
smallest details with the lens. The new slab shows all the feathers in
their place. The remigesare attached to their cubital margin of thearm
and hand; they are covered for about half their length with a fine fili-
form down ; none of the remiges projects beyond the others; the wing is
rounded in its outline like that of a fowl. It is possible that there was
at the base of the neck a collar similar to that of the condor; at least it
has been thought that indications of such a thing could be seen. The
tibia was covered with feathers throughout its whole length. The Ar-
cheopteryx therefore had breeches like our falcons, with which, accord-

ing to Professor Owen, it has the most resemblance in the leg. Each
caudal vertebra bore a pair of lateral rectrices; all the rest of the body,
head, neck, and trunk, were evidently destitute of feathers and naked ;
we should certainly otherwise have found traces of feathers upon a slab
which has preserved even the smallest traces of a fine down. Hence
the restorations of the animal hitherto attempted are quite erroneous.”

According to Professor Vogt the Archwopteryx is neither a reptile
nor a bird; although bird-like in its integument and hinder limbs, it is
reptilian in all the rest of its organization.

The Archeopteryx has been derived, Professor Vogt thinks, from
“‘the lizard-like terrestrial reptiles, having feet with five hooked, free
digits, showing no modification in their skeleton, but having the skin
furnished at different points with elongated warts, downy plumes, and
rudimentary feathers, not yet fitted for flight, but susceptible of further
development in the course of generations.”

THE EXTINCT PARROT OF BOURBON.

It has been for some time recognized that the large parrots which
existed in the islands of Mauritius and Rodriguez, when those lands
were first visited by Europeans, represented peculiar generic types—
that of Mauritius the genus Lophopsittacus, and the one of Rodriguez the
genus Necropsittacus. The large parrot of the isle of Bourbon or Réunion
has, however, been generally associated with the Coracopsis nigra of
Madagascar. It was introduced into systematic ornithology in 1760 by
Brisson, and a specimen (presumably described by him) is still pre-
served in the museum of the “ Jardin des Plantes,” although the bird
has long been extinct. Mr. W. <A. Forbes has re-examined the specimen
and come to the conclusion* that the species was not a natural associate
of Coracopsis, but the type of a peculiar genus for which he revives Les-
son’s name Mascarinus, and gives to it the new name Mascarinus Du-
boisi. (It may be recalled here that G. R. Gray restricted the name
Coracopsis as asubgeneric term to the Bourbon parrot and revived the
name Vaza (of Lesson) for the C. nigra.) It is, he thinks, “allied rather
to such paleornithine genera as Palwornis and Tanygnathus, than to
Psittacus, Coracopsis, or allied forms.” The extreme specialization of
the several types of parrots thus restricted to the islands indicated is one
of the most interesting facts in ornithology, and points to a long isola-
tion of the areas to which they were respectively confined.

number of parts issued during the past two years. ‘Trouessart’s cata-
logue of all the living and extinct species has also been continued in the
“Revue et Magasin de Zoologie.” The most important of the many
memoirs on special groups is Allen’s on the Pinnipeds of North America,
which contains besides a revision of those of other parts. The teeth
have been examined partly as to their mechanical and partly as to their
taxonomic relations, by Hensel and Ryder.

The placentz of Edentates of the families of Dasypodide and Bra-

dypodidz have been examined by Milne Edwards and Joly,—the former
by Edwards and the latter by Joly.
O —— has made a special investigation of the muscle of the eye in
the apes and monkeys. The foramina of the base of the skull have been
again investigated with reference to systematic values by Cope for the
.Eluroid Carnivores and by Wingie for the Insectivores.

THE PROGENITORS OF MAMMALS.

The parents of mammals have been chiefly sought for in recent times
among the early reptiles, and it has been supposed that they were
descended from forms closely related to the Dinosaurians of the Jurassic
and Cretaceous epochs. In a recent memoir on the characteristics of
the pelvis in the mammals, Professor Huxley has challenged this view,*
and has expressed his belief that ‘‘it appears to be useless to attempt
to seek among any known Sauropsida for the kind of pelvis which
analogy leads us to expect among those vertebrated animals which
immediately precede the lowest known Mammalia; for, if we prolong
the series of observed modifications of the pelvis in this group back-
wards, the ‘Promammalia’ antecedent to the Monotremes may be
expected to have the iliac and obturator axes perpendicular to the
sacral axis, and the iliopectineal axis parallel with it; something, in
short, between the pelvis of the Ornithorhynchus and that of a land
tortoise; and provided, like the former, with large epipubes intermediate
in character between those of the lower mammals and those of croco-
diles.” As this condition is not fulfilled in the Reptiles, Professor
Huxley thinks that the original mammals have descended from an
entirely different stock. He asserts that in such a pelvis as the sala-
mander, for example, ‘“‘ we have an adequate representation of the type
from which all the different modifications which we find in the higher
vertebrata may have taken their origin.” He therefore deduces the
conclusion that mammals have been derived from the Amphibians
through “some unknown ‘promammalian’ group, and not from any
known forms of Sauropsida.” ‘In corroboration of this view he adduces
the two condyles of the occipital of the skull in which the mammals are

paralleled by the Amphibians; and urges that only in the Amphibians
is the articular element of the mandibular arch persistently cartilaginous,
while the quadrate ossification is small, and “the squamosal extends
down over it to the osseous elements of the mandible, thus affording
an easy transition to the mammalian condition of these parts.” Further,
“the pectoral arch in the Monotremes, it is claimed, is as much like
that of the Amphibians as it is that of any Sauropsidan; and the carpus
and tarsus of the mammals are directly deducible from the urodele
amphibian type. (It is also suggested that the calear of the frogs is in
some respects comparable with the spur of the Monotremes, though this
is rather irrelevant.) Finally, it is said “in all Sauropsida it is a right
aortic arch which is the main conduit of arterial blood leaving the heart,
while in mammals it is a left aortic arch which performs this office.”
This discrepancy is thought to be ‘‘a great stumbling-block in the way
of the derivation of the Mammalia from any of the Sauropsida; but if
we suppose the earliest forms of both the Mammalia and the Sauropsida
to have had a common amphibian origin, there is no difficulty in the
supposition that from the first it was a left aortic arch in the one series
and the corresponding right aortic arch in the other, which became
the predominant feeder of the arterial system.”

In later publications* Professor Huxley has reiterated his opinions.
The ancestors of mammals or ** Promammals” would be distinguished from
the Sauropsida by the possession of two occipital condyles and the en-
larged size and functional development of the left aortic arch, while
they would ‘‘ probably be no less differentiated from the Amphibia by
the presence of an amnion and the absence of branchiz at any period of
life.” He does not doubt that ‘‘ when we have a fuller knowledge of the
terrestrial vertebrata of the later Paleeozoic epochs, forms belonging to
this stage will be found among them.” <A type like the one thus sup-
posed without the amnion and corpus callosum, and provided with fune-
tional branchiz, would find a place among the Amphibians. In the line
of descent, from the primitive vertebrate to the mammals, neither the
reptiles nor birds would intervene, they, according to Huxley, represent-
ing “as it were side-tracks starting from certain points of that line” in-
termediate between the amphibian and mammalian stages of evolution.

MAMMALS OF THE AMERICAN JURASSIC.

Previous to 1827, we had very little definite information respecting
the former existence of mammals in the Jurassic epoch of North Amer-
ica, although Emmons had indicated that a form of that class had left
remains in certain beds in North Carolina. In the last several years,
however, quite a number of species have been indicated, and based upon
lower jaws or fragments thereof, found in various beds in the Western
Territories. Up to the present time 13 nominal species, representing

In a very recent contribution to the knowledge of these types, Pro-
fessor Marsh has proposed to differentiate certain of these forms into
two orders, one of which he nas named Pantotheria and the other Allo-
theria.*

The Pantotheria are distinguished by ‘ (1) cerebral hemispheres
smooth; (2) teeth exceeding or equaling the normal number, 44; (3)
premolars and molars imperfectly differentiated ; (4) canine teeth with
bifid or grooved fangs; (5) rami of lower jaw unanchylosed at symphysis;
(6) mylohyoid groove distinct on inside of lower jaws ; (7) angle of lower
jaw without distinct inflection; (8) condyle of lower jaw near or below
horizon of teeth; and (9) condyle vertical or round—not transverse.”
To the group thus defined Professor Marsh thinks that, with the ex-
ception of a very few aberrant forms, the known Mesozoic mammals
may be mostly referred.

The Allotheria are distinguished by having ‘“(1) teeth much below the
normal number; (2) canine teeth wanting; (3) premolar and molar
teeth specialized; (4) angle of lower jaw distinctly inflected; (5)
mylohyoid groove wanting.” The group so distinguished is proposed for
the genus Plagiaulax, represented by a species originally described
by Owen, and of which representatives have been likewise found in
America, and to it are referred the new genus Ctenacodon of Marsh,
‘and possibly one or two other genera.”

It will be out of place to traverse the conclusions of Professor Marsh,
but those best acquainted with the mammals will agree that whatever
may be the relations of the forms above differentiated, it still remains
to be proved that they are entitled to ordinal distinction, for certainly
the characters adduced are not generally considered to be entitled to
such value by the majority of modern therologists.

384 ZOOLOGY.
DASYURIDS IN NEW GUINEA.

The mammalian fauna of New Guinea, until within the last few years
but little known, has assumed a special interest on account of the num-
ber of types discovered related to Australian forms. Many groups that
were supposed to be peculiar to Australia have been found in the great
island. Among the most unexpected discoveries were those of two dis-
tinct generic representatives of the family of Tachyglossids or Eechid-
nids. Besides these have been found true Phalangers, Dwarf and
Flying Phalangers, Cuscus, Kangaroos, Bandicoots, and Phascogales.
No typical carnivorous Marsupial had, however, been found, but
recently a species of that group has also been discovered. The species
in question belongs to the family of Dasyurids, and has been made
known by Professor Alphonse Milne Edwards.* Specimens were ob-
tained in the Arfak Mountains, at the entrance of the Bay of Gelwinck,
on the north coast of New Guinea, by the collectors of M. Bruijn, of
Ternate. The new species has been named Dasyurus fuscus. It is
smaller than any of those previously made known, little exceeding in
size a large rat. Its color is a very dark brown, but yellowish beneath;
there are small white rounded spots, regularly disposed on the upper
part of the body, and on the flanks, shoulders, and thighs. The tail is
long and not bushy. The short thumb is destitute of a nail. It is thus
most closely related to the Dasyurus hallucatus of the northern extrem-

ity of Australia.
PLAGUE OF RATS.

It is tolerably well known that in various countries—especially trop-
ical ones—once every few years there is a raid of enormous numbers
of ‘‘rats,” or rat-like rodents, on the cultivated crops of the planters.
A plausible hypothesis has lately been promulgated correlating such
incursions with the maturation and death of plants whose progressively
increasing fruit, till a certain period, furnish food for the increasing
rodents; but when the crowning crop has flourished and disappeared
the animals are forced to disperse in search of the food denied them in
their old homes.

Mr. Orville A. Dewey has contributed to the Rio News a communi-
cation reproduced in Naturet on the rat plague observed in the Bra-
zilian province of Parana. ‘This invasion, or plague as it is called, is.
said to occur at intervals of about thirty years, and to be simultaneous
with the dying of the taquara, or bamboo, which everywhere abounds.
in the Brazilian forests.” In explanation it is alleged that ‘the bamboo
arrives at maturity, flowers, and seeds at intervals of several years,
which doubtless vary with the different species. The period for the
Species most abundant in Parana is thirty years. The process, instead

of being simultaneous, occupies about five years, a few of the canes going
to seed the first year, an increased number the second, and so on pro-
gressively, till finally the remaining and larger portion of the canes
seed at the same time. Hach cane bears about a peck of edible seed,”
and the amount produced is enormous. After seeding, the cane dies.
“The rats, suddenly deprived of food, commence to emigrate, invading
the plantations and houses, and consuming everything that does not
happen to be repugnant to the not very fastidious palate of a famish-
ing rodent.”

Mr. Frederick Lewis, in a subsequent notice,* correlates similar visi-
tations of rats in Ceylon “with the flowering and death of the Nilloo
(Strobilanthes), which forms the greater part of the underwood of Cey-
lon forests, and is said to flower and die every seven years.”

Mr. Frederico Philippi, of Santiago, Chili,t records that in the south
of Chili that analogous swarms of rats occur, and are also coincident
with the crowning fructification and subsequent death of a bamboo—a
species called Colligue—whose period is 15 to 25 years.

THE HABITAT OF LOPHIOMYS IMHAUSI.t

One of the most remarkable of living mammals is the form described
in 1867, by A. Milne Edwards, under the name Lophiomys Imhausi. It
is, it has been well remarked, ‘one of the very best examples of ‘defen-
sive mimicry’? known in the animal kingdom.” The specimen through
which the species was originally made known was accidentally bought
alive by M: Imhaus, at Aden, in 1866, and thus Professor Edwards was
enabled to obtain tolerably complete information respecting the organi-
zation and peculiarities of the unique mammal. It has been since
asserted, however, that the specimen in question was not an Arabian
autochthone, but must have been brought from the opposite continent
and probably from some place in Nubia or Abyssinia. Four specimens
have now been obtained and are preserved in different European muse-
ums. As indicated by Giglioli, the native country of the species is “now
pretty well defined by lines drawn from Suakin to Maman and Kassala,
and thence southward towards the Somali coast.” The species appears
to be rare in its native country, or at least it is not often seen. This may
be on account of its habitat, for ‘it lives in deep holes in the strangely
fissured rocks” of the region in which it dwells. _ It is a vegetable feeder,
of course, and the stomach of a specimen obtained at Erkanid, on the
mountains between Suakin and Singat, was found to be ‘distended
with leaves and young shoots.”

eral interest.

ent of the society’s gardens, and the following figures give the result:

The period of gestation has been recorded by two gentlemen, Colonel
Heysham, of the Madras Commissarial Staff,t and Mr. Arthur E. Brown,
superintendent of the gardens of the Zoological Society of Philadelphia.
According to Colonel Heysham the period in the two cases noted was
nineteen months, and, according to Mr. Brown, the exact period was 629
days (from June 20, 1878, to March 10, 1880). The new-born elephant
weighed 213 pounds, and its height at the shoulder was 344 inches and
the circumference of the fore feet 17 inches. ‘The young was up and
walking about very shortly after birth, has teeth in both jaws, and sucks
with the mouth. The mamma of the mother, when distended, projects
somewhat laterally, so that the trunk of the young one is thrown up,
and rests, when sucking, in the angle between the shoulder and tho-

LIFE PERIODS OF THE HIPPOPOTAMUS. §

Observations in several zoological gardens have furnished the basis
for some essential data in the life of the hippopotamus. It takes about
five years for growth, although it may continue to increase in stout-
ness afterwards, and has been known to live nearly thirty years. The
sexual vigor of the male doubtless extends over at least twenty years,
and perhaps somewhat more. The period of gestation in the female
ranges ordinarily from 236 to 240 days, and in one instance birth en-
sued 227 days after intercourse with the male.

AN OLD AMERICAN BEAR.*

In the period shortly antecedent to that characterized by the existing
fauna, there lived in California an animal of the bear family equaling
in size the grizzly of our own days. The dental series was distinguished
by the absence of distemas, or intervals between the canine and con-
tiguous teeth, and therefore the species was generically differentiated
from any living form. The Californian species seems, however, to have
been related to a European ursid, which possessed the same character,
and which has been made known as a peculiar generic type under the
name Arctotherium. The bear of California has, therefore, been gener-
ically identified with this and described as Arctotherium simum. The
remains described by Professor Cope were found in a cavern in the car-
boniferous limestone of Shasta County, California, beneath several
inches of cave earth and stalagmite.

EXTINCT CAT-LIKE ANIMALS OF AMERICA.

Professor Cope has recentlyt subjected to renewed examination the
Felids and certain forms that had been supposed to belong to that fam-
ily, and has found that the characteristics found in all the existing spe-
cies are wanting in some extinct types that are otherwise closely related.
Such are the genera Archelurus, Nimravus, Dinictis, Pogonodon, and
Hoplophoneus of the American Lower Miocene, and probably also the
Proelurus, Alurogale, and Eusmilus of the European Eocene and Mio-
cene. These genera, so far as they have been critically examined, con-
trast with living Felids in that there is (1) a distinct carotid foramen; (2)
the condylar foramen does not enter the foramen lacerum posterius; (3)
postglenoid and (4) postparietal foramina exist; and (5) an alisphenoid
canal is developed. These characters, in the opinion of Professor Cope,
are of family value, and consequently the genera so distinguished are
segregated under the name Nimravids. In most other characters, as
well as in dentition, they agree with the Felids. ‘The several types, it
is said, “‘ form an unusually simple series, representing stages in the fol-
lowing modifications of parts: (1) in the reduced number of molar teeth ;
(2) in the enlarged size of the superior canine teeth; (3) in the dimin-
ished size of the inferior canine teeth; (4) in the conic form of the
crowns of the incisors; (5) in the addition of a cutting lobe to the ante-
rior base of the superior sectorial tooth; (6) in the obliteration of the
inner tubercle of the lower sectorial and (7) in the extinction of the heel
of the same; (8) in the development of an inferior flange and latero-an-
terior angle of the front of the ramus of the lower jaw ; (9) in the devel-
opment of cutting lobes on the posterior borders of the large premolar

teeth.” Twenty-one species of the new family are recognized, 12 of
which are confined to the American Lower Miocene and 1 to the Ameri-
can Upper Miocene. Of the other species in Europe 3 occur in the
Upper Eocene, 2 in the Lower Miocene, 1 in the Upper Miocene, and in
India 1 in the later Miocene or Pliocene.

THE REPRESENTATIVE STRATA OF EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA AS
DETERMINED FROM VERTEBRATE DATA.*

There has been only approximate parallelism of the strata of North
America and Europe from their Invertebrate remains, and inasmuch as
the later deposits are better characterized by the Vertebrates than by
the Invertebrates, a comparison with relation to the former was much
needed, and this Professor Cope has lately undertaken. He premises
that ‘if the types of life have originated independently we will find evi
dence of it by studying American paleontology; if their origin has
been through gradual modification, America should furnish us with
many intermediate faune.” To solve this question he thinks “the
identification of the generic types of North American Vertebrata has now
advanced to a point which renders such a comparison possible.” This
comparison is begun with the coal measures and especially with the
Batrachians of that period. The Carboniferous Batrachians are “not
yet sufficiently well known to enable the most exact comparison to be
made, but close parallels, if not identities, of genera exist. Such are
the Oéstocephalus and Ceraterpeton, of Ohio, as compared with the
Urocordylus and Ceraterpeton of Great Britain.” The Permian vertebrate
fauna, as representedin Illinois and Texas, ‘“ exhibits close parallels, but
not yet generic identity in the two continents.” The Triassic fauna is
much better known in Europe than in America, the marine Trias being
little developed, and the vertebrate fauna of the Muschelkalk being en-
tirely unknown in the latter country. The Keuper, however, is repre-
sented, and a characteristic type (Belodon) existed in both continents.
The Jurassic faune have been thought to be but poorly represented in
the New World. ‘ We do not yet know any deposits in North America
which contain the typical reptilian genera Plesiosaurus, [chthyosaurus,
Pliosaurus, and Dimorphodon, or the fishes of the Dapediide ;” although
recent discoveries by Professor Marsh presage much for the future. “A
few more characteristic fossils of the Rocky Mouutain region represent
the Odlite—particularly the upper Odlite—while Teleosaurus and Steneo-
saurus, and their allies, are not yet known from North American beds.”

The Cretaceous fauna is very well developed in North America. ‘The
ocean of the interior of the continent deepened from the beginning of
the period until the epoch of the Niobrara, and then gradually shallowed
until the elevations of the bottom began to divide the waters. The clos-
ing scenes of this great epoch were enacted amid a labyrinth of lagoons

and lakes of brackish and fresh water, whose deposits form the bed of
the Laramie epoch.” Of the four principal horizons of Europe, (1) the
Urgaptian is not at all represented, so far as known, in North America;
(2) the Gault in its upper portion and the Cenomanian in its lower por-
tion are to some extent represented by the Dakota, but (3) the greater
portion of Cenomanian is equivalent to the Colorado; and (4) the Seno-
nian is paralleled very well indeed by the Fox Hills group.

The name Post-cretaceous is given by Cope to (1) the Laramie, which
has a very characteristic fauna and is not represented in Europe, and
the (2) Puerco, which is perhaps represented by the Thanetian of that
continent.

The Tertiary epoch is abundantly developed, and from its base upwards
the strata contain remains of numerous mammalian types. The paral-
lelism supposed to exist between the various beds of the North Ameri-
can continent and Europe are exhibited in the foilowing table derived
from Professor Cope’s article:

The deductions Professor Cope has drawn from his examination of
the various questions involved in these identifications are that (1) ‘ por-
tions of all the faunz of all the primary divisions of geologic time have
been recognized on both the European and North American continents ” ;
(2) these are mostly represented in an inexact manner, as the Coal meas-

ures, the Permian, the Laramie, the Maestrichtian, the Eocene, and the
Miocene, but (3) several of the restricted divisions seem to be exactly
parallel, as the Turonian with the Niobrara, the Suessonian with the
Wasatch, and the Equus beds with the Pliocene.

In conclusion, a comparison is instituted between the results derived
from the examination of the vertebrate remains and those obtained from
a study of the fossil plants: (1) The beds determined by Cope from the
vertebrate remains to be Upper Cretaceous were identified by Lesquereux
from the plants as Lower Eocene; (2) the Lower Eocene of Cope is
called by Lesquereux Miocene; and (3) the Middle Eocene of Cope
answers to the Upper Miocene of Lesquereux. The discrepant results
thus obtained are remarkable and, says Professor Cope, there are only
two possible explanations: ‘ Either the animal lifeof North America has
lagged behind that of Europe by one period during past geologic time,
. or, secondly, the vegetable life of America has been equally in advance
of Europe during the same period. In other words, if the plant-life of
the two continents was contemporaneous, ancient types of animals
remained a period longer in North America than in Europe. If animal
life was contemporaneous, plant-life had advanced by one period in
Europe beyond that which it had attained in North America.”

The necessity for further critical comparisons and study from a large
point of view thus becomes obvious, but it must be added that the
deductions formulated by Professor Lesquereux are antagonized not
only by the vertebrate, but also by the invertebrate remains of the same
strata.
ANTHROPOLOGY.

By Otis T. MASON.

INTRODUCTION.

The rank and importance of any science are to be measured not only
by the intrinsic value of its subject matter, but by the amount of intel-
lectual activity which it demands and has evoked, and the contribution
which its pursuit has made to human progress and happiness. In claim-
ing for anthropology thefirstrank among the sciences, it is only designed
to say that it stands pre-eminent in the grandeur and complexity of its
theme. Although calling for minds of the highest order, it is beset with
so many difficulties, that men of the greatest genius have been rarely
attracted to it, and the beneficence of its results are so little apparent,
either in the augmentation of happiness or the increase of solid learn-
ing, that even inferior minds have been driven to labor in other fields.

As knowledge becomes more complex its devotees are obliged to be
more widely informed, although their cultivation of each subject need
not be soprofound. The abstract mathematician finds his most arduous
labors in the solutions of those problems which have no objective reality.
The astronomer, dividing his time between observation and speculation,
eliminates the profounder questions of the mathematician. The physicist
and the chemist must acquaint themselves with other forces than iner-
tia and gravitation, and in the study of molecular dynamics are com-
pelled to neglect the processes of the astronomer and to accept his results.
The retro-action of knowledge, also, is vividly shown in the assistance
which the chemist is able to render to the astronomer in the revelations
of the spectroscope. To the investigations of the student of matter the
botanist adds the vital phenomena, and the zoologist the study of vol-
untary motion. The anthropologist is bound to acquaint himself with
all of these, since man is amenable to all the laws of nature, and, more-
over, has ever taken their activities into consideration. His bones and
relics are buried in the débris of those geological ages which are beset
with the greatest difficulties ; his body is more plastic than that of any
other animal, and the forces of nature actupon him with a greater variety
of results. Finally he thinks, he subdues nature. There is scarcely a
mineral, a plant, or an animal that might not, with a little strain, find
its way into an anthropological museum, as helpful or pure to man.
392 ANTHROPOLOGY.

That there is a growing interest in this newest of the sciences is evi-
denced by several considerations. Among these are the multiplication
of private collections, public museums, and journals devoted entirely to
the subject. The cursory perusal of a bibliographical list will indicate
at once how much more minutely research is ramifying itself in the
human subject. The multiplication and perfecting of instruments of
precision and the record of many hundreds of observations are evidence
in the same direction.

Although the progress and expansion of anthropology are very ap-
parent, it is difficult to indicate their rate in a single year, for the growth
of knowledge, like the flight of time, is not marked by trenchant lines.
Moreover, many of the best works published in any year do not come
to hand immediately, and thus are omitted from every enumeration.
Owing to this fact, the summary will have a somewhat narrower range
than formerly. It will include all works on American anthropology so
far as known, and such publications relative to the subject abroad as
‘have been received by the Smithsonian Institution. The American
summary embraces not only works relative to the American races, when-
ever issued, but also the publications of American scholars in all depart-
ments of this science.

The order chosen in the summary is based on the convenience of spe-
cialists, rather than upon a scientific analysis of the subject. The follow-
ing are the headings under which the notes and the bibliography are
collected :

J. Anthropogeny.
II. Archeology.
IIL. Biology of man.
IV. Comparative psychology. ’
V. Ethnology.
VI. Glossology.
VII. Comparative technology.
VIII. Sociology.
IX. Daimonology.
X. Instrumentalities of research.

J.—ANTHROPOGENY.

No epoch making work like that of Haeckel has appeared during the
year. The Duke of Argyle, in a series of papers entitled “‘ The Unity
of Nature,” develops a scheme of law in nature which is consistent with
Christian theism. Dr. Lazarus Geiger’s contributions to the history
of the development of the human race have been translated into Eng-
lish by David Asher and published by the Triibners. The paper of Dr.
Theodore Gill upon the zoological relations of man is a résumé of the
evolution theory as applied to the human race, in which the author
rather states the present condition of the problem than attempts to put
forth anything new. The same may be said of the communication of
ANTHROPOLOGY. 393

Dr. Holmes on the distribution of the race, in the transactions of the
Academy of Science of Saint Louis. Prof. Gabriel de Mortillet, in his
Précurseurs de Vhomme, inclines to the opinion that a rude, stone imple-
ment-using race of apes may have preceded man, and, therefore, that the
flaked flints from the Tertiary could have been in use by these precursors
of man. The pedigree of man is also discussed in the publications of
Letourneau, Nadaillae, Parker, Perier, Radcliffe, Ramon, Vaughn, and
Ward. The most important work that has appeared upon the subject
in our country is Professor Winchell’s “‘ Preadamites’”” The title of the
volume is rather ill-chosen, for the reason that it is both misleading
and too narrow. In addition to defending the view that the biblical
record relates mainly to the semitic peoples, and that the man of archxo-
logy is almost outside of its purview, Dr. Winchell has gone over the
ground of ethnic distribution with great care, and presents @ very clear
statement of the present condition of the inquiry.

II.—ARCH ZOLOGY.

Great activity has characterized the archeologists during the year.
In the United States the subject is fostered in many ways. The Smith-
sonian Institution and the National Museum, co-operating, have their col-
lectors and correspondents in every State and Territory where aboriginal
relics and remains exist. The Bureau of Ethnology, lately organized
under Maj. J. W. Powell, has rendered very efficient aid among the Pue-
blos. Institutions in the States are hardly less energetic in the work.
In Massachusetts, the Archeological Institute of Boston, the Peabody
Museum of Cambridge, and the American Antiquarian Society have all
put on record labors of permanent value, as will be seen in the appended
list of works. The American Museum in New York is now the repository
of Mr. Terry’s collection of American antiquities, besides several others
illustrating savages in various parts of the world. The Philosophical
Society of Philadelphia and the Academy of Natural Sciences publish
occasional papers. In Ohio the Western Reserve Society at Cleveland,
the Cincinnati Society, and the Madisonville Society are actively engaged
inexplorations. The last-named body have published in pamphlet form
a detailed account of one of the most thorough investigations ever made
in American archeology. The State geologist of Indiana includes in
all his reports an account of mound explorations made during the year.
The same is true of the Wisconsin and the Minnesota Historical Society.

The Davenport Academy in Iowa and the Saint Louis Academy in
Missouri are among the most active of our State societies.

The activity in the study of archeology does not end here. The rage
for antiquities among rich gentlemen, both east and west, has put a high
value upon aboriginal relics, and there are many archeological treasures
in these private museums. It is a cause of regret, however, that this
cupidity for relics has started up the race of Flint Jacks to flood the
country with worthless counterfeits.
394 ANTHROPOLOGY.

Archeology is further patronized and fostered by several periodicals,
as the American Antiquarian, the American Naturalist, the Kansas City
Review, the Magazine of American History, the American Art Review. It
would be impossible to speak of all the separate productions in this field
of research; a few only will be mentioned that are likely to influence
public opinion to a large extent.

M. Florentino Ameghino has been very fortunate in discovering what
he regards the vestiges of prehistoric man in the Pampas of Buenos Ayres,
an account of which he publishes in the first number of the Revue
@ Anthropologiefor 1880. It is a cause of congratulation that three gentle-
men in the City of Mexico, Senores Chavero, Orozco y Berra, and Icazbal-
ceta have taken up the study of their own antiquities on the spot, in an
intelligent manner, and are publishing the results to the world in the
Anales del Museo Nacional de Mexico.

The extremes of archeological interpretation are represented by two
expeditions sent out to Central America. The Lorillard party, under
M. Désiré Charnay, is the first in the field, and an account of their results
will be found in the North American Review for Sept._Dec. This mission
embodies the Prescott school of archeologists who hold that the Aztee
and the Maya were something quite above our modern savages. The
Archeological Institute stands for the opposite view, as set forth in the
writings of Mr. Lewis H. Morgan and of Mr. Bandelier, the agent of the
Institute. Both parties are in severe earnest, and naught but good can
come from hearing both sides.

In England the debate still goes on as to the geological significance
of certain flint implements discovered in the caves and brick earths.
Are they post-glacial, intra-glacial, inter-glacial, or ante-glacial? The
account of the discussions upon the subject will be found in the files of
Nature. The appearance of Mr. Dawkins’s “ Early Man in Britain” is the
immediate cause of the controversy.

Not less interesting and important is the volume of Principal Daw-
son on “ Fossil Men and their Modern Representatives.” The purport of
the book is to connect aboriginal life as it has been enacted before the
author’s eyes in Canada with the revelations of archeology. From these
data, Dr. Dawson seeks to reconstruct ancient society in Europe.

The papers of Mr. William McAdams are of especial interest as show-
ing what excellent work a farmer can do who is willing at idle times to
take his teams and men and to make careful explorations. Mention
should also be made of the labors of the Rev. 8. D. Peet, who has man-
aged the American Antiquarian under great difficulties and without
salary, until it has now reached the third volume. The work upon the
mound pottery of Missouri, prepared by Messrs. Potter and Ebers, and
published by the Academy of Natural Sciences of Saint Louis, is a splendid
work in every respect—text, illustrations, and maps. The explorations
described were made in the southeastern corner of the State, at New
Madrid, a locality singularly rich in mound relies. Prof. John T. Short,
ANTHROPOLOGY. 395

of Columbus, Ohio, has published during the year a volume entitled ‘The
North Americans of Antiquity,” in which he has brought together at great
pains the results of explorations up to our day. It would not be too
much to say that it is now the best manual of American archeology.
In the Smithsonian Annual Report for 1879, published in 1880, there
are many papers upon archeology. The one most worthy of careful
perusal upon this subject is that by Mr. Walker upon the shell heaps
of Tampa Bay, Florida. The author reviews adversely Professor
Wyman’s theories of ancient cannibalism, and presents other methods
of accounting for the phenomena.

Wiener’s *“‘ Perou et Bolivie” is a gorgeous work, whose material was
collected at the expense of the French Government by Mr. Wiener, who
spent two years exploring the graves and ancient monuments of the land

of the Ineas.
III.—BIOLOGY OF MAN.

The title of this section is somewhat elastic ; indeed the Ecole d’An-
thropologie of Paris divides its contents between two professors: M.
Mathias Duval, who, under the subject of anatomical anthropology,
delivered a course of lectures upon anthropogeny or comparative embry-
ogeny of the vertebrates during the last winter, and Dr. Paul Topin-
ard, who, from the chair of biology, lectured upon anthropology in respect
of the living; inasmuch, however, as the same individuals are engaged
frequently in the study of man, structurally and functionally, and the
latest text-books take strong ground that the two methods of research
must be prosecuted simultaneously, it is found convenient to include
within the same theme all those investigations which regard man from
the side of zoology. The Biological Society of Washington has taken
the same ground, in embracing within its membership osteologists and
conchologists, as well as embryologists and physiologists.

A noteworthy fact in this portion of anthropology is the slow but sure
encroachments which methods and instruments of precision are making
upon the different parts of the human body. In 1786 was published, in
Paris, Pierre Camper’s “‘ Dissertation sur les différences réelles qui pré-
sentent les traites du visage chez les hommes de différents pays et de diffé-
rents ages.” The facial angle has received more careful scrutiny at
the hands of Geoffroy St. Hilaire, Cuvier, Cloquet, Jacquart, Broca,
and many other distinguished anatomists. The cubage of the cranium,
the situation and direction of the foramen magnum, the occipital, basal,
and nasal angles, and the cranial indices have assumed an importance
even greater than the facial angle. The scapular index, thoracic index,
pelvis, femur, tibia, and even the digits, are not without their value in
the problem.

The great difficulty of collecting the skeletons of any race in sufficient
numbers and well authenticated, has driven the anatomists to devise
methods of obtaining measurements upon the living. The British Asso-
396 ANTHROPOLOGY.

ciation has done very much towards establishing standards of compari-
son in this regard. Nor are the French very far behind in the work.

The brain, no less than the cranium, continues to be the subject
of absorbing interest. The comparative anatomy of the encephalon
holds out the hope that here lies the path to the solution of the problem
of man’s ancestry and origin. On the other side, among these mean-
dering labyrinths, are sought the secrets of the connection between
material and spiritual existence. In the bibliography appended to this
summary, Studies on the brain are accredited to Amat, Bordier, Ducatte,
Duval, Fowler, Spitzka.

The work of examining the skeletons or the living bodies of men,
however, has a decided rival in the science of embryology. The grand
generalizations of Haeckel, in his “ Evolution of Man,” however faulty in
detail, as all such comprehensive speculations must necessarily be, have
kindled a vast amount of interest in human ontogeny. The researches
of M. Mathias Duval, successor to the renowned Broca, upon the origin
of the cranial nerves, will be found reported in the Journal de l Anato-
mie et de la Physiologie, mai-juin and septembre-octobre, of the past
year.

IV.—COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY.

The question of the place of inductive psychology in the general
scheme of anthropology is as yet unsettled. Taking biology in its
widest sense, as including life in all its manifestations, there could be
no objections from any quarter to including the comparative psychology
of man and the lower animals within the purview of this comprehensive
subject. The reason for creating a class distinction in its favor is that
there is a separate group of men at work in this area. The problems
and methods belong to several subclasses. For instance, assuming the
difference between the mind of man and that of the lower animals to be
one of degree rather than one of kind, or, rather, to consist in a more
complicated and subtle organization of the same elementary principles,
and not in the difference of its constituents, it is held that the careful
scrutiny of the manifestation of reason, feeling, and volition all along
the line of the zoological scale will lead up to a correct apprehension
of mental and spiritual phenomena in man. Again, the question arises
whether the intricate system of powers, emotions, and desires are not
derived by inheritance and modification from simpler faculties. A very
interesting series of observations have been set on foot by Francis Gal-
ton as to the connection of memory and imagination with time and
space. A fourth set of inquiries relate to the order and method by
which mentality is manifested in childhood and youth. Finally, this
portion of anthropology has its bitter controversial side. Between the
atheistical materialists, the agnostic materialists, and the theistic dual-
ists there still exists that personal prejudice which blinds the eyes of
the observer and confounds right thinking.
ANTHROPOLOGY. 397
V.—ETHNOLOGY.

The term ethnology is retained for all those descriptive and philosophic
publications which relate to the groups of men called tribes, races, peo-
ples, the individuals of which recognize in one another a common bond
of union and an entire absence of prejudice. Ethnography is a narrower
word, applying only to monographs of different peoples.

The descriptive portion of ethnology is certainly the most important
part of anthropology. When we reflect that a very large part of the
immense collections of ‘“‘ materiaux pour Vhistoire primitive et naturelle
de‘Vhomme” contained in such works as Spencer’s Descriptive Sociology
are falsehoods or mistakes, we tremble for the deductions that are to be
erected upon such a crumbling base. This is not meant to disparage the
ereat work of such men, but to enjoin the utmost caution upon future
obserVers. It has frequently occurred to the present writer that we
should have an account of the “personal equation” of each narrator
before admitting his facts into the general fund of anthropologic truth.

It is very difficult to single out special works in ethnology, since there
is scarcely a portion of the habitable globe that has not been visited
during the past year. No labor undertaken, however, will compare with
the elaborate investigations which have been prosecuted among the
Indians of the United States, under the patronage of General Walker,
of the Census Department. The task of making the inquiries and
working up the material has been intrusted to Maj. J. W. Powell, of
the Bureau of Ethnology, and it is safe to say that there is not a little
band of Indians in our territory that has not been approached by an
intelligent ethnologist. The war in Afghanistan, in Zululand, and the
encroachments of the Russians upon the southern portions of their domin-
ions have all been fruitful of valuable ethnologic results. Among the
enlightened nations of Europe there is the greatest activity in searching
out the racial affinities of the present populations. Works of perma-
nent interest have also appeared upon China, Japan, and the races of
Oceanica.

A very valuable paper upon French and Indian half-breeds, from the
pen of Dr. Havard, will be found in the Smithsonian Report for 1879.

VI.—GLOSSOLOGY.

The mere acquisition of a language, or even the accurate study of
its phonology, its etymology, and its syntax, is not a part of anthro-
pology. Linguistic anthropology has reference, first to the origin and
life history of language as a whole, and, second, to the comparative
study of the languages of the globe as a means of grouping its peoples.
From the point of view taken by the student of the natural history of
man, all tongues are alike useful, all are part and parcel of a complex
organism or links in the glottic chain. Inasmuch as the languages of
398 ANTHROPOLOGY.

savage and barbarous races are never acquired either for the purposes
of traffic, or as a part of polite learning, it follows that all vocabularies,
syllabaries, or collections of sentences gathered among such people are
materials of anthropology.

Among our North American Indians there is at present great diligence
in collecting linguistic material. The missionaries who have labored
with the greatest success among them have been those who have dis-
covered that the compliment paid to a tribe in the acquisition of their
language returns with interest to the teacher in the form of increased
confidence and attention. Almost the entire Scriptures have been
translated into the speech of the civilized tribes. The labors of Riggs,
Dorsey, Vetromilye, bear witness to this fact, and furnish the philologist
with some of his best material.

The work of collecting Indian vocabularies, grammars, and diction-
aries set on foot by the Smithsonian Institution is continued with great
zeal by the Bureau of Ethnology. Mr. James ©. Pilling is preparing a
complete bibliography of North American Indian linguisties, which will
enable the student to investigate each tribe in the whole body of its
literature. Mr. Albert S. Gatschet continues his labors in the languages
of the California tribes, and will produce the coming year two large
volumes upon the Klamath.

A glance at the bibliography accompanying this paper will show that
the same activity has characterized those who have investigated the
languages of other parts of the world. Especial attention might be
called to the researches of Hovelacque, Keane, Oppert, Powell, Sayce,
and Whitney.

The work, however, that has attracted most attention in this direction
is that of Col. Garrick Mallery upon the sign language or gesture speech
of mankind. The author has not yet completed his researches, and there-
fore his work cannot be fully appreciated. The following tentative pub-
lications will show the compass of the undertaking. The first attempt
to present the subject publicly was at the Saratoga meeting of the
American Association, in 1879, an account of which will be found in the
volume of proceedings published in the following year.

A paper with the same title, not identical with the above, but contain-
ing the greater part of it, and specially designed for circulation among
officers of the Army and Navy appeared in the United Service, vol. ii,
No. 2, Philadelphia, February, 1880, pp. 226-243.

In the American Antiquarian, vol. ii, No. 3, pp. 210-228, the author
continues his studies under the title, ‘The Sign Language of the Indians
of the Upper Missouri in 1832.” This was a translation and discussion
of the gesture signs reported by Prince Maximilian von Wied Neuwied
as in use among the Aricaras, &c., in 1832-34.

The most thorough work of Colonel Mallery is the ‘Introduction to
the Study of Sign Language among the North American Indians as
illustrating the gesture speech of mankind.” The chief object of the
ANTHROPOLOGY. 399

work is to explain the principles of the sign language in such manner as
to properly direct research, and to furnish for observers forms of deserip-
tion and graphic illustration, so as to secure accuracy and uniformity in
collecting material for a larger work. Reviews of this volume will be
found in The American Journal of Philology, i, No.2; American Naturalist,
May; Penn Monthly, October; Academy, May 22; Nature, June 3;
Theosophist, Bombay, August; China Daily News, Shanghai, May 17%,
1880; Behm’s Geographische Jahrbuch; Globus, 87, No. 17; The Pioneer,
Allahabad, January 15, 1881; Swansea meeting of the British Associa-
tion, report, pp. 630, 635.

A subsequent work, printed for collaborators only, issued in Wash-
jngton, is entitled “‘ A Collection of Gesture Signs and Signals of the
North American Indians, with some comparisons.”

VII—CoMPARATIVE TECHNOLOGY.

It is difficult to find a term accurately definitive of what is intended
to be included in this class. Perhaps Mr. Spencer’s ‘‘operative” cate-
gory comes nearest. At any rate the term technical anthropology
embraces the description of the materials, implements, processes,
methods, agents and agencies, observances and results which enter
into the activities of man, in peace and in war, at every step of his
social progress. These activities are of many kinds, as diversified,
indeed, as human needs and desires multiplied by the varieties of
material and environment.

The discussion of this portion of anthropology is quite apart from
the consideration of race. Stone, shell, wood, textile, skins, clay, and
metal work have each passed through an elaboration which has kept
pace with the evolution of culture. The works upon this subject during
1880 have included meteoric iron in its relation to technique and the
history of civilization, aboriginal use of copper, the origin of metallurgy,
composition of ancient pottery, savage and civilized warfare, agricult-
ural fertilizers used by the Indians, jade workers, ancient commerce,
and the origin of the plow and the wheel-carriage.

Two works by our own countrymen deserve especial mention in this
connection. The Smithsonian Institution has published as a brochure
an article by Dr. Edward H. Knight upon the savage weapons at the
Centennial Exhibition, taken from the report of 1879. The work is
profusely illustrated, and is very suggestive of many of the “missing
links” in the growth of the implements of militancy. The other work
referred to is by the Hon. Lewis H. Morgan, entitled “A Study of the
Houses of the American Aborigines, with suggestions for an exploration
of the ruins of New Mexico, Arizona, the valley of the San Juan, and
in Yucatan and Central America, under the auspices of the Archeolog-
ical Institute of America.” Mr. Morgan’s belief with reference to all
the remains of our country whether fossal, aggeral, or mural, are well
known. The gentile system being given, the house, be it teepee, bark
400 ANTHROPOLOGY.

lodge, long-house, pueblo, or stone palace, is the natural outcome of the
organization. The student of comparative technology cannot afford to
omit this publication.

VIIL—SociroLoey.

Anthropology is not concerned with individuals. It does not inquire
how he or they acted or thought; that is biography or history. It is
ever asking how they were accustomed to act. It does not seek to know
quid fecerit or quid fecerint, but que solebant facere. When men are
accustomed to do a certain thing, they act in groups, at specified places,
and during certain seasons. Social anthropology inquires into the regu-
lative forces of society. The propagation of the species and self-protec-
tion lie at the foundation of the family, the guild, and the state, repre-
senting children, craft, and power. Beneath each of these lies an unique
principle, commonly overlooked by writers on sociology. A combination
of families does not constitute a guild or a state. The family, as such,
will never become more complex than the ends of procreation, nursing,
and rearing of children demand. A combination of guilds does not
constitute a government. The same men, women, and children who
may be classified as families will be found arranged in guilds upon entirely
different rules. The same is true of the government, both militant and
industrial.

The student of sociology, therefore, may set before himself a great
variety of problems. The discussion of the family, including those ques-
tions of natural forces which affect the increase or diminution, occupies
a prominent place in sociology. The progress from promiscuity through
the marriage of consanguines, then upward to the various forms of poly-
andry and polygyny to monogamy, though not yet worked out, has re-
ceived important additions in the works of Lorimer Fison, and Dr. J.
Bertillon. :

The question of industrial codperations has as yet received little atten-
tion. Mr. Herbert Spencer gives a large place in his descriptive soci-
ology to the regulation of industrialism. A very entertaining and import-
ant chapter in human history will be the narrative of the source and
vicissitudes of human industrial classes.

On the other hand, the history of militancy has been over-written.
In the early part of its career our race was at war with nature as well
as with itself. Man went forth to slay the beasts of the field, the fowls
of the air, and the fish of the sea for food and clothing. All his tools
were weapons, all his methods were warlike, and the same social organi-
zation served both for the slaying of enemies and the pursuit of life’s
necessities. In the upper grades of culture, however, this is different,
when the change of function demands a corresponding change of social
structure.

The study of sociology is so intimately connected with human happi-
ness that there is no lack of interest or improvement in this department
of anthropology. Of special importance are the publications of Ban-
ANTHROPOLOGY. 401

delier, on the social organization and mode of government of the ancient
Mexicans; Bertillon, on human statistics in France; Flower, on fashion
in deformity; Gore, on the development of deliberative government ;
Powell, on the Wyandotte Government; Royce, on the method and
chronology of the extinction of the Indian title: and Yarrow, on mortu-
ary customs.

iX.—DAIMONOLOGY.

The word “religion” has had such a variety of meanings that some
anthropologists never employ it. The term ‘‘religious” applies almost
universally to persons, so the phrase “religious anthropology” would
not convey the meaning intended. At the risk of introducing a neolo-
gism, the term “daimonology” (from daiuwy,—a god, soul, or destiny,) is
employed to include all observations and discussions concerning the
belief in spiritual beings, the conduct of men in view of their belief, the
paraphernalia by means of which these beings are approached and ap-
peased, and the body of dogmas and stories which have grown up around
the various phases of a faith.

Two facts are noticeable in view of the vast amount of earnest study
which has been bestowed upon this subject. First, itis now well known
that there are bodies of myths among every people as full of pathos and
sublimity as those of Greece and Rome. Major Powell is doing excel-
lent work in the way of collecting these stories among our own Indians.

The Folk-lore Society of Great Britain, as well as similar associations
in France and Germany, were organized for the purpose of publishing
in permanent form the supernatural stories of uncultured peoples.

In the bibliographical appendix will be found allusions to ‘ Norse
mythology,” flower fairies, wolf-reared children, the religions of India,
Polynesia, Ancient Assyria, and Mexico, the cult of the dead, lore of the
heavenly bodies, and of animals, creation myths, sacred books, and the
origin of religion. Major Powell’s vice-presidential address before the
section of biology, at the Boston meeting of the American Association,
was a discussion of mythologic philosophy, in which the desire to phi-
losophize concerning the causes of natural phenomena was considered to
be the fundamental principle of all religions.

X.—INSTRUMENTALITIES.

Each science has not only its field of operation where it gathers its
materials, but its storehouses where they are garnered and its media of
products before the world. Anthropology also has its implements of
research, its museums, and its journals.

The instruments of precision are mostly confined to the department
of biology. The methods of collecting and recording facts for future
reference are of immense importance in prosecuting any study. The
Smithsonian Institution and the Bureauof Ethnology use card catalogues
in their work, so that information is always accessible. It is no dispar-
agement to say, however, that in the system pursued at the Surgeon-

S. Mis. 31 26

ie

General’s Office in collating the Index Medicus and the great catalogue
of the library, the plan of carding knowledge has well nigh attained per-
fection.

The subject of anthropology is discussed, first of all, in societies de-
voted entirely to this science, or one of its branches. The principal °
ones are the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland;
the Société d@’ Anthropologie de Paris; and the Anthropologische Gesell-
schaft of Germany. Societies also exist and publish journals in Berlin,
Vienna, Florence, Madrid, and Washington. Secondly, international
congresses are held in various cities of Europe. Pre-eminent among
these are the International Congresses of Anthropology, Ethnology, and
Prehistoric Archeology, Congrés des Américanistes, and the Con-
gres International des Sciences Anthropologiques. Third!y, the great
national scientific gatherings, answering to our own American Associa-
tion, have each a subsection of anthropology, and very many valuable
papers appear in their transactions. Fourthly, papers of permanent
value in the study of man are read in the great number of local societies
in our larger cities and abroad. Fifthly, in addition to the journals, bulle-
tins, transactions, proceedings, and contributions of all these associa-
tions, the popular science periodicals, as well as the best literary month-
lies and quarterlies, give place each month to at least one article upon
anthropology.

To go over all this material requires a vast expenditure of time, more
than one individual can command. Already, therefore, the science be-
gins to have its specialists, who have given up the hope of occupying
the entire field and have contented themselves with a circumscribed
area.

The following bibliographical list does not claim to be exhaustive. It
represents pretty accurately what Americans are doing and what is being
done for America. The voluminous publications of the Archiv fiir
Anthropologie, although appearing rather late, are indispensable to one
who would prepare an exhaustive bibliography of our theme. The
abbreviations used throughout this paper are those which have been
adopted at the Surgeon-General’s Office, in the preparation of the great
medical catalogue.

[Record of an exploration of the ruined cities of Mexico and
Central America, written by Désiré Charnay, chief of an expedition
sent out last year by Mr. Pierre Lorillard, of New York, in conjunc-
tion with the French Government. Principal fruits of the expedi-
tion during 1880: Development of the plan of the ancient city of
Teotihuacan ; exploration of two important places of refuge and
burial at Amecameca, near Popocatipetl, resulting in the finding of
a large and unique collection of pottery and other utensils, also
some human remains; exploration of Tula, the ancient metropolis of
the Toltecs. Mr. Charnay has demonstrated, 1, identity of architec-
tural forms and principles between these cities and the cities of
Yueatan, and Guatemala; 2, inferred identity of race—Toltec; 35,
comparatively recent age of these ruins—dating from not earlier
than the 11th century of our era.|

ABSTRACTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN CORRESPONDENCE RELA-
TIVE TO ABORIGINAL REMAINS IN THE UNITED STATES,

By OtT1s T. MASON.

Very important information relative to the antiquities of our coun-
try continues to appear in the correspondence of the Smithsonian In-
stitution in response to Circular No. 516, That which relates to relies
is preserved by Professor Charles Rau. It only remains, therefore, here
to collect and publish that which refers to the permanent remains of
the country, such as shell-heaps, mounds, circumvallations, pueblos,
&e. The diligence and care with which the locations and characteris-
tics of such structures are marked and preserved by the intelligent na-
tions of the Old World should be an example to us with reference to
our own country. Very few persons realize the preciousness of such a
statement as ‘‘There are no ancient remains whatever in my county,’
or “There are shell-heaps, mounds, or ancient earth-walls in such a
place.” It is designed by the Institution, when the permanent work on
archeology is published, to have no blank spaces whatever; but to be
able to give an intelligent account of every county and even every town-
ship in the United States.

BARNARD, D. Mentions an old graveyard near San Buenaventura, Cal.,
where, under large flat bowlders, lay skeletons with chipped imple-
ments, beads, mica crucibles, red paint, mortars and pestles, and vases
or urns.

BILLINGS, MELVIN. Sends to the institution specimens from mounds
and graves near Marion Centre, Kans. Among them was a tablet
found 8 feet below the surface, on the second bottom, beneath a de-
posit of clay, surrounded by about a bushel of ashes, shells, and broken
pottery.

BrAcE, A. L. Has forwarded description and drawing of a flint flake
found in an excavation 3 feet under the surface in a yellow bed of
clay, at Amazonia, Andrew County, Missouri. The implement is 143
inches long, 54 inches wide, and 1 inch thick in the widest part. Mr.
Brace also describes other implements in his possession.

Busu, Miss JENNIE R. Gives notice of the destruction of the museum
of the California State normal school, February 10, 1580 ; sale an ac-
442 ABERIGINAL REMAINS IN THE UNITED STATES.

count of a collection of stone implements from Coyote and Guadaloupe
Rivers, California. [The Smithsonian Institution is in receipt of let-
ters constantly, giving account of the destruction of valuable collec-
tions by fire. It has been the policy of the Institution to foster private
and local museums in every possible way; but it is an irreparable loss
to science when a large and unique collection is thus destroyed. |

CHASE, ALEX. W. Mentions the site of a large buried village of stone
houses on the mill-site of the Grand Central mine, near Tombstone,
Ariz. In one house were seven skeletons, one of which had on the
wrist a bracelet of ivory or bone beads. In one of the houses were
found stone tools, mortars, &e.

Crick, THoMAS M. Reports that there are many ruins in Colorado,
near Dolores, in La Plata County. The largest seen by the writer is
situated on Animas River, in Taos County, New Mexico. The build-
ings are in groups. Two of the largest were five stories high, each
about 100 to 120 yards square, built of stone and adobe mortar. The
walls at the base are 3 feet thick, with small openings or windows 6
feet above ground to admit air, but not large enough to allow a man
to pass through them. The floors were constructed by laying large
cedar logs across the wall fur joists, and by covering these with cedar
splits and mud. The buildings stand in or near the centre of what
was a town or village. The other houses were much smaller and built
of small bowlders and mud. There are no cedars in the region at pres-
ent so long and so large as those in the houses. Many remains of
cliff-houses are found on the bluffs, some on the Dolores River, in La
Plata County. They are built of sandstone and mud. Pottery, ar-
row-heads, corn-cobs, charcoal, stone axes and hammers, and skele-
tons have been found in these ruins. The burying-grounds are gen-
erally laid out in a regular manner, the bodies being placed with the
head to the west. Two skeletons were unearthed on the Rio Mancos,
near Mancos P. O., La Plata County, that were lying one across the
other, with an earthen jar under the head of each.

Conway, JoHN W. Describes a visit to the old abandoned pueblo of
Cuyamanque, which was one of the first built in New Mexico. The
ruins are about four miles below the pueblo of Tesuque, on the west
bank of the same river. This pueblo was destroyed in 1697, by Gen-
eral Diego de Vargas. Tesuque, Cuyamanque, Pojuaque, Nambe, San
Ildefonso, Santa Clara, and San Juan had raised an insurrection, and
collected together on a high mesa to fight the Spanish forces. They
were completely routed, being driven across the Rio Grande, either
to the cliff-houses on the west side of the Idefonso, or over towards
the Navajos country. The pueblos of Cuyamanque, Pojuaque, and
Nambe were destroyed by General Vargas. Twenty years afterwards
the Indians were brought back to their old dwellings, excepting those
of Cuyamanque, who were scattered among the other pueblos. Dig-
ging around this ruin, Mr. Conway discovered specimens of painted
pottery, and stone implements.

CusHine, fF. H. Gives information that ancient excavations, supposed
to be turquoise and jade mines, near Zuni, N. Mex., turn out to be
quarries of sacred paint. The principal source of supply for these
precious stones lay across the Rio Grande, far north toward Santa Fe.
The Zuni myth to account for those stones, as well as for a peculiar
black bead which they highly prize, and for salt, is as follows: Cen-
turies ago there was a great cacique who lived in the Sierra Azul,
north of San Mateo. Wherever he urinated, the drops became beau-
tiful blue and green stones. When the Zunis Aconutes came to know
of this they encamped so thickly around the cacique that the stench
drove him away west on the Zuni Mountains, where he stopped to
make water; but he was in such haste that the stones formed were not
pure chalehiuite. This side the mountain he met the woman whose
urine was transformed into salt. He settled down with her a mile or
two east of Zuni; but again fled in anger from his house, around which
the people flocked. This time he went south to the desert, and there
lived with his wife, her urine forming the lake of salt (“Salina”), which
is to-day the source of supply to the Indians. The woman becoming
angry with the cacique, drove him into a cave in the White Mountains
of Arizona, whence he disappeared forever. Since then, a strong
wind has blown from the cave sufficient to extinguish the torches.
Nevertheless, the people felt their way in through the darkness, and
found the precious stones. On this account a part of them were turned
black, and large flies were caused to live about the place in summer.
The people, however, have persisted in going there, and found among
other things the discolored beads worn by the Zunis. At this place,
the cacique’s urine was changed into perfectly finished and drilled
stone, and in that condition they are still found. The cave in ques-
tion is like that of Silver City, and identical in use with the sacred
dance cave of Zuni, where paraphernalia are placed, and costly sacri-
fices of chalchiuites are now made.

Dover, THOMAS. Describes frog pipe and charred cloth from a mound
in Butler County, Ohio.

EARHART, JoUNS. Witnessed the demolition of a mound caused by the
construction of the Cincinnati, Hamiltonand Dayton Railroad, one mile
south of Post Town station, and two miles north of Middletown, Butler
County, Ohio. The mound was in the level plain of the first bottom
land of the Miami River, 30 feet in base diameter, and 15 feet high.
Two-thirds of the mass were removed 3 feet below the original surface.
In the centre, rolls of textile fabric were found, varying from the fine-
ness of three-ply carpet to the coarseness of a gunny bag, and pre-
served in shape by the moisture of the earth. These rolls were 6
inches in diameter at first, but were much broken by removal, and in
coming in contact with the air were wafted away by the slightest
breeze. Specimens were preserved by hermetically sealing them,
while damp, between pieces of glass. A spear-head, 8 inches long

Some contain likewise large sherds of pottery and unio shells. The
contents are usually as follows: One to three feet ashes, containing
bone, flint, and some stone implements, with sherds of pottery and
animal remains. Above this is a heavy layer of clay loam, 1 to 4 feet
thick. None of the implements show the action of fire, many fine
bone awls having been found; nor are the animal remains charred at
all. A few burnt bones were probably thrown in with the ashes.

ReEmscu, A. Explored two mounds on Walnut River, in Cowley County,
Kansas. They are 30 rods apart, 30 feet in diameter, and at present
18 inches high. They were originally between 3 and 4 feet high. A
trench 3 feet wide was dug to the centre of one of them. Bones, pot-
sherds, charcoal, jasper chips, and arrow-points were found ata depth
of 6 feet, or about 4 feet below the surface. Mr. Reinsch also sends
drawings of implements, among them a hollowed grinding-stone of
whitish limestone.

Ropinson, A. P. Sends a map of Coffey County, Kansas, on which are
marked the locations of antiquities. Along the summit of the bluff,
on Wolf Creek, many stone heaps are found, containing shells of unios,
such as now live in the Neosho River, which is at present a mile away.
At the foot of the bluff, by the cutting of the Missouri, Kansas and
Texas Railroad, many arrow-heads were unearthed. By digging a
ditch, what was possibly a cremation site was passed through, and a
few knives and arrow-heads were found. The ashes, &c., were from
4 to 5 feet below the surface, and over the sites were growing oaks 3
to 4 feet in diameter. In this locality many fragments of pottery
were discovered, but only a slight investigation was made.

SHIPPEN, EpwArp. Mentions amound in Ballard County, Kentucky, 1

STRONG, LORENZO. States that no mounds or earthworks occur near
Strongville, Cuyahoga County, Ohio. Stone implements are found
in abundance.

SWAN, JAMES G. Sends to the National Museum a carved seal club,

or tinethl, as it is called by the Makah Indians. This specimen was
made by a young Indian of the Clyoquot tribe, on the west coast of
Vancouver’s Island. B. C. His name is Artlyu,or Benjamin. He is
a son of Cdakanim, a chief of the tribe, and a great grandson of
Wikananish, the great chief mentioned by Mears and other early
navigators. This young man was one of the party who saved the
captain and crew of the American bark General Cobb, wrecked off
Clyoquot last winter. A photograph of Artlyu was inclosed by Mr.
Swan, showing the club before it was painted, and a rattle in his right
hand, such as is used during the medicine danee. This club is very in-
teresting and very highly prized. It is not intended for use as a seal
club, but to be exhibited on ceremonial or state occasions, as an ensign
of the rank of the family. It represents a dream of old Wikananish,
which was so strongly impressed on his mind that he related it as an
actual occurrence. It was believed by his family, and the legend has
been handed down to the present day. The story was related by Ben-
jamin, as follows:
ABORIGINAL REMAINS IN THE UNITED STATES. 447

“ Wikananish was a great hunter of sea otter and seal; he could
chase them into the deep water and there kill them with a blow of his
clenched fist. He thus excited the anger of the Sheeschee a fabulous
animal, half wolf and half fish. The head and forebody was wolf
(Chuchuhuioxl), and the body and tail were the Kowid, or Killer, Orca
ater (Cope). On one occasion, after he had been pursuing otters, he
came ashore tired and lay down to sleep. He then dreamed that the
Sheeschee chased him ashore, but he made his escape, and a panther,
Nani, rushed on him, seizing both feet in his mouth, and throwing
him on top of his head, where he was held by the fore paws of the
animal. While in this position the Sheeschee came up and seized the
Nani by the hind quarters. The Thunder bird (Thlukloots) then seized
the Sheeschee by the tail with his beak and grasped with his powerful
claws the fin and back of the Killer, and spreading his wings flew off
with the whole party to the mountains, where Wikananish made his
escape.”

He told this dream so often that he came at last to believe it to be a
reality. Thesnake in the mouth of the Sheeschee isemblematic of the
Hahaketoak, or producer of lightning. This animalis also seen painted
on each side of the bird’s body. The face on the bird’s tail indicates
that it sees in all directions, and the sun on the bird’s wings shows
that it is the true bird of the sun, which is looked on by the coast tribes
as the visible symbol of the Great Spirit. The swivel and three links
of chain at the top of the handle of the club represent a piece of chain
which old Wikananish procured from the vessel of the Spanish Com-
mander Quadra, and showed them as a proof that he was a great chief.
They were scoured bright, and during the presentation of gifts after
a great banquet they were rattled each time a blanket was given to
aguest. This specimen is the finest carving which has been seen here,
done by an Indian south of Queen Charlotte Islands, and is valued at
twenty blankets, although the writer procured it for as many dollars,
as a mark of personal esteem.

TayLor, Wu. J. Describes two New River mounds, in the ninth dis-

the latter. They were about 30 feet in base diameter and 4 feet high,
and contained only ashes and charcoal.

REPORT OF A VISIT TO THE LURAY CAVERN, IN PAGE COUNTY,
VIRGINIA, UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE SMITHSONIAN IN-
STITUTION, JULY 13 AND 14, 1880.

During the summer of 1880 a party was sent out by the Smithsonian
Institution to investigate the famous Luray Cavern in Page County,
Virginia. An invitation had been extended by Messrs. Campbell and
Stebbins, the proprietors of the cave, and Mr. Robert Garrett, vice-
president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, courteously granted passes
over his road.

The party consisted of Wm. J. Rhees, chief clerk, Daniel Leech, cor-
responding clerk, Dr. Charles A. White, geologist, Prof. Charles Rau,
archeologist, Prof. Otis T. Mason, ethnologist, Prof. Fred. W. Taylor,
chemist, Dr. Elmer R. Reynolds, ethnologist, T. W. Smillie, photog-
rapher, and Prof. J. H. Gore, civil engineer.

Leaving Washington at 8.35 on the morning of July 12, the tourists,
after passing Point of Rocks, Harper’s Ferry, Charlestown, Winchester,
Strasburg, and Woodstock, all made memorable in the late civil war,
arrived at New Market at 2.44 p.m. Having selected quarters for the
night, they made an excursion to the ‘Endless Caverns,” about four
miles south of the town. ‘These caverns constitute, together, a series
of very pretty grottoes, but no examination of them was allowed by the
proprietors. *Mr. Smillie, however, secured some very fine negatives of
valley scenery.

After a night of refreshing sleep, the explorers were ready to mount
Burke’s tally-ho early the next morning for a most romantic ride over
the Massanutton Mountain to Luray. Nothing could exceed for variety
of quiet rural beauty the ever-changing landscape revealed in the great
Shenandoah Valley at each turn of the winding ascent. There was
plenty of time, as the stage lumbered along, to alight and walk leisurely
behind in order to look back over the magnificent amphitheatre. Ar-
rived at the crest, all were ordered to mount to their seats in order to
‘“make time” down the tortuous eastern slope to the place of destination.
A very picturesque ford of the east fork of the Shenandoah forms the
gateway to the lovely Page Valley, having the Blue Ridge in the back-
ground.

Four miles of rolling limestone road brought the travelers to the

quaint old town of Luray, straggling along the turnpike, and contain-

ing about 600 inhabitants. Those seeking a shorter route to the caverns
may now go by rail directly to the spot over the recently-completed
Shenandoah Valley Railroad. ‘To select quarters for the night, to eat a
sumptuous dinner, and to don their old clothes, occupied the party but
a short time, and then all were ready to mount the tally-ho for the
«ave, which is situated on the north side of the turnpike about a mile
west of the town. The entrance is near the summit of a rolling hill.

Before entering, the party listened to an interesting account of the
ssearch for the cavern by Mr. Stebbins, and, under the instruction of
Professor White, observed carefully its topographical and geological
environment.

The Blue Ridge and Town of Luray from Cave Hill.

For many years a small cave has been known in one of the hills near
Luray, but it was not until August, 1878, that this wonderful freak of
nature was discovered. This was due to the curiosity of Mr. B. P. Steb-
bins, a traveling photographer, who was convinced that the old cave was
only a part of other similar formations. After diligent search, numerous
diggings, and considerable expenditure of time and money, with no little
ridicule from the villagers, he was.rewarded by the brilliant discovery.
Andrew J. Campbell, of Luray, was the first to enter the cave.

At this point Page Valley is several miles wide, and is bordered
upon the east by the Blue Ridge, and upon the west by the Massanutton
Mountain. The general surface is considerably diversified, and the
LURAY CAVERN, PAGE COUNTY, VIRGINIA. AB1

rock stratum out of which the cavity has been excavated appears fre-
quently on the surface throughout the neighborhood. The cave, there-
fore, is not in the side of a mountain, as most of the party had supposed,
but at least four or five miles from the mountain ranges on either side.
It has no obvious relation with them, except that its origin was partly
coincident with their origin, and with the excavation of the valley by
erosion. Indeed, it must be remembered that this gnawing away of ma-
terial has produced not only the valleys, but the mountains themselves
as they now exist, although they have such a considerable elevation
above the lowlands.

The rocks throughout the whole of this region have been much dis-
placed, having been flexed into great folds, the direction of which coin-
cides with that of the Appalachian mountain range. In fact, these
folds are a remnant of the results of that series of movements in which
the whole system primarily originated.

The rock out of which Luray Cavern has been excavated is a compact,
bluish limestone, not very evenly bedded, and weathering ruggedly on
account of its heterogeneous texture. The few fossils discovered indi-
cate that this limestone stratum is of Lower Silurian, probably belong-
ing to the Trenton period.

The position of the cave in the middle of an open valley, distant from
the mountains, and so much below their crests, shows that it was hollowed
out toward the close of the epoch within which the formation of the valley
took place. The character of the erosion leads to the conviction that
the excavation was effected subsequently to the formation of the great
folds referred to above. It is also plain that the foldings took place
after the close of the Carboniferous period, because the strata of that
period and those of later date are known to have been involved.

It is thus evident that the geological date of the origination of Luray |
Cave, although it is carved out of Silurian limestone, is considerably
later than the close of the Carboniferous period. None of the facts yet
ascertained warrant a more definite conclusion concerning the limits of
the antiquity of the souterrain, and the most recent epoch at which it
might have been formed is the Tertiary. It is highly probable that the
date of its origination is not more ancient than that of the Mammoth
Cave or the Wyandotte.

The history of its production is, of course, divided into two periods,
namely, its excavation and ornamentation. The latter was wholly pro-
duced after, and perhaps long after, the chasm was finished. The
cavity was wrought by the same agencies that produce all such effects
in limestone formations, namely, by the erosion and by the dissolving
action of water holding carbonic acid in solution, and coursing through
previously formed fissures in the rocks. These cavities gradually be-
come enlarged into chambers by the falling and removal of loose mate-
rial to lower levels, and even through open outlets to the general drain-
age of the country.
452 LURAY CAVERN, PAGE COUNTY, VIRGINIA.

The ornamentation of the cave, composed of lime carbonate, in the
form of stalactite, stalagmite, calcareous tufa, travertine, cave pearls,
calcite crystals, &c., has been produced by the precipitation of that
mineral from solution in water, formerly percolating freely through the
crevices of the rock which formed the ceiling, after the process of hol-
lowing out was completed.

With these preliminary observations the party equipped themselves
for their subterraneous journey each with a tin fraine holding three
lighted candles. The cold current of air around the mouth of the
abyss warned them that their comfort would be enhanced by a
heavy coat to enable them to sustain the shock of a sudden change
in temperature from 96° to 56° Fahrenheit. The first descent is
down a broad flight of square stone steps to a landing 50 feet below
the surface. <A short walk along a narrow passage leads to the vesti-
bule, or entrance chamber, an irregularly shaped room 35 feet high and
nearly 200 feet in diameter in the widest portion, the walls descending
and contracting in an erratic and picturesque manner. <As this was
the first cave experience of most of the party, the unexpected magnitude
of the chamber, the almost tangible darkness, the great variety of mas-
sive and curious forms, the ghastly shadows flitting about with their
feeble candles, filled up the measure of expectancy. Indeed, had there
been no rooms beyond far surpassing this one in every respect, all would
have been perfectly satisfied. A very remarkable object in this cham-
ber is Washington’s Column, a monster pillar, nearly 25 feet in diameter,
and very handsomely fluted.

A long, arched, irregular space beyond the vestibule, studded with
fungoid and stalactites, has received the name of the Vegetable Garden,
from the exquisite varieties of the incrustations. The botryoidal stalac-
tites excited the admiration of the whole party. Wandering through this
space, the explorers descended a well-built wooden staircase to Muddy
Lake, passing across which over a wooden bridge, they were shown the
Bear’s Tracks, curious indentations on the tufaceous covering of a ledge,
very strongly resembling the scratches made by an animal holding on
by its claws. The next point of interest is the theater—a suggestive
title from the resemblance to a great audience hall.

Ascending to the left the party came to the Fish Market. Here, on
the side of a projecting wall, or series of escarpments, depend hundreds
of sheet-like stalactites, mimicking most wonderfully rows of fish ex-
posed for sale. Indeed, one has no difficulty about the identification of
the species of bass, perch, shad, mackerel, &c.; some being gray all over,
others having black backs and white bellies, and the illusion being per-
fected by a sufficient trickling to give a slimy, fishy appearance to the
objects. All pronounced this to be the most curious, though not by any
means the grandest and most impressive, object in the cavern.

From the Fish Market the path to the right leads to the Elfin Ramble,
a low, open chamber, from 1 to 10 feet high, 600 feet long, and 300 feet
LURAY CAVERN, PAGE COUNTY, VIRGINIA. 453

in breadth. Crossing the Ramble by a deep trench cut through the
travertine floor and the cave clay, the party stood on the edge of Pluto’s
Chasin, a rift 500 feet long, 70 feet deep, and 10 to 50 feet across, and
with lighted candles in front of them sought to penetrate the darkness.
Fifty candles combine their ineffectual fires to dissipate the gloom, but
they only serve to indicate the locality of their possessors. Here is the
awe-inspiring spot in all the cave. There is greater beauty, richer
variety of form and color in many places, but no view stirs the sense of
dreadful mystery like that from the balustrade of Pluto’s Chasm.  Fol-
lowing the guides down a long, rocky descent, which bears away to the
right past the edge of the chasm, the party reached the bottom of this dark
chamber. From this point a fine view is obtained of the Specter, a tall
snow-white stalagmite, looming up in the darkness in a very ghostly
manner. This is a culde sac, and it is necessary to retrace one’s steps to

The Fish Market.

the Fish Market before making a new departure. Indeed, the astonish-
ing fact was that the whole cavern occupies such asmall area. In Mam-
moth Cave one can walk more than ten continuous miles without doub-
ling on his tracks. At Luray the chambers branch off in most fantastic
form about the entrance until one is entirely bewildered. Again, in
Luray Cave there are no contracted squeezes, no crawling, no break-
neck clinbings, no miry pools, but one may get about with almost as
much ease as in the open fields.
LURAY CAVERN, PAGE COUNTY, VIRGINIA.

1 the side of a rocky ledge by the path leading to the Fish Market
is a miniature lake, in which the formation of calcite crystals is yet
going on. It isa very beautiful object, the snow-white crystals forming
a pleasing contrast with the brown color of the surrounding rock.

The Grotto of Oberon is reached by crossing the Chasm. Here is a
diminutive fountain surrounded by innumerable stalactites of great
beauty. Just beyond lies the Bridal Chamber, socalled on account of the
delicately veiled stalactites and stalagmites occurring there. Until one

has stood before these objects with romantic names, it occurs to him that
the fancy of the narrator has quite as much to do with the matter as the
resemblance of the objects. But all such doubt vanishes in the presence

clamations. Itwassoin thischamber. The long, white, trailing masses:

night of shade on every side helped to complete the illusion. Just beyond
the Bridal Chamber is Giant Hall, where beauty gives place to wonder—

massiveness. Among the objects of special interest at this point are
Titania’s Veil and Diana’s Bath, and, just beyond, the Saracen’s Tent.
The last-named object attracted a great deal of attention, and vividly
recalled the pictures of crusading times, wherein the conical tent with
its ample folds is decorated with the armorial devices of the occupant
and surmounted by his banner.

The Saracen’s Tent.

The next object of interest is the Cathedral, with its fantastic freseoe
and stone organ. From the ceiling and walls depend thin sheets of
stalactite of various lengths, which, upon being struck, give forth tones
of great softness and effect. The impression made upon the party
wandering through these dark abysses, when Mr. Campbell, without:
previous warning, played a familiar air, will hardly be forgotten.

There is nothing more beautiful in the cave than these scarfs, shawis,

regret the visitor sees the curtain fall upon this enchanted spot, but his
sense of novelty is redoubled as he passes on to the Fallen Column,
strangely misnamed. Once it hung from the lofty ceiling above, in com-
pany with many others, a ponderous mass over 50 feet long, at least 14
feet in its greatest diameter, and weighing about 400 tons. The entire
LURAY CAVERN, PAGE COUNTY, VIRGINIA. A457

collection of these immense stalactites at this portion of the cavern re-
sembles a great inverted forest of blasted trunks. The only spot in all
the abyss where a sense of danger and utter helplessness seizes the ex-
plorer is when he stands beneath these magnificent stalactites, weighing
over 500 tons each, held to the roof only by their own cohesion, and capa-
ble of falling, as evidenced by the prostrate giant before him. This feel-
ing quickly subsides, however, when, upon closer inspection, he sees the
fluted sides of the fallen one supporting long rows of secondary stalactites
which indicate that perhaps centuries have elapsed since the crash of its
downfall reverberated through these lonely halls. Drooping over the
column to the right is the Angel’s Wing, a formation of alabaster white-
ness, nearly 10 feet high by 7 wide, and flecked all over with feather-like
wrinkles. Truly one may be pardoned for giving his fancy loose rein,
as he here beholds in this wing drooping over a fallen stalactite an em-
blem of the flight of centuries.

The Throne Room and the Throne, Chapman’s Lake, the Tower of
Babel, and Katie’s Secret pass quickly in review as the path leads on
to the Giants’ Hall, the chef @auvre of this fairy underworld. On the
verge of a towering cliff the beholder faces this chamber of wonders.
Stretching away to the right is a seemingly interminable row of prodig-
ious, glittering columns. They rise from out the depths of shade and
are lost in the overhanging gloom. The magnesium light successfully
combats these hosts of darkness and drives them into the alcoves and
recesses above, beneath, and on either side, revealing forms of giant
dimensions, weird outline, and infinite variety of ornament. Many feet
below are the Chimes,—long sheeted stalactites, which on being vi-
brated give forth a deep, tremulous peal of varied tone.

The Empress Columns, the Sultana, the Double Columns, the Frozen
Cascade, the Chalcedony Cascade, and the Hanging Rock being passed
and admired, the scene opens into the Amphitheater, a large high-ceiled
rotunda which has been tightly floored and fitted up with seats and
chandeliers for a ball-room. Here on special occasions the citizens of
Luray assemble to “chase the glowing hours with flying feet.”.. Around
the amphitheater are the Tombs of the Martyrs, Cinderella, and an end-
less number of robed and spangled heroes and heroines as yet un-
named. An ascent of two long flights of stairs leads from this rotunda
to Campbell’s Hall, an oblong chamber, about 200 feet in the long di-
ameter and 50 feet high. The chief attraction of this room is the rich
variety of coloring in the stalactites, including red, yellow, black, white,
blue, gray, brown, with an infinite number of intermediate shades.

The returning path leads through the Bridal Chamber, where at
least one couple sought their introduction into the mysteries of wedded
love. Near at hand is the hollow column, a cylinder of great size, which
rises from the floor and disappears through the ceiling as a stove-pipe.
The column is hollow, as its name implies, a stream of water having
worn away the center, through which, by means of a rope, an ascent can
be made to a chamber nearly 60 feet above.
458 LURAY CAVERN, PAGE COUNTY, VIRGINIA.

Passing onward the visitor stops for a few moments to admire what
seems to be the retreating form of a lady in full party toilet. Her head
is just hid by the jamb of the distant doorway; but rounded shoulders,
delicate arms, shapely waist, and long, flowing skirt and train, profusely
ornamented, all are there. The proprietors have named this the Ladies’
Toilet, but some of the Smithsonian party suggested the title “ Cinderella
leaving the Ball.” The path leads hence across Pluto’s Chasm, by the
Bridge of Sighs, to a rift bearing the grim title of Skeleton Gulch.

The Grand Gulch and Geyser.

Here, 110 feet below the mouth of the Chasm, in the bottom of a narrow
trench, are the bones of what appears to have been ahuman being. The
vandalism of former visitors made the proprietor rather shy of the ex-
ploring party; but as far as could be made out a man or woman lost in
the cave had wandered to the edge of Pluto’s Chasm, and, falling over,
had here become entombed. Most of the bones are concealed by the
tufaceous floor which has formed over them, but protruding through
and above this are to be seen the head of a femur with an inch or two
of the vertebral column, two or three small pointed projections resem-
bling teeth, and a portion of a third bone undetermined. It was abso-
lutely impossible to gain any information concerning these bones which
would be of scientific value.

The ground passed over is only one-fourth of the cave accessible, with
but little trouble, to visitors; and yet the fleeting hours invite return and
compel a speedy retreat.
LURAY CAVERN, PAGE COUNTY, VIRGINIA. 459

It is a matter of profound regret that the peculiar combination of un-
toward circumstances precluded a more scientific examination of the
Luray Cavern. It is quite certain that the work could be thoroughly
done with little cost if the same party could have proper facilities an-
other season. The daze of first impressions being off, there would be
no hindrance to genuine work. An electric light should be used in
place of the magnesium wire, and bearings, distances, and elevation
carefully noted.

Comparing this great natural curiosity with others of the same class
it is safe to say that there is probably no other cave in the world more
completely and profusely decorated with stalactitic and stalagmitic
ornamentation than that at Luray. So abundant is this decoration that
in only a small portion of the whole interior is unadorned rock visible.
Here in this dark studio of nature are reproductions of all those
objects which are wont to fill the mind with pleasure, wonder, or alarm—
crystal fountains, spouting geysers, cascades, flower gardens, gems
which are the crown jewels of nature set off against a background of
velvet darkness, cathedrals gorgeously sculptured and frescoed, chimes
and deep-toned organs, thrones, spectral beings, terrestrial, celestial,
and infernal—objects whose multiplicity variety and splendor would ex-
haust the whole literature of mythic and fairy lore, in providing names
for their infinite diversity of beauty. The indications are that the work
was done with comparative rapidity, and the present dryness is suffi-
cient evidence that the process has nearly ceased. Indeed, with the ex-
veption of a few spots where there is a slight percolation of water from
above, and a few where the gathering into pools allows the erystalliza-
tion of the salts of lime, the atmosphere is all too dry for the deposition
of lime carbonate. The cessation of the production of stalactites after
the chambers had received their finishing touches was doubtless due to
a change of condition of the land in the neighborhood, causing the drain-
ing away into deeper channels of the surface water. This change prob-
ably resulted from the further deepening of the bed of the neighboring
stream, after the greater part of the ornamentation had been completed.
These circumstances indicate some degree of geological antiquity for the
Luray Cavern. Hence a date as early as the Tertiary period has been
suggested, but there is no apparent reason why it may not be supposed
to have originated in one of the Mesozoic periods. In any case we may
safely assume that the Luray Cavern long antedates the pristine man,
although one of his descendants paid a fatal visit here long before Mr.
Stebbins.

The obscurity of the aperture through which it was discovered by its
present proprietors (1878) would naturally suggest that its existence
could not have been previously known. The discovery of parts of a
Skeleton of man or of some large vertebrate, mostly embedded in
tufaceous carbonate of lime, at the bottom of a chasm, shows that it was
at one time of easier access ; indeed, it is affirmed that former owners
460 LURAY CAVERN, PAGE COUNTY, VIRGINIA.

of the land had dumped loose rocks into the aperture to prevent young
stock from wandering in and getting lost. The bones discovered are
doubtless of considerable human antiquity ; but, as they are found upon
one of the few spots in the cave where the tufaceous material is still
forming, it would appear probable that their age may not exceed two
hundred or three hundred years.

A few insects have been found in Luray Cave, but a thorough exami-
nation with a view to collecting its fauna could not be made in the short
stay allowed the Smithsonian party. Nostreams or pools of water have
as yet been found in which an aqueous fauna might exist, and from pres-
ent indications it is likely that the variety of animal life will prove to be
very limited. At present a few spiders, flies, and one myriapod are
known. An account of the former will appear in the American Natur-
alist, from the pen of the editor, Dr. A. S. Packard, jr. The myriapod
has been described in volume iii, p. 524, of the Proceedings of the Na-
tional Museum by Mr. J. A. Ryder and named zygonopus whitet in honor
of Dr. C. A. White.

The vegetable growth is far more limited in extent. The proprietors
have been compelled to form the walks and balustrades, through the
cave, of green planks. In several places the white mold hangs from the
under side of these planks in long graceful festoons, not unlike the moss
upon the cypress trees of the South.

The party were greatly pleased with the courtesies received at the
hands of the proprietors of the caverns, the citizen of Luray, and the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, and only regret that their limited
time and opportunities prevented their making a thorough scientific ex-
ploration.

doah Valley Railroad, for the use of the illustrations in this article.
DISCUSSION OF THE BAROMETRIC OBSERVATIONS OF PROF. E. 8.
SNELL (AMHERST COLLEGE).

By Pror. F. H. Loup, or COLORADO COLLEGE.

The meteorological register of Amherst College was begun in 1835
by the late Prof. E. S. Snell, and consisted for the first year of a mere
register of storms, to which daily observations of the thermometer and
wind were added in 1836. Barometric observations were also begun in
November, 1836, but the instrument employed for the first fifteen years
was of inferior accuracy, and the observations were not corrected for
capacity nor for temperature. With the beginning of the year 1852,
new instruments by James Green—a barometer, thermometer, and psy-
chrometer—were furnished by the Smithsonian Institution, and in 1854
the uniform hours of observation recommended by the Institution were
introduced. The thermometer previously in use was at the same time
tested and approved by Professor Guyot. From that time to the present
the same instruments, with the exception of one bulb of the psychrom-
eter, have been in use in the same positions; and, together with gauges
for rain and snow, they comprise all the instruments used in the daily
observations. From the same time the hours of observation have re-
mained unchanged, viz, 7 a.m.and 2and9p.m. The series of twenty-
five years of observations, from 1854 to 1878, is therefore as nearly as
possible homogeneous throughout, and it is scarcely less so in respect
of the observers who have been engaged upon it, for few of the observa-
tions have been made by others than Professor Snell and one or two
members of his family. His well-known scrupulous accuracy is there-
fore characteristic of the whole work. In 1858 five months of observa-
tion were mad by the tutor in mathematics (now Rev. H. S. Kelsey, of
New Haven) at his room in North College, the only instance of a removal
of the instruments; but before the barometer observations made during
this interval were incorporated with the others in the present reduction
they were corrected for difference of level, no such correction having been
made at the time. —

Amherst is situated in latitude 42° 22’, longitude 72° 30’ W. The
elevation of the barometer-cistern above the level of the sea was deter-
mined by Professor Guyot at 267 feet, and this computation has been
462 DISCUSSION OF BAROMETRIC OBSERVATIONS.

verified by leveling from the track of the New London Northern Rail-
road, the height thus deduced being 266.5 feet. The readings of the
barometer have never been corrected for elevation, but represent the
actual pressure at Amherst in inches of mercury at 32° Fahr.

In regard to the fluctuation of atmospheric pressure, the observations
at Amherst may probably be regarded as fairly representative of New
England and the adjacent portion of New York. In confirmation of
this opinion, the figures at the foot of this page are cited from a pam-
phlet of ‘‘ Meteorological Researches for the use of the Coast Pilot,”
published in 1877 by the United States Coast Survey. -They are the co-
efficients of Bessel’s periodic function, under a modified form, in which
e, represents the value which ¢, the time-angle, has at the maximum of
the annual inequality, and < is the value of 2¢ at the maximum of the
seméannual inequality. The coefficients By, B,, Bz are expressed in mil-
limeters. The places named in the first column are all those within the
above-named region which are embraced in the tables of the pamphlet
(pp. 33, 34). The data from which the numbers in the first seven
lines were computed were originally published in 1861 by the Smith-
sonian Institution (‘‘ Results of Meteorological Observations, 185459”) ;
those in the seven following lines were derived from the Reports of the
Chief Signal Officer, 1872-1876. The latter are reduced to sea-level;
the former are not. None of the fourteen are based upon more than six
years’ observations. The values given separately for Amherst, below the
rest, are taken from the present reduction of the twenty-five-year series,
and it will be seen that except in the value of « they agree well with the
mean of all the others. This angle «, appears from the given values to
be very variable when a comparison is made of different places, or even
of the same place in different short series of years, a circumstance,
doubtless, connected with the fact that, as appears from the present
reduction of the Amherst observations, the coefficient B, of the term
B, cos (2g—s2) is less than that of the following term in 3¢,—of which
term no account is made in the pamphlet.

DISCUSSION OF BAROMETRIC OBSERVATIONS. 443
ANNUAL FLUCTUATION OF ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.

In order to deduce the annual march of atmospheric pressure with as
much accuracy as the Amherst twenty-five-year series renders possible,
the first step has been to derive the coeflicients of Bessel’s periodic func-
tion from the given monthly means. These, as given in the records,
were of course originally derived from the daily means, and these last
are simply the third part of the sum of the three daily observations, no
additional weight being given to the evening observation. In the re-
duction of the barometric observations no correction for hours of observa-
tion has been attempted, but a correction for the unequal length of the
calendar months was made in the manner presented by Mr. E. L. De
Forest, and quoted on page 170 of Mr. Charles Schott’s paper on tem-
perature (Smithson. Cont., vol. X XI). The monthly means thus corrected
are as follows :*

The form of the function derived in this preliminary computation is
the following:

P = 29.7207+.0467 sin (0+ 142°20’)+ .0227 sin (204 10034’)+.0241 sin
(30+ 44° 41’) 4.0139 sin (40492°44’).

From this formula a table of normal pressure for every day of the
year was prepared, the value of P being computed directly from the
formula for March 1st, and every tenth day thereafter to August “8th;
also for September 1st and every tenth day to February 28th. The
values for the intermediate days were then obtained by interpolation,
using second differences, except a few days at critical epochs, the values
for which were again computed from the formula. The table of normal
pressures thus deduced is as follows, the integral part of each value in
this and succeeding tables of barometric pressures being omitted for

*The amount of this correction for length of months may be seen by comparing the
means here given with those appended to Table I in the line headed ‘‘ Means from Rec-
ord.” I did not think it necessary to verify the work of Professor Snell in obtaining
the means of the single months from the daily means or the latter from the observed
heights, especially as the formula resulting from the present computation is used only
to direct the subsequent work. A separate determination of the mean monthly pres-
sures, independent of the recorded monthly means, occurs at the end of Table I.
Since my work was completed, however, I have received from H. A. Hazen, M. A., a
list of errors in the recorded monthly means which he has discovered in examining
Professor Snell’s work. Making allowance for these errors the mean monthly pres-
sures, uncorrected for unequal lengths of the months, are as given in the last line of
Table I, ‘‘ Means from corrected record.” In Table VI (the only remaining part of my
work which is derived from the recorded monthly means) I have substituted Mr,
Hazen’s determinations wherever he has found those of Professor Snell erroneous.

tended to four places of decimals, though it has been thought unneces-
sary to give more than three.

It here appears that the extremes of the annual fluctuation are the
maximum 29.7902 on the day of the autumnal equinox, with the mini-
mum 29.6612 on May 10, while a subcrdinate wave occurs in the begin-
ning of the decline from the September maximum, reaching a minimum
value of 29.7066 in the middle of November, with a subsequent rise to:
29.7877 on the 8th of January.

The most marked deviation between the monthly means of the com-

deviation from the regular progress occurring in the end of March,
which will be noticed hereafter in its proper place.

It is well known that the accidental barometric oscillations have a
greater range in the winter than in the summer months, and for the
purpose of obtaining a quantitative determination of the normal degree:

of this atmospheric disturbance in every part of the year, as well as a
more accurate account of the annual fluctuation of pressure, the daily
means of the barometer for the twenty-five years were next arranged
under each day of the year in two columns, one column containing
those means which exceed the normal value for the particular day in
question, derived from Table I, the other column containing the means
for like-named days in the remaining years, all falling below the com-
puted normal value. Each column having been added, the difference
between its sum and the product of the normal value by the number of
means in that column was found. Thenif d and d’ represent these differ-
ences, N fhe normal value, and n the number of means in both columns

In this series few oscillations appear beyond the two principal ones
already noted. Beginning with the yearly minimum on May 10th,
which falls in the thirteenth period, the rise to the September maximum,
in the twenty-seventh, appears to be broken by a depression culminating
in the twentieth period (about July 17), and in like manner the fall
thence to the November minimum is checked by a subordinate maximum
in the end of October, the thirtieth period. The only remaining note-
worthy departure from the normal value is more marked than either of
the preceding, and consists of a depression in the ninth period—the ten
days following the vernal equinox—which appears to amount to a true
equinoctial storm. Thus each of the two equinoxes is a definite baro-
metric epoch, though they are marked by opposite characteristics.

A tendency is apparent in one or both of the periods adjacent to a
maximum or minimum to depart from the normal values in an opposite
direction, so that the gradual approach to the critical value, on the part
of the more distant periods, appears to culminate ten or fifteen days
from the true epoch, and a double maximum or minimum is the result.
Examples may be noticed in the fourteenth period, immediately follow-
ing the yearly minimum in May, while a double maximum occurs in
September ; also, in the case of minor oscillations, the minima in March
and July are each followed by a single period of high barometer, and
the January maximum is both preceded and followed by single periods
slightly lower than those adjacent to them. The phenomenca appears
suspicious, as though due to accidental variations, yet some ground for
DISCUSSION OF BAROMETRIC OBSERVATIONS. 467

a contrary opinion may be derived by examining the deviation of each
period from the normal pressure.

As will presently be shown, the probable error of one of the values in
Table III is a variable quantity, having for its mean value 0.0095, while
at its maximum it is about 0.0122 and at its minimum 0.0058. If now
we compute a value for the middle day of each period from the periodic
function, in the same way as Table I, but to four places (which may be
regarded as representing accurately enough for the present purpose the
normal value of pressure for the period, aside from the irregularities now
under discussion), these normal values, subtracted from the successive
values of Tables III, will leave the following residuals:

It here appears that the periods following the March and May minima
and the January maximum deviate from the normal value in the oppo-
site direction from the adjacent critical value, and to an amount
exceeding the estimated probable error for the time of year, while the
periods preceding the January and September maxima appear to be
normal, the double maximum in these cases being produced by a rela-
tively high value of the period in which the anticipatory subordinate
maximum occurs, rather than by a relatively low value in the period
separating it from the true maximum. The effect of the disturbance in
March-April appears to be confined to the ninth and tenth periods, and
it produces that divergence of the computed and observed means for the
two months, previously noticed in connection with Table I.

The division of the year into thirty-six equal periods, in Table II,
gives the opportunity fora recomputation of Bessell’s periodic function.
The following are the coefficients of ten terms, based upon the thirty-six
periodic means. The first five or six terms may be regarded as replac-
ing by more accurate values the formula previously derived, and from
which Table I was computed; the concluding terms are, perhaps, chiefly

Mr. E. L. De Forest, in the Analyst for July, 1877, refers to a previous
paper of his own in which he has pointed out a simple test of the accu-
racy of the adjustment of a series of values subject to accidental variation.
The test quoted is in substance as follows: If the original (observed)
values be subtracted from the adjusted values, term by term, the result
is the series of residual errors. If the terms of this series be pointed
off into groups, by inserting a point of division at every change of sign,
the most probable number of terms occurring in groups of three or more
is 4 N+ .533 YN; where N denotes the whole number of terms of the
series, and the expression following the sign + is the probable error.
If the number of terms occurring in such groups falls short of $N by
more than the probable error, the inference is that the inequalities of the
series have not been smoothed out enough; but if it exceed 4 N by more
than the probable error, the series has been smoothed too much. From
the nature of the periodic function, the adjustment effected by it would
be expected to err (if at all) in the latter of these two directions. In
fact, when a series of residuals is formed by subtracting the terms of
Table II successively from the corresponding terms of Table I, the
number of terms or signs occurring in groups of three or more exceeds

half the whole number of terms by 79, while the probable error, .533 V 366,
is only 10.3. Though a closer approximation to a perfect adjustment
might probably be derived by the use of the more exact coefficients just
obtained, it seems preferable, for the purposes of comparison, to use a
different process of adjustment, and hence the method of successive
means has been employed. The arithmetical means between each term
of the series of Table II and the next succeeding term form the first
order of means, the second is derived in the same way from the first,
and so on until the tenth order of means is obtained, which constitutes
Table IV.

On applying the test of Mr. De Forest to this series the total number
of signs occuring in groups of three or more is found to be less than half
the whole number of terms by 18—a difference much less than that of
Table I, though nearly double the probable difference of a perfect
adjustment.

In respect to the treatment of the 29th of February, this table is less
accurate than the others; for the pressure for that date, as derived from
Table II, should in strictness have been allowed only one-fourth of the
weight of the other values; but as such a discrimination could not con-
veniently be made in the computation, the 29th was treated precisely
like the adjacent dates. In all the other tables due allowance is made
for the peculiarity of that date.

The sign + appended to numbers in Table IV indicates a fraction be-
tween 745 and 55. Smaller fractions are disregarded, and for larger ones
the third figure is increased by 1.

MEAN DEPARTURE FROM NORMAL VALUE, AND PROBABLE ERROR.

In describing the method of deriving the numbers which constitute
Table II it was shown that for each day of the year, along with the
mean pressure, another number was deduced, which was called ‘“ the
ATO DISCUSSION OF BAROMETRIC OBSERVATIONS.

mean of the departures of the daily means from the normal value.” The
series of the mean departures thus obtained is as follows, in thousands
of an inch of mercury :

An inspection of this table shows a marked annual variation. To
exhibit its law, the monthly means at the foot of the table were first
corrected for the unequal length of the months, and then used to com-
pute coefficients for Bessel’s periodic function. The resulting formula
is the following:

D=0.1775-+4.0607 sin (0-+76°.1)-+.0094 sin (20+218°.0)
+ ..0036 sin (304+275°.6)+.0016 sin (404+259°.6.)

The coefficients of the five terms here given exhibit a more satisfac-
tory convergence than any five successive terms in the formula for the
annual fluctuation of pressure, and indicate that the function in ques-
tion—the amount of atmospheric disturbance—is entitled to considera-
tion as a meteorological element governed by a simple law of change.
By differentiating the formula the function is found to have two nearly
equal maxima on December 11 and February 4, of which the latter is
the higher, their respective values being 0.2261 and 0.2275. Between
DISCUSSION OF BAROMETRIC OBSERVATIONS. AT1

these points the curve maintains a nearly uniform height, having its
minimum on January 1, when the value is 0.2254. The minimum for
the year is 0.1089 on July 23.

Besides its significance as an independent meteorological element, the
function may also be regarded in its relation to the probable error of
the numbers composing Tables II, II], and IV. Referring to the method
by which the mean departures were computed it will be seen that as the
number of daily means in excess of normal value varies but little from
the number in defect, the inaccuracy of the normal value of pressure as
derived from Table I must be too sight to affect appreciably the result-
ing formula for mean departure; hence this mean departure may be
regarded as identical with the mean of the errors of single daily means,
regarded as measurements of the true normal pressure. The ‘‘ mean
error” will then be found by multiplying the mean departure by the
constant 1.2533, or the probable error by multiplying it by 0.8453. Ap-
plying the latter factor to the extreme and mean values of the function
it appears that the probable error of a single daily mean is 0.1923 on
February 4, +0.09205 on July 23, and has a mean value of +0.1500. If
no daily means had been omitted in the records each of the numbers in
Table IL would have been derived from twenty-five daily means, and its
probable error would have been one-fifth that of the daily mean. But
in fact 184 of the 9,131 daily means are wanting, so that the average
number of means in a column is 24.496. Hence the factor by which the
probable error of a daily mean is to be multiplied a or 0.202.
The products, .0385, .0185, and .0303, are the extreme and mean vaiues
of the probable error of the numbers in Table II. Each of the numbers
in Table III is the mean of 10.15 numbers of Table II, hence the prob-
able errors of the values in Table III are: Maximum, .0122; minimum,
0058; mean, .00951.

Finally, Table IV is derived from Table IL by taking the tenth order
of means. Now, if from the series of terms T,, T:, T3, etc., m suecessive
orders of means be derived (m being an even number), the value of
that term in the mth order which corresponds to Tn is:

1

the coefficients being those of the mth power of a binomial.
Hence, supposing the probable error of each term of the original
series to be r, the probable error R of a term of the mth order will be:

m we —1)

i = 1+ +— tee. +m?+l 2.
If 10 be put for m in this oe we have
R=0.4198r.
A472 DISCUSSION OF BAROMETRIC OBSERVATIONS.

Hence the probable errors of the values in Table IV are the following:
maximum, February 4, 0.0163; minimum, July 23, .0078; mean, .01272.

It is to be observed that in all the above determinations of probable
error, the maximum and minimum values of the error, being derived
from Bessel’s function, are probably somewhat incorrect by not depart-
ing widely enough from the mean value, but the mean value itself is not
liable to such an error.

The probable error of the mean annual pressure, 29.7194, is +0.00159;
that of the mean of a single year is +0.00785.

BAROMETRIC RANGE.

Of the readings of the barometer at each of the regular tri-daily obser-
vations during a month, corrected for temperature, the highest and lowest
values are noted in the register at the end of the month, and the differ-
ence between them is recorded as the barometric range for the month.
The means of these ranges for like-named months in the twenty-five years
are the following: January, 1.255; February, 1.301; March, 1.186; April,
1.012; May, 0.875; June, 0.727; July, 0.615; August, 0.655; September,
0.846; October, 1.042; November, 1.221; December, 1.427.

It will be noticed that the annual fluctuation of barometic range
copies closely that of the mean departure of the daily mean. The mini-
mum in July, the double maximum in December and February, with
the intervening value for January, which, though lower than that of
either of the adjacent months, is higher than that of any of the remain-
ing nine; all these peculiarities are common to the two functions. They
differ, however, in the relative height of the two maxima, the December
maximum being in this case higher than that in February.

SECULAR VARIATIONS OF ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE AND DISTURBANCE.

Among the variations of meteorological elements supposed to have a
period of more than a year, two are embraced within the subject of the
present discussion, viz, that of atmospheric pressure, and that of atmos-
pheric disturbance, expressed by barometric range.

ty In Table VI the first column contains
N the names of the several years, from 1854
= to 1878, inclusive; the second column shows
the annual means of pressure, taken direct-
ly from the register. In order to eliminate
minor and irregular variations, the second
order of means of this series is taken, and
this constitutes the third column. The re-
maining column contains Wolf’s sun-spot
numbers, as given by Professor Loomis.
(Am. Journal of Science and Art, April,
1873, p. 247.) As the numbers are there
given only through 1871, Professor Loomis
has kindly furnished me with those for the
subsequent years. The table indicates a
fluctuation of annual pressure, having a
range considerably in excess of the prob-
able error of a yearly mean. The years
1856, 1864, and 1870 are those of minimum
pressure, while maxima fall on the years
1858, 1866, and 1874. Hence the period
appears to consist of about eight years,
with no manifest relation to that of the
sun-spots. (See adjoining diagram.)
Table VII shows the fluctuation of baro-
metricannualrange. Astherange of press-
ure attains its greatest extent each year du-
ring the winter months, the annual range
here considered is the difference between
the highest corrected reading of the baro-
meter in any one winter and the lowest
reading for the same winter; 7. é., the year
in which each range is taken begins July
1 and ends June 30. The second column
of the table contains the names of the
months in which these highest and lowest readings occurred, the month
of the maximum being named first in each case. The two columns fol-
lowing contain the extreme values of pressure, and the next column
(the fifth) contains the range or difference between them. The periodic
fluctuation of the numbers in this column is so marked as to admit of
taking four orders of means, by which the accidental variations are elim-
inated. The result of this process constitutes the sixth column. The
seventh and last column contains the series of sun-spot numbers; but
as the year to which any sun-spot number, as given by Wolf, belongs
has its beginning and end at January 0, instead of July 0, the sun-spot
numbers for this column are obtained by taking the first order of means

of Wolf’s series (that is, the mean of Wolf’s numbers for 1836 and 1837
is taken as the sun-spot number for the year 1836~37, the mean of the
given numbers for 1837 and 1838 as the number for 1837—38, ete.). In
this comparison the observations for the years 1836 to 1853, hitherto
omitted from this discussion, are included; for though in respect to the
absolute values of pressure these observations are not comparable with
the later ones, they may be considered as fairly comparable as far as
range is concerned, though less accurate.

of the fluctuation of mean range. But there is an additional peculiarity
of this fluctuation which appears to have nothing in common with that
of the solar spots except equality of period.

From each year of minimum sun-spots and maximum range to the
year of the opposite phases the progress is always uninterrupted, but
the rise of mean range from the latter point to its next maximum on the
year of the sun-spot minimum is checked in every instance nearly mid-
way, or when the sun-spot number is about 40, by a decline lasting in
each of the four cases through two years, after which the increase of
range is resumed.

The highest corrected barometer-reading since 1853 is 30.687 on Feb-
ruary 12, 1857, and the lowest is 28.509 on November 18, 1873. Their
difference, the range in twenty-five years, is 2.178 inches.

Of the appended diagrams, the first (divided into five sections, and
marked Parts 1 to 5, forming continuous curves for the year) shows the
barometric pressure for each day of the year, as given numerically in
Tables I, II, and IV. The full (or solid) line exhibits the daily values of
pressure directly from observations (Table II), while the fine dotted
curve shows the normal values computed from the periodic function
(Table I), and the intermediate broken (or coarse dotted) curve is taken
from the values given in Table IV. Vertical lines are inserted at inter-
vals, having the middle of their length placed at the height of the
annual mean (29.719), and showing by their extent upward and down-
ward the probable error of Table Il for the date. The probable error
of Table LV is also indicated by corresponding marks upon the vertical
lines.

AN ACCOUNT OF INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINAT-
ING MATERIALS.*

BY JOSEPH HENRY.

It has been the policy of the Light-House Board since its first estab-
lishment not only to adopt the latest improvements which have been
made in other countries, but also to add by original investigations to
the sum of knowledge on aids to navigation. In accordance with this
policy, the Board has endeavored to keep itself informed as to the prog-
ress of the light-house systems of other countries, and in the erection
of new towers and the supply of new apparatus to adopt those improve-
ments which have from actual experience been preferred; and, further-
more, the committee on experiments have devoted a portion of every
year to investigations which might develop new facts tending to greater
economy or efficiency in the various appliances by which the dangers of
navigation are diminished.

At the commencement of the operations of the Light-House Board, in
1852, sperm-oil was generally employed for the purpose of illumination.
This was an excellent illuminant, but as its price continued to advance
from year to year, it was thought proper to attempt the introduction of
some other material. The first attempt of this kind was that of the in-
troduction of colza-oil, which was generally used in the light-houses of
Europe, and is extracted from the seed of a species of wild cabbage,
known in this country as rape, and in France as colza. For this pur-
pose a quantity of rape-seed was imported from France and distributed
through the agricultural department of the Patent-Office to different
parts of the country, with the hope that our farmers might be induced
to attempt its cultivation. Although the climate of the country ap-
peared favorable to its growth, and special instructions were prepared
and distributed by the Light-House Board for its culture and the means
of producing oil from it, yet the enterprise was not undertaken with
any approximation to success, except in Wisconsin, where a manufactory
of rape-seed oil was established by Col. C. S. Hamilton, formerly of the

United States Army. To this manufactory the Light-House Board gave
special encouragement, and purchased at a liberal price all the oil that
could be supplied; the quantity however which could be procured was
but a small part of the illuminating material required for the annual
consumption of the Light-House Establishment.

The price of the sperm-oil still continuing to increase, the Board em-
ployed Prof. J. H. Alexander, a chemist of Baltimore, to make a series
of investigations on different oils, to ascertain a method of detecting
adalterations in them, and to determine the relative economical value
of different kinds of oil which might serve for use in light-houses. In
his report Mr. Alexander recommended, as a means of detecting adul-
terations in oil, a thermal test, which was based upon the amount of
heat evolved by mixing a given quantity of the oil with sulphuric acid
of a given specific gravity, and noting the rise of temperature as indi-
cated by a standard thermometer in a unit of time. For using this
method, it was proposed to ascertain by actual experiment the heat
evolved by mixing pure oils with a given quantity of acid, and afterward
oils adulterated with given quantities of lard or inferior oils. This in-
genious suggestion was however never reduced to practice. The method
was too refined; the difference of heat evolved was scarcely sufficient
to be noted unless great precautions were taken to prevent loss by ra-
diation and conduction, and consequently it could not be employed by
ordinary inspectors. In regard to lard-oil, Mr. Alexander failed to em-
ploy the proper method of burning it, and consequently rated it very
low on the seale of economical value as a light-house illuminant.

In this stage of the history of the subject we are presenting, the chair-
man of the committee on experiments commenced himself to investigate
the qualities of different kinds of oil, and was soon led to direct his at-
tention to the comparative value of sperm and lard oils. The experi-
ments made by Mr. Alexander were with small lamps, and the compari-
son in this case, as will be shown, was much against the lard-oil.

The first experiment of the new series consisted in charging two small
conical lamps of the capacity of about a half-pint, one with pure sperm-
oil and the other with lard-oil. These lamps were of single-rope wicks,
each containing the same number ‘of strands; they were lighted at the
same time, and the photometrical power ascertained by the method of
shadows. At first the two were nearly equal in brilliancy, but after
burning about three hours the flame of the lard had declined in photo-
metric power to about one-fifth of that of the flame of the sperm. The
question then occurred as to the cause of this decline, and it was sug-
gested that it might be due—first, to a greater specific gravity in the
lard-oil, which would retard the ascent of it in the wick, after the level
of the oil had been reduced by burning in the lamp; or, second, to a
want of a sufficient attraction between the oil and the wick to furnish
the requisite supply as the oil descended in the lamp; or, third, it might
INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS. 485

be due in part to the imperfect liquidity of the oil, which would also
militate against its use in mechanical lamps.

The lard-oil was subjected to experiments in regard to each of these
points. It was found, by the usual method of weighing equal quantities
of the two fluids, that the specific gravity of the lard was greater than
that of the sperm; and also by dipping two portions of the same wick
into the two liquids, and noting the height to which each ascended in a
given time, that the surface attraction of the sperm was greater than
that of the lard, or, in other words, the ascensional power of sperm was
much greater than that of lard at ordinary temperatures. This method
was also employed in obtaining the relative surface attraction of various
other liquids; we say surface attraction instead of capillarity, because
it was found in the course of these investigations that substances which
had less eapillarity—that is, less elevating power in a fine tube—had
greater power in ascending in the meshes of, a wick.

The relative fluidity of the different oils was obtained by filling in
succession a pear-shaped vessel, with a narrow neck, of about the ea-
pacity of a pint, having a hole in the lowest part of the bottom of about
a tenth of an inch in diameter. Such a vessel filled with any number
of perfect liquids would be emptied in the same time, whatever their spe-
cific gravity. As at any given horizon, inertia is directly proportional to
gravity, the heavier the liquid the greater would be the power required
to move it, but the motive power would be in proportion to the pressure,
or, in other words, to the weight, and therefore all perfect liquids should
issue from the same orifice with the same velocity. To test this propo-
sition, eight fluid ounces of clean mercury, and then the same bulk of
distilled water, were allowed to run out of the vessel above mentioned ;
the time observed was the same within the nearest second. It was found,
in repeating this experiment with sperm and lard oils that the rapidity
of the flow of the former exceeded considerably that of the latter; the
ratio of time being 100 to 167.

The results thus far in these investigations were apparently against
the use of lard-oil; it was observed however in the experiments on the
flow of the two oils on different occasions, that a variation in the time
occurred, which could be attributed only to a variation in the tempera-
ture at which the experiments were made. In relation to this point the
effect of an increase of the temperature above that of the atmosphere on
the flowing of the two oils was observed: By this.means the important
fact waselicited that as the temperature was increased the liquidity of
the lard increased in a more rapid degree than that of the sperm, and
that, at the temperature of about 250° F., the liquidity of the former
exceeded that of the latter.

A similar series of experiments was made in regard to the rapidity of
ascent of the oil in the wick, and with a similar result. At about the
temperature of that before mentiened, the ascensional power of the lard
486 INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS.

was greater than that of the sperm. These results were recognized as
having an important bearing on the question of the application of lard-
- oil as,a light-house illuminant. It only required to be burned at a high
temperature; and as this could be readily obtained in the case of larger
lamps, there appeared to be no difficulty in its application.

The previous trials had been with small lamps, with single solid wicks,
instead of the Fresnel lamp, with hollow burners. After these prelim-
inary experiments, two light-houses of the first order, at Cape Ann,
Massachusetts, separated by a distance of only 900 feet, were selected
as affording excellent facilities for trying, in actual burning, the correct-
ness of the conclusions which had been arrived at. One of these light-
houses was supplied with sperm and the other with lard oil, each lamp
being so trimmed as to exhibit its greatest capacity. It was found by
photometrical trial that the lamp supplied with lard exceeded in inten-
sity of light that of the one furnished with sperm. The experiment was
continued for several months, and the relative volume of the two ma-
terials carefully observed. The quantity of sperm burned during the
continuance of the experiment was to that of lard as 100 is to 104.

The freezing temperature of lard-oil depends upon the temperature
at which it was expelled by pressure from the animal tissues in which it
was contained. It is higher however than the freezing temperature of
sperm, on an average of from 3° to 4°, but this is a matter of no prac-
tical objection to the substitution of lard for sperm, since the heat
evolved from an Argand lamp is, in cases where the draught passes
through the reservoir, sufficient to keep the lard liquid even during the
lowest external temperature. Indeed, the small difference in tempera-
ture in freezing of the two oils is a matter of little moment, in cases
which frequently happen when the temperature of the atmosphere is
below zero on the Fahrenheit scale. At such a temperature, both oils
would become alike solid, unless some means were afforded for prevent-
ing the freezing.

The next step toward the introduction of lard-oil was the devising of
a system by which it could be inspected, and the Board assured, before
it should be too late to remedy the evil, that the lard purchased was of
a good quality. This was a matter of great importance, and involved
no small degree of responsibility, since the contractor was entitled to
his pay immediately after the acceptance of the oil, and while the quan-
tity purchased amounted annually to nearly 100,000 gallons.

The conclusion was arrived at that it was impossible, from any single
test that could be applied to small samples, to determine the quality of
the oil as applicable to light-house purposes; and that in the present
state of our knowledge as to its character the following tests are re-
quired to fully insure in all cases the required quality of the article:

1. Specific gravity at 60° F.

2. Liquidity at different temperatures.
INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS. 487

3. Freedom from acids or alkalies.

4, Resistance to freezing.

5. Actual burning in fifth-order lamps for at least ten hours.

6. Photometric power after burning one hour, and again after burning
ten hours.

7. The condition of the wick at the end of the burning.

These tests are of very unequal value, and several of them might be
dispensed with, were others reduced to an absolute standard determined
by the actual experience of burning in the light-houses.

The specific gravity of impure lard and of that which has been care-
fully refined differ but little, and hence, unless the experiment be made
by means of a delicate balance, the indications will be of comparatively
little value. Still, as a given sample might contain some foreign sub-
stance which is not usually mixed with this oil, the test with the hydrom-
eter should not be omitted.

In making this test, a cylindrical vessel containing the oil, of suffi-
cient diameter to permit the hydrometer to float freely without hinder-
ance from the sides, should be immersed in a vessel containing several
gallons of water, which, when once reduced to 60° by the addition of
ice-cold water, can, on account of the great specific heat of water, be
readily kept at that temperature by a slight addition of cold water from
time to time, the whole being continually stirred. It is scarcely neces-
sary to state that the vessel containing the oil must be so weighted at
the bottom that it will stand erect in the cold bath in which the experi-
ment is made. :

Liquidity at different temperatures is a test similar in character to
that of specific gravity ; although the difference in degree of liquidity of
different kinds of oil, such as sperm, whale, and lard, is very considera-
ble, the difference between different samples of lard-oil is small. Still,
this test, for a similar reason to that given for the specific gravity, should
be applied.

The test for free acids and alkilies is easily made, and should in no
case be omitted. A portion is put into beaker-glasses, with a slip of lit-
mus-paper in one and a slip of tumeric paper in the other, and suffered
to remain immersed perhaps twenty-four hours; and at the end of that

time, if one of these papers exhibits no redness and the other no brown-
ness, the oil may be considered void of free acid and of alkali, both of
which would lessen its value, the former tending to corrode the lamp
and the latter interfering with its burning quality.

Resistance to freezing is an important test, but not as easily applied
in the case of lard-oil as might at first be imagined. Lard-oil possesses
the remarkable property of resisting the influence of a low temperature
if suddenly applied, while it will freeze at a much higher temperature if
the cold be continued for several hours.

For example, if a small portion of lard-oil be placed in a test-tube and .
submitted to a rapid diminution of temperature by being plunged in a
488 INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS.

freezing-mixture, it will remain liquid at a temperature of 19° or 20°,
whereas it will congeal at a temperature of 40° if suffered to remain at
that temperature for several hours.

The plan adopted for determining the freezing-point of different sam-
ples of oil at one operation consisted in making a series of small open-
ings, or windows, closed with glass, in the side of a cylindrical wooden
tub about 24 feet in diameter. Concentric within this tub was placed
another cylindrical vessel, of smaller diameter, of zinc, filled with a
freezing-mixture of salt and pounded ice. <A series of small beaker-
glasses, filled with the several samples of oil, were placed opposite the
windows in the space between the two cylinders, each containing a ther-
mometer which could be read through the window. The whole was
then inclosed by a tightly-fitting cover, through which projected the
handle of a crank by which the freezing-mixture could be stirred. The
samples of the oil subjected to this cold-air bath gradually pass through
the several stages of a diminution in limpidity and clearness to opacity
and solidity, the time of each being noted.

The most reliable test is that of actual burning in a lamp of the fifth
order, and the measurement of the photometrical power. The objection
to the application of this test to the oil of every barrel is the large quan-
tity of oil required and the amount of labor involved in the proper exe-
cution of the process. Thus, in testing 60,000 gallons contained in casks
of forty gallons each, at least 500 gallons would be required. It is
therefore evident that this test can only be applied to samples selected
from a given lot, while the single barrels are proved to be of a similar
character by the more simple tests.

Another method of insuring that all the casks of a given lot contain
oil of the same quality, consists in taking a small equal portion from .
each of several casks and mingling them togetlrer; the quality of the
compound being ascertained by the application of burning or the other
tests. ‘

The determination of the photometrical power is, in the present state
of science, unless precaution is observed, a problem of some uncertainty.
The difficulty is of two kinds, the first to find a photometer which shall
give the ratio of the two lights, and, second, to find an invariable stand-
ard to which oil of the proper quality may always be referred. These
difficulties, I think, can be sufficiently overcome for the practical pur-
poses of the Light-House Board. The greater difficulty is that of ob-
taining a standard of reference. For this a sample of lard-oil manu-
factured by Mr. Alden, of Boston, was at first employed, but this, itself,
was-found to be variable, and hence we were obliged to adopt some
other standard. The one which has been finally adopted is English
sperm cand les, which burn with considerable uniformity at the rate of
120 grains per hour, or two grains per minute.

In regard to the investigation, the experiments were carried on under
many difficulties. They were made at first in the engineer’s office of the
INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS. 489

second light-house district in Boston, with such appliances as could be
procured at the moment, with the assistance of Mr. William Goodwin,
the acting light-house engineer, who took much interest in the subject
and rendered efficient service.

In the erection of a new lamp-shop at the Staten Island depot, care
was taken to make provision for a dark room in which the photometri-
cal examinations could be made with more precision than had been ob-
tained in the temporary apartments previously used. This room extends
the whole length of the building, is about 80 feet long by 12 wide; the
windows are closed by iron shutters to exclude the light; and the walls,
floor, and all other parts are painted black, after being sanded to remove
any glare which might exist.

In the first experiments on lard-oil the photometrical process employed
was that of Rumford, which consists in ascertaining the relative intensity
of two lights from their distances from a screen on which shadows of
equal darkness are thrown by an intermediate body. In this case the
relative intensities sought are indicated by the square of the distances
in inches and parts of inches of each light from the screen on which the
shadows are cast. But this method, which is used by the French man-
ufacturers of apparatus, and is very simple in theory, does not admit of
much accuracy.

The arrangement, therefore, known as Bunsen’s photometer, was in-
troduced in its stead, and this, with some peculiar modifications, leaves
nothing to be desired. This arrangement consists in placing two lights
at the extremity of a scale so divided into distances that the relative
intensity of the two flames may be immediately read off in terms of
candie-power when a small intermediate movable screen is equally illu-

minated on both sides. This screen is usually formed of a piece of white

pasteboard of about four inches square, fixed perpendicularly at right
angles to the length of the scale, in a sliding frame, by which it can be
brought nearer to or farther from one of the lights. In the center of
this square is a circular hole of about half an inch in diameter, which
is closed by a piece of thin paper, rendered translucent by a solution of
spermaceti in oil of turpentine. This forms a spot which is darker than
the other parts of the white screen, and is equally dark on both sur-
faces when the screen is receiving an equal quantity of light from each
flame; the screen is moved backward and forward until this effect is
produced, and the index will then point on the graduated scale to the
number of the relative power of one of the lights in the terms of the
other.

The screen may also be made of thin paper, the whole of which is
rendered translucent except a round spot in the center, of half an inch
in diameter. If a light is placed before the screen on one side, the
whole of the greased part will appear dark, on account of part of the
light going through the translucent portion. If, now, another light be
placed on the opposite side, an equal portion will be transmitted through
the peliucid part, and the two surfaces will appear of like intensity when
490 INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS,

the two lights are equal, or when from their respective distances they
throw equal amounts of light on the two faces of the screen.

In order that both sides may be seen at the same moment without
moving the head on one edge of the screen, two mirrors, making with
each other an angle of 90°, are placed so that the screen itself will
bisect the angle.

For dividing the seale into parts related to each other as the square
of their distances from a center, the following formula and table will
furnish the means. Let a be the length of the scale, and x the distance
from the candle end to the movable screen; then a—z is the distance
between the lamp end and the end of the screen. Denote the degree of
illuminination on the candle and lamp sides of the screen by L and L’/
respectively. Let the intensity of the candle end equal one candle,
while that of the lamp is n candles. Then, since the illumination of the
sereen varies directly as the intensity and inversely as tlte square of the
distance, we have the following proportion:

"so?" (q—a), and when L=L/ we have (a—a)’ =na’ whence

INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS. 491

The standard adopted with which to compare all other lights is, as
we have said, that of the London sperm candle, which, under ordinary
conditions, burns 120 grains of sperm per hour. If it burns more or
less than this amount during the trial, a correction of a proportional
amount is made in the results.

This standard however is too small for determining the power of
large lamps, and for this purpose an intermediate standard is provision-
ally adopted. For example, in determining the power of a lamp of the
first order, the power of a lamp of the fourth order is first obtained, and
this is used as a comparison with the larger lamp.

In the case of the arrangement at the Staten Island depot, for photo-
metrical measurements, three scales are employed, diverging from a
center at which the lamp to be measured is temporarily placed; at the
farther end of each scale is placed a sperm candle, to serve as the stand-
ard of comparison. These scales are of different lengths, one being
100 inches in length, another 150 inches, and the third 200 inches; be-
sides these, one of the scales is occasionally replaced by one of 700
inches in length, which is put up in sections.

As the semi-diameter of the burner of the lamp and that of the can-
dle must be included in the length of the scale, a portion of the latter
at each end is cut off. In adjusting the scales, therefore, to their places,
the measurement must be taken from the middle of each scale; thus, in
the case of the one of 200 inches in length, the middle of it must be just
100 inches from the center of the lamp on one side, and 100 inches from
the center of the candle on the other. In making the examination, three
observers simultaneously, one at each scale, take the photometric read-
ings, and the mean of the three results is adopted as the candle- power
of the light under examination.

In the examination of oil previous to purchase, as we have said be-
fore, a lamp of the fifth order is charged with the oil in question, and
when in a state of equilibrium of combustion it is subjected to the trial.
For greater precision ten readings are taken on one side of the scale,
and then the photometer is reversed and as many taken from the oppo-
site side. In this way the mean of sixty readings, twenty on each
scale, furnishes the data on which the character of the oil principally
rests. As a means of simultaneously weighing the candles for checking
the effects of their irregular burning, three balances are provided, each
of which bears one of the candles in a socket supported by a metallic
link, through which the scale-beam passes and is attached to the hook
of the scale-pan below.

On the opposite scale-pan a series of grain weights are placed, which
can be taken off without disturbing the equilibrium of the scale, by a
pair of pincers; the interval of time during which a given grain weight
is burned is marked by a watch. If the interval is equal to two grains
for each minute, the candle is burning at its normal rate; if not, a cor-
492 INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS.

rection is made by simple proportion, which is applied to the measure-
ment previously obtained.

The lamps containing the oil for trial are lighted and trimmed in an
adjoining apartment. They are introduced into the dark room through
a window closed with a sliding shutter. In order to prevent an over-
flow of oil at the burner by the oscillation of the liquid in the reservoir
by the agitation of transfer, each lamp is placed on a small carriage
moving on a railway, which, passing through the window, enables the
Jamp to be placed in its position with rapidity, and without the slight-
est disturbance of the equilibrium of the oil.

The temperature of the room is also noted, and, as far as possible, it
is kept at a heat of not far from 70°. For this purpose, during warm
weather the inspection may be made at night.

For reading the divisions on the scales in the dark room, a mirror is
employed to throw the light of the lamp under inspection on the grad-
uation.

To exclude all extraneous light, the three candles and the lamp to be
tested are each surrounded by a cylindrical sheet-iron screen, painted
black, through which a hole a little larger than the flame allows the light
to pass along the scale to the photometer. The trial-lamps are those of
the fifth order. Each, after it has been lighted, is allowed to burn an
hour before being submitted to the photometrical measurement. If it
gives a power less than 8 candles, the oil is rejected. If it passes that
test, it is then allowed to burn undisturbed without being trimmed for
8 or 9 hours longer, and if it is found at the end of that time to exhibit
no diminution in the brilliancy of the light it is considered worthy ot
adoption, especially if after this it continues to burn 4 or 5 hours with
no perceptible diminution which can be detected with the naked eye.
The best lard-oil will burn 16 hours without trimming.

Each candle before the measurement commences is suffered to burn
until it has assumed a perfect and uniform rate of consumption; it
should be prevented from guttering by removing a portion of the melted
spermaceti which may accumulate in the cup at the top of the candle
beyond the power of the feeble incipient flame to consume, by absorb-
ing it by one end of a strand of candle-wick cautiously introduced. If
any portion of the spermaceti is suffered to run down the side of the
candle and drop off below, the correction for variation in burning will
be worthless.

All materials for the use of the Light-House Establishment are pur-
chased by contract in accordance with published specifications as re-
gards quality and certain conditions. The award is given to the lowest
bidder, provided he can offer trustworthy surety as to his ability to
fulfill the contract. Preference is however given when bids are equal,
or nearly so, to the bidder who is a manufacturer of the oil and not a
mere vender of the article. During the inspection permission is granted
to the contractor to be present at the operation, in order that he may
INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS. 493

be assured that full justice is done him in the examination. After see-
ing the precision with which the photometric and other processes are
conducted, he is generally fully satisfied as to the results obtained, even
though his oil may have been rejected.

The oil is delivered in iron-bound casks, varying from 38 to 50 gal-
lons. These are placed, previous to inspection, under a shed and ar-
ranged in different lots, each containing oil of the‘same quality. From
different casks samples are taken in tin canisters of a capacity of about
half a gallon; each canister being marked with the number of the lot
and the cask from which the oil was taken. Before the sample is drawn
from the cask the oil within is thoroughly mixed by rolling the cask, or
by stirring. The object of this is to obtain in the sample an average
amount of solid matter which may be contatned in the oil.

The purest lard-oil is that which is manufactured by submitting the
solid leaf lard to great pressure during the coldest period of winter.
Oil of this quality is used for burning in small mechanical lamps; it
gives a bright flame and does not incrust the wick. The light-house
lamps however being of a much larger size and evolving a much
greater amount of heat, can consume oil of a coarser character; and
indeed it has been found that oil containing a certain amount of solid
matter, provided the latter is not too much in quantity to be consumed
by the lamp, gives a higher illuminating power. On this account, be-
fore this fact was generally known in the trade, complaints were made
of the Light-House Board giving the preterence to oil which, in the
market, would not be considered of the first quality.

The quantity of oil is estimated by weight, allowing 7.6 pounds per
gallon. It is weighed in gross and afterward emptied into large tanks
in an underground vault. The empty barrels are next weighed; the
weight of these deducted gives the net weight of the oil.

Previous to the establishment of the general light-house depot at
Staten Island, from which all the supplies are now distributed, and the
lamps and other light-house appliances are prepared for immediate use,
the oil was received at various ports along the coast, in accordance
with terms of the contract, and was stored until wanted for use, in cel-
lars hired for that purpose.

The Board however after the introduction of lard-oil, constructed
a spacious underground receptacle capable of containing 50,000 gallons
of oil, and retaining it during the whole year at a temperature not to
- exceed 65° Fahrenheit.

The underground vault contains five tanks, each of the capacity of
ten thousand gallons. On each tank is a register, consisting of a glass
tube so divided as to give the contents in hundreds of gallons. The oil
is delivered in three installments: The first on the Ist of May, the sec-
ond on the 10th of June, and the third on the 22d of July. The vault
and tanks were constructed under the direction of General Poe while
engineer secretary of the board, who also took a lively interest in the

introduction of lard-oil and in the preliminary experiments for deter-
mining its quality.

A photometer room was afterward fitted up in the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, in which several series of investigations were made in regard to
the illuminating power of different oils. At the same time a series of
experiments was undertaken relative to their chemical characters and
conditions; in which experiments the chairman was assisted by Prof.
C. M. Wetherill, whose untimely loss the science of this country has
been called to mourn. Among the investigations in the laboratory are
the following, relative to the expansions of different oils, intended to
facilitate the purchase, the measurements being made at different tem.
peratures. To obviate the necessity of the correction for temperature,
the oil is now purchased by weight. The following results may how-
ever be of value in the application of different oils to light-house pur-
poses:

REFRIGERATION OF THE OILS.

Those experimented upon were whale, sperm, refined lard, and crude

lard.
First experiment.

At 30°.2 F. they were all sirupy; in the crude lard-oil a yellowish
solid began to separate.

At 26°.6 the sperm-oil began to solidify.

At 24°.8 the refined lard began to yield a white precipitate.

At 179.6 the whale-oil was a thick sirup, without deposit. The crude
lard-oil was quite hard. The pure lard-oil was not as hard as the crude
lard-oil. The sperm-oil was not as hard as the pure lard-oil. These ex-
periments performed in test tubes.

Second experiment.

Upon pure winter-pressed lard-oil, in a test tube.

At 17°.6 F., begins to deposit flakes of solid matter.

At 14° is quite thick.

At 10°.4 it is perfectly solid.

If, now, the temperature rises, a small portion of the oil remains solid
until the temperature reaches 44°.6.

Third experiment.

The oils were placed in large cylinders and exposed to a temperature
of 24°.8 F., with the following results:
. Crude lard-oil, much sediment.
. Sperm-oil, ditto.
Pure refined lard-oil, a little sediment.
. Winter-strained lard-oil, very little sediment.
. Whale-oil, no sediment.

In the use of sperm-oil, it was found that the purer it could be ob-
tained the better, and hence it was the custom to strain the oil through
clean white sand previous to using it, and also the drippings. In the
case of lard however, it was found that removing all the solid matter
diminished its photometric power.
INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS 497

All fatty oils absorb oxygen, which unites with them to form oxides
of their combustible ingredients; oil therefore freely exposed to the air,
must in time gradually diminish in its power of combustion. It should
not, therefore, be open to the atmosphere when the oil is to be stored,
but covered with a thin wooden plane, which floats upon the surface of
the oil, and thus in a great measure excludes the air. The freezing of
lard-oil does not appear to affect its quality.

Considerable difficulty was experienced in the introduction of lard-
oil, on account of the objection to it on the part of the keepers; in some
cases from the want of experience in using it, and in others from the in-
terference of venders of sperm-oil. This difficulty however was obvi-
ated by a resolution of the board, by which any keeper that declared
his inability to burn lard-oil should be requested to resign, since it had
been abundantly proved that this oil, with proper management, could
be made favorably to compete with sperm. Its introduction was a mat-
ter of great importance in an economical point of view; it saved the gov-
ernment $100,000 annually for several years.

Another important step in the introduction of lard-oil was that of fur-
nishing a lamp which would burn it with the greatest perfection. This
was due to the invention of Mr. Joseph Funck, foreman of the lamp-
shop. As we have said, in order to burn lard-oil it is necessary it
should be kept at a high temperature, and for this purpose the heat of
the draught of the lamp was passed through the center of the reservoir.

Previous to the change in the illuminating material there had been
used in the Light-House Establishment three classes of lamps, viz, the
mechanical lamp for the first, second, and third orders, and the moder-
ator and fountain lamps for the fourth, fifth, and sixth orders.

In the mechanical lamp the oil was placed in a reservoir below the
burner, and pumped up by means of clock-work. This apparatus is of a
complicated character, and is subject to derangement. The valves must
be renewed from time to time, and the clock-work cleaned. The proper
performance of these operations is beyond the skill of an ordinary keeper,
and requires the frequent aid of a trained lampist.

The moderator lanip is less complicated, and was invented to obviate
the difficulties just mentioned. In this the oil is elevated by the descent
of a heavy piston, and forced up through a small conical hole, the flow
being regulated by the conical end of a wire, which is gradually with
drawn as the weight descends, so as te give a less-obstructed flow as
the hydrostatic pressure of the oil increases. From this arrangement
it takes its name of moderator lamp. This apparatus however is liable
to irregularity on account of derangement of the supplying apparatus,
the varying friction of the packing of the piston, as well as the change
in the flow of the quantity of oil, owing to its less liquidity due to a dimi-
nution in temperature.

The reservoir of the fountain-lamp consists in an air-tight vessel,
usually cylindrical, from the bottom of which descends a tube, terminat-

S. Mis. 31 2

498 INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS.

ing at the open end ina small cup, from which the burner is directly
supplied with oil on the well-known principle of the bird fountain, this
vessel being filled with oil by inverting it and pouring in the liquid
through the open end of the tube. It is then reinverted and the end of
the tube inserted in the small cup below the level of the oil which it
eontains. The oil in the reservoir in this condition is supported by the
pressure of the atmosphere on the surface of the oil in the cup. When
this surface is lowered by burning, the end of the tube is opened, and
a bubble of air passes up and an equal bulk of oil descends, and in this
way a nearly constant level of oil is maintained. I say nearly constant
because the air which goes up is of some volume and in the act of pass-
ing up produces an oscillation which, in some degree, affects the stead-
iness of the burning of the flame.

There is however a greater defect in this lamp from the oscillations in
the level when the reservoir has been exhausted of a considerable por-
tion of its charge of oil. In this case the arrangement is one similar to
an air thermometer with a large bulb, and is affected by a sudden draught
produced by the opening and shutting of a door or the ordinary ventila-
tion of the lantern. This was partly remedied by bending the tube, and
thereby increasing the resistance to a sudden change in the level of the
oil.

The improvement of Mr. Funck consisted in substituting for these
lamps one of constant level, in which the oil is placed above the burner,
and the flow of oil necessary for perfect combustion is regulated by a
small floating piston, placed in an enlarged portion of the supply-tube,
and carrying on its upper surface a conical projection which increases
or diminishes the size of the supplying orifice in accordance with the
rapidity of combustion. This lamp is not only free from the objections
pertaining to the other lamps, but is less expensive and better adapted
to the burning of lard-oil. It affords a freer combustion, and conse-
quently a more intense light, though at the cost of a larger amount of
the burning material.

In this lamp the heated air and products of combustion pass through
a cylindrical opening in the reservoir, which is placed directly above
the lamp, the opening in it forming as it were a prolongation of the
chimney, thus not only preventing the oil from freezing in the coldest
weather, but supplying it to the burner at the temperature best adapted
for perfect combustion.

In regard to the comparative character of lard and colza oil, we may
be allowed to print the following letter from Colonel Hamilton, the man-
ufacturer of the latter oil, who was present at the trial to which he

alludes :
Fonp pu LAc, WIs., May 16, 1868.

DEAR COMMODORE: I must confess my great disappointment at
the result of the experiments at Staten Island. It is however not really
so much the failure of rape-seed oil, as the undeniable excellence of lard-
INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS. 499

oil as a burner. I fully believe that our rape-seed oil of this year is as
good as any that was ever made in Europe, and I know it is far better
than any we have ever before made. Iam satisfied now that, for self-
heating lamps, there is no oil that will bear comparison with lard, but I
am equally satisfied that no colza oil will yield a better result than ours,
under exactly the same tests. We have but one more experiment to
make with colza; it is its extraction by chemical displacement. If this
fails, we sball abandon the whole business.

If all things are put together, I think the following statement will
be allowed, to wit: Our colza oil is equal to any foreign colza. It is better
than any wehave heretofore made. Itis betterthan sperm or any other
burner, excepting only lard-oil. Our failure then is owing to the supe-
rior excellence of lard-oil, which, under the persistent investigation of
the board, has been shown to be the best and cheapest safe illuminator
available.

The board are entitled to great credit in producing this result. It
will be remembered that but a few years since lard-oil was pronounced
unsuitable for light-house purposes, but the perseverence of the board
has brought out the fact that it is much the best and cheapest oil, and
that the expenses of lighting the coast and harbors have been thereby
greatly reduced. Surely the country at large should acknowledge this,
and give due credit to the board. We have endeavored to do with colza
what the board have effected with lard-oil, and we have been unsuccess-
ful both for ourselves and the light-house interest. The undertaking
has been no source of profit to us, and had the capital and time that
have been devoted to-colza been used in our other branch of manufac-
ture (linseed oil), it would at least have reimbursed us with a fair re-
munerative return. As regards the oil we have offered, we have hoped
the board would take it. I do not think we can improve upon the qual-
ity, and it is the last we shall venture to offer to the acceptance of the
board, for we shall henceforth abandon the manufacture, except for local
wants.

We are grateful to each member of the board for the interest they
have always shown in our undertaking, and for their uniform kindness
and courtesy. Accept, my dear commodore, for yourself and your asso-
ciates in the board, my warmest thanks for your many kind expressions
of interest, and believe me, truly and gratefully, yours,

C. 8S. HAMILTON.

Com. A. A. HARWooD, U.S. N.,

Secretary Light-House Board, Washington, D. C.

From the date of the introduction of lard-oil in 1865, 66, and ’67, until
the end of 1873, when the attention of the board was again directed to
the study of mineral oil, continual improvements were made in the pro-
cesses of its preservation and inspection, and also in the lamps and
other appliances for its employment, and nothing f urther as a light-house
500 INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS.

illuminant was required. It is therefore with regret that we are urged,
on account of the increased price of the article, due in some degree to
the reputation asa burning material given it by the board itself, to sub-
stitute for it a less reliable but a much more economical material.

At the time lard-oil was introduced a series of experiments was made
on the comparative value of the different petroleum oils used in this
country. They were however all considered too dangerous to be in-
trusted to the ordinary keepers of the light-stations of our coast. Since
the date however of these investigations, improvements have been made
in the manufacture of these oils, by which a much greater range has been
obtained in the temperature at which they give off an explosive vapor.
During the last two years, therefore, a new series of investigations has
been made relative to these illuminating agents, of which we propose in
the succeding pages to give a brief account.

The crude petroleums of the Pennsylvania oil region are of a greenish
or yellowish appearance, and have a specific gravity of 45° to 49°
Beaumé, at a temperature of 60° Fahrenheit. Some are so volatile as
to evaporate rapidly at the ordinary temperature of the air, rendering it
dangerous to approach an open cask of crude petroleum with a flame;
others are much less volatile, requiring a temperature of from 200° to
300° F. to vaporize them. The volatility of the hydro-carbons is inti-
mately connected with their specific gravity. They become heavier as
the volatile ingredients are driven off by heat. The inflammability of
the oils is also connected with their volatility and the specific gravity.
The light volatile oils ignite, as we have said, on the approach of a burn-
ing match at ordinary temperatures, while the heavier require a higher
temperature forignition. The process of manufacturing these oils con-
sists in separating them from each other as they occur in the crude oil
of the springs by what is called fractional distillation ; for this purpose
the crude oil is placed in an iron still provided with a worm of the same
metal submerged in a tank of water for cooling it; the still is then grad-
ually heated ; the first product that passes over is gaseous at ordinary
temperatures, and can only be condensed into a liquid form by cooling
the worm with ice, or by compressing the gas with an air-pump into a
strong receiver. After all the vapor is given off at the temperature, say
at 90° I., the temperature of the liquid in the still is raised, a liquid is
produced which exhales in vapor at a higher temperature and is of
greater density—and so on, a series of liquids are produced, each of
which requires to be heated to a higher degree before taking fire on the
approach of a lighted match—these more volatile vapors are heavier
than atmospheric air, and when suffered to escape from the cask con-
taining them in a separate state will flow along the surface of the floor
of a room, and reaching a distant fire-place will ignite, and burning
backward to the reservoir will set fire to the oil from which they ema-
nated.

Many serious accidents have occurred in this way, by the firing of a
INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS. 5O1

canister containing petroleum oil which has been left open, although at
a distance in some cases of from 20 to 30 feet from a lighted fire. An-
other source of danger from the lighted oils from which the more volatile
vapors arise results from the fact that these vapors when mixed with a
certain portion of atmospheric air explode on the approach of a flame
with extreme violence. When the proportions of vapor and air are
equal no explosion takes place; but when they are in the ratio of 10
parts of the vapor in volume to 100 parts of air the explosion is most
violent; when the quantity of air or of petroleum vapor is increased or
diminished the explosion is less violent until one or other becomes ex-
cessive, when the vapor kindles without explosion, as is the case with
ordinary street gas when issuing from the burner.

A notable case of the explosive quality of a mixture of petroleum
vapor and air occured in connection with the light-house service in 1864,
on Lake Michigan. The keeper in one of the light-houses of this dis-
trict substituted on his own responsibility an ordinary kerosene lamp of
tinned iron, for the usual lard-oil lamp. This gave a good light and re-
quired no trimming during the night; it burned well for several nights,
and the keeper congratulated himself on the success of what he consid-
ered a very important experiment. Unfortunately however on the last
morning that the lamp was used, he attempted to put itout in the usual
way by blowing the air from his lungs down the chimney, when an ex-
plosion took place, which scattered the oil in a burning state over the
deck of the tower and also on his clothes; in his fright he ran down
the stairs of the tower, and had scarcely reached the ground when a
violent explosion was heard above, which blew off the whole lantern
and broke the lenticular apparatus.

The explanation of these two explosions is not difficult. The burning
of the oil during the night left a space void of the liquid in the reser-
voir of the lamp, which was filled with air and vapor, which happened
on this occasion to be near the explosive proportions ; on blowing air
down the chimney it mingled with the vapor furnishing the quantity
necessary for the violent combination, and consequently the explosion
occurred which broke the lamp. The second explosion was caused by
the ascent of the vapor from the burning oil on the deck, and took place
when the quantity exhaled amounted to a tenth part of the volume of
air present. The two then suddenly rushed into combination, producing
the effects that we have mentioned.

Under favorable circumstances this lamp lighted with kerosene might
have burned silently for several weeks, but in accordance with the doe-
trine of chances, time enough being given, an explosion was inevitable.
Facts of this kind in connection with the difficulty experienced in burn-
ing mineral oil in light-house lamps induced the Light-House Board to
adopt lard-oil.

Various experiments have however been made from time to time by
the Light-House Board with a view to the introduction of petroleum as
502 INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS.

an illuminating material, as soon as oil could be obtained in this country
of a suitable character, lard-oil having advanced in price to such a de-
gree as to render this change desirable in an economical point of view.
In the mean time experiments had also been made in France and
England for the purpose of introducing mineral oil as a light-house illu-
minant, but it was not until 1873 or 1874 that the result was entirely
satisfactory.

The process of manufacturing the oil has been very much improved
in this country of late years, and there are now several companies which
profess to produce oil entirely safe, and otherwise suitable for light-
house purposes. In view of further experiments with mineral oil, an
advertisement was inserted in the papers, in 1874, requesting man-
ufacturers to send samples of their oils to be tested at the Light-House
depot at Staten Island, and in accordance with this a number of speci-
mens were received and submitted to examination.

The first test to which the oils thus furnished were submitted was
that of flashing, that is, the determination of the temperature at which
the oil gives off a vapor which will flash into a flame on the approach of
a Small taper, or, in other words, which indicates the rise of a vapor
which, mixed with atmospheric air, will tend to produce an explosion.
The flashing temperature differs however from that at which the liquid
takes fire as a whole. This will be understood if we suppose that two
liquids have been mixed together, a light and a heavy one; the flash in
this case will be due to the vapor from the lighter mixture, while the
burning is due to the temperature at which the compound is fired. To
make this flashing test requires considerable precautions. First, the oil
to be tried is gradually heated by a spirit-lamp in a water-bath, a sensi-
tive thermometer being suspended in the oil with the bulb slightly be-
low the surface, the heat of the water is very slowly increased by re-
moving from time to time the spirit-lamp from under the basin of the
water-bath which contains the oil, and the point of flashing is obtained
by passing over the surface of the oil a small flame until the first indi-
cation of flash is observed. The flame should not be so large as to heat
the surface, and is best produced by a very small jet of gas from a glass
tube drawn nearly to a point and connected with the gas pipe of the
house by a tube of India-rubber, the quantity of gas being regulated by
a stop-cock, so that the flame is a mere pencil of light about a quarter
of an inch in length and a twentieth in diameter. The basin which
contains the oil is about four inches in diameter, and is sometimes coy-
ered with a plate of thin glass, the thermometer passing through an ap-
erture in this cover, and a larger hole being left open in the same for
inserting the pencil of the flame. The basin containing the oil is some-
times left entirely open, the cover being discarded, but we do not think
this as safe a method as the other. Great caution must be taken in
raising the temperature very gradually, so that every part of the liquid
may have the same heat and the thermometer thus truly indicate the tem-
INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS. 503

perature. If the rise of the temperature be very sudden, the thermom-
eter will not respond, and the real flashing temperature will be higher
than that which is indicated.

The next test is that of firing of the mass of the liquid, which is some-
times 10 or 12 degrees higher than that of the flashing temperature, but
generally the two are very near each other. |

The next test is the determination of the specific gravity. This was
obtained by weighing, in a glass flask with a narrow neck, an equal
quantity of distilled water and of the oil in question; the ratio of the
two, reduced to water as unity, gave the specific gravity required. To
facilitate the operation, a flask, containing just 1,000 grains of distilled
water, was balanced by a permanent weight. The scales were tested
by double weighing. The first series of weighing was made at the tem-
perature of 74° F., that of the apartment in which the experiment was
conducted; but oil and other substances change their bulk, and conse-
quently their specific gravity, with a change of temperature. It is
therefore necessary, in order that results may be compared, that the -
experiments be all made at the same temperature, or reduced to a stan-
dard temperature. The temperature formerly adopted in England for
specific gravity is 62° F.; but in the case of petroleum, the temperature
of 60° has been adopted in this country and England. In the first series
of experiments made with the oils in question, the weighing was con-
ducted at a temperature of 749, as we have said, namely, that of the
atmosphere at the time. A series of experiments at a lower temper-
ature was afterward made, in order to obtain a correction by which to
reduce the specific gravity first obtained to that of a temperature of 609°;
but as each oil exhibits a different rate of expansion by heat, the process
became very laborious. Experiments were therefore made to determine
the correctness of obtaining the specific gravity of the oils by means of
a hydrometer. ~This was found to differ from that obtained by weigh-
ing within one per cent., and was therefore concluded to be sufficiently
accurate for practical purposes.

To obtain the specific gravity of the oils by means of a hydrometer,
a vessel containing, say, 10 gallons of water, of a depth of about 14
inches, is provided ; into this are introduced several glass cylinders con-
taining the oil, and into these cylinders the hydrometers are plunged,
the level of the oil being so far above the water that the under contact
of the surface of the liquid with the scale may be observed. Before
inserting the glass cylinders containing the oils into this water-bath,
the liquid is brought, by mixing ice-water with it, to the temperature of
60°, at which temperature it may be kept for a long time, on account of
the large quantity of the liquid and the great specific heat of the water.
A change of temperature may be prevented by occasionally adding a
small quantity of ice-cold water, care being taken to mingle the mixture
by stirring. By this process may be obtained the specific gravity at 60°
of a large number of samples in a comparatively short time. In this
504 INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS.

country and England the density or relative weight of petroleum oils is
generally expressed in terms of the arbitrary scale of Beaumé’s, instead
of that of the specific gravity. The following table gives the equiva-
lent of the Beaumé scale in terms of specific gravity:

Another test to which the mineral oil was subjécted was that of a
reduction of temperature. For this purpose the samples were placed
in an air-bath reduced to the temperature of 25° F. At this tempera-
ture several of the oils exhibited a thickened condition, especially those
of the higher fire-test. The apparatus used for this purpose was the
same as that previously described as employed in the case of lard-oil.

The next test to which the oil was subjected was that of its liquidity.
This test is of some importance in regard to lamps in which the oil is
pumped up by machinery, and also as to the solid matter in the oil. It
therefore gives a characteristic of the oil which with others serves to
determine its degree of impurity. For this purpose the same method
was employed as that described for determining the liquidity of lard-
oil. The liquidity exhibited by this process was very different in differ-
ent oils.

All the experiments on the flowing of the oils were made at the tem-
perature of the air, which was from 72° to 74°. In this case, as with
lard, a marked difference was found in the time of flowing at different
temperatures, and hence for comparison the experiments should be made
at a standard temperature. '

Another experiment was made to ascertain whether oils of higher
flashing test gave off a vapor at the ordinary temperature of the atmos-
sphere; for example, at about 70°. For this purpose a barometer tube
of about 53 inches in length, and’an interior diameter of one-half of an
inch, was filled with warm mercury inverted in a basin of the same
metal. The finger was then placed under the open mouth of the tube
in the basin and the tube slowly inverted so as gradually to pass the
INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS. 505

vacuum through the whole length of the column, and thus to gather up
any particles of air that might adhere to the side of the tube; this left
a space, when the inverted tube was held vertically, of about three
inches of the open end of the tube unfilled with mercury; this being
refilled, the finger applied to the open end and the tube again replaced
with the open end downward in the basin, the vacuum produced by this
process was nearly as perfect as if the mercury had been boiled in the
tube, or the latter filled with the metal in avacuum. After this, a small
quantity of oil to be tested was drawn into a small glass syringe, the
curved point of which being introduced beneath the open mouth of the
tube under the surface of the mercury, a small quantity of the liquid was
injected into the column; this rapidly rose by its levity to the top, and
there a portion of it flashed into vapor, aS was evident by the depres-
sion of the mercurial column.

From this experiment it is evident that kerosene, even of a high flash-
ing temperature, does give off vapor at ordinary temperature. It is
however of so feeble tension that it does not appear capable of produc-
ing explosion unless considerable time be allowed for its accumulation.
It might not be apparent that although vapor was given off in a vae-
uum, as in this case, it would be given off under the full pressure of
the atmosphere; but it has been shown by the experiments of Mr. Dal-
ton and others, that vapors diffuse themselves in a space filled with
atmospherie air with the same elasticity and quantity as in a vacuum,
time only being required to produce the effect in the atmosphere.

The oils were also examined as to the remains of any free acid which
they might contain, by simply immersing in each sample a slip of litmus
paper, which was suffered to remain in the liquid for 24 hours; under
this test several of the samples exhibited a redness, denoting the pres-
ence of an acid which might corrode the metal of the lamps, also indi-
cating the want of a thorough washing of the oil by an alkaline water.

Another experiment, which was exhibited to us by one of the proprie-
tors of the oil which has a flashing test of about 140° F., consisted in
lighting a lamp-wick charged with the oil and plunging it into a vessel
filled with the same. The oil did not take fire, although the combustion
of the wick was vigorous, and, indeed, the flame was put out when the
wick was plunged beneath the surface of the oil. This experiment,
which is frequently exhibited to the public, tends to give a sense of
safety in the use of mineral oil which is at least im some degree falla-
cious. To illustrate this, the following experiments were made: First a
slip of cotton cloth, about 6 inches wide and 2 feet long, was saturated
with oil having a flashing test of 140°, and suspended vertically from a
ring-stand; alighted match was then applied to the middle of the length
of the slip, when it instantly took fire, and burned with a fierceness
which was truly appalling.

After this two pieces of cloth, one of cotton and the other of woolen,
were saturated with petroleum and placed flat on two pieces of tinned

.

iron to protect the floor. On each of these was then dropped an ordi-
nary friction match in a state of ignition. They both broke instantly
into flames, which soon entirely consumed the cloth, although but little
air could obtain access to its under side, and notwithstanding the good
conducting power of the tinned iron.

In a similar experiment made with the same cloth saturated with
lard-oil the cloth did not take fire when a lighted match was dropped
upon it. Two cotton cloths the same size were saturated, one with lard-
oil, the other with petroleum, and lighted at the same time. The petro-
leum cloth was consumed in 1 minute 23 seconds; the lard cloth in 5
minutes.

To render these experiments more strikingly applicable to cases of
accident which might occur in a light-house, 4 piece of cotton cloth
about 2 feet square, which had been used to wipe the table on which
kerosene had been spilled, was crumpled up into the condition of an
ordinary dish-cloth and thrown into a corner of the room. When a
lighted match was dropped on this it instantly took fire and burned
with a fierceness truly alarming.

These experiments are important in establishing the fact that oils
which are commonly sold as entirely free from danger are not really so.
They may be safe from explosions at ordinary temperatures, and in this
respect are to be preferred to the lighter oils; but when spread over a
large surface they burn with greater intensity, even, as we have seen,
on a surface of ice. Indeed, the results are so striking it might be well
to repeat them in the presence of every light-house keeper, in order to
impress him with an idea of the danger which might be apprehended in
spilling the oil over his clothes or in carelessly dropping his matches on
cloths which had been used in cleaning the apparatus.

Among the peculiar properties of mineral oil is its great surface-
attraction or power of adhering and spreading on other surfaces, as well
as ascending wicks to a much greater altitude than other oils. This
property is recognized by the housekeeper who finds the exterior of the
lamp covered with a film of oil shortly after it has been subjected to a
thorough cleansing. It rises along the interior surface of the lamp and
spreads over the outside. On account of this property it can be freely
burned in lamps of which the fountain is at a considerable distance
below the flame, and in which no overflow is required to produce a bril-
ant combustion.

A series of experiments was next made with regard to the burning
qualities of mineral oils of different densities, from which it was inferred
that the lighter oils in lamps of the fourth order gave a greater amount
of illumination than the heavier oils, and, furthermore, that the latter
charge the wick more than the former, from which it would appear that,
in using mineral oil, while safety should be the prominent consideration
on the one hand, in the choice of the material, regard must be had on
the other to the illuminating power.

In regard to the relative photometric power of lamps of the same
INVESTIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ILLUMINATING MATERIALS. 507

order charged with mineral and with lard oil, all the experiments we
have yet made on this point tend to the conclusion that in smaller lamps
with the more volatile oils a greater photometric power is obtained than
with the same lamp when charged with lard-oil; but with the larger
lamps the reverse is the case, the lard giving greater power burned in
these lamps than the mineral oil.

An unexpected difficulty arose in the course of the investigations for
the introduction of mineral oils on account of the form of the flame.
While a lamp with a constricted chimney, like that used in the German
student-lamp, gave the greatest photometrical power, it was found that
the shape of the flame did not correspond with the arrangement of the
lens-apparatus, a large portion of the light being thrown upward toward
the sky and another toward the earth. It was only after a series of
trials with chimneys of different forms and button-detlectors that a flame
of the best shape was obtained. To compare these flames in actual use,
they were placed in succession in a light-house, with a lens of the fourth
order, and the photometrical power determined at different distances,
from a mile to ten miles in extent, by interposing between the eye and
the light a series of thin colored glasses, until the light was totally ex-
tinguished. It was found in these experiments that some of the flames
that had an appearance of greater brilliancy near by failed to produce
comparatively the same effect at a greater distance. Having settled
upon the form of the flame to be used in lamps of the lower orders, ar-
rangements have been made for the introduction of mineral oils into all
the stations in the third district, at which lights of the fourth and
smaller orders are at present in use, The substitution of mineral for
lard oil however is a matter of no small difficulty, and requires to be
made with great precaution. An entire change in all the lamps is re-
quired; the several parts of the apparatus which in the case of lard-
oil lamps were united by soft solder must now be joined with spelter.

The importance of this was evinced by an accident which happened
in the photometric room in the case of a lamp of the fourth order under
trial; the heat unsoldered an air-tube and let down the oil from the res-
ervoir on the flame, which produced so fierce a combustion that it would
have set fire to the building had it not been of fire-proof materials.

The gradual introduction however of mineral oil will be made as
rapidly as experience indicates the best and safest mode of employing
it. It has already been adopted in the smaller lamps for lighting the
Mississippi and its principal tributaries. The substitution however 1s
not on account of the superior quality of this oil in comparison with
lard, since we think the latter as an illuminating material is inferior to
no other at present in use, but simply on account of the comparative
cost of the two materials.

The comparative cost of the two materials will be definitely ascer-
tained after we have determined the best form of lamps to be used.
Experiments thus far have been principally confined to the lower orders

of lamps.
A SYNOPSIS

OF THE SCIENTIFIC WRITINGS OF SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL,

By EpwWarp S. HOLDEN AND CHARLES S. HASTINGS.

I.—INTRODUCTORY NOTE.

The astronomical life of Sir WiLLIAM HERSCHEL covered forty-two
years. During this period he published no less than sixty-nine different
memoirs, which are scattered through the annual volumes of the Philo-
sophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London from 1780 to 1818.

Two generations have passed since his death, and we have no readier
means of studying his works than in the original volumes of the Trans-
actions, now become rareand costly. Students of astronomy and physics
are thus often compelled to know his writings at second-hand from text-
books, and not in the vigorous and ardent style of the original. The
text-books also frequently quote him incorrectly, and have thus helped
to spread erroneous notions not only of what he said, but of the facts
themselves.

HERSCHEL’S long life was all too short, and his assistance was too
small to allow him to put even his published work into a final definite
form. He has once given us a hint of what he desired, and it seems
searcely less than a duty for his successors to carry out his wishes.

At the end of his memoir of 1811, HrerscHEn added a synopsis of its
contents made paragraph by paragraph; this synopsis (which is given at
pages 87-89 of this work) serves to summarize and to enforce his, views,
and to condense his arguments. His style lends itself to this condensa-
tion. The synopsis of 5 pages contains all the material facts of the
main paper of 67 pages, and the course of the argument can be plainly
followed. ;

In the absence of an edition of HERSCHEL’Ss collected works, a want
whose fulfillment still seems far off, we have thought that we could
hardly render a better service than to carry out for all of his writings
the idea which he executed for only one. The model has been set by
himself. We have simply followed this, and have given a synopsis of
each of his memoirs in the Philosophical Transactions, following his own
plan: The papers on astronomical subjects have been condensed by
Professor HOLDEN; those on physics by Dr. HAsTInGs. The works of
HERSCHEL published elsewhere have not been included in the synopsis,
as they are comparatively unimportant. are
510 BIBLIOGRAPHY OF HERSCHEL’S WRITINGS.

It is not supposed that such synopses as these will replace the origi-
nal memoirs for the professional astronomer and physicist. The works
of a great philosopher to be truly mastered must be studied in the
form in which he gave them. Yet those who are most familiar with the
originals will find the present volume most valuable.

The full subject-index will direct attention to special points. It is
hoped that the work in its present form will be of service in various
ways, which do not need suggestion here.

343‘ MAUPERTUIS accounts for the periodical appearances of changeable
stars by supposing that they may be of a flat form, like Saturn’s
ring, which becomes invisible when the edge is presented to us.”

343 This star ‘‘appeared always fuli and round when I viewed it with a
telescope”; this is not necessarily opposed to MAUPERTUIS’ explana-
tion on account of the aberrations.

344 ‘KEILL says ‘it is probable that the greatest part of this star is cov-
ered with spots and dark bodies, some part thereof remaining lucid;
and while it turns about its axis, does sometimes shew its bright
part, sometimes it turns its dark side to us, ete.’”

512 Explanation of the method used by HERSCHEL.

513 The instrument used was a Newtonian reflector 6 feet 8 inches focal
length, (usual), magnifying power 222 diameters, the aperture used
was four inches. ‘I believe that for distinctness of vision this in-
strument is perhaps equal to any that was ever made.”

514 Observations in detail from November 30, 1779, to February 19, 1780.

517‘ From these observations I believe it is evident that the height of
the lunar mountains in general is greatly overrated; and that when
we have excepted a few, the generality do not exceed half a mile
in their perpendicular elevation.”

518 ‘‘One caution, I would beg leave to mention to those who may uso
the excellent 34 feet refractors of Mr. DoLLOND. The admirable
quantity of light, which on most occasions is so desirable, will prob-
ably give the measure of the projection somewhat larger than the
true, if not guarded against by proper limitations placed before the
object-glass.”

W781 = 71 «115 Astronomical Observations on the rotation of the planets ronnd their axes,
made with a view to determine whether the carth’s diurnal motion is per-
fecily equable. Ina letter from Mr.WiILLIAM HERSCHEL, of Bath, to
WILLIAM Watson, M. D., F. R. 8. Read January 11, 1781.

115 While every one of the motions of the earth that arise from the actions
of the sun, moon, and planets, etc., have been investigated by as-
tronomers, there is one motion which has hitherto escaped the
scrutiny of observers—the diurnal rotation round its axis.

116 The reason why this has not been looked into is probably the diffi-
culty of finding a proper standard to measure it by; since it is itself
the standard by which we measure all the other motions.

We have no cause to suspect ‘any very material periodical inequality.

Aberration would forever have remained a secret to us if it had not
been found out by other methods than that of time-keepers.

No time-keeper will measure such equal portions of time as we require
to compare the diurnal motion of the earth to.

The diurnal rotation of the earth being at least tolerably equable,
that of the other plancts is likely to be also; and this suggested the
thought of estimating the diurnal motion of one planet very exactly
by that of another, making each the standard of the other.

Such a test might detect a retardation occasioned by some resistance
ofa very subtle medium in which the heavenly bodies perhaps move,
or any acceleration from some cause or other.

The common account of the diurnal rotations of the planets was much
too inaccurate for this critical purpose, and new observations were
required.

Mars was the most suitable planet for the purpose, as the dark spots
on Jupiter change their places. These may be supposed to be large
black congeries of vapors and clouds swimming in the atmosphere
of Jupiter.

The bright spots also, though they may adhere firmly to the body of Ju-
piter, may undergo some change of situation by being differently cov-
ered or uncovered, ononeside or the other, by alterations in the belts.

The same bright spat, not suspected of any change of situation, gave
by one set of observations 9" 51™ 45:.6, and by another set 98 50™ 488,

The analogy of the trade-winds on the earth may account for all the
irregularities of Jupiter’s revolutions deduced from spots on the dise

If, with CassINI, we suppose his rotation-time to be 92 56™, then some
spots that I have observed must have been carried through about
60° of Jupiter's equator in 22 of his days. This very large velocity
in the clouds is not unparalleled by what has happened in our own
atmosphere.

The spots on Mars are of a different nature. Their constant and de-
termined shape, as well as remarkable color, show them to be per-
manent, and fastened to the body of the planet.

Suppose that we can determine whether a spot on the dise of Mars is
or is not in the line which joins the center of the earth and the cen-
ter of that planet to half an hour’s time with certainty, in this case
we shall in 30 days have the revolution true to a minute, and in
three months to 20%. An interval of about 780 days (the next oppo-
sition) will give the diurnal motion true to about 2%, ete.

Had such observations as these been made 2000 or 200 years ago, we
might now, by repeating them, most probably become acquainted
with some curious minute changes that may have hitherto passed
unnoticed.

The difference between the polar and equatorial diameters of the
earth is by actual measurement 36.9 miles, by theory 33.8, from
which it should seem probable that when the earth assumed the
present form the diurnal rotation was somewhat quicker than it is
at present. But I would not lay much stress upon this argument.

The telescopes used were of my own construction, and are a 20-feet
Newtonian reflector, a 10-feet reflector of the same form, and the 7-
feet reflector already mentioned (Phil. Trans. 1780, p. 513).

The time was determined with a brass quadrant of 2 feet radius, car-
trying a telescope magnifying 40 diameters.

Two very good clocks were used; one having a deal pendulum rod
and one a compounded one of brass and iron, both having a proper
contrivance not to stop when winding up. The rate of going of my
clocks I determined by the transit of stars.

Observations on Jupiter in the year 1778. February 24—April 12.
(See Plate V, Figs. 1 to 12, drawings of Jupiter.)

Observations on Jupiter in 1779. April 14—April 23. See Plate V,
Fig. 13 [misprinted 18].

Comparing the observations two and two the following times of one
synodical revolution :

9h 54™ 568.4 from an interval of 17 revolutions;
95 55™ 208 from an interval of 12 revolutions ;
9h 55™ 24s from an interval of 15 revolutions;
98 55™ 48.6 from an interval of 41 revolutions;
9h 55™ 408 from an interval of 1 revolution;
9b 54™ 588.2 from an interval of 29 revolutions;
9b 54™ 538.4 from an interval of 26 revolutions ;
9 51™ 35s from an interval of 12 revolutions;
9h 51™ 458.6 from an interval of 12 revolutions;
9b 50™ 48s from an interval of 10 revolutions;
95 51™ 198.4 from an interval ot 22 revolutions; combining the
two preceding.

These several results are so various that it is evident that Jupiter is
not a proper planet for this critical purpose. This great variety
cannot proceed from inaccuracy in the observations; for, in my
opinion, it is not possible to make a mistake in the position of a spot
which shall amount to 5 minutes of time, as was proved by the ob-
servation of April 23, 1779.

The synodical revolutions have not been reduced to sidereal ones.

By a comparison of the different periods it appears that a spot grad-
ually performs its revolutions in less time than it did at first. Ex-
amples of this are given.

This is consonant with the theory of equatorial winds.

Observations on Mars in the year 1777. (April 8—April 27.) See Plate
VI, Figs. 14—19, drawings of Mars.

Observations on Mars in the year 1779. (May 9—June 17.) Figs.
20—23, drawings of Mars.

Comparing the observations of 1779 two and two the periods are:

24h 3$8™ 15.5 from an interval of 2 revolutions;
245 34m 15.5 from an interval of 2 revolutions;
24h 38™ 58.9 from an interval of 36 revolutions;
246 38" 58.4 from an interval of 38 revolutions ;
245 38™ 208.3 from an interval of 34 revolutions.

Method of reducing synodic revolutions to sidereal (see Fig. 24, dia-
gram).

The sidereal periods from observations of 1777 and 1779 are:

246 39™ 238.03 from an interval of 768 revolutions;
245 39m 188.94 from an interval of 763 revolutions;
24h 39™ 238,04 from an interval of 763 revolutions.

248 39™ 218.67 the adopted sidereal revolution of Mars on his axis.

whole number of revolutions; I, a mistake in estimating the time
when a spot comes to a certain place; III, the [determination of
the] time may be in error.

A mistake in the whole revolutions would have made an error of 1“ in
the concluded rotation time, and the agreement of the three results
shows that no such mistake has been made.

The second cause of error is of some force. An error of 10™ is not
likely, as is shown by the results of some experiments. These wero
made by placing dots within circles drawn on paper, the (eccentric)
positions of the dots corresponding to positions of a spot on Mars,
10, 15, and 20 minutes distant from his centre. These were shown
to-various persons, who all agreed in locating the dots on the proper
side of the centre.

The time was satisfactorily determined in 1779, but in 1777 not so
much so, as I was then not provided with an altitude instrument.

Allowing for this, the uncertainty of the deduced rotation period is
estimated at not above 28.34.

An ephemeris of the times of appearances of a dark spot on Mars has
been calculated for 1781 [and is given, p. 138].

Account of a Comet. [The planet Uranus.] By Mr. HERSCHEL, F. R.
S., communicated by Dr. WaTSON, jun., of Bath, F. R. 8S. Read
April 26, 1781.

“On Tuesday, March 13 [1781], between 10 and 11 in the evening,
while I was examining the small stars in the neighborhood of H
Geminorum, I perceived one that appeared visibly larger than the
rest. Being struck with its uncommon magnitude, I compared it to
H Geminorum and the smal! star in the quartile between Auriga
and Gemini, and finding it so much larger than either of them, sus-
pected it to be a comet.”

The magnifying power used “when I first saw the comet was 2: Clad!
By applying higher powers (460 and 932) the diameter of the comet
increased in proportion to the power, while the diameters of the
stars to which I compared it were not increased in the same ratio.

Measures of the comet’s diameter (March 17, April 18); the measures
vary from 3” 53!" to 5” 20/”.

‘By experience I have found that the aberration or indistincetness
oceasioned by magnifying much, provided the object be still left
sufficiently distinct, is rather to be put up with than the power to
be reduced when the angles to be measured are extremely small.”

Distance of the comet from certain telescopic stars. [See diagrams of
these stars and the comet in Plate XXIV, 1-6. ]

Position-angles,

Miscellaneous observations and remarks.

March 19: It moves according to the order of the signs, and its orbit
declines but very little from the ecliptic.

April 6: The comet appeared perfectly sharp at the edges and ex-
tremely well defined.

Remarks on the path of the comet.

The field of view was bright, the micrometer-thread black.

On the Parallax of the Fixed Stars, by Mr. HERSCHEL, F. R. S.; com-
municated by Sir Jos—EpH Banks, Bart., P. R.S. Read December
6, 1781.

The nearest of the fixed stars cannot be less than 40,000 diameters of
the whole annual orbit of the earth distant from us.

As we cannot enlarge this base, we can only endeavor to improve the
instruments by which we measure the parallax.

To measure small angles with accuracy two things are necessary: Ist,
that the instrument used for the purpose should be divided with
sufficient exactness; and 2d, that the telescope should have an ade-
quate power and distinctness.

The first condition is (now) practically fulfilled. The chief difficulty
is in the optical part. To see 1’ with precision requires a telescope
of very great perfection.

Even supposing the parallaxes of stars not to amount to single sec-
onds, or even thirds [¢y’"], the observations necessary to show this
would still have value.

The next step necessary to consider in this undertaking was the man-
ner of putting it into execution.

The method proposed by GALILE@, and attempted by Hook, FLAM-
STEED, MOLINEUX, and BRADLEY, of measuring zenith distances of
stars which pass close to the zenith, though it failed with regard
to parallax, has been productive of the most noble discoveries of
another nature.

BRADLEY (in Phil. Trans., No. 406, p. 637) concludes that the par-
allax of vy Draconis, or of 7 Urse Majoris, ‘‘is not so great as one
single second.”

y Draconis is a bright third magnitude, and the conclusion that sev-
eral authors have reached, that the parallaxes of stars in general do
not exceed 1’, does not appear to me to follow from the observations.

For aught we know to the contrary, the stars of the first magnitude
may still have a parallax of several seconds.

The method of zenith distances labors under the following considera-
ble difficulties: In the first place, the refractions; 2d, the change
of position of the earth’s axis, arising from nutation, precession,
and other causes, is not completely settled; 3d, the aberration,
though best known of all, may also be liable to some small errors.

I shall now deliver the method I have taken and show that it is free
from every error to which the former is lable, and is still eapable
of every improvement the telescope and mechanism of micrometers
can furnish.

Let O and E (fig. 1) be two opposite points of the earth’s orbit, in the
same plane with two stars, a and b, of unequal magnitude. Let the
angle aOb be observed when the earth is at O, and aEb when the
earthisatE. From the difference of these angles we may caleulate
the parallax of the stars. These two stars ought to beas near each
other as possible, and also differ as much in magnitude as we can
find them.

GALILEO was the first who suggested this method; but he does not
observe that the stars should be so near to each other as thereby to
preclude the influence of every cause of error.

This method has been also mentioned by other authors. Dr. LoNG
observed y Arietis, a Geminorum, 9 Orionis, and y Virginis, and ‘“‘ was
persuaded that they would be found always to remain the same.”

Every one of these stars are [ sic] totally improper for the purpose; for
the stars in y Arietis are near 10” distant, and, moreover, equal in
magnitude. In a Geminorum the stars are near enough, but do not
sufficiently differ in magnitude to shew any parallax. The stars
in the Nebula of Orion, on account of their extreme smallness of
distance, are still more improper than any; and those of y Virginis
are equal in magnitude,

The magnifying powers used by GALILEO and LONG were too small,
not above 60 or 70.

From a great number of observations which I have already made on
several double stars, especially ¢ Lodtis, it appears that we can affirin
the annual parallax to be exceedingly small indeed; and that there
is a great probability of succeeding still farther in this laborious
but delightful research, so as to be able at last to say, not only how
much the annual parallax is not but how much it really is.

Discussion of the effect of refraction on such measures.

Too much has hitherto been taken for granted in optics. Why the
method (of experiment) should not be more pursued in the art of
seeing does not appear.

We are told that we gain nothing by magnifying too much. I grant
it; but shall never believe I magnify too much till by experience
I find that I can see better with a lower power.

Telescopes will in general discover more small stars the more light
they collect, yet with a power of 227 I cannot see the small star
following o Aquile, when by the same telescope it appears very
plainly with the power of 460. Now in the latter case the light
is less than the fourth part of the: former.

Other similar cases noted and the names of the small stars given.

Great power may be favorable in cases where two stars are close
together. Figs. 2-5 show a Lyre with powers 460, 2,010, 3,163,
and 6,450 with my Newtonian reflector.

A new micrometer has been invented, which will be described in a
subsequent paper.

The powers that may be used upon various double stars are different
according to their relative magnitudes; ¢ Bodtis, for example,
will not bear the same power as a Geminoruw.

I have always found a single eye-glass had much the superiority
over a double eye-glass, both in light and distinctness. I would
except those cases where a large field is necessary.

If we would distinctly perceive and measure extremely small quan-
tities, such as a tenth of a second, it appears that when we use a
power of 460 this tenth of a second will be no more in appearance
than 46”, and even with a power of 1,500 will be but 2’ 30”, which
is a quantity not much more than suflicient to judge well of ob-
jects and to distinguish them from each other, such as a circle
from a square, triangle, or polygon.

[Foot-note.] By a set of experiments made in 1774 I found that I
could discover or perceive a bright object, such as white paper,
against the skylight when it subtended an angle of 35’, but could
only distinguish it to be a circle, and no other figure, when it ap-
peared under an angle of 2/ 24’,

We must look for distinctness in the perfection of the object specu-
lum of a telescope, and if we can make the first image in the
focus of a speculum almost as perfect as the real object, what
should hinder our magnifying but loss of light ?

The stars having light sufficient, I see no reason why we should
limit the powers of our instruments by any theory.

In this research it became necessary to look out for proper stars. I
took some pains to find out what double stars had been recorded by
astronomers, but my situation permitted me not to consult exten-
sive libraries. Nor indeed was it very material; for, as I intended
to view the heavens myself, Nature, that great volume appeared to
me to contain the best catalogue upon this occasion.

research began.

If I should mention any observations that are difficult to be verified
I beg the indulgence of observers. I hope it will be found that I
have sufficiently guarded against optical illusions, and that I have
all along had truth and reality in view as the sole object of my
endeavors. ;

In the observations of the distances of double stars, I have used two
ways. Those which are extremely near to each other may be esti-
mated by the eye in measures of their own apparent diameters.
Such estimations are accurate, as is shown by experiments with
circles drawn on paper near together.

I have divided double stars into several classes. Class I contains the
most difficult.

These being the most delicate objects it will not be amiss to go grad-
ually through a few preparatory steps of vision.

Examples of such preparatory steps given.

These double stars are a most excellent way of trying a telescope.

Class II of double stars contains all those that are proper for estima-
tions by the eye, or very delicate measures of the micrometer. See
fig. 6 of a Geminorum.

Estimations made with one telescope cannot be compared to those
made sith another.

Whatever may be the cause of the apparent diameters of the stars,
they are certainly not of equal magnitude with the same powers
in different telescopes, nor of proportional magnitude with differ-
ent powers of the same telescope.

Class III contains all double stays more than 5” and less than 15’
asunder.

Class IV contains double stars 15’’ to 30” asunder.

Class V contains double stars 30” to 60’ asunder.

Class VI contains double stars 60’ and over asunder.

These may serve another very important end. I will just mention it,
though it is foreign to my present purpose. Several stars of the
first magnitude have been observed or suspected to have a proper
motion of their own; hence we may surmise that our sun, with

all its planets and comets, may also have a motion toward some
particular point of the heavens. If this surmise should have any
foundation it will show itself in a series of some years in a kind
of systematical parallax or change due to the motion of the whole
solar system.

Theory of the annual parallax of double stars; General Postulata:

1. Let the stars be supposed, one with another, to be about the size
of the sun.

2. Let the difference of their apparent magnitudes be owing to their
different distances, so that a star of the 2d, 3d, 4th magnitude 18 2,
3, 4 times as far off as one of the first.

[Foot-note.] This is rather the order into which stars ought to be
divided than that into which they are. And perhaps we ought to
make an allowance for some loss which may happen to the light of
very remote stars in its passage through immense tracts of space
most probably not quite destitute of some very subtle medium.

I have usually found very small telescopic stars to be red, or inclined
to red.

Case of the parallax of stars in the ecliptic.

The following general expression for the parallax of two stars:

Let P express the total parallax of a fixed star of the first magnitude;
M the magnitude of the largest of the two stars; m the magnitude
of the smallest, and p the partial parallax to be observed by the
change in the distance of a double star; then will p = —

‘ = 4
and p being found by observation will give us P = a

in a moderate temperature half an hour will be sufficient.”

t Bootis: ‘IT suspect a motion in one of the stars, which another year
or two may show.”

vy Draconis: ‘‘ From the position in FLAMSTEED’s catalogue” we gather
that in his time their distance was * * * *. The difference in
the distance of the stars is so considerable that we can hardly ac-
count for it otherwise than by admitting a proper motion in one or
both of the stars or in our solar system ; most probably neither of
the three is at rest.”

a Lyrac: I have often measured the diameters of the fixed stars, and
found they measured less and less the more I magnified. With a
power of 6450 I looked at this star for at least a quarter of an hour,
x * * having experimentally found that the aberration by this
means will appear less and less. a@ Lyra was perfectly round; its
diameter was 0//.3553.

Sixth Class of Double Stars [66 stars].

o Ceti: “J can hardly doubt the motion of this star.”

Postscript to the Catalogue of Double Stars.

Since delivering the paper on the Parallax of the Fixed Stars [ Phil.
Trans., 1782], in which Irefer to the above Catalogue of Double Stars,
[have receiveda paper of Mr. MayeEr’s ‘‘Denoyisin Celosidereo phe-
nomenis” wherein IJ see that the idea of ascertaining the proper mo-
tion of the stars by means of small stars near large ones has induced
that gentleman before me to look out for suchsmall stars. My view
being that the annual parallax required stars much nearer than
those that would do for Mr. MAyrEr’s purpose, therefore I exam-
ined the heavens with much higher powers, and looked out chiefly
for those that were exceedingly close. The above catalogue con-
tains 269 double stars, 227 of which, to my present knowledge, have
not been noticed by any person. I hope they will prove no incon-
siderable addition to the general stock, especially as there are a
great many which are out of the reach of Mr. MAYErR’s and other
mural quadrants or transit instruments.

A power of 70 or 80 was not enough for the stazs of Class I nor even
those of Class II.

In settling the relative situation of very close double stars neither Mr.
MAYER’s instrument nor his method were adequate to the purpose.

Comparison of the measures of MAYER and HERSCHEL on @ Gemi-
norum :

“Mr. MAYER: Distance, 9/’.635 from center to center; position, 25°
14’ n. preceding; magnitude, extremely unequal. Mine: Distance,
5/’.156, diameter included; position, 32° 47’ n. preceding; magni-
tudes, a little unequal.” [See Fig. 6, Plate IV, for a cut of the ap-
pearance of this star with power of 460.]

J do not mean to depreciate Mr. MAYER’s method ; with stars of Classes
IV, V, VI, and some of Class III, better can hardly be wished for;
it is not sufficient for stars of Class II, much less for those of Class I.

J have used the expression ‘‘ double star” in a few instances of Class VI
in rather an extended signification. I preferred that expression to
any other such as comes, companion or satellite, because, in my
opinion, it is much too soon to form any theories of small stars re-
volving round large ones.

I shall not fail to take the first opportunity for looking out for those
of Mr. Mayenr’s double stars which I have not in my catalogue,
amounting to 31, and also for [another in Connaissance des Tems].

Description of a Lamp Micrometer, and the method of using it. By Mr.
WILLIAM HERSCHEL, F. R. S. Read January 31, 1782.

The imperfections of the parallel wire micrometer in taking the meas-
ures of close double stars are [described]: 1st, that the measures
must include the diamters of the stars ; 2d, the deflection of the light
on the wires [single threads of the silk-worm were used]; 3d, the
uncertainty of the zero; 4th, the imperfection of the screw; 5th,
the necessary illumination of the field.

The Lamp-Micrometer is free from all these defects. Description and
reference to Plate V.

The powers of HERSCHEL’Ss telescopes were [at this time] determined
by looking at a scale with one eye free and the other at the instru-
ment.

Description of the method of observing.

‘fA little practice in this business soon makes it easy, especially to one
who has already been used to look with both eyes open.”

Example of the measure of the position of @ Herculis.

(‘My telescope bears a power of 460 so well that for a twelvemonth
past I have hardly used any other.”)

“A power of 932 on fine evenings is very distinct,” and gives more
than half an inch to a second on the Lamp-Micrometer.

Other applications of this micrometer are to the measures of the di-
ameters of the planets and satellites, the mountains of the moon,
the diameters of the fixed stars, ete.

A paper to obviate some doubts concerning the great magnifying powers
used. By Mr. HERSCHEL, F. R. S.

[In the form of a letter to Sir JosePH BANKS, Prest. R. S.]

I have the honor of laying before you the result of a set of measures
I have taken to ascertain once more the powers of my Newtonian
7-feet reflector.

The method described. The solar focus of one of the eye-pieces was
measured five times and found to be 1.01, 1.04, 1.09, 1.01, 1.05 in
half-inch measure. The sidereal focus of my 7-feet speculum in the
same measure is 170.4. The mag. power of that lens is, then, 163.8.
This eye-lens was then compared with others by measures of the
diameter of a brass wire [details of the experiment given].

Powers as they have been called in my papers, 146, 227, 278, 460, 754,
932, 1159, 1536 [this lens lost 8 months ago], 2010, 3168, 6450.

Powers as they come out by this method, 163.86, 250.7, 301.8, 496.7,
775.1, 986.7, 1179.9, ——, 2175.8, 2585.5, 5786.8.

Description of the method formerly used to determine these powers: In
1776 a mark of white paper exactly half an inch in diameter was
viewed at the greatest convenient distance with the least magnifiers.
An assistant was placed at rectangles ina field at the same distance,
and upon a pole there erected I viewed the magnified image of the
half inch which was marked by my direction. The power thus ob-
tained was corrected to reduce it to what it would be upon infinitely
distant objects. The powers of the rest of the lenses I deduced
from this by a camera eye-piece. [See Plate VI, figs. 1 and 2.]

not mean to say I have used 6450 (or 5786) upon the planets, or even
upon double stars. The use of high powers is a new and untrodden
path, and in this attempt variety of new phenomena may be ex-
pected, therefore I wish not to be in a haste to make general con-
clusions. I shall not fail to pursue this subject, and hope soon to
be able to attack the celestial bodies with a still stronger armament
which is now preparing.

On the proper motion of the Sun and Solar System; with an account of
several changes that have happened among the fixed stars since the time
of Mr. FLAMSTEED. By WILLIAM HERSCHEL, Esq., F. R. S.

Read March 6, 1783.

Several of the fixed stars have a proper motion.

We may strongly suspect that there is not, in strictness of speaking,
one fixed star in the heavens, and reasons which I shall adduce
will render this so obvious that there can hardly remain a doubt of
the general motion of all the starry systems, and, consequently, of
the solar one among the rest.

Reasons drawn from the theory of attraction evidently oppose every
idea of absolute rest in any one of the stars, when once it is known
that some of them are in motion.

I will give a general account of the most striking changes which I
have found to have happened in the heavens since FLAMSTEED’S
time. I have now almost finished my third review.

The first review was made with a Newtonian telescope something less
than 7 feet focal length, a power of 222, and an aperture of 4}inches.
It extended only to stars of the first, second, third, and fourth mag-
nitudes.

Of my second review I have given some account in Phil. Trans., vols.
LXX, LXXI, LXXII. It was made with an instrument much supe-
rior to the other of 85.2 inches focus, 6.2 inches aperture, and
power 227. It extended to all the stars of HARRIs’s maps, and the
telescopic ones near them as far as the eighth magnitude. The
Catalogue of Double Stars and the discovery of the Georgium Sidus
were the results of that review.

My third review was with the same instrument and aperture, but
with a power of 460. This extended to all the stars of FLAm-
STEED’S catalogue, together with every small star about them, to
the amount of a great many thousands of stars.

It may be proper to mention that I have many a night, in the course
of 11 or 12 hours of observation, carefully and singly examined not
less than 400 celestial objects, besides taking measures, and some-
times viewing a particular star for half an hour together, with all
the various powers.

The particularities attended to in this [third] review were—

1. The existence of the star itself, such as it is given by FLAM-
STEED.

2. To observe well whether it was single or double, well defined
or hazy.

3. To view and mark down its particular color.

4. To examine all the small stars in the neighborhood as far, at
least, as the twelfth magnitude.

The results of these observations I shall collect under a few general
heads, as follows:

I. Stars that are lost or haye undergone some capital change
since FLAMSTEED’S time.
Il. Stars that have changed their magnitude since FLAMSTERD’S
time.
III. Stars newly come to be visible.

SYNOPSIS OF THE WRITINGS OF—Continued.

Here we ought to observe that it is not easy to prove a star to be
newly come.

“Does it not seem natural that these observations should cause a
strong suspicion that most probably every star in the heavens is
more or less in motion?” For though their proper motions could
not cause all these changes, yet we may well suppose that motion
is in some way concerned.

A slow motion, for instance, in an orbit round some opaque body
might account for some of these changes, while others might be
owing to the periodical return of large spots, which become visi-
ble by a rotation. The idea also of a body flattened by a quick
rotation and having a motion whereby more of the luminous surface
would be exposed at one time than another tends to the same end.

If the proper motion of the stars be admitted, who can deny that of
our sun? Admitting this for granted, the greatest difficulty will
be to discern the proper motion of the sun between so many other
motions of the stars. This is an arduous task indeed, but we are
not to be discouraged in the attempt. Let us at all events en-
deavor to lay a good foundation for those who are to come after us.
I shall therefore now point out the method of detecting the direc-
tion and quantity of the supposed proper motion of the sun, and
show that we have already some reasons to guess which way the
solar system is probably tending its course. [See Figs. 1 and 2.]

From the explanation of the figures it follows that—

1. The greatest or total systematical parallax of the fixed stars will
fall upon those that are in the line DE at rectangles to the direc-
tion AB of the sun’s motion.

2. The partial systematical parallax of every other star [defined in
amount }.

3. The parallax of stars at different distances will be inversely as
those distances.

4. Every star at rest, to a system in motion. will appear to move in a
direction contrary to that in which the system is moving.

Hence it follows that if the sun be carried toward any star in the
ecliptic, every star in [one half of the ecliptic] will decrease in
longitude, and every star in [the other half] will increase.

No method is so proper for this purpose as to divide our observations
into 3 zones, viz: the equator and the two colures, and double
stars are the most suitable for the purpose. Each of the 3 zones
{contains double stars, which are in the previous fist].

The equatorial zone, 20° wide, contains 150 stars. [List of them
given. |

The zone of the equinoctial where 20° wide contains 70 double stars.
[List given. ]

The zone of the solstitial where 20° wide contains 120 double stars.
[List given. ]

A zone 20° wide of the ecliptic of 120 double stars may be added.
[List given. ]

It remains now only for me to make an application of this theory to
some of the facts we already know.

And first let me observe that the rules of philosophizing direct us to
refer all phenomena to as few and simple principles as are sufficient
to explain them. [An example given. ]

Dr MASKELYNE’s proper motions of seven of the stars quoted, and
the positions of these stars plotted on Fig. 3.

The motion of the sun towards the constellation of Hercules from a
point not far from the 77th degree of right ascension to its oppo-
site 257th degree will account for the proper motions of these stars
by the single motion of the Solar System.

LALANDE gives the proper motion of 12 stars [table], and Fig. 4 rep-
resents them projected on the plane of the equator. These stars
with others [named] give us 27 motions to be accounted for. Our
supposition of the sun’s motion accounts for 22 of these, so there
are but 5 exceptions, which must be resolved into the real proper
motions of the stars.

The apparent exception of Castor considered [and the physical con-
nection of the two components is not assumed].

The apex of the solar motion defined.

As to the quantity of the solar motion I can only offer a few distant
hints. ;

The solar motion can certainly not be less than that which the earth
has in her annual orbit.

Future observations will soon throw more light on this interesting
subject, and either fully establish or overthrow the hypothesis.
To this end I have already begun a series of observation upon
several zones of double stars, and should the result of them be
against these conjectures I shall be the first to point out their
fallacy. [Dated at Datchet, near Windsor, Feb. 1, 1783.]

Postscript to the paper on the Motion of the Solar System.

Mr. AUBERT ‘has furnished me with Tos. MayeEr’s Opera Inedita,
which contains a catalogue of 80 stars observed by MAYER in 1756,
compared with ROEMER’s observations of 1706.

I have used these stars and left out of the list all those whose proper
motions MAYER considers doubtful and the fourteen stars already
examined, and which have been shown to support the hypothesis.
The rest are drawn up in two tables. The first contains the stars
that agree with my assigned motion of the solar system. The sec-
ond contains those stars whose motions cannot be accounted for on
my hypothesis, and must therefore be ascribed to a real motion in
the stars themselves or to some still more hidden cause of a still re-
moter parallax.

[This phrase is explained by a foot-note, as follows: ]

[Foot-note.] Mr. MICHELL’s admirable idea of the stars being col-
lected into systems appears to be extremely well founded; though
it does not, in my opinion, take away the probability of many stars
being still, as it were, solitary or intersystematical. Hence there may
be a proper motion of the whole system to which a star belongs.
Examples given of an inhabitant of Saturn’s fifth satellite; or a
small nebula may consist of many stars and have a proper motion
as a system.

[Foot-note.] We see, then, that while the sun is going toward a cer-
tain point of the heavens each of the stars belonging to the sidereal
system, of which the sun is one, will be affected as I have shown
[p. 261] notwithstanding the whole system should have a real mo-
tion in absolute space, and change its position with respect to other
systems or intersystematical stars.

governed is this: Let an are of 90° be applied to the sphere of the
fixed stars so as always to pass through the apex of solar motion.
Then while one end of it is drawn along the equator the other will
describe a closed curve. The law is that all stars in the northern
hemisphere situated within the nodated part will seem to go to the
north by the motion of the solar system; the rest will appear to go
southward. A similar law apples for the southern hemisphere.
See Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 and the explanation, p. 280.

A paragraph of MayEr’s [quoted] which seems to contain an objec-
tion against the solar motion is really a good argument in its favor,
as is Shown. MAYER’S paper was read in 1760, and mentions the
motion of the solar system as a very possible thing, and points out
some of the consequences of such a motion.

The foot-note gives a reference to two other papers of the same sort,
one by WILSON (1777), and one by LALANDE (1776).

WILLIAM HERSCHEL, Esq., F. R. 8S. Read March 11, 1784.

The polar spots of Mars may afford a good means of ‘‘ settling the in-
clination and nodes of that planet’s axis.” It was a question to be
settled by observation how far these spots were permanent and in
what latitude of Mars they were situated.

Observations from 1777, April 17, to 1783, Nov. 11. See Plate VI,
where there are 24 drawings.

1783, May 20. The polar spot, which is bright, seems to project above
the disk by its splendor.

[From observations up te 1783, Sept. 25.] I concluded that none of
the bright spots were exactly at the poles, though not far from them.

Inclination of the axis of Mars 61° 18’ to the orbit; the node being in
19° 28’ of Pisces.

The analogy between Mars and the earth pointed out.

The bright polar spots are probably owing to the vivid reflection of
light from frozen regions, and the reduction [in size] of these spots
is to be ascribed to their being exposed to the sun.

Of the spheroidical figure of Mars.

Observations relating to the polar flattening of Mars.

These all show a difference’ in the polar and equatorial diameters;
even when the mirrors of the telescopes are turned 90° in their
tubes, and various telescopes employed.

To avoid the corrections for phase, the measures taken on the day of
opposition will be adopted, these having been satisfactory.

The equatorial diameter of Mars is to the polar as 1355 to 1289.

Corrections to this ratio considered, and the former result changed to
1355 to 1272, or as 16 to 15 nearly.

This difference does not depend on distortions from the eye-pieces or
objectives employed.

The equatorial diameter of Mars at distance 1 is 9’ 8’”.

The atmosphere of Mars. Dr. SmrirH reports an observation of Cas-
SINUS where a star about to be occulted by Mars became extremely
faint 6’ frem the disk of the planet.

Observations by HERSCHEL of faint stars near Mars, which show them
not to be more affected than the nearness of its superior light would
warrant.

From other phenomena it appears, however, that this planet is not
without a considerable atmosphere; for besides the permanent spots
on its surface I have often noticed changes in both bright and dark
belts, and these alterations we can hardly ascribe to any other cause
than the variable disposition of clouds and vapors floating in the
atmosphere of that planet.

Result of the contents of this paper :

The axis of Mars is inclined to the ecliptic 59° 42’.

The node of the axis is in 17° 47/ of Pisces.

The point Aries on the Martial ecliptic answers to our 19° 28! of
Sagittarius.

The figure of Mars is that of an oblate spheroid whose equatorial di-
ameter is to the polar one as 1355 to 1272, or as 16 to 15 nearly.

The equatorial diameter of Mars reduced to the mean distance of the
earth from the sun is 9” 8”,

And that planet has a considerable but moderate atmosphere, so that
its inhabitants probably enjoy a situation in many respects similar
to ours.

A new Newtonian telescope has lately been completed, the object
speculum being 20 feet in focal length and its aperture 18 inches.

It is mounted in the meridian and gives positions only in a coarse way.

It would perhaps have been more eligible to have waited longer in
order to complete the discoveries that seem to lie within the reach

of this instrument, and are already, in some respects, pointed out
to me by it.

By taking more time I should undoubtedly be enabled to speak more
confidently of the interior construction of the heavens and its vari-
ous nebulous and sidereal strata, of which this paper can give only a
few hints.

As an apology for this prematurity it may be said that the end of all
discoveries being communication, we can never be too ready in giv-
ing facts and observations, whatever we may be, in reasoning upon
them.

Hitherto the sidereal heavens have been represented by the concave
surface of asphere. In future we shall look upon those regions
into which we may now penetrate as a naturalist regards a rich ex-
tent of ground containing strata variously inclined and directed as
well as consisting of very different materials.

Although my single endeavors should not succeed in a work which
seems to require the joint effort of every astronomer, yet so much
we may venture to hope that by applying ourselves with all our
powers to the improvement of telescopes, which I look upon as yet
in their infant state, and turning them with assiduity to the study
of the heavens, we shall in time obtain some faint knowledge of,
and perhaps be able partly to delineate, the interior construction
of the universe.

Catalogue of Double Stars. By WILLIAM HERSCHEL, Esq., F. R. S.
Read December 9, 1784.

Introductory remarks. The great use of double stars having already
been pointed out in a former paper on the Parallax of the Fixed
Stars, and in a latter one on the Motion of the Solar System, I have
now drawn up a second collection of 434 more, which I have found
out since the first was delivered.

The method of classing them is in every respect the same as that
which is used in the first collection.

Method of identifying and describing the positions of the stars.

I would recommend a precaution to those who wish to examine the
closest of my double stars. It relates tothe adjustment of the focus.
Supposing the telescope and the observer long enough out in the
open air to have acquired a certain temperature, and the night suf-
ficiently clear, let the focus be readjusted with the utmost delicacy
upon a star known to be single, of nearly the same altitude, magni-
tude, and color as the star to be examined.

Let the phenomena of the adjusting star be well attended to, as to
whether it be perfectly rounded and well defined, or affected with
little appendages, etc. Such deceptions may be detected by turn-
ing or unscrewing the object glass a little in its cell, when those
appendages will be observed to revolve the same way. *

Being thus acquainted with the imperfections as well as the perfec-
tions of the instrument, and going immediately from the adjusting
star, we may hope to be successful.

All the observations here given were made with a power of 460 unless
they are marked otherwise.

The measures were all taken with a parallel silk-worm’s-thread mi-
erometer and a power of 227 only, from the center of one star to the
center of the other.

The threads subtend an angle of 1’ 13’” only.

The positions have all been measured with a power of 460 on a mi-
crometer made for me according to the model given in the Phil.

CATALOGUE OF DOUBLE STARS, First Chass. [Nos. 25 to 97.]

[ Foot-note. ] Could we increase our power and distinctness at pleasure
we might undoubtedly separate any two stars that are not abso-
lutely in adirect line. * * * This will appear when we con-
sider that perhaps £3 of the diameter of a star are spurious. It
would have been curious if a considerable difference in the colors
could have led us to discover which of the two stars is before the
other! But by far the greatest part of their diameters being spu-
rious, it is probable that a different-colored light of two stars would
join together where the rays of one extend into those of the other;
and so, producing a third color by the mixture, still leave the ques-
tion undecided.

[Foot-note.] The interval between very unequal stars estimated in
diameters generally gains more by an increase of magnifying power
than the apparent distance of those which are nearer of a size.
However, this only seems to take place when there is a difficulty of
seeing the object well with a low power.

SECOND CLAss OF DOUBLE Stars. [Nos. 39 to 102. ]

[ Foot-note. |] When the small star is so faint as not to bear the least
illumination of the wires, its position may still be measured by the
assistance of some wall or other object; for an eye which has been
some time in the dark can see a wall in a starlight night sufficiently
well to note the projection of the stars upon it inthe manner which
has been described with the lamp micrometer. Then introducing
some light, and adapting the fixed wire to the observed direction

of the stars on the wall, the moveable wire may be set to the par-

THIRD CLASS OF DOUBLE Stars. [sNos. 47 to 114.]

[Foot-note.] With regard to small stars that become visible by an in-
crease of magnifying power, we may surmise that it is partly owing
to the greater darkness of the field of view arising from the increased
power, and partly to the real effect of the power.

[Foot-note.] The prismatic power of the atmosphere, of which little
notice has been taken by astronomers, is that part of its refractive
quality whereby it disperses the rays of light and gives a lengthened
and colored image of a lucid point. It is very visible in low stars;
Fomalhaut, for instance, affords a beautiful prismatic spectrum [ex-
periments given], which explain also why a star is not always best
in the center of the field of view; a fact I have often noticed before
I knew the cause. ;

On the Construction of the Heavens. By WILLIAM HERSCHEL, Esq., F.
R. 8S. Read Feb. 3, 1785.

In an investigation of this delicate nature we ought to avoid two op-
posite extremes. If we indulge a fanciful imagination and build
worlds of our own, we must not wonder at our going wide from the
path of truth and nature. On the other hand, if we add observa-
tion to observation, without attempting to draw not only certain
conclusions but also conjectural views from them, we offend against
the very end for which only observations ought to be made. I will
endeavor to keep a proper medium, butif Ishould deviate from that,
I could wish not to fall into the latter error.

Theoretical view of the formation of nebule.

Form I. Condensation of neighboring stars about a central and larger
star; globular forms.

Form II. Condensation of neighboring stars about a nucleus of con-
tiguous stars; condensed irregular forms.

Form III. Condensation about a stream of stars, producing a form
coarsely similar to the prototype: extended, branching, compound
forms.

Form IV, Compound forms derived from the mutual attraction of
clusters.

V. Vacancies will then arise in the surrounding space.

Objection to the above views; they tend to show a gradual destruc-
tion of the universe. Response, that space is infinite and that the
occasional destruction of one star may operate to give life to the
rest.

not but add greatly to the reception of this opinion when the

in the same way the view of so many sidereal systems will add
credit to what I have said in regard to the construction of the
heavens. For to the inhabitants of the nebule of the present cata-
logue our sidereal system must appear either as a small nebulous
patch; an extended streak of milky light; a large resolvable neb-
ula; a very compressed cluster of minute stars, hardly discernible ;
or as an immense collection of large scattered stars of various sizes,

1786 76 500 Investigation of the cause of that indistinctness of vision which has been
ascribed to the smallness of the optic pencil. By WILLIAM HERSCHEL,
LL.D., F. R. 8. Read June 22, 1786.

500 Soon after my first essay of u8ing high powers with the Newtonian
telescope, I began to doubt whether an opinion which has been en-
tertained by several eminent authors ‘‘that vision will grow indis-
tinct when the optic pencils are less than the fortieth or fiftieth
part of an inch” would hold good in all cases.

I perceived that, according to this criterion, I was not entitled to see
distinctly with a power much more than about 320 in a 7-foot tele-
scope of an aperture of 6.4 inches; whereas in many experiments
I found myself very well pleased with magnifiers which far ex-
ceeded such narrow limits.

This induced me, as it were, by way of apology to myself for seeing
well where I ought to have seen less distinctly, to make a few ex-
periments.

501 The first experiments I made were in 1778, and the result of them
proved so decisive that I have never since resumed the subject,
and had it not been for a late conversation with some of my highly
esteemed and learned friends, I might probably have left the
papers on which these experiments were recorded among the rest
of those that are laid aside when they have afforded me the infor-
mation I want.

502 Microscopic experiments.

Exp. 3. With a pencil of z}z of an inch I saw very distinctly.

Exp. 8. With a pencil of =};5 of an inch I saw very distinctly.

504 Exp. 10. It occurred to me that a certain proportion of aperture
might be necessary to a given focal length of an object-glass or
specuium.

505 Exp. 10, 11, 12, 13, show that to see well in microscopes like the one
used, the aperture of the object glass must bear a considerable
proportion to its focal length.

505 Exp. 15 shows that 3th part of the focal length is not a sufficient
aperture.

507 As soon as convenient I intend to pursue this subject; at present my
engagement with the work of a 40-feet reflector will hardly permit
so much leisure, and till I have repeated, extended, and varied
these experiments, I would wish them to be looked upon as mere
hints.

An account of the discovery of two satellites revolving round the Georgian
Planet. By WILLIAM HERSCHEL, LL. D., F.R.S. Read Feb. 15, 1787.

I had frequently directed large telescopes to this remote planet to see
if it were attended by satellites, but failed for the want of sufficient
light in the instruments I used.

In the beginning of [January, 1787] I found that my telescope used as
a front view gave much more light. On the 11th of January I selected
a sweep which included the Georgian Planet, and noted down the
places of the small stars near it. The next day two of these were
missing. To satisfy myself I noted down all the small stars on the
14th, 17th, 18th, and 24th of January, and the 4th and 5th of Feb-
ruary, and though I had no longer any doubt of the existence of at
least one satellite, I thought it right to defer this communication
till I could see it actually in motion. Accordingly I began to pur-
sue this satellite on February the 7th, at about 6 o’clock in the eve-
ning, and kept it in view till three in the morning on Feb. the 8th,
and during those nine hours I saw this satellite faithfully attend its
primary planet and describe a considerable arc of its proper orbit.

While I was attending to the motion of this satellite I did not forget
to follow another small star which I was pretty well assured was
also a satellite.

The first-discovered satellite [Oberon] is the farthest from the planet
and I shall call it the second satellite; the last-discovered [ Titania] I
shall call the first satellite.

I made a sketch on paper to point out beforehand the situation of
these satellites on Feb. 10, and [on that night] the heavens dis-
played the original of my drawing by shewing, in the situation I
had delineated them, the Georgian Planet attended by two satellites.
I confess that this scene appeared to me with additional beauty as
the little secondary planets seemed to give a dignity to the primary
one which raises it into a more conspicuous situation among the
great bodies of our solar system.

I suppose the first performs a synodical revolution in about 6} days,
the second in nearly 134 days. Their orbits make a considerable
angle with the ecliptic.

Attempts to measure them with my micrometers have so far failed.
I have nevertheless several resources in view and do not despair of

succeeding pretty well in the end.

An account of Three Volcanoes in the Moon. By WILLIAM HERSCHEL,
LL. D., F. R. §.; communicated by Sir Josepu Banks, Bart., P. R.
S. Read April 26, 1787.

The phenomena of nature are to be viewed not only with the usual
attention to facts as they occur, but with the eye of reason and ex-
perience. In this we are not allowed to depart from plain appear-
ances. Thus when we see on the surface of the moon a great num-
ber of elevations from half a mile to a mile and a half in height we
are strictly entitled to call them mountains; but when we attend
to their particular shape, in which many of them resemble the
craters of our volcanoes, and thence argue that they owe their
origin to the same cause which has modeled many of these, we may
be said to see by analogy, or with the eye of reason.

burning charcoal when it is covered with a very thin coat of white

be faintly illuminated by the eruption and were gradually more

eruption resembled much that which I saw on the 4th of May, 1783,*

Systems of stars—globular clusters and definition of a cluster.

Admitting that a cluster is real, not apparent, the stars composing it
are about of equal magnitude.

At the same distance from the centre an equal scattering takes place.

These clusters are of a globular form.

They are more condensed at the centre than at the surface.

Form I of nebulx [ Phil. Trans., 1785, p. 214], is thus shown to exist
in the heavens.

Such clusters are subject to central powers.

The idea of other central forces [than that of gravity] in the construe-
tion of the sidereal heavens, was given in certain mathematical
papers delivered to the Philosophical Society of Bath [and is yet
entertained ].

Not only were round nebula and clusters formed by central powers,
but likewise every cluster of stars or nebula that shows a gradual
condensation, or increasing brightness towards a centre.

This theory of central power is fully established on grounds [of
observation] which cannot be overturned.

Clusters can be found of 10’ diameter with a certain degree of com-
pression and stars of a certain magnitude, and smaller clusters of
4’ 3‘ 2’ in diameter, with smaller stars and greater compression, and
so on through resolvable nebule by imperceptible steps, to the
smallest and faintest [and most distant] nebulae.

Other clusters there are, which lead to the belief that either they are
more compressed or are composed of larger stars. Spherical clus-
ters are probably not more different in size among themselves than
different individuals of plants of the same species. As it has been
shown that the spherical figure of a cluster of stars is owing to
central powers, it follows that those clusters which, ceteris paribus,
are the most complete in this figure, must have been the longest
exposed to the action of these causes.

The maturity of a sidereal system may thus be judged from the dis-
position of the component parts. Planetary nebulz may be looked
on as very aged.

This method of viewing the heavens seems to throw them into a new
kind of light. They are now seen to resemble a luxuriant garden
which contains the greatest variety of productions in different
flourishing beds; and one advantage we may at least reap from if
is that we can, as it were, extend the range of our experience to an
immense duration. For, is it not almost the same thing whether
we live successively to witness the germination, blooming, foliage,
fecundity, fading, withering, and corruption of a plant, or whether
a vast number of specimens, selected from every stage through
which the plant passes in the course of its existence, be brought at

once to our view?

Notes.

P. 8.—The planet Saturn has a sixth satellite revolving round it in
about 32 hours 48 minutes. Its orbit lies exactly in the plane of
the ring. An account of its discovery with the 40-foot reflector,
etc., will be presented to the Royal Society at their next meeting,

WILLIAM HERSCHEL.

Account of the discovery of a sixth and seventh satellite of the planet
Saturn; with remarks on the construction of its ring, its atmosphere, its
rotation on an axis, and its spheroidical figure. By WILLIAM HER-
SCHEL, LL. D., F. R.S. Read November 12, 1789.

In a postscript to my last paper I announced to the Royal Society the
discovery of a satellite of Saturn. I have now the honor to present
them, with an account of two satellites instead of one, and I have
called them the sixth and seventh, although their situation very
probably entitles them to be called the first and second.

These have not been before discovered on account of the difficulty of
seeing them with a less telescope than the 40-foot.

I began to observe Saturn in 1774, and on March 17 I saw it with a
54-foot reflector, as in Plate I, fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows it on April 3,
1774, without its ring. In 1775 I saw the ring gradually open
(using a 7-foot reflector). Fig. 3, Plate II, shows the appearance
1783 [should be 1778], June 20 (with a very good 10-foot reflector).

The black belt on the ring of Saturn is not in the middle of its
breadth, nor is the ring subdivided by many such lines, but there
is one single, considerably broad belt upon the ring which is per-
manently in its place.

My observations show that this belt (at least on the north half of the
ring, where I have alone observed it) is not like the belts of Jupiter
or those of Saturn, subject to variations of color or figure, but is
most probably owing to some permanent construction of the surface
of the ring itself.

It is not the shadow of a chain of mountains, since it is visible all
round the ring. The same argument will hold good against sup-
posed caverns or concayities. It is pretty evident that it is con-
tained between two concentric circles. See fig. 4, Plate II, drawing
of 1780, May 11.

As to the surmise of two rings, it does not appear eligible to venture
on so artificial a construction, by way of explaining a phenomenon,
which does not absolutely demand it.

As yet we do not know of any rotation of the ring which may be of
such a proper velocity as [might lend some support to the idea of
two detached rings].

If the southern side of the ring should be differently marked, it would
negative the idea of two rings. Even if it should be marked the
same in every respect, it would be best to wait for the occultation
of some considerable star by Saturn, when, if the ring be divided,
it will be seen between the openings of the ring, as well as between
the ring and Saturn.

We may certainly affirm that the ring is no less solid than the planet
itself. The reasons which prove the solidity of one serve to prove
that of the other.

1790 ~=80 5 The mass of the planet, as determined from the satellites, includes
that of the ring; and the ring produces irregularities in the mo-
tions of the satellites, as does also’the oblateness of the ball of the

planet.
5 The light of the ring is brighter than that of the planet. [Proof
given. ]

6 The ring is extremely thin for—

1789, July 18, [ Tethys] was thicker than the ring;

—, July 23, [ Dione] was twice as thick as the ring;

—, July 27, [ Enceladus] was thicker than the ring;

, August 29, [Mimas] was thicker than the ring ;

1789, Oct. 15: the ring was barely visible in the 40-foot reflector,
but [Enceladus] was visible about the middle of the preceding
arm.

1789, Oct. 16: I followed [Mimas and Enceladus] up to the very
disc of the planet.

7 Asuspicion arises that by a refraction through some very rare atmos-
phere on the ring the satellites might be lifted up and depressed so
as to be visible on both sides of the ring.

8 The edge of the ring is very probably not square, but spherical or
spheroidical.

8 The ring cannot possibly disappear on account of its thinness.
8 I formerly supposed the surface of the ring to he rough, owing to

9 luminous points like mountains seen on the ring, till one of these
supposed luminous points was kind enough to venture off the edge
of the ring and appear as a satellite. As I had noted all such in-
equalities I could calculate all such surmises, and I have always
found these appearances to be due to satellites.

9 Upon the whole, I cannot say that Thad any one instance that could
induce me to believe the ring was not of a uniform thickness; that
is, equally thick at equal distances from the centre and of an equal
diameter throughout.

10 Strong suspicions of the existence of a sixth satellite I have long en-
tertained. I saw it 17387, August 19. I was then busy with the
Georgian satellites.

10. In 1788 my 20-foot speculum was much tarnished,

10 The very first moment I turned my 40-foot telescope on Saturn, 1789,
August 28, I saw six satellites, and on September 17 I detected the
seventh satellite.

11 From many observations of the sixth satellite [ 2nceladus] I find its
sidereal revolution 14 8 53™ 95, and by computation its distance
35’’.058. Its light is considerably strong, but not equal to that of
[ Tethys].

12 The seventh satellite [ Mimas] makes one sidereal revolution in 22°
40™ 468; its distance (computed) is 27/'.366.

12 It is incomparably smaller than [ 2nceladus], and even in the 40-foot
reflector appears no bigger than a very small lucid point; to which
the exquisite figure of the speculum not a little contributes.

13. The orbits of these two satellites are exactly in the plane of the ring.
13 Observations of the belts and figure of Saturn from April 9, 1775, to
Sept. 8, 1780, and reference to [rough] figures are here given.

15 We may draw two conclusions from these: First, Saturn has probably
a very considerable atmosphere. The changes in the belts show

this, and also the hanging of the satellites on the limb; the time
of hanging on the limb for Mimas has actually amounted to 20
minutes. This would denote a refraction of about 2” [provided,
etc. ].

The second conclusion is that Saturn turns on an axis perpendicular
to the ring. The proof depends on the position of the belts which
for 14 years have been [nearly ] always equatorial.

Another reason is that Saturn, like Jupiter, Mars, and the earth, is
flattened at the poles, and therefore ought to be supposed to turn
on its axis. [Observations 1776, July 22, to 1789, Sept. 3 given. ]

On the Satellites of the planet Saturn and the rotation of its Ring on an
Agis. By WILLIAM HERSCHEL, LL. D., F. R.S. Read June7, 1790.

The observations to be given extend from July 18 to Dec. 25, 1789.
On calculating the appearances of bright luminous points on the
ring, I found that all of them could not be accounted for by satel-
lites.

The question, then, is, what to make of these protuberant points?
To admit two or three more satellites appears too hazardous. And
yet a suspicion of at least one morc satellite would often return.
The observations of each satellite have been separated, and at least

one observation of each has been calculated for each night.

of this figure and of the tables. :

The motions of these 7 satellites are so well known that no shape of
lucid spot, protuberant point, or latent satellite can be occasioned
by any one of them without our knowing it. I found that the ob-
servations to be given presently could not be explained by any of
the known satellites.

The first idea was of another satellite interior to the 7th; and if a
revolution slower than about 15+ hours could have been found to
account for most of the places where the bright spots were seen,
I should have believed these to be caused by an 8th satellite. This
being impracticable, I examined what would be the result if these
bright points were attached to the plane of the ring.

ANTON VE I,

1790 80 479 As observations, carefully made, should always take the lead of theo-
ries, I shall not be concerned if what I have to say contradicts what
has been said in my last paper.

479 A lucid and apparently protuberant point may exist without any
great inequality in the ring. <A vivid light, for instance, will seem
to project greatly beyond the limits of the body upon which it is
placed.

479 The brightest and best-observed spot agrees to a revolution of 105 32™
158.4 at a distance of 17.227, i. e., on the ring. Therefore, unless
the ring is fluid, or has a groove in it, so as to let the satellite re-
volve in it, we ought to admit a revolution of the ring itself.

480 Itseems almost proved that the consistence of the ring is not less than
the body of Saturn; consequently no sufficient degree of fluidity
can be admitted.

1791 8L 71 On Nebulous Stars, properly so called. By WILLIAM HERSCHEL, LL. D.,
F. Rk. S. Read February 10, 1791.

71 In one of my late examinations of the heavens I discovered a star of
about the 8th magnitude, surrounded with a faintly luminous atmosphere
of a considerable extent.

71 The name nebulous stars was incorrectly used in former times.

71 The milky way itself consists entirely of stars.

72 Nebule can be selected so that an insensible gradation shall take place
from a coarse cluster like the Pleiades down to a milky nebulosity
like that in Orion, every intermediate step being represented. This
tends to confirm the hypothesis that all are composed of stars more
or less remote.

73 A comparison of the two extremes of the series, as a coarse cluster and
a nebulous star, indicates, however, that the nebulosity about the star
is not of a starry nature.

74 Summary of the reason which formerly led to the belief that all
nebulze were clusters more or less remote.

Basis for the ideas of connection and disjunction of stars and nebule.
75-77 Particular examples of such supposed conjunctions and disassocia-
tions. Telescopic milky way of over 60 square degrees.
The trapezium of Orion is unconnected with the nebula.
78-82 Notes of observations on nebulous stars and consideration of the re-
lation of the nucleus to the envelope in each case.

83 Considering H, iv 69, [=G. C. 810,] as a typical nebulous star, and
supposing the nucleus and chevelure to be connected, we may, Ist,
suppose the whole to be of stars, in which case either the nucleus is
enormously larger than other stars of its stellar magnitude or the
envelope is composed of stars indefinitely small; or, 2d, we must ad-
mit that the star is involved in a shining fluid of a nature totally
unknown to us.

84 Perhaps it has been too hastily surmised that all milky nebulosity is
owing to starlight only.

The telescopic milky way is probably composed of this shining fluid,
which must commence somewhere about the range of the stars of
the 7th magnitude, and extend to the regions of the 9th, 10th, 11th,
and 12th.

The shining fluid might exist independently of stars. The light of
this fluid is no kind of reflection from the star in the center. If this
matter is self-luminous, it seems more fit to produce a star by its
condensation than to depend on the star for its existence.

List of diffused nebulosities and planetary nebulie; both better ac-
counted for by the hypothesis of a shining fluid than by supposing
them to be distant stars.

Regeneration of stars from planetary nebule.

How far the light-corpuscles emitted from millions of suns may be
concerned in this shining fluid it is not necessary to inquire. We
need not know the origin of the luminous matter whose existence
is rendered evident by means of nebulous stars.

On the Ring of Saturn and the rotation of the fifth satellite upon its axis.
By WILLIAM HERSCHEL, LL. D., F. R.S. Read December 15, 1791.
In a former paper (Phil. Trans., vol. xxx, p. 4) I spoke of the sur-
mise of a division in Saturn’s ring with proper doubts. My late
views of the southern side of the ring and the discovery of its quick
rotation enable me to speak decisively.

The black division is always of the same breadth if we leave out of
account certain very small variations which I have occasionally
observed.

Observations on the Ring of Saturn (from 1790, Sept. 7, to Oct. 24).

From these and former observations I think myself authorized now
to say that the planet Saturn has two concentric rings. * * *

The relative dimensions of the rings and spaces are given in a table.

This opening in the ring (which is some 2,513 miles in width) must
be of considerable service to the planet, in reducing the space that
is eclipsed by the shadow of the ring.

It becomes a question if both rings revolve in the same time. The
period formerly given (Phil. Trans., 1xxx, p. 481), belongs to the
outer ring. The former observations indicate that the inner ring
revolves with great velocity on its axis, but are not sufficient to
determine the period.

It is quite probable that there should be a small difference in the
periods of the two rings.

A memoir (in Histoire de V Académie Royale des Sciences de Paris, 1787,
p. 249—) refers to observations of many divisions of the ring of
Saturn.

My own observations of Saturn since 1774 contain only four where
any other black division upon the ring is mentioned than the one
I have constantly observed. These 4 observations were in 1780—
(see Plate I, figs 1, 2, 3.)

Saturn was then in the very best situation for viewing the plane of
the ring, but I have hitherto set these observations aside as
wanting more confirmation.

Observations have been made by M. CassINI, Mr. SHort, and Mr.
HADLEY [and are referred to].

It does not appear to me that there is a sufficient ground for admit-
ting the ring of Saturn to be of a very changeable nature.

tance of Saturn from the earth; 46’.832 ; 47'",241; 45/’.803;

On the rotation of the fifth satellite of Saturn, on its axis.

The fifth satellite [Japetus] is subject to a change of brightness ; this
having been noticed by other observers I did not at first pay so
much attention to it as it deserved. I afterwards followed this satel-
lite with great attention and marked all its changes of apparent
brightness.

The result of many observations is as follows: The light of tbe satel-
lite is in full splendor during the time it runs through that part of
its orbit, which is between 68 and 129 degrees past the inferior con-
junction. In this are it does not fall above one magnitude short of
the brightness of [ Titan].

From about 7° past the opposition till towards the inferior conjune-
tion it is not only less bright than [ Rhea] but hardly, if at all, ex-
ceeds [Dione]; or even [Tethys] at elongation. Such a change
among the fixed stars and to the naked eye would be from the 2d
to the 5th magnitude,

It is now evident that the time of its rotation on its axis cannot differ
much from the time of its revolution about Saturn ; notwithstand-
ing that the light of the satellite has suffered an occasional change
of short duration from other causes.

But I may go further and ascertain upon sufficient grounds, that this
satellite turns once upon its axis exactly in the time it performs
one revolution. This degree of accuracy is obtained by taking in
the observations of M. Casstnt in Mémoires de V Acad. Roy. des Sci-
ences, 1705, p. 121; (see, also, 1707, p. 96), and those of M. BERNARD,
op. cit., 1786, p. 378.

Joining all these I conclude that the 5th satellite of Saturn turns upon
its axis once in79 days 7 hours and 47 minutes.

I cannot help reflecting with some pleasure on the discovery of an
analogy which shows that a certain uniform plan is carried on
among the secondaries of our solar system; and we may conjecture
that probably most of the satellites are governed by the same law,
especially if it be founded on such a construction of their figure as
makes them more ponderous toward their primary planets.

From the changes in [Japetus] we may conclude that some part of its
surface, and this by far the largest, reflects much less light than
the rest; and that neither the darkest nor the brightest side of the
satellite is turned toward the planet, but partly one and partly the
other, though probably less of the bright side.

The great regularity of this change of brightness seems to point out
another resemblance of this satellite with our moon. We see the
spots on the moon of pretty nearly the same brightness, so as not
to be overcast in a very strong degree by dense clouds to disfigure
them, and therefere have great reason to surmise that her atmos-
phere is extremely rare; in like manner we may suppose the atmos-
phere of Japetus as rare as that of our moon.

On the distance of the fifth satellite.

Many measures have been made for the purpose of getting the mass.
They begin 1791, Sept. 25, and end Oct. 1.

Miscellaneous observations. By WILLIAM HERSCHEL, LL. D., F. R. S.
Read December 22, 1791.

Account of a Comet. [1792, I.] This was discovered by CAROLINA
HERSCHEL, 1791, Dec. 15. Examined Dec. 16 with a 20-foot re-
flector; brief description and position for Dec. 16.

On the periodical appearance of o Ceti.

331 days 105 19™ is its period.

On the disappearance of the 55th Herculis.

1781, Oct. 10, I examined both 54 and 55 Herculis; again 1782, April
11; 1790, May 24, 55 Herculis was missing#and although looked for
has not again been seen.

Remarkable Phenomena in an eclipse of the Moon.

1790, Oct. 22, when the moon was totally eclipsed I viewed the dise
with a 20-feet reflector with power 360. In several parts of it I
perceived many bright, red, luminous points. Most of them w: re
small and round, at least 150 of them. Their light did not much
exceed that of Mons Porphyrites Hevelii.

We know too little of the surface of the moon to venture at a surmise
of the cause from whence the great brightness, similarity, and re-
markable color of these points could arise. (Dated) Slough, De-
cember 17, 1791.

Observations on the Planet Venus. By WiLLiAM HERSCHEL, LL. D.,
F. R.S. Read June 13, 1793.

A series of observations on Venus begun in April, 1777, has been con-
tinued down to the present time. The first object of the research
was to determine the diurnal rotation, for the observations of Cas-
SINI and BIANCHINI can leave no doubt but that it has a rotation
on its axis; the second was the atmosphere of Venus, of the exist-
ence of which, after a few months’ observations, I could not enter-
tain the least doubt; and third, the investigation of the real diam-
eter. To which may be added an attention to the construction of
the plauet with regard to permanent appearances, such as might be
ascribed to seas, continents, or mountains.

The result of my observations would have been communicated long
ago if I had not flattered myself with the hope of some better suc-
cess concerning the diurnal motion of Venus, which has still eluded
my constant attention as far as concerns its period and direction.

Even at this present time I should hesitate to give the following ex-
tracts if it did not seem incumbent upon me to examine by what
accident I came to overlook mountains in this planet ‘‘of such enor-
mous height as to exceed four, five, or even six times the perpendicular
elevation of Chimborago, the highest of our mountains.” [Quoted from
ScHROETER, Phil. Trans. 1792, p. 337. ]

The same paper contains other particu'ars concerning Venus and
Saturn. All of which being things of which I have never taken
any notice, it will not be amiss to show by what follows that neither
want of attention nor a deficiency of instruments could occasion my
not perceiving these mountains of more than 23 miles in height; this
jagged border of Venus; and these flat spherical forms on Saturn.

Before I remark on the rest of the extraordinary relations above men-
tioned I will give a short extract of my observations of Venus.

June 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, and July 3, showed that Venus
has a motion on her axis, and as evidently that she has an atmosphere.

206 1739, Nov. 30: no satellite visible; if she has one it must be below 8
or 9 magnitude.

206 Two measures of the diameter, 1791, Nov. 24.

215 My observations show that the atmosphere of Venus is of much greater
extent orrefractive power than as given in the paper [of SCHROETER. }

216‘ As to the mountains in Venus, | may venture to say that no eye which
is not considerably better than mine, or assisted by much better in-
struments, will ever get a sight of them.

217 The diameter of Venus at the mean distance of the earth is 18’.79.

218 The appearance of the luminous border of Venus as I have described
it, i. e., suddenly much brighter all around the limb, has not been noticed
by the author we have referred to.

218 The cause of this appearance may probably be ascribed to the atmos-
phere of Venus, which is probably replete with matter that reflects
and refracts light copiously. Therefore on the border, where we
have an oblique view, there will be an increase of this appearance.

1794 84 28 Observations of a quintuple belt on the Planet Saturn. By WILLIAM
HERSCHEL, LL. D., F. R. S. Read December 19, 1793.

28 In some of my former papers I have established the spheroidical form
of Saturn and pointed out the motion of a spot on its disc. From
the first we infer a rotation on its axis; the second shows that it
has such a motion.

My late observations seem to hint to us that the period of rotation is
not of long duration.

28 Observations of the quintuple belt; see Plate VI, fig. 1.

30 Observations of belts on Jupiter; see Plate VI, fig. 2, fig. 3.

31 Belts are connected with the rotation of the planets. Since then it
appears that the belts of Saturn are very numerous, like those of
Jupiter, and are also placed in the direction of the longest diameter
of the planet, it may not be without some reason that we infer the
period of the rotation of the former to be short like that of the
latter.

31 Ihave never seen parallel belts on Mars nor on Venus.

myself of its reality. If there was a bending, it did probably not
amount to 1”.

mountains of the moon by three different methods. Some of these

remain unealculated in my journal till some proper opportunity.

i794 84 = 48 On the rotation of the planet Saturn upon its axis. By WILLIAM HER-

SCHEL, LL. D., F. R. 8. Read January 23, 1794.

48 Ina late paper I pointed out an analogy which might lead us to sur-
mise that Saturn had a quick rotation on its axis. I can at present
announce the reality of that rotation by means of observations of
154 revolutions of the planet.

48 The belts of Saturn that I have been observing seem to have under-
gone no material change for the last two months.

43 I give the observations upon which my computations have been
founded, entire.

49-59 Observations on the belts of Saturn.

50 [Foot-note.] In the course of these observations I made 10 new ob-
ject specula and 14 small plain ones for my 7-foot reflector, having
found that a 7-foot reflector was adequate to my purpose.

51 [Foot-note.] These objectives were from 84 to 88 inches focus, and
were used with an eye-glass of 3’ of an inch focus, the power thus
being from 280 to 293.

52. I took care to bend my head so as to receive the picture of the belt
in the same direction upon the retina as I did [formerly ].

52 [Foot-note.] This was a precaution that occurred to me, as there
was a possibiiity that the vertical diameter of the retina might be
more or less sensible than the horizontal one; but I had no reason
afterward to suppose that any such difference really exists.

53 Observation upon the double ring of Saturn.

The outer ring is less bright than the inner ring. The inner ring is
very bright close to the dividing space; and at about half its breadth
it begins to change color, gradually growing fainter.

54 There is a dry wind and the telescope will not show objects as dis-
tinct as when moisture is discharged from the air by the precipita-
tion of dew.

Remark on the shadow of Saturn and its rings.

On the ring is the shadow ofthe body. The shadow of the ring upon
the body of the planet close to the ring is not parallel to the ring
at the two extremes, but a little broader there than in the middle,
the ends turning toward the south.

56 The five old satellites are all seen with a power of 60 on a 10-foot re-

flector.

57 Observations of the south pole of Saturn and the shadow of the ring.

The south polar regions of Satwn are alittle brighter than they used
to be; they are almost as bright as that belt. The shadow of the
ring upon Saturn is perfectly black, like the shadow of Saturn upon
the ring. The shadow of the ring upon Satur? on each side is bent
a little southward.

vex glasses.

59 Determination of the period of the rotation of Saturn. Explanation of

On the Nature and Construction of the Sun and Fired Stars. By WILLIAM
Herscne., LL. D., F. R. 8S. Read December 18, 1794.

The sun is the celestial body which should first attract our notice,
not only on its own account but since the fixed stars are, by the
strictest analogy, similar bodies.

NEWTON has shown that the sun retains the planets of our system in
their orbits ;

BRADLEY has assigned the velocity of the solar light; GALILEO,
SCHEINER, HEVELIUS, CassINI and others mae e ascertained its rota-
tion and the place of its equator. The Transit of Venus has given
means to calculate its distance, its real diameter, magnitude, density,
and the fall of heavy bodies on its surface. Thus we have already
a clear idea of the powerful influence of the sun.

I should not wonder if [considering what we know] we were induced
to think that nothing remained to be added; and yet we are still
very ignorant in regard to the internal construction of the sun.

The spots have been supposed to be solid bodies, the smoke of vol-
canoes, the scum floating on an ocean of fluid matter, clouds, opaque
masses, and to be many other things.

The sun itself has been called a globe of fire, though perhaps meta-
phorically.

The faculz have been called luminous vapors, ete.

The light of the sun itself has been supposed invisible and not to be
perceived except by reflection, though the proofs seem to me to
amount to no more than saying that we cannot see when rays of
light do no‘ enter the eye. But it is time now to profit by the obser-
vations we are in possession of.

Ihave availed myself of the labors of preceding astronomers, but have
been induced thereto by my own actual observation of the solar
phenomena.

Following is a short extract of my observations. In 1779 there was
a spot on the sun, divided into two parts, the largest above 31,000
miles in diameter. Both together must have extended above
50,000. The idea of its being occasioned by a volcanic explosion
ought to be rejected.

We have pretty good reason to believe that all the planets emit light
in some degree.

Example of the illumination of the moon during an eclipse, which
could not have been due to the light from the earth.

The dark half of Venus has been seen by different persons.

In regard to the large spot on the sun, L concluded that I viewed the
real solid body of the sun itself, of which we rarely see more than
its shining atmosphere.

Description of a large spot seen in 1783: the spot was plainly depressed
below the surface of the sun.

51 Explanation of the luminous shelving sides of a sun-spot. The sun
may have inequalities [like mountains] on its surface perhaps 50
or 600 miles high.

53 In 1791 I observed a large spot on the sun, depressed below the level
of its surface.

53 An optical deception takes place now and then when we view the
moon, which is that all the elevated spots on its surface will seem
to be cavities, and vice versa.

54 How very ill would these observations agree with the ideas of solid
bodies bobbing up and down in a fiery liquid? with the smoke of
volcanoes or the scum upon an ocean ?

54-58 Observations in detail from 1792, Aug. 26, to 1794, Oct. 13.

54 1792, Sept. 2. Twospots on the sun were seen with the naked eye.

55 It may not be impossible, as light is a transparent fluid, that the sun’s
real surface may also now and then be perceived, as we see the
shape of the wick of a candle through its flame.

56 Facule seem generally to accompany the spots, and they are certainly
elevations on the surface.

57 The sun cannot be so distinctly viewed with a small aperture and
faint darkening glasses as with a large aperture and stronger ones,

57 About all the spots the shining matter seems to have been disturbed,
and is uneven, lumpy, and zig-zagged in an irregular manner.

57 I call the spots black, not that they are entirely so, but to distinguish
them. There is not one of them to-day which is not at least partly
covered over with whitish and unequally bright nebulosity.

58 Ifthe brightness of the sun is occasioned by the lucid atmosphere the
intensity of the brightness must be less where it is depressed.

The results of these observations are: The sun has a very extensive
atmosphere, which consists of various elastic fluids more or less
lucid and transparent, and of which the Incid one is that which fur-
nishes us with light.

59 The manner in which I suppose the lucid fluid of the sun to be gen-
erated in its atmosphere may be better understood from an anal-
ogy drawn from the generation of clouds in our own atmosphere.
[This analogy is stated. ]

60 That the emission of light must waste the sun is not a difficulty that
can be opposed to our hypothesis.

60 Many of the operations of nature are carried on in her great labora-
tory which we cannot comprehend, but now and then we see some
of the tools with which she isat work. [The many telescopic com-
ets may restore to the sun what is lost by the emission of light. ]

61 According to my theory a dark spot in the sun is a place in its atmos-
phere which happens to be free from luminous decompositions, and
faculz are more copious mixtures of such fluids as decompose each
other.

62 The penumbra which attends the spots being depressed more or less
to about half way between the solid body of the sun and the upper
part of the regions where luminous decompositions take place, must
of course be fainter than other parts.

62 The regions where the luminous solar clouds are formed, adding thereto
the elevation of the facule, cannot be less than 1,843 miles nor much
more than 2,765 miles.

AND: Vol. P:

1795 «85 = 62-—s Wee ought _to compare these elevations, not to the clouds of our at-

mosphere, but to the elevation of the aurora borealis.

62 The density of the solar clouds though very great may not be exceed-
ingly more so than that of the aurora.

62 The opaque body of the sun we know to be of great solidity, and we
surmise it to be diversified with mountains and valleys.

63 This way of considering the sun removes the great dissimilarity be-
tween its condition and that of the other great bodies of the sys-
tem. Thesun then appears to be nothing else than a very eminent,
large, and lucid planet * * * most probably also inhabited by
beings whose organs are adapted to the peculiar circumstances of
that vast globe.

63 The heat produced by the sun’s rays on the earth is so considerable
that it may be objected that the surface of the sun must be scorched
up beyond all conception.

64 This objection answered by analogies with terrestrial circumstances.

65 J will now show that our moon is probably inhabited.

66 The moon is in many ways analogous to the earth, and to complete
the analogy it is only needed that it should be inhabited. To this
may be objected that we perceive no large seas there, that its
atmosphere is extremely rare, that there is no rain, ete.

66 These objecticns considered.

Suppose an inhabitant of the moon who has not properly considered
such analogical reasonings as might induce him to surmise that our
earth is inhabited, to give it as his opinion that the use of the earth
is to illuminate the moon, when direct daylight cannot be had, ete.

67 Suppose the inhabitants of the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and [ Uranus]
to look upon their primary planets merely as so many attractive
centers to keep together their orbits, ete., ete.

67 These considerations ought to make the inhabitants of the planets
wiser than we have supposed those of their satellites to be. We
surely ought not to say ‘‘the sun is merely an attractive center
to us.”

68 That stars are suns can hardly admit of a doubt. The sun turns on
its axis; so do variable stars; most probably all stars. Stars have
spots like the sun ; in some stars we know these spots to be change-
able.

68 Analogy may induce us to conclude that each of these stars is accom-
panied by a group of planets. If these suns themselves are primary
planets we may see some thousands of them with our own cyes,
and millions by the telescope, while the same analogy remains in
regard to the planets which these suns may support.

69 The idea of suns or stars being merely the supporters of systems of
planets is not to be admitted as a general one.

69 The stars in very compressed clusters are so close that even at a great
distance of the cluster there will not be room for the crowding in of
those planets for whose support these stars may be supposed to
exist.

69 As an instance, I take clusters Nos. 26, 28, and 35 of the VI class, and
also very close double stars.

70 Also, in some parts of the milky way the stars are so crowded that in
41 minutes of times no less than 258,000 stars passed through the
field of my telescope [in R. A. 198 35™—208 12™ ; Ne Pa D., 732 04a.

It seems, therefore, upon the whole not improbable that in many cases
stars are united in such close systems as not to leave much room for
the orbits of planets or comets; and that consequently many stars,
unless we would make them mere useless brilliant points, may them-
selves be lucid planets, perhaps unattended by satellites.

Postscript. ‘The following observations of the sun are added. They
are decisive in regard to one of the conditions of the lucid matter
of the sun. 1794, Noy. 26. The sun is mottled everywhere, equally
at poles and equator. This is owing to inequalities in its surface.

The lucid substance of the sun is neither a liquid nor an elastic fluid,
as is evident from its not instantly filling up the cavities of the
spots, cte. It exists, therefore, in the manner of lucid clouds swim-
ming in the transparent atmosphere of the sun; or, rather, of lu-
minous decompositions taking place within that atmosphere.

Description of a forty-foot reflecting telescope. By WILLIAM HERSCHEL,
Lh. D., fk. S: Read Jnne 11, 1795.

When I resided at Bath I had long been acquainted with the theory
of optics and mechanics and wanted only that experience so neces-
sary in the practical part of these sciences. This I acquired by
degrees at that place, where in my leisure hours by way of amus--
ment I made several 2-foot, 5-foot, 7-foot, 10-foot and 20-foot New-
tonian telescopes, besides others of the Gregorian form of 8, 12, 18
inches and 2, 3, 5 and 10 feet focal length.

In this way I made not less than 200 7-foot, 150 more 10-foot, and
about 80 20-foot mirrors, not to mention the Gregorian telescopes.

The number of stands I invented for these telescopes it would not be
casy to assign. My Newtonian stand was contrived about 1778.

In 1781 I began to construct a 30-foot aérial reflector, and having made’
a stand for it I cast the mirror 36 inches in diamcter, which was
cracked in cooling. I cast it a second time, and the furnace which
I had built in my house broke. Soon after, the Georgian Planet
was discovered [and observations on this interrupted the making
of new telescopes. ]

In 1783 I finished a very good 20-foot reflector, and in 1785 I began to
construct the 40-foot.

In the whole of the apparatus none but common workmen were em-
ployed, for I made drawings of cvery part of it and directed every
person’s labor, though sometimes there were not less than 40 em-
ployed at the same time. There was no interruption except my re-
moval from Clay Hall to Slough.

The 40-foot speculum was put into the tube and first used 1787, Feb.
19. The first mirror being too thin, ete., could not receive a good
figure, and a second was cast 1783, Jan. 26, which cracked in cool-
ing. It was recast Feb. 16, and on Oct. 24 it had a good figure and
I observed Saturn with it; but not being satisfied I worked upon it
till Aug. 27, 1789. Aug. 28, 1789, I discovered a sixth satellite of
Saturn. I date the finishing of the telescope from that time.

I have in 1789 many times taken up Saturn two or three hours before
its meridian passage and kept it in view with the greatest facility
till two or three hours after the passage, with a single assistant.

The method of observing is by what I Lave called the front view.

In 1783, when I began my sweeps, no cata:ogue of stars in zones ex-
isted. I therefore gave a pattern to my indefatigable assistant,
CAROLINA HERSCHEL, who brought all the British catalogue into
zones of 1° each from 45 N. P. D. to the horizon, and put the right
ascensions in time. This catalogue was afterwards completed to
the pole in zones of 5°.

A zone clock described.

The construction of the great mirror is as in fig. 46. The metal is 49}

Additional observations on the Comet. [1796, I.] By WiLLtamM Her-

On the method of observing the changes that happen to the fixed stars ; with
some remarks on the stability of the Light of our Sun. To which is added
a Catalogue of Comparative Brightness for ascertaining the Permanency
of the Lustre of Stars. By W1LLIAM HERSCHEL, LL. D.,F.R.S. Read
February 25, 1796.

The earliest observers noted the different brillianey of stars and have
classed them into magnitudes. Brightness and [apparent] size
were taken as synonymous terms, and may still be used as such,
notwithstanding the latter must be a consequence of the former.

If we suppose the stars to be about the size of our sun and at nearly
an equal distance from us and from each other, those which form
the first enclosure about us will appear brighter than the rest, and
there can only be a small number of them.

This hypothesis is nearly confirmed by observation, as may be seen
by looking over a globe and applying a pair of compasses opened
to 60°. Eleven pairs of Ist mag. stars are about 60° apart.

168 The hypothesis of an equality and an equal distribution of stars is too
far from being strictly true to be laid down as an unerring guide.

168 The stars of the 1st and 2d class, scrupulously examined, prove that
we must admit them to be either of different sizes or placed at dif-
ferent distances. Both varieties undoubtedly take place.

168 Thus it appears that in the classification of stars into magnitudes
there is either no natural standard or none that can be satisfactory.

169 If any dependence could be placed upon the method of magnitudes,
it would follow that certain of FLAMSTEED’s stars had undergone a
change in their Justre. [Examples given. ]

170 FLAMSTEED did not compare the stars to each other, but referred each
of them separately to its own imaginary standard.

A short inquiry into the confidence to be given to the method of mag-
nitudes may be of considerable use.

170 In FLAMSTEED’s observations an error of 1™ in the brighter classes and
14™ in the fainter would hardly deserve attention.

171 In comparing the observations of different astronomers larger errors
may be expected.

172 Example. From FLAMSTEED’s and LACAILLE’s observations of
Leonis we may conclude that this star is now less brilliant than for-
merly.

173 I place each star, instead of giving its magnitude, into a short series
[sequence] constructed upon the order of brightness of the nearest
proper stars.

174 The Greek letters now affixed to the names of stars do not point out
their order of brightness, except for the few brightest stars of each
constellation. [Examples. ]

175 A doubt may arise whether any succession of brightness might be
argued from the very first, second, or third letters of the alphabet,
when we find them now arranged thus, as ( aCassiopee, 6 a Cancri,
y 6 Aquilae, ete.

177 LALANDE, PIGOTT, and GOODERICKE have used the method I propose
in special cases.

178 Simple as my method is in principle, it is very laborious in its pro-
gress. I began to use it 14 years ago.

178 My first design was to draw each whole constellation into one series.
Accordingly I began, July 16, 1781, to arrange the stars in Ophiuchus,
thus: a, 6, 6, f, 7, «, v, €. The defect of this arrangement was
that we do not always have a proper connection of the steps of the
series; the intervals being too great in some cases, too small in
others.

178 To get over these difficulties I marked the stars by degrees, three in
a magnitude 1’, 1”, 1/; 2’, 2”, 2’, ete., as “May 12, 1783; order of
the stars in Bodtis ‘al’, ¢ 2”, 7 2/", y BO 3’, ete.”

179 Ditticulties with this plan.

180 Other methods tried.

181 The method finally adopted explained. [The method of sequences. ]

183 Difficulties in carrying out the method stated.

184 These observations are of importance, as will appear when we remem-
ber the great number of alterations of stars which have certainly
happened within two centuries.

Sun? If it be allowed to admit the similarity of stars with our sun,

how necessary will it be to take notice of the fate of our neighbor-
ing suns in order to guess at that of our own. That star which we
call the Sun may to-morrow begin to undergo a gradual decay of
brightness, like ( Leonis, a Ceti, « Draconis, 6 Urse Majoris, and
many others that will be mentioned in my catalogues.

It may suddenly increase like the wonderful star in the back of
Cassiopea’s chair, or gradually come on like 6 Geminorum, 7 Ceti,
€ Sagittarii, etc.; or it may turn into a periodical star of 25 days’
duration, as Algol is one of 3 days, 6 Cephei of 5 days, ete.

Perhaps the easiest way of accounting for past changes in our eli-
mates is to surmise that our sun has been formerly sometimes more
or sometimes less bright than now.

A method of ascertaining the quantity or intenseness of solar light
might be contrived. Perhaps the thermometer alone might be suf-
ficient.

Introductory Remarks and Explanations of the Arrangement and Charac-
ters used in the following Catalogue.

This first catalogue contains 9 constellations; the rest will follow.

All the observations have been made in very fine nights when there
was no suspicion of any whitish haziness.

All observations upon stars of any considerable magnitude have been
made with the naked eye.

Wherever I have used magnitudes I have adopted FLAMSTEED’S scale.

From the numerous differences we have reason to suspect many
changes in the lustre of stars since FLAMSTEED’s time.

On the periodical star a Herculis; with remarks tending to establish the
rotatory motion of the Stars on their axes. To which is added a second
catalogue of the comparative Brightness of the stars. By WILLIAM
HERSCHEL, LL. D., F. R. S. Read June 9, 1796.

In my first catalogue I announced @ Hercutis as a periodical star. It
has been compared with several standard stars but chiefly with 2
Ophiuchi.

Table of the variation of light observed in a@ (FI. 64) Herculis, com-
pared to x (FI. 27) Ophiuchi.

The period is about 60 days and a quarter. Greater accuracy can
only be obtained by future observations.

On the Rotatory motion of the Stars on their Axes.

We ought not to be satisfied with enrolling the discovery of one more
periodical star among the list of facts we are acquainted with; for
this would indeed be of no great consequence.

Darker spots on the surface of stars will account for all the phenomena
of periodic stars so satisfactorily that we certainly need not look
out for any other cause. The objections which may be made are:
the periods in Algol, 6 Lyra, 5 Cephei, and y Antinoi are short 3,
5,6, and 7, ete., days; those of o Ceti, the star in Hydra and in
Cygnus are long; 331, 394, and 497 days.

Hitherto we have had but 7 periodical stars [some of very short, some

of very long periods]; the discovery of a Herculis as a periodical
star with a period of 60 days supplies a link in the chain and re-
moves the objection that arose from the vacancy.

1795 86 456 Another instance of slow rotation is the 5th satellite of Saturn [ Jape-
tus], which revolves on its axis in 79 days.

457 The rotations of the sun, moon, and some of the planets are known
by their spots; [Japetus] is too small and too distant to allow its spots
to be observed. But what we can no longer perceive we can now
supply by rational arguments. The change in the light of the satel-
lite proves the rotation; the rotation proves the existence of the
spots. A still more extended similarity between the sun and tho
stars offers itself, by the spots which must also be admitted to take
place.

457 There are reasons to surmise that 34 Cygni is a periodical star of 18
years’ return [see Phil. Trans., 1786, p. 201].

458 When the biography of the stars, if I may be allowed the expression,
is arrived to more perfection, we may then possibly not only be still
more assured of their rotatory motion, but also perceive that they
have other movements, such as nutations of their axes, ete.

stance that could forward the discovery of the rotation of the
secondary planets. Since I have determined by observation that
Japetus rotates according to the law obeyed by our moon, it seems
natural to conclude that all the secondary planets do the same;
consequently, a few good observations that coincide with this
theory will go a good way towards confirming it.

333 J also desired to examine the nature and construction of the satellites.
Here phenomena occurred that may be thought remarkable and
perhaps contradictory. So far from attempting to lessen the force
of such animadversions, I shall be the first to point out difficulties
in order that future observations may be made to resolve them.

take notice of the many causes of deception, etc. The method of
comparing the brightness is not subject to so great errors as esti-
mating this in terms of an ideal standard. But the situation of the
satellites with respect to the planet introduces a new source of
error.

344 It appears that considerable changes take place in the brightness of
the satellites, and also a change in their apparent magnitude.

344 The first fact proves that the satellites have a rotatory motion upon
their axes of the same duration with their revolutions about the
primary planet. The second either shows that the bodies of the
satellites are not spherical, or that some parts of the dises reflect
hardly any light.

On the discovery of four additional satellites of the Georgium Sidus, The
retrograde motion of its old Satellites announced, and the cause of their
Disappearance at certain distances from the Planet explained. By WIL-
LIAM HERSCHEL, LL. D., F. R. S. Read December 14, 1797.

LT have lately recomputed my observations of the satellites of [ Uranus]
with improved tables from 1787 to now. I laid down a set of the-
orems relating to the motions of these satellites; I caleulated tables
and devised means for checking the computations.

I here announce that the motion of the Georgian satellites is retro-
grade.

From my miscellaneous observations, the existence of four additional
satellites will be proved; the observations which tend to ascertain
the existence of rings to the planet not being satisfactorily sup-
ported, this surmise will be given up, or left till superior instruments
are provided.

Observations of stars near the planet are given under the head Je-
ports, and of the new satellites under the head Observations.

Investigation of additional satellites.

Arguments upon the Reports and Observations.

An interior satellite. [The observations described. ]

An intermediate satellite. [The observations described. ]

An exterior satellite. [The observations described. ]

The most distant satellite. [The observations described. ]

The arrangement of the satellites together will be thus:

First satellite, the interior one of Jan. 18, 1790.

Second satellite, the nearest old one of Jan. 11, 1787.

Third satellite, the intermediate one of Mar. 26, 1794.

Fourth satellite, the farthest old one of Jan. 11, 1787.

Fifth satellite, the exterior one of Feb. 9, 1790.

Sixth satellite, the most distant one of Feb. 28, 1794.

Observations and reports tending to the discovery of one or more rings of
the Georgian Planet and the flattening of its Polar Regions.

Remarks upon the foregoing observations.

The observation of the 26th Feb., 1792, seems to be very decisive
against the existence of a ring, etc., and I venture to affirm that
the planet has no ring in the least resembling those of Saturn.

The flattening of the poles of the planet seems to be sufficiently as-
certained.

This being admitted, we may conclude that the Georgian Planet also
has a rotation on its axis of a considerable degree of velocity.

lites, and to their vanishing at certain distances from the Planet.

The satellites become regularly invisible at certain distances from
the planet.

The first satellite [ Titania] usually vanishes at 18”.

The second satellite [ Oberon] usually vanishes at 20.

In uncommon and beautiful nights the first has once been seen at
13.8 and the 2d at 17/3.

A dense atmosphere to the planet would account for this if it were
not that the satellites are lost as well in the nearest half of their
orbits as in the farthest. A satellite cannot be obscured by an at-
mosphere that is behind it.

The light of Jupiter and Saturn is diffused for several minutes [of arc]
all around them. Their satellites are bright, and having much
light to lose they comparatively lose but little. [Uranus] is very
faint ; its satellites are very nearly the dimmest objects that ean be
seen in the heavens, so that they cannot bear any considerable
diminution of their light without becoming invisible.

The distances at which the satellites vanish will show their relative
brightness. The first satellite [ Titania] is rather brighter than the
second [Oberon]. The interior satellite cannot be much inferior in
brightness to these.

On the power of penetrating into Space by Telescopes; with a comparative
Determination of the Exient of that Power in natural Vision, and in Tel-
escopes of various Sizes and Constructions; illustrated by select observa-
tions. By WiLLIAM HERSCHEL, LL.D., F. R.S. Read November
215 1799:

The power of penetrating into space by telescopes is very different
from magnifying power, and ought to be considered separately.

Luminous bodies as here defined are such as throw out light, what-
ever may be the cause of it, including those that shine by reflection
only, and we may distinguish the class of self-luminous bodies when
it is necessary.

The question will arise whether luminous bodies seatter light in all
directions equally; but until we know more of the powers that emit
and reflect light we shall probably remain ignorant on this head.

What I mean to say relates only to the physical points into which we
may suppose the surfaces of luminous bodies to be divided. When
we consider their whole construction the question assumes another
form.

We know from experience that light, flame, and luminous gases are
penetrable to the rays of light.

[Foot-note.] An experiment given to prove this.

It follows therefore that every part of the sun’s disc cannot appear
equally luminous to a given observer on account of the unequal
depth of its atmosphere. (See Phil. Trans., 1795, p. 46.)

BIBLIOGRAPHY OF HERSCHEL’S WRITINGS.
SYNOPSIS OF THE WRITINGS OF—Continued.

The greatest inequalities in the brightness of luminous bodies will be
owing to their natural texture. .

Brightness, I ascribe to bodies that throw out light, and those that

throw out most are the brightest.

Let the whole quantity of light thrown out by a luminous body be, L;
suppose the surface of this body to be composed of N luminous phys-
ical points. Let C stand for the mean copiousness of light thrown
out from all the physical points of a luminous object. Let ¢ express
the copiousness of emitting light of any number of physical points
that agree in this respect, and let their number be x; similarly I
define ¢' and n! for another set of points, and soon. Then L=cn
+ cn! + @n?+ete., and L—N=C.

An objection to this answered.

The brightness of an object is truly defined by CN. The brightness
arising from the great value of C may be called the intrinsic bright-
ness; that from the great value of N the aggregate brightness; the
absolute brightness is in all cases CN.

In finding an expression for the appearance of luminous objects at any
assigned distance we must leave out of account every part of CN
which is not applied for the purposes of vision. L representing the
whole light thrown out by CN, let 1 be that part of it used in vision
either by the eye or the telescope.

The equation of light, in this sense, is CN=l.

The expression for its quantity at the distance of the observer D will
be 1+ D?.

In natural vision / undergoes a considerable change by the opening
or contracting of the pupil of the eye.

In some experiments on ight made at Bath in 1780 I [noticed the in-
creased power of vision after staying some time in a dark room].
The opening of the iris is probably not the only cause of seeing better
after remaining long in the dark, but the tranquillity of the retina

may render it more fit to receive impressions.

This is supported by telescopic vision, for in my sweeps of 4, 5, or 6
hours’ duration my eye became so sensitive that when a star of the
3d magnitude came towards the field of view I had to withdraw my
eye in order not to injure the delicacy of vision. The opening of
the iris was not the cause, as the diameter of the ‘optic pencil was
no more than 0.12 inch.

With the 40-foot telescope the appearance of Sirius announced itself
like the dawn of the morning till this brilliant star at last entered
the field of the telescope with all the splendor of the rising sun, and
forced me to take my eye from that beautiful sight.

I found the eye, coming from the light, required nearly 20 minutes
before it could see delicate objects, and that the view of a star of
the 2d or 3d magnitude would so disorder it that nearly the same
time was required to reéstablish its tranquillity.

If a is the opening of the iris and A the aperture of the telescope ae
is the ight admitted by the eye, and a will be that admitted by
the telescope.

Whenever the pencil of light from the telescope is larger than the
aperture of the pupil, light is lost. If m be the magnifying power,
A+m ought not to exceed a.

1800 90 55 Objection to the foregoing. It being proved that an object is equally
bright at all distances, it may be urged that in a telescope the dif-
ferent distance of stars can be of no account with regard to their
brightness, and that we must consequently be able to see stars
which are many thousands of times farther than Sirius from us.

56 The origin of such objections is in want of distinction in the two sorts
of brightness, which have been discriminated by intrinsic and abso-
lute brightness.

56 The demonstrations of opticians with regard to what I call intrinsic
brightness, will not oppose what I affirm of absolute brightness.

57 Though the sun, to an observer on Saturn, must be as bright as it is
here on the earth, if cannot be meant that an inhabitant standing
on the planet Saturn and looking at the sun should absolutely receive
as much light from it as one on earth receives when he sees it.

57 The picture of the sun on the retina of the Saturnian observer is as
intensely illuminated as that on the retina of the terrestrial astron-
omer, but it should be remembered that the sun on Saturn appears
to be a hundred times less than on the earth; and that conse-
quently, though it may there be intrinsically as bright, it must here
be absolutely an hundred times brighter.

57 This reasoning is entirely applicable to the stars; and the light we
can receive from the stars is truly expressed by a

58 Hence I am authorized to conclude that stars cannot be seen by the
naked eye when they are more than seven or eight times farther
from us than Sirius, and that they become, comparatively speak-
ing, very soon invisible with our best instruments.

58 With respect to the naked eye, the power of penetrating into space
is limited. Among reflecting luminous objects our penetrating
powers are sufficiently ascertained. An object seen by reflected
light at a greater distance than the Georgian Planet, it has never
been allowed us to perceive.

59 The range of natural vision with self-iuminous objects is incompara-
bly more extended, but less accurately to be ascertained.

59 The general supposition is admitted that stars, at least those which
seem to be promiscuously scattered, are probably one with another
of a certain magnitude.

59 [Foot-note.] The Phil. Trans. for the year 1796, page 166, 167, 168 is
referred to for support of this assumption.

60 The difference in brightness between Sirius, Arcturus, a Cygni, and
B Tauri, does not seem to alter the dimensions of the iris; a, there-
fore, becomes a given quantity and may be left out.

61 Admitting that the latter of these stars are probably at double the
distance of the former, we can have no other guidé to lead us a
third step than the before-mentioned hypothesis; in consequence of
which it is probable that stars of the third magnitude may be
placed about three times as far from us as those of the first.

61 Our third step forward into space may therefore very properly be
said to fall on the pole star, on y Cygni, ¢ Bootis, and all those of
the same order.

62 The difference between these and the stars of the preceding order is
much less striking than that between the stars of the first and sec-
ond magnitudes. So the calculated ratio of the brightness of a star

566 BIBLIOGRAPHY OF HERSCHEL’S WRITINGS.

of the sixth magnitude to that of one of the seventh, is but little
more than 1} to 1.

1800 90 62 The faintness of the stars of the 7th magnitude gives us little room
to believe that we can penetrate much farther into space with ob-
jects of no greater brightness than stars.

63 I think, from the faintness of the stars of the 7th magnitude, and
fromthe foregoing considerations, we are authorized to conclude that
no star, eight, nine, or at most ten times as far from us as Sirius,
can possibly be perceived by the natural eye.

63 Where the light of single stars falls short, however, the united lustre
of sidereal systems will still be perceived. We easily see the united
lustre of the stars in the sword-handle of Perseus, though the light
of no one of the single stars could have affected the unassisted eye.

64 Perhaps, among the farthest objects that can make an impression on
the eye, when not assisted by telescopes, may be reckoned the
nebula in the girdle of Andromeda discovered by SIMON MARIUS in
1612.

64 It has been shown that brightness or light is to the naked eye truly

represented by a in a telescope, therefore, the light admitted will

be expressed by = Hence it would follow that the artificial

power of penetrating into space should be to the natural one as A
toa. But this proportion must be corrected by the practical defi-
ciency in light reflected and transmitted.

65 As the result of many experiments with plane mizrors, polished like
my large ones, and of the same composition of metal, I find we shall
have, in a telescope of my construction, with one reflection, 63,796
rays, out of 100,000 come to the eye. In the Newtonian form,
with a single eye-lens, 42,901 ; and, with a double eye-glass, 40,681
will remain for vision.

65 Since the brightness of luminous objects is inversely as the squares
of the distances, it follows that the penetrating power must be as
the square roots of the light received by the eye.

66 In natural vision, therefore, this power is truly expressed by Y q2J,
and since we have now also obtained a proper correction x, we must
apply it to the incident light with telescopes.

66 In the Newtonian and other constructions where two specula are
used there will also be some loss of light on account of the inter-
position of the small speculum ; therefore, putting b for its diameter,
we have 42—}2 for the real incident ight. This being corrected as
above, will give the general expression x] x A5—p2 for the same
power in telescopes.

66 Then, if we put natural light 1—1, and divide by a, we have the

steeple what o’clock it was, notwithstanding the naked eye could
no longer see the steeple itself. Here I only spe: uk of the penetrat-
ing power; for though it might require magnifying power to see the

Comparison of the space-penetrating power of 20-foot telescope caleu-

lated according to the principles developed in this paper with that
deduced from observation, as given in Phil. Trans., vol. 75, p. 247,
248. A substantial agreement leads to the conclusion that no single
star above 489.551, or at most 612 times as far as Sirius, can any
longer be seen in this telescope.

The space-penetrating power of the large reflector was 192; admit-

ting that stars of the 7th magnitude are visible to the unassisted eye,
this telescope would show stars of the 1,342d magnitude. There-
fore, a cluster of 5,000 stars might be seen by the 40-foot reflector at
a distance at least 300,000 times that of the nearest fixed star.

The calculated time necessary to sweep the whole heavens with the 40-

foot telescope, assuming 100 hours of observing time in the year as
the most probable deduction from experience, is 812 years.

that are commonly taken for granted; especially as the means of
resolving any doubt, when once it is entertained, are often within
our reach.

In a variety of experiments I have occasionally made relating to the
method of viewing the sun, with large telescopes, to the best advan-
tage, I used various combinations of differently coloured darkening
glasses. What appeared remarkable was that when I used some of
them I felt a sensation of heat, though I had but little light; while
others gave me much light, with scarce any sensation of heat. Now,
asin these different combinations the sun’s image was also differently
coloured, it occurred to me that the prismatic rays might have the
power of heating bodies very unequally distributed among them; and
as I judged it right in this respect to entertain a doubt, 1t appeared
equally proper to admit the same with regard to light. If certain
colours should be more apt to occasion heat, others might, on the
contrary, be more fit for vision, by possessing a superior ‘lfumingte
ing power. At all events, it would be proper to recur to experi-
ments for a decision.”

ferently coloured light.

“The maximum of illumination lies in the brightest yellow or palest
green.”

“May not the chemical properties of the prismatic colours be as dif-
ferent as those which relate to light and heat? Adequate methods
for an investigation of them may easily be found; and we cannot
too minutely enter into an analysis of light, which is the most subtle
of all the active principles that are concerned in the mechanism of
the operations of nature.”

Radiant Heat is of different Refrangibility.

“‘¥ must now remark that my foregoing experiments ascertain beyond
a doubt that radiant heat, as well as light, whether they be the
same or different agents, is not only refrangible, but is also subject
to the laws of dispersion arising from its different refrangibility ;
and, as this subject is new, I may be permitted to dwell a few mo-
ments upon it. The prism refracts radiant heat, so as to separate
that which is less efficacious from that which is more so. The
whole quantity of radiant heat contained in a sunbeam, if this dif-
ferent refrangibility did not exist, must inevitably fall uniformly
on a space equal to the area of the prism; and if radiant heat were
not refrangible at all, it would fall upon an equal space in the place
where the shadow of the prism, when covered, may be seen. But,
neither of these events taking place, it is evident tHat radiant heat
is subject to the laws of refraction, and also to those of the different
refrangibility of light. May not this lead us to surmise that radiant
heat consists of particles of light of a certain range of momenta,
and which range may extend a little farther on each side of refrangi-
bility than that of light? We have shewn that in a gradual ex-
posure of the thermometer to the rays of the prismatic spectrum,
beginning from the violet, we come to the maximum of light long
before we come to that of heat, which lies at the other extreme. By
several experiments, which time will not allow me now to report,
it appears that the maximum of illumination has little more than
half the heat of the full red rays; and, from other experiments, I
likewise concluded that the full red falls still short of the maxi-
mum of heat, which perhaps lies even a little beyond visible re-
fraction. In this case, radiant heat will at least partly, if not
chiefly, consist, if I may be permitted the expression, of invisible
light; that is to say, of rays coming from the sun, that have such
a momentum as to be unfit for vision. And, admitting, as is highly
probable, that the organs of sight are only adapted to receive im-
pressions from particles of a certain momentum, it explains why
the maximum of illumination should be in the middle of the re-
frangible rays, as those which have greater or less momenta are
likely to become equally unfit for impressions of sight. Whereas,
in radiant heat, there may be no such limitation to the momentum
of its particles. From the powerful effects of a burning lens, how-
ever, we gather the information that the momentum of terrestrial
radiant heat is not likely to exceed that of the sun, and that, con-
sequently, the refrangibility of calorific rays cannot extend much
beyond that of colourific light. Hence, we may also infer that the

invisible heat of red-hot iron, gradually cooled till it ceases to shine

an easy solution of the reflection of invisible heat by concave mir-
rors.”

284 Experiments on the Refrangibility of the invisible Rays of the Sun. By
WILLIAM HERSCHEL, LL. D., F. R. 8S. Read April 24, 1800.

284 Description of method. Three sensitive thermometers were placed
upon a small stand upon which a spectrum of the sunlight was
caused to fall.

285 Report of first experiment. A thermometer $ inch beyond limit of
visible red rose 64 degrees in 10 minutes.

286 Report of second experiment. As a result it was ‘‘evident that there
was a refraction of rays coming from the sun, which, though not
fit for vision, were yet highly invested with a power of occasioning
heat.”

287-288 Experiments at the violet end of the spectrum.

“From these last experiments I was now sufficiently persuaded that
no rays which might fall beyond the violet could have any percepti-
ble power, either of illuminating or of heating; and that both these
powers continued together throughout the prismatic spectrum, and
ended where the faintest violet vanishes:”

289-290 Experiments to determine the situation of the maximum of the

heating power.

291 “The 5th and 6th experiments show, that the power of heating is ex-
tended to the utmost limits of the visible violet rays, but not beyond
them, and that it is gradually impaired as the rays grow more refran-
gible.

“The four last experiments prove, that the maximum of the heat-
ing power is vested among the invisible rays; and is probably not
less than half an inch beyond the last visible ones, when projected
in the manner before mentioned. The same experiments also show,
that the sun’s invisible rays, in their less refrangible state, and con-
siderably beyond the maximum, still exert a heating power fully
equal to that of red-coloured light; and that, consequently, if we may
infer the quantity of the efficient from the effect produced, the invis-
ible rays of the sun probably far exceed the visible ones in number,

“To conclude, if we call light, those rays which illuminate objects, and
radiant heat, those which heat bodies, it may be inquired whether
light be essentially different from radiant heat? In answer to which
I would suggest, that we are not allowed, by the rules of philoso-
phizing, to admit two different causes to explain certain effects, if

they may be accounted for by one. A beam of radiant heat, eman-
ating from the sun, consists of rays that are differently refrangi-
ble. The range of their extent, when dispersed by a prism, begins
at violet-coloured light, where they are most refracted and have
the least efficacy. We have traced these calorific rays throughout
the whole extent of the prismatic spectrum; and found their power
increasing, while their refrangibility was lessened, as far as to the

1800 90 292 confines of red-ccloured light. But their diminishing refrangibility
and increasing power did not stop here; for we have pursued them
a considerable way beyond the prismatic spectrum, into an invisible
state, still exerting their increasing energy, with a decrease of re-
frangibility, up to the maximum of their power; and have also
traced them to that state where, though still refracted, their energy,
on account, we may suppose, of their now failing density, decreased
pretty fast; after which the invisible ¢hermometrical spectrum, if I
may so call it, soon vanished.

“Tf this be a true account of solar heat, for the support of which I
appeal to my experiments, it remains only for us to admit that such
of the rays of the sun as have the refrangibility of those which
are contained in the prismatic spectrum by the construction of the
organs of sight are admitted under the appearance of light and
colours; and that the rest, being stopped in the coats and humours
of the eye, act upon them, as they are known to do upon all the
other parts of our body, by occasioning a sensation of heat.”

1800 90 293 Experiments on the solar and on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat ;
with a comparative view of the Laws to which Light and Heat, or rather
the Rays which occasion them, are subject, in order to determine whether they
are the same or different. By WiLLIAM HERSCHEL, LL. D., F. R. 8S.
Part I. Read May J5, 1800.

“The word heat, in its common acceptation, denotes a certain sen-
sation well known to every person. The cause of this sensation,
to avoid ambiguity, ought to have been distinguished by a name
different from that which is used to point out its effect. Various
authors, indeed, who have treated on the subject of heat, have
occasionally added certain terms to distinguish their conceptions,
such as latent, absolute, specific, sensible heat, while others have
adopted the new expressions of caloric and the matter of heat.
None of these descriptive appellations, however, would have com-
pletely answered my purpose. I might, as in the preceding papers,
have used the name radiant heat, which has been introduced by a
celebrated author, and which certainly is not very different from
the expressions I have now adopted; but by calling the subject of
my researches the rays that occasion heat I cannot be misunderstood
as Meaning that those rays themselves are heat, nor do I in any re-
spect engage myself to show in what manner they produce heat.

“From what has been said it follows that any objections that may
be alleged from the supposed agency of heat in other circum-

294 stances than in its state of radiance or heat-making rays cannot
be admitted against my experiments. For, notwithstanding I may
be inclined to believe that all phenomena in which heat is con-
cerned, such as the expansion of bodies, fluidity, congelation, fer-

mentation, friction, etc., as well as heat in its various states of
being, latent, specific, absolute, or sensible, may be explained on
the principle of heat-making rays, and vibrations occasioned by
them in the parts of bodies; yet this is not intended at present to
be any part of what I shall endeavor to establish.

““{ must also remark that in using the word rays I do not mean to
oppose, much less to countenance, the opinion of those philosophers
who still believe that light itself comes to us from the sun, not by
rays, but by the supposed vibrations of an elastic ether, every-
where diffused throughout space. I only claim the same privilege
for the rays that occasion heat which they are willing to allow to
those that illuminate objects. For, in what manner soever this
radiance may be effected, it will be fully proved hereafter that the
evidence, either for rays or for vibrations which occasion heat,
stands on the same foundation on which the radiance of the illumin-
ating principle, light, is built.”

““We shall begin with the heat of luminous bodies in general, such
as, in the first place, we have it directly from the sun; and as, in
the second, we may obtain it from terrestrial flames, such as torches,
candles, lamps, blue-lights, ete.

“Our next division comprehends the heat of coloured radiants. This
we obtain, in the first place, from the sun, by separating its rays in
a prism; and, in the second, by having recourse to culinary fires,
openly exposed.

“The third division relates to heat obtained from radiants, where
neither light nor colour in the rays can be perceived. This, as I
have shown, is to be had, in the first place, directly from the sun, by
means of a prism applied to its rays; and, in the second, we may
have it from fires inclosed in stoves, and from red-hot iron cooled
till it can no longer be seen in the dark.

‘« Besides the arrangement in the order of my experiments which would
arise from this division, we have another subject to consider. For,
since the chief design of this paper is to give a comparative view
of the operations that may be performed on the rays that occasion
heat, and of those which we already know to have been effected on
the rays that occasion light, it will be necessary to take a short re-
view of the latter. Ishall merely select such facts as not only are
perfectly well known, but especially such as will answer the inten-
tion of my comparative view, and arrange them in the following
‘order: 1. Light, both solar and terrestrial, is a sensation occasioned
by rays emanating from luminous bodies, which have a power of
illuminating objects; and, according te circumstances, of making
them appear of various colours. 2. These rays are subject to the
laws of reflection. 3. They are also subject to the laws of refrac-
tion. 4. They are of different refrangibility. 5. They are liable
to be stopped, in certain proportions, when transmitted through
diaphanous bodies. 6. They are liable to be scattered on rough
surfaces. 7. They have hitherto been supposed to have a power of
heating bodies; but this remains to be examined.

‘The similar propositions relating to heat, which are intended to be
proved in this paper, will stand as follows: 1. Heat, both solar and
terrestrial, is asensation occasioned by rays emanating from candent
substances, which have a power of heating bodies. 2. These rays

Ist Experiment. Reflection of the Heat of the Sun.

A thermometer was exposed at the eye end of a ten-feet Newtonian
telescope. The rays, after three regular reflections, caused the
thermometer to rise 58 degrees. The experiment .cannot ascertain
whether these rays were those of light or not.

2d Experiment. Ieflection of the Heat of a Candle.

The ball of a thermometer, placed in the secondary focus of a steel
mirror, received 34 degrees of heat in five minutes.

3d Experiment. fLeflection of the Heat that accompanies the Solar Pris-
matic colours. ;

The same mirror was covered by a piece of pasteboard, which, through
a proper opening, admitted all the visible colors to fall on its pol-
ished surfaces, but excluded every other ray of heat that might be
either on the violet or on the red side, beyond the spectrum. The
thermometer in the focus rose 35 degrees above its stationary posi-
tion in the direct red rays when the mirror was covered. ‘‘ Thus
the prismatic colours, if they are not themselves the heat-making
rays, are at least accompanied by suchas have a power of occasion-
ing heat, and are liable to be regularly reflected.”

4th Experiment. Jeflection of the Heat of a red-hot Poker.

5th Experiment. Jeflection of the Heat of a Coal Fire by a plain Mirror.

6th Experiment. Jteflection of I’ive-heat by a Prism.

7th Experiment. Leflection of Invisible Solar Heat.

On a board about 4 feet 6 inches long was placed at one end a small
plain mirror, and at the other two sensitive thermometers. Upon
this board was projected a prismatic spectrum, and just beyond the
limit of the red rays the mirror was stationed so as to reflect invis-
ible rays to the ball of one of the thermometers. In ten minutes
this thermometer stood four degrees above the other.

8th Experiment. Reflection and Condensation of the Invisible Solar Rays-

At the focus of a concave mirror was placed the ball of a thermome,
ter. Upon the mirror was thrown a prismatic spectrum which coy-
ered half the mirror. This half was covered by a pasteboard screen
so that only invisible rays were reflected to the ball of the ther-
mometer. In one minute the thermometer rose 19 degrees.

9th Experiment. Reflection of Invisible Culinary Heat.

10th Experiment. Reflection of the Invisible Rays of Heat of a Poker,
cooled from being red-hot till it could no longer be seen in a dark Place.

11th Experiment. Lefraction of Solar Heat.

The rays from the sun, falling on the mirror of a Newtonian tele-
scope 24 inches in diameter, were transmitted after reflection through
the four lenses of an eye-piece and allowed to fall on the ball of a
thermometer.

12th Experiment. Lefraction of the Heat of a Candle.

The image of a candle flame was thrown upon the ball of a thermom-
eter by a lens 1.1 in diameter.

310 13th Experiment. Refraction of the Heat that accompanies the Coloured
part of the Prismatic Spectrum.

A burning lens 9 inches in diameter was covered by a piece of paste-
board in which there was an opening of a sufficient size to admit
all the coloured part of the prismatic spectrum. As the thermom-
eter showed rise of temperature, the conclusions were, that if the
coloured rays themselves are not of a heat-making nature, they are
at least accompanied with rays that have the power of heating

311 bodies, and that these rays are subject to certain laws of refraction
which cannot differ much from those affecting light.

315-316 16th Experiment. Refraction of Fire-heat by an Instrument resem-

bling a Telescope.

317 17th Experiment. Refraction of the Invisible rays of Solar Heat. The
burning Icns of 9 inches diameter was half covered by a screen of
pasteboard, upon which the prismatic spectrum was thrown, keep-
ing the last visible red colour one-tenth of an inch from the edge of
the pasteboard. The thermometer, which had its ball at the focus
for red rays, showed great increase of temperature; but at the same
time exhibited a slight red colouration. This occasioned a surmise
that possibly the invisible rays of the sun might become visible, if
they were properly condensed.

318 18th Experiment. Trial to render the Invisible Rays of the Sun Visible
by Condensation.

‘vhe previous experiment was modified so that the last visible red
colour was two tenths of an inch from the margin of the paste-
board. Here a marked increase of temperature was evinced with-
out a vestige of light.

319 19th Experiment. Refraction of Invisible Culinary Heat.

A heated cylinder of iron was placed on one side of a lens of 1.1 inches
diameter, and the ball of a thermometer in the secondary focus on
the other side of the lens. A small pasteboard screen was alternately
removed from before the thermometer and replaced, the thermometer
exhibiting corresponding rise and fall of temperature, from a bright
red heat of the cylinder down to its weakest state of black heat.

320-321 20:h Experiment. Confirmation of the 19th.

322 ‘As we have now traced the rays which occasion heat, both solar and
terrestrial, through all the varieties that were mentioned in the be-
ginning of this paper, and have shown that in every state they are
subject to the laws of reflection and refraction, it will be easy to per-
ceive that I have made good a proof of the first three of my prop-
ositions. For the same experiments which have convinced us that,
according to our second and third articles, heat is both reflexible
and refrangible, establish also its radiant nature, and thus equally
prove the first of them.”

shew the similarity between light and heat, we should at the same
time point out some striking and substantial differences, which will

which hereafter we may proceed to argue, when the question re-

“A mere inspection of the two figures, which have been drawn as

illumination. * * * These rays neither agree in their mean

506 ‘Before we enter into a discussion of this question it appears to me
that we are authorized, by the experiments which have been de-
livered in this paper, to make certain conclusions that will entirely
alter the form of our enquiry. Thus, from the 18th experiment it
appears that 21 degrees of solar heat were given in one minute to
a thermometer by rays which had no power of illuminating objects
and which could not be rendered visible, notwithstanding they
were brought together in the focus of a burning lens. The same
has also been proved of terrestial heat in the 9th experiment, where
in one minute 39° of it were given to a thermometer by rays totally
invisible, even when condensed by a concave mirror. Hence it is
established, by incontrovertible facts, that there are rays of heat,

~ poth solar and terrestrial, not endowed with a power of rendering
objects visible.

“It has also been proved, by the whole tenour of our prismatic ex-
periments, that this invisible heat is continued, from the beginning
of the least refrangible rays towards the most refrangible ones ina
series of uninterrupted gradation, from a gentle beginning to a
certain maximum, and that it afterwards declines as uniformly to
a vanishing state. These phenomena have been ascertained by an
instrument which, figuratively speaking, we may call blind, and
which, therefore, could give us no information about light; yet,
by its faithful report, the thermometer, which is the instrument
alluded to, can leave no doubt about the existence of the different
degrees of heat in the prismatic spectrum.

“This consideration, as has been observed, must alter the form of
our proposed inquiry, for the question being thus at least partly
decided, since it is ascertained that we have rays of heat which
give no light, it can only become a subject of inquiry whether

some of these heat-making rays may not have a power of render-
ing objects visible, superadded to their now already established
power of heating bodies.”

1800 90 508 “It has been shown that the effect of heat and of illumination may
be represented by the two united spectra which we have given.”
““Now when these are compared it appears that those who would
have the rays of heat also to do the office of light must be obliged
to maintain the following arbitrary and revolting positions, namely:
that a set of rays conveying heat should all at once, in a certain
part of the spectrum, begin to give a small degree of light; that
this newly acquired power of illumination should increase while
the power of heating is on the decline; that when the illuminating
principle is come to a maximum it should in its turn also decline
very rapidly and vanish at the same time with the power of heating.
How can effects that are so opposite be ascribed to the same cause ?”

512-519 Argument founded upon the data contained in these four tables.
The general course of this argument is that, assuming the heat-
making rays and rays of light to be of the same nature, a ratio of
the efficacy of the invisible rays to that of the luminous rays de-
rived from one set of experimeuts is incompatible with the ratio
derived from any other set. Under the assumption that the heat-
making rays are essentially different from light rays, this incom-
patibility does not appear.

the Causes or Symptoms of its variable Emission of Light and Heat;
with Remarks on the Use that may possibly be drawn from Solar Obser-
vations. By WILLIAM HerRscHeL, LL. D., F. RS. Read April 16,
1801.

265-266 Reference to HERSCHEL’S view, given on a former occasion, that
the sun is amagnificent habitable globe; declaration that these more
recent observations support that view; and a statement as to the
importance of solar observations in their bearing upon the climate,
together with an opinion that such observations will enable us to
predict the character of a season.

267-268 Definitions of the terms, openings, shallows, ridges, nodules, corru-
gations, indentations, and pores.

269 Explanation of the form of the paper and the reasons for it.

270 OF OPENINGS. Openings are Places where the luminous Clouds of the Sun
are removed.

[Foot-note.] For a geometrical proof of the depression of openings
a reference to a paper by ALEXANDER WILSON, Phil. Trans., vol.
64.

271 Large Openings have generally Shallows about them. Many Openings are
without Shallows. Small Openings are generally without Shallows.
Openings have generally Ridges and Nodules about them.

272 Openings have a Tendency to run into each other. New Openings break out
near other Openings. Probable Cause of Openings.

273 Direction and Operation of the disturbing Cause.

274 Maxima of Openings.

275 There is some Difference in the colour of Openings. Openings divide when
they are decaying.

276 Decaying Openings sometimes increase again. When Openings are divided
they grow less and vanish. Decayed Openings sometimes become large
Indentations.

277 Decaying Openings turn sometimes into Pores. When Openings are van-
ished, they leave Disturbance behind.

278 Apparent View into the Openings, under luminous Ridges and Shallows.

Depth of the Openings indicuted by their Darkness.

279 Distance between the Shallows and solar Surface, indicated by the free
Motion of low Clouds.

230 Or SHALLOWS. Shallows are depressed below the general Surface of the
Sun; and are Places where the luminous solar Clouds of the upper [e-
gions are removed. The Thickness of the Shallows is visible.

281 Sometimes there are Shallows without Openings in them. Incipient Shallows
come from the Openings, or branch out from Shallows already formed,

and go forwards. Probable Cause of Shallows.

283 Shallows have no Corrugations, but are tufted. Decay of Shallows.

983 Or Ripces. Ridges are Elevations above the general Surface of the lu-
minous Clouds of the Sun.

284 Length of a Ridge. idges generally accompany Openings. Ridges are
also often in Plaees where theré are no Openings.

Itidges disperse very soon. Different Causes of Ridges hinted at.

Or NopuLeEs. Nodules are small, but highly elevated, luminous Places.
Nodules may be Ridges fore-shortened.

Or CORRUGATIONS. Corrugations consist of Elevations and Depressions.
Corrugations extend all over the Surface of the Sun.

Dispersed Ridges or Nodules make Corrugations. Corrugations change
their Shape and Situation ; they increase, diminish, divide, and vanish
quickly.

OF INDENTATIONS. The dark places of Corrugations are Indentations.

Indentations are without Openings. In some places the Indentations con-
tain small Openings. The Elevations and Indentations of Corrugations
are of different Figures. Indentations change to Openings.

Indentations are of the same Nature as Shallows. Indentations are low
Places, which often contain very small Openings. Indentations are of
different Sizes. Indentations are extended all over the Sun.

With low magnifying Powers, Indentations will appear like Points.

OF Pores. The low places of Indentations are Pores. Pores increase
sometimes, and become Openings. Pores vanish quickly.

OF THE REGIONS OF SOLAR CLOUDS.

Changes in the Solar Clouds happen continually.

There are two different Regions of Solar Clouds.

The inferior clouds are opaque,and probably not unlike those of our
Planet. :

Quantity of light reflected from the inferior Planetary Clouds.

Indentations are planetary Clouds, reflecting light through the open Parts
of the Corrugations. The opaque inferior Clouds probably suffer but
little of the light of the self-luminous superior Clouds to come to the Body
of the Sun. Motion of the inferior Clouds.

Motion of the superior Clouds.

Eminent Use of the planetary Clouds.

OF THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE. The Sun has a planetary Atmosphere. The
Sun’s planetary Atmosphere extends to a great Height. The planetary
Atmosphere of the Sun is of great Density.

The Solar Atmosphere, like ours, is subject to Agitations, such as with us
are occasioned by Winds. There is some clear Atmospheric Space, be-
tween the solid Body of the Sun and the lowest Region of the Clouds.

The Sun’s planetary Atmosphere is transparent.

THEORETICAL EXPLANATION OF THE SOLAR PHENOMENA.

GENERATION OF PORES.

Formation of Corrugations. Cause of Indentations.

Cause of the mottled Appearance of the Sun. Formation of small Open-
ings, Ridges, and Nodules. Production of large Openings and Shal-
lows.

SIGNS OF SCARCITY OF LUMINOUS MATTER IN THE SUN.

Visible Deficiency of empyreal Clouds. A perfect Calin in the upper Re-
giens of solar Clouds. Want of Openings, Ridges, and Nodules.

Many Indentations without, and others with, changeable Pores.

SIGNS OF ABUNDANCE OF LUMINOUS MATTER IN THE SUN.

Visible Increase of empyreal Clouds. Many Openings, Ridges, and No-
dules.

Coarse and luminous Corrugations.

310-318 A general discussion of the conclusions to be deduced from the
observations quoted in this paper. [To HerscuHetr it seemed that
the absence of Openings, Ridges, and Nodules, indicated ascare ity
of luminous matter in the sun, and, therefore, that the seasons
during which such conditions of the sun were recorded ought to be
of a lower temperature. He finds support for this view in the
higher price of, wheat during the five recorded periods of scarcity
of sun spots. ]

few Remarks to remove Objections that might be made against some of the
Arguments contained in the former Paper. By Wrti1aM Herscuet,
LL. D., F. R. S$. Read May 14, 1801.

354-355 Considerations as to the relations of the condition of the solar sur-
face and the weather.

355‘ Before I proceed, I must hint to those who may be willing to attend
to this subject, that I have a strong suspicion that one half of our
sun is less favorable to a copious emission of rays than the other;
and that its variable lustre may possibly appear to other solar sys-
tems, as irregular periodical stars are seen by us; but, whether this
arises from some permanent construction of the solar surface, or is

356 merely an accidental circumstance, must be lett to future investi-
gation: it should, however, be carefully attended to.”

213 [Ceres] is of very small size. [Foot-note.] Its real diameter is not
as great as three-eighths of our moon.

214 Magnitude of the new Stars. [Ceres and Pallas. ]

April 1, 1802. I placed a lucid disc at a considerable distance from

the eye and viewed with one eye the magnified star (seen with a
7-foot reflector) and the lucid dise with the other.

215 By this mens it appears that the real ‘diameter of Ceres is not above
0.40.

215 April 21. With a ten-foot reflector the same experiment gave 0”. 38.

217. April 22. For Ceres the diameter was 0.22. For Pallas 0/’.17and
0”.13.

918 The real diameters are, then, Ceres 161.6 miles, Pallas 147 miles.

219 Of Satellites. [Observations on this subject. ]

220 There is certainly no satellite to Ceres that can be seen with the 20-
foot reflector.

deep. Ceres is more ruddy than Pallas. Pallas is of a dusky whitish
color,

SYNOPSIS OF THE WRITINGS 0OF—Continued.

Of the Appearances of the new stars with regard to a Disk.

Ceres has a visible disk. Pallas’ disk I would rather call a nucleus.

Of the appearances of the new stars, with regard to an atmosphere or coma,

[ Observations ] probably no coma.

On the nature of the new Stars.

What are these new stars; are they planets or are they comets?

Planets defined (by 7 particular properties).

Our new stars cannot be called planets.

Comets defined (by 5 particular properties).

The new stars are not comets. They should be called Asteroids from
their resemblance to small stars.

Asteroids defined.

Statement of the reasons we have for expecting that additional aste-
roids may probably be soon found out.

I have already made five reviews of the zodiac without detectingyany
of these asteroids; their motion and not their appearance will be
the future means of detecting them.

We have reason to believe that a number of asteroids may remain con-
cealed.

Comets may become asteroids.

Additional observations relating to the appearances of the asteroids Ceres
and Pallas.

The coma of Ceres not much greater than that of stars of the same
magnitude. :

The fixed stars differ considerably in this respect among themselves.

The coma of Pallas not much more than for equal fixed stars.

Catalogue of 500 new Nebula, nebulous Stars, planetary nebulae and Clus-
ters of Stars; with Remarks on the construction of the Heavens. By
WILLIAM HERSCHEL, LL. D., F. R. S. Read July 1, 1802.

After a sufficient number of celestial objects is found, there is a neces-
sity for a scientific classification. The former classification was
only for the convenience of the observer.

ENUMERATION OF THE PARTS THAT ENTER INTO THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE HEAVENS.

I. Of Insulated Stars.

Notion of an insulated star—our sun is one.

The milky way consists of stars very differently scattered from those
which are immediately about us.

By analogy we may admit that every insulated star may be attended
with planets, etc. I should hesitate to extend this analogy to every
star in the heavens, and even think that probably we can only look
for solar systems among insulated stars.

Il. Of Binary Sidereal Systems or Double Stars.

Difference between a double and a binary star.

Difference between solar and sidereal systems.

No insulated stars of nearly an equal size and distance can appear
double to us.

Proof of this.

Casual situations will not account for the multiplied phenomena of
double stars, and their existence is owing to a general law of na-
ture—gravitation is that law.

I shall soon communicate a series of observations on double stars,
proving that many of them have already changed their situation with

tion round each other.

Our sun does not belong to such a system.

III. Of more complicated Sidereal Systems, or treble, quadruple, quintuple,
and multiple stars.

1802 92 487 Theorem as to the permanent connection of revolving stars, when the
forces acting on any one of them reduced to a direction as coming
from the empty centre are in the direct ratio of the distances from
that centre.

488-494 Hypothetical examples of such multiple stars.

494 Such combinations as I have mentioned are not the inventions of fancy ;
they have an actual existence; and, were it necessary, I could point
them out by thousands.

495 I do not imagine that I have pointed out the actual manner in which
they are held together, but only the possibilities of such unions.

495 IV. Of Clustering Stars and the Milky Way.

Marks of clustering in the milky way. Example of the stars between
fp and € Cygni.

496 ‘We may indeed partly ascribe the increase, both of brightness and
of apparent compression, to a greater depth of the space which con-
tains these stars; but this will equally tend to show their clustering
condition, for since the increase of brightness is gradual, the space
containing the clustering stars must tend to a spherical form if the
gradual increase of brightness is to be explained by the situation of
the stars.”

V. Of groups of Stars. Definition.

VII. Of Nebulw. Perhaps they are all to be resolved into the three

action of Mirrors. By WILLIAM HERSCHEL, LL. D., F. R. S. Read
February 10, 1803.

The observations were made (1802, Nov. 9) with a glass mirror of 7
feet focus and 6.3 inches aperture under favorable conditions, and
also with a 10-feet reflector. Eye-pieces made of dark-green glass
and others smoked on the side next the eye were used.

No ring about the planet; no distortion of the limbs of the sun or
Mercury at egress.

Mercury was perfectly spherical in figure.

Observations and experiments relating to the causes which often affect mir
rors, so as to prevent their showing objects distinctly.

The experience of many years will enable me to assign the principa
causes of disappointments in the use of mirrors.

The following observations have all been made with specula of un-
doubted goodness, so that every cause which impeded their proper
action was extrinsic.

Moisture in the air. Damp air is no enemy to vision.

Fogs.

Frost,

Hoar-Frost ; Dry-Air.

Northern-Lights ; Windy- Weather ; Fine in Appearance.

Over a Building; The Telescope lately brought out.

Confined Place; Haziness and Clouds.

Focal-length.

In order to see well with telescopes it is required that the tempera-
ture of the atmosphere and mirror should be uniform and the air
fraught with moisture.

All the preceding observations are accounted for by this principle.

Experiments [on the effects of change of focal length of a speculum. }
Heat applied back and front of a glass speculum lengthened the
focus.

With a metal mirror the focus became first shorter and then length-
ened.

In observing the sun similar effects may arise.

Perhaps these might be counteracted by an application of heat to
the back of the mirror or by an interception of it in front.

Account of the changes that have happened during the last Twenty-Five
Years in the Relative Situation of Double-Stars ; with an investigation of
the Cause to which they are owing. By WiLLIAM HERSCHEL, LL.D.,
F.R.S. Read June 9, 1803.

In Phil. Trans., 1302, p. 477, I have defined insulated stars. The dis-
covery of [Ceres and Pallas] has enlarged our knowledge of the
system of insulated stars.

I have already shown that two stars may revolve about their common
centre of gravity; and that it is probable there would be many
such binary systems among all the stars of the heavens. But
neither of these reasons is a proof of the actual existence of such
systems. I will here give an account of observations which will go
to prove that many of them are not merely double in appearance,
but are real binary combinations, intimately held together by the
bond of mutual attraction.

In Plate VII, Fig. 1, call the place of the sun, O, of the larger star
of a double star, a, of the smaller, x.

There are three motions to be considered of the bodies O, a, y; a moe
tion of one, of two, or of all three.

Single Motions. If ~ and O are at rest, a motion of y may be assumed
so as perfectly to explain any change of distance or of angle of
position of the two stars.

The effect of a motion of a or of O explained.

Double motions.

Motions of the three bodies.

[Observations] case of a Geminorum.

The distance has remained about constant for 234 years.

In a reflector the apparent diameter of a star depends upon: the
aperture with respect to the focal length; the distinctness of the
mirror; the magnifying power; the state of the atmosphere. By
contracting the aperture we can increase the apparent diameter;
want of distinctness does the same thing; an increase of magnify-
ing power increases the distance apart of two stars, but this in-
crease is not proportional to the increase of the power, and sooner
or later comes to a maximum; the state of the atmosphere is the
most material condition, as we cannot alter it.

The other three causes are at our disposal. I took ten different mir-
rors of 7 feet focus, 6.3 inches aperture, magnifying power 460.
With these, one after another, I viewed w Geminorum. With each
one the distance of the components was the same.

When double stars are first seen they appear nearer together than
later.

I have known it to take up two or three months before the eye was
sufficiently acquainted with the object to judge with the requisite
precision.

The error of this method of estimating the distance of these two stars
is not above 0/.34,

The angle of position of these stars was in 1779, 32° 47’ north-preced-
ing; it is now only 10° 53’. In 234 years it has diminished 21° 54’;
this change has been regular and gradual.

Accuracy of the angles of position investigated by the deviation of
separate measures from the mean.

This micrometer, then, will give the position of a double star true to
about 1° from 2 measures; in the worst circumstances the error
will not be 3°.

The cause of this change must be examined. A revolving star would
explain the alteration of the angle of position with no alteration of
the distance. As we have no precedent for, this it will be right to
examine whether the change cannot be accounted for by the proper
motions of the stars, or of the sun.

Single motions [examined }.

All are inconsistent with my observations.

The proper motion of the sun must be admitted in such a direction
and of such a velocity as will satisfy the mean direction and velocity
of the general proper motions of the stars.

Double Motion. This hypothesis is not maintainable.

Motion of the three Bodies. ‘This hypothesis will explain the observa-
tions, but in so complex a way as to leave no doubt that we should
give the preference [to the hypothesis of a revolution of the stars

themselves].

303 In my former paper (Phil. Trans., 1803, p. 339) I gave the changes in
the situation of six double stars.

353 I used the best observations I had of the position of Castor, but as
the proper motions of 36 principal stars published in the Green-
wich observations give the motion of this star different from what
I used, it will be necessary to review the arguments in the same
order as in the preceding paper.

358 [The former conclusions in regard to Castor are confirmed. |

359 In the further list of 50 double stars here given, 28 have undergone
only moderate changes, less than 10°. :

Thirteen have altered their situation above 10° but less than 20°; 3
stars have changed more than 20°; the six remaining have changed
between 30° and 130°.

40 Spurtous DIAMETERS OF CELESTIAL OBJECTS.

Observations and Experiments, with Remarks.

41 Withstars, the spurious diameters are larger than the real ones, which
are too small to be seen.

The spurious diameters of stars are of different sizes, and under the
same circumstances their dimensions are of a permanent nature.

The spurious diameters of the stars are differently coloured.

42 Their spurious diameters are lessened by increasing the magnifying
power, but in a much less ratio.

Magnifying power acts less on the large diameters and more on the
small ones. When the aperture of the telescope is lessened, it will
occasion an increase of the spurious diameters; but this increase is
not proportional to the diameters of the stars, acting more upon the

43 small spurious diameters and less upon the large ones. Very small
stars, however, lose their spurious diameters, and become nebu-
lous.

The spurious diameter of a star is reduced by haziness of the atmos-
phere. At a low altitude a star makes a spectrum, being coloured
by the prismatic power of the atmosphere.

With drops of quicksilver, the spurious disks were measured by means
of distant disks of known diameters upon which they were projected.
By covering the mirror with screens of different apertures, and also

52 by stopping out its center by circular screens of different size, it
was found that the sizes of the spurious disks were not determined
by the quantity of light reflected from the mirror, but rather by the

53 part.of the mirror used. Thus the inside rays of a mirror increase
the diameter of these disks, whereas the outside rays alone have a
greater effect in reducing it than they do when the inside rays are
left to join withthem. This affords a criterion as to whether a disk
is real or spurious.

62 There is a limit to the size of objects [4 second in HERSCHEL’s 10-foot
telescope] above which a mere increase in magnifying power will
betray the realdisk. By the criterion of the outside and inside rays,
an object of half this angular diameter may be shown to have real
dimensions, but below this value the telescope cannot distinguish
‘between a real and spurious diameter.

233 On the direction and velocity of the Motion of the Sun, and Solar System.
By WILLIAM HERSCHEL, LL. D., F.R.S. Read May 16, 1805.

233 Dr. MASKELYNE’S Table of the proper motions of 36 stars proves the
motions of the stars cf the first brightness, such as are probably in
our immediate neighborhood. The changes in position of minute
stars that I have ascertained prove that motions are equally carried
on in the remotest parts of space.

233 In 1783 I deduced from the proper motions of stars, with a high de-
gree of probability, a motion of the sun and solar system towards
A Herculis.

234 The present paper will treat [only] of the direction of the solar
motion.

234 Reasons for admitting a solar motion.

It may appear singular that I should again think it necessary to give
reasons for this. The cause is that {in 1783 I proposed to] take
away the various proper motions of stars by investing the sun with
a contrary one. Now, however, [I find that] the solar motion will
reveal so many concealed real motions that we shall have more of
them than would be necessary were the sun at rest. Hence the ne- ,
cessity for admitting the solar motion ought to be well established.

235 Theoretical considerations.

235 A view of the motions of moons around planets, and these again
round the sun, may suggest the motion of the latter round some
unknown centre. The solar motion was suggested by LAMBERT;
Dr. WILSON has shown its possibility from theoretical principles,
and DE LA LANDE its probability. The rotation of the sun indi-
cates a motion of translation; the cause of both is unknown.

236 The periodical stars should be examined with this idea. Conversely
stars that have a motion in space may be surmised to have also a
rotation on their axes.

1825 95 236 Symptoms of parallactic Motions.
Three sorts of motions explained by Fig. 1, Plate VII.

237 «©The parallactic, the real, and the apparent motions.

238 Since a motion of the sun will occasion parallactic motions of the
stars, these again must indicate a solar motion. To ascertain
whether parallactic motions exist we must choose the brightest
stars which are most affected by solar motion, they being probably
the nearest to the sun.

238 We distinguish parallactic from real motions by the direction of
the motion. If a solar motion exists all parallactic motions will be
opposite to it; real motions will be dispersed indiscriminately to
all parts of space.

239 The point towards which the sun moyes is the apex of solar motion;
the opposite point is the parallactic centre.

240 Table I. Ten positions of the solar apex from first magnitude stars.

241 Fifteen positions from fainter stars stated.

242 Changes in the position of double Stars. Among the 56 stars which I
have given, the changes of more than half appear to be [due to a
solar motion ].

242 Incongruity of proper Motions.

242 Sidereal occultation of a small Star.

As far as we can judge at present the vanishing of the small star near
6 Cygni is only a parallactic disappearance. A real motion would
also explain it.

244 Direction of the Solar Motion.

248 When we are in search of an apex for the solar motion, it ought to be
so fixed as to be equally favorable to every star. * * * Ouraim
should be to reduce the proper motions of the stars to their lowest
quantities.

249 Table II of the direction and quantity of the apparent motion of six
stars, supposing the sun to move towards 4 Herculis.

251 Table Iil of the angles of the parallactic motion with the parallel;
and Table IV, angles of the apparent with the parallactic motion.

252 Table V. Quantities and sum of the least real Motions.

253 Assuming the apex of solar motion to be in R. A. 270° 15’, N. P. D.
54° 45’, Table VI is computed: it is similar to Tables III, IV, V.

; 254 Assuming the apex R. A. 245° 52/ 30”, N. P. D. 40° 22’, Table VII

[like Table VI] is caleulated.

255 Although the great proper motions of Arcturus, Procyon, and Sirius
are strong indications of their being affected by parallax, it is not pro-
bable that their apparent changes are entirely due to solar motion.

256 Observation shows that proper motions do exist: we should choose
that apex which will take away more real motion than any other,
or we should put the apex in R. A. 245° 52’ 30’, N. P. D. 40° PPMP

HerscHeEL, LL. D., F. R. S. Read June 20, 1805.

272 [Brief account of the particularities of the system of Saturn. ]

272 There is a singularity left which distinguishes the figure of Saturn
from that of all the other planets. In 1776 I perceived that the

273 body of Saturn was not round. In 1781 I found it was flattened at
the poles more than Jupiter. In 1789 I measured the polar and
equatorial diameters, and prepossessed with the idea of its being
spheroidical I [paid no attention to other diameters ].

273 Observations on Saturn: [from 1805, April 12, to June 2] 1805, April
12. The ring is brighter than the body, and whiter.

274 April1s8. The figure of Saturn is different from the spheroidical figure
of Jupiter. The 4 points of greatest curvature are in latitude 46°

38’.
275 The shadow of the ring on the body is broader at the ends than in the
middle.

275 April19. The figure of Saturn is like a parallelogram with the tour
corners rounded off deeply. The latitude of the four points of
greatest curvature is 45° 44’.5.

276277, May 5-13. Saturn and Jupiter were viewed alternately [and the
preceding remarks confirmed ].

279 The real Saturn compared with the figure in Phil. Trans., 1790, p. 17.
The two did not agree. I then modified the latter and made them
agree. An exact copy is given in Plate IX.

205 On the Quantity and Velocity of the Solar Motion. By WitLiAM HER-
SCHEL, LL. D., F. R.S. Read February 27, 1806.

205 The direction of the solar motion was ascertained in a former paper:
the velocity is now in question.

205 The proper motions, reduced to one direction, have been called quan-
tities, to distinguish them from the velocities of the moving stars,
required to produce those motions. The same distinction must be
kept with respect to the velocity of the solar motion.

205 At a given distance, when the quantity of the solar-jotion is known,
its velocity is known, and every approximation towards a knowl-
edge of the distance of a star of the first magnitude will be one
toward a knowledge of the real solar velocity. It is otherwise with
a star, for the angle of the direction of its motion with the visual
ray is unknown.

206 I shall use the former six stars in the present paper.

206 Proportional distance of the Stars.

207 I propose the following arrangement: Table VIII, proportional Dis-
tances of Stars ; Sirius, 1.00; Arcturus, 1.20; Capella, 1.25; Lyra, 1.30;
Aldebaran and Procyon, 1.40.

208 I have tried all the known and many new ways of measuring the com-
parative light of the stars, and no one gives a satisfactory result.
When we have more authentic data, the calculation may be re-
peated.

208 Effect of the increase and decrease of the Solar Motion and Conditions to
be observed in the Investigation of its Quantity.

209 Table IX. In 6 columns: Stars; Apparent motion; Solar motion;
Parallactic motion; Real motion; Velocities.

210 It isnot the motions but the velocities which must be equalized.

211 It is assumed that their real motions are at right angles to the visual
ray. [The objection to this considered. ]

213 Calculations for drawing Figures that will represent the observed motions
of the Stars.

These are of two classes ; the first will remain unaltered whatsoever
the solar motion; the second must be adjusted to every change
[of solar motion ].
214 We must assume relative distances for ihe rest of our stars.

(2) Parallactie Motion; (3) Real Motion; (4) Parallactic Angle;
(5) Velocity.

224 TVigs. 5 and 6 illustrate Table XI.

224 Remarks that lead to a necessary examination of the Cause of the sidereal
Motions.

225 A motion of the stars may arise from mutual gravitation or from an
original projectile force. Both these causes act in the solar system.

925, The similar direction of the motion of a group of stars may be as-
cribed to their similar projectile motions.

227 Considerations of the attractive Power required for a sufficient Velocity of
the sidereal Motions.

The mere attraction of neighboring stars acting upon each other
cannot be the cause of proper motions. Sirius and the Sun from
that cause would approach yearly by less than 0/’.000000005 to an
eye at the distance of Sirius and supposing its parallax I

228 A centre of attraction must then be assumed, and original projectile

229 motions must be supposed.

2299 The centre of attraction may be one mass or a group.

230 Orit may be a union of groups; like two clusters 12° apart which
are near the line of the solay motion.

231 The Milky Way will furnish centres of attraction.

231 Independent of the solar motion, the action of distant centres of
attraction will be required to explain the proper motions of stars.
If the Sun be at rest Arcturus moves 2” a year; and this must be
due to a projectile motion and the attraction of far distant centers.

232 Determination of the Quantity of the Solar Motion. The rank assigned
to the solar motion is a perfect medium among the [36] sidereal
velocities [which have been considered. ]

233 The quantity of the solar motion is such that to an eye placed at right
angles to its direction, and at the distance from Sirius, it would be
annually 1/’.116992.

234 Concluding Remarks and Inferences. [Objections considered. ]

234 When a general knowledge of the proper motions of all the stars of
the 1st, 2d, and 3d magnitudes has been obtained, the present cal-
culation can be repeated*by the same methods.

235 The result of calculations founded on facts, such as we must admit
the proper motions of the stars to be, should give us useful infor-
mation, to satisfy the inquisitive mind or to lead us on to new dis-
coveries. The establishment of the solar motion answers both
these ends. Our inquiries should not terminate here. A paper on
general Gravitation [by Dr. WILSON] with what is said here, puts
us within reach of a link of the chain which connects the princi-
ples of the solar and sidereal motions with those which are the
cause of so many orbitual ones.

236 What has been said before of the Sun as an insulated star does not
contradict the present idea of its making one of a very extensive
system.

37 The insulation refers merely to a supposed binary combination with
some neighboring star.

455 Observations and Remarks on the Figure, the Climate, and the Atmosphere
of Saturn and its Ring. By WILLIAM HERSCHEL, LL. D., F. R.S.
Read June 26, 1806.

455-457 [Account of HERSCHEL’s observations on the figure of the ball. }
Plate XXI, Fig. 1, represents Satwrn in 1789, and Fig. 2, in 1805,
May 5.

458 To discover the flattening of the figure of the ball a high magni-
fying power (500) was necessary. A lower power will afterwards
show it. No error could arise from the defaleation of light May 5,
1805.

459-464 Observations of the figure of Saturn.

462 The flattening at the poles of Saturn is more extensive than on Jupiter.
The curvature in high latitudes is also greater. At the equator it
is rather less. Upon the whole the shape of the globe of Saturn is
not such as a rotatory motion alone could have given it.

462 1806, June 3. The shadow of the ring on the ball is broader at the
ends than in the middle.

463 The breadth of the ring is to the space between the ring and the ball
as about 5 to 4. The ring appears to be sloping towards the ball.

463 The shadow of the ball on the ring is not parallel with the outline of
Saturn.

464 Observations on the periodical changes of color of the polar regions of

Saturn. In the observations of Mars (Phil. Trans., 1784, p. 260) it
has been shown that a periodical change takes place in the extent
and brightness of the polar spots. I have suggested that this may
be due [to frozen regions at the poles, varying in size as they are
more or less exposed to the Sun. ]

The following observations may lead to similar conclusions with re-
spect to Saturn.

466 The gradual change of color of the polar region during a Saturnian
year seems to be in a great measure ascertained. This can only be
confirmed by a long series of observations.

466 On the atmosphere of Saturn.

From observations we may infer the existence of a Saturnian atmos-
phere.

467 A probability that the ring of Saturn has an atmosphere has been.

have an alternate reflection and transmission of them. If to get

over this objection it should be said that, instead of transmission,
we ought to substitute absorption; since those which in glass would
have been transmitted will be absorbed by the metal, we may ad-
mit the elusion; it ought, however, to have been made a part of the
hypothesis.”

97 226-228 XXXI. Alternate Fits of easy Reflection and easy Transmission, if
they exist, do not exert themselves according to various Thicknesses
of thin Plates of Air. One endof a plain strip of glass rested
upon a plain metalline murror, the other end being separated
from the mirror by a thin piece of paper. A lens resting upon
the strip of glass gave the primary set of rings, and the sec-
ondary set by transmission was seen reflected in the metalline
mirror. The rays which convey the secondary set of rings to
the eye must have passed through the thin wedge of air; but
they exhibited no modification, hence the conclusion.

228-229 XXXII. Alternate Fits of easy Reflection and easy Transmission, tf
they exist, do not exert themselves according to various Thicknesses
of thin Plates of Glass. An experiment similar to the preceding,
but using a slip of glass with sides not quite parallel.

sistance of any thin or thick Plates, either of Glass or of Air.

A perforated screen, at the center of curvature of a metal mirror,
transmitted a beam of sunlight to the mirror. When hair-powder
was strewn in the beam of light, coloured concentric circles were
seen about the hole in the screen.

regarded as proofs that the theory of Sir Isaac NEWTON is untenable.

Observations. (By the method described in Phil. Trans., 1805, p. 53.)

The visible disk of the comet is a real one.

Illumination of the Nucleus. The nucleus is round and of equal bright-
ness all over its disk. Its color is a little tinged with red.

Magnitude of the Nucleus. It appears larger at first sight than after
looking a long while.

I put a number of globules of sealing wax at a known distance and
viewed them during the day, and remembered their [apparent]
magnitudes. The nucleus was compared with these and must have
been larger than 2’’.47 and less than 2.77. It was less than the disk
of Jupiters satellite IIT.

Of the head of the Comet. [Definition of the head. ]

Of the Coma of the Comet. [Definition of the coma. ]

Of the tail of the Comet.

One side of the tail is very well defined; the other, hazy.

Of the Density of the Coma and Tail of the Comet.

I took notice of many small stars covered by the Coma and tail.
[The observations show that the interposition of the coma or tail
between a faint star and the eye, dimmed the star. ]

Nebulous appearance of the Comet.

Result of the foregoing Observations :

The real diameter of the nucleus was 538 miles.

I computed the phases of the comet (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, Plate IV,
p. 162) for two dates. Both phases appear to me sufficiently defal-
cated to prove that the comet did not shine by reflected sun-light
only.

If these remarks are well founded, we are authorized to conclude
that the body of the comet on its surface is self-luminous. Its
light is more like starlight than moonlight.

The tail and coma are sufficiently dense to obstruct the free passage of
starlight; they shine, not by reflection but by their own radiance.

If I had met the comet in one of my sweeps as it appeared between
Dec. 6 and Feb. 211 should have put it down as a nebula. Per-
haps my lists of nebulw, then, contain some comets.

Account of a new irregularity lately perceived in the apparent Figure of
the planet Saturn.

I have ascribed the flattening of the polar regions to the attraction
of thering. In pursuing my observations I perceived a new irregu-
larity in the figure [of the ball] which I am perfectly sure had no
existence the last time I examined the planet.

Observations [of the flattening in high latitudes] 1807, June 16, I per-
ceived it; it was independently drawn by my son, JOHN HERSCHEL.

Dr. WiLson, late of Glasgow, sent me a drawing containing the
same features made with one of my 7-foot reflectors at Hampstead.

This conclusion is derived from the observation that colours appear

of form in the glasses.

264-265 XL. Of the Production of colowred Appearances.

265 The colours contained in white light may be separated by reflection,
as well as by refraction. The production of the blue bow at the
limit of total reflection, as described by Sir Isaac NEWTON, is an
instance of this effect.

268 This consists of red, orange, yellow, and some green rays, the red
colour being very predominant. To see the red bow, an observer
should place himself in the open air, and, standing with his back
within a few feet of some wall or building, hold the sides of an
equilateral prism flat over his eyes, and look upwards to an altitude
of about 30° at the heavens.

272 If a right-angled prism be laid down on a sheet of white paper before

the blue bow, we may instantly transform it into red one by cover-
ing the side of the prism which is toward the incident light with a
slip of pasteboard.

The purpose for which such great abundance of nebulosity may ex-
ist deserves investigation.

Either greater depth or greater compression of the nebulous matter
may occasion greater brightness.

Condensation will best account for greater brightness.

The condensation of the nebulous matter ascribed to gravitation.

When a nebula has more than one preponderating seat of attracting
matter, it will probably in time be divided.

This conception is supported by the appearance of double nebule.

Their double appearance can be no deception.

Their nebulosity is derived from one common stock.

This opinion is supported by the remarkable situation of nebula.

Which may be seen in Mr. BopDE’s Atlas Celestis.

293-296 The real form of the nebulous matter of which nebule are com-

posed may be inferred from their figure.

The form of the nebulous matter of round nebule is globular.

This form is caused by gravitation.

The central brightness of nebule points out the seat of attraction.

The effect of attraction on the form of the nebulous matter depends
on its original expansion, on the time of the action, and on the
quantity of the attracting matter.

III different stages of condensation pointed out.

Comets may be highly condensed nebule.

Progressive condensation takes place.

Concentric brightness as well as globular form indicates the general
gravitation of the nebulous matter.

Progressive condensation may be seen in the formation of nuclei.

309-310 Nebulous matter is probably capable of being consolidated; the

act of shining proves it to have chemical properties.

It will stop light, and is partly opaque.

Queries relating to the subsidence of the nebulous matter, the zodiacal
light, and the cause of rotatory motion.

Somes part of the nebulous matter is probably elastic.

The uniform light of nuclei, and of much condensed nebulx, proves
that the nebulous matter is considerably opaque.

When the nebulous matter assumes hardness, the progress of conden-
sation will be impeded.

Three indications of the compression of the nebulous matier.

Planetary appearance arises from superficial lustre.

High degree of condensation of the nebulous matter.

A still higher degree of condensation.

In common good telescopes planetary nebulx cannot be distinguished
from stars.

Perhaps they may in the end be so condensed as actually to become
stars.

The nebulous matter in a cubical space of 10’ will admit of a con-
densation of two trillion and 208 thousand billion times before it
can go into the compass of a globe of the diameter of our sun.

Planetary nebule have a rotatory motion on their axes.

The original eccentricity of the nebulous matter of a nebula may be
the physical cause of the rotatory motion of celestial bodies.

The nebulous star in Orion is fictitious.

Two out of three nebulous stars in Orion have lost their former nebu-
lous appearance.

Their fictitious appearance was owing to a dispersion of their light
in passing through nebulous matter. ’
The faintest appearance of the nebulosity in Orion is perhaps not
further from us than the stars of the third or second magnitude;

the brightest part is therefore probably not so far.

In thirty-seven years the nebulosity of this nebula has undergone
great changes, and much greater since the time of HUYGHENS.

Nebulz are not permanent celestial bodies.

Additional proof of the opacity of the nebulous matter.

Very distant nebulosities which cannot be seen in a state of diffusion
may become visible when condensed into separate nebule.

Conversion of planetary into bright stellar nebul, into stars with
burs, or stars with haziness.

Conversion of more distant ones into faint stellar nebule, into stars
with burs or with faint chevelure.

When it is doubtful whether an object is a star or a nebula, it may
be verified by an increase of magnifying power.

When the object is very like a star it becomes difficult to ascertain
whether it is a star or a nebula.

When we cannot ascertain whether the doubtful object is a star or a
nebula, of which several instances are given, the similitude is as
great as any we can expect; for were it greater there could be no
doubt.

Observations of a Comet, with remarks on the Construction of its Different
Parts. By WitLtaM HERSCHEL, LL. D., F. R. 8. Read December
19, 1811. [This was Comet 1811, I.]

I have examined all the parts of the late comet with a scrutinizing
attention by telescopes of every degree of requisite light, distinct-
ness, and power. I have made so many observations that I shall
only give a selection of such as were made under the most favor-
able circumstances.

The Planetary Body in the Head of the Comet.

Where with the naked eye I saw a luminous appearance not unlike
a star, with a telescope I found that this spot, which some might
call a nucleus, was only the head of the comet.

Within its densest part was an extremely small bright point entirely
distinct from the surrounding glare. Its contour was certainly not
otherwise than round, yet I could but very seldom perceive it de-
finedly to be so.

I examined this point with various magnifiers on a 10-feet telescope.
With 169 it was about 1/’.39 in diameter.

With 600 it was between 1.06 and 0/.68. The sealing-wax globules
were viewed the morning after the observation as well as the morn-
ing before. [See Phil. Trans., 1808, p. 149. ]

The planetary body was eccentric in the head.

119 The color was of a pale ruddy tint like that of such equally small
stars as are inclined to red.

We may infer [from observations] that it was visible by rays emitted

The color in every one of my telescopes was greenish or bluish green.

121 The head was eccentric; it deviated towards the sun.

121 The Apparent and Real Magnitudes of the Head.

The real diameter of the head was about 127,000 miles.

122 A Transparent and Elastic Atmosphere about the Head.

I saw stars through it; it was thus transparent. Its elasticity may
be inferred from its circular form.

122 The extent of the Cometic Atmosphere.

It was more than 507,000 miles in diameter; its real extent far ex-
ceeds this.

122. The Bright Envelope of the Cometic Atmosphere.

123 The Figure, Color, and Magnitude of the Atmosphere.

Its shape was circular; it reached nearly half way round the head
of the comet, and divided into two streams, one on each side of
the head. The color had a strong yellowish cast. Its real diame-
ter must have exceeded 643,000 miles.

123 The Tail of the Comet. It was, Oct. 15, 233° long.

124 The greatest real length of the Tail.

It must have been upwards of 100,000,000 miles.

124 The Breadth of the Tail. It was, Oct. 12, nearly 15,000,000 miles.

125 The Curvature of the Tail.

This was subject to variations.

125 The general appearance of the Tail.

126 The tail had two branches. [See observations.] November 9 the
tail of the comet being near the Milky Way, the appearance of one
compared to the other was perfectly alike.

127 The return of the Comet to the Nebulous Appearance.

As the comet went further from the earth I had reason to suppose
that all the still visible phenomena of body, head, atmosphere,
envelope, and tail would soon be reduced to the semblance of a
common globular nebula. And this, not only from its increasing
distance but by the actual physical changes which I cbserved in
the construction of the comet.

The shortening of the Tail.

Increasing Darkness between the Streams that enclose the Tail.

Of the real construction of the Comet, and its various Parts.

The form of the planetary body containing the solid matter of the
comet is globular.

The transparent cometic atmosphere is also globular.

The envelope must have been an inverted hollow cone terminating
at its vertex in an equally hollow cap nearly hemispherical.

This hemispherical cap was comparatively thin.

The construction of the envelope explained.

The luminous matter as it arises from the envelope, of which it is a
continuation, is thrown a little outwards and assumes the appear-
ance of two diverging bright streams; but if the source from
which they rise be the circular rim of a hollow hemispherical shell
the luminous matter in its progress upwards can oniy form a hol-
low cone.

The feebler light of the tail between the streams is due to the thinness
of the matter in the middle of the hollow cone through which we look.

Of the Solar agency in the production of Cometic Phenomena.

As a comet approaches perihelion it is [more] exposed to the action
of the solar rays, which can produce light, heat, and chemical
effects. Their influence on this comet has produced an expansion.
The way these effects have been produced may be supposed to have
been as follows:

The matter in the head of the comet would be dilated by the action
of the sun, chiefly in that hemisphere of the head nearest the sun ;
and, being more increased in this direction than the other, it would
become eccentric when referred to the situation of the body of the
comet. The head being what draws our greatest attention, the
planetary body would appear eccentrically situated.

The nebulous matter which, when the comet is far from perihelion,
is probably spherical, would, near perihelion, be rarefied and rise
to a certain level. In this situation we have had an opportunity
of seeing the transparent atmosphere, which, but for the suspen-
sion of the nebulous matter, we might never have discovered.

The brilliancy and color of the envelope are proofs of the continued
action of the sun, and if we suppose the attenuation of the lumin-
ous matter, already very rare, to be carried on, its particles will
gradually recede from the hemisphere exposed to the sun and
ascend towards the region of the fixed stars. Some such operation
must have been carried on.

A whole hemisphere of it being exposed to the sun, it must ascend
equally everywhere all round this and become a hollow cone.

The luminous matter ascending in the hollow cone received no addi-
tion to its quantity from any other source but the exposed hemi-
sphere.

The tail, near the end, must have been rarefied in an extreme degree.

The vacancy occasioned by the escape of the nebulous matter was
probably filled up, either from the opposite hemisphere or by a ro-
tation of the comet about an axis.

That such a process took place seems to be supported by observation.

A rotatory motion of the comet would explain the variation in the
lengths of the two branches of the tail.

BIBLIOGRAPHY OF HERSCHEL’S WRITINGS.
SYNOPSIS OF THE WRITINGS OF—Continued.

Of the result of a Comet’s Perihelion Passage.

The quality of giving out light is immensely increased by an ap-
proach to the sun.

The act of shining denotes a decomposition in which at least light
(and perhaps many other elastic volatile substances) is given out.
I look upon a perihelion passage in some degree as an act of con-
solidation.

If this idea be admitted, may we not conclude that the consolidation
of the comet of 1807, when at perihelion, had already been carried
to a much higher degree than that of the present one, by some for-
mer approach to our sun, or to other similar celestial bodies, such
as we have reason to believe the fixed stars to be?

It is probable that comets may pass around other suns than ours.

Have we not reason to suppose that the comet of 1807 was compara-
tively a much older comet?

Should the idea of age be rejected, we may suppose that the comet of
1811 since the time of some former perihelion passage may have
acquired a quantity of ‘‘unperihelioned matter” by passing through
extensive strata of nebulosity.

I think it not unlikely that the matter of comets is originally nebu-
lous. It may possibly happen that highly condensed nebule may
be drawn towards the nearest celestial body of the nature of our
sun, and, after their first perihelion passage round it, proceed
towards some other similar body, and finally may come into the
regions of our sun, where at last we perceive them as comets.

The brilliant appearance of our comet may be ascribed either to its
having but lately emerged from a nebulous condition, or to its
having carried off some [foreign] nebulous matter. The first case
will lead us to conceive how planetary bodies may begin to have
an existence; the second how they may increase and grow up to
maturity.

WM. HERSCHEL.

[Dated] Slough, near Windsor, December 16, 1811.

Observations of a second Comet, with Remarks on its Construction. [Comet
1811, I1.] By WiLL1aAmM HerscHe., LL. D., F. R. S. Read March
12, 1812.

I call this the second comet; the other of this year the first.

The Body of the Comet.

The nucleus was 5/’.2744 in diameter.

The real diameter of its nucleus cannot be less than 2,637 miles.

The chevelure of the Comet.

The Tail of the Comet. Its length on January 20 must have been about
659,000 miles.

Remarks on the Construction of the Comet.

When the two comets are compared they are found to be extremely
different.

The light of the second comet is probably reflected from the sun.
The nucleus of the comet is surrounded by an elastic atmosphere,
which is transparent.

The little extent and extreme faintness of the tail might be ascribed
to the great perihelion distance of the comet if the comparative
view of the comets of 1807 and 1811 in my last paper did not prove

that the effect of the solar agency depends entirely upon the state
of the nebulous matter of which the comet is composed. This
second comet had probably but little unperihelioned matter.

If, then, the effect of the sun on comets is more or less conspicuous,
according to the amount of unperihelioned nebulous matter which
they contain, we may arrange these celestial bodies in a certain
order of consolidation, from which, in the end, a considerable in-
sight into their nature and destination may be obtained.

For example, the comet of this paper is of such a construction that,
it was but little more affected by its perihelion passage than a
planet would have been. It was in a very advanced state of con-
solidation.

That of 1807 was more affected, and, although considerably condensed,
conveyed a great quantity of nebulous matter to the perihelion
passage. That of 1811 contained, with little solidity, a most
abundant portion of nebulous matter.

Astronomical Observations relating to the Sidereal part of the Heavens and
its Connection with the Nebulous part; arranged for the purpose of a
critical examination. By WILLIAM HERSCHEL, LL. D.,F.R.S. Read
February 24, 1814.

In the memoir on the nebulous part of the heavens [ Phil. Trans,
1811] I have endeavored to show the probability of a very graduat
conversion of the nebulous matter into the sidereal appearance.
This paper refers to the sidereal part of the heavens.

I. Of stars in remarkable situations in regard to Nebule.

Surmise that nebulze may have considerable proper motions. Neces-
sity of caution in such conclusions. Five stars in such situations.

II. Of two stars with nebulosity between them.

19 instances of such connection are given; in the memoir of 1811, 13S
double nebulez joined by nebulosity were noted.

Should we not surmise that possibly these stars had formerly been
highly condensed nebula like those that had been mentioned, and
were now by gradually increasing condensation turned into small
stars; and may not the nebulosity still remaining show their neb-
ulous origin? Also as we have over 700 double stars free from neb-
ulosity, many of which are probably at no great real distance from
us, 1t seems as if we might have these double objects in three differ-
ent successive conditions. First, as nebula; next as stars with re-
maining nebulosity; and lastly, as stars completely free from neb-
ulous appearance.

IIL. Of stars with nebulosity of various shapes attached to them.

Fourteen such objects noted.

Now, if we admit a contact between these nebulw and the stars, it
deserves to be remarked that stars in the situation of these four-
teen cannot have been formed from their adjoining nebulosities;
for a gradual condensation of the nebulous matter would have been
central; whereas the stars are at the extremity of the nebulae.
Their connection is then due to some motion either of the star or of
the nebulex. If the nebulosity should subside into the star, it
would give an idea of the growth of a star.

IV. Of stars with nebulous branches.

Three cases noted of a connection between stars and nebula, and ref-
erence made to Phil. Trans., 1811, pp. 301-311, for further examples,

The idea of a nebula with a nucleus which gradually assumed the
lustre of a star is more probabie than the fortuitous central meet-
ing of a star and nebula.

V. Of nebulous stars.

Thirteen are noted—see also Phil. Trans., 1791, p. 71.

Nebulous stars are not only connected with a nebulosity, which, from
its great regularity, might be taken for an atmosphere, but also
with the luminous appearances belonging to the nebulous matter
which is so widely expanded in various regions of the heavens.

What has been said of the gradual condensation of the nebulous
matter in the case of extended nebul, is supported by a much
greater number of nebulosities inaspherical form. [See Phil. Trans.,
1811, pp. 391-8.] 322 cases are there mentioned, in which the fact
of the gradual condensation is rendered so evident as not to admit
of a doubt.

Nebulous stars only differ from round nebule containing a nucleus
in the degree of condensation.

VI. Of Stars connected with extensive windings of nebulosity.

Three cases noted. The nebulosity which has been shown to be con-
nected with stars, may be fully proved to be of the same nature as the
general mass of nebulous matter.

Stars of this class are in a condition of growth.

Possibility that stars were originally formed by a condensation of the
nebulous matter.

We may conceive both the generation and growth of stars to be the
legitimate effects of the law of gravitation, to which the nebulous
matter is proved by observation to be subject.

VII. Of small patches consisting of Stars mixed with nebulosity.

Thirty-seven cases noted.

The connection may be only apparent—admitting it to be real:

Ist, it may happen that the nebulosity still mixed with the stars is
some remaining unsubsided part of that from which they were
formed; or, 2d, the union of stars and nebulosity may have been
affected by the motion of either the stars or the nebulosity.

Such motions do take place. Nebul are subject to great changes in
their appearance, as the nebula of Orion. [Phil. Trans., 1811, p.
320. |

Every nebulosity which is carried into the region of a small patch of
stars will probably be gradually arrested and absorbed by them,
and the growth of stars thus continued.

VIII. Of objects of an ambiguous construction.

Clusters of stars at a great distance may assume a nebulous appear-
ance. [Phil. Trans., 1811, p. 270.]

Telescopes of gradually increasing space-penetrating powers show
certain objects successively as nebulz, mixtures of nebulosity and
stars, and as true clusters; other objects, so viewed, increase in
brightness, and the nebulosity becomes more uniformly united and
of a milky appearance, and these are purely nebulous.

Definition of ambiguous objects, their classification and examples.
Seventy-one such noted in four classes.

Class 1. Seven objects, which may be supposed to consist of stars, but

round figure of these show them to be globular. They must either
be in a condensed state purely nebulous, or else, if consisting of
stars, they mvst be in an advanced order of compression, and only
appear nebulous on account of their very great distance from us.

A middle state between the progressive condensation of a globular
nebula and a cluster of stars can have no existence, because a glob-
ular nebulosity when condensed can only produce a single star. A
globular cluster may, however, intercept a mass of nebulous matter,
in motion, in which case the nebulosity must soon assume the form
of the cluster, and will finally be absorbed by it.

Class 3. Twenty-six easily resolvable objects.

Class 4. Twelve objects, probably clusters.

IX. Of the sidereal part of the Heavens.

Intimate connection between the nebulous and sidereal condition.

Stars of first magnitude. [See Phil. Trans., 1785, p. 68.]

Prismatic analysis of the light of Sirius, a Orionis, Procyon, Arcturus
Aldebaran and a Lyre.

X. Of the aggregation of stars.

Star-gauges prove that the stars are not equally distributed over the
celestial regions. [See Phil. Trans., 1785.]

Forming clusters. This tendency to clustering is chiefly visible in
places extremely rich in stars. Its greatest effects will then be in
and near the milky way.

The twenty objects referred to are not given as instances of the actual
formation of clusters, but merely to draw attention to a seemingly
aggregating arrangement. Fifteen of these are in the milky way
and five are near it.

XI. Of irregular clusters.

Clusters in very rich parts of the heavens are generally of irregular
form and imperfectly collected. One hundred and twelve such ob-
jects are referred to; eighty of size not noted, fifty-three of these in
the milky way, eighteen near it, nine at a distance from it. Also
thirty-two irregular clusters from 2’ to 30/ in diameter; of these
twenty-two are in the milky way and ten near it.

The great number of clusters in these two collections is not only an
indication that they owe their origin to a clustering power residing
in the centre; but the still remaining irregularity of their arrange-
ment additionally proves that the action of the clustering power
has not been exerted long enough to produce a more artificial con-
struction.

XII. Of clusters variously extended and compressed.

Fifteen extended clusters named; twelve in the milky way, three
near it. Their descriptions show that the power which has drawn
the stars together has acted under different circumstances in the
several cases.

XIII. Of clusters of stars of a peculiar description,

Six such objects named: one in the milky way, three near it, two at
a distance from it.

XIV. Of differently compressed clusters of stars.

I have hitherto only considered the arrangement of stars in clusters
with a view to point out whether they are drawn together by a
clustering power in the same manner as the nebulous matter has

been proved to be condensed by a gravitating principle; but in the
forty-one clusters of the following two collections we shall see that
it is one and the same power uniformly exerted which first con-
densed nebulous matter into stars and afterwards draws them to-
gether into clusters, and which, by a continuance of its action,
gradually increases the compression of the stars which form the
clusters. The first collection has thirty-three considerably com-
pressed clusters, seventeen in the milky way, fifteen near it, and
one at a distance. The second collection contains eight clusters,
highly compressed, five in the milky way, two near it, and one at a
distance.

1814 104 272 XV. Of the gradual concentration and insulation of clusters of stars.

The existence of a clustering power is nowhere so visibly pointed out

as in the thirty-nine clusters given in the following collection:
Twenty-one of these are in the milky way, seven near it, and eleven
at a distance.

273 XVI. Of globular clusters of stars.
Fourteen such objects noted: One in the milky way, four near it, and

nine at a distance from it.

274-7 [Detailed accounts from observing books of M. 72; M.2; M.5; M.

56; M. 80; M. 13; M.3; M. 15; M.79; M. 19; M. 53.]

278 XVII. Of more distant globular clusters of stars.
The following eleven objects are so like those of the foregoing col-

lection that I have called them miniatures of the former. Five of
these are in the milky way, one near it, and five at a distance. De-
tailed descriptions given.

279 Ihave supposed the clusters of this class to be at a greater distance

from us than those of the preceding collection, because the stars of
which they are composed are more minute than those of the clusters
of which I have called them miniatures; their compression is also
closer, and the size of the whole is much contracted, all of which
particulars are readily explained by admitting them to be more dis-
tant. This argument, however, does not extend so far as to exclude
a real difference which there may be in different clusters, not only
in the size, but also in the number and arrangement of the stars.

XVIII. Of still more distant globular clusters of stars.
980 It has frequently happened that I saw three objects in succession, the

first of which was a brilliant globular cluster of stars, the second
a miniature of the former in which the stars could just be perceived,
and the third in every respect a similar miniature of the second, as
the second was of the first, but in which the stars, though suspected,
were no longer to be distinguished. Five such objects given, all in
the milky way.

XIX. Of a recurrence of the ambiguous limit of observation.
281 It has already been shown [VII], p. 259] that in passing from faint

nebulosity to the suspected sidereal condition we cannot avoid meet-
ing with ambiguous objects, and the same critical situation will
again occur, when, from the distinctly sidereal appearance, we en-
deavor to penetrate gradually further into space.

The effects of clustering power have been gradually traced from the

first indication of clustering stars through irregular as well as
through more artificially arranged clusters up to the beautiful
globular form.

The extended views I have taken in this and in my former papers of
the various parts that enter into the construction of the heavens
have prepared the way for a final investigation of the universal
arrangement of all these celestial bodiesin space. The scale is still
wanting by which distances are to be measured,

XX. Of the breaking up of the Milky Way.

Its whitish tinge has been proved by star-gauges to arise from ac-
cumulated stars. It does not now consist of equally scattered stars.

One hundred and fifty-seven instances have been given of clusters
situated within the milky way. Sixty-eight more are in the bor-
ders. Now, since the stars of the milky way are permanently ex-
posed to the action of a power whereby they are irresistibly
drawn into groups, we may be certain that from mere clustering
stars they will be gradually compressed through successive stages
of accumulation till they come up to what may be called the ripen-
ing period of the globular form, and total insulation; from which
it is evident that the milky way must be finally broken up and
cease to be a stratum of scattered stars.

The state into which the incessant action of the clustering power has
brought it at present is a kind of chronometer that may be used to
measure the time of its past and future existence ; and although we
do not know the rate of going of this mysterious chronometer, it is
nevertheless certain that since the breaking up of the milky way
affords a proof that it cannot last forever, it equally bears witness
that its past duration cannot be admitted to be infinite.

A series of observations of the satellites of the Georgian planet, including
a passage through the node of their orbits ; with an introductory account
of the telescopic apparatus that has been used on this occasion ; and a
final exposition of some calculated particulars deduced from the observa-
tions. By WILLIAM HerscHetL, LL. D., F. R.S. Read June 8, 1815.

A telescope suitable to examine these faint objects must possess the
double power of magnifying and penetrating into space.

The effective magnifying power defined.

A 10-foot reflector, even with its highest powers, will not show these
objects.

The machinery of my 20-foot telescope is so complete that I have
been able to take up the planet at an early hour in the evening and
to follow it for 7, 8, or 9 hours successively. The 40-foot telescope
has not been always used because time is required for preparations.
The temperature is often too changeable; its use requires 2 work-
men, beside the assistant at the clock and writing-desk.

The 20-foot can be pointed on the planet with everything adjusted
in 10 minutes.

It has constantly been a rule with me not to observe with a larger
instrument when a smaller would answer.

SYNOPSIS OF THE WRITINGS 0OF—Continued.

I have two mirrors for the 20-foot always ready, and my observations
are never interrupted by accidents, which often happen to large
mirrors, such as greatly injure their polish.

In these delicate observations no double eye-glass should be used, as
we have a waste of light at four surfaces instead of two.

The hole through which the rays pass to the eye should be much
larger than the diameter of the optic pencils and considerably
nearer the glass than their focus, for the eye ought on no account
to touch the eye-piece.

With regard to the eye-glasses when merely the object of saving
light is considered, I can say from experience that concaves have
greatly the advantages of convexes, and they give also a mucb
more distinct image. This fact I established by repeated experi
ments about 1776. For the cause of the superior brightness ana
sharpness of the image which is given by concaves we must prob-
ably look to the circumstance of their not permitting the reflected
rays to come to a focus. Perhaps a certain mechanical effect, in-
jurious to distinctness, takes place at the focal crossing of rays in
convex lenses.

[Foot-note.] [An experiment to test this described. It was incon-
clusive. ]

The satellites were discovered with a magnifying power of 157
only.

Magnifiers of 300, 460, 600, and 800 have been used, according to the
conditions of the mirror, atmosphere, ete. On particular occasions
1,200 was used, and 2,400, 3,600, and 7,200 have been used to seruti-
nize the closest neighborhood of the planet. The known satellites
began to be nebulous with these powers.

In the following observations the positions of the satellites have been
determined in 3 ways: Coarse estimations, aided by diagrams ;
more careful ones, aided by a wire in the focus of the eye-glass;
and micrometer measures.

Distances were more difficult to measure than angles of position.

The following observations are given in the order of the time they
were made. They contain everything that relates to the two
large satellites and to the researches for detecting additional satel-
lites.

That such there are I have no doubt.

After each observation is given an ‘‘identification” which shows by
computation the places of the known satellites.

The configurations made at the time of observation are not given.
They generally contained the planet, its satellites and some of the
neighboring stars, especially those that were in the path of the
planet.

Observations of the satellites of the Georgian planet, accompanied by a the-
oretical determination of their situation, whereby their identity may be
ascertained. {From 1787, Jan. 11, to 1810, May 25.]

fect.

Investigation of several particulars deduced from the foregoing observations,

Consideration of the principles by which the periodical revolution of the
satellites may be obtained from the observed angles of position.

The periodical revolutions of the satellites determined.

The first satellite [ Titania] makes a synodical revolution in 84 16 56™
5.28 and the second [ Oberon] in 134 115 8™ 59s,

Explanation of the identifying method.

I. With the light of my 20-foot telescope the first satellite generally
becomes invisible at a distance of [18/’] from the planet; and

II. The second at about [24].

III. An interior satellite cannot be seen two nights in succession.

IV. Exterior satellites that are very faint when at their greatest
elongation can hardly ever be seen at any other time when the
orbits are contracted.

V. [Titania] is probably larger than [ Oberon ].

VI. Both are subject to great variations of light [not owing to the
changeable clearness of the air].

VII. This may be due to a rotation on their axes, or from atmos-
pheres.

VIII. I have supposed the distances of the first and second satellites
to be 36” and 48” respectively.

Astronomical Observations and Experiments tending to investigate the local
Arrangement of the Celestial Bodies in Space and to determine the Extent
and Condition of the Milky Way. By Sir WrttiAM HeErscuetL, Knt.
Guelp., LL. D., F. R. S. Read June 19, 1817.

The construction of the heavens can only be known when we have
the situation of each body defined by its three dimensions. Of
these three the ordinary catalogues give but two, leaving the dis-
tance or profundity undetermined.

The method of parallaxes has given the distance of the sun, planets,
etc. The parallax of the stars has also received attention. With
regard to more distant objects, as small stars, compressed clusters,
and nebula, these methods can give us no assistance.

I. Of the local situation of the stars of the Heavens.

It is evident that we cannot mean to affirm that the stars of the fifth,
sixth, and seventh magnitudes are really smaller than those of the
first, second, or third, and that we must ascribe the cause of the
difference in the apparent magnitudes of the stars to a difference in
their relative distances from us. On account of the great number
of stars in each class we must also allow that the stars of each suc-
ceeding magnitude beginning with the first, are, one with another,
further from us than those of the magnitude immediately preceding.
The relative magnitudes give only relative distances, and can afford
no information as to the real distances at which the stars are placed.

Il. Of a standard by which the relative arrangement of the stars may be
examined.

A standard of reference for the arrangement of the stars may be had

by comparing their distribution to a certain properly modified
equality of scattering. The equality which I propose does not re-

1817 107 305 quire that the stars should be at equal distances from each other,
nor is it necessary that all those of the same nominal magnitude
should be equally distant from us.

305 It consists in allotting a certain equal portion of space to every star,
in consequence of which we may calculate how many stars any
given extent of space may contain.

This arrangement is explained by means of a figure. Plate XV,
Fig. 1.
306 III. Comparison of the order of magnitudes with the order of distances.
Comparison of the order of distances by the foregoing scheme with
the magnitudes assigned in Bopr’s catalogue of 14,144 stars.

308 The result of this comparison is, that if the order of magnitudes
could indicate the distance of the stars, it would denote at first a
gradual, and afterwards a very abrupt, condensation of them; but
that, considering the principle on which the stars are classed, their
arrangement into magnitudes can only apply to certain relative
distances, and show that, taking the stars of each class, one with
another, those of the succeeding magnitudes are farther from us
than the stars of the preceding order.

308 IV. Of a criterion for ascertaining the profundity or local situation of
celestial objects in space.

309 It will be admitted that those stars, the light of which we can ex-

perimentally prove to be 4, $, qs------ of the light of any certain
star of the first magnitude must be 2, 3, 4.----. times as far from

us as the standard star, provided the condition of the stars should
come up to the supposed mean state of diameter and lustre of the
standard star. i

309 V. Of the equalization of star light.

309 Star gauging gave rise to an investigation of the space-penetrating
power of telescopes.

310 Finding that this might be calculated with reference to the extent of
the same power of which the unassisted eye was capable, there
always remained a desideratum of some sure method by which this
last might be ascertained.

etc., etc.

We shall be able to say that a distant celestial object is so far from
us, provided the stars of which it is composed are of a size and
lustre equal to the size and lustre of such stars as Sirius, Arcturus,
ete.

321 The stars of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth order of distances are

not only more compressed than those in the neighborhood of the
sun, but, moreover, their compression in different parts of the
heavens must be very unequal.

IX. Of the construction and extent of the milky way.

322 General description of it.

The sun is within its plane, for to an observer in latitude 60°, when
at 100° R. A. the milky way is in the east, it will at the same time
be in the west at 280°; while in its meridional situation it will pass
through Cassiopeia in the Zenith and through the constellation of
the Cross in the Nadir.

3238-4 Examination of the cluster in the Sword Handle of Perseus, with
various space-penetrating powers.

325 [Beside the 863 gauges published in Phil. Trans., 1785, p. 221, above
400 more have been taken in various parts of the heavens and are
not published. ]

326 The twenty-foot telescope cannot fathom the profundity of the milky
way.

326 If the stars of the 5th, 6th, and 7th magnitudes cannot be supposed
to be gradually of a smaller physical size and brightness than those
of the 1st, 2d, and 3d, how much less can a supposition be admitted
that would require that the stars which, by a long series of gauging
powers, have been proved to make their gradual telescopic appear-
ance should also be gradually of a different construction with re-
gard to physical size and brightness from those which we see with
the naked eye?

327 The telescopic breadth of the milky way considerably exceeds the
extent which, in our maps, is assigned to it.

398-30 Observations—sweeps—which confirm this.

330 X. Concluding Remarks.

What has been said of the extent and condition of the milky way in
my papers on the construction of the heavens, with the addition of
this attempt to give a more correct idea of its profundity in space,
will contain nearly all the general knowledge we can ever have of
this magnificent collection of stars.

331 Our sun with all the stars we can see with the eye are deeply im-
mersed in the milky way, and form a component part of it.

429 Astronomical observations and experiments, selected for the purpose of aa-
certaining the relative distances of clusters of stars, and of investigating
how far the power of our telescopes may be expected to reach into space
when directed to ambiguous celestial objects. By Sir WILLIAM HER-
SCHEL, Knt. Guelp., LL. D., F. R. S. Read June 11, 1818.

429 The method of equalization of star light will show the relative dis-
tances of stars; from this a method was explained in Phil. Trans.,
1817, by which means the profundity in space of every object con-
sisting of stars can be ascertained as far as the light of the telescope

Ill. Of a method to represent the profundity of celestial objects in space by
a diagram.

Fig. 1, Plate xxi, represents such a method applied to the foregoing
objects.

IV. Of ambiguous celestial objects.

An object is often ambiguous when viewed with insufficient optical
means, and its nature may be known by increasing this means.
Objects ambiguous to the naked eye become known with the 20-foot
telescope, and so on.

V. The milky way, at the profundity beyond which the gauging powers of
our instruments cannot reach, is not an ambiguous object.

We may conclude that when our gauges will no longer resolve the
milky way into stars it is not because it is ambiguous, but because
it is fathomless.

VI. Of the assumed semblance of clusters of stars when seen through tel-
escopes that have not light and power sufficient to show their nature and
construction.

Observations of various clusters in telescopes of various sizes.

Two different principles, the nebulous and the sidereal, have been ob-
served in the celestial spaces.

Distinguishing characteristics of each.

Tt seems highly probable that some of the cometic, many of the
planetary, and a considerable number of the stellar nebulz, are
clusters of stars in disguise.

VII. Of the extent of the power of our telescopes to reach into space when
they are directed to ambiguous celestial objects.

The method of equalizing the light of stars may be applied so as to
give an estimate of the extent of this power.

When the united light of a cluster of stars is visible to the [naked]
eye, there will be a certain maximum of distance to which the
same cluster might be removed, so as still to remain visible in a
telescope of a given space-penetrating power; and if the distance
of the cluster can be ascertained by the gauging power of any in-
strument, that will just show the stars of it, the order of the pro-
fundity at which this cluster could still be seen as an ambiguous
object may be ascertained by the space-penetrating power of the
telescope through which it is observed.

REPORTS OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORIES,

In the latter part of the year 1880 the following circular was sent to
all known observatories in America and to a number of foreign estab-
lishments :

[ Cireular. |

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, D. C.

My DEAR Sir: It is desired to present in the annual report of this
institution a yearly summary of the state and progress of astronomy in
the United States and elsewhere. To this end it is requested that the
directors of observatories, public and private, will return this circular,
with the blanks filled out, and with such additional information as they
may deem suitable for publication.

It is intended that one such circular shall reach every observatory,
public or private, in the United States; if any have been omitted it has
been by inadvertence, and notice of such omissions is desired by the
editor (Prof. EDWARD S. HOLDEN, U.S. Naval Observatory, Washing-
ton, D. C.).

It is proposed to continue the summaries in the future, and it is hoped
that the directors of the various institutions will desire to furnish from
year to year brief sketches of the activity of the observatories under
their charge. In this way a record of current astronomical work will
be kept up, which otherwise it is difficult to maintain in the absence of
any American periodical specially devoted to astronomy.

Very truly yours,
SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution.
To ———- ———.

The information asked for embraced: I. The Personnel: I. The In-
struments employed: (a) Meridian circles; (>) (b’) Meridian transit in-
struments; (c) (c’) Equatorial instruments; (d) Spectroscopes ; (e) Pho-
tomers and other subsidiary apparatus; (f) Chronographs; (g) Clocks;
(h) Chronometers; (i) Miscellaneous instruments : III. The character of
observations made or contemplated.

Replies to this circular received up to March 15, 1851, are given be-
low, in two classes: Reports of American observatories, and reports of
Foreign observatories. Additional information ‘of a statistical nature
has been obtained from an article in the Annuaire de lV Observatoire
Royale de Bruxelles, 1881; which has been translated by Miss Lockwood.

In the absence of Professor Holden (at the Washburn Observatory,
Wisconsin) Mr. George H. Boehmer, of the Institution, has attended to

the arrangement and editing of these Notices. bes

eters. By lengthening the eye-tube as described in DICK’S * Practical
Astronomer” this power can be about doubled.
(g) Clocks: A good watch, and clock of ordinary construction.
OBSERVATIONS DURING THE PAST YEAR (from October, 1879, to
March, 1881):

Observations of sun-spots ; keeping a daily map of the sun, on which
the positions and number of spots are denoted ; a weather record kept
in connection with observations of sun-spots; also, observatious of the
principal planets and the moon to detect physical changes; also, observa-
tions of nebule and star-clusters, and of double stars, for color. Atten-
tion has been given to making naked-eye estimates of the comparative
brillianey of the larger stars. As the result of a great many observa-
tions it is found that Arcturus slightly exceeds Capella, and that Vega
is considerably inferior to both those named. This winter, for the first
time, Rigel has seemed slightly superior to Betelquese.

WORK PROPOSED FOR THE COMING YEAR (1881):

Continuation of sun-spot observations in connection with a weather
record; observations of the moon, planets, Wc.

Many editorial paragraphs and other articles on astronomical subjects

in the New York Sun.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION :

Since January 1, 1881, a daily record has been kept of the sunset
colors and their intensity, on the supposition that such a record may
possibly have some value for meteorological purposes. A record has
also been kept of meteors and other celestial phenomena,

The observations during the year comprise about 800 micrometrical
measures of previously-known double stars, and the discovery of about
70 new pairs, the most of which have been measured on three or four
different nights each. A number of prominent naked-eye stars, some
of which are mentioned in the contributions to astronomical periodicals,
are included in the list of new stars. Careful series of measures of many
of the most difficult of the binary systems have been made, and partiec-
ularly those requiring a large aperture from the extreme closeness of the

components, or the faintness of the companion star.

During February and March, 1880, the old observatory building, which
stood a few feet west of the main university edifice, was moved and en-
larged. It nowstands on the beautiful eminence in the campus near the
chalybeate spring. The meridian line of each pier now passes between
the university building and the president’s mansion. In this position a
good horizon is secured. In the old position the horizon was obstructed
on the north by the scientific building, and on the east by the university
building.

The old dome was found to be too small for the equatorial recently pur-
chased, and a brick addition was made at the east end for the accom-
modation of this instrument. The whole building is 63 feet long from
east to west, and fronts east.

The present greatly improved condition of the Observatory is due to
the liberality of the president, Dr. S. S. Laws, who, for the advance-
ment of astronomical science, has given to the university more than
$2,000 in order to procure the telescope and put it in complete working
order, and to move and enlarge the observatory building.

OBSERVATIONS DURING THE PAST YEAR (from January 1, 1880,
to January 1, 1831):

No change in the personnel nor addition to the scant equipment of
this station, which can hardly be called an observatory, has been made
since last report.

Sun-spot observations have been continued throughout the past year,
and many spots have been recorded. The new variable star - Cephei has
been observed a few times, and the space between 3 Polaris and ¢« Cas-
siopeie was frequently searched for other variables. In the course of
hap-hazard searches for comets, two nebule were found, which may pos-
sibly be variable, since they are not given on charts and lists containing
much fainter ones not visible at all with my highest magnifying power
of 50 times. One of these nebulie is located in approximate R. A. 21”
21™ Dec. + 11° 50’, the other in R. A. 16" 15™ Dec. — 1° 22’, as esti-
mated by the eye (unaided by position circles) from neighboring stars.

Preparations had been made to observe the occultation of the planet
Mars occurring here in the afternoon of March 17, but that day having
been cloudy here, the observation could not be made. On the 10th of
March at 4" 20™ p. m., after having found that planet with his small
transit, and knowing its exact position, viz: Az. 8S. 60° E., Alt. 57° 18/,
the director, his wife, and two of lis children could distinctly see it with
the naked eye in broad daylight.

Many meteors and several extensive zodiacal lights and two very fine
auroral displays have been recorded.

During December, 1880, and January, 18381, many extraordinary
parheliz and lunar halos, and on several occasions similar phenomena
produced by the planet Venus, also have been observed here.

Nothing beyond short notices in our local newspapers and an occasional
article in the Fort Dodge Messenger on current astronomical events of
general interest has been published by me during the past year.

The work laid out for the present year consists in a continuation of
the former miscellaneous observations and the special observations of
the local times of the following phenomena:

1. Beginning of the partial eclipse of the sun, May 27, 1881.

2. The various phases of the total eclipse of the moon, June 11, in-

WORK PROPOSED FOR THE COMING YEAR (1881):

The equatorial, with Messrs. HOLDEN & BURNHAM as observers, will
begin a series of zone observations on the plan of HERSCHEL’S sweeps.
The 3-inch transit will be used by Mr. Comsrock for time observations,
and Polaris and the Sun will be observed at every culmination with
time stars.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

It is hoped to commence the printing of the publications of the Wash-
burn Observatory during the year. No.1 will be a description of the
Observatory and its history up to January 1, 1881, together with the
Reduction Tables prepared by the late director, Professor WATSON.
No. II will contain Burnham’s General Catalogue of Double Stars. No.
lof the Contributions has already been printed, and contains a list of
new nebulz and double stars.

WORK PROPOSED FOR THE COMING YEAR (1881):

Erection of small Observatory to accommodate the DRAPER 12-inch
equatorial (CLARK & Sons) and time instruments (FAUTH). These are
to be set up by Professors E. 8S. HOLDEN and 8S. W. BURNHAM in Octo-
ber, and used to observe the transit of Mercury.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION :

From the report made to the trustees of the James Lick Trust, by
Prof. 8S. W. BURNHAM, the following information is gathered respecting
the situation and elevation of Mount Hamilton, upon which the Lick
Observatory is to be erected:

“The city of San José, the nearest point of railroad connection from
Mount Hamilton,is 50 miles south of San Francisco. Mount Hamilton,
by the highway, is 26 miles from San José, pearly east, and is reached
by a good road constructed two or three years since by the county of
Santa Clara. In order to keep the grade within the limit of six feet in
one hundred, the last portion of the road is carried up the ridges of the
mountain by a circuitous route. The distance between the observatory
and San José, in an air-line, is only 13 miles.

“The approximate geographical of the Observatory Peak is: Longi-
tude, 121° 36’ 40” W.; latitude, 37° 21/ 3” N.

‘The elevation of this point is 4,250 feet above the level of the sea.
The north peak, which is about three-fourths of a mile distant, is 140
feet higher. There is a ridge between, along which is a good trail con-
necting the two peaks. The sides of the mountain, in most directions,
are very steep, and form an acute angle at the summit. The view from
the peaks is unobstructed in every direction, there being no higher
ground within a radius of 100 miles. In this connection the report of
Messrs. Herrmann Bros., the engineers who surveyed the road, will be
of interest:

‘¢¢Thescope of the horizon from Mount Hamilton takesin more ground,
according to Professor Whitney’s judgment, tian almost any similar
peak in the Uniteu States, there being no obstruction to the view from
any quarter. It is remarkably free from fogs and clouds, as we had
ample occasion to observe during our last winter’s stay on the mountain
when locating the road. The bearings of the most notable objects are
as follows, the distances being taken, when out of our county, from our
most reliable maps:

(t) Miscellaneous : In use also a small instrument. The base of this
instrument is divided to degrees and read by vernier to 3/ of arc. An
upright pillar carries a semi-circle of altitude; this is divided to degrees
and read to 3’ of arc by a vernier. Attached to the semi-circle of alti-
tude is an hour-circle divided to 4" of time and read to single minutes
by vernier. Upon the hour-circle rests a semi-circle of declination
divided to degrees and read to 3/ of are by vernier. On the base are two
levels, the instrument being leveled by three adjusting screws, which
also serve as feet. The declination semi-circle carries a very small tel-
escope about .4 inch diameter of objective. The telescope has a diago-
nal eye-piece with metal reflector and single lenses and vertical and
horizontal hairs. The instruthent was made by W. & 8. Jones, London.
It is used for identifying stars in comet observations by setting the alti-
tude semi-circle for the latitude, thereby converting the instrument into
an equatorial.

YEAR :

The only publications have been: Letters to the English Mechanic

(London), Science (of New York), We.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION :

Observations have been from June, 1880, to January, 1881. These
observations have consisted chiefly in watching the changes on Jupiter ;
getting positions of comets, and making drawings of Saturn. From
July 11 to January 7 about tifty transits of the great red spot on Jupiter
recorded and some seventy-five sketches and drawings made of the con-
figuration of his surface. Transits of a number of spots, &c., on Jupiter
also observed. One black transit of Satellite III and four dark (brown-
ish) transits of Satellite 1 also noted.

A very good set of drawings made of the remarkable black Spots
which broke out just north of Jupiter’s great equatorial band, in the
fatter part of October (1880). These drawings show the remarkable
transformations of these spots until their finally encircling the planet
with a beautiful scolloped belt.

The comets of which positions have been obtained are
first position of this comet on October 21), and Pechiile’s.

The horological bureau is a department of the Winchester Observa-
tory, organized in January, 1880, with a special equipment of instru-
ments for a regular and extended public time service. The standard
time, by law of the State, is that of the meridian of the city hall, New
York, which is 4" 19°.6 slowtof New Haven, and 12™ 108.5 fast of Wash-
ington. -Another important work of the bureau is the testing of watches
and chronometers in the interest of the watch manufacture, for which
hot and cold closets and other special facilities are provided.

There is also connected with the Observatory a thermometrical bureau,
in charge of Dr. WALDO, for the verification of clinical and other ther-
mometers. It is amply furnished with the best standards, apparatus of
comparison, and other facilities for this work. About 1,000 thermome-
ters have been tested in the last six months.

A. REPSOLD & Sons, of Hamburg, are constructing for the Observa-
tory a heliometer of 6 inches aperture and embodying the latest improve-
ments. It is to be finished during the year 1881.

OBSERVATIONS DURING THE PAST YEAR (1880):

(a) Besides the regular time-service and the thermometric work, a
series of observations has been made, with interchange of the observ-
ers, for determining telegraphically the difference of longitude between
Cambridge and New Haven, the observers being Prof. WILLIAM A.
Rogers, of Cambridge, and Dr. WALDO, of New Haven.

WORK PROPOSED FOR THE COMING YEAR (1881-82):

The regular time and thermometric service, and the erection of a
building for the heliometer, with preparation for observing the approach-
ing transit of Venus, and for other work with this instrument.

VI. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

This Observatory consists of a small frame building, with dome 12
feet 6 inches diameter, upon the grounds of the owner, covering an
equatorial telescope. The latter rests upon a granite pedestal, weigh-
ing about 1,500 pounds. The mounting is by YouNG, of Philadelphia,
and is of the best workmanship. The declination circle is 13 inches in
diameter, reading by verniers to 10 seconds of are. The hour circle is
10 inches diqmeter, reading by verniers to 4 seconds of time. The
graduations are upon silver. The object-glass, tube, and finder are by
A. CLARK & Sons. The aperture of the object-glass is 9.4 inches, with
a focal length of 121 inches, and is without doubt the finest specimen
of the skill of Mr. ALVAN CLARK. Under the most rigid tests, its
figure is found to approach very closely to absolute perfection. It is
shown also by the vision it gives of the closest double stars and the
faintest companions to bright stars hitherto discovered. Among the
former, 7” Andromeda, 2 Cassiopee, and , Corone in its present position
may be mentioned, and of the latter class, the companions to 7 Lyra,
£ Aquille, «and p Hydre, the star closely following the attendant to
Regulus, and under very favorable circumstances the 2/” companion to
e Corone. The instrument has been used for general observations of
the stars, moon, and planets, other occupations preventing the owner
from carrying on at present any more regular work.

The HALSTED Observatory, which was built in 1870, but never
equipped, is being put in order for the reception of the great equatorial
of 23 inches in diameter. This magnificent instrument, which is pro-
vided for by the liberal subscriptions of friends of the college, is in pro-
cess of construction by the CLARKS at Cambridgeport. The object-glass
is completed, and is a very fine one; the mounting is well under way,
and unless something unexpected occurs the instrument will be in posi-
tion before JANUARY 1, 1882. The telescope will be occupied at first
mainly with stellar spectroscopy; and a spectroscope is being con-
structed for it by H1LGER, of London, under the kind supervision of
Mr. CHRISTIE, of the Greenwich Observatory.

The Observatory ot the JouN C. GREEN SCHOOL OF SCIENCE, which
was erected and provided with instruments in 1877, remains substan-
tially unchanged. A new 3-inch transit, by FAUTH was mounted in
the west room in 1879, and the AYCRIGG transit was transferred per-
manently to the prime vertical. A reflecting circle by Pistor & MAR-
TINS has also been added, and a full set of meteorological instruments.

The principal employment of this Observatory and of Professor
Young is in giving instruction in practical astronomy; a little scientific
work has, however, been accomplished. During the winter of 187879 a
telegraphic connection with Washington was effected, and six nights’
observations put the Princeton meridian circle 9™ 34%, 54 + 0.02 east of
the Observatory dome at Washington. During 1879 and 1550 five inde-
pendent series of latitude determinations have been made by two dif-

ferent observers, Mr. M. McNeruu and Mr. A. S. Furi, with three
different instruments, the KAHLER transit and the FAurH transit (used
as zenith telescopes), and the prime vertical. The results agree re-
markably well, all giving the latitude between 40° 20/ 57/”.76 and 40° 20/
57, 81. The final result is 40° 20’ 57’.79 + 0’. 04. In November, 1879,
a series of micrometrical observations were made upon the planet Mars
with the 94-inch equatorial, for the purpose of fixing its polar compres-
sion. The reduction of the observations gives 5!, for the value of this
quantity: a result surprisingly accordant with that deduced theoreti-
cally by ADAMS, on the supposition that the law of density of the planet
is not very different from the earth’s. Both satellites were readily seen
with the instrument, and this fact, with many others, goes to show that
the telescope, the object-glass of which it will be remembered has the
Gaussian curves, is one of the best, if not the best, of its size in exist-
ence.

Occasional spectroscopic observations have been made; especially a
minute examination of the 70 dark lines in the solar spectrum given by
ANGSTROM and THALEN as belonging to the spectra of two or more
metals in common; indicating, according to Mr. LOCKYER’s ideas, the
existence of some common constituent in the metals concerned, and so
tending to show them to be really non-elementary. The examination
was made in the summer of 1881 with an apparatus of unprecedented
dispersive power, consisting of a RUTHERFURD grating of 17,000 lines
to the inch, and collimator and telescope of about 4 feet focus. As a
result, 56 lines of the 70 were found to be distinctly double or multiple;
7 were doubtful, generally because they could not be certainly iden-
tified, and 7 appeared to be single; 3 of the 7, however, while shown
on the map as common to iron and some other metal, are not so given
in THALEN’s tables. On the whole, it is clear that the facts brought
out do not favor LOCKYER’S hypothesis.

One remarkable solar prominence was observed in October, 1881,
which in an hour reached an elevation of 350,000 miles—the highest yet
on record.

The spectra of several comets have been observed, and some series of
observations have been made upon their places which have been of use
in computing their orbits. A few double-star measures have been
taken; and observations were made upon the transit of Mercury in
1878, the solar eclipse of last December, and sundry occultations.

The solar eclipse of 1878 was observed at Denver by an expedition
sent out from Princeton, under the direction of Professors BRACKETT
and YOUNG, and its results were duly published in the American Journal
of Science.

Besides the members of the college classes, several others have
availed themselves, for a longer or shorter period, of the opportunities
at Princeton for the study of practical astronomy.

OBSERVATIONS DURING THE PAST YEAR:

The work done during the past year has been a repetition of that for
several years past, viz, comet seeking and observing those discovered
by others. The nebulz observed and heretofore overlooked, which,
however, are very few in number, have been also carefully recorded on
star charts. This facilitates the prompt detection of a comet. Much
caution, however, is necessary not to announce and especially not to
cable the discovery of « comet where no motion has been detected.
REPORTS OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORIES. 661

The year 1880, and thus far in 1881, have been remarkable as the
most unfavorable for such work for many years past.

On October 10-11, about midnight, another new comet was discovered.
Although no positive motion was detected in two hours’ watching, from
a Strong suspicion that it was a comet, the discovery was telegraphed to
four astronomers widely separated, in the hope that some one of them
would be fortunate enough to have a clear sky, and be able to secure an
early observation before the moon would interfere. Only one, Professor
Boss, of the Dudley Observatory, succeeded in finding it, and fortunately
he obtained the first position of it that could be used in computing its
orbit. On the evening of the 11th, as soon as twilight had disappeared
and in presence of a half moon, it was re-observed and immediately
cabled, but owing to moonlight it was not discovered in Europe until
October 25. The comet though large, was very faint, and proved
to be identical with comet [iI, 1869 (TEMPEL), which adds another to
the list of periodic comets. It was for some time a question whether
its period was 11 or 54 years. A thorough discussion of all the observa-
tions during its present and last observed apparition by Prof. S. C.
CHANDLER, jr., and also by others, proves beyond all doubt that its
period is a little less than 54 years.

The Warner Observatory is not yet completed, though work on it is
progressing satisfactorily, and it will be ready for occupancy in early
autumn. The telescope, a 16-inch refractor by the CLARKS, is nearly
completed.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
The Warner Observatory has issued the following circular:

SoutH HADLEY, Massachusetts.
Observatory at Mount Holyoke Seminary.

Longitude from Washington, ———?

Latitude, ———?

Through the liberality of Mr. A. L. WILLISTON, of Northampton, the
seminary has recently been enabled to erect a small but very complete
astronomical Observatory, supplied with all the necessary instruments.
It is designed to furnish the means for instruction to any who may wish
to make the subject a specialty, and to give opportunity to any of the
teachers or post-graduates who may take an interest in astronomy te
make observations of real value.

The building, of wood, consists of a tower with a dome 18 feet in
diameter, flanked by two wings, one extending to the east and one to
the north. The dome is very light, and rotates so easily that even the
feeblest of the young ladies can manage it without difficulty. The ar-
rangements for opening and closing the shutters which cover the slit in
the dome, and the openings forthe transit and prime vertical instrument,
are worked with equal facility. In the dome is mounted a fine 8-inch
equatorial by CLARK, completely fitted out with clock-work, finding-
clock, micrometers, spectroscope, solar eye-piece, &ec., and so arranged
that the circles can be read and the clamps and tangent screws worked
from the eye-piece of the instrument.

The object-glass is almost entirely the work of the senior ALVAN
CLARK, and is one of the most perfect specimens of his art.

In the transit-room is mounted a meridian circle by FAuTH & Co., of
Washington. The instrument has a telescope of 3 inches aperture, and
circles of 16 inches diameter, reading to seconds by two microscopes.
It has a reversing apparatus, and is fitted with a “latitude level” and
micrometer, so that it can, if desired, be used as a zenith telescope. A
large collimator is mounted upon a pier south of it, and in a corner of
the room is a clock with DENISON escapement, also by FAuTH & Co., as
is the chronograph, which is mounted in an adjoining closet. The Ob-
ervatory possesses also a sextant and artificial horizon and a set of
smeteorological apparatus.
664 REPORTS OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORIES.

There is no instrument in the prime vertical room (which is used
mainly as a waiting-room or for recitations), but it is provided with a
pier and shutter, so that the meridian circle can be set up there if it is
ever thought desirable to make observations in that plane.

The building and its equipment have cost not far from $10,000.

UNITED STATES NAVAL OBSERVATORY,
Washington, October, 20, 1879.
* ¥* * * * * *

The 26-inch equatorial.—This instrument has been in charge of Prof.
ASAPH HALL, with Prof. EDWARD S. HOLDEN as assistant until Febru-
ary, 1880, since which time Prof. EDGAR I’RISBY has been the assistant.
The instrument-is now in good order, and it is in constant use. It has
been employed as in previous years in the observation of satellites, dou-
ble stars, and nebulz.

The transit circle—This instrument has been employed during the
vear under the Cirection of Prof. J. R. EASTMAN, who was assisted by
Prof. EDWARD S. HOLDEN as an observer since April 1, 1880; Prof.
EDGAR FRiIsBy until December 10, 1879; Assistant Astronomer A. N.
SKINNER during the year; Assistant Astronomer if. M. PAUL until his
resignation, July 1, 1880, and Assistant Astronomer HL. 8S. PrRircHET?T
until his resignation, February 1, 1580. Mr. Mites Rock has been em-
ployed as a temporary assistant astronomer since Jaly 1, 1880; and Mr.
WILLIAM ©. WINLOCK has been similarly employed since August 2, 1880.
Mr. WinsSLOW UPYon has been employed as a computer since July 16,
1880. Lieut. E. LONGNECKER and Lieut. A. H. VAIL have beenemployed
in reducing transit-circle observations, the former during the year and
the latter since April 23, 1880.

The observations have been confined to—

1. Stars of the American ephemeris for clock and instrumental cor-
rections.

2. Sun, moon, major and minor planets.

3. Stars whose occultations were observed in connection with obser-
vations of the transit of Venus in 1874.

4. Standard stars for a catalogue of zone observations.

do. Such stars of the British Association catalogue between 120° 0’
REPORTS OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORIES. 667

and 151° 10/N. P. D. as have not been observed here three times in
both right ascension and declination.

6. Stars used in observations of comets with the 26-inch and 9.6-inch
equatorial.

7. Stars used in the determination of latitude by the United States
Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Lake Survey, Capt. G. M. WHEELER’S
Survey, and by Lieut. Commander I’. M. GREEN in surveys in the West
Indies.

The whole number of observations made with the transit circle since
the last report is 4,140. Of these observations, 68 were of the sun, 62
of the moon, 145 of the major planets, and 115 of the minor planets.

The printing of the annual volume for 1876 has been delayed several
months by lack of funds, but it is now nearly done. Of the transit
circle work, that for 1877 is ready for the printer; the reductions of the
1878 observations are nearly finished ; those of 1879 are nearly finished
to apparent place ; while those of 1880 are as fav advanced as the na-
ture of the work will permit.

The 9.6-inch equatorial—This instrument is under the direction of Prof.
J. R. EASTMAN, who has the same assistants as on the work with the
transit circle. It has been employed in the observations of comets and
occultations of stars, and also in determining the approximate correc-
tions to the ephemerides of such minor planets 2s are not readily found
with the transit circle.

The meteorological department is under the direction of Professor
EASTMAN, and the usual observations, at intervals of three hours, be-
ginning at midnight, have been made throughout the year by the watch-
men, Messrs. HAYS, HORIGAN, and CAHILL.

Astronomical photography.—The experiments in astronomical photo-
eraphy, including the reduction of the photographic observations of the
transit of Mercury in May, 1878, are under the charge of Prof. WM.
HARKNESS, who has been assisted by Master H. F. QUALTROUGH and by
Mr. JOSEPH A. ROGERS.

At the date of my last report the reductions of the Ann Arbor photo-
graphs of the transit of Mercury were suspended because the reticule
plate used in making the pictures had not been returned to this obser-
vatory. Since then the plate has been received, and the work of redue-
ing the photographs has made considerable progress.

An investigation has just been commenced for the purpose of obtain-
ing some light on the following questions, namely :

’ Ist. What are the capabilities of objectives of various sizes for as-
tronomical photography, and what are the approximate exposure coefii-
cients for the different classes of celestial objects?

2d. What form of an apparatus is best adapted for photographing
the corona during total solar eclipses, and what exposure coefficient is
likely to be required?

3d. What kind of pyroxylene is best adapted for astronomical pho-
tography, and how ean it be produced with certainty? Much time has
been spent in planning these experiments, and in devising suitable
apparatus for executing them, and it is hoped that they will lead to
practical results. P

Solar eclipses of July 29, 1878, and January 11, 1880.—The reports on
these eclipses have been collected into a volume (which is noticed else-
where). A iris :

The first part of the Transit of Venus papers, embracing the history
and general discussion, is in the hands of the printer, and the composi-

tion is about complete. The press-work was, however, postponed on
account of the incomplete state of the general reductions of the obser-
vations to appear in Part Il. These reductions cannot be completed
. without a small additional appropriation for the purpose.

The library.—The library contains 8,500 volumes, distributed about as
follows:

I. Works on astronomy, mathematics, geodesy, physics, meteorology,
and geography, including transactions of learned societies—about 6,200
volumes.

II. Pamphlets on the same subjects, each one separately bound in
paper covers, placed in drawers, and classified by subjects—about 1,000
numbers.

III. Miscellaneous works of reference, &c., in the office of the Super-
intendent—about 700 volumes.

IV. Publications of the United States Senate and House of Repre-
sentatives—about 600 volumes.

Total, $8,500 volumes.

A card catalogue of about 16,000 cards has been completed. It is
not necessary to print this at present. After the cards become soiled
by use, they should be printed to preserve them.

Distribution of the publications of the Observatory.—A list of 921 names
has been prepared, and to these correspondents our publications are
distributed. Academies cf science, public observatories, and the princi-
pal colleges, receive the complete volumes. The appendices are dis-
tributed to all observatories, to the principal astronomers, and others in-
terested in astronomy.

In return for this liberal distribution, the library receives, free of cost,
the publications of the principal observatories, learned societies, &e., of
the world.

Since February, 1879, about 12,000 separate numbers of our publica-
tions have been distributed. These were mostly to fill sets which had
been left incomplete in former distributions. At present all our corre-
spondents have complete sets of our volumes, as far as we can supply
them.

In addition to his duties as librarian, Professor HOLDEN takes his
regular tour of duty as an observer on the transit circle; and he has
made a set of drawings of the planets Saturn and Jupiter, with the
26-inch equatorial, and a series of measures of the dusky ring of Saturn,
in continuation of those made in 1879.

During the year the Western Union time-ball in New York has failed’
nine times: once on account of a heavy snow-storm; four times owing
to interruption to the Western Union lines; and four times owing to
accidents to machinery. The Washington time-ball has failed twice,
owing to accidents to machinery.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION :

Observations on the Aurora Borealis —The regular series of records of
the displays of the Aurora Borealis, begun in 1870, has been continued,
as heretofore. Three sentinel posts, widely separated from each other,
are guarded nightly by soldiers of the Battalion of Engineers specially
selected as watchmen. Eight men are thus permanently detailed.
Three of them remain on duty from sunset to sunrise, and are required
670 REPORTS OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORIES.

to report, when relieved, whether they have seen any auroral light dur-
ing the night ; and if not, whether the sky has been sufficiently clear to
permit any to be visible. These records for the past year are presented
in the following consolidated table—which, considering the difficulty of
distinguishing the fainter displays, is regarded as establishing the trust-
worthy character of the record by the gexeral accordance between the
three independent observers. It appears that out of 216 favorable
nights, 13 auroras were noted; and if we may assume the same ratio to
apply to the clouded nights, about 22 auroral displays occurred during
the twelve months.
Auroral displays in 1880.

These observations were undertaken to throw light upon the sapposed
connection between the number of solar spots and the frequency of
auroras and of magnetic disturbances. They have now been continued
long enough to give interest to the foregoing summary compiled from
the general orders above cited. No corresponding record of solar spots
during this period of eleven years is at hand for precise comparison ;
-but such records have been preserved, and they show the number of

spots in the year 1870 to be amaximum and in 1878 a minimum. It will
be noted that these years are nearly those of maximum and minimum
observed auroras.

OBSERVATIONS DURING THE PAST YEAR (from January 1, 1880,
to January 1, 1881):

(a) Fundamental stars for Schoenfeld’s ‘ Durchmusterung.”

Additional stars of N. and 8. declination for investigations connected
with refraction.

Daily observations of a4 and 7 Centauri for parallax.

Small list of stars observed at request of Dr. AUWERS.

Selected list of circumpolar stars.

Long series of observations connected with investigations on personal
equation.

List of stars to be used in connecting longitudes of Aden and Cape of
Good Hope.

(c) Every star, down to 6th of May, oceulted by the moon has been
observed when weather permitted. Every eclipse of Jupiter’s satellites
has been observed when weather permitted.

(7) The heliometer arrived in December. Observations with that in-
strument for annual parallax of § Centauri, « Indi and § Hydri have
been commenced.

WORK PROPOSED FOR THE COMING YEAR (1881):

Completion of observations of SCHOENFELD’sS fundamental stars.

Completion of personal equation investigations.

Continuation of observations of 4 and ? Centauri.

Completion of a useful catalogue of southern circumpolars for observ-
ers of transit of Venus, 1882.

Completion of longitude connection of Aden and Cape of Good Hope.

Researches with the heliometer on parallax of fixed stars.

Continuance of series of observations of occultations of stars by the
moon and eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites. Arrangements being made for
application of photometer to these latter observations, as at Cambridge,
United States.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

There have been no publications of the observatory issued during the
past year (1880). The great catalogue of 12,400 stars, deduced from ob-
servations 1870~79, was taken to England in 1879 by Mr. STONE for
publication, together with the annual volumes for 1877-78 in MSS.
Owing to necessary alterations in the microscopes of the transit circle,
and to some other instrumental changes, the new series of N. P. D. work
was not begun till March, 1880. The completion of one series of obser-
vations and the commencement of another creates a gap in the plan of
publications. The Cape catalogue for 1850, deduced from Maclear’s ob-
servations in 1849, 750, ’51, and ’52 is nearly completed. It contains all
stars of the B. A. C. catalogue having south declination.

There are also under preparation for press :

Occultations of stars by the moon (about 400 in number) observed be-
tween 1834 and 1870, reduced and compared with tables.

visitation of the Observatory is held every summer by the board of
Trinity College.

OBSERVATIONS DURING THE PAST YEAR (18380) :
The meridian observations of red stars (commenced by Dr. COPE-
686 REPORTS OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORIES.

LAND in 1875-1876, and taken up by Mr. DREYER in September 1878),
were finished in the summer 1880, each star being observed four times
or oftener. The reductions to the epoch 1575.0 were nearly finished by
the end of the year.

The south equatorial has been employed entirely in observations for
annual parallax by Dr. BALL. During 1880 a series for Groombridge
1618 was completed, and from the distances of + 50°, 1724, a parallax of
+ 0”, 3196 + .052 has been concluded; for Gr. 1618 a series for P II
242, recommended by STRUVE (M.N. vol. xx, p. 8), gives a parallax of
— 0.045 + 0.070 (M.N., November, 1880). A series for Schj. 249 (a)
(red stars) has been completed, but not reduced, and a series for w
Cephei and < 2486 have been commenced. The sweeping observations
described in Dunsink Observations, Part III, have also been continued.

WORK PROPOSED FOR THE COMING YEAR (1881):

The meridian circle is proposed to be employed in a reobservation of
ARGELANDER’S southern zones, commencing with the zone —15° to
—20°, and extending perhaps a few degrees more south if it appears
practicable.

The equatorial is proposed to be employed in a continuation of the
parallax observations, much of which work is at present in hands.

500 feet of additional shelving.

WORK DONE DURING THE PAST YEAR (1880):

The work during 1880 has been chiefly cometary and spectroscopic
observations with the 15-inch refractor and determination of compari-
son stars with the transit circle; Mars was compared with « Orionis
and « Tauri with the astrophotometer.

Some specimens of glass were tested with a spectrometer made from
an old alt-azimuth instrument.

The greater part of the time has been devoted to the reduction of the
observations connected with Lord LINDSAy’s Transit of Venus Expedi-
tion. These reductions are now approaching completion.

WORK PROPOSED FOR 1881:
The same class of work is proposed for 1881.
PUBLICATIONS:

No considerable works were published in 1880. Various papers were
communicated to the “ Astronomische Nachrichten”; Monthly Notices
of the “ Royal Astronomical Society,” and “Urania,” besides which 13
special circulars were distributed to all applicants.

The first Observatory here was established by the Jesuits at San
Giorannino College, later called The Religious Schools (Scole Pie). A
second was proposed by the government in 1774 as an annex to the
Museum of Physics and Natural History of the Pitti Palace. It was
built from 1777 to 1784, and afterwards the establishment was trans-
ferred to the hill of Arcetri, where GALILEO lived during the latter part

one of the round towers of the ancient fortification, around which was
built an exterior gallery. In 1811 the Observatory was transferred to a
more suitable spot outside the southern gate-way of the town. This new
building is on the plan of a rectangle, with the longer sides facing east
and west. An addition is made by wings to the north, a cupola sur-
mounts the central vestibule, and a terrace encircles the whole struct-

Founded by royal statute on the 4th May, 1675. Built in the park at
Greenwich by CHRISTOPHER WREN, architect. At first it consisted
merely of an octagonal tower. In 1860 FLAMSTEED put up an addi-
tional wing to accommodate the mural sector, with the help of which he
made his catalogue of stars. The board of visitors was created in 1710.
In 1749 and the years immediately following great improvements
and additions were made. The sector used by BRADLEY in discovering
the phenomenon of aberration was transferred to Greenwich, and BIRD
supplied a mural quadrant with a radius of 7 feet 10$ inches (2™.4),
besides remodeling the one made by GRAHAM. A statute of 1765 con-
firmed the right of supervision vested in the Royal Society and exer-
cised by the board of visitors. In 1770 two revolving domes were con-
structed upon the turrets, and these. have served as models for all
revolving turrets since constructed. In 1772 the first achromatic
object-glass ever used at Greenwich was attached to the south quad-
rant. It had an aperture of 23 inches (68 millimeters). In 1779 the

expediency of enlarging the meridian openings was acknowledged ;
hitherto the aperture had only been 6 inches (0™ 15°).

At the beginning of the present century it became necessary to re-
build the Observatory, and the work, continuing until 1811, consisted in
the construction of two rectangular buildings, the eastern one being the
Observatory proper and containing halls for the meridian instruments,
the library, and office, while the western structure was intended for the
dwelling-house of the superintendent. It was in one of these new halls
that the first model of a mural circle, 5 feet (1™ .5) in diameter, con-
structed by E. TROUGITON, was placed in 1812.

The present organization of Greenwich Observatory dates from a royal
statute of 1830. According to the terms of this statute the board of
visitors consists of the members of the Royal Society, the members of
the Astronomical Society, and the Oxford and Cambridge professors of
astronomy. In 1844 the first alt-azimuth was set up. It was designed
by Airy, and made by RANSOME & MERZ and TROUGHTON & Simms,
being intended for lunar observations.

As a finishing touch, the immense dome to the southeast was built in
1859 for the reception of the equatorial of W. Sims, with an objeet-
glass, by G. MERZ, having a focal length of 34 feet 5 inches (10™ .5) ;
now used for spectroscopic work.

The observations made annually at Greenwich have been published
regularly since 1765. In the first volume of this publication we find the
first notice of the illumination of the reticulation in a meridian instru-
ment by means of the axis of the spy-glass.

INSTRUMENTS:

An equatorial instrument by GRuBB, of Dublin, so constructed that
either a refractor of 15 inches aperture and 15 feet focal length, or a
CASSEGRAIN reflector with metallic speculum of 18 inches aperture may
be placed at pleasure on the same equatorial mounting, so that with
either instrument the circles read sufficiently for the finding of objects.
The driving-clock has, in addition to the usual governor balls, a second-
ary control of a pendulum in electrical connection with a standard
clock.

Up to 1870, when the present equatorial was erected, a transit circle
of 3} inches aperture was mounted in the Observatory. At that time
the principal instrument the Observatory contained was an 8-inch re-
fractor by ALVAN CLARK, mounted equatorially by Cooks, of York.

There is a fine sidereal clock by ARNOLD, and various spectroscopes
for use with the telescopes on the sun and stars; and there has been

recently added a spectroscope with Iceland spar prism and quartz lenses
for photography of spectra of stars.

Underneath the Observatory are two rooms, one devoted to chemistry
and photography, the other to physical experiments in connection with
spectrum analysis.

Continuation and completion of a series of photographs of spectra of
various stars. Researches in connection with these spectra.

The Society of Jesus had an Observatory at their College of Sainte
Croix, founded 1702. In 1749 this scientific institution was taken in
hand by the Ministry of Marine. It is a three-story building, longest
from east to west, erected on the summit of the Butte des Moulins. In

797 this Observatory was repaired. A new establishment was erected
in 1869 on the hill of Longchamps, to supplement the work at the Paris
Observatory. The instruments are distributed in separate apartments.

National Observatory (formerly Royal, since Imperial) built in 1667
under the auspices of the Academy of Sciences, according to plans of
C. PERRAULT. A vast central hall; two towers, east and west. In
1732, a small room to accommodate a mural quadrant was added beyond
_the eastern tower, and in 1742 this was extended by a second enclosure
for a moveable quadrant. In 1760 a turret with a revolving roof was
built to the south of this addition. The main building having become
dilapidated was restored in 1786—completed 1793—since when it has
been detached and the south terrace built. In 1852 the small roomg
where observations are taken were repaired, and the amphitheater
and a rotunda with a revolving roof built upon the principal terrace.
The dome intended for the shelter of the great equatorial was placed
on the summit of the building in 1850. The great telescope with a mir-
ror of silvered glass eet (1™.2) in diameter—was mounted in 1876, in
a building on the ground-floor level. JOHN DOMINIC CASSINI discoy-
ered four of the satellites of Saturn at the Paris Observatory, and also
first investigated the subject of the Zodiacal Light, and here, too, the
great grandson of this astronomer was the first to follow the variations

Before the establishment of a regular Observatory a succession of
astronomers, more or less famous, made use of temporary accommoda-
tions. In the buildings of the old college CLAVIUS made observations
with a zenithal sector in 1572, and following years. SCHEINER col-
lected the materials for his famous Rosa Ursina, the printing of which
was completed in 1630 at the new college, west of the Church of St,
Ignatius. There, too, GOTTIGNIER and BORGONDIO made occasional
observations. MAIR&E observed the comet of 1844 at the English Col-
lege. Boscovicn fixed himself in the principal hall of the Kircher
Museum. Finally, ASCLEPI organized a permanent establishment in
1764; and in 1787 a square tower was built to accommodate the Ob-
servatory at the eastern angle of the College facade on via del Gesu.
A new building was put up in 1853, having for substructure the enor-
mous piles which had been intended to support the dome of the Church
of St. Ignatius.

An Observatory had been first established at Cadiz in 1753, upon an
ancient Roman tower, but was soon abandoned, observations being
made there only from 1773 to 1776, by ToFINO and VARELA. The new
Observatory was built at San Fernando in 1797. This is the most
southerly astronomical establishment in Europe. (Latitude 36° 28.)

The following is a translation of portions of a report made by Mr.
HvuGo GYLDEN in the “ Vierteljahrsschrift der Astronomischen Gesell-
schaft,” 15ter Jahrgang, 2ter Heft:

Mention has been made in former reports of two extensive series of
observations for the purpose of, firstly, to redetermine all the bright
stars between 45° N. declination and the North Pole, which are accessi-

ble to our instruments; and, secondly, to furnish a contribution to the
knowledge of the mean distances of stars.
REPORTS OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORIES. 125

ee redetermination will result in the formation of a catalogue of
1,210 stars, in which the positions will be laid down with a probable
error of about + second in each co-ordinate (the rectascension probably
more accurate). Most of the required observations were made by Mr.
LINDHAGEN, and the series is nearly complete. The second series.
unfortunately, will have to be delayed, owing to necessary repairs of
the meridian circle, which exhibits traces of oldage. - -— -

From the results obtained by comparison in different positions, the
the probable error of a single declination determination is estimated as
0.5 to 0’.6, which may be still reduced.

Up to the present time the polar distances have been computed tem-
porarily from observations of the Nautical Almanae stars, with applica-
tion of the declination estimated in the fundamental catalogue for zone
observations in the N. sky. Predominating, though not exclusive, use
having been made of extreme northern stars, it is presumable that the
unknown inclination of the instrument has exerted quite an influence on
the results obtained. It is, however, evident from the coincidence of the
polar positions obtained in both situations of the objective and ocular
that the inclination coefficient, which appears as multiplied by the sine
of the zenith distance, cannot be very large. - - -

The second series is intended to furnish a contribution to the knowl-
edge of the mean distances of the stars. Mention of this work has been
made in former reports, and an account of the progress made during
the past year is here presented.

Of the stars previously mentioned as to be observed for parallax, two
have been omitted, namely, a Aurigze, and * Persei; the former on ac-
count of the difference of brilliancy between the principal star and a
comparison star, the latter on account of the difference of declination
of the comparison stars. These were substituted by a Coron, and
¢ Urse Majoris. In consequence of the brillianey of the former the
observations will be rather difficult and probably somewhat incorrect.
I propose, however, to continue them for some time yet, in order to test
whether the parallax may be confined to satisfactory limits by a multi-
plication of the observations. The same is the case with « Persei and
f Andromede, notwithstanding their insufficient accuracy.

In observing ¢ Ursa Majoris use could be made of only one comparison
star; a second one, at first designed to be included, proving too indis-
tinct. The former, however, is in every respect satisfactory. This star
moves on the same parallel with the principal star and 505 seconds
ahead, and its magnitude, according to Argelander, is 8.0. The consid-
erable brilliancy of this star admits of its observation even during un-
favorable state of the atmosphere, and it has not been neglected not-
withstanding the sometimes very unsatisfactory impression obtained.

It is thereby intended to arrive at another result in addition to the de-
termination of the parallax, namely, the collecting of material for the
estimation of the relative accuracy which may be expected at the contact
of the cross-wire and right-ascension differences during a favorable or
unfavorable condition of the atmospuere. Although the results obtained,
until now, in reference thereto are not by any means conclusive, they
are regarded as worth communicating.

As the results of observations are computed, with but few exceptions,
from four transits, the probable error + 0°.017 is to be expected. In
close conformity there is deduced from the 16 observations of « Ursa ex-
tant at present the probable error + 05.016.

This result appears to be very satisfactory. Even if the probable
error of a result of observations were + 6°.020, 30 or 40 nights adequately
726 ' REPORTS OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORIES.

distributed would be sufficient to determine the parallax of a star with
a probable error of about + 0.035. If we confine ourselves to the obser-
vation of such stars, the star of comparison of whieh is neither too feeble
or too distant, the observations may be made very rapidly without
fatiguing the eye, so that a considerable number of stars can be compared
in one night. There are several hundred pairs of stars inthe heavens
av ailable for the purpose, and it does not seem therefore at all imprac-
ticable for several observers to take up the matter of settling upon a
direct determination of the parallax of stars of the sixth magnitude, in
which the probable error would amount to only about + 0.003. The
medium parallax of these stars is, according to Peters, 0.027, but prob-
ably is only one-half of this. Both magnitudes, as also their differ ence,
are so much above the probable errors that it is to be hoped that con-
jectures on this important point will, at no distant time, be no longer
necessary.

The director has furnished the following particulars from his report
for 1878-1879:

The most noteworthy occurrence during the past year is the setting
apart, as an independent establishment, of the meteorological Observa-
tory. This new arrangement, made practicable by a government appro-
priation for the current expenses, is as yet in so far incomplete as in
absence of an independent building for meteorological purposes the
institute occupies two rooms in the astronomic building. - - -

The requirements of the Observatory have been constantly increasing
and are now imperative as regards instruments, repairs, and proper
arrangements, if any kind of activity is expected. The present means
are quite insufficient to satisfy the most urgent needs of the establish-
ment.

The only room of observation in a satisfactory condition is the small
Wackerbarth cupola, which was repaired last summer, while the meri-
dian room and the large cupola require considerable repairs and im-
provements. - - -

The small collection of instruments of this Observatory, apart from
quite antique instruments, consists of the following:

One parallactic refractor, made by STELNHEIL, 9 inches aperture,
the principal instrument of the Observatory, the application of which,
however, on account of insufficient mounting, is impracticable and lim-
ited. It has been employed mainly for observation of nebulz and star
clusters. A concise description of this instrument was given in the
“Mikrometrisk Bestiimning af 104 Stjerner inom Teleskopiska Stjern-
grupper 20 Vulpecule.”

One small parallactic refractor of 4 inches aperture, made by Sms,
in good condition, and presented to the Observatory some years ago by
Prof. WACKERBARTH.

One old universal instrument of 45 millimeters aperture, by REPSOLD,
the circles of which, however, are useless for practical measurements ;
it has been employed for many years for time determinations in the
meridian.

One universal instrument 33 millimeters aperture, by MEYERSTEIN.

One small transit instrument 54 millimeters aperture, by STEINHEIL,
the application of which is excellent, but which, on account of insufficient
mounting, and too small meridian aperture (the telescope is affixed to
the end of the axis of rotation), has thus far not found any proper appli-
cation.

A small reflex circle by PISTOR, in satisfactory condition.

Four portable telescopes.

One old pendulum clock, by GRAHAM, reconstructed by KESSELS,
about forty years ago.

Two old box chronometers, by KESSELS.

One portable barometer, by PIsToR.

The only instrument purchased during the past year is an inexpensive
pendulum clock for experiments with electrical apparatus, though order
REPORTS OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORIES. tau

was given for a registering apparatus for transit observation, and for
three electrical clock attachments, to be employed in the small isolated
pavilion.

Tn the total absence of an instrument for measuring zenith distances,
preliminary communication has been held with the celebrated firm of
REPSOLD SOHNE, in Hamburg, for the preparation of a medium sized
vertical circle. Further projects for the equipment of the Observatory
have to be delayed for the present. ,

The WACKERBARTH reflector and the REPSOLD universal instruments
have undergone repairs, and results in the improvement of the latter
for transitobservation. The STEINHEIL transit instrument is at present
in the hands of Mr. Rose, maker to the University, for repair, having in
view its application in the vertical of the Pole star.

The library of the Observatory originated by private donations, has
received its principal increase in voluntary contributions by scientists
and institutions abroad. It consists of four distinet groups: the Hsor-
TER and MALLET donation, the Collectio Recentior and the Svanberg
collections. The catalogue shows for these four the following figures,
respectively: 1150, 880, 360, and 1200, of which, however, many, such as
journals, annuals, ephemerides, &e., consist of a large number of  vol-
umes. On occasion of the emancipation of the meteorology, the works
relating to this branch were set apart for that institute. The increase
during the past year amounted to 90 contributions, of which 70 came from
abroad; sixty books were bound.

In consequence of the circumstances referred to, little scientific work
has been done during the past year. The director has continued his obser-
vations on nebulie, while the assistant made time determinations. The
director’s time has been largely consumed in perfecting arrangements for
instruction. Very desirable text-books have been published at govern-
ment expense, and preparations made to facilitate astronomical instrue-
tion for the students, among which is the establishment of a work-room,
in which opportunity is given to the students to acquaint themselves
between the observations with recent astronomical literature and jour-
nals.

Hight students have practiced during the year, and many have at-
tended the astronomical lectures.

Continuation of observations of asteroids and comets, with the two
equatorials: Zone observations (re-observations of stars observed by
SANTINI, between decl. 0° and 10°) with the meridian circle. If the
large equatorial of 27 inches by H. GruBB, at Dublin, can be mounted
in due time, observations with it will be commenced at once; but the
plan of operation is not yet settled.

PRINCIPAL PUBLICATIONS DURING THE YEAR (1880):

E. WEIss; “Annalen der K. K. Sternwarte in Wien,” iii Folge, Bd.
29, Vienna, 1881; 1 vol., 226 pp.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

The principal instrument of the Observatory will be an equatorial of
27-inch object-glass, and about 32 feet focal length, manufactured by
HowARD GRUBB at Dublin; but it is not yet out of the contractor’s
hands. The first Assistant, Mr. J. PALISA, re-discovered Juewa (159),
February 23, 1881; and discovered asteroid (220) May 18, 1881.
