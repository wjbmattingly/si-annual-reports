Report of the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution

LEONARD CARMICHAEL
For the Year Ended June 30, 1958

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:
GrenTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit a report showing the activ-

ities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and its branches
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1958.

GENERAL STATEMENT

The 112th year of the Smithsonian Institution, whose activities are
recorded in this report, has demonstrated anew that James Smithson’s
scientifically and philosophically oriented mind conceived an effective
enterprise when he specified that the establishment he founded and
endowed should devote itself to “the increase and diffusion of know}l-
edge among men.” ‘These two related objectives still guide and
inspire the varied and constructive activities of his Institution. /n-
crease of knowledge well describes the scientific and scholarly research
that is effectively carried on by Smithsonian staff members. Déffusion
of knowledge aptly summarizes the development of public museum
displays, the presentation of lectures, the conduct of a great official
correspondence about science and related matters, and the issuing
of scientific and popular publications by the Institution.

During the year here reported upon 10,365,872 individuals visited
the Smithsonian, if all its branches are considered. This is a truly
amazing and significant fact, for probably no other museum group
anywhere, comparable at all to the Smithsonian Institution, has ever
been visited by so many people in a single year. It is interesting to
note, however, that a growth in the recognition of the importance of
national museums seems to characterize not only America but also
many of the other nations of the world at the present time. As the
United States becomes more certain of its established place in the
world, its citizens seem to become increasingly interested in the unique
type of knowledge about American natural resources and American
civilian, military, and technological history that can be acquired at
their Smithsonian. Our records show that the Institution now has

if
yy) ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

nearly 51 million cataloged objects in its collections. In number of
items, therefore, as well as of visitors, the Smithsonian Institution is
certainly one of the largest museum complexes, if not the largest, on
the face of the globe.

The fact that the Smithsonian possesses such great collections and
also attracts such armies of visitors makes it very important that the
public displays of its museums be prepared and presented in the most
interesting and instructive manner for the benefit of all who come
through its doors. It is a pleasure, therefore, to report that real
progress was made during the year in the renovation of exhibits in
the older buildings of the Smithsonian. Detailed planning has also
been carried on in preparation for the construction of the great ex-
hibits that must be ready for immediate installation when the struc-
ture of the Institution’s new Museum of History and Technology
building is completed in 1961.

Since the Institution’s program of modernizing exhibitions began
about 5 years ago, more than a dozen new exhibit halls have been
opened in our older buildings—the First Ladies Hall, two halls por-
traying North American Indians and Eskimos, the Hall of Latin
American Archeology, Birds of the World, North American Mammal
Hall, Everyday Life in Early America, the Hall of Power Machinery,
the Hall of Health, the Printing Arts Hall, the Hall of Gems and
Minerals, and the Halls of Naval and Military History. These new
halls represent notable accomplishments and have attracted wide and
favorable notice, not only from the general public but also from
museum technicians and specialists in visual education here and
abroad.

This current improvement of Smithsonian museum units is thus
really part of a new worldwide regard for the educational function
of museums. This growth is attested by the reports of the Inter-
national Museums Office in Paris. Hardly a nation can be named
that is not now engaged in new developments of buildings or displays
in its national museums. It is interesting that such projects are
being carried out on a large scale in Russia and its satellite states as
well as in western nations.

This new emphasis upon the preservation for posterity and the
effective display of objects that represent the resources and the phys-
ical development of each nation may well have been fostered by
mankind’s recognition of the destruction of its heritage that was
brought about by two world wars. In this sense every great museum
stands as a tribute to mankind’s faith in the continuity of human
achievement. Each such institution attests a recognition that the
future is best when it 1s solidly grounded upon a knowledge of past
achievements.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 3

The objective of the new museum development at the Smithsonian
is to display examples of the mineral and biological resources of our
nation and of the world and to epitomize the human achievements
that have made our country great and strong.

More than 60 years ago a notable museum scholar, George Brown
Goode, Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, defined
a museum as “an institution for the preservation of those objects which
best illustrate the phenomena of nature and the works of man, and
the utilization of these for the increase of knowledge and for the
culture and enlightenment of the people.” This fundamental con-
ception has not changed with the years. But methods and techniques
for meeting this objective do change. Dr. Goode further stated,
“The museum of the past must be set aside, reconstructed, transformed
from a cemetery of bric-a-brac into a nursery of living thoughts.
The museum of the future must stand side by side with the library
and the laboratory ... as one of the principal agencies for the en-
lightenment of the people.” What could better describe what has
been going on in the Smithsonian’s museums during recent years?
Those who have these renovations in charge are trying to give the
Smithsonian educational exhibitions that are appropriate and ade-
quate to the mental outlook of a 20th-century America.

In the Smithsonian’s new Museum of History and Technology
building, now under construction, there will be displayed from our
vast collections the truly breathtaking story of the rise and inter-
related growth of the civilian, military, and technological aspects of
American life. In this building the relationship of pure and applied
science will be presented in an effective way, patterned to some extent
upon the manner in which this relationship is so well displayed in a
number of great Kuropean museums. In the new Smithsonian build-
ing, however, the strands that have been woven together in the mak-
ing of our modern American civilization will be shown in a way that
it is hoped will be unique and particularly appropriate to the special
genius of our country.

The existing exhibits of the Smithsonian Institution and the new
exhibits now being planned can be thought of as significant not only
in the knowledge but also in the motivation that they may instill in
many of the millions of high-school visitors who come to the Smith-
sonian each year. In a free society, boys and girls are not drafted
and forced to study mathematics or physics or any other subject that
may be required by the state. Our society depends upon the slower,
but certainly in the long run the sounder, technique of first arousing
the students’ interest and then providing them with needed edu-
cational opportunities. Certainly great museums, such as those
directed by the Smithsonian, are able in an important way to inspire
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

and provide educational motivation for not a few of its millions of
visitors each year. Because of the present importance of interesting
enough talented students in scientific studies to assure that our country
will remain scientifically and technologically strong, it is especially
fortunate that at just this time the work of the Smithsonian is be-
coming so effective in displaying the essential relationship between
pure and applied science and in demonstrating how research has led
to progress in many fields in recent years.

It should be recorded also that forward steps were made during the
year in planning new wings for the Natural History Building, as
authorized by Congress last year.

As the detailed statements of the various bureau directors of the
Smithsonian presented in this report demonstrate, the Institution
is by no means exclusively concerned with museum displays. This
year’s record of publications indicates that the Institution is now, as
in past years, playing a vital role in the communication of scientific
information to the laboratories and research centers of the nation and
the world. This year also the Smithsonian has issued some popular
works based upon its collections for the information of a broader
public.

One of the most dramatic aspects of the work of the Institution
during the time covered by this report is that of the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory. Funds have been provided for some of
the work of this bureau by grants from foundations and from the
committee in charge of the International Geophysical Year. As a
result of the use of these special funds, it has been possible to estab-
lish Smithsonian Institution observing centers for artificial satellites
in the following locations: Argentina, Australia, Florida, Hawaii,
Japan, India, Iran, Curacao, New Mexico, Peru, South Africa, and
Spain. The observations at these centers have also been made more
adequate by the installation in each of them of a newly devised type
of astronomical camera or recording telescope that has unique fea-
tures. Information obtained from these stations is communicated to
the headquarters of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at
Cambridge, Massachusetts. At this center calculations are made that
have allowed the Institution to describe the orbits of all the major
artificial satellites and to make accurate predictions concerning the
characteristics of their motions.

As noted below in special sections, this report year has indeed been
one of progress in many aspects of the work of the Institution.

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson, of
SECRETARY’S REPORT 5

England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting
the trust, Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and, therefore,
constituted an “establishment,” whose statutory members are “the
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the
executive departments.”

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

There was no change during the current year in the membership
of the Board of Regents. The roll of Regents at the close of the fiscal
year was as follows: Chief Justice of the United States Earl War-
ren, Chancellor; Vice President Richard M. Nixon; members from
the Senate: Clinton P. Anderson, Leverett Saltonstall, H. Alex-
ander Smith; members from the House of Representatives: Overton
Brooks, Clarence Cannon, John M. Vorys; citizen members: John
Nicholas Brown, Arthur H. Compton, Robert V. Fleming, Crawford
H. Greenewalt, Caryl P. Haskins, and Jerome C. Hunsaker.

The informal dinner meeting of the Board, preceding the annual
meeting, was held on the evening of January 16, 1958, in the main
hall of the Smithsonian Building. Here various exhibits were dis-
played showing phases of present-day projects. Dr. G. Arthur
Cooper spoke on brachiopods as a key to the past, Dr. Anthony N.
B. Garvan talked about colonial silver, Dr. Ralph S. Solecki spoke
on “The Discovery of the First Neanderthals in Mesopotamia,” and
Archibald G. Wenley compared the Far Eastern collections in the
Freer Gallery of Art with those abroad.

The regular annual meeting of the Board was held on January
17, 1958. The Secretary presented his published annual report on
the activities of the Institution together with the 1957 annual report
of the United States National Museum. Dr. Robert V. Fleming,
chairman of the executive and permanent committees of the Board,
gave the financial report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1957.

FINANCES

A statement on finances, dealing particularly with Smithsonian pri-
vate funds, will be found in the report of the executive committee of
the Board of Regents, page 223.

APPROPRIATIONS

Funds appropriated to the Institution for its regular operations for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1958, totaling $6,102,319 were obligated
as follows:

VISITORS

Again this year an all-time high was reached in the number of
visitors to the Smithsonian group of buildings on the Mall. The
total was 5,423,771, about 582,000 more than the previous year. April
1958 was the month of largest attendance, with 864,451; August 1957
second, with 765,129; July 1957 third, with 763,817. Largest attend-
ance for a single day was 69,349 on April 27, 1958. On the same day—
the first Sunday of the Churchill exhibition of paintings, 42,524 came
to the Natural History Building alone. Table 1 gives a summary of

the attendance records for the five buildings. These figures, when
added to the 913,482 visitors recorded at the National Gallery of Art
and the 4,028,620 estimated at the National Zoological Park, make a
total number of visitors at the Institution of 10,365,876.

LECTURES

The annual James Arthur Lecture on the Sun, customarily held
in the spring, was postponed this year until fall. The 25th Arthur
Lecture, therefore, will be recorded in next year’s report.

Dr. Rodney S. Young, curator of the Mediterranean Section of
the University Museum at Philadelphia and professor of classical
archeology at the University of Pennsylvania, delivered a lecture
on “Recent Discoveries at Gordion” in the auditorium of the Natural
History Building on the evening of February 27, 1958. ‘This lecture
was sponsored jointly by the Smithsonian Institution and the Archeo-
logical Institute of America.

Several lectures were also sponsored by the Freer Gallery of Art
and the National Gallery of Art. These are listed later in the reports
of these bureaus.

BIO-SCIENCES INFORMATION EXCHANGE

The current interest in and growing support of research in the
bio-sciences have resulted in a considerable growth in the activities
of the Bio-Sciences Information Exchange. This agency, which
operates within the Smithsonian Institution under funds made avail-
able to the Institution by other agencies, remains the most compre-
hensive clearinghouse for current research in the life sciences.
Through its extensive and detailed system of indexing it acts as a
rapid means of communication among research workers.

The active research projects registered with the Exchange now
number more than 17,000. For each project the investigator has
prepared a brief summary of his current problem. These summaries
are made available upon request and without charge to staff members
of research institutions. The Exchange also functions to prevent
unknowing duplication of research support by the national govern-
mental and nongovernmental granting agencies. In carrying out
this responsibility a vast amount of data on the support of research
in the life sciences has been accumulated. Information of this type
is continually used by granting agencies in planning their current
and future activities.

SUMMARY OF THE YEAR’S ACTIVITIES

National Museum.—Accessions to the national collections during
the year brought the total catalog entries in all departments to nearly
492520—59-—_2

Service.

Members of the staff conducted fieldwork in Iraq, Japan and Oki-
nawa, Africa, Panama, Europe, and many parts of the United States.

Under the exhibits-modernization program three new halls were
opened to the public during the year—the Hall of Health, the Hall
of North American Indians and Eskimos, and the Hall of Military
History.

Bureau of American Hthnology.—Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr.,
was made Director of the Bureau on January 1, 1958, filling the posi-
tion made vacant by the retirement of Dr. M. W. Stirling. The
staff members continued their research and publication activities:
Dr. Roberts continued as Director of the River Basin Surveys, Dr.
Collins continued his Eskimo and Arctic studies, Dr. Sturtevant
carried on ethnologic fieldwork in South Carolina, New York, and
Florida, and Mr. Miller renewed his excavations at Russell Cave,
Alabama.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 9

Astrophysical Observatory.—The work of the Smithsonian Astro-
physical Observatory continued along four principal lines—solar
astrophysics, upper atmosphere, meteors, and the satellite tracking
program. The last-named operation was, of course, fully activated
following the Russian launching of the first artificial earth satellite
on October 4, 1957. The division of radiation and organisms con-
tinued its researches on photomechanisms in plants.

National Collection of Fine Arts.—The Smithsonian Art Commis-
sion accepted for the Gallery 1 bronze, 2 oil paintings, 1 watercolor
on ivory, and the Gothic library and 18th-century French Renais-
sance drawingroom from “Miramar,” Newport, R.I. The Gallery
held 18 special exhibitions during the year, and the Smithsonian
Traveling Exhibition Service circulated 96 exhibitions in 264 mu-
seums and galleries.

Freer Gallery of Art—Purchase for the Freer Gallery collections
included Chinese bronzes, ivory, jade, painting, and pottery; Jap-
anese painting, wood sculpture, and pottery; Egyptian glass; Persian
metalwork, pottery, and manuscript; and Mesopotamian pottery.
The Gallery continued its program of illustrated lectures in the audi-
torium by distinguished scholars in eastern art, the 1957-58 series
numbering 6.

National Air Musewm.—Good progress was made toward locating
a site for a new building for the museum. During the year 193
specimens in 52 separate accessions were added to the aeronautical
collections, including a “Falcon” GAR-1 guided missile, a Verville-
Sperry “Messenger” airplane of 1920, the Herrick “Vertoplane” of
1937, a bronze statue of Brig. Gen. William Mitchell, and a “Van-
guard” rocket-powered satellite vehicle.

National Zoological Park.—The Zoo accessioned 1,411 individual
animals during the year. The net count at the close of the year was
2,316. Noteworthy among the additions were a pair of trumpeter
swans, three Tasmanian devils, a pair of great black-casqued horn-
bills, and a linsang from Malaya. A snow leopard was born in
captivity, an extremely rare event. Visitors totaled more than 4
million.

Canal Zone Biological Area.—Of the approximately 570 visitors
to the island during the year, 43 were scientists, students, and ob-
servers using the station for special researches, particularly in wild-
life observation, plant and insect studies, and photography.

International Exchange Service—As the official United States
agency for the exchange of governmental, scientific, and literary
publications between this country and other nations, the International
Exchange Service handled during the year 1,094,798 packages of
such publications, weighing 743,329 pounds.
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

National Gallery of Art-—The Gallery during the year received
1,730 accessions by gift, loan, or deposit. Ten special exhibitions
were held, and 18 traveling exhibitions of prints from the Rosenwald
Collection were circulated elsewhere. Exhibitions from the “Index
of American Design” were given 26 bookings in 9 States. Nearly
44,000 persons attended the general tours conducted by Gallery per-
sonnel, and over 8,000 attended tours and lectures by special appoint-
ment. The Sunday afternoon lectures drew a total attendance of
about 13,000 persons. The Sunday evening concerts in the east
garden court were continued.

Library.—The library received a total of 53,274 publications during
the year; 128 new exchanges were arranged. Outstanding among
the gifts were a large collection of philatelic items and nearly 2,700
books and reprints on Diptera. At the close of the year the holdings
of the library and all its branches aggregated 974,893 volumes, in-
cluding 586,722 in the Smithsonian Deposit at the Library of Con-
gress but excluding unbound periodicals and reprints and separates
from serial publications.

Publications.—Kighty-one new publications appeared under Smith-
sonian imprint during the year. (See Report on Publications, p. 215,
for full list.) Outstanding among these were: “Araucanian Child
Life and Its Cultural Background,” by Sister M. Inez Hilger; “The
Medical and Veterinary Importance of Cockroaches,” by Louis M.
Roth and Edwin R. Willis; “Geology of Barro Colorado Island,
Canal Zone,” by W. P. Woodring; “The History of Entomology in
World War II,” by Emory C. Cushing; “Life Histories of North
American Blackbirds, Orioles, Tanagers, and Allies,” by Arthur
Cleveland Bent; “Studies in Foraminifera,” by Alfred R. Loeblich,
Jr., and collaborators; “The Bromeliaceae of Colombia,” by Lyman
B. Smith; “Archeological Investigations at the Mouth of the Ama-
zon,” by Betty J. Meggers and Clifford Evans; “Orbital Data and
Preliminary Analyses of Satellites 1957 Alpha and 1957 Beta,” by
various authors; and Ars Orientalis, volume 2. Three popular pub-
lications were issued. In all, 530,662 copies of printed matter were
distributed.

Report on the United States National
Museum

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the condi-
tion and operations of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1958 :

COLLECTIONS

Because of the reorganization of the Museum effected at the be-
ginning of the year (as described on p. 48), it was necessary to re-
assign some of the specimens among the now eight departments of
the Museum. This accounts for lower totals in some instances.
Specimens were added to the national collections and distributed
among the departments as follows: Anthropology, 4,373; zoology,
525,458; botany, 57,795; geology, 43,275; armed forces history, 1,283;
arts and manufactures, 230; civil history, 5,858,683; and science and
technology, 3,457. Most of the specimens were received as gifts from
individuals or as transfers from Government departments and agen-
cies. The Annual Report of the Director of the Museum, published
as a separate document, contains a detailed list of the year’s acces-
sions, of which the more important are summarized below. Catalog
entries in all departments now total 50,963,147.

Anthropology.—One of the most unique accessions received in the
department of anthropology is a set of casts of the restorable parts
of a Neanderthal skeleton from northern Iraq. The skeleton casts
of this newly discovered fossil man represent the work of two men in
the department: Dr. Ralph S. Solecki, recently appointed associate
curator in the division of archeology, who made the discovery in his
excavation of Shanidar Cave in northern Iraq; and the curator of
physical anthropology, Dr. T. Dale Stewart, who went to Baghdad,
restored the original skull and long bones, and made plaster replicas.
These casts, the first to reach this country, were donated to the na-
tional collections by the Directorate General of Antiquities, Iraq.

The division of ethnology received a special selection of objects
from Palau in the Caroline Islands through Dr. Delmas Nucker, High
Commissioner, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. This accession
includes a model abai or men’s house, wooden bowls, tortoise-shell
money, and native implements. From the Aaron and Lillie Straus

12
SECRETARY'S REPORT 1}

Foundation, Inc., of Baltimore, the ethnological collections were en-
riched by 148 objects consisting of glass snuff bottles, carved minerals,
and ivory netsukes from China and Japan. The division received as
a gift from Mrs. Elizabeth George a collection from Ethiopia of six
large contemporary oil paintings depicting scenes of battle and of
daily life, an Abyssinian manuscript Bible, silver buttons, and other
objects illustrating Ethiopian craftsmanship in embossing, etching,
and silver-wire filigree.

Of outstanding interest among the year’s accessions in archeology
were two prehistoric specimens from Peru—one, a wooden doll
dressed in native textiles, from the Central Coast, and the other, a
gold mummy mask of the Chimu Period (ca. A.D. 1100), presented
by Mrs. Virginia Morris Pollak. A large series of pottery, stone,
bone, and other artifacts from the Black Widow site, and a smaller
series from the Buffalo Pasture site in Stanley County, S. Dak., repre-
sent the results of River Basin Surveys excavations at two sites that
will be destroyed by the lake created by the Oahe Dam a few miles
north of Pierre. ‘These two collections throw important light on the
native village Indian culture of the Upper Missouri region in the
16th and 17th centuries. Mention should also be made of a large,
well-documented collection of archeological material from 23 States
and the District of Columbia presented by Richard Gates Slattery.

Zoology.—The most important collection of mammals received dur-
ing the year comes from Panama, where Dr. C. O. Handley, Jr., asso-
ciate curator, collected over 1,300 specimens in cooperation with the
Gorgas Memoria] Laboratory. Valuable cetaceans were received
from three different sources: An embalmed pigmy sperm whale
(Hogia) from the Marine Institute of the University of Georgia, the
skull of an Alaskan beaked whale (Ziphius) from Dr. Robert Rausch,
and the complete skeleton of another kind of beaked whale (Mesop-
lodon) from Florida salvaged by John L. Paradiso, museum aide.

Among birds received during the year the following lots are the
most important: 193 specimens from Ghana, collected and presented
by D. W. Lamm, form the Museum’s first sizable collection from that
part of western Africa; 200 skeletons of Rhodesian birds, received
from the Smithsonian Institution, through Dr. A. Wetmore, has
added importantly to our skeletal material; 358 birds from Yukon
Territory, received by transfer from the Arctic Health Research Cen-
ter, through Dr. Laurence Irving, enhances the usefulness of the divi-
sion’s Arctic American material.

Important type specimens received in the division of reptiles and
amphibians include 6 paratypes of Cuban frogs, in exchange from
the Museum of Comparative Zoology; 2 paratypes of lizards from
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

New Guinea and Borneo obtained as an exchange from the Chicago
Natural History Museum; 17 paratypes of Mexican reptiles and am-
phibians from the University of Illinois Museum of Natural History ;
a valuable lot of 128 reptiles and amphibians from Formosa collected
by Naval Medical Research Unit No. 2, and the Museum’s first ex-
ample of a leatherback turtle from Cuba, presented by the Museo
Ignacio Agramonte.

Among fishes received is a cast of the recently discovered living
representative Latimeria chalumnae of the otherwise wholly fossil
coelacanths purchased from the Muséum National d’Histoire Natu-
relle, Paris. ‘This interesting specimen was placed on exhibition.
A collection of 15,897 fresh-water fishes from West Virginia was
presented by Dr. F. J. Schwartz; another lot of 3,398 fishes, mostly
seahorses, was received from Dr. Kirk Strawn; and 1,185 Australian
fishes were received in exchange from Prof. L. R. Rivas of the Uni-
versity of Miami—an important addition to the Museum’s Australian
collections, since it included numerous species not previously rep-
resented here. The New York Zoological Society presented 73 holo-
types and 62 paratypes of tropical fishes, through Dr. William Beebe.

Insect material constitutes the bulk of the year’s accessions numeri-
cally. The largest single lot is the famous Carl J. Drake collection
of Hemiptera, worldwide in scope and comprising over 100,000 speci-
mens and containing more than 1,000 types. The valuable and im-
portant Tippmann collection of wood-boring beetles, Cerambycidae,
comprising 97,830 specimens, was purchased with assistance of a grant
from the National Science Foundation. This material, with 611 holo-
types, 1,415 paratypes, and cotypes, is a useful supplement to the
specimens already in the collections since it originates largely from
regions not heretofore represented. Other important accessions of
insects are the John L. Buys collection of 12,128 leafhoppers
(Homoptera), presented by Mrs. Buys, and the David Dunavan col-
lection of 4,386 North American beetles, presented by Mrs. Dunavan.

The Raymond C. Osburn collection of 3,572 bryozoans, including
145 type lots, together with extensive manuscript notes and microfilm
of Dr. Osburn’s library catalog and bibliography, was presented by
Mrs. Osburn to the division of marine invertebrates. This accession
is an important enrichment of the Museum’s facilities in this area of
research. Other notable accessions include 4,956 miscellaneous in-
vertebrates from the Palau Islands received from the George Vander-
bilt Foundation and the Office of Naval Research, through Dr. F. M.
Bayer; 10,991 specimens from waters off Surinam, transferred from
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; 2,850 crustaceans, largely cope-
pods, chiefly from Africa, containing 2 holotypes and 388 paratypes,
presented by Dr. A. G. Humes; 685 crustaceans, including the holo-

1,600 specimens of marine mollusks from the Palau Islands received
from the George Vanderbilt Foundation and the Office of Naval Re-
search through Dr. F. M. Bayer; 3,550 marine shells collected by Dr.
Cadet Hand on Kapingamarangi Atoll, Caroline Islands, under the
auspices of the Pacific Science Board; and 2,034 specimens from the
Samoan Islands, Palaus, and New Guinea, received from the Academy
of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service transferred to the Museum 113 cephalopods from the Gulf
of Mexico through Harvey R. Bullis, Jr., and 311 land and fresh-
water mollusks of South America were received in exchange from the
Chicago Museum of Natural History.

Botany —The largest gift to the department of botany consists of
10,847 lichens, constituting the personal herbarium of Dr. Mason E.
Hale, Jr., associate curator of the division of cryptogams; most of the
material is from the eastern and southern United States. Another
notable gift received from Dr. José Cuatrecasas, resident investigator
of the department, comprised 1,165 specimens of his own collections
from Colombia, mostly a comprehensive collection of the Hepaticae
(liverworts). These are being studied by Prof. Margaret Fulford, a
principal specialist on the Hepaticae. Other gifts include 162 speci-
mens from William O. Douglas, Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court, representing his personal collection of Himalayan plants, and
1,735 plants of the Philippine Islands collected by Dr. José Vera
Santos and presented by the University of the Philippines. To be
mentioned especially are the 117 samples of diatoms from the Ant-
arctic collected by the British Australian-New Zealand Antarctic Ex-
pedition and presented by the University of Adelaide in Australia.

Dr. Lyman B. Smith, curator of phanerogams, collected 15,133

38 Pliocene brachiopods from Sicily, from Guiseppe Bonafede.

The crinoid collection of Harrell L. Strimple, Bartlesville, Okla.,
was purchased under the Springer fund. This yielded about 21,000
specimens and represents more than 20 years of collecting by Mr.
Strimple, who has made a specialty of Upper Paleozoic crinoids.

Notable among the exchanges are 306 Paleozoic and Mesozoic in-
vertebrate fossils, from the University of Bristol, through Dr. W. F.
Whittard.

The significant accession for the year in the division of vertebrate
paleontology came as a gift through the income of the Walcott fund
bequest, which permitted Dr. C. L. Gazin, curator, and Franklin
Pearce, exhibits specialist, to collect 330 specimens from Middle
Kocene beds of southwestern Wyoming. These include skull and
jaws of the primate Wotharctus tenebrosus and skeletons of the 4-toed
horse Orohippus, the primitive tapir Helaletes, skulls of assorted
rodents, and the large titanothere Palaeosyops. Another gift from
the Walcott fund consists of portions of four tritylodont (mammal-
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

like reptile) skeletons and a protosuchian crocodile collected by Dr.
David Dunkle, curator, and Dr. G. S. Lewis of the U.S. Geological
Survey from Triassic rocks in the Navajo Reservation, Arizona.

An exchange with the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle,
Paris, brought examples of six genera of ray-finned fishes, new to
the collection, from the Triassic of Madagascar and casts of impor-
tant types in the French museum. An important skull of Hryops from
the Permian (Dunkard formation) of southwestern Pennsylvania
was donated by William E. Moran.

Armed Forces history—Among the material accessioned in the
division of military history, the notable items are: A rare Committee
of Safety rampart rifle made at the Rappahannock Forge and a
model 1869 pistol with Allin conversion, one of three known speci-
mens, from the Department of the Army, and the famous Frankfort
Arsenal cartridge collection from Col. Berkeley R. Lewis.

Of much importance is a collection of naval ordnance materials
recovered from the wreck of an unidentified ship which sank on the
reefs of Bermuda about 1595. This rare material of the sixteenth
century included expanding bar shot of lead and wrought iron, spiked
shot that carried tow soaked with tar, which when lighted by the
explosion of the charge in the gun formed an incendiary shot; solid
iron shot of various sizes, musket balls, and the breechblock of an
iron swivel gun.

A built-up model of a warship of the late seventeenth century was
received as a loan from Edwin A. Link. It is believed that the model
itself dates to that period, and it forms a rare and desirable addition
to the exhibition series. Received from the Department of the Navy,
also as a loan, through the Naval Historical Foundation, was a fife
rail which stood by the foremast of the sloop-of-war Hartford, flag-
ship of Admiral Farragut during the actions at Mobile Bay and on
the Mississippi River in the Civil War.

Science and technology—An unusual specimen acquired by the
division of agriculture and wood products is a Mehring foot-power
cow milker donated by Earl J. Waybright. This type of milking
machine was made and sold from the 1890’s into the 1920’s and pro-
vided an inexpensive device that lightened and speeded up the task
of milking for the man with a small herd.

The outstanding accession to the section of wood products is a
group of 1,400 interesting woods of the world, in cane form, known
as the Rudolph Block collection of walking sticks. Mr. Block was
long known as a writer of fiction and articles under his pen name of
Bruno Lessing, and in his travels he gathered woods from the im-
portant worldwide forest regions. These canes represent the gems of
the wood world and were presented by the Yale University School
of Forestry.

sion marine steam engine, built in 1906 by the Dodge Brothers, was
received from the University of Michigan. The Boeing Airplane
Co. sectioned for display purposes a small gas turbine, which was
transferred to the Museum by the Department of the Navy.

The most significant accession acquired in the division of medical
sciences is the transparent manikin of a woman which shows by
electronic devices, light, and sound the location of the major organs
of the human body and explains their functions. This exhibit was
obtained from the Deutsches Gesundheits Museum. A collection of
gas-oxygen machines, inhalers, and hypodermic syringes was donated
by W. Harry Archer, D.D.S., an authority on Horace Wells, pri-
mary discoverer of anesthesia. Another outstanding acquisition is
a group of unusually rare ceramic drug jars donated by the Bristol-
Myers Co. The collection included a 13th-century Rhages (Persia)
albarello and a 13th-century Rakka (Mesopotamia) albarello, as well
as a 15th-century Hispano-Moresque majolica drug container and
an early 16th-century Faenza (Italy) dragonspout ewer.

The division of physical sciences acquired specimens to fill the
gaps in its collection of scientific instruments. Among these is a set
of apparatus for demonstrating the mechanical powers presented by
Middlebury College, a fine vacuum pump from Bowdoin College, an
18th-century chemical furnace from Williams College, the famous
set of tuning forks from the United States Military Academy, and a
fine Oertling assay balance from Wheaton College.

Outstanding accessions in the division of transportation are rare
builders’ half-models, including an Eastern Shore of Maryland fish-
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

ing launch, dated about 1913, donated by James B. Richardson, and
the model of a motor garvey from southern New Jersey, donated by
the builder, W. R. Main. Other specimens of note are a working
scale model of an Italian coal-fired locomotive with tender, flatcar,
extra assemblies, and spare parts, donated by Richard D. Boutros,
and the Bayly gig, which has been on loan by the heirs of the Bayly
and Orem families for a number of years.

Arts and manufactures —A significant acquisition in the division
of textiles is a reconstructed model of John Hargreave’s spinning
jenny. This model, which demonstrates Hargreave’s original con-
ception, was built in the Exhibits Laboratory by Robert Sampson
from the specifications in Hargreave’s patent of 1770. An interest-
ing collection of handwoven fabrics made in the South during the
Civil War was presented by Mrs. N. C. Browder. A beautiful and
rare cashmere shawl with a turquoise center was presented by Miss

tings of the Stohlman Confectionery Shop originally installed in
Georgetown, D.C., in 1900. This remarkable accession with its ice-
cream parlor, its ornate cabinetwork, candy jars, fancy ice-cream
molds, and countless other minutiae will serve to document a pic-
turesque phase of late Victorian urban life. A complete set of orig-
inal furnishings from a 19th-century parlor in a Thomaston, Maine,
house was donated by the Misses Helen R. and Elizabeth W. New-
combe. The carpet, mirror, sofas, and side chairs will make it pos-
sible to reproduce authentically the parlor of a rural Victorian

EXPLORATION AND FIELDWORK

Documentary research revealed the existence of an 18th-century
courthouse on the south bank of Potomac Creek across from Mar]-
borough Town, Va. To verify the 1743 land survey and to locate
and determine the type of structure, F. M. Setzler, head curator, de-
partment of anthropology, directed archeological excavations on the
Williams site south of Stony Point. During the week of August
19-28, 1957, in collaboration with C. Malcolm Watkins, acting curator
of cultural history, and Prof. Oscar Darter of Mary Washington
College, Fredericksburg, Va., he exposed the brick foundation of a
T-shaped building, which in genera! outline and size resembled the
1780 type of courthouses, such as those now extant in Hanover, King
William, and Charles City Counties, Va. This project is one phase
of a research program begun in 1956 at Marlborough Town.

During the period October 7 to November 22, 1957, Head Curator
Setzler excavated the Welcome Mound along the Ohio River in West
Virginia. The excavation of this large prehistoric Indian mound
was made possible through the generous cooperation of the Colum-
bia-Southern Chemical Corporation, on whose property the mound
was located. The company furnished laborers, bulldozer, an en-
gineer, and laboratory facilities. The mound measured 110 feet in
diameter and 20 feet in height. Even though the quantity of arti-
facts was limited, the quality exceeded objects from other mounds
of this cultural horizon. On the basis of potsherds and projectile
points, Welcome Mound is classified as a middle Adena site represent-
ing a period of approximately 500 B.C. The most important artifact
recovered was a carved effigy tubular smoking pipe in the form of a
shoveler duck’s head and neck, found at the right knee of one of the
adult skeletons. Two others were buried at the base of the mound.
In the mouth cavity of one of these skeletons the canine tooth of a
mountain lion was found. Based on evidence from other Adena
mounds, this tooth could indicate that the body had been interred
wearing a mountain-lion facial mask. In connection with this archeo-
logical research program, Mr. Setzler visited the Ohio State Museum,
Columbus, and the University of Kentucky Museum, Lexington, from
April 28 to May 4, 1958, to examine and study the collections of
archeological material excavated from other Adena mounds in those
States. He also examined collections from other prehistoric cultural
levels looking toward the future medernization of the Museum’s ex-
hibition halls pertaining to American archeology.

From October 9, 1957, to January 14, 1958, Dr. T. Dale Stewart,
curator of physical anthropology, was in Baghdad, Iraq, restoring,
studying, and making casts of the Neanderthal skeleton that had been
discovered in Shanidar Cave, northern Iraq, by Dr. Ralph S. Solecki
SECRETARY’S REPORT 23

in 1957 prior to his joining the Museum’s staff as an associate curator
in Old World archeology. Dr. Stewart, invited by the Iraqian Gov-
ernment to repair and restore the skuli and postcranial skeleton, not
only found it more complex than anticipated but also discovered that
owing to an injury of the brachial plexus the right shoulder and arm
of the 45,000-year-old Neanderthaler had been paralyzed. This
paralysis caused the right humerus to atrophy. The distal end and
forearm were missing. After completing this difficult task of restor-
ing a badly broken skull, Dr. Stewart made a mold and plaster casts.
He was permitted by the Iraqian Government to bring one of the
casts to the Smithsonian Institution, the first to reach this country.
On his return trip to Washington he visited with physical anthropolo-
gists in Turkey, Rome, France, and England, all of whom were
pleased to examine the cast of the Shanidar skull.

In connection with his long-range research program of compara-
tive studies of Micronesian material culture, Dr. S. H. Riesenberg,
acting curator of ethnology, spent two weeks examining and studying
the Micronesian collections at the Peabody Museum, Salem, Mass.;
Dartmouth Museum, Hanover, N. H.; and Fairbanks Museum, St.
Johnsbury, Vt. The Peabody Museum collections include some of
the objects collected by the first Europeans to explore these islands.
While in Chicago during Christmas week he made a similar survey
of Micronesian artifacts at the Chicago Natural History Museum.
This trip enabled him to interview several specialists in African eth-
nology in respect to the appointment of an associate curator for his
division.

While attending meetings of the American Anthropological As-
sociation in Chicago during Christmas week, Dr. Clifford Evans, as-
sociate curator in archeology, examined the archeological collections
excavated at Cuenca in the highlands of Ecuador by Dr. Donald
Collier and found pottery types similar to those excavated on the
Rio Babahoyo along the coast of Ecuador. From May 11 through
17 Dr. Evans visited Peabody Museum, Cambridge, Mass., the
American Museum of Natural History, and the Museum of the
American Indian, New York City, to compare the pottery he and Dr.
Meggers excavated on the Rio Napo in Ecuador, and from sites on
the middle Amazon excavated by Peter P. Hilbert, with that from
sites in eastern Peru. This constitutes one phase of a long-range
program of archeological research in South America.

Dr. M. T. Newman, associate curator of physical anthropology,
spent two days at Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pa.,
conferring with Drs. H. Schraer and P. Baker of the Bone Density
Research and Evaluation Center in connection with the data he

492520—59——_3
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

accumulated at Hacienda Vicos, Callejon de Huaylas, North Central
Sierra, Peru.

The Museum’s new associate curator in Old World archeology, Dr.
Ralph Solecki, attended an interdisciplinary symposium at the Uni-
versity of Chicago’s Oriental Institute from May 8 to 11. This
meeting emphasized the contributions that can be made by zoologists,
agronomists, geologists, and other specialists in solving problems
arising from the excavation of Neolithic and Paleolithic archeologi-
cal sites. The Shanidar Cave, in Iraq, excavated by Dr. Solecki, pro-
duced evidence of a very stable animal population over a period of
100,000 years. He reported that the evidence from Shanidar Cave
showed that the earliest animal and plant domestication probably
took place within the past 12,000 years.

Assistant Curator of Ethnology R. A. Elder, Jr., spent a day in
February and one in April selecting and transporting an unusual col-
lection of Asiatic and Far Eastern objects from Baltimore, Md., do-
nated to the national collections by the Aaron and Lillie Straus
Foundation, Inc.

C. V. Morton, acting curator of cryptogams, again participated
in the American Fern Society field trip, and from August 21 to 25
collected ferns from Stanford University north along the Redwood
highway to Eureka, Calif. He also attended the meetings of the
American Institute of Biological Sciences at Stanford University.

From October 8 to December 28, 1957, Dr. Egbert H. Walker,
associate curator of phanerogams, traveled to Japan, Okinawa,
Taiwan, Thailand, Viet Nam, and the Philippines. He participated
in the Ninth Pacific Science Congress in Bangkok, and enroute ex-
amined, studied, and collected plants in Japan, Okinawa, and Taiwan,
in preparation of a manuscript on the flora of Okinawa and the
southern Ryukyus.

Dr. Mason E. Hale, associate curator of cryptogams, spent several
days in October examining collections of West Indian lichens at
Harvard University, Wellesley College, Yale University, and the
Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Dr. Hale also col-
lected lichens in Virginia, North Carolina, and the coastal plain of
Florida. While in Florida during April he participated in the an-
nual meeting of the Association of Southeastern Biologists at
Tallahassee.

In August 1957 and again in May 1958, Dr. Richard S. Cowan,
associate curator of phanerogams, spent several days at the New
York Botanical Garden checking manuscripts with plant collections
and completing his portion of the Index Nomina Genericorum.

In September 1957, Dr. Herbert Friedmann, acting head curator of
zoology, attended the annual meeting of the American Ornitholo-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 25

gists’ Union at Cape May, N.J. In November he studied and de-
scribed the African viduine weaverbirds at Yale University and
the American Museum of Natural History in order to complete his
manuscript on this group.

On June 4, 1958, Dr. Henry W. Setzer, associate curator of mam-
mals, returned from an extended field trip in North Africa. The
first 2 weeks of May he spent excavating burrows of rodents in the
vicinity of Wadi Natroun, Faiyum Province, and near the village of
Abu Rawash. From May 17 to 24 he collected mammals in the
vicinity of St. Catherine’s Monastery in southern Sinai. The last
week was spent in the Delta and eastern desert region.

From January 15 to March 15, 1958, Dr. Charles O. Handley, Jr.,
associate curator of mammals, continued his mammal survey of
Panama, which yielded over 700 specimens of mammals. Several
species new to Panama were collected, and evidence was obtained to
show that there is more mingling of South and Central American
faunas in the isthmus than was heretofore suspected. In November
1957 Dr. Handley studied the greater and lesser pigmy sperm whales
at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard and at the Ameri-
can Museum of Natural History. In September 1957 he spent 2
weeks with museum aides J. L. Paradiso and B. R. Feinstein collect-
ing smal] mammals along the Clinch Mountain range in southwestern
Virginia. In March 1958 Mr. Paradiso roughed out and shipped to
the Museum from Vero Beach, Fla., the skeleton of a beaked whale.

From July 5 to August 4, 1957, Dr. J. F. Gates Clarke, curator
of insects, visited Europe principally to pack and ship a large col-
lection of insects assembled by Eng. F. Tippmann in Vienna,
Austria. In England he conferred with the entomologists at the
British Museum. In January 1958 Dr. Clarke spent 2 days at St.
Lawrence University, Canton, N.Y., where he acquired the John
Buys collection of leafhoppers (Cicadellidae), which contains speci-
mens from Formosa and new forms from Honduras heretofore not
represented in the Museum. On May 5, 1958, he returned from an
extensive collecting trip on the Smithsonian-Bredin Caribbean Ex-
pedition. He accompanied the leader of the expedition, Dr. Waldo
L. Schmitt, former head curator of zoology, and now research associ-
ate. ‘This expedition was made possible through the continued gen-
erosity of Mr. and Mrs. J. Bruce Bredin, of Greenville, Del. For 6
weeks the scientists were enabled to collect zoological specimens among
the Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles.

Two and a half weeks were spent by Dr. R. E. Crabill, Jr., associate
curator of insects, studying type specimens at Harvard and collect-
ing myriapods and spiders in Massachusetts, Vermont, and the Lake
Placid section of New York.
26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

Dr. L. P. Schultz, curator of fishes, spent 2 weeks in November
1957 repacking and shipping the Col. John K. Howard collection of
fishes at the University of Miami, Fla. Enroute Dr. Schultz visited
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service laboratories and university lab-
oratories in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.
From April 7 to 11, 1958, Dr. Schultz attended a symposium in
New Orleans, La., on the attacks made by sharks.

Dr. Alexander Wetmore, research associate, represented the Smith-
sonian Institution at the Pan African Ornithological Congress, held
at Livingstone, Northern Rhodesia, from July 15 to 20, 1957. Over
200 persons were in attendance, including delegates from several coun-
tries of western Europe and from the United States, in addition to
those engaged in investigations in this field in the various countries
of Africa. The occasion was especially important as it was the first
meeting of the kind on that continent. Enroute to the Congress
there was opportunity to cross through the Wankie Game Reserve
and afterward to spend 6 days observing the birds and mammals of
the Kruger National Park. Following this Dr. Wetmore visited
scientific institutions and laboratories in Johannesburg, Pretoria,
Durban, and Capetown, Union of South Africa, and had 3 days for
observations near Dakar in Senegal. He returned to Washington
via Lisbon on August 13.

In January 1958 he returned to Panama to continue field investi-
gations of the birdlife of the Isthmus. Through the kindness of
H. V. T. Mais, agent for the Chiriqui Land Co. in Panama, and
G. D. Munch, manager of the Bocas del Toro Division of that com-
pany, arrangement had been made for quarters in Almirante, Prov-
ince of Bocas del Toro, an area not previously visited. This is an im-
portant region for study because of species of birds found farther
north along the Caribbean that here enter Panama and reach their
southern limits in this section. Field equipment was shipped on
January 13 by Cessna-180 4-passenger plane since the airport serving
Almirante at the town of Bocas del Toro was closed temporarily to
larger aircraft. There is no true dry season in this section of Pan-
ama, and rains came almost daily. While the higher areas of level
land had been cleared for cultivation, forest remained over extensive
sections of swamp, and on the hills bordering small stream valleys,
as well as on the large islands in Almirante Bay.

Fieldwork continued here 2 months, with a trip each week up the
line of railroad into the banana plantations that extend from the
Changuinola River to Guabito on the Costa Rican border. Travel
elsewhere from Almirante was mainly by dugout canoe powered by an
outboard motor, with occasional trips with friends in other craft. T.
W. Dunn was especially helpful through his knowledge of Almirante
SECRETARY’S REPORT 27

Bay gained through fishing excursions. And in the Changuinola
area Roy Roig gave important aid. A nesting colony of red-billed
tropicbirds on Swan Cay in the Caribbean outside the entrance of the
pass Boca del Drago, and another of Audubon’s shearwaters on Tiger
Rock off Chiriqui Point at the end of the Valiente Peninsula, were of
particular interest since these are the only locations known for these
birds in the western Caribbean. ‘Through the help of Mr. Munch in
providing a larger launch, collections were made for 2 days on the
island Escudo de Veraguas 10 miles off the base of the Valiente
Peninsula. A wren, a manakin, and a spiny rat obtained here are
forms previously unknown to science, marked particularly by much
larger size, compared to their relatives on the mainland.

On return to the Canal Zone on March 10 Dr. Wetmore was occupied
the following 2 weeks with further collecting in the savanna areas of
Coclé and in the Province of Panama, including 3 days at La Jagua,
east of Pacora, where the first cattle egrets to be collected in Panama
were taken. ‘This heron has been seen here for 2 years past and ap-
pears now to be fully established. Work for the season ended with
return by air to Washington on March 29.

During September 1957 and again in May 1958 Dr. G. A. Cooper,
head curator of geology, accompanied by R. E. Grant, research as-
sistant, carried forward his long-range research program of solving
the stratigraphic sequence in the Glass Mountains, especially Leonard
Mountain near Marathon in west Texas. Last fall they were for-
tunate in establishing a direct paleontological sequence as well as ob-
taining evidence to show that the big limestones in the Leonard
formation join the basal formation to become a single limestone east
of Sullivan Peak. In May they traced this particular key bed across
the mountain. An effort was made to collect special material for in-
clusion in the modernization of an invertebrate paleontological ex-
hibit hall. In November 1957 Dr. Cooper delivered his presidential
address before the Paleontological Society in Atlantic City, N.J. He
spent several days in Boston the latter part of March examining and
studying Silurian, Devonian, and Recent brachiopods at Harvard
University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

From July 12 to August 9 Dr. C. L. Gazin, curator of vertebrate
paleontology, and exhibits specialist F. L. Pearce prospected for and
collected vertebrate fossils in the eastern, central, and western por-
tions of the Bridger Basin around Green River and Lyman, Wyo.
Good results were obtained between Smiths Fork and Blacks Fork.
A rare skull and skeletal material of the Eocene horse Orohippus
were recovered. Dr. Gazin spent a week after August 9 at the Los
Angeles County Museum studying the Eocene collections recently
transferred from the California Institute of Technology. Early in
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

November 1957 he attended the annual meeting of the Society of
Vertebrate Paleontology in Philadelphia, Pa., and the Geological
Society of America meetings in Atlantic City, N.J. During the
first week of December Dr. Gazin studied Eocene and Oligocene col-
lections at Princeton, N.J., and the American Museum of Natural
History. In February 1958 he studied middle Eocene mammalian
collections from the Green River beds of northeastern Utah at the
Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh, Pa.

During September 1957 E. P. Henderson, associate curator of
mineralogy and petrology, accompanied by photographer Jack Scott,
made an extensive trip in order to study the morphology and surface
features of meteorites and to photograph large collections. They
spent some time going west and also on their return east at the
Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, witnessing the cut-
ting operation of the Grant, N. Mex., meteorite. Meteoritic iron
requires much more time to cut than one anticipates. These cut sec-
tions will enable the specialist to study the thermal penetration.
Henderson and Scott examined and photographed the meteorites at
the University of Kansas, Iowa State College and the State Univer-
sity of Iowa, Chicago Natural History Museum, and Wooster and
Marietta Colleges in Ohio. These studies are especially important
now that manmade satellites are being placed in outer space. Mr.
Henderson spent 2 days in May examining the meteorite collection
in the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. He also acquired
new material for the Museum’s collections.

Dr. D. H. Dunkle, associate curator of vertebrate paleontology,
spent 2 days in October 1957 studying various Mesozoic teleostean
fishes in the Bayet collection of the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh.
In March 1958 he devoted 2 days to the study of a restricted group of
elopoid fishes from the Cope collection at the American Museum of
Natural History.

In the company of two paleontologists of the U.S. Geological
Survey, Dr. Richard S. Boardman, associate curator of invertebrate
paleontology and paleobotany, spent 6 days in the fall of 1957 collect-
ing bryozoans, brachiopods, and corals from all the stratigraphic
zones of middle Devonian rocks along the falls of the Ohio River. Dr.
Boardman attended the annual meeting of the Geological Society of
America in Atlantic City, and in March 1958 he purchased some well-
documented rhomboporoid Bryozoa collected from the middle Devo-
nian Hamilton rocks of the Buffalo, N.Y., area.

Dr. Porter M. Kier, associate curator of invertebrate paleontology
and paleobotany, spent several days in October 1957 examining and
studying Paleozoic echinoid collections at Yale University and Har-
vard University. Here he discovered several type specimens never
SECRETARY’S REPORT 29

before recorded and four specimens which represent a new genus.
Dr. Kier also attended the meetings of the Geological Society of
America in Atlantic City.

In October 1957 Dr. Peter P. Vaughn, associate curator of verte-
brate paleontology, spent 3 days collecting tetrapods and the skulls
of the rare nectridian Diploceraspis from the upper Mississippian
formation near Greer, W. Va., and the Dunkard series, lower Per-
mian formation of northern West Virginia and southwestern Pennsy]-
vania. In November 1957 and again in February 1958 he spent
several days at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard
University and the American Museum of Natural History examining
and studying fossil amphibians, reptiles, and Permian vertebrates.
From March 15 to May 17, 1958, Dr. Vaughn, accompanied by ex-
hibits worker John E. Ott of the division of vertebrate paleontology
and ranger naturalist R. Donald Widman of the National Park
Service, carried forward an extensive paleontological research pro-
gram in Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado. Their prin-
cipal objective was collecting fishes, amphibians, and reptiles in the
Permian beds. Several hundred pounds of fossils reached the Mu-
seum as a result of their explorations.

The administrative reorganization of July 1, 1957, created two
units under the United States National Museum, namely the Museum
of Natural History and the Museum of History and Technology. The
staff comprising the latter unit found it necessary to visit many of
the museums, universities, and private collectors in order to exam-
ine, study, purchase, and accept a variety of objects for the new
museum. Every effort was made by the many recently employed
specialists to acquire outstanding examples to illustrate their subject-
matter fields. At the same time every opportunity was taken to per-
fect their program of exhibition. Only the more important phases of
this fieldwork and travel program are here noted:

The Director of the Museum of History and Technology, Frank A.
Taylor, made three important trips in connection with the acquisition
of objects and the use of modern display methods as well as television
facilities for the new museum under construction.

In keeping with the previous program of examining new exhibits
and acquiring important apparatus to illustrate the development of
the physical sciences, Dr. Robert P. Multhauf, head curator of science
and technology, completed extensive field trips. From September
15 to October 21 he visited various museums in Denver, Colo.; San
Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, Nevada City, Calif.;
Ames and Jowa City, Iowa; Purdue University, Lafayette, Ind.;
and Marietta, Ohio; and participated in a seminar on the history of
science at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. In December
30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

1957 he spent 2 days examining old chemical apparatus in the depart-
ment of chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, with a view to ac-
quiring the objects for the exhibits in the Museum of History and
Technology. He also examined some of the rare physics apparatus
at West Point and Columbia University. In January 1958 he ex-
amined historic astronomical apparatus at Case Institute in Cleve-
land. Since the College of William and Mary at Williamsburg was
one of the first in this country to offer instruction in science, Dr. Mult-
hauf spent 2 days there with Professor Pittman and President A. D.
Chandler examining some of the old apparatus used in the teaching
of physics. In April he visited Johns Hopkins University with a
view to acquiring a balance and gas heating device associated with
Ira Remsen. In the department of mineralogy and geology he ex-
plored the possibility of obtaining an early polarizing microscope.

As consultant to the department of engineering for locating 19th-
century chemical and physical laboratory apparatus to illustrate these
disciplines in the new Museum of History and Technology, Dr. Derek
J. Price again made numerous trips to museums, colleges, univers!-
ties, and laboratories. In September 1957 Dr. Price supervised the
transfer of three machines pertaining to Henry Fitz, telescope maker,
in 1850. These machines, together with his tools, speculum blanks,
and many smaller items, should enable the Smithsonian to reconstruct
in the Museum of History and Technology a vivid workshop of
Henry Fitz. In the department of chemistry at Williams College
he was pleased to find a rare cylindrical charcoal-burning chemical
furnace made about 1830. This furnace is similar to those used
centuries before. In the various colleges and universities visited
Dr. Price made several detailed inventories of chemical and physi-
cal apparatus which he regarded as worthy of consideration
for planned exhibits in the Museum of History and Technology.

The curator of the division of mechanical and civil engineering,
Eugene S. Ferguson, attended the annual meeting of the American
Society of Too] Engineers, May 5-7, 1958.

From March 24 to April 2 Howard I. Chapelle, curator of trans-
portation, visited museums, collectors, and model-ship builders in
Mystic and Essex, Conn.; Providence, R.I.; Nantucket Island; and
Salem, Quincy, and Boston, Mass. This trip will prove valuable
in connection with the future exhibits of watercraft in the Museum
of History and Technology.

William N. Watkins, curator of agriculture and wood products,
spent the last week of September and early October studying wood
collections and logging dioramas at the College of Forestry, Syracuse
University, and the Adirondack Museum at Blue Mountain Lake,
N.Y. On February 24, 1958, Mr. Watkins conferred with Prof.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 31

E.S. Harrar at Duke University School of Forestry, Durham, N.C.,
and studied microscopically many wood sections.

Numerous trips were made by the acting curator of electricity,
W. J. King, in an attempt to acquire original examples and models
of early electrical equipment for the Museum of History and Tech-
nology. In July he visited Great Barrington, Mass., to collect data
on George Stanley and his 1886 installation of an AC power system.
At Pittsfield he conferred with a descendant of S. F. B. Morse, the
inventor of the telegraph. At Philadelphia he examined the
Franklin Institute’s stored collection of early electrical apparatus.
In the fall and winter Mr. King spent some time in Philadelphia,
New York City, and Schenectady, as well as at Princeton and Brown
Universities. In May 1958 he spent several days in New York and
New Jersey, especially at the R.C.A. plants and offices conferring
with General Sarnoff and other members of his staff. Much time
and study were devoted to identification of original electrical ap-
paratus and going over notebooks of famous inventors such as
Langmuir, Elihu Thomson, Morse, and Stanley.

On October 2, 1957, George B. Griffenhagen, curator of medical
sciences, accepted for the Smithsonian Institution a collection of
rare antique drug jars donated by the Bristol-Myers Co. in New York
City. On January 10, while returning from New York, Mr. Griffen-
hagen examined an early pharmaceutical tablet press which will be
donated to the division by Wyeth Laboratories. From March 24 to
27, 1958, he examined pharmaceutical and medical exhibits in Chicago
and participated in the dedication of an 1890 drugstore restoration
at the Wisconsin State Historical Society in Madison, Wis. In
April he attended meetings of the American Institute of the History
of Pharmacy and American Pharmaceutical Association Section on
Historical Pharmacy in Los Angeles, Calif.

During the past year, E. A. Battison, associate curator of mechan-
ical and civil engineering, made several trips throughout the New
England States, as well as New York and Pennsylvania, examining,
collecting, and studying numerous private collections of clocks and
watches ranging from the early handmade wooden clocks to the most
recent electric watch. In addition to this special field, Mr. Battison
examined and collected early machine tools, iron planer lathes, and
locks.

On May 12 and 13 Kenneth M. Perry, associate curator of trans-
portation, acquired a valuable collection of early marine engines,
propellers, models, harpoon heads, tools, and boat drawings assembled
by Otis A. Palmer, East Moriches, Long Island, N.Y.

From February 23 to March 1, E. C. Kendall, associate curator
of agriculture and wood products, visited Hadley, Mass., Coopers-
32 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

town, N.Y., and Kinzers, Pa., to examine and collect early examples
of various types of farm machinery.

At the invitation of Dr. J. Stainman, a practicing optometrist,
Associate Curator of Medical Sciences Dr. John B. Blake obtained a
large collection of refracting instruments for the Smithsonian In-
stitution on August 26,1957. In September Dr. Blake spent several
days in Boston and Salem, Mass., and New York City inspecting
and studying collections relating to all phases of medical history.
On October 10, 1957, he acquired a 35-year-old General Electric port-
able X-ray machine in Baltimore, Md. On December 4 and 5 he
examined, with a view to acquiring for the Museum of History and
Technology, old dental instruments from the School of Dentistry
at the University of Pennsylvania. In New York City and Long
Island he obtained two cases of anesthesia material from the Wood
Museum and Dr. W. H. Archer of Pittsburgh, Pa. From March
16 to 22, 1958, he visited the Cleveland Health Museum and the Dit-
trich Museum of Natural History examining a large collection of
medical instruments; and then proceeded to Chicago where he studied
collections at the International College of Surgeons Hall of Fame,
the Chicago Historical Society, and other museums.

Robert M. Vogel, assistant curator of mechanical and civil en-
gineering, spent considerable time throughout the year visiting the
engineering schools in numerous universities and important engineer-
ing plants inventorying and selecting examples of 19th- and early
20th-century material for the planned exhibits in the new Museum
of History and Technology.

From October 25 to November 4, 1957, the head curator of arts
and manufactures, Dr. P. W. Bishop, was in the vicinity of Pitts-
burgh, Pa., Chicago, Ill., and Dearborn, Mich., endeavoring to de-
termine the type of engine used by Drake in his 1858-59 oil drilling.
In Chicago, Dr. Bishop received excellent cooperation from the Re-
search Plant of Universal Oil Products in planning exhibit models
showing various types of catalytic cracking units. In September
he spent a day at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
another at Lakeville, Conn.

The curator of graphic arts, Jacob Kainen, spent September 9 to
13 in Cleveland looking toward the acquisition of early silk-screen
stencil printing. He also continued his research on J. B. Jackson,
going over references and prints by this artist.

During December 11 to 14, 1957, Miss Grace L. Rogers, acting
curator of textiles, studied various phases of the textile collection
of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the exhibit at Amateur
Needlework of Today, Inc., in New York City. She also conferred
with the donor of an old Jacquard loom now being assembled. After
SECRETARY’S REPORT 33

several conferences Miss Rogers has received the cooperation of sev-
eral wool, cotton, silk, and manmade-fiber institutes and associations
in supplying material for the new textile exhibits planned for the
Museum of History and Technology. In the latter part of March
1958 Miss Rogers studied exhibit techniques and storage facilities
at Winterthur Museum, Wilmington, Del. From May 4 to 7, 1958,
she had the unique experience of examining a 8-story woolen mill just
outside Excelsior Springs, north of Kansas City, Mo. This mill,
known as the Watkins Woolen Mill, was closed in 1886, yet remained
completely undisturbed up to the day of Miss Rogers’ visit when
the property was auctioned. She therefore had an opportunity to
examine a middle 19th-century woolen mill even to the extent of
seeing the original machines standing in the same position as they
were in 1886, and in many instances the original leather belts were
still attached to the main drive shafts.

In September 1957 and again in March 1958 Paul V. Gardner,
acting curator of ceramics and glass, visited museums and collector-
dealers in New York City. He examined numerous collections of
porcelain, glass, and enamels which will assist in identification of
objects in his division; studied various methods of exhibition; and
visited with philanthropical collectors who may present objects from
their collections to the Smithsonian Institution. From May 21 to 27
Mr. Gardner examined European porcelain and china-trade items
at the Worcester Art Museum. He also visited collectors in Canton,
Norwood, Newbury, Middleton, Sturbridge, and Boston, Mass.

The head curator of civil history, Dr. Anthony N. B. Garvan, spent
January 29, 1958, examining the well-documented Edward Andrews
collection of Shaker material objects in New Haven, Conn. In Feb-
ruary he visited Girard College in Philadelphia where he was given
an opportunity to examine the Girard memorabilia. This collection
represents an exceptional group of late Colonial and early Repub-
lican examples of the history of taste. It depicts Girard’s nostalgia
for France, pride in American achievements, and his hobbies of music
and numismatics. In April Dr. Garvan was in New York City
examining collections and consulting with experts on several phases
of the new exhibits under his jurisdiction.

On June 3 and 4, 1958, the acting curator of political history,
Dr. Wilcomb E. Washburn, together with assistant curators Charles
G. Dorman and Mrs. Anne W. Murray and museum aide James Chan-
ning, visited the Chester County Historical Society, West Chester,
Pa., Brandywine Battlefield State Park, Winterthur Museum, and the
Hagley Museum in Delaware. This provided the staff with excep-
tional opportunities to examine collections, study preservation tech-
niques, and observe methods used in preparing exhibits.
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

C. Malcolm Watkins, acting curator of cultural history, in col-
Jaboration with the head curator of anthropology, F. M. Setzler, and
Prof. Oscar Darter of Mary Washington College in Fredericks-
burg, made considerable progress on the excavation of an 18th-cen-
tury courthouse and 17th-century documentary research related to
Marlborough Town, Va. The archeological excavations revealed the
foundations of a T-shaped structure comparable to those well-preserved
18th-century courthouses at Hanover, King William, and Charles
City Counties, Va. In September Mr. Watkins spent several days
searching documents at the Virginia State Library, Richmond, in
connection with the 1956 excavations at Marlborough Town, and a
mass of data concerning John Mercer and his mansion and estate
at Marlborough. On November 30, 1957, he discovered a 1744-49
ledger of John Mercer at the Bucks County Historical Society,
Doylestown, Pa. This important document provides very pertinent
information for the interpretation of the Marlborough site. In Oc-
tober Mr. Watkins spent several days visiting various museums in
connection with his long-range research program in the documenta-
tion of 17th-century pottery. He spent December 4, 1957, at Winter-
thur, Wilmington, Del., examining room interiors for consideration
in plans of exhibition in the Museum of History and Technology.

Throughout the year Francis J. McCall, assistant curator of phi-
lately and postal history, made numerous trips to eastern sections of
the country attending national and local philatelic meetings, display-
ing selected postal material from the national collections, and describ-
ing present and future programs in the division of philately.

The curator of numismatics, Dr. V. Clain-Stefanelli, traveled ex-
tensively in order to acquaint professional and amateur coin collectors
with the program, plans, and needs of his division. During the latter
part of August and again in December he conferred with Mrs. Rae V.
Biester, superintendent of the United States Mint in Philadelphia.
During September he interviewed various State bank commissioners
in Connecticut. At Yale University he examined the famous Garvan
collection of gold coins and conferred with the deputy keeper of coins
of the British Museum. In October he attended several numismatic
meetings and studied various aspects of ancient coining techniques at
the Fogg Art Museum in Boston. From May 20 to 24, 1958, Dr.
Stefanelli visited Ottawa where he interviewed officials at the British
American Bank Note Co., the Bank of Canada, Canadian Archives,
and the Canadian Mint. In the Canadian Archives he examined a
rare 1792 Indian Peace Medal. At the mint he examined coins, medals,
and special decorations. As a result of his visit, the division will
receive a special set of mint coins. In June he visited the headquarters
of the Georgia State Bank in Atlanta, as well as Dahloneya, site of the
old United States branch mint,
SECRETARY’S REPORT 35

The associate curator of political history, Mrs. Margaret B. Klap-
thor, visited James Goodin of Reiglesville, Pa., where she inspected
authentic costumes of President Madison’s family, especially the re-
cently discovered dress, shoes, gloves, and turban of Dolley Madison.
In New York City she accepted delivery of Lincoln relics offered to
the museum by Lincoln Isham.

Charles G. Dorman, assistant curator of political history, visited
Albany Institute of History; the home of Gen. Philip Schuyler in
Albany; Fort Crailo in Rensselaer, N.Y.; Bennington Historical Mu-
seum; Shelburne Museum near Burlington, Vt.; and other historic
houses in New England. In February 1948 he carried forward
research at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

From September 23 to 27, 1957, the associate curator of cultural
history, G. Carroll Lindsay, examined archives in Richmond, Isle of
Wight, and Southampton courthouses in order to document the panel-
ing now on exhibition in the Virginia Room. He established owner-
ship of the property from the time of the original patent in the 17th
century. He spent March 30 to April 4, 1958, in Alton, IIl., selecting
objects from a large collection of decorative art objects of the Victorian
period (1850-1915) which had been willed to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution by the late Miss Daisy Templin and donated by her living
brother, Roger Pryor Templin. On June 10 Mr. Lindsay acquired at
the Parke-Bernet Galleries a life-size cigar-store Indian princess
through the generosity of Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post May.

Miss Rodris C. Roth, assistant curator of cultural history, spent
October 25 to November 4, 1957, in Boston, Salem, Worcester, New-
buryport, Mass., and New York City studying period rooms and deco-
rative arts related to American and English interior decorations in
the 17th, 18th, and early 19th centuries.

The head curator of armed forces history, Mendel L. Peterson,
spent 8 days in September 1957 probing the Pamunkey River, 25
miles northeast of Richmond, to locate a shipwreck believed to have
been sunk during General McClellan’s drive on Richmond in 1862.
Together with a professional diver, Mr. Peterson found the wreck
in 15 feet of muddy water. By the use of anchor chains, to prevent
injury to themselves, they were able to examine and partially identify
the vessel. Thus far no documentation concerning the sinking of
such a vessel has been discovered in Civil War archives. The hull
measured at least 200 feet in length; it was burned before sinking;
the bow section had broken away from the hull probably through an
explosion of gunpowder or boiler. A few days in February and
again in March Mr. Peterson studied archival records at the New
York Public Library and consulted with Edwin A. Link on plans
for a continuation of their program of underwater salvage of historic
vessels.
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

In September 1957 E. M. Howell, acting curator of military history,
spent 8 days in Chicago and Milwaukee studying collections of arms
and armor at various museums. In March 1958 he visited the Metro-
politan Museum of Art and New York Historical Society examining
collections of powderhorns, Colt revolvers, Revolutionary War Brit-
ish insignia, and colonial-type armor.

Through an exchange the Museum acquired an 1866 model Gatling
gun, which was examined and reported upon by Craddock R. Goins,
Jr., assistant curator of military history. Late in January 1958
Mr. Goins made an extensive trip to the major firearms manufactur-
ing firms in the vicinity of Bridgeport, New Haven, and Hartford,
Conn., and Springfield and Chicopee Falls, Mass.

John E. Anglim, supervisory exhibits specialist, spent 2 days in
Williamsburg, Va., inspecting a variety of exhibition cases, panel,
grid, and light systems. He also studied the interiors of the re-
stored buildings for ideas that might be included in the hall of
18th- and 19th-century furnishings of the Museum of History and
Technology.

In preparation of designing an exhibit to portray hand and photo-
mechanical printing processes, Miss Judith Borgogni, exhibits
worker, visited the New York Public Library in February 1958. To-
gether with exhibits worker Robert B. Widder, she critically exam-
ined the display methods used in the University of Pennsylvania
Museum and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Consultant John C. Widener and exhibits worker Thomas G. Baker
spent several days in February 1958 visiting chemical and plastics
manufacturing companies in order to determine the most feasible
method for exhibiting the Museum’s large blue whale.

A detailed analysis of the arms and armor exhibition of the Metro-
politan Museum of Art was made by exhibits worker William B.
Eddy in March 1958. He also scrutinized a variety of exhibits at the
Museum of the City of New York and at the American Museum of
Natural History.

In connection with the planning of a hall of photographic history
in the Museum of History and Technology, Mrs. B. A. W. Karras,
exhibits worker, spent 4 days in April 1958 reviewing the highly
specialized exhibit at George Eastman House, Rochester, N. Y. Even
though technical exhibits comparable to those at Eastman House
will be presented, they must be geared simply and graphically to the
average visitor both as a source of study and for pure enjoyment.

During February 1958 exhibits specialist Benjamin Lawless, Jr.,
and exhibits worker Robert B. Widder made extensive examinations
of museum displays, new buildings under construction, and archi-
tectural offices in New York City.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 37

From March 12 to 15, 1958, Ronald Tavares, exhibits worker,
visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Museum of the City of
New York; the Peabody Museum of Salem; and the Boston Fine
Arts Museum of Massachusetts. He was especially interested in
those exhibits illustrating the development and history of water-
craft.

William L. Brown, chief zoological exhibits specialist, inspected the
tanning of a large elephant hide at Waynesboro, Va., on several days
during the month of October 1957.

From October 8 to 11, 1957, Watson M. Perrygo, zoological ex-
hibits worker, visited New York City and Philadelphia where he
investigated various plastic-manufacturing companies in order to
produce on a large scale museum accessories such as leaves, vines,
branches, grass, and other botanical objects. In November 1957 he
spent 3 days with George Young, chief of the exhibition department
at Kansas University Natural History Museum. Here he had an
opportunity to study methods of making plastic exhibition accessories
by hydraulic press.

John C. Lingebach, zoological exhibits worker, spent several days
in April 1958 collecting a variety of mammals for the exhibits now
under construction in the mammal hall. Most of Mr. Lingebach’s
collecting on this trip and again in May was in the vicinity of
Wardensville, Yellow Springs, North Mountain, and Capon Springs,
W. Va.

EXHIBITIONS

During the fifth year of the continuing program for the moderni-
zation of exhibits at the Smithsonian Institution, $605,000 was made
available by congressional appropriation for selected exhibition halls.
Construction bids were received in February 1958 for the halls de-
voted to fossil invertebrates and fossil cold-blooded vertebrates
(fishes, amphibians, and reptiles), in June 1958 for North American
archeology, and in June 1958 for the hall of agriculture to be located
in the east-south range of the Arts and Industries building. Con-
struction work for the textiles hall was commenced in September
1st:

The new hall of health was opened to the public on the evening of
November 2, 1957, in ceremonies featuring addresses by Dr. John D.
Porterfield, Deputy Surgeon General of the Public Health Service,
Dr. Fred L. Soper, Director of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau,
and Dr. Leonard Carmichael, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. “Through the Ages, Man’s Knowledge of His Body” is the
theme of this hall, which contrasts old ideas with present-day know]-
edge of human anatomy and physiology. Emphasis is placed on
health rather than disease, and modern exhibit techniques are utilized
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

to demonstrate the functioning of a the normal, healthy human body.
A transparent manikin of a woman shows by electronic devices, light,
and sound the location of the major organs of the human bedy and
explains their functions. Among other exhibits are those that illus-
trate the heart, teeth, endocrine glands, and the brain. Historical
displays include reproductions of votive offerings by primitive peo-
ples, ancient manuscripts, and pages from the earliest printed books
illustrating embryology, the skeleton, the heart and blood circulation,
the brain, and the digestive and respiratory systems.

During the year a pictorial exhibit on the history of surgery,
donated by the American Cyanamid Co., was renovated. The Na-
tional Library of Medicine has lent the following exhibits: Vaccina-
tion from Jenner to Salk; Nobel Prize Winners in Medicine; William
Harvey and the Circulation; and Women Physicians and Their
Hospitals.

On the evening of December 8, 1957, Secretary Carmichael dedi-
cated the hall of North American Indians and Eskimos, and in his
address paid tribute to the farsighted men and women who had dur-
ing the past 150 years saved from possible destruction the ethnological
objects displayed therein. Mrs. Mabel A. Byrd, administrative as-
sistant to the Director of the National Museum and herself of Seneca
Indian descent, was invited to cut the ribbon at the formal opening.
Traditional cultures of the Eskimos and of the Indians of the sub-
arctic region, the eastern woodlands, the great plains, the northwest-
ern plateau, and the north Pacific coast are displayed in this hall.
Historically significant objects including the great wampum belt,
symbolizing the union of midwestern tribes formed by the Shawnee
chief Tecumseh to halt the advance of white settlement, and Sitting
Bull’s rifle are featured in these display units. A completely fur-
nished tipi of sewn buffalo hides, some 17 feet in height, depicts the
home life of an Arapaho Indian family during the past century.
Other life-size exhibit units show Polar Eskimos hunting hair seals
and the Powhatan Indians trading with Capt. John Smith on the
James River in 1607.

The gems and minerals hall planned by curator George S. Switzer
was nearing completion at the close of the fiscal year. New exhibition
techniques have been utilized in the display of gems, uncut crystals,
and minerals with gratifying results, particularly with respect to
lighting and reduction of reflection. Installation of the exhibits pro-
ceeded so satisfactorily that formal opening of the hall was scheduled
for July 1958.

Four new habitat groups portraying the sea-bottom life of the
Upper Ordovician, Lower Devonian, Mississippian, and Upper Cre-
taceous are being prepared for the invertebrate hall by George
SECRETARY’S REPORT 39

Marchand of Ann Arbor, Mich. The removal of adhering matrix
and the restoration and mounting of a number of fossil fishes and
amphibians for display in the hall of cold-blooded vertebrates were
completed. Retirement of a portion of the geology and meteorite
collections from hall 6 was undertaken to permit the continued dis-
play of the larger Pleistocene mammals.

A group of showy mineral specimens from Arizona and a large
mass of uranium ore from Colorado were lent for exhibition in the
United States Pavilion at the Brussel’s World Fair.

Plans for the modernization of the two halls to be devoted to North
American archeology were developed by Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, curator
of archeology. In the first hall now scheduled for construction,
archeological horizons of the southwestern United States, the Pacific
coast, and Arctic America will be featured. Topical exhibits will
show native mines and quarries, Indian smoking devices, and trade
items found in Indian sites.

At the close of the fiscal year the contractors had almost finished
the construction of the walls and display units in the two halls to be
devoted to the mammals of the world. Preliminary models of the
habitat groups have been prepared for guidance of the exhibits staff,
accessories for some of the habitat groups are now ready for installa-
tion, and a number of mammals required for the display units have
been mounted. During the year the rooms formerly given over to
the display of local natural history, other than birds, were more
urgently needed for other purposes, and, consequently, these displays
were dismantled. When space becomes available, more informative
exhibits will be installed.

The formal opening of the hall of military history on the afternoon
of June 14, 1958, was presided over by Secretary Leonard Carmichael,
who introduced the Honorable Wilber M. Brucker, Secretary of the
Army, who in turn introduced Gen. Lyman L. Lemnitzer, Vice Chief
of Staff, United States Army, and members of their staffs. Secre-
tary Brucker made reference to the Institution’s important role in
encouraging patriotism through the exhibits that interpret the
Army’s long and distinguished role in the history of our country.
At the close of these indoor ceremonies, Secretary Brucker was hon-
ored by a colorful retreat review by the First Battle Group, Third
Infantry Regiment, on the Mall. In the new hall the history and
development of the United States Army from the Colonial militia
to the modern Pentomic Army are traced through the display of fire-
arms, uniforms, weapons, and other items of military equipment.
Unique objects on display include George Washington’s sword carried
in battle throughout the Revolution and the uniform he wore when

492520594
40 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

he resigned his commission in 1783, De Kalb’s war saddle, an original
Von Steuben drill manual, Rochambeau’s sword, and the uniform
coat worn by General Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans.

The series of new exhibits illustrating the history and methods of
fine printmaking by various hand processes in the graphic arts hall of
the Smithsonian Institution Building was completed at the close of
the fiscal year. Monthly exhibitions of pictorial photography were
continued during the past year, and three special exhibits in graphic
arts were shown.

The east side of the inorganic chemistry gallery was rearranged to
accommodate the leather and saddlery display removed from the
south-central gallery.

Temporary exhibitions during the year included the Sixth Interna-
tional Exhibition of Ceramic Art, August 27 to September 27, 1957,
sponsored by the Kiln Club of Washington, and a display of over 700
pieces of ancient glass from the Ray Winfield Smith collection dating
from 1500 B.C. to A.D. 1200, shown December 28, 1957, to January
16, 1958.

Existing exhibits were improved during the year by restoration of
the Henry electromagnet and the Morse telegraph, the renovation of
the collection of antique astrolabes, sundials, and compasses, and the
renovation of the Howard tower clock. Ship models in the water-
craft hall were repaired and restored.

In the planning for the exhibition series in the Museum of History
and Technology, the following hall plans have been furnished to the
architect for the detailing of built-in fixtures: Physics and astronomy,
chemistry, heavy machinery, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, elec-
tricity, watercraft, ceramics, glass, textiles, graphic arts, and
photography.

The south hall of the Arts and Industries Building was closed to
the public in July 1957; the former exhibits of textiles were dismantled
and the specimens placed in storage. The contractors commenced the
renovation of this hall in September 1957, and by the close of the fiscal
year some progress had been made in the installation of the new ex-
hibits. Three schematics illustrating various spinning principles
have been built and installed, and the renovation of five full-sized ma-
chines has been completed. For the gallery of this south hall, plans
for renovation were completed, and a contract for the necessary con-
struction was awarded in April 1958. In this gallery, methods of
printing fabrics, specimens of needlework, and the history of the sew-
ing machine will be featured.

Plans and designs for four halls in the Museum of History and
Technology which will emphasize different aspects of the civil history
of our Nation were completed. These halls have been designated as
SECRETARY’S REPORT 41

follows: Historic Americans; Everyday Life in the American Past;
Costumes; and First Ladies. Rearrangement and expansion of the
White House china collection were effected during the year.

The educational program of volunteer docent guide service con-
ducted with the cooperative assistance of the Junior League of
Washington, for the benefit of the school children of the Greater
Washington area, was continued with increasing success. The work
is under the general direction of Frank M. Setzler, head curator of
anthropology, working with Mrs. Peter Macdonald, chairman rep-
resenting the Junior League.

During the 6-month season 320 tours—an average of 53 a month—
were conducted, in which 8,790 elementary school children were es-
corted through the four exhibit halls included in the docent
program—the American Indian Hall, the Hall of Everyday Life in
Early America, the First Ladies Hall, and the Hall of Power Ma-
chinery. This was an almost threefold increase in this activity over
the previous year. In addition to Mrs. Macdonald and her cochair-
man, Mrs. George Wyeth, Jr., the following members of the Junior
League participated in the work of conducting the tours: Mrs.
George A. Armstrong, Mrs. John K. Barry, Miss Eleanor Bishop,
Mrs. G. Edwin Brown, Jr., Miss Joan Burke, Mrs. Paul Campbell,
Mrs. Dean Cowie, Mrs. Charles Donnelly, Mrs. Walter Edwards, Mrs.
C. Clarke Gearhart, Mrs. Walter A. Graves, Mrs. H. F. Gregory,
Mrs. R. David Herdman, Mrs. Edward M. Lamont, Mrs. John A.
Manfuso, Jr., Mrs. William McClure, Mrs. Robert L. McCormick,
Mrs. William E. Minshall, Jr., Mrs. John Schoenfeld, Mrs. W. D.
Sloan, Jr., Mrs. Walter Slowinski, Mrs. E. Tillman Stirling, Mrs.
Richard F. Wallis.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

At the close of the fiscal year, the temporary buildings on the site
for the new Museum of History and Technology were being torn
down to clear the land. The architects, McKim, Mead & White, sub-
mitted drawings for the entire building in the tentative stage, made
excellent progress on the working drawings, and completed the speci-
fications and drawings for the excavation and foundations. ‘The de-
sign of this museum building previously approved by the Board of
Regents of the Institution, with the advice of the Joint Congressional
Committee, was approved unanimously by the Commission of Fine
Arts. The National Capital Planning Commission approved the
location of the building on the site.

Senator Clinton P. Anderson, chairman of the Joint Committee
on Construction of a Building for the Museum of History and 'Tech-
nology for the Smithsonian Institution, submitted to the United
42 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

States Senate a report from the committee which reviews the legisla-
tive history of the building and the progress made in its design.
This report was printed as Senate No. 1437, 85th Congress, 2d session,
April 16, 1958.

Planning for this new building was directed by Frank A. Taylor,
Director of the Museum of History and Technology. Designs for
most of the exhibition halls requiring special architectural treatment
were completed by the Museum staff, and the architects prepared
the working drawings. John C. Ewers, administrative officer, di-
rected the Museum staff engaged in the planning of all interior areas.
Eugene Kingman, Director of the Josyln Art Museum, Omaha,
reviewed many of the plans for exhibition halls and contributed
constructive criticism.

Funds for the design and the preparation of working drawings
for the construction of additions to the Natural History Building
were appropriated by Congress. The architects, Mills, Petticord &
Mills, have submitted tentative drawings with a model of the building
when completed and have made excellent progress with the working
drawings. The Museum committee for the planning of the wings
under the chairmanship of Dr. T. Dale Stewart, together with the
curators of the natural history divisions, completed a detailed pro-
gram of requirements which materially advanced the preparation of
plans and estimates.

Throughout the year’s planning of the two building projects, the
Public Buildings Service of the General Services Administration
contributed valuable advice and assistance in advancing, coordinating,
and approving the plans. Leonard L. Hunter, Assistant Commis-
sioner for Design and Construction, gave helpful advice and pro-
fessional direction to the progress of the work through the various
technical stages and presented the building plans before the approv-
ing agencies. Many of his colleagues materially advanced these
projects. John E. Cudd, architect of the Public Buildings Service,
assigned as liaison to the Smithsonian Institution, contributed greatly
to all phases of the two projects, assembling data on requirements,
advising the Museum staff on the arrangement of their planned facili-
ties, and assisting the architects in arranging discussions and ob-
taining decisions on many questions of design and procedure.

Contracts were let for completion of the replacement of the roof
covering on the Natural History Building, the first phase of which
was completed in the fiscal year of 1957. The work will include
covering all skylights with metal and the installation of fluorescent
lighting above the laylight glass. Covering of the skylights will
permit uniform lighting in the three large halls and eliminate water
leakage, which is impossible to control fully in large areas of skylight
glass.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 43

The west shipping entrance of the Natural History Building was
remodeled to provide a stockroom for the supply division and a more
adequate mail room, utilizing space heretofore used to garage Smith-
sonian trucks. An additional shipping entrance door was provided
by remodeling a window between the two existing doors. Supply
division offices were moved into the former stockroom after that
space was renovated.

Meeting room 43 was completely renovated. The work included an
acoustic tile ceiling, additional lighting, relocation of the projection
equipment, a new projection screen, tile floor covering, and improved
ventilation.

All exterior windows of the Arts and Industries Building were
painted, and new glass to provide better illumination was installed in
the large windows of the exhibit halls.

New concrete sidewalks were laid along both sides of the west serv-
ice road, Arts and Industries Building. A new service road was
laid along the west side of this building, and the service road along
the east side was resurfaced. Completion of this project eliminated
service hazards.

CHANGES IN ORGANIZATION AND STAFF

Effective July 1, 1957, the United States National Museum con-
sists of two units, namely, the Museum of Natural History (with its
four departments of anthropology, zoology, botany, and geology) and
the Museum of History and Technology (with its four departments
of science and technology, arts and manufactures, civil history, and
Armed Forces history). Under this new organizational setup, the
old department of engineering and industries and the department of
history were abolished.

Report on the Bureau of American

Ethnology

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1958, conducted
in accordance with the act of Congress of April 10, 1928, as amended
August 22, 1949, which directs the Bureau “to continue independently
or in cooperation anthropological researches among the American
Indians and the natives of lands under the jurisdiction or protection
of the United States and the excavation and preservation of archeo-
logic remains.”

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES
(Prepared from data submitted by staff members.)

Dr. M. W. Stirling, Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology
from 1928 to 1947 and Director since 1947, retired on December 31,
1957. At that time he was appointed a research associate. During
the period from July 1 to December 31, 1957, Dr. Stirling devoted
most of his time to administrative duties and the preparation of a
manuscript pertaining to previous fieldwork in Panama and Ecuador.
Effective January 1, 1958, Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., Associate
Director, was appointed Director. He also continued to be in charge
of the River Basin Surveys.

During the fiscal year Dr. Roberts devoted most of his time to the
management of the River Basin Surveys and subsequently to the
duties of the main Bureau office. In July and early August he made
an inspection trip to the Missouri Basin where he visited all the ex-
cavation parties of the River Basin Surveys and also several of those
from cooperating institutions. He was accompanied by Dr. Robert
LL. Stephenson, chief of the Missouri Basin Project, Dr. John M. Cor-
bett, National Park Service archeologist, and Paul L. Beaubien, re-
gional archeologist for Region Two of the Service. Late in April
Dr. Roberts went to the field headquarters at Lincoln, Nebr., to assist
in preparing plans for the field season in the Missouri Basin. From
Lincoln, in company with several members of the Missouri Basin
Project staff, he went to Norman, Okla., to attend and participate in
the annual meeting of the Society for American Archeology. From
here the group proceeded to Russellville, Ark., where it inspected the

46
SECRETARY’S REPORT 47

excavations being carried on by a River Basin Surveys party in the
Dardanelle Reservoir area. En route back to Lincoln a stop was
made at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, and a number
of collections of archeological material in the museum there were ex-
amined. After spending several additional days at Lincoln studying
the operations of the office and laboratory, Dr. Roberts returned to
Washington and was in the office at the close of the year. During the
fall and winter months Dr. Roberts reviewed and suggested changes
in the manuscripts of several detailed, technical reports on the results
of excavations at sites in the Missouri Basin and other areas.

Dr. Henry B. Collins, anthropologist, continued his Eskimo studies
and other Arctic activities. He prepared an article on Eskimo art
for the Enciclopedia Universale Deli’Arte, a 14-volume work to be
published in Italian and English by the Istituto per la Collabora-
zione Culturale, Rome. His paper “Present Status of the Dorset
Problem,” which he presented at the 32d International Congress of
Americanists in Copenhagen, was published in the Proceedings of the
Congress.

In May Dr. Collins participated in an international conference on
Arctic anthropology held at the Danish National Museum in Copen-
hagen. Also attending were five anthropologists from the United
States, one from Canada, four each from Denmark and the
U.S.S.R., and two each from Norway, Sweden, and Finland. The
purpose of the meeting was to discuss plans for closer international
cooperation in Arctic anthropology. Following the conference Dr.
Collins visited a large Mesolithic site, Kongemosen, representing the
formative stage of the Ertebélle culture, and two other Mesolithic
sites at Eriksholm and Langtved, near Holbaek.

Dr. Collins continued to serve on the publications and research
committees of the Arctic Institute of North America, as well as on
the committee which plans the research program of the Arctic Re-
search Laboratory at Point Barrow, operated by the Office of Naval
Research. He also continued as chairman of the Directing Commit-
tee which plans and supervises the work of the Arctic Bibliography,
a comprehensive annotated and indexed bibliography of publications
in all fields of science relating to the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions
of America and Eurasia. The work is being prepared by the Arctic
Institute of North America for the Department of Defense. Volume
8 of the Bibliography, which abstracts and indexes the contents of
5,623 publications in English, Russian, German, and the Scandinavian
and 17 other languages, was delivered to the Government Printing
Office in June. This makes a total of 49,087 publications that have
been abstracted thus far in Arctic Bibliography.
48 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

Dr. William C. Sturtevant, ethnologist, spent the week of July 29-
August 4, 1957, in South Carolina working with the last living speaker
of any of the Siouan languages of the east—a Catawba man 85 years
old. The informant proved somewhat less than satisfactory, owing
to his age and rather poor recall of a language he has not spoken for
some years. However, a vocabulary file of a few hundred entries was
built up, and several short texts and songs were collected. In addition
to transcription in a phonetic orthography, all materials were re-
corded with a tape recorder, to form a permanent record of a different
nature than the Catawba linguistic materials collected by others be-
fore the advent of convenient mechanical recording devices with good
fidelity. The language has not yet been adequately analyzed, nor
has its precise relationship to other Siouan languages been established ;
the tape recording will be invaluable when these tasks are eventually
undertaken.

Dr. Sturtevant spent 7 weeks continuing his field research among
the New York State Seneca, during four separate trips. In September
he devoted 10 days to close observation of the work of a skilled
Seneca mask carver on the Allegany Reservation, making detailed
notes on his construction techniques and taking numerous photographs
to document the various steps in the process. For a few days of this
period Dr. Sturtevant received valuable assistance from Dr. William
H. Davenport of Yale University, a specialist on primitive art. It
became evident during this fieldwork that observation of construction
is an essential preliminary to the structural analysis of the forms of
these Seneca masks and will be of considerable assistance in the ethno-
esthetic study initiated during the previous fiscal year. During Jan-
uary and February, Dr. Sturtevant spent about 2 weeks on the
Cattaraugus Reservation attending the annual midwinter ceremony
of this Seneca group and discussing it with participants. The data
obtained form part of a continuing study of the religion of this com-
munity, which has previously received little attention from ethnolo-
gists, in contrast to most other Iroquois non-Christian communities.

In April 1958, Dr. Sturtevant visited Gainesville, Fla., for consul-
tations on Florida anthropology with Dr. John M. Goggin. From
there he traveled to Oklahoma via Montgomery, Ala. (where he ex-
amined the collections of the Alabama Department of Archives and
History), and the region around Philadelphia, Miss. (where he spent
three days surveying the possibilities for research among the Missis-
sippi Choctaw). In Oklahoma he examined the photograph and
specimen collections of the Oklahoma Historical Society, attended
the joint annual meetings of the Society for American Archeology
and the Central States Anthropological Society, and had brief con-
tacts with members of several Oklahoma tribes. Dr. Sturtevant also
SECRETARY’S REPORT 49

attended the 11th Conference on Iroquois Research at Red House,
N.Y., in October 1957. At these latter two professional meetings he
delivered three papers. In December 1957 he attended the Ameri-
can Anthropological Association meetings in Chicago (where he also
examined an important collection of Seminole artifacts and a large
newly discovered collection of early photographs of the Seminole).

In May and June 1958, Dr. Sturtevant returned for three weeks
to the Allegany Reservation, where he concentrated on study of social
organization, particularly residence patterns. These data should
prove valuable for comparison with similar information, as yet un-
published, collected some 25 years ago on this reservation by Dr. Wil-
liam N. Fenton. Furthermore, the community studied is threatened
with removal to make way for flooding of a large part of the reserva-
tion by the proposed Kinzua dam. If the dam is built, present resi-
dence patterns can then be compared with residence after relocation
of the community. The nearly unanimous opposition of the Indians
to relocation makes research of this sort rather difficult.

Dr. Sturtevant’s office work included continuation of his research
on the Florida Seminole, on which a paper was published in Publica-
tion No. 5 of the Florida Anthropological Society, and work on a
paper on the historical ethnobotany of the cycad Zamia.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Carl F. Miller was continuing
the excavations by the Smithsonian Institution—National Geographic
Society Expedition at Russell Cave in Alabama. The work continued
until the end of August, and during that period a section of the cave
floor was excavated to a depth of 82 feet, where a water table was
encountered and it was necessary to stop the digging. During the
course of the work the skeletal remains of a very young infant were
found at a depth of approximately 4 feet. On the basis of a carbon—
14 date obtained during the previous season’s investigations at the
cave, it is estimated that the burial was approximately 5,000 years
old. There were no accompanying mortuary offerings, but the de-
posits where the remains were interred indicated that the Early
Woodland Period was represented. The partially flexed remains of
an adult male were found 814 feet below the floor level and it also
lacked any accompanying offerings. The burial probably was made
about 7,000 years ago. The material from the deposits indicates that
potterymaking began in that area at about 3500 B.C. Prior to that
time the people apparently had a completely hunting-fishing economy.
A large series of implements, discarded animal bones, and other ma-
terials was obtained from the lower deposits, and at a depth of 23
feet the remains of a hearth were uncovered. Charcoal from that
hearth was recently dated by Dr. H. R. Crane at the University of
Michigan as being 9,020+350 years old. The Russell Cave Expedi-
50 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

tion brought back to the Smithsonian Institution somewhat more than
a ton and a half of material for study and exhibit purposes.

RIVER BASIN SURVEYS

The River Basin Surveys, in cooperation with the National Park
Service and the Bureau of Reclamation of the Department of the
Interior, the Corps of Engineers of the Department of the Army, and
various State and local institutions, continued its program for salvage
archeology in areas to be flooded or otherwise destroyed by the con-
struction of large dams. During the fiscal year 1957-58 the program
was financed by a transfer of $175,624 from the National Park Serv-
ice to the Smithsonian Institution. Of that amount $157,624 was
for use in the Missouri Basin and the remainder covered operations
in other areas. A carryover of $15,902 from the Missouri Basin
funds for the preceding fiscal year made the total available for the
Missouri Basin $173,526. The over-all total for the year was $191,526.
The amount of available money was somewhat larger than during
the previous fiscal year, and the increase was reflected in the work
accomplished.

Field investigation during the year consisted mainly of excavations,
although some surveys were carried on in several areas. On June 1,
1957, nine parties were in the field. Four were doing intensive dig-
ging in the Great Bend Reservoir area and four were making ex-
cavations in the Oahe Reservoir area, both projects being located
in South Dakota. A survey party covered portions of the Big Bend
area, which had not been visited during the previous summer’s work,
and carried on test operations in 14 sites. In September that party
moved to the Oahe Reservoir basin where it started similar oper-
ations. Most of the field parties had returned to their headquarters
by the end of September. Early in the spring a party conducted
excavations in the Dardanelle Reservoir area on the Arkansas River
in Arkansas. During the period February—June, a survey party
worked in three reservoir areas along the lower Chattahoochee River
in Alabama and Georgia, and in April—June another party excavated
in two sites in the Hartwell Reservoir area in South Carolina-
Georgia. At the end of the fiscal year nine parties were conducting
excavations along the Missouri River in South Dakota. Five were
working in the Great Bend Reservoir area and four in the Oahe
Reservoir Basin.

By June 80, 1958, reservoir areas where archeological surveys and
excavations had been made since the salvage program got under way
in 1946 totaled 254 in 29 States. The survey parties have located
and recorded 4,889 archeological sites, and of that number 997 have
been recommended for excavation or limited testing. In general
SECRETARY’S REPORT 5a:

the term “excavation” does not indicate the complete investigation
of a site, but usually means that only about 10 percent of it has been
uncovered. There are some cases, however, where the locality is of
sufficient significance to warrant extensive digging. Preliminary ap-
praisal reports have been issued for all the reservoir areas surveyed,
with the exception of the Big Bend in South Dakota and the group
of three in Chattahoochee Basin. The report for the Big Bend has
been completed, however, and will be processed early in the coming
fiscal year. One preliminary report covering the survey of the
Dardanelle Reservoir area in Arkansas was mimeographed and dis-
tributed during the year. Since the beginning of the Inter-Agency
Archeological Salvage Program, 184 appraisal reports have been
issued. The discrepancy between that number and the total of the
reservoir areas examined is due to the fact that in several cases in-
formation obtained from a number of reservoir projects located in
a single basin or subbasin have been combined in a single report.

By the end of the fiscal year 388 sites in 52 reservoir basins located
in 19 different States had been either partially or extensively dug.
Only a single site was excavated in some of the reservoir areas, while
in others a whole series was investigated. At least one example of
each type of site recommended by the preliminary surveys had been
excavated. In some cases it has been necessary to dig a number of
somewhat similar sites because the complexity of such remains makes
it essential to have considerable comparative material in order to
obtain full information about that particular phase of aboriginal cul-
ture. In brief it may be said that the cultural stages represented
cover the range from the early hunting peoples of about 10,000 years
ago to the frontier trading and Army posts of the latter part of
the 19th century. Reports of the results obtained from some of
the excavations have been published in Bulletins of the Bureau of
American Ethnology, in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,
and in various scientific journals. During the year River Basin
Surveys Paper No. 8, Bulletin 166 of the Bureau of American Eth-
nology, was distributed. It was written by Dr. Douglas Osborne
and pertains to excavations in the McNary Reservoir Basin near
Umatilla, Oreg. Accompanying the archeological report are ap-
pendices on the skeletal material, trade goods, and composition of
the copper objects found during the excavations. River Basin Sur-
veys Papers 9-14, which will constitute Bulletin 169 of the Bureau
of American Ethnology, were in page proof at the end of the year,
and the volume should be ready for distribution early in the next
fiscal year. Three of the papers pertain to investigations in the
Missouri Basin, two to work done in the Jim Woodruff Reservoir
area, Georgia-Florida, and one to a site in the Alatoona Reservoir
52 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

area in Georgia. Twelve detailed technical reports on the results
of work done during previous years were completed during 1957-58
and are ready to submit to the editors for publication as soon as
funds sufficient to cover their cost are available.

As of June 30, 1958, the distribution of reservoir projects that have
been surveyed for archeological remains was as follows: Alabama, 3;
Arkansas, 1; California, 20; Colorado, 24; Georgia, 8; Idaho, 11;
Tilinois, 2; Iowa, 8; Kansas, 10; Kentucky, 2; Louisiana, 2; Minne-
sota, 1; Mississippi, 1; Montana, 15; Nebraska, 28; New Mexico, 1;
North Dakota, 18; Ohio, 2; Oklahoma, 7; Oregon, 27; Pennsylvania,
2; South Carolina, 1; South Dakota, 10; Tennessee, 4; Texas, 19;
Virginia, 2; Washington, 11; West Virginia, 2; Wyoming, 22. Exca-
vations have been made or were under way in reservoir basins in
Arkansas, 1; California, 5; Colorado, 1; Iowa, 1; Georgia, 5; Kan-
sas, 5; Montana, 1; Nebraska, 1; New Mexico, 1; North Dakota, 4;
Oklahoma, 2; Oregon, 4; South Carolina, 2; South Dakota, 4; Texas,
7; Virginia, 1; Washington, 4; West Virginia, 1; Wyoming, 2. The
preceding figures include only the work of the River Basin Surveys
or that which was in direct cooperation between local institutions and
the Surveys. The investigations made by State and local institutions
working under agreements with the National Park Service have not
been included because complete information about them is not
available.

The River Basin Surveys, as in previous years, received helpful
cooperation from the National Park Service, the Bureau of Recla-
mation, and the Corps of Engineers, and various State and local insti-
tutions. The Corps of Engineers provided transportation and
guides for work in one of the reservoir areas and provided temporary
field headquarters for a party in another area. In several instances
mechanical equipment to assist in heavy excavations was made avail-
able by the construction agency. Field personnel of all the agencies
was particularly helpful to the various party leaders from the River
Basin Surveys and expedited their activities in numerous ways. The
National Park Service continued to serve as the liaison between the
various agencies, both in Washington and in the field. The Park
Service also prepared the estimates and justifications for the funds
needed to carry on the salvage program. In the several Park Service
regions the regional directors and members of their staffs cooperated
wholeheartedly in the program and greatly aided all phases of the
operations.

The main office in Washington continued general supervision of
the program. The field headquarters and laboratory at Lincoln,
Nebr., was responsible for the activities in the Missouri Basin and
also provided a base of operations for the party which worked at the
SECRETARY’S REPORT 53

Dardanelle Reservation in Arkansas. The materials collected by the
excavating parties in the Missouri River Basin, as well as the one in
Arkansas and those from the Toronto Reservoir area on the Verdigris
River in Kansas, which were obtained the previous year, were proc-
essed at the Lincoln laboratory. During the first two months of the
fiscal year, Dr. James H. Howard, who supervised the project at the
Kansas Reservoir, worked in the Lincoln office studying the speci-
mens which he had recovered and preparing his report.

Washington office—The main headquarters of the River Basin
Surveys at the Bureau of American Ethnology continued under the
direction of Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr. Carl F. Miller, archeolo-
gist, was detailed to the regular Bureau staff for the period from
July 1 to December 29, in order to continue excavations at Russell
Cave, Alabama, and to work up the material obtained from the cave.
On December 30 he returned to the River Basin Surveys staff and
from then until April 22 devoted his time to the completion of his
report on previous excavations at the James H. Kerr (Buggs Island)
Reservoir on the Roanoke River in southern Virginia. During the
winter months he spoke before several local societies, completed an
article on the Russell Cave work for the National Geographic Maga-
zine and gave a lecture on the cave before the National Geographic
Society in Washington. On April 22 he proceeded to South Carolina
where he conducted excavations in the Hartwell Reservoir area.
While engaged in those investigations he spoke before several local
Rotary and Lions Clubs, several groups of Boy Scouts, and a Naval
Research group at Clemson College. On May 23 he participated in
a conference held at the University of Georgia at Athens, at which
time representatives of the National Park Service, the University of
Georgia, and the River Basin Surveys discussed future work for the
Hartwell Reservoir area. Mr. Miller returned to Washington on
June 26 and on June 29 was again transferred to the Bureau of
American Ethnology to resume the activities at Russell Cave. The
latter work, which is a cooperative project between the Smithsonian
Institution and the National Geographic Society, was to continue
through the early months of the following fiscal year.

William M. Bass III, temporary physical anthropologist, was on
duty in Washington at the beginning of the year. He devoted the
month of July and the first week in August to a study of human
skeletal material from various sites in the Missouri Basin and pre-
pared reports on his findings. On August 9 he left Washington for
Pierre, S. Dak., and spent the ensuing 3 weeks assisting in the removal
of Indian burials at the Sully site in the Oahe Reservoir area. Mr.
Bass returned to Washington August 29 and resigned from the Sur-
veys in order to resume his studies toward an advanced degree. On
54 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

June 2 Mr. Bass again reported for duty in Washington and spent
3 weeks classifying human skeletal material from the James H. Kerr
Reservoir in southern Virginia. He then proceeded to Pierre, S. Dak.,
and took charge of a party conducting excavations in the burial area
at the Sully site. Mr. Bass was engaged in those activities at the close
of the year.

Harold A. Huscher, archeologist on the staff of the Missouri Basin
Project, was detailed to the Washington office beginning February
2, 1958, and on February 7 left for Georgia and Alabama, where he
carried on preliminary surveys in three reservoir areas in the lower
Chattahoochee River Basin. Mr. Huscher continued those activities
until June 23 when he went to Athens, Ga., to participate in the
conference at which Mr. Miller was also in attendance. Following
the conference Mr. Huscher returned to Washington, and at the close
of the fiscal year was preparing a summary report on the results of
his explorations along the Chattahoochee.

Alabama-Georgia—During the period February 10 to June 21
preliminary surveys were made in the areas to be flooded by the
Columbia Dam and Lock, the Walter F. George Dam and Lock, and
the Oliver Dam on the lower Chattahoochee River. The Columbia
Dam and Lock and the Walter F. George Dam and Lock are projects
of the Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, while the Oliver
Dam is being constructed by the Georgia Power Co. The Columbia
Dam is to be located a short distance below the bridge across the
Chattahoochee River at Columbia, Ala. The Walter F. George Dam
is to be built at Fort Gaines, Ga., and the Oliver Dam is located a
short distance above Columbus, Ga. These three projects together
will flood out 120 contiguous miles of the Chattahoochee bottoms.
Since the area to be affected by the Walter F. George project will be
the first to be inundated, most of the period was spent in that area,
although some reconnaissance was made in both of the other basins.

During the course of the survey in the Walter F. George basin,
117 archeological sites were located and recorded on the Georgia side
of the river and 90 sites on the Alabama side. They range from sim-
ple village locations to areas containing the remains of several differ-
ent cultures, and from single to multiple mound groups. In addition
there are two historical sites of considerable importance. One is that
of the Spanish Fort of Apalachicola, dating from 1689 to 1691, and
the other the historic Creek town of Roanoke which was occupied by
the whites and then attacked and burned by the Indians in 1736. Be-
cause the exact dates of occupancy of the Fort are known, it should
provide an important check point in working out the chronology of the
area. Also, since the Roanoke village was burned it should be quite
productive archeologically. The aboriginal sites range from Early
SECRETARY’S REPORT 55

Woodland to relatively late Creek villages dating from the period
1675-1836. The latter present the possibility of a specific identi-
fication of sites from ethnohistorical evidence, as well as an unusual
opportunity to use the direct-historical approach in establishing a
regional chronology.

The manifestations in the Columbia Dam and Lock and Oliver
Dam basins are an integral part of the entire picture in the Lower
Chattahoochee Valley and must be studied in conjunction with those
in the Walter F. George section. Complete coverage of those two
projects was not possible in the time devoted to the reconnaissance,
but it was determined that there are at least 14 sites in the immediate
area of the Columbia Dam which will be affected by construction
activities. One is a major mound site probably dating about A.D.
1200, already half destroyed by the river, which calls for immediate
investigation. Three others are major village sites attributable to the
Weeden Island cultural pattern. In the Oliver Dam district there are
at least 15 known sites including mounds, early village locations, and
caves giving evidence of Indian occupation. The series encompasses
a period of at least 3,000 years.

The entire history of aboriginal development in that portion of the
Chattahoochee Valley is contained in the river bottoms and low ter-
races which will be flooded by the three reservoirs. Very little archeo-
logical work has been done there and an extensive program of excava-
tion is indicated. In addition, further surveys should be made in
districts not covered during the recent investigations.

Arkansas.—In the Dardanelle Reservoir Basin on the Arkansas
River in west-central Arkansas, excavations were made in five sites,
and two new sites were located and recorded during the period from
March 18 to May 7. All seven of the sites involved were in the lower
portion of the reservoir area. One rock shelter was almost com-
pletely excavated and four open sites were extensively tested. Little
was found at the excavated sites to indicate the type of dwelling or
structures erected by the people. However, a considerable collection
of artifact material was recovered which shows that the sites pri-
marily represent the Archaic Period and that their ceramics were
related to the Lower Mississippi Valley sequences. Only slight in-
fluences were noted from the Caddoan area to the west and southwest.
The two new sites found by the field party represent a mound-village
complex and a historic Cherokee location. Because of adverse
weather and unusually heavy rains during the period the party was in
the Dardanelle area, not so much work was accomplished as had been
contemplated, and it was recommended that similar excavations be
made during the following fiscal year in upper portions of the reser-
voir basin.

56 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

The proposed survey of the Greer’s Ferry Reservoir area, which
was postponed the previous year because of high waters, was not
made during the current year by a River Basin Surveys party as con-
templated. Instead the University of Arkansas, working under an
agreement with the National Park Service, carried out the prelimi-
nary investigations at Greer’s Ferry. The situation there was some-
what comparable to that in the Dardanelle area in that weather con-
ditions hampered the work to a considerable degree. It was planned
that another party from the University would return to the Greer’s
Ferry area shortly after the beginning of the new fiscal year.

Iowa.—No fieldwork was carried on in Iowa during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1958. However, the detailed technical report “Archeo-
logical Salvage Investigations in the Coralville Reservoir, lowa” was
completed during the year and will be available for publication as
soon as funds for that purpose are available. The report consists of
100 typed pages, 12 plates, and 15 text figures.

Kansas.—The only activity on the part of the River Basin Surveys
during the fiscal year pertaining to Kansas was that of the comple-
tion of the detailed technical report on the excavation in eight sites
in the Toronto Reservoir Basin during the spring months of 1957. A
typed manuscript of 90 pages with 12 plates and 15 text figures is now
ready to submit to the editors.

Missouri Basin.—As in previous years, the Missouri Basin Project
continued to operate from the field headquarters and laboratory at
1517 “O” Street, Lincoln, Nebr. Dr. Robert L. Stephenson served
as chief of the Project throughout the year. Activities included work
on all four phases of the salvage program: (1) Survey, (2) excava-
tion, (3) analysis, and (4) reporting. The first two phases received
major attention in the summer months, and the second two during the
fall and winter. In addition to the four regular phases of the pro-
gram, a special chronology program was initiated during the year.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the staff, in addition to the
chief, consisted of 4 permanent archeologists, 1 archeologist detailed
to the Project from the Washington office, 5 temporary field assist-
ants, 1 field assistant detailed to the project from the Washington
office, 1 temporary physical anthropologist on duty in the Washing-
ton office, 1 field and laboratory assistant, 1 administrative assistant,
1 museum aide, 1 clerk-stenographer, 1 file clerk (half time), 1
photographer, 1 clerk-typist, 2 temporary laboratory assistants, 1
temporary (part time) draftsman, and 79 temporary field crewmen.
At the end of the 1957 summer field season, all temporary field crew-
men were terminated, with the exception of one who was assigned
laboratory assistant’s duties in the Lincoln office. The physical an-
thropologist subsequently was on duty in the Missouri Basin for 8
SECRETARY’S REPORT 57

weeks in August. The archeologist and field assistant detailed from
the Washington office returned to their regular assignments in Au-
gust. Two temporary field assistants were terminated in August.
Two other temporary field assistants were appointed as archeologists
on the permanent staff. One temporary field assistant was transferred
to duty outside the Missouri Basin in January. One illustrator was
added to the permanent staff in November. All other temporary
employees were terminated in December and January. Four museum
aides were added to the permanent staff during the year. One tempo-
rary archeologist and two temporary field assistants were added at the
beginning of the 1958 field season. At the end of the fiscal year there
were 6 archeologists in addition to the chief, 1 administrative assist-
ant, 1 clerk-stenographer, 1 file clerk (three-quarters time), 1 clerk-
typist, 1 photographer, 1 illustrator, and 4 museum aides on the
permanent staff. Temporary employees included 1 archeologist, 1
physical anthropologist, 2 field assistants, 3 cooks, and 90 crewmen.

During the year there were 19 Smithsonian Institution River Basin
Surveys field parties at work within the Missouri Basin, while
another, working outside the Basin, also operated from the Project
office in Lincoln. Of the 19 Missouri Basin parties, 5 were at work
in July, August, and September in the Big Bend Reservoir area in
South Dakota, and 5 additional parties were at work there in June.
Five parties worked in the Oahe Reservoir area in July, August, and
September, and four other parties were at work there in June. The
party outside the Missouri Basin was that in the Dardanelle Reser-
voir area in Arkansas.

Other fieldwork in the Missouri Basin during the year included 11
field parties from State institutions working under agreements with
the National Park Service and in cooperation with the salvage re-
search program of the Smithsonian Institution. Parties from the
Universities of South Dakota, Idaho, Wyoming, Kansas, and Mis-
sourl and from the North Dakota State Historical Society were in the
field during July to October. Parties from the Universities of South
Dakota, Idaho, Wyoming, and Missouri were conducting excavations
in June, as was a joint party from the North Dakota State Historical
Society and the University of North Dakota.

At the beginning of the year in the Big Bend Reservoir area,
G. Hubert Smith and a party of 10 were engaged in excavations on
the right bank of the Missouri River near the mouth of Medicine
Creek, in Lyman County, S. Dak., at site 39L.M241. This site was
believed to be that of Fort Defiance (or Bouis), a small, short-lived
trading post of the 1840’s. It was one of a number of such estab-
lishments organized from time to time in competition with the Ameri-
can Fur Co. (P. Chouteau, Jr., & Co., after 1834). It was hoped that
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

work there would provide information on such lesser establishments
of the fur and Indian trade, of which little was ever recorded at the
time they were in use. Excavations at 391.M241 proved that it was
not the site of Fort Defiance (or Bouis) but that it was of a later
period of permanent settlement, dating after 1880. Further search
for the Fort Defiance site proved fruitless. While somewhat scanty,
the data and specimens from 39L.M241 provide materials that should
be very useful for comparative studies relating to this later period of
white occupation. The Smith party completed 6 weeks of fieldwork
and returned to the Lincoln office early in August.

The second River Basin Surveys field party in the Big Bend Reser-
voir area at the beginning of the year was directed by Dr. Warren W.
Caldwell and consisted of a crew of nine. The group was at work on
the right bank of the Missouri River in Lyman County, S. Dak.,
some 7 miles above the Lower Brule Agency, excavating in the Black
Partizan site (39L.M218). The latter consists of the remains of a pre-
historic earth-lodge village of at least 2 component occupations and
perhaps 8. The party completely excavated 1 circular earth-lodge
ruin and a large portion of a second, cross-sectioned a defensive forti-
fication ditch, excavated 1 complete bastion of the stockade, and tested
a number of midden areas and cache pits. The circular houses were
situated well outside the fortification ditch and were of the late occu-
pation of about the end of the 17th century. The ditch and bastion
represent two earlier occupation periods, with the ditch being dug
during the earlier one, later filled in and, still later, redug. Tests
indicated a rectangular house inside the fortification ditch and, to-
gether with midden areas and cache pits in that area, provided both
simple-stamped and cord-roughened pottery that predates the mate-
rial recovered from the circular houses outside the stockade. Among
the finds made in the cache pits, one of particular interest was the
burial of two very large, adult dogs, together with a pup. After 12
weeks of excavation, the party disbanded and returned to the Lincoln
office on September 7. The Caldwell and Smith parties shared a
joint field camp near the mouth of Medicine Creek.

The third River Basin Surveys field party in the Big Bend Reser-
voir area at the beginning of the year was under the direction of
Robert W. Neuman and had a crew of 10. That party conducted
excavations in four sites in the vicinity of Old Fort Thompson, the
Indian Agency, on the left bank of the Missouri River in Buffalo
County, S. Dak. Two of them were prehistoric village sites on the low
terrace bottoms, and two were burial mounds situated on the higher
terrace of the Missouri River. The Pretty Bull site (39BF12) was
found to have had three separate occupations. The earliest and
deepest remains were recovered from two test excavations that un-
SECRETARY'S REPORT 59

covered two basin-shaped pits with burned, bright orange-colored
walls. One of these pits was associated with a few scattered post
molds. The recovered artifacts suggest a Middle Woodland occupa-
tion and include cord-marked pottery, crude triangular projectile
points, stone end scrapers, elk or deer bone and antler tools, small
shell disk beads, and concentrations of hematite. The middle occupa-
tion was apparent in a large strata trench, where six cache pits with
slightly convex bottoms and undercut walls were excavated. Fill
within the pits included an abundance of Monroe, Anderson, and
Foreman pottery that relates to an early, rectangular-house occupa-
tion. Bone and stone implements were also numerous, but no archi-
tectural features were found. The late occupation was represented
in the excavations by the remains of a large, circular earth lodge.
A central fire hearth, basin- and bell-shaped cache pits, and second-
ary fire hearths were excavated within the house. The ceramic col-
lections from the house fill consist of at least nine pottery types,
suggesting a long and varied occupation. The post-mold pattern of
the house was poorly defined in some places, but the general pattern
was unmistakable.

The second village location excavated by the Neuman party was
the Akichita site (89BF221). There, three midden areas were
sampled extensively, and an abundance of artifacts and refuse was
recovered, but no houses were located. One bell-shaped cache pit was
dug. Artifacts collected suggest close affiliation with the older
levels at the Dodd site (89ST30) near Pierre, S. Dak. It was felt at
the end of the season that additional work was needed there, particu-
larly an effort to determine the architectural pattern of the houses.
A third site excavated was the Olson Mound (89BF223). It was a
low, circular earth mound 1.5 feet high and 40 feet in diameter. No
pottery and very few bone or stone artifacts were recovered from the
fill. In the center, and on the base of the mound, there was a con-
centration of badly decomposed human bones, suggesting the second-
ary burial of an undetermined number of individuals. The cultural
affiliation of the complex has not yet been determined. ‘The final site
excavations by the Neuman party were at the Truman Mound site
(89BF224). The latter consisted of a group of four low, circular
mounds in a line along the terrace edge, each measuring about 2 feet
in height and 50 feet in diameter. Three of the mounds contained
primary and/or secondary burials. One mound contained a deep,
oval pit extending 6 feet below its top surface. A flexed burial, shell
pendants, pottery sherds, and bone and shell tools were recovered
from both the pit and the mound fill. Another of the mounds had a
rectangular design of small rocks on its top surface and contained
secondary burials. One skull displayed a large cut hole in the left
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

temporal region. This mound lacked pottery, but in all other re-
spects resembled the other three excavated mounds. The pottery
from this mound group, including one restored vessel, was simple
stamped, but had a typical Middle Wocdland conoidal vessel shape
and no decoration. This party disbanded and returned to the Lin-
coln headquarters on October 3, after 14 weeks of fieldwork.

The fourth River Basin Surveys field party in the Big Bend Reser-
voir area was directed by William N. Irving and consisted of a crew
of eight. At the beginning of the year the party was at work on
the left bank of the Missouri River in the vicinity of Old Fort
Thompson in Buffalo County, S. Dak. Efforts were concentrated on
the Medicine Crow site (89BF2), and excavations were made in three
separate areas. In area A the men uncovered a circular earth lodge
and several cache pits of the late occupation of about the early 18th
century. In area C another circular earth lodge and several cache
pits were excavated, and the recovered material suggests an occupa-
tion date a few decades earlier than that of area A. One cache-pit
burial was recovered there. The main work of the season was in
area B, where a large series of extensive test excavations revealed
deeply buried evidence of at least three separate occupations, antedat-
ing the appearance of ceramics in the area. Some 25 projectile
points and a large collection of camp refuse were obtained. The
types of the artifacts and the stratigraphic situation, terminating in
a coarse sand at the bottom, suggest an early Archaic occupation of
perhaps as much as 5,000 or more years ago. One skull, recovered
from the site, compares physically with the “Minnesota Man” re-
mains, which generally are believed to be late Pleistocene in age.
This is the best early-period site thus far noted in the immediate
valley of the Missouri River. It has a strong potential for produc-
ing evidence for a good sequence of occupations from very early
preceramic times to late ceramic times. The geology of the terrace
formations there, and pollen analyses, promise good interpretative
possibilities. The party ended the season’s work on October 8, after
14 weeks of excavation. The Neuman and Irving parties shared a
joint camp at Old Fort Thompson.

The fifth River Basin Surveys field party in the Big Bend Reser-
voir area at the beginning of the fiscal year was directed by Harold A.
Huscher. He was assisted by a crew of three. This was a mobile
party and constituted an extension of the previous summer’s survey
work in that area. During the season’s work the group conducted
extensive test excavations in 14 sites on both sides of the river in
Buffalo, Hyde, Hughes, Lyman, and Stanley Counties; made surface
collections from 14 other sites in Buffalo and Hyde Counties; and
located 16 previously unrecorded sites. Of the sites tested, 12 were
SECRETARY’S REPORT 61

recommended for excavation and 2 were written off as meriting no
further attention. The 12 comprised either single- or multi-occupa-
tion sites, ranging in time from Middle Woodland through the early
ceramic periods of rectangular houses to and including the late
ceramic periods of circular earth lodges. One suggests a preceramic
horizon somewhat similar to that at the Medicine Crow site (39BF2).
Of the sites visited and not tested, nine were recommended for further
investigation, and five were written off. One of the latter five,
39HU215, was first thought to be an early 19th-century trading post,
but tests indicated that it was a late 19th-century homestead allot-
ment, probably of Dakota occupancy. On September 3 this party
terminated its work in the Big Bend area after 8 weeks in the field,
and moved to the Oahe Reservoir area to continue similar survey and
testing activities.

In the Oahe Reservoir area there were four River Basin Survey
parties in the field at the beginning of the fiscal year, and a fifth
party began work there early in September. Dr. Robert L. Stephen-
son with a crew of 23 was excavating, at the beginning of the year, in
the vicinity of Fort Sully on the left bank of the Missouri River in
Sully County, S. Dak. That party conducted intensive excavations
in the Sully site (89SL4), the remains of the largest of the pre-
historic earth-lodge villages known in the Missouri Basin. It also
completely excavated a small rock-cairn burial site (89SL38) nearby.
The latter consisted of a deep burial beneath a rock pile and produced
a skeleton in poor condition, with no associated artifacts. The Sully
site excavations included 13 circular earth lodges of the nearly 400
presumed to be present in the site, and 114 of the 4 ceremonial lodges.
The house floors ranged in depth, below the surface, from 2 to 4
feet; entrances were to the southwest; and two distinct architectural
patterns were observed. One was composed of closely set double rows
of small outer wall posts, the other was composed of widely spaced
single rows of large outer posts with leaner posts outside them. Ap-
parently there were two closely related, yet somewhat different, oc-
cupational patterns, and the artifact inventory tends to support this
distinction. The ceremonial lodges were 12-sided structures of 75- to
80-foot diameters and had long entrance passages. The other houses
all had very short entrances. The ceramic inventory suggests that
there may have been an earlier occupation featuring rectangular
houses, but no such houses were found in the areas excavated. Other
features excavated include burial areas where 63 burials were re-
covered, midden heaps, a large rectangular “plaza” area of unknown
usage, a large I-shaped depression of unknown usage, a strata trench
across the center of the site, and 91 cache pits. The major occupation
of the site appears to have been by the immediate ancestors of the
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

Arikara during the period 1600-1750. The other occupation or occu-
pations were somewhat earlier. Among the unusual materials re-
covered were several catlinite pipes, an ornament of turquoise, a piece
of obsidian, and several ornaments made from marine shells. The
burials will provide a good series for study, and the field party was
particularly fortunate to have William M. Bass ITI, physical anthro-
pologist of the River Basin Surveys staff, present to assist in the
excavation of the burial areas. This party returned to the Lincoln
headquarters on September 14, after 13 weeks in the field.

The second River Basin Surveys party in the Oahe Reservoir area,
comprising a crew of seven, was directed by Charles H. McNutt. At
the beginning of the year they were camped with Dr. Stephenson’s
party near Fort Sully and were excavating in the nearby C. B. Smith
site (39SL29) on the left bank of the Missouri River in Sully County,
S. Dak. They uncovered major sections of 2 large circular earth lodges,
10 cache pits, and 17 other features, and tested 2 extensive midden
areas. ‘This proved to be a moderately large earth-lodge village site
of about the early 17th century. After the completion of work there,
the party moved to the nearby Sully School site (39SL7) and exca-
vated 2 houses, 12 cache pits, and 9 other features, tested one midden
area, and trenched a portion of the fortification ditch and palisade.
One of the houses had been a long, rectangular structure with an entry
ramp to the south, while the other was a large circular structure. The
two occupations thus indicated suggest that one belonged to a period
approximating that of the C. B. Smith site, while the other was con-
siderably earlier—perhaps between A.D. 1200 and 1400. The fortifi-
cation ditch and palisade apparently surrounded the later period
occupation. In addition to the excavations at those two sites, the
McNutt party investigated two lesser sites in the vicinity. One,
39SL9, was a small occupation area with a few surface remains. Test-
ing there gave no promise of significant returns for intensive digging
and no further work was attempted. The other, 39SL10, was a burial
site along the edge of the present river bank. Stream cutting had
destroyed all but the last vestiges of it, and there was little to salvage.
The party disbanded and returned to the Lincoln headquarters on
September 14, after 18 weeks of work.

The third River Basin Surveys party in the Oahe Reservoir area
was directed by Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, who was detailed to the River
Basin Surveys for the summer by the department of anthropology of
the U.S. National Museum. Dr. Wedel and a crew of nine worked
near the Old Fort Bennett area on the right bank of the Missouri River
in Stanley County, S. Dak. The party conducted intensive excavations
in site 839ST203, where it uncovered two large circular earth lodges
dating around the 17th century and two large long-rectangular houses
of a much earlier period, perhaps the 14th or 15th centuries. The
SECRETARY'S REPORT 63

floors of the circular houses were 114 to 214 feet below the surface,
while those of the rectangular structures were 31% to 4 feet. Other
features excavated in this site include a burial pit with the remains of
five individuals, and evidence of burning over the top of the corpses.
The party also excavated a circular house and a large portion of the
stockade line at the nearby site, 39ST50. This small fortified village
of the late 18th or early 19th century may possibly be the Truteau vil-
lage of the mid-1790’s. Glass bottles and considerable metal were
found in the site. Dr. Wedel’s party disbanded on August 19, after 8
weeks of excavation.

The fourth River Basin Surveys party in the Oahe Reservoir area
was directed by Donald D. Hartle. It consisted of a crew of seven and
shared a joint field camp with the Wedel party. This party dug test
excavations in three sites during the season. At 39ST11, two houses,
nine cache pits, and several other features were excavated. The houses
were small rectangular structures with single end posts, evenly spaced
side-wall posts, and entrance ramps. Of especial interest was the
small size and short-rectangular shape of these houses, distinguishing
them from the long-rectangular structures of more usual occurrence.
Architecture and artifact collections suggest affiliation with the
early sedentary Anderson Focus of the 14th or 15th centuries. An-
other interesting feature was the remains of three people who had died
within a corner of one of the houses. With them were a whole pottery
vessel and some fragments of basketry. In 39ST23, a dwelling house,
a ceremonial lodge, several cache pits, a palisade and fortification
ditch, and several other features were excavated. The pottery and
circular houses suggest an Arikara occupation of perhaps the 17th or
18th century. The ceremonial house contained an altar, and the wall
posts were set in a trench around the base of the wall. At 39ST45,
three houses, several cache pits, two palisade bastions, and several
other features were excavated. This site was occupied at two differ-
ent times at least, since one house was rectangular and two were circu-
lar. The rectangular house was short and small and represents an
occupation very closely related to that of site 39ST11. The circular
house occupation was not entirely clear, but appears to have been
representative of a culture pattern somewhat earlier than that of site
39ST23. The two palisade bastions were oval in pattern and ex-
tended laterally from a fortification palisade. This field party ended
its work on August 24, after 9 weeks in the field.

The River Basin Surveys’ mobile survey and testing crew of three,
under the direction of Harold A. Huscher, moved from the Big
Bend Reservoir area on September 3 and began a site survey and
testing operation in the Oahe Reservoir area between the mouth of
the Cheyenne River and Whitlocks Crossing on the right bank of the
Missouri River. Heavy vegetation growth and much rain during
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

the season prevented the party from doing extensive site mapping or
reconnaissance in the area, but several of the larger sites were visited
and surface collections were made. A site map and exploratory tests
were made at 389AR8, which appears to be related to the Huff site
in North Dakota. Six other large sites were located and recorded
for the first time in this area. The party disbanded on September
16, after 2 weeks in the Oahe Reservoir area.

The 1958 field season in the Missouri Basin began in the Big Bend
Reservoir area on May 11 with a small party exploring in the vicinity
of the Medicine Crow site (89BF2). William N. Irving with a crew
of three and Mrs. Kathryn H. Clisby, pollen specialist from Oberlin
College, Ohio, collected samples of fossil pollen from various local-
ities in the area. Upon Mrs. Clisby’s departure, Irving and his crew
prepared a detailed map of the Medicine Crow site. On June 10
he increased his party to eight crewmen and added an assistant
trained in geology to work with him on stratigraphic terrace sequences
relating to the geology of the site and its immediate vicinity. They
located one new site containing a large mammalian fossil in a terrace
fill deposit and another site with columnar fire hearths exposed in
a cut bank of the river. Intensive excavations continued in area B
at the Medicine Crow site, and by the end of the year were progress-
ing through the upper 3 feet of the preceramic zones.

On May 19, the second River Basin Surveys field party began op-
erations in the Big Bend Reservoir area. This was a party of 10
under the direction of Robert W. Neuman excavating at two sites
near Old Fort Thompson on the left bank of the Missouri River.
Part of this crew continued work begun last season in the Akichita
site (89BF221) in an attempt to learn details of architectural fea-
tures. Extensive trenching had failed to find any traces of a house
structure by the end of the year, although much midden refuse added
significantly to the specimen inventory. The second section of the
crew continued work begun last season at the Truman Mound site
(89BF224). In that mound group, Mounds 5 and 6 were excavated
during June, thus completing work at the site. In both mounds sec-
ondary burials accompanied by shell, disk, and bone beads were found.
Beneath Mound 6, several projectile points, bone beads, and other
artifacts were found. This party planned to concentrate the re-
mainder of the field season on the several other mound sites in the
immediate vicinity.

The third River Basin Surveys party in the Big Bend Reservoir
area in June consisted of a crew of seven led by James J. F. Deetz.
It began work on June 10 and spent the remainder of the month in
excavations in areas A and C of the Medicine Crow site (839BF2).
Midden areas were trenched, and one circular earth lodge was exca-
vated. This lodge was actually two closely superimposed structures.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 65

Work was continuing at this site at the end of the year. The field
parties of Irving, Neuman, and Deetz shared a joint field camp near
the Medicine Crow site.

The fourth River Basin Surveys field party in the Big Bend Reser-
voir area in June was composed of a crew of 13 directed by Dr. War-
ren W. Caldwell. It began work on June 10 at the Black Partizan
site in an effort to complete excavations started last season. By the
end of the year a circular (or more exactly an octagonal) earth lodge
had been completely excavated and a midden area trenched.

The fifth River Basin Surveys party in the Big Bend Reservoir
area consisted of a crew of seven led by Bernard Golden. It began
work on June 10 at the Hickey Brothers site (89L.M4) and spent the
remainder of the year excavating midden deposits and one circular
depression that appeared to be an earth-lodge ruin. Artifact inven-
tory was small as of the end of the year. The Caldwell and Golden
parties shared a joint camp at the Black Partizan site.

In the Oahe Reservoir area, four River Basin Surveys parties were
in the field during the month of June and a fifth party was scheduled
to begin work early in the next fiscal year. The first party in the
area had a crew of 10 under the direction of Charles H. McNutt.
This group began on June 16, and spent the rest of the month con-
tinuing excavations begun last season at the Sully School site
(39SL7). There, a long expanse of the fortification stockade was
uncovered, and work was well under way toward excavation of cir-
cular earth-lodge structures.

The second River Basin Surveys party in the Oahe Reservoir area
in June consisted of a crew of 23 under the direction of Dr. Robert
L. Stephenson, with Lee G. Madison as assistant. They began work
on June 16 on the Sully site (39SL4) and by the end of the year had
exposed the floors and other features of three circular earth-lodge
structures. Artifact inventories were abundant in all 3, and an area
surrounding 38 sides of each of 2 of the houses was being exposed in
order to learn the nature of materials outside the houses.

The third River Basin Surveys party at work in the Oahe Reservoir
area by the end of the year was that of Richard P. Wheeler. It con-
sisted of a crew of eight and was working on the Fort Bennett site
(89ST12), on the right bank of the Missouri River near Old Fort
Bennett in Stanley County, S. Dak. That party began work on June
19, and by the end of the year had started the clearing of three circular
earth-lodge structures.

On the last day of the year, a fourth River Basin Surveys party
started work in the Oahe Reservoir area. It was comprised of a crew
of six, under the direction of William M. Bass ITI, and was to excavate
the extensive burial area at the Sully site (39SLA4).
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

The McNutt, Stephenson, and Bass parties shared a joint field
camp in the vicinity of the Sully site. Such 2- and 3-party field
camps were proving to be efficient and economical, as many of the
activities and expenses of several parties could be combined. The
necessary field equipment, vehicles, number of cooks, and other ex-
penses were proportionately reduced. The consultative advantage of
having two or three archeologists in a single camp was proving to be
of great help in discussions pertaining to excavation methods and
general archeological interpretations.

Cooperating institutions in the Oahe Reservoir area at the beginning
of the fiscal year included a party from the University of South Dakota
directed by Dr. Wesley R. Hurt, Jr.; a party from the University of
Idaho under the direction of Dr. Alfred Bowers; and a party from
the State Historical Society of North Dakota, directed by Daniel J.
Scheans. At the end of the fiscal year cooperating institutions in the
Oahe Reservoir included a party from the University of South Dakota
directed by Eugene Fugle; a party from the University of Idaho di-
rected by Dr. Alfred Bowers; a party from the State Historical
Society of North Dakota and the University of North Dakota com-
bined, directed by Dr. James H. Howard. In other reservoirs in the
Missouri Basin cooperating institutions had parties in the field at the
beginning of the year as follows: The University of Wyoming, with
a party directed by Dr. William Mulloy in the Glendo Reservoir of
southeastern Wyoming; the University of Kansas, with a party di-
rected by Dr. Carlyle S. Smith in the Tuttle Creek Reservoir of north-
eastern Kansas; and the University of Missouri with a party directed
by Carl Chapman in the Pomme de Terre Reservoir of west-central
Missouri. At the end of the fiscal year cooperating institutions were :
The University of Wyoming with a party directed by Dr. William
Mulloy in the Glendo Reservoir area and the University of Missouri
with a party directed by Carl Chapman in the Pomme de Terre Reser-
voir area. All these parties were operating through agreements with
the National Park Service and were cooperating in the Smithsonian
Institution research program.

During the time that the archeologists were not in the field, they
were engaged in analyses of their materials and in laboratory and
library research. They also prepared manuscripts of technical, scien-
tific reports and wrote articles and papers of a more popular nature.

During January the first steps were taken by the staff archeologists
of the Missouri Basin Project toward a long-range Missouri Basin
Chronology Program. This program is a new departure in the field
of salvage archeology and is directed toward a more precise under-
standing of the time sequences of the prehistoric cultures represented
in the sites being excavated in the Missouri Basin. One primary ob-
jective of the program is to be able to plan future salvage excavations
SECRETARY’S REPORT 67

with increased efficiency. The program includes intensive research in
dendrochronology, radiocarbon-14 dating, pollen analysis, geologic-
climatic dating, typological analyses of artifact materials, historical
documentation, and the several subsidiary techniques applicable to
chronology. Ultimately the program should provide a specific time
scale into which each of the culture complexes represented in the
excavated sites can be fitted with pinpoint accuracy. In the second
half of the fiscal year the Missouri Basin Chronology Program made
several significant accomplishments. A large wall chart and map
were prepared, showing temporal position and geographic location of
all of the archeologically pertinent carbon-14 dates so far available.
A series of 11 radiocarbon-14 specimens were submitted to the Univer-
sity of Michigan for dating. The available dendrochronological ma-
terials on hand in the Missouri Basin were analyzed, and a determina-
tion was made of what further material is needed. Plans were also
made for procuring additional dendrochronological specimens upon
which a series of local master plots can be built. Pollen samples from
ancient bog areas were collected and submitted to Oberlin College for
analyses, and plans were made for further collecting of fossil pollens.
A man with geological training was temporarily added to the staff
to work out a terrace-system sequence along a portion of the Missouri
River, and a series of specimens was submitted to the University of
Michigan proportional counter laboratory for analyses. Representa-
tives from several State institutions are also cooperating in the
program.

The laboratory and office staff devoted its time to processing specimen
materials for study, photographing specimens, preparing specimen
records, and typing and filing of records and manuscript materials.
The accomplishments of the laboratory and office staff are listed in
the following tables.

As of June 30, 1958, the Missouri Basin Project had cataloged
917,370 specimens from 1,762 numbered sites and 52 collections not
assigned site numbers. During the current fiscal year, 8 pottery ves-
sels and 387 pottery vessel sections were restored, and 104 nonpottery
artifacts were repaired. Archeological specimens from 236 sites in 5
reservoirs were transferred to the United States National Museum, as
were selected specimens of dog, bird, and fish bones, and of shell.
Pottery specimens and stone projectile points were transferred to
Region Two of the National Park Service for use as display material
at Wind Cave National Monument in South Dakota. The Missouri
Basin Project received, by transfer from the Nebraska State His-
torical Society, through the courtesy of Marvin F. Kivett, sample
pottery specimens from four prototypical Nebraska sites. Cultural
units and sites of these type specimens are: Dismal River, the Lovett
site (25CH1); Lower Loup, the Burkett site (25NC1); Oneota, the
Leary site (25RH1) ; and Valley Woodland, the Schultz site (25VY1).
These specimens are now a part of the Missouri Basin Project com-
parative collection. The Missouri Basin Project also received by
transfer from the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History,
through the courtesy of Dr. Carlyle S. Smith, archeological collec-
tions from two sites in the Fort Randall Reservoir area, This was a
permanent transfer of excavated materials which increased materially
the research value of Missouri Basin Project collections.

During the Thanksgiving weekend, members of the staff partici-
pated in the 15th Plains Conference for Archeology, held in Lincoln.
On April 19, members of the staff presented papers at the annual
meeting of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences, also held in Lincoln.
On April 30 and May 1 and 2, members of the staff attended and par-
ticipated in the annual meeting of the Society for American Arche-
ology held in Norman, Okla.

Dr. Robert L. Stephenson, chief, when not in charge of field parties,
devoted most of his time to managing the office and laboratory in Lin-
coln and preparing plans for the 1958 summer field season. He spent
SECRETARY’S REPORT 69

some time working on a summary report of the Missouri Basin Sal-
vage Program for the calendar years 1952-56 and wrote several short
papers for presentation before scientific groups. He also worked on a
manuscript on the “Archeological Investigations in the Whitney Res-
ervoir, Texas,” and prepared text, pictures, and captions for a photo-
graphic booklet, “The Inter-Agency Archeological Salvage Program,
After Twelve Years.” During the second half of the year, he served
as chairman of the Missouri Basin Chronology Program. In August
he addressed the Pierre, S. Dak., Rotary Club on “Archeological Sal-
vage in South Dakota.” In October he addressed the Fidelia Lyceum
in Lincoln, Nebr., on “Prehistoric America in Missouri Basin.” In
January he attended and participated in the annual meeting of the
Committee for the Recovery of Archeological Remains, held in
Washington, D.C. On April 19 he attended the annual meeting of
the Nebraska Academy of Sciences, held in Lincoln, and presented a
paper on “The Missour: Basin Chronology Program.” On April 30
and May 1 and 2, at Norman, Okla., he attended the annual meeting
of the Society for American Archeology and participated as a dis-
cussant of a paper presented by Robert Bell, entitled “Caddoan
Relationships to the Plains.”

Dr. Warren W. Caldwell, archeologist, during the fall and winter
months devoted most of his time to analyses of specimen materials
recovered from sites he had excavated over the past year. He com-
pleted all plates, figures, and manuscript text for the final report
“Archeological Investigations in the Coralville Reservoir, Iowa.” He
also completed all plates, figures, and manuscript text for the final
report, “Archeological Salvage Investigations in the Hell’s Canyon
Area, Snake River, Oregon and Idaho.” He prepared a brief tech-
nical manuscript, “Firearms and Connotive Materials from Fort
Pierre II (89S5T217), Oahe Reservoir, South Dakota,” and a brief
popular article, “The Smithsonian Institution in Arkansas.” The
latter was published in the June issue of The Ozark Mountaineer. Dr.
Caldwell also submitted a short note for publication in the Davidson
Journal of Anthropology entitled “Pacific Coast Clay Figurines: A
Contraview.” He submitted a book review of “Northwest Arche-
ology,” esearch Studies of the State College of Washington, vol. 24,
No. 1, that was published in American Antiquity, vol. 23, No. 2, 1957.
During the second half of the year he served as dendrochronology
chairman of the Missouri Basin Chronology Program.

Donald D. Hartle, temporary archeologist, on the staff at the begin-
ning of the year, left the project on August 26 to resume his graduate
studies. Mr. Hartle was formerly a regular member of the staff at
Lincoln and is still working on reports of work done at that time. He
also is preparing a report on the results of his investigations during
the 1957 field season in the Oahe Reservoir area.
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

Harold A. Huscher, temporary archeologist, on the staff at the
beginning of the year, was transferred to the Washington office on Jan-
uary 27 to carry on the explorations in Alabama-Georgia previously
discussed. Between his return from the field on September 16 and
his departure for the Southeast, Mr. Huscher wrote a rough draft of
a manuscript covering his work in the Missouri Basin in the summers
of 1956 and 1957—“Appraisal of the Archeological Resources of the
Big Bend Reservoir, South Dakota.” He also prepared the prelimi-
nary draft of a brief technical manuscript on earth-lodge village forti-
fications in the Missouri Basin, and presented it as an oral report at
the 15th Plains Conference for Archeology in Lincoln on November
28. He participated in the initial stages of the Missouri Basin
Chronology Program.

William M. Bass III, temporary physical anthropologist, left the
staff on August 28. He rejoined the staff in the same capacity on June
2 and remained in the Washington office until June 20, when he pro-
ceeded to the Lincoln office where he spent five days working on a com-
parative human skeleton. He left for the field in the Oahe Reservoir
area on June 28. |

William N. Irving, temporary archeologist, was appointed to the
permanent staff on May 18. When not in the field directing excava-
tions, he was in the Lincoln office analyzing materials he excavated
during the preceding summer and investigating the geological possi-
bilities of the Medicine Crow site (39BF2). He presented a prelimi-
nary report on the archeology of the Medicine Crow site at the 15th
Plains Conference for Archeology on November 28, and a report on
the chronology of the Medicine Crow site at the annual meeting of the
Nebraska Academy of Sciences on April 19. On May 1 he went to
Norman, Okla., and presented a paper on the chronological relation-
ships of the early part of the Medicine Crow site at the annual meet-
ing of the Society for American Archeology. During the second half
of the year he served as geology chairman of the Missouri Basin
Chronology Program.

James J. F. Deetz, temporary archeologist, joined the staff on June
2, and on June 10 left Lincoln for South Dakota to excavate a series
of sites in the Big Bend Reservoir area.

Alan H. Coogan, temporary field assistant, joined the staff on June
2,and on June 10 left Lincoln for the field to serve as assistant to Wil-
liam N. Irving in the geological-archeological work in the vicinity of
Old Fort Thompson in the Big Bend Reservoir area.

Bernard Golden, temporary archeologist, joined the staff on May 19
and on June 10 left Lincoln to begin excavations in an earth-lodge vil-
lage site in the Big Bend Reservoir area.

Charles H. McNutt, archeologist, when he was not in the field, de-
voted most of his time to analyses and the preparation of reports. He

served as carbon-14 chairman, during the second half of the year, in
the Missouri Basin Chronology Program. He completed the final
draft of a major technical manuscript covering part of his previous
summer’s work, entitled “Archeological Investigations in the C. B.
Smith Site (839SL29), Oahe Reservoir, South Dakota.” He also com-
pleted the final draft of an unfinished manuscript begun by Harold A.
Huscher, entitled “Appraisal of the Archeological Resources in the
Big Bend Reservoir Area, South Dakota.” On November 28, he pre-
sented a paper, “Excavations at Two Sites in the Oahe Reservoir, Sully
County, South Dakota,” at the 15th Plains Conference for Archeology
in Lincoln. On April 18 he presented a paper entitled “La Roche
Ware and Relative Chronology” at the annual meeting of the Nebras-
ka Academy of Sciences in Lincoln. From April 80 to May 3 he at-
tended the annual meeting of the Society for American Archeology in
Norman, Okla. He was senior author, with Richard P. Wheeler, of
a brief article entitled “Bibliography of Primary Sources for Radio-
carbon Dates,” which was submitted in June for publication in the
Notes and News section of American Antiquity.

Robert W. Neuman, temporary archeologist, was appointed to the
permanent staff on July 29. During the time he was not directing
field activities he was busy completing the analyses of the data and
materials he had collected and preparing reports on his previous
seasons’ work. He completed the final draft of a major technical
manuscript entitled “Archeological Investigations in the Lovewell
Reservoir Area, Kansas.” On November 28, he presented a paper,
“Excavations in Four Sites in the Big Bend Reservoir Area, South
Dakota.” On April 19 he attended the annual meeting of the
Nebraska Academy of Sciences in Lincoln, and from April 30 to
May 3 attended the annual meeting of the Society for American
Archeology in Norman, Okla.

G. Hubert Smith, archeologist, during the periods he was not
in the field, devoted his time to completion of final drafts of two
major technical reports and one minor report. One major technical
report was “Archeological Investigations at the Site of Fort Ber-
thold II (82ML2), Garrison Reservoir, North Dakota”; the second
was “Archeological Investigations at the Site of Fort Pierre II
(39ST217), Oahe Reservoir, South Dakota.” A brief report on
excavations at site 391.M241 was also completed. On November 29,
he served as chairman for a section of the Plains Conference for
Archeology, devoted to historic sites archeology, and summarized the
reports of the seven speakers. He submitted a book review of “New
Discoveries at Jamestown” by John L. Cotter and J. Paul Hudson,
which was published in the Autumn 1957 issue of Archeology. On
January 2, Mr. Smith was detailed, on a reimbursable basis, to the

492520596
(C2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

National Park Service to conduct archeological excavations at the
site of Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Md.

Richard P. Wheeler, archeologist, was at the Lincoln headquarters
throughout the year until June 20. During this period he spent his
time preparing technical reports on work completed in previous
years. He completed the final section of a draft of a lengthy, detailed
report on excavations conducted during 1949-51 in the Angostura
Reservoir area in South Dakota and the Boyson and Keyhole Reser-
voir areas in Wyoming. He also completed the draft of a technical
report on excavations in the Jamestown Reservoir area in North
Dakota. At the 15th Plains Conference for Archeology, in Lincoln,
he presented a preliminary statement on the Stutsman Focus, and a
paper, jointly with Harry E. Weakly, dealing with the cultural and
chronological sequences at Birdshead Cave, Wyo. A third paper pre-
sented at that meeting dealt with radiocarbon dates and prehistory in
the central and northern Plains. As previously mentioned, he col-
laborated with Charles H. McNutt in preparing a paper for submission
to American Antiquity. From April 30 to May 3 he attended the
annual meeting of the Society for American Archeology in Norman,
Okla.

Snake River Basin—No field explorations were carried on in the
Snake River Basin during the fiscal year. However, one report on
the investigations made there during the previous year was completed.
It is called “Archeological Salvage Investigations in the Hell’s Canyon
Area, Snake River, Oregon and Idaho.” The manuscript consists of
95 typed pages and has 8 plates and 6 text figures. The material and
information upon which the report is based were mainly from two
sites in the vicinity of Robinette, Oreg. Another report pertaining
to the excavations on the Idaho side of the river at Big Bar has not
yet been completed, but it is well under way.

South Carolina-Georgia.—Excavations were made at two sites in
the Hartwell Reservoir Basin during the period from April 22 to
June 21. One of them was located in South Carolina and the other
in Georgia. In addition, three other sites in the South Carolina area
were inspected and an extensive surface collection of artifacts was
made at one of them. Owing to the refusal of the owner to permit
digging, no attempt was made at the latter site to determine its depth
or the extent of its deposits.

One of the sites where digging was carried on is located in the
fork created by the juncture of the Tugaloo and Chauga Rivers. The
site originally consisted of one large mound flanked on either side
by alow mound. During the last 10 to 12 years the large mound was
intentionally reduced in height in order to facilitate cultivation of
the field where it is situated. Consequently its present height of
12 feet above the level of the bottom lands does not represent its
SECRETARY’S REPORT 73

original height and its contour has also been modified. Four test areas
were dug in the vicinity of the present apex of the mound to deter-
mine if possible where the original apex had been, and also to discover
the physical makeup of the feature and the possible purpose for its
construction. One of the test areas exposed the outline of a rectangu-
lar structure with rounded corners and a subterranean floor. The
posts which had formed the walls had been placed at 2-foot intervals.
Because of lack of time the house remains were not completely ex-
cavated. Enough was done, however, to determine its general charac-
teristics. Two of the other test areas showed that the mound had
been erected in several stages over a period of years. In each case
the exterior mantle consisted of a hard-packed bluish-gray sandy clay
which varied from 8 to 6 inches in thickness. Each mantle in turn
had been spread over a layer of clean river sand averaging 1 foot
3 inches in thickness. There had been at least four such features,
and additional digging may reveal still earlier ones. Not much arti-
fact material was recovered, but such as was found indicates that
the latest culture represented probably was Cherokee with an earlier
underlying Etowah horizon. The site may well have been that of the
Cherokee village and mound known as Chauga.

On the Georgia side of the Tugaloo River approximately 2 miles
downriver from the Yonah Dam of the Georgia Power Co. is a village
and mound site which also has Cherokee affinities. This is the largest
site in the Hartwell Basin and lies on a sandy ridge 1,000 feet long
and 150 feet wide which parallels the river. There was a small
mound 150 feet from the northern limits of the ridge which upon
excavation proved to be quite unusual. The top layer or manile
consisted of a sandy humus. This covered a small mound of river
cobblestones of various weights and diameters which was approxi-
mately 2 feet in height and 18 feet in diameter. Directly underneath
the base of the rock mound was a series of seven heavy-packed ash
and calcined bone-filled basin-shaped hearths. Each of the hearths
was circular in outline and averaged slightly over 5 feet in diameter
and from 1 foot to 18 inches in depth. Because of the presence of the
fragmentary calcined bones it was thought that the basins served as
crematory areas over a long period of time. After the last or upper-
most hearth had served its purpose, the cobblestone mound was erected
over the crematory area, perhaps to indicate that it was a place of
particular significance or to protect the features lying beneath it.
Thus far such a manifestation is unique in southeast archeology and
it may indicate a local cult which has previously passed unnoticed
or has not been reported.

Adjacent to and south of the mound were the remains of three
houses representing different types of structure. The uppermost was
approximately square and the walls had been constructed by placing
74 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

individual posts in prepared post holes. Directly beneath those re-
mains was evidence for a large rectangular “town-house” type of
structure measuring 44 feet in length and 26 to 27 feet in width,
with the doorway opening toward the south. The individual post
form of construction had also been used in erecting that structure.
Immediately beneath it and resting upon sterile red clay were the
fragmentary remains of two small circular trench-type houses, the
earliest form of house found throughout the Southeast. Additional
work at this location would undoubtedly yield further evidence per-
taining to the sequence of house forms and might also give a clue
to their significance.

Two unusual ceremonial burials were found in a test area some 40
feet from the house remains. Tubular-shaped pits with saucer-shaped
bottoms had been dug in the clean sterile sand of the ridge. The pits
were approximately 2 feet in diameter and the walls of one had been
lined with small cobblestones, while those in the other were left in
their natural state. At the bottom of each pit, 5 feet 5 inches below
the surface, were the fragmentary remains of a human cranium.
Other bones may originally have been present, but they had long since
disintegrated. The rock-lined pit was filled with a dark humic soil
intermixed with some stones, while the other was filled with clean
river sand. These burials may represent a new trait for that section
of South Carolina, Georgia, and the Southeast. The specimens col-
lected during the course of the work suggest that it was of Cherokee
origin. The site has been identified, tentatively, as that of the Chero-
kee Lower Settlements town of Estatoee by some. Others think
further evidence is needed to demonstrate that such was the case,
since historically it supposedly was on the South Carolina side of
the river. Additional excavations are certainly warranted at that
location.

Cooperating institutions—In addition to the several State and
local institutions cooperating in the Missouri Basin, others partici-
pated in the Inter-Agency Salvage Program in a number of areas.
The University of Arizona carried on investigations in the Painted
Rocks Reservoir basin on the Gila River in Arizona. The Museum
of Northern Arizona continued its explorations in the Glen Canyon
Reservoir area on the Colorado River. The University of Utah also
cooperated in the Glen Canyon project, working the upper end of
the basin. The University of California made surveys and conducted
excavations in the Trinity Reservoir area on the Trinity River, the
Terminus Reservoir on the Kaweah River, in the Coyote Valley
Reservoir area on the Russian River, and in the Washoe Reservoir
basin on the Truckee River. The University of Southern California
SECRETARY’S REPORT 75

worked in the Buena Vista watershed project and the Arroyo Grande
Creed watershed project in California. Idaho State College made
surveys along the Upper Snake, the Salmon, and Middle Fork Rivers
in Idaho. The University of Southern Illinois carried on surveys
and excavations in the Carlyle Dam area on the Kaskaskia River in
south-central Illinois. In New Mexico the School of American Re-
search excavated in the Abiquiu Reservoir area along the Chama
River and made surveys in the Navajo Reservoir area along the San
Juan River in northern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado. The
University of Oklahoma participated in three projects. One con-
sisted of a reexamination of the Fort Gibson Reservoir basin on the
Grand or Neosho River. Surveys and excavations were made there
a number of years ago before the dam was completed and the area
flooded. Because of a greatly lowered pool level last year it was
possible to return to the area and examine a number of sites which
had been under water for some time. The other two projects of the
University of Oklahoma were in the Sandy Creek Reservoir area
along the Blue River and Waurika Reservoir basin along Beaver
Creek, a tributary of the Red River. The University of Oregon sur-
veyed and excavated in two reservoir basins. One was the Immigrant
on Beaver Creek, a tributary of the Rogue River, and the other was
the John Day along the Columbia River. The University of Texas
continued its excavation project at the Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir
along Cypress Creek, a tributary of the Red River in eastern Texas.
The State College of Washington continued excavations in the Ice
Harbor Reservoir area along the Lower Snake River in southeastern
Washington. In the New England area surveys were made on a per-
sonal contract basis by one member of the Department of Anthro-
pology at Harvard University and by a member of the faculty from
Temple University at Philadelphia. All these projects were carried
on under agreements with the National Park Service. In several
areas local. groups continued to assist on a voluntary basis. These
activities were mainly in Ohio, Indiana, and southern California.

ARCHIVES

The Bureau archives continued during the year under the custody
of Mrs. Margaret C. Blaker. From June 1 to6 Mrs, Blaker examined
pictorial and manuscript collections relating to the American Indian
in the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia, and in
the American Museum of Natural History, the Museum of the Amer-
ican Indian, the New York Historical Society, the New York Public
Library, and the Frick Art Reference Library in New York. On
June 13 Miss Barbara Hemphill entered on duty as a summer interne,
detailed to the archives.
76 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

Photographic collections—Anthropologists, historians, publishers,
and interested members of the public continued in increasing numbers
to draw upon the extensive photographic collections of the Bureau as
a source of documentation and illustration. The year’s total of 534
orders and written and personal inquiries concerning photographs
represents a 20-percent increase over the previous year’s figure of
444, and is almost double the 1956 total of 294. The 1,231 prints
distributed is also an appreciable increase over the 1,019 of last year
and 978 in 1956. The preparation and distribution, during the past
2 years, of descriptive lists of specific portions of the photographic
collections have undoubtedly made more searchers aware of the photo-
graphic resources of the Bureau, the result being an increased num-
ber of purchase requests. Lists describing photographs relating to
86 tribes or subjects are now available; 21 such lists were prepared
during the past year.

There were 22 new photographic collections received during the
year, some of which are described below:

A very important collection relating to North American Indians was
received by transfer from the Library of Congress. It consists of some
7,200 photographs pertaining to over 120 tribal units of the United
States, Alaska, and Canada; the Southwest, the Northwest Coast, the
Plains, and the Great Lakes areas are particularly well covered. The
photographs were made by professional photographers from approx-
imately 1890 to 1920, and are of excellent photographic quality. Over
two-thirds of them are outdoor views; the remainder are portraits,
most of which are accompanied by the name of the individual. At
year’s end only a preliminary examination of the collection had been
made. The arrangement and cataloging of the photographs by tribe
and area will be a major project for the coming year.

An album of 60 photographs relating to the several Indian tribes re-
siding on the Muckleshoot Reservation, Wash., in the period 1902-36
was received as a transfer from the Indian Claims Commission,
through the courtesy of Arthur C. Ballard, who made and collected
the photographs. The collection, with detailed captions, includes
portraits of Indian informants and views of native activities and
equipment such as fishing gear, firemaking equipment, ceremonial ob-
jects, houses, and tools.

A collection of about 40 photographs of Plains Indians made by
commercial photographers of the late 19th century was received as a
gift from the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission,
through John Witthoft, chief curator. Another group of 26 such
photographs, including a number of Indian portraits by D. F. Barry,
was lent for copying through the courtesy of Mr. Witthoft.
SECRETARY’S REPORT Gh

A series of about 35 negatives relating to the Acoma, Laguna, and
Taos pueblos and to the Navaho and Paiute tribes, made by Vernon
Bailey during the first decade of the 20th century, was received as a
transfer from the Smithsonian library, where they had been deposited
as a gift from Mrs. Vernon Bailey in 1945.

Thirteen photographs of Chiricahua and Mescalero Apache Indians,
including recent portraits of some descendants of prominent Apache
personalities of the 19th century, were received from Mrs. Eve Ball, of
Hollywood, N. Mex. With the assistance of Apache informants, Mrs.
Ball also provided identifications and notes on several photographs in
the Bureau collections.

Copy prints of 24 portraits and views of activities at Carlisle Indian
School, collected by O. H. Bakeless, ca. 1892-1902, were forwarded by
Dr. Archibald Hanna as a gift from the Yale University Library,
through the courtesy of John Bakeless, who owns the original prints.

Eight copy photographs relating to Indians of Michigan in the
period 1865-ca. 1900, collected from various sources by the Michigan
Historical Commission, were received as a gift from the Commission,
through the courtesy of Dr. Philip P. Mason.

Mrs. Marion Vincent, of Sequim, Wash., lent for copying eight
photographs of elderly Clallam Indians taken at various dates in the
first half of the 20th century, including a portrait of old Doctor Hall,
the boatmaker.

Richard Pohrt, of Flint, Mich., forwarded as a gift eight photo-
graphs of Indians of California and adjacent western States, made by
commercial photographers about 1900.

Six photographs of Seminole Indians made in Collier County, Fla.,
ca. 1900-1928, were received from Dr. Charlton W. Tebeau, of Coral
Gables, Fla., through Dr. William C. Sturtevant.

Two snapshots of the tombstone of Joseph Pawnee No Pashee, first
governor of the Osage (d. 1883), located at Pawhuska, Okla., were
received as a gift from R. B. Schackleford, of Pawhuska.

Manuscript collections.—There is a continued increase in the utiliza-
tion of the manuscript collections by anthropologists and other stu-
dents. About 305 manuscripts were consulted by searchers, either in
person or by the purchase of 9,696 pages of reproductions. In addi-
tion, 68 mail inquiries concerning the manuscript collections were re-
ceived, and a considerable number were examined by the archivist in
preparing replies. As a result of this examination, new and more
complete descriptions of 61 manuscripts were drafted for the catalog,
annotations were added to numerous other catalog entries, and lists
describing certain related groups were prepared for distribution.

Thirteen lots of manuscript material were received in the archives.
The following have been cataloged and made available for reference:

ILLUSTRATIONS

The Bureau staff artist, E. G. Schumacher, continued work during
the year on a wide variety of artistic material for the Bureau of
American Ethnology and River Basin Surveys. An appreciable
amount of time was also devoted to various illustrative tasks needed
by different departments of the Smithsonian Institution.

MISCELLANEOUS

Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist on the staff of the Bureau from
1900 to 1944 and a research associate since his retirement, died at
his home in Newton, Mass., on May 2, 1958. Dr. Swanton is best
known for his extensive work on the Indians of the Southeastern
United States and as chairman of the DeSoto Commission. He was
the author of 5 extensive articles in the Annual Report series of the
Bureau, 12 complete Bulletins, 2 Anthropological Papers, and 2 pa-
pers in the War Background Studies. He was coauthor of three Bul-
letins and edited Byington’s Choctaw Dictionary. His The Indians
of the Southeastern United States, Bulletin 187, and The Indzan
Tribes of North America, Bulletin 145, are outstanding contributions.
The report of the DeSoto Commission, of which he was the unnamed
author, is in continuing demand. Dr. Swanton was a member of the
National Academy of Sciences. He received the Viking Medal and
Award for Anthropology in 1948.

Dr. John P. Harrington and Dr. A. J. Waring continued as re-
search associates of the Bureau of American Ethnology. Dr. M. W.
Stirling, as research associate, used the facilities of the Bureau
laboratory and continued his study of collections made on field trips
to Panama and Ecuador in previous years.

There were 2,772 letters of inquiry about American Indians and
related problems received in the Director’s office during the year.

typescript copies sent out to hundreds of civic organizations such as
the Scouts, Campfire Girls, summer camps, church clubs, and women’s
clubs throughout the country, as well as to the general public. The
information files and bibliographic material were constantly reviewed
by staff members so that the most up-to-date material for term papers
could be sent in answer to hundreds of requests from high school and
college students. Manuscripts were frequently read and appraised by
staff members for colleagues and scientific organizations. Specimens
were identified for owners and data on them supplied.

Report on the Astrophysical Observatory

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1958:

The Astrophysical Observatory includes two research divisions:
the Division of Astrophysical Research, for the study of solar and
other sources of energy impinging on the earth, and the Division of
Radiation and Organisms, for investigations dealing with radiation
as it bears directly or indirectly upon biological problems. Shops—
for metalwork, woodwork, and optical electronic work—are main-
tained in Washington to prepare special equipment for both divisions,
and a shop for high precision mechanical work at Cambridge. <A field
station for solar observation is located at Table Mountain, Calif.

DIVISION OF ASTROPHYSICAL RESEARCH

The most important event of the past year was the activation of the
Optical Satellite Tracking Program, within two hours of the launch-
ing of the first artificial earth satellite on October 4, 1957. The
resulting data have already produced vital new information about
the density and temperature of the upper atmosphere and the earth’s
equatorial bulge. The exploration of space by manned and unmanned
space vehicles continues to receive study, and specific plans have been
formulated for placing an astronomical telescope in a satellite orbit.

The Observatory has pursued its investigation of solar-system phe-
nomena, particularly of cosmic gas dynamics and celestial mechanics};
and studies of the origin, structure, and probable age of meteorites
have continued.

The close liaison between the Astrophysical Observatory and the
Harvard College Observatory, the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, and other research centers in the Boston area continues to
bring mutual benefit. Its long-term goal, to make crucial astronomi-
cal observations and experiments above the atmosphere, is well on the
way to realization.

Solar astrophysics—At the Table Mountain Station, Alfred G.
Froiland has been measuring atmospheric ozone, to determine the
light absorption of ozone in a vertical path, both in the visible spectral
range and in the infrared, from a single spectrobologram; and also,
possibly, to measure the quantity and quality of haze. This study

82
SECRETARY’S REPORT 83

may reveal other related effects of energy absorption in the upper
atmosphere. By calculating theoretical spectra for early-type stars,
and calculating the blanketing effects in the solar atmosphere, Dr. Max
Krook has been investigating the propagation of disturbances through
a stellar atmosphere, and associated phenomena such as radio fre-
quency emission and the acceleration of charged particles. With Dr.
J. C. Pecker, of the Paris Observatory, he plans to apply a method
he has devised for solving equations in nongray atmospheres. Dr.
Krook continues his efforts to obtain exact numerical solutions of non-
linear kinetic equations for the case of shear flow with heat transfer,
and to determine a wide range of values of the Mach number, the
Knudsen number, and the temperature ratio. Such solutions will
bear on the validity of various approximation procedures for solving
Boltzmann equations. The formal mathematical analysis of these and
related problems was completed this year.

Dr. Charles Whitney continued the investigation of gas-dynamical
problems associated with the solar atmosphere and the atmospheres of
variable stars. He has formulated the equations appropriate to the
solar atmosphere; initial integrations have been performed on an
electronic computer, and the stability of the equation is being investi-
gated. From studying variable stars of small amplitude and their
pulsational instability, he hopes to determine the exact limits to the
domains of variable stars, and the properties of variables near these
limits. Spectrographic data on cepheid variables will furnish an
empirical foundation for subsequent investigations of the gas dy-
namics of variable stars. Dr. Whitney is also testing the theory that
the ionization zone is the seat of pulsational instability. During the
year he completed a detailed theoretical explanation of the period-
luminosity relationship, which has significance for problems of stellar
evolution and the size of the galaxy.

Dr. Alan S. Meltzer, before he left the Observatory in September
1957, carried out studies of solar line profiles and the variation of
Doppler half-widths of lines with varying atomic weights, to deter-
mine whether the broadening mechanism is kinetic temperature or
turbulence. The atomic-weight dependence of the Doppler broaden-
ing of these lines corresponds to a kinetic temperature of about 10,000°
K, a value substantially higher than that predicted by accepted
theories of the solar atmosphere.

Upper atmosphere.—Dr. Theodore E. Sterne has been studying the
inferential methods used in evaluating observational data, and the
probable degree of validity of the resulting conclusions—one of the
most important problems in astronomy today. He has developed
methods based on celestial mechanics for inferring the density of the
upper atmosphere from the motions of artificial earth satellites;
84 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

application of the formula indicates a value several times higher than
previous estimates. Such information will greatly improve our
understanding of solar-terrestrial relationships in general. Dr. Sterne
is also developing general literal analytical theories of the motions
of satellites of flattened planets. Since adequate numerical treat-
ments are costly and time-consuming, a comprehensive analytical
treatment is desirable to facilitate the inference of air densities, and
possibly of gravitational anomalies, from observations of satellites.

Balloon experiments relating to stellar scintillation are being carried
out by Dr. J. Allen Hynek and George J. Nielson, in cooperation with
Col. David G. Simons of the Aero Medical Field Laboratory, Hollo-
man Air Force Base, the Winzen Laboratories of Minneapolis, and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Instrumentation Laboratories.
This project hopes to determine how the scintillation spectrum varies
with atmospheric height and the altitude at which the scintillation
effect terminates; to test miniature instrumentation for future use;
and to initiate an airborne research program for the Astrophysical
Observatory.

A new technique that will extend astronomical observations to the
far ultraviolet region of the spectrum and to the X-ray region is being
developed by the Director and Robert J. Davis of the Observatory
staff. This involves the design of a telescope for use in space, and
the completion of related theoretical scientific and engineering studies.

The Director completed a theoretical study of the nature and thick-
ness of the lunar dust layer. He concludes that the layer of loose dust
is not appreciable and that it can consolidate into a porous matrix,
so that it will not be a major hindrance to our exploration of the moon.

Meteoritical studies.—Research on meteors has been emphasized at
the Astrophysical Observatory. The Director’s predictions as to the
small number of meteoritic bodies likely to strike vehicles in space have
been supported by the early data from the artificial earth satellites.
Continuing studies of the relation between meteors and comets are
expected to yield more information about the nature and origin of
comets. Under the supervision of Dr. Luigi G. Jacchia, some 400
meteors photographed with Super-Schmidt cameras have been ana-
lyzed to determine the nature and distribution of meteoritic orbits.
From analysis of the atmospheric decelerations, light curves, and
photographic appearances, he concludes that meteors are highly frag-
mentable and often dissolve into a cluster of fragments. He finds no
evidence for meteors of asteroidal origin among the precise data from
the 400 reductions, and no hyperbolic meteors have been certainly
detected. All photographic meteors appear to be of cometary origin.
From a comparison of visual and photographic magnitudes of meteors,
SECRETARY’S REPORT 85

Dr. Jacchia concludes that visual estimates of meteor brightness are
strongly affected by the Purkinje effect when the meteors are fainter
than magnitude —1. Such an effect is bound to influence all statistics
and extrapolations based on visual meteor counts.

In a study of the width of meteor trails, the Director and Dr. G. S.
Hawkins found that the meteor columns had a finite diameter of
approximately 1.3 m larger than would be expected from diffusion;
the width is attributed to a continuous fragmentation process.

Under the direction of Dr. John S. Rinehart, the Observatory has
expanded its study of meteorites, as projected last year. Much has
already been achieved toward the attainment of the four chief goals:
Collecting and identifying micrometeorites in the upper atmosphere;
designing and constructing an X-ray fluorescent microanalyzer, under
the direction of Dr. F. Behn Riggs, Jr., to use for the point-to-point
analysis of the metallic constituents of iron meteorites; measuring the
abundance of isotopes in meteorites, under the direction of Dr. Edward
L. Fireman; studying the surface features of meteorites for evidence
of ablation. Dr. Rinehart has concentrated on the study of micro-
meteorites and ablation. He and Paul Hodge designed a special col-
lector, for use in aircraft, which filters and recovers particulate matter
from the air. Some 30 high-altitude flights have now collected sev-
eral thousand particles which are almost certainly of extraterrestrial
origin. This program will expand during the next year.

Edward P. Henderson of the U. S. National Museum and Prof.
David Williams of the University of Florida have assisted in the
detailed study of ablation; the surface features of the Grant Meteorite
received particular attention.

Studies of high-speed impact, in which meteoritic material was fired
at bricklike materials, were initiated, and results of these tests are
now being analyzed.

Dr. Edward L. Fireman completed his investigation of the exposure
time of meteorites to cosmic rays, and the energy of cosmic rays in
space, by measuring the argon 39 in the Sikhote-Alin Meteorite. From
measurement of this and other radioactive isotopes, he can estimate
the probable age and original shape of various meteorites, and con-
cludes that the Carbo Meteorite reached the earth about 1,500 years
years ago, and was a nonspherical object in space.

John Wood is attempting to relate the various types of silicate
meteorites to a parent planet, and investigate the processes that take
place during the early stages of planetary evolution. Carlos Var-
savsky, as consultant to the Astrophysical Observatory, carried out
calculations that indicate a lunar origin for tektites; he showed that
the Whipple-Rinehart model for the ejection of tektites from the
86 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

moon could account for their observed distribution over the earth’s
surface.

A metallographic study of the structure of meteorites is being
made by Mrs. Lynne Farrell.

Satellite Tracking Program.—This program, under the direction
of Dr. J. Allen Hynek, began operating on a 24-hour basis immediately
after the launching of the first sputnik. By the end of the fiscal year,
the 12 stations for the optical tracking of artificial earth satellites
were completed. The Baker-Nunn cameras for the precision photo-
graphic program had been installed, and 20 observers and their fami-
lies had reached their posts. Pending the installation of the cameras,
an interim observational program was carried out, under the super-
vision of Dr. Richard E. McCrosky, in Hawaii, and Kenneth Morrison,
in Argentina. Since the cameras began operation they have produced
many successful observations of the satellites, serving as the basis for
scientific research and analysis.

The Moonwatch program, under the supervision of Leon Campbell,
Jr., was activated within a few hours of the first launching. As of the
end of the year, 230 registered teams working all over the world have
contributed valuable data on the various satellites. Since the begin-
ning of the program on October 4, 1957, they have sent more than
4,000 observations to the computations center at the Astrophysical
Observatory.

The reduction and analysis of the optical observations proceeded
under the supervision of Richard Adams. From calculations based on
the computational methods devised by Drs. L. E. Cunningham, T. E.
Sterne, L. G. Jacchia, C. A. Whitney, and D. Lautman, the Astro-
physical Obervatory has been able regularly to provide orbital predic-
tions of satellite passages, vital for the successful optical tracking of
the satellites, and subsequent evaluation of telemetered readings of
on-board instrumentation.

Scientific analyses of data obtained by the Satellite Tracking Pro-
gram were carried out by various members of the staff. From prelimi-
nary determinations of upper atmosphere parameters, basic new
knowledge was gained of the density and temperature of the upper
atmosphere above an altitude of 150 kilometers, which will apply to
the design of future satellites and of rocket-powered glide and skip
aircraft and to problems of reentry of objects in ballistic orbits. Other
new information obtained to date includes an improved value of the
coefficient “J” of gravitational flattening.

In partial fulfillment of its contractual obligations to the Inter-
national Geophysical Year, through the National Science Foundation,
the Observatory issued a series of special reports on the results
of satellite data analysis, at intervals of roughly two weeks. Under
SECRETARY’S REPORT 87

the supervision of Dr. Gerhard F. Schilling, 13 reports issued between
October 15 and June 30 received wide distribution.

In conjunction with the satellite observations, a program has been
developed for obtaining observations of the earth’s albedo. For this
study A. Danjon has developed an ingenious differential photometer.
On the recommendations of Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Dr. George van
Biesbroeck, six stations have now been equipped with the instrument
and preliminary observations have already reached the Astrophysical
Observatory.

DIVISION OF RADIATION AND ORGANISMS

Research on photomechanisms in plants continued, with special
emphasis on those growth responses controlled by low levels of red
and blue radiant energy. Further investigations by Dr. William
H. Klein and Victor Elstad were made of the red, far-red mechanism
that controls photomorphogenic processes in seed germination, seed-
ling development, flowering, and other related responses. In these
responses, the red (620-680 mu) induces the growth response, which
can be nullified by subsequent exposure to the far-red (710-730 my).
SECRETARY’S REPORT 91

If bean seedlings are simultaneously exposed to monochromatic
red and far-red radiant energy, the growth response elicited is deter-
mined by the energy ratio of the two sources. The red response is
dominant, even up to ratios of 1 to 10, although at this ratio the
response is only 50 percent of that produced by red used alone.

The interaction of gibberellin, kinetin, and cobalt with the photo-
process has been studied and evaluated. The results indicate that
there is no direct interaction between red irradiance and the added
substances, although all these materials do exert a modifying influence
on the final growth response. These reactions were assayed by the
measurement of the opening of the stem hook of young Black Valen-
tine bean seedlings, which has been shown to be a quantitative deter-
mination of the growth response.

Dr. John B. Wolff and Leonard Price continued studies on the
effects of radiant energy on the biosynthesis of protochlorophyll in
leaves of higher plants grown in the dark. A single exposure to a
saturating irradiance of red or blue energy converts most of the
protochlorophyll present in the dark-grown leaf to chlorophyll a.
Subsequently, protochlorophyll is resynthesized in the dark from
precursors present in the leaf, but during the first 2 or 3 hours this
process is very slow. Later, the rate of synthesis gradually increases.
The experimental procedure followed was to expose the leaves briefly
to monochromatic energy, then incubate in the dark overnight, and
next test for their ability to resynthesize protochlorophyll. It was
found that red energy near 650 my» is more effective than an equal
quantity of blue energy near 445 my in stimulating the rate of proto-
chlorophyll resynthesis. These wavelengths were selected because
they are at the maxima of the action spectrum for the photochemical
conversion of protochlorophyll to chlorophyll a. If the red irradia-
tion is followed immediately by a treatment with far-red energy be-
tween 710 and 730 my, the stimulatory action due to red energy can
be largely nullified. The far-red energy by itself had little effect on
pigment synthesis.

In a study of the biochemical changes involved in the development
and maturation of the chloroplast of higher plants, some progress
has been made in the isolation of intact proplastids from dark-grown
leaves. In excised leaves which had been irradiated with red energy,
both the protein concentration and dry weight of the isolated plastid
fraction were found to have increased over those of etiolated leaves,
but the protein had increased more rapidly than the dry weight.
Studies are now in progress to determine the conditions for biosyn-
thesis of plastid components, with emphasis on the carbohydrate
energy sources required for such syntheses.
92 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

Dr. Alice P. Withrow and Dr. Walter Shropshire, Jr., measured
the growth of tomato plants given various regimes of light sequences
which involved supplementing a 17-hour period of high-intensity
fluorescent light with 7 hours of red and/or far-red radiant energy.
It was found that neither red nor infrared caused any increase in
height as compared to those that received a 7-hour dark period.
However, a far-red exposure given during the 7-hour period, either
continuously or in a sequence of 15 minutes on and 15 minutes off,
caused the stems to almost double in length. If, in the 7-hour period,
the far-red were followed by red, only a slight growth was noted. If
this procedure were in effect for 14 complete cycles on each of 15 con-
secutive days, totaling 210 cycles, more than 90 percent reversal of
the far-red growth potentiation was secured. Undoubtedly, the far-
red acts as a reversing agent of the red-inhibited stem growth initiated
during the 17-hour high-intensity period. Cycling the far-red with
red prevents the far-red action. It also was found that the chloro-
phyll content of the youngest mature leaves was reduced by 20 per-
cent if they were exposed to 7 hours of far-red. There was little
change if red or infrared were used during the 7-hour period.

It has previously been reported that far-red radiant energy in the
spectral region from 710 to 820 mp, when used as a supplement to
X-rays, significantly increases the frequency of chromosomal aberra-
tions. This year, Dr. Robert B. Withrow and Dr. Carl C. Moh ex-
tended the study to determine the region of far-red which gives the
maximum effectiveness in increasing the X-ray effect on chromosomal
breakage.

Root tips of broad bean (Vicia faba) were pretreated with a 3-hour
exposure of far-red radiant energy of a specific wavelength and then
irradiated with 100 roentgens of X-rays. Using an irradiance of
1500 pw/cm?, wavelengths at 730, 760, 780, 800, and 820 mu were
tested. It was found that roots irradiated at 760 mp yielded 67 per-
cent more chromosomal aberrations than the control (X-rays only),
and those with 780 mp, 54 percent, both increases statistically signifi-
cant. Pretreatment with radiant energy at 800 mp increased the ab-
errations by 20 percent, but 730 and 820 mp gave no increase. It may
be concluded that far-red radiant energy from 760 to 780 mp is most
effective in increasing the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in-
duced by X-rays. In the past year it also was found that red radiant
energy from 620 to 680 mp, when applied subsequent to or simul-
taneous with the far-red treatment, can nullify the far-red potentiat-
ing effect. On the other hand, blue energy was ineffective in re-
versing the potentiation induced by the far-red. This result implies
that the red versus far-red reversible system found at the chromosomal
level is analogous to that occurring in a wide variety of photo-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 93

morphogenic responses, such as seed germination, seedling develop-
ment, and flowering.

In studying the effect of blue light on growth, Dr. Walter Shrop-
shire, Jr., investigated the detailed action spectrum of the first
positive tip curvature of the oat coleoptile, using a grating mono-
chromator and irradiating the coleoptile at 10 my steps from 350 to
520 mp. From this action spectrum, it is concluded that the active
pigment initiating the growth response is yellow, probably carotenoid
in nature, with absorption maxima at 410-415, 440-445, and 470-475
mp. <A flavin photoreceptor appears unlikely, although a peak was
observed in the near-ultraviolet at 370 mp. The curvatures in the
ultraviolet may be due to screening across the plant tissue by an in-
active secondary pigment with an absorption at about 370 mp.

cation.

Effective July 1, 1957, the Pell Collection and other miscellaneous
ceramics were transferred to the United States National Museum
collections to form the division of ceramics and glass of the newly
established Museum of History and Technology, and the curator of
ceramics, formerly under the National Collection of Fine Arts, was
made acting curator of the division.

Special catalogs were published for the following 10 exhibitions:

Mr. Beggs gave a talk on Regionalism in American Art to the Art
League of Manatee County, Fla.; spoke on Paintings of the Passion
of Christ at the Rock Springs Congregational Church, Arlington,
Va.; and gave a talk on Private Collections Publicly Maintained to
the Arts Club of Washington. He served on the juries of two local
shows.

Mrs. Pope departed June 18 for Europe to see the exhibits of the
United States and other countries at the Brussels International Fair
and to visit England, Holland, France, Italy, Greece, and Switzerland
to study new exhibitions and make selections of some for circulation
here.

Rowland Lyon served as juror for eight local shows.

Thirty-three paintings in oil on canvas from the permanent col-
lections were cleaned and revarnished, 2 were relined, and 48 picture
frames were repaired and refinished. One plaster cast and one bronze
statue were cleaned and refinished. One painting by George Catlin
was relined to repair a 22-inch tear in the canvas, for the United States
National Museum.

The 18-foot ceiling decoration, “Dawn,” by Thomas W. Dewing, in
the Gellatly Collection, was renovated by Henri G. Courtais and in-
stalled in a specially constructed pavilion. In addition, Mr. Courtais
restored “Aurora Borealis,” by Frederick E. Church, “Madonna and
Child with Apple,” by an Old Flemish Master, and made minor re-
pairs to “Entombment,” by Rogier van der Weyden.

Glenn J. Martin cleaned and removed old repaint on 11 paintings
recently acquired.

Twenty oil portraits of World War IT leaders by John C. Johansen
and pastel drawings of the Civil War Veterans by Walter Beck have
been removed from the second floor gallery and are to be installed at
the south end of the foyer together with the miniature portraits in
specially lighted cases.

The oil portrait of President John Tyler, by G. P. A. Healy, was
copied by C. Gregory Stapko in November 1957.

CHANGES IN EXHIBITIONS

Changes in exhibitions amounted to 1,468. This unusually large

redecoration of exhibition galleries. The changes were as follows:

LIBRARY

The prime requirement of the library is service from and through
books. It is well known that what has once been published is often
forgotten and the rediscovery in the library may be a more difficult
process than the first discovery. All the modern refinements of cata-
loging and the invention of the fabulous fact-finding push-button ma-
chines are directed toward making rediscovery easy, but in the last
analysis the ultimate dependence is still upon human brains and skills.

The expanding program of work and the many new projects being
initiated find some of the subjects inadequately covered by the litera-
ture in the Gallery library. Other libraries owning the required ma-
terial have been most generous in furnishing it through interlibrary
loan.
SECRETARY'S REPORT as}

The 878 publications acquired during the year included purchases,
gifts, and those sent in exchange for Freer publications. Unfortu-
nately, the prices of books and periodicals continue to increase, and a
good many institutions and societies that formerly sent their journals
freely, in exchange or gratis, now find it necessary to charge for them
in order to assure continuity of publication.

Outstanding among the purchases last year were: Japan Biographi-
cal Encyclopedia & Who’s Who, compiled by the Japan Biographical
Research Department, 1958, which is the first good Japanese biogra-
phy in English since Papinot did his Historical and Geographical
Dictionary in 1909; Gunsho ruishé [Shin ko], a collectanea of miscel-
laneous writing, compiled by Kawamata Kydichi, Tokyo, 1931-37, 24
volumes with 3 supplements and index in 105 volumes; Awez-ch“i-lai,
a makimono painting illustrating T‘ao Ch‘ien’s “Homecoming Ode.”
This is a copy of a part of the Freer painting 79.119, which is attrib-
uted to Li Kung-lin. Professor Sirén’s notes and comments on the
paintings are attached to the scroll. The Yunkang, the Buddhist
Caves . . . , which began publication in 1951, was completed with 16
volumes in 36 folio volumes.

The year’s record of cataloging included a total of 1,879 entries of
which 714 analytics were made, 451 titles of books and pamphlets were
cataloged, and 48 titles were recataloged and reclassified. Once more
the specialized nature of the library and its unique importance for the
study of Oriental art are emphasized by the fact that less than 8 per-
cent of the necessary cards were available as printed cards at the
Library of Congress. This shows the original and difficult catalog-
ing required in a specialized library.

PUBLICATIONS

One publication was issued by the Freer Gallery as follows:

Ars Orientalis. The Arts of Islam and the East, vol. II. The Charles Lang
Freer Centennial Volume. 637 pp., 224 pls., and text ills. (Smithsonian

248 black-and-white slides. Total negatives on hand, 11,563; 3,000
old slides were removed, and present inventory for lantern slides totals
7,005; 354 reproductions in the round of Freer Gallery objects were

BUILDING

The roof and exterior of the building appear to be in good con-
dition; minor repairs were made and leaks in the skylights fixed
from time to time. The daylights in each of the Gallery ceilings and
the east and west corridors were replaced.

The work of making exhibition cases for the galleries and new
bookcases continued in the cabinet shop, and miscellaneous odd jobs
related to storage, exhibition, restoration, crating, and maintenance
of office and Gallery equipment were carried on as usual. Much time
was given to various jobs arising as air-conditioning of the building
was completed, such as a thorough cleaning of the attic and rein-
stallation of the exhibition galleries.

All plants, trees, and shrubs appear to be doing well. The trumpet-
vine and trellis at either end of the south side were removed and the
azalea bed was transplanted and rearranged. One Mahonia beali was
planted in the southwest corner. One Cotoneaster salicifolia was re-
placed. The four plots of grass were removed and resodded completely
with zoysia grass. The grass, as well as all the plantings around the
fountain, has made an excellent showing. Lantanas have been planted
for the present season and are doing well.

On October 29, 1957, a gift of one notebook and three booklets of
Arabic inscriptions to be added to the Herzfeld Archive was received

Report on the National Air Museum

Sim: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the National Air Museum for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1958:

Of outstanding importance to the National Air Museum during the
year was the progress made in the matter of a site for a new building.
On June 26, 1958, the United States Senate passed S. 1985, a bill in-
troduced by Senator Clinton P. Anderson, authorizing the prepara-
tion of plans for the construction of a suitable building for a National
Air Museum to be located on the site bounded by Fourth and Seventh
Streets, SW., Independence Avenue, and Jefferson Drive. At the
close of the year the bill had gone to the House of Representatives
and had been referred to the Committee on Public Works. The
passage of this bill by the Senate marks a long step toward the
realization of many years’ efforts in the matter of adequate housing
for the National Air Museum.

Many important accessions were received. Notable among these
were the General William Mitchell statue and a Vanguard rocket.
These are on exhibition in the Arts and Industries Building.

Progress was made in the improvement and preparation of storage
and restoration facilities. These facilities take on increasing impor-
tance as the planning of the exhibit for the new building progresses.

A new and improved exhibit in the Aircraft Building is in the
planning stage. In addition to providing a much-needed change in
this old exhibition space, it will serve as useful experience in plan-
ning the aeronautical exhibits for the new building.

The Museum’s information service continued as a growing and
active function during the year. ‘Technical, historical, and biographi-
cal information pertaining to the development of aviation was fur-
nished by the staff for Government agencies, universities, research
workers, authors, teachers, students, and the inquiring public. The
reference files, photographic files, and library of the Museum con-
tinued to expand in volume and usefulness with the acquisition of
additional data and materials from many sources.

Two Honorary Fellows of the National Air Museum, Capt. John J.
Ide, USNR, and Frederick Crawford, were appointed during the
year. A Director of the National Air Museum, Philip S. Hopkins,
was appointed and assumed his duties in February 1958. An associate
curator, Louis S. Casey, was also added to the staff.

ADVISORY BOARD

One meeting of the Advisory Board was held, on October 11, 1957.
The Secretary introduced the new member of the Board, Rear Adm.
R. E. Dixon, USN, who succeeded Rear Adm. James S. Russell, whose
appointment terminated July 12, 1957. The other members, Dr.
Leonard Carmichael, chairman; Maj. Gen. Reuben C. Hood, Jr.,
representing the Chief of Staff, Department of the Air Force; and
the Presidentially appointed citizen members, Lt. Gen. James H.
Doolittle, USAF (Ret.), and Grover Loening, continued their service
on the Board.

At this meeting the Board recommended the appointment of the
Director and Honorary Fellows above named, and also recommended
the appointment of Paul E. Garber as head curator and historian of
the National Air Museum.

The Board reaffirmed its approval of the Mall site for the National
Air Museum Building.

SPECIAL EVENTS

Several notable presentation ceremonies took place during the year.
The outstanding one was the unveiling and acceptance of the Gen.
William Mitchell statue, sculptured by Bruce Moore, and the gift of
the late George H. Stephenson. The statue was unveiled on Decem-
ber 17, 1957, by William Mitchell, Jr., in the presence of members
of the Mitchell family, the Stephenson family, and some 200 distin-
guished guests.

Other special ceremonies during the year included the presentation
of a “Falcon” guided missile by the Honorable Barry Goldwater,
United States Senator from Arizona, on behalf of the Hughes Air-
eraft Co., on April 15, 1958; an Air Mail Medal of Honor, presented
by Deputy Postmaster General Edson G. Sessions on May 14, 1958;
and a “Vanguard” rocket and satellite, presented by Rear Adm. Raw-
son Bennett of the United States Navy, on May 26, 1958.

At these presentation ceremonies, Dr. Carmichael accepted the gifts
for the Musuem with appropriate remarks.

The National Air Museum was well represented on numerous oc-
casions throughout the year by the head curator and historian, Paul
KE. Garber. Mr. Garber’s activities included the following:

The Early Birds, an organization of those who flew solo during
the first 13 years of powered heavier-than-air flight (prior to Decem-
ber 17, 1916) held their annual reunion in Washington July 27-29,
1957. They enjoyed a tour of the aeronautical exhibits conducted by
Mr. Garber, who is secretary of this organization. Their interest
was increased not only because of their personal association with the
128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

beginnings of aviation but also because this Museum has been desig-
nated by them as depository for their archives and historic specimens.

The Institute of Aeronautical Sciences held a joint meeting with the
Navy at San Diego, August 1 to 16, where, at the Institute Building,
a display of aircraft, scale models, photographs, and paintings illus-
trated the growth of naval aviation from its origin in 1911 to the
present. In the opinion of many persons who attended, this was the
most complete historical display of this type ever assembled. The
organizers acknowledged the important assistance extended by this
Museum which provided most of the scale models. During this meet-
ing Mr. Garber lectured on “Glenn Curtiss, Founder of Naval Avia-
tion,” illustrating his talk with slides, a number of which were rare
views of the aircraft developed by this famous air pioneer.

On May 13, the District of Columbia Chapter of the Institute of
Aeronautical Sciences heard a lecture by the head curator on “The
History of Aeronautics.” This was a condensation of a four-part
series delivered by him at monthly meetings of the Institute chapter
formed of students in aeronautical engineering at the Catholic Uni-
versity in Washington.

The association of Air Mail Pioneers, composed of those who op-
erated the governmental postal aviation system from its beginning in
1918 until 1927 when the routes were converted into commercial air-
lines, held the annual meeting of the Eastern Division in Washington,
October 10-11. The Museum cooperated with preparation of a special
display of airmail relics, scale models and photographs of airmail
planes, and related material. A conducted tour of the collections
and a talk on Max Miller, the first postal aviator in the departmental
service, were given by Mr. Garber, who was recently president of the
District of Columbia chapter of this organization. On May 15, 1958,
this chapter headed the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of
the first continuously scheduled public service airmail route. The
head curator assisted with arrangements for a flight over the original
Washington-to-New York route in an airplane of 1918 piloted by Leon
Smith, one of the original group of airmail pilots; and with the prep-
aration of a bronze plaque which was unveiled on the anniversary date
to mark the field from which the inaugural flight had started. Another
feature of this airmail anniversary was a ceremony at the National
Aviation Club when an example of the Air Mail Flyers’ Medal of
Honor was added to the Museum collections. Authorized by act of
Congress in 1931, it has been awarded only 10 times, “for distinguished
service as an airmail pilot.”

Cooperating with the Armed Forces, Mr. Garber lectured on the
history of aeronautics to the Non-Commissioned Officers’ School at
the Air Force Base in Orlando, Fla., and gave talks on various phases

SS
SECRETARY’S REPORT 129

of aviation to the Air Force Flying Club at Andrews Air Force Base
in Maryland, the Army Flying Club at Fort Myer, Va., and to several
units of reserve officers and the Civil Air Patrol. At the request of
the Navy Department, the talk on Glenn Curtiss was repeated before
the combined Naval Reserve companies of the Washington area. Con-
ducted tours of the aeronautical exhibits were provided for a group
of naval enlisted men selected for their proficiency in aviation, and
for units of the Reserve Officers Training Corps. <A talk on Brig.
Gen. William Mitchell and a description of his statue in the Museum
was given at the Air Force Historical Association meeting at Bolling
Air Force Base, September 6. A similar talk was made on January
8 at a meeting of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, of which the General
had been a member. On February 19 the Washington chapter repre-
sented the fraternity in laying a wreath at the base of that statue, and
on April 25 the American Legion paid similar tribute.

The head curator served as chief judge at the National Model Air-
plane Contest held in Cleveland, March 27, where he spoke on the
recent progress by the Museum in acquiring significant material; and
during the same month he was judge at a model contest conducted
by the Washington Junior Chamber of Commerce.

Tours of the aeronautical collections were conducted for groups of
young aviation enthusiasts at the request of Congressmen Peter Mack
of Illinois, and Robert W. Kean of New Jersey. In all, Mr. Garber
gave during the year 24 lectures, conducted 6 tours, and made 7 trips
in connection with these educational services and for inspection of
material offered to the Museum.

IMPROVEMENTS IN EXHIBITS

Some improvements were made during the year in the exhibits in
the Aircraft Building and the Arts and Industries Building. With
the unveiling of the William Mitchell statue, this became a permanent
part of the exhibit in the Aeronautical Hall of the Arts and Industries
Building. With the statue is a case containing Mitchell memorabilia,
and directly adjacent is the restored and reconditioned SPAD-XVI,
General Mitchell’s airplane. Twenty dioramas lent by the U.S. Air
Force, depicting the development of military aeronautics from the
Civil War to the present time, were installed in this hall and provide a
colorful and instructive exhibit. A revolving globe, with flight path
and model airplanes illustrating the first “Around the World Flight,”
was added to the Collier Trophy case. The “Falcon” guided missile
exhibit was added to the Aircraft Building.

Improvements were made to several exhibition cases by adding
overhead lighting and powered displays. These improvements in-
volved the Pulitzer, Lowe, Mitchell, and Collier cases.
130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

Minor repairs were made to a number of aircraft and models on
exhibition.
REPAIR, PRESERVATION, AND RESTORATION

Tt has been a year of activity at the Suitland storage facility in re-
spect to improving equipment and facilities and in preservation,
restoration, and warehousing. The proper warehousing of stored air-
craft, engines, and parts was completed. Five aircraft were cleaned,
preserved, and restored, awaiting exhibition. Twenty engines were
cleaned, preserved, and stored. Four aircraft were preserved for
outdoor storage.

Water and electrical connections were installed for Building 10, and
a concrete ramp was placed in front of the building. The heating of
Bay C of this building was improved and the insulation of Bays A
and B was begun. Other improvements in progress include roof re-
pairs, the installation of a paint booth and equipment, a wash pit for
aircraft and engines, and an engine hoist. The storage of miscel-
laneous reference material in Building 2 was improved by boxing and
warehousing.

Considerable long-range planning was done in preparation for the
major job of restoration and preparation of aircraft for exhibition in
the proposed new building.

ASSISTANCE TO GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS

The National Air Museum had occasion to serve many Government
agencies during the year. Among these were the Department of Jus-
tice in connection with patent litigation; the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare with relation to rocket information; the
Voice of America in connection with material for its programs; the
Department of State with reference to early aviation history informa-
tion; the Department of the Air Force; the Department of the Navy;
the Department of Agriculture; the Civil Aeronautics Administration
of the Department of Commerce; and the Post Office Department.

PUBLIC INFORMATION SERVICES

As previously indicated, furnishing information to the public is
a very active function of the Museum and requires an increasing
amount of staff time. The requests for information vary from “pic-
tures of airplanes” for school children to highly technical information
required by scientists and research workers. The requests come by
telephone, mail, and personal visitation. The following examples
will illustrate the diverse nature of this information service:

The Chance Vought Aircraft Co. and the Douglas Aircraft Co.
were furnished photographs for their publications.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 131

world with Wiley Post in the Lockheed Vega airplane “Winnie Mae,” June
23-July 1, 1931, when Mr. Gatty was navigator. (N.A.M. 973.)

GopparpD, Mrs. Estuer, Worcester, Mass.: A portrait of the late Dr. Robert H.
Goddard, 1882-1945, ‘Father of Rocketry,” painted in oils by Mrs. Emily
Burling Waite Manchester. (N.A.M. 970.)

HAMILTON, Epwarp G., Old Westbury, L.I., N.Y.: The donor’s original Flight
Log for the years 1922-1926, including the period in 1924 when he was test
flying Stout Air Pullman planes, in 1925 when he was pilot for the inaugural
run of the Ford Airlines, and in 1926 when he flew the first contract airmail
between Detroit, Cleveland, and Chicago. (N.A.M. 958.)

Herrick, Scotr H., AND CORNELL, Mrs. SUZANNE HERRICK, New York, N.Y.:
The Herrick “Vertoplane”’ of 1937, and devices associated with the aero-
nautical experiments of the late Girard P. Herrick. This aircraft is an early
example of the types generally classed as convertoplanes which combine
the flight performance of airplanes with the vertical-lift, sustentation, and
descent characteristics of rotorcraft. In July 1937 this piloted aircraft ac-
complished what is believed to be the first midair conversion from fixed-wing
to rotary-wing flight. ‘The associated devices received with this aircraft
include wind-tunnel models, control mechanisms, test models of rotors, and
instruments. The donors are the children of Mr. Herrick. The assistance of
Mrs. G. P. Herrick, Ralph McLarren, and John Glennon in obtaining this
material is gratefully acknowledged. (N.A.M. 994.)

HueHeEs AircrRAFT Co., Culver City, Calif.: A “Falcon” GAR-1 guided missile,
mounted on a display panel having transparency illustrations of air-combat
methods, and a sound recording describing this missile, which is in current
use by U. S. Air Force interceptor planes, for air-to-air combat. The formal
presentation of this display was by Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona,
the Missile Manufacturing Division of the donor being in that State.
(N.A.M. 984.)

KAaAuir, Orro, New York, N.Y.: Six glider models made by Robert Kronfeld,
famous Austrian designer and pilot of high-performance sailplanes. He was
first to make a continuous glide for 100 kilometers, first to soar across the
Alps, and made notable intercity glides. These beautifully made models,
given to the donor who was a close friend, include the “Wien,” in which
Kronfeld established world records for motorless flight of 93.15 miles distance
and 7.084 feet altitude in 1929. He was killed while test piloting an English
military airplane, 1948. (N.A.M. 989.)

Lear, Inc., Grand Rapids, Mich.: The Lear F-5 Electropilot equipment, devel-
oped by the donors to provide automatic flight control for high-performance
aircraft. Subject of the Robert J. Collier Trophy Award for 1949. (N.A.M.
950.)

for airplanes; production examples invented by the donor. One is of solid
steel and adjustable pitch with an airfoil of thin section to reduce weight
and of concave-convex shape to improve rigidity. Following a test by the
Army Air Corps in 1933 when this make of propeller improved the takeoff,
climb, and speed of a training plane, it was adopted by both the Army and
Navy, for use with trainers, and continued in use for 10 years. The other
propeller received, with the trade name MET-L-PROP, was developed in 1947
for use with light airplanes. It is of aluminum alloy, fixed pitch, forged
in one piece including the hub section. (N.A.M. 990.)

968). A full-size exterior duplicate of the “Vanguard” rocket-powered satel-
lite vehicle which on March 17, 1958, carried America’s second satellite into
orbit around the earth. This achievement by the U.S. Navy, with the vehicle
manufactured by The Martin Company, followed about six weeks after the
U.S. Army’s “Jupiter” had carried America’s first satellite, the “Explorer,”
into orbit, and over 5 months after Russia had made the initial success.
This “Vanguard” was formally received for the National Air Museum by Dr.
Leonard Carmichael, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, from Rear Adm.
Rawson Bennett, Chief of Naval Research. The ceremony was held in the
rotunda of the Arts and Industries Building of the U.S. National Museum
where the top of the “Vanguard,” exhibited in launching position, reaches
72 feet in height. Near the floor beside the vehicle is shown a reproduction
of the 6-inch-diameter, 314-pound satellite which has been continuously
circling the earth since launched, and will probably continue to orbit for years
tocome. (N.A.M. 992.)

Honor, authorized by Congress February 14, 1931, for presentation by the
President of the United States to pilots who perform distinguished service in
connection with airmail operations. Ten pilots have received it. The placing
of this medal in the National Aeronautical collections was one of the cere-
monies of the fortieth anniversary of the first continuously scheduled public
service airmail route, established May 15, 1918, between Washington, Phila-
delphia, and New York. At the anniversary ceremony, Dr. Leonard Car-
michael, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, received the medal for
the Museum from Deputy Postmaster General Edson G. Sessions. (N.A.M.
991.)

RICKENBACKER, Capt. Epwarp V., Eastern Air Lines, New York, N.Y.: A Verville-
Sperry ‘Messenger’ airplane of 1920, designed by Alfred Verville, and manu-
factured by the Lawrence Sperry Aircraft Co. by order of Brig. Gen. William
Mitchell who realized that a “motorcycle of the air’ was required for military
liaison services; and a Pitcairn ‘“Mailwing” of 1928, developed by Pitcairn
Aviation, Inc., for their use in operating Contract Air Mail Route No. 19
between New York and Atlanta, later absorbed by Eastern Air Lines. ‘“Mail-
wings” were used also on other airmail routes of the 1920’s and early 1930’s.

Report on the National Zoological Park

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1958.

EXHIBITS

A complete animal exhibit is one in which the animals are kept in
secure surroundings that satisfy the requirements of the animal, is
esthetically pleasing to the public, and contributes to an increased
knowledge of the animals and their behavior. This is the goal of the
National Zoological Park.

During the year the collection has been balanced and adjusted.
Progress is bemg made toward exhibiting more North American
fauna, while not neglecting the display of exotic species.

The year’s most important zoological event at the Park and perhaps
in any zoo in the United States was the conception and birth on May 18,
1958, of a snow-leopard kitten. Never before has there been a birth of
this rare and beautiful leopard in the Western Hemisphere, and the
records indicate that only five kindlings are known in the worldwide
history of zoos. So far as can be ascertained, there have been only two
kittens successfully reared. The kitten, a female, was abandoned by its
mother after 24 hours and has been hand-reared by Zoo personnel.
The first six weeks of its life were extremely critical, requiring almost
constant attention. After a great deal of uncertainty and suspense, it
is now apparently healthily established and vigorously growing.

A new program was instituted for training the elephants. A pro-
fessional elephant man, Roger MacDonald, was hired as a keeper, and
he has been teaching the two 10-year-old Indian elephants, Ashoka
and Shanti, and the two little elephants, Nancy, an African, and Dixie,
an Asiatic, to obey commands. The ends of the tusks of Ashoka, the
male Indian, were growing so close together that it was beginning to
be difficult for him to raise his trunk or feed himself. Rather than
saw off the tusks, Mr. MacDonald fashioned a set of braces which are
correcting the defect.

The Siberian crane, Grus leucogeranus, celebrated its 52d birthday
in the Park shortly before the close of the fiscal year. As far as is
known, this constitutes a longevity record for cranes in captivity. The
rare female Mongolian wild horse has also achieved a longevity record
for its species of 32 years.

GIFTS

The Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior
has continued to cooperate in the procurement of desirable species of
North American birds and animals. Outstanding among accessions
this year are a pair of trumpter swans on deposit here. These beauti-
ful North American birds had almost vanished a few years ago, but by
careful management on the part of the Department of the Interior they
have been saved from extinction. These two were collected by Winston
E. Banko in the Red Rock Lakes National Waterfowl Refuge in west-
ern Montana. Other stations of the Fish and Wildlife Service have
sent the Zoo four woodcock, a bald eagle, an osprey, and numerous
species of wild ducks.

Through the Animal and Bird Protection Board of Hobart, Tas-
mania, three Tasmanian devils were obtained. They had not been
shown in this collection for many years.

The Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp, Belgium, sent the Zoo
a fine pair of great black-casqued hornbills. These were formally
presented by Baron Leopold Dhanis of the Belgian Embassy on
January 16, 1958.

Jack Marks, director of the Portland, Oreg., Zoo, in cooperation
with the U.S. Navy, Operation Deepfreeze, brought back a number
of Adelie penguins. Some of them went to the zoos in Portland,
Oreg., San Diego, Calif., and New York, N. Y., and 12 were brought
to the National Zoological Park and Johns Hopkins University.
These birds are being studied by specialists in aspergillosis, the
fungus disease that attacks penguins and other birds. The U.S.
Navy also obtained for the Zoo a group of albatrosses of two species,
Diomedea nigripes and D. immutabilis, but unfortunately the birds
did not survive, the longest that any one lived being three months.

The U.S. Army, 6th Infantry Division, stationed in Berlin, Ger-
many, sent the Zoo a European brown bear that had been given them
as a mascot by the citizens of Berlin on Armed Forces Day, 1957.
The new recruit was so successful in his placement as mascot that
he was soon promoted to private first class. Later he did what many
soldiers have wanted to do—bit the first sergeant. He was imme-
diately demoted to private, and in consequence thereof a short time
later he went AWOL, causing great consternation in the regiment
and in the city of Berlin. Despite his seemingly erratic Army career,
he has been discharged honorably from the United States Army and
is now enjoying his civilian life at the National Zoological Park.
“Teddy” was formally presented by the Honorable Dewey Short,
Assistant Secretary of the Army; representing the West German
Republic was Brig. Gen. Wolf Dietrich Von Steinmetz; and Dr.
142 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

Leonard Carmichael accepted for the Smithsonian Institution and
the National Zoological Park. The bear’s cage is appropriately
decorated with the seal of the Sixth Infantry and the seal of Berlin.
The Zoo is fortunate in having among its friends members of the
Armed Forces who, when stationed abroad, are always on the lookout
for rare and interesting animals. Dr. Robert E. Kuntz, of the Navy
Medical Research Unit in Taipei, Taiwan, sent a number of speci-
mens including an eared pangolin, which, although it seemed to be
doing well, lived only four months. Lt. Col. Robert Traub, stationed
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya, sent a linsang (Prionodon linsang), a
species never before exhibited in this collection, as well as a number
of particularly interesting reptiles. Other animals collected by these
men are included in the following list of gifts of special interest:

er reptiles.

San Diego Zoological Society, San
Diego, Calif., Uta lizards.

Woodland Park Zoo, Seattle, Wash.,

BIRTHS AND HATCHINGS

The snow leopard, previously referred to, is the outstanding birth
of the year. A gibbon hybrid, offspring of another hybrid, was born
on January 6, 1958, and is being raised at home by Keeper Herbert R.
Stroman. Vicky Jean, the black-faced chimpanzee born on June 20,
1957, has become one of the Zoo’s most popular exhibits. She now
spends most of each day in her cage but is still taken home at night
by Bernard Gallagher, the keeper who raised her.

Because of their curious life history, the hatching of Surinam toads
in captivity is always of interest. One of the Zoo’s females laid eggs,
the male carefully embedded them in her back, and 30 little toads
eventually hatched.
144 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

A new incubator and brooding pens have been installed in the bird
house. Intensive efforts are being made to incubate eggs laid at the
Zoo.

One of the signs that an animal is doing well in captivity is its
ability to reproduce its kind and, as the following list shows, the num-
ber of mammals, birds, and reptiles born in the National Zoological
Park during the year is gratifying:

The total number of accessions for the year was 1,411. This in-
cludes gifts, purchases, exchanges, deposits, births, and hatchings.
A determined effort was made this year to accept as gifts, purchases,
or exchanges only those animals that fit into the long-range exhibition
plans of the National Zoological Park.

The collection has fewer individuals listed this year because many
species were felt to have an excessive number of individuals and have
been adjusted to a more reasonable number in relation to the over-all
collection, thus providing a more balanced exhibition. Several minor
species which are best displayed in large numbers do not have an
individual count, merely being listed as ‘‘many.”’

GIRAFFES

During the past 20 years, the National Zoological Park has been
very successful in breeding giraffes and gaur. A summary of both
species 1s presented here, in order that it may be made a part of the
permanent record.

The first giraffes to come to the Zoo were a pair of Nubian giraffes
obtained from the Game Department of the Sudan by Dr. William M.
Mann on the Smithsonian Institution-Chrysler Expedition to East
Secretary's Report, 1958 PLATE 9

Africa in 1926. Known as Hi-Boy and Dot, they both succumbed to
a kidney infection, one after a year, the other 3 months later.

There were no more giraffes in the collection until 1937, when the
Smithsonian Institution-National Geographic Society Expedition to
the Netherlands East Indies stopped in the Sudan on the way home
and acquired four young ones, a pair of dark-spotted and a pair of
light-spotted Nubian giraffes. The dark ones became known as Kitty
and Bob. Bob died in 1956, but Kitty is still alive in the Zoo. The
other pair were named Nicky (after a 10-year-old journalist who had
campaigned for “giraffes for the National Zoo”) and Nageoma, for
National Geographic Magazine. Nicky died in December 1945, and
Nageoma in July 1946.

The breeding record follows:

November 1, 1952, female, offspring of young pair.

August 12,1953, male. Exchanged May 25, 1955.

August 22, 1954, female. Sent to St. Louis Zoo, St. Louis, Mo., April 26, 1956.

February 12, 1956, male. Still in the Zoo.

March 5, 1957, female. Offspring of young pair. Died March 7, 1957.

March 18, 1958, male. Offspring of young pair. Still in the Zoo.

The high mortality rate is due, in almost every case, to the excitable
temperament of these animals. The old male died on May 26, 1957,
apparently of senility. The old female is still living, but she has not
accepted the young male.

FINANCES

Funds for the operation of the National Zoological Park are appro-
priated annually under the District of Columbia appropriation act.
The appropriation for the fiscal year 1958 totaled $833,000, which in-
cluded a supplemental appropriation of $49,000. This was an in-
crease of $113,000 over fiscal year 1957. The increase consisted of
$49,000 for the conversion of keeper positions; $36,300, contributions
to the Civil Service Retirement Fund; $22,595 to establish seven new
positions, and $5,105 to cover costs of reallocations. Of the $833,000
appropriated, $619,165 was for salaries, leaving a balance of $213,835
for the operation of the Zoo. Included in this balance were major
operational expenditures amounting to $177,513, consisting of $65,000
for animal food; $20,300 for fuel for heating; $29,325 for materials,
building construction and repair; $34,218 for Civil Service Retire-
ment Fund; $12,750 for purchase of animals; $8,900 for electricity ;
$5,000 for veterinarian equipment and supplies; and $2,000 for Fed-
eral Employees Group Life Insurance. The balance of $35,872 in
operation funds was expended for other items including freight, tele-

phone, telegraph, and postal services, sundry supplies, uniforms, gaso-
line, road repair, equipment replacement, and purchase of new equip-
ment.

PERSONNEL

After serving as Acting Director for 17 months, Dr. Theodore H.
Reed was named Director on March 12, 1958. At the same time, J.
Lear Grimmer, who had been Assistant Director, was named Asso-
ciate Director.

James F. Wright, V.M.D., a graduate of the University of Penn-
sylvania, was appointed to fill the position of veterinarian. He comes
to the Zoo with experience in private veterinary practice as well as
service with the Department of Agriculture’s Plum Island Animal
Disease Laboratory, in Long Island, N.Y. He has a makeshift hos-
pital in the Park, which it is hoped may some day be replaced with a
more modern structure. His report for the year may be found on
pages 171-174.

As of the beginning of the fiscal year, the animal keepers were con-
verted from the GS classification to Wage Board. They are now on
a pay level comparable with other skilled trades, such as carpenters
and plumbers. It is believed that the present starting wage will at-
tract good men and that the salary will induce them to stay in the Zoo.

There are 144 authorized positions at the Zoo, divided as follows:
Administrative office 13, an increase of one property and supply
clerk; animal department 53 (48 keepers, cook, exterminator, 2 labor-
ers, and an increase of 1 storekeeper) ; police 23, an increase of 2;
mechanical department 50, an increase of 2 laborers and 1 store-
keeper; grounds department 5.

There has been a reorganization in the animal department. Ralph
Norris is now head keeper and Malcolm Davis, who has had 30 years
experience in the Zoo, is now associate head keeper. William Widman
is senior keeper in the bird division, Charles Thomas in the division of
large mammals, Bert Barker in the division of small mammals, and
Mario DePrato in the reptile division. In the police department three
men were promoted to the rank of Sergeant: Donald B. Bell, Earl A.
King, and Aubrey L. Canter. In the mechanical shop, William G.
Modena was made assistant superintendent of maintenance and
construction.

INFORMATION AND EDUCATION

The Zoo continues to handle a large correspondence with persons all
over the world who write for information regarding animals. From
every part of this country citizens write to the Zoo as a national insti-
tution. Telephone calls come in constantly, asking for identification of
animals, proper diets, or treatment of disease. Visitors to the office as
well as to the animal exhibits are constantly seeking information.
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1958

Because of the ever-increasing demand for information concerning
the care of animals in captivity, a series of 11 mimeographed leaflets
has been written covering the care and feeding of the various animal
families, ranging from invertebrates to primates. The leaflets are
used to supplement correspondence and telephone inquiries on pet
care and have proved successful in providing better service to the
public.

The Associate Director gave five 4-hour sessions of training to six
senior Boy and Girl Scouts. These youngsters are now qualified to
guide troops of younger Scouts when they visit the Zoo.

The Director spoke before 6 civic clubs, 2 school groups, and 5 church
groups; he also appeared on a television program and was interviewed
cnaradio program. He wascoauthor, with Dr. Samuel W. Thompson,
of “Toxoplasmosis in a Swamp Wallaby,” published in the Journal of
the American Veterinary Medical Association, December 15, 1957.

Malcolm Davis, associate head keeper, spoke before four civic clubs
on “Penguins and Antarctica” and also showed slides to a school group.
He has contributed articles and book reviews to All-Pets Magazine,
the Audubon Magazine, the American Racing Pigeon News, the
Aviculturist’s Gazette, the Sentinel, and the Journal of Mammalogy.
A group of rocky islands off Budd Coast, Antarctica, has been named
Davis Islets in recognition of a biological survey made there by Mr.
Davis in 1948 when he went to the South Pole with the U.S. Navy
Expedition.

Mario DePrato made a collecting trip in the Dismal Swamp, Va.,
bringing back a number of interesting reptiles for the Zoo. William A.
Xanten, Jr., a keeper in the reptile house, contributed a number of
snakes and turtles obtained while he was on vacation in Florida.

William Widman, senior keeper in the birdhouse, spent 2 weeks in
the Philadelphia Zoological Park, studying methods practiced there;
and Bernard Gallagher, keeper in the small-mammals division, spent
a week of official time in the Detroit Zoo, working and observing.

Ordinarily the Zoo does not conduct guided tours of the Park, but
exceptions were made for groups of physically handicapped children
who visited the Zoo. One group was from the District of Columbia
Health School, whose children were brought by the Kiwanis Club,
and another from the Silver Spring Intermediate School. Six chil-
dren from the Pre-School! for the Blind, Alexandria, Va., were brought
by the Lions Club and were allowed to feel small animals and harmless
reptiles. ‘The District of Columbia Society for Crippled Children
brought a group of 30. In all cases police and keepers were assigned
to assist in showing the young students the exhibits.

Conducted tours were also given to a group of 211 biology students
and 6 faculty members of Randolph-Macon Woman’s College, Lynch-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 71

burg, Va., and to 40 boys and girls who were winners in the annual
Westinghouse Science Talent Search.

While the Zoo does not conduct a regular research program as
such, every effort is made to study the animals and to improve their
health, housing, and diet in any way possible.

VETERINARIAN’S REPORT

One of the most important activities of the veterinary department
has been the application of the projectile type of syringe as an ad-
junct to therapy. The original work on this equipment was done
at the University of Georgia and the Georgia Fish and Game Com-
mission. They produced a temporary paralysis in wild deer, using
nicotine alkaloid either alone or in combination with thiopental so-
dium. An attempt was made to adapt this method to the zoological
collection, but met with very little success except in deer. The ap-
paratus is used with little disturbance to animals in their captive
habitat. Its most effective use is in the administration of antibiotics,
antiserums, ataraxics (sedatives, narcotics, tranquilizers), and vac-
cines. With this type of therapy it is not necessary to rope, man-
handle, trap, cage, or exhaust either animals or keepers to provide
parenteral medication. It is successfully used both inside and outside
of buildings and in small lots and large paddocks. As the operator
seldom needs other help, considerable saving in man-hours and an-
imals results. The following species have been successfully treated
with this projectile type of syringe: elk, zebra, yak, tiger, pygmy
hippopotamus, British Park bull, Saiga antelope, camel, elephant,
kangaroo, bear, deer, Nile hippopotamus, and giraffe. The full de-
tails of these treatments are contained in a paper to be published
later.

A severe case of necrotic stomatitis developed in the Zoo’s bull elk
during the winter, which prevented him from eating the usual rations.
Special diet and the use of the projectile syringe are credited with
effecting a cure. He is now in excellent health.
