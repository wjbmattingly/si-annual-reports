JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 21, 1885.

The annual meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution was held this day at half-past 10 o’clock, a. m.

Present: Hon. G. F. EpMuNDs, Hon. J. S. MORRILL, Hon. S. B.
Maxey, Hon. O. R. SINGLETON, Hon. W. L. Wixtson, Hon. W. W.
PHELPS, Rev. Dr. JOHN MACLEAN, Rev. Dr. NOAH PORTER, Dr.
HENRY CoPpPEE, Dr. JAMES C. WELLING, and the Secretary, Professor
BAIRD.

Excuses for non-attendance were read from Chief-Justice Waite,

Prof. Asa Gray, and Hon. N. P. Hill.

In the absence of the Chancellor, on motion of Mr. Phelps, Dr. Por-
TER was called to the chair.

The journal of the Board was read and approved.

The Secretary stated that the Rev. Dr. NoAH PORTER had been
re-elected a Regent for six years by the joint resolution of Congress,
approved March 3, 1884.

The Secretary, presented to the Board the following letter :

Prof. SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution:

DEAR Sie: The state of my health renders it necessary to tender my
resignation as a member of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution.

In signifying my resignation it is with no ordinary feelings I recall
the years I have been connected with the Board and the distinguished
men with whom it has been my privilege and honor to be associated.
Not only the present members whom | so highly respect and esteem,
but a long list of honored names of former members now deceased, re-
cur to me, the last of which is that of Professor JoSEPH HENRY, and
while JAMES SMITHSON will be known to the world and remembered
as the founder of the Institution, JosEPH HENRY will be regarded as
having been raised up by a signal Providence, the true interpreter of

his will, the able organizer of the Institution, and wise controller of its
finances.

May the Smithsonian Institution, so auspiciously established and ex-
tensively known, continue, under your wise administration, an esfab-
lishment distinct and specific, for the ‘ increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge among men.”

With great respect, your friend and servant,
PETER PARKER.

2 LAFAYETTE SQUARE,

Washington, D. 0., April 7, 1884.
XII JOURNAL OF THE BOARD.

_ The Secretary informed the Board that Congress had filled the va-
cancy occasioned by the resignation of Dr. Parker by the election of
Dr. JAMES C. WELLING, president of Columbian University of Wash-
ington, D. C., for six years from May 13, 1884.

On motion of Dr. Maclean it was—

Resolved, That the Board of Regents has heard with regret of the
resignation of Dr. Peter Parker, and hereby expresses the high appre-
ciation of the valuable and efficient services he has rendered the Insti-
tution for the past seventeen years as a Regent and as Chairman of
its Executive Committee.

The Secretary stated that in accordance with the rules of the Board
during its recess, the remaining members of the Executive Committee
had filled the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of Dr. Parker, by
the appointment of Dr. Welling.

On motion of Dr. Coppée it was—

Resolved, That Dr. Welling be elected to fill the vacancy in the Ex-
ecutive Committee.

The Secretary reported that in accordance with the request of the
Board at its last meeting, Senator Edmunds had prepared a Dill rela-
tive to the provision for an Acting Secretary, which had passed Con-
gress and become a law on the 13th of May, 1884, as follows:

An act to provide for the appointment of an Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
[Public No. 31, Forty-eighth Congress, first session. ]

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the Chancellor of the
Smithsonian Institution may, by an instruinent in writing filed in the
office of the Secretary thereof, designate and appoint a suitable person
to act as Secretary of the Institution when there shall be a vacancy in
said office, and whenever the Secretary shall be unable from illness,
absence, or other cause to perform the duties of his office; and in such
case the person so appointed may perform aJl the duties imposed on the
Secretary by law until the vacancy shall be filled or such inability shall
cease. The said Chancellor may change such designation and appoint-
ment from time to time as the Institution may in his judgment require.

Approved, May 13, 1884.

Under the provisions of this act the Chancellor had taken the fol-
lowing action:

LYME, CoNnN., July 2, 1884.

By virtue of the authority conferred on me by the act of May 13,
1884, ‘“‘to provide for the appointment of an Actinig Secretary of the

JOURNAL OF THE BOARD, XIII

Dr. Maclean presented the annual report of the Executive Commit-
tee, which was read.

On motion of Dr. Coppée it was—

Resolved, That the report of the Executive Committee be accepted,
and that the income for the year 1885, be appropriated for the service
of the Institution upon the basis of the above report; to be expended
by the Secretary with full discretion as to the items, subject to the
approval of the Executive Committee.

The Secretary presented the following communication he had received
since the last meeting of the Board:

JUNE 2, 1884.
SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution,
Washington, D. C.:

Sir: I intend to make a bequest for the advancement of science—
that is, of physical science. For many reasons I would like to make
the bequest in favor of the Smithsonian Institution; but there is one
difficulty which must be cleared up before I can decide. If money were
left by will to the Smithsonian Institution would it defend the will
against the claims of any and all persons who should contest the will
and take legal steps to set it aside? Has it authority by law; has it
funds that it would be authorized to use for the purpose of defending a
will in its favor? As I have no children the will would be less likely
to be contested, but there are others who might attempt to set it aside.
For this reason what I wish above all to be assured of is that any legacy
that I leave for the purpose named will not be given up without making
a fight of it if needful. Please explain this point.

I wish you to send me a form of words, the very words themselves,
in which a bequest should be made so that there could be no pretense
of setting it aside for vagueness ; and that will carry out my intentions,
which I will explain:

The chief part I would desire to bequeath to the Institution would
be for the “ increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,” and beside
would wish to have the Institution invest say $300 (is that too insig-
nificant for the purpose?) and use the income thereof for conferring a
gold medal either annually or biennially (which would be the better ?)
on the person who had made the most important discovery in physical
science during the year, or two years ending, say a year before the date
of conferring the medal. For example, the Regents would have to
decide, say in the month of December, 1883, who made the most im-
portant discovery in physical science during the year, or two years,
ending December 31, 1882. If you have my meaning put it in language
that will make it perfectly clear without multiplying words.

The medal not for any patented invention, like the electric light, for
example, but especially and only for such discoveries as Pasteur on in-
fection, fermentation, &c., and G. Darwin’s on tidal action. Regents
to be sole judges as to what is meant by physical science and most im-
portant discoveries therein.

The reason why I would like to have not only suggestions and ex-
planations but the full “TI will and bequest to” its also because I don’t
know whether to say the Regents shall do this or that, or whether to say
a majority or quorum of them shall do it in order to make it both strictly
legal and also practicable; also, whether or not it is necessary to say
‘how the Regents shall invest the money. I suppose a copy of that part
XIV JOURNAL OF THE BOARD.

of Hamilton’s or Huebus’ (Habel ?) will would answer for the part re-
lating to the “increase and diffusion,” &c. As for the medal I believe
no fund has been left to institutions for that purpose, and I should like
to have your opinion on it.

Please return this letter with your answer, which I would like you to
let me have as soon as you can; taking, however, all the time you need
to make it so full and explicit that no further correspondence will be
necessary at this stage. I mean business if your answer is satisfactory.
For the present I desire this affair to be treated as confidential, or if
necessary to mention to other parties, withhold the name.

There is one thing I had rather do than make a bequest in favor of
the Institution, namely, pay over a certain sum, say $2,000 or $2,500,
in trust to the Regents; provided I could receive the income during
life, the Institution to have the sole use and possession of the same after
my death. Would the Institution be authorized to accept a sum of
money on such terms ?

Respectfully,

* * * *

After full discussion of the subject it was, on motion of Mr. Edmunds—

Resolved, That the communication be referred to the Executive Com-
mittee with full power to act in relation to it.

The Secretary, Professor Baird, presented his annual report of the
operations of the institution for the year 1884, which was read in part.

On motion of Dr. Maclean, the Secretary was instructed to transmit
the report to Congress.

On motion of Mr. Edmunds, it was—

Resolved (1), That the fiscal year of the Institution shall hereafter ter-
minate on the 30th day of June in each year.

(2) That the Secretary shall hereafter prepare and cause to be printed
and sent to each member of the Board on or before the first day of De-
cember in each year, his annual report.

(3) That the annual meeting of the Board of Regents shall hereafter
be held on the second Wednesday in January in each year. :

The Board then adjourned sine die.

The balance (January 1, 1884), $802.17, of the appropriation for pre-
paring the scientific report of the Polaris expedition, has been expended
during the year, according to the certificate of Major Hobbs, October
6, 1884, disbursing clerk of the Treasury Department.

The appropriation by Congress of $900 to reimburse the Institution
for its expenditures in connection with the Henry statue, was received
from the Treasury Department in October, 1884, and is included in the
statement of receipts for the year.

The committee has examined the vouchers for payments made from
the Smithson income during the year 1884, all of which bear the ap-
proval of the Secretary of the Institution, and a certificate that the
materials and services charged were applied. to the purposes of the
Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the National
Museum and find that the balances above given correspond with the
certificates of the disbursing officers of the Interior and Treasury De-
partments.

The quarterly and annual accounts-current, the check-books and
journals have been examined and found correct.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION
OF THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE SMITHSONIAN IN-
STITUTION.

Prof. 8. F. BAIRD,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution:

Sir: We have the honor to submit a report of the operations pertain-
ing to the fire-proof reconstruction of the east portion of the Smithson-
ian building, which was commenced in the month of April, 1883, and
completed during the last year.

For a proper understanding of the conditions under which this work
was executed it may be well to recall a few steps in the life of the whole
building.

On the 28th of January, 1847, the plans of James Renwick, esq., of
New York, were adopted, bids for the completion of the whole building
were invited, the work awarded on the 9th of March, and the corner-
stone laid on the 1st of May following. Five years were stipulated for
the completion of the work under the building contract.

On the 26th of February, 1850, the interior framing and floors of part
of the center building, intended to contain the museum of apparatus,
fell down into the basement before completion, and on July 3, 1850, a
committee of the Regents of the Institution reported “that the interior
of the main building is defective in the kind of material originally
adopted and to a considerable degree in the quality of the material em-
ployed, which consists principally of wood. The money was mainly
expended upon the cut-stone work of the fronts.” The committee rec-
ommended “that the interior of the center building be removed and
that a fire-proof structure be substituted for it.”

In January, 1853, the plans of Capt. B. S. Alexander, U.S. A.., for fire-
proofing and finishing the interior of the center building were adopted,
and the author of the plans intrusted with the superintendence of this
work, which was commenced in June, 1853, and completed in Decem-
ber, 1854. It included a lecture room with unsurpassed optical and
acoustic properties, accommodating 1,800 persons. Unfortunately for
the building the term “fire-proofing” had in those days simply refer-
ence to floors and walls, so that the fire-proofed center building still
retained a combustible wooden roof, like all other public buildings
erected about the same time.

A fire occurred on the 24th of January, 1865, which destroyed this
roof, and with it all the interior of the upper story of the main building
and the adjacent towers. The executive committee of the Regents re-

xXIx
xx REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS.

ported that careful survey forced upon them the conviction that “the
original construction of the building as a whole was very defective and
unsuited as a receptacle of valuable records. The two wings and con-
necting ranges, which were not injured by the fire, are defective in ma-
terial and construction. The floors in some cases, though covered with
flagging, rest upon wooden beams, which are decayed, and in a few
years the interior of these parts will require removal.”

The Regents decided that the restoration should in all parts be inde-
structible by fire, and intrusted Adolf Cluss, architect, with the plans
and superintendence of the work, which was carried on shortly after
the close of the war, when material and labor had risen to the highest
mark.

The second story of the center building was fitted up as a hall for
Government collections, and was covered with an iron and slate roof;
five towers were fitted up with iron and brick floors, partitions, and roofs,
and with iron stairs. This work was completed in the season of 1867.
Fire-proof floors were substituted in 1871 for the decayed lower wooden
floors of the west wing and of the northwest arcade, and in 1873 a steam-
heating apparatus was put in the building.

The east wing, then called the chemical wing, was originally arranged
for one large lecture-room, provided with seats for 1,000 persons, and
the adjoining range was fitted up for two apparatus-rooms in close prox-
imity with the lecturers’ table. When the improved lecture-room in the
main building was completed in 1854 there was no longer any use for
the now antiquated room which absorbed the whole east wing. Hence,
this wing was temporarily divided into two stories, with wooden floors, and
studded, lathed, and plastered partitions. The lower floor was arranged
in alarge room for handling all articles of exchange. &c. The second
story was fitted up with a suit of rooms for the accommodation. of the
Secretary of the Institution, in accordance with the original intentions
of the Regents, and the high space above was left unfinished as a loft.

The fenestration became, in the newly arranged two stories, most
anomalous. The tall windowsof a lofty lecture-room being subdivided,
the old frames came to be in the lower story very near to the ceiling,
and almost on a level with the floor in the upper story. The connect-
ing wing, as altered, accommodated simply two middle-sized offices, with
the cloister along the exposed north front, through the open arches of
which rain and snow drifted, and rotted the wooden floor-joists so much
that they had to be temporarily supported from the cellar. Before long
the open arches of the cloister had to be filled in with temporary wooden
windows, which barely kept the weather out.

Above the first story of the range there was a second story, of no
practical value, since the external architecture limited the size of its
windows to bull’s-eyes of 24 feet in diameter, &c.

The museum was shut off from the eastern main entrance by direct
obstructions and by floors on two different levels.
REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS. XXI

This deplorable condition of the east wing, continued for a series of
years, demanded in the end prompt action, and in March, 1883, an ap-
propriation of $50,000 was made by Congress for the fire-proof recon-
struction of the eastern part of the Smithsonian Institution, to which
$15,000 were added in July, 1884, for completion and furniture.

Under these appropriations the old “ chemical wing” was stripped of
the combustible constructions; so much of the exterior walls as de-
pended upon the wooden frame work was carefully taken down; all or-
namental cut-stone work, consisting of copies from doors, windows, and
cornices of divers monastic edifices in France and Germany, was laid
aside and reset in the walls during the progress of the work. The
dark and damp cellar, containing 4,500 square feet of floor space, was
drained, and provided with a Portland cement floor upon a concrete
foundation, and converted into dry working-rooms in best sanitary con-
dition. Onthe ground floor cheerful offices were arranged on both sides
of a broad and level corridor, by which the old museum is reached in a
direct line from the east entrance. The formerly useless and anomalous
second story was rearranged into two stories of ten feet clear height
for offices, with adequate light and air, and covered with a metal roof,
fastened in a fire-proof manner upon concreted brick arches.

Above the ground floor of the east wing there were but six badly
lighted and ventilated rooms in a second story. These were replaced
by seven well lighted and aired spacious offices, and a similar space
was gained in each of two upper stories for offices and document-rooms.
This wing is crowned by a pitched medieval wrought-iron roof, covered
with slate hung to iron pur-lines for the steep portions, and with metal
upon hollow terra-cotta tiles for the flat portions.

There are arranged above the basement, in all, 36 office rooms, con-
taining 12,500 square feet floor space. ;

In the progress of the work the exterior walls were strengthened, sub-
stantial brick walls were built for the interior partitions, and supports
of the fire-proof floors consisting of concreted brick arches sprung
between rolled-iron beams.

All the rooms are provided with extra large gas-pipes and flues end-
ing above the roof, so that eventually either of them may be used by the
scientists for experiments. There are tubes laid throughout for inter-
communication by means of oral annunciators, and piping for clocks.

Documents may be raised or lowered from the outside of the building
to the basement by a hoist, and from there distributed to the archives
in the different stories by means of an elevator of cheap construction.

A compact low-pressure steam-heating apparatus warms the whole
section promptly and comfortably at a moderate expense.

The exterior architecture was simply modified by resetting all the
architraves and cornices at such levels as to enable valuable space
within the building to be made useful for laboratories, offices, work- .
rooms, archives, and store-rooms, by enlarging some of the windows as
XXII REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS.

necessary for the new conditions, by supplying a small quantity of plain
cut stone, and by adding Norman dormers of cut-stone work for light-
ing the space within the pitched roof of the west wing.

A financial statement accompanies this report, which gives the cost of
all branches of the work in detail and requires no comment.

With the completion of the work, as above reported upon, the prin-
cipal part of the Smithsonian building is now, from foundation to roof,
beyond the reach of any serious fire. Still the reconstruction is not com-
plete as long as the west wing and adjoining range above the ground floor
are of combustible construction. During a conflagration in those com-
bustible parts of the building, the main building in the center would
probably be considerably damaged by water.

In the center building some repairs are necessary, and the first story
ought to be re-arranged, so that the available space can be made more
useful for the purposes of the Institution.

We have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obed’t,

REPORT OF PROFESSOR BAIRD, —

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR 1884.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith the report of the
operations and condition of the Smithsonian Institution for the year
1854. This, in accordance with the usual custom, will include an ac-
count of the work performed by the Smithsonian Institution itself, as
well as that of the branches of the public service placed by Congress
under its charge, namely, the National Museum and the Bureau of Eth-
nology. To this will be added a sketch of the work of the United
States Fish Commission, which is also under my charge; and of that
of the U. S. Geological Survey, kindly furnished by its Director.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
INTRODUCTORY.

Outside of the regular routine work of the Institution, an account of
which will be furnished in its proper place, are the details connected |
with the participation, in 1884, by the Smithsonian Institution in the
exhibitions at Cincinnati, Louisville, and the International Cotton Ex-
position at New Orleans, with which your Board was charged by order
of Congress. A full account of the history of these undertakings will
be given hereafter.

An increasing number of national organizations for the promotion of
science has received accommodation in the lecture-room of the National
Museum during the year, in accordance with thé authority of the Board.

The repairs to the eastern portion of the Smithsonian building have
been completed, with the exception of a few minor details, and the offices
re-established.

The general progress of the Institution during the year, and that of
the public service under its control, has been satisfactory. The Smith-
sonian funds are in good condition, the new year being entered upon
free from any indebtedness and with a satisfactory balance on hand.

The publications of the Institution have been continued, and numer-
ous additions have been made to the library. The work of the Inter-
national Exchange service continues to increase, and will, it is hoped,

it
2 REPORT OF TILE SECRETARY.

be placed upon a still more definite and satisfactory basis during the
year 1885.

The additions to the Museum have been unexampled in extent, con-
sequent partly upon the acquisitions made in connection with the ex-
hibitions just referred to, and partly upon the labors of the Geological
Survey, of the Ethnological Bureau, of the United States Fish Commis-
sion, and of numerous miscellaneous explorations, both public and pri-
vate.

THE HENRY STATUE.

The appropriation of $15,000, made some years ago by Congress, for
the erection of the Henry statue did not quite cover all the expenses,
and the sum of $900 was advanced from the funds of the Institution.
Believing, however, that it was the intent of Congress that this statue
should be placed in position without cost to the Institution, application
was made for the sum named, which was duly allowed. The money has
been paid over and placed to the credit of the Institution.

PROFESSOR HENRY’S SCIENTIFIC WRITINGS.

At the meeting of the Board of Regents of January 17, 1883, a reso-
lution was introduced by Dr. Maclean to provide for the republication
of Professor Henry’s scientific writings. A committee appointed at the
last meeting of the Board, January 16, 1884, consisting of Prof. Asa
Gray, Hon. William L. Wilson, and your Secretary, has had the subject
under consideration, and has decided that the resolution only covered
such of Professor Henry’s articles as had actually been printed, and espe-
_ cially the portion prior to his entrance upon his duties at Washington.
The editing of this publication was intrusted to Mr. Wm. B. Taylor, who
has been engaged in collecting the necessary material. The commence-
ment of the work has gone to press, and a sample is submitted for the
information and criticism of the Regents.

JAMES SMI'THSON.

In the Life of Smithson,* published by the Institution a few years ago,
the author, Mr. Rhees, says: ‘It is an interesting subject of speculation
to consider the motives which actuated Smithson in bequeathing his
fortune to the United States of America, to found an institution in the
city of Washington. He is not known to have had a single correspond-
ent in America, and in none of his papers is found any reference to it
or to its distinguished men. It has been alleged that he was more
friendly to monarchical than to republican institutions, but there ap-
pears to be no foundation for this opinion. * * * By selecting the
United States as the depository of his trust he paid the highest compli-

ment to its intelligence and integrity, and testified his confidence in
republican institutions and his faith in their perpetuity.”

It is gratifying to be able to confirm this supposition by information
which has recently been communicated to this Institution. The follow-
ing letters from a grandson of Davies Gilbert, president of the Royal
Society, and an intimate friend of Smithson, were received during the
past year:

ENYS, PENRYN, CORNWALL, ENGLAND,
March 13, 1884.
Prof. S. F. BARD,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution :

Str: Some years since I noticed, while I was living in New Zealand,
an advertisement for any letters or information relating to Mr. Smithson,
addressed especially to descendants of Sir Davies Gilbert and others.

_ On my return to England.I came across a letter written by Smith-
son, dated Paris, May 9, year 4, (1792), under his first name, James
L. Macie, and addressed to my grandfather, Mr. Davies Gilbert (never
SiR). Should you wish for a copy of this letter and any information
relative to his passing at Oxford, and short notes by my grandfather
written in his pocket-book, I shall be glad to send them.

I should have inclosed copies, but fear the ‘life’ projected may be

long since published.
Yours, truly,

JOHN D.-ENYS.

ATHENZUM CLUB, PALL MALL, S. W.,
May 16, 1584.

My DEAR Sir: I have lately returned from fishing in Scotland, and
write to acknowledge your answer to my letter re Smithson.

On my return to Cornwall next month I will copy from my grand-
father’s pocket-books the entries relating to him as Mr. Macie, and for-
‘ ward a copy of the only letter I know of from him written from Paris
when the Revolution was first under way.

I shall be grateful if you could forward me here, or to my address in
Cornwall, any life or account of Mr. Smithson such as you have already
published. :
Yours, truly,

JOHN D. ENYs.

ENYS, PENRYN, CORNWALL,
August 23, 1884.
My DEAR Sir: I am afraid that the following extract from my grand-
father’s pocket-books and addresses to the Royal Society of London will
be of very slight value to you.. I know of no other letter of his, but
any under the not familiar name of Macie I have no doubt were long ago
burnt. Should any farther information turn up I will forward it.
I shall be glad to hear if you think right to publish the inclosed, which

were written on the leaves bound up in Mr. Davies Gilbert’s pocket-
books, and should like copies of any information which has been pub-
lished before.
You are at liberty to destroy the extracts or publish them, as you
think best towards Smithson’s memory.
Yours, truly,
JOHN D. ENYs.

“‘ Macie, afterwards Smithson, was a Gent. Com. when I entered at
Pembroke College.

‘‘ His mother’s husband was a country gentleman, to whose estates he
has succeeded; but the first Duke of Northumberland was allowed on
all hands to be his father. At the time of his matriculation I have
heard that a blank was left for his surnames, Mr. Macie having at that
period instituted suit to annul his marriage, which the wife defended.
The Dutchess of N. then died, when Mrs. Macie wished the marriage
dissolved, with the hope of marrying the Duke of N., but this the hus-
band from spite opposed, and I have heard that a suit was actually in-
stituted in which the parties had changed sides. Pending these mat-
ters Mr. Macie died, and my friend succeeded to his estate. The Duke
of Northumberland did not marry the mother, nor, I believe, did he
notice Macie in his will, certainly not beyond a small legacy. Yet on
that event Macie had the bad taste (not to use a stronger expression) to
obtain the King’s authority for taking the name of Smithson (his puta-
tive father’s), be still continuing to usurpe and wrongfully hold, by his
own admission, the property of the Macie’s.

‘‘Mr. Smithson has lived chiefly abroad, with manners and habits
more foreign than English. He is living unm arried in 1826. * * *
Several ingenious papers in the Phil:-Transactions and other periodi- ~
cal works here and on the Continent under the names James Smith-
son and James Macie. D.G.”

‘“‘ In the college register it is usual, after incerting the Christian and
surnames of the person admitted, to add Filius Richardi (for instance):
Armigeri or Generosus, but not repeating the surname.

“In Mr. Macie’s case the addition is Filius Armigeri, omitting his
father’s name altogether. D. G.”

Note in bound copy of MS. pocket-book kept by Davies Gilbert.

“ MAY 26, 1786.
“On this day Mr. James Louis Macie (afterwards Smithson) was ere-
ated Master of Arts in the Convocation House. I remember his being
seated on the upper end of the bench, on the floor, on the proctor’s left
hand; that we walked back together, when Macie exchanged his cap for

a hat, and then walked with me round Christ Church meadows. What
is very curious his father’s name is omitted and he is merely stated to
be the son of an esquire.”

“For some account of Mr. James Smithson Macie see Gentleman’s
Magazine for March, 1830, p. 275.”

“‘ Extract translated from the college register: “1786, May 7, James
Louis (or Lewis) Macie, «et. 17, of London, son of an esquire, matricu-
lated of Pembroke College, Oxford.”

at the Royal Society.”

Letter from James Smithson to Davies Gilbert.

“PARIS, May 9th, Year 4 [1792].

“ DEAR Sirk: Your letter did not reach London till after I was come
out of town, and followed me here. I really take it exceedingly ill of
you to have forgot my crystals, and beg of you to make quick and
ample atonement for it. I do not now remember what particular ones
I requested you to procure me, but any you bring shall, king-like, be
graciously received, as a testimony of your good intentions. Well!
Things are going on! (a ira is growing the song of England, of Eu-
rope, as well as of France. Men of every rank are joining in the
chorus. Stupidity and guilt have had a long reign, and it begins, in-
deed, to be time for justice and common sense to have their turn. The
office which you have been lately named to will, I hope, afford you
means of promoting their cause. Every Englishman I converse with,
almost every Englishman I see or hear of, appears to be of the demo-
cratic party. Mr. Davis, high sheriff for Dorsetshire, left this town to-
day and takes with him, it seems, a quantity of tricolor ribbon to deck
his men with the French national cockades, and I do not think this ex-
ample unworthy of imitation by those whose principles lead them to
consider with indifference and contempt the frowns of the court party,
to whom, doubtless, the mixture of red, white, and blue is an object of
horror. I do not tell you news of this country, as the English papers
inform you pretty faithfully of the manner in which it goeson. You
have understood, I hope, that the church is now here quite unacknowl-
edged by the state, and is indeed allowed to exist only till they have
leisure to give it the final death-stroke. Mr. Louis Bourbon is still at
Paris, and the office of king is not yet abolished, but they daily feel the
inutility, or rather great inconvenience, of continuing it, and its dura-
tion will probably not be long. May other nations, at the time of their
reforms, be wise enough to cast off, at first, the contemptible incum-
brance. I consider a nation with a king as a man who takes a lion as

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

It is with regret that I announce the resignation of Hon. Peter Parker,
on April 17, 1884, of the office of member of the Board of Regents and of
the Executive Committee. Dr. Parker has performed these functions
for many years, and always with zeal and fidelity. His advancing years
and the great amount of labor required from the Executive Committee
in the way of auditing the accounts of the Institution, &¢., made him
firm in insisting upon the acceptance of his resignation agafnst many
protests. His place was accordingly filled by Congress by the election
of Dr. James C. Welling, president of Columbian University of this city,
on May 13. Dr. Welling was requested by the remainder of the Execu-
tive Committee—General Sherman and Rev. Dr. Maclean—to take Dr.
Parker’s place on that committee.

The term of Rev. Dr. Noah Porter as Regent having expired, he was
re-elected by Congress on March 3 for another term of six years.

ACTING SECRETARY.

In view of the importance of having some one, notably an officer of
the Institution, to exercise the functions of Acting Secretary in the
event of the extended absence, disability, or death of the Secretary, a
law was passed January 24, 1879, giving to the Chancellor the power
to make such selection; and Mr. W. J. Rhees, the chief clerk, was ap-
pointed to fill the position. The Board at its last meeting found some
informality or uncertainty in the act of Congress, and the following
act, prepared by Hon. G. F. Edmunds, of the Senate, one of the Re-
gents, was passed, and approved on May 13, 1884:

An act to provide for the appointment of an Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution.
Public, No. 31, Forty-eighth Congress, first session.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the Chancellor of the Smith-

sonian Institution may, by an instrument in writing filed in the office
of the Secretary thereof, designate and appoint a suitable person to act
as Secretary of the Institution when there shall be a vacancy in said
_ office, and whenever the Secretary shall be unable from illness, absence,
or other cause to perform the duties of his office; and in such case the
person so appointed may perform all the duties imposed on the Secre-
tary by law until the vacancy shall be filled or such inability shall
cease. The said Chancellor may change such designation and appoint-
ment from time to time as the Institution may in his judgment require.

Approved May 13, 1884.

In accordance with this act the following action was taken by the
Chancellor:

By virtue of the authority conferred on me by the act of May 13,
1884, ‘‘to provide for the appointment of an Acting Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution,” I hereby designate and appoint Mr. William
J. Rhees to act as Secietary of the Institution when there shall be a
vacancy in that office, and whenever the Secretary shall be unable, from
illness, absence, or other cause, to perform the duties of his office.

M. Rh. WAITE,
Chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution.
LyME, Conn., July 2, 1884.

PORTRAITS OF THE REGENTS.

It has been the object of the Smithsonian Institution to make a col-
lection, as complete as possible, of the likenesses of all who have served
as its Regents. This object is comparatively easy of attainment in the
jmmediate present, but as the enterprise was not initiated until quite
recently, there is an undesirable number of blanks in the collection.
Crayon portraits, however, of Prof. Asa Gray, at present one of the
Regents, and of President Fillmore, and Vice-President George M.
Dallas, who were Chancellors of the Institution, all by Mr. Henry Ulke,
were added to the gallery during the year.

FINANCES.

As in previous years, the Secretary has much pleasure in announcing
the excellent condition of the finances; all indebtedness to the 1st of
January, 1885, having been paid, and leaving a balance in the Treasury
available for the operations of the coming year. In the report of the
Executive Committee will be found a statement of the receipts and
expenditures, with the balances, as also a list of appropriations made
by Congress. In the list of credits enumerated will be found the sum
of $900, appropriated by Congress for expenses of construction and
installation of the Henry statue over and above the original appro-
priation.

The permanent Smithson fund in the Treasury of the United States
is $703,000. The receipts during the year 1884, including the balance
unexpended on the Ist of January, were $68,994.20, and the expendi-
tures $43,613.36; leaving a balance of $25,380.84, available for the
operations of the Institution, in 1589.
8 . REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

BUILDINGS.

Smithsonian Building.—The appropriation of Congress, available on
January 1, for the reconstruction of the eastern range and wing was
insufficient to complete it, and an additional sum of $15,000 was granted
at the first session of the Forty-eighth Congress. This was expended
in fitting up the two upper stories of the building, which had been
necessarily left unfinished for lack of funds. This included the intro-
duction of iron furring and iron lathing for the ceilings immediately
under the roof—a measure very necessary for the comfort of the ocecu-
pants of the rooms below them. It was impossible, however, to find
the means for plastering, which yet remains to be done.

With the additional appropriation many of the rooms were fitted up
specially for their requirements, including a post-office, which is used
by nearly 200 persons—equal in the amount of mail distributed daily to
that of a village of considerable size.

In view of the difficulty of making the electric connections answer a
satisfactory purpose, it was thought best to make provision for intro-
ducing the pneumatic clock system whenever occasion allowed, and for
this purpose the air-tubes were inserted, to which the regulator-clock
and the dials in the several rooms can be fitted at any time. A similar
provision was made for the oral annunciator—an arrangement by which
communication can be established direct at a central station between
the pipes leading to any two rooms in the building, thus facilitating com-
munication and obviating the use of several telephones. A few tele-
phones have been introduced, more especially with reference to connec-
tion with the switchboard in the National Museum, and by which
communication is established with all parts of that building, as well as
with the city systems of exchange and those of the Departments.

By the courtesy of the Superintendent of the Observatory, and at but
slight expense, a control-clock was set up in the National Museum
building, as also in that of the Smithsonian Institution, these being reg-
ulated at noon each day by communication direct from the Observatory.
In this way the important desideratum of accurate time is obtained.

The rooms in the reconstructed portion of the building are now all
occupied for the general purposes of the Institution, notably the depart-
ments of administration, of international and miscellaneous exchanges,
of the reference library, of transportation, and of publication. Several
rooms are occupied by artists employed in connection with the work of
the Institution, or persons who are engaged in preparing special reports
upon collections and explorations made by them under the direction of
the Smithsonian Institution, the Fish Commission, and the United States
Signal Office. Three rooms have been fitted up as a special chemical
laboratory, in charge of Dr. Kidder, the chemist of the United States
Fish Commission ; and all work in the way of rating of thermometers,
barometers, and hydrometers is under his direction, as also that con-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

nected with chemical analyses of air, sea-water, &c. Much work has
already been done by him in this connection.

Two rooms are occupied by the United States Coast and Geodetic
Survey in making pendulum experiments.

Considerable changes have been made in the central portion of the
main building, consequent upon the retransfer of the temporary offices
to their permanent quarters in the eastern end. The large room on the
first floor has been givenup exclusively tothe collections of birds, shells.
and in small part to the fishes; and by the removal of the cases on the
south galleries exceptional facilities have been furnished to the curators
who have charge of these departments respectively.

During the year some experiments were made by the Brush Electric
Light Company in lighting Washington by means of powerful are lights
placed on top of lofty buildings, the points selected for this purpose
being the dome of the Capitol, the summit of the Smithsonian tower,
and the top of the Washington Monument. To increase the altitude of
the Smithsonian tower a pole was erected 50 feet high, the top of which
was, therefore, about 200 feet from the ground. At the request of the
» Institution, General Hazen, Chief Signal Officer, was kind enough to
lend a large vane, which has been erected, and which serves an admir-
able purpose in showing the direction of the wind from over a wide ex-
tent of the city.

National Museum Building.—This building continues to give entire
satisfaction as fully carrying out its objects. As might be expected,
the ordinary minor repairs have been required from time to time, but
nothing involving any considerable expeuse. Some of the wooden floors
have rotted in places, and may hereafter require renewal. At present,
however, the renewal of a few of the boards has answered the purpose.

Major Powell, of the United States Geological Survey, having secured,
by Congressional favor, the use of a large fire-proof building in this city,
his own offices and those of a considerable portion of his sctentific- aids
have been transferred from the National Museum building, permitting
a rearrangement in the latter, which has been greatly to the convenience
of the service. The rooms vacated in the northeastern pavilion were
reoccupied, however, by the chemical and physical departments of the
Geological Survey ; but the transfer of the latter from the southwestern
pavilion has enabled us to give much better accommodations to the
mineralogical, metallurgical, and lithological branches of the service.
The four courts which have been hitherto used merely as work-rooms or
foy storage have been cleared out and will soon be occupied by exhibits,
thus adding over 16,000 square feet to the available space for display.

Temporary shed in the grounds.—The immense amount of work required
to properly comply with the directions of Congress in connection with
the exhibitions at Cincinnati, Louisville, and New Orleans made it
necessary to take a portion of the appropriation to erect a temporary
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

building of 100 by 50 feet in the grounds. This, of course, will be re-
moved as soon as it can be dispensed with; but it has furnished an im-
portant aid in the general work of the Institution for the year.

Brick work-shop.—The vacating of several rooms by the transfer of
Major Powell’s photographic department to its new quarters on F street
has permitted a much more satisfactory arrangement to be made of the
taxidermical service, Mr. Henry Marshall, in charge of the mounting of
birds, having moved upstairs and left the lower floor to Mr. Joseph
Palmer, the superintendent of the division of modeling in plaster and
papier-maché. The building has also been used to unpack a large col-
lection of corals, which was made by Dr. Edward Palmer for exhibition
at New Orleans.

Armory Building.—This building has received some necessary repairs
to its roof and has been painted inside, so as greatly to increase the
neatness of its appearance. The two oval spaces referred to in the pre-
ceding report as having been left in the concreting of the yard have now
been converted into fish-ponds, in which carp and other fish are kept
pending their distribution by the United States Fish Commission.

An extension of the car-shed has also been built, under which four
ears of the Fish Commission can be accommodated.

As has already been stated, a side-track from the Baltimore and Po-
tomac depot runs into the grounds of the Armory and under the sheds,
and the whole establishment has been of very great service for loading
the exhibits prepared by the Smithsonian Institution, the Fish Commis-
sion, the Interior Department, the Treasury Department, &c., for the
three great expositions already referred to.

Additional Museum Building.—The need of an additional Museum
building was fully. detailed in the last report, the demand for it being
very much greater now than before, in view of the immense additions
made by the regular sources of supply. Very many objects of great
interest and requiring a large space for their accommodation have been
promised by exhibitors at New Orleans, and it is a serious problem to
know where these can even be stored, aside from the possibility of: prop-
_erly displaying them. The full details in regard to the necessity of this
building will be found in the report of 1883.

Building for the Alcoholic Collections.—The presence of alcoholic speci-
mens in large numbers, so important in a scientific point of view, greatly
endangers the safety of museum buildings and their contents, and most
of the establishments in Europe have lately taken the precaution to
construct separate buildings peculiarly adapted for the purpose. An
application was made at the last session of Congress for an appropria-
tion to put up a similar building in the grounds of the Institution, but
it was not acted upon favorably. This item has been renewed in the
estimates for the coming fiscal year.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 1l
MEETINGS OF .SCIENTIFIC BODIES.

The Board of Regents, at its meeting in January, 1881, formally tend-
ered the use of the lecture-room and other accommodations in the Na-
- tional Museum to the National Academy of Sciences, and authorized
the executive committee to grant a similar courtesy to other national
organizations having the advancement of science as their object. Un-
der this arrangement the National Academy met on Tuesday, April 15,
and continued in session until Friday, April 18.

In addition to the facilities afforded to the National Academy of
Sciences, mentioned above, it was thought quite in accordance with its
relationships to the Smithsonian, especially as established since the res-
olution of the Board, above referred to, to give to the Academy the
use of one of the new rooms in the extension of the Smithsonian build-
ing for its archives, library, and other property. This has accordingly
been done, and two rooms have been assigned for the purpose. It has
proved to be a very great convenience to the officers of the Academy,
especially during its meetings in the adjacent National Museum building.

Among the most interesting meetings of 1884 in the National Museum,
of the national scientific societies, was that of the American Fish Cultu-
ral Association, which took place in May, it being the first convocation
it has ever held in the city of Washington. In addition to the association
itself, invitations were extended to the fish commissioners of nineteen
States, and a large attendance was the result. Many papers were pre-
sented, but the chief point of attraction was the opening to the public
of the fisheries section of the Museum, as arranged after the return of
a part of the collection from the International Fisheries Exhibition in
London. The Brush-Swan Company kindly put in sufficient plant to
illuminate the entire building, especially the fisheries section, and a
very large attendance was present on the occasion. The annual address
was delivered by Hon. Theodore Lyman, who was followed by Hon. 8S.
S. Cox and others. The meeting was varied by an excursion on the
steamer Fish Hawk to the shad-hatching grounds near Fort Washing-
ton, where the processes of treating the fish were duly exhibited.

LECTURES.

The success of the course of lectures delivered in 1883, in the lecture-
room of the National Museum, under the auspices of the Anthropolog-
ical and Biological Societies, induced those bodies to establish a second
course for 1884, and, as before, these were attended by large audiences.

The list of these lectures will be given under the head of National
Museum.

Toner Lectures.—It is known to the Board that an endowment was
made by Dr. John M. Toner, of Washington, of a fund, the interest of
which was to be appropriated in giving a series of lectures on some
subject pertaining to medicine, surgery, or public health; and, by an
12 . REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

arrangement made with my predecessor, these lectures are published
at the expense of the Smithsonian Institution, as a portion of the series
of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, and in that form distributed
to public libraries and to institutions having a common object with the

As it has been found quite impossible to supply gratuitously the large ~
demand from medical men and others for these lectures (in addition to
the liberal grant to the leading public libraries and other institutions
in this and foreign countries), the uniform price of 25 cents has been
fixed for each, by which probably their more equitable distribution will
be secured.

The rooms of the National Museum were occupied on March 19 for
the delivery of the ninth lecture of the foregoing series by Dr. Charles
K. Mills, of Philadelphia. A large and attentive audience was present
during the delivery, and the paper will be printed as soon as the re-
vision is received from the author.

ROUTINE WORK IN THE INSTITUTION.

The most important event of the year to be mentioned in this con-
nection is the occupation of the new rooms in the eastern range and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

wing of the Smithsonian building after their reconstruction, a work
which occupied about a year from its commencement in the spring of
1883.

For many years past the small number of rooms available for the ad-
ministrative offices of the Institution has greatly impeded its business
and interfered with the effectiveness of the work of all the employés.
_ The stock of publications was widely scattered in different parts of the
Smithsonian building, and the rooms were overcrowded with clerks and
assistants. The records were necessarily kept in places more or less
inconvenient of access, with a constant fear of their destruction and
that of other property of the Institution by fire in a building so con-
structed that should a fire break out it would be almost impossible to
prevent the combustion of the entire edifice. Thanks to the liberality
of Congress in furnishing the necessary means, these inconveniences
and dangers are all things of the past; the offices have been re-ar-
ranged, everything brought together in convenient approximation, and
every necessary provision made for the comfort of the employés and
the efficiency of their work.

The Secretary transferred his office from his temporary quarters in
the National Museum building early in May, and a few days after the
chief clerk, corresponding clerk, and others moved from their impro-
vised rooms in the lower hall of the Institution. By the end of the year
the work was finished and everything in good running order.

The personnel of the Institution continues to be the same as hereto-
fore, apart from the addition of one or two subordinate employés re
quired to meet the increase of work.

CORRESPONDENCE.

This continues to increase in about the usual ratio, and represents a
very large part of the operations of the Institution. The range of sub-
jects presented for consideration covers every branch of speculation
and of human knowledge; and there are very few subjects upon which
the advice and opinion of the Institution are not asked. In accordance
with its uniform rule, all communications are treated with respect; and
where the information asked for cannot be furnished directly, the let-
ter is referred to some expert.

EXPLORATIONS.

From the very beginning of its work a large part of the attention of
the Institution has been directed towards increasing our knowledge of
the physical condition and natural history of various parts of the globe,
especially on the continent of America, and almost every report con-
tains some account of work accomplished in this direction. No single
agency has done as much as the Smithsonian Institution in developing
a knowledge of the region ir question, whether as the result of observa-
pe REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tions prosevutcd entirely or partly at its own expense, or made at its
suggestion by Government expeditions and private parties. An exten-
sive correspondence and more or less intimate association with men of
science resident in the different localities has also been utilized to sug-
gest points of inquiry and invite the communication of information.

The year 1884 has been no exception to the statement just made. In-
deed, it is doubtful whether any of its predecessors has exceeded it in
the amount of results obtained. This is, of course, largely due, as in
many previous years, to the co-operation of the United States Signal
Service, under General Hazen; the United States Geological Survey
and the Bureau of Ethnology, under Major Powell; and the United
States Fish Commission.

As heretofore, I shall give in geographical sequence a short account
of the various expeditions and of their results, leaving the full account
of the collections themselves to be reported upon by Mr. Goode, the
Assistant Director of the NationaFMuseum.

Greenland.—The most interesting chapter of the exploration of Green-
land is that connected with the history of the Greely Relief Expedition,
which was fitted up by provision of Congress for the purpose of rescuing
Lieutenant Greely and his fellow members of the Signal Service from
their imprisonment in the Polar Seas. After the two futile attempts,
made in 1882 and 1883, to communicate with the International Arctie
station at Lady Franklin Bay, and to relieve Lieutenant Greely and his
command, a new expedition was organized by a special act of Congress,
at ap early date in 1884, under the direction of the Secretary of the Navy,
and Secretary of War. Subsequently the Dundee whaler ‘‘ Thetis” and
the ‘* Bear” of the Newfoundland sealing fleet, two stout steamers of 600
and 609 tons burden, were purchased by the Government, and taken to
the Brooklyn navy-yard to be overhauled and refitted. The English
Government generously presented the steamer “ Alert,” one of the ves-
sels of the late Arctic expedition under Captain George Nares, to be
used in the search, and the collier ‘‘ Loch Garry” was chartered to act
as tender. The expedition was placed under the command of Comman-
der W.S,. Schley, U.S. N., who selected the “Thetis” as flag-ship, and
under whose superintendence the squadron was thoroughly fitted out.

On April 23 the “Bear” left the United States bound for St. John’s,
Newfoundland, followed by the “Thetis” on May 1, and by the “Alert”
on the 10th of the same month. The “Thetis” arrived at Disco
on May 22, accompanied by the ‘Loch Garry,” where she learned
that the “Bear,” having reached that port on the 15th, had left the
day previous, to continue to Upernavik. Convoying the “ Loch Garry,”
the flag-ship sailed again from Disco on the 24th, touching five days
later at Upernavik, where she met her consort. In the afternoon all
the whalers which had gathered there left with the “Thetis” and
“ Bear,” the tender remaining behind to await the convoy of the “ Alert”

and a more favorable time for crossing Melville Bay, which was full
of heavy ice. The time between June 6th and 11th was spent at the
Duck Islands, looking in vain for an opening in the pack. Taking
advantage of every narrow lead the vessels fought their way through
the ice, now resorting to ramming and torpedoes to force a passage,
then tying up to the lee of a berg or to a heavy floe. By dint of labor
they finally came in sight of Gape York, but it was impossible to get
into open water before the 18th. Accompanied by two of the whalers
they then steamed on. The ‘ Bear” was signaled to push ahead and
send a party on shore to communicate with the natives. Nothing had
been heard here of Greely. Every place was searched where records
or people were likely to be found. The ‘ Bear” went to the Cary
Islands, the “Thetis” to Conical Rock, Wolstenholme and Saunders
Island, to Cape Parry, and finally to Littleton Island, where a cache was
found, but no tidings of the party. Now the impression became gen-
eral that the vessels would have to proceed to Lady Franklin Bay. Let-
ters were got ready to be sent home by the “ Alert,” when she should
return in the autumn, and on the 22d, 720 rations were cached. When
the ‘‘ Bear” arrived at noon it was decided to land 3,000 rations more
at Payer Harbor, and both vessels stood across through open water to
Cape Sabine, where Greely and the survivors of his command were found
in a starving condition. On July 17, the vessels, with the exception of
the “ Alert,” were at anchor again at St. John’s, Newfoundland.

Considering that the whole energy of the squadron had to be devo-
ted to the rescue of the Lady Franklin Bay party, the natural history
collections, made by the officers on various occasions, are richer than
might have been expected; the numerous photographs of the country,
of the natives, and the ice, in its various shapes and formations, will be
of lasting value.

The physical observations during the course of the expedition were
made part of the regular routine of the vessels. The natural history
work, however, was prosecuted by the naval ensigns who had been
sent by the Navy Department to the Smithsonian Institution specially
for the purpose of being trained for such duty. Among these were
Messrs. C. A. Harlow, A. A. Ackerman, and C.S. McClain. These gen-
tlemen had all been well trained at the Institution in the methods of
instantaneous photography, in taxidermy, and in the collecting of min-
erals and fossils; and although the time occupied by the expedition—
thanks to the energy of its commander, Captain Schley, and his associ-
ates—was very much less than had been anticipated, very interesting
and desirable collections were made by the gentlemen mentioned.

The landings were made, for the most part, at Disco, Upernavik,
Duck Island, Conical Rock, Camp Clay, &c., and the gatherings con-
sisted of rock specimens, minerals, fossils, numerous birds, and an ac-
ceptable collection of fishes and marine invertebrates in alcohol. The
photographic plates have not yet been developed, but will no doubt
16 “REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

show much of very great interest. These gentlemen all make acknowl-
edgment of the assistance given them in their work by the orders and
hearty good feeling of Captain Schley and the other officers in com-
mand.

The Greely Relief Expedition fully and entirely carried out its mis-
sion of restor:ng the survivors of the Greely party to their friends in
the United States. By far the greater part, however, of the apparatus
and collections made in the several years of absence was left behind at
Fort Conger, and may never be recovered. A few specimens were
brought home by Lieutenant Greely, but have not been received at the
National Museum.

Labrador.—The reports of 1882 and 1883 give full details of the work
prosecuted by Mr. L. M. Turner at Fort Chimo, Ungava Bay, in North-
ern Labrador, and full credit given to the Chief Signal Officer for his
encouragement to Mr. Turner to make collections of specimens in the
intervals of his duties of recording the meteorological and other physi-
cal phenomena of the region. Mr. Turner’s two years of detail expiring
in 1884, he returned to Washington and is now engaged in preparing his
report. In order to make the report complete, I subjoin a brief extract
prepared by him of his work during the two years:

‘Under letter of instructions of date of May 27,1882, from the Chief
Signal Office, United States Army, I departed from Washington June
1, 1832, for Montreal, where I remained until June 7th, and joined the
Hudson Bay Company’s schooner ‘Tropic’ at Quebec, and left there
June 8th for Rigolet, Labrador, where we arrived June 28th. At this
place Lremained until July 8th, and proceeded on the company’s steamer
‘Labrador’ for Davis’ Inlet, Labrador, where we arrived July 16th,
and remained fourdays. At these two stations I collected a great num-
ber of fishes, birds, plants, and insects. On the 21st of July we started
for Nakvak, Labrador, but were prevented by bad weather from enter-
ing that fiord, and continued around Cape Chidley, at the entrance of
Hudson Strait. After entering we immediately encountered heavy ice,
and were detained eleven days in Ungava Bay. We went on shore for
part of one day (July 31st) at the mouth of George’s River emptying
into that bay. On the 6th of August we ascended the Koksoak or
South River, and anchored at Fort Chimo, Ungava district of the Hud-
son Bay Company, where I was to establish a meteorological observa-
tion station for the Signal Service. The meteorological observations
were to be five in number daily at the following times: 7.35 A. M.; 11.35
A. M.; 3.35 P.M.; 7.35 P.M., and 11.35 Pp. M. A dwelling not being ready
for occupation, I was necessitated to await the completion of a building
intended for a blacksmith shop, which when finished was used by me
as dwelling and office until my final departure from Fort Chimo. Dur-
ing my stay at Fort Chimo I had an opportunity to ascend the Koksoak
River to the ‘Forks’ (junction of the North or Larch River with the
Koksoak and about 105 miles from the mouth of the latter river). Also
to the Falls, some 30 miles above the ‘Forks.’ These ‘ Falls’ were
visited for the purpose of photographing them. I again visited the
‘Forks’ for the purpose of obtaining winter resident birds, and while
on this trip I ascended the Larch or North River, and discovered a
small river flowing from the southwest into it. On this river, some 14
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

miles from its mouth, is a small falls of some 25 feet perpendicular,
affording one of the most picturesque scenes I ever viewed. On an-
other occasion I visited Whale River, to the east of the Koksoak about
50 miles, and on this trip passed the mouth of ‘False’ River, so named
because it is nothing but a cul de sac of about 40 miles length and run-
ning nearly parallel with the Koksoak. The tides exert such influence
on these rivers that navigation is extremely dangerous. The rise and
fall of the tides at the mouth of the Koksoak were determined by me
to be sixty-two feet and three inches.

“On the 4th of September, 1854, I left Fort Chimo, Ungava, on the
Hudson Pay Company’s steamer ‘ Labrador,’ to return to civilization.
We stopped for ten days at George’s River, Ungava district, to re-es-
tablish a trading station there for the Hudson’s Bay Company, leaving
there on the 14th for Nakvak, Labrador, where we arrived on the 16th,
and lett next day for Davis Inlet, where we arrived on the 19th and re-
mained until the 23d. We then started for Rigolet, Labrador, and ar-
rived there on the 25th, and left next day on the Newfoundland mail
steamer ‘ Hercules’ for Battle Harbor, Labrador, where we arrived
October 1, leaving next day for St. John’s, Newfoundland, on the
mail steamer ‘Plover,’ where we arrived October 6. While on these
two mail steamers we stopped at over one hundred fishing stations
along the Labrador and Newfoundland coast to call for and deliver
mail. On the 16th I left St. John’s for Halifax, where I arrived on the
18th, and took railway for Montreal, and arrived there on the 21st, and
left next day for Washington, where I arrived on the 23d. My leisure
time was employed at every locality visited, in collecting specimens of
natural history. The results are given approximately as below in round
numbers:

“ Of birds, 1,800 specimens ; eggs, 1,800 specimens ; fishes, 1,000 speci-
mens; mammals, 200 specimens; ethnological, 600 articles; plants, a
great number; insects, over 200,000; geological specimens, a great
variety ; Eskimo linguistics, over 500 pages of manuscript, embracing
thousands of words and over 800 sentences, which were obtained dur-
ing the winter nights and at other times when outdoor work could not
be done.

‘¢'To this should be added twenty-three months of continuous meteoro-
logical observations, taken and recorded at Fort Chimo, Ungava, which
have been already turned over to the Chief Signal Officer, United States
Army.

‘*To enable me to successfully prosecute these labors, I was by the
characteristic liberality of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
abundantly supplied with all necessary articles for procuring, preserv-
ing, and transmitting the results.”

Reference was made in a preceding report tothe work accomplished
by Dr. C. Hart Merriam in the investigation of the natural history of
the seals of the coast of Labrador. The arrangements made by Dr.
Merriam during his abode in Newfoundland and Labrador have fur-
nished him additional material during the present year, the results of
which he has kindly shared with the National Museum in the way of
skins and skeletons of several species of seals.

Arctie Coast.—Although we are unable to record quite so large ac-
quisitions from the Arctic coast as were obtained in the year 1882 from
S. Mis. 33——2
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

the Point Barrow Expedition of the Signal Service Bureau, under coiti-
mand of Lieutenant Ray, yet some interesting contributions have been
received. Captain Healy and officers of the revenue steamer Corwin
have supplied collections from Hotham Inlet and other points along
the coast, including numerous minerals, birds, fish, invertebrates, &ce.

The following summary of Captain Healy’s work has been furnished
through the Secretary of the Treasury, Hon. Hugh McCulloch:

“Captain Healy has, during the past season, visited with his com-
mand the new volcano on Bogoslov Island, of the Aleutian chain, in
longitude 168° W., which, after some years of quiet, recently became
active. He caused a survey of the island to be made by two of his
officers, who submitted a very interesting and valuable report, contain-
ing a detailed description of the large accession to the island thrown
up by the recent volcanic action, and through the aid of another officer
of the vessel obtained some excellent photographs of the voleano in its
various aspects. Later‘in the season Captain Healy sent a boat expedi-
tion up the Kowak River, which debouches through its delta into Ho-
tham Inlet, Kotzebue Sound. Lieutenant Cantwell, who conducted this
expedition, ascended the Kowak River a distance of 379 miles. He
submitted a report, showing a careful survey of the river for the dis-
tance named, and a very interesting discovery in a large deposit of
jade (nephrite) situated in a mountain (named in the native language
Ashoganok, meaning smooth stone,) lying a few miles north of the river.
Also a description of the flora and fauna of the river’s banks, accom-
panied with specimens. Assistant Engineer McLenegan, who accom-
panied him, submitted also a valuable list of birds of Northern Alaska
with descriptions and specimens. Lieutenant Cantwell made a fur-
ther detailed survey of Selaivrk Lake, tributary to the same inlet, ac-
companied with a well-executed chart of the region. This expedition
brings back the report that the precious metals are found in large
quantities among the high mountains which form the water-shed for the
Kowak, Kuryukuk, and perhaps Colville Rivers.”

Lieut. George M. Stoney, U.S. N., of the schooner ‘ Ounalaska,” who
had visited Arctic America and explored Hotham Inlet and the rivers
entering into it, obtained an interesting series of rocks from the volcano
in Behring’s Sea. The collections made byhim have not, however, yet
come to hand.

Both Captain Healy and Lieutenant Stoney have furnished specimens
of the crude jade, or jade-like material so much used by the natives of
Arctic America for ornaments and weapons.

The Pacific Steam Whaling Company’established during the year a
depot at Cape Lisburne, with Mr. D. Woolfe in command, for the pur-
pose of mining coal for the use of the whalers, and specimens of this
coal and of the associated fossils have been furnished by Mr. Woolfe.
Miscellaneous collections of the natural history of the region are ex-
pected from that gentleman during the year 1885.

The North Pacific_—Reference was made in a previous report to the
very important work accomplished by Dr. L. Stejneger, under the direc-
tion of the Signal Office and the Smithsonian Institution, in Kamtschatka
and the adjacent group of the Commander Islands. Through the cour-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

tesy of Governor Grebnitski, in command of these islands, a number of
additional collections were received.

Dr. Stejneger also received from Captain Hunter some skins and
skeletons of the mountain sheep of Kamtschatka, filling an important
desideratum.

Alaska.—As in previous years, the additions to our knowledge of the
natural history and ethnology of Alaska have been very considerable,
owing to the continuation of explorations of the different parts of that
extensive Territory. The station of the Signal Service at Nushagak, on
Bristol Bay, which was so well worked up by Mr. C. L. McKay, was
subseqnently re-established after his death by drowning, by Mr. J. W.
Johnson, from whom a collection of birds was lately received, which
was specially noteworthy as containing specimens of the Alaska wil-
low wren and of the yellow wagtail, representing a locality many hun-
dreds of miles further south than St. Michael’s, the place of previous
record.

Lieut. T. Dix Bolles, on board the U.S. 5S. “Adams,” during its pe-
riod of service at Sitka, used all opportunities in his power to enrich
the National Museum by his contributions, and became so much inter-
ested in his work that he sought and obtained a transfer, through the
favor of the Navy Department, to the steamer “ Pinta,” which replaced °
the “Adams” during the past summer. At latest advices he was still
engaged in his scientific work.

Mr. John J. McLean, of the Signal Service, stationed at Sitka, has
secured many ethnological objects of great rarity.

Mr. W. J. Fischer, who is stationed by the Coast Survey at Kodiak,
has used many opportunities both there and in the adjacent regions to
continue his important work ; this, including much information in re-
gard to the manners and characteristics of the native tribes.

From the Rev. J. Loomis Gould a collection of Indian carvings and
other articles of ethnology were obtained, representing some quite new
forms of aboriginal construction.

British Columbia and Washington Territory.—For the purpose of in-
creasing material for the needs of the National Museum and its repre-
sentation at the New Orleans Exposition, the services of Mr. James
G. Swan, of Port Townsend, were secured to visit various parts of
Alaska and British Columbia. His collections, as received so far, have
been, as usual, very interesting and important. During a visit to Vic-
toria in the interest of this service, he was invited to deliver a lecture
before the legislature upon his observations made in 1883 in Queen
Charlotte Islands, and having obtained permission from the Institution
for the purpose, he complied with the request.

The specialties of Mr. Swan’s collection consist of very full illustra-
tions of the whaling apparatus and outfit, including boats, Wc., used
by the Haidah Indians.
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

A valuable monograph by Mr. Swan, upon the ethnology of the Hai-
dah Indians, which had been contributed to the Treasury Department,
was transmitted by its Secretary for publication in the reports of the
Bureau of Ethnology.

Oregon and California.—From Oregon the most noteworthy collec-
tions are those furnished by Capt. Charles Bendire, at Fort Klamath,
to whose important contributions and services to the Fish Commission
full detailed reference is made in another part of the report.

The returns from California consist in large part of numerous collec-
tions of shells, minerals, fossils, and archeological objects from Mr. R.
E. C. Stearns, recently appointed as Curator of Conchology in the Na- ~
tional Museum. In transferring his effects from San Francisco to Wash-
ington he brought with him a very large series of specimens, of which
he has made a present to the National Museum.

Other specimens are birds from Mr. L. Belding, and fossils from Mr.
C. BR. Orcutt.

- Mr. Charles H. Townsend, connected with the fishery establishment
at Baird, Shasta County, California, has made and supplied the most
extensive series of collections of mammals ever received from the State
of California, all in most admirable preservation and specially adapted
for mounting. The collection also embraces numerous skins, skele-
tons, and skulls of the various sea lions and seals from the Farralone
Islands, and an additional collection of sea elephants from South Cali-
fornia is now on its way. In addition to this there are a large number
of skins of birds, fossils, and other objects of interest.

Arizona and New Mexico.—These Territories have been particularly
well represented during the year; the former by the large number of
skins of mammals, birds, and other objects of interest furnished by Mr.
E. W. Nelson; the latter by an enormous collection of modern Indian
pottery and other articles, which, when packed, represented a bulk of
many thousand cubic feet. These collections made under the auspices
of the Bureau of Ethnology, and others obtained by Mr. James Steven-
son under similar direction, may be considered as exhausting all possi-
ble demand for such articles from the region in question, and, in fact,
represent a series that can never be duplicated. The articles obtained
represent for the most part nearly all those that have been used by the
Indians for many years. All others now procurable are of more modern
make, and in large part fabricated to meet the demands of travellers
along the routes of the new lines of railways, and being made espe-
cially in great haste for sale, are very inferior both in material and dec-
oration.

Some contributions to the fauna of New Mexico were supplied by
Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, of the Army, from his station at Fort Wingate.

Mr. BE. W. Nelson has furnished the following account of his explora-
tions and collections in Arizona during 1884:
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. oA

“ When I reached Tucson in January, 1884, it was midwinter, but the
only evidence of the fact there, lay in the leafless vegetation and the
frosty nights. Thin ice formed quite frequently on the borders of stag-
nant pools. The days were warm and pleasant, as a rule, much like the
‘ Indian-summer’ days of autumn in the eastern States.

“Prairie dogs and other mammals, that hibernate during winter in
more northern latitudes, are found full of activity at all seasons in this
portion of Arizona. :

““Tueson is situated on a large basin-like plain with groups of mount-
ains on every side, from 10 to 30 or 40 miles distant. It is also located
near the eastern border of the region covered by the giant cactus, with
several species of birds having their range within about the same
limits.

‘‘ Various other species of cactus abound, and, with the mesquite
woods and the cottonwoods and elder trees along the bottoms near the
streams, form the most conspicuous part of the vegetation. The gen.
eral aspect of the country surrounding Tucson is very desert-like, al-
though covered with scrubby and thorny bushes, yet it is a favorite
resort for birds, and is probably the richest field for the ornithologist
north of the Mexican border.

“During the four months following my arrival at Tucson, my attention
was given to securing a series of the birds found there, with gratifying
success. Perhaps the most notable of the captures consisted of a fine
series of the resident race of song sparrow, by the aid of which Mr.
Henshaw was enabled to decide that the song sparrow of Southern Ari-
zona is a resident. form peculiar to that region, and to which properly
appertains the name of Melospiza fasciata fallax ; while the song spar-
row of the Rocky Mountain region in general, which has heretofore
been known as fallax, was in reality an undescribed form to which Mr.
Henshaw has given the name of Melosptza fasciata montana.

‘A series of the rare Harporhynchus bendirei was also taken, inelud-
ing the young in first plumage.

“It having been discovered that the deserted holes of Colaptes chry-
soides and Centurus uropygialis in the trunks of the giant cactus were
resorted to by the little-known Whitney’s owl (Microthene Whitney?)
and the southern screech ow! (Scops trichopsis), a number of these birds
were captured by cutting down the cactus stems and taking the birds
from their holes.

‘Later in the season, during the last of May, a portable ladder some
eighteen feet long was used to good purpose in securing the birds and
their eggs. The giant cactus is frequently from thirty to forty feet high
in that vicinity, and the old woodpecker holes are placed so high that
one had very often to stand on the extreme upper end of the ladder with
one arm embracing the thorny cactus and the other hand employed in
cutting out the entrance of the hole to admit the hand. This style of
work is very successful, and, although two men are required to do it,
one can count upon finding an ow! in about every fourth or fifth hole
examined in a good locality. The same proportion holds good when
hunting eggs in the nesting season. The vicinity of streams is the most
productive field. Toward the end of May the heat became very oppress-
ive, and early in June I made camp on the eastern slope of the Santa
Rita Mountains, about sixty miles southeast of Tucson. My camp was
in the live-oak belt at about 5,000 feet above the sea-level. Here I
found a much cooler’ temperature and a number of birds not seen
before. The breeding season was nearly over, though | was fortunate
enough to secure a fine nest and set of eggs of the black-throated gray

warbler (Dendreca nigrescens). Fine series of the Arizona jay (Cya-
nocitta sordida), the Strickland’s woodpecker (Picus stricklandi), Law-
rence’s flycatcher (Myiarchus lawrencet), and of other species of greater
or less rarity were secured here.

‘The Scott’s oriole (Icterus parisorum) was found rather common but
extremely shy there, and a number of skins were taken. Above the
oak belt on this small group of mountains is a sparsely timbered belt
of pines reaching to the summit, at about 10,000 feet altitude. The
deer, bears, and peccaries, or ‘musk-hogs,’ as they are called locally,
were once very numerous in these mountains, but the occupation of
every permanent spring or creek by ranchmen, and the presence of
prospectors at all seasons, has nearly driven the game from these hills.

‘The vicinity of my camp, near Gardiner’s ranch, is probably the
very best location for a collector that these mountains afford and is a
rich field for the ornithologist. From this camp, in company with two
friends, an excursion was made toward the Mexican border into a low
bottom. This bottom is heavily wooded with cottonwoods and other
trees and is a notoriously malarial region. It is full of birds, but who-
ever ventures there to do any extended work must be ague-proof. In
this bottom the blue grosbeak was very common, as many as fifteen or
twenty being seen on some days. At the head of this valley, in the
open grassy flats, the Arizona sparrow (Peuccea arizona) was very abund-—
ant, and its sweet song was heard from morning till night.

“The middle of July I broke camp and moved about fwenty-five miles
southeast to Camp Huachuea, at the base of the Huachuca Mountains.
Very little was done here, as the mountains and their faunas were very
sinilar, and nothing, not taken before, was seen. Both the Santa Rita
and Huachuca Mountains are poorly watered ; and although special at-
tention was not given to hunting for ruins or other evidences of ancient
occupation by Indians, yet nothing of the kind having been found in my
tramps after birds would indicate a paucity of such remains; nor could
the prospectors familiar with these mountains name any such ruins.
In August I returned to Tueson for a few days and made a flying visit
to the Papago Indian Reservation, nine miles south of town, at the old
mission of San Xavier. ThereI secured samples of their pottery and
other of their manufactures, such as the few natives present could be
induced to part with. These natives make the large porous water-jars
with which every house is supplied in Southern Arizona. The women
mix the clay with horse-dung and then mold it up by hand into the
tall, gracefully-shaped jars, smoothing 1t on the surface with a small
wooden trowel. The pot is then baked in a hot fire, and the parti-
cles of dung being burned out, the requisite porosity is Obtained.
When filled with water the fluid oozes slowly through the sides and
bottom of the jar, and if kept in a shaded spot the rapid evaporation
from the surface keeps the water inside cool and palatable in the hot-
test weather. This jar is almost a necessity in every household in the
hot southern region where ice is almost unknown. ‘The Papagoes of
San Xavier derive a considerable income from the sale of these jars.
The women hawk them about the streets of Tucson and sell them for
twenty-five cents each. This is certainly not an exorbitant price for a
jar that will hold from five to ten gallons, and which the seller has packed
nine miles, upon her back, into town.

“The intensely hot weather caused me to leave Tucson after a very
short stay there, and the 20th of August found me located at Springer-
ville, at the eastern base of the White Mountains, and at an altitude of
about 6,500 feet. The change from the arid, sun-baked plains of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

southern part of the Territory to the green hills and magnificent pine
forests of this vicinity was a marked and welcome one. The tempera-
ture here at that time was also cool and very pleasant. I*or several
weeks after my arrival here my health was unusually poor, owing to the
debilitating effect of the heat experienced earlier in the season, but
recovering from this, I passed the remainder of the fall in making hunt-
ing excursions in various directions from Springerville as a center, for
the purpose of securing a series of deer and antelope skins for the Na-
tional Museum.

“Although the mountains about here have been noted for the abun-
dance of large game in them during past years, yet all kinds of large
game were remarkably scarce during the past season. Such being the
case, it required much longer hunting and more work to secure the de-
sired game than had been anticipated.

‘“‘ Bear were not to be found at all, and elk were so scarce that only a
single fresh track was seen during several weeks in the woods. A\l-
though the cattlemen have invaded this district in force, yet they have
only touched the pine country at widely separated places, and Iam un-
able to account for the scarcity of large game.

“The mountains of this range are well watered by creeks and springs,
and from 6,500 feet altitude up to timber line they are covered with a
fine growth of pines, with aspens, and other trees common to high alti-
tudes in this region, intermingled on the higher ridges. There is
scarcely any undergrowth but a dense mat of grass and flowers in these
forests, and beautiful mountain parks are found at frequent intervals.
These parks vary in size from the tiny glades a few yards across to
broad savannas miles in extent, and the country would appear to be a
sportsman’s paradise were not the game unaccountably absent.

‘While at Springerville some time was devoted to examining va-
rious old ruins in the vicinity, along the valley of the Little Colorado
River. The sites of old stone-walled houses, frequently showing the
outlines of several rooms, are common, but only fragments of broken
pottery, with an occasional mortar, are found lying about them. Two
rooms were cleaned out in one ruin, but the results were discouragingly
meager, as only a bone awl, a hammer-stone, and a shell ornament re-
warded two days’ hard work.

‘‘Along the base of the lava bluffs bordering the valley occur masses
of huge, angular blocks of lava, lying as they fell from the cliff in
rough masses, and among which are large crevices, frequently leading
into irregular chambers and sheltered nooks among the rocks. In these
were found much broken pottery, and by careful search nearly all the
fragments of several pots were secured. Some old bows, arrows, and
other sticks, with the paint still bright upon them, were found in dry
spots.

“An old cave in the sandstone on the river, about 15 miles below
Springerville, yielded an old pot, some reeds prepared for arrows, a war
club, and some spear and arrow-tips. This cave had a great mass of
bows and arrows stored in it, when found by the Mexicans some years
ago; but the finders fired the pile, and nearly everything was reduced
to ashes. Another cave, located about thirty-five miles west of Spring-
erville, is a long, forked passage in the lava rock at the far end of which
the discoverers secured a fine lot of pottery a couple of years ago. At
the time of my visit nothing remained except traces of a fire where the
pottery had been found. The bottom of the cave is covered with a layer
of fine clay, such as the pottery was made from.
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

“From the boy who found the cave I secured a few pot-covers and
other specimens, which he took from the cave after his first find.

‘¢ The season’s work has resulted in a collection of over fifty skins and
skulls of mammals, eighteen of which are of deer and antelope; over
one thousand bird skins, and eighty birds’ eggs; about one hundred
and fifty ethnological specimens, and some alcoholic specimens of fishes
and mammals.”

Eastern Portion of the United States—Very large numbers of collec-
tions from the eastern portion of the United States have also been re-
ceived, but as having less relation to additions to our knowledge of the
natural history and ethnology of the region, they are less noteworthy in
the present portion of the report. Ishould, however, especially mention
the exploration of the fresh-water fish fauna of the Mississippi Valley
made by Professors Jordan and Gilbert in behalf of the New Orleans
International Exposition. As aspecially desirable presentation on that
occasion, it was determined to show as fully as possible the fishery
resources of the region at the outlet of which New Orleans is situated,
and to furnish, if possible, every kind of fish known to inhabit the
waters of the great river. Several months were occupied in this serv-
ice, and many hundreds of species obtained and prepared for exhibi-
tion. With a somewhat similar object Dr. Palmer was detailed for
service in Florida with special reference to securing collections of the
corals of the Florida Keys and the Tortugas. Henry Hemphill also
assisted in making collections of the invertebrates of Florida.

The display made under the auspices of the National Museum at
New Orleans of the economical and attractive natural history of the
Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi Valley were in great part made
especially for the occasion, and will constitute a noteworthy feature in
the history of American science.

As usual, the collections made under the auspices of the United
States Fish Commission along the eastern coast of the United States
have been noteworthy in value and extent, resulting from the continual
research at the station at Wood’s Holl, and especially from the labors
of the Fish Commission steamer ‘‘Albatross” in the deep waters off the
coast. Here, as in previous years, the occasion has been taken to secure
large numbers of duplicate specimens for distribution, as educational
material, to colleges and academies.

A subsidiary research of the Fish Commission in this connection was
accomplished by sending Dr. T. H. Bean to Long Island to explore the
adjacent waters, especially those of the Great South Bay, and this re-
sulted in making some discoveries of scientific interest as well as of
practical importance.

The West Indies—Many important contributions to our knowledge of
these regions have been made during the year, the most noteworthy
being the gatherings in the Caribbean Sea and the adjacent islands,
made by the Fish Commission steamer ‘“‘ Albatross,” which was detailed
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

to the service of the Navy Department at its request. The vessel was
also engaged in making soundings between the south side of the West
Indies and the north coast of South America, resulting in determin-
ing the character of the sea bottom with great precision and establish-
ing the existence of a number of unexpected reefs and shoals of great
depths, which have been indicated in a model of the bottom of the Ca-
ribbean, made by direction of Captain Bartlett, of the Hydrographic
Office of the Navy. General collections were made of the land fauna
as well as of the marine, resulting in the addition of a very great num-
ber of species to the National Museum, of which a noted proportion are
of scientific interest. Among these may be mentioned eight new spe-
cies of birds found on the islands of Curagoa and Old Providence.

Professor Poey has continued his contributions of fishes from Cuba,
and has, in all, supplied a noteworthy proportion of the hundreds of
species known to occur in the vicinity of that island.

Dr. Nichols, of Dominica, has continued his donations of birds, mol-
lusks, &e., while from Mr. Morris, director of the public gardens and
plantations in Jamaica, many samples of valuable fibers have been
secured.

Mexico and Central America.—Professor Alfred Dugés, of Guanajuato,
Mexico, has continued his transmissions of objects of natural history,
among them being some rare species of birds, &c. Mr. McLeod, of
Jesus Maria, in Mexico, has also furnished some rare birds.

As an ethnological contribution, Mr. Romero, the Mexican minister,
supplied a series of the playing cards and other gambling implements
of the Mexican Indians.

The services of Mr. Aymé, late consul at Merida, were secured to
prosecute some investigations into the ethnology of Yucatan and West-
ern Mexico, especially with a view of showing the relationships between
the habits and manufactures of the Indians of those regions and those
of the southern portion of the United States. Several large collections
have already been received from him, and others of still greater moment
are on the way.

Other collections, especially of birds, from Yucatan have been fur-
nished by Mr. Gaumer.

On the oceasion of establishing the boundary line between Guate-
mala and Mexico, the services of Prof. Miles Rock, of the Washington
Observatory, as astronomer, were secured by Guatemala, and he was
provided with a photographic apparatus, furnished by the Smithsonian
Institution, and many interesting views of scenery were obtained and
forwarded to the Institution.

Among the least known portions of Central America is the region
along the eastern coast of Honduras and the adjacent islands, and the
offer of Mr. Allstrom, an American engaged in mining researches in
that country, to make collections of natural history, &c., was gladly
accepted. No returns, however, have yet been received from him.
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In addition to the articles already mentioned, a valuable series of the
illustrations of the animal and vegetable kingdoms of Guatemala and
Salvador were secured from the Government commissioners of those
countries to the foreign exhibition held in Boston in the autumn of
1883. These, with similar collections under similar auspices obtained
from Venezuela and Brazil, were packed up in the early part of the
year 1884, under the immediate direction of one of the employés of the
National Museum, and transferred to the National Museum at Wash-
ington, where they will constitute an important addition to the collec-
tion.

Costa Rica.—As in previous years, Costa Rica has been well repre-
sented by the contributions of Mr. J. C. Zeledon, for many years in the
service of the National Museum, his transmissions consisting of speci-
mens of medicinal plants, of birds, of vertebrated animals, and of eth-
nology. Through his courtesy the National Museum is enriched with
an almost complete representation of the mammal and bird fauna of
that country.

Mr. R. Iglesias, of Chiriqui, has contributed some antiquities and
modern pottery.

Reference was made in the last report to the large collection of antiq-
uities, especially of sepulchral pottery, obtained in Chiriqui by Mr. J.
A. MeNeil, and secured through Messrs. Lamson & Bros., of New
York. An additional collection was made during the year under the
same auspices.

Nicaragua.—Among the most interesting and least known portions of
Nicaragua is the central region, between the Upper San Juan and Lake
Nicaragua. A short sojourn there has furnished to Mr. C. C. Nutting
quite a number of new species of birds. Mr. Nutting’s success induced
Dr. Walter Van Fleet to arrange for an expedition to that region under
the patronage of the Smithsonian Institution. Duly provided with let-
ters from the Institution, and with certain arrangements for facilitating
his work, Dr. Van Fleet proceeded to Aspinwall; but while waiting the
arrival of the steamer from Greytown he was taken ill, and obliged to
return to his home in Pennsylvania. He hopes, however, at an early
date to renew the experiment.

South America.—Interesting collections representing the natural prod-
ucts of the animal and vegetable kingdoms of Venezuela and Brazil
were secured from the Governments of Venezuela and Brazil. Dr. Will-
iam H. Jones, surgeon on the naval vessel stationed on the west coast
of Guiana, has contributed some extremely important collections of the
antiquities and natural history of the coast of Peru and Chili, and to
some extent of the Galapagos Islands. Many of the antiquities are of
unusual forms are of great rarity.

Mr. Kiefer, of Lima, has also made similar contributions.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27

Professor Nation, an eminent naturalist of Peru, has sent some types
of rare and undescribed species of birds of that country.

Dr. William N. Crawford, of the U. S. 8. “Shenandoah,” has also
contributed some rare shells from the west coast of Terra del Fuego and
the Straits of Magellan.

Hurope.—Large numbers of articles, both in single and collective
series, have been received from Europe, but as being derived from pub-
lie museums and not having any specially geographical significance, are
not mentioned here, but will be enumerated in detail in the report of
the Assistant Director of the National Museum.

It may, however, be well to refer to the arrangement made with Mr.
J. Gwyn Jeffries, of London, by which his magnificent collection of
recent and fossil shells of Europe has been acquiréd by the National
Museum and in large part received by it, several boxes of specimens
coming to hand during the year 1884. This is by far the most valu-
able private collection of European shells in existence, and especially
important in possessing so many types of the deep-sea species dredged
in the North Atlantic, and of great value for the determination of the
collections of the United States Fish Commission.

Among contributors to the European collections may be mentioned
the Royal College of Surgeons, the South Kensington Museum, the
British Museum, the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, in England; the
Museums of Berlin and Dresden, in Germany; of Copenhagen, in Den-
mark; of Bergen, in Norway, &ce.

Asia.—The collections from Asia have been of unusual significance
and importance. Reference has already been made to the accessions
from Kamtchatka and the Commander Islands as having been obtained
through the efforts of Dr. Stejneger, whose personal collections in those
countries were dwelt upon in the last report.

Mr. P. L. Jouy, a former employé of the National Museum, and resi-
dent for a number of years in Japan, continued his researches in that
country, and has supplied a large number of species of mammals and
birds of that region, together with other species of animals. The col-
lection of birds being taken in connection with a series presented by
Mr. Thomas Blackiston, who spent many years in Japan, gives to the
National Museum one of the most complete collections of Japanese
birds in existence, and one great in value in view of their relationships
to the birds of Western North America. Mr. Jouy has since trans-
ferred the field of his researches to Corea, although none of his collee-
tions have so far come to hand.

Rey. C. H. A. Dall has furnished some samples of fibers and other na-
tive products of the Indian, and the greater part of the exhibit of the
' Foreign Exhibition in Boston made by Ceylon; while a very valuable
collection of musical instruments of East India, and other objects rep-
resenting a high money value, were contributed by the Rajah of Tagore.
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Africa.—This country is represented by a few objects of art and in-
dustry, while from New Guinea the collection of weapons, implements,
&e., obtained from Mr. A. P. Goodwin, has added very greatly to our
representation of that little known island.

Madagascar.—Much attention has been directed to explorations in
Madagascar. Lieut. M. A. Shufeldt, of the Navy, left Norfolk a year or
two ago on the “ Enterprise,” and was enabled to leave theshipand spend
some time in Madagascar. On this occasion he made a large number of
photographic negatives, which were sent to the Smithsonian Institution .
for development, a set of the prints having been presented to the National
Museum. ‘These contained most interesting illustrations of the life, cus-
toms, and physiognomy of the people, as well as of the scenery which
they inhabit.

The Sandwich Islands.—The greater part of the exhibit made by the
Hawaiian Government at the Boston Foreign Exhibition was secured
and transferred to the National Museum. These, with the many speci-
mens brought home by the Wilkes expedition in its famous cruise, ren-
der the representation of that country very full and complete.

PUBLICATIONS.

Not much has been done during the year in the printing and distribu-
tion of special publications by the Smithsonian Institution, although the
activity of the National Museum in this respect has been very great.
It is expected, however, that during the year 1885, quite a number of
volumes will be printed and issued to institutions and libraries in cor-
respondence with it; these to appear in one or other of the three series,
‘‘ Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,” in quarto (of which 23 vol-
umes have been printed), the ‘‘ Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,”
in octavo (now numbering 27 volumes), and the annual “ Reports” of the
Institution, extending from 1847 to 1882, inclusive.

The ‘“ Sinithsonian Contributions” and ‘ Miscellaneous Collections”
include all publications made primarily under the auspices of the Na-
tional Museum, as well as the annual “ Proceedings” of the three princi-
pal societies of Washington, namely, the Philosophical, the Anthropolog-
ical, and the Biological Societies. The societies in question pay for
the type-setting of their volumes, and print an edition for distribution
tion to their own members. The Smithsonian Institution, however,
charges itself with supplying these books to public libraries and learned
societies at home and abroad, and has the pages stereotyped, and the
usual edition of 1,500 copies printed at its own expense.

The first publication made by the Smithsonian Institution, nearly
forty years ago, consisted of a memoir by Messrs. Squier and Davis
upon the ancient monuments of the Mississippi Valley, a work which |
marks the initial point of the great advancement made in the depart-
ment of archeology in later years, ‘The subject continues to be one
of much interest to the Institution, special attention having been
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

given to Securing as complete a series of archxological specimens
as possible for preservation in the National Museum. fF or several
years past Dr. Rau, the curator of the Department of Archeology, has
been working in the direction of further publications on this subject;
a valuable paper prepared by him having been printed in 1876, for use
in connection with the Centennial Exhibition, and which has since
then been the principal manual of information on the subject.

Dr. Rau is also superintending the preparation of drawings, by Mr.
C. F. Trill and others, of all the typical forms of stone implements and
objects not already figured in the Smithsonian publications. This is a
work of great magnitude, but it is hoped to commence the publication
of a new and systematic memoir at an early date.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.—Of the quarto series of pub-
lications no volume has been actually published during the year. A
memoir by Dr. Charles Rau on “ Prehistoric Fishing in Europe and
North America,” as illustrated by the archeological specimens collected
by the Institution, comprising about 350 quarto pages, has, however,
been put entirely into type, and, on the completion of an index, will be
issued.

The title of this work sufficiently explains its purport. The descrip-
tive portion is altogether based on existing antiquities bearing either
unmistakably or presumably on fishing in prehistoric times, and no con-
clusions whatever have been drawn exceeding the somewhat narrow
compass limited, as it were, by those tangible tokens. If the work had
been exclusively designed for persons well acquainted with the results
of prehistoric investigation in Europe, the author might have consid-
erably abbreviated its first part by excluding much introductive and
descriptive matter. But as it also may be read by non-archologists,
he has deemed it proper to dwell on the differences between the palo-
lithic and neolithic ages, to give accounts of the tool and bone bearing
drift-beds, the cave-habitations, artificial shell-deposits, lake-dwellings,
and, finally, to present a brief characterization of the bronzeage. Most
of these introductions are followed by a section, or sections, devoted to
notices of fish-remains, descriptions of fishing implements and utensils,
and suggestions in regard to the probable methods of fishing during the
period under consideration. The curious tracings of fishes and aquatic
mammals, characteristic of the reindeer-period, are treated in a sepa-
rate division.

In the first section of the second part, relating to prehistoric fishing
in North America, the available relics bearing on fishing, such as
straight bait-holders, fish-hooks, harpoon and arrow heads, nets, sinkers,
and fish-eutters, are described and figured, most of the objects being
specimens in the United States National Museum. Boats and their ap-
purtenances are next considered, and then follows an account of some
prehistoric structures connected with fishing. In the subsequent di-
BO... REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

vision plastic and graphic representations of fishes, aquatic animals,
&c., are treated, and finally a somewhat extended account of artificial
shell-deposits in various parts of North America is given.

Pages 261 to 518 contain extracts from various writings of the 16th,
17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, in which reference is made to aboriginal
fishing in North America.

In an appendix of 17 pages notices of fishing implements and fish-
representations discovered south of Mexico are given.

The volume embraces, without the index, xvi, 335 pages, and is
illustrated with a frontispiece and 405 figures in the text. Nearly all
the illustrations have been specially drawn for the work.

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.—Iin continuation of a former
series, vol. VI of the ‘“‘ Bulletin of the Philosophical Society of Wash-
ington” has been published as No. 543. It comprises the proceedings
of the society for the year 1883 (from the meeting of January 3 to
that of December 19), and forms an octavo volume of Lit pp. introduc-
tory + 168 pp., including an index; in all, 220 pp.

No. 544 of Smithsonian publications in like manner comprises the
‘Transactions of the Anthropological Society of Washington.” Vol.
11, from February 1, 1882, to May 15, 1883; forming an octavo volume
of x11I+ 211 pp.; in all, 224 pp.

No. 561 is a reprint of an article by General J. H. Simpson, U.S. A.,
on * Coronado’s March in Search of the ‘Seven Cities of Cibola,’ and
Discussion of their probable Location,” originally published in the
Smithsonian Report for 1869. This interesting memoir had never been
separately published, and the frequent inquiries for it seemed to justify
its reproduction. It forms an octavo pamphlet of 34 pp., illustrated by
a sketch map of Mexico (2 pp., 8vo), indicating the route pursued by
Coronado and his army, which extended as far north as the fortieth
parallel of latitude, near the present boundary separating the State of
Kansas from that of Nebraska.

No. 571 is ‘Check List of Publications of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion from December, 1881, to March, 1884.” 8vo, 8 pp.

No. 573 is ‘Price List of Publications of the Smithsonian Institution”
to March, 1884. 8vo, 7 pp.

No. 574 is “An Account of the Progress in Astronomy in the year
1883.” By Prof. Edward 8S. Holden. An octavo pamphlet of 78 pp.
This forms part of the annual scientific record which has for some years
past been prepared at the expense of the Institution for the Smithson-
ian report.

No. 575 is “An Account of the Progress in Geology in the year 1883.”
By Dr. T. Sterry Hunt. 8vo pamphlet of 22 pp.

No. 576 is “An Account of the Progress in Geography in the year

No. 580 is “An Account of the Progress in Mineralogy in the year
1883.” By Prof. Edward 8. Dana. 8vo pamphlet of 19 pp.

No. 581 is “An Account of the Progress in Botany in the year 1883.”
By Prof. William G. Farlow. 8vo pamphlet of 18 pp.

There has also been reprinted an edition of No. 34 (originally pub-
lished in March, 1859): ‘‘ Directions for Collecting, Preserving, and
Transporting Specimens of Natural History.” Third edition. 8vo
pamphlet of 40 pp.

Forest Trees— Among the earliest objects receiving the attention of
the Smithsonian Institution was the preparation of a work upon the
“ Forestry of North America,” under the direction of Dr. Gray, and for
which quite a number of plates were prepared more than thirty years
ago.

In part the cost of the publication and in part the pressure of other
duties upon Professor Gray have prevented the completion of this me-
moir; and a proposition having been made by Prof. C. 8. Sargent, of
Brookline, Mass., to take up and complete the work, the same was
accepted, and Mr. Faxon was authorized to make the necessary draw-
ings of the trees from living or fresh specimens. The magnitude, how-
ever, of this undertaking proved to be a little more than the Institution
could compass, and an arrangement has recently been made with Pro-
fessor Sargent to refund the cost of these drawings and to receive them,
so that he may use them in the publication which he has arranged to
make with a private publisher.

Among the treatises in preparation for publication by the Institution
may first be mentioned the beginning of a complete work on the “ Bot-
any of North America,” by Prof. Asa Gray.

Part II is in press. It comprises the Gamopetalous orders from
Caprifoliacee to Composite, inclusive. An enumeration by the author
indicates that of the Caprifoliacee there are 8 genera and 47 species ; of
Rubiacew, 26 genera and 86 species; of Valerianacee, 2 genera and 22
species; of Dipsacacew, 1 genus and 2 species (naturalized) ; of Compos-
ite, 237 genera and 1,610 species. It will form an octavo volume of
nearly 500 pages.

Bulletins of the National Museum.—As explained in the last annual re-
port, asupplementary edition of the Bulletins of the United States Na-
tional Museum, from the stereotype plates issued under the direction of
the honorable Secretary of the Interior, is printed at the expense of the
Institution, and is included in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collec-
tions. Seven scientific monographs on the geology and on the flora and
fauna of Bermuda, extracted from Bulletin No. 25 of the Museum series,
have been thus reproduced during the year.

“The Geology of Bermuda, by William North Rice, Ph. D.” (No. 563
39 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of the Smithsonian publications), forms an octavo pamphlet of 32 pages.

“The Botany of Bermuda, by General Sir John Henry Lefroy, F. R.
8.” (No. 564), forms an octavo pamphlet of 109 pages, illustrated with 5
wood-cut plates.

‘‘The Mammals of Bermuda, by J. Matthew Jones, F. R. 8. C.” (No.
565), forms an octavo pamphlet of 19 pages.

“The Birds of Bermuda, by Capt. Saville G. Reid, F. Z.S.” (No.
566), forms an octavo pamphlet of 117 pages.

‘‘On a Bird new tothe Bermudas, with Notesupon several species of
rare or accidental occurrence in these islands, by Clinton Hart Merriam,
M. D.” (No. 567), forms an octavo pamphlet of 4 pages.

“The Reptiles of Bermuda, by Samuel Garman” (No. 568), forms a
pamphlet of 19 pages, illustrated with 6 wood-cut plates, containing91
figures.

Annelida from Bermuda, by H. E. Webster (No. 569), forms an octavo
of 26 pages.

Proceedings of the National Museum.—This series (as heretofore ex-
plained) comprises carefully prepared memoirs on new and interesting
specimens and articles collected for the National Museum, and printed
as soon as material for a “signature” of 16 pages is madeup. This
series, like that of the “‘ Bulletins,” is primarily published and stere-
otyped under the authority and direction of the honorable Secretary of
the Interior. These articles or contributions comprise, first, papers pre-
pared by the scientific corps of the National Museum; secondly, papers
by other naturalists based on the Museum collections; and, lastly, of
memoranda and interesting information gathered from the correspond-
ence of the Smithsonian Institution.

Volume VI of the “ Proceedings of the United States National Mu-
seum” for 1883 (Smithsonian No. 548) was completed and published
during the past year. The volume contains papers by Tarleton H.
Bean, L. Belding, Katherine J. Bush, W. H. Dall, William J. Fisher,
James M. Flint, Charles H. Gilbert, Theodore Gill, G. Brown Goode,
G. H. Heap, William T. Hornaday, Frederick Humbert, J. G. Hunt,
David S. Jordan, Pierre Louis Jouy, George P. Merrill, E. W. Nelson,
A. P. Niblack, Charles C. Nutting, Richard Rathbun, Charles Rau, Rob-

C. Stearns, W. A. Stearns, Leonhard Stejneger, Joseph Swain, Freder-
ick W. True, S. T. Walker, Charles A. White, Merritt Willis, and H.
C. Yarrow. It forms an octavo volume of vit + 558 pages, illustrated

Smithsonian Annual Report—The Annual Report of the Regents of
the Institution to Congress for 1882, submitted January 19, 1883, was not
actually published and ready for distribution till the past year,1884. The
volume contains the Journal of Proceedings of the Board of Regents, the
reports of the Executive Committee of the Board, and of the Secretary
“REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3a

of the Institution, together with the “General Appendix,” which com-
prises the usual scientific record for the year, namely, an account of the
progress in Astronomy, by E.S. Holden; in Geology, by'T. Sterry Hunt ;
in Geography, by F. M. Green; in Meteorology, by Cleveland Abbe; in
Physics, by G. F. Barker; in Chemistry, by H. Carrington Bolton; in Min-
eralogy, by Edward 8. Dana; in Botany, by W. G. Farlow; in Zoology,
by Theodore Gill; and in Anthropology, by O.T. Mason; concluding with
a selection of miscellaneous papers on American aboriginal remains, ~
contributed by correspondents of the Institution. The Report forms an
octavo volume of xx + 855 pages, the archeological papers being illus-
trated by 46 wood-cuts and topographic sketches of mound localities.

The Annual Report for 1883, I regret to say, has not yet been pub-
lished.

The reports on the progress during the year of the various branches
of science have been continued, and meet with very hearty favor, espe-
cially on the part of teachers, who find in them material for presenta-
tion to their classes, not otherwise accessible at the time, excepting to
those who have command of a vast number of scientific journals.
Among these reports, and one of special interest, is that upon the prog-
ress of meteorology, prepared by Professor Abbe. To make this spec-
ially serviceable, a detailed index was necessary ; but it was not possi-
ble to have this completed before it became necessary to put the report
to press. ‘The index was, however, prepared, and has been appended
to the extra copies.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The operations of this important branch of the Institution have been
carried on with vigor during the past year. Great inconvenience was
experienced during the winter of 1883~84 owing to the limited quarters
available for exchange work during the reconstruction of the eastern
portion of the Smithsonian building. On the completion of the first
floor of this edifice five rooms were assigned to this department and
two in the basement; several new assistants were appointed, and I am
happy to state that ample facilities are now provided for the prompt
and efficient discharge of business. The work, however, is constantly
growing and demands unceasing attention.

Mr. George H. Boehmer, in charge of the international exchanges, has
seen in Europe for a large part of the year, engaged in taking the neces-
sary measures to improve and reorganize the relationships of the Smith-
sonian Institution to the European service of international exchanges.
A full account of his operations will be given in the next annual report.

Congressional Aid.—The appropriation by Congress for the exchange
system, under direction of the Institution, was increased for the year
188485 from $7,500 to $10,000. Without this aid it would be impossi-
ble for the Institution to continue its gratuitous service to the libraries

and societies in this country which have so long enjoyed the benefits
of the system.

Tiberality of Transportation Companies.— Thanks also to the liberality
of the principal steamship companies, the packages of the Institution
are still carried free of freight, a concession amounting to several thou-
sand dollars a year in value. Acknowledgments are due to the follow-
ing companies and firms for this voluntary service :

The Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the Baltimore and Ohio
Company have continued their concessions of reduced fares, and the
freight steamer lines between Washington and New York have also
made liberal concessions, which have been of very great value.

Acknowledgments are also due to the foreign ministers and consuls
of the various Governments for their assistance in taking charge of the
packages intended for the countries which they respectively represent
and transmitting them with care to their destination.

The following tables will give the statistics for 1584:

REPCRT OF THE SECRETARY 35
TRANSMISSIONS.

1. Foreign exchanges: 537 boxes, representing a bulk of 3,531 cubic feet, with a
weight of 131,350 pounds, being an increase of 118 boxes over the year 1883.

2. Domestic exchanges: 10,236 packages, of which 8,094 were addressed to institu-
tions, and 2,142 to individuals.

3. Government exchanges: 114 boxes, representing a bulk of 750 cubic feet, with a
weight of 27,885 pounds, against 76 boxes in 1853; or an increase of 38 boxes, as
compared with that year.

The increase over the year 1883 is most noticeable in the foreign and
Government exchanges, being 156 boxes, with a bulk of 993 cubic feet
and a weight of 36,970 pounds.

In the domestic exchanges there is an apparent decrease in the num-
ber of parcels, but this is owing to the fact that packages arriving by
mail for the Smithsofian library were formerly recorded by the ex-
change office, while during a great portion of the year 1884 this practice
had been discontinued.

Government Document Eachange.—The exchange of official publica-
tions of the United States Government for those of most other foreign
nations has been continued, as in previous years, under the auspices of
the Smithsonian Institution, in accordance with the law of Congress,
and a large number of valuable publications have been sent to agencies
designated by their respective countries.

During the year the Government of Great Britain has agreed to make
a complete exchange of all official documents, commencing with Janu-
ary 1, 1882, and preliminary arrangements have been made to the same
effect with the Government of Austria.

There are now thirty-eight foreign Governments regularly receiving
the publications of the United States.

For some time there has been considerable difficulty in establishing
the regular international exchange connection with the British Prov-
inces and the United States. A satisfactory arrangement, however,
has been made with the Geological Survey at Ottawa to receive and
distribute all parcels belonging to Canada proper, and by the kind aid
of Mr. Matthews, of St. John, N. B., Mr. Kane, of the custom-house at
St. John, has agreed to receive parcels for Nova Scotia, New Bruns-
wick, and Prince Edward Island, and to assess pro rata the freight
expenses upon the recipients. There only remains to make some satis-
factory arrangement with Newfoundland to complete the British pro-
vincial service, which it is thought can be accomplished before long.

Public Utility of the Smithsonian Exchanges.—The practical benefits of
the Smithsonian exchange system are extended to the remotest quar-
ters of the earth; and have been frequently acknowledged by eminent
scientific workers abroad. It has even been suggested that in the in-
terest of science, similar agencies in Great Britain and elsewhere, are
a great desideratum, notwithstanding the increasing activity among
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

European Governments in promoting international exchanges of official
publications. In a communication published in Nature, October 30,
1884 (vol. xxx, p. 634), Prof. V. Ball, of the chair of Geology and
Mineralogy in the University of Dublin, in warmly commending ‘ the
extraordinary liberality of the American Government” in its free dis-
tribution of the Geological Survey Reports, and other valuable works,
remarks as follows:

“ We owe much of this liberality, no doubt, to the forethought and
generosity of our own countryman, Smithson, the principal function of
the Institution founded by him, being to arrange for the exchange and
dispatch of books and specimens.*

‘There are perhaps few directions in which the cause of science would
be more directly benefited just now than by the establishment of an
institution in England which would undertake the management of the
exchanges of the scientific societies of the United Kingdom. I am
aware that there are paid agencies for the purpose, but what is wanted
is a free agency which would undertake the duty for the large societies
and relieve those that are struggling from charges which now press
heavily on their resources.

“The great desideratum, however, is a man like Smithson, who, pos-
sessing wealth, would be willing to give or bequeath it for the purpose
of founding such aninstitution. Here is an opportunity for any person
of capital—desirous of doing good and preserving his name to all pos-
terity by one and the same act.

“To return, however, to the main object of this letter, cannot anything
be done to increase the ‘ free list’ of Government publications? Surely
there must be stored away vast quantities of survey and other serial
publications, which if they were handed over to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, would, I feel certain, be gratefuNy accepted and judiciously dis-
tributed among the libraries of America.”

Difficulties of prompt Delivery.—It is perhaps proper to call attention
to the fact that the Institution does not undertake to act as an express
agency, guaranteeing to deliver packages in the most expeditious man-
ner and securing prompt returns. The number of correspondents is so
large, the places to be reached so numerous and some of them so diffi-
cult of access, that delays of weeks and even of months are frequently
necessary. The Institution desires to secure the speedy delivery of
everything intrusted to it, not only for the sake of the senders and the
credit of the exchange ageney, but because the constant accession of
packages is so great that it is not possible to allow them to accumulate.

It is very desirable that officers of societies or individuals who avail
themselves of the Smithsonian service should not inform the parties for
whom packages are intended in foreign countries that they have been
‘sent until the date of actual shipment is ascertained. This is a cause
of frequent complaint and misunderstanding, and might be entirely pre-
vented by due consideration of the case.

* This is really but one of the functions of the Institution, co-ordinated with that
of promoting original research,

RELATIONS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION TO OTHER BODIES.

I. To the Government—Congress.—Ever since the completion of the
new wings of the Capitol, the proper ventilation of the House of Rep-
resentatives has been a subject of anxiety to its members, and several
commissions of civilians have been appointed to consider the question.
Of these Professor Henry was chairman, and at the time of his death, in
1878, he had completed a renewed inquiry on the subject, and prepared
a report upon the same. In this office I succeeded Professor Henry,
and again, in February, 1884, was asked to form one of an advisory
committee (the other members consisting of Colonel Casey, of the
United States Engineers, Mr. Edward Clark, Architect of the Capitol,
and Dr. J. S. Billings, of the Army Medical Museum) to assist the
standing committee of the House of Representatives in its deliberations.
The question having arisen as to the purity of the air in different parts
of the hall and its approaches, a chemical analysis of the same was made
by Dr. J. H. Kidder, U. 8S. N., with the assistance of Mr. R. L. Packard
of the Bureau of Education, and some interesting and important state-
ments and generalizations were furnished. Their work was completed
on the 2d of April, and a report furnished in the same month and pub-
lished as a part of Report No. 1970, Forty-eighth Congress, first ses-
sion. The conclusions of the report are that—

1. The chemical examinations and tests indicate no impurity in the
air supplied to the House, nor unwholesome change during its passage
through the air-duct or the hall.

2. The air in the corridors and stairways is much less pure than that
ofine hall. *..*, *

5. The “relative humidity” as observed is about 20 per cent. below
the accepted standard, and probably falls much lower in cold weather,
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

6. The ventilation of the southeast gallery appears to be insuffi-
cient.

This examination, which included the estimation of 65 samples of air,
aud numerous hygrometric and anemometric observations, agrees sub-
stantially as to results with those undertaken by Professor Henry and
Dr. Charles M. Wetherill in 1865~66 (House Ex. Doc. No. 100, Thirty-
ninth Congress), and by Dr. Charles Smart, U.S. A., in 1880 (MS. re-
port to the Advisory Board).

Navy Department.—Reference has been made in previous reports to _
the arrangement by which, at the request of the Navy Department,
the institution received for three successive years six Ensigns, and
assigned them to duty in various sections of the National Museum
for the purpose of enabling them to become acquainted with certain
branches of science, such as chemistry, mineralogy, geology, ethnology,
general natural history, &c., in order that in their subsequent cruises
they might be more useful. Three details of the kind have been made,
none, however, in 1884, the Department having found it inexpedient to
continue the arrangement. Most of the gentlemen already detailed
have also been reclaimed and assigned to duty. Two of these Ensigns,
Messrs. Miner and Garrett, are now on the Fish Commission steamer
“Albatross.” Ensign Hayden was detached in October and ordered
to duty, first at the Cambridge Observatory and subsequently to the
United States Geological Survey. At present there are but two of
these gentlemen left, and they are daily expecting their orders.

The experiment in connection with these junior officers of the Navy
has been very satisfactory as far as it has gone, and there can be no
doubt that the increased range of information thus acquired by the
eighteen gentlemen so detailed will be utilized to a greater or less ex-
tent in the future.

As in previous years, the Navy Department has had charge of the
administration of the department of materia medica in the National
Museum, which renders unnecessary the establishment of a similar
bureau in the Navy Department itself. The first officer detailed by the
Medical Department for this purpose was Dr. J. M. Flint, under whose
efficient administration the collection was thoroughly organized and
placed in working order. On Dr. Flint’s transfer to the steamer ‘Alba-
tross,” in 1884, Dr. H. J. Beyer, of the Navy, was ordered to his place,
and gives general satisfaction.

Lieutenant Bowles, attached to the U. 8S. S. “Adams,” stationed at
Sitka for some time past, was enabled to make some interesting collec-
tions for the National Museum, and when this vessel was under orders
to return to San Francisco, Lieutenant Bowles made application for an
exchange of service with an officer of the ‘ Pinta,” so as to remain on
that vessel and continue his work. This request was granted by the
Navy Department with its usual courtesy.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Bo

Naval Observatory.—The Institution is indebted to the courtesy of the
Superintendent of the United States Naval Observatory for including
its building and that of the National Museum in the series.of public
establishments which receive telegraphic time at noon on each succes-
sive day, and a clock, fitted up under the direction of the Observatory,
with an arrangement by which the observatory itself corrects any aber
ration in time, has been supplied, and although the money expense has
been borne by the Institution, yet no charge has been made for the time
service. ,

War Department.—The Signal Service has continued during the year
that: co-operation which has heretofore been found very serviceable,
especially through its agencies in Labrador and Alaska. More par-
ticular reference will be made to this subject in the chapter on Explora-
tions, but it may be well here to particularize the work of Mr. Lucien
M. Turner at Fort Chimo, Ungava Bay, Northern Labrador ; of Messrs.
Murdoch and Smith, at Point Barrow; Dr. Stejneger, at the Commander
Islands, &c.

By the kindness of the Signal Office, Mr. John J. McLean, who has
rendered very much aid to the institution in its work while resident in
Alaska, was again ordered to that country by the chief signal officer.
The lamented death, by drowning, of Mr. C. L. McKay, in the vicinity
of Nushagak, Bristol Bay, was mentioned in the preceding report. The
vacaney thus effected was filled by the Signal Office by the appoint-
ment of Mr. J. W. Johnson, of East Rockport, Ohio. This gentleman
is a naturalist of considerable experience, and will continue Mr. McKay’s
work of securing such specimens of natural history as he can find time
to prepare in the intervals of his regular official work for the Signal
Service. ,

By the courtesy of Colonel Rockwell, Superintendent of Public Build-
ings and Grounds, the Institution was enabled to make connection wit].
the underground telephone laid by his authority throngh the public
grounds by the Waring Company. <A special advantage in this was
the opportunity of making a more satisfactory connection between the
National Museum building and the United States carp ponds, a service
that previously had been much interrupted. Connection was also made
through the same trench with the Fire-Alarm Telegraph Company, and
the necessary permission to open North B street was promptly grantec
by the District Commissioners.

Treasury Department.—The Director of the Mint, at the request of
the Institution, has furnished for display in the National Museum two
sets, in bronze, of all the medals struck at the United States mints.
These are of great historical value, and when properly installed will
doubtless be very attractive to the public.

LightHouse Board.—The usual courtesies of the Light-House Board
have been extended in the way of co-cperation in obtaining data by
which to determine the temperatures of the waters of the Atlantic
AO REPORT OF THE. SECRETARY.

Ocean, with a view of investigations into the causes of movements of
fish and other marine animals.

On the application of the Institution in behalf of the American Orni-
thologists’ Union the Board also promptly gave instructions to light-
house keepers to keep the record of migrations of birds as shown
principally by their being picked up after striking against the light-
houses on dark nights.

The instructions of the Life-Saving Service to its agents to co-operate
with the Institution in its investigations have also borne good fruit in
the way of collecting information of the occurrence of rare and inter-
esting forms of marine animals.

In order to increase in every possible way the material in the de-
partment of materia medica in the National Museum, above referred to,
under the Navy Department, application was made to the Treasury
Department for instructions to the collectors of customs in the sea-
board cities to transmit samples of drugs submitted by specialists for
investigation, so as to serve as illustrations of both the crude importa-
tions and the adulterations attempted from time to time by importers.
A favorable response was made, and quite a number of collections have
already been received.

The usual courtesies of the Revenue Marine to the work of the Smith-
sonian have been continued during the year, the chief of the bureau hav-
ing instructed its captains in Alaska to further Mr. Swan’s proposed
exploration for the Institution by receiving him and _ his collections on
board whenever such action will not interfere with the regular service
of the vessels. Captain Healy, of the ‘‘ Corwin,” has also, by the author-
ity of the bureau, continued to make important contributions of collec-
tions.

The chief of the Bureau of Revenue Marine also kindly instructed
the commander of the revenue steamer ‘‘ Key West” to assist Mr. Hemp-
hill in carrying on his explorations of the Florida keys in behalf of the
National Museum.

Interior Department.—It has always been the policy of the Smith-
sonian Institution to make amicable arrangements with the various
Departments of the Government by which to avoid duplication of effort
in material. This has been shown in many ways, as in the arrange-
ment with the Commissioner of Agriculture to transfer all specimens of
plants and insects to that establishment and all human crania to the
Army Medical Museum, receiving from them in return whatever might
belong to the department of general natural history and ethnology.

A second instance of this spirit was shown in the transfer to the
United States Signal Service of the results of the meteorological corre-
spondence and labors which had been so effective in the hands of the
Smithsonian Institution for nearly twenty-five years.

Major Powell, of the United States Geological Survey, has organized
a special department of maps and charts, with a view of utilizing the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 41

information they contain in his work, or of having standards of com-
parison for his own draughtsmen and engravers. The Smithsonian In-
stitution has been accumulating material of this kind for nearly forty
years, embracing many thousands of sheets, and the offer of this to
Major Powell was promptly accepted, with the assurance that it would
be properly classed and arranged, and be at all times at the command
of the Institution.

The co-operation of the Secretary of the Interior has been especially
manifested in connection with the publications of the National Museum,
and of the printing required for labels, blanks, &c. All the expendi-
tures of appropriations made by Congress for preservation of the col-
lections of the Government, the construction of cases and fixtures, the
payment of salaries of Museum employés, &e., are made through the
disbursing officer of the Interior Department, Mr. G. W. Evans, and the
annual estimates for the service of the Museum, for postage, printing,
and blanks, are made through its Secretary.

Railroad and Steamboat Lines and other Corporations.—As in previous
years, the various railroad lines of the country and the foreign steam-
ship companies have rendered aid either in the entire reduction of
charges or through a very large remission of charges. The number has
increased of steamship companies furnishing free freights to the parcels
of the Smithsonian Institution, especially those connected with the In-
ternational Exchanges; a list of these is subjoined. The services ren-
dered by these companies is of the utmost possible benefit, not only in
the very great reduction of transportation to the Institution, but also
in the greater care exercised in handling the packages. Among the
additional companies to which the Institution is under obligation may be
specially mentioned the Atlas Steamship Company, the vessels of which,
under the direction of Messrs. Pim, Forwood & Co., make connection
with nearly all ports of the West Indies and Central America.

The Institution is indebted to the Merchants and Miners’ Transporta-
tion Company for greatly reduced rates of freight between Washington
and Boston. This is a privilege of great importance, as sometimes there
is a large amount of freight to be carried by this route. °

Mr. C. G. Prindle, a well-known botanical collector, undertook an
exploration of the region adjacent to the boundary line between the
United States and Mexico west of El Paso, and at the request of the
Smithsonian Institution the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company
gave passes to himself and assistant, which greatly facilitated their
work. An exceptionally wet season brought about an unusual develop-
ment of vegetation, and many points of interest were visited by Mr.
Prindle in the course of his labors with rich results.

To General Manager Robinson, of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fé Railroad, the Institution is indebted for a free pass for the year 1885,
to be used by one of its employés in an exploration of the natural his-
tory along the line of that road.
42 _ REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The Alaska Commercial Company has continued its liberal and im-
portant aid to all the operations of the Institution on the Pacific coast.

The co-operation of the Hudson’s Bay Company in the work of the
Smithsonian Institution, which commenced as long ago as 1858, has
been continued throtigh successive years; the latest instance being the
courtesy by which Mr. Lucien M. Turner was enabled to spend two
years at Ungava Bay, in Northern Labrador, in the service of the United
States Signal Office and of the Smithsonian Institution. The company
has also granted the necessary authority, and has given instructions to
its agents in this country in connection with the proposed exploration
of the region about the mouth of the Mackenzie River.

Co-operation with the American Associakon.—At the meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, held at Montreal
in 1882, a committee was appointed, consisting of Professors H. Car-
rington Bolton, Ira Remsen, F. W. Clarke, Albert R. Leeds, and Alexis
A. Julien, ‘to devise and inaugurate a plan for the proper indexing of
the literature of the chemical elements.” To forward this useful en-
terprise the Smithsonian Institution undertook to distribute for the com-
mittee any circulars or other documents issued by its authority. At
the next meeting of the Association, held at Minneapolis in 1883, the
committee on indexing reported progress, and acknowledged the
friendly offices of the Institution as ‘an offer of great importance, and
for which this committee expresses sincere thanks.”

In further aid of a work so valuable to chemical research and to the
advancement of science this Institution has also announced its readiness
to undertake the publication of the various bibliographical indexes com-
piled under the auspices of the committee; not, however, in excess of
fifty pages per annum. At the meeting of the Association held at Phil-
edelphia last September /1884) the committee on indexing reported a
number of special indexes as completed, and stated:

‘““Two hundred and fifty copies of our report for 1883 have been sent
to chemists throughout the United States, the Smithsonian Institution
having kindly attended to the distribution by mail without expense to
the committee. This led to correspondence with several chemists, who
regarded the scheme of co-operative indexing favorably, and resulted
in several offers of assistance.

** We are pleased to announce that in consequence of our representa-
tions the Smithsonian Institution has consented to publish indexes to
chemical literature which shall be indorsed by this committee. The
Smithsonian Institution places a limit to the number of pages which
will be printed per annum, but the limit is a generous one. By thus
securing the assistance of the Smithsonian Institution chemists are
assured of a reliable and authoritative channel of publication, together
with a wide circulation, and the plan of co-operative indexing will un-
doubtedly receive a great stimulus.”

The committee’s report for 1884, extracted from the proceedings of the
American Association for the year, was published as a three-page cir-
cular in October, and the same has been distributed by this Institution
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 43
~ to chemists and others interested in the subject. A copy of this cireu-
lar is appended to this report.

Electrical Exhibition at Philadelphia —An “International Electrical
Exhibition,” under the direction of the Franklin Institute of the State
of Pennsylvania, was held at Philadelphia from September 2 to Octo-
ber 11, 1884. Although the activities of the Institution have not for
many years past been directed to the extension of our knowledge in
the field of electrical science, nor any recent memoirs on the subject
published under its auspices, yet, as expressive of the interest felt in
the proposed movement, an exhibit was prepared and forwarded to the
directors before the opening of the exhibition. This exhibit comprised
two quarto volumes of original memoirs relating to electricity and
magnetism, collected from the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowl-
edge (averaging about 500 pages each), with specially-prepared title-
pages, and neatly bound; and also three octavo volumes on the same
subject, collected from the miscellaneous papers published at various
times in the annual Reports of the Institution, in like manner supplied
with appropriate title-pages, and neatly bound in a uniform style.
These five volumes were presented to the Franklin Institute as a per-
manent contribution to its memorial electrical library. .a framed por
traitof Professor Henry, of life size, in crayon, by Mr. H. Ulke, was
also forwarded for exhibition, with a framed legend attached, briefly
stating the more important contributions of the late Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution to the scientific and practical applications of
electricity.

In addition to these, the original telegraphic instrument constructed
for Professor Morse by Mr. Alfred Vail, and operated by them in the
first experimental communication by electro-magnetism between Balti-
more and Washington (May 24, 1844)—on deposit in the National Mu-
seum—was loaned to the Exhibition, by permission of Mr. Stephen
Vail, the owner and depositor of the instrument, and placed in its hall
of historical relics and memorials.

For the purpose of having the interest of the Smithsonian Institution
represented, Mr. William B. Taylor was commissioned to attend the
Electrical Exhibition to see after the exhibits of the Institution, and to
make such general examination of the extent, character, and details of
display as might prove instructive or useful. Mr. Taylor remained at
Philadelphia on this service one week, the cost to the Institution being
only his traveling expenses.

State and International Exhibitions.—The time and attention of the
officers of the Smithsonian Institution have been occupied for a number
of years past in the preparation of displays for exhibitions, national and
State. Notably among them may be mentioned the International Ex-
hibition at Philadelphia in 1876, the Berlin Fisheries Exhibition in 1880,
the Louisvillle Exhibition in 1883, the London Fisheries Exhibition in

nati, and the International Cotton Exposition at New Orleans, opening
in December, 1884. ;

Many applications are made from time to time to the Institution for
material for display, but in every instance they have been declined, un-
less an act of Congress has been passed authorizing the same, and mak-
ing the necessary appropriation. It is considered that the Institution
has no right to allow any of its collections to leave the walls of the Mu-
seum without such authority, and as the appropriations are each made

for a specific purpose, all expenditures of the same are strictly applied | -

as designated.

Great confusion is generally caused in the regular work of the Na-
tional Museum, as the time of the curators and assistants is occupied in
spasmodic efforts, apart from the regular continuous work necessary to
properly install and label the permanent collections. This condition is
cheerfully met, however, as the appropriations are generally such as
permit, and, indeed, require, the acquisition of new material which may
not be attainable excepting by purchase or expenditure of some kind.
Thus, with the help of the appropriations for the Berlin and London
displays, the Museum has acquired what may safely be considered the
most complete exhibition of fishery apparatus, methods, and products
ever combined under one roof, and constituting an object of great at-
traction to visitors. The experience of the present year is also in the
same direction; all funds available being expended specially in procur-
ing material illustrative of archeology and ethnology, and in bringing
together very extensive representations of the general industries of
the United States connected with textile materials, metallurgy, &c. The
increase in the collections of the Museum by this means and others is
so rapid as to involve the necessity for the speedy erection of a new
building for their proper accommodation.

In accordance with an act of Congress making provision for the par-
ticipation by the United States in the International Cotton Exhibition
at New Orleans, Mr. G. Brown Goode was nominated as the representa-
tive of the Fish Commission on that occasion and was duly commissioned
to that effect in May last. In conjunction with the representatives from
other departments, Mr. Goode has been diligently occupied in his labors,
which were brought to a satisfactory conclusion by the transmission of
several car-loads of objects to New Orleans in December last.

Prior to the transmission of collections to New Orleans, extended
displays were made at the exhibitions in Cincinnati and Louisville, some
of which have been returned to the Institution and others forwarded

direct to New Orleans.
NECROLOGY.

Dr. ARNOLD HENRY GuyotT, one of the earliest contributors to the in-
terests and the publications of the Smithsonian Institution, is one whose
death early in the past year we have to lament. Born at Boudevilliers,
near Neuchatel, in Switzerland, September 28, 1807, he entered the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

second class of the college of Neuchatel in 1821, going thence to Carls-
ruhe (where, in 1825, he formed an intimacy and lasting friendship with
Agassiz), afterward to the classical gympasium of Stuttgardt, returning
to Neuchatel in 1827. In 1829 he entered the university at Berlin, from
which institution he received the degree of Doctor in Philosophy in 1835.
The next four years he spent in Paris, making sammer excursions of
physiographical observations through France, Belgium, Holland, and
Italy, and in 1838 studying glaciers in Switzerland, and investigating
the distribution of erratic bowlders. In 1839 he was made professor of
history and physical geography at Neuchatel, where his early friend
Agassiz had already for some half a dozen years been professor of
natural history. Dr. Guyot held this position for ten years, assisting
Agassiz in the “‘Systeme Glaciaire,” published in 1847.

In 1848, Dr. Guyot, at the urgent solicitation of his friend Agassiz,
came to this country—the latter having been here already about two
years. He was employed for six years by the Massachusetts board of
education as lecturer to the normal schools of the State on geography
and its methods of teaching. In 1849 a course of his lectures in French
on “ The Earth and Man” were published in an English translation by
Professor Felton.

In 1859 he was invited by the Smithsonian Institution to assist in
developing the system of meteorological observations for the North
American continent, then recently organized. In addition to valuable
suggestions in consultation with other eminent meteorologists, as a
needful reference work in the labor of the various reductions from ex-
tended observations, Dr. Guyot undertook the collection, computation,
and arrangement of a series of graduated tables of constants—physical
as well as meteorological—for the use of those engaged in such investi-
gations. This valuable work, comprising 212 printed pages, together
with * Directions for Meteorological Observations,” comprising 70 printed
pages, mainly by the same author, was published in 1852, as the first
volume of the ‘‘ Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,” and at once
became in great demand.

Dr. Guyot at this time made a careful study of the physical geography
of the eastern portion of our country from Maine to South Carolina.
In 1854 he was elected professor of geology and physical geography in
the College of New Jersey at Princeton, a chair which he held till the
time of his death, a period of thirty years. A second edition of his
standard work, the “ Tables,” amended and greatly enlarged, was pub-
lished by the Institution in 1857, and a third edition in 1859, which ex-
tended to 638 octavo pages.

He was one of the original members of the National Academy of
Sciences at its organization in 1863. In the preparation of Jobnson’s
‘New Universal Cyclopedia,” a very elaborate and valuable work in
four large and closely printed volumes, published in 1875~78, he was
Dr. Barnard’s assistant editor-in-chief. Indefatigable in his efforts to
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

render complete his favorite production, the “ Meteorological and = .
sical Tables,” he commenced the preparation of a new edition, with stin
further additions in 1879, and this fourth edition, embracing about 750
octavo pages, was published by the Institution in the past year. But
the distinguished author did not live to see the last pages of the work
through the press. He died at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, Feb-
ruary 8, 1834, in the 77th year of his age.

HENRY GASS, for many years an employé of the Institution, died at
his residence in this city on the 10th of April, 1884, of consumption, at
the age of 49 years. He was appointed as a general messenger in Feb-
ruary, 1855, and though occupying a comparatively humble position,
by his fidelity and attention to his duties he made himself very useful.
Of late years he had been intrusted with the mail transmission of
Smithsonian publications to individual correspondents and applicants.
His health, never very robust, had been declining for a year or two,
but he continued at his post till within a few months before his death.
Patient and accommodating, he was kindly regarded by all with whom
he was brought into intercourse.

CLARENCE BISHOP YOUNG, the accountant of the Institution, died
on the 17th of April, 1884. He was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on
the 3d of February, 1846, but came to the United States with his parents
in 1849. He was graduated from Columbian College, Washington City,
in 1864, and from Harvard College in 1868. He completed the scien-
tific course in the Lawrence Scientific School. Before entering Har-
vard he was for two years a clerk in the Fourth Auditor’s Office, Treas-
ury Department. After leaving college, and while perfecting himself
in mechanical engineering in the city of New York, he was one of the
editors of an industrial journal. At the request of Professor Henry he
accepted a place in the Smithsonian Institution in 1870.as clerk and
book-keeper, which he retained until his death. He always discharged
his duties with punctuality, judgment, and accuracy. During his ex-
tensive service in the Institution, his modest and courteous demeanor,
his readiness to assist others when applied to, and his careful attention
to all details submitted to him, won the respect and warm regard of
all his as.uciates. He was a fine linguist, and his general scientific
culture and critical acumen rendered his services especially valuable in
revising papers and printers’ proofs for the Smithsonian publications.
In 1873 he was commissioned by Professor Henry to attend the Vienna
Exposition and visit the various agencies in Europe of the Institution.
Ill health, attended with great nervous prostration, compelled him to
withdraw from all active occupation for a year before he finally passed

away.
MISCELLANEOUS.

Edinburgh Ter-centenary.—The Smithsonian Institution was invited
by the University of Edinburgh to send a delegate to be present at the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 47

celebration of its tercentenary, and Hon. J. Russell Lowell, American
minister to England, was requested by the Institution to act in that
capacity. He did so to its entire satisfaction and gratification, and oc-
cupied quite a prominent place on the occasion in question.

Sonorous Sand.—An interesting problem to physicists and geologists
has been a sand found in certain localities, which, when placed in motion
by sliding, sometimes produces a very sonorous or resonant sound quite
peculiar in character and quite difficult of explanation. The subject
has received considerable attention from specialists, and Prof. H. C.
Bolton, of Trinity College, Hartford, Conn., desirous of making re-
searches on the subject, and especially in studying the microscopical,
chemical, and physical peculiarities of the grains, requested the aid of
the Institution in obtaining materials for the purpose. Letters were
addressed to parties in the Sandwich Islands, the coast of Oregon, Ger-
many, and many other places, and a considerable variety of specimens
from various localities has been received in response. These are now
in Professor Bolton’s hands, who will prepare a report on the subject.

The Mercer Estate.—References have been made in previous reports
respecting the will of the Rev. Dr. Mercer, of Newport, in which the
Smithsonian Institution and Harvard and Yale Colleges are made trust-
ees to administer certain scholarships.

A question arose as to whether these designations meant the present
incumbents of the offices or those who might be in power ‘at the time
when the provisions of the will should take effect.

This question having been brought before the courts of Rhode Island,
‘t was decided that reference was made to the officers in the abstract,
and not to the individuals, so that whoever may be in charge of the es-
tablishments in question when the provisions of the will are carried
into effect will be competent to take action. The amount involved at
present is about $300,000, and is likely to be doubled before action is
required. This action is contingent upon the death of certain legatees,
which will not take place, according to the tables of mortality, for about
thirty-five years.

Walker Prize.—Dr. William J. Walker a number of years ago be-
queathed to the Boston Society of Natural History a prize fund, from
the income of which an annual award was to be made to the compet-
itor having written the best essay on specified topics. In addition to
these annual awards, an honorary prize of from five hundred or one
thousand dollars (at the discretion of the society) is founded, to be
awarded every five years, ‘for such investigation or discovery as may
seem to deserve it, provided such investigation or discovery shall have
been made known or published in the United States at least one year
previous to the time of award.” The prize is to be bestowed on recom-
mendation of a special commission appointed by the society tor the pur-
pose.
4§ REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In January of the past year, the Secretary of this Institution was des-
ignated as one of such committee (together with Dr. Asa Gray, one of
the Regents, and Prof. J. S. Newberry). The prize of $1,000 was
awarded on their recommendation to Prof. James Hall, of Albany, by
the society, May 7, 1884.

Telegraphic Astronomical Announcements.—In the last annual report
(1883) was recorded the final transfer to the Harvard College Observa-
tory of the system of telegraphic announcement of astronomical dis-
coveries inaugurated by this Institution in 1873. ‘The belief was ex-
pressed that astronomical interests would be benefitted by placing this
useful service in the charge of a working observatory. It is gratifying
to learn that the expectation has been justified by the result. In the
thirty-eighth Annual Report of the Director of the Astronomical Observ-
atory of Harvard College (Prof. Edward C. Pickering), laid before the
Board of Overseers, January 9, 1884, it is remarked :

‘‘The system of announcing astronomical discoveries employed here
for some years past has received an important extension during the
last year. An association of over fifty observatories has been formed,
with its headquarters at Kiel, for the purpose of expediting the an-
nouncement of astronomical discoveries. The Smithsonian Institution,
which had for many years rendered an important service to astronomy
by transmitting astronomical.telegrams between Europe and America,
courteously signified its readiness to transfer this function to the ob-
servatory of Harvard College, upon learning that this observatory was
prepared to undertake it. ‘The change was announced by a circular
issued by the Smithsonian Institution on January 10, 1583, and since
that time the observatory has distributed in this country the astro-
nomical intelligence received from the European association, and has
forwarded to Kiel the information of American discoveries.”

Special Donations to the Smithsonian Institution.—The relationship of
Professor Henry, the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to
the progress of scientific discovery, by which the Morse electric tele-
graph system was established, must always give an interest to anything
illustrating the early history of the invention. Knowing this fact, Mr.
Stephen Vail has deposited with the Institution one of the two original
Morse telegraphic instruments made for experimental service between
Washington and Baltimore, and this has been placed in the National
Museum, where it attracts much interest among inventors. By permis-
sion of Mr. Vail it was lent for a time to the Electric Exhibition in
Philadelphia, but has been duly returned and put in its proper place.
Application has been made for it by parties connected with the New
Orleans Exposition, and with the permission of the owner, the instru-
ment will be sent to that city.

A life-size statue of Prof. Benjamin Silliman, one of the pioneers of
physical science in America, and the founder of the American Journal of
Science, was recently modeled by Prof. John I. Weir, cast in bronze (8
feet in height), and placed permanently in Yale College, at New Haven.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

Through the kindness of Prof. Benjamin Silliman, son of the eminent
savant in question, the model of this statue, in plaster, was presented
to the Institution and deposited in the National Museum, where it is
proposed to bring together as complete a collection as possible of busts
or portraits of the men whose work has definite relationship to the ob-
jects of the Institution.
The Institution received, in February, a complete set of standard
weights and measures of the United States from Professor Hilgard, Su-
perintendent of the Coast Survey, and of the United States Department
of Weights and Measures. This set was placed in the Institution in ae-
cordance with the requirements of the act of Congress of March 3, 1881.
(Statutes, XXI, p. 521.)
The set (No. 40) consists of the following:
1. Measure of length: A yard scale divided to inches and tenths, with
a matrix for the comparison of end yards.
2. Weights: 25, 10, 5, 5, 2, 2, and 1 ee 8, 4, 2,1, 4, 4, and 4
ounces, and 500, 200, 200, 100, 50, 20, 20, 10, 5, 2, 2, an 1 grains.
5. Capacity measures, cane A Jaina a quart; a pint.
4, Capacity measures, dry: A half-bushel; a peck; a half-peck; a
quart.
Adjustments: The yard is a line measure and an end measure. The
jaws of the matrix forming the latter are given a slight slope.
The yard scale is standard at 569.8 Fahr.
The bottom of the matrix is standard at 669.4 Fahr.
The top of the matrix exceeds the bottom by about three hundredths
(0.03) inch.
The expansion of the brass scale may be assumed as 0.00036 inch for
OR.
The weights are so closely adjusted to the standards that any correc-
tions developed in the final comparisons are insensible.
The liquid measures are adjusted to the temperature of 60° F. At
' this temperature—
The gallon = a standard gallon —0.007 cubie inch.
The quart = a standard quart —90.003 cubic inch.
The pint = a standard pint —0.005 cubic inch.
The dry measures are adjusted to the temperature of the maximum
density of water. At this temperature—
The half-bushel = standard —0.009 cubie ineh.
The peck = standard +0.007 cubic inch.
The half-peck = standard +0.0003 cubic inch.
The quart = standard +0.002 eubie inch.

donors, is now in the Metallurgical Department, a conspicuous and
attractive portion of the Museum.

A very important service has been rendered to the Institution during
the year by Capt. Charles Bendire, of the First Cavalry. This officer
was detailed on an Army Board, and utilized the opportunity of his
abode in Washington for a number of months by completely reorganiz-
ing and rearranging the collection of eggs of birds contained in the -—
National Museum. In the course of this operation he presented and °
interpolated the whole of his own collection of eggs, which was the finest
extant, so far as western America is concerned, and well supplied with
the species of the Eastern States, as well as those of Europe. Dr. J. C.
Merrill, of the Army, was prevailed upon to present his very fine col-
lection, which filled some of the few gaps in Captain Bendire’s series.

The National Museum and Smithsonian Institution are not -only
greatly indebted to Captain Bendire for the donation of one of the.most
important contributions it has ever received but‘also for the scientific

service rendered and for the accurate identification, labelling, and ar-

rangement, in an extremely attractive and novel manner, of the entire
series. The collection is now considered to be in excellent order, and
occupies one of-the small rooms adjacent to the northeastern pavilion.

Among the desiderata of the National Museum, and one necessary to
complete its material for study and exhibition, is that ofa collection of
plants from the different regions of the globe, and for obtaining which
no opportunity has hitherto presented itself. A very satisfactory ar-
rangement was made with Prof. Asa Gray, of Cambridge, to secure
the duplicates of what is known as the Joad Herbarium. Mr. Joad was
a botanist and much interested in the subject, and, having the means at
his command, brought together, in the course of his long life, one of
the most extensive private collections of plants known to men of science.
This collection went at his death, by bequest, to the Royal-Gardens at
Kew, London, and as that establishment had the greater number of
the species represented on its shelves, it transferred the collection to
the Herbarium at Cambridge, Mass. This collection also was nearly
complete, and after selecting comparatively few desiderata, Professor
Gray, in charge, offered to the Smithsonian Institution the remainder
on condition of payment of freight from-London, agreeing, at the same
time, to attend without cost, to the poisoning of the specimens, their
arrangement and proper labelling in suitable}portfolios. All this was
accomplished at a cost of a little over $500, and a,collection of over
10,000 species is now in the Museum and at the seryice of students.

At the close, in 1884, of the foreign exhibition hefd in Boston, which
opened in 1883, a large number of exhibits were contributed to the In-
scitution by foreign governments and commercial exhibitors. These,
with other donations of greater or less interest, will be noted in the-re-
port of Mr. Goode, the assistant director. I may mention here, how-
ever, that. among the contributions of this character were the greater
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. at

part of the exhibits made by Guatemala, Salvador, Ceylon, the Sand-
wich Islands, &e.

Among other interesting contributions to the Institution has been
what purports to be the first flag made in America from American silk.
By a formal order of Congress this was transferred to the National
Museum, and occupies a satisfactory position therein.

While the Smithsonian Institution is frequently favored by visits of
men of science from other countries for the purpose of special inquiry
into its methods or as an incident to travel through the country, an
unusual throng of such callers was welcomed during the centennial
year of 1876, on accountof the number connected with the foreign com-
missions and European visitors generally. A meeting somewhat simi-
lar—that of the British Association in Montreal—furnished a great in-
crease over the average, although, while savants of all countries were
represented in 1876, the visitors of 1884 were principally Englishmen,
who had been in attendance during the meeting of the British Associa-
tion in Montreal. Several distinguished naturalists took the occasion
to s‘udy the collections of the National Museum as containing many
important types otherwise inaccessible to them.

The Acclimatization Society of Budapest, Austria-Hungary, having
made application to the Smithsonian Institution for aid in obtaining a
sufficient supply of American hickory nuts for experimental cultivation,
through Mr. John Xantus, for many years a highly valued correspond-
ent of the Institution, the matter was referred to Mr. Thomas Mee-
han, of Germantown, Pa., the well-known florist and pomologist, who
attended promptly and satisfactorily to the call.

Within the year a very active organization has been established un-
der the name of the American Ornithologists’ Union, having for its ob-
ject the determination of many points of interest in connection with
the migration and history of the birds of North America, which can
only be ascertained by a concurrent effort extended over a wide area.

One of the principal objects of this Association has been the pre-
paration of a reliable nomenclature of North American birds. A re-
vision of the previous list, now in progress, will probably be published
before long, and will doubtless receive the assent of all working orni-
thologists.

As it is desirable to ascertain the amount of destruction of birds by
striking against light-houses along the coast, with the corresponding
indications of dates and routes of migration of the different species,
the Union, through its Secretary, Dr. C. Hart Merriam, has issued cir-
culars to the light-houses of the United States and Canada, to be filled
up and returned.

An appeal made to the Institution for co-operation was promptly
met, the Institution undertaking the expense of printing the blanks
and circulars in question, as being strictly germane to its functions. A
sutliciently large edition was prepared and transmitted to the Secretary,
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and it is understood that important returns have already been received,
which, with others, will be duly digested and published.

In ine re-organization of the affairs of the National Museum, conse-
quent upon taking possession of the new building, an important place
was given fora complete collection of materia medica of the whole world,
civilized and barbarous, as also for a series of suitable artificial combi-
nations of the elements in nature. In connection with this the services
of Dr. J. M. Flint, surgeon, U. 8. N., were obtained from the Secretary
of the Navy, and the Institution owes everything to the doctor for
establishing this collection on a firm basis. Dr. Flint’s term having
expired, he was transferred to the U. S. Fish Commission steamer
“Albatross,” and Dr. H. G. Beyer assigned to duty in his place on June
4, 1884. Dr. Beyer has been since that time actively engaged in carry-
ing on the work begun by Dr. Flint, as also initiating some important
measures of his own.

When the Chemical Department of the Smithsonian Institution was
first organized, Dr. F. M. Endlich was placed in charge, and per-,
formed its duties with fidelity and efficiency. On his resignation to
take charge of some extensive mining operations in the Southwest,
Dr. F. W. Taylor, of Washington, was appointed in his place. The
climate of Washington proving too severe for Dr. Taylor’s health,
he received leave of absence for some months, for the purpose of visit-
ing New Mexico, and on his arrival there, finding that it was in every
way. to his advantage, he resigned his position in the Institution on
June 10, 1884, greatly to our regret. He was succeeded in charge of
the jaboratory of the Institution by Prof. F. W. Clarke, the chemist of
the United States Geological Survey.

UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

A little more than three years ago, in the fall of 1881, the occupancy
of the new Museum building was begun, by moving into it several
thousand packing boxes full of unassorted and uncatalogued material,
the accumulation of many previous years. Themembers of the Museum
staff have been struggling ever since with this fragment of chaos, and
it gives me great pleasure to state that at the present time they have
finally gained the mastery over it. The material is now under control,
and has all heen assorted and assigned to its proper departments. Ex-
cept in a few curatorships, which are not yet entirely organized, the
specimens have been catalogued, and are available for study. The prep-
aration of the exhibition series has not yet been completed, however,
owing to the necessary delays in the work of printing the labels and
making the exhibition cases. Two things have interfered materially
with the progress of the work: first, the tremendous influx of new ma-
terial, which has required immediate attention to insure its safety,
3,509 packages having been received during the year; and, second, the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

interruptions caused by the preparations for the exhibitions in London,
New Orleans, Louisville, and Cincinnati, which have really put back
the work of arranging the collections at least twelve months.

It must be remembered that the ‘* National Museum” is actually
an institution of very recent origin, although the idea of the National
Museum has been in process of development for very many years. As
recently as 1877 the appropriation made by Congress for its support

yas only $10,000. The “ National Museum” was not recognized by that
name in the Congressional appropriation bills until 1876, although the
term was used in the reports of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution as early as 1868,* and although the national collections were
transferred to the custody of the Institution in 1858, in accordance with
the act of incorporation passed in 1846, by which it is provided that,
‘Call objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects
of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens
belonging or hereafter to belong to the United States, which may be in
the city of Washington,” shall be delivered to the Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution, and, together with new specimens obtained
by exchange, donation, or otherwise, shall be so arranged and classified
as best to facilitate their examination and study.t

Nearly half a century has passed since the United States, by the pro-
visions of the will of James Smithson, first became proprietor of a sci-
entific collection, in the shape of the Smithson minerals and meteorites;
it is forty-three years since the National Institute was founded, with
great prestige and influence, for the avowed purpose of organizing a
National Museum of Natural History; thirty-eight since Congress threw
upon the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution the responsibility of
caring for the so-called “ National Cabinet of Curiosities;” twenty-seven
since this responsibility was finally accepted and these collections were
transferred to the Smithsonian building; thirty-five since the Institu-
tion began to make collections of its own; eight since Congress has
really recognized the ‘‘ National Museum” as its ward, and four since
the Museum has had a shelter of its own, and an appropriation in any
way adequate to the necessities of its administrative work. The year
1880, then, marks an epoch in the history of the Museum, since at this
time Congress saw fit to recognize the claims of the Museum by increas-
ing the appropriations for its preservation and installation from $34,500
to $135,000. :

Their responsibility in the matter they had, however, recognized in
1879, by appropriating $250,000 for the construction of a fire-proof
building. The claims of the Museum to increased support had been

before them for three or four years—ever since, indeed, by their own act,
in connection with the preparations for the participation of the Govern-
ment Departments in the International Exposition in Philadelphia, and
the valuable gifts of foreign Governments upon that occasion, the Smith-
sonian building had been filled to overflowing with unassorted material

of the highest value for educational and scientific uses. These facts
should be borne in mind in considering the present condition of the
Museun, which is really—thanks to a large and efficient staff of cura-
tors—in much better condition than a glance at the exhibition halls
would seem to indicate.

If Congress continues its present policy in making appropriations for
the coming fiscal year I shall be abie to report at your next meeting
that the exhibition series of specimens is in nearly as good condition
as the study series—which is not now the case, for it has been our policy
to work from the foundation upwards and to get the great mass of the
reserve collections into good condition, before attempting to prepare
the selected series of specimens for display in the open cases.

More than ten years ago*—as Assistant Secretary—I pointed out in
my report to the Secretary of the Institution that the annual growth of
the Museum was undoubtedly greater than that of any other in the
world; that is, so far as the accession of great masses of material was
concerned. The increase at present is much greater than formerly, but
the accessions are much more manageable, owing to the larger number
of assistants employed. For twenty years the Assistant Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, with theshelp of one or two laborers and such
students as happened to volunteer their aid, performed all the duties of,
curatorship of the national collections. It was not until 1874 that a
special staff of Museum assistants was recognized, with duties apart
from the executive work of the Institution, and not until 1875 that the
office of curator was established, that office being held by the Assist-
ant Secretary from 1875 to 1878. Up to 1880 there was still but one
curator, with a number of “assistants,” but during that year an execu-
tive officer, with the grade of assistant director, was appointed, and the
five principal assistants in the Museum were designated curators. The
present organization of the personnel, then, dates back only five years,
to the time when preparations were being made for taking possession of
the new building. :

The staff, as now organized, consists of two classes—the scientific
officers, or curators, and the administrative officers; the former report:
ing to the director of the Museum, the latter to the assistant director,
who also has general supervision of the administrative work of the
curators.

There are at present 19 curatorships, some of which are divided as
indicated below, so that the number of heads of departments or sub-

36, of whom 24 are in the pay of the Museum, and the others are hon-
orary, 5 being detailed for this duty by the director of the Geological
Survey, | by the director of the Bureau of Ethnology, others by the
Commission of Fisheries, and by the Secretary of the Navy, two being
volunteers. It may be stated here that these details are in every instance
made in the interests of co-operation by those bureaus of the Govern-
ment engaged in work closely connected with that of the Museum. The
paleontologists of the Geological Survey find it so much to-their advan-
tage to have access to the paleontological collections of the Museum,
and the use of the laboratories, storage cases, and general administra-
tive machinery of the Museum, that they are permitted by their chief
to assume the responsibilities of curatorships and perform a general
work of supervision. In the same way it is with the mineralogist and
the ethnologist detailed. In nearly every case, however, the Museum
supplies the honorary curators with assistants, who relieve them of much
of the routine work. The curatorships are now organized as follows:

I. Arts and Industries.—The Assistant Director acting as curator,
with sub-curatorships as follows: A. Howard Clark, assistant; two pre-
parators. ; :

a. Materia medica: Dr. H. G. Beyer, U.S. N., honorary curator, with
one clerk.

b. Textile industries: Romyn Hitchcock, acting curator.

e. Fisheries: R. Edward Earll, curator.

d. Animal products: R. Edward Earll, acting curator.

e. Naval architecture: Capt. J. W. Collins, United States Fish Com-
mission, honorary curator.

-f. Foods: W. O. Atwater, acting curator.

In this department, it may be stated, is administered very much of
the material usually arranged by museums in their ethnological series,
and the curator of ethnology is consequently acting as adjunct curator
in arts and industries.

Il. Ethnology.—Dr. Otis T. Mason, curator, with one preparator and
two clerks.

Ill. Antiquities —Dr. Charles Rau, curator; E: P. Upham, assistant.

IV. American Prehistoric Pottery—W. H. Holmes, Bureau of Etb-
nology, honorary curator; Dr. Edward Foreman, assistant; one prepar-
ator.

V. Mammals.—Frederick W. True, curator; one clerk; two prepar-
ators.

VI. Birds—Robert Ridgway, curator; Dr. Leonard Stejneger, assist-
ant; one clerk and one preparator.

VII. Birds’ Eggs.—Capt. Charles Bendire, U. S. A., honorary cura-
tor (volunteer), and one clerk.

VIIL. Reptiles and Batrachians.—Dr. H. C. Yarrow, honorary cura-
tor (volunteer).
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

IX. Fishes.—Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, curator; Peter Parker and B.A.
Bean, assistants, detailed from United States Fish Commission.

X. Comparative Anatomy.—Frederick W. True, curator; F. A. Lucas
assistant; one preparator.

XI. Mollusks.—W. H. Dall, United States Geological Survey, curator;
Dr. R. E. C. Stearns, adjunct curator; one clerk.

XII. Insects —Dr.C. V. Riley, honorary curator (volunteer).

XII. Marine Invertebrates —Richard Rathbun, curator; L. H. Bald-
win, assistant, and one clerk. detailed by the United States Fish Com-
mission.

XIV. Invertebrate Fossils, Paleozic.—C. D. Walcott, United States
Geological Survey, honorary curator.

XV. Invertebrate Fossils, Mesozoic and Cenozoic.—Dr. C. A. White,
United States Geological Survey, honorary curator; J. B. Marcou,
United States Geological Survey, honorary assistant.

XVI. Plants, Fossil and Recent.—Lester F. Ward, United States Geo-
logical Survey, honorary curator; one clerk; one preparator.

XVII. Mineralogy.—Dr. F. W. Clarke, United States Geological Sur-
vey, honorary curator; W.S. Yeates, assistant.

XVIII. Lithology and Physical Geology—George P. Merrill, acting
curator; one preparator.

XIX. Metallurgy and Economic Geology. —Fred. P. Dewey, curator; J.
A. Allen, assistant.

Division of Administration.

The Division of Administration consists of fifteen departments, the
organization of which has been described at length in previous reports.
A number of additional preparators have been employed for special
work upon the collections for the New Orleans Exposition, and an un-
usual quantity of objects for the exhibition series has been completed
during the year in the workshops, as is shown in the review of the op-
erations of the scientific departments. Specially noteworthy among
these is a number of gigantic photographic enlargements representing
thirteen of the Government buildings in Washington. These are the
largest prints ever made, and have been found particularly effective at
New Orleans and Cincinnati, it being thought that in an exhibition of
the work of the Government Departments, such as has been attempted
this year by the United States Executive Board, it was particularly ap-
propriate that the public buildings of Mshieton should be shown in
an impressive manner.

In addition to the regular administrative staff of the Museum, an ad-
ministrative staff for exhibition work has been maintained since July,
1882, under the general charge of the Assistant Director. Mr. R. Ed-
ward Earll is the executive officer, and Mr. W. V. Cox financial clerk of
this staff, which is increased from time to time as occasion requires by
the employmentof extra clerks and preparators, and to which also, when
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 57

necessary, are detailed various officers of the Museum scientific staff.
In addition to the-exhibition work of the year elsewhere referred to, this
staff is still engaged in the preparation of a report upon the Interna-
tional Fisheries Exhibition at London.

Depariment of Ethnology.—Prof. Otis T. Mason, having been appointed
curator, took charge of this department on the lst of July and spent
the remainder of-the year chiefty in getting control of his material. All.
of the ethnological specimens of the Museum are now under complete
management, a part of them being on exhibition, the remainder classi-
fied and stored in drawers for ready reference. During the year, 3,658
specimens belonging to primitive races have been received. In addi-
tion to these, this department has been intrusted with many objects
registered in other catalogues and deposited here for the sake of com-
pleting evolutionary series of implements, processes, and art products.
The most noteworthy accessions in 1884 were as follows: [Illustrations
of Eskimo and Indian life from Ungava Bay and vicinity, by Lucien
M. Turner, who will prepare a monograph upon the specimens; illas-
trations of Eskimo life at Point Barrow, collected by Lieutenant Ray,
U.S.A. Mr. Murdoch will describe these: rich collections from the
Eskimo of Western and Southern Alaska, by E. W. Nelson, W.J. Fisher,
Charles L. McKay, Baron Nordenskiold ; specimens of the arts of the
tribes of Northwest America, collected by J. G. Swan and Lieut. T. Dix
Bolles; many objects illustrative of the modern Indians of Yucatan, by
Louis H. Ayme; a very large and instructive collection of objects from
the Peruvian huacas, by George W. Keifer and Dr. William H. Jones,
U.S. N.; acollection of weapons, &c.,from New Guinea, purchased from
A. P. Goodwin; an exchange series of weapons from Polynesia, con-
tributed by Charles Heape. During the year illustrative series of eth-
nological objects have been exhibited at Cincinnati, Louisville, and New
Orleans, care being taken in each case to impress some ethnological
truth, such as distribution of types, the effect of environment, the treat-
ment of the same art by different tribes, or the progress of an art from
its infancy to its highest manifestation.

Department of Antiquities—Dr. Rau reports 3,956 specimens added
to the exhibition and study series and 1,185 to the duplicates. They
are in numerous accession lots, of which 18 were sufficiently important
to merit especial notice. An extensive educational series, illustrating
American-archeology, was prepared for the New Orleans Exposition.
Lhe collection now comprises 45,252 specimens, of which 8,522 are in the
duplicate bins.

Department of Mammals.—N otwithstanding the absence of the curator,
Mr. True, in Europe during the first quarter of the year, and other diver-
sions of his attention and time to routine work not connected with his
regular duties, the progress of this department has been exceedingly sat-
jsfactory. The work upon the exhibition series has been hampered by
the fact that money was not avaiable for the construction of the desired
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

cases in the mammal hall. The collection is now, for the first time in
many years, thoroughly classified and under control, and the total
number of skins and alcoholic specimens is reported to be 5,694, and of
skulls and skeletons 4,214, making a total of 9,908. The accessions of
the year have, in number, variety, and importance, been fully equal to
those of earlier periods. No less than 58 specimens, including such rare
and peculiar forms as the eland, harnessed-antelope, cheetah, two spe-
cies of lemur, wart-hog, and baboons, have been received from the pro-
prietors of zoological garaens and menageries, for which due acknowl-
edgments are made in the Museum report. An unusual number of
cetaceans and seals, many of great novelty and interest, have come in
from various sources. The amount of taxidermic work accomplished
has been unusually great, owing to a special allotment for the employ-
ment of extra help, made from the appropriation for the New Orleans
Exhibition—149 specimens in all having been added to the mounted
series, including several large forms, such as the buffalo, puma, jaguar,
and beaver.

Department of Birds —Mr. Ridgway reports that the year has been
unprecedented in the extent of the accessions and the amount of worle
accomplished. The number of birds added during the year is 8,142,
2,658 having been distributed. The collections have been entirely re-
arranged and the exhibition series is receiving a complete overhauling.
Over 1,200 skins have been mounted, and copy for 1,000 species labels
have been sent to the printer. The total number of specimens in the
reserve series is now 50,350, 6,800 of which are in the exhibition series.
Very much of the inereased activity of the year was due to the stimulus
of preparation for the New Orleans Exhibition and the aid received from
this appropriation. About 500 birds were sent to New Orleans, consti-
tuting a complete representation of American game birds.

Department of Birds’ Eggs.—During the year the collections have been
overhauled and thoroughly rearranged by Capt. Charles Bendire, U.S.
A., who has incorporated with it his own collection, including nearly
8,000 specimens, the finest in the United States, which he has presented
to the Museum. This collection now represents pretty nearly all that
is known of American odlogy, and contains 40,072 specimens, of which
4,272 are toreign.

Department of Reptiles and Batrachians.—Comparatively little has been
lone in this department, owing to the absence of Dr. Yarrow on a col-
lecting expedition in Utah during the summer months, which he has in
former years devoted to volunteer work upon the collections.

Department of Fishes —The work upon this great collection has made
fine progress during the year. The curator, Dr. Bean, has nearly com-
pleted his card catalogue of the reserve series, and during the summer
Prof. D. S. Jordan was employed, in the interest of the New Orleans
Exhibition, in selecting a special exhibition series to include all the
fresh-water fishes of the United States, and to make a special collect:
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

ing trip through the Mississippi Valley, with the view to supply such
species as were lacking in the collection. This trip has been of great
importance to the science of ichthyology, bringing to light very many
important facts concerning the fishes of aregion not previously explored
ichthyologieally, and throwing much light upon the whole subject of
distribution. Out of the 560 fresh-water species known to inhabit North
America, the Museum now has all but 49, 30 having been added by this
trip, and some 25 new species having been brought to light. The ac-
cessions to this department have been very important, especially those
from the Fish Commission; at least twenty new fishes from the deep-
sea fauna having been brought in as a result of the work of the Alba-
tross.

Department of Comparative Anatomy.—A department of comparative
anatomy is being organized, and the east-south rauge has been filled up
with a very beautiful set of cases, especially constructed for the recep-
tion of the preparations. Mr. Lucas, with his two assistants, has been
engaged, during the latter part of the year, in mounting skeletons, and
fully 150 fine preparations have been put on exhibition. The report of
Mr. True upon the plan of organization will not be presented until next
year, since much preparatory work remains to be done. A case illus-
trating the work in this department was sent to the New Orleans Expo-
sition.

Department of Mollusks.—Mr. W. H. Dall, who has for many years
had charge of the collection of mollusks, having been appointed one of
the paleontologists of the Geological Survey, and assigned to the de-
partment of Quaternary mollusks, has, by the request of the Director of
the Survey, been assigned working rooms in the Smithsonian building,
and will continue to care for the department as heretofore, access to the
collections of recent shells being necessary for comparison with the
shells of the Quaternary beds, which are, for the most part, specifically
identical. Prof. R. E. C. Stearns, late of the University of California,
has been assigned to this department as adjunct curator, and since the
first of July there has been great activity in rearranging the collections.
It was decided to make an extensive display of the mollusks of the
United States at the New Orleans Exposition, and the well-known
Stearns collection of mollusks, for which negotiations had been in prog-
ress for some years, was purchased from the exhibition appropriation.
Dr. Stearns had in charge the preparation of the series for New Orleans,
which occupied his time from July until the end of the year. This oc-
cupied twenty large cases, and exhibits the economic mollusks of both
coasts and the adjacent seas, and the fresh-water mussels, which form
so remarkable a part of the fauna of the great Mississippi basin. Mr.
R. Ellsworth Call has been employed for six months in connection with
the New Orleans work, and by the efforts of these three conchologists,
with the help of two clerks, much progress has been made toward getting
under final control the immense mass of material in this department.
60 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Department of Insects.—Prof. C. V. Riley has, as in previous years,
voluntarily assumed the care of the entomological material which has
come in, and his own valuable and constantly increasing collection re-
mains a deposit in the Museum. A collection of insects injurious to
forest trees, mounted in Museum eases, in the style which it is pro-
posed by Professor Riley to adopt in the arrangement of cur exhibition
series when the opportunity comes, was sent to the International For-
estry Exhibition in Edinburgh and received a gold medal. Fifty-five
accession lots were received during the year, the most valuable being
the collection made by L. M. Turner at Ungava Bay, H. B.T. It is
hoped that the financial condition of the Museum will soon warrant the
placing of this very important and long-neglected department upon a
footing of equality with the others.

Department of Marine Invertebrates.—In the Department of Marine
Invertebrates, exclusive of the Mollusca, under the charge of Mr. Rath-
bun, 240 cases of specimens, enumerated in 72 accessions, have been
added during the year. Of these, the most important have been re-
ceived from the United States Fish Commission, from Dr. Edward Pal-
mer, a collector employed in the interest of the New Orleans Exhibition,
and from various naval sources. The Fish Commission collections are
mainly illustrative of the recent deep-sea explorations of the steamer
“Albatross” off the eastern coast of the United States and in the Gulf of
Mexico and Caribbean Sea, and contain many new additions to science,
which have been worked up only in part. They fill several thousand
jars and vials. The collection of Dr. Palmer was made for the purpose
of representing at the World’s Fair, in New Orleans, the varied animal
resources of the coral reef and sponge regions of Southern and West-
ern Florida. It consisted for the most part of finely prepared specimens
of commercial and other sponges, ornamental corals, and the larger spe-
cies of Crustaceans and Mollusks used as food, and required 65 large
shipping cases to transport it to Washington. Supplemental to this is
an extensive collection made by Mr. Henry Hemphill on the western
coast of Florida.

Among the more interesting of the naval contributions are several
collections of Crustaceans and Echinoderms, obtained by Dr. W. H.
Jones, U.S. N., in different parts of the Pacific Ocean. A number of
valuable collections, carefully identified, have also been received from
competent European authorities, and will be of great service in the
elaboration of new materials contained in the Museum.

The increase of accessions to this department has been so great dur-
ing the year, especially by reason of the material furnished by the
Fish Commission, that, even with the aid of three or four assistants,
little more could be done than to take care of the new material.

Department of Invertebrate Fossils (Paleozoic).—The collections of this
department are arranged in 15 unit table cases and in office trays equiv-
alent in capacity to as many more. Mr. Walcott estimates the total num-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

ber of specimens at 25,000, including the old Smithsonian collections and
the accessions from the recent Government surveys and other sources
‘up to the present time. The most important accession of the year is
that of Devonian and Carboniferous fossils from the United States
Geological Survey, many of them types of new species, and forming the
basis of Mr. Walcott’s recent “‘ Paleontology of the Eureka District,
Nevada.”

Department of Invertebrate Fossils (Mesozoie and Cenozoic).—The ac-
cessions of the year consist of 85 boxes from the Geological Survey,
embracing collections made in California, Oregon, New Jersey, Florida,
Alabama, and Mississippi, and 15 miscellaneous lots sent from private
sources to the Museum. The catalogye entries number 1,158. From
this department, as from many others, there comes a request for more
room. These requests we are striving to grant as rapidly as the ap-
propriation for the construction of cases will allow, but it is doubtful if
the necessities of the case can be fully met until a new building can be
put up.

Department of Plants, Fossil and Recent.—The collection of fossil plants
pow contains 923 distinct species identified and installed. The report
of Professor Ward contains elaborate statistics of the collection, from
which it appears that 7,291 specimens have already been catalogued.
The accessions of the year have been of but slight importance. The
Joad collection of receut plants has not yet been unpacked, owing to
lack of room, but will soon be arranged and in proper condition for
study. During the year Mr. William R. Smith, superintendent of the
Government Botanic Garden, has placed in the rotunda of the new
building a number of very beautiful palms, which add very much to the
attractiveness of the apartment, and which, being selected with refer-
ence to their economic importance to man, wili, when labeled, furnish
instruction as well as pleasure to the visitors.

Department of Lithology and Physical Geology.—Mr. Merrill reports a
total number of entries amounting to 2,541, including not less than 3,000
specimens administered upon during the year. Prominent among the
accessions is a series of rocks and tufas from Utah, Nevada, and Cali-
fornia, collected by Mr. I. C. Russell and transferred by the Geological
Survey, and a large collection of building stones from John 8. F. Batchen.
Mr. Merrill prepared a large and important series of specimens for the
New Orleans Exhibition, and in this work had the efficient assistance of
Mr. L. H. Merrill, and the services of a number of stone-cutters for some
months.

Some remarkably beautiful colored photographic enlargements on
' glass, illustrating the structure of twelve selected types of rocks, were
among the most striking products of the year’s work in Mr. Merrill’s
laboratory; also a series of colored sketches showing the appearance of
various kinds of building stones used in architectural work. The col-
lections sent to New Orleans included a type collection of the building
62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and ornamental stones of the United States, comprising 358 specimens,
an educational series of rocks, containing 500 specimens, a very interest-
ing structural series of rocks, and a collection of rock-forming minerals.
In addition to all this work, 1,557 descriptive labels were printed and
200 thin sections of rock prepared. The collection as it now stands is
described by Mr. Merrill as follows:

The total number of specimens in the reserve series is not less than
15,000, of which some 3,000 are now on exhibition. Of these, 4,246 are
building or ornamental stones, 1,658 of which are on exhibition. The
number of specimens in the duplicate series will probably increase the
total to 18,000.

Department of Minerals.—Prof. ¥. W. Clarke, chief chemist of the Gev-
logical Survey, continues to act as curator, Mr. W.S. Yeates having the
‘collections in immediate charge. During the year, the growth of the col-
lections has been steady and encouraging, the work of installing the col-
lections has been definitely begun, and a system of exchanges has been .
fairly inaugurated. Mr. Joseph Willcox has deposited his private col-
lection, consisting of some 1,400 specimens, which is, in some respects,
one of the finest in America. Mr. J. T. Abert has given the valuable col-
lection of his father, Col. J. J. Abert, containing 1,245 specimens. An
allotment of $2,500 from the New Orleans appropriation was devoted
to building up the collection of gems and ornamental stones. The
schedule adopted included all the gems proper, rock crystal, agates aid
jaspers, malachite, lapis lazuli, &c., and every important gem or orna-
mental species was secured both in the rough and cut conditions.
About 1,000 specimens are on exhibition at New Orleans, of which
nearly one-third are cut and polished stones. <A part of this collection
was exhibited at Cincinnati, where it was awarded a silver medal. In
connection with the New Orleans work, two important collecting trips
were made by Mr. Yeates, to Northern New York and the Hot Springs
of Arkansas. The total number of specimens in the collection is esti-
mated at 15,288.

Department of Metallurgy.—Owing to the absence of Mr. Dewey in

_ New Orleans, no report upon his work can be given. It may be stated,
however, that a large force has been at work during the entire year,
with very satisfactory results in the way of reducing to order the great
mass of material, the accumulation of many years. Since July, Mr.
Dewey and his staff have been preparing the New Orleans collection,
having an allotment of $5,000 wherewith to illustrate the metallic re-
sources of the country, and, by the aid of a number of volunteer assist-
aunts in the field, the collection has received accessions of very great
value, which make it one of the most important metallurgical collections
in the world.

Increase of the Museum.—The accessions are described in detail in the
reports of the Assistant Director and Curators of the Museum, and are
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

also referred to in the discussion of the explorations carried on during
the year by the’ Smithsonian and affiliated organizations.

Exposition Work.—The participation of the Smithsonian Institution,
as directed by Congress in three exhibitions, has, although in many
respects detrimental to the growth of the Museum, contributed largely to
the prosperity of several of its departments. In the first place, in order
that material might properly be selected for exhibition, it was found nec-
essary in many departments of the Museum to employ additional assist-
ants in making a thorough overhauling of the material and getting it
_ systematically arranged. In the second place, it was found necessary
to purchase a considerable amount of material to fill vacancies in the
various series. of specimens which were shown at the exhibitions. It
has been our-policy to expend the appropriation for the New Orleans
Exposition in such a manner that there also might result a perma-
nent benefit to the Museum. This we have found to be entirely con-
sistent with the interests of the exhibitions, since the material which
is useful for these temporary displays is even more useful for the per-
manent exhibition series of the Museum. At the same time, in many
of the departments, an effort has been made in selecting specimens for
the expositions, to make use of duplicate material from the Museum, in
order that, should we be called upon in future to participate in other
exhibitions, the preparation of a collection can be effected with less ex-
pense of time and money than has been heretofore practicable.

I can, at present, only present a brief preliminary report upon what
has been done in connection with the exhibitions at Cincinnati, Louis-
ville, and New Orleans.

By direction of Congress the Smithsonian Institution, in connection
with the Executive Departments of the Government and the Depart-
mentof Agriculture, has taken part during the year in three industrial
exhibitions—the “ Cincinnati Industrial Exposition,” at Cincinnati, open
from September 3 to October 4; the ‘‘Southern Exposition,” at Louis-
ville, open from August 16 to October 25, and the *“* World’s Industrial
and Cotton Centennial Exposition,” at New Orleans, which opened on
December 16, and will not close until June 30 of the present year. Out
of $300,000 appropriated to the Government executive board for the
New Orleans Exhibition, the Smithsonian received $75,000, and of the
_ $10,000 for the boards participating at Louisville, and a like sum for
Cincinnati, the allotment to the Smithsonian was $5,000—$2,500 for
Louisville and $2,300 for Cincinnati. The conduct of the displays on the
part of the Government was intrusted to an executive board appointed
by the President of the United States, of which Col. 8S. C. Lyford, U.S.
A., was designated president. Mr. G. Brown Goode was nominated
by me and appointed by the President member of this board on behalf
ofthe Smithsonian Institution, National Museum, and Fish Commission.

The passing of the appropriation bill was so loug delayed that when
the money finally became available, only two weeks’ time remained be-
64 REPORT OF TUE SECRETARY.

fore it was necessary to have the collections for Louisville packed and
on the way. We were, ther elon, unable to make a very extensive ex-
hibit at that place.

The special features of the exhibit were a large collection showing
the uses of animals, a collection of textile fibers and fabrics, a series of
the game and water birds of North America, a small collection of boat
models, including the whale-boat and the Chinese junk, a collection of
casts of reptiles, and a large number of photographs illustrative of the
methods employed in the fisheries.

The exhibit was packed in ninety-six boxes of various sizes.

The Cincinnati Exposition opened two weeks later, and it was there-
fore possible to make a more creditable display. A special building
was erected for the Government exhibit, one end of which was assigned
to the Smithsonian Institution. In addition to a collection similar to
that sent to Louisville there was prepared for the Cincinnati Exposition
a fine collection of gems, and also an exhibit representative of the eth-
nology of the North American Indians and Eskimos. Several large
casts of cetaceans were also displayed.

It was found necessary to have most of the Louisville and Cincinnati
collections returned to Washington to be prepared and rearranged be-
fore sending them to New Orleans.

By virtue of an Executive order of May 13, 1884, a board, consisting
of a representative of each Government Department and of the Smith-
sonian Institution, was appointed and charged with making arrange-
ments for a display of collections illustrating the resources of the
United States at the World’s Industrial and Cotton Centennial Expo-
sition to be held at New Orleans. The appropriations for this purpose
were not made until July 7, leaving only four clear months for the
preparation and shipment of collections. . Several of the curators were
at once sent into the field with the authority to add to the collections
under their charge. By December 1, the collections were ready for
transmission, but the opening had been deferred from December 1 to
December 16. On this date the Exposition was formally opened.

The preparations for this Exposition were very much more elaborate
than had been possible in the case of the Louisville and Cincinnati Ex-
positions. The main feature of the display made by the Institution at
New Orleans was, of course, understood to be in illustration of the
animal and mineral resources and the ethnology of the United States,
similar to that made by the Institution in 1876 at Philadelphia. In
addition to this a collection illustrating the textile industries of the
world was prepared, in view of the fact that the main interest of the
New Orleans Exposition centered in one of the textile materials, and
also a Selection of objects from the Department of Naval Architecture.
The curators of eleven departments were requested to take part in the
preparation of the New Orleans exhibit, and most of them were tempo-

rarily placed upon the exhibition staff. The character of the work
undertaken by them may be briefly sketched as follows:

The participation of the Zoological and Geological Departments has
been referred to in the review of the work of the several departments,
and will not be repeated here.

Department of Arts and Industries.—Mr. Romyn Hitchcock undertook
the preparation of a collection of textile fibers and fabrics. Portions
of this collection were exhibited both at Louisville and Cincinnati.
Capt. J. W. Collins prepared a series of working models illustrating the
development of the ship-building industry in the United States, and
especially the evolution of the American schooner, the American pilot-
boat, and the American cotton-ship. A number of full-rigged models
were also sent in this connection, being exhibited on the way at Louis-
ville and Cincinnati. The model of a whale-boat, fully equipped with
all appliances for the capture of whales, was also sent. This model at-
tracted much attention at the London and Berlin Iisheries Exhibitions.

The animal products collection, which was so prominent a feature in
our exhibition at Philadelphia, was reorganized and greatly extended,
so that it now represents very thoroughly the applications of animals
to the uses of mankind in all parts of the world. This collection alone,
if arranged in table-cases, would occupy a floor space equivalent to that
in one of the large halls of the new Museum building. The Museum
has received many important gifts for this collection on condition that
they be exhibited in New Orleans before being finally placed in the
Museum.

The Section of Fisheries was represented by about sixty of the large
pictures prepared for the London Exhibition, and by about two hun-
dred casts of American food fishes, which also had direct relation to
the animal products collection just referred to. It was not deemed
expedient to dismantle the general fishery collections so recently in-
stalled, for such a temporary interest as that of these exhibitions. The
United States Fish Commission made preparations for a considerable
display of fish-culture, and a representative collection of fish-cultural
apparatus was sent from the Museum.

A selection of about two hundred and fifty of the celebrated autotypes
published by Adolph Braun & Co., of Dornach, was acquired for dis-
play. This collection illustrates the history of painting from the time
of Cimabue and Giotto, including from one to six copies of the best rep-
resentative works of each celebrated master, so far as it was practicable
to obtain them. This collection can be packed in a very small space,
and is particularly well suited for sending away to exhibitions. It may
in the future be somewhat extended to very good advantage.

Department of Ethnology.—There were sent to New Orleans about two
hundred and fifty unit boxes, containing a representative collection of
American ethnological objects. These were very largely selected from
the duplicates in the Museum and are available for future exhibition,

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

The prosecution of ethnologic researches among the North American
Indians, under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution and in compliance with act of Congress, was continued during
the year 1884, under the charge of Maj. J. W. Powell, who has furnished
the following account of operations.

They may be conveniently reported upon under the two general heads
of Field Work and Office Work, the latter to a large extent being the
supplement to and discussion of the former, and executed by the same
officers, who had previously obtained materials and information in the
field.

1. Field Work.

This heading may be divided into, Ist, Mound Explorations; 2d,
Collections from Ancient and Modern Stone Villages; and, 3d, General
Field Studies, embracing those in Institutions, Linguistics, and other
divisions of Anthropology.

Mound Explorations.—The work of exploring the mounds and other
ancient monuments of our country, begun in 1882, was carried on dur-
ing the year 1884, under the charge of Prof. Cyrus Thomas.

The same persons, viz, Mr. P. W. Norris, Mr. James D. Middleton,
and Dr. Edward Palmer, who had been engaged during the previous
year, were retained as the regular field assistants, but Dr. Palmer ceased
to be connected with the work after the 30th of June, being then suc-
ceeded by Mr. John P. Rogan.
68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Mr. Norris was engaged duting the latter part of the winter and most
of the spring in Arkansas, then returned to Kanawha Valley, West
Virginia, where he was occupied in exploring the extensive group of
works in the vicinity of Charleston until December, when he was com-
pelled by the cold weather and sickness to desist. To the great regret
of all his associates in the work, his sickness terminated in death a few
days after the close of the year. By his death the division has lost a
faithful and enthusiastic worker.

His explorations in Kanawha Valley brought to light the fact that
here is one of the most extensive and interesting groups of works in
the United States. Although the exploration of this group is not yet
complete, it is sufficient to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that
the people who constructed the works of this locality built the Grave
Creek mound, or were intimately related to the authors of that noted
tumulus. There are also found some strong indications that they were
related to the authors of the ancient works of the Scioto Valley.

Mr. Middleton continued operations in Arkansas until the approach
of summer, assisted for some of the time by Mr. L. H. Thing. During
the remainder of the summer, the fall months, and until the approach
of extreme cold weather, he was engaged in exploring the works of
Knox County, Ohio. Since that time his field of operations has been
Arkansas.

Dr. Palmer was engaged, during the six months of the year he
remained with the division, chiefly in Alabama, and in Early County,
Georgia.

Previous to his appointment as permanent assistant Mr. Rogan was
employed in Northern Georgia, principally in exploring the celebrated
Etowah group in Bartow County. This examination brought to light
some of the most remarkable mound relics so far discovered in the
United States. These consist of very thin, evenly wrought sheets of
copper, on which are impressed, as regularly as though done with me-
tallic dies or by means of machinery, figures bearing strong resem-
blance to the Mexican and Central American designs. The conditiens
under which these were found leave no doubt that they were placed in
the mounds when they were built, and not subsequently. Here also
was found part of a stone bust of nearly life size, and the broken arm of
another stone image, also but little less than life size.

During the latter part of the summer and until the beginning of win-
ter, Mr. Rogan was engaged, in connection with the Rev. J. P. Mac-
Lean, in examining and exploring the ancient monuments of Butler
County and adjacent regions of Southern Ohio.

Mr. Charles Smith was employed during the month of November in
examining the ancient quarries of “ Flint Ridge,” Ohio, and making col-
lections to illustrate the various stages in the aboriginal manufacture
of flint implements, The collection made is, perhaps, the most com-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

plete in this particular line of any single one so far made in this coun-
try.

During the year nearly five thousand specimens were collected. The
data obtained bearing on the questions relating to the origin and uses
of the ancient monuments of North America, and the habits, customs,
and culture-status of the people who constructed them, are very impor-
tant, and will throw much additional light on these interesting prob-
lems. The number of whole and uninjured vessels of clay collected
by Messrs. Middleton, Thing, and Norris is much larger than that of
the preceding year, and is very valuable on account of the new and un-
usual types obtained. The collection of copper implements and orna-
ments is also large and valuable.

Although the pottery obtained by Dr. Palmer in Early County,
Georgia, is in fragments, it is of special value, as it serves, when com-
pared with that of the region of Flint River and other sections, to show
that this southern region was occupied by a people varying, in some
respects at least, from those of the other portions of the South.

Collections from Stone Villages.—Ethnologie and archeologic re-
searches among the Pueblo Indians, and ancient ruins in the south-
western Territories, were extensively prosecuted during the year. Mr.
James Stevenson, in charge of a party, proceeded to Arizona and New
Mexico to examine special localities and make collections of objects
illustrating the arts and industries of the Indian tribes of that region.
The labors of this party resulted in a collection of about eight thousand
five hundred specimens of pottery, stone, and other domestic implements,
both ancient and modern, representing nearly all phases of life, art, and
industry among those tribes. A portion of Mr. Stevenson’s party, in
charge of Mr. I’. D. Beckford, made explorations among the ruins of
Chaco Cafion in Northwestern New Mexico, Canon de Chelly and some
of its branches, the cliff dwellings in Walnut Caiion in Arizona, and a
group of cave dwellings near Flagstaff in the same Territory, the re-
sults of which are full notes, sketches, and photographie illustrations
of the ruins examined. The remainder of this party was divided ; one
party was stationed at the pueblo of Acoma, in charge of Mr. Garlick,
and the other at Zuni in New Mexico. The party at Acoma made a
collection of about three thousand five hundred specimens, consisting
of pottery and domestic utensils of other material, such as stone, hoca,
bone, wood, and woven fabrics. The collection from the pueblo of
Acoma, though not embracing so great a variety of objects, will, how-
ever, illustrate nearly all the phases of the arts and industrial pursuits
of those Indians.

The collection made at Zui, under Mr. Stevenson’s personal super-
vision, is much larger than any heretofore obtained from that section
of the Southwest, and includes many interesting objects, illustrative
of their out-door ceremonies, such as sacred spring, eave and shrine
worship, also a large number of water-color sketches illustrating many
70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of their sacred dances. About three hundred fetiches were also ob
tained, representing nearly every animal and object held in high esteem
by the Zuiis, e. g., hunting charms, war and prey gods. A series of pho-
tographic views was also made of thesacred springs, wells, monuments,
picture-writings, and shrines of the Zunis, scattered over an area of
about 75 miles in all directions from Zui, and a collection of repre-
sentative specimens of their gods, idols, plume-sticks, and other relig-
ious objects was secured. These collections have already been received
at the National Museum, where they will be arranged, classified, and
described. Full notes, detailing the observations made in the field, as
well as a descriptive catalogue of the collections made, will appear in
a forthcoming report of: the Bureau of Ethnology.

Mr. Victor Mindeleff was, at the beginning of the year, in charge of
a party collecting pottery at Acoma, N. Mex. He secured and shipped
about 1,000 specimens before returning to Washington, in the month
of February. He also made a close architectural survey of the village,
securing such plans and data as were necessary for the preparation of
a detailed model. In August he returned to New Mexico, visiting the
Chaco group of ruined pueblos in order to secure detailed plans, pho-
tographs, and other materials for the preparation of models, spending
about two months in that work. In October he made a survey and
measurements of the large Etowah mound near Cartersville, Ga., pre-
liminary to constructing a model to be added to the mound series of the
Bureau. :

General Field Studies.—In the beginning of 1884 Mr. Frank H. Cushing
undertook systematic explorations of the sacrificial grottoes and votive
shrines of the Zunis in the main and tributary valleys of their pueblos.
In and upon the mesa of Taai ycel lon ne or Thunder Mountain alone,
he found eight of these depositories, three of which proved to be entirely
prehistoric, the others partially so. On the head-lands, both north and
south of Zuni, he traced eleven additional shrines, and near both Pes-
cado and Nutria found others, all rich in ancient remains. More im-
portant than any of these, however, were three caverns, or rock-shelters,
situated in two canons, one some 9 miles east of Zui, the other south-
east and nearer the pueblo by 3 miles. 'Two of these caves were of a
remote date as receptacles, one containing a burial cairn, the other an
extensive accumulation of well-preserved idols of war and rain-gods,
symbolic altar-tablets, sacred cigarettes, long and short prayer-wands,
and numerous samples of textile, cordage, and piume work. The lat-
ter deposit was the more important in that, beside being still used and
held sacred by the Zunis—hence clearly referable to their ancestry—its
contents evidently connected it with the crater and cave-shrines discov-
ered by Mr. Cushing on the Upper Colorado Chiquito in 1881, and de-
scribed in the report of his explorations for that year. As, however, he
was forced to visit these places either in company with Indian compan-
ions or by stealth, he had to leave his rich finds undisturbed.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 1

Pursuing his explorations southward, he discovered, between 20 and
30 miles from the central Zuni valley, not only two caves, containing
sacrificial remains, but also a number of cemeteries of undoubted an-
cient Pueblo Indian origin. These burial places yielded perfect crania
and well-preserved vessels of earthenware, and in all respects save in
extent were identical with those of Arizona examined and reported on
by him during the spring of 1883.

He explains the non-discovery heretofore of Pueblo burial places by
the fact that the primitive house-building Indians, although they at
first practiced burial by interment, must have carried the remains of
their dead (judging by the cemeteries under discussion) to great distances
from their permanent homes; that afterward, when the present methods
of terraced communal architecture (induced by defensive confederations
and productive of conditions and populations rendering such burials
impracticable) began to prevail, ‘‘ water sepulture ” came into vogue.
This was, according to Zuni tradition, performed by cremating the
bodies, then carrying the remains to sacred springs or lagunes into
which they were cast. Mr. Cushing returned to Washington in the
month of May.

Mr. H. W. Henshaw visited California for the purpose of pursuing
_ linguistic studies in the Santa Barbara family of languages. The ra-
pidity with which the tribes of the Southern Californian coast died away
when brought under the sway of the Spanish missions is well known,
and he found only about fifty survivors of the once populous tribes of
this family. Several dialects have become extinct. He visited Monte-
rey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties, and ob-
tained vocabularies of eight distinct dialects of this family, all that now
survive. Los Angeles and San Diego Counties were visited with the
view to determine the limits of the Shoshonian and Yuman families, and
several vocabularies of each family were collected.

Mr. Albert S. Gatschet traveled early in August to Fort Sill, Ind.
T., to study the languages of the Comanche, Apache, and Kaiowa Indians
residing there. He then proceeded to Fort Worth, Tex., where he ob-
tained a large vocabulary, with texts and sentences, of the Lipan lan-
guage, and later to Fort Griffin to obtain similar information from the
Tonkaway Indians. While at the latter place, he obtained from old
YVonkaway Indians a vocabulary of the Karankawa Indians, a tribe said
to have lived over fifty years ago in the vicinity of Matamoros. This
appears to be new to linguistic science. A short list of words was also
obtained of the Handme language, which also appears to belong to an
extinct tribe.

Returning to Fort Sill, Mr. Gatschet obtained further linguistic in-
formation on the Kaiowa language ; and after going to Anadarko, Ind,
T., extensive vocabularies were gained from Kaiowa, Caddo, Yatassi,
and Anadarko Indians, the last two being dialects of the Caddo lan-
guage. At Austin, Tex., historic and linguistic information relating to
‘la . REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Indians of Texas and California was found in the State library. Atthe
close of the year he was still at Saint Charles, La., studying and collect-
ing linguistic material of the language of the Atakapa Indians.

Rey. J. Owen Dorsey visited the Siletz Agency, Oregon, in August,
1884, to gain linguistic and other information respecting the tribes in
that region. When he returned in November, 1884, he brought back
the following vocabularies: Athabascan family: Applegate Creek, Galice
Creek, Chasta Costa, Mikono tunne, Tutu tunne (and Joshua), Yuk-
witce, Sixes, Naltunne tunne, Chetcoe, Smith River, Cal., and Upper
Coquille. Yakonan family: Siuslaw, Umpqua, Alsea, and Yaquina.
Unclassified vocabularies: Takelma or Upper Rogue River, Molluk or
Lower Coquille, Klikitat, Sasti. Total, nineteen vocabularies, ranging
from fifty to three thousand entries, exclusive of phrase and grammatical
notes. He also obtained materials for an account of the social organi-
zation of some of these Indians in villages, which appear to have been
clans, illustrated by rough maps, showing the localities of such villages.
Mr. Dorsey also gained the corresponding Indian names from several
tribes of about sixty vegetal products, specimens of which were brought
to Washington for identification.

Dr. W. J. Hoffman proceeded early in August to Victoria, B. C.,
where a large collection of sketches of Haida totem-posts and carvings
were obtained, in connection with the myths which they illustrated.
At this locality attention was paid to the burial places and osteologic
remains of the nearly extinct Songhish Indians. Meeting with a large
party of Haida Indians at Port Townsend, Wash., he examined a large
number of individuals of both sexes to study and sketch the tattooed
designs with which they were profusely decorated. Definitions and
explanations of these designs were obtained, together with the details
of the process employed in tattooing by the Haidas, as wellas the other
tribes living on Puget Sound, Cape Flattery, ete. <A collection of Es-
kimoan pictographs and ivory carvings were also copied at the museum
ot the Alaska Commercial Company, San Francisco, Cal.

At Santa Barbara, Cal., Dr. Hoffman discovered several interesting
painted records, and examined a number which have not yet been re-
corded. These records are usually found in mountainous country, and
near passes. Similar records were also visited 30 miles northeast of
Los Angeles, Cal., and at Tule Indian Agency, in the deep valleys on
the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, near Porterville. By far the
greatest amount of pictographic material was collected in Owen's Val.
ley, Cal., where a number of series of petroglyphs are scattered over an
arid, sandy desert, the extremes being about 20 miles apart. Although
many of the characters appear to resemble some of the figures drawn
by the Moki of Arizona, the greater number have not as yet been noted
from any other portions of the United States.

During the months of May and June Mr. W. H. Holmes visited
Mexico, and secured much valuable information upon the relative ages
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 73

of the ceramic products of that country. His collection, consisting of
several hundred pieces of ancient ware, has been presented to the Na-
tional Museum.

Dr. H. C. Yarrow spent the months of August and September, 1884,
in the Territory of Utah to prosecute ethnologie inquiries. Several
mounds were carefully examined at Provo, 50 miles south of Salt Lake
City. These did not afford any specimens, but showed the manner in
which the former Indian inhabitants of the Great Salt Lake Valley con-
structed their adobe dwellings. From Provo he proceeded west to a
place known as the “Old Government Ranch,” where an Indian burial
cave was discovered, which for some years had been used by the Gos-
hute Indians, from which the Indian remains were removed. From
here he crossed the southern limb of the American desert and reached
the settlement of Willow Spring, at which point a number of burial
places were discovered, giving results of interest. Thence he went to
Deep Creek, the present home of the band of Goshute Indians, number-
ing about 150 souls; learned from them the meaning of many of their
ceremonies and burial rites, and obtained a collection of articles of na-
tive manufacture. A similar collection with information thereupon was
obtained from the band of Pahvants at Fillmore, Utah.

Mr. Jeremiah Curtin prosecuted studies in Indian philosophy and
folk lore among the Senecas in Missouri, during the month of Febru-
ary, and later from the Shawnee and other Algonkian tribes in Mis-
souri and Indian Territory. In June he visited the Seminole Indians in
that Territory with the same object in view, and in October proceeded
to Redding, Cal., where he continued the collection of myths among
the Nozi Indians.

2. Office Work.

The Director, Maj. J. W. Powell, has continued the work, first, of
classifying on a linguistic basis all the tribes, remaining and extinct, of
North America; second, of establishing their synonomy or the refer-
ence of their many and confusing titles as given in literature and com-
mon usage to a correct and systematic standard of nomenclature; and
third, of the ascertainment and display on a series of charts of the hab-
itat of all tribes when first met by Europeans or subsequent periods
Much progress has been made in this undertaking, recognized as essen-
tial to the proper study of Indian anthropology.

Col. Garrick Mallery was engaged during the year in the continued
study of sig language. A number of important collections of gesture
signs were procured from parts of the United States not before thor-
oughly explored in this respect. Collections of great value were also
obtained from Japan, Asiatic Turkey, and from several of the Polyne-
sian groups. The increased collection of material, with its collation,
indicates that while one system of gesture-speech has long existed
among the North American Indians, it is not to be regarded as one
74 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ormal or absolute language; several groups with their centers of origin
being indicated. Five of these groups appear, from present informa-
tion, to be well defined as follows: First, the Arikara, Dakota, Mandan,
Gros Ventre or Hidatsa, Blackfeet, Crows, and other tribes in Montana
and Idaho. Second, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Pani, Kaiowa, Caddo, Wichita,
Apache of Indian Territory, and other tribes in the Southwest as far as
New Mexico, and possibly portions of Arizona. Third, Pima, Yuma,
Papago, Maricopa, Hualpai (Yuman), and the tribes of Southern Cali-
fornia. Fourth, Shoshoni, Banak, Pai-Uta of Pyramid Lake, and the
tribes of Northern Idaho and Lower British Columbia, Eastern Wash-
ington, and Oregon. Fifth, Alaska, embracing the Southern Innuit,
Kenai (Athabaskan), and the Jakutat and Tshilkaat tribes of the
Thlinkit or Koloshan stock. The gestures of Alaskan tribes present
marked difference to any of the southern tribes.

The gestures still used by the Indians of British Columbia and the
northern part of Vancouver's Island, also by the Iroquois of Canada,
are not at present classed in any group.

In the comparison made between the gesture signs of the several
bodies of speaking men and between those groups and the signs of deaf-
mutes, it appears that variation in form is frequent, while identity of
system is preserved. Not only do many of the particular signs of deaf-
mutes in America differ from those with the same signification in some
countries of Europe, but a similar disagreement is observed among the
several institutions for deaf-mute instruction in the United States.
When the diverse signs are purely ideographic, they are, however, in-
telligible to all persons familiar with the principles of sign expression ;
but when, as frequently occurs, they are conventional, they cannot be
understood without the aid of the context, or without knowledge of the
special convention. The similar instances of diversity among the In-
dian signs are so numerous that a vocabulary confined to the presenta-
tion of a single sign for each of the several objects or ideas to be ex-
pressed would be insufficient and misleading. Variants must be sup-
plied with designation of the several groups using them. There being
no single absolute language, each of the prevalent forms of expression
has an equal right to consideration, without which a vocabulary must
either be limited to a single so-called dialect, or become the glossary of a
jargon. Tor this reason the collation of the gesture-signs of the North
American Indians for scientific examination requires minute care, and
when they are critically compared with the signs of other speaking
men, ancient and modern, and with those of deaf-mutes, the work is
much protracted.

Colonel Mallery has also continued the study of pictographs, and
has prepared for the press a preliminary paper on that subject intended
to guide research and procure collaboration. The collection of picto-
graphs has been largely enriched during the year, especially by the
discovery of six forms of Dakota Winter Counts, which have been col-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

lated with the one form published in the year 1877 by Colonel Mallery,
under the title of “Calendar of the Dakota Nation.” The wide cireu-
lation of his paper on this subject was the means of obtaining the ad-
ditional copies, valuable as a verification and for correction, and also
extending over a longer number of years than the one first published.
The collected Winter Counts now furnish a large amount of ethnologic
information wholly apart from the interest attached to them as calen-
dars. In the whole of these studies Colonel Mallery has been assisted
by Dr. W. J. Hoffman.

Mr. Frank H. Cushing, on his return to Washington in the spring of
1884, renewed his work of the classification of his material obtained in
the field and its preparation for publication. He completed an essay
on the culture-growth of the Zuiis, as illustrated by studies of the
Pueblo pottery, and has prepared a paper on the ancient province of
Cibola, and the Seven Cities, with explanation of the architectural
types in the Southwest, and the social institutions connected with the
several periods of that architecture. He has also arranged his copious
notes on the myths and folk-lore of the Zunis.

The preparation of the Bibliography of North American Linguistics
by Mr. James C. Pilling was continued during the year. There were
received from the printer during the year proof-sheets of pages 839-
1135, and these were distributed to various gentlemen throughout this
country and others for examination and criticism. Among them were
Sefior Joaquin Garcia Icazbalceta, of the city of Mexico; Mr. Wilber-
force Eames, of New York City, and Drs. J. G. Shea, of Elizabeth, N.
J., D. G. Brinton, of Media, Pa., and J. Hammond Trumbull, of Hart-
ford, Conn., from all of whom valuable information was obtained.
During the latter part of October and the early part of November
Mr. Pilling made a brief trip to New England, visiting several libraries
in Boston and Providence for the purpose of clearing up a number of
doubtful bibliographic points.

Mr. H. W. Henshaw was engaged during the earlier part of the year
in assisting the Director in the work of the classification of the lan-
guages of the North American Indians. The large number of vocab-
ularies of Indian languages which have been collected from time to
time, and the recent increased activity in the direction of linguistic
studies, imperatively require that a classification shall be made upon
a more comprehensive and satisfactory basis than has hitherto been
done. The confusion of nomenclature observable in previous classifi-
cations, and the perplexities to the linguistie student resulting there-
from, are universally recognized. Since Gallatin’s classification of 1836
the grouping of linguistic families has undergone great changes at
the hands of successive authors in accordance with conflicting views
held by them, and the families have been named and renamed with
little or no reference to the names previously given. It is believed
that in linguistic as in zoologic classification priority of name is the
76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

only safe rule to follow, and careful examination of all the literature
pertaining to Indian linguistic classification with a view to a deter-
mination of the name first employed for a family, together with care-
fully-compared tables of synonymy, was therefore indispensable. In
the work indicated, Mr. Henshaw prepared a system of tables on the
principle explained, and in connection with them a brief account of the
literature bearing on the subject.

Prof. O. T. Mason finished compiling the census of Indian education
from the time of the foundation of the Government, and collected ad-
ditional material for a grammar and dictionary of the Chahta language.

Mr. W. H. Holmes has been engaged during the year in carrying for-
ward his studies of American ceramics, and has made much progress
in the classification and arrangement of the collection of pottery in the
National Museum. He has also prepared a paper upon the fine collec-
tion of mound pottery in the museum of the Academy of Sciences at
Davenport, Iowa, which will appear in the Fourth Annual Report of
the Bureau. For the same volume, he has completed a paper upon the
origin and development of form and ornament in the ceramie art, with
copious illustrations. Mr. Holmes remains in-charge of the department
of illustrations in the Bureau of Ethnology, as well as in the Geologi-
cal Survey, and has made good progress in elevating the standard of
work. He has also had charge of the preparation of the exhibits of the
Bureau of Ethnology and of the Geologic Survey for the exposition at
New Orleans.

Mr. C. C. Royce continued his examinations into the primal title of
the different Indian tribes to lands within the limits of the United
States, and the methods employed by the United States authorities in
securing from such tribes a relinquishment of their title to such lands.
Special attention was given to compiling the data in connection with
the extinguishment of the Indian title to lands within the present limits
of Oregon, Washington Territory, California, Arizona, New Mexico,
Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Dakota, Texas, Minnesota,
Kansas, and Nebraska. The investigations before commenced in other
States have also been completed, and it is expected that the entire work
will be ready for publication within the year 1885.

Rev. J. Owen Dorsey, when not in the field, made many entries for
an Osage-English dictionary, and for a Kansas-Engiish dictionary, pre-
pared Osage and Kansas native texts with free and interlinear transla-
tions, and entries for the Egiha-English dictionary. He also prepared
articles on Kansas War Customs, and Migrations of certain Siouan
tribes, each one illustrated by charts. A manuscript Musquito diction-
ary was examined and criticised. After December 1, 1884, he collated
the following vocabularies gained in Oregon, viz: Takelma, Sasti, Ap-
plegate Creek, Chasta Costa, Galice Creek, Mulluk, Siuslaw, Umpqua,
Vaquina, Klikitat, and Smith River, California. Healso prepared a list
of the villages obtained from the tribes at the Siletz Agency, Oregon.

Mr. Albert S. Gatschet, before proceeding to the field, as above men-
tioned, was occupied in reading proof of his Klamath dictionary ; the
second or English-Klamath part, and in correcting and largely rewriting
the manuscript of his Klamath grammar from the copious notes made
during the printing of the text and the dictionary.

Mrs. Erminnie A. Smith continued her special study on the different
Iroquoian dialects. The Mohawk words previously translated from
the dictionary of Marcoux were all recopied and their literal meaning
given, as were also over 6,000 words in the Tuscarora dialect. She
also prepared several studies upon pronouns and other parts of speech,
for use in the introduction to her Iroquoian dictionary, which is in course
of preparation.

Dr. H. C. Yarrow, acting assistant surgeon, U.S. A., during the part
of the year in which he was not, as elsewhere reported, engaged in field
work, continued his investigations into the mortuary customs of the
North American Indians; maintaining the large correspondence relat-
ing thereto, and arranging, with a view to publication, the large amount
of material collected by him subsequent to his preliminary paper on the
above-mentioned subject.

Mr. Victor Mindeleff was occupied, when notin the field, in the prep-
aration of a map of Cafion de Chelley and its branches, from the data
obtained in the field during the last season, for the purpose of showing
the relation of the large number of cliff ruins (the plans of which had
been obtained) to the topography of the cations. He also continued the
work of modeling the Moki villages, which had been interrupted by his
field trip, in a series of models illustrating ancient pueblos and cliff
ruins, prepared by him for the New Orleans Exposition.

UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.

Although separate in organization and management, the Smithsonian
Institution and the Geological Survey have enjoyed at all times such
close personal and official relations that it has been customary to in-
clude a summary of the yearly operations of the Survey in the annual
report of the Institution. In pursuance of this custom such a summary,
furnished by Maj. J. W. Powell, the Director of the Survey, is appended
hereto.

The increased appropriation for the Geological Survey for the fiscal
year 1883~84 made improved organization and greater expansion possi-
ble. To the former nothing contributed more than the obtaining of
suitable office accommodations—a want long felt, and finally rendered
imperative by the enlargement of the Survey. Formerly the Director’s
office and executive force were in one place, the quarters of the geolo-
gists and geographers in another, while many divisions that should
have been in Washington under the immediate supervision of the Di-
rector were scattered in remote cities, This unsatisfactory condition
78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of affairs was ended by securing a lease of the Hooe iron building, a
large fire-proof structure on F street, to which the Survey force, with
the exception of the chemists and paleontologists, was removed in Octo-
ber. As this building did not offer laboratory facilities, the chemists
were permitted, through the kindness of the Director of the National
Museum, to occupy the northeast pavilion left vacant by the removal
of the Director’s office, while the paleontologists retained their old rooms
in the Museum, it being impracticable to separate them from their col-
lections, to which constant reference must be made, and which by law
are installed in the Museum. As these gentlemen also serve in the
capacity of honorary curators in the Museum, this arrangement seems
especially appropriate.

Before taking up the specific items of survey work, it is most gratify-
ing to refer to the friendly relation subsisting between the various State
surveys and the Geological Survey, and especially to the active co-oper-
ation of many of the former with the latter in its efforts to include the
whole country in its geologic investigations.

The detailed statements which follow under the heads of Geography,
Geology, Paleontology, Chemistry, Statistics, Publications, and Collec-
tions, indicate satisfactory progress made during the year.

For purposes of general reference it was found desirable to retain the
Divisions of the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Mississippi,
South Mississippi, Rocky Mountains, and Pacific. The Division of the
Great Basin was abandoned, it being necessary to withdraw Mr. G. K.
Gilbert theretrom and place him in charge of the Division of the South
Atlantic. For convenience of topographic reference these large areas
are again subdivided into districts such as ‘‘ New England,” ‘‘Appala-

chian,” &c.
GEOGRAPHY.

In the geographic work of the Survey it is constantly borne m mind
that it is only possible to carry out the intent and purpose of the law
requiring the construction of a geologic map of the United States, by
first preparing an accurate topographic map which can be placed in the
hands of the field geologists. In pursuance of this policy, as soon as
the material of the previous season had been reduced to permanent
form, active preparations were made for field work with an increased
and more effective force. As soon after July 1, as practicable, 27 topo-
graphic parties were organized and took the field under the guidance of
their respective chiefs.

Division of the North Atlantic

New England District.—Encouraged by the topographic work begun
in Massachusetts during the previous season, the legislature of that
comwonwealth appropriated the sum of $40,000 for the further prosecu-
tion of the work in connection with the Geological Survey. In view of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 79

this fact the number of field parties was increased to four. This neces-
sitated greater supervision, and in order that the inauguration of the
survey upon this more comprehensive plan might be made under the
most auspicious conditions, its general management was undertaken by
the Chief Geographer of the Survey, Mr. Henry Gannett. The season’s
work included the counties of Hampshire, Bristol, Norfolk, and Ply-
mouth, and embraces an area of 658 square miles.

New Jersey District.—Under arrangements very similar to those en-
tered into with Massachusetts a survey of New J ersey Was commenced,
and one topographic party, aided by two subordinate parties, was as-
signed to the work. Professor Cook, State geologist, kindly under-
took the direction of this force. With the exception of a small area in
Sussex County all the northern counties had been completed under
State direction. During the field season Sussex was finished and con-
siderable progress made in Monmouth and Ocean Counties. The area
surveyed up to December 31 was 1,082 square miles.

Appalachian District.—During the previous season the chief geogra-
pher of the Survey had given much of his time to the supervision of
the work of his district. His withdrawal to New England made it
necessary to secure the services,of some other competent geographer,
and Mr. Gilbert Thompson was relieved from the direction of the Cali-
fornia district, and placed in charge of the Appalachian. Before the
15th of July the large force assigned to this district was organized
into seven principal parties and field-work commenced. These parties
operated in Eastern Maryland, Northeastern and Southwestern West
Virginia, Western Virginia, Hastern Kentucky, Eastern Tennessee,
Mastern North Carolina, and in Northern Alabama and Georgia. The
total area covered in these States was 17 ,466 square miles. This work
required the construction of between 8,000 and 9,000 square miles of
triangulation and the connection of portions of it with the triangula-
tion of the Coast and Geodetic Survey.

Divisions of the South Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains.

Heretofore topography was undertaken only in the latter division,
but the increased appropriation permitted its extension into the former
also. As Prof. A. H. Thompson had previously been in charge of the
parties in this region the additional territory was also placed under his
Management.

Missouri and Kansas.—One topographic party was sent into each of
these States, and in addition to this an astronomic party took the field
for the purpose of making observations from which to determine the
positions to be used by the topographers as a basis for their work.

In anticipation of the extension of the survey into these States, much

valuable topographic material was compiled from all available sources
before the parties left for the West; and, as in many cases it was only
80 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

necessary to add the elements of relief and culture to the plats, rapid
progress was made. It is estimated that not less than 15,000 square
miles were covered by the two parties during the season. ~*

Texas.—The work in Texas was successfully inaugurated about Au-
gust 1, the chiefs of three parties and their assistants reporting at that
time at Austin, Tex. As no work had heretofore been done in this dis-
trict, the establishment of a base-line and the connection of the trian-
gulation with that of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was necessary.
As it is a region of small details, and this, together with the presence of
much timber and embarrassing atmospheric conditions, made the work
tedious. Nevertheless, the party succeeded in covering an area of
4,000 square miles.

Arizona and Nevada.—Work having been carried on in this region
during previous years, there was but little delay in putting into the
field the three parties—one triangulation and two topographic—assigned
to this district. As this is the region peculiarly favorable to topographic
work, the unusual area of 36,900 square miles was surveyed.

Yellowstone National Park.—The topographic work in the Park re-
mained in the charge of Mr. John H. Renshawe, who, with three parties,
carried forward the survey from the points where it was discontinued at the
close of the last season. One thousand square miles were added to the
area already surveyed, leaving one-half of the Park yet to be completed.
This, however, is a rugged, mountainous district, unfavorable to rapid
work, and it is expected that future progress will be slow. Recent at-
tempted legislation concerning the Park boundaries and the relation
thereto of settlers’ vested rights add interest to this survey.

Division of the Great Basin.

As previously stated, geologic work in this division was discontinued.
A certain amount of topographic work was done, however, by reason of
the extension of the survey across the western boundary of Arizona into
the southern part of Nevada—the object of this extension being to unite
large areas already surveyed.

Division of the Pacific.

Northern California District.—Two parties were sent to California and
placed under the direction of Mr. Mark B. Kerr, who in previous years
had been in charge of parties under Mr. Gilbert Thompson’s direction.
In addition to covering 3,700 square miles, detailed surveys of 375
square miles within this same area were also made.

At the closing of this report all of the field parties were not in, but
sufficient data are at hand upon which to base the close estimate that an
area of nearly 80,000 square miles was surveyed during the year. The
reduction to permanent shape of this material will be taken up by the
different divisions immediately upon their return, and will be completed
before the close of the fiscal year.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 81
GEOLOGY.

For some time it had been the wish of the Director to extend geo-
logic investigation into certain fields which, owing to limited funds, it
had not been possible to study. It is very gratifying to note that at
the beginning of the fiscal year much was accomplished in this direction
by the addition of several eminent geologists to the Survey staff, as
well as by securing the active co-operation of others whose duties would
not admit of their assuming additional obligations. The former will
be mentioned specifically in referring to their respective fields of work;
the latter include such well-known scientists as Professor Hall, of the
Geological Survey of New York; Professor Newberry, of the School of
Mines, Columbia College, New York; Professor Safford, of the Geolog-
ical Survey of Tennessee; and Professor Cook, of the New Jersey State
Survey.

North Atlantic Division.

New England District—The discontinuance of the transcontinental
survey by the Northern Pacific Railroad left Prof. Raphael Pumpelly
free to engage in other lines of work, and his services were secured for
the direction of the investigations to be undertaken primarily in the
Archean formations of the Atlantic slope. The general plan of pro-
cedure will be to take up the investigations in New England and extend
them southward, at the same time carefully studying the many other
problems connected with this region. In pursuance of this plan, pre-
liminary reconnaissances were made in New England towards the close
of the current year.

Prof. N. S. Shaler, of Harvard University, who has given considera-
ble attention to the geology of New England, will be associated with
Professor Pumpelly in this task. Pending the final decision as to the
course to be pursued, Professor Shaler found time, with the aid of vol-
unteer assistants, to study the geologic history of Cape Cod; to con-
tinue his examination of the Narragansett coal fields; to examine criti-
cally 100 miles of the main shore line, obtaining valuable collections of
fossils therefrom; to make observations as to the evidences of recent
shoreline movements; to study the drift-sheet of this region; and to
bestow some attention on the phenomena connected with swamps.

Much information concerning the geology of New Jersey had already
been acquired by Prof. George H. Cook, the State geologist, and the pub-
lication of the material provided for by the State. Under arrangements
with Professor Cook the paleontology of New Jersey is to be published
hereafter by the United States Geological Survey. A reference to the
paragraph on “ Publications” will show that the carrying out of this plan
has been commenced through the publication by theSurvey of Whitfield’s
“Brachiopoda and Lamellibrancbiata.” It has already been noted that
Professor Cook, in addition to his geologic duties, undertook the man-
agement of the mapping of the unsurveyed portions of the State.

82 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
South Atlantic Division.

Appalachian District.—At the time of the withdrawal of Mr. G. K.
Gilbert from the District of the Great Basin, he had in course of prepara-
tion an elaborate memoir, embodying the results of his investigations
concerning the ancient Lake Bonneville and its boundaries, while his
immediate assistant, Mr. Russell, was engaged in the preparation of a
like report upon Lake Lahontan and a paper upon the Mone Basin. For
these many illustrations had been made, and others that were being
drawn required constant supervision. Attention to this material occu-
pied much of Mr. Gilbert’s time, but early in the field season he found
opportunity to make a preliminary study of the structure of the Appa-
lachian system. For this purpose he proceeded, via Lynchburg, Va.,
to Asheville, N.C. From this point a series of excursions were made to
Mount Mitchell, Roan Mountain, and to the valleys of several of the
tributaries of the French Broad. The journey was then continued south-
ward across Tennessee, and as far into Georgia'as Ellijay. While the
object of this trip was the general study of the history of the Appala-
chian system, especial attention was given to that phase of it which is
represented by the ancient base-levels in the mountain valleys. Later
in the season Mr. Gilbert made similar observations upon the terraces
of the valleys of the Passumpsic, Connecticut, and Mohawk, for com-
parative purposes. In the mean time, he sent the assistant geologists,
who had previously acted in this region under the Director’s immediate
instructions, but who were now placed under his direction, to make a
detailed study of the geologic phenomena of the Kanawha Valley, West
Virginia, of the country in the vicinity of the White Sulphur Springs,
and of a portion of the great valley of eastern Tennessee. At the close
of the calendar year satisfactory progress was reported in these several
fields of work.

Division of the North Mississippi.

Glacial District—A summary of what was accomplished by Prof. T.
C. Chamberlin and his assistants shows six months’ of office duty in
connection with the previous season’s material and six months of out-
door work in extending the research into new fields. The first half of
the year was given to the preparation of a paper on ‘ Requisite and
Qualifying Conditions of Artesian Wells,” for the Director’s Fifth An-
nual Report, a report upon gravel deposits, and the collation of the ob-
servations made upon glacial striation. The field work of the last half
of the year included (1) an expansion of the previous studies of the drift-
less area of Wisconsin, Illinois, lowa, and Minnesota; (2) the continua-
tion of previous work in Dakota, more particularly the detailed study
of the moraines of the southern part, and a critical examination of their
relation to other deposits ; (3) the tracing of the outer limit of the north-
ern drift from the point to which it had been previously traced in Indi-
ana westward to the Mississippi River; (4) the study of the terraces of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 83

the Upper Ohio and the hypothetical effects of ice blockage; (5) the
more complete mapping of the osars of Maine, together with a critical
study of their structure, character, and relation; (6) a comparative study
of glaciated and unglaciated Archean knobs which occupy an isolated
position in the Silurian district of Central Wisconsin, and (7) a study of
the northern border of the Missouri Valley loess and its relation to other
members of the Quaternary series, as well as to altitude, topographic
features, and drainage systems.

The tracing of the boundary of the drift and loess was undertaken by
Professor Chamberlin in person. The limit of the drift will be indi-
cated in a manner by the statement that his examination carried him
across Northeastern Illinois, Southern Iowa, Southeastern and Central
Nebraska, as far west as Denver, Colo., thence into the Valley of the
Arkansas southward across Indian Territory to Northern Texas, and
thence eastward across the northern part of Louisiana to the flood-
plains of the Mississippi, and from this point northward through West-
ern Tennessee, Kentucky, and Eastern Missouri. The results of the in-
vestigations of Professor Chamberlin and his assistants will appear
from time to time in the form of monographs and bulletins.

Lake Superior District.—Office work in connection with the investiga-
tions of this division occupied the time of Prof. R. D. Irving and his
assistants until the weather permitted field exploration, which was at
once taken up and continued until nearly the close of the calendar year.
Professor Irving’s line of research lies mainly in the Cambrian and
Archean formations of the Lake Superior region. The assistants under
his direction were employed in the following fields: One was sent to
study the gneisses and granites of the Minnesota Valley, the results to be
used, in connection with data obtained last season, in preparing a bul-
letin on the gneisses and granites of Central Minnesota; another was
sent to the Gogebic Lake country of the northern peninsula of Mich-
igan for the purpose of connecting the Huronian of the Penokee region
of Wisconsin with that of the Marquette and Menominee regions of
Michigan; a third continued the studies previously made in the region
of the national boundary line in the vicinity of Knife Lake, Minne
sota—the object of the investigations being to determine the rela-
tion between the flat lying Animikie and the more northerly folded
schists; a fourth assistant was assigned a large area stretching from
Vermilion Lake, Minnesota, northeastwardly to its juncture with the
region in which the party just referred to operated, while for himself
Professor Irving reserved the necessary supervision of his subordinate
parties; a special study of portions of the Marquette region hitherto
unexplored, and a further examination of the exposures along the
national boundary-line, in the neighborhood of the Lake of the Woods.
The various parties had about completed the tasks assigned them and
returned to the Madison office for the purpose of elaborating the results
of this successful field season, when they had the misfortune to lose
84 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

much of the labor of this and previous years by the fire which occurred
in the Science building of the University of Wisconsin, on the night of
December 1. This conflagration destroyed most of their collections,
instruments, and field equipage; seriously damaged their field-notes,
manuscript text and accompanying illustrations, and a number of excel-
lent field-maps upon which the geology thus far determined had been
laid down, and also ruined a quantity of carefully-prepared micro-sec-
tions. At the time of the fire, Professor Irving and his assistants had
well under way papers upon the following subjects: (1) Observations
on the contact-line between the western sandstones and the copper-
bearing series on Keweenaw Point, to be issued jointly by Professors
Irving and Chamberlin; (2) Notes on the preliminary geologic map of
the region bounded by Lake Superior, the national boundary-line, and
the Saint Louis and Vermilion Rivers; (3) The geology of the region
between Gunflint and Knife Lakes; (4) The geology of the region west
of Knife Lake and lying between the national boundary-line, Vermilion
River, and the Mesabi Range; (5) The Penokee-Gogebic iron-bearing
series, and (6) The cherts, jaspers, and iron ores of the Huronian of
the Northwest. Professor Irving and his assistants at once set about
repairing the damage done by the fire, and while it will be possible to
reproduce much of this material, delay in its publication must neces-
sarily follow.
Rocky Mountain Division.

Montana District—Prof. F. V. Hayden and assistants continued in-
vestigations in Western Montana. The special field of work selected
was the eastern and northern sides of the Gallatin Valley, the west side
of the Bridger’s Range, and the country in the vicinity of the Forks of
the Missouri River. The object of the reconnaissance was the comple-
tion of the section of the Silurian and Cambrian formations which are
so well exposed in this region. In traveling to and from the field of
work a careful examination was made of the springs of Western and
Southeastern Montana, Idaho, and Utah, for the purpose of obtaining
data to be used in connection with the list of mineral springs of the
United States, which is being prepared by Dr. A. C. Peale.

The publication by the Geological Survey of Canada of the results of
investigations in British Columbia enabled Dr. Hayden to ascertain
with more definiteness the relation of the geology of the region being
studied by him to that of the country extending to the northward into
British Columbia.

Yellowstone Park District—By the last of June Mr. Arnold Hague and
assistants completed office-work in connection with the material coi-
lected during the previous season, and were ready to take the field. A
reference to the season’s work in detail shows. that it was only by adopt-
ing a comprehensive pian of procedure and dividing the force up into
small parties that it was possible to make the most of the short field-
season in the Park. <A careful compilation of such observations as had
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 85

been made from time to time upon the geysers enabled Mr. Hague to
institute a more systematic study of the changes and modifications,
Skilled observers were kept in the principal geyser basins, and as far as
possible the more remote and less active thermal springs were visited
and the phenomena connected therewith carefully noted. Two parties,
one of which was under Mr. Hague’s immediate direction, made a pre-
liminary study of the East Gallatin Range, which forms the northwest
boundary of the Park Plateau, and extends from Electric Peak south-
ward to Mount Holmes. Geologically considered, this range is a most
interesting one; every period from the Silurian to the Colorado Creta-
ceous being represented therein. A special study was made of the
Obsidian cliffs, and later in the season the voleanice rocks of the west
shore of the Yellowstone Lake, together with its Quaternary geology,
_ glacial phenomena, and ancient terrace-lines, were carefully worked up.

In connection with the geologic investigations, Mr. Hague also made
a preliminary examination of the region named in the bill before the
Forty-eighth Congress for addition to the Park reservation.

The several parties were compelled by reason of snow-storms to leave
the Park by the middle of October. Upon returning east the force of
this division were removed from their quarters in the American Museum
of Natural History, in New York, to the Survey building, in Washing-
ton.

Colorado District.—During the winter Mr. S. F. Emmons and assist-
ants made further study of the material collected from the Silver Cliff
mining district, and, as soon as the field season opened, topographic
and geologic work was taken up in the Gunnison district. In connec-
tion therewith, and in order that a better understanding might be ob-
tained of the Colorado Paleozoic and Mesozoic, a geologic section was
made along the Arkansas River, in the neighborhood of Salida. The
result of the season’s work will enable the geologists to lay down the
geology of the Gunnison. district upon the map of the region which
was prepared at the same time. As soon as the weather made further
research in these fields impossible, attention was turned to the geologic
phenomena of the Denver Basin, especial attention being given to the
source of the water-supply of its artesian wells. The investigations in
this region, dealing as they do with the mineral-bearing formations,
require a large amount of laboratory and microscopic work, in the course
of which some very interesting discoveries were made as to the oceur-
rence of minerals both in combinations and in localities in which they
were not supposed to exist. Tho results of these investigations of the
minerals of Colorado will appear at a future day in the form of a Bulletin.

District of the Pacific—At the close of the previous annual state-
ment, the investigations of Mr. George I’. Becker and his assistants in
the quicksilver deposits of Sulphur Bank and New Idria, California,
were sufficiently near completion to permit the entering upon new
fields. It was decided, therefore, to take up the study of the Knoxville
86 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

district, and the mines in the vicinity of Steamboat Springs, to be fol-
lowed later by an examination of the cinnabar deposits of Guadaloupe
and New Almaden. The climate of California makes field-work possi-
ble at all times of the year, and Mr. Becker kept in mind the desirability
of not only making a careful study of the surface geology of the area
immediately under investigation, but also of utilizing all trips to and
from the field of work for the purpose of obtaining a thorough knowl-
edge of the general geology of California, and its relation to the quick-
silver deposits. In addition to this, special trips were made whenever
necessary to localities thought to be instructive or furnishing any clue
to the solution of the geologic problems of this region. With such ends
in view, the construction of a geologic section through the Coast Kange
yas undertaken. In view of the extensive studies made by Mr. Becker
and his assistants, and as a check upon their conclusions concerning the
age of the quicksilver-bearing rocks of the Pacific coast, it seemed wise,
before proceeding further, to have some competent paleontologist review
the results obtained by the State survey and such other material as
had been procured recently by Mr. Becker. Dr. C. A. White was as-
signed this daty, and proceeding to California he first made a study
of the Chico, Tejon, and Miocene groups, and then, in company with
Mr. Becker, visited the several mining districts under consideration,
the Cretaceous and Paleozoic formations of Butte County, and certain
other localities on the McCloud River, and in Shasta and Mariposa
Counties. They then proceeded as far north as Eugene City, Oreg.,
for the purpose of examining a large and very instructive collection of
fossils in that city.
Much microseopie and chemice’ work has been accomplished in the
laboratory of this division, in connection with the cinnabar investiga-

tions.
Assistant Geologist Curtis completed his report on the Eureka min-

ing district, and early in the year proceeded to Washington to superin-
tend its publication. When not engaged in this task, his time was de-
voted to experimenting for the purpose of devising improved methods
for determining minute quantities of precious metals in ores.

Voleanic Rocks.—Having nearly completed the manuscript of his
memoir on the Hawaiian volcanoes, Capt. C. EK. Dutton, U. S. A., in
pursuance of his investigations relative to volcanic phenomena, pro-
ceeded to Fort Wingate, N. Mex., in July, for the purpose of making
a thorough examination of Mount Taylor and its vicinity, aregion which
in past time was one of great volcanic activity. Inthe mean time the
investigations previously conducted in the Cascade Range were not for-
gotten, and Assistant Geologist Diller spent the field season in the
neighborhood of Mount Shasta with most gratifying results. An area
embracing 400 square miles was explored; the successive lava-flows
which had taken place from the main crater, as well as from the many
vents upon the slopes of this extinct voleano, were traced; the limits of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 87

the glaciers and the accompanying phenomena were determined wiih as
inuch accuracy as possible, and collections were made which enabled
Mr. Diller to indicate on the map, prepared at the same time by a topo-
graphic party, the distribution of the material forming the successive
flows. A large number of photographie views were also taken, which,
with field-notes and sketches, will be invaluable in setting forth the
geology and topography of this interesting region.

Upon Mr. Diller’s return from the field, a well-equipped petrographic
laboratory was fitted up under his direction in the Survey building,
and an opportunity thus afforded for the microscopic study of the col-
lections of the various divisions. In connection with this laboratory it
was found possible to arrange abundant facilities for the preparation of
micro-sections. Under Mr. Diller’s management most gratifying results
have already been obtained from this much-needed acquisition to the
Survey’s equipment. In the last quarter of the year alone 512 micro-
sections were made.

Coal-fields of the Great Sioux Reservation.—On January 3, the honora-
ble the Secretary of the Interior instructed the Director of the Survey to
have made a geologic survey of the Great Sioux Reservation, for the
purpose of determining the extent and value of such coal-fields as might
be found. It was not practicable to undertake this task until the spring.
At that time the services of Mr. Bailey Willis were secured, and he, with
a party, was sent to Dakota. In addition to the geologic investigations
prosecuted by Mr. Willis, he also superintended the preparation of a
map of 2,000 square miles, embracing all of the area in which it was ex-
pected the so-called coal-fields would be found. Before the close of the
year Mr. Willis had completed his report, and it only awaited the prepara-
tion of the map to be forwarded to the Secretary of the Interior. While
the details of this report cannot be given here, it may be briefly stated
that the coal-beds were found to be confined to restricted areas, and to
be of but little if any value for commercial or domestic purposes.

Geologic map of the United States.—The geologic map commenced in
1883 was completed and placed in the hands of the engraver. It was
found, after, collating all available data, that our knowledge is not suffi-
cient to warrant the extension of geologic colors over the entire territory
of the United States. Accordingly, California, Oregon, and parts of
Montona, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas re-
main uncolored.

This map will be issued in two editions within a few months. The
first edition will be colored in accordance with the scheme previously
adopted and published by the Survey. It will form one of the plates of
the Fifth Annual Report of the Director, and abrief explanatory statement
will accompany it. A second edition, with complete explanatory text,
will be issued as a bulletin. In this edition the map will be printed in
duplicate, one copy colored in accordance with the published scheme
and the other in accordance with a scheme now under consideration. It

The sources of the information incorporated in the map are: first,
published maps, and second, manuscript maps prepared for the Survey
by different official and amateur geologists. As the colors have not
been carried beyond the boundaries of the original maps, this geologic
map may be regarded as an accurate representation of our present
knowledge of the distribution of American rock-groups.

The map, together with the explanatory text, was prepared by Mr.
W J McGee.

Geology of the District of Columbia.

The investigation of the superficial deposits, and the littoral and
fluviatile terraces of the District of Columbia and contiguous territory,
commenced in 1883 by Mr. W J McGee, were continued. A recon-
noissance was extended over an area of 1,000 square miles having the
District of Columbia as its center. In addition, short journeys to the
northward and southward were made for the purpose of correlating the
deposits with those already known in other localities; and, with the
same object in view, the literature of the Orange Sand and Stratified
Drift of the Gulf States, and the glacial “ Quaternary,” and accociated
deposits of the Atlantic States, were studied. In the prosecution of his
work Mr. McGee found it necessary to extend his observations into the
interior. The Potomac was followed as far as Cumberland, Maryland,
and the south branch of that river explored to its source in the elevated
tract near the center of the Virginias. Then crossing the main range
of the Alleghanies, Mr. McGee descended the Cheat, Monongahela, and
Ohio to Wheeling, West Virginia, re-examining the base-level, fluvia-
tile, and lacustral terraces already noted by others on those rivers,

The necessity for increasing the topographic force in New England
delayed the construction of the map of this area; but arrangements
have been made for its completion, and Mr. MeGee will thus be enabled
to present in comprehensive form the complicated phenoma of the region
which he has under study.

PALEONTOLOGY.

A few changes were made in the distribution of the work of the pale-
ontologic corps, looking to its greater systematization and effective-
ness. Certain independent parties which had previously been under
the immediate instruction of the director were assigned to duty under
the chiefs of division, and the paleontologic corps was increased by the
acquisitionof Dr. W. H. Dall, formerly of the Coast and Geodetic Survey.

Vertebrates.—Prof. O. C. Marsh’s personal work was confined to the
preparation of the manuscript and illustrations of his volumes on the
Dinocerata and the Sauropoda, and to the administrative duties of his
division. The former monograph was about ready for publication at
the end of the year. »Early in the spring four field parties were sent
out, two to the Jurassic beds of Wyoming, one to the same horizon in
Colorado, and one to Northern Kansas. There was received from these
parties during the year an unusually large amount of material. heir
success in collecting Pliocene mammals in Kansas, and the remains of
Dinosaurs in Colorado and Wyoming was marked—119 boxes having
been taken from one locality in Kansas alone. Upon the approach of
the winter season the collecting parties were transferred to Texas where
the weather is such as to permit exploration throughout the entire year.

Paleozoic Invertebrates—During the winter months Mr. C. D. Wal-
cott, the chief of this division, was engaged in the preparation of a re-
port on the Paleontology of the Eureka District, to accompany the
monograph of Mr. J. 8S. Curtis on the Silver-Lead Deposits of this
same region.

The plan of field work for the summer embraced the study by Mr.
Walcott in person of the Cambrian system in Eastern New York and
Western Vermont, including the preparation of numerous geologic sec-
tions and the collection of a large series of fossils; the continuance by
Assistant Geologist Williams of his investigations in the Devonian and
Lower Carboniferous in Western New York and Northern Pennsylvania
on about the same plan as that pursued in 1883, and the sending out of
collectors to obtain fossils from the Potsdam and Lower Magnesian form-
ations of Wisconsin and Eastern Minnesota, and from the Cambrian of
Northern Alabama. The latter part of this plan was satisfactorily carried
out, but in the midst of his investigations in Vermont and New York Mr.
Walcott was recalled, in conformity with the wish of the Honorable the
Secretary of the Interior, who desired that a competent geologist of the
Survey be designated to act as a member of a commission to examine
supposed coal-bearing areas on the White Mountain Indian Reservation,
90 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

in Arizona. Upon the completion of the field work in contiection with
this duty, Mr. Walcott proceeded to Texas and made a brief study of the
Paleozoic rocks in Burnet, Llano, San Saba, and Lampasas.Counties.
Though the study of these areas was limited, some very satisfactory
results were obtained. After his return from the south it was too late
to resume the investigations which he had abandoned in Vermont and
New York.

On November 26 Mr. Walecott’s report on the Deer Creek coal-fields
of the San Carlos Indian Reservation was forwarded to the honorable
the Secretary of the Interior.

Mesozoic Paleontology.—The paleontologic work of the division un-
der the direction of Dr. C. A. White included the examination of the
collections made by Mr. Becker on the Pacific coast. The successful
completion of this task has already been noted in the reference to that
division. Much preliminary work in connection with this duty was
performed by Dr. White, and to this and to the study of his own col-
lections he gave most of his time until his departure for the West in
early June.

The arrangement of fossils for installation in the National Museam—
a task which Dr. White superintends by reason of his curatorship in the
National Museum—demanded much of the time and attention of his as-
sistants during the winter season. This included the preparation of a
catalogue of the type-specimens of this division for insertion in the re-
port of the Director of the National Museum.

The preparation of an index-catalogue of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic
fossils was undertaken by Dr. White, and such satisfactory progress
made that it is believed its publication in 1885 will be possible.

On the opening of the field season and during the absence of Dr.
White, collecting parties proceeded to such localities in the southern
Appalachian District as contained formations which come under this
division. On returning from California in September, Dr. White at
once began the preparation of a report upon the Pacifie coast collec-
tions. This was about completed at the close of the year.

Cenozoic Invertebrates.—A_ systematic study of the Invertebrates of -
the Quaternary has long been an unfilled want in the paleontologic
work. In September the Survey was so fortunate as to secure the
services of Dr. W. H. Dall, who immediately entered upon his duties.
As a preliminary step, he began putting the large collections which
had accumulated from time to time in such shape that while under
study they can be utilized as’a means of identification for incoming
material. This task, in conjunction with the necessary attention to the
routine duties connected with this division furnished work for several
months. r

Paleo-botany.—No field-work was urdertaken by Prof. L. F. Ward
during 1884, his large collections made heretofore occupying his entire
time and attention. His especial line ¢f study was the collections ob-
; REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 91

tained by him from the region of the Upper Mississippi, and the Yel-
lowstone during the previous summer. In connection therewith he
also undertook the compilation of a general compendium of paleobot-
any; substantially a digest of the history and present status of the
science. Such a work, dealing largely with the literature of the sub-
ject, has come to be very important, if not indispensable to the proper
utilization of American material in geologic work. The preliminary
part of this volume, a sketch of paleobotany, illustrated with figures
and tables, will appear in the Director’s Fifth Annual Report.

Under Professor Ward’s direction there was prepared a catalogue of
the species of fossil plants in the National Museum, thus rendering the
collection much more valuable for purposes of reference.

Prof. W. M. Fontaine’s plan of work for the year was to continue his
investigation of the Mesozoic fossil-plants by means of the material al-
ready collected until the opening of the field season, and then to make
further collections froin this formation in localities to the north and east
of Fredericksburg, Va. The latter was successfully accomplished in a
brief tour, and Professor Fontaine then returned to the elaborating of
field-notes and the describing and figuring of type specimens.

Though engaged in the special line of work referred to, Professor
Fontaine also made a careful study of the general geology of the regions
visited in the course of his investigations. He believes that some of
his discoveries will definitely determine the status of certain forma-
tions whose character have been considered uncertain.

CHEMISTRY.

The effectiveness of the laboratory service was greatly increased by
the addition to the force of several experts and by the removal of the
New Haven physical laboratory to Washington. This latter was ren-
dered possible by the kindness of the director of the National Museum,
who, as previously stated, permitted the laboratories to oceupy the
rooms in the Museum vacated by the office of the Director of the Sur-
vey. The fitting up of these rooms for this purpose was begun in Octo-
ber, and before the close of the year the combined forces of the two
laboratories were busily at work again under Professor Clarke’s diree-
tion.

During the year there were made a large number of analyses of
mineral waters, sediments from mineral springs, minerals and clays, as
well as a large number of assays of mineral-bearing ores. Original
research was «lso prosecuted. This included new methods for the de-
termination of titanium in rocks, for the determination of minute quan-
tities of the precious metals in ores, and investigations concerning the
precipitated silicates of lime, aluminum, and magnesium, this latter
being fundamental to the study of the natural silicates.

Upon the opening of the field season Assistant Chemist Chatard pro-
ceeded to North Carolina for the purpose of obtaining specimens from
92 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the corundum fields of that region, and Doctors Gooch and Hallock were
sent to the Yellowstone National Park to make special studies of the
geyser phenomena. Bulletins setting forth the results obtained will be
issued in the due course of time.

In his capacity as a Curator of the National Museum, Professor Clarke
gave considerable time and attention to the arrangement of the mineral-
ogic collection to be exhibited at the New Orleans Exposition.

For some time prior to the removal of the physical laboratory from
New Haven, experiments were made for the determination of high tem-
peratures by means of thermo-electric couples. This line of research is
of importance, opening up, as it does, a wider range of investigation than
had heretofore been possible.

Before the close of the year there was sent to the press, a Bulletin by Dr.
Carl Barus, on the Electric and Magnetic Properties of Iron-Carburets,
the result of laboratory investigations.

The above reference to chemic work does not include analyses and
special mineralogic studies made by such divisions of the Survey as it is
not practicable to bring to Washington.

STATISTICS.

Mineral Resources of the United States.—As soon as it became practica-
ble to begin the collection of statistics concerning the mineral resources
of the United States other than gold and silver, the preparation of a see-
ond report was taken up by Mr. Albert Williams, jr. While this report
follows the general form and scope of the previous volume, and is in itself
complete, from a statistical and trade point of view, it complements the
latter in the matter of description of localities, metallurgic processes, &e.
A new feature will be the introduction of a series of graphic tables show-
ing at a glance the progress in the several industries. While adding but
a trifle to the cost of the publication, this scheme contributes greatly to
its effectiveness.

At the close of the year the statistics for 1883 were in shape for print-
ing, and progress made as far as possible in the collection of those for
1884. As soon as these are obtained the volume will be ready for the
printer.

PUBLICATIONS.

Believing that it will prove of value to the many readers of the Smith-
sonian Report, for purposes of reference, there is appended hereto, in
somewhat condensed form, the contents of the circular issued by the
Survey concerning its publications.

The publications of the United States Geological Survey are issued
in accordance with the statute approved March 3, 1879, which declares
that—

“ The publications of the Geological Survey shall consist of the an-
nual report of operations, geological and economic maps illustrating the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 93

resources and classification of the lands, and reports upon general and
economic geology and paleontology. The annual report of operations
of the Geological Survey shall accompany the annual report of the See-
retary of the Interior. All special memoirs and reports of said survey
shall be issued in uniform quarto series if deemed necessary by the Di-
rector, but otherwise in ordinary octavos. Three thousand copies of
each shall be published for scientific exchanges and for sale at the price
of publication ; and all literary and cartographic materials received in
exchange shall be the property of the United States, and form a part of
the library of the organization: And the money resulting from the sale
of such publications shall be covered into the Treasury of the United
States.”

On July 7, 1882, the following joint resolution, referring to all Gov-
ernment publications, was passed by Congress :

“That whenever any document or report shall be ordered printed by
Congress, there shall be printed, in addition to the number in each case
stated, the ‘usual number’ [1,900] of copies for binding and distribu-
tion among those entitled to receive them.”

Under these general laws it will be seen that none of the Survey pub-
lications are furnished to it for gratuitous distribution. The 3,000 copies
of the annual report are distributed through the document rooms of
Congress. The 1,900 copies of each of the publications are distributed
to the officers of the legislative and executive departments, and to stated
depositories throughout the United States.

Except, therefore, in those cases where an extra number of any pub-
lication is supplied to this office by special resolution of Congress, as
has been done in the case of the second, third, fourth, and fifth annual
reports, or where a number has been ordered for its use by the Secre-
tary of the Interior, as in the case of Mineral Resources, and Dictionary
of Altitudes, the Survey has no copies of any of its publications for gra-
tuitous distribution. The gratuitous edition of the Mineral Resources
is entirely exhausted. |

STATISTICAL PAPERS.

A fourth series of publications, having special reference We the mineral resources of
the United States, is contemplated.

COLLECTIONS.

During the year the collections of the Survey were increased by the
addition of 317 boxes of rocks, minerals, and fossils. This does not in-
clude the collections received at New Haven by Professor Marsh ; nor
the material collected by certain of the divisions of the Survey having
permanent headquarters elsewhere than in Washington, and held by
them temporarily for study.

UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION.

As in previous years, 1 include in my report to the Board of Regents
the principal facts connected with the work prosecuted by the United
States Fish Commission during each year, as, under the appointment
_ of the President, I exercise the function of United States Fish Com-
missioner. It is not necessary to go into any special detail in this con-
nection, as the Reports and the Bulletins of the Commission contain a
full account of progress during the year. The reports for 1882 and 1583
bring the subject up to the end of the latter year; and the continuation
for 1884 consists, for the most part, in carrying out the plans already
initiated in some respects on a larger scale.

Owing to the peculiarities of the season, the yield of eggs at the
shad-hatching stations near Washington was not as productive as in
previous years. The young shad hatched from these eggs were care-
96 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

fully distributed at many distant points, where they will no doubt exer-
cise a very important function in connection with the stocking of the
rivers of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts with shad.

The calls upon the Commission for the German carp have continued
to increase, and have been met as far as the stock at command would
allow. Twice the number of fish bred in the ponds in Washington
could have been disposed of had they been in our possession.

The two cars constructed expressly for the purpose of transporting
the fish to different parts of the country have proved extremely servy-
iceable; and Congress authorized the building of a third car, which
will be available in the early part of 1885. This contains many improv-
ments over the others, and will be of great value in the work of the
Commission.

The distribution of eggs of the Penobscot and land-locked salmon
from the stations in Maine has been satisfactory, as in former years,
the product of the stations being forwarded to such points in the United
States as promise to be the most suitable.

In no year since the establishment of the Commission have there
been so many eggs of whitefish taken at the two stations in Michigan,
about one hundred and fifty millions being the actual yield. This fish
is growing in favor, and there are numerous demands for it.

A large increase has been made in the distribution of the California
trout, a fish that promises to be of great service in localities where the
common brook-trout of the Eastern States cannot be maintained in
proper condition.

The usual annual Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission has
been published, making the fourth volume in the series. It contains
many interesting communications which are very much sought after.

In previous reports mention has been made of the seacoast station at
Wood’s Holl, a point specially adapted for carrying out the work of the
United States Fish Commission.

After having devoted a number of years to the improvement of the
river fisheries of the United States, especially those of the salmon,
shad, whitefish, &c., attention was turned to the fish inhabiting the
ocean, with a view of determining the possibility of multiplying them
to a profitable degree. The first experiments in this direction were
mostly made at Gloucester, Mass., in the winter of 1878~79, and were
so satisfactory, in spite of the inclemency of the winter weather, dur-
ing which the work is carried on, that it was determined, as soon as a
suitable site could be obtained on the south coast of New England, to
prosecute the work there on a large scale.

Wood’s Holl combining all the requirements in a greater degree than
could be found eisewhere, the first subject to be taken into considera-
tion was that of acquiring the ground on which to erect the buildings.
This was done by the liberality of several citizens of Massachusetts,
and of the Old Colony Railroad Company, supplemented by contribu-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 97

tions from various collegiate establishments which desired to utilize
the expected opportunities in the interest of education. An appropri-
ate strip of ground was thus secured and presented by the donors to the
United States for use by the Commission. After the State of Massa-
chusetts had formally ceded its jurisdiction the donation was accepted
and an appropriation made for the necessary buildings. A concur-
rent appropriation, in the interests of commerce and navigation, for the
construction of a harbor of refuge, and expended by the Engineer
Bureau, was found to embrace all the requirements for locality, and
the station as now organized comprises a hollow basin of about an acre
in extent, in which pens and inclosures for fish can be made; and a
wharf outside forming a suitable landing-place for coaling vessels, ete.
An abundance of fresh water, and in addition an unlimited supply of
salt water, complete the desiderata.

The building for the accommodation of persons connected with the
Commission is completed, and was occupied during the past summer,
and the fish-hatchery and laboratory will be ready for the season of 1885.

The work of hatching codfish is now under way, with promise of entire
success.

The inquiries of the Commission in connection with the occurrence on
the coast and their distribution of useful fishes, mollusks, &c.; its in-
vestigations into the character of the sea-bottom, and its suggestions as
to its ability to support sea fishes, furnish large numbers of specimens
of a great variety of species. These are carefully investigated by spe-
cialists connected with the Commission, and minutely detailed and
described in its reports. After making selections for the benefit of the
National Museum the duplicates are assorted, labeled, and made up
into sets for distribution to colleges and academies. The number of
sets already distributed amounts to several hundreds, the specimens in
each set being carefully identified and labeled. No more acceptable
contribution could be made to a college or academy, in view of the ab-
solute impossibility of obtaining such objects from any other source,
even without regard to cost.

The opportunities afforded at the sea-coast stations of the Commission
for scientific research have, for many years, induced the presence of
some of the most distinguished specialists in natural history and biology
in this country,and many more persons apply for a share in the benefits
than can be accommodated, although the material collected is usually
in sufficient abundance for the needs of a large number of inquirers.

In order to utilize the surplus material and facilities of the Wood’s Holl
station in the interest of such parties it was thought desirable to obtain
control of a tract of about two acres of ground immediately adjacent to
the premises of the Commission, and in every way suitable for the erec-
tion of supplemental buildings, in which outside students could be ac-
commodated and find the necessary facilities for work without interfer.
ing with the operations of the Commission. A friend of science accordin gL?

purchased ground at a cost of about $2,500, and holds it for future ac-
tion. It is proposed to subdivide this into six lots, and to furnish the
use of these lots to as many scientific establishments in the country as
ean be accommodated, all the expenses of erection of the necessary
buildings and their maintenance to be cared for by the establishments in
question.

A question, however, has arisen as to the control of the ground so as
to secure proper co-ordination of action on the part of tenants, and pre-
vent any use other than for the purely scientific purposes originally con-
templated.

The owner of the ground, desiring to secure permanent supervision
over it, wishes to deed it to the Smithsonian Institution, and I respect-
fully refer the subject to the Board for its action.

No money, either now or hereafter, is asked or expected from the In-
stitution, but simply that it shall administer the trust referred to as
coming strictly within its province—that of the ‘increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men.”

Respectfully submitted,
SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution.

APPENDIX TO THE SECRETARY’S REPORT.

REPORT ON SMITHSONIAN EXCHANGES FOR 1884.
By GEORGE H. BOEHMER.

One of the principal events of the year was the removal from a tem-
porary location in the central hall of the Smithsonian building to the
new quarters assigned in the east wing of the reconstructed fire-proof
portion of the building, taking place in the month of March, 1884. This
removal caused a temporary cessation of active operations, and conse-
quently a not inconsiderable accumulation of material, which, together
with the regular increase, crowded into the last nine months of the year
an unusual amount of work. Furthermore, my appointment to visit
Europe on business of exchange, and consequent absence since July—
during which time Mr. N. P. Scudder assumed the duties of my position
additional to his regular work as assistant in charge of the domestic
branch of the exchanges—diminished the active force of the depart-
ment; but notwithstanding all these disadvantages, the zealous and
efficient application of the various assistants to their respective duties
enabled them to overcome the obstacles, and to place the bureau in a
position to enter upon the work of a new year without any accumula-
tion.

The Record Division.—The duties of this office, as specified in the re-
port for 1883, have been performed by Miss J. C. Diebitschin a com-
mendable manner, and notwithstanding the large increase in the work,
the card catalogue alone now embracing 4,000 cards against 1,000 in
1883, and other multiplications of work—the files and records in this
division have been posted promptly and accurately, so as to admit of
momentary inspection of the accounts of exchanges kept with the vari-
ous foreign establishments—an advantage claimed for the system when
its acceptance was urged.

Foreign Exchange Division.—In February, owing to the transfer of
the assistant in charge of this branch of the service, Mr. F. V. Berry
was appointed in this place, and it is due to his energy and untiring
application to his duties that the unusual accumulations and constant
increase had been disposed of before the close of the year.

99
100 REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF EXCHANGES.

During the year 18,886, packages, with an aggregate weight of 78,732
pounds, have been received—an increase of 800 packages over the year
1883—which were sent in 537 boxes, this being 120 boxes more that in
1883. A detailed statement is presented in the appended general sta-
tistics.

Domestic Exchange Division.—As stated in the introductory, Mr. Seud-
der, the assistant in charge of this branch, had been appointed to as-
sume the duties of the office during my absence in Europe on business
of exchanges. Of the work performed in this division, I submit Mr.
Scudder’s report, as follows:

“The number of packages received and distributed to the United
States during the year 1884 was 10,236. Of these 8,094 were sent to
societies and 2,142 to individuals.

‘‘The number of packages distributed by the domestic exchange dur-
ing the year 1883 is somewhat (704) larger than the above, because of
a slight modification of the scope of this branch of the exchange.

“During the year 1883 packages for Canada were forwarded by the
domestic exchange, whereas in 1884 they were forwarded by the foreign
exchanges. Again, in 1883 and the first eight months of 1884, all books
for the Smithsonian Institution, whether received by mail or otherwise,
were entered on the exchange records, but for the last four months of
1884 all books for the Smithsonian Institution coming by mail were sent
direct to the Smithsonian Institution library without passing through
the exchanges.”

Government Exchange Division.—In last year’s report the suggestions
made in 1882, of placing this work in the hands of one assistant, to the
exclusion of any other duty, has been, in part at least, inaugurated.
A card catalogue has been prepared, and a clerk is intrusted with the
proper management of this duty, in addition to such other work as may
become necessary, like copying, &c., while the receiving and shipping
is still done by the assistant in charge of the foreign branch.

During the year the Government of England has agreed to a com-
plete exchange of all official documents, commencing with the 1st of
January, 1882, and preliminary arrangements have been made to the
same effect with the Government of Austria.

The receipts in this branch during the year are 22 boxes and 38,337
packages, with an aggregate of 32,827 pounds, while the transmissions
to foreign governments amount to 114 boxes, against 76 boxes in 1883.

_In the year 1881 special attention was invited to the large increase

in the reception of exchange parcels, the number for that year, 1881,
being 43,104; in 1882 this had increased to 58,047; in 1883 to 63,894;
and in 1884 to 65,170. In the report for 1882 it was respectfully sug-
gested that the receiving and distributing of all the incoming exchanges
be made a separate division of the service, and placed in the hands of
a tried competent assistant, since on the prompt and accurate per-
formance of this duty depends the punctuality of shipments of foreign,
domestic, and Government document exchanges.

Taking the present status of incoming parcels, we now receive on an
average over 200 parcels per day. These have to be assorted, arranged,
compared with the invoice—if such has been furnished, otherwise au
invoice has to be prepared—provided with the number corresponding to
the respective address in the list of foreign correspondents and in the
card catalogue, and distributed in the bins to await their turn of ship-
ment. Thus far this work has been performed—mostly at the expense
104 REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF EXCHANGES.

of other important duties—by the assistants of the respective depart-
ments to whom such incoming parcels are referred, and it is from
these considerations that the suggestion is now renewed and urged
that this branch of the service be placed in charge of an assistant, while
an additional clerk be employed to prepare, under his supervision, the
then remaining only mechanical portion of the foreign exchanges, the
shipping.
TRANSMISSIONS.

1. Foreign transportations.

An unusual number of boxes have been shipped during the year,
the increase over last year being 120, while from 1882 to 1883 an in-
crease of 70 boxes only was noticed. The following table furnishes a
comparison with former years:

REPORT ON EXPLORATIONS AND COLLECTIONS IN THE
QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS, BRITISH COLUMBIA.

By JAMES G. SWAN.

In 1873 I wrote a memoir on the Haidah Indians, of Queen Charlotte
Islands, which was published in the Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge (No. 267), January, 1874. In the advertisement the late
Professor Henry says that, ‘under the head of ethnology, it raises
some questions which seem of great significance, and which it is hoped
will lead to further investigations.” It was not, however, till 1883 that
an arrangement was effected, when, early in that year, I was sent by
Professor Baird to that interesting group of islands lying in the North
Pacific Ocean, off the coast of British Columbia, between lat. 51° 30/
and 54° 20/ north, to make collections and obtain useful information for
the United States Fish Commission, the National Museum, and the
Bureau of Ethnology.

On the 29th day of May, 1883, I left Port Townsend, Wash., for Vic-
toria, B. C., to make my arrangements for the cruise, by purchasing all
necessary stores and outfits, and securing a credit with the Hudson Bay
Company to make purchases and draw orders on their traders at Fort
Simpson, B.C.,and at Masset, on Graham Island, the largest of the Queen
Charlotte group. I also madea similar arrangement with the Skidegate
Oil Company to give orders on their store at their oil works, near Skide-
gate village, B. C. This was to enable me better to trade with Indians
for the procuring of specimens of their manufactures, and to avoid the
trouble and risk of carrying coin with me to those islands, and to ena-
ble me to keep an account of my expenditures in a more satisfactory
manner. Having completed my arrangements, I next secured the serv-
ices of an assistant and interpreter, a young Haidah Indian, a native
of the Klue or Cumshewa district on the eastern coast of Moresby
Island, the second largest of the Queen Charlotte Islands. This Indian,
whose name is Johnny Kit Elseva, I had personally known ‘for some
time as one of the most intelligent, faithful, and reliable natives I ever
have seen. To his qualifications as a cook and general servant he
added those of an interpreter; his knowledge of English, which he
speaks fluently, enabling him to understand me fully at all times. He
is also a working jeweler, skilled in making silver bracelets, ear-rings,
and charms, and a good carver in wood and stone. Heis also an artist,
and has drawn for me in India ink a series of mythological sketches

illustrative of the folk-lore of his tribe, and is still at work in finishing
137
138 REPORT ON THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS.

other sketches, which, when completed and fully described by me, will
be forwarded for the use of the Smithsonian Institution.

As the communication with Queen Charlotte Islands is very uncer-
tain I was obliged to wait for the steamer ‘‘ Otter,” which for many years
has made semi-annual voyages to the islands, going in the spring with
supplies for the Hudson Bay Company trading-post at Masset, and
with goods for the oil company at Skidegate, and returning in October
to take away the furs, fish, and oil that have been collected during the
season.

From some cause of delay the “Otter” did not leave Victoria until
Monday, June 18, when we made a start at noon for Masset via all
the trading stations and canneries on the route. I did not object to
this, as I was thereby enabled to see many places where I expected to
procure specimens, without additional cost for passage. As the detail
of a sea voyage would be unnecessary here, I will omit all mention of
it except of the places where we stopped.

The next day, June 19, we arrived at Alert Bay, on Cormorant Island,
the trading-post and cannery of Mr. Wesley Hudson, who has been there
a number of years, and takes an interest in scientific matters, and is
considered a reliable man in all his statements regarding fisheries, seals,
and other fur-bearing animals, and in Indian lore. I shall refer to this
gentleman in my general report.

At 11.45 p.m. we left Alert Bay and ran down Johnson’s Strait to
Queen Charlotte Sound, and at 1 p.m. on the 20th we arrived at the
canneries of Shotbolt & Co., at the head of River’s Inlet, where we dis-
charged some freight, and left at 2.30 p.m. In this inlet, besides Shot-
bolt’s canneries, are a saw-mill and canning establishment of Messrs.
Saunders and Warren, of Victoria, but I did not visit them, as the steamer
remained so short a time.

After leaving River’s Inlet we ran up Fitzhugh Sound to the Hudson
Bay Company’s trading-post of Bella Bella, where we arrived June 21 at
1.30 a. m., and left at 2. a. m. for the mouth of the Skeena River, where
there is another cannery, at a place called Port Essington, where we ar-
rived at midnight; but I did not go ashore, as we shortly left for Metla-
katla, where we arrived at 6.30 a. m. on Friday the 22d.

Shortly after our arrival Bishop Ridley, the bishop of the diocese,
came on board and kindly invited me to go ashore with him, which I
did, and was introduced by him to Rey. Mr. Collinson, one of the mis-
sionaries, who has a fine collection of fossils and Indian curiosities, which
he kindly showed me, but as I had but a short time to remain on shore
I made a hurried visit, which I would gladly have prolonged, and then
went to the residence of the Rev. Mr. Duncan, the founder of the Met-
lakatla mission, and the teacher and preacher to the Indians of the
Tsimsean tribe, who have a settlement at Metlakatla.

I was very cordially received by Mr. Duncan, who showed me some
blankets and shawls made by the mission Indians, and then took me to

REPORT ON THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS. 139

his cannery, where some fifty Indians, men and women, were engaged
canning salmon. Everything was scrupulously neat and clean, and the
whole work done with a precision and exactness which showed that
Indians can be taught to do such kind of work, and, when taught, are
as capable as a majority of white men, and are far preferable to Chinese.
Mr. Duncan next wished me to visit his church, which I desired very
much to do, but just then the whistle of the old steamer Otter gave the
signal for departure, and, escorted by Mr. Dunean, I returned on board,
and at 8.15 a. m. we left for the Hudson Bay Company’s post at Fort
Simpson, where we arrived at 12 o’clock noon.

Fort Simpson is situated on the mainland but a few miles south of
the boundary between British Columbia and Alaska. It is one of the
principal trading posts of the company, and is under charge of Mr. R. H.
Hall, from whom I purchased a quantity of Indian manufactures in
carved stone, to be sent by him to Victoria for me. I also saw Rev.
Thomas Crosby, Wesleyan missionary, from whom I purchased several
articles made by Tsimsean Indians, and then went with him to visit his
church and school. I found a marked improvement in the appearance
of Fort Simpson since I visited it seven years ago in the U.S. 5S.
“Wolcott.” The old unsightly Indian houses of former days had been
removed, and a pretty village of neat cottages surrounds the fine church,
and gives evidence of the skill and taste of the Indians, when encour-
aged by intelligent sympathy, to emulate the dwellings of white men.
The general effect of the village, when viewed from the anchorage, is
very pleasing, and would be creditable to any of our frontier towns.

At 1.30 P. M. we left Fort Simpson for Fort Wrangel, Alaska, where
we arrived the next morning (Saturday, 23d) at 8 o’elock.

At Fort Wrangel I purchased several articles of Indian manufacture,
and saw many more, but as they all came from Queen Charlotte Islands,
where I was going, 1 concluded to make my purchases there. Having
finished our business at Fort Wrangel we were ready to leave at noon, but
there being a very heavy seaand stormy SE. gale of wind all day we re-
mained until the next morning (Sunday, 24th). At 3 o’clock we started
and ran down Stachinski Strait into Duke of Clarence Strait, where we
encountered a stormy head wind and heavy head sea, which retarded
our progress till the next morning (Monday the 25th), when we had a
terrific time with a stormy tide-rip and SE. gale, which tossed the old
steamer as if she were an egg-shell. At 2 Pp. M. the wind and sea went
down and we soon got out of Clarence Strait into Dixon’s Entrance and
ran across to Masset Inlet, north end of Graham Island, and anchored
off the Hudson Bay Company’s post at Uttewas village, two miles up
the inlet, where I was kindly and most hospitably received by Alex-
ander McKenzie, esq., the company’s agent at Masset, who furnished
me comfortable quarters in a cottage within the company’s inclosure.

Masset is a very pretty place, situated on the east side of Masset Inlet.
The land is low and level, and covered with dense foliage of evergreen
140 REPORT ON THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS.

trees, spruce, hemlock, and cedar, and an undergrowth of shrubbery,
rose bushes, wild currant, raspberry, and hazel, with much open grass-
land, on which wild strawberries are found in great quantities, of un-
usual size and superior flavor. Strawberries and wild roses seem to be
a specialty at Masset, and are noted by every person who visits Gra-
ham Island in June.

Masset is the site of the Indian town of Uttewas, a village containing
65 houses old and new, some of them deserted and in ruins; nearly every
house has a carved column erected in front covered with heraldic or
totemic designs of the family residing within. These columns are pic-
ture writings and illustrate the folk-lore of the tribe, and most of them
are allegorical or mythical fables which I succeeded in deciphering, and
my account of them, with illustrations, will be prepared by me for my
complete monograph on Queen Charlotte Islands.

Fish.—The principal fish used by the Masset Indians for food is the
halibut, which abounds in the waters of the inlet and along the whole
of the north shore of Graham Island. Several varieties of salmon ran
up Masset Inlet, one of which, a small variety called by the Haiddhs
“ Swagan” (O. keta, Walb.), is as fat and fine flavored as the Quenaiult
salmon of the same variety, and is taken in considerable quantities by
the natives, as is also a fine quality of salmon trout which are taken in
weirs and traps in the small creeks which empty into the inlet. The
dog salmon (0. kisutch, Walb.) is taken in the fall in considerable num-
bers for winter use. Dogfish abound, and a large quantity of their oil
is collected by the Hudson Bay Company every season from the In-
dians.

Codtfish (Gadus morrhua) seem to breed in the waters of Masset Inlet,
where I procured several specimens from 14 to 2 inches long, which
I preserved in alcohol. Mr. McKenzie, the Hudson Bay Company’s
trader, purchased a few hundred pounds of true cod from the Indians
which he salted in kench. I atesome of them and they were quite equal
to pickled eastern cod, but the Haidahs do not seem to care for them,
and when occasionally they catch the cod while fishing for halibut, they
are always ready to sell them to white men. From what the Indians
told me, and from my own observation, I think the true cod abound all
along the northern and western coast of the whole group. These, with
the Ophiodon elongatus, Kultus cod, or inferior cod, several species of
Sebastichthys, and the black cod (Anoplopoma fimbria), lamprey, eels,
herring, smelt, &c., form an extensive and plentiful variety of food-fish.

Of the plants observed by me, were Abronia arenaria, L.; Lupinus
Nootkatensis, Donn; Ranunculus Nelsoni, Gray; Rubus ursinus (Cham.),
Schl.; Nutkanna mocino, R.; Spergularia, Pursh., Rosa Nutkana, Presl;
Epilobium angustifolium, L.; Erigeron salsuginosus, Gr.; Campanula
Scheuchzert, Gray; Gaultheria Shallon, Pursh.; Mimulus luteus, Willd;
Castilleta pallida, Kunth; Aquilegia formosa, Fisch.; Gentiana Amarella,
L.; Pinus contorta, Douglas; Abies Engelmanni, Parry; A. amabilis,

Forbes ; Thuya gigantea, Nutt ; Cupressus Nutkatensis, Lamb; Fritillaria
lanceolata, Hook; Fragaria Chilensis, Duchesne; Mahonia, Berberis Aqui-
folium, &e. All of the foregoing I observed in the vicinity of Masset,
and along the north shore of Graham Island. All of them are identical
with the plants at Cape Flattery, Wasb., except the Cupressus Nutka-
tensis, and the Castilleia pallida, which latter at Cape Flattery is bright
red, while at Masset and elsewhere on Queen Charlotte Islands it is
pale yellow.

Collections.—1 was fortunate while at Masset in obtaining articles of
great interest, such as models of ancient war canoes, salmon and trout
nets, stone mortars, hammers, mauls, carved boxes, carved dishes of
wood and horn. But the objects of the greatest interest to me were five
images, three inches long, made of pure native copper by swedging
and cutting. These images represent naked men and women dancing.
They were worn at the belt in front of the person dancing, and made a
tinkling sound.

I procured them of an old woman, who told me that they had been in
her family before her great grandmother could remember. The legend
respecting them is that an ancestor of hers while on a trading excursion
to Sitka procured them of an Atna or Copper River Indian from the
tribe of that name to the northwest of Sitka. These images were con-
sidered of such value that I was offered a large sum if I would part with
them, which I declined, as I considered them the best proof I have seen
of the ancient intercourse between the Aztecs of Mexico and the tribes
of the Northwest coast. On my subsequent return to Victoria, Mr.
Alexander McKenzie, who had come from Masset, mentioned about
these copper images on board Her Majesty’s ship Swiftsure, then lying
in Esquinault Harbor. The surgeon of the ship, Dr. Moore, produced
a silver image, 14 inches long, which he had procured at Guatemala
during the summer of 1883. This was made of pure nugget silver, and
had been worn by a lady as a charm and suspended to the neck by a
ribbon through a ring on the top of the head of the image. Mr. Me-
Kenzie was so struck with the similarity of design with the copper
images that he borrowed it of Surgeon Moore, and had it photographed
in four different positions. By comparing the two photographs the
Aztec style seems to be seen in both alike.

I also found in the grave of an old doctor, or skaga, who had been
dead fifty years or more, a couple of carved tusks, which I at first
thought were those of a peeccary or Mexican wild hog, but subsequent
examination in Washington proved them to be the babyroussa or Asi-
atic wild hog, and the question is how they reached Queen Charlotte
Island. A gentleman, long a resident in Japan, informs me that the
Siamese junks are accustomed to trade on the African coast, running
down with the northeast monsoons and returning with the southwest
monsoon. These Siamese junks bring everything they can get, and
trade with the Japanese and Chinese. These Japanese or Siamese junks
142 REPORT ON THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS.

have been frequently wrecked on the northwest coast, and in 1831 one
of these junks was-wrecked on the Queen Charlotte Islands, and we have
records which show that in 1694 a Japanese junk was wrecked on the
Kamtchatkan coast. And at various intervals since that date we find
five junks reported as being wrecked on the northwest coast, previous
to the one I have mentioned in 1831. It is therefore easy to assume as
a logical conclusion that the tusks of the babyroussa were procured
from the wreck of some one of those old junks and became the property
of the old shaman, and from their rarity were considered a highly
prized medicine, which were buried with their owner as some of his
treasures.

During my visit at Masset I went up the inlet and made several col-
lections in natural history. I also took occasion to study the manners
and customs of the Indians, which will be illustrated and explained in
my future report.

I remained at Masset until August 6, having been detained two weeks
waiting the return of the Indian who was to take me to North Island
and around the west coast to Skidegate. Everything being ready, I left
Masset on Monday, August 6, at 8.30 a.m., in a large canoe with seven
Indians, two of whom were boys thirteen or fourteen years of age.

The canoe was owned and commanded by ‘“ Edinso,” chief of North
Island, where I wished particularly to make examinations. Edinso for-
merly lived at a village called Kioosta, on the northwest end of Gra-
ham Island, opposite North Island. We camped that night at Yatze
village, a little to the west of Virago Sound, and the next morning,
August 7, at 5 o’clock, we broke camp and proceeded to Jalun River,
where we stopped for breakfast, the Indians meanwhile having speared
ten humpback salmon (0. gorbuscha).

At this place is a singular exhibit of volcanic action; the lava had

burst up through the superincumbent rocks as though the region had-

boiled like a pot. The lava was of a brick-red color, and in some places
a pale sulphur yellow, and filled with bowlders and pebbles of stone
blackened outside with the heat, and looking like a gigantic plum pud-
ding. This is the first instance I have seen of such an evident volcanic
action on the direct sea-beach.

From Jalun River we passed on leisurely, examining the shore from
the canoe as we went. At 1.30 we passed the pillar rock at Pillar Point,
and I made a sketch of the pillar, which shows quite different from Pro-
fessor Dawson’s sketch made from the shore, and gives a better idea of
the surrounding country.

At 2 p. m. we went ashore in Parry Passage and gathered some speci-
mens of shells, principally Heliotis and Pecten. I took the tempera-
ture of the water in Parry Passage, and found it 54°, air 60°, barometer
30, 31, and at 4 p.m. we landed at Kioosta village, where I pitched
my tent and remained till the 14th, visiting in the meantime North
Island, Cloak Bay, and two burial caves, in one of which I found a

REPORT ON THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS. 143

number of boxes, carved and painted, each of which contains the
mummified remains of former inhabitants of the near’ villages. The
prejudices of the Indians and my overloaded canoe did not permit me
to collect any specimens of those mummies, which I could easily have
done if I had been in a steamer. I collected many interesting speci-
mens of fish and mollusks, and could have procured more, but unfor-
tunately the net which had been made for my dredge before leaving
Port Townsend proved useless on trying it, as the man who made it for
me had made a mistake in its shape, which made it impossible to use it
in deep water. Had my dredge worked properly I could have obtained
many interesting mollusks in Parry Passage, which is a rich field for
the naturalist.

While at Kioosta village I made sketches of carved columns and
heraldic designs and my Indian assistant, Johnny, drew, in India ink, a
number of sketches illustrative of Indian legends, which when com-
pleted will furnish an interesting and valuable addition to the general
report of my summer’s work.

Near my camp at Kioosta village is the mausoleum or burial house
of old Doctor Koontz, a famous skaga or shaman, who died many
years ago and was famous in his time as a great medicine man. In his
grave I found the tusks of the babyroussa mentioned.

Directly opposite this point, on the southeast portion of North Island,
is Cloak Bay, made interesting by the mention of it by Captain Dion:
who named it in 1787, and Captain Marchand, a French navigator, who
visited it in 1791. My notes and pbsepyations made during my week’s
camp at Kioosta are too extensive to be inserted in this brief synopsis.

On Tuesday, August 14, we broke camp at Kioosta and started for
Skidegate at 10.20 A. M., with a fair tide which took us past Cape Knox,
the extreme northwest point of Graham Island, where we encountered
a tide-rip and rough cross-sea very dangerous to our heavily-laden
canoe. The wind now commencing to blow fresh from the south-
east with rain, we were forced to make a landing at a rocky point called
Klekwakoon, which we did at 1.30 Pp. M., and with difficulty scrambled
over a reef which extends out from the shore a considerable distance
and is bare at half tide. Iremained at this place till the 17th, being
unable to proceed owing to constant head wind and heavy sea. I oe-
cupied the time by explorations up and down the coast, collecting
curiosities and other fossils, and a few specimens of small cota and
other fish, and making notes of the appearance of the country, which
is thrown into various contorted and fantastic shapes by voleanie action.
It presents a most remarkable formation, and 1 regretted that I did not
have a photographic apparatus with me to have taken a view of the
scene, which it is impossible otherwise to describe.

I found quantities of drift stuff on the beaches and in the coves,
among which were logs, and broken boards of redwood from California,
144 REPORT ON THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS.

showing the northerly drift along the shores of Oregon, Washington
Territory, and British Columbia.

On Friday, August 17, I left Klekwakoon for the village of Tledoo,
near Susk or Frederick Island, at 9 a. m., and reached camp at 2.30
p-m. There were a few Indian houses unoccupied and I took posses-
sion of one, glad to get under shelter from the rain which was falling
fast.

This village, which we found vacant on our arrival, is occupied during
the season by sea-otter hunters.

I had procured a chart of Queen Charlotte Islands published by the
English admiralty from amap by G. M. Dawson, of the Geological Sur-
vey office, Montreal, who made areconnaissance of the east coast of the
group in the summer of 1878. The west coast has never been surveyed,
but the chart of that portion was made up from an old Russian map of
1849, which is very incorrect. I kept this chart before me as I cruised
along the coast in the canoe, and old Edinso, who is an excellent pilot,
pointed out to me the errors in the chart as we passed along, and gave
me the nomenclature of all the capes, points, bays, inlets, harbors, and
islands. Frederick or Susk Island and Hippa or Nesto Island had
been pretty accurately laid down, but the intervening spaces from Cape
Knox to Skidegate Channel were not correctly laid down, and I marked
the corrections as we came to each place. At Hippah Island in par-
ticular is a fine inlet not laid down, which makes a complete harbor of
refuge for vessels bound up or down the coast. It is hidden from the
view of passing vessels by Nesto or Hippah Island, and will be found
when properly surveyed to be of much importance to commerce. All
my new work I have marked in red ink on the copy of the chart which
I sent to Washington from Victoria, August 6.

I was detained at Camp Tledoo from August 17 to August 21 by head
winds and heavy breakers, which prevented our passing through the
only opening in the reef to the ocean, and I occupied the time in making
such collections as I could and making notes of the country for several
miles each side of our camp.

On Tuesday, August 21, I started at 5.20 a m. and proceeded as far
as Hippah Island, where we camped for the night with much discomfort.
The following morning I made a reconnaissance of Skaloo Inlet and
noted it on my map, and proceeded leisurely along, noting every point
and change in the coast, till we came to Runnell Sound, when it com-
menced to blow from the south, with fog and rain, and we were forced
. to take refuge in a cove called Tchuwn, where I had to remain, wind and
storm bound, till Saturday, the 25th, when I started at 7 a. m., and
having camped that night in Skidegate Channel, I reached the Skide-
gate Oil Works at 8 o’clock Sunday morning, August 26. I at once
made arrangements with the Skidegate Oil Company to assist me in
procuring some black cod (Anoplopoma jfimbria), which was done by
sending Indians to the west coast, where they abound, and in a few
REPORT ON THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS. 145

days I had over one hundred fine fish, which I had split like cod and
salted.

I remained at Skidegate making collections of the Indians till Tues-
day, September 4, when I started on a visit to the villages of Skedans,
Cumshewa, and Laskeek, in the southern portion of the group, and suc-
ceeded in obtaining some rare specimens of Indian work used in their
masquerade performances and highly prized by them.

At the village of Laskeek, on Tanoo Island, is the most interesting
collection of columns, both heraldic and mortuary, and more monuments
for the dead than I had seen in any other village. The Indian house in
which I stopped is 4 new one, of large dimensions, built after the ancient
style. In this house will be held the most extensive ceremonies that
have taken place for many years, consisting of the tomanawas or secret
performances, then the public tatooing of persons of all ages and sexes,
then the masquerade dances and the distribution of presents, when sev-
eral thousand dollars’ worth of blankets, calico, clothing, and provisions
will be given away, and the whole interspersed with feasts at different
houses in the village. The occasion of this is the erection of one or
more huge columns, elaborately carved with totemic devices, to show the
wealth and importance of the chief in front of whose house the column
will be erected. This great ceremony will take place in the fall of this
year and will be well worth seeing, as it is probable that it will be the
last grand display of the kind that will take place, the influence of mis-
sionaries being directed to suppressing these ancient ceremonies, in
which they have succeeded, so far as regards the villages at Masset
and Skidegate, where the ceremonies of the tomanawas, if performed at
present, are greatly shorn of their honors, and I was thereby enabled
to obtain many articles of ceremonial usage, which formerly no white
man was suffered to look at, much less to purchase and take away.

The grand tomanawas of next fall will last from two to three weeks.
I left Laskeek village on my return to Skidegate on Saturday afternoon,
September 8th, and ran back with a fair wind to Koona village, the resi-
dence of Captain Skidance, the chief of the Klue district, where I re-
mained till the 10th, when I arrived at Skidegate village at 8 p. m., and
the following morning returned to the oil works, when I at once packed
my Skidegate collection into cases, took passage on the company’s little
steamer Skidegate, for Victoria, leaving Skidegate on Friday, September
21st, and reaching Victoria on the afternoon of the 27th.

The result of my work may be briefly summed up as follows: I have
a most interesting and valuable collection of articles of Indian manu-
facture. I have succeeded in introducing the black cod, a new and valu-
able food-fish. I have determined the locality of several new inlets
and harbors on the west coast of Graham Island. I have succeeded in
deciphering the true meaning of the hieroglyphics of the carved col-
umns, which are in great profusion in every village, and the meaning of
the tattoo marks on the persons of the natives, I have collected evi-

dence of the former intercourse between the Haidahs and the Aztec
races of Mexico, and have accumulated an amount of information re-
specting the interesting tribe inhabiting the Queen Charlotte group of
islands never yet made public, but which I shall elaborate in form for
publication.

It may perhaps be proper for me to mention at this time, without be-
ing charged with egotism, that my work in the Queen Charlotte Islands
has been considered of such value to the Province of British Columbia-
that I have received an official invitation to deliver a lecture before the
government and legislature of that province and to other government
officials in Victoria on the subject of the Queen Charlotte Islands, which
lecture I propose to deliver this present month, having obtained permis-
sion so to do from Professor Baird.

Although I have accomplished much, yet there remains much of in-
terest to science to be further investigated, not only on the Queen Char-
lotte Islands, but among the Haidahs of the Princeof Wales Archipel-
ago, in Alaska; and anything intended to be done among those Indians
to still further develop objects of interest should be done at once, before
the tourists gather in all articles of Indian manufacture, and before the
Indians themselves shall have passed away.

{Extract from the Proceedings, Vol. XXXII, Philadelphia meeting, September, 1884.]

The Committee on Indexing Chemical Literature, appointed in 1882,
respectfully presents the following report of progress.

We have the pleasure to announce that since our last report the fol-
lowing indexes have been published by their authors, the arrangement
of material being uniform with that of those previously issued:

Ozone, second index, by Prof. Albert R. Leeds.

Peroxide of Hydrogen, second index, by Prof. A. R. Leeds.

Speed of Chemical Reactions, by Prof. R. B. Warder.

Starch Sugar, by Dr. E. J. Hallock.

Besides these a valuable contribution to chemical bibliography has
been independently published on a somewhat different plan, by Prof.
Albert B. Prescott and Mr. J. W. Baird. The full titles of the above
will be found at the close of this report.

Two hundred and fifty copies of our report for 1883 have been sent to
chemists throughout the United States, the Smithsonian Institution
having kindly attended to the distribution by mail without expense to
the committee. This led to correspondence with several chemists who
regarded the scheme of co-operative indexing favorably, and resulted
in several offers of assistance.

Prof. William Ripley Nichols offers an Index to the Literature of Car-
bon Monoxide.

Prof. L. P. Kinnicutt offers an Index to the Literature of Meteorites.

Dr. Henry Leffmann reports progress on his Index to the Literature of
Arsenic.

Prof. C. E. Monroe does likewise with reference to an Index to the
Literature of Explosives.

Prof. A. B. Prescott and Mr. J. T. Craig offer an Index to the Liter-
ature of Phosphorus.

Dr. H. Carrington Bolton has in preparation a second Index to the
Literature of Uranium.

An offer was also received of an index to an elsment Already on the
list of those published, but was withdrawn as soon as the author had his
attention called to the existing publication. This cireumstance shows
forcibly the advantage of co-operation through this committee.

We are pleased to announce that in consequence of our representations
the Smithsonian Institution has consented to publish indexes to chemical]

literature which shall be indorsed by this committee. The Smithsonian
places a limit to the number of pages which will be printed per annum,
but the limit is a generous one.

By thus seeuring the assistance of the Smithsonian Institution, chem-
ists are assured of a reliable and authoritative channel of publication,
together with a wide circulation, and the plan of co-operative indexing
will undoubtedly receive a great stimulus.

Finally, to extend more widely acquaintance with the existing indexes,
we append a complete list of those printed. A limited number of those
published by the New York Academy of Sciences can be had by ad-
dressing the chairman of the publication committee of the academy,
Prof. D. S. Martin, 236 West Fourth street, New York City.

Respectfully submitted.
