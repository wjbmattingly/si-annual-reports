JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 21, 1885.

The annual meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution was held this day at half-past 10 o’clock, a. m.

Present: Hon. G. F. EpMuNDs, Hon. J. S. MORRILL, Hon. S. B.
Maxey, Hon. O. R. SINGLETON, Hon. W. L. Wixtson, Hon. W. W.
PHELPS, Rev. Dr. JOHN MACLEAN, Rev. Dr. NOAH PORTER, Dr.
HENRY CoPpPEE, Dr. JAMES C. WELLING, and the Secretary, Professor
BAIRD.

Excuses for non-attendance were read from Chief-Justice Waite,

Prof. Asa Gray, and Hon. N. P. Hill.

In the absence of the Chancellor, on motion of Mr. Phelps, Dr. Por-
TER was called to the chair.

The journal of the Board was read and approved.

The Secretary stated that the Rev. Dr. NoAH PORTER had been
re-elected a Regent for six years by the joint resolution of Congress,
approved March 3, 1884.

The Secretary, presented to the Board the following letter :

Prof. SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution:

DEAR Sie: The state of my health renders it necessary to tender my
resignation as a member of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution.

In signifying my resignation it is with no ordinary feelings I recall
the years I have been connected with the Board and the distinguished
men with whom it has been my privilege and honor to be associated.
Not only the present members whom | so highly respect and esteem,
but a long list of honored names of former members now deceased, re-
cur to me, the last of which is that of Professor JoSEPH HENRY, and
while JAMES SMITHSON will be known to the world and remembered
as the founder of the Institution, JosEPH HENRY will be regarded as
having been raised up by a signal Providence, the true interpreter of

his will, the able organizer of the Institution, and wise controller of its
finances.

May the Smithsonian Institution, so auspiciously established and ex-
tensively known, continue, under your wise administration, an esfab-
lishment distinct and specific, for the ‘ increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge among men.”

With great respect, your friend and servant,
PETER PARKER.

2 LAFAYETTE SQUARE,

Washington, D. 0., April 7, 1884.
XII JOURNAL OF THE BOARD.

_ The Secretary informed the Board that Congress had filled the va-
cancy occasioned by the resignation of Dr. Parker by the election of
Dr. JAMES C. WELLING, president of Columbian University of Wash-
ington, D. C., for six years from May 13, 1884.

On motion of Dr. Maclean it was—

Resolved, That the Board of Regents has heard with regret of the
resignation of Dr. Peter Parker, and hereby expresses the high appre-
ciation of the valuable and efficient services he has rendered the Insti-
tution for the past seventeen years as a Regent and as Chairman of
its Executive Committee.

The Secretary stated that in accordance with the rules of the Board
during its recess, the remaining members of the Executive Committee
had filled the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of Dr. Parker, by
the appointment of Dr. Welling.

On motion of Dr. Coppée it was—

Resolved, That Dr. Welling be elected to fill the vacancy in the Ex-
ecutive Committee.

The Secretary reported that in accordance with the request of the
Board at its last meeting, Senator Edmunds had prepared a Dill rela-
tive to the provision for an Acting Secretary, which had passed Con-
gress and become a law on the 13th of May, 1884, as follows:

An act to provide for the appointment of an Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
[Public No. 31, Forty-eighth Congress, first session. ]

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the Chancellor of the
Smithsonian Institution may, by an instruinent in writing filed in the
office of the Secretary thereof, designate and appoint a suitable person
to act as Secretary of the Institution when there shall be a vacancy in
said office, and whenever the Secretary shall be unable from illness,
absence, or other cause to perform the duties of his office; and in such
case the person so appointed may perform aJl the duties imposed on the
Secretary by law until the vacancy shall be filled or such inability shall
cease. The said Chancellor may change such designation and appoint-
ment from time to time as the Institution may in his judgment require.

Approved, May 13, 1884.

Under the provisions of this act the Chancellor had taken the fol-
lowing action:

LYME, CoNnN., July 2, 1884.

By virtue of the authority conferred on me by the act of May 13,
1884, ‘“‘to provide for the appointment of an Actinig Secretary of the

JOURNAL OF THE BOARD, XIII

Dr. Maclean presented the annual report of the Executive Commit-
tee, which was read.

On motion of Dr. Coppée it was—

Resolved, That the report of the Executive Committee be accepted,
and that the income for the year 1885, be appropriated for the service
of the Institution upon the basis of the above report; to be expended
by the Secretary with full discretion as to the items, subject to the
approval of the Executive Committee.

The Secretary presented the following communication he had received
since the last meeting of the Board:

JUNE 2, 1884.
SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution,
Washington, D. C.:

Sir: I intend to make a bequest for the advancement of science—
that is, of physical science. For many reasons I would like to make
the bequest in favor of the Smithsonian Institution; but there is one
difficulty which must be cleared up before I can decide. If money were
left by will to the Smithsonian Institution would it defend the will
against the claims of any and all persons who should contest the will
and take legal steps to set it aside? Has it authority by law; has it
funds that it would be authorized to use for the purpose of defending a
will in its favor? As I have no children the will would be less likely
to be contested, but there are others who might attempt to set it aside.
For this reason what I wish above all to be assured of is that any legacy
that I leave for the purpose named will not be given up without making
a fight of it if needful. Please explain this point.

I wish you to send me a form of words, the very words themselves,
in which a bequest should be made so that there could be no pretense
of setting it aside for vagueness ; and that will carry out my intentions,
which I will explain:

The chief part I would desire to bequeath to the Institution would
be for the “ increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,” and beside
would wish to have the Institution invest say $300 (is that too insig-
nificant for the purpose?) and use the income thereof for conferring a
gold medal either annually or biennially (which would be the better ?)
on the person who had made the most important discovery in physical
science during the year, or two years ending, say a year before the date
of conferring the medal. For example, the Regents would have to
decide, say in the month of December, 1883, who made the most im-
portant discovery in physical science during the year, or two years,
ending December 31, 1882. If you have my meaning put it in language
that will make it perfectly clear without multiplying words.

The medal not for any patented invention, like the electric light, for
example, but especially and only for such discoveries as Pasteur on in-
fection, fermentation, &c., and G. Darwin’s on tidal action. Regents
to be sole judges as to what is meant by physical science and most im-
portant discoveries therein.

The reason why I would like to have not only suggestions and ex-
planations but the full “TI will and bequest to” its also because I don’t
know whether to say the Regents shall do this or that, or whether to say
a majority or quorum of them shall do it in order to make it both strictly
legal and also practicable; also, whether or not it is necessary to say
‘how the Regents shall invest the money. I suppose a copy of that part
XIV JOURNAL OF THE BOARD.

of Hamilton’s or Huebus’ (Habel ?) will would answer for the part re-
lating to the “increase and diffusion,” &c. As for the medal I believe
no fund has been left to institutions for that purpose, and I should like
to have your opinion on it.

Please return this letter with your answer, which I would like you to
let me have as soon as you can; taking, however, all the time you need
to make it so full and explicit that no further correspondence will be
necessary at this stage. I mean business if your answer is satisfactory.
For the present I desire this affair to be treated as confidential, or if
necessary to mention to other parties, withhold the name.

There is one thing I had rather do than make a bequest in favor of
the Institution, namely, pay over a certain sum, say $2,000 or $2,500,
in trust to the Regents; provided I could receive the income during
life, the Institution to have the sole use and possession of the same after
my death. Would the Institution be authorized to accept a sum of
money on such terms ?

Respectfully,

* * * *

After full discussion of the subject it was, on motion of Mr. Edmunds—

Resolved, That the communication be referred to the Executive Com-
mittee with full power to act in relation to it.

The Secretary, Professor Baird, presented his annual report of the
operations of the institution for the year 1884, which was read in part.

On motion of Dr. Maclean, the Secretary was instructed to transmit
the report to Congress.

On motion of Mr. Edmunds, it was—

Resolved (1), That the fiscal year of the Institution shall hereafter ter-
minate on the 30th day of June in each year.

(2) That the Secretary shall hereafter prepare and cause to be printed
and sent to each member of the Board on or before the first day of De-
cember in each year, his annual report.

(3) That the annual meeting of the Board of Regents shall hereafter
be held on the second Wednesday in January in each year. :

The Board then adjourned sine die.

The balance (January 1, 1884), $802.17, of the appropriation for pre-
paring the scientific report of the Polaris expedition, has been expended
during the year, according to the certificate of Major Hobbs, October
6, 1884, disbursing clerk of the Treasury Department.

The appropriation by Congress of $900 to reimburse the Institution
for its expenditures in connection with the Henry statue, was received
from the Treasury Department in October, 1884, and is included in the
statement of receipts for the year.

The committee has examined the vouchers for payments made from
the Smithson income during the year 1884, all of which bear the ap-
proval of the Secretary of the Institution, and a certificate that the
materials and services charged were applied. to the purposes of the
Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the National
Museum and find that the balances above given correspond with the
certificates of the disbursing officers of the Interior and Treasury De-
partments.

The quarterly and annual accounts-current, the check-books and
journals have been examined and found correct.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION
OF THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE SMITHSONIAN IN-
STITUTION.

Prof. 8. F. BAIRD,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution:

Sir: We have the honor to submit a report of the operations pertain-
ing to the fire-proof reconstruction of the east portion of the Smithson-
ian building, which was commenced in the month of April, 1883, and
completed during the last year.

For a proper understanding of the conditions under which this work
was executed it may be well to recall a few steps in the life of the whole
building.

On the 28th of January, 1847, the plans of James Renwick, esq., of
New York, were adopted, bids for the completion of the whole building
were invited, the work awarded on the 9th of March, and the corner-
stone laid on the 1st of May following. Five years were stipulated for
the completion of the work under the building contract.

On the 26th of February, 1850, the interior framing and floors of part
of the center building, intended to contain the museum of apparatus,
fell down into the basement before completion, and on July 3, 1850, a
committee of the Regents of the Institution reported “that the interior
of the main building is defective in the kind of material originally
adopted and to a considerable degree in the quality of the material em-
ployed, which consists principally of wood. The money was mainly
expended upon the cut-stone work of the fronts.” The committee rec-
ommended “that the interior of the center building be removed and
that a fire-proof structure be substituted for it.”

In January, 1853, the plans of Capt. B. S. Alexander, U.S. A.., for fire-
proofing and finishing the interior of the center building were adopted,
and the author of the plans intrusted with the superintendence of this
work, which was commenced in June, 1853, and completed in Decem-
ber, 1854. It included a lecture room with unsurpassed optical and
acoustic properties, accommodating 1,800 persons. Unfortunately for
the building the term “fire-proofing” had in those days simply refer-
ence to floors and walls, so that the fire-proofed center building still
retained a combustible wooden roof, like all other public buildings
erected about the same time.

A fire occurred on the 24th of January, 1865, which destroyed this
roof, and with it all the interior of the upper story of the main building
and the adjacent towers. The executive committee of the Regents re-

xXIx
xx REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS.

ported that careful survey forced upon them the conviction that “the
original construction of the building as a whole was very defective and
unsuited as a receptacle of valuable records. The two wings and con-
necting ranges, which were not injured by the fire, are defective in ma-
terial and construction. The floors in some cases, though covered with
flagging, rest upon wooden beams, which are decayed, and in a few
years the interior of these parts will require removal.”

The Regents decided that the restoration should in all parts be inde-
structible by fire, and intrusted Adolf Cluss, architect, with the plans
and superintendence of the work, which was carried on shortly after
the close of the war, when material and labor had risen to the highest
mark.

The second story of the center building was fitted up as a hall for
Government collections, and was covered with an iron and slate roof;
five towers were fitted up with iron and brick floors, partitions, and roofs,
and with iron stairs. This work was completed in the season of 1867.
Fire-proof floors were substituted in 1871 for the decayed lower wooden
floors of the west wing and of the northwest arcade, and in 1873 a steam-
heating apparatus was put in the building.

The east wing, then called the chemical wing, was originally arranged
for one large lecture-room, provided with seats for 1,000 persons, and
the adjoining range was fitted up for two apparatus-rooms in close prox-
imity with the lecturers’ table. When the improved lecture-room in the
main building was completed in 1854 there was no longer any use for
the now antiquated room which absorbed the whole east wing. Hence,
this wing was temporarily divided into two stories, with wooden floors, and
studded, lathed, and plastered partitions. The lower floor was arranged
in alarge room for handling all articles of exchange. &c. The second
story was fitted up with a suit of rooms for the accommodation. of the
Secretary of the Institution, in accordance with the original intentions
of the Regents, and the high space above was left unfinished as a loft.

The fenestration became, in the newly arranged two stories, most
anomalous. The tall windowsof a lofty lecture-room being subdivided,
the old frames came to be in the lower story very near to the ceiling,
and almost on a level with the floor in the upper story. The connect-
ing wing, as altered, accommodated simply two middle-sized offices, with
the cloister along the exposed north front, through the open arches of
which rain and snow drifted, and rotted the wooden floor-joists so much
that they had to be temporarily supported from the cellar. Before long
the open arches of the cloister had to be filled in with temporary wooden
windows, which barely kept the weather out.

Above the first story of the range there was a second story, of no
practical value, since the external architecture limited the size of its
windows to bull’s-eyes of 24 feet in diameter, &c.

The museum was shut off from the eastern main entrance by direct
obstructions and by floors on two different levels.
REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS. XXI

This deplorable condition of the east wing, continued for a series of
years, demanded in the end prompt action, and in March, 1883, an ap-
propriation of $50,000 was made by Congress for the fire-proof recon-
struction of the eastern part of the Smithsonian Institution, to which
$15,000 were added in July, 1884, for completion and furniture.

Under these appropriations the old “ chemical wing” was stripped of
the combustible constructions; so much of the exterior walls as de-
pended upon the wooden frame work was carefully taken down; all or-
namental cut-stone work, consisting of copies from doors, windows, and
cornices of divers monastic edifices in France and Germany, was laid
aside and reset in the walls during the progress of the work. The
dark and damp cellar, containing 4,500 square feet of floor space, was
drained, and provided with a Portland cement floor upon a concrete
foundation, and converted into dry working-rooms in best sanitary con-
dition. Onthe ground floor cheerful offices were arranged on both sides
of a broad and level corridor, by which the old museum is reached in a
direct line from the east entrance. The formerly useless and anomalous
second story was rearranged into two stories of ten feet clear height
for offices, with adequate light and air, and covered with a metal roof,
fastened in a fire-proof manner upon concreted brick arches.

Above the ground floor of the east wing there were but six badly
lighted and ventilated rooms in a second story. These were replaced
by seven well lighted and aired spacious offices, and a similar space
was gained in each of two upper stories for offices and document-rooms.
This wing is crowned by a pitched medieval wrought-iron roof, covered
with slate hung to iron pur-lines for the steep portions, and with metal
upon hollow terra-cotta tiles for the flat portions.

There are arranged above the basement, in all, 36 office rooms, con-
taining 12,500 square feet floor space. ;

In the progress of the work the exterior walls were strengthened, sub-
stantial brick walls were built for the interior partitions, and supports
of the fire-proof floors consisting of concreted brick arches sprung
between rolled-iron beams.

All the rooms are provided with extra large gas-pipes and flues end-
ing above the roof, so that eventually either of them may be used by the
scientists for experiments. There are tubes laid throughout for inter-
communication by means of oral annunciators, and piping for clocks.

Documents may be raised or lowered from the outside of the building
to the basement by a hoist, and from there distributed to the archives
in the different stories by means of an elevator of cheap construction.

A compact low-pressure steam-heating apparatus warms the whole
section promptly and comfortably at a moderate expense.

The exterior architecture was simply modified by resetting all the
architraves and cornices at such levels as to enable valuable space
within the building to be made useful for laboratories, offices, work- .
rooms, archives, and store-rooms, by enlarging some of the windows as
XXII REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS.

necessary for the new conditions, by supplying a small quantity of plain
cut stone, and by adding Norman dormers of cut-stone work for light-
ing the space within the pitched roof of the west wing.

A financial statement accompanies this report, which gives the cost of
all branches of the work in detail and requires no comment.

With the completion of the work, as above reported upon, the prin-
cipal part of the Smithsonian building is now, from foundation to roof,
beyond the reach of any serious fire. Still the reconstruction is not com-
plete as long as the west wing and adjoining range above the ground floor
are of combustible construction. During a conflagration in those com-
bustible parts of the building, the main building in the center would
probably be considerably damaged by water.

In the center building some repairs are necessary, and the first story
ought to be re-arranged, so that the available space can be made more
useful for the purposes of the Institution.

We have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obed’t,

REPORT OF PROFESSOR BAIRD, —

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR 1884.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith the report of the
operations and condition of the Smithsonian Institution for the year
1854. This, in accordance with the usual custom, will include an ac-
count of the work performed by the Smithsonian Institution itself, as
well as that of the branches of the public service placed by Congress
under its charge, namely, the National Museum and the Bureau of Eth-
nology. To this will be added a sketch of the work of the United
States Fish Commission, which is also under my charge; and of that
of the U. S. Geological Survey, kindly furnished by its Director.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
INTRODUCTORY.

Outside of the regular routine work of the Institution, an account of
which will be furnished in its proper place, are the details connected |
with the participation, in 1884, by the Smithsonian Institution in the
exhibitions at Cincinnati, Louisville, and the International Cotton Ex-
position at New Orleans, with which your Board was charged by order
of Congress. A full account of the history of these undertakings will
be given hereafter.

An increasing number of national organizations for the promotion of
science has received accommodation in the lecture-room of the National
Museum during the year, in accordance with thé authority of the Board.

The repairs to the eastern portion of the Smithsonian building have
been completed, with the exception of a few minor details, and the offices
re-established.

The general progress of the Institution during the year, and that of
the public service under its control, has been satisfactory. The Smith-
sonian funds are in good condition, the new year being entered upon
free from any indebtedness and with a satisfactory balance on hand.

The publications of the Institution have been continued, and numer-
ous additions have been made to the library. The work of the Inter-
national Exchange service continues to increase, and will, it is hoped,

it
2 REPORT OF TILE SECRETARY.

be placed upon a still more definite and satisfactory basis during the
year 1885.

The additions to the Museum have been unexampled in extent, con-
sequent partly upon the acquisitions made in connection with the ex-
hibitions just referred to, and partly upon the labors of the Geological
Survey, of the Ethnological Bureau, of the United States Fish Commis-
sion, and of numerous miscellaneous explorations, both public and pri-
vate.

THE HENRY STATUE.

The appropriation of $15,000, made some years ago by Congress, for
the erection of the Henry statue did not quite cover all the expenses,
and the sum of $900 was advanced from the funds of the Institution.
Believing, however, that it was the intent of Congress that this statue
should be placed in position without cost to the Institution, application
was made for the sum named, which was duly allowed. The money has
been paid over and placed to the credit of the Institution.

PROFESSOR HENRY’S SCIENTIFIC WRITINGS.

At the meeting of the Board of Regents of January 17, 1883, a reso-
lution was introduced by Dr. Maclean to provide for the republication
of Professor Henry’s scientific writings. A committee appointed at the
last meeting of the Board, January 16, 1884, consisting of Prof. Asa
Gray, Hon. William L. Wilson, and your Secretary, has had the subject
under consideration, and has decided that the resolution only covered
such of Professor Henry’s articles as had actually been printed, and espe-
_ cially the portion prior to his entrance upon his duties at Washington.
The editing of this publication was intrusted to Mr. Wm. B. Taylor, who
has been engaged in collecting the necessary material. The commence-
ment of the work has gone to press, and a sample is submitted for the
information and criticism of the Regents.

JAMES SMI'THSON.

In the Life of Smithson,* published by the Institution a few years ago,
the author, Mr. Rhees, says: ‘It is an interesting subject of speculation
to consider the motives which actuated Smithson in bequeathing his
fortune to the United States of America, to found an institution in the
city of Washington. He is not known to have had a single correspond-
ent in America, and in none of his papers is found any reference to it
or to its distinguished men. It has been alleged that he was more
friendly to monarchical than to republican institutions, but there ap-
pears to be no foundation for this opinion. * * * By selecting the
United States as the depository of his trust he paid the highest compli-

ment to its intelligence and integrity, and testified his confidence in
republican institutions and his faith in their perpetuity.”

It is gratifying to be able to confirm this supposition by information
which has recently been communicated to this Institution. The follow-
ing letters from a grandson of Davies Gilbert, president of the Royal
Society, and an intimate friend of Smithson, were received during the
past year:

ENYS, PENRYN, CORNWALL, ENGLAND,
March 13, 1884.
Prof. S. F. BARD,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution :

Str: Some years since I noticed, while I was living in New Zealand,
an advertisement for any letters or information relating to Mr. Smithson,
addressed especially to descendants of Sir Davies Gilbert and others.

_ On my return to England.I came across a letter written by Smith-
son, dated Paris, May 9, year 4, (1792), under his first name, James
L. Macie, and addressed to my grandfather, Mr. Davies Gilbert (never
SiR). Should you wish for a copy of this letter and any information
relative to his passing at Oxford, and short notes by my grandfather
written in his pocket-book, I shall be glad to send them.

I should have inclosed copies, but fear the ‘life’ projected may be

long since published.
Yours, truly,

JOHN D.-ENYS.

ATHENZUM CLUB, PALL MALL, S. W.,
May 16, 1584.

My DEAR Sir: I have lately returned from fishing in Scotland, and
write to acknowledge your answer to my letter re Smithson.

On my return to Cornwall next month I will copy from my grand-
father’s pocket-books the entries relating to him as Mr. Macie, and for-
‘ ward a copy of the only letter I know of from him written from Paris
when the Revolution was first under way.

I shall be grateful if you could forward me here, or to my address in
Cornwall, any life or account of Mr. Smithson such as you have already
published. :
Yours, truly,

JOHN D. ENYs.

ENYS, PENRYN, CORNWALL,
August 23, 1884.
My DEAR Sir: I am afraid that the following extract from my grand-
father’s pocket-books and addresses to the Royal Society of London will
be of very slight value to you.. I know of no other letter of his, but
any under the not familiar name of Macie I have no doubt were long ago
burnt. Should any farther information turn up I will forward it.
I shall be glad to hear if you think right to publish the inclosed, which

were written on the leaves bound up in Mr. Davies Gilbert’s pocket-
books, and should like copies of any information which has been pub-
lished before.
You are at liberty to destroy the extracts or publish them, as you
think best towards Smithson’s memory.
Yours, truly,
JOHN D. ENYs.

“‘ Macie, afterwards Smithson, was a Gent. Com. when I entered at
Pembroke College.

‘‘ His mother’s husband was a country gentleman, to whose estates he
has succeeded; but the first Duke of Northumberland was allowed on
all hands to be his father. At the time of his matriculation I have
heard that a blank was left for his surnames, Mr. Macie having at that
period instituted suit to annul his marriage, which the wife defended.
The Dutchess of N. then died, when Mrs. Macie wished the marriage
dissolved, with the hope of marrying the Duke of N., but this the hus-
band from spite opposed, and I have heard that a suit was actually in-
stituted in which the parties had changed sides. Pending these mat-
ters Mr. Macie died, and my friend succeeded to his estate. The Duke
of Northumberland did not marry the mother, nor, I believe, did he
notice Macie in his will, certainly not beyond a small legacy. Yet on
that event Macie had the bad taste (not to use a stronger expression) to
obtain the King’s authority for taking the name of Smithson (his puta-
tive father’s), be still continuing to usurpe and wrongfully hold, by his
own admission, the property of the Macie’s.

‘‘Mr. Smithson has lived chiefly abroad, with manners and habits
more foreign than English. He is living unm arried in 1826. * * *
Several ingenious papers in the Phil:-Transactions and other periodi- ~
cal works here and on the Continent under the names James Smith-
son and James Macie. D.G.”

‘“‘ In the college register it is usual, after incerting the Christian and
surnames of the person admitted, to add Filius Richardi (for instance):
Armigeri or Generosus, but not repeating the surname.

“In Mr. Macie’s case the addition is Filius Armigeri, omitting his
father’s name altogether. D. G.”

Note in bound copy of MS. pocket-book kept by Davies Gilbert.

“ MAY 26, 1786.
“On this day Mr. James Louis Macie (afterwards Smithson) was ere-
ated Master of Arts in the Convocation House. I remember his being
seated on the upper end of the bench, on the floor, on the proctor’s left
hand; that we walked back together, when Macie exchanged his cap for

a hat, and then walked with me round Christ Church meadows. What
is very curious his father’s name is omitted and he is merely stated to
be the son of an esquire.”

“For some account of Mr. James Smithson Macie see Gentleman’s
Magazine for March, 1830, p. 275.”

“‘ Extract translated from the college register: “1786, May 7, James
Louis (or Lewis) Macie, «et. 17, of London, son of an esquire, matricu-
lated of Pembroke College, Oxford.”

at the Royal Society.”

Letter from James Smithson to Davies Gilbert.

“PARIS, May 9th, Year 4 [1792].

“ DEAR Sirk: Your letter did not reach London till after I was come
out of town, and followed me here. I really take it exceedingly ill of
you to have forgot my crystals, and beg of you to make quick and
ample atonement for it. I do not now remember what particular ones
I requested you to procure me, but any you bring shall, king-like, be
graciously received, as a testimony of your good intentions. Well!
Things are going on! (a ira is growing the song of England, of Eu-
rope, as well as of France. Men of every rank are joining in the
chorus. Stupidity and guilt have had a long reign, and it begins, in-
deed, to be time for justice and common sense to have their turn. The
office which you have been lately named to will, I hope, afford you
means of promoting their cause. Every Englishman I converse with,
almost every Englishman I see or hear of, appears to be of the demo-
cratic party. Mr. Davis, high sheriff for Dorsetshire, left this town to-
day and takes with him, it seems, a quantity of tricolor ribbon to deck
his men with the French national cockades, and I do not think this ex-
ample unworthy of imitation by those whose principles lead them to
consider with indifference and contempt the frowns of the court party,
to whom, doubtless, the mixture of red, white, and blue is an object of
horror. I do not tell you news of this country, as the English papers
inform you pretty faithfully of the manner in which it goeson. You
have understood, I hope, that the church is now here quite unacknowl-
edged by the state, and is indeed allowed to exist only till they have
leisure to give it the final death-stroke. Mr. Louis Bourbon is still at
Paris, and the office of king is not yet abolished, but they daily feel the
inutility, or rather great inconvenience, of continuing it, and its dura-
tion will probably not be long. May other nations, at the time of their
reforms, be wise enough to cast off, at first, the contemptible incum-
brance. I consider a nation with a king as a man who takes a lion as

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

It is with regret that I announce the resignation of Hon. Peter Parker,
on April 17, 1884, of the office of member of the Board of Regents and of
the Executive Committee. Dr. Parker has performed these functions
for many years, and always with zeal and fidelity. His advancing years
and the great amount of labor required from the Executive Committee
in the way of auditing the accounts of the Institution, &¢., made him
firm in insisting upon the acceptance of his resignation agafnst many
protests. His place was accordingly filled by Congress by the election
of Dr. James C. Welling, president of Columbian University of this city,
on May 13. Dr. Welling was requested by the remainder of the Execu-
tive Committee—General Sherman and Rev. Dr. Maclean—to take Dr.
Parker’s place on that committee.

The term of Rev. Dr. Noah Porter as Regent having expired, he was
re-elected by Congress on March 3 for another term of six years.

ACTING SECRETARY.

In view of the importance of having some one, notably an officer of
the Institution, to exercise the functions of Acting Secretary in the
event of the extended absence, disability, or death of the Secretary, a
law was passed January 24, 1879, giving to the Chancellor the power
to make such selection; and Mr. W. J. Rhees, the chief clerk, was ap-
pointed to fill the position. The Board at its last meeting found some
informality or uncertainty in the act of Congress, and the following
act, prepared by Hon. G. F. Edmunds, of the Senate, one of the Re-
gents, was passed, and approved on May 13, 1884:

An act to provide for the appointment of an Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution.
Public, No. 31, Forty-eighth Congress, first session.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the Chancellor of the Smith-

sonian Institution may, by an instrument in writing filed in the office
of the Secretary thereof, designate and appoint a suitable person to act
as Secretary of the Institution when there shall be a vacancy in said
_ office, and whenever the Secretary shall be unable from illness, absence,
or other cause to perform the duties of his office; and in such case the
person so appointed may perform all the duties imposed on the Secre-
tary by law until the vacancy shall be filled or such inability shall
cease. The said Chancellor may change such designation and appoint-
ment from time to time as the Institution may in his judgment require.

Approved May 13, 1884.

In accordance with this act the following action was taken by the
Chancellor:

By virtue of the authority conferred on me by the act of May 13,
1884, ‘‘to provide for the appointment of an Acting Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution,” I hereby designate and appoint Mr. William
J. Rhees to act as Secietary of the Institution when there shall be a
vacancy in that office, and whenever the Secretary shall be unable, from
illness, absence, or other cause, to perform the duties of his office.

M. Rh. WAITE,
Chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution.
LyME, Conn., July 2, 1884.

PORTRAITS OF THE REGENTS.

It has been the object of the Smithsonian Institution to make a col-
lection, as complete as possible, of the likenesses of all who have served
as its Regents. This object is comparatively easy of attainment in the
jmmediate present, but as the enterprise was not initiated until quite
recently, there is an undesirable number of blanks in the collection.
Crayon portraits, however, of Prof. Asa Gray, at present one of the
Regents, and of President Fillmore, and Vice-President George M.
Dallas, who were Chancellors of the Institution, all by Mr. Henry Ulke,
were added to the gallery during the year.

FINANCES.

As in previous years, the Secretary has much pleasure in announcing
the excellent condition of the finances; all indebtedness to the 1st of
January, 1885, having been paid, and leaving a balance in the Treasury
available for the operations of the coming year. In the report of the
Executive Committee will be found a statement of the receipts and
expenditures, with the balances, as also a list of appropriations made
by Congress. In the list of credits enumerated will be found the sum
of $900, appropriated by Congress for expenses of construction and
installation of the Henry statue over and above the original appro-
priation.

The permanent Smithson fund in the Treasury of the United States
is $703,000. The receipts during the year 1884, including the balance
unexpended on the Ist of January, were $68,994.20, and the expendi-
tures $43,613.36; leaving a balance of $25,380.84, available for the
operations of the Institution, in 1589.
8 . REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

BUILDINGS.

Smithsonian Building.—The appropriation of Congress, available on
January 1, for the reconstruction of the eastern range and wing was
insufficient to complete it, and an additional sum of $15,000 was granted
at the first session of the Forty-eighth Congress. This was expended
in fitting up the two upper stories of the building, which had been
necessarily left unfinished for lack of funds. This included the intro-
duction of iron furring and iron lathing for the ceilings immediately
under the roof—a measure very necessary for the comfort of the ocecu-
pants of the rooms below them. It was impossible, however, to find
the means for plastering, which yet remains to be done.

With the additional appropriation many of the rooms were fitted up
specially for their requirements, including a post-office, which is used
by nearly 200 persons—equal in the amount of mail distributed daily to
that of a village of considerable size.

In view of the difficulty of making the electric connections answer a
satisfactory purpose, it was thought best to make provision for intro-
ducing the pneumatic clock system whenever occasion allowed, and for
this purpose the air-tubes were inserted, to which the regulator-clock
and the dials in the several rooms can be fitted at any time. A similar
provision was made for the oral annunciator—an arrangement by which
communication can be established direct at a central station between
the pipes leading to any two rooms in the building, thus facilitating com-
munication and obviating the use of several telephones. A few tele-
phones have been introduced, more especially with reference to connec-
tion with the switchboard in the National Museum, and by which
communication is established with all parts of that building, as well as
with the city systems of exchange and those of the Departments.

By the courtesy of the Superintendent of the Observatory, and at but
slight expense, a control-clock was set up in the National Museum
building, as also in that of the Smithsonian Institution, these being reg-
ulated at noon each day by communication direct from the Observatory.
In this way the important desideratum of accurate time is obtained.

The rooms in the reconstructed portion of the building are now all
occupied for the general purposes of the Institution, notably the depart-
ments of administration, of international and miscellaneous exchanges,
of the reference library, of transportation, and of publication. Several
rooms are occupied by artists employed in connection with the work of
the Institution, or persons who are engaged in preparing special reports
upon collections and explorations made by them under the direction of
the Smithsonian Institution, the Fish Commission, and the United States
Signal Office. Three rooms have been fitted up as a special chemical
laboratory, in charge of Dr. Kidder, the chemist of the United States
Fish Commission ; and all work in the way of rating of thermometers,
barometers, and hydrometers is under his direction, as also that con-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

nected with chemical analyses of air, sea-water, &c. Much work has
already been done by him in this connection.

Two rooms are occupied by the United States Coast and Geodetic
Survey in making pendulum experiments.

Considerable changes have been made in the central portion of the
main building, consequent upon the retransfer of the temporary offices
to their permanent quarters in the eastern end. The large room on the
first floor has been givenup exclusively tothe collections of birds, shells.
and in small part to the fishes; and by the removal of the cases on the
south galleries exceptional facilities have been furnished to the curators
who have charge of these departments respectively.

During the year some experiments were made by the Brush Electric
Light Company in lighting Washington by means of powerful are lights
placed on top of lofty buildings, the points selected for this purpose
being the dome of the Capitol, the summit of the Smithsonian tower,
and the top of the Washington Monument. To increase the altitude of
the Smithsonian tower a pole was erected 50 feet high, the top of which
was, therefore, about 200 feet from the ground. At the request of the
» Institution, General Hazen, Chief Signal Officer, was kind enough to
lend a large vane, which has been erected, and which serves an admir-
able purpose in showing the direction of the wind from over a wide ex-
tent of the city.

National Museum Building.—This building continues to give entire
satisfaction as fully carrying out its objects. As might be expected,
the ordinary minor repairs have been required from time to time, but
nothing involving any considerable expeuse. Some of the wooden floors
have rotted in places, and may hereafter require renewal. At present,
however, the renewal of a few of the boards has answered the purpose.

Major Powell, of the United States Geological Survey, having secured,
by Congressional favor, the use of a large fire-proof building in this city,
his own offices and those of a considerable portion of his sctentific- aids
have been transferred from the National Museum building, permitting
a rearrangement in the latter, which has been greatly to the convenience
of the service. The rooms vacated in the northeastern pavilion were
reoccupied, however, by the chemical and physical departments of the
Geological Survey ; but the transfer of the latter from the southwestern
pavilion has enabled us to give much better accommodations to the
mineralogical, metallurgical, and lithological branches of the service.
The four courts which have been hitherto used merely as work-rooms or
foy storage have been cleared out and will soon be occupied by exhibits,
thus adding over 16,000 square feet to the available space for display.

Temporary shed in the grounds.—The immense amount of work required
to properly comply with the directions of Congress in connection with
the exhibitions at Cincinnati, Louisville, and New Orleans made it
necessary to take a portion of the appropriation to erect a temporary
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

building of 100 by 50 feet in the grounds. This, of course, will be re-
moved as soon as it can be dispensed with; but it has furnished an im-
portant aid in the general work of the Institution for the year.

Brick work-shop.—The vacating of several rooms by the transfer of
Major Powell’s photographic department to its new quarters on F street
has permitted a much more satisfactory arrangement to be made of the
taxidermical service, Mr. Henry Marshall, in charge of the mounting of
birds, having moved upstairs and left the lower floor to Mr. Joseph
Palmer, the superintendent of the division of modeling in plaster and
papier-maché. The building has also been used to unpack a large col-
lection of corals, which was made by Dr. Edward Palmer for exhibition
at New Orleans.

Armory Building.—This building has received some necessary repairs
to its roof and has been painted inside, so as greatly to increase the
neatness of its appearance. The two oval spaces referred to in the pre-
ceding report as having been left in the concreting of the yard have now
been converted into fish-ponds, in which carp and other fish are kept
pending their distribution by the United States Fish Commission.

An extension of the car-shed has also been built, under which four
ears of the Fish Commission can be accommodated.

As has already been stated, a side-track from the Baltimore and Po-
tomac depot runs into the grounds of the Armory and under the sheds,
and the whole establishment has been of very great service for loading
the exhibits prepared by the Smithsonian Institution, the Fish Commis-
sion, the Interior Department, the Treasury Department, &c., for the
three great expositions already referred to.

Additional Museum Building.—The need of an additional Museum
building was fully. detailed in the last report, the demand for it being
very much greater now than before, in view of the immense additions
made by the regular sources of supply. Very many objects of great
interest and requiring a large space for their accommodation have been
promised by exhibitors at New Orleans, and it is a serious problem to
know where these can even be stored, aside from the possibility of: prop-
_erly displaying them. The full details in regard to the necessity of this
building will be found in the report of 1883.

Building for the Alcoholic Collections.—The presence of alcoholic speci-
mens in large numbers, so important in a scientific point of view, greatly
endangers the safety of museum buildings and their contents, and most
of the establishments in Europe have lately taken the precaution to
construct separate buildings peculiarly adapted for the purpose. An
application was made at the last session of Congress for an appropria-
tion to put up a similar building in the grounds of the Institution, but
it was not acted upon favorably. This item has been renewed in the
estimates for the coming fiscal year.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 1l
MEETINGS OF .SCIENTIFIC BODIES.

The Board of Regents, at its meeting in January, 1881, formally tend-
ered the use of the lecture-room and other accommodations in the Na-
- tional Museum to the National Academy of Sciences, and authorized
the executive committee to grant a similar courtesy to other national
organizations having the advancement of science as their object. Un-
der this arrangement the National Academy met on Tuesday, April 15,
and continued in session until Friday, April 18.

In addition to the facilities afforded to the National Academy of
Sciences, mentioned above, it was thought quite in accordance with its
relationships to the Smithsonian, especially as established since the res-
olution of the Board, above referred to, to give to the Academy the
use of one of the new rooms in the extension of the Smithsonian build-
ing for its archives, library, and other property. This has accordingly
been done, and two rooms have been assigned for the purpose. It has
proved to be a very great convenience to the officers of the Academy,
especially during its meetings in the adjacent National Museum building.

Among the most interesting meetings of 1884 in the National Museum,
of the national scientific societies, was that of the American Fish Cultu-
ral Association, which took place in May, it being the first convocation
it has ever held in the city of Washington. In addition to the association
itself, invitations were extended to the fish commissioners of nineteen
States, and a large attendance was the result. Many papers were pre-
sented, but the chief point of attraction was the opening to the public
of the fisheries section of the Museum, as arranged after the return of
a part of the collection from the International Fisheries Exhibition in
London. The Brush-Swan Company kindly put in sufficient plant to
illuminate the entire building, especially the fisheries section, and a
very large attendance was present on the occasion. The annual address
was delivered by Hon. Theodore Lyman, who was followed by Hon. 8S.
S. Cox and others. The meeting was varied by an excursion on the
steamer Fish Hawk to the shad-hatching grounds near Fort Washing-
ton, where the processes of treating the fish were duly exhibited.

LECTURES.

The success of the course of lectures delivered in 1883, in the lecture-
room of the National Museum, under the auspices of the Anthropolog-
ical and Biological Societies, induced those bodies to establish a second
course for 1884, and, as before, these were attended by large audiences.

The list of these lectures will be given under the head of National
Museum.

Toner Lectures.—It is known to the Board that an endowment was
made by Dr. John M. Toner, of Washington, of a fund, the interest of
which was to be appropriated in giving a series of lectures on some
subject pertaining to medicine, surgery, or public health; and, by an
12 . REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

arrangement made with my predecessor, these lectures are published
at the expense of the Smithsonian Institution, as a portion of the series
of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, and in that form distributed
to public libraries and to institutions having a common object with the

As it has been found quite impossible to supply gratuitously the large ~
demand from medical men and others for these lectures (in addition to
the liberal grant to the leading public libraries and other institutions
in this and foreign countries), the uniform price of 25 cents has been
fixed for each, by which probably their more equitable distribution will
be secured.

The rooms of the National Museum were occupied on March 19 for
the delivery of the ninth lecture of the foregoing series by Dr. Charles
K. Mills, of Philadelphia. A large and attentive audience was present
during the delivery, and the paper will be printed as soon as the re-
vision is received from the author.

ROUTINE WORK IN THE INSTITUTION.

The most important event of the year to be mentioned in this con-
nection is the occupation of the new rooms in the eastern range and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

wing of the Smithsonian building after their reconstruction, a work
which occupied about a year from its commencement in the spring of
1883.

For many years past the small number of rooms available for the ad-
ministrative offices of the Institution has greatly impeded its business
and interfered with the effectiveness of the work of all the employés.
_ The stock of publications was widely scattered in different parts of the
Smithsonian building, and the rooms were overcrowded with clerks and
assistants. The records were necessarily kept in places more or less
inconvenient of access, with a constant fear of their destruction and
that of other property of the Institution by fire in a building so con-
structed that should a fire break out it would be almost impossible to
prevent the combustion of the entire edifice. Thanks to the liberality
of Congress in furnishing the necessary means, these inconveniences
and dangers are all things of the past; the offices have been re-ar-
ranged, everything brought together in convenient approximation, and
every necessary provision made for the comfort of the employés and
the efficiency of their work.

The Secretary transferred his office from his temporary quarters in
the National Museum building early in May, and a few days after the
chief clerk, corresponding clerk, and others moved from their impro-
vised rooms in the lower hall of the Institution. By the end of the year
the work was finished and everything in good running order.

The personnel of the Institution continues to be the same as hereto-
fore, apart from the addition of one or two subordinate employés re
quired to meet the increase of work.

CORRESPONDENCE.

This continues to increase in about the usual ratio, and represents a
very large part of the operations of the Institution. The range of sub-
jects presented for consideration covers every branch of speculation
and of human knowledge; and there are very few subjects upon which
the advice and opinion of the Institution are not asked. In accordance
with its uniform rule, all communications are treated with respect; and
where the information asked for cannot be furnished directly, the let-
ter is referred to some expert.

EXPLORATIONS.

From the very beginning of its work a large part of the attention of
the Institution has been directed towards increasing our knowledge of
the physical condition and natural history of various parts of the globe,
especially on the continent of America, and almost every report con-
tains some account of work accomplished in this direction. No single
agency has done as much as the Smithsonian Institution in developing
a knowledge of the region ir question, whether as the result of observa-
pe REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tions prosevutcd entirely or partly at its own expense, or made at its
suggestion by Government expeditions and private parties. An exten-
sive correspondence and more or less intimate association with men of
science resident in the different localities has also been utilized to sug-
gest points of inquiry and invite the communication of information.

The year 1884 has been no exception to the statement just made. In-
deed, it is doubtful whether any of its predecessors has exceeded it in
the amount of results obtained. This is, of course, largely due, as in
many previous years, to the co-operation of the United States Signal
Service, under General Hazen; the United States Geological Survey
and the Bureau of Ethnology, under Major Powell; and the United
States Fish Commission.

As heretofore, I shall give in geographical sequence a short account
of the various expeditions and of their results, leaving the full account
of the collections themselves to be reported upon by Mr. Goode, the
Assistant Director of the NationaFMuseum.

Greenland.—The most interesting chapter of the exploration of Green-
land is that connected with the history of the Greely Relief Expedition,
which was fitted up by provision of Congress for the purpose of rescuing
Lieutenant Greely and his fellow members of the Signal Service from
their imprisonment in the Polar Seas. After the two futile attempts,
made in 1882 and 1883, to communicate with the International Arctie
station at Lady Franklin Bay, and to relieve Lieutenant Greely and his
command, a new expedition was organized by a special act of Congress,
at ap early date in 1884, under the direction of the Secretary of the Navy,
and Secretary of War. Subsequently the Dundee whaler ‘‘ Thetis” and
the ‘* Bear” of the Newfoundland sealing fleet, two stout steamers of 600
and 609 tons burden, were purchased by the Government, and taken to
the Brooklyn navy-yard to be overhauled and refitted. The English
Government generously presented the steamer “ Alert,” one of the ves-
sels of the late Arctic expedition under Captain George Nares, to be
used in the search, and the collier ‘‘ Loch Garry” was chartered to act
as tender. The expedition was placed under the command of Comman-
der W.S,. Schley, U.S. N., who selected the “Thetis” as flag-ship, and
under whose superintendence the squadron was thoroughly fitted out.

On April 23 the “Bear” left the United States bound for St. John’s,
Newfoundland, followed by the “Thetis” on May 1, and by the “Alert”
on the 10th of the same month. The “Thetis” arrived at Disco
on May 22, accompanied by the ‘Loch Garry,” where she learned
that the “Bear,” having reached that port on the 15th, had left the
day previous, to continue to Upernavik. Convoying the “ Loch Garry,”
the flag-ship sailed again from Disco on the 24th, touching five days
later at Upernavik, where she met her consort. In the afternoon all
the whalers which had gathered there left with the “Thetis” and
“ Bear,” the tender remaining behind to await the convoy of the “ Alert”

and a more favorable time for crossing Melville Bay, which was full
of heavy ice. The time between June 6th and 11th was spent at the
Duck Islands, looking in vain for an opening in the pack. Taking
advantage of every narrow lead the vessels fought their way through
the ice, now resorting to ramming and torpedoes to force a passage,
then tying up to the lee of a berg or to a heavy floe. By dint of labor
they finally came in sight of Gape York, but it was impossible to get
into open water before the 18th. Accompanied by two of the whalers
they then steamed on. The ‘ Bear” was signaled to push ahead and
send a party on shore to communicate with the natives. Nothing had
been heard here of Greely. Every place was searched where records
or people were likely to be found. The ‘ Bear” went to the Cary
Islands, the “Thetis” to Conical Rock, Wolstenholme and Saunders
Island, to Cape Parry, and finally to Littleton Island, where a cache was
found, but no tidings of the party. Now the impression became gen-
eral that the vessels would have to proceed to Lady Franklin Bay. Let-
ters were got ready to be sent home by the “ Alert,” when she should
return in the autumn, and on the 22d, 720 rations were cached. When
the ‘‘ Bear” arrived at noon it was decided to land 3,000 rations more
at Payer Harbor, and both vessels stood across through open water to
Cape Sabine, where Greely and the survivors of his command were found
in a starving condition. On July 17, the vessels, with the exception of
the “ Alert,” were at anchor again at St. John’s, Newfoundland.

Considering that the whole energy of the squadron had to be devo-
ted to the rescue of the Lady Franklin Bay party, the natural history
collections, made by the officers on various occasions, are richer than
might have been expected; the numerous photographs of the country,
of the natives, and the ice, in its various shapes and formations, will be
of lasting value.

The physical observations during the course of the expedition were
made part of the regular routine of the vessels. The natural history
work, however, was prosecuted by the naval ensigns who had been
sent by the Navy Department to the Smithsonian Institution specially
for the purpose of being trained for such duty. Among these were
Messrs. C. A. Harlow, A. A. Ackerman, and C.S. McClain. These gen-
tlemen had all been well trained at the Institution in the methods of
instantaneous photography, in taxidermy, and in the collecting of min-
erals and fossils; and although the time occupied by the expedition—
thanks to the energy of its commander, Captain Schley, and his associ-
ates—was very much less than had been anticipated, very interesting
and desirable collections were made by the gentlemen mentioned.

The landings were made, for the most part, at Disco, Upernavik,
Duck Island, Conical Rock, Camp Clay, &c., and the gatherings con-
sisted of rock specimens, minerals, fossils, numerous birds, and an ac-
ceptable collection of fishes and marine invertebrates in alcohol. The
photographic plates have not yet been developed, but will no doubt
16 “REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

show much of very great interest. These gentlemen all make acknowl-
edgment of the assistance given them in their work by the orders and
hearty good feeling of Captain Schley and the other officers in com-
mand.

The Greely Relief Expedition fully and entirely carried out its mis-
sion of restor:ng the survivors of the Greely party to their friends in
the United States. By far the greater part, however, of the apparatus
and collections made in the several years of absence was left behind at
Fort Conger, and may never be recovered. A few specimens were
brought home by Lieutenant Greely, but have not been received at the
National Museum.

Labrador.—The reports of 1882 and 1883 give full details of the work
prosecuted by Mr. L. M. Turner at Fort Chimo, Ungava Bay, in North-
ern Labrador, and full credit given to the Chief Signal Officer for his
encouragement to Mr. Turner to make collections of specimens in the
intervals of his duties of recording the meteorological and other physi-
cal phenomena of the region. Mr. Turner’s two years of detail expiring
in 1884, he returned to Washington and is now engaged in preparing his
report. In order to make the report complete, I subjoin a brief extract
prepared by him of his work during the two years:

‘Under letter of instructions of date of May 27,1882, from the Chief
Signal Office, United States Army, I departed from Washington June
1, 1832, for Montreal, where I remained until June 7th, and joined the
Hudson Bay Company’s schooner ‘Tropic’ at Quebec, and left there
June 8th for Rigolet, Labrador, where we arrived June 28th. At this
place Lremained until July 8th, and proceeded on the company’s steamer
‘Labrador’ for Davis’ Inlet, Labrador, where we arrived July 16th,
and remained fourdays. At these two stations I collected a great num-
ber of fishes, birds, plants, and insects. On the 21st of July we started
for Nakvak, Labrador, but were prevented by bad weather from enter-
ing that fiord, and continued around Cape Chidley, at the entrance of
Hudson Strait. After entering we immediately encountered heavy ice,
and were detained eleven days in Ungava Bay. We went on shore for
part of one day (July 31st) at the mouth of George’s River emptying
into that bay. On the 6th of August we ascended the Koksoak or
South River, and anchored at Fort Chimo, Ungava district of the Hud-
son Bay Company, where I was to establish a meteorological observa-
tion station for the Signal Service. The meteorological observations
were to be five in number daily at the following times: 7.35 A. M.; 11.35
A. M.; 3.35 P.M.; 7.35 P.M., and 11.35 Pp. M. A dwelling not being ready
for occupation, I was necessitated to await the completion of a building
intended for a blacksmith shop, which when finished was used by me
as dwelling and office until my final departure from Fort Chimo. Dur-
ing my stay at Fort Chimo I had an opportunity to ascend the Koksoak
River to the ‘Forks’ (junction of the North or Larch River with the
Koksoak and about 105 miles from the mouth of the latter river). Also
to the Falls, some 30 miles above the ‘Forks.’ These ‘ Falls’ were
visited for the purpose of photographing them. I again visited the
‘Forks’ for the purpose of obtaining winter resident birds, and while
on this trip I ascended the Larch or North River, and discovered a
small river flowing from the southwest into it. On this river, some 14
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

miles from its mouth, is a small falls of some 25 feet perpendicular,
affording one of the most picturesque scenes I ever viewed. On an-
other occasion I visited Whale River, to the east of the Koksoak about
50 miles, and on this trip passed the mouth of ‘False’ River, so named
because it is nothing but a cul de sac of about 40 miles length and run-
ning nearly parallel with the Koksoak. The tides exert such influence
on these rivers that navigation is extremely dangerous. The rise and
fall of the tides at the mouth of the Koksoak were determined by me
to be sixty-two feet and three inches.

“On the 4th of September, 1854, I left Fort Chimo, Ungava, on the
Hudson Pay Company’s steamer ‘ Labrador,’ to return to civilization.
We stopped for ten days at George’s River, Ungava district, to re-es-
tablish a trading station there for the Hudson’s Bay Company, leaving
there on the 14th for Nakvak, Labrador, where we arrived on the 16th,
and lett next day for Davis Inlet, where we arrived on the 19th and re-
mained until the 23d. We then started for Rigolet, Labrador, and ar-
rived there on the 25th, and left next day on the Newfoundland mail
steamer ‘ Hercules’ for Battle Harbor, Labrador, where we arrived
October 1, leaving next day for St. John’s, Newfoundland, on the
mail steamer ‘Plover,’ where we arrived October 6. While on these
two mail steamers we stopped at over one hundred fishing stations
along the Labrador and Newfoundland coast to call for and deliver
mail. On the 16th I left St. John’s for Halifax, where I arrived on the
18th, and took railway for Montreal, and arrived there on the 21st, and
left next day for Washington, where I arrived on the 23d. My leisure
time was employed at every locality visited, in collecting specimens of
natural history. The results are given approximately as below in round
numbers:

“ Of birds, 1,800 specimens ; eggs, 1,800 specimens ; fishes, 1,000 speci-
mens; mammals, 200 specimens; ethnological, 600 articles; plants, a
great number; insects, over 200,000; geological specimens, a great
variety ; Eskimo linguistics, over 500 pages of manuscript, embracing
thousands of words and over 800 sentences, which were obtained dur-
ing the winter nights and at other times when outdoor work could not
be done.

‘¢'To this should be added twenty-three months of continuous meteoro-
logical observations, taken and recorded at Fort Chimo, Ungava, which
have been already turned over to the Chief Signal Officer, United States
Army.

‘*To enable me to successfully prosecute these labors, I was by the
characteristic liberality of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
abundantly supplied with all necessary articles for procuring, preserv-
ing, and transmitting the results.”

Reference was made in a preceding report tothe work accomplished
by Dr. C. Hart Merriam in the investigation of the natural history of
the seals of the coast of Labrador. The arrangements made by Dr.
Merriam during his abode in Newfoundland and Labrador have fur-
nished him additional material during the present year, the results of
which he has kindly shared with the National Museum in the way of
skins and skeletons of several species of seals.

Arctie Coast.—Although we are unable to record quite so large ac-
quisitions from the Arctic coast as were obtained in the year 1882 from
S. Mis. 33——2
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

the Point Barrow Expedition of the Signal Service Bureau, under coiti-
mand of Lieutenant Ray, yet some interesting contributions have been
received. Captain Healy and officers of the revenue steamer Corwin
have supplied collections from Hotham Inlet and other points along
the coast, including numerous minerals, birds, fish, invertebrates, &ce.

The following summary of Captain Healy’s work has been furnished
through the Secretary of the Treasury, Hon. Hugh McCulloch:

“Captain Healy has, during the past season, visited with his com-
mand the new volcano on Bogoslov Island, of the Aleutian chain, in
longitude 168° W., which, after some years of quiet, recently became
active. He caused a survey of the island to be made by two of his
officers, who submitted a very interesting and valuable report, contain-
ing a detailed description of the large accession to the island thrown
up by the recent volcanic action, and through the aid of another officer
of the vessel obtained some excellent photographs of the voleano in its
various aspects. Later‘in the season Captain Healy sent a boat expedi-
tion up the Kowak River, which debouches through its delta into Ho-
tham Inlet, Kotzebue Sound. Lieutenant Cantwell, who conducted this
expedition, ascended the Kowak River a distance of 379 miles. He
submitted a report, showing a careful survey of the river for the dis-
tance named, and a very interesting discovery in a large deposit of
jade (nephrite) situated in a mountain (named in the native language
Ashoganok, meaning smooth stone,) lying a few miles north of the river.
Also a description of the flora and fauna of the river’s banks, accom-
panied with specimens. Assistant Engineer McLenegan, who accom-
panied him, submitted also a valuable list of birds of Northern Alaska
with descriptions and specimens. Lieutenant Cantwell made a fur-
ther detailed survey of Selaivrk Lake, tributary to the same inlet, ac-
companied with a well-executed chart of the region. This expedition
brings back the report that the precious metals are found in large
quantities among the high mountains which form the water-shed for the
Kowak, Kuryukuk, and perhaps Colville Rivers.”

Lieut. George M. Stoney, U.S. N., of the schooner ‘ Ounalaska,” who
had visited Arctic America and explored Hotham Inlet and the rivers
entering into it, obtained an interesting series of rocks from the volcano
in Behring’s Sea. The collections made byhim have not, however, yet
come to hand.

Both Captain Healy and Lieutenant Stoney have furnished specimens
of the crude jade, or jade-like material so much used by the natives of
Arctic America for ornaments and weapons.

The Pacific Steam Whaling Company’established during the year a
depot at Cape Lisburne, with Mr. D. Woolfe in command, for the pur-
pose of mining coal for the use of the whalers, and specimens of this
coal and of the associated fossils have been furnished by Mr. Woolfe.
Miscellaneous collections of the natural history of the region are ex-
pected from that gentleman during the year 1885.

The North Pacific_—Reference was made in a previous report to the
very important work accomplished by Dr. L. Stejneger, under the direc-
tion of the Signal Office and the Smithsonian Institution, in Kamtschatka
and the adjacent group of the Commander Islands. Through the cour-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

tesy of Governor Grebnitski, in command of these islands, a number of
additional collections were received.

Dr. Stejneger also received from Captain Hunter some skins and
skeletons of the mountain sheep of Kamtschatka, filling an important
desideratum.

Alaska.—As in previous years, the additions to our knowledge of the
natural history and ethnology of Alaska have been very considerable,
owing to the continuation of explorations of the different parts of that
extensive Territory. The station of the Signal Service at Nushagak, on
Bristol Bay, which was so well worked up by Mr. C. L. McKay, was
subseqnently re-established after his death by drowning, by Mr. J. W.
Johnson, from whom a collection of birds was lately received, which
was specially noteworthy as containing specimens of the Alaska wil-
low wren and of the yellow wagtail, representing a locality many hun-
dreds of miles further south than St. Michael’s, the place of previous
record.

Lieut. T. Dix Bolles, on board the U.S. 5S. “Adams,” during its pe-
riod of service at Sitka, used all opportunities in his power to enrich
the National Museum by his contributions, and became so much inter-
ested in his work that he sought and obtained a transfer, through the
favor of the Navy Department, to the steamer “ Pinta,” which replaced °
the “Adams” during the past summer. At latest advices he was still
engaged in his scientific work.

Mr. John J. McLean, of the Signal Service, stationed at Sitka, has
secured many ethnological objects of great rarity.

Mr. W. J. Fischer, who is stationed by the Coast Survey at Kodiak,
has used many opportunities both there and in the adjacent regions to
continue his important work ; this, including much information in re-
gard to the manners and characteristics of the native tribes.

From the Rev. J. Loomis Gould a collection of Indian carvings and
other articles of ethnology were obtained, representing some quite new
forms of aboriginal construction.

British Columbia and Washington Territory.—For the purpose of in-
creasing material for the needs of the National Museum and its repre-
sentation at the New Orleans Exposition, the services of Mr. James
G. Swan, of Port Townsend, were secured to visit various parts of
Alaska and British Columbia. His collections, as received so far, have
been, as usual, very interesting and important. During a visit to Vic-
toria in the interest of this service, he was invited to deliver a lecture
before the legislature upon his observations made in 1883 in Queen
Charlotte Islands, and having obtained permission from the Institution
for the purpose, he complied with the request.

The specialties of Mr. Swan’s collection consist of very full illustra-
tions of the whaling apparatus and outfit, including boats, Wc., used
by the Haidah Indians.
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

A valuable monograph by Mr. Swan, upon the ethnology of the Hai-
dah Indians, which had been contributed to the Treasury Department,
was transmitted by its Secretary for publication in the reports of the
Bureau of Ethnology.

Oregon and California.—From Oregon the most noteworthy collec-
tions are those furnished by Capt. Charles Bendire, at Fort Klamath,
to whose important contributions and services to the Fish Commission
full detailed reference is made in another part of the report.

The returns from California consist in large part of numerous collec-
tions of shells, minerals, fossils, and archeological objects from Mr. R.
E. C. Stearns, recently appointed as Curator of Conchology in the Na- ~
tional Museum. In transferring his effects from San Francisco to Wash-
ington he brought with him a very large series of specimens, of which
he has made a present to the National Museum.

Other specimens are birds from Mr. L. Belding, and fossils from Mr.
C. BR. Orcutt.

- Mr. Charles H. Townsend, connected with the fishery establishment
at Baird, Shasta County, California, has made and supplied the most
extensive series of collections of mammals ever received from the State
of California, all in most admirable preservation and specially adapted
for mounting. The collection also embraces numerous skins, skele-
tons, and skulls of the various sea lions and seals from the Farralone
Islands, and an additional collection of sea elephants from South Cali-
fornia is now on its way. In addition to this there are a large number
of skins of birds, fossils, and other objects of interest.

Arizona and New Mexico.—These Territories have been particularly
well represented during the year; the former by the large number of
skins of mammals, birds, and other objects of interest furnished by Mr.
E. W. Nelson; the latter by an enormous collection of modern Indian
pottery and other articles, which, when packed, represented a bulk of
many thousand cubic feet. These collections made under the auspices
of the Bureau of Ethnology, and others obtained by Mr. James Steven-
son under similar direction, may be considered as exhausting all possi-
ble demand for such articles from the region in question, and, in fact,
represent a series that can never be duplicated. The articles obtained
represent for the most part nearly all those that have been used by the
Indians for many years. All others now procurable are of more modern
make, and in large part fabricated to meet the demands of travellers
along the routes of the new lines of railways, and being made espe-
cially in great haste for sale, are very inferior both in material and dec-
oration.

Some contributions to the fauna of New Mexico were supplied by
Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, of the Army, from his station at Fort Wingate.

Mr. BE. W. Nelson has furnished the following account of his explora-
tions and collections in Arizona during 1884:
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. oA

“ When I reached Tucson in January, 1884, it was midwinter, but the
only evidence of the fact there, lay in the leafless vegetation and the
frosty nights. Thin ice formed quite frequently on the borders of stag-
nant pools. The days were warm and pleasant, as a rule, much like the
‘ Indian-summer’ days of autumn in the eastern States.

“Prairie dogs and other mammals, that hibernate during winter in
more northern latitudes, are found full of activity at all seasons in this
portion of Arizona. :

““Tueson is situated on a large basin-like plain with groups of mount-
ains on every side, from 10 to 30 or 40 miles distant. It is also located
near the eastern border of the region covered by the giant cactus, with
several species of birds having their range within about the same
limits.

‘‘ Various other species of cactus abound, and, with the mesquite
woods and the cottonwoods and elder trees along the bottoms near the
streams, form the most conspicuous part of the vegetation. The gen.
eral aspect of the country surrounding Tucson is very desert-like, al-
though covered with scrubby and thorny bushes, yet it is a favorite
resort for birds, and is probably the richest field for the ornithologist
north of the Mexican border.

“During the four months following my arrival at Tucson, my attention
was given to securing a series of the birds found there, with gratifying
success. Perhaps the most notable of the captures consisted of a fine
series of the resident race of song sparrow, by the aid of which Mr.
Henshaw was enabled to decide that the song sparrow of Southern Ari-
zona is a resident. form peculiar to that region, and to which properly
appertains the name of Melospiza fasciata fallax ; while the song spar-
row of the Rocky Mountain region in general, which has heretofore
been known as fallax, was in reality an undescribed form to which Mr.
Henshaw has given the name of Melosptza fasciata montana.

‘A series of the rare Harporhynchus bendirei was also taken, inelud-
ing the young in first plumage.

“It having been discovered that the deserted holes of Colaptes chry-
soides and Centurus uropygialis in the trunks of the giant cactus were
resorted to by the little-known Whitney’s owl (Microthene Whitney?)
and the southern screech ow! (Scops trichopsis), a number of these birds
were captured by cutting down the cactus stems and taking the birds
from their holes.

‘Later in the season, during the last of May, a portable ladder some
eighteen feet long was used to good purpose in securing the birds and
their eggs. The giant cactus is frequently from thirty to forty feet high
in that vicinity, and the old woodpecker holes are placed so high that
one had very often to stand on the extreme upper end of the ladder with
one arm embracing the thorny cactus and the other hand employed in
cutting out the entrance of the hole to admit the hand. This style of
work is very successful, and, although two men are required to do it,
one can count upon finding an ow! in about every fourth or fifth hole
examined in a good locality. The same proportion holds good when
hunting eggs in the nesting season. The vicinity of streams is the most
productive field. Toward the end of May the heat became very oppress-
ive, and early in June I made camp on the eastern slope of the Santa
Rita Mountains, about sixty miles southeast of Tucson. My camp was
in the live-oak belt at about 5,000 feet above the sea-level. Here I
found a much cooler’ temperature and a number of birds not seen
before. The breeding season was nearly over, though | was fortunate
enough to secure a fine nest and set of eggs of the black-throated gray

warbler (Dendreca nigrescens). Fine series of the Arizona jay (Cya-
nocitta sordida), the Strickland’s woodpecker (Picus stricklandi), Law-
rence’s flycatcher (Myiarchus lawrencet), and of other species of greater
or less rarity were secured here.

‘The Scott’s oriole (Icterus parisorum) was found rather common but
extremely shy there, and a number of skins were taken. Above the
oak belt on this small group of mountains is a sparsely timbered belt
of pines reaching to the summit, at about 10,000 feet altitude. The
deer, bears, and peccaries, or ‘musk-hogs,’ as they are called locally,
were once very numerous in these mountains, but the occupation of
every permanent spring or creek by ranchmen, and the presence of
prospectors at all seasons, has nearly driven the game from these hills.

‘The vicinity of my camp, near Gardiner’s ranch, is probably the
very best location for a collector that these mountains afford and is a
rich field for the ornithologist. From this camp, in company with two
friends, an excursion was made toward the Mexican border into a low
bottom. This bottom is heavily wooded with cottonwoods and other
trees and is a notoriously malarial region. It is full of birds, but who-
ever ventures there to do any extended work must be ague-proof. In
this bottom the blue grosbeak was very common, as many as fifteen or
twenty being seen on some days. At the head of this valley, in the
open grassy flats, the Arizona sparrow (Peuccea arizona) was very abund-—
ant, and its sweet song was heard from morning till night.

“The middle of July I broke camp and moved about fwenty-five miles
southeast to Camp Huachuea, at the base of the Huachuca Mountains.
Very little was done here, as the mountains and their faunas were very
sinilar, and nothing, not taken before, was seen. Both the Santa Rita
and Huachuca Mountains are poorly watered ; and although special at-
tention was not given to hunting for ruins or other evidences of ancient
occupation by Indians, yet nothing of the kind having been found in my
tramps after birds would indicate a paucity of such remains; nor could
the prospectors familiar with these mountains name any such ruins.
In August I returned to Tueson for a few days and made a flying visit
to the Papago Indian Reservation, nine miles south of town, at the old
mission of San Xavier. ThereI secured samples of their pottery and
other of their manufactures, such as the few natives present could be
induced to part with. These natives make the large porous water-jars
with which every house is supplied in Southern Arizona. The women
mix the clay with horse-dung and then mold it up by hand into the
tall, gracefully-shaped jars, smoothing 1t on the surface with a small
wooden trowel. The pot is then baked in a hot fire, and the parti-
cles of dung being burned out, the requisite porosity is Obtained.
When filled with water the fluid oozes slowly through the sides and
bottom of the jar, and if kept in a shaded spot the rapid evaporation
from the surface keeps the water inside cool and palatable in the hot-
test weather. This jar is almost a necessity in every household in the
hot southern region where ice is almost unknown. ‘The Papagoes of
San Xavier derive a considerable income from the sale of these jars.
The women hawk them about the streets of Tucson and sell them for
twenty-five cents each. This is certainly not an exorbitant price for a
jar that will hold from five to ten gallons, and which the seller has packed
nine miles, upon her back, into town.

“The intensely hot weather caused me to leave Tucson after a very
short stay there, and the 20th of August found me located at Springer-
ville, at the eastern base of the White Mountains, and at an altitude of
about 6,500 feet. The change from the arid, sun-baked plains of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

southern part of the Territory to the green hills and magnificent pine
forests of this vicinity was a marked and welcome one. The tempera-
ture here at that time was also cool and very pleasant. I*or several
weeks after my arrival here my health was unusually poor, owing to the
debilitating effect of the heat experienced earlier in the season, but
recovering from this, I passed the remainder of the fall in making hunt-
ing excursions in various directions from Springerville as a center, for
the purpose of securing a series of deer and antelope skins for the Na-
tional Museum.

“Although the mountains about here have been noted for the abun-
dance of large game in them during past years, yet all kinds of large
game were remarkably scarce during the past season. Such being the
case, it required much longer hunting and more work to secure the de-
sired game than had been anticipated.

‘“‘ Bear were not to be found at all, and elk were so scarce that only a
single fresh track was seen during several weeks in the woods. A\l-
though the cattlemen have invaded this district in force, yet they have
only touched the pine country at widely separated places, and Iam un-
able to account for the scarcity of large game.

“The mountains of this range are well watered by creeks and springs,
and from 6,500 feet altitude up to timber line they are covered with a
fine growth of pines, with aspens, and other trees common to high alti-
tudes in this region, intermingled on the higher ridges. There is
scarcely any undergrowth but a dense mat of grass and flowers in these
forests, and beautiful mountain parks are found at frequent intervals.
These parks vary in size from the tiny glades a few yards across to
broad savannas miles in extent, and the country would appear to be a
sportsman’s paradise were not the game unaccountably absent.

‘While at Springerville some time was devoted to examining va-
rious old ruins in the vicinity, along the valley of the Little Colorado
River. The sites of old stone-walled houses, frequently showing the
outlines of several rooms, are common, but only fragments of broken
pottery, with an occasional mortar, are found lying about them. Two
rooms were cleaned out in one ruin, but the results were discouragingly
meager, as only a bone awl, a hammer-stone, and a shell ornament re-
warded two days’ hard work.

‘‘Along the base of the lava bluffs bordering the valley occur masses
of huge, angular blocks of lava, lying as they fell from the cliff in
rough masses, and among which are large crevices, frequently leading
into irregular chambers and sheltered nooks among the rocks. In these
were found much broken pottery, and by careful search nearly all the
fragments of several pots were secured. Some old bows, arrows, and
other sticks, with the paint still bright upon them, were found in dry
spots.

“An old cave in the sandstone on the river, about 15 miles below
Springerville, yielded an old pot, some reeds prepared for arrows, a war
club, and some spear and arrow-tips. This cave had a great mass of
bows and arrows stored in it, when found by the Mexicans some years
ago; but the finders fired the pile, and nearly everything was reduced
to ashes. Another cave, located about thirty-five miles west of Spring-
erville, is a long, forked passage in the lava rock at the far end of which
the discoverers secured a fine lot of pottery a couple of years ago. At
the time of my visit nothing remained except traces of a fire where the
pottery had been found. The bottom of the cave is covered with a layer
of fine clay, such as the pottery was made from.
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

“From the boy who found the cave I secured a few pot-covers and
other specimens, which he took from the cave after his first find.

‘¢ The season’s work has resulted in a collection of over fifty skins and
skulls of mammals, eighteen of which are of deer and antelope; over
one thousand bird skins, and eighty birds’ eggs; about one hundred
and fifty ethnological specimens, and some alcoholic specimens of fishes
and mammals.”

Eastern Portion of the United States—Very large numbers of collec-
tions from the eastern portion of the United States have also been re-
ceived, but as having less relation to additions to our knowledge of the
natural history and ethnology of the region, they are less noteworthy in
the present portion of the report. Ishould, however, especially mention
the exploration of the fresh-water fish fauna of the Mississippi Valley
made by Professors Jordan and Gilbert in behalf of the New Orleans
International Exposition. As aspecially desirable presentation on that
occasion, it was determined to show as fully as possible the fishery
resources of the region at the outlet of which New Orleans is situated,
and to furnish, if possible, every kind of fish known to inhabit the
waters of the great river. Several months were occupied in this serv-
ice, and many hundreds of species obtained and prepared for exhibi-
tion. With a somewhat similar object Dr. Palmer was detailed for
service in Florida with special reference to securing collections of the
corals of the Florida Keys and the Tortugas. Henry Hemphill also
assisted in making collections of the invertebrates of Florida.

The display made under the auspices of the National Museum at
New Orleans of the economical and attractive natural history of the
Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi Valley were in great part made
especially for the occasion, and will constitute a noteworthy feature in
the history of American science.

As usual, the collections made under the auspices of the United
States Fish Commission along the eastern coast of the United States
have been noteworthy in value and extent, resulting from the continual
research at the station at Wood’s Holl, and especially from the labors
of the Fish Commission steamer ‘‘Albatross” in the deep waters off the
coast. Here, as in previous years, the occasion has been taken to secure
large numbers of duplicate specimens for distribution, as educational
material, to colleges and academies.

A subsidiary research of the Fish Commission in this connection was
accomplished by sending Dr. T. H. Bean to Long Island to explore the
adjacent waters, especially those of the Great South Bay, and this re-
sulted in making some discoveries of scientific interest as well as of
practical importance.

The West Indies—Many important contributions to our knowledge of
these regions have been made during the year, the most noteworthy
being the gatherings in the Caribbean Sea and the adjacent islands,
made by the Fish Commission steamer ‘“‘ Albatross,” which was detailed
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

to the service of the Navy Department at its request. The vessel was
also engaged in making soundings between the south side of the West
Indies and the north coast of South America, resulting in determin-
ing the character of the sea bottom with great precision and establish-
ing the existence of a number of unexpected reefs and shoals of great
depths, which have been indicated in a model of the bottom of the Ca-
ribbean, made by direction of Captain Bartlett, of the Hydrographic
Office of the Navy. General collections were made of the land fauna
as well as of the marine, resulting in the addition of a very great num-
ber of species to the National Museum, of which a noted proportion are
of scientific interest. Among these may be mentioned eight new spe-
cies of birds found on the islands of Curagoa and Old Providence.

Professor Poey has continued his contributions of fishes from Cuba,
and has, in all, supplied a noteworthy proportion of the hundreds of
species known to occur in the vicinity of that island.

Dr. Nichols, of Dominica, has continued his donations of birds, mol-
lusks, &e., while from Mr. Morris, director of the public gardens and
plantations in Jamaica, many samples of valuable fibers have been
secured.

Mexico and Central America.—Professor Alfred Dugés, of Guanajuato,
Mexico, has continued his transmissions of objects of natural history,
among them being some rare species of birds, &c. Mr. McLeod, of
Jesus Maria, in Mexico, has also furnished some rare birds.

As an ethnological contribution, Mr. Romero, the Mexican minister,
supplied a series of the playing cards and other gambling implements
of the Mexican Indians.

The services of Mr. Aymé, late consul at Merida, were secured to
prosecute some investigations into the ethnology of Yucatan and West-
ern Mexico, especially with a view of showing the relationships between
the habits and manufactures of the Indians of those regions and those
of the southern portion of the United States. Several large collections
have already been received from him, and others of still greater moment
are on the way.

Other collections, especially of birds, from Yucatan have been fur-
nished by Mr. Gaumer.

On the oceasion of establishing the boundary line between Guate-
mala and Mexico, the services of Prof. Miles Rock, of the Washington
Observatory, as astronomer, were secured by Guatemala, and he was
provided with a photographic apparatus, furnished by the Smithsonian
Institution, and many interesting views of scenery were obtained and
forwarded to the Institution.

Among the least known portions of Central America is the region
along the eastern coast of Honduras and the adjacent islands, and the
offer of Mr. Allstrom, an American engaged in mining researches in
that country, to make collections of natural history, &c., was gladly
accepted. No returns, however, have yet been received from him.
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In addition to the articles already mentioned, a valuable series of the
illustrations of the animal and vegetable kingdoms of Guatemala and
Salvador were secured from the Government commissioners of those
countries to the foreign exhibition held in Boston in the autumn of
1883. These, with similar collections under similar auspices obtained
from Venezuela and Brazil, were packed up in the early part of the
year 1884, under the immediate direction of one of the employés of the
National Museum, and transferred to the National Museum at Wash-
ington, where they will constitute an important addition to the collec-
tion.

Costa Rica.—As in previous years, Costa Rica has been well repre-
sented by the contributions of Mr. J. C. Zeledon, for many years in the
service of the National Museum, his transmissions consisting of speci-
mens of medicinal plants, of birds, of vertebrated animals, and of eth-
nology. Through his courtesy the National Museum is enriched with
an almost complete representation of the mammal and bird fauna of
that country.

Mr. R. Iglesias, of Chiriqui, has contributed some antiquities and
modern pottery.

Reference was made in the last report to the large collection of antiq-
uities, especially of sepulchral pottery, obtained in Chiriqui by Mr. J.
A. MeNeil, and secured through Messrs. Lamson & Bros., of New
York. An additional collection was made during the year under the
same auspices.

Nicaragua.—Among the most interesting and least known portions of
Nicaragua is the central region, between the Upper San Juan and Lake
Nicaragua. A short sojourn there has furnished to Mr. C. C. Nutting
quite a number of new species of birds. Mr. Nutting’s success induced
Dr. Walter Van Fleet to arrange for an expedition to that region under
the patronage of the Smithsonian Institution. Duly provided with let-
ters from the Institution, and with certain arrangements for facilitating
his work, Dr. Van Fleet proceeded to Aspinwall; but while waiting the
arrival of the steamer from Greytown he was taken ill, and obliged to
return to his home in Pennsylvania. He hopes, however, at an early
date to renew the experiment.

South America.—Interesting collections representing the natural prod-
ucts of the animal and vegetable kingdoms of Venezuela and Brazil
were secured from the Governments of Venezuela and Brazil. Dr. Will-
iam H. Jones, surgeon on the naval vessel stationed on the west coast
of Guiana, has contributed some extremely important collections of the
antiquities and natural history of the coast of Peru and Chili, and to
some extent of the Galapagos Islands. Many of the antiquities are of
unusual forms are of great rarity.

Mr. Kiefer, of Lima, has also made similar contributions.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27

Professor Nation, an eminent naturalist of Peru, has sent some types
of rare and undescribed species of birds of that country.

Dr. William N. Crawford, of the U. S. 8. “Shenandoah,” has also
contributed some rare shells from the west coast of Terra del Fuego and
the Straits of Magellan.

Hurope.—Large numbers of articles, both in single and collective
series, have been received from Europe, but as being derived from pub-
lie museums and not having any specially geographical significance, are
not mentioned here, but will be enumerated in detail in the report of
the Assistant Director of the National Museum.

It may, however, be well to refer to the arrangement made with Mr.
J. Gwyn Jeffries, of London, by which his magnificent collection of
recent and fossil shells of Europe has been acquiréd by the National
Museum and in large part received by it, several boxes of specimens
coming to hand during the year 1884. This is by far the most valu-
able private collection of European shells in existence, and especially
important in possessing so many types of the deep-sea species dredged
in the North Atlantic, and of great value for the determination of the
collections of the United States Fish Commission.

Among contributors to the European collections may be mentioned
the Royal College of Surgeons, the South Kensington Museum, the
British Museum, the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, in England; the
Museums of Berlin and Dresden, in Germany; of Copenhagen, in Den-
mark; of Bergen, in Norway, &ce.

Asia.—The collections from Asia have been of unusual significance
and importance. Reference has already been made to the accessions
from Kamtchatka and the Commander Islands as having been obtained
through the efforts of Dr. Stejneger, whose personal collections in those
countries were dwelt upon in the last report.

Mr. P. L. Jouy, a former employé of the National Museum, and resi-
dent for a number of years in Japan, continued his researches in that
country, and has supplied a large number of species of mammals and
birds of that region, together with other species of animals. The col-
lection of birds being taken in connection with a series presented by
Mr. Thomas Blackiston, who spent many years in Japan, gives to the
National Museum one of the most complete collections of Japanese
birds in existence, and one great in value in view of their relationships
to the birds of Western North America. Mr. Jouy has since trans-
ferred the field of his researches to Corea, although none of his collee-
tions have so far come to hand.

Rey. C. H. A. Dall has furnished some samples of fibers and other na-
tive products of the Indian, and the greater part of the exhibit of the
' Foreign Exhibition in Boston made by Ceylon; while a very valuable
collection of musical instruments of East India, and other objects rep-
resenting a high money value, were contributed by the Rajah of Tagore.
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Africa.—This country is represented by a few objects of art and in-
dustry, while from New Guinea the collection of weapons, implements,
&e., obtained from Mr. A. P. Goodwin, has added very greatly to our
representation of that little known island.

Madagascar.—Much attention has been directed to explorations in
Madagascar. Lieut. M. A. Shufeldt, of the Navy, left Norfolk a year or
two ago on the “ Enterprise,” and was enabled to leave theshipand spend
some time in Madagascar. On this occasion he made a large number of
photographic negatives, which were sent to the Smithsonian Institution .
for development, a set of the prints having been presented to the National
Museum. ‘These contained most interesting illustrations of the life, cus-
toms, and physiognomy of the people, as well as of the scenery which
they inhabit.

The Sandwich Islands.—The greater part of the exhibit made by the
Hawaiian Government at the Boston Foreign Exhibition was secured
and transferred to the National Museum. These, with the many speci-
mens brought home by the Wilkes expedition in its famous cruise, ren-
der the representation of that country very full and complete.

PUBLICATIONS.

Not much has been done during the year in the printing and distribu-
tion of special publications by the Smithsonian Institution, although the
activity of the National Museum in this respect has been very great.
It is expected, however, that during the year 1885, quite a number of
volumes will be printed and issued to institutions and libraries in cor-
respondence with it; these to appear in one or other of the three series,
‘‘ Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,” in quarto (of which 23 vol-
umes have been printed), the ‘‘ Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,”
in octavo (now numbering 27 volumes), and the annual “ Reports” of the
Institution, extending from 1847 to 1882, inclusive.

The ‘“ Sinithsonian Contributions” and ‘ Miscellaneous Collections”
include all publications made primarily under the auspices of the Na-
tional Museum, as well as the annual “ Proceedings” of the three princi-
pal societies of Washington, namely, the Philosophical, the Anthropolog-
ical, and the Biological Societies. The societies in question pay for
the type-setting of their volumes, and print an edition for distribution
tion to their own members. The Smithsonian Institution, however,
charges itself with supplying these books to public libraries and learned
societies at home and abroad, and has the pages stereotyped, and the
usual edition of 1,500 copies printed at its own expense.

The first publication made by the Smithsonian Institution, nearly
forty years ago, consisted of a memoir by Messrs. Squier and Davis
upon the ancient monuments of the Mississippi Valley, a work which |
marks the initial point of the great advancement made in the depart-
ment of archeology in later years, ‘The subject continues to be one
of much interest to the Institution, special attention having been
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

given to Securing as complete a series of archxological specimens
as possible for preservation in the National Museum. fF or several
years past Dr. Rau, the curator of the Department of Archeology, has
been working in the direction of further publications on this subject;
a valuable paper prepared by him having been printed in 1876, for use
in connection with the Centennial Exhibition, and which has since
then been the principal manual of information on the subject.

Dr. Rau is also superintending the preparation of drawings, by Mr.
C. F. Trill and others, of all the typical forms of stone implements and
objects not already figured in the Smithsonian publications. This is a
work of great magnitude, but it is hoped to commence the publication
of a new and systematic memoir at an early date.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.—Of the quarto series of pub-
lications no volume has been actually published during the year. A
memoir by Dr. Charles Rau on “ Prehistoric Fishing in Europe and
North America,” as illustrated by the archeological specimens collected
by the Institution, comprising about 350 quarto pages, has, however,
been put entirely into type, and, on the completion of an index, will be
issued.

The title of this work sufficiently explains its purport. The descrip-
tive portion is altogether based on existing antiquities bearing either
unmistakably or presumably on fishing in prehistoric times, and no con-
clusions whatever have been drawn exceeding the somewhat narrow
compass limited, as it were, by those tangible tokens. If the work had
been exclusively designed for persons well acquainted with the results
of prehistoric investigation in Europe, the author might have consid-
erably abbreviated its first part by excluding much introductive and
descriptive matter. But as it also may be read by non-archologists,
he has deemed it proper to dwell on the differences between the palo-
lithic and neolithic ages, to give accounts of the tool and bone bearing
drift-beds, the cave-habitations, artificial shell-deposits, lake-dwellings,
and, finally, to present a brief characterization of the bronzeage. Most
of these introductions are followed by a section, or sections, devoted to
notices of fish-remains, descriptions of fishing implements and utensils,
and suggestions in regard to the probable methods of fishing during the
period under consideration. The curious tracings of fishes and aquatic
mammals, characteristic of the reindeer-period, are treated in a sepa-
rate division.

In the first section of the second part, relating to prehistoric fishing
in North America, the available relics bearing on fishing, such as
straight bait-holders, fish-hooks, harpoon and arrow heads, nets, sinkers,
and fish-eutters, are described and figured, most of the objects being
specimens in the United States National Museum. Boats and their ap-
purtenances are next considered, and then follows an account of some
prehistoric structures connected with fishing. In the subsequent di-
BO... REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

vision plastic and graphic representations of fishes, aquatic animals,
&c., are treated, and finally a somewhat extended account of artificial
shell-deposits in various parts of North America is given.

Pages 261 to 518 contain extracts from various writings of the 16th,
17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, in which reference is made to aboriginal
fishing in North America.

In an appendix of 17 pages notices of fishing implements and fish-
representations discovered south of Mexico are given.

The volume embraces, without the index, xvi, 335 pages, and is
illustrated with a frontispiece and 405 figures in the text. Nearly all
the illustrations have been specially drawn for the work.

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.—Iin continuation of a former
series, vol. VI of the ‘“‘ Bulletin of the Philosophical Society of Wash-
ington” has been published as No. 543. It comprises the proceedings
of the society for the year 1883 (from the meeting of January 3 to
that of December 19), and forms an octavo volume of Lit pp. introduc-
tory + 168 pp., including an index; in all, 220 pp.

No. 544 of Smithsonian publications in like manner comprises the
‘Transactions of the Anthropological Society of Washington.” Vol.
11, from February 1, 1882, to May 15, 1883; forming an octavo volume
of x11I+ 211 pp.; in all, 224 pp.

No. 561 is a reprint of an article by General J. H. Simpson, U.S. A.,
on * Coronado’s March in Search of the ‘Seven Cities of Cibola,’ and
Discussion of their probable Location,” originally published in the
Smithsonian Report for 1869. This interesting memoir had never been
separately published, and the frequent inquiries for it seemed to justify
its reproduction. It forms an octavo pamphlet of 34 pp., illustrated by
a sketch map of Mexico (2 pp., 8vo), indicating the route pursued by
Coronado and his army, which extended as far north as the fortieth
parallel of latitude, near the present boundary separating the State of
Kansas from that of Nebraska.

No. 571 is ‘Check List of Publications of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion from December, 1881, to March, 1884.” 8vo, 8 pp.

No. 573 is ‘Price List of Publications of the Smithsonian Institution”
to March, 1884. 8vo, 7 pp.

No. 574 is “An Account of the Progress in Astronomy in the year
1883.” By Prof. Edward 8S. Holden. An octavo pamphlet of 78 pp.
This forms part of the annual scientific record which has for some years
past been prepared at the expense of the Institution for the Smithson-
ian report.

No. 575 is “An Account of the Progress in Geology in the year 1883.”
By Dr. T. Sterry Hunt. 8vo pamphlet of 22 pp.

No. 576 is “An Account of the Progress in Geography in the year

No. 580 is “An Account of the Progress in Mineralogy in the year
1883.” By Prof. Edward 8. Dana. 8vo pamphlet of 19 pp.

No. 581 is “An Account of the Progress in Botany in the year 1883.”
By Prof. William G. Farlow. 8vo pamphlet of 18 pp.

There has also been reprinted an edition of No. 34 (originally pub-
lished in March, 1859): ‘‘ Directions for Collecting, Preserving, and
Transporting Specimens of Natural History.” Third edition. 8vo
pamphlet of 40 pp.

Forest Trees— Among the earliest objects receiving the attention of
the Smithsonian Institution was the preparation of a work upon the
“ Forestry of North America,” under the direction of Dr. Gray, and for
which quite a number of plates were prepared more than thirty years
ago.

In part the cost of the publication and in part the pressure of other
duties upon Professor Gray have prevented the completion of this me-
moir; and a proposition having been made by Prof. C. 8. Sargent, of
Brookline, Mass., to take up and complete the work, the same was
accepted, and Mr. Faxon was authorized to make the necessary draw-
ings of the trees from living or fresh specimens. The magnitude, how-
ever, of this undertaking proved to be a little more than the Institution
could compass, and an arrangement has recently been made with Pro-
fessor Sargent to refund the cost of these drawings and to receive them,
so that he may use them in the publication which he has arranged to
make with a private publisher.

Among the treatises in preparation for publication by the Institution
may first be mentioned the beginning of a complete work on the “ Bot-
any of North America,” by Prof. Asa Gray.

Part II is in press. It comprises the Gamopetalous orders from
Caprifoliacee to Composite, inclusive. An enumeration by the author
indicates that of the Caprifoliacee there are 8 genera and 47 species ; of
Rubiacew, 26 genera and 86 species; of Valerianacee, 2 genera and 22
species; of Dipsacacew, 1 genus and 2 species (naturalized) ; of Compos-
ite, 237 genera and 1,610 species. It will form an octavo volume of
nearly 500 pages.

Bulletins of the National Museum.—As explained in the last annual re-
port, asupplementary edition of the Bulletins of the United States Na-
tional Museum, from the stereotype plates issued under the direction of
the honorable Secretary of the Interior, is printed at the expense of the
Institution, and is included in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collec-
tions. Seven scientific monographs on the geology and on the flora and
fauna of Bermuda, extracted from Bulletin No. 25 of the Museum series,
have been thus reproduced during the year.

“The Geology of Bermuda, by William North Rice, Ph. D.” (No. 563
39 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of the Smithsonian publications), forms an octavo pamphlet of 32 pages.

“The Botany of Bermuda, by General Sir John Henry Lefroy, F. R.
8.” (No. 564), forms an octavo pamphlet of 109 pages, illustrated with 5
wood-cut plates.

‘‘The Mammals of Bermuda, by J. Matthew Jones, F. R. 8. C.” (No.
565), forms an octavo pamphlet of 19 pages.

“The Birds of Bermuda, by Capt. Saville G. Reid, F. Z.S.” (No.
566), forms an octavo pamphlet of 117 pages.

‘‘On a Bird new tothe Bermudas, with Notesupon several species of
rare or accidental occurrence in these islands, by Clinton Hart Merriam,
M. D.” (No. 567), forms an octavo pamphlet of 4 pages.

“The Reptiles of Bermuda, by Samuel Garman” (No. 568), forms a
pamphlet of 19 pages, illustrated with 6 wood-cut plates, containing91
figures.

Annelida from Bermuda, by H. E. Webster (No. 569), forms an octavo
of 26 pages.

Proceedings of the National Museum.—This series (as heretofore ex-
plained) comprises carefully prepared memoirs on new and interesting
specimens and articles collected for the National Museum, and printed
as soon as material for a “signature” of 16 pages is madeup. This
series, like that of the “‘ Bulletins,” is primarily published and stere-
otyped under the authority and direction of the honorable Secretary of
the Interior. These articles or contributions comprise, first, papers pre-
pared by the scientific corps of the National Museum; secondly, papers
by other naturalists based on the Museum collections; and, lastly, of
memoranda and interesting information gathered from the correspond-
ence of the Smithsonian Institution.

Volume VI of the “ Proceedings of the United States National Mu-
seum” for 1883 (Smithsonian No. 548) was completed and published
during the past year. The volume contains papers by Tarleton H.
Bean, L. Belding, Katherine J. Bush, W. H. Dall, William J. Fisher,
James M. Flint, Charles H. Gilbert, Theodore Gill, G. Brown Goode,
G. H. Heap, William T. Hornaday, Frederick Humbert, J. G. Hunt,
David S. Jordan, Pierre Louis Jouy, George P. Merrill, E. W. Nelson,
A. P. Niblack, Charles C. Nutting, Richard Rathbun, Charles Rau, Rob-

C. Stearns, W. A. Stearns, Leonhard Stejneger, Joseph Swain, Freder-
ick W. True, S. T. Walker, Charles A. White, Merritt Willis, and H.
C. Yarrow. It forms an octavo volume of vit + 558 pages, illustrated

Smithsonian Annual Report—The Annual Report of the Regents of
the Institution to Congress for 1882, submitted January 19, 1883, was not
actually published and ready for distribution till the past year,1884. The
volume contains the Journal of Proceedings of the Board of Regents, the
reports of the Executive Committee of the Board, and of the Secretary
“REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3a

of the Institution, together with the “General Appendix,” which com-
prises the usual scientific record for the year, namely, an account of the
progress in Astronomy, by E.S. Holden; in Geology, by'T. Sterry Hunt ;
in Geography, by F. M. Green; in Meteorology, by Cleveland Abbe; in
Physics, by G. F. Barker; in Chemistry, by H. Carrington Bolton; in Min-
eralogy, by Edward 8. Dana; in Botany, by W. G. Farlow; in Zoology,
by Theodore Gill; and in Anthropology, by O.T. Mason; concluding with
a selection of miscellaneous papers on American aboriginal remains, ~
contributed by correspondents of the Institution. The Report forms an
octavo volume of xx + 855 pages, the archeological papers being illus-
trated by 46 wood-cuts and topographic sketches of mound localities.

The Annual Report for 1883, I regret to say, has not yet been pub-
lished.

The reports on the progress during the year of the various branches
of science have been continued, and meet with very hearty favor, espe-
cially on the part of teachers, who find in them material for presenta-
tion to their classes, not otherwise accessible at the time, excepting to
those who have command of a vast number of scientific journals.
Among these reports, and one of special interest, is that upon the prog-
ress of meteorology, prepared by Professor Abbe. To make this spec-
ially serviceable, a detailed index was necessary ; but it was not possi-
ble to have this completed before it became necessary to put the report
to press. ‘The index was, however, prepared, and has been appended
to the extra copies.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The operations of this important branch of the Institution have been
carried on with vigor during the past year. Great inconvenience was
experienced during the winter of 1883~84 owing to the limited quarters
available for exchange work during the reconstruction of the eastern
portion of the Smithsonian building. On the completion of the first
floor of this edifice five rooms were assigned to this department and
two in the basement; several new assistants were appointed, and I am
happy to state that ample facilities are now provided for the prompt
and efficient discharge of business. The work, however, is constantly
growing and demands unceasing attention.

Mr. George H. Boehmer, in charge of the international exchanges, has
seen in Europe for a large part of the year, engaged in taking the neces-
sary measures to improve and reorganize the relationships of the Smith-
sonian Institution to the European service of international exchanges.
A full account of his operations will be given in the next annual report.

Congressional Aid.—The appropriation by Congress for the exchange
system, under direction of the Institution, was increased for the year
188485 from $7,500 to $10,000. Without this aid it would be impossi-
ble for the Institution to continue its gratuitous service to the libraries

and societies in this country which have so long enjoyed the benefits
of the system.

Tiberality of Transportation Companies.— Thanks also to the liberality
of the principal steamship companies, the packages of the Institution
are still carried free of freight, a concession amounting to several thou-
sand dollars a year in value. Acknowledgments are due to the follow-
ing companies and firms for this voluntary service :

The Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the Baltimore and Ohio
Company have continued their concessions of reduced fares, and the
freight steamer lines between Washington and New York have also
made liberal concessions, which have been of very great value.

Acknowledgments are also due to the foreign ministers and consuls
of the various Governments for their assistance in taking charge of the
packages intended for the countries which they respectively represent
and transmitting them with care to their destination.

The following tables will give the statistics for 1584:

REPCRT OF THE SECRETARY 35
TRANSMISSIONS.

1. Foreign exchanges: 537 boxes, representing a bulk of 3,531 cubic feet, with a
weight of 131,350 pounds, being an increase of 118 boxes over the year 1883.

2. Domestic exchanges: 10,236 packages, of which 8,094 were addressed to institu-
tions, and 2,142 to individuals.

3. Government exchanges: 114 boxes, representing a bulk of 750 cubic feet, with a
weight of 27,885 pounds, against 76 boxes in 1853; or an increase of 38 boxes, as
compared with that year.

The increase over the year 1883 is most noticeable in the foreign and
Government exchanges, being 156 boxes, with a bulk of 993 cubic feet
and a weight of 36,970 pounds.

In the domestic exchanges there is an apparent decrease in the num-
ber of parcels, but this is owing to the fact that packages arriving by
mail for the Smithsofian library were formerly recorded by the ex-
change office, while during a great portion of the year 1884 this practice
had been discontinued.

Government Document Eachange.—The exchange of official publica-
tions of the United States Government for those of most other foreign
nations has been continued, as in previous years, under the auspices of
the Smithsonian Institution, in accordance with the law of Congress,
and a large number of valuable publications have been sent to agencies
designated by their respective countries.

During the year the Government of Great Britain has agreed to make
a complete exchange of all official documents, commencing with Janu-
ary 1, 1882, and preliminary arrangements have been made to the same
effect with the Government of Austria.

There are now thirty-eight foreign Governments regularly receiving
the publications of the United States.

For some time there has been considerable difficulty in establishing
the regular international exchange connection with the British Prov-
inces and the United States. A satisfactory arrangement, however,
has been made with the Geological Survey at Ottawa to receive and
distribute all parcels belonging to Canada proper, and by the kind aid
of Mr. Matthews, of St. John, N. B., Mr. Kane, of the custom-house at
St. John, has agreed to receive parcels for Nova Scotia, New Bruns-
wick, and Prince Edward Island, and to assess pro rata the freight
expenses upon the recipients. There only remains to make some satis-
factory arrangement with Newfoundland to complete the British pro-
vincial service, which it is thought can be accomplished before long.

Public Utility of the Smithsonian Exchanges.—The practical benefits of
the Smithsonian exchange system are extended to the remotest quar-
ters of the earth; and have been frequently acknowledged by eminent
scientific workers abroad. It has even been suggested that in the in-
terest of science, similar agencies in Great Britain and elsewhere, are
a great desideratum, notwithstanding the increasing activity among
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

European Governments in promoting international exchanges of official
publications. In a communication published in Nature, October 30,
1884 (vol. xxx, p. 634), Prof. V. Ball, of the chair of Geology and
Mineralogy in the University of Dublin, in warmly commending ‘ the
extraordinary liberality of the American Government” in its free dis-
tribution of the Geological Survey Reports, and other valuable works,
remarks as follows:

“ We owe much of this liberality, no doubt, to the forethought and
generosity of our own countryman, Smithson, the principal function of
the Institution founded by him, being to arrange for the exchange and
dispatch of books and specimens.*

‘There are perhaps few directions in which the cause of science would
be more directly benefited just now than by the establishment of an
institution in England which would undertake the management of the
exchanges of the scientific societies of the United Kingdom. I am
aware that there are paid agencies for the purpose, but what is wanted
is a free agency which would undertake the duty for the large societies
and relieve those that are struggling from charges which now press
heavily on their resources.

“The great desideratum, however, is a man like Smithson, who, pos-
sessing wealth, would be willing to give or bequeath it for the purpose
of founding such aninstitution. Here is an opportunity for any person
of capital—desirous of doing good and preserving his name to all pos-
terity by one and the same act.

“To return, however, to the main object of this letter, cannot anything
be done to increase the ‘ free list’ of Government publications? Surely
there must be stored away vast quantities of survey and other serial
publications, which if they were handed over to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, would, I feel certain, be gratefuNy accepted and judiciously dis-
tributed among the libraries of America.”

Difficulties of prompt Delivery.—It is perhaps proper to call attention
to the fact that the Institution does not undertake to act as an express
agency, guaranteeing to deliver packages in the most expeditious man-
ner and securing prompt returns. The number of correspondents is so
large, the places to be reached so numerous and some of them so diffi-
cult of access, that delays of weeks and even of months are frequently
necessary. The Institution desires to secure the speedy delivery of
everything intrusted to it, not only for the sake of the senders and the
credit of the exchange ageney, but because the constant accession of
packages is so great that it is not possible to allow them to accumulate.

It is very desirable that officers of societies or individuals who avail
themselves of the Smithsonian service should not inform the parties for
whom packages are intended in foreign countries that they have been
‘sent until the date of actual shipment is ascertained. This is a cause
of frequent complaint and misunderstanding, and might be entirely pre-
vented by due consideration of the case.

* This is really but one of the functions of the Institution, co-ordinated with that
of promoting original research,

RELATIONS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION TO OTHER BODIES.

I. To the Government—Congress.—Ever since the completion of the
new wings of the Capitol, the proper ventilation of the House of Rep-
resentatives has been a subject of anxiety to its members, and several
commissions of civilians have been appointed to consider the question.
Of these Professor Henry was chairman, and at the time of his death, in
1878, he had completed a renewed inquiry on the subject, and prepared
a report upon the same. In this office I succeeded Professor Henry,
and again, in February, 1884, was asked to form one of an advisory
committee (the other members consisting of Colonel Casey, of the
United States Engineers, Mr. Edward Clark, Architect of the Capitol,
and Dr. J. S. Billings, of the Army Medical Museum) to assist the
standing committee of the House of Representatives in its deliberations.
The question having arisen as to the purity of the air in different parts
of the hall and its approaches, a chemical analysis of the same was made
by Dr. J. H. Kidder, U. 8S. N., with the assistance of Mr. R. L. Packard
of the Bureau of Education, and some interesting and important state-
ments and generalizations were furnished. Their work was completed
on the 2d of April, and a report furnished in the same month and pub-
lished as a part of Report No. 1970, Forty-eighth Congress, first ses-
sion. The conclusions of the report are that—

1. The chemical examinations and tests indicate no impurity in the
air supplied to the House, nor unwholesome change during its passage
through the air-duct or the hall.

2. The air in the corridors and stairways is much less pure than that
ofine hall. *..*, *

5. The “relative humidity” as observed is about 20 per cent. below
the accepted standard, and probably falls much lower in cold weather,
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

6. The ventilation of the southeast gallery appears to be insuffi-
cient.

This examination, which included the estimation of 65 samples of air,
aud numerous hygrometric and anemometric observations, agrees sub-
stantially as to results with those undertaken by Professor Henry and
Dr. Charles M. Wetherill in 1865~66 (House Ex. Doc. No. 100, Thirty-
ninth Congress), and by Dr. Charles Smart, U.S. A., in 1880 (MS. re-
port to the Advisory Board).

Navy Department.—Reference has been made in previous reports to _
the arrangement by which, at the request of the Navy Department,
the institution received for three successive years six Ensigns, and
assigned them to duty in various sections of the National Museum
for the purpose of enabling them to become acquainted with certain
branches of science, such as chemistry, mineralogy, geology, ethnology,
general natural history, &c., in order that in their subsequent cruises
they might be more useful. Three details of the kind have been made,
none, however, in 1884, the Department having found it inexpedient to
continue the arrangement. Most of the gentlemen already detailed
have also been reclaimed and assigned to duty. Two of these Ensigns,
Messrs. Miner and Garrett, are now on the Fish Commission steamer
“Albatross.” Ensign Hayden was detached in October and ordered
to duty, first at the Cambridge Observatory and subsequently to the
United States Geological Survey. At present there are but two of
these gentlemen left, and they are daily expecting their orders.

The experiment in connection with these junior officers of the Navy
has been very satisfactory as far as it has gone, and there can be no
doubt that the increased range of information thus acquired by the
eighteen gentlemen so detailed will be utilized to a greater or less ex-
tent in the future.

As in previous years, the Navy Department has had charge of the
administration of the department of materia medica in the National
Museum, which renders unnecessary the establishment of a similar
bureau in the Navy Department itself. The first officer detailed by the
Medical Department for this purpose was Dr. J. M. Flint, under whose
efficient administration the collection was thoroughly organized and
placed in working order. On Dr. Flint’s transfer to the steamer ‘Alba-
tross,” in 1884, Dr. H. J. Beyer, of the Navy, was ordered to his place,
and gives general satisfaction.

Lieutenant Bowles, attached to the U. 8S. S. “Adams,” stationed at
Sitka for some time past, was enabled to make some interesting collec-
tions for the National Museum, and when this vessel was under orders
to return to San Francisco, Lieutenant Bowles made application for an
exchange of service with an officer of the ‘ Pinta,” so as to remain on
that vessel and continue his work. This request was granted by the
Navy Department with its usual courtesy.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Bo

Naval Observatory.—The Institution is indebted to the courtesy of the
Superintendent of the United States Naval Observatory for including
its building and that of the National Museum in the series.of public
establishments which receive telegraphic time at noon on each succes-
sive day, and a clock, fitted up under the direction of the Observatory,
with an arrangement by which the observatory itself corrects any aber
ration in time, has been supplied, and although the money expense has
been borne by the Institution, yet no charge has been made for the time
service. ,

War Department.—The Signal Service has continued during the year
that: co-operation which has heretofore been found very serviceable,
especially through its agencies in Labrador and Alaska. More par-
ticular reference will be made to this subject in the chapter on Explora-
tions, but it may be well here to particularize the work of Mr. Lucien
M. Turner at Fort Chimo, Ungava Bay, Northern Labrador ; of Messrs.
Murdoch and Smith, at Point Barrow; Dr. Stejneger, at the Commander
Islands, &c.

By the kindness of the Signal Office, Mr. John J. McLean, who has
rendered very much aid to the institution in its work while resident in
Alaska, was again ordered to that country by the chief signal officer.
The lamented death, by drowning, of Mr. C. L. McKay, in the vicinity
of Nushagak, Bristol Bay, was mentioned in the preceding report. The
vacaney thus effected was filled by the Signal Office by the appoint-
ment of Mr. J. W. Johnson, of East Rockport, Ohio. This gentleman
is a naturalist of considerable experience, and will continue Mr. McKay’s
work of securing such specimens of natural history as he can find time
to prepare in the intervals of his regular official work for the Signal
Service. ,

By the courtesy of Colonel Rockwell, Superintendent of Public Build-
ings and Grounds, the Institution was enabled to make connection wit].
the underground telephone laid by his authority throngh the public
grounds by the Waring Company. <A special advantage in this was
the opportunity of making a more satisfactory connection between the
National Museum building and the United States carp ponds, a service
that previously had been much interrupted. Connection was also made
through the same trench with the Fire-Alarm Telegraph Company, and
the necessary permission to open North B street was promptly grantec
by the District Commissioners.

Treasury Department.—The Director of the Mint, at the request of
the Institution, has furnished for display in the National Museum two
sets, in bronze, of all the medals struck at the United States mints.
These are of great historical value, and when properly installed will
doubtless be very attractive to the public.

LightHouse Board.—The usual courtesies of the Light-House Board
have been extended in the way of co-cperation in obtaining data by
which to determine the temperatures of the waters of the Atlantic
AO REPORT OF THE. SECRETARY.

Ocean, with a view of investigations into the causes of movements of
fish and other marine animals.

On the application of the Institution in behalf of the American Orni-
thologists’ Union the Board also promptly gave instructions to light-
house keepers to keep the record of migrations of birds as shown
principally by their being picked up after striking against the light-
houses on dark nights.

The instructions of the Life-Saving Service to its agents to co-operate
with the Institution in its investigations have also borne good fruit in
the way of collecting information of the occurrence of rare and inter-
esting forms of marine animals.

In order to increase in every possible way the material in the de-
partment of materia medica in the National Museum, above referred to,
under the Navy Department, application was made to the Treasury
Department for instructions to the collectors of customs in the sea-
board cities to transmit samples of drugs submitted by specialists for
investigation, so as to serve as illustrations of both the crude importa-
tions and the adulterations attempted from time to time by importers.
A favorable response was made, and quite a number of collections have
already been received.

The usual courtesies of the Revenue Marine to the work of the Smith-
sonian have been continued during the year, the chief of the bureau hav-
ing instructed its captains in Alaska to further Mr. Swan’s proposed
exploration for the Institution by receiving him and _ his collections on
board whenever such action will not interfere with the regular service
of the vessels. Captain Healy, of the ‘‘ Corwin,” has also, by the author-
ity of the bureau, continued to make important contributions of collec-
tions.

The chief of the Bureau of Revenue Marine also kindly instructed
the commander of the revenue steamer ‘‘ Key West” to assist Mr. Hemp-
hill in carrying on his explorations of the Florida keys in behalf of the
National Museum.

Interior Department.—It has always been the policy of the Smith-
sonian Institution to make amicable arrangements with the various
Departments of the Government by which to avoid duplication of effort
in material. This has been shown in many ways, as in the arrange-
ment with the Commissioner of Agriculture to transfer all specimens of
plants and insects to that establishment and all human crania to the
Army Medical Museum, receiving from them in return whatever might
belong to the department of general natural history and ethnology.

A second instance of this spirit was shown in the transfer to the
United States Signal Service of the results of the meteorological corre-
spondence and labors which had been so effective in the hands of the
Smithsonian Institution for nearly twenty-five years.

Major Powell, of the United States Geological Survey, has organized
a special department of maps and charts, with a view of utilizing the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 41

information they contain in his work, or of having standards of com-
parison for his own draughtsmen and engravers. The Smithsonian In-
stitution has been accumulating material of this kind for nearly forty
years, embracing many thousands of sheets, and the offer of this to
Major Powell was promptly accepted, with the assurance that it would
be properly classed and arranged, and be at all times at the command
of the Institution.

The co-operation of the Secretary of the Interior has been especially
manifested in connection with the publications of the National Museum,
and of the printing required for labels, blanks, &c. All the expendi-
tures of appropriations made by Congress for preservation of the col-
lections of the Government, the construction of cases and fixtures, the
payment of salaries of Museum employés, &e., are made through the
disbursing officer of the Interior Department, Mr. G. W. Evans, and the
annual estimates for the service of the Museum, for postage, printing,
and blanks, are made through its Secretary.

Railroad and Steamboat Lines and other Corporations.—As in previous
years, the various railroad lines of the country and the foreign steam-
ship companies have rendered aid either in the entire reduction of
charges or through a very large remission of charges. The number has
increased of steamship companies furnishing free freights to the parcels
of the Smithsonian Institution, especially those connected with the In-
ternational Exchanges; a list of these is subjoined. The services ren-
dered by these companies is of the utmost possible benefit, not only in
the very great reduction of transportation to the Institution, but also
in the greater care exercised in handling the packages. Among the
additional companies to which the Institution is under obligation may be
specially mentioned the Atlas Steamship Company, the vessels of which,
under the direction of Messrs. Pim, Forwood & Co., make connection
with nearly all ports of the West Indies and Central America.

The Institution is indebted to the Merchants and Miners’ Transporta-
tion Company for greatly reduced rates of freight between Washington
and Boston. This is a privilege of great importance, as sometimes there
is a large amount of freight to be carried by this route. °

Mr. C. G. Prindle, a well-known botanical collector, undertook an
exploration of the region adjacent to the boundary line between the
United States and Mexico west of El Paso, and at the request of the
Smithsonian Institution the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company
gave passes to himself and assistant, which greatly facilitated their
work. An exceptionally wet season brought about an unusual develop-
ment of vegetation, and many points of interest were visited by Mr.
Prindle in the course of his labors with rich results.

To General Manager Robinson, of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fé Railroad, the Institution is indebted for a free pass for the year 1885,
to be used by one of its employés in an exploration of the natural his-
tory along the line of that road.
42 _ REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The Alaska Commercial Company has continued its liberal and im-
portant aid to all the operations of the Institution on the Pacific coast.

The co-operation of the Hudson’s Bay Company in the work of the
Smithsonian Institution, which commenced as long ago as 1858, has
been continued throtigh successive years; the latest instance being the
courtesy by which Mr. Lucien M. Turner was enabled to spend two
years at Ungava Bay, in Northern Labrador, in the service of the United
States Signal Office and of the Smithsonian Institution. The company
has also granted the necessary authority, and has given instructions to
its agents in this country in connection with the proposed exploration
of the region about the mouth of the Mackenzie River.

Co-operation with the American Associakon.—At the meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, held at Montreal
in 1882, a committee was appointed, consisting of Professors H. Car-
rington Bolton, Ira Remsen, F. W. Clarke, Albert R. Leeds, and Alexis
A. Julien, ‘to devise and inaugurate a plan for the proper indexing of
the literature of the chemical elements.” To forward this useful en-
terprise the Smithsonian Institution undertook to distribute for the com-
mittee any circulars or other documents issued by its authority. At
the next meeting of the Association, held at Minneapolis in 1883, the
committee on indexing reported progress, and acknowledged the
friendly offices of the Institution as ‘an offer of great importance, and
for which this committee expresses sincere thanks.”

In further aid of a work so valuable to chemical research and to the
advancement of science this Institution has also announced its readiness
to undertake the publication of the various bibliographical indexes com-
piled under the auspices of the committee; not, however, in excess of
fifty pages per annum. At the meeting of the Association held at Phil-
edelphia last September /1884) the committee on indexing reported a
number of special indexes as completed, and stated:

‘““Two hundred and fifty copies of our report for 1883 have been sent
to chemists throughout the United States, the Smithsonian Institution
having kindly attended to the distribution by mail without expense to
the committee. This led to correspondence with several chemists, who
regarded the scheme of co-operative indexing favorably, and resulted
in several offers of assistance.

** We are pleased to announce that in consequence of our representa-
tions the Smithsonian Institution has consented to publish indexes to
chemical literature which shall be indorsed by this committee. The
Smithsonian Institution places a limit to the number of pages which
will be printed per annum, but the limit is a generous one. By thus
securing the assistance of the Smithsonian Institution chemists are
assured of a reliable and authoritative channel of publication, together
with a wide circulation, and the plan of co-operative indexing will un-
doubtedly receive a great stimulus.”

The committee’s report for 1884, extracted from the proceedings of the
American Association for the year, was published as a three-page cir-
cular in October, and the same has been distributed by this Institution
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 43
~ to chemists and others interested in the subject. A copy of this cireu-
lar is appended to this report.

Electrical Exhibition at Philadelphia —An “International Electrical
Exhibition,” under the direction of the Franklin Institute of the State
of Pennsylvania, was held at Philadelphia from September 2 to Octo-
ber 11, 1884. Although the activities of the Institution have not for
many years past been directed to the extension of our knowledge in
the field of electrical science, nor any recent memoirs on the subject
published under its auspices, yet, as expressive of the interest felt in
the proposed movement, an exhibit was prepared and forwarded to the
directors before the opening of the exhibition. This exhibit comprised
two quarto volumes of original memoirs relating to electricity and
magnetism, collected from the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowl-
edge (averaging about 500 pages each), with specially-prepared title-
pages, and neatly bound; and also three octavo volumes on the same
subject, collected from the miscellaneous papers published at various
times in the annual Reports of the Institution, in like manner supplied
with appropriate title-pages, and neatly bound in a uniform style.
These five volumes were presented to the Franklin Institute as a per-
manent contribution to its memorial electrical library. .a framed por
traitof Professor Henry, of life size, in crayon, by Mr. H. Ulke, was
also forwarded for exhibition, with a framed legend attached, briefly
stating the more important contributions of the late Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution to the scientific and practical applications of
electricity.

In addition to these, the original telegraphic instrument constructed
for Professor Morse by Mr. Alfred Vail, and operated by them in the
first experimental communication by electro-magnetism between Balti-
more and Washington (May 24, 1844)—on deposit in the National Mu-
seum—was loaned to the Exhibition, by permission of Mr. Stephen
Vail, the owner and depositor of the instrument, and placed in its hall
of historical relics and memorials.

For the purpose of having the interest of the Smithsonian Institution
represented, Mr. William B. Taylor was commissioned to attend the
Electrical Exhibition to see after the exhibits of the Institution, and to
make such general examination of the extent, character, and details of
display as might prove instructive or useful. Mr. Taylor remained at
Philadelphia on this service one week, the cost to the Institution being
only his traveling expenses.

State and International Exhibitions.—The time and attention of the
officers of the Smithsonian Institution have been occupied for a number
of years past in the preparation of displays for exhibitions, national and
State. Notably among them may be mentioned the International Ex-
hibition at Philadelphia in 1876, the Berlin Fisheries Exhibition in 1880,
the Louisvillle Exhibition in 1883, the London Fisheries Exhibition in

nati, and the International Cotton Exposition at New Orleans, opening
in December, 1884. ;

Many applications are made from time to time to the Institution for
material for display, but in every instance they have been declined, un-
less an act of Congress has been passed authorizing the same, and mak-
ing the necessary appropriation. It is considered that the Institution
has no right to allow any of its collections to leave the walls of the Mu-
seum without such authority, and as the appropriations are each made

for a specific purpose, all expenditures of the same are strictly applied | -

as designated.

Great confusion is generally caused in the regular work of the Na-
tional Museum, as the time of the curators and assistants is occupied in
spasmodic efforts, apart from the regular continuous work necessary to
properly install and label the permanent collections. This condition is
cheerfully met, however, as the appropriations are generally such as
permit, and, indeed, require, the acquisition of new material which may
not be attainable excepting by purchase or expenditure of some kind.
Thus, with the help of the appropriations for the Berlin and London
displays, the Museum has acquired what may safely be considered the
most complete exhibition of fishery apparatus, methods, and products
ever combined under one roof, and constituting an object of great at-
traction to visitors. The experience of the present year is also in the
same direction; all funds available being expended specially in procur-
ing material illustrative of archeology and ethnology, and in bringing
together very extensive representations of the general industries of
the United States connected with textile materials, metallurgy, &c. The
increase in the collections of the Museum by this means and others is
so rapid as to involve the necessity for the speedy erection of a new
building for their proper accommodation.

In accordance with an act of Congress making provision for the par-
ticipation by the United States in the International Cotton Exhibition
at New Orleans, Mr. G. Brown Goode was nominated as the representa-
tive of the Fish Commission on that occasion and was duly commissioned
to that effect in May last. In conjunction with the representatives from
other departments, Mr. Goode has been diligently occupied in his labors,
which were brought to a satisfactory conclusion by the transmission of
several car-loads of objects to New Orleans in December last.

Prior to the transmission of collections to New Orleans, extended
displays were made at the exhibitions in Cincinnati and Louisville, some
of which have been returned to the Institution and others forwarded

direct to New Orleans.
NECROLOGY.

Dr. ARNOLD HENRY GuyotT, one of the earliest contributors to the in-
terests and the publications of the Smithsonian Institution, is one whose
death early in the past year we have to lament. Born at Boudevilliers,
near Neuchatel, in Switzerland, September 28, 1807, he entered the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

second class of the college of Neuchatel in 1821, going thence to Carls-
ruhe (where, in 1825, he formed an intimacy and lasting friendship with
Agassiz), afterward to the classical gympasium of Stuttgardt, returning
to Neuchatel in 1827. In 1829 he entered the university at Berlin, from
which institution he received the degree of Doctor in Philosophy in 1835.
The next four years he spent in Paris, making sammer excursions of
physiographical observations through France, Belgium, Holland, and
Italy, and in 1838 studying glaciers in Switzerland, and investigating
the distribution of erratic bowlders. In 1839 he was made professor of
history and physical geography at Neuchatel, where his early friend
Agassiz had already for some half a dozen years been professor of
natural history. Dr. Guyot held this position for ten years, assisting
Agassiz in the “‘Systeme Glaciaire,” published in 1847.

In 1848, Dr. Guyot, at the urgent solicitation of his friend Agassiz,
came to this country—the latter having been here already about two
years. He was employed for six years by the Massachusetts board of
education as lecturer to the normal schools of the State on geography
and its methods of teaching. In 1849 a course of his lectures in French
on “ The Earth and Man” were published in an English translation by
Professor Felton.

In 1859 he was invited by the Smithsonian Institution to assist in
developing the system of meteorological observations for the North
American continent, then recently organized. In addition to valuable
suggestions in consultation with other eminent meteorologists, as a
needful reference work in the labor of the various reductions from ex-
tended observations, Dr. Guyot undertook the collection, computation,
and arrangement of a series of graduated tables of constants—physical
as well as meteorological—for the use of those engaged in such investi-
gations. This valuable work, comprising 212 printed pages, together
with * Directions for Meteorological Observations,” comprising 70 printed
pages, mainly by the same author, was published in 1852, as the first
volume of the ‘‘ Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,” and at once
became in great demand.

Dr. Guyot at this time made a careful study of the physical geography
of the eastern portion of our country from Maine to South Carolina.
In 1854 he was elected professor of geology and physical geography in
the College of New Jersey at Princeton, a chair which he held till the
time of his death, a period of thirty years. A second edition of his
standard work, the “ Tables,” amended and greatly enlarged, was pub-
lished by the Institution in 1857, and a third edition in 1859, which ex-
tended to 638 octavo pages.

He was one of the original members of the National Academy of
Sciences at its organization in 1863. In the preparation of Jobnson’s
‘New Universal Cyclopedia,” a very elaborate and valuable work in
four large and closely printed volumes, published in 1875~78, he was
Dr. Barnard’s assistant editor-in-chief. Indefatigable in his efforts to
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

render complete his favorite production, the “ Meteorological and = .
sical Tables,” he commenced the preparation of a new edition, with stin
further additions in 1879, and this fourth edition, embracing about 750
octavo pages, was published by the Institution in the past year. But
the distinguished author did not live to see the last pages of the work
through the press. He died at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, Feb-
ruary 8, 1834, in the 77th year of his age.

HENRY GASS, for many years an employé of the Institution, died at
his residence in this city on the 10th of April, 1884, of consumption, at
the age of 49 years. He was appointed as a general messenger in Feb-
ruary, 1855, and though occupying a comparatively humble position,
by his fidelity and attention to his duties he made himself very useful.
Of late years he had been intrusted with the mail transmission of
Smithsonian publications to individual correspondents and applicants.
His health, never very robust, had been declining for a year or two,
but he continued at his post till within a few months before his death.
Patient and accommodating, he was kindly regarded by all with whom
he was brought into intercourse.

CLARENCE BISHOP YOUNG, the accountant of the Institution, died
on the 17th of April, 1884. He was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on
the 3d of February, 1846, but came to the United States with his parents
in 1849. He was graduated from Columbian College, Washington City,
in 1864, and from Harvard College in 1868. He completed the scien-
tific course in the Lawrence Scientific School. Before entering Har-
vard he was for two years a clerk in the Fourth Auditor’s Office, Treas-
ury Department. After leaving college, and while perfecting himself
in mechanical engineering in the city of New York, he was one of the
editors of an industrial journal. At the request of Professor Henry he
accepted a place in the Smithsonian Institution in 1870.as clerk and
book-keeper, which he retained until his death. He always discharged
his duties with punctuality, judgment, and accuracy. During his ex-
tensive service in the Institution, his modest and courteous demeanor,
his readiness to assist others when applied to, and his careful attention
to all details submitted to him, won the respect and warm regard of
all his as.uciates. He was a fine linguist, and his general scientific
culture and critical acumen rendered his services especially valuable in
revising papers and printers’ proofs for the Smithsonian publications.
In 1873 he was commissioned by Professor Henry to attend the Vienna
Exposition and visit the various agencies in Europe of the Institution.
Ill health, attended with great nervous prostration, compelled him to
withdraw from all active occupation for a year before he finally passed

away.
MISCELLANEOUS.

Edinburgh Ter-centenary.—The Smithsonian Institution was invited
by the University of Edinburgh to send a delegate to be present at the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 47

celebration of its tercentenary, and Hon. J. Russell Lowell, American
minister to England, was requested by the Institution to act in that
capacity. He did so to its entire satisfaction and gratification, and oc-
cupied quite a prominent place on the occasion in question.

Sonorous Sand.—An interesting problem to physicists and geologists
has been a sand found in certain localities, which, when placed in motion
by sliding, sometimes produces a very sonorous or resonant sound quite
peculiar in character and quite difficult of explanation. The subject
has received considerable attention from specialists, and Prof. H. C.
Bolton, of Trinity College, Hartford, Conn., desirous of making re-
searches on the subject, and especially in studying the microscopical,
chemical, and physical peculiarities of the grains, requested the aid of
the Institution in obtaining materials for the purpose. Letters were
addressed to parties in the Sandwich Islands, the coast of Oregon, Ger-
many, and many other places, and a considerable variety of specimens
from various localities has been received in response. These are now
in Professor Bolton’s hands, who will prepare a report on the subject.

The Mercer Estate.—References have been made in previous reports
respecting the will of the Rev. Dr. Mercer, of Newport, in which the
Smithsonian Institution and Harvard and Yale Colleges are made trust-
ees to administer certain scholarships.

A question arose as to whether these designations meant the present
incumbents of the offices or those who might be in power ‘at the time
when the provisions of the will should take effect.

This question having been brought before the courts of Rhode Island,
‘t was decided that reference was made to the officers in the abstract,
and not to the individuals, so that whoever may be in charge of the es-
tablishments in question when the provisions of the will are carried
into effect will be competent to take action. The amount involved at
present is about $300,000, and is likely to be doubled before action is
required. This action is contingent upon the death of certain legatees,
which will not take place, according to the tables of mortality, for about
thirty-five years.

Walker Prize.—Dr. William J. Walker a number of years ago be-
queathed to the Boston Society of Natural History a prize fund, from
the income of which an annual award was to be made to the compet-
itor having written the best essay on specified topics. In addition to
these annual awards, an honorary prize of from five hundred or one
thousand dollars (at the discretion of the society) is founded, to be
awarded every five years, ‘for such investigation or discovery as may
seem to deserve it, provided such investigation or discovery shall have
been made known or published in the United States at least one year
previous to the time of award.” The prize is to be bestowed on recom-
mendation of a special commission appointed by the society tor the pur-
pose.
4§ REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In January of the past year, the Secretary of this Institution was des-
ignated as one of such committee (together with Dr. Asa Gray, one of
the Regents, and Prof. J. S. Newberry). The prize of $1,000 was
awarded on their recommendation to Prof. James Hall, of Albany, by
the society, May 7, 1884.

Telegraphic Astronomical Announcements.—In the last annual report
(1883) was recorded the final transfer to the Harvard College Observa-
tory of the system of telegraphic announcement of astronomical dis-
coveries inaugurated by this Institution in 1873. ‘The belief was ex-
pressed that astronomical interests would be benefitted by placing this
useful service in the charge of a working observatory. It is gratifying
to learn that the expectation has been justified by the result. In the
thirty-eighth Annual Report of the Director of the Astronomical Observ-
atory of Harvard College (Prof. Edward C. Pickering), laid before the
Board of Overseers, January 9, 1884, it is remarked :

‘‘The system of announcing astronomical discoveries employed here
for some years past has received an important extension during the
last year. An association of over fifty observatories has been formed,
with its headquarters at Kiel, for the purpose of expediting the an-
nouncement of astronomical discoveries. The Smithsonian Institution,
which had for many years rendered an important service to astronomy
by transmitting astronomical.telegrams between Europe and America,
courteously signified its readiness to transfer this function to the ob-
servatory of Harvard College, upon learning that this observatory was
prepared to undertake it. ‘The change was announced by a circular
issued by the Smithsonian Institution on January 10, 1583, and since
that time the observatory has distributed in this country the astro-
nomical intelligence received from the European association, and has
forwarded to Kiel the information of American discoveries.”

Special Donations to the Smithsonian Institution.—The relationship of
Professor Henry, the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to
the progress of scientific discovery, by which the Morse electric tele-
graph system was established, must always give an interest to anything
illustrating the early history of the invention. Knowing this fact, Mr.
Stephen Vail has deposited with the Institution one of the two original
Morse telegraphic instruments made for experimental service between
Washington and Baltimore, and this has been placed in the National
Museum, where it attracts much interest among inventors. By permis-
sion of Mr. Vail it was lent for a time to the Electric Exhibition in
Philadelphia, but has been duly returned and put in its proper place.
Application has been made for it by parties connected with the New
Orleans Exposition, and with the permission of the owner, the instru-
ment will be sent to that city.

A life-size statue of Prof. Benjamin Silliman, one of the pioneers of
physical science in America, and the founder of the American Journal of
Science, was recently modeled by Prof. John I. Weir, cast in bronze (8
feet in height), and placed permanently in Yale College, at New Haven.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

Through the kindness of Prof. Benjamin Silliman, son of the eminent
savant in question, the model of this statue, in plaster, was presented
to the Institution and deposited in the National Museum, where it is
proposed to bring together as complete a collection as possible of busts
or portraits of the men whose work has definite relationship to the ob-
jects of the Institution.
The Institution received, in February, a complete set of standard
weights and measures of the United States from Professor Hilgard, Su-
perintendent of the Coast Survey, and of the United States Department
of Weights and Measures. This set was placed in the Institution in ae-
cordance with the requirements of the act of Congress of March 3, 1881.
(Statutes, XXI, p. 521.)
The set (No. 40) consists of the following:
1. Measure of length: A yard scale divided to inches and tenths, with
a matrix for the comparison of end yards.
2. Weights: 25, 10, 5, 5, 2, 2, and 1 ee 8, 4, 2,1, 4, 4, and 4
ounces, and 500, 200, 200, 100, 50, 20, 20, 10, 5, 2, 2, an 1 grains.
5. Capacity measures, cane A Jaina a quart; a pint.
4, Capacity measures, dry: A half-bushel; a peck; a half-peck; a
quart.
Adjustments: The yard is a line measure and an end measure. The
jaws of the matrix forming the latter are given a slight slope.
The yard scale is standard at 569.8 Fahr.
The bottom of the matrix is standard at 669.4 Fahr.
The top of the matrix exceeds the bottom by about three hundredths
(0.03) inch.
The expansion of the brass scale may be assumed as 0.00036 inch for
OR.
The weights are so closely adjusted to the standards that any correc-
tions developed in the final comparisons are insensible.
The liquid measures are adjusted to the temperature of 60° F. At
' this temperature—
The gallon = a standard gallon —0.007 cubie inch.
The quart = a standard quart —90.003 cubic inch.
The pint = a standard pint —0.005 cubic inch.
The dry measures are adjusted to the temperature of the maximum
density of water. At this temperature—
The half-bushel = standard —0.009 cubie ineh.
The peck = standard +0.007 cubic inch.
The half-peck = standard +0.0003 cubic inch.
The quart = standard +0.002 eubie inch.

donors, is now in the Metallurgical Department, a conspicuous and
attractive portion of the Museum.

A very important service has been rendered to the Institution during
the year by Capt. Charles Bendire, of the First Cavalry. This officer
was detailed on an Army Board, and utilized the opportunity of his
abode in Washington for a number of months by completely reorganiz-
ing and rearranging the collection of eggs of birds contained in the -—
National Museum. In the course of this operation he presented and °
interpolated the whole of his own collection of eggs, which was the finest
extant, so far as western America is concerned, and well supplied with
the species of the Eastern States, as well as those of Europe. Dr. J. C.
Merrill, of the Army, was prevailed upon to present his very fine col-
lection, which filled some of the few gaps in Captain Bendire’s series.

The National Museum and Smithsonian Institution are not -only
greatly indebted to Captain Bendire for the donation of one of the.most
important contributions it has ever received but‘also for the scientific

service rendered and for the accurate identification, labelling, and ar-

rangement, in an extremely attractive and novel manner, of the entire
series. The collection is now considered to be in excellent order, and
occupies one of-the small rooms adjacent to the northeastern pavilion.

Among the desiderata of the National Museum, and one necessary to
complete its material for study and exhibition, is that ofa collection of
plants from the different regions of the globe, and for obtaining which
no opportunity has hitherto presented itself. A very satisfactory ar-
rangement was made with Prof. Asa Gray, of Cambridge, to secure
the duplicates of what is known as the Joad Herbarium. Mr. Joad was
a botanist and much interested in the subject, and, having the means at
his command, brought together, in the course of his long life, one of
the most extensive private collections of plants known to men of science.
This collection went at his death, by bequest, to the Royal-Gardens at
Kew, London, and as that establishment had the greater number of
the species represented on its shelves, it transferred the collection to
the Herbarium at Cambridge, Mass. This collection also was nearly
complete, and after selecting comparatively few desiderata, Professor
Gray, in charge, offered to the Smithsonian Institution the remainder
on condition of payment of freight from-London, agreeing, at the same
time, to attend without cost, to the poisoning of the specimens, their
arrangement and proper labelling in suitable}portfolios. All this was
accomplished at a cost of a little over $500, and a,collection of over
10,000 species is now in the Museum and at the seryice of students.

At the close, in 1884, of the foreign exhibition hefd in Boston, which
opened in 1883, a large number of exhibits were contributed to the In-
scitution by foreign governments and commercial exhibitors. These,
with other donations of greater or less interest, will be noted in the-re-
port of Mr. Goode, the assistant director. I may mention here, how-
ever, that. among the contributions of this character were the greater
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. at

part of the exhibits made by Guatemala, Salvador, Ceylon, the Sand-
wich Islands, &e.

Among other interesting contributions to the Institution has been
what purports to be the first flag made in America from American silk.
By a formal order of Congress this was transferred to the National
Museum, and occupies a satisfactory position therein.

While the Smithsonian Institution is frequently favored by visits of
men of science from other countries for the purpose of special inquiry
into its methods or as an incident to travel through the country, an
unusual throng of such callers was welcomed during the centennial
year of 1876, on accountof the number connected with the foreign com-
missions and European visitors generally. A meeting somewhat simi-
lar—that of the British Association in Montreal—furnished a great in-
crease over the average, although, while savants of all countries were
represented in 1876, the visitors of 1884 were principally Englishmen,
who had been in attendance during the meeting of the British Associa-
tion in Montreal. Several distinguished naturalists took the occasion
to s‘udy the collections of the National Museum as containing many
important types otherwise inaccessible to them.

The Acclimatization Society of Budapest, Austria-Hungary, having
made application to the Smithsonian Institution for aid in obtaining a
sufficient supply of American hickory nuts for experimental cultivation,
through Mr. John Xantus, for many years a highly valued correspond-
ent of the Institution, the matter was referred to Mr. Thomas Mee-
han, of Germantown, Pa., the well-known florist and pomologist, who
attended promptly and satisfactorily to the call.

Within the year a very active organization has been established un-
der the name of the American Ornithologists’ Union, having for its ob-
ject the determination of many points of interest in connection with
the migration and history of the birds of North America, which can
only be ascertained by a concurrent effort extended over a wide area.

One of the principal objects of this Association has been the pre-
paration of a reliable nomenclature of North American birds. A re-
vision of the previous list, now in progress, will probably be published
before long, and will doubtless receive the assent of all working orni-
thologists.

As it is desirable to ascertain the amount of destruction of birds by
striking against light-houses along the coast, with the corresponding
indications of dates and routes of migration of the different species,
the Union, through its Secretary, Dr. C. Hart Merriam, has issued cir-
culars to the light-houses of the United States and Canada, to be filled
up and returned.

An appeal made to the Institution for co-operation was promptly
met, the Institution undertaking the expense of printing the blanks
and circulars in question, as being strictly germane to its functions. A
sutliciently large edition was prepared and transmitted to the Secretary,
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and it is understood that important returns have already been received,
which, with others, will be duly digested and published.

In ine re-organization of the affairs of the National Museum, conse-
quent upon taking possession of the new building, an important place
was given fora complete collection of materia medica of the whole world,
civilized and barbarous, as also for a series of suitable artificial combi-
nations of the elements in nature. In connection with this the services
of Dr. J. M. Flint, surgeon, U. 8. N., were obtained from the Secretary
of the Navy, and the Institution owes everything to the doctor for
establishing this collection on a firm basis. Dr. Flint’s term having
expired, he was transferred to the U. S. Fish Commission steamer
“Albatross,” and Dr. H. G. Beyer assigned to duty in his place on June
4, 1884. Dr. Beyer has been since that time actively engaged in carry-
ing on the work begun by Dr. Flint, as also initiating some important
measures of his own.

When the Chemical Department of the Smithsonian Institution was
first organized, Dr. F. M. Endlich was placed in charge, and per-,
formed its duties with fidelity and efficiency. On his resignation to
take charge of some extensive mining operations in the Southwest,
Dr. F. W. Taylor, of Washington, was appointed in his place. The
climate of Washington proving too severe for Dr. Taylor’s health,
he received leave of absence for some months, for the purpose of visit-
ing New Mexico, and on his arrival there, finding that it was in every
way. to his advantage, he resigned his position in the Institution on
June 10, 1884, greatly to our regret. He was succeeded in charge of
the jaboratory of the Institution by Prof. F. W. Clarke, the chemist of
the United States Geological Survey.

UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

A little more than three years ago, in the fall of 1881, the occupancy
of the new Museum building was begun, by moving into it several
thousand packing boxes full of unassorted and uncatalogued material,
the accumulation of many previous years. Themembers of the Museum
staff have been struggling ever since with this fragment of chaos, and
it gives me great pleasure to state that at the present time they have
finally gained the mastery over it. The material is now under control,
and has all heen assorted and assigned to its proper departments. Ex-
cept in a few curatorships, which are not yet entirely organized, the
specimens have been catalogued, and are available for study. The prep-
aration of the exhibition series has not yet been completed, however,
owing to the necessary delays in the work of printing the labels and
making the exhibition cases. Two things have interfered materially
with the progress of the work: first, the tremendous influx of new ma-
terial, which has required immediate attention to insure its safety,
3,509 packages having been received during the year; and, second, the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

interruptions caused by the preparations for the exhibitions in London,
New Orleans, Louisville, and Cincinnati, which have really put back
the work of arranging the collections at least twelve months.

It must be remembered that the ‘* National Museum” is actually
an institution of very recent origin, although the idea of the National
Museum has been in process of development for very many years. As
recently as 1877 the appropriation made by Congress for its support

yas only $10,000. The “ National Museum” was not recognized by that
name in the Congressional appropriation bills until 1876, although the
term was used in the reports of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution as early as 1868,* and although the national collections were
transferred to the custody of the Institution in 1858, in accordance with
the act of incorporation passed in 1846, by which it is provided that,
‘Call objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects
of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens
belonging or hereafter to belong to the United States, which may be in
the city of Washington,” shall be delivered to the Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution, and, together with new specimens obtained
by exchange, donation, or otherwise, shall be so arranged and classified
as best to facilitate their examination and study.t

Nearly half a century has passed since the United States, by the pro-
visions of the will of James Smithson, first became proprietor of a sci-
entific collection, in the shape of the Smithson minerals and meteorites;
it is forty-three years since the National Institute was founded, with
great prestige and influence, for the avowed purpose of organizing a
National Museum of Natural History; thirty-eight since Congress threw
upon the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution the responsibility of
caring for the so-called “ National Cabinet of Curiosities;” twenty-seven
since this responsibility was finally accepted and these collections were
transferred to the Smithsonian building; thirty-five since the Institu-
tion began to make collections of its own; eight since Congress has
really recognized the ‘‘ National Museum” as its ward, and four since
the Museum has had a shelter of its own, and an appropriation in any
way adequate to the necessities of its administrative work. The year
1880, then, marks an epoch in the history of the Museum, since at this
time Congress saw fit to recognize the claims of the Museum by increas-
ing the appropriations for its preservation and installation from $34,500
to $135,000. :

Their responsibility in the matter they had, however, recognized in
1879, by appropriating $250,000 for the construction of a fire-proof
building. The claims of the Museum to increased support had been

before them for three or four years—ever since, indeed, by their own act,
in connection with the preparations for the participation of the Govern-
ment Departments in the International Exposition in Philadelphia, and
the valuable gifts of foreign Governments upon that occasion, the Smith-
sonian building had been filled to overflowing with unassorted material

of the highest value for educational and scientific uses. These facts
should be borne in mind in considering the present condition of the
Museun, which is really—thanks to a large and efficient staff of cura-
tors—in much better condition than a glance at the exhibition halls
would seem to indicate.

If Congress continues its present policy in making appropriations for
the coming fiscal year I shall be abie to report at your next meeting
that the exhibition series of specimens is in nearly as good condition
as the study series—which is not now the case, for it has been our policy
to work from the foundation upwards and to get the great mass of the
reserve collections into good condition, before attempting to prepare
the selected series of specimens for display in the open cases.

More than ten years ago*—as Assistant Secretary—I pointed out in
my report to the Secretary of the Institution that the annual growth of
the Museum was undoubtedly greater than that of any other in the
world; that is, so far as the accession of great masses of material was
concerned. The increase at present is much greater than formerly, but
the accessions are much more manageable, owing to the larger number
of assistants employed. For twenty years the Assistant Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, with theshelp of one or two laborers and such
students as happened to volunteer their aid, performed all the duties of,
curatorship of the national collections. It was not until 1874 that a
special staff of Museum assistants was recognized, with duties apart
from the executive work of the Institution, and not until 1875 that the
office of curator was established, that office being held by the Assist-
ant Secretary from 1875 to 1878. Up to 1880 there was still but one
curator, with a number of “assistants,” but during that year an execu-
tive officer, with the grade of assistant director, was appointed, and the
five principal assistants in the Museum were designated curators. The
present organization of the personnel, then, dates back only five years,
to the time when preparations were being made for taking possession of
the new building. :

The staff, as now organized, consists of two classes—the scientific
officers, or curators, and the administrative officers; the former report:
ing to the director of the Museum, the latter to the assistant director,
who also has general supervision of the administrative work of the
curators.

There are at present 19 curatorships, some of which are divided as
indicated below, so that the number of heads of departments or sub-

36, of whom 24 are in the pay of the Museum, and the others are hon-
orary, 5 being detailed for this duty by the director of the Geological
Survey, | by the director of the Bureau of Ethnology, others by the
Commission of Fisheries, and by the Secretary of the Navy, two being
volunteers. It may be stated here that these details are in every instance
made in the interests of co-operation by those bureaus of the Govern-
ment engaged in work closely connected with that of the Museum. The
paleontologists of the Geological Survey find it so much to-their advan-
tage to have access to the paleontological collections of the Museum,
and the use of the laboratories, storage cases, and general administra-
tive machinery of the Museum, that they are permitted by their chief
to assume the responsibilities of curatorships and perform a general
work of supervision. In the same way it is with the mineralogist and
the ethnologist detailed. In nearly every case, however, the Museum
supplies the honorary curators with assistants, who relieve them of much
of the routine work. The curatorships are now organized as follows:

I. Arts and Industries.—The Assistant Director acting as curator,
with sub-curatorships as follows: A. Howard Clark, assistant; two pre-
parators. ; :

a. Materia medica: Dr. H. G. Beyer, U.S. N., honorary curator, with
one clerk.

b. Textile industries: Romyn Hitchcock, acting curator.

e. Fisheries: R. Edward Earll, curator.

d. Animal products: R. Edward Earll, acting curator.

e. Naval architecture: Capt. J. W. Collins, United States Fish Com-
mission, honorary curator.

-f. Foods: W. O. Atwater, acting curator.

In this department, it may be stated, is administered very much of
the material usually arranged by museums in their ethnological series,
and the curator of ethnology is consequently acting as adjunct curator
in arts and industries.

Il. Ethnology.—Dr. Otis T. Mason, curator, with one preparator and
two clerks.

Ill. Antiquities —Dr. Charles Rau, curator; E: P. Upham, assistant.

IV. American Prehistoric Pottery—W. H. Holmes, Bureau of Etb-
nology, honorary curator; Dr. Edward Foreman, assistant; one prepar-
ator.

V. Mammals.—Frederick W. True, curator; one clerk; two prepar-
ators.

VI. Birds—Robert Ridgway, curator; Dr. Leonard Stejneger, assist-
ant; one clerk and one preparator.

VII. Birds’ Eggs.—Capt. Charles Bendire, U. S. A., honorary cura-
tor (volunteer), and one clerk.

VIIL. Reptiles and Batrachians.—Dr. H. C. Yarrow, honorary cura-
tor (volunteer).
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

IX. Fishes.—Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, curator; Peter Parker and B.A.
Bean, assistants, detailed from United States Fish Commission.

X. Comparative Anatomy.—Frederick W. True, curator; F. A. Lucas
assistant; one preparator.

XI. Mollusks.—W. H. Dall, United States Geological Survey, curator;
Dr. R. E. C. Stearns, adjunct curator; one clerk.

XII. Insects —Dr.C. V. Riley, honorary curator (volunteer).

XII. Marine Invertebrates —Richard Rathbun, curator; L. H. Bald-
win, assistant, and one clerk. detailed by the United States Fish Com-
mission.

XIV. Invertebrate Fossils, Paleozic.—C. D. Walcott, United States
Geological Survey, honorary curator.

XV. Invertebrate Fossils, Mesozoic and Cenozoic.—Dr. C. A. White,
United States Geological Survey, honorary curator; J. B. Marcou,
United States Geological Survey, honorary assistant.

XVI. Plants, Fossil and Recent.—Lester F. Ward, United States Geo-
logical Survey, honorary curator; one clerk; one preparator.

XVII. Mineralogy.—Dr. F. W. Clarke, United States Geological Sur-
vey, honorary curator; W.S. Yeates, assistant.

XVIII. Lithology and Physical Geology—George P. Merrill, acting
curator; one preparator.

XIX. Metallurgy and Economic Geology. —Fred. P. Dewey, curator; J.
A. Allen, assistant.

Division of Administration.

The Division of Administration consists of fifteen departments, the
organization of which has been described at length in previous reports.
A number of additional preparators have been employed for special
work upon the collections for the New Orleans Exposition, and an un-
usual quantity of objects for the exhibition series has been completed
during the year in the workshops, as is shown in the review of the op-
erations of the scientific departments. Specially noteworthy among
these is a number of gigantic photographic enlargements representing
thirteen of the Government buildings in Washington. These are the
largest prints ever made, and have been found particularly effective at
New Orleans and Cincinnati, it being thought that in an exhibition of
the work of the Government Departments, such as has been attempted
this year by the United States Executive Board, it was particularly ap-
propriate that the public buildings of Mshieton should be shown in
an impressive manner.

In addition to the regular administrative staff of the Museum, an ad-
ministrative staff for exhibition work has been maintained since July,
1882, under the general charge of the Assistant Director. Mr. R. Ed-
ward Earll is the executive officer, and Mr. W. V. Cox financial clerk of
this staff, which is increased from time to time as occasion requires by
the employmentof extra clerks and preparators, and to which also, when
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 57

necessary, are detailed various officers of the Museum scientific staff.
In addition to the-exhibition work of the year elsewhere referred to, this
staff is still engaged in the preparation of a report upon the Interna-
tional Fisheries Exhibition at London.

Depariment of Ethnology.—Prof. Otis T. Mason, having been appointed
curator, took charge of this department on the lst of July and spent
the remainder of-the year chiefty in getting control of his material. All.
of the ethnological specimens of the Museum are now under complete
management, a part of them being on exhibition, the remainder classi-
fied and stored in drawers for ready reference. During the year, 3,658
specimens belonging to primitive races have been received. In addi-
tion to these, this department has been intrusted with many objects
registered in other catalogues and deposited here for the sake of com-
pleting evolutionary series of implements, processes, and art products.
The most noteworthy accessions in 1884 were as follows: [Illustrations
of Eskimo and Indian life from Ungava Bay and vicinity, by Lucien
M. Turner, who will prepare a monograph upon the specimens; illas-
trations of Eskimo life at Point Barrow, collected by Lieutenant Ray,
U.S.A. Mr. Murdoch will describe these: rich collections from the
Eskimo of Western and Southern Alaska, by E. W. Nelson, W.J. Fisher,
Charles L. McKay, Baron Nordenskiold ; specimens of the arts of the
tribes of Northwest America, collected by J. G. Swan and Lieut. T. Dix
Bolles; many objects illustrative of the modern Indians of Yucatan, by
Louis H. Ayme; a very large and instructive collection of objects from
the Peruvian huacas, by George W. Keifer and Dr. William H. Jones,
U.S. N.; acollection of weapons, &c.,from New Guinea, purchased from
A. P. Goodwin; an exchange series of weapons from Polynesia, con-
tributed by Charles Heape. During the year illustrative series of eth-
nological objects have been exhibited at Cincinnati, Louisville, and New
Orleans, care being taken in each case to impress some ethnological
truth, such as distribution of types, the effect of environment, the treat-
ment of the same art by different tribes, or the progress of an art from
its infancy to its highest manifestation.

Department of Antiquities—Dr. Rau reports 3,956 specimens added
to the exhibition and study series and 1,185 to the duplicates. They
are in numerous accession lots, of which 18 were sufficiently important
to merit especial notice. An extensive educational series, illustrating
American-archeology, was prepared for the New Orleans Exposition.
Lhe collection now comprises 45,252 specimens, of which 8,522 are in the
duplicate bins.

Department of Mammals.—N otwithstanding the absence of the curator,
Mr. True, in Europe during the first quarter of the year, and other diver-
sions of his attention and time to routine work not connected with his
regular duties, the progress of this department has been exceedingly sat-
jsfactory. The work upon the exhibition series has been hampered by
the fact that money was not avaiable for the construction of the desired
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

cases in the mammal hall. The collection is now, for the first time in
many years, thoroughly classified and under control, and the total
number of skins and alcoholic specimens is reported to be 5,694, and of
skulls and skeletons 4,214, making a total of 9,908. The accessions of
the year have, in number, variety, and importance, been fully equal to
those of earlier periods. No less than 58 specimens, including such rare
and peculiar forms as the eland, harnessed-antelope, cheetah, two spe-
cies of lemur, wart-hog, and baboons, have been received from the pro-
prietors of zoological garaens and menageries, for which due acknowl-
edgments are made in the Museum report. An unusual number of
cetaceans and seals, many of great novelty and interest, have come in
from various sources. The amount of taxidermic work accomplished
has been unusually great, owing to a special allotment for the employ-
ment of extra help, made from the appropriation for the New Orleans
Exhibition—149 specimens in all having been added to the mounted
series, including several large forms, such as the buffalo, puma, jaguar,
and beaver.

Department of Birds —Mr. Ridgway reports that the year has been
unprecedented in the extent of the accessions and the amount of worle
accomplished. The number of birds added during the year is 8,142,
2,658 having been distributed. The collections have been entirely re-
arranged and the exhibition series is receiving a complete overhauling.
Over 1,200 skins have been mounted, and copy for 1,000 species labels
have been sent to the printer. The total number of specimens in the
reserve series is now 50,350, 6,800 of which are in the exhibition series.
Very much of the inereased activity of the year was due to the stimulus
of preparation for the New Orleans Exhibition and the aid received from
this appropriation. About 500 birds were sent to New Orleans, consti-
tuting a complete representation of American game birds.

Department of Birds’ Eggs.—During the year the collections have been
overhauled and thoroughly rearranged by Capt. Charles Bendire, U.S.
A., who has incorporated with it his own collection, including nearly
8,000 specimens, the finest in the United States, which he has presented
to the Museum. This collection now represents pretty nearly all that
is known of American odlogy, and contains 40,072 specimens, of which
4,272 are toreign.

Department of Reptiles and Batrachians.—Comparatively little has been
lone in this department, owing to the absence of Dr. Yarrow on a col-
lecting expedition in Utah during the summer months, which he has in
former years devoted to volunteer work upon the collections.

Department of Fishes —The work upon this great collection has made
fine progress during the year. The curator, Dr. Bean, has nearly com-
pleted his card catalogue of the reserve series, and during the summer
Prof. D. S. Jordan was employed, in the interest of the New Orleans
Exhibition, in selecting a special exhibition series to include all the
fresh-water fishes of the United States, and to make a special collect:
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

ing trip through the Mississippi Valley, with the view to supply such
species as were lacking in the collection. This trip has been of great
importance to the science of ichthyology, bringing to light very many
important facts concerning the fishes of aregion not previously explored
ichthyologieally, and throwing much light upon the whole subject of
distribution. Out of the 560 fresh-water species known to inhabit North
America, the Museum now has all but 49, 30 having been added by this
trip, and some 25 new species having been brought to light. The ac-
cessions to this department have been very important, especially those
from the Fish Commission; at least twenty new fishes from the deep-
sea fauna having been brought in as a result of the work of the Alba-
tross.

Department of Comparative Anatomy.—A department of comparative
anatomy is being organized, and the east-south rauge has been filled up
with a very beautiful set of cases, especially constructed for the recep-
tion of the preparations. Mr. Lucas, with his two assistants, has been
engaged, during the latter part of the year, in mounting skeletons, and
fully 150 fine preparations have been put on exhibition. The report of
Mr. True upon the plan of organization will not be presented until next
year, since much preparatory work remains to be done. A case illus-
trating the work in this department was sent to the New Orleans Expo-
sition.

Department of Mollusks.—Mr. W. H. Dall, who has for many years
had charge of the collection of mollusks, having been appointed one of
the paleontologists of the Geological Survey, and assigned to the de-
partment of Quaternary mollusks, has, by the request of the Director of
the Survey, been assigned working rooms in the Smithsonian building,
and will continue to care for the department as heretofore, access to the
collections of recent shells being necessary for comparison with the
shells of the Quaternary beds, which are, for the most part, specifically
identical. Prof. R. E. C. Stearns, late of the University of California,
has been assigned to this department as adjunct curator, and since the
first of July there has been great activity in rearranging the collections.
It was decided to make an extensive display of the mollusks of the
United States at the New Orleans Exposition, and the well-known
Stearns collection of mollusks, for which negotiations had been in prog-
ress for some years, was purchased from the exhibition appropriation.
Dr. Stearns had in charge the preparation of the series for New Orleans,
which occupied his time from July until the end of the year. This oc-
cupied twenty large cases, and exhibits the economic mollusks of both
coasts and the adjacent seas, and the fresh-water mussels, which form
so remarkable a part of the fauna of the great Mississippi basin. Mr.
R. Ellsworth Call has been employed for six months in connection with
the New Orleans work, and by the efforts of these three conchologists,
with the help of two clerks, much progress has been made toward getting
under final control the immense mass of material in this department.
60 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Department of Insects.—Prof. C. V. Riley has, as in previous years,
voluntarily assumed the care of the entomological material which has
come in, and his own valuable and constantly increasing collection re-
mains a deposit in the Museum. A collection of insects injurious to
forest trees, mounted in Museum eases, in the style which it is pro-
posed by Professor Riley to adopt in the arrangement of cur exhibition
series when the opportunity comes, was sent to the International For-
estry Exhibition in Edinburgh and received a gold medal. Fifty-five
accession lots were received during the year, the most valuable being
the collection made by L. M. Turner at Ungava Bay, H. B.T. It is
hoped that the financial condition of the Museum will soon warrant the
placing of this very important and long-neglected department upon a
footing of equality with the others.

Department of Marine Invertebrates.—In the Department of Marine
Invertebrates, exclusive of the Mollusca, under the charge of Mr. Rath-
bun, 240 cases of specimens, enumerated in 72 accessions, have been
added during the year. Of these, the most important have been re-
ceived from the United States Fish Commission, from Dr. Edward Pal-
mer, a collector employed in the interest of the New Orleans Exhibition,
and from various naval sources. The Fish Commission collections are
mainly illustrative of the recent deep-sea explorations of the steamer
“Albatross” off the eastern coast of the United States and in the Gulf of
Mexico and Caribbean Sea, and contain many new additions to science,
which have been worked up only in part. They fill several thousand
jars and vials. The collection of Dr. Palmer was made for the purpose
of representing at the World’s Fair, in New Orleans, the varied animal
resources of the coral reef and sponge regions of Southern and West-
ern Florida. It consisted for the most part of finely prepared specimens
of commercial and other sponges, ornamental corals, and the larger spe-
cies of Crustaceans and Mollusks used as food, and required 65 large
shipping cases to transport it to Washington. Supplemental to this is
an extensive collection made by Mr. Henry Hemphill on the western
coast of Florida.

Among the more interesting of the naval contributions are several
collections of Crustaceans and Echinoderms, obtained by Dr. W. H.
Jones, U.S. N., in different parts of the Pacific Ocean. A number of
valuable collections, carefully identified, have also been received from
competent European authorities, and will be of great service in the
elaboration of new materials contained in the Museum.

The increase of accessions to this department has been so great dur-
ing the year, especially by reason of the material furnished by the
Fish Commission, that, even with the aid of three or four assistants,
little more could be done than to take care of the new material.

Department of Invertebrate Fossils (Paleozoic).—The collections of this
department are arranged in 15 unit table cases and in office trays equiv-
alent in capacity to as many more. Mr. Walcott estimates the total num-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

ber of specimens at 25,000, including the old Smithsonian collections and
the accessions from the recent Government surveys and other sources
‘up to the present time. The most important accession of the year is
that of Devonian and Carboniferous fossils from the United States
Geological Survey, many of them types of new species, and forming the
basis of Mr. Walcott’s recent “‘ Paleontology of the Eureka District,
Nevada.”

Department of Invertebrate Fossils (Mesozoie and Cenozoic).—The ac-
cessions of the year consist of 85 boxes from the Geological Survey,
embracing collections made in California, Oregon, New Jersey, Florida,
Alabama, and Mississippi, and 15 miscellaneous lots sent from private
sources to the Museum. The catalogye entries number 1,158. From
this department, as from many others, there comes a request for more
room. These requests we are striving to grant as rapidly as the ap-
propriation for the construction of cases will allow, but it is doubtful if
the necessities of the case can be fully met until a new building can be
put up.

Department of Plants, Fossil and Recent.—The collection of fossil plants
pow contains 923 distinct species identified and installed. The report
of Professor Ward contains elaborate statistics of the collection, from
which it appears that 7,291 specimens have already been catalogued.
The accessions of the year have been of but slight importance. The
Joad collection of receut plants has not yet been unpacked, owing to
lack of room, but will soon be arranged and in proper condition for
study. During the year Mr. William R. Smith, superintendent of the
Government Botanic Garden, has placed in the rotunda of the new
building a number of very beautiful palms, which add very much to the
attractiveness of the apartment, and which, being selected with refer-
ence to their economic importance to man, wili, when labeled, furnish
instruction as well as pleasure to the visitors.

Department of Lithology and Physical Geology.—Mr. Merrill reports a
total number of entries amounting to 2,541, including not less than 3,000
specimens administered upon during the year. Prominent among the
accessions is a series of rocks and tufas from Utah, Nevada, and Cali-
fornia, collected by Mr. I. C. Russell and transferred by the Geological
Survey, and a large collection of building stones from John 8. F. Batchen.
Mr. Merrill prepared a large and important series of specimens for the
New Orleans Exhibition, and in this work had the efficient assistance of
Mr. L. H. Merrill, and the services of a number of stone-cutters for some
months.

Some remarkably beautiful colored photographic enlargements on
' glass, illustrating the structure of twelve selected types of rocks, were
among the most striking products of the year’s work in Mr. Merrill’s
laboratory; also a series of colored sketches showing the appearance of
various kinds of building stones used in architectural work. The col-
lections sent to New Orleans included a type collection of the building
62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and ornamental stones of the United States, comprising 358 specimens,
an educational series of rocks, containing 500 specimens, a very interest-
ing structural series of rocks, and a collection of rock-forming minerals.
In addition to all this work, 1,557 descriptive labels were printed and
200 thin sections of rock prepared. The collection as it now stands is
described by Mr. Merrill as follows:

The total number of specimens in the reserve series is not less than
15,000, of which some 3,000 are now on exhibition. Of these, 4,246 are
building or ornamental stones, 1,658 of which are on exhibition. The
number of specimens in the duplicate series will probably increase the
total to 18,000.

Department of Minerals.—Prof. ¥. W. Clarke, chief chemist of the Gev-
logical Survey, continues to act as curator, Mr. W.S. Yeates having the
‘collections in immediate charge. During the year, the growth of the col-
lections has been steady and encouraging, the work of installing the col-
lections has been definitely begun, and a system of exchanges has been .
fairly inaugurated. Mr. Joseph Willcox has deposited his private col-
lection, consisting of some 1,400 specimens, which is, in some respects,
one of the finest in America. Mr. J. T. Abert has given the valuable col-
lection of his father, Col. J. J. Abert, containing 1,245 specimens. An
allotment of $2,500 from the New Orleans appropriation was devoted
to building up the collection of gems and ornamental stones. The
schedule adopted included all the gems proper, rock crystal, agates aid
jaspers, malachite, lapis lazuli, &c., and every important gem or orna-
mental species was secured both in the rough and cut conditions.
About 1,000 specimens are on exhibition at New Orleans, of which
nearly one-third are cut and polished stones. <A part of this collection
was exhibited at Cincinnati, where it was awarded a silver medal. In
connection with the New Orleans work, two important collecting trips
were made by Mr. Yeates, to Northern New York and the Hot Springs
of Arkansas. The total number of specimens in the collection is esti-
mated at 15,288.

Department of Metallurgy.—Owing to the absence of Mr. Dewey in

_ New Orleans, no report upon his work can be given. It may be stated,
however, that a large force has been at work during the entire year,
with very satisfactory results in the way of reducing to order the great
mass of material, the accumulation of many years. Since July, Mr.
Dewey and his staff have been preparing the New Orleans collection,
having an allotment of $5,000 wherewith to illustrate the metallic re-
sources of the country, and, by the aid of a number of volunteer assist-
aunts in the field, the collection has received accessions of very great
value, which make it one of the most important metallurgical collections
in the world.

Increase of the Museum.—The accessions are described in detail in the
reports of the Assistant Director and Curators of the Museum, and are
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

also referred to in the discussion of the explorations carried on during
the year by the’ Smithsonian and affiliated organizations.

Exposition Work.—The participation of the Smithsonian Institution,
as directed by Congress in three exhibitions, has, although in many
respects detrimental to the growth of the Museum, contributed largely to
the prosperity of several of its departments. In the first place, in order
that material might properly be selected for exhibition, it was found nec-
essary in many departments of the Museum to employ additional assist-
ants in making a thorough overhauling of the material and getting it
_ systematically arranged. In the second place, it was found necessary
to purchase a considerable amount of material to fill vacancies in the
various series. of specimens which were shown at the exhibitions. It
has been our-policy to expend the appropriation for the New Orleans
Exposition in such a manner that there also might result a perma-
nent benefit to the Museum. This we have found to be entirely con-
sistent with the interests of the exhibitions, since the material which
is useful for these temporary displays is even more useful for the per-
manent exhibition series of the Museum. At the same time, in many
of the departments, an effort has been made in selecting specimens for
the expositions, to make use of duplicate material from the Museum, in
order that, should we be called upon in future to participate in other
exhibitions, the preparation of a collection can be effected with less ex-
pense of time and money than has been heretofore practicable.

I can, at present, only present a brief preliminary report upon what
has been done in connection with the exhibitions at Cincinnati, Louis-
ville, and New Orleans.

By direction of Congress the Smithsonian Institution, in connection
with the Executive Departments of the Government and the Depart-
mentof Agriculture, has taken part during the year in three industrial
exhibitions—the “ Cincinnati Industrial Exposition,” at Cincinnati, open
from September 3 to October 4; the ‘‘Southern Exposition,” at Louis-
ville, open from August 16 to October 25, and the *“* World’s Industrial
and Cotton Centennial Exposition,” at New Orleans, which opened on
December 16, and will not close until June 30 of the present year. Out
of $300,000 appropriated to the Government executive board for the
New Orleans Exhibition, the Smithsonian received $75,000, and of the
_ $10,000 for the boards participating at Louisville, and a like sum for
Cincinnati, the allotment to the Smithsonian was $5,000—$2,500 for
Louisville and $2,300 for Cincinnati. The conduct of the displays on the
part of the Government was intrusted to an executive board appointed
by the President of the United States, of which Col. 8S. C. Lyford, U.S.
A., was designated president. Mr. G. Brown Goode was nominated
by me and appointed by the President member of this board on behalf
ofthe Smithsonian Institution, National Museum, and Fish Commission.

The passing of the appropriation bill was so loug delayed that when
the money finally became available, only two weeks’ time remained be-
64 REPORT OF TUE SECRETARY.

fore it was necessary to have the collections for Louisville packed and
on the way. We were, ther elon, unable to make a very extensive ex-
hibit at that place.

The special features of the exhibit were a large collection showing
the uses of animals, a collection of textile fibers and fabrics, a series of
the game and water birds of North America, a small collection of boat
models, including the whale-boat and the Chinese junk, a collection of
casts of reptiles, and a large number of photographs illustrative of the
methods employed in the fisheries.

The exhibit was packed in ninety-six boxes of various sizes.

The Cincinnati Exposition opened two weeks later, and it was there-
fore possible to make a more creditable display. A special building
was erected for the Government exhibit, one end of which was assigned
to the Smithsonian Institution. In addition to a collection similar to
that sent to Louisville there was prepared for the Cincinnati Exposition
a fine collection of gems, and also an exhibit representative of the eth-
nology of the North American Indians and Eskimos. Several large
casts of cetaceans were also displayed.

It was found necessary to have most of the Louisville and Cincinnati
collections returned to Washington to be prepared and rearranged be-
fore sending them to New Orleans.

By virtue of an Executive order of May 13, 1884, a board, consisting
of a representative of each Government Department and of the Smith-
sonian Institution, was appointed and charged with making arrange-
ments for a display of collections illustrating the resources of the
United States at the World’s Industrial and Cotton Centennial Expo-
sition to be held at New Orleans. The appropriations for this purpose
were not made until July 7, leaving only four clear months for the
preparation and shipment of collections. . Several of the curators were
at once sent into the field with the authority to add to the collections
under their charge. By December 1, the collections were ready for
transmission, but the opening had been deferred from December 1 to
December 16. On this date the Exposition was formally opened.

The preparations for this Exposition were very much more elaborate
than had been possible in the case of the Louisville and Cincinnati Ex-
positions. The main feature of the display made by the Institution at
New Orleans was, of course, understood to be in illustration of the
animal and mineral resources and the ethnology of the United States,
similar to that made by the Institution in 1876 at Philadelphia. In
addition to this a collection illustrating the textile industries of the
world was prepared, in view of the fact that the main interest of the
New Orleans Exposition centered in one of the textile materials, and
also a Selection of objects from the Department of Naval Architecture.
The curators of eleven departments were requested to take part in the
preparation of the New Orleans exhibit, and most of them were tempo-

rarily placed upon the exhibition staff. The character of the work
undertaken by them may be briefly sketched as follows:

The participation of the Zoological and Geological Departments has
been referred to in the review of the work of the several departments,
and will not be repeated here.

Department of Arts and Industries.—Mr. Romyn Hitchcock undertook
the preparation of a collection of textile fibers and fabrics. Portions
of this collection were exhibited both at Louisville and Cincinnati.
Capt. J. W. Collins prepared a series of working models illustrating the
development of the ship-building industry in the United States, and
especially the evolution of the American schooner, the American pilot-
boat, and the American cotton-ship. A number of full-rigged models
were also sent in this connection, being exhibited on the way at Louis-
ville and Cincinnati. The model of a whale-boat, fully equipped with
all appliances for the capture of whales, was also sent. This model at-
tracted much attention at the London and Berlin Iisheries Exhibitions.

The animal products collection, which was so prominent a feature in
our exhibition at Philadelphia, was reorganized and greatly extended,
so that it now represents very thoroughly the applications of animals
to the uses of mankind in all parts of the world. This collection alone,
if arranged in table-cases, would occupy a floor space equivalent to that
in one of the large halls of the new Museum building. The Museum
has received many important gifts for this collection on condition that
they be exhibited in New Orleans before being finally placed in the
Museum.

The Section of Fisheries was represented by about sixty of the large
pictures prepared for the London Exhibition, and by about two hun-
dred casts of American food fishes, which also had direct relation to
the animal products collection just referred to. It was not deemed
expedient to dismantle the general fishery collections so recently in-
stalled, for such a temporary interest as that of these exhibitions. The
United States Fish Commission made preparations for a considerable
display of fish-culture, and a representative collection of fish-cultural
apparatus was sent from the Museum.

A selection of about two hundred and fifty of the celebrated autotypes
published by Adolph Braun & Co., of Dornach, was acquired for dis-
play. This collection illustrates the history of painting from the time
of Cimabue and Giotto, including from one to six copies of the best rep-
resentative works of each celebrated master, so far as it was practicable
to obtain them. This collection can be packed in a very small space,
and is particularly well suited for sending away to exhibitions. It may
in the future be somewhat extended to very good advantage.

Department of Ethnology.—There were sent to New Orleans about two
hundred and fifty unit boxes, containing a representative collection of
American ethnological objects. These were very largely selected from
the duplicates in the Museum and are available for future exhibition,

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

The prosecution of ethnologic researches among the North American
Indians, under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution and in compliance with act of Congress, was continued during
the year 1884, under the charge of Maj. J. W. Powell, who has furnished
the following account of operations.

They may be conveniently reported upon under the two general heads
of Field Work and Office Work, the latter to a large extent being the
supplement to and discussion of the former, and executed by the same
officers, who had previously obtained materials and information in the
field.

1. Field Work.

This heading may be divided into, Ist, Mound Explorations; 2d,
Collections from Ancient and Modern Stone Villages; and, 3d, General
Field Studies, embracing those in Institutions, Linguistics, and other
divisions of Anthropology.

Mound Explorations.—The work of exploring the mounds and other
ancient monuments of our country, begun in 1882, was carried on dur-
ing the year 1884, under the charge of Prof. Cyrus Thomas.

The same persons, viz, Mr. P. W. Norris, Mr. James D. Middleton,
and Dr. Edward Palmer, who had been engaged during the previous
year, were retained as the regular field assistants, but Dr. Palmer ceased
to be connected with the work after the 30th of June, being then suc-
ceeded by Mr. John P. Rogan.
68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Mr. Norris was engaged duting the latter part of the winter and most
of the spring in Arkansas, then returned to Kanawha Valley, West
Virginia, where he was occupied in exploring the extensive group of
works in the vicinity of Charleston until December, when he was com-
pelled by the cold weather and sickness to desist. To the great regret
of all his associates in the work, his sickness terminated in death a few
days after the close of the year. By his death the division has lost a
faithful and enthusiastic worker.

His explorations in Kanawha Valley brought to light the fact that
here is one of the most extensive and interesting groups of works in
the United States. Although the exploration of this group is not yet
complete, it is sufficient to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that
the people who constructed the works of this locality built the Grave
Creek mound, or were intimately related to the authors of that noted
tumulus. There are also found some strong indications that they were
related to the authors of the ancient works of the Scioto Valley.

Mr. Middleton continued operations in Arkansas until the approach
of summer, assisted for some of the time by Mr. L. H. Thing. During
the remainder of the summer, the fall months, and until the approach
of extreme cold weather, he was engaged in exploring the works of
Knox County, Ohio. Since that time his field of operations has been
Arkansas.

Dr. Palmer was engaged, during the six months of the year he
remained with the division, chiefly in Alabama, and in Early County,
Georgia.

Previous to his appointment as permanent assistant Mr. Rogan was
employed in Northern Georgia, principally in exploring the celebrated
Etowah group in Bartow County. This examination brought to light
some of the most remarkable mound relics so far discovered in the
United States. These consist of very thin, evenly wrought sheets of
copper, on which are impressed, as regularly as though done with me-
tallic dies or by means of machinery, figures bearing strong resem-
blance to the Mexican and Central American designs. The conditiens
under which these were found leave no doubt that they were placed in
the mounds when they were built, and not subsequently. Here also
was found part of a stone bust of nearly life size, and the broken arm of
another stone image, also but little less than life size.

During the latter part of the summer and until the beginning of win-
ter, Mr. Rogan was engaged, in connection with the Rev. J. P. Mac-
Lean, in examining and exploring the ancient monuments of Butler
County and adjacent regions of Southern Ohio.

Mr. Charles Smith was employed during the month of November in
examining the ancient quarries of “ Flint Ridge,” Ohio, and making col-
lections to illustrate the various stages in the aboriginal manufacture
of flint implements, The collection made is, perhaps, the most com-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

plete in this particular line of any single one so far made in this coun-
try.

During the year nearly five thousand specimens were collected. The
data obtained bearing on the questions relating to the origin and uses
of the ancient monuments of North America, and the habits, customs,
and culture-status of the people who constructed them, are very impor-
tant, and will throw much additional light on these interesting prob-
lems. The number of whole and uninjured vessels of clay collected
by Messrs. Middleton, Thing, and Norris is much larger than that of
the preceding year, and is very valuable on account of the new and un-
usual types obtained. The collection of copper implements and orna-
ments is also large and valuable.

Although the pottery obtained by Dr. Palmer in Early County,
Georgia, is in fragments, it is of special value, as it serves, when com-
pared with that of the region of Flint River and other sections, to show
that this southern region was occupied by a people varying, in some
respects at least, from those of the other portions of the South.

Collections from Stone Villages.—Ethnologie and archeologic re-
searches among the Pueblo Indians, and ancient ruins in the south-
western Territories, were extensively prosecuted during the year. Mr.
James Stevenson, in charge of a party, proceeded to Arizona and New
Mexico to examine special localities and make collections of objects
illustrating the arts and industries of the Indian tribes of that region.
The labors of this party resulted in a collection of about eight thousand
five hundred specimens of pottery, stone, and other domestic implements,
both ancient and modern, representing nearly all phases of life, art, and
industry among those tribes. A portion of Mr. Stevenson’s party, in
charge of Mr. I’. D. Beckford, made explorations among the ruins of
Chaco Cafion in Northwestern New Mexico, Canon de Chelly and some
of its branches, the cliff dwellings in Walnut Caiion in Arizona, and a
group of cave dwellings near Flagstaff in the same Territory, the re-
sults of which are full notes, sketches, and photographie illustrations
of the ruins examined. The remainder of this party was divided ; one
party was stationed at the pueblo of Acoma, in charge of Mr. Garlick,
and the other at Zuni in New Mexico. The party at Acoma made a
collection of about three thousand five hundred specimens, consisting
of pottery and domestic utensils of other material, such as stone, hoca,
bone, wood, and woven fabrics. The collection from the pueblo of
Acoma, though not embracing so great a variety of objects, will, how-
ever, illustrate nearly all the phases of the arts and industrial pursuits
of those Indians.

The collection made at Zui, under Mr. Stevenson’s personal super-
vision, is much larger than any heretofore obtained from that section
of the Southwest, and includes many interesting objects, illustrative
of their out-door ceremonies, such as sacred spring, eave and shrine
worship, also a large number of water-color sketches illustrating many
70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of their sacred dances. About three hundred fetiches were also ob
tained, representing nearly every animal and object held in high esteem
by the Zuiis, e. g., hunting charms, war and prey gods. A series of pho-
tographic views was also made of thesacred springs, wells, monuments,
picture-writings, and shrines of the Zunis, scattered over an area of
about 75 miles in all directions from Zui, and a collection of repre-
sentative specimens of their gods, idols, plume-sticks, and other relig-
ious objects was secured. These collections have already been received
at the National Museum, where they will be arranged, classified, and
described. Full notes, detailing the observations made in the field, as
well as a descriptive catalogue of the collections made, will appear in
a forthcoming report of: the Bureau of Ethnology.

Mr. Victor Mindeleff was, at the beginning of the year, in charge of
a party collecting pottery at Acoma, N. Mex. He secured and shipped
about 1,000 specimens before returning to Washington, in the month
of February. He also made a close architectural survey of the village,
securing such plans and data as were necessary for the preparation of
a detailed model. In August he returned to New Mexico, visiting the
Chaco group of ruined pueblos in order to secure detailed plans, pho-
tographs, and other materials for the preparation of models, spending
about two months in that work. In October he made a survey and
measurements of the large Etowah mound near Cartersville, Ga., pre-
liminary to constructing a model to be added to the mound series of the
Bureau. :

General Field Studies.—In the beginning of 1884 Mr. Frank H. Cushing
undertook systematic explorations of the sacrificial grottoes and votive
shrines of the Zunis in the main and tributary valleys of their pueblos.
In and upon the mesa of Taai ycel lon ne or Thunder Mountain alone,
he found eight of these depositories, three of which proved to be entirely
prehistoric, the others partially so. On the head-lands, both north and
south of Zuni, he traced eleven additional shrines, and near both Pes-
cado and Nutria found others, all rich in ancient remains. More im-
portant than any of these, however, were three caverns, or rock-shelters,
situated in two canons, one some 9 miles east of Zui, the other south-
east and nearer the pueblo by 3 miles. 'Two of these caves were of a
remote date as receptacles, one containing a burial cairn, the other an
extensive accumulation of well-preserved idols of war and rain-gods,
symbolic altar-tablets, sacred cigarettes, long and short prayer-wands,
and numerous samples of textile, cordage, and piume work. The lat-
ter deposit was the more important in that, beside being still used and
held sacred by the Zunis—hence clearly referable to their ancestry—its
contents evidently connected it with the crater and cave-shrines discov-
ered by Mr. Cushing on the Upper Colorado Chiquito in 1881, and de-
scribed in the report of his explorations for that year. As, however, he
was forced to visit these places either in company with Indian compan-
ions or by stealth, he had to leave his rich finds undisturbed.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 1

Pursuing his explorations southward, he discovered, between 20 and
30 miles from the central Zuni valley, not only two caves, containing
sacrificial remains, but also a number of cemeteries of undoubted an-
cient Pueblo Indian origin. These burial places yielded perfect crania
and well-preserved vessels of earthenware, and in all respects save in
extent were identical with those of Arizona examined and reported on
by him during the spring of 1883.

He explains the non-discovery heretofore of Pueblo burial places by
the fact that the primitive house-building Indians, although they at
first practiced burial by interment, must have carried the remains of
their dead (judging by the cemeteries under discussion) to great distances
from their permanent homes; that afterward, when the present methods
of terraced communal architecture (induced by defensive confederations
and productive of conditions and populations rendering such burials
impracticable) began to prevail, ‘‘ water sepulture ” came into vogue.
This was, according to Zuni tradition, performed by cremating the
bodies, then carrying the remains to sacred springs or lagunes into
which they were cast. Mr. Cushing returned to Washington in the
month of May.

Mr. H. W. Henshaw visited California for the purpose of pursuing
_ linguistic studies in the Santa Barbara family of languages. The ra-
pidity with which the tribes of the Southern Californian coast died away
when brought under the sway of the Spanish missions is well known,
and he found only about fifty survivors of the once populous tribes of
this family. Several dialects have become extinct. He visited Monte-
rey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties, and ob-
tained vocabularies of eight distinct dialects of this family, all that now
survive. Los Angeles and San Diego Counties were visited with the
view to determine the limits of the Shoshonian and Yuman families, and
several vocabularies of each family were collected.

Mr. Albert S. Gatschet traveled early in August to Fort Sill, Ind.
T., to study the languages of the Comanche, Apache, and Kaiowa Indians
residing there. He then proceeded to Fort Worth, Tex., where he ob-
tained a large vocabulary, with texts and sentences, of the Lipan lan-
guage, and later to Fort Griffin to obtain similar information from the
Tonkaway Indians. While at the latter place, he obtained from old
YVonkaway Indians a vocabulary of the Karankawa Indians, a tribe said
to have lived over fifty years ago in the vicinity of Matamoros. This
appears to be new to linguistic science. A short list of words was also
obtained of the Handme language, which also appears to belong to an
extinct tribe.

Returning to Fort Sill, Mr. Gatschet obtained further linguistic in-
formation on the Kaiowa language ; and after going to Anadarko, Ind,
T., extensive vocabularies were gained from Kaiowa, Caddo, Yatassi,
and Anadarko Indians, the last two being dialects of the Caddo lan-
guage. At Austin, Tex., historic and linguistic information relating to
‘la . REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Indians of Texas and California was found in the State library. Atthe
close of the year he was still at Saint Charles, La., studying and collect-
ing linguistic material of the language of the Atakapa Indians.

Rey. J. Owen Dorsey visited the Siletz Agency, Oregon, in August,
1884, to gain linguistic and other information respecting the tribes in
that region. When he returned in November, 1884, he brought back
the following vocabularies: Athabascan family: Applegate Creek, Galice
Creek, Chasta Costa, Mikono tunne, Tutu tunne (and Joshua), Yuk-
witce, Sixes, Naltunne tunne, Chetcoe, Smith River, Cal., and Upper
Coquille. Yakonan family: Siuslaw, Umpqua, Alsea, and Yaquina.
Unclassified vocabularies: Takelma or Upper Rogue River, Molluk or
Lower Coquille, Klikitat, Sasti. Total, nineteen vocabularies, ranging
from fifty to three thousand entries, exclusive of phrase and grammatical
notes. He also obtained materials for an account of the social organi-
zation of some of these Indians in villages, which appear to have been
clans, illustrated by rough maps, showing the localities of such villages.
Mr. Dorsey also gained the corresponding Indian names from several
tribes of about sixty vegetal products, specimens of which were brought
to Washington for identification.

Dr. W. J. Hoffman proceeded early in August to Victoria, B. C.,
where a large collection of sketches of Haida totem-posts and carvings
were obtained, in connection with the myths which they illustrated.
At this locality attention was paid to the burial places and osteologic
remains of the nearly extinct Songhish Indians. Meeting with a large
party of Haida Indians at Port Townsend, Wash., he examined a large
number of individuals of both sexes to study and sketch the tattooed
designs with which they were profusely decorated. Definitions and
explanations of these designs were obtained, together with the details
of the process employed in tattooing by the Haidas, as wellas the other
tribes living on Puget Sound, Cape Flattery, ete. <A collection of Es-
kimoan pictographs and ivory carvings were also copied at the museum
ot the Alaska Commercial Company, San Francisco, Cal.

At Santa Barbara, Cal., Dr. Hoffman discovered several interesting
painted records, and examined a number which have not yet been re-
corded. These records are usually found in mountainous country, and
near passes. Similar records were also visited 30 miles northeast of
Los Angeles, Cal., and at Tule Indian Agency, in the deep valleys on
the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, near Porterville. By far the
greatest amount of pictographic material was collected in Owen's Val.
ley, Cal., where a number of series of petroglyphs are scattered over an
arid, sandy desert, the extremes being about 20 miles apart. Although
many of the characters appear to resemble some of the figures drawn
by the Moki of Arizona, the greater number have not as yet been noted
from any other portions of the United States.

During the months of May and June Mr. W. H. Holmes visited
Mexico, and secured much valuable information upon the relative ages
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 73

of the ceramic products of that country. His collection, consisting of
several hundred pieces of ancient ware, has been presented to the Na-
tional Museum.

Dr. H. C. Yarrow spent the months of August and September, 1884,
in the Territory of Utah to prosecute ethnologie inquiries. Several
mounds were carefully examined at Provo, 50 miles south of Salt Lake
City. These did not afford any specimens, but showed the manner in
which the former Indian inhabitants of the Great Salt Lake Valley con-
structed their adobe dwellings. From Provo he proceeded west to a
place known as the “Old Government Ranch,” where an Indian burial
cave was discovered, which for some years had been used by the Gos-
hute Indians, from which the Indian remains were removed. From
here he crossed the southern limb of the American desert and reached
the settlement of Willow Spring, at which point a number of burial
places were discovered, giving results of interest. Thence he went to
Deep Creek, the present home of the band of Goshute Indians, number-
ing about 150 souls; learned from them the meaning of many of their
ceremonies and burial rites, and obtained a collection of articles of na-
tive manufacture. A similar collection with information thereupon was
obtained from the band of Pahvants at Fillmore, Utah.

Mr. Jeremiah Curtin prosecuted studies in Indian philosophy and
folk lore among the Senecas in Missouri, during the month of Febru-
ary, and later from the Shawnee and other Algonkian tribes in Mis-
souri and Indian Territory. In June he visited the Seminole Indians in
that Territory with the same object in view, and in October proceeded
to Redding, Cal., where he continued the collection of myths among
the Nozi Indians.

2. Office Work.

The Director, Maj. J. W. Powell, has continued the work, first, of
classifying on a linguistic basis all the tribes, remaining and extinct, of
North America; second, of establishing their synonomy or the refer-
ence of their many and confusing titles as given in literature and com-
mon usage to a correct and systematic standard of nomenclature; and
third, of the ascertainment and display on a series of charts of the hab-
itat of all tribes when first met by Europeans or subsequent periods
Much progress has been made in this undertaking, recognized as essen-
tial to the proper study of Indian anthropology.

Col. Garrick Mallery was engaged during the year in the continued
study of sig language. A number of important collections of gesture
signs were procured from parts of the United States not before thor-
oughly explored in this respect. Collections of great value were also
obtained from Japan, Asiatic Turkey, and from several of the Polyne-
sian groups. The increased collection of material, with its collation,
indicates that while one system of gesture-speech has long existed
among the North American Indians, it is not to be regarded as one
74 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ormal or absolute language; several groups with their centers of origin
being indicated. Five of these groups appear, from present informa-
tion, to be well defined as follows: First, the Arikara, Dakota, Mandan,
Gros Ventre or Hidatsa, Blackfeet, Crows, and other tribes in Montana
and Idaho. Second, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Pani, Kaiowa, Caddo, Wichita,
Apache of Indian Territory, and other tribes in the Southwest as far as
New Mexico, and possibly portions of Arizona. Third, Pima, Yuma,
Papago, Maricopa, Hualpai (Yuman), and the tribes of Southern Cali-
fornia. Fourth, Shoshoni, Banak, Pai-Uta of Pyramid Lake, and the
tribes of Northern Idaho and Lower British Columbia, Eastern Wash-
ington, and Oregon. Fifth, Alaska, embracing the Southern Innuit,
Kenai (Athabaskan), and the Jakutat and Tshilkaat tribes of the
Thlinkit or Koloshan stock. The gestures of Alaskan tribes present
marked difference to any of the southern tribes.

The gestures still used by the Indians of British Columbia and the
northern part of Vancouver's Island, also by the Iroquois of Canada,
are not at present classed in any group.

In the comparison made between the gesture signs of the several
bodies of speaking men and between those groups and the signs of deaf-
mutes, it appears that variation in form is frequent, while identity of
system is preserved. Not only do many of the particular signs of deaf-
mutes in America differ from those with the same signification in some
countries of Europe, but a similar disagreement is observed among the
several institutions for deaf-mute instruction in the United States.
When the diverse signs are purely ideographic, they are, however, in-
telligible to all persons familiar with the principles of sign expression ;
but when, as frequently occurs, they are conventional, they cannot be
understood without the aid of the context, or without knowledge of the
special convention. The similar instances of diversity among the In-
dian signs are so numerous that a vocabulary confined to the presenta-
tion of a single sign for each of the several objects or ideas to be ex-
pressed would be insufficient and misleading. Variants must be sup-
plied with designation of the several groups using them. There being
no single absolute language, each of the prevalent forms of expression
has an equal right to consideration, without which a vocabulary must
either be limited to a single so-called dialect, or become the glossary of a
jargon. Tor this reason the collation of the gesture-signs of the North
American Indians for scientific examination requires minute care, and
when they are critically compared with the signs of other speaking
men, ancient and modern, and with those of deaf-mutes, the work is
much protracted.

Colonel Mallery has also continued the study of pictographs, and
has prepared for the press a preliminary paper on that subject intended
to guide research and procure collaboration. The collection of picto-
graphs has been largely enriched during the year, especially by the
discovery of six forms of Dakota Winter Counts, which have been col-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

lated with the one form published in the year 1877 by Colonel Mallery,
under the title of “Calendar of the Dakota Nation.” The wide cireu-
lation of his paper on this subject was the means of obtaining the ad-
ditional copies, valuable as a verification and for correction, and also
extending over a longer number of years than the one first published.
The collected Winter Counts now furnish a large amount of ethnologic
information wholly apart from the interest attached to them as calen-
dars. In the whole of these studies Colonel Mallery has been assisted
by Dr. W. J. Hoffman.

Mr. Frank H. Cushing, on his return to Washington in the spring of
1884, renewed his work of the classification of his material obtained in
the field and its preparation for publication. He completed an essay
on the culture-growth of the Zuiis, as illustrated by studies of the
Pueblo pottery, and has prepared a paper on the ancient province of
Cibola, and the Seven Cities, with explanation of the architectural
types in the Southwest, and the social institutions connected with the
several periods of that architecture. He has also arranged his copious
notes on the myths and folk-lore of the Zunis.

The preparation of the Bibliography of North American Linguistics
by Mr. James C. Pilling was continued during the year. There were
received from the printer during the year proof-sheets of pages 839-
1135, and these were distributed to various gentlemen throughout this
country and others for examination and criticism. Among them were
Sefior Joaquin Garcia Icazbalceta, of the city of Mexico; Mr. Wilber-
force Eames, of New York City, and Drs. J. G. Shea, of Elizabeth, N.
J., D. G. Brinton, of Media, Pa., and J. Hammond Trumbull, of Hart-
ford, Conn., from all of whom valuable information was obtained.
During the latter part of October and the early part of November
Mr. Pilling made a brief trip to New England, visiting several libraries
in Boston and Providence for the purpose of clearing up a number of
doubtful bibliographic points.

Mr. H. W. Henshaw was engaged during the earlier part of the year
in assisting the Director in the work of the classification of the lan-
guages of the North American Indians. The large number of vocab-
ularies of Indian languages which have been collected from time to
time, and the recent increased activity in the direction of linguistic
studies, imperatively require that a classification shall be made upon
a more comprehensive and satisfactory basis than has hitherto been
done. The confusion of nomenclature observable in previous classifi-
cations, and the perplexities to the linguistie student resulting there-
from, are universally recognized. Since Gallatin’s classification of 1836
the grouping of linguistic families has undergone great changes at
the hands of successive authors in accordance with conflicting views
held by them, and the families have been named and renamed with
little or no reference to the names previously given. It is believed
that in linguistic as in zoologic classification priority of name is the
76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

only safe rule to follow, and careful examination of all the literature
pertaining to Indian linguistic classification with a view to a deter-
mination of the name first employed for a family, together with care-
fully-compared tables of synonymy, was therefore indispensable. In
the work indicated, Mr. Henshaw prepared a system of tables on the
principle explained, and in connection with them a brief account of the
literature bearing on the subject.

Prof. O. T. Mason finished compiling the census of Indian education
from the time of the foundation of the Government, and collected ad-
ditional material for a grammar and dictionary of the Chahta language.

Mr. W. H. Holmes has been engaged during the year in carrying for-
ward his studies of American ceramics, and has made much progress
in the classification and arrangement of the collection of pottery in the
National Museum. He has also prepared a paper upon the fine collec-
tion of mound pottery in the museum of the Academy of Sciences at
Davenport, Iowa, which will appear in the Fourth Annual Report of
the Bureau. For the same volume, he has completed a paper upon the
origin and development of form and ornament in the ceramie art, with
copious illustrations. Mr. Holmes remains in-charge of the department
of illustrations in the Bureau of Ethnology, as well as in the Geologi-
cal Survey, and has made good progress in elevating the standard of
work. He has also had charge of the preparation of the exhibits of the
Bureau of Ethnology and of the Geologic Survey for the exposition at
New Orleans.

Mr. C. C. Royce continued his examinations into the primal title of
the different Indian tribes to lands within the limits of the United
States, and the methods employed by the United States authorities in
securing from such tribes a relinquishment of their title to such lands.
Special attention was given to compiling the data in connection with
the extinguishment of the Indian title to lands within the present limits
of Oregon, Washington Territory, California, Arizona, New Mexico,
Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Dakota, Texas, Minnesota,
Kansas, and Nebraska. The investigations before commenced in other
States have also been completed, and it is expected that the entire work
will be ready for publication within the year 1885.

Rev. J. Owen Dorsey, when not in the field, made many entries for
an Osage-English dictionary, and for a Kansas-Engiish dictionary, pre-
pared Osage and Kansas native texts with free and interlinear transla-
tions, and entries for the Egiha-English dictionary. He also prepared
articles on Kansas War Customs, and Migrations of certain Siouan
tribes, each one illustrated by charts. A manuscript Musquito diction-
ary was examined and criticised. After December 1, 1884, he collated
the following vocabularies gained in Oregon, viz: Takelma, Sasti, Ap-
plegate Creek, Chasta Costa, Galice Creek, Mulluk, Siuslaw, Umpqua,
Vaquina, Klikitat, and Smith River, California. Healso prepared a list
of the villages obtained from the tribes at the Siletz Agency, Oregon.

Mr. Albert S. Gatschet, before proceeding to the field, as above men-
tioned, was occupied in reading proof of his Klamath dictionary ; the
second or English-Klamath part, and in correcting and largely rewriting
the manuscript of his Klamath grammar from the copious notes made
during the printing of the text and the dictionary.

Mrs. Erminnie A. Smith continued her special study on the different
Iroquoian dialects. The Mohawk words previously translated from
the dictionary of Marcoux were all recopied and their literal meaning
given, as were also over 6,000 words in the Tuscarora dialect. She
also prepared several studies upon pronouns and other parts of speech,
for use in the introduction to her Iroquoian dictionary, which is in course
of preparation.

Dr. H. C. Yarrow, acting assistant surgeon, U.S. A., during the part
of the year in which he was not, as elsewhere reported, engaged in field
work, continued his investigations into the mortuary customs of the
North American Indians; maintaining the large correspondence relat-
ing thereto, and arranging, with a view to publication, the large amount
of material collected by him subsequent to his preliminary paper on the
above-mentioned subject.

Mr. Victor Mindeleff was occupied, when notin the field, in the prep-
aration of a map of Cafion de Chelley and its branches, from the data
obtained in the field during the last season, for the purpose of showing
the relation of the large number of cliff ruins (the plans of which had
been obtained) to the topography of the cations. He also continued the
work of modeling the Moki villages, which had been interrupted by his
field trip, in a series of models illustrating ancient pueblos and cliff
ruins, prepared by him for the New Orleans Exposition.

UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.

Although separate in organization and management, the Smithsonian
Institution and the Geological Survey have enjoyed at all times such
close personal and official relations that it has been customary to in-
clude a summary of the yearly operations of the Survey in the annual
report of the Institution. In pursuance of this custom such a summary,
furnished by Maj. J. W. Powell, the Director of the Survey, is appended
hereto.

The increased appropriation for the Geological Survey for the fiscal
year 1883~84 made improved organization and greater expansion possi-
ble. To the former nothing contributed more than the obtaining of
suitable office accommodations—a want long felt, and finally rendered
imperative by the enlargement of the Survey. Formerly the Director’s
office and executive force were in one place, the quarters of the geolo-
gists and geographers in another, while many divisions that should
have been in Washington under the immediate supervision of the Di-
rector were scattered in remote cities, This unsatisfactory condition
78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of affairs was ended by securing a lease of the Hooe iron building, a
large fire-proof structure on F street, to which the Survey force, with
the exception of the chemists and paleontologists, was removed in Octo-
ber. As this building did not offer laboratory facilities, the chemists
were permitted, through the kindness of the Director of the National
Museum, to occupy the northeast pavilion left vacant by the removal
of the Director’s office, while the paleontologists retained their old rooms
in the Museum, it being impracticable to separate them from their col-
lections, to which constant reference must be made, and which by law
are installed in the Museum. As these gentlemen also serve in the
capacity of honorary curators in the Museum, this arrangement seems
especially appropriate.

Before taking up the specific items of survey work, it is most gratify-
ing to refer to the friendly relation subsisting between the various State
surveys and the Geological Survey, and especially to the active co-oper-
ation of many of the former with the latter in its efforts to include the
whole country in its geologic investigations.

The detailed statements which follow under the heads of Geography,
Geology, Paleontology, Chemistry, Statistics, Publications, and Collec-
tions, indicate satisfactory progress made during the year.

For purposes of general reference it was found desirable to retain the
Divisions of the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Mississippi,
South Mississippi, Rocky Mountains, and Pacific. The Division of the
Great Basin was abandoned, it being necessary to withdraw Mr. G. K.
Gilbert theretrom and place him in charge of the Division of the South
Atlantic. For convenience of topographic reference these large areas
are again subdivided into districts such as ‘‘ New England,” ‘‘Appala-

chian,” &c.
GEOGRAPHY.

In the geographic work of the Survey it is constantly borne m mind
that it is only possible to carry out the intent and purpose of the law
requiring the construction of a geologic map of the United States, by
first preparing an accurate topographic map which can be placed in the
hands of the field geologists. In pursuance of this policy, as soon as
the material of the previous season had been reduced to permanent
form, active preparations were made for field work with an increased
and more effective force. As soon after July 1, as practicable, 27 topo-
graphic parties were organized and took the field under the guidance of
their respective chiefs.

Division of the North Atlantic

New England District.—Encouraged by the topographic work begun
in Massachusetts during the previous season, the legislature of that
comwonwealth appropriated the sum of $40,000 for the further prosecu-
tion of the work in connection with the Geological Survey. In view of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 79

this fact the number of field parties was increased to four. This neces-
sitated greater supervision, and in order that the inauguration of the
survey upon this more comprehensive plan might be made under the
most auspicious conditions, its general management was undertaken by
the Chief Geographer of the Survey, Mr. Henry Gannett. The season’s
work included the counties of Hampshire, Bristol, Norfolk, and Ply-
mouth, and embraces an area of 658 square miles.

New Jersey District.—Under arrangements very similar to those en-
tered into with Massachusetts a survey of New J ersey Was commenced,
and one topographic party, aided by two subordinate parties, was as-
signed to the work. Professor Cook, State geologist, kindly under-
took the direction of this force. With the exception of a small area in
Sussex County all the northern counties had been completed under
State direction. During the field season Sussex was finished and con-
siderable progress made in Monmouth and Ocean Counties. The area
surveyed up to December 31 was 1,082 square miles.

Appalachian District.—During the previous season the chief geogra-
pher of the Survey had given much of his time to the supervision of
the work of his district. His withdrawal to New England made it
necessary to secure the services,of some other competent geographer,
and Mr. Gilbert Thompson was relieved from the direction of the Cali-
fornia district, and placed in charge of the Appalachian. Before the
15th of July the large force assigned to this district was organized
into seven principal parties and field-work commenced. These parties
operated in Eastern Maryland, Northeastern and Southwestern West
Virginia, Western Virginia, Hastern Kentucky, Eastern Tennessee,
Mastern North Carolina, and in Northern Alabama and Georgia. The
total area covered in these States was 17 ,466 square miles. This work
required the construction of between 8,000 and 9,000 square miles of
triangulation and the connection of portions of it with the triangula-
tion of the Coast and Geodetic Survey.

Divisions of the South Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains.

Heretofore topography was undertaken only in the latter division,
but the increased appropriation permitted its extension into the former
also. As Prof. A. H. Thompson had previously been in charge of the
parties in this region the additional territory was also placed under his
Management.

Missouri and Kansas.—One topographic party was sent into each of
these States, and in addition to this an astronomic party took the field
for the purpose of making observations from which to determine the
positions to be used by the topographers as a basis for their work.

In anticipation of the extension of the survey into these States, much

valuable topographic material was compiled from all available sources
before the parties left for the West; and, as in many cases it was only
80 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

necessary to add the elements of relief and culture to the plats, rapid
progress was made. It is estimated that not less than 15,000 square
miles were covered by the two parties during the season. ~*

Texas.—The work in Texas was successfully inaugurated about Au-
gust 1, the chiefs of three parties and their assistants reporting at that
time at Austin, Tex. As no work had heretofore been done in this dis-
trict, the establishment of a base-line and the connection of the trian-
gulation with that of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was necessary.
As it is a region of small details, and this, together with the presence of
much timber and embarrassing atmospheric conditions, made the work
tedious. Nevertheless, the party succeeded in covering an area of
4,000 square miles.

Arizona and Nevada.—Work having been carried on in this region
during previous years, there was but little delay in putting into the
field the three parties—one triangulation and two topographic—assigned
to this district. As this is the region peculiarly favorable to topographic
work, the unusual area of 36,900 square miles was surveyed.

Yellowstone National Park.—The topographic work in the Park re-
mained in the charge of Mr. John H. Renshawe, who, with three parties,
carried forward the survey from the points where it was discontinued at the
close of the last season. One thousand square miles were added to the
area already surveyed, leaving one-half of the Park yet to be completed.
This, however, is a rugged, mountainous district, unfavorable to rapid
work, and it is expected that future progress will be slow. Recent at-
tempted legislation concerning the Park boundaries and the relation
thereto of settlers’ vested rights add interest to this survey.

Division of the Great Basin.

As previously stated, geologic work in this division was discontinued.
A certain amount of topographic work was done, however, by reason of
the extension of the survey across the western boundary of Arizona into
the southern part of Nevada—the object of this extension being to unite
large areas already surveyed.

Division of the Pacific.

Northern California District.—Two parties were sent to California and
placed under the direction of Mr. Mark B. Kerr, who in previous years
had been in charge of parties under Mr. Gilbert Thompson’s direction.
In addition to covering 3,700 square miles, detailed surveys of 375
square miles within this same area were also made.

At the closing of this report all of the field parties were not in, but
sufficient data are at hand upon which to base the close estimate that an
area of nearly 80,000 square miles was surveyed during the year. The
reduction to permanent shape of this material will be taken up by the
different divisions immediately upon their return, and will be completed
before the close of the fiscal year.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 81
GEOLOGY.

For some time it had been the wish of the Director to extend geo-
logic investigation into certain fields which, owing to limited funds, it
had not been possible to study. It is very gratifying to note that at
the beginning of the fiscal year much was accomplished in this direction
by the addition of several eminent geologists to the Survey staff, as
well as by securing the active co-operation of others whose duties would
not admit of their assuming additional obligations. The former will
be mentioned specifically in referring to their respective fields of work;
the latter include such well-known scientists as Professor Hall, of the
Geological Survey of New York; Professor Newberry, of the School of
Mines, Columbia College, New York; Professor Safford, of the Geolog-
ical Survey of Tennessee; and Professor Cook, of the New Jersey State
Survey.

North Atlantic Division.

New England District—The discontinuance of the transcontinental
survey by the Northern Pacific Railroad left Prof. Raphael Pumpelly
free to engage in other lines of work, and his services were secured for
the direction of the investigations to be undertaken primarily in the
Archean formations of the Atlantic slope. The general plan of pro-
cedure will be to take up the investigations in New England and extend
them southward, at the same time carefully studying the many other
problems connected with this region. In pursuance of this plan, pre-
liminary reconnaissances were made in New England towards the close
of the current year.

Prof. N. S. Shaler, of Harvard University, who has given considera-
ble attention to the geology of New England, will be associated with
Professor Pumpelly in this task. Pending the final decision as to the
course to be pursued, Professor Shaler found time, with the aid of vol-
unteer assistants, to study the geologic history of Cape Cod; to con-
tinue his examination of the Narragansett coal fields; to examine criti-
cally 100 miles of the main shore line, obtaining valuable collections of
fossils therefrom; to make observations as to the evidences of recent
shoreline movements; to study the drift-sheet of this region; and to
bestow some attention on the phenomena connected with swamps.

Much information concerning the geology of New Jersey had already
been acquired by Prof. George H. Cook, the State geologist, and the pub-
lication of the material provided for by the State. Under arrangements
with Professor Cook the paleontology of New Jersey is to be published
hereafter by the United States Geological Survey. A reference to the
paragraph on “ Publications” will show that the carrying out of this plan
has been commenced through the publication by theSurvey of Whitfield’s
“Brachiopoda and Lamellibrancbiata.” It has already been noted that
Professor Cook, in addition to his geologic duties, undertook the man-
agement of the mapping of the unsurveyed portions of the State.

82 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
South Atlantic Division.

Appalachian District.—At the time of the withdrawal of Mr. G. K.
Gilbert from the District of the Great Basin, he had in course of prepara-
tion an elaborate memoir, embodying the results of his investigations
concerning the ancient Lake Bonneville and its boundaries, while his
immediate assistant, Mr. Russell, was engaged in the preparation of a
like report upon Lake Lahontan and a paper upon the Mone Basin. For
these many illustrations had been made, and others that were being
drawn required constant supervision. Attention to this material occu-
pied much of Mr. Gilbert’s time, but early in the field season he found
opportunity to make a preliminary study of the structure of the Appa-
lachian system. For this purpose he proceeded, via Lynchburg, Va.,
to Asheville, N.C. From this point a series of excursions were made to
Mount Mitchell, Roan Mountain, and to the valleys of several of the
tributaries of the French Broad. The journey was then continued south-
ward across Tennessee, and as far into Georgia'as Ellijay. While the
object of this trip was the general study of the history of the Appala-
chian system, especial attention was given to that phase of it which is
represented by the ancient base-levels in the mountain valleys. Later
in the season Mr. Gilbert made similar observations upon the terraces
of the valleys of the Passumpsic, Connecticut, and Mohawk, for com-
parative purposes. In the mean time, he sent the assistant geologists,
who had previously acted in this region under the Director’s immediate
instructions, but who were now placed under his direction, to make a
detailed study of the geologic phenomena of the Kanawha Valley, West
Virginia, of the country in the vicinity of the White Sulphur Springs,
and of a portion of the great valley of eastern Tennessee. At the close
of the calendar year satisfactory progress was reported in these several
fields of work.

Division of the North Mississippi.

Glacial District—A summary of what was accomplished by Prof. T.
C. Chamberlin and his assistants shows six months’ of office duty in
connection with the previous season’s material and six months of out-
door work in extending the research into new fields. The first half of
the year was given to the preparation of a paper on ‘ Requisite and
Qualifying Conditions of Artesian Wells,” for the Director’s Fifth An-
nual Report, a report upon gravel deposits, and the collation of the ob-
servations made upon glacial striation. The field work of the last half
of the year included (1) an expansion of the previous studies of the drift-
less area of Wisconsin, Illinois, lowa, and Minnesota; (2) the continua-
tion of previous work in Dakota, more particularly the detailed study
of the moraines of the southern part, and a critical examination of their
relation to other deposits ; (3) the tracing of the outer limit of the north-
ern drift from the point to which it had been previously traced in Indi-
ana westward to the Mississippi River; (4) the study of the terraces of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 83

the Upper Ohio and the hypothetical effects of ice blockage; (5) the
more complete mapping of the osars of Maine, together with a critical
study of their structure, character, and relation; (6) a comparative study
of glaciated and unglaciated Archean knobs which occupy an isolated
position in the Silurian district of Central Wisconsin, and (7) a study of
the northern border of the Missouri Valley loess and its relation to other
members of the Quaternary series, as well as to altitude, topographic
features, and drainage systems.

The tracing of the boundary of the drift and loess was undertaken by
Professor Chamberlin in person. The limit of the drift will be indi-
cated in a manner by the statement that his examination carried him
across Northeastern Illinois, Southern Iowa, Southeastern and Central
Nebraska, as far west as Denver, Colo., thence into the Valley of the
Arkansas southward across Indian Territory to Northern Texas, and
thence eastward across the northern part of Louisiana to the flood-
plains of the Mississippi, and from this point northward through West-
ern Tennessee, Kentucky, and Eastern Missouri. The results of the in-
vestigations of Professor Chamberlin and his assistants will appear
from time to time in the form of monographs and bulletins.

Lake Superior District.—Office work in connection with the investiga-
tions of this division occupied the time of Prof. R. D. Irving and his
assistants until the weather permitted field exploration, which was at
once taken up and continued until nearly the close of the calendar year.
Professor Irving’s line of research lies mainly in the Cambrian and
Archean formations of the Lake Superior region. The assistants under
his direction were employed in the following fields: One was sent to
study the gneisses and granites of the Minnesota Valley, the results to be
used, in connection with data obtained last season, in preparing a bul-
letin on the gneisses and granites of Central Minnesota; another was
sent to the Gogebic Lake country of the northern peninsula of Mich-
igan for the purpose of connecting the Huronian of the Penokee region
of Wisconsin with that of the Marquette and Menominee regions of
Michigan; a third continued the studies previously made in the region
of the national boundary line in the vicinity of Knife Lake, Minne
sota—the object of the investigations being to determine the rela-
tion between the flat lying Animikie and the more northerly folded
schists; a fourth assistant was assigned a large area stretching from
Vermilion Lake, Minnesota, northeastwardly to its juncture with the
region in which the party just referred to operated, while for himself
Professor Irving reserved the necessary supervision of his subordinate
parties; a special study of portions of the Marquette region hitherto
unexplored, and a further examination of the exposures along the
national boundary-line, in the neighborhood of the Lake of the Woods.
The various parties had about completed the tasks assigned them and
returned to the Madison office for the purpose of elaborating the results
of this successful field season, when they had the misfortune to lose
84 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

much of the labor of this and previous years by the fire which occurred
in the Science building of the University of Wisconsin, on the night of
December 1. This conflagration destroyed most of their collections,
instruments, and field equipage; seriously damaged their field-notes,
manuscript text and accompanying illustrations, and a number of excel-
lent field-maps upon which the geology thus far determined had been
laid down, and also ruined a quantity of carefully-prepared micro-sec-
tions. At the time of the fire, Professor Irving and his assistants had
well under way papers upon the following subjects: (1) Observations
on the contact-line between the western sandstones and the copper-
bearing series on Keweenaw Point, to be issued jointly by Professors
Irving and Chamberlin; (2) Notes on the preliminary geologic map of
the region bounded by Lake Superior, the national boundary-line, and
the Saint Louis and Vermilion Rivers; (3) The geology of the region
between Gunflint and Knife Lakes; (4) The geology of the region west
of Knife Lake and lying between the national boundary-line, Vermilion
River, and the Mesabi Range; (5) The Penokee-Gogebic iron-bearing
series, and (6) The cherts, jaspers, and iron ores of the Huronian of
the Northwest. Professor Irving and his assistants at once set about
repairing the damage done by the fire, and while it will be possible to
reproduce much of this material, delay in its publication must neces-
sarily follow.
Rocky Mountain Division.

Montana District—Prof. F. V. Hayden and assistants continued in-
vestigations in Western Montana. The special field of work selected
was the eastern and northern sides of the Gallatin Valley, the west side
of the Bridger’s Range, and the country in the vicinity of the Forks of
the Missouri River. The object of the reconnaissance was the comple-
tion of the section of the Silurian and Cambrian formations which are
so well exposed in this region. In traveling to and from the field of
work a careful examination was made of the springs of Western and
Southeastern Montana, Idaho, and Utah, for the purpose of obtaining
data to be used in connection with the list of mineral springs of the
United States, which is being prepared by Dr. A. C. Peale.

The publication by the Geological Survey of Canada of the results of
investigations in British Columbia enabled Dr. Hayden to ascertain
with more definiteness the relation of the geology of the region being
studied by him to that of the country extending to the northward into
British Columbia.

Yellowstone Park District—By the last of June Mr. Arnold Hague and
assistants completed office-work in connection with the material coi-
lected during the previous season, and were ready to take the field. A
reference to the season’s work in detail shows. that it was only by adopt-
ing a comprehensive pian of procedure and dividing the force up into
small parties that it was possible to make the most of the short field-
season in the Park. <A careful compilation of such observations as had
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 85

been made from time to time upon the geysers enabled Mr. Hague to
institute a more systematic study of the changes and modifications,
Skilled observers were kept in the principal geyser basins, and as far as
possible the more remote and less active thermal springs were visited
and the phenomena connected therewith carefully noted. Two parties,
one of which was under Mr. Hague’s immediate direction, made a pre-
liminary study of the East Gallatin Range, which forms the northwest
boundary of the Park Plateau, and extends from Electric Peak south-
ward to Mount Holmes. Geologically considered, this range is a most
interesting one; every period from the Silurian to the Colorado Creta-
ceous being represented therein. A special study was made of the
Obsidian cliffs, and later in the season the voleanice rocks of the west
shore of the Yellowstone Lake, together with its Quaternary geology,
_ glacial phenomena, and ancient terrace-lines, were carefully worked up.

In connection with the geologic investigations, Mr. Hague also made
a preliminary examination of the region named in the bill before the
Forty-eighth Congress for addition to the Park reservation.

The several parties were compelled by reason of snow-storms to leave
the Park by the middle of October. Upon returning east the force of
this division were removed from their quarters in the American Museum
of Natural History, in New York, to the Survey building, in Washing-
ton.

Colorado District.—During the winter Mr. S. F. Emmons and assist-
ants made further study of the material collected from the Silver Cliff
mining district, and, as soon as the field season opened, topographic
and geologic work was taken up in the Gunnison district. In connec-
tion therewith, and in order that a better understanding might be ob-
tained of the Colorado Paleozoic and Mesozoic, a geologic section was
made along the Arkansas River, in the neighborhood of Salida. The
result of the season’s work will enable the geologists to lay down the
geology of the Gunnison. district upon the map of the region which
was prepared at the same time. As soon as the weather made further
research in these fields impossible, attention was turned to the geologic
phenomena of the Denver Basin, especial attention being given to the
source of the water-supply of its artesian wells. The investigations in
this region, dealing as they do with the mineral-bearing formations,
require a large amount of laboratory and microscopic work, in the course
of which some very interesting discoveries were made as to the oceur-
rence of minerals both in combinations and in localities in which they
were not supposed to exist. Tho results of these investigations of the
minerals of Colorado will appear at a future day in the form of a Bulletin.

District of the Pacific—At the close of the previous annual state-
ment, the investigations of Mr. George I’. Becker and his assistants in
the quicksilver deposits of Sulphur Bank and New Idria, California,
were sufficiently near completion to permit the entering upon new
fields. It was decided, therefore, to take up the study of the Knoxville
86 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

district, and the mines in the vicinity of Steamboat Springs, to be fol-
lowed later by an examination of the cinnabar deposits of Guadaloupe
and New Almaden. The climate of California makes field-work possi-
ble at all times of the year, and Mr. Becker kept in mind the desirability
of not only making a careful study of the surface geology of the area
immediately under investigation, but also of utilizing all trips to and
from the field of work for the purpose of obtaining a thorough knowl-
edge of the general geology of California, and its relation to the quick-
silver deposits. In addition to this, special trips were made whenever
necessary to localities thought to be instructive or furnishing any clue
to the solution of the geologic problems of this region. With such ends
in view, the construction of a geologic section through the Coast Kange
yas undertaken. In view of the extensive studies made by Mr. Becker
and his assistants, and as a check upon their conclusions concerning the
age of the quicksilver-bearing rocks of the Pacific coast, it seemed wise,
before proceeding further, to have some competent paleontologist review
the results obtained by the State survey and such other material as
had been procured recently by Mr. Becker. Dr. C. A. White was as-
signed this daty, and proceeding to California he first made a study
of the Chico, Tejon, and Miocene groups, and then, in company with
Mr. Becker, visited the several mining districts under consideration,
the Cretaceous and Paleozoic formations of Butte County, and certain
other localities on the McCloud River, and in Shasta and Mariposa
Counties. They then proceeded as far north as Eugene City, Oreg.,
for the purpose of examining a large and very instructive collection of
fossils in that city.
Much microseopie and chemice’ work has been accomplished in the
laboratory of this division, in connection with the cinnabar investiga-

tions.
Assistant Geologist Curtis completed his report on the Eureka min-

ing district, and early in the year proceeded to Washington to superin-
tend its publication. When not engaged in this task, his time was de-
voted to experimenting for the purpose of devising improved methods
for determining minute quantities of precious metals in ores.

Voleanic Rocks.—Having nearly completed the manuscript of his
memoir on the Hawaiian volcanoes, Capt. C. EK. Dutton, U. S. A., in
pursuance of his investigations relative to volcanic phenomena, pro-
ceeded to Fort Wingate, N. Mex., in July, for the purpose of making
a thorough examination of Mount Taylor and its vicinity, aregion which
in past time was one of great volcanic activity. Inthe mean time the
investigations previously conducted in the Cascade Range were not for-
gotten, and Assistant Geologist Diller spent the field season in the
neighborhood of Mount Shasta with most gratifying results. An area
embracing 400 square miles was explored; the successive lava-flows
which had taken place from the main crater, as well as from the many
vents upon the slopes of this extinct voleano, were traced; the limits of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 87

the glaciers and the accompanying phenomena were determined wiih as
inuch accuracy as possible, and collections were made which enabled
Mr. Diller to indicate on the map, prepared at the same time by a topo-
graphic party, the distribution of the material forming the successive
flows. A large number of photographie views were also taken, which,
with field-notes and sketches, will be invaluable in setting forth the
geology and topography of this interesting region.

Upon Mr. Diller’s return from the field, a well-equipped petrographic
laboratory was fitted up under his direction in the Survey building,
and an opportunity thus afforded for the microscopic study of the col-
lections of the various divisions. In connection with this laboratory it
was found possible to arrange abundant facilities for the preparation of
micro-sections. Under Mr. Diller’s management most gratifying results
have already been obtained from this much-needed acquisition to the
Survey’s equipment. In the last quarter of the year alone 512 micro-
sections were made.

Coal-fields of the Great Sioux Reservation.—On January 3, the honora-
ble the Secretary of the Interior instructed the Director of the Survey to
have made a geologic survey of the Great Sioux Reservation, for the
purpose of determining the extent and value of such coal-fields as might
be found. It was not practicable to undertake this task until the spring.
At that time the services of Mr. Bailey Willis were secured, and he, with
a party, was sent to Dakota. In addition to the geologic investigations
prosecuted by Mr. Willis, he also superintended the preparation of a
map of 2,000 square miles, embracing all of the area in which it was ex-
pected the so-called coal-fields would be found. Before the close of the
year Mr. Willis had completed his report, and it only awaited the prepara-
tion of the map to be forwarded to the Secretary of the Interior. While
the details of this report cannot be given here, it may be briefly stated
that the coal-beds were found to be confined to restricted areas, and to
be of but little if any value for commercial or domestic purposes.

Geologic map of the United States.—The geologic map commenced in
1883 was completed and placed in the hands of the engraver. It was
found, after, collating all available data, that our knowledge is not suffi-
cient to warrant the extension of geologic colors over the entire territory
of the United States. Accordingly, California, Oregon, and parts of
Montona, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas re-
main uncolored.

This map will be issued in two editions within a few months. The
first edition will be colored in accordance with the scheme previously
adopted and published by the Survey. It will form one of the plates of
the Fifth Annual Report of the Director, and abrief explanatory statement
will accompany it. A second edition, with complete explanatory text,
will be issued as a bulletin. In this edition the map will be printed in
duplicate, one copy colored in accordance with the published scheme
and the other in accordance with a scheme now under consideration. It

The sources of the information incorporated in the map are: first,
published maps, and second, manuscript maps prepared for the Survey
by different official and amateur geologists. As the colors have not
been carried beyond the boundaries of the original maps, this geologic
map may be regarded as an accurate representation of our present
knowledge of the distribution of American rock-groups.

The map, together with the explanatory text, was prepared by Mr.
W J McGee.

Geology of the District of Columbia.

The investigation of the superficial deposits, and the littoral and
fluviatile terraces of the District of Columbia and contiguous territory,
commenced in 1883 by Mr. W J McGee, were continued. A recon-
noissance was extended over an area of 1,000 square miles having the
District of Columbia as its center. In addition, short journeys to the
northward and southward were made for the purpose of correlating the
deposits with those already known in other localities; and, with the
same object in view, the literature of the Orange Sand and Stratified
Drift of the Gulf States, and the glacial “ Quaternary,” and accociated
deposits of the Atlantic States, were studied. In the prosecution of his
work Mr. McGee found it necessary to extend his observations into the
interior. The Potomac was followed as far as Cumberland, Maryland,
and the south branch of that river explored to its source in the elevated
tract near the center of the Virginias. Then crossing the main range
of the Alleghanies, Mr. McGee descended the Cheat, Monongahela, and
Ohio to Wheeling, West Virginia, re-examining the base-level, fluvia-
tile, and lacustral terraces already noted by others on those rivers,

The necessity for increasing the topographic force in New England
delayed the construction of the map of this area; but arrangements
have been made for its completion, and Mr. MeGee will thus be enabled
to present in comprehensive form the complicated phenoma of the region
which he has under study.

PALEONTOLOGY.

A few changes were made in the distribution of the work of the pale-
ontologic corps, looking to its greater systematization and effective-
ness. Certain independent parties which had previously been under
the immediate instruction of the director were assigned to duty under
the chiefs of division, and the paleontologic corps was increased by the
acquisitionof Dr. W. H. Dall, formerly of the Coast and Geodetic Survey.

Vertebrates.—Prof. O. C. Marsh’s personal work was confined to the
preparation of the manuscript and illustrations of his volumes on the
Dinocerata and the Sauropoda, and to the administrative duties of his
division. The former monograph was about ready for publication at
the end of the year. »Early in the spring four field parties were sent
out, two to the Jurassic beds of Wyoming, one to the same horizon in
Colorado, and one to Northern Kansas. There was received from these
parties during the year an unusually large amount of material. heir
success in collecting Pliocene mammals in Kansas, and the remains of
Dinosaurs in Colorado and Wyoming was marked—119 boxes having
been taken from one locality in Kansas alone. Upon the approach of
the winter season the collecting parties were transferred to Texas where
the weather is such as to permit exploration throughout the entire year.

Paleozoic Invertebrates—During the winter months Mr. C. D. Wal-
cott, the chief of this division, was engaged in the preparation of a re-
port on the Paleontology of the Eureka District, to accompany the
monograph of Mr. J. 8S. Curtis on the Silver-Lead Deposits of this
same region.

The plan of field work for the summer embraced the study by Mr.
Walcott in person of the Cambrian system in Eastern New York and
Western Vermont, including the preparation of numerous geologic sec-
tions and the collection of a large series of fossils; the continuance by
Assistant Geologist Williams of his investigations in the Devonian and
Lower Carboniferous in Western New York and Northern Pennsylvania
on about the same plan as that pursued in 1883, and the sending out of
collectors to obtain fossils from the Potsdam and Lower Magnesian form-
ations of Wisconsin and Eastern Minnesota, and from the Cambrian of
Northern Alabama. The latter part of this plan was satisfactorily carried
out, but in the midst of his investigations in Vermont and New York Mr.
Walcott was recalled, in conformity with the wish of the Honorable the
Secretary of the Interior, who desired that a competent geologist of the
Survey be designated to act as a member of a commission to examine
supposed coal-bearing areas on the White Mountain Indian Reservation,
90 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

in Arizona. Upon the completion of the field work in contiection with
this duty, Mr. Walcott proceeded to Texas and made a brief study of the
Paleozoic rocks in Burnet, Llano, San Saba, and Lampasas.Counties.
Though the study of these areas was limited, some very satisfactory
results were obtained. After his return from the south it was too late
to resume the investigations which he had abandoned in Vermont and
New York.

On November 26 Mr. Walecott’s report on the Deer Creek coal-fields
of the San Carlos Indian Reservation was forwarded to the honorable
the Secretary of the Interior.

Mesozoic Paleontology.—The paleontologic work of the division un-
der the direction of Dr. C. A. White included the examination of the
collections made by Mr. Becker on the Pacific coast. The successful
completion of this task has already been noted in the reference to that
division. Much preliminary work in connection with this duty was
performed by Dr. White, and to this and to the study of his own col-
lections he gave most of his time until his departure for the West in
early June.

The arrangement of fossils for installation in the National Museam—
a task which Dr. White superintends by reason of his curatorship in the
National Museum—demanded much of the time and attention of his as-
sistants during the winter season. This included the preparation of a
catalogue of the type-specimens of this division for insertion in the re-
port of the Director of the National Museum.

The preparation of an index-catalogue of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic
fossils was undertaken by Dr. White, and such satisfactory progress
made that it is believed its publication in 1885 will be possible.

On the opening of the field season and during the absence of Dr.
White, collecting parties proceeded to such localities in the southern
Appalachian District as contained formations which come under this
division. On returning from California in September, Dr. White at
once began the preparation of a report upon the Pacifie coast collec-
tions. This was about completed at the close of the year.

Cenozoic Invertebrates.—A_ systematic study of the Invertebrates of -
the Quaternary has long been an unfilled want in the paleontologic
work. In September the Survey was so fortunate as to secure the
services of Dr. W. H. Dall, who immediately entered upon his duties.
As a preliminary step, he began putting the large collections which
had accumulated from time to time in such shape that while under
study they can be utilized as’a means of identification for incoming
material. This task, in conjunction with the necessary attention to the
routine duties connected with this division furnished work for several
months. r

Paleo-botany.—No field-work was urdertaken by Prof. L. F. Ward
during 1884, his large collections made heretofore occupying his entire
time and attention. His especial line ¢f study was the collections ob-
; REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 91

tained by him from the region of the Upper Mississippi, and the Yel-
lowstone during the previous summer. In connection therewith he
also undertook the compilation of a general compendium of paleobot-
any; substantially a digest of the history and present status of the
science. Such a work, dealing largely with the literature of the sub-
ject, has come to be very important, if not indispensable to the proper
utilization of American material in geologic work. The preliminary
part of this volume, a sketch of paleobotany, illustrated with figures
and tables, will appear in the Director’s Fifth Annual Report.

Under Professor Ward’s direction there was prepared a catalogue of
the species of fossil plants in the National Museum, thus rendering the
collection much more valuable for purposes of reference.

Prof. W. M. Fontaine’s plan of work for the year was to continue his
investigation of the Mesozoic fossil-plants by means of the material al-
ready collected until the opening of the field season, and then to make
further collections froin this formation in localities to the north and east
of Fredericksburg, Va. The latter was successfully accomplished in a
brief tour, and Professor Fontaine then returned to the elaborating of
field-notes and the describing and figuring of type specimens.

Though engaged in the special line of work referred to, Professor
Fontaine also made a careful study of the general geology of the regions
visited in the course of his investigations. He believes that some of
his discoveries will definitely determine the status of certain forma-
tions whose character have been considered uncertain.

CHEMISTRY.

The effectiveness of the laboratory service was greatly increased by
the addition to the force of several experts and by the removal of the
New Haven physical laboratory to Washington. This latter was ren-
dered possible by the kindness of the director of the National Museum,
who, as previously stated, permitted the laboratories to oceupy the
rooms in the Museum vacated by the office of the Director of the Sur-
vey. The fitting up of these rooms for this purpose was begun in Octo-
ber, and before the close of the year the combined forces of the two
laboratories were busily at work again under Professor Clarke’s diree-
tion.

During the year there were made a large number of analyses of
mineral waters, sediments from mineral springs, minerals and clays, as
well as a large number of assays of mineral-bearing ores. Original
research was «lso prosecuted. This included new methods for the de-
termination of titanium in rocks, for the determination of minute quan-
tities of the precious metals in ores, and investigations concerning the
precipitated silicates of lime, aluminum, and magnesium, this latter
being fundamental to the study of the natural silicates.

Upon the opening of the field season Assistant Chemist Chatard pro-
ceeded to North Carolina for the purpose of obtaining specimens from
92 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the corundum fields of that region, and Doctors Gooch and Hallock were
sent to the Yellowstone National Park to make special studies of the
geyser phenomena. Bulletins setting forth the results obtained will be
issued in the due course of time.

In his capacity as a Curator of the National Museum, Professor Clarke
gave considerable time and attention to the arrangement of the mineral-
ogic collection to be exhibited at the New Orleans Exposition.

For some time prior to the removal of the physical laboratory from
New Haven, experiments were made for the determination of high tem-
peratures by means of thermo-electric couples. This line of research is
of importance, opening up, as it does, a wider range of investigation than
had heretofore been possible.

Before the close of the year there was sent to the press, a Bulletin by Dr.
Carl Barus, on the Electric and Magnetic Properties of Iron-Carburets,
the result of laboratory investigations.

The above reference to chemic work does not include analyses and
special mineralogic studies made by such divisions of the Survey as it is
not practicable to bring to Washington.

STATISTICS.

Mineral Resources of the United States.—As soon as it became practica-
ble to begin the collection of statistics concerning the mineral resources
of the United States other than gold and silver, the preparation of a see-
ond report was taken up by Mr. Albert Williams, jr. While this report
follows the general form and scope of the previous volume, and is in itself
complete, from a statistical and trade point of view, it complements the
latter in the matter of description of localities, metallurgic processes, &e.
A new feature will be the introduction of a series of graphic tables show-
ing at a glance the progress in the several industries. While adding but
a trifle to the cost of the publication, this scheme contributes greatly to
its effectiveness.

At the close of the year the statistics for 1883 were in shape for print-
ing, and progress made as far as possible in the collection of those for
1884. As soon as these are obtained the volume will be ready for the
printer.

PUBLICATIONS.

Believing that it will prove of value to the many readers of the Smith-
sonian Report, for purposes of reference, there is appended hereto, in
somewhat condensed form, the contents of the circular issued by the
Survey concerning its publications.

The publications of the United States Geological Survey are issued
in accordance with the statute approved March 3, 1879, which declares
that—

“ The publications of the Geological Survey shall consist of the an-
nual report of operations, geological and economic maps illustrating the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 93

resources and classification of the lands, and reports upon general and
economic geology and paleontology. The annual report of operations
of the Geological Survey shall accompany the annual report of the See-
retary of the Interior. All special memoirs and reports of said survey
shall be issued in uniform quarto series if deemed necessary by the Di-
rector, but otherwise in ordinary octavos. Three thousand copies of
each shall be published for scientific exchanges and for sale at the price
of publication ; and all literary and cartographic materials received in
exchange shall be the property of the United States, and form a part of
the library of the organization: And the money resulting from the sale
of such publications shall be covered into the Treasury of the United
States.”

On July 7, 1882, the following joint resolution, referring to all Gov-
ernment publications, was passed by Congress :

“That whenever any document or report shall be ordered printed by
Congress, there shall be printed, in addition to the number in each case
stated, the ‘usual number’ [1,900] of copies for binding and distribu-
tion among those entitled to receive them.”

Under these general laws it will be seen that none of the Survey pub-
lications are furnished to it for gratuitous distribution. The 3,000 copies
of the annual report are distributed through the document rooms of
Congress. The 1,900 copies of each of the publications are distributed
to the officers of the legislative and executive departments, and to stated
depositories throughout the United States.

Except, therefore, in those cases where an extra number of any pub-
lication is supplied to this office by special resolution of Congress, as
has been done in the case of the second, third, fourth, and fifth annual
reports, or where a number has been ordered for its use by the Secre-
tary of the Interior, as in the case of Mineral Resources, and Dictionary
of Altitudes, the Survey has no copies of any of its publications for gra-
tuitous distribution. The gratuitous edition of the Mineral Resources
is entirely exhausted. |

STATISTICAL PAPERS.

A fourth series of publications, having special reference We the mineral resources of
the United States, is contemplated.

COLLECTIONS.

During the year the collections of the Survey were increased by the
addition of 317 boxes of rocks, minerals, and fossils. This does not in-
clude the collections received at New Haven by Professor Marsh ; nor
the material collected by certain of the divisions of the Survey having
permanent headquarters elsewhere than in Washington, and held by
them temporarily for study.

UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION.

As in previous years, 1 include in my report to the Board of Regents
the principal facts connected with the work prosecuted by the United
States Fish Commission during each year, as, under the appointment
_ of the President, I exercise the function of United States Fish Com-
missioner. It is not necessary to go into any special detail in this con-
nection, as the Reports and the Bulletins of the Commission contain a
full account of progress during the year. The reports for 1882 and 1583
bring the subject up to the end of the latter year; and the continuation
for 1884 consists, for the most part, in carrying out the plans already
initiated in some respects on a larger scale.

Owing to the peculiarities of the season, the yield of eggs at the
shad-hatching stations near Washington was not as productive as in
previous years. The young shad hatched from these eggs were care-
96 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

fully distributed at many distant points, where they will no doubt exer-
cise a very important function in connection with the stocking of the
rivers of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts with shad.

The calls upon the Commission for the German carp have continued
to increase, and have been met as far as the stock at command would
allow. Twice the number of fish bred in the ponds in Washington
could have been disposed of had they been in our possession.

The two cars constructed expressly for the purpose of transporting
the fish to different parts of the country have proved extremely servy-
iceable; and Congress authorized the building of a third car, which
will be available in the early part of 1885. This contains many improv-
ments over the others, and will be of great value in the work of the
Commission.

The distribution of eggs of the Penobscot and land-locked salmon
from the stations in Maine has been satisfactory, as in former years,
the product of the stations being forwarded to such points in the United
States as promise to be the most suitable.

In no year since the establishment of the Commission have there
been so many eggs of whitefish taken at the two stations in Michigan,
about one hundred and fifty millions being the actual yield. This fish
is growing in favor, and there are numerous demands for it.

A large increase has been made in the distribution of the California
trout, a fish that promises to be of great service in localities where the
common brook-trout of the Eastern States cannot be maintained in
proper condition.

The usual annual Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission has
been published, making the fourth volume in the series. It contains
many interesting communications which are very much sought after.

In previous reports mention has been made of the seacoast station at
Wood’s Holl, a point specially adapted for carrying out the work of the
United States Fish Commission.

After having devoted a number of years to the improvement of the
river fisheries of the United States, especially those of the salmon,
shad, whitefish, &c., attention was turned to the fish inhabiting the
ocean, with a view of determining the possibility of multiplying them
to a profitable degree. The first experiments in this direction were
mostly made at Gloucester, Mass., in the winter of 1878~79, and were
so satisfactory, in spite of the inclemency of the winter weather, dur-
ing which the work is carried on, that it was determined, as soon as a
suitable site could be obtained on the south coast of New England, to
prosecute the work there on a large scale.

Wood’s Holl combining all the requirements in a greater degree than
could be found eisewhere, the first subject to be taken into considera-
tion was that of acquiring the ground on which to erect the buildings.
This was done by the liberality of several citizens of Massachusetts,
and of the Old Colony Railroad Company, supplemented by contribu-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 97

tions from various collegiate establishments which desired to utilize
the expected opportunities in the interest of education. An appropri-
ate strip of ground was thus secured and presented by the donors to the
United States for use by the Commission. After the State of Massa-
chusetts had formally ceded its jurisdiction the donation was accepted
and an appropriation made for the necessary buildings. A concur-
rent appropriation, in the interests of commerce and navigation, for the
construction of a harbor of refuge, and expended by the Engineer
Bureau, was found to embrace all the requirements for locality, and
the station as now organized comprises a hollow basin of about an acre
in extent, in which pens and inclosures for fish can be made; and a
wharf outside forming a suitable landing-place for coaling vessels, ete.
An abundance of fresh water, and in addition an unlimited supply of
salt water, complete the desiderata.

The building for the accommodation of persons connected with the
Commission is completed, and was occupied during the past summer,
and the fish-hatchery and laboratory will be ready for the season of 1885.

The work of hatching codfish is now under way, with promise of entire
success.

The inquiries of the Commission in connection with the occurrence on
the coast and their distribution of useful fishes, mollusks, &c.; its in-
vestigations into the character of the sea-bottom, and its suggestions as
to its ability to support sea fishes, furnish large numbers of specimens
of a great variety of species. These are carefully investigated by spe-
cialists connected with the Commission, and minutely detailed and
described in its reports. After making selections for the benefit of the
National Museum the duplicates are assorted, labeled, and made up
into sets for distribution to colleges and academies. The number of
sets already distributed amounts to several hundreds, the specimens in
each set being carefully identified and labeled. No more acceptable
contribution could be made to a college or academy, in view of the ab-
solute impossibility of obtaining such objects from any other source,
even without regard to cost.

The opportunities afforded at the sea-coast stations of the Commission
for scientific research have, for many years, induced the presence of
some of the most distinguished specialists in natural history and biology
in this country,and many more persons apply for a share in the benefits
than can be accommodated, although the material collected is usually
in sufficient abundance for the needs of a large number of inquirers.

In order to utilize the surplus material and facilities of the Wood’s Holl
station in the interest of such parties it was thought desirable to obtain
control of a tract of about two acres of ground immediately adjacent to
the premises of the Commission, and in every way suitable for the erec-
tion of supplemental buildings, in which outside students could be ac-
commodated and find the necessary facilities for work without interfer.
ing with the operations of the Commission. A friend of science accordin gL?

purchased ground at a cost of about $2,500, and holds it for future ac-
tion. It is proposed to subdivide this into six lots, and to furnish the
use of these lots to as many scientific establishments in the country as
ean be accommodated, all the expenses of erection of the necessary
buildings and their maintenance to be cared for by the establishments in
question.

A question, however, has arisen as to the control of the ground so as
to secure proper co-ordination of action on the part of tenants, and pre-
vent any use other than for the purely scientific purposes originally con-
templated.

The owner of the ground, desiring to secure permanent supervision
over it, wishes to deed it to the Smithsonian Institution, and I respect-
fully refer the subject to the Board for its action.

No money, either now or hereafter, is asked or expected from the In-
stitution, but simply that it shall administer the trust referred to as
coming strictly within its province—that of the ‘increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men.”

Respectfully submitted,
SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution.

APPENDIX TO THE SECRETARY’S REPORT.

REPORT ON SMITHSONIAN EXCHANGES FOR 1884.
By GEORGE H. BOEHMER.

One of the principal events of the year was the removal from a tem-
porary location in the central hall of the Smithsonian building to the
new quarters assigned in the east wing of the reconstructed fire-proof
portion of the building, taking place in the month of March, 1884. This
removal caused a temporary cessation of active operations, and conse-
quently a not inconsiderable accumulation of material, which, together
with the regular increase, crowded into the last nine months of the year
an unusual amount of work. Furthermore, my appointment to visit
Europe on business of exchange, and consequent absence since July—
during which time Mr. N. P. Scudder assumed the duties of my position
additional to his regular work as assistant in charge of the domestic
branch of the exchanges—diminished the active force of the depart-
ment; but notwithstanding all these disadvantages, the zealous and
efficient application of the various assistants to their respective duties
enabled them to overcome the obstacles, and to place the bureau in a
position to enter upon the work of a new year without any accumula-
tion.

The Record Division.—The duties of this office, as specified in the re-
port for 1883, have been performed by Miss J. C. Diebitschin a com-
mendable manner, and notwithstanding the large increase in the work,
the card catalogue alone now embracing 4,000 cards against 1,000 in
1883, and other multiplications of work—the files and records in this
division have been posted promptly and accurately, so as to admit of
momentary inspection of the accounts of exchanges kept with the vari-
ous foreign establishments—an advantage claimed for the system when
its acceptance was urged.

Foreign Exchange Division.—In February, owing to the transfer of
the assistant in charge of this branch of the service, Mr. F. V. Berry
was appointed in this place, and it is due to his energy and untiring
application to his duties that the unusual accumulations and constant
increase had been disposed of before the close of the year.

99
100 REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF EXCHANGES.

During the year 18,886, packages, with an aggregate weight of 78,732
pounds, have been received—an increase of 800 packages over the year
1883—which were sent in 537 boxes, this being 120 boxes more that in
1883. A detailed statement is presented in the appended general sta-
tistics.

Domestic Exchange Division.—As stated in the introductory, Mr. Seud-
der, the assistant in charge of this branch, had been appointed to as-
sume the duties of the office during my absence in Europe on business
of exchanges. Of the work performed in this division, I submit Mr.
Scudder’s report, as follows:

“The number of packages received and distributed to the United
States during the year 1884 was 10,236. Of these 8,094 were sent to
societies and 2,142 to individuals.

‘‘The number of packages distributed by the domestic exchange dur-
ing the year 1883 is somewhat (704) larger than the above, because of
a slight modification of the scope of this branch of the exchange.

“During the year 1883 packages for Canada were forwarded by the
domestic exchange, whereas in 1884 they were forwarded by the foreign
exchanges. Again, in 1883 and the first eight months of 1884, all books
for the Smithsonian Institution, whether received by mail or otherwise,
were entered on the exchange records, but for the last four months of
1884 all books for the Smithsonian Institution coming by mail were sent
direct to the Smithsonian Institution library without passing through
the exchanges.”

Government Exchange Division.—In last year’s report the suggestions
made in 1882, of placing this work in the hands of one assistant, to the
exclusion of any other duty, has been, in part at least, inaugurated.
A card catalogue has been prepared, and a clerk is intrusted with the
proper management of this duty, in addition to such other work as may
become necessary, like copying, &c., while the receiving and shipping
is still done by the assistant in charge of the foreign branch.

During the year the Government of England has agreed to a com-
plete exchange of all official documents, commencing with the 1st of
January, 1882, and preliminary arrangements have been made to the
same effect with the Government of Austria.

The receipts in this branch during the year are 22 boxes and 38,337
packages, with an aggregate of 32,827 pounds, while the transmissions
to foreign governments amount to 114 boxes, against 76 boxes in 1883.

_In the year 1881 special attention was invited to the large increase

in the reception of exchange parcels, the number for that year, 1881,
being 43,104; in 1882 this had increased to 58,047; in 1883 to 63,894;
and in 1884 to 65,170. In the report for 1882 it was respectfully sug-
gested that the receiving and distributing of all the incoming exchanges
be made a separate division of the service, and placed in the hands of
a tried competent assistant, since on the prompt and accurate per-
formance of this duty depends the punctuality of shipments of foreign,
domestic, and Government document exchanges.

Taking the present status of incoming parcels, we now receive on an
average over 200 parcels per day. These have to be assorted, arranged,
compared with the invoice—if such has been furnished, otherwise au
invoice has to be prepared—provided with the number corresponding to
the respective address in the list of foreign correspondents and in the
card catalogue, and distributed in the bins to await their turn of ship-
ment. Thus far this work has been performed—mostly at the expense
104 REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF EXCHANGES.

of other important duties—by the assistants of the respective depart-
ments to whom such incoming parcels are referred, and it is from
these considerations that the suggestion is now renewed and urged
that this branch of the service be placed in charge of an assistant, while
an additional clerk be employed to prepare, under his supervision, the
then remaining only mechanical portion of the foreign exchanges, the
shipping.
TRANSMISSIONS.

1. Foreign transportations.

An unusual number of boxes have been shipped during the year,
the increase over last year being 120, while from 1882 to 1883 an in-
crease of 70 boxes only was noticed. The following table furnishes a
comparison with former years:

REPORT ON EXPLORATIONS AND COLLECTIONS IN THE
QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS, BRITISH COLUMBIA.

By JAMES G. SWAN.

In 1873 I wrote a memoir on the Haidah Indians, of Queen Charlotte
Islands, which was published in the Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge (No. 267), January, 1874. In the advertisement the late
Professor Henry says that, ‘under the head of ethnology, it raises
some questions which seem of great significance, and which it is hoped
will lead to further investigations.” It was not, however, till 1883 that
an arrangement was effected, when, early in that year, I was sent by
Professor Baird to that interesting group of islands lying in the North
Pacific Ocean, off the coast of British Columbia, between lat. 51° 30/
and 54° 20/ north, to make collections and obtain useful information for
the United States Fish Commission, the National Museum, and the
Bureau of Ethnology.

On the 29th day of May, 1883, I left Port Townsend, Wash., for Vic-
toria, B. C., to make my arrangements for the cruise, by purchasing all
necessary stores and outfits, and securing a credit with the Hudson Bay
Company to make purchases and draw orders on their traders at Fort
Simpson, B.C.,and at Masset, on Graham Island, the largest of the Queen
Charlotte group. I also madea similar arrangement with the Skidegate
Oil Company to give orders on their store at their oil works, near Skide-
gate village, B. C. This was to enable me better to trade with Indians
for the procuring of specimens of their manufactures, and to avoid the
trouble and risk of carrying coin with me to those islands, and to ena-
ble me to keep an account of my expenditures in a more satisfactory
manner. Having completed my arrangements, I next secured the serv-
ices of an assistant and interpreter, a young Haidah Indian, a native
of the Klue or Cumshewa district on the eastern coast of Moresby
Island, the second largest of the Queen Charlotte Islands. This Indian,
whose name is Johnny Kit Elseva, I had personally known ‘for some
time as one of the most intelligent, faithful, and reliable natives I ever
have seen. To his qualifications as a cook and general servant he
added those of an interpreter; his knowledge of English, which he
speaks fluently, enabling him to understand me fully at all times. He
is also a working jeweler, skilled in making silver bracelets, ear-rings,
and charms, and a good carver in wood and stone. Heis also an artist,
and has drawn for me in India ink a series of mythological sketches

illustrative of the folk-lore of his tribe, and is still at work in finishing
137
138 REPORT ON THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS.

other sketches, which, when completed and fully described by me, will
be forwarded for the use of the Smithsonian Institution.

As the communication with Queen Charlotte Islands is very uncer-
tain I was obliged to wait for the steamer ‘‘ Otter,” which for many years
has made semi-annual voyages to the islands, going in the spring with
supplies for the Hudson Bay Company trading-post at Masset, and
with goods for the oil company at Skidegate, and returning in October
to take away the furs, fish, and oil that have been collected during the
season.

From some cause of delay the “Otter” did not leave Victoria until
Monday, June 18, when we made a start at noon for Masset via all
the trading stations and canneries on the route. I did not object to
this, as I was thereby enabled to see many places where I expected to
procure specimens, without additional cost for passage. As the detail
of a sea voyage would be unnecessary here, I will omit all mention of
it except of the places where we stopped.

The next day, June 19, we arrived at Alert Bay, on Cormorant Island,
the trading-post and cannery of Mr. Wesley Hudson, who has been there
a number of years, and takes an interest in scientific matters, and is
considered a reliable man in all his statements regarding fisheries, seals,
and other fur-bearing animals, and in Indian lore. I shall refer to this
gentleman in my general report.

At 11.45 p.m. we left Alert Bay and ran down Johnson’s Strait to
Queen Charlotte Sound, and at 1 p.m. on the 20th we arrived at the
canneries of Shotbolt & Co., at the head of River’s Inlet, where we dis-
charged some freight, and left at 2.30 p.m. In this inlet, besides Shot-
bolt’s canneries, are a saw-mill and canning establishment of Messrs.
Saunders and Warren, of Victoria, but I did not visit them, as the steamer
remained so short a time.

After leaving River’s Inlet we ran up Fitzhugh Sound to the Hudson
Bay Company’s trading-post of Bella Bella, where we arrived June 21 at
1.30 a. m., and left at 2. a. m. for the mouth of the Skeena River, where
there is another cannery, at a place called Port Essington, where we ar-
rived at midnight; but I did not go ashore, as we shortly left for Metla-
katla, where we arrived at 6.30 a. m. on Friday the 22d.

Shortly after our arrival Bishop Ridley, the bishop of the diocese,
came on board and kindly invited me to go ashore with him, which I
did, and was introduced by him to Rey. Mr. Collinson, one of the mis-
sionaries, who has a fine collection of fossils and Indian curiosities, which
he kindly showed me, but as I had but a short time to remain on shore
I made a hurried visit, which I would gladly have prolonged, and then
went to the residence of the Rev. Mr. Duncan, the founder of the Met-
lakatla mission, and the teacher and preacher to the Indians of the
Tsimsean tribe, who have a settlement at Metlakatla.

I was very cordially received by Mr. Duncan, who showed me some
blankets and shawls made by the mission Indians, and then took me to

REPORT ON THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS. 139

his cannery, where some fifty Indians, men and women, were engaged
canning salmon. Everything was scrupulously neat and clean, and the
whole work done with a precision and exactness which showed that
Indians can be taught to do such kind of work, and, when taught, are
as capable as a majority of white men, and are far preferable to Chinese.
Mr. Duncan next wished me to visit his church, which I desired very
much to do, but just then the whistle of the old steamer Otter gave the
signal for departure, and, escorted by Mr. Dunean, I returned on board,
and at 8.15 a. m. we left for the Hudson Bay Company’s post at Fort
Simpson, where we arrived at 12 o’clock noon.

Fort Simpson is situated on the mainland but a few miles south of
the boundary between British Columbia and Alaska. It is one of the
principal trading posts of the company, and is under charge of Mr. R. H.
Hall, from whom I purchased a quantity of Indian manufactures in
carved stone, to be sent by him to Victoria for me. I also saw Rev.
Thomas Crosby, Wesleyan missionary, from whom I purchased several
articles made by Tsimsean Indians, and then went with him to visit his
church and school. I found a marked improvement in the appearance
of Fort Simpson since I visited it seven years ago in the U.S. 5S.
“Wolcott.” The old unsightly Indian houses of former days had been
removed, and a pretty village of neat cottages surrounds the fine church,
and gives evidence of the skill and taste of the Indians, when encour-
aged by intelligent sympathy, to emulate the dwellings of white men.
The general effect of the village, when viewed from the anchorage, is
very pleasing, and would be creditable to any of our frontier towns.

At 1.30 P. M. we left Fort Simpson for Fort Wrangel, Alaska, where
we arrived the next morning (Saturday, 23d) at 8 o’elock.

At Fort Wrangel I purchased several articles of Indian manufacture,
and saw many more, but as they all came from Queen Charlotte Islands,
where I was going, 1 concluded to make my purchases there. Having
finished our business at Fort Wrangel we were ready to leave at noon, but
there being a very heavy seaand stormy SE. gale of wind all day we re-
mained until the next morning (Sunday, 24th). At 3 o’clock we started
and ran down Stachinski Strait into Duke of Clarence Strait, where we
encountered a stormy head wind and heavy head sea, which retarded
our progress till the next morning (Monday the 25th), when we had a
terrific time with a stormy tide-rip and SE. gale, which tossed the old
steamer as if she were an egg-shell. At 2 Pp. M. the wind and sea went
down and we soon got out of Clarence Strait into Dixon’s Entrance and
ran across to Masset Inlet, north end of Graham Island, and anchored
off the Hudson Bay Company’s post at Uttewas village, two miles up
the inlet, where I was kindly and most hospitably received by Alex-
ander McKenzie, esq., the company’s agent at Masset, who furnished
me comfortable quarters in a cottage within the company’s inclosure.

Masset is a very pretty place, situated on the east side of Masset Inlet.
The land is low and level, and covered with dense foliage of evergreen
140 REPORT ON THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS.

trees, spruce, hemlock, and cedar, and an undergrowth of shrubbery,
rose bushes, wild currant, raspberry, and hazel, with much open grass-
land, on which wild strawberries are found in great quantities, of un-
usual size and superior flavor. Strawberries and wild roses seem to be
a specialty at Masset, and are noted by every person who visits Gra-
ham Island in June.

Masset is the site of the Indian town of Uttewas, a village containing
65 houses old and new, some of them deserted and in ruins; nearly every
house has a carved column erected in front covered with heraldic or
totemic designs of the family residing within. These columns are pic-
ture writings and illustrate the folk-lore of the tribe, and most of them
are allegorical or mythical fables which I succeeded in deciphering, and
my account of them, with illustrations, will be prepared by me for my
complete monograph on Queen Charlotte Islands.

Fish.—The principal fish used by the Masset Indians for food is the
halibut, which abounds in the waters of the inlet and along the whole
of the north shore of Graham Island. Several varieties of salmon ran
up Masset Inlet, one of which, a small variety called by the Haiddhs
“ Swagan” (O. keta, Walb.), is as fat and fine flavored as the Quenaiult
salmon of the same variety, and is taken in considerable quantities by
the natives, as is also a fine quality of salmon trout which are taken in
weirs and traps in the small creeks which empty into the inlet. The
dog salmon (0. kisutch, Walb.) is taken in the fall in considerable num-
bers for winter use. Dogfish abound, and a large quantity of their oil
is collected by the Hudson Bay Company every season from the In-
dians.

Codtfish (Gadus morrhua) seem to breed in the waters of Masset Inlet,
where I procured several specimens from 14 to 2 inches long, which
I preserved in alcohol. Mr. McKenzie, the Hudson Bay Company’s
trader, purchased a few hundred pounds of true cod from the Indians
which he salted in kench. I atesome of them and they were quite equal
to pickled eastern cod, but the Haidahs do not seem to care for them,
and when occasionally they catch the cod while fishing for halibut, they
are always ready to sell them to white men. From what the Indians
told me, and from my own observation, I think the true cod abound all
along the northern and western coast of the whole group. These, with
the Ophiodon elongatus, Kultus cod, or inferior cod, several species of
Sebastichthys, and the black cod (Anoplopoma fimbria), lamprey, eels,
herring, smelt, &c., form an extensive and plentiful variety of food-fish.

Of the plants observed by me, were Abronia arenaria, L.; Lupinus
Nootkatensis, Donn; Ranunculus Nelsoni, Gray; Rubus ursinus (Cham.),
Schl.; Nutkanna mocino, R.; Spergularia, Pursh., Rosa Nutkana, Presl;
Epilobium angustifolium, L.; Erigeron salsuginosus, Gr.; Campanula
Scheuchzert, Gray; Gaultheria Shallon, Pursh.; Mimulus luteus, Willd;
Castilleta pallida, Kunth; Aquilegia formosa, Fisch.; Gentiana Amarella,
L.; Pinus contorta, Douglas; Abies Engelmanni, Parry; A. amabilis,

Forbes ; Thuya gigantea, Nutt ; Cupressus Nutkatensis, Lamb; Fritillaria
lanceolata, Hook; Fragaria Chilensis, Duchesne; Mahonia, Berberis Aqui-
folium, &e. All of the foregoing I observed in the vicinity of Masset,
and along the north shore of Graham Island. All of them are identical
with the plants at Cape Flattery, Wasb., except the Cupressus Nutka-
tensis, and the Castilleia pallida, which latter at Cape Flattery is bright
red, while at Masset and elsewhere on Queen Charlotte Islands it is
pale yellow.

Collections.—1 was fortunate while at Masset in obtaining articles of
great interest, such as models of ancient war canoes, salmon and trout
nets, stone mortars, hammers, mauls, carved boxes, carved dishes of
wood and horn. But the objects of the greatest interest to me were five
images, three inches long, made of pure native copper by swedging
and cutting. These images represent naked men and women dancing.
They were worn at the belt in front of the person dancing, and made a
tinkling sound.

I procured them of an old woman, who told me that they had been in
her family before her great grandmother could remember. The legend
respecting them is that an ancestor of hers while on a trading excursion
to Sitka procured them of an Atna or Copper River Indian from the
tribe of that name to the northwest of Sitka. These images were con-
sidered of such value that I was offered a large sum if I would part with
them, which I declined, as I considered them the best proof I have seen
of the ancient intercourse between the Aztecs of Mexico and the tribes
of the Northwest coast. On my subsequent return to Victoria, Mr.
Alexander McKenzie, who had come from Masset, mentioned about
these copper images on board Her Majesty’s ship Swiftsure, then lying
in Esquinault Harbor. The surgeon of the ship, Dr. Moore, produced
a silver image, 14 inches long, which he had procured at Guatemala
during the summer of 1883. This was made of pure nugget silver, and
had been worn by a lady as a charm and suspended to the neck by a
ribbon through a ring on the top of the head of the image. Mr. Me-
Kenzie was so struck with the similarity of design with the copper
images that he borrowed it of Surgeon Moore, and had it photographed
in four different positions. By comparing the two photographs the
Aztec style seems to be seen in both alike.

I also found in the grave of an old doctor, or skaga, who had been
dead fifty years or more, a couple of carved tusks, which I at first
thought were those of a peeccary or Mexican wild hog, but subsequent
examination in Washington proved them to be the babyroussa or Asi-
atic wild hog, and the question is how they reached Queen Charlotte
Island. A gentleman, long a resident in Japan, informs me that the
Siamese junks are accustomed to trade on the African coast, running
down with the northeast monsoons and returning with the southwest
monsoon. These Siamese junks bring everything they can get, and
trade with the Japanese and Chinese. These Japanese or Siamese junks
142 REPORT ON THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS.

have been frequently wrecked on the northwest coast, and in 1831 one
of these junks was-wrecked on the Queen Charlotte Islands, and we have
records which show that in 1694 a Japanese junk was wrecked on the
Kamtchatkan coast. And at various intervals since that date we find
five junks reported as being wrecked on the northwest coast, previous
to the one I have mentioned in 1831. It is therefore easy to assume as
a logical conclusion that the tusks of the babyroussa were procured
from the wreck of some one of those old junks and became the property
of the old shaman, and from their rarity were considered a highly
prized medicine, which were buried with their owner as some of his
treasures.

During my visit at Masset I went up the inlet and made several col-
lections in natural history. I also took occasion to study the manners
and customs of the Indians, which will be illustrated and explained in
my future report.

I remained at Masset until August 6, having been detained two weeks
waiting the return of the Indian who was to take me to North Island
and around the west coast to Skidegate. Everything being ready, I left
Masset on Monday, August 6, at 8.30 a.m., in a large canoe with seven
Indians, two of whom were boys thirteen or fourteen years of age.

The canoe was owned and commanded by ‘“ Edinso,” chief of North
Island, where I wished particularly to make examinations. Edinso for-
merly lived at a village called Kioosta, on the northwest end of Gra-
ham Island, opposite North Island. We camped that night at Yatze
village, a little to the west of Virago Sound, and the next morning,
August 7, at 5 o’clock, we broke camp and proceeded to Jalun River,
where we stopped for breakfast, the Indians meanwhile having speared
ten humpback salmon (0. gorbuscha).

At this place is a singular exhibit of volcanic action; the lava had

burst up through the superincumbent rocks as though the region had-

boiled like a pot. The lava was of a brick-red color, and in some places
a pale sulphur yellow, and filled with bowlders and pebbles of stone
blackened outside with the heat, and looking like a gigantic plum pud-
ding. This is the first instance I have seen of such an evident volcanic
action on the direct sea-beach.

From Jalun River we passed on leisurely, examining the shore from
the canoe as we went. At 1.30 we passed the pillar rock at Pillar Point,
and I made a sketch of the pillar, which shows quite different from Pro-
fessor Dawson’s sketch made from the shore, and gives a better idea of
the surrounding country.

At 2 p. m. we went ashore in Parry Passage and gathered some speci-
mens of shells, principally Heliotis and Pecten. I took the tempera-
ture of the water in Parry Passage, and found it 54°, air 60°, barometer
30, 31, and at 4 p.m. we landed at Kioosta village, where I pitched
my tent and remained till the 14th, visiting in the meantime North
Island, Cloak Bay, and two burial caves, in one of which I found a

REPORT ON THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS. 143

number of boxes, carved and painted, each of which contains the
mummified remains of former inhabitants of the near’ villages. The
prejudices of the Indians and my overloaded canoe did not permit me
to collect any specimens of those mummies, which I could easily have
done if I had been in a steamer. I collected many interesting speci-
mens of fish and mollusks, and could have procured more, but unfor-
tunately the net which had been made for my dredge before leaving
Port Townsend proved useless on trying it, as the man who made it for
me had made a mistake in its shape, which made it impossible to use it
in deep water. Had my dredge worked properly I could have obtained
many interesting mollusks in Parry Passage, which is a rich field for
the naturalist.

While at Kioosta village I made sketches of carved columns and
heraldic designs and my Indian assistant, Johnny, drew, in India ink, a
number of sketches illustrative of Indian legends, which when com-
pleted will furnish an interesting and valuable addition to the general
report of my summer’s work.

Near my camp at Kioosta village is the mausoleum or burial house
of old Doctor Koontz, a famous skaga or shaman, who died many
years ago and was famous in his time as a great medicine man. In his
grave I found the tusks of the babyroussa mentioned.

Directly opposite this point, on the southeast portion of North Island,
is Cloak Bay, made interesting by the mention of it by Captain Dion:
who named it in 1787, and Captain Marchand, a French navigator, who
visited it in 1791. My notes and pbsepyations made during my week’s
camp at Kioosta are too extensive to be inserted in this brief synopsis.

On Tuesday, August 14, we broke camp at Kioosta and started for
Skidegate at 10.20 A. M., with a fair tide which took us past Cape Knox,
the extreme northwest point of Graham Island, where we encountered
a tide-rip and rough cross-sea very dangerous to our heavily-laden
canoe. The wind now commencing to blow fresh from the south-
east with rain, we were forced to make a landing at a rocky point called
Klekwakoon, which we did at 1.30 Pp. M., and with difficulty scrambled
over a reef which extends out from the shore a considerable distance
and is bare at half tide. Iremained at this place till the 17th, being
unable to proceed owing to constant head wind and heavy sea. I oe-
cupied the time by explorations up and down the coast, collecting
curiosities and other fossils, and a few specimens of small cota and
other fish, and making notes of the appearance of the country, which
is thrown into various contorted and fantastic shapes by voleanie action.
It presents a most remarkable formation, and 1 regretted that I did not
have a photographic apparatus with me to have taken a view of the
scene, which it is impossible otherwise to describe.

I found quantities of drift stuff on the beaches and in the coves,
among which were logs, and broken boards of redwood from California,
144 REPORT ON THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS.

showing the northerly drift along the shores of Oregon, Washington
Territory, and British Columbia.

On Friday, August 17, I left Klekwakoon for the village of Tledoo,
near Susk or Frederick Island, at 9 a. m., and reached camp at 2.30
p-m. There were a few Indian houses unoccupied and I took posses-
sion of one, glad to get under shelter from the rain which was falling
fast.

This village, which we found vacant on our arrival, is occupied during
the season by sea-otter hunters.

I had procured a chart of Queen Charlotte Islands published by the
English admiralty from amap by G. M. Dawson, of the Geological Sur-
vey office, Montreal, who made areconnaissance of the east coast of the
group in the summer of 1878. The west coast has never been surveyed,
but the chart of that portion was made up from an old Russian map of
1849, which is very incorrect. I kept this chart before me as I cruised
along the coast in the canoe, and old Edinso, who is an excellent pilot,
pointed out to me the errors in the chart as we passed along, and gave
me the nomenclature of all the capes, points, bays, inlets, harbors, and
islands. Frederick or Susk Island and Hippa or Nesto Island had
been pretty accurately laid down, but the intervening spaces from Cape
Knox to Skidegate Channel were not correctly laid down, and I marked
the corrections as we came to each place. At Hippah Island in par-
ticular is a fine inlet not laid down, which makes a complete harbor of
refuge for vessels bound up or down the coast. It is hidden from the
view of passing vessels by Nesto or Hippah Island, and will be found
when properly surveyed to be of much importance to commerce. All
my new work I have marked in red ink on the copy of the chart which
I sent to Washington from Victoria, August 6.

I was detained at Camp Tledoo from August 17 to August 21 by head
winds and heavy breakers, which prevented our passing through the
only opening in the reef to the ocean, and I occupied the time in making
such collections as I could and making notes of the country for several
miles each side of our camp.

On Tuesday, August 21, I started at 5.20 a m. and proceeded as far
as Hippah Island, where we camped for the night with much discomfort.
The following morning I made a reconnaissance of Skaloo Inlet and
noted it on my map, and proceeded leisurely along, noting every point
and change in the coast, till we came to Runnell Sound, when it com-
menced to blow from the south, with fog and rain, and we were forced
. to take refuge in a cove called Tchuwn, where I had to remain, wind and
storm bound, till Saturday, the 25th, when I started at 7 a. m., and
having camped that night in Skidegate Channel, I reached the Skide-
gate Oil Works at 8 o’clock Sunday morning, August 26. I at once
made arrangements with the Skidegate Oil Company to assist me in
procuring some black cod (Anoplopoma jfimbria), which was done by
sending Indians to the west coast, where they abound, and in a few
REPORT ON THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS. 145

days I had over one hundred fine fish, which I had split like cod and
salted.

I remained at Skidegate making collections of the Indians till Tues-
day, September 4, when I started on a visit to the villages of Skedans,
Cumshewa, and Laskeek, in the southern portion of the group, and suc-
ceeded in obtaining some rare specimens of Indian work used in their
masquerade performances and highly prized by them.

At the village of Laskeek, on Tanoo Island, is the most interesting
collection of columns, both heraldic and mortuary, and more monuments
for the dead than I had seen in any other village. The Indian house in
which I stopped is 4 new one, of large dimensions, built after the ancient
style. In this house will be held the most extensive ceremonies that
have taken place for many years, consisting of the tomanawas or secret
performances, then the public tatooing of persons of all ages and sexes,
then the masquerade dances and the distribution of presents, when sev-
eral thousand dollars’ worth of blankets, calico, clothing, and provisions
will be given away, and the whole interspersed with feasts at different
houses in the village. The occasion of this is the erection of one or
more huge columns, elaborately carved with totemic devices, to show the
wealth and importance of the chief in front of whose house the column
will be erected. This great ceremony will take place in the fall of this
year and will be well worth seeing, as it is probable that it will be the
last grand display of the kind that will take place, the influence of mis-
sionaries being directed to suppressing these ancient ceremonies, in
which they have succeeded, so far as regards the villages at Masset
and Skidegate, where the ceremonies of the tomanawas, if performed at
present, are greatly shorn of their honors, and I was thereby enabled
to obtain many articles of ceremonial usage, which formerly no white
man was suffered to look at, much less to purchase and take away.

The grand tomanawas of next fall will last from two to three weeks.
I left Laskeek village on my return to Skidegate on Saturday afternoon,
September 8th, and ran back with a fair wind to Koona village, the resi-
dence of Captain Skidance, the chief of the Klue district, where I re-
mained till the 10th, when I arrived at Skidegate village at 8 p. m., and
the following morning returned to the oil works, when I at once packed
my Skidegate collection into cases, took passage on the company’s little
steamer Skidegate, for Victoria, leaving Skidegate on Friday, September
21st, and reaching Victoria on the afternoon of the 27th.

The result of my work may be briefly summed up as follows: I have
a most interesting and valuable collection of articles of Indian manu-
facture. I have succeeded in introducing the black cod, a new and valu-
able food-fish. I have determined the locality of several new inlets
and harbors on the west coast of Graham Island. I have succeeded in
deciphering the true meaning of the hieroglyphics of the carved col-
umns, which are in great profusion in every village, and the meaning of
the tattoo marks on the persons of the natives, I have collected evi-

dence of the former intercourse between the Haidahs and the Aztec
races of Mexico, and have accumulated an amount of information re-
specting the interesting tribe inhabiting the Queen Charlotte group of
islands never yet made public, but which I shall elaborate in form for
publication.

It may perhaps be proper for me to mention at this time, without be-
ing charged with egotism, that my work in the Queen Charlotte Islands
has been considered of such value to the Province of British Columbia-
that I have received an official invitation to deliver a lecture before the
government and legislature of that province and to other government
officials in Victoria on the subject of the Queen Charlotte Islands, which
lecture I propose to deliver this present month, having obtained permis-
sion so to do from Professor Baird.

Although I have accomplished much, yet there remains much of in-
terest to science to be further investigated, not only on the Queen Char-
lotte Islands, but among the Haidahs of the Princeof Wales Archipel-
ago, in Alaska; and anything intended to be done among those Indians
to still further develop objects of interest should be done at once, before
the tourists gather in all articles of Indian manufacture, and before the
Indians themselves shall have passed away.

{Extract from the Proceedings, Vol. XXXII, Philadelphia meeting, September, 1884.]

The Committee on Indexing Chemical Literature, appointed in 1882,
respectfully presents the following report of progress.

We have the pleasure to announce that since our last report the fol-
lowing indexes have been published by their authors, the arrangement
of material being uniform with that of those previously issued:

Ozone, second index, by Prof. Albert R. Leeds.

Peroxide of Hydrogen, second index, by Prof. A. R. Leeds.

Speed of Chemical Reactions, by Prof. R. B. Warder.

Starch Sugar, by Dr. E. J. Hallock.

Besides these a valuable contribution to chemical bibliography has
been independently published on a somewhat different plan, by Prof.
Albert B. Prescott and Mr. J. W. Baird. The full titles of the above
will be found at the close of this report.

Two hundred and fifty copies of our report for 1883 have been sent to
chemists throughout the United States, the Smithsonian Institution
having kindly attended to the distribution by mail without expense to
the committee. This led to correspondence with several chemists who
regarded the scheme of co-operative indexing favorably, and resulted
in several offers of assistance.

Prof. William Ripley Nichols offers an Index to the Literature of Car-
bon Monoxide.

Prof. L. P. Kinnicutt offers an Index to the Literature of Meteorites.

Dr. Henry Leffmann reports progress on his Index to the Literature of
Arsenic.

Prof. C. E. Monroe does likewise with reference to an Index to the
Literature of Explosives.

Prof. A. B. Prescott and Mr. J. T. Craig offer an Index to the Liter-
ature of Phosphorus.

Dr. H. Carrington Bolton has in preparation a second Index to the
Literature of Uranium.

An offer was also received of an index to an elsment Already on the
list of those published, but was withdrawn as soon as the author had his
attention called to the existing publication. This cireumstance shows
forcibly the advantage of co-operation through this committee.

We are pleased to announce that in consequence of our representations
the Smithsonian Institution has consented to publish indexes to chemical]

literature which shall be indorsed by this committee. The Smithsonian
places a limit to the number of pages which will be printed per annum,
but the limit is a generous one.

By thus seeuring the assistance of the Smithsonian Institution, chem-
ists are assured of a reliable and authoritative channel of publication,
together with a wide circulation, and the plan of co-operative indexing
will undoubtedly receive a great stimulus.

Finally, to extend more widely acquaintance with the existing indexes,
we append a complete list of those printed. A limited number of those
published by the New York Academy of Sciences can be had by ad-
dressing the chairman of the publication committee of the academy,
Prof. D. S. Martin, 236 West Fourth street, New York City.

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONTAN REPORT FOR 1884.
ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX is to furnish summaries of
scientific discovery in particular directions; occasional reports of the
investigations made by collaborators of the Institution; memoirs of a
general character or on special topics, whether original and prepared
expressly for the purpose, or selected from foreign journals and proceed-
ings; and briefly to present (as fully as space will permit) such papers
not published in the “* Smithsonian Contributions” or in the ‘ Miscella-
neous Collections” as may be supposed to be of interest or value to the
numerous correspondents of the Institution.

156
RECORD OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS FOR 1884.

INTRODUCTION.

While it has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution, from a very early date in its history, to enrich
the annual report, required of them by law, with scientific memoirs illus-
trating the more remarkable and important developments in phyical
and biological discovery, as well as showing the general character of
the operations of the Institution, this purpose was not carried out on
any very systematic plan until the year 1880. Believing however that
an annual report or summary of the recent advances made in the lead-
ing departments of scientific inquiry would supply a want very gener-
ally felt, and would be favorably received by all those interested in the
diffusion of knowledge, the Secretary had prepared for the report of
1880, by competent collaborators, a series of abstracts showing con
cisely the prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy,
geology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zodlogy, and anthro-
pology.

The same general programme has been followed in the subsequent
reports, with the inclusion of geography and meteorology in the list of
subjects. The contributors to this record for the present year, and their
several departments or topics, remain the same as in the last report, ex-
cepting that the summary of the progress of geology and of that of bot-
any for the year have been unavoidably omitted.. A réswmé of the sub-
jects vuleanology and seismology for the years 1883 and 1884 has been
prepared for this report by Prof. Charles B. Rockwood, of Princeton
College; and a review of the bibliography of North American inverte-
brate paleontology for the year has been prepared by Mr. John Bel-
knap Marcou.

With every effort to secure prompt attention to all the more impor-
tant details of such a work, various unexpected delays frequently render
it impracticable to obtain all the desired reports in each department
within the time prescribed. In such cases it is designed, if possible, to
bring up deficiencies and supply them in subsequent reports.

The value of this annual record of progress would be much enhanced
by an enlargement of its scope, and the inelusion, not only of such
branches as mathematics, physiology, pathology and medicine, micros-

157

copy, &c., but also of the more practical topics of agricultural and hor-
ticultural economy, engineering, mechanics, and technology in general ;
but the space required for such larger digest seems scarcely available
in the present channel.

It is hardly necessary to remark that in a summary of the annual pro-
gress of scientific discovery so condensed as the present, the wants of
the specialist in any branch can be but imperfectly supplied; and very
many items and details of great value to him must be entirely omitted.
While the student in a special field of knowledge may occasionally re-
ceive hints that will be found of interest, he will naturally be led to
consult for fuller information the original journals and special periodi-
cals from which these brief notices or abstracts have been compiled.

The plan of devoting some 350 pages of the annual report to such a
compilation is not designed to preclude the introduction into the ‘‘Gen-
eral Appendix,” as heretofore, of special monographs or discussions
that may prove interesting to the scientific student.

ASTRONOMY.

By Professor EDWARD S. HOLDEN,
Director of the Washburn Observatory.

The following record of the progress of Astronomy during the year
1884 is in continuation of the records for past years, and it is given in
essentially the same form. Abstracts of some of the most important
papers of the year are arranged under their appropriate beads. Other
papers, equally important, have been omitted, since they do not lend
themselves to condensation.

To the professional astronomer these abstracts may serve as a con-
venient collection of notes. They are, however, primarily intended for
the large and increasing class of those who are interested in astronomy,
but whose acquaintance with the subject is more general than special.
The writer has made free use of reviews, etc., which have appeared in
the various scientific journals, more especially in Nature, The Observa-
tory, Bulletin Astronomique, Sirius, The Sidereal Messenger, The Athe-
newm.

CONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS; NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS, ETC.

On the distribution of the stars in the northern hemisphere, by Prof. H.
SEELIGER.

[ABSTRACT. ]

As is well known, the Durchmusterung of Argelander contains the po-
sitions and magnitudes of all stars visible in a 3-inch comet-seeker, with
a power of 10, from the north pole to — 2° declination. Professor Schoen-
feld has completed a similar Durchmusterung from —2° to —23° which
is not yet published. The stars of these lists are between the 1.0 and 9.5
magnitudes (the last approximate only). In 1869 von Littrow had the
stars of the northern D. M. counted by magnitudes and by declination.
That is, he had the zones of 1° wide in declination counted, so as to ex-
hibit the number of stars of each tenth of amagnitude. Unfortunately
he did not separate the stars so as to exhibit the numbers in right as-
cension also, as he might easily have done. Professor Seeliger, of
Munich, has just completed a count of this kind. He was led to do this,
he says, because there was no such count in existence, and one was

needed, It is clear that a kind of astronomical “ clearing-house,” where
149

accounts can be adjusted, is also needed! <A count of this kind exists
in MS. at the Bonn Observatory (see Bonn Obs., vol. Vv), but is not ac-
cessible. The Washburn Observatory prints in its vol. 11, the begin-
ning of a count of this kind (from —2° to + 13°), which was stopped
on hearing of Professor Seeliger’s. Professor Seeliger appears also to
be unaware that Littrow’s count has been repeated by Mr. Peirce (An-
nals H. 0. O., vol. 1X)! With this digression, which is not uninstructive,
we return to Professor Seeliger’s important paper. He hasthen counted
the stars of the D. M. accurately, and by R. A. as well as Decl. and Mag.
Instead of keeping magnitudes down to the tenths, he has wisely se-
lected the following classes :

1. Containing stars from 1.0 to 6.5 mags., inclusive.
. Containing stars from 6.6 to 7.0 mags., inclusive.
. Containing stars from 7.1 to 7.5 mags., inclusive.
Containing stars from 7.6 to 8.0 mags., inclusive.
. Containing stars from 8.1 to 8.5 mags., inclusive.
. Containing stars from 8.6 to 9.0 mags., inclusive.
. Containing stars from 9.1 to 9.5 mags., inclusive.

The number of stars for each 20™ of R. A. and each 1° of Dec. was
counted. These numbers have been united into sums giving new num-
bers of stars in areas of 20™ in R. A. by 5° in Dec. The latter tables
are to be printed by the Munich Observatory.

Professor Seeliger’s paper contains the number of stars for each area
of 40™ in R. A. by 5° in Dee., the stars of each class 1-7 being enu-
merated separately. There are, in the northern sky, 4,120 objects of
class 1; 3,887 class 2; 6,054 class 3; 11,168 class 4; 22,898 class 5;
52,852 class 6; 213,973 class 7; 314,952 in all, besides 126 nebule, va-
riables, etc. That is 315,078 in all, by Professor Seeliger’s count. Ar-
gelander gives 315,089. To deal with this mass of figures, Professor
Seeliger divides the sky into 8 zones. Zone 1 has its center at the north
pole of the Milky Way, and extends to Galactic Polar Distance 20° ;
zone 2 extends from G. P. D. 20° to 40°; zone 3, from 40° to 60°; zone
4, from 60° to 80°; zone 5 (containing the Milky Way itself) from 80° to
100°, and so on to G. P. D. 140°.

The number of stars (of each class) per zone is next determined; and
next the number of stars (of each class) in each 1° square. We may
quote the figures for class 1 and classes 2-7 taken together :

ASTRONOMY. 161

This table shows the influence of the Milky Way most markedly; but
if changed so that the number of stars in zone 5 is always 1.00, it be-
comes even more interesting.

Class 1. Classes 2-7.
Zone 1......0.55 0.55

Ose 1.00 1.00
Gs saree 0.91 0.77
it see 0.57 0.47
to ER eee fe 0.43 0.41

If we call these last numbers D, and if we form !=®, these numbers
may be called the gradients (G), expressing the rapidity of increase of
number of stars as we approach the Milky Way. The values of G are—

Class ils: yee: 0.36 Class) Dice 542 0.44
Dh et sh 0.48 Cc Wensere 0.45
Sages 0.42 Wetec 0.45
Aaa rae 0.47 Si adies 0.52

Classes 2-7, 0.50.

It thus appears probable that G is greater for the fainter stars, but
not so much greater as has been commonly supposed. For stars of
the mags. 1, 2,3, and of the mags. 4,5, 6, G results 0.14 and 0.19. These
numbers show an important difference between the bright and the faint
stars. If we were allowed to assume that stars even fainter than 9.5
would continue to show the constant gradient that these show it would
follow that our stellar system was not to be considered as a flat disk.
but rather more or less spherical, with the stars concentrated near its
medial plane (the Milky Way).

The author next proceeds to compute the center of gravity of each
class of stars, and its position is—

The last column gives the ratio “ for each class; where R is the dis-
tance of the center of gravity of al/ stars of the class, r that of any star
of that class.

The full interpretation of these numbers ean pay be made when

Schoenfeld’s D. M. is published. Certain further conclusions may also
be drawn from the author’s figures. This paper is the most impor-
tant which has appeared on this very interesting question since the pub-
lication of Dr. Gould’s Uranometria Argentina.

ASTRONOMICAL CONSTANTS.

New investigations on the constants of precession.—In one of the last
meetings of the ‘“‘ Niederrheinische Gesellschaft fiir Natur und Heil-
kunde,” Dr. Schoenfeld presented a lately published article by Dr. F.
Bolte, entitled “ Investigations on the Constants of Precession, based
upon the Star catalogues of Lalande and Schjellerup.” The writer
here makes the first attempt to take into consideration the systematic
proper motion of the fixed stars in the determination of these important
constants ; while up to this time those parallactic changes of star posi-
tions, at most, have been considered which are due to the motion of the
solar system. Such systematic proper motions may be of different
kinds, but the most obvious assumption is that they occur in planes
which are but slightly inclined to the plane of the Milky Way. This is
the idea that the writer has adopted, and he has applied it to the 3,300
stars common to the above mentioned catalogues, supplementing a
treatise of Dreyer’s, in which the latter discusses the R. A.’s of these
stars, by considering their declinations at the same time. The result
for the precession is a very good substantiation of Struve’s constant,
now so commonly used in our almanacs; as to the assumed common
motion of the stars however, the result is an entirely negative one, for
its value, determined as 0/.4 per century, is much less than its probable
error.

The speaker touched upon various possible explanations of this in-
teresting result, particularly this: That the attraction of the Milky
Way upon the individual stars may be counteracted by the attraction
of the nebulee which are mostly thickly clustered about the poles of the
Milky Way.—From Sirius, February, 1884.

Bonn: Zone 50°-40°. The observations are not yet finished, although
near to completion. The mean difference of R. A. of a star from two
observations is about 08.08 and 1/.1. Investigations of the effect of the
magnitude of a star on its deduced R. A. show a difference (faint minus
bright) less than+ 0.8008 in the mean.

Iund: Zone 40°-35°. The work is nearly complete

Leyden : Zone 359-3092. The observations are finished.

Cambridge (England): Zone 309-259. Thirty-eight thousand five hun-
dred and fifty-nine observations have been made from 1872 to 1883.
Three hundred and eighty-four stars have not yet been observed once;
614 have been observed only once; the rest of the total number, 10,691,
twice or oftener.

Berlin: Zone 259-209. Dr. Becker’s observations are completed.
Observations on 13 nights of 247 stars show that fainter stars are ob-

Determining stars for the southern zones of the Astronomische Gesel-
schaft.—These 303 stars are being observed at various observatories,
as follows:

Cape of Good Hope.—The observations are finished and each star has
been observed at least twelve times. The results of observation are all
reduced, and for the final publication there are needed investigations
of the flexure, the latitude, the refraction, the personal equations of
the observers depending (a) on the staz’s magnitude, (b) on its declina-
tion. The division errors for each 1° have been investigated. The cir-
cle is not reversible. The flexure is to be investigated by means of col-
limators made specially for the purpose by Troughton & Simms. Each
collimator is furnished with a reversing apparatus and a level, and the
horizontal point can thus be determined, either north and south. Com-
bining these horizontal points with nadir-points will determine whether
the flexure is the same looking north and south. The latitude is to be
determined from observations of circumpolar stars, at both culminations
(already observed in 1880 ’81 ’82 ’83). The declinations of these stars
are to be determined by observing their azimuths at greatest elonga-
tions E. and W., with the 3-foot theodolite of the India survey. South
stars culminating at zenith-distances, equal to those of the cireumpolar
stars, are to be observed by Talcott’s method. These observations are
to be combined by Kapteyn’s method.

For the refraction, the Cape has observed a number of north stars
(near the zenith of Leyden) and zenith stars (near the horizon of Ley-
164 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

den) which have also been observed at Leyden. <A discussion of these
declinations is now in progress.

For eliminating personal equation depending on the direction of the
star’s motion, each star has been observed over half the wires in the
usual way, and over the other half through a reversing prism.

All the observers make the clock slower when the stars move across
the field from left to right.

Leyden Observatory.—Since 1881, 427 observations have been made,
and 1,124 in all; 165 of the 303 stars have been observed once or oftener.

Melbourne Observatory.—The observations will be begun in 1883.

Sydney Observatory.—Sydney also proposes to observe these stars.

Naples Observatory.—The observations will be begun in January, 1884.

Washburn Observatory.—The observations were begun in May, 1884,
and up to January 1, 1885, 1,800 observations have been made and are
completely reduced. The probable error of a single decl. is 0/.41. The
constant of refraction of the Pulkowa Refraction.tables requires a cor-
rection of + 0/’.30.

A uniform ephemeris of the clock-stars.*—A noteworthy feature in the
progress of our astronomical annuals is the rapid increase that has taken
place within a few years in the number of the clock-stars. This increase
seems to have been brought about chiefly by the influence of the Berlin
list of 539 stars, which was published for the use of astronomers who
were engaged in observing the zones of the northern heavens. The
convenience of this list for the use of observing parties in the field seems
to have led to the large increase that we find in the annual publications.
For the year 1886 the Nautical Almanac gives the mean positions of 198
stars, the Connaissance des Temps of 316, the Berliner Jahrbuch of 622,
and the American EHphemeris of 383 stars.

That this great increase in the number of clock-stars has some ad-
vantages will not be denied, but, on the other hand, there seem to be
some disadvantages that ought to be considered. In the first place the
mean positions of the stars given in the different publications do not
agree as well as might be expected when the great number of observa-
tions of these stars is taken into account and the number of years over
which the observations are extended. These differences of position
are indeed small, and their influence on the observed positions of other
stars and planets cannot be great; but we have already examples in
astronomy of the extension of such small errors into large catalogues of
stars and of their development into periodic errors.

The constants for the reduction of the clock-stars from one epoch to

another, and to apparent position, are now so well known, and the:

adopted values are so nearly the same, that the differences produced by
the various reductions are frequently neglected ; but even here it seems
there is room for improvement. At the present time the values of the

* Astr. Nachr., No. 2602.

ASTRONOMY. 165

constants of reduction are known to a good degree of approximation,
and it ought not to be difficult for astronomers to unite on a common
system of values of these constants and alsoon a uniform notation to be
used in reductions. The great advancement in stellar astronomy made
by Bessel in his “‘Tabule Regiomontane” seems to have been partly
disregarded and lost, and his methods for bringing the labors of many
observers into harmony, and of making them all tend towards the ad-
vancement of the science, have sometimes been overlooked and for-
gotten.

Again, if a large list of clock-stars is at hand, the astronomer is apt
to make his work purely differential. In many cases this may be his
best course, but such work would be more easily reduced and compared
if it could all be referred to a common system of clock-stars. The com-
putation of systematic errors would not be avoided, but the work would
be made easier and more certain. °

In order to obtain an extensive and convenient ephemeris of the clock-
stars, suitable for general use, it would be better to make sucha work a
special publication. In this way the adoption of the mean positions of the
stars and the selection of the constants of reduction and the system of
notation could be brought under the direction of one office. The work
should be so elaborate that the apparent position of a star could be in-
terpolated with ease and certainty for any time, but even with such an
extension the cost of publication would not be great. I hope that the
Astronomische Gesellschaft may be willing to undertake a work of this
kind. (A. Hall, Washington, 1884, May 30.)

Positions of polar stars.—Vols. I and 0 of the Annals of the Observ-
atory of Kiew are largely devoted to the observations made of a con-
siderable number of cireumpolar stars with the object of forming a
standard set of places. These two interesting volumes cannot be epito-
mized here, but reference may be made to a very complete review of
them in the Bulletin Astronomique, Vol. I, p. 159, by M. Callandreau.

Schoenfeld’s Durchmusterung, from —2° to—23°.—At the Vienna meet-
ing of the German Astronomical Society, Dr. Schoenfeld gave an ac-
count of the progress of his work since the Strassburg meeting.

699.3 hours of R. A. with 363,351 star-positions have been observed.
The principal catalogue now contains 113,706 stars between —2° and
—23° and 1,161 stars near these limits. In “1,7. ¢., from 9" 0™ to 6%
0™, the work is completed. (This work is now done; 1885.)

lt is expected to begin the printing of the principal catalogue in May
or June, 1884. Probably some 40,000 stars brighter than 9.1 mag. exist
in the region.

Greenwich catalogue of stars —The volume of Greenwich Observations
for 1882 has been published. It was mentioned in the Astronomer
Royal’s report to: the board of visitors that this had been passed for
press early in May. It is the first volume relating to a year of which
the work was wholly under the direction of Mr, Christie, as Sir George
166 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

Airy resigned on the 15th of August, 1881. In his report, alluded to
above, Mr. Christie stated that the next great catalogue of stars formed
from the Greenwich observations would not be commenced until after
theend of next year, as it wa; intended to make it embrace, like the
preceding, the stellar work of nine years, ending with that of 1885, as
the last included the observations of 1876.

New catalogues of stars.—The Armagh Observatory is preparing for
the press a second Armagh catalogue of about 3,000 stars, most of which
have been observed from three to five times with the mural circle.

The Washburn Observatory will print in its vol. III, now in press, a
catalogue of 1,001 southern stars, observed by Professor Tacchini in
1867, ’68, 69, and reduced by Rev. Father dagen, S. J., and Professor
Holden.

Catalogue of 6,000 stars.—Professor Schering writes that the Gé6ttin-
gen catalogue of 6,000 stars is in process of preparation for printing.
For account of it see Géttinger Nachrichten, 1864, July 13.

PARALLAX OF STARS.

Parallax-hunting at Dunsink.*—For some years past Professor Ball
has employed the south refractor of the Dunsink Observatory in mak-
ing a systematic Search for stars with a large annual parallax. The
third part of the Observations contains the results of measures of 42
objects selected for this purpose, and the volume now before us contains
the observations of 568 additional objects.

In making out a working list of stars suitable for examination, Pro-
fessor Ball has been guided by various considerations. Of course stars
with large proper motion would be naturally included, though the pre-
sumption of nearness founded on great proper motion can hardly be
said to be justified by the results of observation. Many red stars and
variable stars have been put on the working list. It has been sug-
gested by Mr. Stoney that some of the former may owe their color to
being very small, and therefore very close to us. There is also reason
to believe that some of the variable stars are really very small, and that
therefore, as we see them, they must be comparatively near us.

Several other stars have also been included, which were chosen on
different grounds.

In the reconnoitering observations carried out by Professor Ball every
object is observed twice. The first observation is made when the star
is at one of the extremities of the major axis of the parallax-ellipse, the
second observation is made after an interval of six months, when the
star has moved to that part of the parallax-ellipse which is at the other
extremity of the major axis. The observation consists in the measure-
ment of the distance and position angle of the object under examination

* Astronomical Observations and Researches madeat Dunsink. Fifth part, Dublin,
1884.

ASTRONOMY. 167

with regard to a suitable comparison star, which for the telescope and
micrometer used should not be more than 300” distant from the star
whose parallax is to be examined, and not fainter than the 10th
magnitude.

By comparing the two observations referred to above it can be de-
termined whether the object under examination has a parallax of any
considerable amount or not. Of course it would have been preferable
to make the observations at times when the effect of parallax on the
relative positions of the star under examination and the comparison
star would be greatest; but the determination of these times would
have entailed some additional labor, and Professor Ball has been satis-
fied with the simpler process described.

Whenever the observations have suggested the existence of a meas-
urable parallax, the objects have been observed again, and when neces-
sary a complete series of observations has been made.

As might be expected, the results of the present work are mainly of
a negative character; still the observations will be useful to future par-
allax seekers, and are also valuable as a small instrument of that com-
plete survey of the heavens which is still a desideratum. The observa-
tions are, however, sufficient to enable us, in Professor Ball’s opinion, to
assert that the parallax of these stars is certainly less than a second of
are, and most probably less than half a second of are. It is, of course,
possible that no star in the heavens has a parallax larger than a second.
Professor Ball somewhat naively remarks he often thinks that there
certainly is not. It must, however, be remembered that comparatively
very few stars have been examined with this object in view, and the
induction is founded on really a very small number of instances.
Professor Ball’s parallax-hunting is therefore a class of work which
ought to be done, and it is most satisfactory to find that it is being done
so skillfully and well.

In the present volume there are also included some positive fruits of
Professor Ball’s work, viz, determinations of the parallax of 61 (B)
Cygni (from differences of declination), of Groombridge 1618, and of 6
(B) Cygni.*

The following are the results:

in scientific periodicals, they need not be further alluded to here. We
may, however, point out that the series of measures of 61 (B) Cygni
alluded to on page 159 as having been made at Moscow between 1863,
May 16, and 1866, October 13, and published in Annales de V Observatoire
de Moscow, vol. V1, 1 livraison, page 79 et seq., have been reduced by
M. Socoloff (loc. cit., vol. VIII, 2 livraison), who finds—
From measures of distance,
parallax of 61 Cygni = + 0/.4598+ 0.0550.
From measures of position,
parallax of 61 Cygni = + 0/.4222+4+-0/.0342.
From combination of measures,
parallax of 61 Cygni = +4 0/.4330+ 0.0291.

The observations were made by Schweizer, Struve’s comparison star
(9.4 mag.) being used.—A. M. W. D., “The Observatory,” November,
1884, p. 335.

“'Time does not permit me to go into more detail as to each of these
separate results, full of interest though they are, and each of them rep-
resenting months of labor.

“My object now is to generalize, to point out the conclusions that must
be drawn from this table and to see what are the broad lessons that
it teaches us.

“A glance is sufficient to show that neither apparent magnitude nor
apparent proper motion can afford a definitive criterion of the distance
of any fixed star—that different stars really differ greatly in absolute
brightness and in absolute motion.

“The great cosmical problem that we have to solve is not so much what
is the parallax of this or that particular star, but we have to solve the
much broader questions—

‘1, What are the average parallaxes of stars of the first, second, third,
and fourth magnitudes, compared with those of fainter magnitude?

2, What connection does there subsist between the parallax of a star
and the amount and direction of its proper motion, or can it be proved
that there is no such relation or connection ?

‘With any approximate answer to these questions we should probably
be able to determine the law of absorption of starlight in space, and be
provided with the data at present wanting for determining with more
precision the constant of precession and the amount and direction of the
solar motion in space. And who ean predict what hitherto unknown
cosmical laws might reveal themselves in the course of such an investi-
gation?

“Tt is important to consider whether such a scheme of research is one
that can be realized in the immediate future, or one that can only be
carried to completion by the accumulated labors of successive astron-
omers.

“JT have very carefully considered this question from a practical point
of view, and I have prepared a scheme, founded on the results of my
past experience. I have submitted that scheme for the opinion of the
most competent judges, and in their opinion, as well as my own, the
work can be done, with honest hard work, for one hemisphere, within
ten years. I have offered to do that work for the southern hemisphere
with my own hands, and a proposal for the necessary instruments and
appliances is now under the consideration of my lords commissioners of
the admiralty. I need hardly add that in this matter I look confidently
for that complete consideration and that efficient support which I have
never failed to receive at their hands since I have had the honor to
serve them.

“The like work will be undertaken for the northern hemisphere by my
friend, Dr. Elkin, who is now in charge of the heliometer at Yale Col-
lege, in America. It is at present the finest instrument of the kind in
the world.

*“T most earnestly trust tbat we may be granted health and strength

for this work, and that no unforeseen circumstances will prevent its comi-
plete accomplishment.” (Nature.)

DOUBLE STARS.

“Mr. Burnham’s double-star measures.—The recently published vol-
ume of the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society contains a further
series of measures of double stars by Mr. 8S. W. Burnham, made with
the 18-inch refractor of the observatory at Chicago. This series com-
prises measures of 151 double stars discovered by this eminent ob-
server, which brings up the number of such objects discovered by him
during the last ten years to no fewer than 1,013, amongst which are in-
cluded some of the most interesting stars of this class; also measures of
a selected list of double stars, 770 in number, made chiefly in the years
1879 and 1880, with an appendix, the results of observations of several
objects as late as the middle of the past year. Every one who is in-
terested in this branch of astronomical science will read with much re-
gret one remark in Mr. Burnham’s introduction. He writes: ‘The
present catalogue will conclude my astronomical work, at least so far
as any regular or systematic observations are concerned.’ He expresses
himself modestly respecting his own labors: ‘In a field so infinitely
large, one can accomplish but little at the most, and how much, or how
little, the astronomers of a few centuries hence can perhaps best decide.

—- — -— At this time I may venture to claim that my work in this
field has been prosecuted with some enthusiasm, and for its own sake
only, and that my interest has not been divided among several spe-
cialities.’

“But a higher estimate of Mr. Burnham’s work in this particular line
of observational astronomy to which he has devoted himself may be
justly taken. To read of the discovery of upwards of a thousand
double stars within a limited period by one observer, we might almost
suppose we were living in the days of Sir William Herschel, when the
heavens were comparatively an open field, and had not undergone the
wide and close exploration which they had done when Mr. Burnham
commenced his work. He has had, it is true, the advantage of instru-
ments of the finest class, and, we may believe, an unusually acute
vision; but he must have exercised an extraordinary and most mer-
itorious amount of patience, perseverance, and care in the discovery
and accurate measurement of such a list of double stars, and it will be
gratifying to the astronomical world that such well-directed exertions
have met with so exceptional a success.

‘¢‘ Among the more noteworthy stars included in Mr. Burnham’s new
catalogue (the fourteenth), which may be considered a continuation of
that published in vol. xLiv of the same Memoirs, the following may be
mentioned : (

“1, 126 Tauri (f 1007), ‘a most remarkably close and difficult pair, one
ASTRONOMY. Th

of the closest known ;’ magnitudes 6.0 and 6.2. With a power of 1,400
there was only a slight elongation.

“2. B.A. C. 346; Mr. Burnham thinks the principal star may be va-
riable, and he is certainly correct in his surmise. Heis gives it as a
naked-eye star 6.77, Gould 7."0, and it has been several times noted
8"; while the writer has recorded it as low as 9”.

“3. 6117; astar with a proper motion, according to Argelander, of
0.438; measures in 1883 show a common motion of the components ;
their distance is 2/7.2.

“4, € Sagittarii; detected by Winlock, probably a retrograde motion
of 225° in less than fourteen years; and evidently a change of 48° in
less than three years, by Mr. Burnham’s measures alone. It is an ob-
ject for large instruments in the other hemisphere.

“5. @ Delphini (¢ 151).—A very rapid binary; since its detection by
Mr. Burnham, in 1873, there has been an increase in the angle of about
180°, and a diminution in distance from 0/’.6 to 0.25. He thinks ‘it
may prove to have, with the single exception of 6 Equulei, the shortest
period known.’

“Mr. Burnham collects the measures of 6 Equulei, and infers a
period of revolution of about 10.8 years. Measures should be easy
again in 1835.

**6, 85 Pegasi (7 733) —The close pair was not measurable in 1882; the
angle was about 333° at the epoch 1883.75. The mean annual motion
is about 12°.5, at which rate the period would be less than thirty years.

‘In the introduction to the catalogue will be found references to the
publications where the thirteen previous ones are to be found.” (Nature.)

MOTIONS OF STARS IN THE LINE OF SIGHT.

From the Astronomer Royal’s report we learn that—

‘For the determination of motions of stars in the line of sight, 412
measures have been made of the displacement of the F line in the spec-
tra of 48 stars, 91 measures of the } lines in 19 stars, and two measures
of the D lines in one star, besides measures of the displacements of the
b and F lines in the spectra of the east and west limbs of Jupiter, and
in the spectra of Venus and Mars, and comparisons with lines in the
moon or sky spectrum made in the course of every night’s observations
of star-motions, or on the following morning, as a check on the adjust-
ment of the spectroscope. Some preliminary measures have also been
made of the F line in the spectrum of the Orion Nebula. The progress.
ive change in the motion of Sirius, from recession to approach, alluded
to in the last two reports, is fully confirmed by numerous observations
Since last autumn, and a change of the same character is indicated in
the case of Procyon. A discussion of the measures of all the stars ob-
served here, on which I am now engaged, shows that the results of the
four periods—1875, June, to 1877, May ; 1877, June, to 1880, December ;
1881, January, to 1882, March 10; 1882, March 11, to 1884, March 31; in
172 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

each of which the instrumental conditions were different—accord gen-
erally within the limits of the probable errors, and that there is no sys-
tematic change from recession to approach, so that the presumption
against error arising from defective instrumental adjustment appears
to be strong.” (Nature.)

PHOTOMETRY OF STARS.

The new volume of Annals of the Observatory of Harvard College is
in many respects the most interesting and important of any of them,
for it embodies the results of three years’ work with an entirely new and
unique instrument in a field hitherto but little explored, which Profes-
sor Pickering, the director, has made almost entirely his own by the in-
vention of novel and efficient apparatus, and by the energetic accumu-
lation, discussion, and prompt publication of results.

The observations described in this volume consist of 94,476 separate
measurements of the brightness of 4,260 stars, all those visible to the
naked eye from the North Pole to 30° of south declination, and many
somewhat fainter. They were made by Professor Pickering, the di-
rector. aided by Messrs. Searle and Wendell, assistants in the Harvard
College Observatory, using the new meridian photometer, devised by
the director.

With this photometer each of the 4,260 stars was compared, when
near the meridian, with the pole star on at least three nights, and
many of them on six or more. In these comparisons both stars are
seen under the same magnifying power and on the same background, so
that the differential effect of moonlight or twilight is eliminated, and
any error due to local cloudiness or haziness over one star is sufficiently
guarded against by the number of different nights and the repetition of
the observations where this is suspected. Two persons work at the
same time, the observer managing the pole star image in the field and
making the settings of the eye-piece Nicol for the four positions of
equal brightness, and the other bringing the other star into the field
by the other prism and reading off and recording the observer’s set-
tings of the eye-piece. At the beginning, middle, and end of each con-
tinuous series of observations the prism of the south objective was also
turned to the pole star, and the two images of this were compared, in
order to furnish the corrections necessary on account of unequal trans-
parency and reflecting power of the two objectives and prisms.

In the preliminary chapters of the work are given the details of the
various methods employed to discover and eliminate all sources of sys-
tematic error, and their completeness and thoroughness assure the pro-
fessional astronomer of the high degree of confidence which can be
placed in the results. Only a few of the most interesting points can be
noted here, and those very briefly. The discussion of a long series of
observations upon a list of 100 circumpolar stars, at upper and lower
culminations, gives for the co-efficient of atmospheric absorption ;

ASTRONOMY. L173

0.25 x secant of the zenith distance, @. e., a star seen from the outside
of our atmosphere would appear a quarter of a magnitude brighter
than it does now in the zenith, and half a magnitude brighter than at
60° from the zenith. The magnitudes given in the final catalogue are
all reduced to what they would appear if the star were seen in the
zenith. It would be interesting to see some careful determination of
the atmospheric absorption made within the last year, for, in the opin-
ion of many observers, the transparency of the atmosphere and the
brightness of all the stars have sensibly diminished ever since the red
sunset phenomena following the Krakatoa explosion in August, 1883,
and by not a few all these effects, and the still continuing dirty pinkish
red corona around the sun, are attributed to Krakatoa dust still over-
head, though now at a considerably lower level than at first.

In all this work the constancy of brightness of the pole star was of
course a much-to-be-desired condition, and this question received very
careful investigation, and there seems to be no doubt of its reality so
far as photometric measurements can determine. Besides the use of
the long series of observations upon the 100 circumpolars, a special
series of naked-eye comparisons of Polaris, with several neighboring
stars of nearly equal brightness, was undertaken for this purpose, and
in connection with the latter some very interesting results come out,
showing that there is in the case of some observers a very decided dif-
ference (and very likely to some extent with all) in the apparent relative
brightness of two stars depending upon their relative positions right
and left and up and down. This had been shown in the photometric
work, so that in each comparison the two images in the field of the
photometer were reversed right and left between the two pairs of set-
tings of the Nicol. It is interesting to find that it also affects naked-
eye estimates, in spite of the fact that in the latter the endeavor is to
look steadily at one star and then at the other alternately.

The most important question of all is the scale of magnitudes adopted.
Professor Pickering has adopted that proposed some years ago by Pog-
son, the director of the Madras Observatory.

On this scale, then, we receive from a sixth-magnitude star, which is
about the limit of naked-eye vision, just one-hundredth part as much
light as from a first-magnitude (about one-fortieth that of a second, one-
sixteenth that of a third, three-nineteenths that of a fourth, and two-
fifths that of a fifth-magnitude star). This is the first time that the
magnitudes of the stars have been measured and catalogued on any
such extensive plan or with any such degree of accuracy, and at the
same time upon a true geometrical light-ratio scale, and it marks an
epoch and an entirely new starting pointin stellar photometry. Hith-
erto there has been much confusion in this matter, although a pretty
general adoption of Argelander’s scales of magnitudes has been slowly
mending this. But the work of Professor Pickering must inevitably,
from its intrinsic merit, at once replace all existing scales of magni-
174 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884,

tudes ; and, besides, it furnishes the first available data for a rigorous
comparison and reduction of all previous catalogues to a common truly
photometric scale. Many interesting results of these comparisons are
promised in part I1, some of which were outlined by Professor Picker-
ing at the September meeting of the American Association. The bulk
of the volume is taken up with chapter V, which contains the general
catalogue and its accompanying explanations. This has been more re-
cently issued separately, under the name of the Harvard Protometry,
and it should be in the hands of every professional and amateur astron-
omer at once the world over. In it is condensed in remarkably con-
venient form a vast mass of detailed information. Beside the results
of the Harvard photometric work with the number of observations and
the resulting probable error of the mean, are given the results of a
series of eye estimates undertaken specially to compare the two methods,
In columns alongside are the corresponding magnitudes in the four
principal standard catalogues of magnitudes, the Uranometria Nova of
Argelander, the Atlas Coelestis of Heis, the Durchmusterung of Arge-
lander, and the Uranometria Argentina of Gould. On the right-hand
page are the differences of magnitude between the Harvard Protometry
and fourteen other catalogues of eye estimates, and the three photo-
metric catalogues of Seidel, Wolff, and C: S. Peirce, for the compara-
tively small number of stars contained in these last; also a column de-
voted to the colors of the stars so estimated by Mr. W.S. Franks, of
the English Royal Astronomical Society, in a special series of observa-
tions for that purpose. Columns of reference numbers to the original
series for each observation, and also the residual of each from the mean,
are given in every case, so that the whole results lie open at a glance
allin one place. In printing these residuals, a novel use of type is
made, the negative ones being in italics, thus saving the space of plus
and minus signs and giving a much better appearance. Where the
residual is greater than nine and less than twenty, only the right-hand
figure is printed, but in heavy-faced type. The volume is from the
Cambridge University Press of John Wilson & Son, and is throughout,
especially in the tables and the catalogue, a beautiful piece of typo-
graphical work.

PHOTOGRAPHY AS A MEANS OF CHARTING STARS.

In a recent communication to the Paris Academy of Sciences, Ad-
miral Mouchez, director of the Paris Observatory, states that MM.
Henry, finding it almost impossible, ou account of the great number of
stars, to chart the part of the heavens which they have now reached
by the methods heretofore adopted, have had recourse to photography.
Their first attempt with a provisional apparatus has been so successful
that Admiral Mouchez considers that the problem will soon be solved.

length, corrected for the photographie rays, were submitted to the
meeting. Each plate contains a part of the sky extending 2° in hk. A.
by 3° in Dee., and contains about 1,500 stars from the 6th to the 12th
magnitude, 7. ¢., to the limit of visibility of an instrument of the size
used. The results have induced MM. Henry to undertake the construc-
tion of a powerful instrument for this class of work, and they are now
engaged in constructing an object-glass of 0".54 diameter, which will be
corrected for the photographic rays and so constructed as to cover
clearly and without distortion the greatest possible space. In reference
to the advantages of this method of charting, Admiral Mouchez points
out that work which ordinarily takes several months te perform can be
done in a single hour. It is considered that with the new apparatus
stars to the 13th or even 14th magnitude will probably be secured.
(The Observatory, October, 1884.)

Photographic maps of stars.—A catalogue of the magnitudes of 500 stars
situated in the constellations Auriga, Gemini, and Leo Minor, has been
determined by the Rev. T. EK. Espin from photographs taken with the
equatorial stellar camera at the observatory of the Liverpool Astronom-
ical Society. The magnitudes are compared with those given in Arge-
lander’s Durchmusterung, with which, in the large majority of cases,
they agree remarkably well. “There can be no doubt,” says Mr. Espin
(in the Observatory for September), ‘that the photographic impression
is nearly equal to the eye magnitude in the case of two-thirds of the
stars. The other third fall into one of two classes: the bluish stars in-
crease in magnitude, while the reddish ones decrease.” No positive
evidence of fluctuations of stellar light has been obtained ; in fact, of
the 500 stars whose magnitudes have been reduced from the plates,
only two cases of possible variation have been detected. Attempts
have also been made to photograph various star clusters and nebule.
The results are very promising, but much improvement is to be looked
for in the practical working and reduction of the plates. (Athenewum.)

COMETS, METEORS, ‘ZODIACAL LIGHT, ETC.

Statistics of cometic orbits.—Dr. Paul Lehmann, of Berlin, has reprinted
a compilation with the above title, which contains much interesting in-
formation in a tabular form. Two hundred and ninety-four cometic
orbits are more or less well known. Of these 221 have parabolic orbits,
and of the elliptic orbits
7 have a period from 10,000 to 50,000 years ;
23 have a period from 1,000 to 10,000 years ;
6 have a period from 500 to 1,000 years ;
9 have a period from 100 to 500 years ;
6 have a period from 50 to 100. years ;
5 have a period from 10 to 50 years ;
17 have a period from — to 10 years.
All the comets whose periods are under 10 years have direct motion,
176 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

and of the 28 comets whose periods are under 100 years, only 3 have
retrograde motion. ,

An interesting table of comets with similar orbits, which are yet not
identical, is also given, and further a table of those comets which are
related to each other in groups, so that all their orbits intersect in a
line. ‘These comets may be supposed to have had a common origin.

Definitive determination of comet orbits—For many years Dr. Bruhns
kept a general outlook over the matter of the definitive determination
of comet orbits, and his annual papers in the V.J.8. der Astron. Gesell.
were of great value in directing attention to the cases of comets whose
orbits needed attention, in indicating the sources from which observa-
tions could be taken, and by preventing unnecessary duplication of
such work through correspondence. Dr. Weiss, director of the Vienna
Observatory, has now agreed to fill the same place, and those intending
to occupy themselves with this branch of computation will do well to
address themselves to him.

Periodic comets.—Several periodical comets are expected to return to
perihelion in 1885. That of Olbers, discovered on the 6th of March,
1815, has been calculated to have a period of somewhat more than seventy
years, and will, therefore, probably appear again either in 1885 or 1886.
Encke’s comet was first discovered in 1786, but its periodicity was not
detected till 1819, since which time it has been observed at every return,
at intervals of about three and a third years. It will once more be in
perihelion on the 7th of March, 1885. A comet discovered by Herr
Tempel on the 3d of April, 1867, was found to be moving in an elliptic
orbit with a period of about six years; it was observed in 1873 and in
1879, and another return is expected to take place in April of the pres-
ent year. Another comet of short period was discovered by the same
astronomer on the 27th of November, 1869, but its periodicity was not
recognized until after it had been rediscovered by Mr. Swift, at Roches-
ter, N. Y., in 1880, in consequence of which it is usual to call it Swift’s
comet, The period is about five and a half years, so that another re-
turn to perihelion will be due about the end of this year; but like that
which must have taken place in 1875, it is likely to pass unseen, the
comet being unfavorably placed for observation. Tuttle’s comet oceu-
pies a position of its own in having a period amounting to about thirteen
and a half years. It was first discovered by Méchain, at Paris, on the
9th of January, 1790, but its periodicity was not detected until after
the second discovery by Mr. Tuttle, at Cambridge, United States, on
. the 4th of January, 1858, when it was found that it must have made
four unobserved returns since Méchain’s discovery. It was observed
again in the autumn of 1871, passing its perihelion at the end of No-
vember, and another return will be due in the month of July, 1885.
(Atheneum.)

Comet 1867, IJ.—M. Raoul Gautier, of Geneva, has been investigating
the perturbations produced by the action of the planets Jupiter, Saturn,
ASTRONOMY. LTT

and Mars upon the motions of the first periodical comet (II, 1867) of
Tempel. The peribelion passage in the year of discovery took place on
the 24th of May ; those on the two subsequent returns (both of which
were observed) on the 10th of May, 1873, and the 7th of May, 1879, re-
spectively ; but M. Gautier finds that the effect of the disturbances will
be to delay the return to petihelion this year until the end of June or
the beginning of July. The comet diminished in brightness at each
successive return, and is likely on this occasion to be even fainter than
in 1879. M. Gautier has published an ephemeris sufficiently accurate to
enable astronomers to find the comet when it makes its nearest approach
to the earth. It was first discovered on the 3d of A pril, 1867.

Brorsew’s comet of short period.—We have not yet met with any inti-
mation that an ephemeris of this comet for the approaching reappear-
ance is being prepared ; that for the last return, in 1879, was furnished
by Prof. L. R. Schulze, of Dobeln ; the time of perihelion passage was
about eleven hours later than his calculation gave it. Disregarding
perturbation, the comet would be again due at perihelion in the middle
of September next, in which case it would be observable in the two
hours before sunrise, in August and September, under somewhat simi-
lar conditions to those in 1873. Suppesing the perihelion passage to
occur September 14.5, the comet’s position at that time would be in
about R. A. 1549.5 and N. P. D. 769.2, the distance from the earth 1.41.

Since the discovery of this comet within one day of perihelion pas-
sage in 1846 it has been observed at four returns, viz, in 1857, 1868,
1873, and 1879. (Nature.)

The great comet of 1882.—Professor Howe, of Denver, Colo., notifies
that he has undertaken a definite determination of the orbit of this
comet, which will doubtless be a work of some labor. Thus far ealeula-
tion appears to indicate that the comet was moving in an ellipse, with
a period not differing much from eight centuries; Kreutz gave 843,
Fabritius §25, Frisby 794, and Morrison 712 years; the orbit of Fabri-
tius depends upon the widest extent of observation. Between the ear-
liest and latest accurate positions the comet described an orbital are of
3409,

Those who may have unpublished observations of position of the
great comet of 1582 will do well to communicate them to Professor
Howe forthwith. (Natwre.)

The great comet of 1882.—In an appendix to the Washington Obser-
vations, 1880, is an account prepared by Mr. W.C. Winlock, on the great
comet of 1882 as cbserved at Washington, first with the 9.6-inch and
subsequently with the 26-inch refractor. ‘The latest date on which the
comet’s position was determined is April 4, 1883. Micrometrical meas-
ures of the nucleus were made on a number of evenings, and from a plate

in the head of the comet, is very apparent. For a similar reason, in
another plate the points observed with the transit-circle from Septem-
ber 19 to March 3 are shown. There has rarely, if ever, existed a greater
need for precautions of this nature, to assist in the combination of the
places ovtained at various observatories for the accurate determination
of the orbit. (Wature.)

A new comet of short period.—M. Schulhof, of Paris, has lately ascer-
tained that the observations of the third comet of 1858 (a very limited
number) are closely represented by an elliptical orbit with a period of
about six years and a half.

Comet ¢,,1884.—When the observations of the comet (c, 1884) which
_ was discovered by Herr Wolf at Heidelberg on the 17th of September
had been carried on for a few weeks it became apparent that they
could no longer be represented by a parabola, but that the comet was
moving in an ellipse of short period. Its elements have been computed
by Professor Kriiger, of Kiel, and by Dr. Zelbr, of Vienna, the former
making the period about 2,391, and the latter about 2,470 days; that is,
somewhat more than six years and a half.

Prof. H. C. Wilson, astronomer in charge of the Cincinnati Observa-
tory, has issued the seventh publication of the observatory, which con-
tains the observations of the comets of 1880, 1881, and 1882, made under
the direction of Prof. Ormond Stone until June, 1882. Since that time
the work has been carried forward by himself.

Besides the ordinary observations for positions, interesting physical
studies of the comets for the three years named are also presented.
The method used in reducing and discussing observations of the trains
of comets is that of Professor Bredichin, director of the Observatory of
Moscow. For reduction to the plane of the orbit formulz found in A.
N. Nos. 300 and 1172 were used. This publication also contains ten
full-page drawings, showing interesting physical changes in nuclei and
tails of b 1881, a and ¢ of 1882. The notes that precede these drawings
are instructive, for tkey indicate how the new physical theories of
Professor Bredichin stand the test in relation to these comets.

The zodiacal light.—The current volume of the Proceedings of the
ASTRONOMY. 179

American Academy of Arts and Sciences contains a very valuable paper
by Mr. A. Searle on the zodiacal light, in which he has collected and
reduced on a uniform system the evening observations of the prin-
cipal observers of the zodiacal light. The points taken up are the ap-
proximate position of the zodiacal cone in the visible hemisphere of the
sky, the elongation of the vertex, and the latitudes of the northern and
southern boundaries at successive elongations 30° apart. The details
of more than 650 observations by Jones, Heis, Schmidt, and others are
exhibited in tabular form, whilst their results are conveniently and com-
pletely summarized in a number of other tables showing the monthly
means, and means for different series.

Mr. Searle supports Jones’s view that the apparent changes in the
place of the light should be referred rather to the corresponding changes
in the place of the ecliptic in the visible hemisphere than to the geo-
graphical position of the observer in latitude, and regards it as probable
that atmospheric absorption is an important and, perhaps, the only
cause of the variations of the zodiacal light in latitude. But ‘if. atmos-
pheric absorption has the importance here assigned to it, in the study
of the zodiacal light, we cannot expect to determine the true position of
the light on any occasion by the simple methods heretofore in use.”
Direct photometric observations must be made, or, failing these, ob-
servers ‘must compare together different portions of the light and also
specified portions of the light and of the Miiky Way.” And the Milky
Way must itself be studied in a similar systematic manner. A careful
_ photometric inquiry “is indispensable if we are to substitute definite
knowledge for the vague information now before us with regard to ‘ zo-
diacal bands,’ the singular phenomenon of the ‘Gegenschein,’ and the
possibly periodic variations in the main body of the zodiacal light, as
well asits apparent changes from hour to hour.”

In dealing with this question of the photometric observation of the
light, Mr. Searle mentions the interesting fact that from Celoria’s and
Sir W. Herschel’s observations the Milky Way would appear tobe about
two magnitudes brighter than the mean brightness of the sky. On this
astimate the brighter parts of the zodiacal light would be commonly
three or four magnitudes brighter than the surrounding sky.

Mr. Searle remarks in conclusion: “It is not my intention, on this
oceasion, to discuss the probability of any explanation of the zodiacal
light; I have merely to remark with regard to the ordinary meteoric
theory, that it gains greatly in simplicity if we dispense with all the im-
aginary meteoric. bodies or rings with which it has usually been con-
nected and retain merely the conception of meteoric dust diffused
throughout the solar system. It may be shown mathematically, if we
regard the meteoric particles as solids reflecting light irregularly, that
an appearance like the zodiacal cone with an indefinite vertex would
result.” (The Observatory, September, 1884, page 265.)
180 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.
THE SUN.

Solar eclipses—An interesting investigation respecting two ancient
eclipses was communicated by Herr Bernhard Schwarz to the Vienna
Academy last April. The first of these eclipses is one referred to in a
fragment of Archilochus preserved by Stobzeus (Florilegium ex. 10).

Professor von Oppolzer had already called attention to this passage,
and suggested that it probably referred to a solar eclipse which occurred
on the 6th of April, B. C. 648, in ordinary or historical chronology (647
in scientific chronology). Herr Schwarz has made a very careful cal-
culation of all the solar eclipses which took place during the life-time of
Archilochus, between the years B. C. 700 and 640. He finds that the
only choice lies between an eclipse which was annular in the Grecian
Archipelago in the afternoon of June 27, B. C. 661, and the above,
which was total in the morning of April6, B. C. 648. The probability
is that the eclipse of 648 is the one mentioned by the poet.

The other eclipse discussed by Herr Schwarz is mentioned in an As-
syrian inscription of Asurbanipal, to which attention was directed by
Dr. Jacob Krall. The inscription may be thus translated: ‘‘In the
month Tammuz an eclipse took place of the Lord of Day, the god of
light. The setting sun thereupon left off shining, and I in like manner
put off beginning the war against Elam during [here a gap in the text]
days.” Taking into account all the circumstances here mentioned, there
can scarcely be a.doubt that the eclipse referred to was the earlier of
the two before mentioned (June 27, B. C. 661), which, annular in the
Grecian Archipelago, was visible as a large partial eclipse a little before
sunset in Assyria and Persia. (Athenwum.)

Transit of Venus, 1882.—On the occasion of the transit of Venus of
1882 the commission of the Belgian Government, under the direction
Dr. J. C. Houzean, placed its chief reliance upon observations made
with a new form of heliometer, in which, by employing half objectives
of unequal focal length, the images of the Sun and Venns were nearly
equal, allowing an observation of the angular distance of the centers
of these two bodies to be taken by a single measure. With instruments
of this pattern, set up in the southern hemisphere at Santiago de Chili,
and in the northern at San Antonio, Tex., a sufficiently large number
of measures were made to afford a fair test of the worth of the new
method. The facility with which this instrument can be employed in
work of precision is shown well enough by the large number of obser-
vations obtained at the Santiago station, where no glouds interfered
with the progress of the measurements. Doctor Houzeau has completed
the discussion of the work of the two expeditions, and the results are
published as the first fascicule of the fifth volume of the Annales de
V Observatoire Royale de Bruxelles. Tle value of the solar parallax which
he derives is 8.911, or about one-tenth of a second larger than that
now regarded as the true value.

Sun-spots.—“ Report to the Solar Physics Committee on a Comparison
between Apparent Inequalities of Short Period in Sun-spot Areas and
in Diurnal Temperature Ranges at Toronto and at Kew.’ By Balfour
Stewart, M. A., LL.D., F. R.S.,and William Lant Carpenter, B. A., B. Se.
Communicated to the Royal Society at the request of the solar physics
committee.

It has been known for some time that there is a close connection be-
tween the inequalities in the state of the sun’s surface as denoted by
sun-spot areas and those in terrestrial magnetism as denoted by the
diurnal ranges of oscillation of the declination magnet; and moreover
the observations of various meteorologists have induced us to suspect
that there may likewise be a connection between solar inequalities and
those in terrestrial meteorology.

This latter connection, however (assuming it to exist), is not so well
established as the former, at least if we compare together inequalities
of long period. It has been attempted to explain this by imagining
that for long periods the state of the atmosphere as regards absorption
may change in such a manner as to cloak or diminish the effects of solar
variation by increasing absorption when the sun is strongest, and di-
minishing absorption when the sun is weakest.

On this account it seemed desirable to the authors to make a com-
parison of this kind between short-period inequalities, since for these
the length of period could not so easily be deemed sufficient to produce
a great alteration of the above nature in the state of the atmosphere.

The meteorological element selected for comparison with sun-spots
was the diurnal range of atmospheric temperature, an element which
presents in its variations a very strong analogy to diurnal declination
ranges.

It is such a comparison that the authors have made, their method of
analysis being one which enables them to detect the existence of un-
known inequalities having apparent periodicity in a mass of observa-
tions. A description of this method has already been published in the
Proceedings of the Royal Society for May 15, 1879. The comparison was
made by this method between sun-spot observations extending from
1832 to 1867, inclusive, Toronto temperature-range observations ex-
tending from 1844 to 1879, inclusive, and Kew temperature-range ob-
servations extending from 1856 to 1879, inclusive. The following con-
clusions were obtained from this comparison :

1, Sun-spot inequalities around twenty-four and twenty-six days,
whether apparent or real, seem to have periods very nearly the same
as those of terrestrial meteorological inequalities as exhibited by the
daily temperature-ranges at Toronto and at Kew.

2. While the sun-spots and the Kew temperature-range inequalities
present evidence of a single oscillation, the corresponding Toronto
temperature-range inequalities present evidence of a double oscillation.

3. Setting the celestial] and terrestrial members of each individual

inequality, so as to start together from the same absolute time, it is
found that the solar maximum occurs about eight or nine days after one
of the Toronto maxima, and the Kew temperature-range maximum
about seven days after the same Toronto maximum.

4, The proportional oscillation exhibited by the temperature-range
inequalities is much less than the proportional oscillation exhibited by
the corresponding solar inequalities. (Nature.)

Variations in the Suns diameter.— A pamphlet of 17 pages by Dr.
Hilficker, of the Observatory of Neuchatel, treats the 3,468 observations
of the Sun made by eight observers during the years 1862-83, with the
object of determining whether the Sun’s diameter varies. The meridian
circle has an aperture of 115™™, and a magnifying power of 200 is used,
and each limb of the Sun is observed on 13 threads, so that these obser-
vations are more suitable for the purpose than many other series which
have been used for the purpose. Besides the Neuchatel series, others
are quoted, though several papers on the subject are not referred to.

Dr. Hilficker gives two conclusions, which he regards as satisfactorily
proved by his discussion. These are (1) that the variations in the
diameter of the Sun shown by the Neuchatel observations are real;
(2) that these changes depend upon the period of the solar spots; that
is, that the largest diameters co-exist with the minimum Sun-spots, and
wice versa.

It will be noticed that this conclusion does not agree with those of
other discussions, notably with the very satisfactory one of Dr. Auwers,
based on the results of the observations of seven observatories, or with
the discussion of corresponding observations at Greenwich and Wash-
ington, by Professors Newcomb and Holden.

The Moon.— Dr. Th. von Oppolzer, of Vienna, has lately published an
attempt to explain the discrepancy between the observed value of the
secular acceleration of the moon’s mean motion and that derived from
the mathematical theory by Delaunay and Adams. This difference has
heretofore been supposed to be accounted for by the continued retard-
ing action of the tides on the rotational velocity of the earth; but Pro-
fessor Oppolzer, accepting the now generally believed pervasion of in-
terplanetary space by comminuted cosmical matter, proceeds to esti-
mate the threefold action of such matter on the motions of moon and
earth. First, the masses of both bodies are continually receiving slight
increments from the accumulation of this dust upon their surfaces. See-
ond, a part of this increment of the moon’s mass acts in such a way as
to decrease its tangential volocity. Third, the continued deposition of
cosmical dust on the surface of the earth changes its rotational velocity,
affecting thus the apparent motion of the moon. All these effects are
reduced to numbers, in the form of co-efficients of terms in the moon's

known quantity which represents the thickness of a layer of cosmical

be supposed to be 2.8 millimeters, the entire discrepancy iu the secular
acceleration of the moon’s motion disappears. And on the same hy-
pothesis, the density of the medium surrounding the earth and moon is
equivalent to the density of air divided by 3,760,000,000,000. Dr. von
Oppolzer’s paper will be found entire in No. 2573 of the Astronomische
Nachrichten. (The Nation.)

THE PLANETS.

Mercury.— Denning, in a recent number of the Observatory, gives an
account of certain markings detected by himself upon the surface of
Mercury, in November, 1883, from which he deduces a rotation period
of about twenty-five hours. The value given in our text-books, and
provisionally accepted, though with much reserve, is twenty-four hours
five minutes. depending upon certain observations of Schroeter and
Harding, at Lilienthal, early in tbe century. Schiaparelli, also, has ob-
served markings on the planet several times during the past two years,
and says that “ the rotation period, as usually adopted, is not exact; in
fact, is very far from the truth”; but he does not say whether he finds
the period greater or less than that assigned by Schroeter. A memoir
upon the planet Mercury is expected soon to appear from his pen, and
will probably add considerably to our present knowledge of the planet.

The photometry of Saturn’s ring.*—In his paper, Professor Seeliger en-
ters into some investigations with the view of pointing out the knowledge
that he thinks may be obtained with regard to the construction of
Saturn’s ring by means of photometrical observations of the amount
of light reflected from it at different times. Were the ring a body of
continuous surface, the apparent intensity of its illumination would
(unless, indeed, assumptions were made of an altogether improbable
kind as to its structure) be very different in different relative positions
of the Sun as well as the earth. Changes of this nature are not, as a
matter of fact, indicated by observation, the apparent brightness of the
ring being always nearly the same, and the amount of light received
from it would seem to depend entirely upon the proportion of the whole
surface which is turned toward the earth, or upon the angle of eleva-
tion of the earth above the plane of the ring. Hence Zéllner concluded
that Lambert’s law of photometry was not applicable to this ease. But
Professor Seeliger shows that, under certain plausible assumptions, the
observed efiects are consistent with that law, the extent of application of
which can hardly, he thinks, be overestimated. Maxwell pointed out,
twenty-five years ago, from purely mechanical considerations, that the
ring could not be a compact solid or fluid mass, but must consist of a
number of separate discrete particles similar to those which compose a
meteoric stream. On this supposition, the observed photometric condi-
tions admit of a simple explanation, though their full significance can-
not be worked out until more accurate observations have been made
with regard to the variation in intensity of the light of the ring at dif-

ferent times. Professor Seeliger’s hope is that the investigations and
considerations brought forward by him, in the paper before us, may have
the effect of interesting photometric observers in the subject, and in-
ducing them to devote more attention to it than has yet been done.
(The Observatory, October, 1884.)

Mass of Saturn.—F rom 128 observations of Japetus in 1875, 1876, and
1877, Prof. A. Hall has determined the mean distance of this satellite
with a very small accidental error. The periodic time has been deter-
mined by a comparison with observations by the Herschels. The result->
ing mass of Saturn is szh5-5. This is materially larger than the masses
deduced by Bessel (from Titan) and Le Verrier (from perturbations).

The figure of the planet Uranus.—Dr. Seeliger, director of the Munich
Observatory, has employed the 104-inch refractor (which has been re-
mounted by the Repsolds) in measures of the disks of the various plan-
ets. He employs a total reflecting prism back of the eye-piece, and can
therefore cause any diameter of the planet to appeae at any angle with
the vertical.

Measures of this kind have been made (on ten nights) on Uranus, and
Dr. Seeliger’s result is clearly against any ellipticity of the disk.

In this he disagrees with several late observers (Schiaparelli, Young,
and others), but agrees with the conclusions of Lassell, Bruhns, Engel-
man, and others. The question is not settled, in any event, but this
latest result is interesting specially on account of the method employed,
which avoids a dangerous kind of constant error.

The aspect of Uranus.—At the sitting of the Academy of Sciences of
Paris on April 21, M. Perrotin presented a note on the aspect of Uranus,
from observations made with the 15-inch equatorial at the Observatory
of Nice. On March 18 he had remarked, in company with Mr. Lockyer,
a bright spot near the lower limb of the planet, as seen in the inverting
telescope. Further observations showed that it was near the equator
of Uranus. It was a very difficult object, and much uncertainty existed
as to its exact position; it was better seen as it approached the limb.
It was observed on April 1 about 11", at the northern extremity of the
equatorial diameter, and on the next night about 10" 40™, at the south-
ern extremity; it occupied the same position on April 7 at 10" 30™, and
April 12 at 11". These observations, M. Perrotin adds, made at the
limits of visibility, required very favorable conditions, and being aware
of the possibility of illusion in such a case, he invites the attention of
observers possessed of powerful optical means, in order to control his
own impressions. The appearance and the indeterminateness in the
duration of the phenomenon on April 1, when the images were best,
rather point to a luminous belt than to a single spot, which introduces
uncertainty in the times of the observations; with due regard to this,
M. Perrotin finds a fair agreement with the assumption of a rotation not
differing much from ten hours. On April 12 Mr. Trépied was present,
and confirmed the impressions received by the Nice astronomer; he also
ASTRONOMY. 185

remarked in the bright part a condensation which had previously es-
caped notice.

By ‘‘diamétre equatorial” we presume M. Perrotin refers to the di-
ameter in the plane of the orbits of the satellites.

Uranus.—In a note communicated to the Academy of Sviences, Paris,
on June 9, MM. Henry stated that, observing on very fine nights with
the 15-inch refractor, they have satisfied themselves of the existence of
two gray belts, straight and parallel, and placed almost symmetrically
with respect to the center of the disk of Uranus, and that, by measures
of their direction, they have found an inclination of about 41° to the
orbits of the satellites; they assume that the planet’s equator is in the
direction of the belts.

THE MINOR PLANETS.

That part of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch. for 1887 containing
its specialty, the ephemerides of the small planets for 1885, has been
issued in advance of the publication of the volume. There are approxi-
mate places for every twentieth day of 237 out of the 244 now known,
with accurately calculated opposition ephemerides of 19. The most re-
liable elements of the orbits of these bodies to No. 237, inclusive, are
appended. Aethra continues at a distance of less than 1.0 from the
earth’ until February 11, and if the orbit had been more closely deter-
mined, would have afforded a favorable opportunity of applying’ the
method of finding the solar parallax suggested by Professor Galle, as
the planet has been a 9th magnitude at this apposition. Eva, Stephenia,
and Agathe also approach the earth during the present year, within her
mean distance from the sun; on August 10 Stephenia will be at a dis-
tance of only 0.76, magnitude 114.

Ajthra has the least perihelion distance of the group, 1.604, while
Andromache, with considerable eccentricity, has the greatest aphelion
distance, 4.726; so that the orbits of 244 planets extend over a space of
3.122, the earth’s mean distance from the being taken as unity. The
longest period of revolution occurs in the case of Hilda ; it is yet doubt-
ful which has the shortest period ; No. 149, Medusa, is credited with it at
present, but until his member of the group has been reobserved the
point is perhaps doubtful. The most recently detected planet appears
to have the shortest revolution next to Medusa judging from the ele-
ments in the last circular of the Berliner Jahrbuch. (Nature.)

186 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.
INTERNATIONAL MERIDIAN CONFERENCE.

The full text of the final act of the International Meridian Conference
is given below, extracted from the official publications.

The President of the United States of America, in pursuance of a
special provision of Congress, having extended to the Governments of
all nations in diplomatic relations with his own an invitation to send
delegates to meet delegates from the United States, in the city of Wash-
ington, on the first of October, 1884, for the purpose of discussing, and,
if possible, fixing upon a meridian proper to be employed as a common
zero of longitude and standard of time-reckoning throughout the whole
world, this International Meridian Conference assembled at the time
and place designated ; and, after careful and patient discussion, has
Caan the following enue.

1. “ That it is the opinion of this Congress that it is desirable to adopt
a single prime meridian for all nations, in place of the multiplicity of
initial meridians which now exist.”

2. “That the Conference proposes to the Governments here repre-
sented the adoption of the meridian passing through the center of the
transit instrument at the Observatory of Greenwich as the initial me-
ridian for longitude.”

3.<"* That from this meridian, longitude shall be counted in two diree-
tions up to 180 degrees, east longitude being plus and west longitude
minus.”

4, ‘“* That the Conference proposes the adoption of a universal day for
all purposes for which it may be found convenient, and which shall not
interfere with the use of local or other standard time, where desirable.”

5. “ That this universal day is to be a mean solar day ; is to begin for
all the world at the moment of mean midnight of the initial meridian,
coinciding with the beginning of the civil day and date of that merid-
jan; and is to be counted from zero up to twenty-four hours.”

6. ‘“* That the Conference expresses the hope that as soon as may be
practicable the astronomical and nautical days will be arranged every-
where to begin at mean midnight.”

7. “ That the Conference expresses the hope that the technical studies
Jesigned to regulate and extend the application of the decimal system
to the division of angular space and of time shall be resumed, so as to
permit the extension of this application to all cases in which it presents
real advantages.”

The action in the various countries upon these propositions, so far as
it is known, is as follows. 1t should, however, be premised that no one
of the Governments concerned has yet notified its decisions and that
the action taken is, in a sense, unofficial :

England.—The Astronomer Royal has ordered that the universal day
be adopted within the observatory at Greenwich. And the public clock
at the gate in Greenwich Park has been set to the new time, i. e., back
ASTRONOMY. 187

125, As an experiment, a small almanac is published in Nature in
the new time. Nothing has been said of any change in the Nautical
Almanac.

France.—No official action has been taken, and there is no prospect
that the universal day will be adopted either in the National Observa-
tory or in the computations of the Connaissance des Temps.

Germany.—Professors Foerster, Auwers, and Tietjen have declared
against the universal day on principle, and bave announced that the
Berliner Jahrbuch will not adopt it. Professor Krueger, the editor of
the Astronomische Nachrichten, is understood to oppose any such change
as comtemplated.

United States.—The policy of the officials of the United States has
been vacillating, but the final decision is to adhere to the present
mode of reckoning. According to an official publication of the Superin-
tendent of the Naval Observatory, the opinion among American astron-
omers is against the change. The superintendent of the American
Ephemeris has practically announced that no change will be made in
the Ephemeris before 1900 A. D.

A consideration of the above statements leads to the conclusion that
the net result of the Conference has been the adoption of the meridian
of Greenwich as a prime meridian from which to measure longitudes.

In this connection it may be of interest to record that the United
States has legalized the use of ‘ Eastern Time” (the local solar time of
the 75th meridian W. from Greenwich) in Washington, ete., and that
the State of Connecticut has adopted this time as standard within the
State.

The mean solar time of the 90th meridian, ‘Central Time,” has been
made the legal time within the State of Wisconsin.

REPORTS OF OBSERVATORIES, ETC.

The article ‘‘ Observatory ” in the ninth edition of the Hneyclopedia
Britannica is from the pen of Dr. J. L. E. Dreyer, director of Armagh
Observatory, and formerly editor of Copernicus. The article commences
with a brief introduction giving an outline of the development of ob-
servatories, from the days of Hipparchus to the present time. A gazetteer
of the principal existing observatories follows, in which is given a de-
scription of the equipment and work of each, as full as space permits.
A number of English private observatories, now discontinued, are also
described, on account of their historical interest and the important work
which has been performed at many of them. (Zhe Observatory, Sep-
tember, 1884.)

Reports of English Observatories.—From the Monthly Notices, R. A. S.,
the following short notices of the activity of English observatories are
condensed:

Armagh.—A permanent fund of $10,000 is provided, whose income
helps to support the Observatory. A 10-inch Grubb refractor 1s in
process of construction. The new Armagh catalogue is in the press,
188 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

Dr. Dreyer has printed (for private circulation) an historical account
of the Armagh Observatory in a pamphlet of twenty pages. The front-
ispiece gives an autotype picture of the buildings. This account is of
much interest, since the history of the observatory extends from 1791 to
now.

Cambridge.—Three thousand one hundred and twenty five meridian
observations have been made, 2,433 of which relate to zonestars between
25° and 30°. Division errors have been investigated.

Dunsinsk.—The meridian circle is used to observe stars between 29
and 25° south declination. It is not stated what list is under observa-
tion. It appears that the observations are not differential in declina-
tion since the Nadir gives the zero of declination.

EHdinburgh.—Is pressing upon the Government the printing of the
remaining volumes of its star catalogue.

Glasgow.—Is observing a list of proper motion stars.

Kew.—Continues drawings of solar spots, and testing of sextants,
watches, and meteorological instruments, ete.

Liverpool—Continues its work on the effect of temperature on chro-
nometers.

The Oxford University Observatory.—The professor of astronomy has
issued his annual report to the board of visitors of the University Ob-
servatory. The attendance of students at the lectures has been greater
than at any previous time, and the professor mentions ‘the phenom-
enon” of the regular appearance of two ladies at his lectures on the
planetary and lunar theories, at the same time reminding the board
what even the approximate mastery of such theory implies.

On the astronomical work of the staff of the institution during the
year, Professor Pritchard’s report is a most favorable one. He refers to
three memoirs on important astronomical questions which have issued
therefrom, and which have been printed in the Memoirs of the Royal
Astronomical Society. These include an extensive memoir by him-
self on the “Photometric Determination of the Relative Brightness
of the Brighter Stars North of the Equator,” in which his work at Cairo
is brought to bear, and a memoir by the first assistant, Mr. W. E. Plum-
mer, on the probable motion of the solar system in space, the data for
which depend upon Mr. Stone’s recent catalogue of southern stars; it is
a memoir very similar in character to the well-known one by the late
Mr. Galloway. Further, Professor Pritchard has communicated to the
Royal Astronomical Society a paper, which was read at the last meeting,
demonstrating, as he thinks, the existence of small displacements among
the Pleiades. Upwards of a thousand measures of the relative bright-
ness of stars were made, leaving about the same number to be made in
the next year. This measurement of all the naked-eye stars from the
pole to the equator will furnish a Uranometria Nova Oxoniensis, and
‘Professor Pritchard hopes that its publication may be undertaken by
the University Press. The measures of the Pleiades having been com
ASTRONOMY. 189

pleted, he now intenus to devote himself to lunar work—the determina-
tion of selenographical longitude and latitude of alarge number of points
on the moon’s surface by means of a valuable series of lunar photographs
at the observatory. Reference is made, in addition to the Pleiades
work, to the existence of measures of some 250 stars in another cluster
made at the observatory a few years since, and to be shortly reduced and
published; the particular cluster is not indicated in the report, but pre-
sumably may be M. 39 in Cygnus, described by Messier when he ob-
served it in 17/4 as “‘a star-cluster of 1° diameter.” (Nature.)

Radcliffe Observatory.—Has made over 3,000 transit circle observa-
tions on the sun (103), moon (62), and stars.

Savilian Observatory.—Is completing its photometry of naked-eye
stars, and has begun the triangulation of the Junar surface.

Temple Observatory, Rugby.—Measures of double stars are continued.

Stonyhurst College Observatory.—Continues its meteorological work
and has made 281 drawings of the whole solar disk on 257 days. Atten-
tion is paid to the spectra of sun-spots, and the protuberances are ob-
served.

Leyton Observatory (Mr. Barclay’s).—Is about to publish its volume V.

Mr. Common’s Observatory.—Is about to erect a 5-foot reflector for
photography alone. The glass disk has been on hand since 1883 and
seems to be satisfactory.

Lord Crawford’s Observatory.—Vol. IIT is about to be issued.

Mr. Crossley’s Observatory.—Has been become possessed of Mr. Com-
mown’s 3-foot reflector.

Lord Rosse’s Observatory.—Has been employed in measures of lunar
radiant heat and in drawings of Jupiter and Mars.

Colonel Tomline’s Observatory.—Has observed the comets of the year.

Colonel Tupman’s Observatory.—Has just been equipped with an 33-
inch meridian circle, a 44-inch refractor, and an 184-inch reflector.

Cape of Good Hope Observatory.—lts work is elsewhere described.

Hong-Kong Observatory.—Is chiefly meteorological and for time-signals ;
but will soon possess a 6-inch equatorial.

The V. J. S. der Astronomischen Gesellschaft for 1884 contains, as
usual, reports from the various European observatories. The following
notes are condensed from these reports, and give a connected account
of the activity of the various establishments for 1883 :

Athens.—The Sun was observed on 355 days; the Moon had 534 points
determined in its topography ; Jupiter was drawn 63 times.

A memoir on the comet of 1882 is nearly ready for printing ; 39,400
comparisons of variable stars were made.

Berlin.—Dr. Becker has left the observatory to take charge of the
Gotha Observatory.

The Zone + 20° to + 25° is finished so far as observations are con-
cerned. To determine the influence of the magnitude of the stars on
the deduced R. A., the transits of 247 stars were observed on 13 eve-
190 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

nings, both with the full objective, and through w-re nettings held in
front of the objective, so as to reduce their magnitude to a given stand-
ard. It was found that faint stars were observed later by 0*.007 per
magnitude.

It is mentioned in this report that two observers determined the
places of 240 stars (using 57 fundamental stars for comparison) in four
nights. One observer made the pointings, the other read the micro-
scopes. :

Volume Vv of the Berlin Observations will shortly be printed.

The computing bureau has issued the Berliner Jahrbuch as usual, as
well as the two periodicals, Circulars and Correspondence regarding ob-
servations of planets.

Bonn.—The observatory continues to concentrate its efforts on two
great works, the Zone 40° —50°, and the southern Durchmusterung. In
the latter work 114,615+1,161 stars have been observed. The observa-
tion and reductions of this work are now completed and the printing
of the catalogue is begun.

Brussels.—The catalogue of E.-Quetelet is printed from 0* to 12°.
The labors of the observatory in spherical astronomy, in physical as-
tronomy, and celestial mechanics, as well as in regard to the transit of
Venus, 1882, are described in the report.

Dresden (private observatory).—Baron vy. Eng!ehardt continues at bis
private observatory the observations of minor planets, of comets, and
of nebule. Twenty-one planets have been observed 63 times; 3 comets
have been observed 43 times; 47 nebule have been observed 95 times.

Dusseldorf.—!n 1883, 13 planets have been observed 49 times; since
1847, 144 planets have been observed 1,151 times.

Six asteroid orbits are computed yearly.

Frankfort-on-the- Main (private observatory).— Herr Eppstein has made,
since 1881, 444 gauges, containing 8,332 stars in 115 positions on 23
nights. In all, about 47,000 stars in 2,426 fields in 774 positions.

Sun-spot observations are also regularly made by Herr Eppstein.

Geneva.—The 10-inch equatorial has been used for observations of
nebule, double stars, asteroids, and satellites of Saturn.

The small equatorial has been used to study the solar prominences.

Gotha.—Dr. EK. Becker has lately been appointed to the charge of the
Gotha Observatory. The larger part of the report relates to repairs
and to changes which have been made in the instruments.

Dr. Becker continues the reductions of the BerlinZone + 20° to + 259.
The Moon, the inferior planets and those Mayer stars not in the Funda-
menta will be observed on the meridian.

Grignon.—The observatory of the Priory of St. John of Grignon,
was founded in 1879, and this report relates to its instrumental equip-
ment and to its observations of sun-spots, planets, and comets.

Hereny (Hungary).—Vol. 1 of its publications has been distributed.
The observations relate to the spectra of fixed stars, of variables, and

4
ASTRONOMY. 191

of comets, as well as to drawings, ete., of Jupiter with meteorological
observations.

Kalocsa.—The latitude of the observatory has been accurately deter-
mined. The Sun is regularly observed. Dr. Braun, the director, has
contrived a trigonometer with which any spherical triangle can be solved
(to about 5’ of arc) with great facility (22 triangles in 10 minutes)

Kiel.—Several additions have been made to the instruments ; notably
a comet-seeker and a star-spectroscope.

The Chronometer Observatory has been separated from the Kiel Ob-
servatory, and constituted a distinct establishment under the.charge of
Dr. C. F. W. Peters. The Helsingfors-Gotha Zone is now printing.
Kiel has been telegraphically connected with one of the longitude sta-
tions of the European Gradmessung.

The Astronomische Nachrichten is regularly published here.

Leipsic.—The changes to the instruments appear to be nearly com-
pleted. The observatory has acquired the astro-physical apparatus be-
longing to the late Professor Zoellner.

The work of observation and reduction of the Zone + 5° to + 10°
continues, as well as the reduction of the old Zone +10° to +152.

Leipsic (private observatory).—Dr. Engelmann made, in 1882, 1,200
observations of 400 double stars; in 1883, 1,600 observations of 540
double stars, as well as other observations.

Victoria and Sappho were observed to determine the solar parallax
on Dr. Gill’s plan.

Observatory at Liége—The Belgian Government has founded an ob-
servatory at Liége for astronomy, meteorology, and magnetism, under the
direction of Professor Folie.

LIund.—The Zone observations are finished. Dr. Dunér has measured
80 double stars, 563 spectra of red stars, and 55 wave lengths in star
spectra of the III type. Victoria and Sappho have also been observed
by Dr. Engstrom.

Milan.—The 18-inch equatorial is not yet received.*

The 8-inch equatorial has been employed in making (395) observa-
tions of double stars, (64) observations of 3 comets, ete.

The most generally interesting work of the observatory is the prepa-
ration of Baron Dembowski’s observations for the press. They will be
printed in two volumes. The contents of vol. I is as follows:

I. 2,100 measures of 611 stars made at Naples.

11. 2,155 measures of 432 stars of Otto Struve’s catalogue.

111. 663 measures of 199 stars, whose distance is between 32” and
120”.

Iv. 1,229 measures of 342 doubles, discovered by Burnham.

vy. 476 measures of 134 miscellaneous pairs.

*It is understood that the cost of the dome and telescope is to be paid from a grant
of 250,000 franes ($50,000). The objective cost 45,000 francs ($9,000), and is made by
Merz. The mounting (by Repsold) cost 65,000 franes ($13,000).
192 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

vi. 919 observations of 26 circumpolar pairs.

In all 7,542 measures.

Vol. 11 will contain 13,800 measures of W. Struve’s Dorpat catalogue.

Munich.—The repairs are nearly completed. Among the 37,000 stars
whose places have been fixed at Munich, some 9,000 have been only
once observed, and are in no other catalogue. These are to be each
once observed.

The Munich Zones are being completely re-reduced and brought up
to 1880.0 with comparisons with Lalande, Bessel, Santini, Ruemker,
Schellerup, Copeland, and Argelander.

O’ Gyalla.—Stars are spectroscopically observed in the Zone 0° to— 15°.
These observations include stars to 7 magnitude, and each star is ob-
served twice. Special star spectra are more carefully investigated.
Comet spectra have also been regularly observed. The color of all stars
to 4 magnitude, inclusive, are observed with a Zoellner’s colorimeter.
The Sun was regularly observed (on 203 days). Many other investiga-
tions are also in progress, for an account of which reference must be
made to the original report.

Padua.—The work of the observatory is intimately connected with
that of the Italian Geodetic Commission.

The Observatory of Paris.—Admiral Mouchez’s report on the state of
this establishment and the work accomplished therein during the past
year, commences with some details of his scheme for erecting a succur-
sal observatory at a distance from Paris, where the disadvantages of
location in the midst of a great city would be avoided. His proposal
was to dispose of a part of the actual grounds of the observatory, a step
which would be likely to realize a sum adequate to the erection of the
new building, at the same time retaining the present one to form the
headquarters of the burean des caleuls, the archives, and the museum,
the two establishments to remain under the same direction and to con-
stitute together the Observatory of Paris. This scheme, it is.known,
has not met with general acceptance at the hands of the scientific au-
thorities.

M. Lewy, in charge of the meridian service, has been occupied with
the reobservation of stars in the catalogue of Lalande, while a large
number of observations of the sun, moon, and planets has also been
made, eighteen observers taking part in this work in the course of the
year. The equatorials of 12 and 14 inches aperture and the equatorial
coudé were employed on observations of comets and small planets. The
Ecliptical Charts Nos. 12, 19, 48, and 67, have progressed, and attention
has been paid to double-star measures. M. Mouchez reports that the
construction and installation of the great telescope (0™74.) has been
retarded by the difficulty of establishing it in the grounds of the observa-
tory at Paris. In the department of astronomical physics, MM. Thol-
lon and Trépied had been occupied for six weeks on the Pic du Midi,
where, with M. Naussinat, in present charge of the observatory, they
ASTRONOMY. 193

studied the advantages of the station, more especially for solar obser-
vations, concluding that great scientific interest would attach to work
that might be accomplished during the four or five weeks of the fine
season in a small observatory at that point. Funds for the purpose are
not yet available.

M. Mouchez further reports upon the distribution of time in Paris,
the additions to the museum during the year, which consist of instru-
ments of the last century found in the Observatory of Toulouse, a por-
trait of Copernicus, etc.; the work of the bureau des Caleuls, which re-
- mains in charge of M. Gaillot; the publications of the observatory during
the year, including vol. xvu, of the Annales, in which are some impor-
tant, memoirs, theoretical and practical; and the personal work of the
staff.

A plan of the grounds of the institution is appended, on which are
distinguished those portions which M. Mouchez had proposed to alienate
with the view to providing means for the erection of an observatory at
a distance from Paris. (Nature.)

Plonsk (private observatory).—Solar spots are regularly observed, as
well as the positions and spectra of comets and the relative situations
of double stars.

Potsdam.—Dr. Vogel has had the privilege of using the large Vienna
refractor during three months of 1883 for the investigation of the spee-
tra of faint stars.

Jupiter and Mars have been regularly observed by Dr. Loehse.

Sixty-nine nebule have been observed for position with the helio-
meter.

The major planets (except Uranus) were photometrically observed
each five times or more. Many variable stars have been observed.
The Sun is observed constantly, and a great number of other researches
are in hand.

Prague (private observatory.)—Professor Safarik has made 1,830 de-
terminations of the magnitude of 97 variable stars on 161 nights, be-
sides many other determinations of brightness as of the planets, comets,
zodiacal light, ete.

Stockholm.—Dr. 4yldén’s report relates chiefly to the progress made
in his new method of determining the absolute elements of the eight
major planets, and cannot be summarized here.

The meridian-circle is devoted to the observations of all stars north
of + 45° which are in the Radcliffe catalogue.

Zurich.—The Sun was observed on 302 days; 2,400 single positions
of solar spots have been determined. Jupiter has been observed on
28 days, and observations of comets, etc., have been made.

Observatory of Algiers —This observatory was reorganized in 1881.
The director is M. Trepied, and the assistant M. Rambaud. The ap-
propriation is 12,900 frances (about $2,600). The principal instruments

are a reflector of 20 inches aperture; a reflector of 13 inches aperture;
a Thollon spectroscope, giving the dispersion of 31 flint prisms; a small
meridian circle; spectroscopes; apparatus for solar photography. An
account of this observatory is given in Bulletin Astronomique April, 1884.

Australian observatories.—The eighteenth annual report of the director
of the observatory at Melbourne has been issued. The new transit-
circle was expected in a short time, and would find the new circle-room
ready to receive it, but the instrument which had been in use for twenty
years continued to give excellent and trustworthy results; nevertheless,
each year had forced upon Mr. Ellery the necessity of greater optical
scope for the meridian work. The inevitable loss of reflective power in
the great telescope increases a litile year by year, but does not yet
sensibly affect the work upon which it isemployed. Indeed, Mr. Ellery
says, ‘‘some photographs of faint objects obtained lately are clear evi-
dence of the immense light-gathering power it still possesses, and of
the trivial loss occasioned so far by the slight tarnish apparent.” The
instrument had not been kept quite so closely to its special work—the
revision of the southern nebule—as before, owing to the number of
nights occupied with the great comet, and in experimenting in celestial
photography. Among the subjects of observation Mr. Ellery refers to
the transit of Venus, the Port Darwin Expedition for determination of
longitude of Australian observatories, and measures of differences of
declination of the minor planets Sappho and Victoria for determination
of the solar parallax, according to the scheme arranged by Mr. Gill.
The great comet of 1882 was kept in view for 250 days, or until April
26, 1883. A large portion of the work connected with the telegraphic
determination of the longitude of Australian observatories from Green-
wich fell upon the Melbourne establishment, which is now assumed to
be in longitude 9» 39™ 538.37 E., subject, perhaps, to some very small
correction. As soon as the new transit-circle was properly adjusted,
it was Mr. Ellery’s intention to devote it to the revision of a rather large
catalogue, of stars, at the request of the Astronomische Gesellschaft,
besides its more special work. The great telescope would be applied
more exclusively to the continuation of the revision of Sir John Her-
schel’s nebule, several of which, by the way, the Melbourne observers
have not been able to find. (Nature.)

Observatory of Natal_—From a late issue of Science we learn of astro-
nomical work now going on at Natal, under the direction of Mr. Edmund
Neison, Government astronomer at that place. The following subjects
are being pursued :

1. “ The determination of the exact amount of parallactic inequality of
the motion of the Moon by means of observations of the positions’of a
crater near the center of the lunar surface.

2, “The determination of the exact diameter of the Moon by observa-
tions of pairs of points near the limb,
ASTRONOMY. 195

3. “The effect of irradiation and its variations on the apparent semi-
diameter of the Moon.

4, “The systematic variation of the apparent place produced by the
irregularities on its limb.

5. “The real libration of the Joon by a method independent of the
errors caused by abnormal variations in the apparent semi-diameter of
the Moon.

Boswell Observatory.—A_ new observatory at Doane College, Crete,
Nebr., has been recently erected, and is now being supplied with
astronomical instruments. The equatorial telescope has an object-glass
of 8 inches aperture, made by the Clarks. The mounting is furnished
at Madison, Wis. Prof. G. D. Swezey, under whose directions the
observatory is being equipped, has already secured a Buff and Burger
transit instrument, a Howard mean-time clock, a Sewell break-circuit
chronometer, a Seth Thomas clock, and a set of meteorological ap-
paratus.

The building and instruments have cost about $7,000.

Chicago Observatory.—From the annual report of the director of the
Dearborn Observatory at Chicago, Prof. G. W. Hough, it appears
that the chief instruments have been kept in constant use. A gas en-
gine is now employed to turn the dome covering the great telescope.
The Repsold meridian circle is used only for observations connected
with the time-service. The great telescope, of 18 inches aperture, has
been exclusively employed in the observation of a few objects, (1) the
Pons-Brooks comet, the changes in the structure of which were not re-
markable; (2) difficult double stars, thirty-two new objects of this class
having been discovered by Professor Hough; (3) the planet Jupiter,
the principal objects of interest being the great red spot first noticed in
1875, and which has maintained its size, shape, and outline with very
slight change, the great equatorial belt, which has been subject to
gradual drift in latitude from year to year, and the equatorial white
spots, which, with the envelope they are situate in, move with a velocity
of 260 miles per hour, thus revolving about the planet in a month and
a half; (4) the planet Saturn, with negative results so far as markings
on or subdivisions of the rings were concerned ; and (5) the satellites of
Uranus, which were such difficult objects as not to have been frequently
seen. Six drawings of Jupiter’s disk were made, four of which are
printed in the report. As heretofore, Mr. 8S. W. Burnham has con-
tinued his observations of double stars with the great telescope. (Zhe
Nation.) Professor Hough is experimenting with a printing chrono-
graph.

Columbia College Observatory.—Myr. Lewis M. Rutherford, of New York
City, has presented to the trustees of .Columbia College the valuable
astronomical instruments of his private observatory on Second avenue,
as follows; A 13-inch equatorial telescope with mounting and clock-

work complete; a photographic lens with accessories for celestial
photography ; two micrometers for measuring double stars; four mi-
crometers for measuring star plates; a transit instrument by Stackpole
& Brother; a sidereal clock, and additional appliances for the observa-
tory. Mr. Rutherford generously bears the expense of moving and of
remounting the instruments.

Observatory of the University of Virginia.—Messrs. Warner and Swa-
sey, of Cleveland, Ohio, have completed the great dome for the new
McCormick Observatory at the University of Virginia. It is hemis-
pherical in shape and is 45 feet in diameter, and a personal inspection
has convinced the writer of its excellent qualities.

It can be revolved 360° in 808, by a pull of 15 pounds onarope. The
direct pressure required to move it is 45 pounds. The three shutters
can be opened in 208, by a pull of about 10 pounds.

Willets Point.—A very interesting report is published by General H.
L. Abbot, of the Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army, on the astronomical
work which has been done during 1884 at the engineer post of Willets
Point, New York Harbor. It is to this schoolof application that young
officers of engineers are sent to learn the practical application of. their
studies at West Point. They are taught the practice of military sur-
veying, mining, torpedo service, ete., and also the application of astron- —
omy to military and boundary surveys. Each year a general order is
issued, giving the results of the past year’s work in practical astron-
omy. The order for 1884 may be summarized as follows: |

Each officer makes a long series of determinations of local time with
various instruments, and in various ways. With the portable transit,
the time otf transit isat first recorded by an assistant, at the word given
by the observer; next, the observer records his own time by the relay
beat of a chronometer every 1 second; next by the chronographic method,
and lastly by the beat of the chronometer itself (every 0.5 second). Be-
ginners use these methods in succession in the order named. :

Personal equation is studied by means of Eastman’s machine (see
Wash. Ast. Obs., 1875).

The time determinations are given for each day of observation, with
the probable errors.

Time determinations by sextant observations are also given, and by
means of the (known) correction of the standard chronometer the error
of each observation and observer is determined.

We quote below the errors of the sextant clock corrections so deter-
mined. (Usually 10 altitudes of an east star and 10 of a west were em-
ploved).)) 35.0; 3.8; 2.05 1.2% 6.5 185205809: 0.75: Odi Ge LO:

each instrument from each pair of stars (Safford’s catalogue), is given
in detail, and compared with the results of past years.

The mean of all the observations for latitude made in 1884, is as fol-
lows, all pairs and observations having equal weight:

Zenith telescope by Wurdemann (190 observations on 43 pairs) gives
40° 47/ 20.47.

Zenith telescope, by Lingke (333 observations on 54 pairs) gives 40°
47’ 20/'.92.

Grand mean for observations of 1884, giving observations and instru-
ments equal weight, is 40° 47/ 20/”.75.

“The grand mean of 2,172 observations made at the new observatory
during the past five years is 409° 47/ 21/.23; but it will be noticed that
there has been a steady reduction in the yearly means during this en-
tire period, and that the less exact determination at the old observatory
indicates a change in the same direction.”

Although the nature of the observations and the small absolute value
of the quantity in question render it quite possible to attribute this
solely to errors of observation, the fact is, nevertheless, an extremely
interesting one in its relation to the question of the variability of terres-
trial latitudes, and deserves further exemination.

Longitude was determined by lunar culminations, ard the errors of
each separate result compared with the known (telegraphic) longitude

Longitudes by lunar distances were also determined with errors as
below: 16°.5; 12.9; 7.3; 6.7; 46.4; 39.7; 23.95 11.7.

Auroral displays are regularly noted by the sentinels, and an inter-
esting table of the results since 1870 is given.

What has been given as an abstract of one year’s work in only one
department of this school of application for young engineer officers is
sufficient to show that we have at present no better school of practical
astronomy in America.

Yale Colleye Observatory.—The observatory in Yale College is now
without a director, Professor Newton having resigned that office last
May, being now the secretary to the board of managers, whose presi-
dent is Dr. Porter, the president of the college. The points of most
importance in the secretary’s report for the year 1884 relate to the pho-
tograpus of the late transit of Venus taken by Mr. Willson, and now in
198 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR isa.

the hands of the Government commissioner at Washington—photographs
which Professor Harkness reports as ‘likely to yield valuable results”;
to the partial reduction of observations made with the heliometer; and
to the appointment in January, 1884, of Dr. Elkin as the astronomer
in charge of this instrument for a period of three years. In addition to
a thorough general investigation of the new heliometer, Dr. Elkin
reports a series of observations of the diameter of the planet Venus, the
determination of a large number of positions of the Moon, and good
progress in his principal work, the triangulation of the group of the
Pleiades. Mr. Sherman, assistant in the observatory, has been engaged
in magnetic observations, and in determinations of the form, polariza-
tion, and position of the Pons-Brooks comet. The details of Dr. Wal-
do’s report on the horologic and thermometric bureaus occupy more
than half of the entire pamphlet. He notes a marked increase in the
excellence of the watch-movements submitted to the observatory tests.
An international system of watch trials has been agreed upon, by which
the. operations at Geneva, Kew, and New Haven will be strictly com-
parable. The work of the thermometric bureau has been much ex-
tended over previous years, and there has been a total of more than
6,000 thermometers examined. (Zhe Nation.)

ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS.

In 1879 Privy Counsellor Otto von Struve, director of the observatory
at Pulkova, near St. Petersburg, visited America and contracted with
the Messrs. Clark for the construction of an object-glass 50 inches in
diameter. It was completed last year and accepted by Dr. Struve, who
came to this country to examine critically its performance. The mount-
ing for this great glass has been made at the shops of the Repsolds,
where many cardinal improvements in the mounting and mechanical
accessories generally have been devised.* This telescope will be set up
at Pulkova, and ready for work, at some time during the present year.

A section of Professor Newcomb’s late report relates to the new equa-
torial coudé at the Paris Observatory, a refractor in which the rays of
light are brought to the object-glass after reflection from two plane mir-
rors. The chief advantage of this construction is that the observer does
not have to follow the eye-piece of his telescope, but always sits in a
given position in a comfortable room. This form of instrument is not
suitable when the highest optical power is sought; but it surpasses all
others in convenience of use.

The French astronomers have lately devised a new method of sup-
porting a revolving dome, wherein the base of the dome will be an an-
uular caisson, floating in a similarly shaped trough filled with water so
treated as to prevent its freezing. The dome to which this plan is to
be applied is 65 feet in diameter.

* It is understood that the cost of this elegant and elaborate mounting was 36,250
dollars,
ASTRONOMY. 199

We learn from Nature that M. Charles Feil has, after some years’ ab-
sence, returned to the active management of his celebrated manufact-
ory of optreal glass in Paris, the new firm being “Feil pére et Man-
tois.” M. Feil is grandson to M. Guinand, who, some sixty years since,
by a mode of working almost identical with that adopted by the cele-
brated potter, Palissy, overcame the serious obstacles which occur in
securing the perfect homogeneity of both crown and flint glass, and
whose secrets have descended to his grandson. (The Nation.)

Lassel’’s 2-foot reflector at Greeuwich.—The new dome for this telescope
was completed by Messrs. T. Cooke & Sons at the end of last March,
and is in every respect satisfactory. It is 30 feet in diameter, covered
with papier-maché, on an iron frame-work, and turns with great ease.
The shutter-opening extends from beyond the zenith to the horizon and
is closed by a single curved shutter (3 feet 6 inches wide at the zenith
and 6 feet wide at the horizon), which turns about a point in the dome-
curb opposite to the shutter-opening, and runs on guiding-rails at the
horizon and near the zenith, the curved shutter being continued by an
open frame-work to complete the semicircle. This arrangement appears
to leave nothing to be desired as regards ease of manipulation. The
equatorial has required a number of small repairs and general clean-
ing, Some parts of the mounting having been probably strained in
process of removal, and the bearings in particular having suffered from
wear and subsequent disuse, so that it has been necessary to raise the
instrument and regrind these in several instances. The mirror has
been cleaned, and appears to be in very good condition as regards pol-
ish. The definition on stars seems to be very good as far as it has been
practicable to test it before the mounting of the telescope has been put
into proper order. The delay in the completion of the dome has nec-
essarily delayed the work on the instrument, which is now rapidly ad-
ancipg to completion. (Nature.)

Dr. H. C. Vogel’s opinion of the objective of the great Vienna refractor.—
“In the spring months (1583), when there were several consecutive days
of exquisitely clear weather, | got the impression that the objective was
rather good, but that the images as regards sharpness were not to be
compared with those of middle-sized instruments, and on leaving Vienna
I had formed the opinion that the difficulty of producing so large ob-
jectives had not been quite surmounted, and that the advantage of large
objectives principally consisted in the amount of light through which
much detail would be revealed (though not with the sharpness of mid-
dle-sized instruments), which by a smaller amount of light would quite
escape the eye of the observer.

‘‘ But by my observations in September this opinion was completely
upset. Ihave acknowledged that the Vienna objective as regards the
precision of the images leaves nothing to be desired, and that it was
only from want of taking the state of the air into account that I had
formed my former opinion. I have with advantage, on splendidly clear
200 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

evenings in September, used a power of 1,000 and even of 1,500, and ~
perceived the fine details of planetary disks with admirable sharpness.
The images of bright stars were of perfect regularity, and the central
part of the diffraction disk was so remarkably small that it may be ex- -
pected that the instrument would also be very suited for observing
double stars.”

The almucantar.—This is the name given by Mr. 8. C. Chandler, of
Harvard College Observatory, to an ingenious instrument devised by
him. It consists first of a rectangular basin filled with mereury. In
this mercury is floated a rectangle of metal, which carries a telescope
movable in altitude. The mercury basin can be moved in a horizontal
plane. The vertical transits of stars can be observed over horizontal
threads in the telescope. Such results as have been published show
the work of this instrument to be of surprising accuracy, and it cer-
tainly presents some important theoretical advantages.

Dr. A. Steinheil has given (Ast. Nach. 2606) in a brief form, a paper
on the errors and adjustments of object glasses of two lenses, which
should be studied by all observers who desire to understand the opera-
tion of their telescopes. An abstract of this has been printed in the
Sidereal Messenger. Dr. Steinheil is prepared to furnish sets of objec-
tives each of which has one of the errors named, but is perfect as re-
spects the remaining ones. These should be of value in our physical
laboratories.

Reprold’s posttion-micrometer.—The price of a Repsold micrometer like
that described in the Encyclopedia Britanica, vol. xviI—article micro-
mneter—for a 15-inch telescope, is $1,250. This includes, of course, the
fittings to the telescope which give the bright wire illumination.

Normal clock.—Dr. L. Waldo, Science states, has just completed the
erection of anormal clock at the Yale College Observatory, to be used as
a mean-time standard in the horological work of that institution. The
movement and pendulum are parts of the gravity eseapement clock
built by Richard Bond (No. 367), and which had a phenomenal record
under Mr. Elartnup, at Liverpool, and later under Prof. W. A. Rogers,
of Cambridge. The case, from Dr. Waldo’s designs, is built of cast
iron, with planed back and front, to which are clamped the plate-glass
doors. The entire case rests upon two brick piers, which rise to the
height of the movement, and insure stability to the pendulum suspen-
sion. Thermometers, a barometer, and a cup of calcie chloride are
placed within the case, which can be exhausted to any barometric press-
ure desired by an air-pump attached to its side. The escapement and
are of vibration can be observed and adjusted with the greatest accu:
racy. The clock is erected in the clock-room of the observatory, which
was specially built to secure uniformity of temperature.

Division errors.—Prof. W. A. Rogers has devised a means of deter-
mining the division errors of a meridian circle mechanically without re-
moving the circle from theaxis. Anabstract of his paper has appeared
ASTRONOMY. 901

in the Sidercal Messenger, and the method is to be applied to the Har-
vard College circle. It need not be said that there is hardly any prob-
_Jem in practical astronomy whose solution is more important than this,
and Professor Rogers’s final :esults will be waited for with impatience.
Declinograph.—Dr. Palisa has had a declinograph, on the plan of
Dr. Knorre’s at. Berlin, fitted to the 12-inch Alvan Clark retractor at
Vienna, and he is observing zones with even greater assiduity than
usual. He reports himself as satisfied with the working of the instru-
ment, which gives positions accurate to about 0%.2 and 2’. In a zone
25™ by 20/ 150 stars can be registered. The positions are to be reduced
to 1875.0, and this is chosen as the equinox for all the new Vienna
maps. Each map is to have a catalogue of its stars accompanying it,
which is an excellent addition. Dr. Peters’s catalogue of 60,000 zone
stars would be of great usefulness, if it were available, as a supplement
tohis splendid series of celestial charts.
The price of the instrument is about $150.
Heliometer.—A new 7-inch heliometer is to be made for the Cape Ob-
servatory, for work in charge of Dr. Gill. It wil cost £2,700, and is
being constructed by Messrs. Repsold, of Hamburg.

ASTRONOMICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, ETC.

Mr. Winlock is attempting a very extensive bibliographic task. “It
is the formation of a complete subject-index to every book in the library
of the United States Naval Observatory. The entries are all to be en-
tered in one alphabet. This is an immense work and will require much
time. If special bibliographies of such subjects as Parallax, Photome-
try, ete., could be printed in advance they would be most useful, and
the publication of a minute index to the V. J. 8. der Astr. Gesell. is a
want pressingly felt.

ASTRONOMICAL JOURNALS.

Besides the transactions of learned societies which have astronomy
for one of their objects, we have at present the publications of two so-
cieties which are exclusively devoted to astronomy. These are the
Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, and the Vierteljahrs-
schrift of the German Astronomical Society. Besides these there are
several journals exclusively devoted to astronomy, of which the Astro-
nomische Nachrichten and the Bulletin Astronomique are by far the most
important.

The Monthly Notices are chiefly short papers read at the regular meet-
ings of the society, and abstracts of the larger ones, which are finally
printed in full in the Memoirs. One number per year gives an interest-
ing review of the work of the past twelve months, and a very full ac-
count of the proceedings of British observatories. The Vierteljahrs-
schrift devotes one of its four annual numbers to reports from the direct-
ors of observatories, chiefly in Germany and America, The other three
202 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

numbers are largely devoted to reviews of published work. Some of
these reviews are of the highest order. ‘To quote only recent ones, we
may name Schoenfeld’s review Gi Dreyer’s paper on the constant of pre-
cession, and Auwers’ review of Grant’s Glasgow catalogue.

The German Astronomical Society is also concerned in the publica-
tion of the Astronomische Nachrichten, both directly and through its
member, Professor Krueger, the editor.

The new impulse is plainly evident in the editing of this journal,
which is of the best kind, as will be evident to all its readers and con-
tributors. Nothing passes without scrutiny, and, in a way, the editor
makes himself responsible for the accuracy of the articles printed.

On the theory of editing which is adopted, nothing could be more per-
fect.

Copernicus, which had reached its third year of publication, has lately
been discontinued, to the regret of all interested in the maintainance of
high-class journals. But even before its last number it found a worthy
successor in the Bulletin Astronomique, published by MM. Tisserand,
Radau, Bigourdan, and Callandreau, in Paris. This journal has at once
taken a very high rank. It contains observations, usually such as are
made at French observatories, just as the Astronomische Nachrichten
contains series of observations from all over the world. The Bulletin
also publishes papers on special subjects, but its distinctive feature is
monthly abstracts of other scientific journals, in which the articles cited
are accompanied by very full and complete reviews. In this way the
Bulletin does for France what the Nachrichten and the Vierteljahrsschrift
do for Germany, and what the Monthly Notices does for England. The
same thing was attempted by Science, in this country, but finally aban-
doned—unfortunately. England has, moreover, two special journals,
the Observatory and the Astronomical Register, which cover slightly dif-
ferent fields; Germany has Sirius, and ‘rance has the new journal of
' Flammarion, L’Astronomie. In this country we have had the Sidereal
Messenger of Mitchell, the Astronomical Notices of Bruennow, and the
Astronomical Journal of Gould, all of which are now discontinued.

The Sidereal Messenger, published by Carleton College Observatory,
is our only astronomical journal at this writing.

A new astronomical journal.tj—An astronomical serial, under the
auspices of the Observatory of Paris, will be a welcome addition to
the literature of the science, and may well be expected to occupy a
prominent place on the list of such periodicals.

Admiral Mouchez, in his introductory note, alludes to the great im-
petus which has been lately given in France to the progress of astron-
omy by the establishment or resuscitation of observatories, aided as well
by national funds as by contributions from the municipal authorities

of the places where they are located. In a few years these various ob-
servatories will be completely organized, the personnel consisting in
part of astronomical students who have obtained their acquaintance
with the practical branches of the science in the Observatory of Paris.
The director therefore aims at providing a medium in the bulletin As-
tronomique whereby the work of French astronomers may be speedily
made known, and where at the same time an analysis of the contents
of the principal foreign periodicals, ete., may be available to them.

The Bulletin will thus present two distinct sections: The first will
be composed of observations of current interest, ephemerides of planets
and comets, and memoirs or notices on various questions in theoretical
and practical astronomy. ‘The second will comprise as complete a
résumé as possible of astronomical inteiligence and an analysis of the
principal periodicals and newly-published works. Further, in a sup-
plementary section it is intended to introduce articles on subjects re-
lating to the sciences allied to astronomy, as terrestrial physics, geodesy,
and meteorology, not excluding points of interest in the history of the
science. Contributions from foreign astronomers are invited. (Na-
ture.)

The mathematical magazine conducted under the name of the Analyst
for the past ten years, by Mr. J. E. Hendricks, will, we learn from Sci-
ence, be continued under the editorial charge of Ormond Stone, profes-
sor of astronomy, and William M. Thornton, professor of engineering,
with the title, Annals of Mathematics, Pure and Applied. The numbers
will be issued at intervals of two months, beginning February 1, 1884.
In scope the journal will embrace the development of new and impor-
tant theories of mathematics, pure and applied; the solution of useful
and interesting problems; the history and bibliography of various
branches of mathematics; and critical examinations and reviews of im-
portant treatises and text-books on mathematical subjects. The oflice
of publication will be at the University of Virginia.

MISCELLANEOUS.

The council of the Royal Astronomical Society have awarded the
gold medal this year to Mr. A. A. Common, for his photographs of
celestial bodies. President Stone, in placing the medal in Mr. Com-
mon’s hands, remarked to the society that their council had been less
influenced by originality in the methods adopted than by the great
practical success which has attended the efforts of Mr. Common in this
important field of astronomical research. He began with a 54-inch re-
fracting telescope ten years ago, and from time to time enlarged his fa-
cilities for celestial photography, until in 1879 he was in possession of
a great reflector of 3 feet diameter, whose superior character is well
known in astronomy from its behavior in observing the moons of Mars,
and the fainter satellites of Saturn. Early in 1880 the first attempt
204 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884

was made to photograph the nebula of Orion, resulting in failure; and
it was not until 1883 that his magnificent photograph of the nebula was
secured. This photograph excels all others, and, except in the very
finest details, is far superior to any drawing. A few features can be
seen with a large telescope which are not shown in the plate. Mr. Com-
mon was among the first to obtain a photograph of a comet. His pho-
tographs of Jupiter and Saturn are described as being beautiful, and
he has lately applied himself with success in the direction of obtaining
photographic star-maps. President Stone called attention to the fact
that Mr. Common is an amateur astronomer, and that the records of
their society are rich in the labors of amateur workers. The amateur
who can provide himself with sufficient instrumental means for original
research need fear no professional rivalry, and it is in work of this
class that the most striking advantages in astronomy are to be expected.
(The Nation.)

The address of Prof. C. A. Young, as retiring president of the Am.
Assoc. A.S., at Philadelphia (1884, September 5), on the pending prob-
lems of astronomy is a careful review of the whole field of investigation,
and is full of suggestions as to the directions in which research should
be directed. It has been reprinted in many journals, and most widely
read.

Professor Thibaut, of Benares, to whom we owe already many useful
contributions to Sanskrit scholarship, has submitted to the Asiatic
Society of Calcutta, a paper on the astronomer Varaha Mihira, which is
soon to be published in the Journal of that society. The abstract of
his paper contained in the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society, June, 1884,
informs us that the dependence of Sanskrit astronomy on Greek astron-
omy is now proved beyond contradiction, and a new confirmation has
thus been added to a theory lately propounded by several Sanskrit
scholars, namely, that the so-called classical literature of India is in re-
ality a mere renaissance belonging to the VI century A.D. (Athenceum.)

We are glad to announce the appearance of the fourth fascicule, com-
pleting the second volume of the valuable Bibliographie Générale de
VAstronomie, which is in course of publication by MM. Houzeau and
Lancaster. It will be remembered that the scheme comprehends three
great divisions, each to form a separate volume: (1) astronomical works;
(2) astronomical memoirs and notices contained in serial publications
and academic collections ; (3) astronomical observations and observa-
tories. Of these it has been considered convenient and useful to pre-
pare and publish the second volume first, as it is on matters of more
pressing and general interest than the others. The final part of this
volume, which concludes with an index (occupying two hundred and
thirty pages) of the papers and memoirs contained therein, under the
names of the respective authors, is now before us, and we congratulate
MM. Houzeau and Lancaster on the completion of the portion in ques-
?

tion of their laborious task. On its great utility to astronomers it is
unnecessary to enlarge. (Athenwum.)

We have received from the Bureau des Longitudes their Annuaire
for the present year, which seems thicker and more complete than any
of its predecessors, well worth the money it costs (1s. 3d.) even to the
English reader, on account of the very valuable tables which it contains
touching astronomical and geographical subjects. We notice in the
present edition a very complete table of the different comets, which
alone would make it a necessity in any astronomical establishment.
The semi-popular article published in the Annuaire for this year is
entitled ‘Sur les Grands Fleaux de la Nature”; it is by M. Faye, and
is well worth reading. (Nature.)

By CHARLES G. RockwooD, JR., PH. D.,
Professor of Mathematics in the College of New Jersey, Princeton, N. J.

The following summary for the years 1883 and 1884 cannot pretend
to be complete. Neither the space nor the time at command would al-
low of even the mention of all that has happened or all that has been
done and written in these departments in the two years. The writer has
therefore preferred to make somewhat more full the account of those
things which seemed most deserving of such record, even at the expense
of passing unnoticed many things of interest and mech good work that
has been done, especially in foreign countries, where it is less accessi-
ble to an American writer. For ail else the reader must refer to the
authorities mentioned in the bibliography. The subjects will be treated
in the following order :

Vulcanology :
Voleanie eruptions of 1883 and 1884.
Investigations of former volcanic activity.
Seismology :
Earthquake lists of 1882 and 1883.
Special earthquakes of 1883 and 1884.
Lists of former earthquakes.
Theories of earthquakes.
Seismometry :
Instruments and their records.

VULCANOLOGY.

In the last days of August, 1883, the Straits of Sunda were the scene
of a catastrophe exceeding in magnitude and destructiveness anything
that has heretofore come within the observation of civilized men. It has
been the subject of numerous publications in the various languages (see
bibliography,) from which the following condensed account is drawn :

The island of Krakatoa lies midway between Java and Sumatra, in
the Strait of Sunda. It was about five miles long by three miles wide,
rising into a triple mountain peak 2,700 feet high, and clothed with veg-
etation from hase to summit. Near it are two small islands, Verlaten

216 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

on the west and Long on the east. It was considered by Junghuhn to
be a continuation of the mountain system on the adjacent west coast of
Java, and probably marks the position of an old fissure extending across
the strait. It was entirely uninhabited, and only occasionally visited by
fishermen from the neighboring coasts. The series of voleanic phenom-
ena of which it was the scene began on May 20, 1883, with an eruption,
the sound of which was heard at Batavia, 100 miles distant, and which
had its seat in the most northern and lowest of the three peaks. Its first
effect was the devastation of Long Island and the expulsion of large
quantities of sand and pumice.

A visit to the island some time later showed the scene of this outbreak
to have a maximum length of about 100 yards, and from it volumes of
vapor and pumice dust were still rising, although as late as August
11th, trees were still growing on the main peak, which, indeed, was not
active at any time in 1883.

The volcanic activity continued during June and July, extending in
August to the second peak, and reaching a maximum on August 27; after
that diminishing, but continuing for several days thereafter. The fore-
noon of the 27th was marked by a series of explosions, apparently due
to the admission of the sea to the crater by the falling in of its north-
ern walls. By the greatest of these explosions, occurring about 10 A.M.,
the whole northern part of the island, probably reduced to a shell by
the previous eruptions, and including half of the main peak, was appar-
ently blown into the air to an unknown height, the heavier débris fall-
ing partly upon the remaining portions of Krakatoaand Long and Ver-
laten, which were entirely covered by the deposit; partly into the sea to
the east and northeast, where it formed two new islands, at first of con-
siderable extent but which gradually disappeared by the erosion of the
waves; while the finer dust reached the upper regions of the atmos-
phere and was carried away by the winds, to make its presence evident
around the entire globe, and for many months afterward, in the peculiar
ruddy glow of the sunset skies, which, first noticed in November, 1883,
has not entirely ceased now, in the summer of 1885.

The noise of the explosion was heard over a circle of 30° radius, com- *
prising more than one-fifteenth of the entire surface of the earth, and
in some directions to even greater distances. At the island itself the
greatest changes occurred. Its area had formerly been 334 square kil-
ometers, of which 23 square kilometers have entirely disappeared; and
where there had been a considerable mountain, now the sea has a depth
of over 300 meters. The remnant of the original area was increased to
154 square kilometers by additions on the south and southwest sides,
while the northern side was left a cliff 800 meters high. The extent
of Long and Verlaten was also somewhat increased. Verbeek estimates
the amount of ejected material to have exceeded 18 cubic kilometers.

The ocean wave caused by this convulsion devastated all the adjacent
coasts, bringing death to thousands of the inhabitants, and extending
VULCANOLUGY AND SEISMOLOGY. pin

its influence to the coasts of America, where it was plainly marked on
the tide-gauges in California and Alaska. On Java the whole west
coast was swept by the wave, and the town and light-house of Anjer
were completely destroyed, the wave there reaching a height of over 30
meters. In Lampong Bay, Sumatra, a Government vessel was carried
three miles inland, and the bay was so filled with floating pumice that
for weeks afterward vessels were unable to aproach the site of the
ruined town of Telok Betong, at its head. Up to November 1, 32,635
victims of the catastrophe were counted.

The velocity of this ocean wave in its progress to distant stations
was investigated by several persons. It was propagated most forcibly
toward the Indian Ocean, and was distinctly marked at twelve of the
seventeen Indian tidal stations, as well as at. Port Louis, in Mauritius,
and Port Elizabeth, in South Africa. For the two latter places Maj. A.
W. Baird deduces the velocity of 467 statute miles per hour (Nature,
XXIX, 358), both giving the same result, although the distances are 3,400
and 5,450 miles, respectively. This agrees with Airy’s tabulated value
for an ocean depth of 15,000 feet, which is supposed to be the average
depth in this direction. The velocities in other directions were less,
viz, to Galle, 397 miles; to Negapatam, 355 miles; and to Aden, 371 miles.
Verbeek deduced a velocity of only 306 miles per hour to Port Eliza-
beth and 109 miles to Padang. (Nature, xxx, 10.)

Another and unexpected result of the Krakatoa explosion was the
formation of an immense air wave, which was propagated several times
about the earth in both directions, making its passage known by irregu-
larities in the traces of the recording barometers in numerous meteor-
ological observatories in all parts of the world. It was first recognized
by General Richard Strachey (Nature, xx1x, 181), in a paper presented
to the Royal Society in December, 1883, and later investigations abun-
dantly confirmed his deductions. The wave made the circuit of the
earth in about thirty-six hours, having thus a velocity approximating
that of sound. The wave propagated from east to west had a mean pe-
riod of 36" 57™, that from west to east 35" 17™, the difference being at-
tributed to the motion of the atmosphere. The wave returned to the
same station three or four times, gradually becoming imperceptible.

The far-reaching effects of the Krakatoa explosion have been traced
in still another direction in the peculiar ruddy appearance of the sky at
sunset and atsunrise. This first attracted general attention in America
and [Europe in the latter part of November, 1883. Many causes were
suggested, and much discussion filled the scientific periodicals about
them, but it has been pretty generally accepted that the appearances
were due to the presence in the upper atmosphere of fine dust from
Krakatoa. In support of this view are the facts that distinct evidence
of volcanic dust, similar to that ejected from Krakatoa, has been found
in rain and snow, and that the successive appearances of the red skies
could be traced around the globe as the dust cloud gradually extended
218 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

itself to the westward, under the influence of the prevailing winds. The
appearances continued in greater or less intensity through the year
1884.

The council of the Royal Society (London) appointed a committee for
the purpose of collecting the various accounts of the voleanic eruption
at Krakatoa, and attendant phenomena. Under date of February 12,
1884, the chairman, G. J. Symons, published a letter inviting authenti-
cated communications. (Nature, XXtx, 355; Science, 111, 244.)

Early in 1884 reports were received of the elevation of a new volcanic
island near Bogosloff, one of the Aleutian Islands, but it was not until
August that reliable information was at hand in regard toit. The vol-
eanic activity apparently began early in 1883, and culminated in Octo-
ber, 1583, in a submarine eruption, resulting in the formation of a new
voleanic peak some 450 feet high, which is not a separate island, but is
connected with the north end of Bogosloft by a low sand beach. It was
visited in May, 1884, by Lieut. G. M. Stoney, U. 8. N., and was then still
active (Science, tv, 432). The previous history of Bogosloff has been
given by Dall (Science, 111, 89) and by Davidson (Science, 111, 282).

About the same time that the new peak appeared at Bogosloff, an-
other Alaskan volcano, Mount Saint Augustin, on an island in Cook’s
Inlet, also became active. On the morning of October 6, 1583, an erup-
tion occurred (Science, 111, 187), which caused an earthquake wave 25 to
30 feet high at Port Graham, and was at first reported to have split the
mountain in two from peak to base. It was also said that the northern
half had sunk away to the level of the cliff. Later accounts, however
(Science, 111, 798), state that the reports were much exaggerated. The
west side of the summit has fallen in, forming a new crater, but the
mountain was not split and no waves of importance were observed.
The voleano was, however, still active in November, 1884. (Science, Iv,
474.)

On July 26, 1884, the light-house keeper at Cape Reykjanes, the south-

west point of Iceland, saw what was supposed to be a new voleanie is-
land in the sea, tothe westward. But after having been the subject of
various communications in the public press (Nature, Xxx1, 37; Science,
Iv, 506), the reports of a new island were at last proved to be founded
on a mistaken observation of a well-known island not usually visible
from the mainland. No new island could be found. (Nature, xxxt,
149.)
Lieutenant Wohlgemuth, the leader of the Austrian polar expedi-
tion, found traces of still progressing volcanic activity in the island of
Jan Mayen, and three times, while there, observed well-marked subter-
ranean shocks. (Nature, XX1x, 246.)

In a monograph upon the voleano El Mayon, in the island of Luzon,
read before the Seismological Society of Japan, Don E. Abella y Casa-
riego has given a résumé of former eruptions, especially those of 1766,
1814, 1834, 1845, 1853, 1871, 1875, and 1881; and has discussed the hy-
VULCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY. 219

drography, orography, and geology of the mountain. (Trans. S. S. of
Japan, V, 19.)

Capt. C. E. Dutton, U.S. A., describes (Am. Jour. Sci., XXV, 219) his
observations during an extended examination of the voleanoes of the
Hawaiian Islands. He visited the crater of Kilauea, watching the
action of the lava in the lakes, and reaching the conclusion that it has
no connection with Mauna Loa. At the latter the results of the great
eruption of 1880-81 were particularly examined. The largest lava
stream from this eruption was 50 miles long and varied in width from
half a mile to 2 miles. Comparing Mauna Kea with Mauna Loa, a
difference in the character of the lavas is noted, and also their abun-
dance of fragmental products on the former contrasted with the notable
absence on the latter. The other voleanoes of Hawaii, as also those on
Maui and Oahu, were visited, and abundant evidences of recent eleva-
tion were found, with marked traces also of subsidence in some por-
tions.

Messrs. Hague and Iddings, of the United States Geological Survey,
have given (4m. Jour. Sci., XX VI, 222) some results of a reconnaissance
of several of the extinct volcanic cones of Northern California, Oregon,
and Washington Territory, made in 1870, but not hitherto published.
The localities described are Lassen’s Peak, Mount Rainier, Mount Hood,
and Mount Shasta, and the article is mostly occupied with the litholog-
ical and chemical discussion of the rock specimens brought from these
mountains. These four cones present many close resemblances in the
character of their rocks. They are all andesite volcanoes, with extru-
sions of basalt breaking out upon their slopes and along the edges of
the plain, extending in all directions for long distances.

SEISMOLOGY.

The eighteenth annual report of Dr. C. W. C. Fuchs describes the
volcanic and seismic phenomena of the year 1882, mentioning an un-
important eruption of Vesuvius in January and February, the slight
activity of Etna and Stromboli during the spring months, and a little-
known eruption of Chiriqui, in Central America, in September.

The catalogue of earthquakes includes 217 items, classified in time as
follows: Winter, 73: December, 19; January, 30; February, 24. Spring,
56: March, 34; April, 12; May, 10. Summer, 35: June, 5; July, 20;
August, 10. Autumn, 53: September, 13; October, 28; November,
12.

Additions to his previous reports are given, numbering, for 1879, 37
items; for 1880, 56 items; for 1881, 114 items. (Min. wu. petr. Mitth.,
1883.)

The only earthquake of importance in 1882, as reported by Dr. Fuchs,
accompanied the eruption of Chifiqui, and extended throughout the
Isthmus of Panama and the adjacent portions of Central America and
the northern coast of South America. It oceurred at 3" 15™ on the

The nineteenth report of Dr. Fuchs contdate an account of the vol-
canic eruptions and earthquakes of 1883. (Min. u. petr. Mitth., 1884.)
Moderate eruptions of Etna during March and April are noted) and
others during the year, from Vesuvius and Cotopaxi, and also in Ice-
land, Nicaragua, Colombia, and Alaska; but by far the most important
outbreak was the great eruption of Krakatoa, already noticed here.

The record of earthquakes contains 265 items, distributed by seasons
as follows: Winter, 56: December, 21; January, 21; February, 14.
Spring, 66: March, 22; April, 20; May, 24. Summer, 68: June, 20;
July, 29; August, 19. Autumn, 73: September, 29; October, 30; No-
vember, 31. The only one of importance was that in Ischia on July 28,
1883.

In his twelfth “Notes on American Earthquakes” (Am. Jour. Sci.,
xxv, 353) C. G. Rockwood, jr., gives the record for 1882. It includes
72 items, classified geographically as follows: Canada,6; New En-
gland, 5; Atlantic States, 6; Mississippi Valley,11; Pacific coast, 19;
Mexico and Central America, 18; West Indies, 5; Peru,1. They may
be classified by seasons thus: Winter, 11: December, 5; January, 3;
February, 3. Spring, 18: March, 8; April,6; May, 4. Swmmer, 14:
June, 2; July, 6; August, 6. ae, 29: September, 7; October, 16;
November, 6.

The only earthquake which caused any damage was that of Septem-
ber 7, 1882, on the Isthmus of Panama. Others of local interest in the
United States occurred on September 7, October 22, and November 7.
Thirty-six items are added to the records for the years 1879-’81, all re-
ferring to the Central American region.

In his thirteenth “Notes” (Am. Jour. Sci., Xxxvu, 358) the record
for 1883 is given.

There are 76 shocks noted, distributed geographically as follows:
Canada, 8; New England, 3; Atlantic States, 2; Mississippi Valley,
11; Pacific coast, 23; Mexico,1; West Indies, 4; Central America, 14;
Peru and Chili, 10. By seasons they may be classified thus: Winter,
16: December, 4; January, 7; February, 5. Spring, 20: March, 9;
April,3; May,8. Summer,18: June, 3; July,7; August, 8. Autumn,
22: September, 8; October, 9; November, 5.

Nearly all were but of moderate importance. The only ones meriting
individual mention were: January 11, in Southern Ilinois and adjacent
portions of Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee; March 8, on the Isth-
mus of Panama and in the States of Colombia, in which churches and
other buildings were injured; May 19, in Ecuador, overthrowing houses
in Latacunga; October 6, at Mount Saint Augustin, in Alaska.

In summarizing his lists for the twelve years 1872~83, Professor
Rockwood finds that of the 364 earthquakes which are recorded for the
United States and Canada, 151 occurred on the Pacific slope, 66 in the
VULCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY. 221

Mississippi Valley, and 147 on the Atlantic slope, giving an average
frequency of about one every twelve days for the whole region, and
once a month for the Atlantic slope. (Science, IV, 569.)

On July 28, 1883, portions of the island of Ischia were devastated by
a severe earthquake, which has given rise to a considerable amount of
literature. The following account is condensed from a variety of sources
mentioned in the bibliography:

Ischia contains about 26 square miles, and in the center of the island
rises Mount Epomeo, 792 meters high, an old voleano, which during
historic times has shown its activity only by hot springs and earth-
quakes. The thermal springs, with the pleasant climate, have made
Ischia a favorite summer resort, and during the season the town of Cas-
amicciola is usually crowded with strangers. There had been some pre-
vious indications of unusual subterranean activity—some hot springs
had shown abnormal variations of temperature, some slight earthquakes
were felt, and the instruments in the seismological observatories at
Naples and Rome were in increased motion; but nothing gave any
warning of where the blow would strike. The violent shock came about
9» 25™ p.m. on Saturday, July 28, and the greatest damage was done
at Casamicciola and vicinity. This town, built on two small hills on
the north slope of Epomeo, was entirely destroyed. A performance
was in progress at the theater, and when the building collapsed at the
shock many persons were buried in the ruins. Lacco Ameno, on the
coast northwest of Casamicciola, was also mostly destroyed, and Forio
was much damaged. The town of Ischia, on the east coast, was severely
shaken, without suffering serious harm. But the villages of Fontana
and Serrara, situated in the interior of the island, and indeed within
the old crater, were great sufferers, as was also Barano. Two large land-
slips were caused on the north slope of Epomeo, but no true fissures
were found anywhere and no apparent changes of level. The num-
ber of casualties in the island, as stated by the official commission of
the Italian Government, was 2,313 killed and 762 wounded. In Casa-
micciola there were before the shock 672 dwellings and 4,300 inhabi-
tants, of which 537 dwellings were destroyed entirely and 1,784 people
were killed.

In investigating the origin of this earthquake, L. Baldacci (Boll. del
R. Com. Geol. d’Italia, tv, 157) traces two lines of hot springs, one east
and west, the other north-northwest to south-southeast, which he re-
gards as indicating the position of old cleavage lines intersecting at Casa-
micciola, and to which he attributes this earthquake. H. J. Johnston-
Lavis (Nature, xxvitl, 437) has drawn isoseismals about the focus,
finding them to be elongated ellipses whose minor axes are nearly in
the line of the north and south fissure just mentioned, and concludes
that they indicate a plate-shaped focus, whose strike extends in a line
from Fontana to near the beach at Laceco. ©. G. Rockwood finds the
cause in arupture taking place along an old voleanic fissure directed

roughly north and south and extending radially in or under the northern
slope of Epomeo. (Am. Jour. Sci., xxv1, 475.) Palmieri attributes it to
the collapse of subterranean cavities, probably caused by the abstrac-
tion of matter carried away in solution by the hot springs. Fuchs says
(Min. u. petr. Mitth., 1884, 185) it was neither volcanic nor a collapse
of acavity, but only a rearrangement of the materials of the hill taking
place at a moderate depth.

On August 10, 1884, between seven and eight minutes after 2 P. M.,
a decided earthquake occurred in the Middle and Eastern States, a brief
preliminary notice of which was given by the writer. (Am. Jour. Sci.,
XXVIII, 242.) It extended along the coast from Baltimore, Md., to Port-
land, Me., and westward to the Alleghanies. ‘The origin was evidently
not far from New York City. The shock was more violent than any
which had been felt in that region for a considerable time.

Part second of the seventh volume (1884) of the Transactions of the
Seismological Society of Japan is occupied by John Milne in the dis-
cussion of 387 earthquakes observed in North Japan from October,
1881, to October, 1883. It is accompanied by 123 maps of the areas
affected by single earthquakes, and one general map shaded to repre-
sent the distribution of volcanic and seismic activity in Japan, and also
15 pages containing 66 figures of the tracings made by various record-
ing instruments. As results of the discussion the author finds that 84
per cent. of the earthquakes originated under the ocean or on the eastern
seaboard; that the winter intensity is nearly three and a half times as
great as the summer intensity; that there is a general coincidence be-
tween the maximum of earthquakes and the minimum of temperature;
and that there were 11.2 per cent. more earthquakes at low water than
at high water. Sixteen of the earthquakes occurred simultaneously in
separated areas, not being felt in the intervening districts. He also
finds that the indications of exactly similar instruments may vary con-
siderably at stations only a few bundred feet apart. Whence he concludes
that the amplitude and period of the vibration constituting an earth-
quake are very largely dependent on the character of the soil and other
local circumstances, and that therefore the direction of vibration in an
ordinary earthquake has usually no immediate relation to its direction
of propagation.

Thomas H. Streets, M. D., U. S. N., gives (Am. Jour. Sci., XXv, 361)
a list of earthquakes compiled from the weather statistics kept at the
United States naval hospital at Yokohama, Japan. It includes all
shocks, appreciable without instruments, that occurred in a period of
four years beginning with 1878. They numbered 124, and, classified by
seasons, were: Winter, 41; spring, 35; summer, 27; autumn, 21; show-
ing a greater frequency in winter than in summer, as has been given
by other lists. If March be substituted for December as a winter month,
the contrast is still more striking, as we then find 51, or 41 per cent. of
the whole number, occurring in those three months. February and

Mareh appear to be the months of greatest earthquake activity. A
period of earthquake calm is found in August and September, coinci-
dent with the period of greatest cyclonic activity.

Prof. J. P. O'Reilly, of Dublin, has prepared an earthquake map of the
British Islands. (Trans. Roy. Ir. Acad., XXVUl, 285.) It is based upon
a catalogue of 55 earthquakes felt in historical times up to 1880, of
which 8 occurred previous to the year 1700. These are rearranged
and recatalogued with respect to localities and frequency, and the map
is Shaded accordingly. The most deeply shaded portions, indicating
the greatest frequency, are found in Southern Scotland and in the neigh-
borhood of Bristol Channel, and generally the map shows much more
earthquake action in Great Britain than in Ireland; whence the author
infers the existence of some barrier, such as great lines of faulting be-
neath the sea, which prevents the extension of seismic action to the
adjacent island. He does not, however, allude to what is certainly the
fact, that the probability of any slight earthquake passing unreported
would be much greater in Ireland than in Scotland or England. The
relationship of the areas marked by frequency of earthquakes to the
great coast line directions, described in previous papers by this author,
is discussed, and also the relation between the coal areas (which are
marked on the map) and the earthquake areas; and the suggestion
is made thatif a similarinvestigation of European earthquakes on which
he is engaged should confirm the indications of the map of England
that coal areas are also earthquake areas, then the earthquake map
might be an important aid in the search for concealed beds of coal.

In a memoir on the earthquakes of July, 1880, in the island of Luzon
(Trans. Seis. Soc. of Jap., V, 43), Don J. Centano y Garcia dissents from
the conclusions of Father Faura, previously published, which placed the
seismic center in an extinct volcano situated between Lepanto and Ben-
guet, in the central mountain chain of Luzon. After an extended de-
scription of the effects produced by the earthquake, mostly based upon
his own observation, he reaches the following conclusions: All the
series of earthquakes from the 14th to the 25th of July, 1880, can be di-
vided into three classes, corresponding to the 14th, 18th, and 20th days.
The intensity curves for each of these periods, as drawn on the author’s
map, indicate that the seismic center was in the southern part of the
island, near the lake called La Laguna, southeast of Manila, the curves
of maximum intensity for the first two periods including the region
just east of this lake, and for the third period its western shore.

In an article on Earthquake Disturbances of the Tides on the Coasts
of India (Nature, Xxtx, 358), we find some results reached by Maj. M.
W. Rogers in a discussion of the earthquake waves which appeared in
the Bay of Bengal on December 31, 1881. The probable position of the
center of impulse was beneath the waters of the western part of the Bay
of Bengal, and the velocities deduced for the sea wave were: To Port
Blair, in the Andamans, 360 miles an hour; to Madras and Negapatam,
i ' BH ge en ha Ge lg yn

240 miles; to False Point, 180 miles; and to Dublat, at the mouth of the
Hooghly, 120 miles. The average depth of the sea is known to dimin-
ish in every instance of diminished velocity, and in all these cases the
crest of a positive wave preceded the trough or negative wave.

At the Minneapolis meeting of the American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science (Proc. A. A. A. S., 1883, XXXII, 253), Richard Owen
discussed the grand lines of orographie development of the continental
masses, and their relations to voleanic and seismic regions. He showed
that a series of mountain chains, in several parallel ranges, extends
nearly east and west from the land center in Switzerland to the equator
at Quito and Sumatra, and that active volcanoes are often found in
this stony girdle, while seismic activity is more often displayed within
areas inclosed by the great orographic links of this chain.

G. K. Gilbert offers (Am. Jour. Sci., Xxvu, 49) a theory to account
for the earthquakes of the Great Basin. The elevation of mountain
chains being gradual, results in a slowly increasing strain upon the ad-
jacent strata, which strain is from time to time relieved by the forma-
tion of faults at the foot of the range. This fault formation constitutes
an earthquake shock; and the tension of the strata having been thus
relieved, a longer or shorter period of quiescence will follow, until the
tension again accumulates to the point of fracture. Applying these
principles to the particular case, it is noted that fault scarps are found
along the western base of the Wasatch Range and along the eastern
base of the Sierra Nevada, one of the latter having been formed by
the Owens Valley earthquake, which caused so much damage in 1872.
But the fault scarp of the Wasatch is notably interrupted from Warm
Springs to Emigration Cafion, near Salt Lake City, whence the infer-
ence is drawn that the strain of the rising mountains has not there been
relieved in recent time, and consequently the inhabitants of that city
may anticipate the occurrence of an earthquake shock to relieve this
tension, which will be more severe the longer it is delayed.

In the first part of Das Antlitz der Erde (Leipzig, 1883) Edward
Suess has discussed, in connection with other matters, both earthquakes
and volcanoes. Having in the second chapter described several regions
which are subject to earthquakes, as the Northeastern Alps, Southern
Italy, Central America, and the west coast of South America, in the
third chapter he discusses the general topic of dislocations and the
strains which cause them, and in the fifth the different classes of earth-
quakes and their relation to more extensive movements of the crust.
The fourth chapter is devoted to volcanoes, tracing the different stages
in the life history of an eruptive mountain, as illustrated in the phenom-
ena of the present day, from those which have broken forth within
historical time and are still continuously active, through the succession
of less and less active cones, to those which have not only been long
extinct, but have been reduced to ruins by the processes of erosion, and
finally to those masses of eruptive matter which never reached the sur-
VULCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY. 225

face at allin a fluid condition, but have made their presence known
only by the altered condition of the overlying strata.

On the theory that the motive power of volcanoes and earthquakes
is due to the vapor of water, it becomes necessary to explain how water
can be suddenly brought in contact with the heated portions of the in-
terior of the earth in sufficient quantities to generate the explosive force
called for by the phenomena. To meet this difficulty S. Meunier (La
Nature, 1884. 1, 379) assumes the crust to be thicker under the oceans
than under the land, and suggests that at the edges of the thicker parts,
that is, at the coast lines, masses may, by their own weight or by ex-
ternal strains, be cracked off from the solid crust, and may thus sud-
denly open a rapid communication between the included water of the
upper strata and the zone of dissociation by heat below.

Under the name of Earth Pulsations, Prof. John Milne, of Tokio (Na-
ture, XXVIII, 367), treats of movements of the soil which escape our notice
on account of the slowness of their period. Showing that increase of
atmospheric pressure or the rise of the tide would so change the load
resting on the surface as to make such motions probable, he cites the
increased activity of all microseismic apparatus, and the increased flow
of gas from the pores of a coal seam attendant on the fall of the baro-
metric column, as indications pointing in the direction of increased in-
ternal activity. Observation both in Italy and in Japan also shows
that the position of rest of a suspended pendulum is not invariable, the
variation from normal position being too great and too uniform to be
attributed to accidental causes. Other illustrations are drawn from
motions of the waters in English lakes at the time of the great Lisbon
earthquake, and from the motions not infrequently reported of the del-
icate levels of astronomical observatories, which have not been ac-
companied by sensible movements of the ground. The same writer also
discusses (Nature, xxtx, 290) the effect of earthquakes on buildings,
and the kind of buildings best adapted to escape injury therefrom.
Two plans are suggested: either to make the buildings strong and bind
them together with iron rods, so as to resist the strains which occur,
or to employ frame buildings comparable in structure to a wicker basket,
which may yield without being overthrown. The use of heavy brick
chimneys joined to wooden houses is especially condemned as danger-
ous.

The authorities of the University of Tokio have instructed one of
their officers to devote himself wholly to the study of seismic phenom-
ena. The person thus appointed is Mr. Sekiya, the Japanese secre-
tary of the Seismological Society of Japan.

In November, 1884, a conference to formulate plans for the systematic
observation and discussion of earthquakes in the United States was
held in the rooms of the Geological Survey at Washington. There were
present Messrs. J. W. Powell, C. EK. Dutton, and G. K. Gilbert, of the
Survey; C.Abbe and C. F. Marvin, of tbe Signal Service; H. M. Paul, of

S. Mis. 33——15
226 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

the Naval Observatory; C. G. Rockwood, jr., of Princeton; and W. M.
Davis, of Harvard College. Plans were arranged looking to the pro.
curing of more accurate non-instrumental observations, and to the ulti-
mate establishment of such instrumental observations as might be
found practicable. To this end subcommittees of those present were
appointed to consider the selection of instruments and the location of
stations, &c., which committees are expected to report at a subsequent
meeting of the conference.

At the Montreal meeting of the British Association, in August, 1884,
a grant of £75 was made for the investigation of earthquake phenom-
ena in Japan, and £25 for volcanic phenomena at Vesuvius. (Science,
IV, 263.)

SEISMOMETRY.

An underground observatory has been established by Professor Milne
at Takashima, near Nagasaki, in a coal mine whose workings extend
beneath the island and the sea and have a total length of about 70
miles. It is proposed to carry on observations of the motions of the
soil by means of microphones placed in the solid rock, by instruments
to measure the ‘earth tremors,” and by delicate levels, together with
barometric and thermometric observations and observations of the es-
cape of fire-damp, with the hope of determining whether any of these
phenomena are connected with one another.

In seismometry properthe most important work is amemoir on Earth-
quake Measurement by J. A. Ewing, published as No. 9 of the Me-
moirs of the Science Department of the University of Tokio. It con-
sists of seven chapters, with twenty-four plates, of which fourteen re-
late to the instruments and ten are copies of the records made by them.

The first chapter is devoted to a concise statement of the theory of
earthquake motion; the difference between the normal and transverse
vibrations, both being usually present ; the greater velocity of the for-
mer, by which the two kinds of vibrations arising from the same shock
become separated at a distance from their source; the effect of reflec-
tion and refraction at the bounding surfaces of the media traversed; -
the want of agreement between the direction of the wave within the
ground and the motion impressed upon a particle at the surface; that
is, in general, to the peculiarities of the phenomena to be observed.

In the second chapter, after theoretically determining the kinetic and
static conditions to be fulfilled by the steady point of a seismometer,
the author applies them to the horizontal pendulum, describing in detail
the seismometer based upon it, and the improvements introduced by
himself and others. The instrument consists essentially of a heavy
mass pivoted through its center of inertia to one side of a light frame,
which itself is so supported as to admit of motion with little friction
about a vertical axis parallel to the line of support of the bob. The
magnified record is made by a pointer attached to the frame and tracing
VULCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY. 227

upon a moving smoked-glass plate. The proportions of the frame and
pointer are such that the line of attachment of the bob is the center of
percussion with respect to the vertical axis of support of the frame.
Most of the important graphic records obtained in Japan have been
made with some modification of this instrument. In its improved form
the frame is made triangular and the bob is a truncated cone of cast-
iron. Gray’s conical pendulum, in which the upper pivot is replaced
by an elastic wire, is also described, and a modification is suggested by
which the lower pivot also may be dispensed with in a similar way.

The third chapter describes and discusses several previously used
seismographs dependent on rolling spheres or cylinders, and various
forms of pendulums making their records either directly or through the
intervention of multiplying levers, and especially the author’s *“‘ duplex”
pendulum, which combines an ordinary with an inverted pendulum, so
as to make the equilibrium of the system neutral.

The fourth chapter is devoted to instruments for recording vertical
movement, which have already been described elsewhere.

The fifth chapter gives the results of instrumental observations in the
case of nine earthquakes, selected from a much larger number recorded
in Japan between 1880 and 1883, accompanied by fac-similes of the trac-
ings made by various instruments, and a discussion of them.

The sixth chapter describes a number of miscellaneous instruments
and methods of observation, none of which are new; while the seventh
contains a brief statement of the author’s results from a comparison of
the records obtained with different instruments. He concludes that
the only seismometers of value are those “ which aim at giving a steady
point or line during the disturbance.”

In a paper read before the Seismological Society of Japan (Trans. of
S. 8. of Japan, V1, 22), C. D. West suggests a new type of seismograph,
which is also described in an appendix to Ewing’s memoir. It consists
of a heavy weight supported by a system of links similar to those used
in the Richards indicator to secure rectilinear motion. A weight so sup-
ported would be free to move ina horizontal line through a considerable
amplitude without losing its astatic properties.

In the Journal of the German Geological Society (vol. XXXVI, 29),
G. R. Lepsius describes a modification of Cacciatore’s seismometer, in
which the fluted dish is replaced by a watch-glass containing mercury,
supported on the elevated central part of a porcelain dish whose outer
part forms a ring of sixteen deep hollows, into some one of which the
spilled mercury must fall. The whole apparatus has a diameter of
191™™ and a height of 60™™.

Several forms of recording apparatus for earthquakes were suggested
by Johnston-Lavis. (Nature, xxx, 609.) For the steady point in the
registers of the horizontal component a pendulum was usually employed,
and the direction and amount of its motion relative to the rest of the
apparatus were recorded (a) by the pendulum pulling upon a cord
228 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

whose other end was attached to a stylus marking upon-a moving
drum; or (b) by making electrical contact in some one of a number of
circuits arranged radially about the normal position of the pendulum, and
thereby causing some one of a series of styles to record on a moving
drum; or, for strong shocks, (c) by the pendulum turning the whole re-
cording apparatus into the azimuth of its motion. Another device em-
ployed as a steady point a disk of lead between parallel glass plates and
resting on spheres of glass or ivory.

For measuring the vertieal component he proposed to use the changes

in the rate of a falling body during the phases of the earth wave, these |

changes being recorded by appropriate apparatus on a moving drum.
These suggestions were later commented on by J. A. Ewing (Nature,
XXXTI, 4), who justly criticised the want of novelty of some of themand
the mechanical difficulties involved in others.

GEOGRAPHY.

By Commander F. M. GREEN, U. S. N.

Among events of general geographical interest which have occurred
during the past year, one of the most important is the meeting of the
International Conference at Washington, in October, 1884, for the pur-
pose of fixing upon a meridian to be employed as a common zero of
longitude and standard of time-reckoning throughout the world.

This conference assembled by invitation of the President of the United
States, in accordance with an act of Congress passed in 1882, delegates
from the following countries taking part in it:

Austria-Hungary, Brazil, Chili, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark,
France, Germany, Great Britain, Guatemala, Hawaii, Italy, Japan, Li-
beria, Mexico, Netherlands, Paraguay, Russia, Santo Domingo, Salva-
dor, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United States, and Venezu-
ela.

After several consultations, the conference agreed unanimously that
a Single prime meridian is desirable, and, with only the delegates from
France and Brazil dissenting, agreed to recommend to their respective
Governments the adoption of the meridian passing through the center
of the transit instrument at the Greenwich Observatory as the initial
meridian of longitude, and also voted to recommend that from this
meridian longitude shall be counted in two directions up to 180°; east
longitude being plus, and west longitude minus.

Resolutions were also adopted in favor of adopting a universal day,
to be a mean solar day, beginning for all the world at the moment of
mean midnight of the initial meridian, and to be counted from zero to
twenty-four hours.

An extensive chain of longitude measurements has been completed
recently by the labors of the United States naval officers under command
pf Lieut. Commander C. H. Davis, U.S. N., in measuring from Panama
down the west coast of South America to Valparaiso. The results of
these measurements afford a remarkable proof of the accuracy of com-
bined astronomical and geodetic observations at the present day, and
are especially worthy of notice as being entirely homogeneous; that is,
they are everywhere founded upon telegraphic comparisons of time-
pieces of which the errors on local time were determined, on the same

237

nights that the comparisons were made, by carefully observed transits
of standard stars. This chain consists of the transatlantic longitude
measurements of the United States Coast Survey from Greenwich to
Washington; a Coast Survey measurement from Washington to Key
West; a measurement from Key West to Panama, by way of Havana
and Jamaica, by officers of the United States Navy, in 1874 and 1875;
from Panama to Valparaiso, as mentioned above; from Valparaiso to”
Buenos Ayres, by way of Cordova, under direction of Dr. B. A. Gould;
and from Buenos Ayres to Greenwich, by way of Rio de Janeiro,
Madeira, and Lisbon, by officers of the United States Navy, tn 1878 and
1879. In closing this immense chain of twenty links or connected
measurements, the entire discrepancy amounted to eighteen one-hun-
dredths of a second of time.
The longitude of the Observatory of Cordova was found to be:

NORTH AMERICA.

Among the scientific investigations and the geodetic, geographic, and
hydrographic work which marked the progress of the United States
Coast and Geodetic Survey during the past year, the following opera-
tions deserve special mention.

In order to complete the connection of the American and European
initial gravity stations the observations needed were made at the Kew
and Geneva Observatories.

A valuable series of comparative observations for gravity was com-
pleted at Washington with the Kater pendulums. These pendulums, of
historic importance in connection with determinations of gravity in
England and India, were swung at the station in the Smithsonian In-
stitution, where they had been previously swung by an officer of the
Royal Engineers.

The work of tracing out and marking the boundary line between
Pennsylvania and West Virginia for the joint commission of these two
States was completed; the resurveys of Long Island Sound and of
Delaware Bay were advanced toward completion, also the topograph-
ical survey of the District of Columbia, for the Commissioners of the
District; lines of level of precision were begun to connect the tidal
levels of Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico with the transcon-
tinental line of geodesic leveling; progress was made in the primary
triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel for connecting the triangula-
tion of the Atlantic coast with that of the Pacific; and trigonometrical
surveys were continued in nine States which made requisite provision
for their own topographical and geological surveys.

Developments of much importance to the interests of commerce and
navigation were made during the year; dangerous shoals and ledges
GEOGRAPHY. 239

having been discovered in some of the leading highways of commerce,
among others in Monomoy Passage, Fisher’s Island Sound, and the East
River, New York. Immediate information of these dangers was given
by the publication of “ Notices to Mariners.”

In pursuance of its plan for making a geographical map of the
United States, topographic work has been pushed forward rapidly by
the United States Geological Survey during the year in many different
localities. In the State of Massachusetts work was commenced, in co-
operation with the State authorities, under an arrangement by which
the State agreed to pay one-half the expense, making therefor an appro.
priation of $40,000. Primary and secondary locations being furnished by
the United States Coast Survey and the Borden survey, there remained
in this State only the topography proper to be done, the estimated cost
of which is $10 per square mile. Four parties were engaged upon this
work through August, September, October, and November. An area of
about 850 square miles was surveyed, the scale of the field-sheets being
J: 30000, with a view to publication on a scale of 1 : 62500, or about 1
mile to an inch.

In the Southern Appalachian region there were six topographic par-
ties in the field, two of which were fitted out for carrying on triangula-
tion as well, while the triangulation for the remaining parties was sup-
plied by a special triangulation party. The triangulation is in this re-
gion based upon the Appalachian and transcontinental belts of the
Coast and Geodetic Survey. The topographic parties were dispersed
over the area in question, from Mason and Dixon’s line southwestward
into Alabama. An area of about 18,000 square miles was surveyed in
the States of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee,
North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. This work has been done with
a view to publication on a scale of 1: 125000.

In Southwestern Missouri and Southeastern Kansas an area of about
14,000 square miles was surveyed, comprising the lead and zine regions
of these States. The work was done with a view to publication on a
scale of 1: 125000.

A commencement was made in the State of Texas. A base line was
measured near Austin, from which triangulation was extended over
several of the neighboring counties. An area of about 4,000 square
miles of topography was covered, with a view to publication on a scale
of 1: 125000.

In Northwestern Arizona, Southeastern Utah, and Southern Nevada
several detached areas were surveyed, aggregating about 12,000 square
miles. This work was done with a view to publication upon a scale of
1: 250000. Besides this, a detailed map was made of the region includ-
ing the San Francisco Mountains, upon a scale of 1: 62500, or about 1
mile to an inch. During the season the triangulation in this section
was extended so as to form a connection between the work done by the
old organizations known as the Poweil, Hayden, and Wheeler Surveys.
240 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

Work upon a detailed *map on a scal3 of 1: 62500, of the Yellow.
stone Park was carried forward during the season, so that at its close
nearly all that part of the park lying west of the Yellowstone River has
been mapped upon this scale, while the triangulation from the Boze-
man base has been extended until a connection has been formed with
that of the old Hayden survey coming up from the south.

The season in Northern California proved to be unusually favorable to
topographic work, and the single party which was engaged upon gen-
eral work, on a scale of 1:250000, made rapid progress. A second
party was engaged during the season in making a detailed map of Mount
Shasta and its immediate surroundings, the scale of the field-sheets
being 1: 20000.

Besides the work detailed above, a number of special mining maps,
upon large scales, have been made during the past year.

The total area surveyed during the past season, upon all scales, is
about 54,000 square miles, which has been done at an average cost of
about $3 per square mile.

Bulletin No. 5 of the United States Geological Survey is a valuable
dictionary of altitudes in the United States, compiled and arranged by
Henry Gannett, esq., chief geographer of the Survey. The States and
stations are alphabetically arranged, the number of altitudes given being
about 18,000, referred to mean tide-level as the datum point.

Lieut. G. M. Stoney, U.S. N., commanding the Coast Survey schooner
Ounalaska, and Lieutenant Cantwell, of the United States revenue
steamer Corwin, have separately made explorations of the river Kowak
or Kuak, a large river emptying into Hotham Inlet, Kotzebue Sound, on
the western coastof Alaska, nearly under the Arctic Circle. First entered
by officers of Captain Beechey’s expedition in 1826, it was examined
partially and its name was ascertained by officers of Her Majesty’s ship
Plover in 1849. It has been proposed to call this river Putnam River,
after Lieutenant Putnam, U.S. N., lost from the United States steamer
Rodgers, but geographers will probably adhere to the earlier name of
Kowak or Kuak (the big river). The exploring parties traveled a dis-
tance of about 370 miles from the mouth of the river, finding it very
crooked. The river banks are thickly wooded, and the country through
which it runs isrugged and mountainous. Specimens of coal, gold, and
copper were brought away. From the headwaters of one of the affluents
of the Kowak a short portage could be made to the headwaters of an
affiuent of the Yukon, and from the sources of the Kowak it is but a
short distance across the watershed to the waters of the Colville River,
which empties into the Arctic Ocean. It is thought that commercially
the most important result of the expeditions will be the indication of a
route from the Arctic Ocean, available for the crews of ice-bound
whalers, by way of the Colville and Kowak Rivers, to the settlements
onthe Yukon. Lieutenant Stoney, with a light-draught steamboat, will
GEOGRAPHY. 241

continue the exploration of the Kowak River and its branches in the
summer of 1885,

As stated in the Summary for 1883, a careful examination has been
made of Bogosloff Island, in the Aleutian Archipelago, where an active
volcanic disturbance took place in 1883. From the report of Lieut. G.
M. Stoney, U. S. N., by whom the examination was made, it seems that,
while no distinctly new island has appeared, Bogosloft Island (Jonna
Bogoslova, St. John the Theologian) has been extended, the old voleano
being supplemented by another, which is still active, and that where
there was formerly deep water there is now land 300 feet high. On the
29th of May, 1884, Lieutenant Stoney, in the Coast Survey schooner
Ounalaska, anchored close to the still smoking volcano and devoted
three days to its examination. What had been reported as a new island
was found to be a new formation, connected with the old island by a
sand spit. The whole mass of volcanic rock was found to be constantly
vibrating, and a thermometer inserted an inch and a half below the
crust showed 250° F. (its limit) in a few seconds. A compass taken on
shore indicated the presence of iron by marked local action. Though
one of the party reached the summit of the crater, no estimate of its
size or depth could be made, probably owing to the volumes of sulphur-
ous smoke which poured out. By repeated measurements the altitude
of its summit was found to be 357 feet.

The Canadian Government is naturally desirous to find a convenient
outlet by way of [udson’s Bay for the great grain products of its north-
western territory, and with that end in view sent during the summer
of 1854 an expedition in the steamer Neptune, under command of Lieut.
A. R. Gordon, R. N., to establish six observation stations on the shores
of Hudson’s Bay and Straits, from the records of which an accurate judg-
ment may be formed as to the length of the season during which the
west shore of Hudsoun’s Bay is accessible to steamers. Lieutenant Gor-
don, in reporting the establishment of the stations, argues that the
stations should be continued for two or three years. They will be vis-
ited and supplies furnished as soon as navigation opens in 1885. The
average of many years observations at Fort Churchill, a Hudson’s Bay
Company’s post, and the only known harbor on the west coast of the
bay, indicates that the coast cannot be approached before the middle
of June, nor after the middle of November.

Considerable interest has been excited by an intimation from Sir J. H.
Lefroy, in his address before the geographical section of the British
Association at Montreal, that a lake “ rivaling Lake Ontario, if not Lake
Superior, in magnitude” had recently been discovered in the northeast
territory of the Dominion of Canada.

In an admirable article in Science for January 2, 1885, Prof. J. D. Whit-
ney shows that Lake Mistassini, the so-called new lake in question, has
been known for more than two hundred years, although knowledge of
its eastern side is yet indefinite both as to form and position, and

S. Mis. 33——16
242 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

concludes, from all available evidence, that while it is possible that
Lake Mistassini is larger than Lake Ontario, it is extremely improbable.
The inference drawn by Sir J. H. Lefroy as to the size of the lake in
question cannot be justified by any statement in the paper communi-
cated to the section by the Rev. Abbé Laflamme regarding it. - Explora-
tions are now in progress to determine its actual extent and configu-
ration. In a paper read before the annual meeting of the Quebec Geo-
graphical Society, Mr. Bignell, a land surveyor, gave an account of the
country surrounding Lake Mistassini, and stated that he had explored
the lake for 120 miles without reaching the main body of water. He
expressed the opinion that the lake would be found to be an expansion
of Rupert River, as the great American lakes are of the Saint Lawrence.

Mr. R. G. Haliburton (Journal of Royal Geographical Society, Jan-
uary, 1885) argues very plausibly and effectively in favor of placing
‘‘ Vinland the Good,” discovered by Eric the Red in A. D. 994, in New-
foundland instead of Rhode Island. Mr. Haliburton points out that the
test commonly relied upon to establish the identity of Vinland and Rhode
Island, viz, the latitude consequent on the length of the shortest day
there, has been completely disproved by the Icelandic-English diction-
ary of Vigfasson (Oxford, 1874), which shows that a correct translation
would make the day much shorter than the shortest day experienced in
the latitude of Rhode Island, and would consequently place the latitude
of Vinland farther north.

SOUTH AMERICA.

One of the least known of the Brazilian rivers has been the Xingu,
which was recently explored and mapped by three German travelers,
Dr. Karl von den Steinen, Wilhelm von den Steinen, and Otto Klaus.
These gentlemen left Cuyaba, in the province of Matto Grosso, in May,
1884, and proceeded by land to one of the sources of the Xingu which
they named Batovy, for the president of Matto Grosso. They then, in
July, embarked in canoes, and proceeding down the river, reached the
junction of the Xingu and the Amazon in October, thence going to Para
and Rio de Janeiro. Very many rapids were encountered, and numer-
ous tribes of Indians were met who had never seen a white man and
who use only implements of stone and of bone. The members of the
expedition suffered severely from hunger during the first part of the
trip, living entirely on beans for a month. Large quantities of India
rubber trees were found, but the numerous rapids in the Xingu preclude
the use of the river as a commercial route.

M. Emile Thouar, who is known from his journey up the Pileomayo
River in search of the unfortunate Crevaux expedition, has undertaken
another journey in the same region. After ascending the Paraguay
River he will devote some.time to the examination of the Pileomayo
delta and to seeking an available trade route from Bolivia by way of
the Paraguay River, and will then carry out the work with which he
GEOGRAPHY. 243

has been charged by the Bolivian Government, viz, the study of the
whole of Bolivia, in company with some engineers and naturalists,
from scientific, industrial, and commercial points of view.

In the Journal of the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society
for November, 1884, is given a sketch of the work of Dr. Paul Guss-
feldt in the Chilian Andes in 1882 and 1883. His explorations were
made in the region surrounding Aconcagua, the position and height of
which were carefully determined as in latitude 32° 39’ south, longitude
69° 59’ west, and its highest peak 22,867 feet above sealevel. His ac-
count of the glaciers of the Andes is very interesting, but cannot well
be condensed. The detailed results of his labors are contained in a
paper communicated to the Berlin Academy of Sciences.

The journey of Lieutenant Bove, of the Italian navy, to Terra del
Fuego, performed at the instance of the Argentine Government, though
frequently referred to in scientific periodicals, does not seem to have
been productive of any specially new information regarding the geog-
raphy of that region.

The first successful attempt to navigate the Rio Negro from its mouth,
on the Atlantic shore of the Argentine Republic, to its source in Lake
Nahuelhualpi, in the heart of the Andes, has been made by Capt. E.
O’Connor, and is described by him in a report published in the Boletin
de la Sociedad Geografica de Madrid. The journey was made in a steamer
as far as the confluence of the Collunecura, but rapids in the Upper
Limay obstruct navigation so much that the journey was thence per-
formed in an open boat. The extreme upper part of the Limay is free
from rapids, but the country surrounding the upper river and lake ap-
pears to be entirely uninhabited: The information gathered will permit
the affluents of the Rio Negro to be mapped with much greater accuracy
than has been possible hitherto.

The enterprising journey of Mr. Everard im Thurn to explore and
ascend Mount Roraima, on the boundary of British Guiana and Vene-
zuela, has been crowned with success, but as yet no precise details have
been published. Ascending the Potaro, an affluent of the Essequibo, as
far as possible, a very toilsome march was made over rugged mountains
to an Indian village on the southern side of Roraima. After resting
here, the ascent was made on December 18, 1884. Mr. im Thurn states
that the scenery on the top was of the most marvelous description, the
plateau being covered with groups of rocks of most extraordinary
shapes. The clouds, which are nearly always resting on the mountain,
constantly precipitate their moisture, forming numerous cascades, the
sources of rivers which, starting from this point, flow to swell the Ori-
noco, Essequibo, and Amazon. Mr. im Thurn determined the height
of the summit from the temperature of the boiling point as 8,600 feet.
He as well as his assistant suffered severely from malarial fever con-
tracted during their journey, which was exceedingly laborious, lasting
three months and a half.
Q4A4 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

The German expedition, under command of Dr. Schroeder, which spent
the year from September, 1882, to September, 1883, at the island of South
Georgia, is the first scientific expedition which has visited that island,
and its report is therefore of great interest. The expedition was located
at Moltke Harbor, in Royal Bay, and while their observations would
seem to indicate that the neighborhood of Cape Horn was not as stormy
during the year of their stay as has been generally supposed, one
curious fact which navigators of those seas have frequently had occa-
sion to notice was confirmed, viz, the violent storms occurred, without
exception, when the barometer stood at “ fair.”

Explorations of the island were undertaken on several occasions, but
the slate rocks were very difficult of ascent, and the enormous glaciers,
rising in many places to a height of 6,000 or 7,000 feet, prevented any
thorough examination. The climate was found to be decidedly colder
than its latitude would indicate, its mean temperature for the year being
only 35° F, the lowest thermometer reading being 26° and the highest
57° F.

EUROPE.

Measurements systematically made since 1750, and recently reported
by the Swedish Academy of Sciences, demonstrate that the Swedish
coast has been steadily rising, while the southern shore of the Baltic
has been sinking, the genera] result being that the Swedish coast has
risen nearly 56 inches during the last one hundred and thirty-four
years.

The next ship-canal to be opened to commerce will be that across the
Isthmus of Corinth. The work is being rapidly advanced, and another
year only will probably be required for its completion. This canal will
shorten the distance between the ports of the Adriatic and those of
Western Turkey about 200 miles, and for vessels from the Atlantic about
half as much.

A recent issue of the Isvestia of the Russian Geographical Society
shows that geodetic and map-making work is being energetically car-
ried on in the Russian Empire. Trigonometrical and hypsometrical sur-
veys are being pushed in many regions, numerous latitude and longitude
determinations have been made, and hydrographic work has been ear-
ried on in the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas and on the shores of the
Pacific Ocean. A hypsometrical chart of European Russia, indicating
the height of more than 18,000 points, has been published by the minis-
try of public works.

It has long been believed that Cape North was not the extreme north-
ern point of Europe, and Captain Sorenson has now demonstrated that
that distinction belongs to a promontory called Knivskjverodde, a few
miles west of Cape North, and extending rather more than a thousand
yards farther to the northward.
GEOGRAPHY. 245

ASIA,

Colonel Prjevalsky, who spent the winter of 1883-84 at Chobsen, a
little to the eastward of Koko Nor, in Northeastern Tibet, resumed his
explorations in the middle of March, erossing the Tsaidam or country
west of the Koko Nor. This region he describes as a vast salt-marsh
basin, the bed of a mighty lake at a comparatively recent geological
epoch, and having a height of 9,200 feet above the sea. At the begin-
ning of May the pass through the Burkhan Buddha Ridge was crossed
at a height of 15,700 feet, and the table land of Northern Tibet was
reached, a region quite unknown to geographers even now, and which
the Chinese have repeatedly but vainly attempted to explore. The
source of the Yellow or Hoang-ho River was found, about 70 miles south
of the Burkhan Buddha Ridge, at a height of 13,600 feet above the sea.
It is formed by two streamlets fed by springs in a wide, marshy valley.
After flowing about 14 miles it enters two wide lakes in succession, and
thence rushes furiously toward the boundaries of China proper. Colonel
Prjevalsky describes the climate of Northern Tibet as inclement in the
extreme. In the latter part of May wintery snow-storms occurred and
the thermometer stood at —9°F. at night. Through May, June, and
July it rained every day, and sometimes for several consecutive days,
frosts (23° F.) occurring every clear night. The amount of rainfall caused
by the southwest monsoon in the Indian Ocean is so great that in sum-
mer Northern Tibet is almost one vast bog. Numerous herds of large
animals were seen—yak, wild asses, antelopes, and mountain sheep, and
bears were very frequently encountered, some thirty specimens being
killed.

From the sources of the Yellow Rivera route was followed southward
across the ridge separating the sources of the Yellow River from that of
the Blue River or Yang-tse-Kiang. Journeying southward 60 or 70
miles, the banks of the Blue River were reached; but as fording was
impossible, from the depth and rapidity of the current, the expedition
returned northward along the lakes at the head of the Yellow River.
These lakes, by right of discovery, Colonel Prjevalsky called Expedition
and Russian Lakes. They are 13,500 feet above the sea; are each more
than 80 miles in circumference, and are surrounded by mountains.

Fierce attacks were repeatedly made by the Tangutan robbers on the
little force, fourteen in number, but were bravely beaten off without
loss, and in July and August, 1884, the expedition returned to the plains
of Tsaidam.

On their return journey a party of thirty gold-washers was found
at the southern foot of the Burkhan Buddha. At these diggings the
Tangutans went no deeper than 1 or 2 feet from the surface, and the
method of washing was of a very primitive character, but whole hand-
fuls of gold, in lumps as big as peas, were shown, and frequently much
larger nuggets. Colonel Prjevalsky reports gold as very plentiful, and
is of the opinion that with proper working vast treasures will be found

in this region. Returning to Gast, in Western Tsaidam, the expedition
would go into winter quarters there, and would continue explorations
of the surrounding country during the winter.

The Russian advance in Turkestan, and the surveys and explorations
consequent thereon, will enable a great deal of detailed information to
be added to the maps of the trans-Caspian region and Northern Afghan-
istan.

In the last volume published by the Caucasus Geographical Society
-are a large number of determinations of latitude and longitude made
by M. Gladysheff in these regions, and also a great number of heights
of points in Asia Minor measured by Russian officers.

M. Michael Venukoff has called the attention of the Russian Geo-
graphical Society to a new map of the island of Saghalin prepared by
M. Nikitine, the topographer, and differing from all other maps of the
island in several respects. By it the island is shown to be considerably
larger than has been supposed, although any conclusions will be ap-
proximate rather than final, till more exact surveys are completed.

A journey, the results of which will furnish a mass of information
regarding the interior of Indo-China and Northern Siam, has been per-
formed by a party under the direction of Mr. Holt-Hallett. Starting
from Moulmein in February, 1884, the expedition arrived in Bangkok
toward the last of July, having spent more than five months in explor-
ing the Shan country, surveying over 1,500 miles of route and deter-
mining the position of the Shan Ranges. This journey is another at-
tempt on behalf of British merchants to find a satisfactory trade route
from Southern China to the sea through Indo-China and Siam. Explo-
ration of the southern frontier of China, which was proposed, had to be
postponed, owing to the unsettled state of those regions. Mr. Holt-
Hallett’s report on his work in 1884 will shortly be published.

At ameeting of the Geographical Society of Paris on January 9, 1885,
a paper by M. Francis Deloncle was read, giving an account of an ex-
ploration, February to June, 1884, made by the commission, of which he
is the head, to investigate the question of a ship-canal across the Isth-
mus of Kraw, at the northern part of the Malay Peninsula. In Nature
a synopsis of the results of the expedition is given. After ascending
the peninsula to 7° 14’ north latitude, the explorers penetrated from
the eastern coast, by wide and deep channels which lead far into the
country, to a large inland sea called Talé Sah, which M. Deloncle states
they were the first Europeans to visit. The lake is 45 miles long by 12
miles wide and about 20 feet deep, and separates the island of Tanta-
lam from the peninsula proper by a number of arroyos, which extend
from Singora in the south to Lacon in the north. Three visits in all
were nade to these regions during the year, and the states of Tsang,
Taloung, Lacon, Singora, and Stouil were thoroughly explored.

In Nature for December 18, 1884, Mr. J. E. Tenison-Woods gives an
excellent description of the physical geography of the Malayan state
GEOGRAPHY. 247

of Perak, the commercial importance of which has rapidly increased
within the last few years, owing to the great quantity of tin which has
been produced there. Mr. Tenison-Woods considers the tin deposits
practically inexhaustible. Now that order and good government have
been secured by the presence and influence of a British resident, multi-
tudes of Chinese have flocked to Perak, and, in mining industry, have
entirely superseded the Malays.

The surveys and explorations by Russian and English surveyors of
the territory in dispute between Russia and Afghanistan have led to
detailed descriptions of the southern part of Turkestan and North-
ern Afghanistan from members of the boundary commission on both
sides. In the January and March (1885) numbers of the Journal of
the Royal Geographical Society, Major Holdich, R. E., commanding a
British surveying party, gives a detailed account of the country passed
over, and in the April number of the same periodical there is a transla-
tion of an article by M. Paul Lessar descriptive of the Kara-Kum or
Turkoman Desert.

Various expeditions have been proposed for the exploration of the
island of New Guinea, but the difficulties of hostile savages and a sickly
climate are so great that very little has been added to our knowledge
of that island during the past year. A Dutch gentleman, Mr. D. fF. van
Braam Morris, resident of Ternate, made two voyages to the north
coast, and ascended the Amberno or Ambernoli River for 60 miles, find-
ing it of much smaller dimensions than heretofore supposed. Mr. van
Braam Morris discovered another large river and a good harbor, a lit-
tle west of Humboldt Bay.

An attempt to penetrate by way of the Baxter River to the interior
of the island, under the leadership of Captain Strahan (employed by
the Melbourne Age), was frustrated by the hostility of the natives, who
forced the members of the expedition to abandon their boat and retreat
to the coast.

The proposed expedition of Mr. Wilfrid Powell, mentioned in the
Summary of last year, has been abandoned.

AUSTRALIA.

Among the questions arising for discussion at the first annual meet-
ing, at Melbourne, of the Victoria branch of the Geographical Society
of Australia, are the necessity of defining the exact meaning of the
geographical term ‘“ Australasia;” the compilation of a geography for
Australian schools; the exploration of New Guinea, and the discover-
ing and defining the exact boundaries of British New Guinea.

Mr. Charles Winnecke, between July and December, 1883, succeeded
in exploring and mapping about 40,000 square miles of hitherto unknown
country in South Australia near the western boundary line of Queens-
land. The country in question lies between 27° 30/ and 22° 40’ south
latitude and between 137° and 139° east longitude. In this region,
-

248 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

hitherto a blank on the maps, Mr. Winnecke has discovered and named
various lakes and mountains and one river, the Hay, an important feeder
of the Marshall.

As another instance of the enterprise characterizing Australian news-
papers in geographical matters, it may be mentioned that the Town and
Country Journal, of Sydney, has employed Mr. Shaw, a naturalist and
artist of Sydney, to make a canoe voyage down the Lachlan, Murrum-
bidgee and Murray rivers, with a view to enlarge the knowledge of the
interior river systems of Australia.

Arnhem Land, the country northwest of the Gulf of Carpentaria, has
been lately explored by Mr. D. Lindsay. All this region north of the
Roper River is a blank on even the latest Government maps, but a large
amount of material for filling up this blank has been obtained by Mr.
Lindsay’s surveys, made between July and December, 1883.

Dr. R. von Lendenfeld has been making an examination of the great
Cordillera range of New South Wales for the geological survey depart-
ment, and finds that Mount Kosciusko, commonly supposed to be the
highest peak (7,171 feet), must give way to Mount Clarke, some distance
farther south, 7,256 feet high. Indications of ancient glaciers were found
at a height of 5,800 feet above sea-level, the upper tree limit being
found at a height of 5,900 feet. On the lee side of the main range patches
of snow are found all the year round above a level of 6,500 feet, con-
stituting a proof, among many, of the lower temperature and greater
amount of moisture south of the equator.

AFRICA.

In the continent of Africa the area of unknown territory is rapidly de-
creasing as explorations are made by travellers of different nationalities.
The expedition commanded by Mr. Joseph Thomson, and fitted out by the
Royal Geographical Society, to explore the area lying directly between
the eastern coast of Africa and the Victoria Nyanza Lake, left England
in December, 1882, and, after encountering many obstacles, started in-
land in July, 1883, from Tareta, at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro, and
for many months was unheard of. The wide tract of country lying be-
tween Mounts Kilimanjaro and Kenia and the Victoria Nyanza Lake
had never been trodden by a European. Mr. Thomson visited and photo-
graphed both of these mountains. Mount Kenia he describes as a great
volcanic cone nearly 30 miles in diameter at its base, rising from a thorn-
clad plain 5,700 feet above the level of the sea. Up toa height of about
15,000 feet the angle of ascent is very low, but from that level the mount-
ain springs into a sugar-loaf peak, the sides being so steep that in many
places the snow cannot lie, the uncovered parts showing as black spots;
hence the name Donyo Egaré (the gray mountain). From Mount Kenia
Mr. Thomson pushed on, accompanying a caravan to the northwest, and
after a six days’ march reached Lake Baringo. This lake he journeyed
round, fixing its shape, extent, and position, and thence pushed on to the
GEOGRAPHY. 249

northeast shore of the Victoria Nyanza. Returning to the sea-coast the
same general route was followed, but the energetic traveler was delayed
by fever and accidents, by which he more than once nearly lost his life.
He succeeded early in June, 1884, in reaching the sea-coast at Mombasa,
having perfectly fulfilled the purpose for which the journey was under-
taken, and having very largely increased the knowledge of the regions
of equatorial Africa. Mr. Thomson showed the greatest courage, tact,
and skill as an explorer in this remarkable journey, and the detailed ac-
count of his travels which has now been published is, throughout, of en-
grossing interest.

Mr. H. H. Johnston’s exploration of Mount Kilimanjaro, undertaken
under the auspices of the British Association and the Royal Society,
during 1884, has confirmed and added to the information acquired by
Mr. Thomson’s journey.

French military geographers have completed, after four years’ labor, a
complete map of Tunisia from Algeria to Tripoli, in twenty-one sheets,
on a scale of 1: 100000. The sheets have been completed and published.

In the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society for November is an
article by Sir R. W. Rawson giving an exact account of the partition
of the entire coast of Africa between various European and native pow-
-ers. This paper is accompanied by a map showing in a striking man-
ner the claims of different nationalities.

ARCTIC REGIONS.

By far the most interesting and important event connected with Are-
tic exploration during the past year, has been the rescue of the survivors
of the expedition commanded by Lieut. A. W. Greely, U.S. A., and
the story of their achievements. Unsuccessful attempts having been
made in 1882 and 1883 to communicate with the station established at
Lady Franklin Bay in 1881 as one of the international meteorological
stations, a squadron of three ships, the Thetis, Bear, and Alert, with
officers and men of the United States Navy, commanded by Commander
W.S. Schley, U. S. N., was fitted out by the United States Government
in the spring of 1884 and sailed early in May for Smith Sound, to attempt
the rescue of the survivors or learn the fate of the expedition. The
Bear and the Thetis were Scotch whalers, purchased for the purpose ;
the Alert was given by the British Government for the expedition, and
had already spent a winter in the Arctic, under command of Captain
Nares, R. N. On June 22 the survivors of the expedition, consisting of
Lieutenant Greely and six of his men, were found at Cape Sabine, in the
last stages of starvation, one, Sergeant Ellison, dying after being taken
on board ship. The rest were brought back to the United States, where
they gradually recovered health and strength.

The expedition left St. John’s, Newfoundland, on July 7, 1881, and
was established on the shore of Discovery Harbor, where, in latitude
81° 44’, longitude 64° 45’, a station called Fort Conger was planted.
2dU SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

The first two winters were passed without loss or serious inconvenience,
but the summer of 1883 passing away without news of a relief ship, the
entire party left their camp on August 9, and were obliged to camp on
the western side of the channel, near Cape Sabine. Here they remained
till they were rescued, subsisting on what they could find of stores pre-
viously left in the neighborhood. Hunger and suffering reduced the
original number of twenty-five to seven before they were rescued, and
had succor been delayed but a few hours longer it is probable that not
one would have survived.

The following sketch of the geographical work accomplished is largely
taken from a communication to Science of February 27, 1885, by Lieu-
tenant Greely, where it is accompanied by an excellent map of the re-
gions visited, and from a paper by the same officer read at the meeting
of the British Association at Montreal. In the spring of 1882 an attempt
was made by a party, under command of Dr. Pavy, to proceed directly
northward from Cape Joseph Henry, but they failed to reach the eighty-
third parallel, owing to disruption of the polar pack north of Grinnell
Land. In April, 1882, an expedition under Lieutenant Lockwood, under-
took to explore the north coast of Greenland. Crossing Robeson Chan-
nel to Cape Sumner, a depot of provisions was established, and the ex-
plorers pushed on to the northeast as far as Cape Bryant, in 50°, west lon-
gitude, supported by three parties of men hauling provision sledges.
From Cape Bryant, Lieutenant Lockwood and Sergeant Brainard, with
an Eskimo and a dog-team, traveled across Sherard Osborn Fiord to Cape
Britannia, trying the depth of water midway between those capes and
finding no bottom at 800 feet. From Cape Britannia, which was the
farthest land seen by the English expedition of 1875, they pushed on
to the northeastward, till on May 15, 1882, Lockwood Island was reached,
and its latitude carefully determined by cireummeridian and subpolar
observations as 83° 24’ north. To the northeastward land was seenin
about 83° 35’ latitude and 38° west longitude. To the southeast only a
mass of rounded, snow-covered mountains was seen. The entire coast
was extremely rugged and precipitous, but only one glacier was ob-
served. A remarkable feature, stretching along the coast from one
head-land to another, was a tidal crack in the ice, apparently marking a
separation between the ice of the bays and that of the ocean. Above
the eighty-third parallel traces of the polar bear, the lemming, and the
Arctic fox were seen, and a hare and a ptarmigan were killed. Return-
ing, the same route was followed, Lieutenant Lockwood and Sergeant
Brainard reaching Fort Conger without mishap.

In April, 1882, Lieutenant Greely, with three men, made a journey to
the interior of Grinnell Land. Passing to the westward of Miller Island
by a fiord, a river was reazhed flowing from a large glacial lake named
Lake Hazen. Again in June this region was visited by Lieutenant
Greely, who followed up the valley of Very River, flowing into the south-
west end of Lake Hazen, till on July 4 he stood on the summit of Mount
GEOGRAPHY. 251

Arthur, 4,500 feet high. From here could be seen an enormous ice cap
on the mountains north of the Garfield and Conger Ranges, through the
gorges of which numerous glaciers pushed southward, while to the
northwestward the trend of the mountain range showed its connection
with the Challenger Mountains of Lieutenant Aldrich. Lieutenant
Greely found the southern limit of the ice cap covering Grinnell Land
to closely coincide with the eighty-second parallel, while in July the
country between the eighty-first and eighty-second parallels, extend-
ing from Kennedy and Robeson Channels to the Western Polar Ocean,
was entirely free from snow except on the very backbone. Vegetation
was found to be quite plentiful willows, saxifrage, grasses, and other
plants growing in abundance. A more detailed account of this remark-
ably fertile region, such as Nordenskiold expected to find in Greenland,
will shortly be given by Lieutenant Greely.

In 1883 Lieutenant Lockwood’s attempt to reach the northern point
of Greenland was unsuccessful, owing to open water, but on his return
to Fort Conger he was sent with Sergeant Brainard and a dog-team to
attempt the crossing to the western shore of Grinnell Land. They sue-
ceeded in reaching Greely Fiord, which penetrates Grinnell Land from
the westward, and followed it some distance. From here the western
shore of Grinnell Land could be indicated in about 87° west longitude,
while to the southward very high land was seen, apparently separated
from Grinnell Land, and was named Arthur Land. They found stretch-
ing from Archer to Greely fiord the northern edge of an immense ice
cap, which had an average height on the perpendicular front of 150 feet.
A journey from Cape Sabine by Sergeant Long developed the extension
of Hayes Sound to the westward. As will be seen by a comparison of
Lieutenant Greely’s maps with those previously existing, a large addition
has been made to our knowledge of the configuration of these portheru
shores by the labors of Lieutenant Greely and his gallant associates,
and it is earnestly to be hoped that his health and strength will soon be
sufficiently restored to permit him to give in detail the results of his
labors, and the inferences which his experience and study enable him to
draw from them.

In a paper read before the British Association at Montreal, Lieut. P.
H. Ray gave an account of the region lying between the Yukon River
and the Arctic Sea, previously unvisited. In 1883, with two natives,
he traveled 160 miles due south from Point Barrow, as far as a low
range of mountains running northeast and southwest and separating
the northeast watershed from that of Kotzebue Sound. Farther than
this his guides were afraid to go. Lieutenant Ray found the whole re-
gion a labyrinth of small lakes, lagoons, and streams, in summer im-
passable to every one but an Eskimo with his kayak, as at that season
all that part not covered with water becomes a wet marsh, che traveler
sinking through to the frozen ground underneath at each step. The
252 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

country is uninhabitable, destitute of timber, and without soil to sup-
port vegetation, the earth being strongly impregnated with salt. After
two years of careful observation, Lieutenant Ray gives his opinion de-
cidedly against the probable existence of an open polar sea, therein dif-
fering from Lieutenant Greely.

For more than a year an expedition, under command of Lieutenants
Holm and Garde, of the Danish navy, has been engaged in exploring
the east and southeast coasts of Greenland. Winter quarters for
188384 were occupied at Nanortalik, 50 miles east of Cape Farewell.
A journey lasting two and a half months was performed during the
summer, but no account of the results of their explorations has yet
been published. During the winter of 1884—85 one-half the expedition
were to winter in a suitable place on the east coast, the other half re-
turning to Nanortalik. In consequence of frequent and violent changes
of temperature, sledge journeys cannot be performed in this part of
Greenland, the only means of conveyance being the boat. The pro-
gramme is to explore the east coast by boats as far north as possible,
and to return from Greenland in the autumn of 1885.

In June, 1884, Lieutenant Jensen, of the Danish navy, accompanied
by Herr Lorenzen, geologist, and Herr Riis-Carstensen, artist, left Den-
mark for Holsteinborg, on the west coast of Greenland, to explore the
coast southward from Holsteinborg to Sukkertoppen, a region never
before examined by Europeans. The results of their work have not yet
been published. From May to September, 1884, the Danish gunboat
Fylla, Captain Normann, was engaged in examining the west coast of
Greenland as far as 70° north latitude. This work included a careful
exploration of theinland glaciers of Greenland, as wellas dredging, sound-
ing, and trawling along the coast and in Davis Strait, Baffin’s Bay, and
Disco Bay. Valuable collections were carried home to Denmark, in-
cluding a block of ironstone weighing about 1,800 pounds.

The Russian expedition tothe delta of the Lena River, commanded by
Lieut. N. D. Jurgens, has returned, having lost no members and having
had no serious case of illness. Scurvy made its appearance during the
first winter of their stay, but was quickly suppressed. The lowest tem-
perature experienced was—50° centigrade, with very frequent storms.
The sun was hardly seen during the summer, and the highest tempera-
ture, 12° C., was only once reached. Many changes in the maps of this
region will result from the surveys of this party. Sagastyr, where the
observations were made, was supposed to be the northern point of the
delta, but the most northerly land was found to be Dunas Island, in 74°
north latitude. The tidal changes are very small and are largely influ-
enced by the winds. Dr. Bunge, the naturalist of tle party, has spent
the winter of 1884~’85 in Irkutsk, and in the spring will visit and ex-
plore the basin of the Jana, in Northeastern Siberia, In 1886 he proposes
to visit the New Siberia Islands.
GEOGRAPHY. 253

The hopes of those who, like Baron Nordenskiold, looked for success
for the trade route from Northern Siberia by way of the Kara Sea to
Europe, seem doomed to disappointment. As has been before pointed
out in these yearly summaries, no dependence can be placed on the
navigability of the Novaya Zemlyan Straits in any year. During the
last five or six years the steamer Louise has only twice succeeded in
reaching the Yenesei and returning with cargo to Europe, having failed
three times in the attempt. At Turukhansk, on the Yenesei, large quan-
tities of wheat, rye, and oats have been collected to be transported to
Europe, but there seems now but little prospect of these products ever
reaching there. The tow-boats and lighters built for transporting freight
to the mouth of the Yenesei are all to be sold, the difficulties of navigat-
ting the Kara Sea making the success of the scheme hopeless. This
conclusion agrees with the experience of M. Rakhmanin (cited by Dr.
Schmidt, in a recent lecture on the Vega voyage), who had wintered
twice at Spitzbergen and twenty-six times at Novaya Zemlya, and only
found the way to the Yenesei open on five occasions.

In Nature for November 13, 1884, is a communication from Mr. W.
G. S. Paterson, Her Britannic Majesty’s consul for Iceland, who states
that the light-house keeper at Cape Reykjanes, the southwest point of
Iceland, had discovered a new volcanic island a few miles off that cape.
This region has long been known as a center of volcanic activity, islands
having been thrown up from time to time and afterwards subsiding.
The island was sought for without success by the French cruisers Du-
pleix and Romanche, and by Captain Normann, of the Danish gunboat
Fylla, on his return from Greenland. Captain Normann, after a careful
search and many soundings, became convinced that the new island in
question is no other than the outermost of the Fowlskerries, a well-
known group of rocky islets.

An important element toward elucidating the currents of the polar
seas has been furnished by the discovery by an Eskimo, on an ice floe

in Julianhaab Bay, Greenland, of several relics of the ill-fated Jean-
nette expedition. These relics consist of various papers, articles of
sailors’ apparel, part of a tent, &c., and have been positively identified
as belonging to the crew and officers of the Jeannette. Lieutenant
Danenhower, U.S. N., one of the survivors of the expedition, states, in
in a letter to the writer, that the articles were abandoned at the first
camp, near where the Jeannette sank, on June 12, 1881, in latitude 77°
15’ north, longitude 156° east, and were exhibited on December 1, 1884,
at a meeting of the Geographical Society of Copenhagen. These articles
probably drifted north of Franz Josef Land and in close proximity to the
pole. The direction and rate of the drift can only be approximately reck-
oned, but the distance being about 2,500 nautical miles, and the time oc-
cupied not far from 1,000.days, makes an average drift of 24 miles a day,
without allowing for deviations.
954 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.
HYDROGRAPHY.

No new or striking developments have been shown by the hydro-
graphic work of the different Governments engaged in making and cor-
recting ocean and coast charts during 1884.

The results of the investigations carried on by the United States
Coast Survey during past years in the depths of the sea off the North
Atlantic coast and in the Gulf of Mexico and its approaches, are re-
vealed in a striking manner by a model which shows the structural
features of the two great basins of the Gulf of Mexico and the Bay of
North America. This model, constructed under the direction of the
Superintendent at the Coast Survey office, presents also representations
in relief of the Bahamas, the West India islands, and the Bermudas,
and of parts of the continent. The name “Bay of North America”
was suggested by the Superintendent at the April meeting of the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences, 1884, to designate that great embayment of
the North Atlantic which les west of the meridian of 60° longitude
west from Greenwich.

The United States Fish Commission steamer Albatross, under com-
mand of Lieut. Commander Z. L. Tanner, U. 8. N., has done a large
amount of valuable hydrographic work, in addition to her regular work
in connection with the fisheries. In January, 1884, while proceeding
from Norfolk to St. Thomas, West Indies, many soundings were made,
disproving the existence of the dangers to navigation called, respectively,
the Ashton, Perseveranza, and Mourand Shoals. After leaving St.
Thomas, numerous lines of soundings were made to define exactly the
submarine ridge separating the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, and
to ascertain the general contour of the bottom, proving at the same time
the non-existence of many vigias or shoals, the alleged existence of which
has for many years disfigured the charts. This valuable work was
continued until May, and data collected for wiping off many alleged
shoals from the charts, among others the Loos and Leighton Rocks,
off the south side of Santo Domingo; Sancho Pardo Shoal, off Cape
San Antonio; the Ancona Breakers; and the La Vela Shoal. Aves
islet, 100 miles west of Guadeloupe, was found to be the summit of a
mountain extremely precipitous on its western slope and extending in a
SSE. direction over 150 miles to the 1000 fathom line. On many of the
alleged positions of shoals depths of over 2,000 fathoms were found,
the greatest depth being 3,169 fathoms, about 60 miles southwest of
the Grand Cayman Island, between the Misteriosa Bank and Thunder
Knoll. During 1884 the Albatross made 701 deep-sea soundings, located
with such accuracy as to give them a hydrographic value. In January,
1885, many additional soundings were made by the Albatross in the
Gulf of Mexico.

In a paper communicated to Science for January 30, 1885, Com-
mander Bartlett, U. S. N., gives an account of the various sounding
GEOGRAPHY. 255

and dredging expeditions from whose labors the necessary material has
been accumulated for making a complete relief model of the Caribbean
Sea. During the cruise of the Challenger it was shown that in a sub-
marine lake the temperature is constant to the greatest depth, and is
the same as that of the ocean at the depth of the rim of the lake at the
deepest point. The labors of Commander Sigsbee, U.S. N., from 1874
to 1878, while commanding the Coast Survey steamer Blake, showed
that the temperature of the Gulf of Mexico below a depth of 800 fath-
oms is constant at 395°, the normal temperature of the ocean at that
depth in the region of the equatorial current. It was consequently in-
ferred that the Caribbean Sea, from which the Gulf of Mexico receives
its waters, is inclosed by a rim which was 800 fathoms below the sur-
face at its deepest part. This inference has been completely borne out
by the researches of Commander Bartlett and Lieutenant-Commanders
Brownson and Tanner, of the United States Navy, and the results of their
labors are admirably shown bya contour model of the Caribbean Sea ex-
_ hibited at the New Orleans Exposition. This model is on a horizontal:
scale of 33 miles to an inch and avertical scale of 6,000 feet to the inch.

Baron Nordenskiold has communicated to the Journal of the Royal
Geographical Society a synopsis, by Herr Axel Hamberg, of the obser-
vations for temperature, specific gravity, and saltness of the expedition
of 1883 to East Greenland and the adjacent waters, but no attempt is
made to form any general deductions from the data presented.

The Danish gunboat Fylla, of 500 tons, Capt. C. Normann, was en-
gaged during the summer of 1884 insurveying, sounding, and dredging
on the west coast of Greenland and in Davis Strait. The greatest
depth found was about 900 fathoms, while in the narrowest part of Davis
Strait depths of only 400 fathoms were found. The ship was fitted with
the very best appliances, a Sigsbee machine being used for sounding.
In Disco Bay, where no soundings had been before made, depths of from
200 to 270 fathoms were found, while a ridge on which there are but
180 to 190 fathoms constitutes a sort of threshold between the bay and
Davis Strait, preventing icebergs with a greater height above the water
than 150 feet from passing from the great fiord of Jacobshavn to
the ocean, the average proportion between the exposed and submerged
surfaces being as 1 to 8.8. As was the case with the Nordenskiold ex-
pedition to East Greenland, it was found, in taking serial temperatures
of sea-water, that the coldest water is not found nearest the bottom,
but that the temperature increases with the depth in the polar current
and underlying water layers.

the liberty of adding to these abstracts occasional remarks of his own,
generally historical, which, to avoid confusion, are now inclosed in

1. Dr. W. K6ppen, in reference to the distribution of meteorological
stations, says that the complaint still comes, on the one hand, of the
immense mass of meteorological figures written and published annually
without corresponding results, and, on the other hand, of the great want
of proper data whenever any new question is proposed. This state of af-
fairs results from the nature of meteorological work, and will probably
continue permanently. [Every new question in physics is tested by
means of new apparatus and experiments, but in meteorology, as in as-
tronomy, we can do but little experimenting, and must derive our knowl-
edge from the discussion of a large mass of observations taken under
widely different circumstances. In both these latter studies the observa-
tions must be published to as great extent as possible, as no one can fore-
see how soon they will be wanted in reference to some new question, nor
how long the world must wait to accumulate new observations whereby to
answer that question in case those already made be not thus rendered
available. The experiments and apparatus in chemistry and physics
vastly outnumber the observations in meteorology, but do not need to be
published in full, as they can be easily repeated at any time.| More homo-
geneity could perhaps be given to the work by the formation of an inter-
national institute for the direction of observations and investigations,
but in the present system of individualized activity we find stations that
have the following peculiarities: (1) Those with very comprehensive
and complete observations, and corresponding publications; (2) sta-
tions in such isolated situations that they must be used to fill up great
gaps in the weather chart of the world; (3) stations with long-continued
uniformly-comparable records; (4) groups of stations, such that the dif-
ferences in latitude and longitude are slight and the differences in topo-
graphical conditions are large. Each of these groups gives data proper
to solve some special question, such as the geographical, the chronolog-
ical, and topographical distribution of climatic peculiarities, the in-
vestigation of physical and mechanical details as to special storms or
other phenomena. [Special stations for rainfall, thunder-storms, torna-
does, auroras, have also been started in great numbers for the solution
of the respective subjects, and others for the study of glaciers, fog,
frosts, hygiene, forestry, phenology, and various agricultural ques-
tions.]| Koppen’s idea seems to be that at present we need a greater
METEOROLOGY. 259

number of the special stations, or, in lieu thereof, a large number of
stations with self-registering apparatus, so located as to represent for
any country the greatest variety of typical altitudes, valleys, slopes,
summits, forests, shores, plains, &c. Climatic data from such stations
for ten years would answer any question bearing on any new locality, in
addition to which are needed two or three temporary experimental fields
on which ten or twenty stations can be arranged. [The general weather
service of the Signal Office offering about two hundred stations, or about
one station to every 10,000 square miles, if it could be extended over
the whole world, would offer a fair basis for the general study of me-
teorology as a dynamic problem. It is only when we study the innu-
merable applications of this science to the wants of mankind that we
are confronted with the practical impossibility of securing enough sta-
tions and observations to satisfy all requirements. The best solution of
the difficulty seems to be the maintenance of first and second class sta-
tions for weather telegraphy and general storm study, and the main-
tenance of third-class and special stations to deal with the special
questions that are suggested by the meteorological student, as well as by
the various branches of human industry.] (D. MW. Z., 1, p. 437.)

2. [The progress of meteorology in America promises to be greatly
stimulated by the formation of state weather services, which will, it is
hoped, give for the respective states a detailed study of local climate
and its relations to agriculture and to human industry. These services
will also be the medium through which predictions of local thunder
storms, tornadoes, cold waves, &c., can be communicated to the people
in detail. The first erganization of this kind dates from early in the
century, when New York, Pennsylvania, and possibly other states,
showed some activity in this direction. After a long period of neglect,
the subject was revived in 1875 by Professor Hinrichs, who started a
state service for lowa, which has ever since been carried on most suc-
cessfully. The formation of additional services has been the direct re-
sult of a circular and other correspondence between General William 5.
Hazen and the governors of the respective states. Similar services now
exist in some fifteen different states, some of which publish very excel-
lent monthly reviews, while others contribute their observations directly
to the Army Signal Office for use in its monthly weather review. It is
evident that in this way the study of meteorology and the utilization of
the work of the Signal Office will both be furthered, and that, on the
other hand, the general service, namely, the prediction of general storms
and weather features, will be more especially fostered by the Signal
Service. |

3. An important step for American meteorology has been the start-
ing of The American Meteorological Journal, a monthly review of
meteorological matters, edited by Prof. M. W, Harrington, of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, at Ann Arbor. The desirability of some such
journal has been for a long time felt, but the definite impulse to the
260 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

F
present undertaking seems to have been given by letters from various
meteorologists suggesting to Professor Harrington the hope that he
might undertake it. So far as the financial success of this journal is
concerned there can evidently be no doubt, provided its columns suc-
cessfully combine the scientific and the popular features that in Ger-
many have been divided between the two journals published at Ham-
burg and Magdeburg, respectively.

Among the principal articles that have appeared in the journal during
1884 are the following:

Prof. T. C. Mendenhall, History of the Ohio State Meteorological
Bureau, established April 17, 1882.

Prof. H. M. Paul, Barometric Waves of Very Short Period.

Prof. William M. Davis, Winds and Currents of the Equatorial
Atlantic.

A. J. Phinney, The Oakville Tornadoes.

Prof. H. A. Hazen, Exposure of Thermometers. The Sling Psy-
chrometer. :

Lieut. J. P. Finley, Tornado Predictions.

Prof. William M. Davis, The Relation of Tornadoes to Cyclones.

H. H. Clayton, Meteorologic Cycle. (Showing a barometric and
rainfall oscillation every twenty-five months.)

G. K. Gilbert, Tornado Predictions.

Prof. H. A. Hazen, Tornado Generation.

L. A. Sherman, Movements of Weather-Areas.

H. H. Clayton, The Thunder Squalls of July 5, 1884.

H. M. Paul, Thermometer-Exposure.

Prof. F. H. Loud, Diurnal Wind Variation at Colorado Springs.

4. [Beside the State weather services, the meteorological magazines,
and the meteorological instruction in colleges, another powerful help in
scientific progress is the organization of meteorological societies in the
United States. An occasional paper on some metcorological subject is
read before some geographical or scientific society, the most active in
this respect being the Philosophical Society of Washington, in which
there is material sufficient to form a special meteorological section. An
effort was made at the Philadelphia meeting of the American Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science to secure the recognition of meteor-
ology by organizing a section of terrestrial physics as distinguished
from molecular physies, and this may possibly be accomplished on some
future occasion. The honor of establishing the first special society for
the study of our science belongs to Prof. W. Upton and Mr. E. B. Weston,
both of Providence; Mr. W. M. Davis and Prof. W. H. Niles, of Cam-
bridge; Mr. D. Fitzgerald, of Boston, and a few others (including the
present writer), who held the first preliminary meeting of organization
in June and the first annual regular meeting on the 21st of October, in
Boston. This society will for the present make a special effort to secure
more numerous rainfall, thunder-storm, and possibly other special ob-
METEOROLOGY. 261

servers, in New England; they have established standard gauges of
three different patterns, and have published a monthly bulletin, with
rainfall map and other data. It is hoped that by the co-operation of
the states of New England this organization may become a New Eng-
land weather service. |

5. In order to collect data for the information of Government on the
proposition to run steamship lines from England to stations on the
shores of Hudson’s Bay, and thus afford British America a convenient
outlet for its immense product of grain, Lieut. W. R. Gordon has, under
the Canadian Meteorological Service, established seven stations on the
shores of the bay, at which observations were begun in the autumn
of 1884. These stations will contribute invaluable information for the
study of North American storms and climate. A sketch of the location
of each is given by W. P. Anderson in the Cambridge journal, (Science
for March 13, 1885,) full details being given in the report of Lieut. W.
R. Gordon. (See also Nature, XXX, p. 641.)

6. Dr. B. A. Gould has published additional volumes of the Annals
of the Meteorological Office of the Argentine Republic, which contain
original observations in full, and many interesting items relative to
Buenos Ayres, Paraguay,and Patagonia. (Z. O. G. M., x1x, p. 130.)

7. In connection with the proposed canal across the Isthmus of Panama
regular meteorological observations are being made at several stations.
The average temperature varies from 25°F. in winter to 85° F. in sum-
mer. Two large hospitals at Panama and Colon, respectively, and a
health resort at Taboga afford opportunity for regular observations on
climate and hygiene. (Nature, xxx, p. 580.)

8. The Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg proposes a special com-
mittee to which shall be committed the general direction of the mag-
netic and meteorological works that have for some years been carried
on by various Government officials, especially the physical observatory,
the geographical society, the bureau of agriculture, and the imperial
navy.

9. (See sect. 73/.)

10. H. F. Blanford, in his annual report on the administration of the
meteorological department of the Government of India for 1883, states
that work on the physics and temperature of the sun and on the
absorption of the earth’s atmosphere has steadily continued. Special
reports have been made on the snowfall in India and the Himalayas,
which have led to a theory of the dry winds and droughts, and he urges
a special study in the future of the meteorology of this high mountain
region. Data have been collected together for charts of distribution of
temperature in Northern India, which will appear in the next or second
part of Vol. II of the India Meteorological Memoirs. A very large and
elaborate chart of the average annual rainfall in India has been pub-
lished with the co-operation of the surveyor-general’s office. He is
also himself at work upon a number of interesting questions as to the
962 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

annual distribution of rainfall and the eause of the droughts. Much
pains have been taken to increase the number of rainfall observers ; and
an elaborate discussion of special cyclones by his assistant, Mr. Elliot,
shows that the origin, continuation, and movement of a storm depend
only upon the atmospheric conditions in the region visited by the storm
and not on anything outside of this region, so that the weather normal
to the season prevails over surrounding countries, while storms move
over the Bay of Bengal. The great collection of meteorological obser-
vations made in the Indian Ocean since 1856, as collected by the Lon-
don Meteorological Office, has been purchased from that office, prop-
erly corrected by the India office, and is now under discussion by Mr.
Elliot and Mr. Dallas. The chapter relating to barometric observations
is substantially completed. Tlie new system of storm-signals for Cal-
cutta has been successfully introduced. A special system for Bombay
has also been continued as in former years. The daily time-signals for
Calcutta are in charge of this office. The erection of a first-class me-
teorological observatory at Allahabad has not yet been completed.
The Indian Meteorological Office has published among its Indian Me-
moirs the following :

F. Chambers, The Winds of Kurrachee.

S. A. Hill, Some Results of Meteorological Observations at Alla-
habad.

S. A. Hill, The Meteorology of the Northwest Himalayas.

11. The London Meteorological Council began with January, 1884,
the publication of its Monthly Weather Report, which, although it is
published very late in the year, yet affords encouraging evidence of the
energy with which meteorology is studied in Great Britain. [Similar
monthly weather reviews are now published by many important mete-
orological offices. We believe that the initial step in this direction was
taken by the United States in 1872. Its monthly review as re-organ-
ized in 1873 by the present writer, has continued with praiseworthy
thoroughness and promptness. |

12. The report of J. Y. Buchanan on the Physics and Chemistry, the
Specific Gravity and Deep-Sea Temperatures, observed during the voy-
age of H. M. 8. Challenger, has been published, and is reviewed by
kh. H. Mill. (Nature, xxx, p. 313.)

13. At the Health Exhibition, London, July, 1884, a meteorological
conference was held. Papers were read by Dr. J. W. Tripe, on Mete-
orology and Health; R. H. Scott, on Equinoctial Gales, and also on
Cumuiative Temperatures, or Phzenological Constants. (Nature, Xxx,
p. 351.) ]

14. The International Geodetic Congress, held at Rome in October,
1883, adopted resolutions recommending Greenwich as the initial me-
ridian for all longitudes, and also Greenwich noon as the initial point
of a universal hour and cosmopolitan date.

15. The International Meteorological Congress, held at Rome, 1879,
METEOROLOGY. 263

recommended the general acceptance of Greenwich meridian for the
reckoning of longitudes.

16. The International Meridian and Time Conference, held at Wash-
ington October, 1884, has confirmed these and other recommendations,
and unanimously recommends an international system of longitude and
time based on the Greenwich meridian and mean midnight.

17. [In conformity with the above, the Chief Signal Officer has adopted
for the use of the Signal Service the 75th meridian, or five hours west of
Greenwich, as the uniform standard for the United States and for use
in the Monthly Weather Review. For the International Bulletin the
observations are made at Greenwich noon. The International Polar
Conference has, we believe, not adopted any especial meridian for gen-
eral use in the publications of the work done by its polar parties. |

18. Dr. Assmann has published the annual volumes of the meteorolog-
ical observations for the Wetterwarte or weather observatory of the
Magdeburg Times. It seems that he has been successful in inspiring
the owner of this newspaper, Mr. Faber, with something of his own en-
thusiasm, the result being to establish a very completely organized ob-
servatory to which a number of subsidiary stations make reports, rep-
resenting all of Saxony and its neighborhood. Everything is done in
accordance with the recommendations of the International Congress
and the best information of the present day. We note especially that
the records with the Sprung barograph show the great advantage of
continuous registers over those that record only every ten or fifteen
minutes, or possibly every hour. (Z. O. G. M., xvui, p. 434.)

19. Dr. Assmann, on behalf of the Meteorological Observatory at
Magdeburg, has undertaken the publication of a monthly journal for
practical meteorology, This journal—the Monatschrift—is intended for
local distribution among non-scientific readers; it treats of all matters
in an elementary, popular manner, and is especially rich in everything
that pertains to agriculture and hygiene, such as the temperature of
the lowest air strata, excessive heat and frost, the distribution of rain.
In this latter field good work has been done by establishing numerous
rain-gauges throughout the neighboring countries, and an interesting
study is in process on the influence of the Brocken upon the rainfall.
[In this respect Dr. Assmann seems to be studying a problem similar to
that which the Signal Office has undertaken in reference to Mount
Washington.| (Z. 0. G. M., XIX, p. 201.)

Dr. Assmann at the close of the second year of his monthly journal
for Practical Meteorology, has changed its title to Das Wetter, and car-
ries it on now as a popular German monthly for world-wide distribu-
tion. Being also recognized as the popular organ of the German Mete-
orological Association, it has at once assumed a high importance. {The
rapid growth of interest in meteorology in Germany is best realized by
considering that within two years two new journals have thus been
started under flattering auspices, and that lectures on meteorology are
964 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

now given in about twenty universities, whereas scarcely five gave any
proper attention to the subject in 1883, when Mr. F. Waldo compiled the
Signal Service Note on this subject.] (2. O. G. M., x1x, p. 287.)

The German Meteorological Association was organized on the 18th
of November, 1883, at a meeting in Hamburg of about thirty of the
most prominent meteorologists of Germany. At this meeting a tempo-
rary organization was effected, Dr. G. Neumayer being elected president.
A simple form of constitution was adopted, and the first regular meet-
ing appointed to be held at Magdeburg ir September, 1884, at the time
of the annual meeting of the German Scientific Association (Natur-
forscher-Versammlung). The formation of local branches is also en-
couraged, of which three hae already been announced, namely, Ham-
burg-Altona, Berlin, Magdeburg.

Like the Austrian, so the German association proposed to hold but one
annual meeting, ber will publish a monthly journal as a means of stim-
ulating the development of meteorology.

20. The first annual meeting of the German Meteorological Associa-
tion was held in Magdeburg, September 19, 1884. The secretary, Dr.
van Bebber, stated that the number of members was, at that time,
406; branch associations exist in Magdeburg, Munich, Berlin, Ham-
burg-Altona, and Rudoltstadt. Of the members, 361 are domestic and
45 foreign; 51 are employed in meteorology, 130 as teachers of various
grades, 47 are meteorological observers, 21 physicians, 30 lawyers, 10
apothecaries, 71 manufacturers and merchants, 18 agriculturists, 20
military officers, 12 astronomers. The branch associations have mem-
bership about as follows: Magdeburg, 200; Hamburg- Altona, 43; Ber-
lin, 92; Munich, 65; Rudolfstadt, not given. This last Sere a was
formed in 1880, but is now become a branch of the general association.
A proposition is on foot looking to the eventual union of the journal of
the German society with that of the Austrian, probably at the begin-
ning of the year 1886. At present the German society maintains its
own and encourages Dr. Assmann’s journal, Das Wetter. [It is evi-
dent from the list given elsewhere that it will be very difficult to con-
dense into one journal all the emanations from the numerous investiga-
tors of this most active scientific nation; but for the convenience of
students it is to be hoped that we may have one or two, but not more,
special meteorological journals in each language. It would seem that
one in Russian, one in French, two in German, and two in English, one
for Great Britain and one for America, with perhaps a third eventually
for India and Australia, should abundantly answer the local needs of
the respective communities and the general needs of science.] (D. M. Z.,
I, p. 412.)

21. Of the German periodicals devoted more or less to meteorology
we notice especially the Wochenschrift fiir Astronomie, Meteorologie und
Geographie, published by H. J. Klein, of Cologne; Der Naturforscher,
published in Berlin; Humboldt, a monthly journal for natural sciences,
METEOROLOGY. 265

published by Prof. Dr. G. Krebs; Astronomische Nachrichten, the well.
known astronomical journal now published at Kiel by Professor Krue-
ger; Geographische Mittheilungen, the well-known geographical journal
now published by Professor Supan, at Gotha; Hydrographische Mit-
theilungen, published by the German Admiralty, Berlin.

22. Capt. N. Hoffmeyer and Dr. George Neumayer having agreed to
continue conjointly the daily synoptie weather charts for the Atlantic
Ocean and Europe, beginning with the 1st of December, 1880, this im-
portant work has therefore been kept up. The expenses are largely
defrayed by the subscriptions of those interested in meteorology, and
more such are solicited. The charts show the eastern half of North
America, the West Indies, and the northern coast of Brazil, the whole
of the North Atlantic, Greenland, Europe, and the western half of
Siberia. They represent the condition of the weather in the morning
about 8 A. M., or local time. The base chart is apparently a conical
development on a scale about four times as large as that of the United
States international map of the northern hemisphere, and three-fourths
of that formerly adopted by Hoffinger; it therefore shows every station
and every ship’s report. If the British office publishes special charts
for each day of the international polar campaign, from the Ist of August,
1882, to the 31st, then the German Government will probably supple-
ment these charts by corresponding daily series for the South Atlantic
Ocean. (Z. O. G. M., XIx, p. 30.)

23. The Italian Meteorological Association, having its central obser-
vatory at the Royal College of Carl Albert, in Monealieri, has continued
to publish a monthly bulletin, which is considered as a second series,
beginning with January, 1881; the first series being the monthly Annu-
aire, published by Ragona. The present bulletin is under the editor-
ship of Denza, who has secured stations not only throughout Italy and
the Alps, but also throughout South America. (Z. O. G. M., Xvi, p.
307.)

24. The central oflice for Italian meteorology has continued to publish
its magnificent series of large quarto volumes of Annales. These vol-
umes are divided into three portions; the first contains reports on spe-
cial work, such as Millosevich on rainfall, Ragona on the wind, Chistoni
on magnetism and barometric comparisons, Ferrari on thunder-storms.
The second portion contains synopses of the meteorological observa-
tions. The third portion contains the astronomical work at the Rome
Observatory under Tacchini.

25. The Meteorological Institute of Saxony since 1863 has been a
bureau of the Astronomical Observatory at Leipsic, but an important
advance was made on the 1st of April, 1884, in the appointment of Dr.
P. Schreiber, of Chemnitz, as director of the Meteorological Institute,
which is now reorganized and placed on an independent basis in the
Department of the Interior. Dr. Schreiber is well known by his works
on meteorology and barometric hypsometry, and the new institution at
266 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

Leipsic has, under his management, already shown increased vitality
and usefulness.

26. He has begun the publication of a monthly report in a slightly
condensed form, but containing much appropriate and instructive mat-
ter, which is arranged in the following divisions: (a) Results by dec-
ades and months for 11 stations; (b) average variability of the weather
in Saxony; (c) weather review for Europe; (d) normal weather in
Leipsic for the month; (e) verifications of the predictions for the month
given separately for each locality. There are several features in this
weather review especially worthy of commendation; thus the use of
decades in addition to the months is a step which has been for some
time past adopted by the meteorological institutes of the Netherlands
and Italy and the German Seewarte. These are more convenient than
Dove’s pentades, which are in fact only specially applicable to the
rapid change in temperature. (D. M. Z., 1, 417 and 285.)

27, [The Signal Service in 1870 adopted a form which made it conven-
ient to reckon by we kly averages from Sunday to Saturday throughout
the year, and a number of tables of this kind were prepared; but very
little was, however, given to the scientific world in this form; in fact,
the weekly form was itself adopted almost entirely for executive rea-
sons, and was replaced in 1881 by a much more convenient monthly form,
in which the division and summation by decades is very easily made,
although it seems improbable that it will ever be practicable to publish
the enormous mass of signal service data ii this extreme detail.|

28. Prof. M. Merino, well known as the author of a memoir on the
climate of Madrid, has been appointed as director of the Observatory of
that city, and has published with unexpected promptness the volumes
of Spanish observations for the years 1876 to 1882, which publication
had fallen in arrears, owing to successive changes since the death of
the former director, Aguilar. The number of meteorological stations
has been more than doubled during the past ten years and the outfit
of instruments perfected. Most of the stations have means of observing
solar radiation, terrestrial ground temperatures, evaporation, and wind
velocity by Robinson’s anemometer. The international forms for pub-
lication of climatological data have been adopted. (Z. O. G. M., XIx,
p. 340.)

29. Lieut. E. von Wohlgemuth communicates the general results of the
Arctic expedition of the Austrian Government to the island of Jan
Mayen in 1882~83. He states that no difficulty seriously interfered
with carrying out every point of the programme, everything being, in
fact, much more favorable than had been anticipated. Only once did
the minimum thermometer fall below —32° C.; the temperature most fa-
vorable for work was —10° or —15°, since with this temperature came a
dryness and transparency of the air, and for it clothing could be selected
that on the one hand protected from the cold and on the other was not
so heavy as to interfere with outdoor labor or provoke troublesome per-
METEOROLOGY. 267

spiration. Absolute calms or the lightest breezes, up to 5 miles per
hour, occurred only during one hundred and forty-one hours out of the
six months September to February; during the other half of this year
winds and storms prevailed so that the average wind velocity was 20
miles per hour. This very stormy weather necessitated extraordinary
care with reference to the security of the building. The first part of
the polar night belonged to the pleasantest period of the residence on
Jan Mayen; it brought cold dry weather and outdoor sports, such as
sailing with ice-boats, running with snow-shoes, skating, and many
other new, exciting, and refreshing changes in the otherwise monoto-
nous occupations. The health of the whole party was excellent; neither
scurvy, nor catarrh, nor frost-bites were experienced. The prevailing
winds were east-southeast and south-southeast during the prevalence
of cyclonic storms, some of which occasionally became almost stationary
low pressures. During such winds the temperature rose to an average
summer heat, even in the midst of winter, and the snow melted rapidly
everywhere. The monthly wind summary shows a slight percentage of
the southwest winds that prevail in more southern latitudes; these ex-
ceptions are explained as due to the formation of cyclones whose front
sides only attained complete development. On theother hand, tie higher
currents were almost exclusively from the southwest, so that even the
cirrus clouds, almost without exception, came from this direction. Of
the cyclones that passed over Jan Mayen, only the front was well de-
veloped. The greatest wind force was nearer the outer limit of the whirl
than is the case in ordinary tropical cyclones. The storms did not sud-
denly stop on the advent of the lowest pressure, but after the passage
of the center still continued with all vigor. Frequently in the region of
a barometric depression light winds prevailed, the barometer was fluc-
tuating, the wind and sea were calm, and the brightest sunshine con-
tinued for many hours. (Z. O. @. M., Xv1t, p. 441.)

30. The International Polar Conference held at Vienna April 17, 1884,
arranged for the publication and discussion of the vast mass of obser-
vations accumulated by all nations during 1882~83. The chiefs of nine
expeditions were present. Each country will publish its own results in
full. The conference will publish the general results through experts,
to whom each question is referred. The protocol of the conference fills
the last of the Mittheilungen published by the Polar Commission.

31. The American expedition to Lady Franklin Bay was rescued from
its position at Cape Sabine in June, 1884; only six survived out of the
original twenty-five. The objects of the expedition were fully accom-
plished, the observations and explorations being conducted with remark-
able success for two years, and the health of the party was perfect
the whole time. Lieut. A. W. Greely with perfect success accomplished

visions awaiting him as had been originally contemplated, and, in con-
sequence, nineteen members of the party died during the early part of
1884.

In a general way, Lieutenant Greely reports the lowest temperature
—66° Fahrenheit; the tidal flow came from the north; currents in
the bay coming from the north were two degrees warmer than coming
from the south; the tidal range was 8 feet; there was no poe current
in the open sea fe the north.

The line of perpetual snow on Mount Arthur he places at 3,500 feet.

32. N. Ekholm has published the preliminary account and statistical
summary of the Swedish International Polar Expedition to Spitzbergen.
Observations began August 22, 1882; an anemometer was fixed on the
mountain top 800 feet above the ocean. The aurora borealis occurred
every night up to March 25, when the sunlight interfered. The ther-
mometers in shelter were compared with the sling-thermometer until,
by frequent breakages, the observers were forced to construct an equiv-
alent rotation machine. The station was closed August 25, 1883.
(Nature, XXIx, p. 263.)

33. The Danish Meteorological Institute has published the summary
of the Danish International Polar Expedition to the Sea of Kara.

34. Preliminary reports containing the monthly means and miscella-
neous notes have been published for the two German Polar Stations,
namely, at Royal Bay in South Georgia, and at Kingawa Fjord in Cum-
berland Gulf, Baffin’s Land. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 144.)

35. A. von Danckelman publishes the records for 1882~83 at the
Danish International Polar Station, Godthaab, in order that by com-
parison one may better decide to what extent this was a normal year.

36. hai. J. Lephay, chief of the meteorological work of the Interna-
tional Polar Station at Cape Horn, occupied by the French Government,
publishes a summary of the climate at their station, which was on the
east side of the peninsula Hardy, in a portion of Orange Bay three
French miles from the Pacific and thirty-five northwest from Cape
Horn. The daily period of pressure was quite perceptible, the maxi-
mum being 8 Pp. M. and the minimun 2 p.m. The diurnal periodicity
of the wind force was very large, maximum being at 2 P. M. and mini-
mum at 1 A.M.; the prevailing wind direction was from west-south-
Westin (7.0. G. M.. xIx, palate)

37. H. P. Dawson, in charge of the English International Polar Sta-
tion at Fort Rae, reports that the winter of 1882 and 1883 was very mild-
In January, 1883, a remarkable epidemic influenza was reported among
the Indians in the far northwest, and spread southward to Forts Simp-
son and Rae, attacking every one inamild form. (Nature, XXVIII, p.

northwest winds that sweep down over Manitoba aud the United States,
we shall have to suspect that these epidemics are due to minute organ-
isms carried by the air, possibly in its upper currents, from some equa-
torial region, some such mass of air as is thrown by a hurricane out of
its normal route, or is carried up over the Pacific and thrown against
the Alaska coast only to come down upon the east slope of the Rockies
as a dry wind, or such as is sometimes drawn from Northern Russia
over the Polar Sea, only to flow southward as a cold norther over Brit-
ish America. Thus epidemics and spores, insects, seeds, migratory
birds, volcanic dust, &c., are distributed over the world by the winds
obedient to a complication of rigid laws that invite human energy to
unravel them. |

39. Among the scientific results noted in his preliminary report to
the Royal Society, Capt. H. P. Dawson states that Fort Rae is located
at the southwest extremity of a peninsula that juts out from the north-
east shore of a long gulf running in a northwest direction for more than
100 miles from the northern shore of the Great Slave Lake; it is there-
fore almost entirely surrounded by water. The greatest magnetic dis-
turbance occurred November 17, 1882. Whenever an aurora occurred
in the zenith there was a rapid decrease in vertical and horizontal mag-
netic force. Auroras suitable for measurement of altitude were rare
and lasted only a few seconds; the wind was usually in a southeast or
northwest direction; when the former prevailed the upper clouds showed
a northwest current. (Nature, XXxIx, p. 247.)

40. A. S. Steen gives a preliminary account, in Nature, of the activity
at the Norwegian circumpolar station at Bossekop. Auroras were seen
every night, and accurate measures were taken in conjunction with
others by Dr. Tromholt, at Kautokeino. The thermometer shelter con-
formed to Professor Wild’s model. Psychrometer and dew-point appa-
ratus were frequently observed together. The chemical determinations
of atmospheric moisture were not satisfactory. (Natwre, XX VU, p. 567.)

41. The Russian Government decided to maintain a meteorological
station for some time at Sagastyr on the Lena. The average tempera-
ture of February, 1884, was —33° C., or 8° warmer than 1883. Strong
winds were specially frequent during the last year.

42, A. EB. Nordenskiédld, in letters to Mr. Dickson, gives an account
of his journey into the interior of Greenland, starting from Disco Bay
on July3,1883. Theascent to an elevation of 800 meters took place quite
rapidly ; after that more slowly, until the height 1,492 meters was reached
on July 22. From this point his Lapp escort went eastward six days,
accomplishing about 115 kilometers, reaching a height of 2,000 meters
at a distance about 300 kilometers east of Disco Bay. The whole re-
gion was, of course, a uniform glacier of ice and snow, with occasional
lakes of melted-snow water. (Nature, XX1Tx, pp. 11-39.)

43. Dr. H. Miilry, of Gottingen, in reference to the great problems in
meteorology, states that he is himself most impressed with the impor-

tance of understanding the subject in its widest details as terrestrial
physics, and that the study of the equatorial region should be taken up
in full force as this calm belt is the basis and motive of the whole atmos-
pheric circulation. Whatever may be said as to the importance of
weather predictions or cyclone theories or the tracks of cyclones or
anti-cyclones or climatic and other applications, yet we must avoid the
mistake of treating meteorology from too local or empirical a point of
view. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 407:)

44, |The study of the northers of the Mississippi Valley and Gulf of
Mexico showed as long ago as 1871 that a very slight diminution of
pressure in the tropical regions frequently gives occasion for a southerly
flow of cold air, which, piling up against the northern side of the Mexi-
can Cordilleras, produces a great area of about 8,000 feet deep of cold,
cloudy, and rainy weather, out of which gradually develops a storm that
subsequently moves northward as a hurricane over the United States.
And as a generalization it is suspected that the hurricanes originating
in the Middle Atlantic, whether on the coast of Africa or of South
America, owe their origin in a similar way to an inflow of cool air into
a region where higher temperature, increased moisture, and the forma-
tion of clouds having strongly heated upper surfaces, had conspired to
produce an uprising tendency. In this way it became proper to speak
of the equatorial region as that whose heat was the fundamental cause
not only of the general atmospheric circulation, but of storms and other
special phenomena, and in this way we were prepared for K6ppen’s
demonstration, in 1874, that the solar heat with its variations more di-
rectly atfected the equatorial regions of the earth whence its influence
more slowly spreads to distant latitudes. Now that the International
Polar Commission has given us such a precious collection of data relat-
ing to the higher latitudes north and south, it is undoubtedly incum-
bent upon meteorologists to urge a similar and far more thorough cru-
sade into the torrid zone, where we need a large number of new stations
on land and sea maintained for the whole of, at least, one sun-spot period.
The continuous observations needed in tropic seas could be provided
for if the principal nations of the globe would inaugurate, each in a
selected district of the ocean in the torrid zone, an exhaustive study of
its hydrography, fauna, and ocean currents simultaneous with the ma-
rine meteorological observations. |

45. Dr. M. Miles, as director of the agricultural experiments at Hough-
ton farm, Orange County, New York, has, since 1881, carried out several
distinct lines of investigation mostly relating to animal and vegetable
nutrition. The proprietor of the farm is Mr. Lossing Valentine, a rich
merchant of New York, who desires in this way to contribute something
toward the progress of American agriculture. The work on the con-
nection between meteorology and agriculture is in the hands ef Prof.
D. P. Penhallow, who, among other things, issues daily bulletins or

claimed. The general manager of the farm is Maj. H. EK. Alvord. (Na-
ture, XXIX, p. 238.)

46. Dr. C. Lang, of Munich, describes the establishment of a new
station on the Wendelstein, where observations began on the 8th of
October, 1883. Up to this time the Bavarian weather bureau had no
station higher than the Hohenpeissenberg (994 meters), but has now
taken advantage of the fact that a house for tourists was about to be
established on the Wendelstein (altitude 1817.4 meters). This mount-
ain is 1,062 meters above the valley below it, and, therefore, compara-
tively isolated and steep. In regard to the instruments with which the
station is furnished, we notice that the thermometer shelters are placed
on the east and west sides of the building, because the north side is in-
convenient. The shelters are, however, one meter distance from the
respective walls. Within these shelters are maximum and minimum
thermometers and a thermograph manufactured by Steppacher. The
station also has a rotation psychrometer made by Rung, of Copenha-
gen. For the wind force no instrument is used, but estimates are given
on the 0-12 scale of Beaufort. It is hoped to establish two self-regis-
tering thermometers, one at the top the other at the bottom of the
mountain, and for this purpose probably those manufactured by Rich-
ard, of Paris, will be selected. (Z. O. G. M., XVIII, p. 458.)

47. The Meteorological Office of the Marine Observatory, at San Fer-
nando, in January, 1884, began the issue of daily weather charts and
storm warnings for the Spanish coast.

48. The Italian Meteorological Office has established a mountain
station, at an altitude of 2,160 meters, upon Mount Cymone.

49. The Melbourne Observatory publishes a monthly record of meteor-
ology in Victoria. Attention is called to the work being done in Aus-
tralia, and also to the necessity of more care in reference to certain ther-
mometer records. (Nature, Xxx, p. 126.)

50. The Meteorological Council of London, having decided to close
the primary self-recording observatories at Glasgow, Armagh, Stony-
hurst, and Falmouth, on account of the expense, the authorities at the
latter place have forwarded a remonstrance, strongly supported by
Prof. J. C. Adams, of Cambridge. These observatories have been in
operation since 1868, and if other nations follow the example of Eng-
land in this respect we shall never attain satisfactory knowledge of
local peculiarities in climate or meteorology.

We are, however, glad to have to add that the foundation stone of
the new meteorological observatory at Falmouth was laid August 12,
1884; this was in consequence of a new agreement with the Meteorologi-
cal Office, which will continue its apparatus and work under more favor-
able auspices. (Nature, Xxx, p. 24°.)

51. Frequent notices appear in Nature of the work done on the observ-
atory at Ben Nevis; among others w2 note that Mr. Omond, at the
summit, is conducting a series of observations with a hygrometer of

novel description especially designed by Professor Chrystal; ordinarily
the wet bulb and dry bulb read together, but occasionally the clouds
clear, the sun shines very hot, and the air acquires a marvelous dryness
calculated to test the capabilities of this instrument. (Nature, XXxIx, p.
342.)

Dr. C. L. Wragge gives a description with illustrations of the meteor.
ological observatories on and near Ben Nevis. (Nature, xxvu, p. 487.)

The observatory on Ben Nevis is supported by private subscription
mostly, and it is hoped that means will be forthcoming to maintain ob-
servations during the winter of 1884~’85. (Nature, xxx, p. 179.)

A general summary of the meteorology of Ben Nevis from June, 1881,
to June, 1884, is given by Buchan. (Nature, xxx, p. 336.)

During the winter of 1884-785, new rooms and conveniences for self-
registering wind instruments will be available, over £2,000 sterling
having been spent on the arrangements for observers and visitors to
the summit of Ben Nevis.

52. Dr. W. Doberck, director of the new English observatory at Hong-
Kong, has taken active steps to carry into effect the system of meteor-
ological predictions and observations promised by inspector-general of
Chinese customs, Sir Robert Hart, as long ago as 1873. The instru-
ments were purchased at that time, but have been either injured or un-
packed, and are of course useless. Doberck has compared them and pro-
poses to establish 33 stations, mostly on the Chinese coast, whose ob-
servations shall be published annually, while a daily system of tele-
graphic storm warnings is maintained for the benefit of commerce. (D.
M. Z., 1, p. 86.)

53. The activity of the Hong-Kong Observatory commenced January
1, 1884, with tri-daily meteorological observations, daily and monthly
weather reports. Weather telegrams are daily received from the treaty
ports of China, from Luzon, Japan, Vladivostock, and Tonquin. Self-
registering meteorological observations began April 1; a time-ball will
be dropped after January 1, 1885. An excellent illustrated descrip-
tion of the observatory is given in Nature, xxx. It is suggested that
all observations that can be made available for the formation of a
meteorological system for that section of the world be concentrated by
daily and monthly reports at Hong-Kong as the most important center.
This, however, should not in the least interfere with the remarkably
successful work going on in Japan.

54. The Geographical Society of Lisbon having maintained a tempo-
rary meteorological observatory near the highest point of the Serra da
Kstrella at an altitude of 1,855 meters and a degree and a half east of
Lisbon, the results of the first year of observation have been reported by
A. C. da Silva. Among the principal results are the following: Maxi-
mum pressure at noon, minimum at 5 A. M., while for Coimbra (alti-
tude 141 meters) we have maximum at 10 A. M., minimum at 6 P. M.
As to temperature, Estrella has maximum at 2 P. M., minimum at 4 A.
METEOROLOGY. 273

M., while Coimbra has maximum at 2 P. M., minimum at 5 A.M. The
wind velocity for Estrella has a maximum 30.5 kilometers per hour at 1
P. M., and a minimum 20.2 at 9 P.M. The maximum wind velocity was
65 kilometers per hour at 3 P. M. on August 17, 1882. The prevailing
winds were west and northwest; the average daily evaporation was
15.0 ™™; the heights and forms of clouds were regularly observed; de-
terminations of the altitude and the altitude of cumulus clouds under
which thunder-storms were in progress, gave from 5,450 to 6,750 meters.
(Z. O. G. M., x1x, p. 423.)

55. Prof. J. M. Pernter communicates some of the latest results of
observations on the summit of the Obir (2,048 meters), which show the
following features:

1. The daily temperature curve is above the mean value for only one-
third of the whole day, and attains a maximum at about 2 P. M. in Jan-
uary and 4 P. M. in August.

2. The amplitude is the same for all months of the year, and depends
only on the quantity of sunshine.

3. It must be remembered that the thermometers are on the south
side of the observatory in a space incJosed by a double board screen ;
but provision has been made for a perfect circulation of air, and the
radiation of the screen is cut off by another screen of sheet-tin, and
although all this is not at all satisfactory, and some local influence is
probable, yet it is safe to say that the maximum occurs later at these
high altitudes, in confirmation of which Pernter quotes ten days of
hourly observations on Mount Ararat (3,333 meters).

4, Although in Vienna the west wind bas an enormous preponder-
ance both in frequency and total movement, yet on the Obir the south-
east wind has a decided preponderance, and on the Santis, as Billwiller
has shown, the southwest wind prevails, and the southeast is the least
frequent; must we not, then, conclude that the summit of the Obir lies
within the influence of the Italian area of low pressure, and that it is
too low to reach up into the southwest current that probably prevails
above?

5. The comparison of the sunshine register on the summit with that
at Klagenfurt, near the base of the mountain, shows at the summit a
maximum of sunshine between 10 and 11 A4.M., but at Klagenfurt about
2P. M.

6. The total sunshine on the summit exceeds that in the valley from
October on throughout the winter, but during the summer months
Klagenfurt exceeds the summit; the number of days without sunshine
is about the same. On fourteen days the summit had no sunshine,
while the base had from one to six hours; in general, perfectly sunny
days are more frequent on the summit than in the valley. (7. 0. G. 1,

30, 1883, after a short illness. Having graduated from the Swiss Poly-
technic School, he was engaged until 1871 in railroad and topcgraphic
surveys, in which year he entered into the business of his father-in-law,
the well-known mechanician, Goldschmidt; after his death, in 1875,
Hottinger entirely conducted this business, in association with Dr.
Koppe, until the latter was appointed professor at Brunswick. The
accurate instruments made by this firm are well known throughout
Switzerland, especially the so-called Goldschmidt aneroid barometer,
which in its improved form has in Europe rapidly displaced all other
aneroid and even mercurial barometers for accurate and convenient
use in field surveying. (Z. O. G. M., XVIII, p. 465.).

57. Baron Vice-Admiral von Wiillerstorf-Urbair, born January 29,
1816, at Trieste, died August 10, 1883, at Vienna. By his command of
the frigate Novara on a scientific navigation of the globe, 1857 to 1859,
von Wiillerstorf became well known to the scientific world. He had
previously, from 1839 to 1848, been the director of the Naval Observ-
atory at Venice and professor of astronomy at the Naval Academy.
(Zo OnG. Me XVI, pdb.)

58. Sir Edward Sabine, born at Dublin, October 14, 1788, died near
London, June 26, 1883. At the age of fifteen, after graduating at the
military schools, he entered the English Artillery and attained to the
rank of lieutenant-general in 1850, and general in 1874. His scientific
activity began in 1818, when he became a member of the Royal Society
of London, and was appointed as astronomer to the polar expedition
under Sir John Ross. Until 1827 his principal activity related to me-
teorology and geodesy, but from that time on his life became more com-
pletely devoted to terrestrial magnetism, which subject had, however,
attracted his attention and activity since 1821. His whole work in this
field has marked an epoch in the history of terrestrial physics, and has
also been of the greatest practical value to navigation. The colonial
observatories of Great Britain were for many years under the super-
vision of Sabine, who reduced and published the results. |It is not im-
proper to add that in all this work Lady Sabine has been his most
active’ assistant and colaborer.] (Z. 0. @. M., XVIII, p. 362; Nature,
XC VIL, Pp. 203.)

59. Prof. M. Kowalski, born August 15, 1821, at Dobrzyn, Russia, died
July 9, 1884. In 1850 Kowalski was made assistant astronomer of the
University of Kasan, and in 1854 director of the Observatory. His
memoir on atmospheric refraction shows a thorough knowledge of the
modern theory of distribution of temperature in the air.

60. Prof. J. F. J. Schmidt, born October 25, 1825, in Oldenburg, Ger-
many, died February 7, 1884, at Athens. Schmidt became director of
the Observatory at Athens in December, 1858, and his activity in ad-
vancing our knowledge of the climate of Greece is remarkable, the more
especially when we consider his great labors in astronomy.

among meteorologists in connection with the beautiful and precise in-
struments that have issued from his workshops, and which are widely
used, not only in Austria and Germany, but also in France, England,
Brazil, Turkey, and America.

62. N. H. C. Hoffmeyer, born June 3, 1836, served asamilitary officer,
but resigned (1866) on account of rheumatism, since which time he has
devoted his life to meteorology. In 1872 he founded the Meteorological
Institute of Denmark. He died suddenly on the 16th of February, 1884.

Annalen or Hydrographische Mittheilungen, and for many years as secre-
tary of the Berlin Geographical Association, he has done an important
work for Germany.

an advanced age in Basle. His life has been given to the advance of
Switzerland in many scientific directions. In 1826 as a member of the

vations at Basle, which he did not relinquish until fifty years later.

Princeton, N. J., February, 1884. His investigations on the glaciers,
his hypsometric work in the United States, his meteorological tables,
and other instructions to observers for the Smithsonian Institution, his
works on physical geography and climate, have made his name well
known in meteorology.

68. Prof. J. Hann has published, as one of the series of Allgemeine
Erdkunde, a volume on The Earth as a Planet (Weltkorper), which is
obtainable in separate form. This volume is rich in recent results of
physical study; the form of the earth, the force of gravitation, the mag-
netic phenomena and auroras, and the atmosphere and glacial climate
and the ocean are especially well treated.

69. hk. H. Scott has compiled an Elementary Meteorology, which has
also been translated into German by W. von Freeden and simultane-
ously published at Leipsic. It is divided into two portions, the first
276 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884

treating of the observations and individual phenomena; the second
part treats of the distribution of these phenomena over the earth’s sur-
face. The work claims only to reproduce the best views of the students
of the present day, and therefore introduces but little which can be
called individual. It is undoubtedly one of the best works at present
available in English, but contains some important defects that will, we
hope, be remedied in a treatise by Ferrel on Recent Advancement in
Meteorology, about to be published by the Army Signal Office for the
use of its observers.

70. Hann has published a second edition, in two thin volumes, of
Jelinek’s Introduction to Meteorological Observations; he has added sev-
eral important tables and the description of new important instruments.

71. Prof. P.G. Tait has published two treatises, on Heat and on Light,
respectively, which, as might be expected from this eminent author,
present the best view of the present condition of each subject; the ref:
erences to meteorological applications give these an especial interest
in this place.

72. Excellent elementary books on physics have been published by
Profs. J. D. Everett, of Glasgow; J. Trowbridge, of Cambridge; W. A.
Anthony and C. F. Brackett, of Princeton. That of Professor Trow-
bridge is especially recommended by its thorough fidelity to experi-
mental instruction. The chapter on the atmosphere, barometer, &c., is
most admirable for the younger students of meteorology, the experi-
mental or laboratory side of which science is still susceptible of great
development, as is shown especially by the works of Vettin and Kiess-
ling, elsewhere more fully noted.

73. A. Woeikof, of St. Petersburg, has published a treatise on the
climate of the earth, especially of Russia. Although in the Russian
language, and therefore evidently intended especially for the use of the
Russian universities, this work is of much wider interest because of the
activity of the author in many branches of statistical meteorology.
His work is entirely independent of that of Hann, but it has a very
similar range, and in respect to charts and illustrations is much richer.
There is, however, very little repetition in the two works. The original-
ity of Woeikof appears in every chapter. Undoubtedly the introduction
of the work into the Russian universities will greatly stimulate the
education of meteorologists in that country and place it in advance of
any other nation except possibly Germany in the recognition of this
science as a branch of university study. (Z. O. G.)

73’. [We hope that the progress of meteorology, thus stimulated by the
great work of Woeikof, will not meet with the adverse fortune whick
was indicated by a recent imperial decree of August 4, 1884, by virtue
of which the scientific works of Darwin, Agassiz, Huxley, Lubbock,
Adam Smith, Spencer, and many others have been proscribed; cireu-
lating libraries will not deliver them to their subscribers, and book-
dealers will not sell them,]
METEOROLOGY. yd Cf (

74. Dr. A. Woeikof contributes a valuable study on the climate of
Eastern Siberia, showing that one part of Eastern Siberia is entirely in
the monsoon region of Hastern Asia, while the other portion can be
considered as the northern limit of this same monsoon region. Among
other things he shows (1) for the greater part of Eastern Siberia that
since the greatest cold occurs with calms and feeble winds, therefore the
valleys and lowlands are in winter colder than the high lands; (2) the
temperature of isolated hills is still higher; (3) the cooling of the val-
leys is so long continued and intense that even the temperature of the
year is lower there, as proved by the observed temperature of the
ground; (4) the depth of the frozen earth is greater in the valleys than
on the neighboring highlands, probably also greater than on the high
mountains; (5) inthe Tundra of the extreme north the winter is warmer
than in the valleys of the forest regions of the south, probably because
the strong winds prevent the long stagnation of the coldest low stratum
of air. (D. Mf. Z., I, p. 448.)

75. The Austrian Hydrographie Office has published a hand-book of
oceanography and maritime Meteorology, in which the separate chap-
ters are composed by distinguished Austrian scholars; the whole forms
a remarkable monument to the industry of the authors and to the
progress that is being made in everything that relates to the ocean and
its navigation. The first division of these two large volumes relates to
the physiography of the sea, including instruments for measuring the
depth and the currents, the waves, the chemical constituents, and a
summary of the results of all the work done in these departments.
The second division, on maritime meteorology, occupies about 400 pages,
and is compiled by Prof. F. Attlmayer, of the Naval Academy. (Z. 0.
G.. M., XXX, p. 349.)

76. Prof. H. Mohn gives a summary of the climate of Norway, based
principally upon recent observations conducted in a uniform manner
with well-verified instruments. The altitudesfor the stations seem gen-
erally to have been determined barometrically. A permanent baromet-
ri¢ minimum exists southwest of Iceland, and another, not so deep,. in
the Norwegian Sea. From October to April a maximum prevails over
the southwestern part of Norway. From May to September in South-
western Norway a minimum exists. The isobars, like the isotherms,
Show a great tendency to follow the trend of the coast. (7. O. G. ML,
XIX, p. 145.)

77. Dr. C. Lang, of Munich, publishes in the fourth volume of Obser-
vations at Bavarian stations an exhaustive monograph on the climate
of Munich, a work so complete that scarcely another can be found to
compare with it. The observations extend from 1781 to 1880. Among
the numerous tabular and statistical results, Dr. Lang occasionally in-
troduces matter of general interest, such as his discussion as to what
constitutes a raw and unpleasant climate.

78, {In regard to this we are of the opinion that ordinary meteorologi-

cal statisties will afford very little satisfaction. The sensations which
human beings call “raw,” “harsh,” “depressing,” &c., are subjective, and
are compounds of several factors, such as temperature, moisture, wind,
sunshine. Moreover, a locality that offers a few hours of such raw
climate every day is not likely to be detected by observations at three
hours only. The meteorologist is primarily interested in the physics and
mechanics of the atmosphere, not in its influence on human sensations ;
that belongs to hygiene and demands a special apparatus and obser-
vations, a fine example of which is to be found in the work on subjec-
tive climate undertaken by J. R. Osborne, of Washington, from 1575 to
1817.]° (Z.O.G. M.,, XTX, p.240:)

79. Pschrewalski’s observations in Thibet have enabled him to locate
the region of the sources of the Hoang Ho as that to which penetrate
both the southwest monsoon from the Indian Ocean and the southeast
monsoon from the Pacific coast of China. He also establishes the diur-
nal and annual variations of temperature, the former being remarkably
large, amounting in some cases to from 20°C. at the midday maximum
to —30° © at the morning minimum. Very interesting dustwhirls were
observed and sketched. The transportation of dust by strong winds
fully confirms Von Richthofen’s theory of the formation of the loess.
(Z. O. G. M., XvuI, p. 303.)

80. Prof. J. Partsch, of Breslau, contributes a summary of our knowl-
edge of the climate of Greece, based largely on the extensive collection
of data made by the late Prof. J. F. J. Schmidt. (2. O. G. M., XIX, p.
473.)

81. Lehmann has compiled a complete list of the literature relative to
the meteorology of Thuringia; he takes as his starting point the titles
given by Hellmann. Similar works for many other sections of the world
are desirable.

82. Zéppritz has brought together the meteorological results of a num-
ber of expeditions by Americans and others to the Central American
regions. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 362.)

83, A. Angot, of Paris, has published a valuable study on the climate
of Algeria, especially the temperature, pressure, and rainfall. The mean
temperature for the year varies from 17.7 C., on the northern coast, to
21.1 ©., on the southern border, namely, at the limit of the Sahara, in
latitude 349.1. The monthly ranges are as follows: On the coast, a min-
imum in January (11.4) and maximum in August (25.0); on the southern
border, a minimum in January (10.4) and maximum July (34.1). We
see from this that the temperature increase, especially in summer, as we
proceed southward, is due not to latitude but to the continental pecui-
arities of the soil, the cloudless sky, and the direction of the wind. (Z.
On GMa XIx,p. 64.)

84. Dr. W. Képpen collects together the date of first and last rains at
various points on the southwest coast of Africa as recorded in various
years from 1874 to 1883. The beginning of the rainy season varied from
METEOROLOGY. 279

the 24th of July to 12th of October; the last rain is recorded at dates
between the 1st of May and 8th of June. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 237.)

85. A. von Danckelman, as a member of the expedition of the Inter-
national Congo Association, has returned to Europe with a series of
meteorological observations for fifteen months on the west coast of
Africa. He reports that the barometric changes were quite slight, the
yearly range being 12”™. No perceptible change in pressure occurred
during the occurrence of the tornadoes peculiar to that coast. The
rainy season is from April to November, during which numerous short,
heavy thunder-storms precipitate a great quantity of rain, the heaviest
being 102"™ in two hours. The thunder-storms come from the north-
east; the surface wind blows from the point where the thunder-storm
is. During the dry season the natives set fire to the grass-covered
plains; these fires continue for months and have an important meteor-
ological influence; the air is always full of smoke ; great cumulus clouds
and occasional lightning form over the burning regions, which cover
many thousand square miles. The most remarkable phenomenon in the
valley of the Congo is the frequent occurrence at night-time of a strong
southwest wind; it begins soen after sunset and occasionally lasts until
the early morning hours. (Z. O. G@. M., XIX, p. 88.)

86. The Physical Society of London has republished the scientifie
papers of J. P. Joule. The present first volume contains about 100
papers, many of them bearing on questions of the utmost importance to
meteorology.

87. [We have now accessible reprints of the scientific papers of Sir
William Thomson, Professor Stokes, Joule, Helmholtz, Kirchoff, and
many other scientific names of living men. To meteorology, however,
nothing would be more acceptable than a reprint of the meteorological
papers of Joseph Henry, William Redfield, and James P. Espy. Will
not some American scientific association do for us what the Physical
Society has done for England ?|

88. Dr. G. Hellmann has published his Repertorium of German Me-
teorology, in which he gives a very complete bibliography of the pub-
lications, discoveries, and observations made by Germans in the field of
meteorology and terrestrial magnetism down to the end of the year 1881,
Holding himself to a very strict understanding of the word “German,”
Hellmann has omitted the productions of Germans not citizens of Ger-
many, and we especially miss the publications of German scientists in
Austria, Switzerland, Russia, and elsewhere. Hellmann’s work is di-
vided into four principal sections: First, a catalogue by authors; sec-
ond, subject index; third, index of stations aud meteorological data;
fourth, a historical sketch of meteorological progress in Germany.

89. [It was perhaps only by holding closely to this restriction that
Hellmann was able to finish his large work in so short a time and pre-
sent it as a realization of a single idea. But as has been remarked, one
cannot but feel in using it at every moment that there is here a mass of
280 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

broken threads which need to be completed by making a similar collec-
tion of not only the remaining German, but all other meteorological lit-
erature. General W.B. Hazen, having decided that in view of the im-
portance of the subject the Signal Office should complete the index to
meteorological literature already in its possession in the shape of a
large card catalogue, has solicited contributions of titles from all inter-
ested in the subject, and has appointed Mr. C. J. Sawyer as biblio-
graphic expert to prepare the work for publication. ~The office will also
make a special examination of various important libraries, serials, and
other sources. As this work is, properly speaking, only a hand-book for
the use of working meteorologists, it has been deemed most desirable to
finish it in a short time without incurring such delay as might be needed
to prepare a work of bibliographic elegance. Consequently the major-
ity of the titles will be taken from Reuss, Poggendorf, the Royal So-
ciety, Hellmann, Symons, and other authorities without directly con-
sulting the volumes themselves. It is expected that the work will
occupy two volumes containing forty or fifty thousand titles in all, and
that a first part will go to press early in 1886.]

90. Prof. Frank Waldo, of Washington, in a short note on the study
of meteorology in Europe, shows that in 1885 out of thirty-eight German
universities only fourteen had established special chairs for this study.
In respect to this Dr. KOéppen remarks that probably this neglect had
already been partially rectified by 1884. The following is a list of those
who are more or less devoted to instruction of this class (D. M. Z., 1, p.

92. The very hopeful condition of the study of meteorology in Eng-
land is evidenced by the following subject announced for the Adams
prize to be adjudged in 1885: Investigate the laws governing the in-
teraction of cyclones and anticyclones on the earth’s surface. In order
to give precision to this the following suggestions are given to the ex-

aminers : An infinite plane has a surface density J “ (where g is gravity);

on one side of it is air in equilibrium, the ae of which must di-
minish according to the barometric law as we recede from the plane.
The system revolves as a rigid body, about an axis perpendicular to the
plane, with a constant angular velocity @.

If one or more vortices with a revolution either consentaneous with
@ (cyclones), or adverse thereto (anticyclones), be established in the air,
investigate their motions. It may be well to consider the axes of the
vortices either straight or curved, and perpendicular or inclined to the
plane. If possible, pass to the case in which the vortices exist in the
atmosphere surrounding a rotating globe. (Nature, XxIx, p. 94.)

93. Prof. W. J. Beal, of the State Agricultural College at Lansing,
Mich., in his address on the needs of agriculture before the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, says that if specific warn-
ings of the weather had been given during the harvest of 1882 most of
the wheat might have been safely housed and the farmers of Michigan
saved from a loss of a million dollars. (Natwre, XXvitt, p. 618.)

94, H. F. Blanford gives an illustration of the general character of
long range weather predictions by quotations from the India Gazette,
282 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

June 2, 1883, wherein he gives reasons for believing that the prospects
for sufficient rain in India and Bengal during the rest of the season
were wholly favorable. This and subsequent predictions in July and
August were based upon the knowledge of snowfall in the Himalayas.
(Nature, XX1X, p. 77.)

95. O. L. Madsen, in the interest of meteorology and European weather
prediction, urges the importance of the proposed transatlantic cable,
whose route will be through Thurso, the Faroes, Iceland, Julianshaab
in Greenland, the Straits of Belle Isle, and Quebec. The German news-
papers announce that this cable will be laid by a company already or-
ganized; but although this is probably an error, yet there seems no
doubt but that such a cable will be a profitable investment from a busi-
ness point of view, and will be of the highest importance in the predic-
tion of storms, not only for the use of Europe, but especially for the use
of navigators about to sail westward from those ports. (D. M. Z., I,
p. 410.)

96. The British Meteorological Office has entered into an arrangement
with the Signal Office by which telegraphic warning is sent to British
ports of the existence of any storm in the middle of the North Atlantic
into which English vessels are likely to enter unawares.

97. R. Abercromby, W. Marriott, Lieut. H. H. C. Dunwoody, and Prof.
H. H. Hildebrandsson, of Stockholm, have all recently published collec-
tions of popular sayings in reference to the weather. The latter espe-
cially expresses the following conclusions: (1) Any relation between the
weather and the days of the week, or holidays, or the positions of the
heavenly bodies, or the phases of the moon is absurd; (2) any predic-
tion of the temperature of any year or month is impossible in the pres-
ent state of our knowledge, and popular signs looking to such predic-
tions are without value; (3) in general, it is desirable for vegetation and
harvest that the seasons should have their normal temperature, rainfall,
&e., and that is about what is attempted by all popular rules ; (4) there
are a number of rules for the prediction of the weather a short time in
advance, some of which are quite safe. (Z. O. G. M., xx, p. 311.)

§8. RK. Abercromby presents a summary of prevailing weather types
for use in predictions in Western Europe. (Nature, XXVIII, p. 330.)

99. E. Gelcich communicates the rules promulgated by P. Jauva, di-
rector of the Observatory at Manila, for the prediction of hurricanes.
During the years 1877 to 1880 Jauva has successfully predicted forty
storms. The following are his rules for Manila:

1. If the barometer at the time of the afternoon minimum, namely,
between 3.15 and 3.30, falls to 755™™, or if it exceeds 757 at the time
of the morning maximum, namely, from 9.10 to.9.20, then one ean defi-
nitely conclude that a cyclone prevails within a few hundred miles.

2. If at the time when the barometer should rise, namely, from 4 to 9
A. M., or from 4 to 9 P. M., it is observed to fall, then the cyclone is mov-
METEOROLOGY. 283

ing towards the observer’s station, and he may expect its greatest se-
verity.

3. If the barometer is stationary the cyclone is moving towards the
observer, but its greatest severity will not reach him.

4. Ordinarily we observe high cirrus clouds when the cyclone is still
600 miles distant; these stretch out towards a definite point in the hor-
izon and form cirrus strata that converge towards this point. If, now,
we observe at equal intervals of time the direction of the vanishing
point of the cirri and the height of the barometer, we may avail our-
selves of the following rules: If the vanishing point is in the second
quadrant and quite stationary, the cyclone is moving towards the ob-
server, and we can estimate the probable severity of the storm by attend-
ing to the barometer in connection with the above three rules. If the
vanishing point changes its position, the observer is outside of the trajec-
tory of the storm; if it moves towards the south and east or towards
the northeast and north, then the storm will pass by the observer on the
south or the north side, respectively. (2. O. G. M., Xviil, p. 230.)

100. Mr. Herve Mangon, of Paris, president of the committee of the
French Central Meteorological Bureau, reports that 83 per cent. of the
predictions published by that bureau have been acknowledged good, and
that of the storm warnings 51 per cent. were wholly verified, 33 partly
verified, and 21 failed. (Nature, xxvil, p. 539.)

101. Dr. J. Lugli has compared the weather predictions made at the
Central Office at Rome with the resulting weather very much after the
manner adopted by the Signal Office, and gives the following percent-
ages of verification for the three years 1880, 1881, 1882: For cloudiness,
84 per cent.; the condition of the sea, 78 per cent.; direction and force
of the wind, 74 per cent.; thunder-storms, 66 per cent.; temperature, 68
per cent.; general weather, 72 per cent.; storm signals, 74 per cent. (Z.
O. G. M., XIX, p. 463.)

102. Dr. B. Overzier, of Cologne, having undertaken to publish
weather predictions for each day one month in advance, these have
been examined and verified by Dr. Assmann, by comparison with actual
experience. In general, Dr. Assmann allows him 18 per cent. of verifi-
cations as to the velocity of the wind, 40 per cent, for cloudiness, 26
per cent. for rain, 24 per cent. for temperature, and 23 for thunder-
storms.

103. [{t would seem that Germany is troubled like America, where
Vennor and Wiggins have for a long time vexed the public. The real
remedy evidently consists in a better education of the public. When
every person comes to understand that weather predictions do not de-
pend upon astronomical configurations, but upon the solution of com-
plicated problems, in which the topography and rotation of the earth,
the moisture in the air, and the solar heat are the principal factors, they
will, it is to be hoped, have learned to distinguish between the true
meteorologists and the ordinary weather prophet of the almanac, even
284 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

as they have already learned to distinguish between the educated pro-
fessional physician and the uneducated quack.| (Z. O. G. M., XVIII, p.
383.)

104. Dr. A. Winkelmann states that in his previous work he showed
the results of verifying rain predictions by considering only how many
stations within the prescribed region for which the predictions were
made had rain at the appointed time. From this he showed how,
with the help of the knowledge thus obtained, we can so define the
boundaries of the regions for which predictions are made that the
separate stations in each group should have the greatest uniformity of
weather. He showed that a verification of or agreement as to rainfall
occurred at 85 per cent. of the stations, and that if all were divided into
two groups the most advantageous arrangement could possibly only give

7 percent. In this work Winkelmann had considered only the oceur-
rence of rain without considering its quantity. He now offers a short
study on the agreement of stations in any region as to the quantity of
rain, or what per cent. of the total annual precipitation falls on those
days for which these stations show a behavior different from that at
the majority of stations. To this purpose he selects thirteen stations
in Wiirtemberg, and first shows that for any station on 85.5 per cent. of
days its weather agrees with that of the majority of stations. He then
shows that the total rain that falls on the remaining 14.5 per cent. of
the days amounts only to 5.49 per cent. of the total rainfall of the year;
and, again, that on a rainy day at any station, which is also a rainy day
for a majority of the stations, there falls 4.81 times as much rain as on
a day when its rainfall is not accompanied by rain at other stations.
He finally urges the importance of hourly or self registers, one of which
he has constructed. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 387.)

105. W. Koéppen, at the first regular meeting of the German Meteoro-
logical Association, Hamburg, November 18, 1883, gave a short account
of his new method of verifying weather predictions. In the same man-
ner aS we examine the connection between different phenomena of na-
ture, so can we investigate the connection between predicted and actual
weather. Thus, if we count how often after a given prediction the
weather has any one of the several given characters, then must this elas-
sification show whether there really was any scientific base for the pre-
diction; if there was no such basis the numbers indicating the actual
weather would show an entire independence of the prediction if a suffi-
cient number of cases be examined. His examples show that the tem-
perature predictions from day to day were sufficiently verified to justify
the belief in a rational system of predictions, but the predictions from
month to month afford no such conclusion. (D. M. Z., 1, pp. 39, 40.)

106. The Deutsche Seewarte states that our present methods of veri-
fying weather predictions, which had their origin in America [namely
at the Signal Office in 1871], and which have been used in Germany since
1877, consist in this, that the individual predictions are analyzed into
METEOROLOGY. 285

their elements, the latter compared with the resulting facts arranged
in a series of from three to five categories, according to the proportion of
their verification, and from these the percentage of verified and not veri-
fied is computed. The verification has, therefore, the character of a
judgment or opinion; the arbitrariness that occurs in the grouping of
the separate values can be very much limited by the exact prescription
of the terms allowed to be used in the predictions, but it remains very
difficult to remove all option, and the effort greatly increases the diffi-
culty of making the verification. Still more difficult is it to make veri-
fications for different regions of prediction, in order to obtain comparable
figures that will give bases for estimating the success of the predictions
within these districts, the value of the so-called local influences [and
the relative ability of different persons who make predictions]. Espec-
ially has the present method the great objection that no account is taken
of the doctrine of chances, and it is chance especially that must be taken
into consideration in estimating the success or failure of a weather pre-
diction; it is evident that this accidental chance of success is, however,
not 50 per cent., as some are occasionally liable to assume, but the per-
centage due to chance must lie within very wide limits, according to the
frequency of the occurrence of any meteorological phenomena; for ex-
ample, predictions of thunder-storms which are verified to less than 30
per cent. can be very good, while predictions of wind force, whose veri-
fication can exceed 80 per cent., may be worse than if they had been
based only upon the well-known general character of the weather of the
season. Forinstance, K6ppen’s table shows that if we had for the whole
summer uniformly predicted light and moderate winds, we would have
attained nearly 100 per cert and have avoided three mistakes out of
the five predictions of fresh or strong winds; on the other hand, out
of 32 predicted thunder-storms 10, or 31 per cent., occurred, and 22, or
69 per cent., failed, but had we made predictions by chance we should
have attained 22 per cent. of verifications. There is, therefore, need of
some method which will give assurance whether and how far this class
of predictions is based upon a real foundation. A method has been pro-
posed by Dr. K6ppen and has been tested by application to predictions
for June, July, and August, 1584. In this method of verifying, the pre-
dictions for the northwest division of Germany as published in the daily
bulletin are compared directly with the observations at the Hamburg
Seewarte. The temperature observations are divided into three classes,
according as they are more than 2° below or above, or in agreement
with the normal for the month (or possibly the day). The temperature
changes in twenty-four hours are divided into three classes, according
as the thermometers have fallen or risen more than 1° or remained in-
variable. Cloudiness is classified as clear, cloudy, and overcast; strength
of wind is classified as feeble or moderate, fresh or heavy, stormy. ‘The
wind direction and weather are similarly divided. The verifications are
summed up in tables which show that the predictions are based upon
286 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

correct knowledge, since pure chance would otherwise give the same
number of verifications and failures in each of the classes. (D. M. Z.,
1. p. 397.)

107. [We are not able to see any radical difference between the exact
method here proposed by Dr. K6ppen and the actual experience of the
Signal Office since 1873, at which time the expressions allowed to be
used in prediction and the method of verifying began to be reduced to
rules which have remained in force, except a slight steady change to-
ward greater severity. We do not understand that by choosing Ham-
burg as an example by which to verify predictions for Northwest Ger-
many, he means to imply that in a perfect system one should not take
a number of other stations in Northwest Germany, going through a sim-
ilar process of verifications for each one and take the average of the
whole as representing the general percentage of verification for the
whole district; this latter is essentially the process used for each of
the districts recognized by the Signal Office. These districts were at-
tempted to be so limited geographically that the average chance of ver-
ification at any one station (85 per cent.) should be equal to the average
uniformity of geographical distribution of any one feature of the weather
over that district,which latter was also estimated at about 85 per cent.,
and although these limits were fixed in 1871 they have not needed ma-
terial change. The criterion just mentioned is evidently that which
will give us the greatest economy in the use of words to predict the
weather for the whole of a large territory like the United States. It
was considered incumbent upon the predictor to distinctly predict for
twenty-four hours in advance in regard to the weather, wind-direction,
temperature, and pressure changes for every portion of the country, and
yet but rarely more than twenty minutes of time was available for this
prediction owing to the late hour (11 P. M.) when the observations were
made and the imperatve necessity of finishing the predictions by 1 A. M.
The necessity for the utmost economy of time and words thus led to the use
of districts and their limitations in accordance with the above principle. |

as we see that it has lately been set up in connection with the Interna-
tional Exhibition at Turin, where short ascents are made, as at Paris and
London. Father Denza proposes to have meteorological observations
taken from the balloon. (Nature, Xxx, p. 151.)

(Nature, XXVU, p. 370.)

111. [Almost the only way to get a physically clean surface of glass
is by heating it in concentrated sulphurie acid, to which a little nitric
acid has been added, and then heating, after washing with pure water
to remove the acid; such a glass surface exposed to the air for a short
time is generally imperfectly wetted by water. The hygroscopic prop-
erties of physically clean surfaces probably need full elucidation be-
fore the dew-point apparatus can become a perfectly accurate physical
apparatus. |

112. H. Kapeller has modified the construction of his combined maxi-
mum and minimum thermometer so as to secure the greatest simplicity
and still accomplish a transportable, safe, and economical instrument.
(Z. O. G. M., XVIII, p. 225.)

113. Dr. R. Lenz described a method of utilizing the telephone for
the measurement of temperatures at distant points which is applicable
up to distances of 25 kilometers. (Nature, xxx, p. 346.)

114. Prof. William Forster describes some results of investigations
into accuracy of thermometers carried out by the German Normal Stand-
ards Commission. Passing from the errors of the mercurial thermome-
ter he considered the air thermometer, and showed that the chemical
composition of the glass bulb affects even that, as experiments showed
that all gases are more or less absorbed by the glass, and the more so
the longer the gas remains in contact with the inner wall of the bulb,
thus affecting the result among the hundredths of a degree. (Nature,
XXX, p. 652.) :

115. Prof. R. Weber has made a most laborious examination of the
influence of the chemical constituents of the glass upon the depression
of the freezing point of thermometers; he finds the best results with a
pure potash alkaline glass free from soda, and itis probable that he will
be able to construct a special glass in which the troublesome source of
error is reduced to a minimum. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 286.)

116. O. Pettersson, of Stockholm, proposes improved methods for
measurement of heat, namely, that the measurements should be made
at aconstant temperature and that the ice calorimeter of Bunsen should
be improved by directly transforming the heat into work. In order to
maintain a constant temperature he had recourse to a thermometric
combination which proved unsatisfactory and substituted a method of
measuring the work done by isothermic expansion of air. In this way he
is able to measure the mechanical effect of radiations the caloric energy
of which was only 0.08 gramme-calorie per minute. (Nature, XXX, p.
321.)

117. Mr. G. M. Whipple, of Kew, communicates preliminary results
as to the discrepancies between various black bulbs in vacuo; he finds
that among other things the effect of successively increasing the thick-
ness of the coat of lamp-black is to raise the temperature, and that the

(Nature, XX1x, p. 208.)

118. J. T. Bottomly communicated to the Montreal meeting of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science, the preliminary
results of a course of experiments on the loss of heat by radiation and
convection for bodies of different dimensions. His experiments are
made on wires of different sizes both covered and bare, both in ordi-
nary air and very rarefied air, the wire being heated by an electric cur-
rent; he finds that, other things being the same, the smaller the wire
the greater the emissivity ; for a diminution of air pressure the emis-
sivity decreases slowly down to one-half or one-third of the ordinary
air pressure, after which it becomes very great as the vacuum becomes
more complete. (Nature, XXX, p. 523.)

119. Dr. Maurer, of Zurich, contributes a study on the application of
air thermometers to meteorological observations. He employed a thin
polished cylindrical copper vessel 5° in diameter and 44°™ long, and
also a thin brass cylinder 10° radius; in each receptacle was hermet-
ically sealed a normal mercurial thermometer and the copper vessel
then filled with pure dry air. This was then established in a double-
louvre thermometer shelter of sheet zine in which were also two mer-
curial thermometers, the whole being constructed entirely in accordance
with the results of Professor Wild’s investigations into the proper
method of thermometer exposure for thedetermination of the tempera-
ture of the air.

The two free thermometers at a distance of 25°" from each other
agreed always within one or two tenths of a degree, but with regard
to the thermometers within the metallic receptacle the following may
be noted: If the temperature variations are slight and always slowly,
steadily, rising or falling, then the inclosed thermometers follow these
changes quite rapidly ; if the temperature changes are rapid and large,
followed by a constant temperature, the receptacles also follow closely ;
but if the changes are rapid in opposite directions, as happens in thunder-
storms, partly cloudy weather, or alternating calms and winds, then
there is no agreement whatever between the free and the inclosed ther-
mometers, differences of one or more degrees being quite common. He
therefore concludes that all records with such self-registering air ther-
mometers must be accepted with great caution, as they frequently give
results that have no scientific value. From a theoretical point of
view it can be easily shown, as he has done, that the conduction of heat
alone will bring the thermometers to equilibrium in about four minutes
if inclosed within a brass sphere as above and exposed to a sudden
change of air temperature of one degree. (Z. O. G. M., XVII, p. 334.)

120. Dr. C. Lang, of Munich, describes the simple method of deter-
METEOROLOGY. 289

mining the tem perature of lakes, springs, and rivers at slight depths as
adopted at the Bavarian stations. [As similar observations are made
at all the Signal Service stations, and are desirable for all parts of the
world, it is well to establish uniform rules and methods.] In Bavaria,
as in the United States, a small metallic vessel is lowered to the desired
depth, filled with water, and brought to the surface. The thermometer
being always in place within the vessel, the reading should be made as
soon as possible after pulling the apparatus up. Among the precau-
tions to be observed, the most important is the necessity for allowing
the whole apparatus to remain in the water at the proper depth for a
sufficiently long time before the observation is to be made. Since the
water penetrates into all parts of the apparatus as it is lowered into
position, we shall obtain only an average indefinite temperature datum
unless the whole is left at the proper depth until the water and the metal
attain the proper temperature; in fact, it is best to leave the apparatus
in the water for the whole.time intervening between two observations.
With the apparatus used in Bavaria Dr. Lang finds that two or three
minutes, at least, are required before the thermometer within the case
experiences any change of temperature, after being taken out of the
water. (Z. O. G. M., XVIII, p- 367.)

121. A. Angot, of Paris, publishes in theannalsof the Central Meteor-
ological Bareau a new determination of the constant of the psychrome-
ter formula, based on 3,670 comparisons with dew-point apparatus, and
made partly at Paris, and partly on the summit of the Puy-de-Dome.
He finds that the value of A varies with the difference t—t’/, and con-
structs tables accordingly.

122. [The results of Angot’s work seem still to require revision in
order to adapt the formula to the extreme conditions which are found
in the United States. It has, therefore, been found necessary to pur-
sue an extensive further system of observations at Washington, Pike’s
Peak, and Yuma, the results of which will be eventually deduced by
Professor Ferrel, of the Signal Office, who has already completed a
thorough analytical study of the theory of the psychrometer. It is,
however, evident that the various forms of dew-point apparatus have
also peculiar systematic errors, and our next attention must be given to
these. |

123. A. Sprung suggests a new method for determining the dew-
point. He says, correctly, that it is difficult to determine the exact
moment when condensation begins in the ordinary use of the Regnault
apparatus, and especially when the temperatureis below freezing. He
suggests that it would be much more convenient and safe to observe
the moment of condensation when the cooling of the air takes place,
not in a thin layer, but through its whole mass, so that the condensed
vapor shall appear as fog. He proposes to produce this condensation
by a rapid change of volume, using a small air-pump, connecting with
it a cylindrical receiver whose ends are closed with brass plates; the

290 “SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

piston of the pump to have its motion limited by a motionless screw so
that the exact amount of its motion and consequently of the expansion
and cooling of the air can easily be determined.

124. [Espy’s nepheloscope seems to have realized Sprung’s idea.
Many observations with it are given in Espy’s works.] (Z. 0. G. M.,
XVIII, p. 403.)

125. Professor Crova, in the Meteorological Bulletin of the depart-
ment of Hérnault, gives some examples of the use of his new form of
dew point apparatus known as the hygrometer with interior condensa-
tion. The advantage of this method consists in this, that the precipi-
tation is not influenced by the currents of air, which by their strength
and variability interfere with Regnault’s apparatus. Even with the
greatest dryness of the air Crova’s apparatus gives good results when
Regnault’s refuses to work. In the illustrative observations given by
Crova we find, as was to be expected, that Regnault’s apparatus gives
dew-points too low by as much as 19.6 C. (Z. O. G. M., X1x, p. 45.)

126. R. H. Scott has published the results of observations made in
different forms of thermometer shelters and at different altitudes for the
purpose of determining the influence of these circumstances upon the
recorded temperature and moisture of the air.

127. [As a means of deciding on therelative merits of various methods
of exposure of thermometers this important series of observations lacks
one essential, namely, simultaneous observations of the true tempera-
ture of the air of each locality taken by some method whose theory can
be accurately investigated; this essential has lately been supplied by
Ferrel’s studies into the theory of the ordinary thermometer, the whirl-
ing psychrometer, and other apparatus. ]

128. Taking these records as they stand, Hann shows that the daily
range of temperature diminishes with the height above ground by an
amount equal to 19.3 C.,in the annual means for exposures, respectively,
10 and 129 feet above the earth. The lower exposures invariably show
a higher vapor tension and dew-point than the upper, but the relative
humidity has no such regularity. Classifying the observations accord-
ing to the conditions of the sky, as being either perfectly clear or per-
fectly cloudy, rainy or foggy, he finds that at all times of day, winter
and summer, during fog the temperature increases with the altitude.
The differences between temperatures at high and low stations are small-
est during rain. During clear weather, in the evening, the temperature
increases with the altitude, but at mid-day it diminishes rapidly; at 9
A. M., in clear weather, in winter, it is warmer above than below. (Z.°
OG M.; XVIII, ps ooo.)

129. Dr. R. Assmann in some remarks upon the sling-psychrometer,
states that an observation of the temperature of air perfectly free from
objectionable features is a matter of the greatest rarity in meteorology ;
so difficult is it to attain a thoroughly satisfactory exposure. Until re-
cently (and even now in many Prussian, English, American, and other
METEOROLOGY. 291

stations) the thermometer is hung in the open air against the wall of
some house, entirely unprotected from rain and radiation and without
any uniform altitude above the earth’s surface. Even the most carefuy
observations (made in the large thermometer shelter of the Magdeburg
observatory, constructed according to all the rules of the art according to
Wild’s plans) show that many errors are still apparent which interfere with
the general reliability of thismethod. During the rapid changes at sun-
rise and sunset the thermometer in the Wild shelter is very much behind
the true temperature, especially in calm weather. The wooden louvre
work and the quiescent air within require an appreciable time to change
their temperature; moreover, we do not wish the temperature of amass
of air thus inclosed, but that of the free air as affected by radiation.
It is necessary that the thermometer should give the temperature of the
air with the greatest accuracy, and yet follow the temperature changes
with great rapidity ; it must be protected from radiation and rain. The
temperatue must be independent of incidental local surroundings, the
method must be available with the cheapest possible apparatus, and he
concludes that the sling-thermometer, hitherto but little used in Ger-
many, is the best and most appropriate for general use. It is to a high
degree sensitive, the injurious influence of calms is overcome by its
rapid movements through the air; the radiation has almost no influence
upon it; even in the full sunlight it can be easily protected from rain;
the observer can choose a shady place, and the apparatus is the cheapest
imaginable. Still more is all this true of the psychrometer, which as it
is now generally used is acknowledged to be the most uncertain instru-
ment in meteorology. It is easy for the observer to give the sling-psy-
chrometer such a linear velocity that it will be brought down to the
proper temperature in a few seconds; some experiments by Assmann
show that it required only one-ninth of the time given to a stationary
psychrometer, the velocity used by him being 6 meters per second. The
form of sling-psychrometer recommended by Assmann is manufactured
by Fuess of Berlin; it consists of two delicate mercurial thermometers
divided to one-half degrees; these are mounted upon a fork-shaped
wooden stand through which a silk thread is drawn. The price complete
is 13 marks. (Z. O. G. M., XIx, p. 154.)

130. [The sling-psychrometer, in a well-contrived shape, was issued
by the late Dr. T. Craig, of the Surgeon-General’s Office, in 1868, to all
the observers at Army posts, where it is probably now in occasional use.
Numerous experiments with various forms of this instrument have been
made by Prof. H. A. Hazen at the Army Signal Office during the past
few years, and it is evident that either it or the whirled thermometer or
the ventilation psychrometer are the only ones that ean be recommended
for accurate observations, as it is thoroughly essential that a nearly
uniform rapid current of air should flow past the thermometer. |

131. Prof. H. Wild makes a lengthy reply to Dr. Assmann’s communi-
cation and gives in full his own views as to the present condition of our
292 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

knowledge of the methods of determining the temperature and moisture
of the air. He lays it down as a criterion by which to judge of the ex-
cellence of any thermometer shelter, that if we place within the shelter
a ventilating apparatus and read the thermometers both with and with-
out ventilation then the exposure is satisfactory if on the average no
greater difference occurs than +0°.1 C. He then states that the ex-
periments demonstrate that the motion of the thermometer through the ~
air as in the rotation and the sling thermometers or the movement of the
air past the thermometer, as in the Italian ventilated thermometer, is
a much less effectual method of overcoming the effects of radiation than
is the simple protection of the thermometer in a properly constructed
shelter such as his own. [The actual effect of each has been pretty
thoroughly studied by Ferrel and Hazen.| He recommends urgently
the avoidance of large wooden shelters or other masses of wood, as they
must retard the temperature changes.

132. [In 186566 the present writer, while residing at Poulkova Ob-
servatory and studying atmospheric refraction, constructed a ther-
moneter screen of oiled paper, which is possibly still there, and placed
within it bright and black bulb thermometers side by side, adopting as
the criterion of excellence of the screen that it must be a perfect pro-
tection from outside radiations if these two thermometers read alike,
which they in fact generally did. The theory of this method and the
formula for correcting the bright bulb in case of any small difference
have been lately given by Ferrel in his memoir on temperature. <A quite
thorough investigation of. the merits of various. thermometer shelters
and the relative effect of solar, terrestrial, and instrumental radiation
and of convection by wind has been recently made by H. A. Hazen,
from which it would appear that the Wild shelter (a wooden lattice-work
inclosing a sheet-zine screen with the thermometers inside) does not
quite give sufficient ventilation for warm climates; in fact, the meteor.
ologist needs the temperature and moisture of the free air, and the
criterion of a good shelter must be that the thermometer within gives
the same temperature as the thermometer outside, after correcting the
latter for solar and other radiations, the formule for which have also
been given by Ferrel.| In reference to determining the moisture of
the air Wild relies largely upon the studies of Sworykin, who found
that with a wind of definite and sufficiently high velocity the psychrom:
eter, with ventilation, gives very accurate results as compared with
Alluard’s dew-point apparatus and Schwackhé6fer’s volume hygrometer.
He recognizes the value of the rotation-psychrometer and the sling-
psychrometer, but thinks on account of the time required these meth-
ods should only be employed at special stations, and that for ordinary
use it is only necessary to add to his own shelter a ventilating appa-
ratus fastened to the floor of the shelter, and which is rotated by the
hand rapidly just before making an observation; this draws the air
from below up into the shelter and gives the necessary ventilation for
both dry and wet thermometers. (Z. 0, G. I., XIX, p. 433.)
METEOROLOGY. 293

138. [The dependence of the psychrometer constant upon the veloc-
ity of the wind, and the effect of barometric pressure, especially at such
high altitudes as Pike’s Peak, are matters that are now being inves-
tigated by the Ngnal Office, and it is to be hoped that formule and
tables which may be approved by the International Congress of meteor-
ologists will soon be available. But still more desirable is it that some
improved dew-point, chemical or other method may be invented prac-
ticable for daily use by all observers, and calculated to replace the
psychrometer. |

134. R. Fuess, of Berlin, describes the Assmann anemograph and
the Sprung-Fuess anemograph, both as made by himself in a high style
of elegance and perfection. The latter apparatus cost 1,100 marks, and
is more complicated than that of the former, whose price is 630 marks,
but the Sprung-Fuess overcomes several difficulties, and is probably
more desirable. Both are in working order at several stations. (D. Jf.
Z., p. 356.)

135. Professor Bornstein, of Berlin, has constructed a pressure ane-
mometer, consisting essentially of a ball 126"" in diameter at the top
of a heavy vertical rod, which at some distance below is supported by
a gimbal or universal joint; from the lower end of the rod hangs a wire
by means of which record is made of the deflection of the rod from the
vertical. (Natwre, XXIX, p. 280.)

136. Dr. Maurer, of Zurich, has established at the station on the very
summit of the Sintis a self-recording anemometer specially made by
Munro, of London, for this station. He gives a description of the ap-
paratus and the lightning protection which may be of value to those
establishing mountain stations elsewhere. With reference to self-
recording thermometers he states that the experiments of Prof. A.
Fischer showed uniformly that metallic spirals, &c., always lag behind
the true temperature of the land. The same result has been deduced
by Ilann in comparing a Hottinger metal thermograph with a Theorell
self-registering mercurial. Maurer has therefore introduced the so-
called upset thermometer invented by Negretti and Zambra. (Z. O.
GaM.. XVIII, p. 411.)

137. [The comparison between the normal or standard barometers
used in the various national observatories and weather services has
progressed but slowly through the past year. Owing to the sickness of
Professor Waldo the extensive and important work undertaken by him
at St. Petersburg, Berlin, Hamburg, Paris, London, and Washington
has not as yet been discussed and made available. |

138. Denza has published the results of the barometric comparisons
made by Tacchini and Chistoni, from which we quote the following:

The normal barometers at St. Petersburg, Paris (College de France),
Kew, and Monealieri agree with each other to within 0.05". The
barometers at Greenwich, Geneva, Stockholm, Vienna, and Algiers are
less than 0,05" higher than the St. Petersburg normal. The barome-
994 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884

ters at Hamburg, Copenhagen, and Munich are about 0.2™". higher than
the St. Petersburg standard. (Z. O. G@. M., Xvitt, p. 359.)

139. N. von Klobukoff describes the method of Bogen for filling
barometer tubes and explains his own improvement thereupon. It con-
sists, essentially, in attaching to the main tube another glass tube of
about equal length by a short flexible-rubber tube. Mercury is poured in
through the latter, and by a proper manipulation the first is filled, with
but little chance of leaving any air bubbles. The method is applicable
to barometer tubes of allkinds. Sprung remarks that by warming the
mercury the filling is materially assisted. Whipple, of Kew, considers
the Bogen method (unless the temperature is elevated somewhat) infe-
rior to that of Captain George, who sweeps the bubbles of air out of the
tube by means of a feather. The method of Bogen is used to a consid-
erable extent at the Hamburg Seewarte. (D. MM. Z., I, p. 289.)

140. Professor Mendeleef, of St. Petersburg, has during the past few
vears made a large number of improvements in apparatus for measuring
the density of the air, as also in barometers, and has done much to deter-
mine the law of density of the air at various temperatures and press-
ures; he has among other things shown that as the rarefaction of gases
goes on a maximum volume or limit is reached, like the minimum or
limit for compression, so that the gas when rarefied does not merge into
the luminous ether, but becomes, soto speak, like a solid body, so that
the atmosphere of the earth has a limit. (Nature, XxvU, p. 568.)

141. H. Dufour and H. Amstein have described a new form of self-regis-
tering barometer, based upon a new principle, and which is distinguished
above all others by the simplicity and ease of its construction, as well
as by the accuracy and sensitiveness of its records. The principle con-
sists in this, that the changes in atmospheric pressure shall alter the
position of the center of gravity of a free column of mercury, and that
these changes shall be recorded in the simplest possible manner. The
barometer tube is bent at right angles to itself and is fastened to a hor-
izontal axis perpendicular to the plane of the bent tube, consequently
the rise and fall of mercury in this tube alters its center of gravity and
its position of equilibrium. A pointeris attached to the axis, and, turn-
ing with it, gives a magnified record of the changes of pressure. The
authors call this form of apparatus the “* Hebel” or lever barometer.
They develop the theory of the barometer and the methods of install-
ing and correcting it, and give numerous observations. (Z. O. G. M.,
XVII, p. 294.)

142. W. Képpen, insome remarks upon the use of the barometer asa
means of measuring gravity, compares together the suggestions of von
Wiillerstorf-Urbair, Zoppritz, Siemens, Mascart, and others, and shows
how little likelihood there is of deducing from this anything of value in
comparison with the pendulum observations of the geodesist. He takes
occasion to state that it is much more proper to correct the readings of the
mercurial barometer so as to reduce to a standard gravity of 45° than
to neglect this and apply the reverse correction of the aneroid barom-
METEOROLOGY. 295

eter, for it is certainly more scientific and important that we should in
this way obtain a correct measure of the gradient force that produces
the movements of the atmosphere, and it is much to be desired that
this reduction should be applied generally to individual observations
rather than to monthly and annual averages. As the Signal Service
has announced the adoption (on and after January 1, 1885) of this cor-
rection in its publications, he hopes that the co-operation of other me-
teorologists may be prompt and general. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 323.)

143. Prof. R. Bornstein, of Berlin, has discussed the value of the ingen-
ious suggestion made by Professor Nipher, of Saint Louis, that a protec-
tion in the form of a funnel be given to a rain-gauge in order that the
influence of eddies of wind around the mouth of the gauge may be
diminished. After recounting some of the theories explanatory of the
diminution in the catch of rainfall, all of which have been reduced
to one, namely, the greater formation of eddies by the stronger winds
at high exposures, he states that Nipher’s proposition seeming per-
fectly rational it was tested by experiments by himself. Two simi-
lar rain-guages, having receiving surfaces of 500 square centimeters,
such as are used at the stations of the Deutsche Seewarte, were estab-
lished near each other, one protected, the other unprotected; both were
on the roof of the Berlin Agricultural High School, near the southwest
corner, and 26™ above the ground. The position of the gauges was
changed several times within narrow limits on the roof. The greatest
individual difference between the catches of the two gauges was during
alight rain in January, and amounting to over 500 per cent., the pro-
tected gauge giving the larger figure. The annual average difference
was about 11.5 per cent. There is therefore no doubt as to the general
value of Nipher’s invention ; but this becomes still more remarkable if
we classify the precipitation, whence we find the ratios or the catch of
the unsheltered divided by that of the sheltered gauge. The figures are
as follows: For snow, the ratio is 0.54; for fine rain, 0.66; for rain and
snow, 0.82; for rain with hail, 0.89; for rain, 0.90; for heavy rain, 0.95;
whence it seems that Nipher’s device gives the rain-gauge a better pro-
tection, and that it therefore makes better measurements in proportion
as the wind can more easily deflect the precipitation ; and in general his
device does better in proportion as the wind is stronger. Perhaps the
most important defect in the Nipher gauge is that with heavy snowfall
the protecting funnel is soon filled up, and then ceases to work. (D. M.
Z., I, p. 381).

144. Dr. C. Lang, of Munich, has experimentally investigated the quan-
tity of rainfall as dependent on the shape of therain-gauge, an investiga-
tion which, as he says, is the more important now that weare establishing
such a great additional number of rainfall stations and are about to
discuss the climatic conditions of various portions of limited regions,
where the natural differences will be slight and comparable with the
errors of observation. In general we do not in meteorology expect ab-
solutely correct measures of any element, but are satisfied if uniformity
296 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

is attained, even if slight constant errors remain; but in rainfall measures
even uniformity has never yet been obtained. Thus the new reorganiza-
tion of the official stations in Bavaria in 1878 has been productive of an
abrupt change in the rainfall records, due to improved instruments and
exposures, by virtue of which some stations record twice as much rain
and others only two-thirds as much as they formerly did. itis correctly
concluded on the basis of several investigations (Bache, Symons, Jevons,
&e.) that the greater part of this irregularity is due to the wind and its in-
fluence either on local distribution or on the instrument and its exposure.
To obviate this latter, rain-gauges have been established in pits or hol-
lows, so that their apertures are protected from severe wind, but none of
these are appropriate for the measur ement of snow, which is easily whirled
out of the gauge unless the latter is furnished with a conical rim; butin
any case, however, the measurement of the snow is not of so great import-
ance, becauseit hardly forms one-eighth of therainfall. [This latter, which
is true for most civilized countries, is, of course, not quite true for some
regions in which meteorology has an especial interest, namely, the ex-
treme north and south temperate and polar regions and those in which
glaciers have a tendency to form.] Lang’s views as to the proper form
of a rain and snow gauge were originally about as follows: A comical ad-
dition as a cap to the gauge will give the wind that blows along its sur-
face an upward tendency, depending upon the strength of the wind, the
size and inclination of the conical surface; the air thus foreed up will
earry with it a definite zone of particles, which will depend upon the
strength of the wind and the size of the surface. Since now, for gauges
whose mouths have different sizes and are furnished with the conical
caps, the sloping surface of the latter increases as the diameter, but the
catching surface as the square of the diameter, it is evident that by
reason of this conical cap the ascending air currents will be of more im-
portance in proportion to the ratio between the surface of the cone and
the mouth, that is to say, in proportion as the gauge is of smaller dimen-
sions, for the current carries away from the mouth the suspended drops
of rain or flakes of snow. This source of error is unavoidable, but by a
proper selection of ratios can be made very small.. Lang has, therefore,
chosen the following four forms for experimental comparisons:

1. Of the same form as that used at the Bavarian stations since 1878,
namely, a cylinder about 40 centimeters diameter, surmounted by a
cone whose vertical angle is about 60°, and so truncated that the aper-
ture or mouth of the gauge has a diameter 25.2 centimeters, or an area
of 5!5 of a square meter.

2. A similar gauge whose cylinder has about 20 centimeters diameter,
and whose cap has an aperture of 16 centimeters, or 3; of a square
meter.

3. A gauge similar to No. 1 and cylinder of the same size, but with a
conical cap so truncated that the mouth has a diameter 16 centimeters,
namely, the same size as the mouth of No. 2.
METEOROLOGY. 997

4. A simple cylindrical gauge 25.2 aperture, or = square meter,
which, of course, having no conical surface, should give results free from
apy error the latter may introduce.

This latter proved wholly unreliable in drifting snow ; the comparison,
therefore, between these as snow-gauges was given up for the present,
but as regards rainfall during the summer months the following results
are expressed in percentage of the catch given by No. 1, namely: No. 1,
100; No. 2, 97.5; No. 3, 95; No. 4,99. The small catch of No. 3 may be
due partly to the general poor results given by smallapertures, but if pre-
vious hypotheses were correct must also be partly due to the increased
ratio between the inclined conical surface and the aperture of the gauge.
These two results, however, suggest that so far as the heavier rainfall of
the year is concerned one need not be very anxious about the instruments,
provided they are not too small; the more important question will be as
to the proper exposure of the gauges and radical differences in the struct-
ure or shapes of the gauges. At Miinich the gauges of the Central
Meteorological Station, and that at the Observatory of Bogenhausen
2.7 kilometers apart, on the average of several years, with comparable
instruments of this same pattern, show that 8.6 per cent. less precipita-
tion fell on the right than on the left bank of the river Isar, while for a
period of nine months of special comparative observations 16 per cent.
less fellon the right than on the left side. Specialobservations are now
being made in this region at three otlier stations, namely, on the roof
of one of the public buildings of the city and on the grounds of two of
the observatory buildings. The differences between the records are such
that at least five stations would seem necessary if we would have a eor-
rect result as to the distribution of rain over a space of one English mile
square, or at the rate of 3,500 stations for one division of Bavaria. We
must conclude, then, that meteorology will profit least of all by the ordi-
nary rainfall measurements, although tor hydrography and engineering
they are very important. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 431.)

145. G. J. Symons, in the British Rainfall for 1880, gives a collatiom
of results as to the effect of elevation above the ground upon the quan-
tity of rain caught by the rain-gauge. The following table shows the
percentage of the upper gauge as compared with the amount caught by
a gauge at the surface of the ground:

We see from this that in general the average of 64 per cent. will rep
resent all! these observations with equal accuracy, and that there is nosen-
sible diminution in the quantity of rain from 67 up to 260 feet above the
earth’s surface. It is also well known that there is only a slight per-
centage of increase in the velocity of the wind as we go from 67 up to 260.
feet, and the conclusion drawn from other observations is, therefore,
corroborated by this present table, according to which the rapid dimi-
nution of rain caught by gauges whose altitudes are between zeroand 60
feet is due almost wholly to the increase of the wind at the high alti-
tudes. The large deviations from average results shown by different
gauges, even at the same altitude, depend upon the shape of the rain-
gauge and its location, and especially upon the configuration of those
parts of the building that are near it. (Z. O. G. M., XVU, p. 294.)

[The results given by Bérnstein (§143) show that this injurious effect
of altitude is almost wholly neutralized by Nipher’s improvement. |

146. Capt. ©. Rung, of Copenhagen, describes a form of self-registering
rain-gauge which he calls the sine balance, wherein the weight of the
water is balanced by a heavy lever arm; the water acts on a constant
leverage, and the weight on a variable one the sine of whose angular
variations is proportional to the weight, and is recorded upon an end-
less sheet of paper. The same principle applies to the record of evapo-
ration, the growth of plants, &c. The cost of this ombrograph, as
manufactured by Kemp & Lauritzen in Copenhagen, is about $75. (D.
M. Z.,1, p. 461.)

147. Dr. Maurer describes a form of self-registering rain-gauge which
preserves a continuous record of the rainfall and the time; it is manu-
factured by Hottinger, of Zurich, and has already been extensively in-
troduced by Austrian, Roumanian, and other meteorological services.
(ZA OSGM.. xix, p-130.)

148. Dr. Assmann, of Magdeburg, has established a station upon the
Brocken, where he has erected a self-recording rain-gauge, which ap-
parently runs without trouble throughout the whole winter; the snow
caught therein is melted by the heat from the chimney, and immedi-
ately flows to the measuring apparatus in the room below, thereby avoid-
ing the great loss that occurs when strong winds blow. The rain-gauge
is surrounded by a large shield of wire net work, as suggested by Nipher.
The experiments have shown that snow at a temperature of —6° centi-
grade, on being thrown into the gauge,was within 6 seconds collected
within the room below, as warm water at a temperature of 10° An
apparatus for the measurement of the quantity of frost formation that
accumulates'on every exposed surface is described as follows : Two iron
rods, 1 meter high, have at their lower ends a wide-open flask, into
which flows the water which may result from any melting due to the
sun’s neat. One of these rods and flasks is exposed at the moment
when the other is taken in; when brought in all the frost upon the rod
METEOROLOGY. 299

is melted and added to that which had been caught in the flask. (7. O
G. M., XVIII, p. 68.)

149. Dr. W. Zenker states that after using for many years a method of
determining the heights of clouds, which afterwards developed what is
known as Brann’s nephoskope, he then devised a method for photograph-
ing the clouds, which, however, he was not able to put in practice until
1882, and with his present experience he is able to deseribe an arrange-
ment which he thinks will be thoroughly satisfactory, and which is
about as follows: Two or three photographic cameras of the same focal
length are needed, two of which are placed on the ends of a base line, their
axes parallel to each other, directed toward the cloud, and simultaneously
exposed and closed. His own apparatus has the focal length 0.5 meter,
the objective being an achromatic telescope lens, the sensitive plate
being set at the chemical focus for parallel rays. The plates are gelatine
dry plates; the simultaneous opening and closing of the apparatus must
be obtained by electric contact, so that only a momentary exposure will
be made; a third camera, stationed alongside of these two and parallel
to them, can be exposed ten seconds later. By this third photograph
the movements and changes in the clouds can be determined. We can
also obtain this third photograph by a second exposure of eithez one of
the first two cameras, which method has the advantage of being inde-
pendent of the adjustment of the two axes. The distance of the two
cameras from each other may ordinarily be 100 meters. There are three
methods of pointing’the cameras, each of which has its advantages: ‘1)
if they are pointed towards the zenith we have the best position for
determining the height of the clouds, while the direction and velocity
of movement are determined directly without computation; the direc.
tion of the four principal points of the compass can be photographed
upon the plate by the shadows of wires placed immediately above it;
(2) pointing the camera towards the sun: this has the great advantage
that we can utilize the picture of the sun’s disk to obtain the direction
or the parallelism of two directions with greatest safety ; measurement
from the sun to the cloud gives us the parallax of the cloud to a minute
of are; (3) poipting the camera toward the horizon: this has the ad-
vantage that the clouds are photographed in vertical section, and,
moreover, there is no danger that any cloud feature appearing in one
photograph will be obscured in the other by intervening portions of the
same or other clouds; but this advantage is balanced by the fact that
the distance of the clouds in the horizon is always great, and the base
line of 100 meters must be proportionately increased; an error in the
direction of the axes of the cameras is therefore here of greater impor-
tance, and to counteract this it is important to photograph on the
same plate some distant object (e. g., a church spire), from which as a
base the horizontal and vertical angular measurements can be made.
Zenker states that we can thus follow in the cirrus clouds the sinking,
step by step, of the upper warm and moist current of air; the rising of
300 SCIENTIFIC RECORD TOR 12884

the cumulus clotds by day and their sinking by night; the true form
of the thunder clouds and their method of growth, and the locus within
the cloud where the lightning is developed. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 4.)

150. [It seems strange that the numerous suggestions made in Eng-

land, Germany, and America for many years past as to the use of pho-
- tography for determining the height of clouds should as yet have been
‘earnestly taken up by only one person, Mr. W. Abney, who, in Septem-

ber, 1883, began active work on this subject at Kew. <A beginning in
‘this direction was made in 1871 by the Signal Office, and we are now
-promised that good work will be done by the photographers of the
U. 8. Geological Survey. ]

151. A. Richter proposes to determine the altitudes of clouds and
‘their true velocity from observations made by two observers at quite a
«distance apart vertically instead of horizontally. This method is espe-
-clalky applicable to mountain regions and to those who have access to
‘very tall towers. (D. M. Z., I, p. 166.)

152. Various forms of sound radiometers were described by Dworak
‘to the Berlin Physical Society in March, 1884. [Either by these or by
means of Edison’s phonautograph we may still hope to obtain some
‘method of measurement of the intensity of thunder. The gradual dying
:away of thunder and of the roiling noise frequently likened to an explo-
ssion emanating from a bright meteor can give us some information as
ito the condition of the atmosphere at high regions.] (Nature, XX1x,
p. 363.)

153. J. H. Gladstone, as a member of the Commission for Light-Houses
and Marine Signals, has expressed the necessity and possibility of estab-
lishing some standard for the measurement of the density of fog. His
observations show that only spots or streaks of country are covered at
any one time with dense fog; that the fog is much more uniform over
the sea than over the land, and that its geographical distribution is
very irregular. Usually only a small portion of Great Britain is affected
at any one time; the foggiest months are January and June; November
is the foggy month for London, but not so for the restof England. The

_foggiest portion of the coast is the southern point of the Hebrides, and
- fog especially occurs where the wind from the sea is turned upwards by
:striking hills and cliffs. Hitherto the observers have simply distin-
guished between mist, fog, and heavy fog. Gladstone urges that the
rrecezd should be made more accurate, using Cunningham’s proposition,
roameély : a staff placed at 100 yards distance in front of a painted red
ecircle, :aazd becoming invisible, requires the entry of the word * fog.”
Symons proposes a substitute, as follows: A series of 5 screens, each
eff black and white stripes, screen No. 5 having broad stripes, and No.
Lmarrow ones. The fogs to be recorded as of intensity from 1 to 5
according to the visibility or invisibility of these screens. At night-
time tihe-sereens are to be illuminated by © lamp from behind, all being
METEOROLOGY. 30L

placed upon an axis and at a uniform distance of 20 yards from the ob»
server. (Z. O. G. M., XVII, p. 237.)

154. G. M. Whipple, of Kew, proposes to apply Sir Francis Galton’s
method of composite portraiture to the study of meteorological observa-
tions. Thus, by selecting a large number of typical storm-charts and
superposing their prominent features upon one chart, we may finally
obtain a tracing that may be considered as an average normal presenta-
tion of facts. [This idea of saving the labor of numerical compilations
has been independently applied to the same study by W. M. Davis, of
Cambridge, Mass., who has thus thrown upon one chart the results of
a large number of observations bearing upon tornadoes. |

155. Prof. K. Weihrauch, of Dorpat, has studied the proper method of
taking the arithmetical mean of a series of values of the relative hu-
midity. The arithmetical mean is always proper when the quantity is
directly measured and has no algebraic connection with other objects of
observation ; this is true of temperature, absolute humidity, pressure,
&e. But the relative humidity is the ratio of two numbers, and the
average value of these ratios is not the same as the ratio of the average
values. The numerators and denominators of the fractions that consti-
tute relative humidities have each regular diurnal periods, and the diur-
nal periodicity of the relative humidity is therefore a complicated fune-
tion of the other two. The true average humidity for the day can only
be found by knowing the true average temperature of the air and abso-
lute humidity, and it will differ therefore from the simple average of a
few observed relative humidities. In general Weihrauch finds that the
true relative humidity is less than the arithmetical average, and the
true amplitude greater than the arithmetical difference. He shows that
it is necessary for us to give up taking the arithmetical mean relative
humidity on account of systematic errors, which all lie in one direction.
We must undertake a slightly greater labor, namely, the addition of the
maximum vapor tension to each table of daily temperatures, with which
data the true mean humidity can easily be calculated by the method
which he gives. The hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly mean maxi-
mum vapor tension should also be computed for sake of the convenience
with which we then compute the true average for long periods. (Z. O.
Ga, XIX, Pp. 265.)

156. [Prompted by the many troubles which beset the use of relative
humidities, and on account of the decided direct advantage of using
the dew-point in the prediction of frosts, rain, snow, fog, &c., the Sig-
nal Office has for some years introduced this latter datum into its sta-
tistical tables and daily weather maps. As the dew-point is a matter
of direct observation, and has no necessary relation to temperature, its
mean value can be taken without incurring the objections urged by
Weihrauch against the relative humidity. If, however, we desire to
compute the mean absolute or relative vapor tension from the monthly
802 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

average dew-point, we must add the maximum and minimum values for
use in a method similar to that which he has pointed out. |]

157. F. Erk, from a study of thirty-three years’ self-registered tem-
peratures at Munich and a discussion of the theories of Weilenmann
and his predecessors, finds that the best combination of three daily
observations of temperature is 4 (7 A.M. + 2P.M. + 2 x 9 P. M.), and
that almost the same accuracy is attained by the following combination:
4(8aA.M.+2P.M.+2x10P.M.). If three observations must be com-
bined into a simple arithmetical mean, then the best combinations are
as follows: 4 (64.M.+ 2P.M.+4+ 10P. M.) and §(7A.M.42P.M. +
10 p. M.). Numerous other combinations are examined by Erk and
their advantages discussed. (Z. O. G. M., XIX, p. 254.)

158. Prof. K. Weihrauch states that the principal objection to the
use of the four components of the wind—north, south, east, and west—
as measured in some anemometers, in place of the total velocity and
the direction, is said to be, that by it the mean velocity and direction
and the velocity of individual directions as well as the mean value of
wind force, irrespective of direction, cannot be given. He then proves
that this objection is a mistake, at least so far as regards the arithmet-
ical mean velocity, which can be found from the sum of the four com-
ponents by simply multiplying it by the factor i The denominator 4
is, however, rather small, and the figure 5 will apparently do better.
(DM. Z.. 1, p20.)

159. Jamin, of Paris, proposes that meteorologists, instead of the rela-
tive humidity, shall introduce the quotient found by dividing the weight
of the moisture by the weight of the dry air actually found in the same

volume; that is to say, for - substitute a (Z. O. G. M., X1x., p. 408.)

160. [This proposition seems not yet to have found very hearty accord-
ance. Apparently Jamin desires by this substitution to obtain figures
that will express both the quantity of moisture in the air and its relation
to the quantity required for saturation. As he expresses it, the new ratio
gives us the hygrometric constitution of the air, and shows the changes
that are brought about by diurnal and annual variations at different
altitudes and latitudes. It would seem that if the absolute quantity of
moisture in the air is really desired it would be simpler to publish it
directly in the shape of the weight or tension of the aqueous vapor
alongside of the ordinary percentage of relative humidity, as is in fact
frequently done. Simplest of all in our estimation is it to publish the
temperature of the air and the temperature of the dew-point, leaving it
to the climatologist to deduce such phenomena as most affect vegeta-
tion and animal life, and to the physical meteorologist to deduce such
additional data as he may desire. The daily prediction of the dew-point
is as practicable and desirable as that of temperature; it is to be hoped
that the direct determination of the dew-point may soon be made prac-
ticable for all observers. |

IV.—(a) CONSTITUTION OF THE ATMOSPHERE; (b) GENERAL PHYSICAL
PROPERTIES OF THE ATMOSPHERE, THE OCEAN, THE LAND.

161. E. Rogovski offers to the Journal of the Russian Chemical and
Physical Society a mathematical and physical study on the structure of
the atmosphere. He thinks that the ordinary formule can be used up to
10,000 meters, but above that the constitution varies with the height,
the proportion of oxygen diminishing, and at the height of 1,000 kilo-
meters the density is nearly zero. (Nature, Xxx, p. 118.)

162. A. Lévy, of the observatory at Montsouris, has conducted a daily
series of observations on the chemical constituents of theatmosphe ,
of which Prof. EK. Wollny gives a brief summary :

1. Ozone.—The average weight in milligrams per 100 cubic meters is
1.9 for 1877; 1.5 for 1878; 0.8 for 1879; 0.6 for 1880. The quantity of
ozone with southerly winds is very large; that with northwest to north-
east winds, quite small.

2. Ammonia.—The average quantity of ammonia in milligrams per
100 cubic feet is as follows: 3.2 for 1877; 1.8 for 1878; 2.1 for 1879;
1.8 for 1880. The quantity of ammonia in the warmer half of the year
is sensibly greater than in the colder half. It also varies very much in
different localities near the observatory.

3. Organic nitrogenous substances.—The average quantity was 0.6
milligram per 100 cubic meters. The deviations therefrom were too
small to recognize any material changes.

4, Carbonic acid gas._-The average for the whole period was 30.2
liters per 100 cubic meters. The variations in the quantity of carbonic
acid are quite considerable, but probably no more than in similar meas-
urements by other observers. (Z. O. G. Jl., Xvul, p. 380.)

163. Miintz and Aubin have invented a very accurate method of de-
termining the quantity of carbonic gas in the atmosphere, and have
taken a series of determinations, at the summit of the Pie du Midi, at a
height of 2,877 meters. They find that the average at this altitude is
2.86 parts in 10,000 by volume, and at intermediate altitudes they ob-
tain the same result, showing that the gas is uniformly distributed
throughout the atmosphere. (Z. O. G. ML, XVil, p. 256.)

164. Miintz and Aubin have presented to the Paris Academy of
Sciences the results of observations made on a uniform plan under
their directions in various parts of the world on the quantity of ear-
bonic gas in theair. Their method consisted generally in making care-
ful analyses at the seven stations occupied by the French expeditions
for the observation of the transit of Venus; they also secured from
each station a series of glass vessels filled with samples of the air, all
of which were analyzed at Paris by the authors. It is easily seen that
the proportion of carbonic gas is not very different at these stations and
at Paris, and that the variations everywhere depend on the condition
of the sky and the velocity of the wind; the general mean is 2.78 in
304 | SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

10,000 parts of air, which is somewhat smaller than has been found for
France and the summits of mountains in France, so that they conclude
that the general mean value of the carbonic acid in the whole atmos-
phere is somewhat smaller than had hitherto been assumed from obser-
vations in Europe. (Z. O. G. M., XVIII, p. 473.)

165. Miintz and Aubin have studied the observations made by the
French International Expedition to Cape Horn with reference to the
quantity of carbonic gas in the air. They desired to test the theory of
Schléssing, according to which there should be less CO, in the southern
hemisphere because of its absorption by the cold ocean water. The re-
sults of the observations which were made by Dr. Hyades have con-
vinced Miintz and Aubin that the mean value 2.56 in 10,000 for the
southern hemisphere, as compared with 2.84 for the northern hemisphere,
confirms Schléssing’s theory. They also find that the mean of the meas-
ures taken at night-time is slightly less than the average for the day-
time, which agrees with the theory requiring the colder waters to absorb
more of the gas. This view is confirmed by grouping the measurements
according to the observed temperature, from which they find the aver-
age 2.530 parts of CO, for temperatures lower than 5°, and 2.998 for
temperatures above 5°. (Z. O. G. M., XIX, p. 462.)

166. A. Woeikof remarks upon some desultory observations of Pro-
fessor Tyndall that these do not demonstrate the transparency of
dry air to radiant heat; on the other hand, his exposed thermome-
ters over the snow must have fallen into a lower temperature, because
the snow itself possesses a great radiating power, and is, moreover, a
poor conductor. That aqueous vapor must exert some influence on the
absorption of radiation will be admitted by all; the opponents of Pro-
fessor Tyndall for these many years past have simply affirmed that its
influence is by no means so large as Tyndall claims. (Z. 0. G. M.,
XVIII, p. 275.)

167. A. Woeikof also shows that Tyndall’s views are inconsistent with
well-established meteorological facts in dry climates. (Nature, XXvII,
p. 460.)

168. J. M. Pernter comments on Professor Tyndall’s recent renewal
of his conviction as to the extreme efficacy of aqueous vapor in absorb-
ing radiant heat, and makes the following points:

1. Langley’s measurements and Abney’s demonstration that the vapor
in the atmosphere does not exert upon the dark heat rays the absorbing
power that Tyndall thinks, that on the contrary the bright part of the
spectrum experiences the greatest absorption. Abney’s, Festing’s, and
Beequerel’s photographs of the solar spectrum give the direct demon-
stration that it is fluid and not gaseous water that exert a sensible.
absorption on the ultra-red.

2. Tyndall’s idea that the aqueous vapor prevents loss of heat by
radiation from the earth’s surface is completely answered by other
explanations of the same phenomena.

3. With reference to the elegant experiment of Tyndall’s with the
METEOROLOGY. 305

radiophone, it has been shown by Maccaluco and Grimaldi that the
glass surface itself is the cause of the phenomena and not the interme-
diate moist air.

Although the question whether the aqueous vapor absorbs dark heat
rays is now decided in the negative, still many questions remain for the
meteorologists with reference to the absorption of the solar rays in the
atmosphere, especially such new questions as the following: How is it
with the absorption of bright rays by the atmospheric vapor? Whatis
the normal dtmospheric absorption, when there is no fluid water sus-
pended in the air? How great is the influence of the vapor for different
atmospheric conditions? What part is played by carbonic acid gas,
and what by the suspended solid impurities called dust? All these
questions await their solution, and can only then be brought to a satis-
factory solution when in some favorable climate simultaneous observa-
tions are made like Langley’s and Abney’s during a long period of time
at a summit and base station. Why should not this be a proper work
for the new observatory upon Mount Etna with Catania for a correspond-_
ing station ?

169. [It is proper here to remark that in view of the probable
future importance of this class of observations, and at the sugges-
tion of Professor Langley, the region surrounding Mount Whitney in
California has been set apart as a public reservation and assigned to
the Chief Signal Officer of the Army for his use; it is probable that it
will be occupied as a special signal station at some time in the future. ]
(7 O0G. M., XVI, p.-277:)

170. The Daily Weather Report of the London Meteorological Office
for October 1, 1854, states that observations made by navigators crossing
the Atlantic, on the temperature of the ocean surface water between

- Great Britain and Newfoundland, show that during thesummer of 1884
the ocean temperature in the course of the Gulf Stream was abnormally
,high, namely, general average of 3° in June and 1°.5 in July above the
normal. (Nature, XXX, p. 049.)

171. The Hydrographie Oftice of the United States Navy publishes
monthly charts of ocean currents, ice, wrecks, &¢., showing the latest
information, as also the prevalent normal condition. This is a very
valuable contribution to both navigators and students of the ocean.

172. Dr. O. Pettersson, as a part of the report of the Norwegian North
Sea Expedition, investigates the constitution and properties of sea-
water and sea-ice. He finds the ice frozen out of sea-water to be not
necessarily pure, but a compound of the cryohydrates discovered by
Professor Guthrie; the sea-water ice is rich in the sulphates, and the
remaining brine richer in chlorides. The latent heat developed by the
freezing of sea-water is extraordinarily inferior to that of pure water;
the contraction of sea-water ice with heat, as the melting point is being
reached, bevcomes more marked the greater the quantity of salt in the
ice. (Nature, XXVU, p. 418.)

V.—(a) SOLAR RADIATION AND ATMOSPHERIC ABSORPTION; (b) TEM. |
PERATURE OF THE AIR, THE WATER, AND THE GROUND.

178. Hirn proposes an apparatus for determining the-total absolute
amount of solar heat on the principle of the surface condenser of the
steam engine, namely, a saturated vapor contained within a closed re-
ceiver has the tension corresponding to that for the lowest temperature
of any part of the walls of the receiver. Hirn fills a copper cylinder
with bisulphide of carbon, the evaporation of which by solar heat fills
a space within which is a cooling surface; the liquid cooled upon this
flows into a receiver and is measured. (Z. O. G. M., X1x, p. 548.)

174. Prof. Balfour Stewart, secretary of the committee appointed by
the British Association for the Advancement of Science to consider the
best methods of recording the direct intensity of solar radiation, re-
ported at the Montreal meeting in i884 that the committee has chiefly
devoted its attention to the subject of a self-recording actinometer. It
was suggested that a modification of Stewart’s actinometer might be
adapted to self-registration by taking for the quantity to be observed,
not the rise of temperature ef the inclosed thermometer after exposure
for a given time, but the excess of its temperature when continuously
exposed over the temperature of the envelope. Professor Stokes showed
that in such a static method the inclosure should be of such a nature as
to change its temperature very slowly, and that the various portions of
the interior should be at the same time of the same uniform tempera-
ture. The committee therefore proposed to make an inclosure of suc-
cessive layers of polished plates and some non-conductor ; in the center
of this is placed a thermometer of green glass with a flattened bulb, on
which the sun’s light falls continuously, while in the inclosure near by,
but unaffected by the direct sunlight, is a second thermometer.

175. [This proposed arrangement for continuous self-registration ap-
parently embodies the same principles that are incorporated in Violle’s
absolute actinometer, where the object sought by Professor Stokes’s
arrangement is perfectly attained by using a jacket of circulating cold
water.|. (Nature, Xxx, p. 498.)

176. J. Exicsson, of New York, describes a motor for utilizing the sun’s
radiant heat. This device is less expensive than others hitherto de-
scribed, and was able to generate steam enough to work a steam-engine
of 6-inch cylinder and 8-inch stroke, under a pressure of 35 pounds per
square inch, at the rate of 120 oscillations per minute. He reasserts
his belief that the solar temperature cannot be less than 1,000,000 de-
grees Fahrenheit. (Nature, XxIx, p. 217.)

177. J. Ericsson describes some of his results on the heat of the solar
rays as determined by a large solar pyrometer. His computed tem-
perature of 3,000,000 depends upon the assumed law of radiation, but
the apparatus and observations have some good features. (Nature, Xxx,
p. 467.)
METEOROLOGY. 307

178. Dr. Maurer contributes to the Archives of Geneva a study upon
the theory of the absorption of the solar rays by the atmosphere. He
attempts to compute more accurately the thickness of the stratum
traversed by the rays at any altitude; his figures are slightly larger
than those of Laplace, but they are still not beyond eviticism. (Z. O.
GC. U., XTX, -p..203.)

179. Prof. S. P. Langley, of Allegheny Observatory, has finally pub-
lished the full text of his extensive researches into solar radiation and
atmospheric absorption as a professional paper of the Signal Service.
Preliminary to this full publication, he has communicated some of his
results to the scientific world through the Philosophical Magazine, the
Comptes Rendus, and the American Journal of Science ; « Memoir bear-
ing on the same subject also appears in volume 2 of the Memoirs of
the National Academy of Sciences. In general he finds the following
points established :

1. After the passage of the solar rays through the atmosphere the
maximum of heat in the diffraction spectrum lies near the wave-length
0.0006 of a millimeter, and therefore in the orange portion, agreeing
with the maximum intensity of light.

2. Before its passage through the atmosphere the maximum of heat
intensity was near the blue.

3. The red and ultra-red rays, especially the latter, suffer the least ab-
sorption by the atmosphere, while the blue and ultra-blue suffer the
most.

4, The energy in the solar rays, before entering the atmosphere, is
1.569 times the energy for a vertical sun after passing through the at-
mosphere, but this latter corresponds to 1.81 calories, wherefore the true
solar constant is 2.84 calories, and Langley believes that the correct
value may even be 3. (Z. 0. G. M., XVII1, p. 233; and Signal Service
Professional Paper No. X1v.)

180. O. Frélich contributes to the question of the constancy of the
solar heat an important series of observations made with apparatus of
his own invention, being a modification of the thermopile, with which
he conducted his investigations into the temperature of space and of
the sky. As a constant source of heat with which to compare the
radiation from the sun he used a surface heated to a temperature of
100° C. His observations were made in September, 1879, on the sum-
mit of the Faulhorn, in Switzerland ; in the winter of 187980, at the
Royal Observatory at Berlin; then, to the end of 1882, at the villa of
G. Hansemann: and in 1883, in a tower at West-end, near Berlin. This
constitutes the most extensive series of observations hitherto available,
and they have been discussed with great care. Among his results we
quote the following:

In a perfectly clear sky the atmosphere absorbs a variable quantity,
as shown by the variations in the so-called atmospheric constant, which
has the least value on the 15th of October and the greatest on the 12th
308 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

of September, the zenithal absorption being 29 per cent. on the latter
day and 15 per cent. on the former, and this is the more remarkable
because the air was more decidedly hazy on the 12th of September.

By observing the temperature of a point in the same vertical plane
with the sun but on the opposite side of the zenith, one should theoret-
ically have the means of determining the influence of the atmosphere,
but his efforts to realize this method have shown that it is not success-
ful in the latitude of Berlin, partly because the observations are not so
accurate, and partly because the atmospheric irregularities have a
larger influence.

In general, in the day as well as by night, the lowest temperature is
found in the zenith and the warmest towards the horizon. ‘This, which
is due to the sky temperature, is apparently exaggerated by the sun’s
heat without a material change in the relative temperatures.

The diminution of solar heat with the length of path through the at-
mosphere is such that the former is a linear function rather than a log-
arithmic function of the latter.

The observations on the Faulhorn show that the atmospheric con-
stant for that elevation is sensibly smaller than in Berlin.

The most important result of the work is the proof that the solar heat
is not constant, but subject to very considerable variations, as shown
by the following values of the “‘ solar constant”:

The probable errors here given are really three times the probable
error as ordinarily understood, and represent the limits within which
the probabilities are 22 to 1 that the true value must fall. In general
the change of solar heat is such that it increases by about 6 per cent.
from the 1st of July to the middle of August, and then diminishes by
about 8 per cent. by the middle of October. This change is entirely
parallel to the observed change in the development of sun-spots, as re-
corded by the observers at Potsdam, who state that at the beginning of
July and in September and October the development was quite rapid,
but in August much less, whence we may hope that this method of ob-
serving the solar heat may give a method of inferring the variations
in the sun-spots.

The importance of this variation in solar heat may be estimated by
the following considerations: The mean temperature of the ground at
any place on the earth’s surface is the result of two factors, namely, the
mean influence of the heat from the sky and that of the heat from the sun.
The first of these, according to the Kénigsberg observations, amounts
to —82° for that place, and the latter influence amounts to +89° C.
We may therefore assume that in temperate latitudes a change of solar
METEOROLOGY. 309

‘heat of 1 per cent. corresponds approximately to a change of ground
temperature of 19 C. The variations above found by Frélich would,
therefore, if they endured for any length of time, produce a change in
the earth’s temperature of six or eight degrees.

181. [It is certainly very desirable that Frélich’s observations should
be maintained continuously at several stations on the earth’s surface
where atmospheric changes are comparatively rare, as it is scarcely pos-
sible to think that we shall ever master the peculiarities of meteorology
until we thoroughly understand the variations in the prime factor of
all—the solar heat.] (7. O. G. M., xix, p. 209.)

182. Dr. H. C. Vogel, of Potsdam, comments upon these results of
Froélich’s and maintains that the observations do not distinctly show
changes in the solar heat that are appreciable in comparison with the
uncertainty of each day’s observations ; that possibly in time one may
accumulate sufficient observations by Dr. Frélich’s method to detect the
short variations, but that five days of observations are not sufficient.
With reference to Froélich’s opinion that variations in the solar heat, if
any exist, have some connection with the size and number of the sun’s
spots, Vogel states that accurate measures of the sun-spot area in April,
1882, on a day that was specially rich in spots, showed that the solar
heat could only have been diminished by about four-tenths of 1 per cent.
The observations made at Potsdam on the very days of Dr. Frdélich’s
observations show that the influence of the few spots then visible must
have been extraordinarily small, and that his temperature observations
must have at least ten times greater accuracy than now before he can
detect such influence. (7. O. G. M., XIX, p. 259.)

183. Dr. O. Frélich, in some remarks on methods of measuring solar
heat, states that he cannot agree with Langley in the assumption that
the atmospheric coefficient of absorption is proportional to the barome-
trie pressure, nor with his conclusions that the logarithmic. law holds
only for homogeneous rays and not for the whole spectrum. Frdélich’s
investigation of the absorption due to the altitude of the sun has the
advantage of Langley’s, in that the latter uses only two observations at
different altitudes while the former uses from four to fifteen. Frélich
also doubts the accuracy of Langley’s reduction to a standard measure.
He proposes to explain the movements of the granite pillar observed
by Forster (see chapter XII) as due, not to a change in the amount of
solar heat, but to a change in its character such that at the time of the
solar spot frequency the earth or the pillar absorbs relatively more
or less heat. Froélich defends himself against the criticisms of H. C.
Vogel to the effect that he has not been fully on his guard against
constant errors by referring to the fact that the most important novel
feature of his work lay in the constant reference to a normal standard,
and that nothing can diminish the certainty of the conclusion that his
observations demonstrate a sensible variation of solar heat during Au-
gust. In reference to the possibility of detecting changes in the sun’s
810 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

heat by Langley’s, Férster’s, and Frélich’s methods, he recognizes that
Forster’s granite pillar has a much more constant sensitivencss and
certainly changes very slowly; he has therefore undertaken a modifica-
tion of his own apparatus looking to an independence of the variations
of the temperature of the air. (Z. O. G. M., x1x, p. 400.)

184. Dr. W. Koppen publishes an interesting study of the effect of
hot, temperate, and cold weather on the organic world, and proposes a
new distribution of the limits of temperate zones, namely, the tropical
zone, Where every month the temperature is above 20° C.; the subtropie
zone, Whiere four to eleven months are hot, or above 20°; the temper-
ate zone, where from four to twelve months are temperate, namely,
from 10° to 20°, and this he divides into three subzones, the uniform
temperate, having hot summers and cool winters or temperate summers
and cold winters; the cold zone, where from one to four months are
moderate and the remainder cold; and the pelar climates, where all
months are cold, namely, under 10° ©. He shows that this empirical
division (lower than 10°, from 10° to 20°, and above 20° C.) accords rea-
sonably well with phenomena of animal and vegetable life. Everywhere
the progress of civilization has been from the warmer into the cooler
countries. (D. M. S., 1, p. 215.)

185. Dr. A. Woeikof, on the dependence of the daily variations of
temperature upon local circumstances, especially topography, formu-
lates his views about as fellows:

1. A convex surface, such as a hill or mountain, is a cause that dimin-
ishes the daily range of temperature, and by so much the more in pro-
portion to the ratio of the vertical to the horizontal dimensions.

2. A concave surface, as a valley or hollow, increases the daily range
cf temperature, but only up to certain limiting ratio of vertical and hori-
zontal dimensions.

3. AS anormal condition in respect to the daily amplitude he adopts
a perfect plane surface; he gives numerous examples of this, quoting the
. data from Asia and Europe; he eliminates the effect of cloudiness and
winds, and leaves the outstanding daily amplitude to be explained as
clue to the influence of the topography. Quantitatively it would seem
that the daily amplitude in the high valleys of the Indus, 3,500 meters
above the sea, in January and February, is greater than in some of
the driest places on the low plains of Northern India. (Z. 0. G..,
XVIII, p. 211.)

186. G. J. Symons gives the first results of simultaneous thermometric
and hygrometric observations at heights 4,170, and 260 feet, which were
made on behalf of the Royal Meteorological Society on the cathedral
tower at Boston. During clear November weather the average temper-
ature at the highest point was greater than at the earth’s surface by
reason of the excess of cold due to radiation at night, buton cloudy,
windy weather, the average temperature was lower above than below.
In foggy weather the temperature at the highest point was always higher
METEOROLOGY 311

than at the éarth’s stirface, but this is explained by the fact that gener-
ally the fog did not reach up to the higher point. (4. O. @. M., XIX, p. 84.)

187. Professor Wollny, investigating the influence of the ground upon
the temperature of the air, especially for altitudes up to 2 meters, shows
that the air above a field covered with vegetation is materially cooler than
that over one lying fallow, and again that the variations of temperature
above the former are less than above the latter. This he explains as due
to the fact that the vegetation prevents the direct warming of the soil
by the sun; and even more important is the consumption of heat in the
evaporation of water at the surface of the leaves. Similarly at night
time the plants prevent the cooling of the earth’s surface by radiation
during clear weather, and on the other hand themselves give out an ex-
traordinary amount of heat, whereby the cooling of the air is made still
less. Even this cooling process is, however, checked by the formation of
dew and the evolution of latent heat. The difference in temperature
over cultivated and uncultivated land diminishes in proportion as the
evaporation by day and the radiation by night are modified; therefore
it almost disappears in the winter season or in severe droughts, and es-
pecially in cloudy weather. (Z. O. G. M., XIX, p. 539.)

188. Dr. E. Lamp, of the Kiel Observatory, quotes observations show-
ing that it is not at all necessary, as frequently implied, that the tem-
perature should be uniform in different portions of a fog. Thus he ob-
served in a thermometer shelter -+2°.2 C.; in the free air near by+19°.8;
at the summit of the wind tower [for anemometer exposure ?], +4°.2; at
its bottom, +?°.6; at the base of the observatory hill, —0°.2; on the
side of the hill rapid variations of temperature within five minutes
from +2°.0 to +0°.5. The observations were not taken with a sling-
thermometer, as would have been preferable. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 474.)

189. [These, like the numerous observations made by Prof. H. A.
Hazen in various parts of Washington, show that great local tempera-
ture differences invariably exist, so that the meteorologist, in choosing
the exposure for his thermometer, must be guided by the object of in-
vestigation or the use to which his figures will probably be put. At
Columbus, Ohio, Louisville, Ky., and Davenport, Iowa, differences, on
cold, clear nights, of 25° F. have been observed. The Signal Service
rule (partly necessity and partly justified by the results) is to place the
thermometer shelter on the highest available point, like the roofs of
houses or towers, in the cities where the stations must do their work.
The local difference of temperature of the air over cities and forests and
prairies is in this way reduced to a minimum in the daily telegraphic
work, and we attain for general weather predictions the average tem.
perature of the mass of air blowing past the station. Were any other,
especially any very low-ground exposure adopted, it would be proper
and necessary to reduce such observations up to the uniform height of
about 100 feet above the surface of the ground. |

logical Society a revision of his work on the distribution of temperattire
over the British islands. AJ the data accessible to him have been re-
duced uniformly to consistency with the twenty-four-year interval, 1857
to 1880, inclusive. The isotherms of January show distinetly the in-
closed cord area in the northern part of Iceland and the northeastern
third of Great Britain. The winter temperature diminishes as we pro-
ceed inward more rapidly than would correspond to elevation only. The
influence of the prevailing west-southwest winds is, of course, to bring
the warmer ocean temperatures up over the land, and an elevation of a
few thousand feet would cover the British isles with glacial snow. The
remarkable difference between the Scottish and Welsh highlands is
clearly seen in the dry, cool air of the Scotch, and the warm, moist at-
mosphere of the Welsh. (Z. O. G. M., XVII, p. 401.)

191. A. G. Hégbom has studied the change in isotherms in the au-
tumn over Northern Europe in a manner corresponding to Hildebrands-
son’s study of isotherms for the spring. His tables show that the ad-

.vantage of a maritime climate and the disadvantage of a continental
climate on the growth of vegetation are more marked in the autumn than
in the spring. ~ (Z20.5G.. M., Xix, p. 112.)

192. Prof. H. Riesenberger has, at his own expense, carried out tem-
perature observations at three mountain stations for comparison with
observations made by himself at Hermannstadt. The altitudes of the
four stations are, respectively, 411, 953, 1,318, and 1,598 meters. The
diminution of temperature with altitude is very slow, corresponding to
that found on plateaus rather than on mountains. In December the
diminution occasionally becomes an increase. The rate of diminution
has also a large daily period, it being slowest at 7. A. M., when itis 1° C.
for 456 meters, while at 2 P. M. it is 1° for every 144 meters. (Z. O. G.
M., X1X, p. 456.)

193. Dr. A. Lugli has investigated a formula for expressing the con-
nection between the monthly and annual mean temperature in Italy
with the latitude and altitude above sea-level. He finds for the stations
of the Apennines and those south of the Alps as well as the low sta-
tious the following formula for the mean annual temperature: t=13°.86
+ 0°.67(45°—¢))—0°.0055 h. He then examines the mean temperatures
for each month, and determines for each the special valnes of the three
constants in this formula, which vary as follows: The change of tem-
perature for 1° of latitude is a minimum in the summer, having an aver-
age value of 0°,30 for April, May, June, and July; it is a maximum in
winter, having a value of 19.36 for December. The diminution of tem-
perature for 100 meters of ascent has an average value of 0°.51 for the
year, the maximum being 0°,64 for April, and the minimum 0°.36 for
January. The author then combines the highest Alpine stations with
those in his sub-Alpine districts, and with these again revises his cal-
culations, deducing general values, representing especially the condi-
tions for the latitudes 399.4, and 45°, respectively. The mean annual
chauge for a degree of latitude at 45° is 0°,72 C, and for 100 meters of
METEOROLOGY 313

ascent 0°.52 C. At 31°.4 the change for latitude is 0°.56, and for alti-
tude 69.58. (Z. O. G. M., XIx, p. 459.)

194. [Similar computations for the Rocky Mountain and Plateau re-
gions of the United States, as made by Prof. W. Upton, will be found
in the Annual Report of the Chief Signal Officer for 1882, and afford
interesting bases for comparisons with the above Italian observations. |

195. O. Doering has investigated the variability of the temperature
in the Argentine Republic and South America, following out the sug-
gestions in Hann’s memoir of 1875, on the variability of daily tempera-
tures. Doering utilizes twenty years of observations at Buenos Ayres.
His figures give the mean variability as depending upon non periodic
temperature changes for the individual months and years. Sudden
changes upward are more frequent than falls in temperature. Ten days
of more than 5° change are likely to occur in a year. The north wind
brings the greatest rise in temperature, the southeast wind the least.
With regard to falls in temperature, these come with southerly winds,
and are preceded by northerly winds. The greatest falls in tempera-
ture occur without rain more frequently than with rain. (7% O. G. JL,
XIX, p. 507.) ;

196. Sir G. B. Airy compares the temperatures of the water of the
Thames with the corresponding temperature of the air; he finds that
the water averages 1°.5 F. higher than that of the air according to the
Greenwich thermometers; the mean diurnal range of water temperature
was 20.1 F. (Nature, Xxvil, p. 129.)

197. Prof. von Miller-Hauenfels states that the curvature upward
of the isothermal surfaces inside of a mountain mass has lately been
quoted as an argument against the melted condition of the earth’s in-
terior, but it seems to him that, independent of any view that one may
have with regard to this source of heat, such an upward curvature of
the surfaces must take place under any circumstances. In general,
temperature increases toward the center of the earth, but with a ra-
pidity variable according to the time of the year. Now, according to
well-known laws, the transmission of heat upwards must take place in
direetions normal to the surface, and these normal lines being perpen-
dicular to the surfaces of equal temperature, tbe latter must necessarily
rise up in the interior of a mountain mass. (Z. O. G@. M., X1x, p. 297.)

198. Prof. W. Schwalbe communicates to the Physical Society nu-

tains that a sufficient explanation of this phenomenon has not yet been
offered. (Nature, XXVII, p. 330.)

nual maximum takes place on the 25ta of July, and the minimuin on
the 20th of January. He finds a negative evaporation during the win-
ter months, which must be an error in his instruments unless, indeed,
the deposit of fog and dew is extraordinarily heavy. He finds the
ratio between the evaporation in perfectly free spaces and that from
an evaporimeter established in an ordinary thermometer shelter to
vary between one and three, (Z. O. G. M., XVU, p. 242.)

200. [The relative amounts of evaporation from snow, ice, fresh and
salt water, in full sunshine and cloud, calm and wind, is a matter that
still needs to be well determined. }

201. Dr. J. Hann, in his new edition of Jelinek’s Instructions for tak-
ing Meteorological Observations, has introduced tables for the convenient
computation of the quantity of vapor contained in any atmospheric strata
as well as its influence on barometric hypsometry. He first states that
the formula published by him ten years ago still represents more recent
observations in the higher atmospheric strata. He then applies this
equation to the computation of the probable moisture at elevated sta-
tions in Austria, Italy, Ceylon, Java, England, Switzerland, and shows
that wherever we have observations the prediction by means of this
formula is well verified, so far as regards monthly and annual or even
weekly averages.

This reliability justifies us in using the computed values of vapor ten-
sion when actual observations are missing. The effect of this moisture
upon the barometric computation of altitudes amounts to as much as 17
meters for an altitude of 2,000 meters in a moist, warm climate like Cey-
lon, but only 6 meters in a cooler climate, such as Switzerland; in both
cases the correction for vapor gives higher altitudes.

The efiect of vapor in diminishing the density of the air, thus giving
rise to ascending currents, is sensible, but very slight in comparison with
the effect of ordinary changes of temperature; thus the entire vapor in
a mass of air 2,000 meters deep is only equivalent to the influence of a
change of 19.3 C. in temperature, and, as the temperature changes may
easily amount to ten times this figure, they are relatively much more
important.

By integrating the proper equation Hann deduces the formula for
computing the weight of water in a column of air of any height, whence,
of course, the amount contained in the whole earth’s atmosphere can be
deduced: <( 2.00 .(\G.0M, | XT xan. L2G.)

202. W. Képpen describes the process of growth of a cumulus cloud
ju the warmest partof the day. He finds that the highest point moves:
forward more rapidly than the lower part of the cloud; that this disap-
pears little by little, while a lower portion of the cloud has risen up to
the same height; this again in its turn disappears, to be replaced by the
upgrowth of a next lower portion, and soon. He explains this as due
to the fact that the cumulus is really the head of an ascending mass of
moist air, and is driven along by winds tbat have a greater velocity
METEOROLOGY. , 315

above than below. On the other hand, it will o¢casionalky happen that
the upper currents are slower cr reversed, in which case the summit of
the cumulus follows instead of preceding the main cloud. (D. M. Z., 1,
p- 29.)

203. [Two facts not mentioned by Képpen should be remembered in
order to achieve a fuller explanation of cloud phenomena, namely, that
the upper part of the cumulus cloud is surrounded at a little distance
by the drier air into which it has risen, which, therefore, tends to evap-
orate and dissipate the surface of the cloud; and, again, the powerful
effect of the solar rays (which inereases slightly with altitude) is to
evaporate the moisture at the surface of the cloud and to surround the:
whole sunny side of the cloud with a thin layer of hot moist air, which
must have a special ascensional tendency. This action of the sun is
undoubtedly also very efficacious on the upper surface of extensive lay-
ers of stratus clouds from which vapor currents rise, which in turn form
a second layer at some distance above, while the density of the whole
mass of warmed cloud and air is diminished, and an additional ascensive
tendency is felt at the earth’s surface over a large and extended terri-
tory. |

204. The increasing interest in the observations of clouds has led
van Bebber and Koéppen to attempt a system of corresponding obser-
vations, which were planned after consultation with Dr. Klein and
Moller and Assmann. The same methods of description are used at all
stations, and the complete record of clouds is made a part of the regu-
lar entries in the daily journal as well as in the special records. (D.
e170.)

205. Rev. Clement Ley, in an essay on the structure of the cirro-filum,
or thread-like clouds, presumably formed of ice spicula, states that this,
is one of the most important forms in the prediction of the weather; he;
has observed it for twenty-five years, and offers a classification of the:
more reliable observations and an explanation of some of the more prom-.
ipent phenomena. His cilassification.of the clouds relates to their form,,
their structure, and their relations to each other. The following three:
generalizations seem to him of importance:

1. If we turn the face toward the wind as we stand on the earth’s sur-
face, then in the majority of cases the upper currents of air move from
the right to the left. ;

2. Winds from the west lic above those from the east in the upper re-
gions of the atmosphere much more frequently than is the case at the
earth’s surface.

3. The upper strata of the air as a rule move much more rapidly than
the lower. He gives a table showing the number of cases in which the
cirro-filum cloud moves from the respective points of the compass. He
restricts the name cirrus to the upper clouds formed of bent or twisted
bundles of threads, whereas those composed of long lines or tilaments
have a much greater velocity, and are characterized by him as linear
316 SEIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

clouds, or cirro-filum; of these latter we must distinguish the direction
of the motion of individual particles trom the direction in which the
long threads trend. This latter direction he calls the filature of the
threads, and is determined by the location in the horizon of the vanish-
ing point of two or more parallel threads. The apparent velocity is
expressed on a scale of 3, namely, 0, calm; 1, slow movement; 2, mod-
erate, and 3, a rapid movement. There is a form of cloud which Ley
calls the pseudo-cirrus, which appears at low altitudes, having an ap-
parent rapid movement, and is erroneously taken for true cirrus. He
apparently distinguishes one from the other by the rapidity of the
movement, and states that he has never seen a true cirrus with a rapid
movement. His tables of the results of over 3,000 observations, mostly
by himself and friends in England, allow him to conclude as follows:

1. The movements of the cirro-filum are more frequent in the diree-
tion of the length than at right angles thereto.

2. The cases in which the vanishing points lie on the right-hand side
of the direction from which the clouds themselves move are for north
and west movements by far the most frequent, but for south or south-
east movements the vanishing points more frequently lie on the left-
hand side of that direction.

3. Great velocities of movement are confined to those cases in which
the direction of filature nearly or wholly agrees with the direction of
motion, and cases in which they are at right PuSIES to each other never
occur with great velocities.

The explanation of these rules he arrives at by the study of the lower
forms of clouds. He finds that on account of the difference in rapidity
and direction of the velocity of different parts of the cumulus clouds,
even the lower cumuli manifest a tendency toassume a form that reminds
one of streaks and threads. Especially is this the case when streaks of
snow falling from the summits of these clouds give rise to what he calls
** pseudo-cirrus-pendulus;” these fall at first vertically, but subsequently
are deflected or bent and twisted by the movement of the air into
which they fall. Now the true cirro-filum is oftenfound on the extreme
limit of a cyclone, and therefore several hundred miles from the center,
so that it is impossible to observe the process of formation of the
whole thread. It happens, however, that in otherwise clear weathera
local rain cloud sometimes develops a great quantity of cirri-filum, and
then it is possible to observe the process without difficulty. Some miles
from the observer on a summer day there forms a heavy cumulus; if,
as frequently happens, an almost perfect calm prevails in the atmosphere
up to analtitude of 12,000 or 14,000 feet the cumulus retains its hemi-
spherical form, and thus there comes to be an enormous accumulation
of cloud that can easily amount to a hundred cubic miles, and its dark
color shows that the water-drops of which it consists are very close to-
gether. [This statement as to color seems to be rather an assumption
thana well-warranted conclusion; do not the size, form, and number of the
METEOROLOGY. Oat

drops all contribute to the shade?] So long as such clouds retain their
sharp upper limit and their general spherical shape, no rain falls from
them. Suddenly the summit has a softer appearance, extends itself side-
ways in cirrus-like threads, and immediately the rain plunges down out of
the cloud. The electric tension which hindered the conjunction of the
water particles that form the cloud, so long as they retained their spher-
ical form, is suddenly diminished in the upper part of the cloud as soon as
the little spheres freeze into ice needles or spicule, from whose points
and corners the electricity immediately escapes. [The easy escape of
electricity from snow-crystals is a matter which should easily be con-
firmed by observation; it agrees with the high potential observed dur-
ing snow-storms.| The minute bodies having lost their electricity, unite
and absorb in their rapid descent the smaller particles of water with
which they come in contact. [Do the spicule and snow-flakes descend
rapidly enough to overtake particles of water?] The falling rain, and
perhaps still more the sudden fightning, when such occurs, further con-
tribute to draw the electricity from the cloud or lower its electric poten-
tial; the rain continues until the whole or nearly the whole lower part
of the cloud disappears. In those cases in which not only in the lower
but also in the upper strata of the atmosphere only slight movements
prevail, the ice-cloud remaining at the summit becomes a true cirrus,
whose curled and twisted form is probably a consequence of temporary
irregularities in the pressure of the air due to the condensation and
formation of ice. A cirrus which is formed in this way remains some-
times more than twenty-four hours almost perfectly without motion in
the sky, but more frequently it moves slowly into regions into which
the rain-shower out of which it originated has not been visible. If the
upper and lower parts of this cloud do not move at the same rapidity
it will be drawn out into the long cirro-filam cloud, and this probably
often occurs when the upper part of the original cumulus has penetrated
some cool upper current of air, whose coolness has, in fact, frozen the
vapor into snow. If the motion of the cloud follows the direction of the
movement of these threads, or is directly opposed to it, the angle of fil-
ature will be zero. The actual filature angle is the resultant of the
movement of the upper current carrying the snow crystals in one direc-
tion, while the lower current carries the cloud, with its perpetually re-
newed summit, in another direction; by constructing the triangle or
parallelogram of motions, we can thus either construct the resulting, or
analyze the observed, filature. The observed result as above given,
namely, that the positive angle of filature occurs principally with the
movement of the clouds toward north and west, and the negative angle
with movement towards southeast, shows that the upper currents of air
are from the north and west when the lower current is from the south
or west, so that the axis of the cloud must then deviate from its summit
toward the right; on the other hand, southeast upper winds are most

frequent as the immediate followers of southeast lower winds. (D. J. Z.,
1, p. 261.)

206. [Without in the least detracting from the criginality and great
value of Clement Ley’s laborious observations and well-grounded defi-
nite results, it is at least proper to state that on pages 48, 49, and 179
of Espy’s Fourth Meteorological Report and in others of Espy’s writings
will be found results almost precisely the same as those of Clement Ley.
The reader who consults this, the last work published by spy, scarcely
a year before he died, will perhaps be glad to have his attention called
to Espy’s labors subsequent to the publication of his Philosophy of
Storms. After returning from Larope, Espy was, in 1842, appointed
meteorologist in the office of the Surgeon-General of the Army (Gen-
eral Lawson). His first Meteorological Repert, dated October, 1843,
and printed in February, 1845, was addressed to Surgeon-Gezeral
Lawson. His second report, dated November, 184°, was addressed
to William B. Preston, Secretary of the Navy, from which we infer
that he had been in the mean time transferred to the Navy Depart-
ment, but I have not yet been able to find that this report was ever
separately published. His third report, dated Cctober, 1850, with notes,
dated January and October, 1851, and an appendix containing rules
to mariners, dated January, 1851, seems to have been addressed to
Secretary W. A. Graham, but to have been published by Secretary
J.C. Dobbin in 1852,and it was preceded by a reprint cf the first
and second reports. The fourth report was evidently written orig-
inally in October, 1852, but was not forwarded by the Secretary of the
Navy until specially called for by resolution of Congress, July 24, 1854,
nor was it even then printed until a special order was issued in 1857.
In the printing additional notes were evidently inserted, most of which
may be considered as dating from 1857. The contents of the resulting
quarto volume, usually called “ Espy’s Fourth Report,” and whose title-
page bears date of 1857, may therefore be approximately analyzed as
follows: First report, of 1843, pp. 1-10; second report, of 1549, pp. 10-
40; third report, of 1850, pp. 40-96; appendix to third report, 1851,
pp. 97-116; fourth report, of 1852, pp. 117-178; additional notes of
1857, pp. 178-234.

Both directly and indirectly the United States owes to Espy the
stimulus and knowledge that made our present Weather Bureau a pos-
sibility. In all that pertains to the formation of cloud and rain, the verti-
cal distribution of temperature, the theory of the psychrometer, the
diurnal periodicity in the winds, the streeture of thunder and _ hail
storms, tornadoes, and general storms, he was far in advance of his
time. The republication of his minor works and an analysis of his life
and influence would afford a most delightful picture and instructive his-
tory.]|

of festooned or pocky clouds, such as Poey proposes to call globo-cumu-
lus. (Nature, XXVIII, p. 79.)

208. Mr. John Aitken and Dr. O. L. Lodge have made numerous ex-
periments to elucidate the reasons for the so-called clear spaces which
are absolutely free from dust in the neighborhood of solid bodies (the so-
called dark plane of Professor Tyndalland Lord Raleigh). They conclude
that the dust is repelled from hot surfaces in the same way as the vane
of a Crookes radiometer is repelled when placed in front of a hot sur-
face, namely, one hotter than the intervening gas, the principal part of
the energy of the motion being given to the repelled surface or dust
particle by the kinetic energy of the impinging molecules; the attrac-
tion of a cold surface is explained by the less kinetie energy of the out-
ward-going molecules of the hotter gas. A wet and hot surface repelled
dust twice as strong as a hot, dry surface. Mr. Aitken, led by these
views, constructed a dust trap by means of a tall metal tube surrounded
by another larger. The smoke goes up the center tube and down the
intervening space; the soot is deposited on the cool inside of the outer
tube, so that air can be purified by heating and cooling it a number of
times. Dr. Lodge found the dust coat to increase greatly with high
temperatures; he rejects the explanations given by Tyndall, Frankland,
and Lord Raleigh; he especially examines the effect of convecticn cur-
rents in the air under high pressure, and even in water, and thinks the
main causes are the molecular bombardment and the gravitative set-
tling. His complete theory is published in the Philosophical Magazine
for March and April, 1884. (Natwre, Xx1x, pp. 322, 417, 611.)

209. Prof. Lodge states that the concentrated radiation from an elec-
tric light is much less effective in warming dusty air than is the neigh-
borbood of a slightly warmed solid. (Nature, xxx, p. 53.)

210. Mr. E. W. Serrell explains the flotation or buoyancy of cloud
particles, and also of dust, as due to adherent, heated, and dilated air,
namely, the sclar radiation obstructed by the particle, and consequently
giving rise to minute convection currents.

211. |The present writer remembers the conversation had with Mr.
Serrell in 1880, to which he refers in his letter, wherein I suggested that
the flotation of vapor particles at upper surface of clouds in the atmos-
phere, under the influence of sunlight, was due to their evaporation and
heating, by which the whole cloud is more buoyant. This, however, is
hardly parallel to the experiments made in a laboratory, where radiation
is of much less importance, in comparison with the condition of heat
by convection and kinetic molecular processes. }

212. The observations-with silk fibers, suggested by Serrell in 1880,
seem to have lately been made by Prof. G. I’. Fitzgerald, of the Dublin
Royal Society. (Nature, xxx, p. 331.)

213. On the 28th of March, 1884, Prof. Osborne Reynolds, in a lec-
ture at the Royal Institution, summarized his results up to that time,
giving additional new experiments on water and air, which are both

novel in hydro-mechanics and also extremely suggestive to the students
of atmospheric motions and cloud formation. (Nature, xxx, p. 88.)

214. G. H. Darwin communicates to the Royal Society of London an
extensive paper upon the formation of ripple marks in sand. This is
not only a very suggestive phenomenon in hydrodynamics, but, as the
author suggests, may possibly have a bearing on the mode of formation
of the “‘mackerel sky” and other forms of cirrus. [As regards the
formation of the long cirrus threads, we should prefer the explanation
by Rev. Clement Ley to that given by Darwin.] (Nature, xx1x, p. 161.)

215. Prof. J. W. Mallet has made an extensive compilation of data
relating to the analysis of drinking-water and rain-water, which is pub-
lished as a report to the United States National Board of Health.

216. A. von Danckelman, of Leipsic, has investigated the observa-
tions of precipitation made in Saxony, 1864 to 1881. Among his results
we quote the following:

The maximum probability of rain (0.63) falls in the decade March 2
to 11; also June 30 to July 9, and November 27 to December 6. The
minimum probability (0.40) occurs in the decades September 28 to Octo-
ber 7, and May 11 to 20.

The relative number of days of snow and days of rain are in the
winter 56, spring 22, and autumn 13 percent. The number of days free
from snow varies from 204 at one station to 157 at different stations.
(220 8G sais. XV EL, p.392.)

217. Dr. J. Miiller gives a very complete collection of the results of
observations of rain and snow in Switzerland, some of the longer series
representing sixty years of observations. The region of greatest sum-
mer rain is on the northern side of the Alps; in this region the winter
and autumn rains increase from east to west, but the summer rains di-
minish; the region of minimum rainfall embraces the Canton of Tessin.
(Z. O}- GM. XIx,-p. 343.)

218. Professor Tépfer has published an elaborate investigation into
the rainfall of Germany, which is printed by the association at Gorlitz.
He finds that the upper stations have a much more uniform distribution
of rain through the year. The heaviest rainfall in stations of long series
occurred at Klausthal and Freudenstadt and the summit of the Brocken;
the least occurred at Wustrow and Muhlhausen. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 258.)

219. E. Millosevich has published. an exhaustive monograph on the
distribution of rainfall in Italy. Italy possesses many stations having
very long series of observations on rainfall; for instance, Padua, 155
years; Milan, 116; Verona, 81; Palermo, 74; Pavia, 63; Naples, 59;
Rome, 55; &c. These, therefore, give the author opportunity to study
not only the geographical but also the chronological distribution and
periodicity. Im a land of such varied topography the variations of
climate are so great that it would be impossible in the present summary
to give any idea of the richness of the storehouse of information con-
tained in this volume. (Z. 0. G. M., xrx, p. 49.)
METEOROLOGY. 321

_ 220. Dr. V. Kremzer has studied the variability ot rainfall in Europe,
following the path of Hann, von Danckelmann, and others. Among
the general conclusions to be drawn from his tables we note the follow-
ing:

1. The mean variability in quantity of rainfall increases With dimin-
ishing latitude, and the more rapidly in proportion as we penetrate the
region of subtropical rains.

2. From the records for Padua for 150 years he finds that the error
of the mean annual rainfall as computed for any 30 years will be 1 per
cent. and the largest probable error 2.5 per cent.

3. The sources of variation in rainfall measures due to changes in the
observers, in the exposure of gauges, and in the general changes of the
regions surrounding the gauges, are all included in the above figures
for the actual rainfall; he makes a special illustration of the effect of
these sources of error in the case of the records at Breslau, where the
great mean variability and annual variability is largely traceable to

instrumental changes.

4. As to stations that lie in the rain shadow of a mountain chain, they
also have a higher variability because of this location than do those
stations that lie on the opposite side of the mountain and receive an
excess of rain. In this respect he examines especially the records from
Italy and the Hartz Mountains.

5. In reference to elevation above sea level, the variability of rain is
much less for an entirely plane surface considerably elevated above the
sea, but the contrary if mountains intersect an elevated plain. As re-
gards the relation between coast and interior stations, the former have
the greater variability. .

6. As regards the seasons, the greatest variability belongs to the cold
season of the year, while ‘the least variability or greater uniformity
belongs to the season of vegetation.

Kremzer gives convenient general tables for deducing the number
of years of observations necessary in order to obtain an annual mean of
a given accuracy; thus for a station whose annual variability is 20. per
cent., 11.8 years will be required to obtain a mean rainfall correct to
within 5 per cent. The probable errors of the monthly rainfall for any
one station as based on observations for 10 years are as follows: For
Algiers 22 per cent., southern Spain 19, lower Italy 18, Central Italy 16,
upper Italy 15, Switzerland 14, Germany 12 and 11.

The above remarks refer to percentages of rainfall, taking the annual
and monthly mean total quantities as the basis; in a subsequent section
on the actual rainfall he discusses the occurrence of dry and wet periods.
By combining together all his rainfall records for Europe, he obtains a
general mean which must have some cosmic or extended terrestrial rela-
tion. Combining each year with its neighboring years he obtains a
smoothed curve, which is expressed in the second column of the following
table in percentages of the departure of the quantity of rain from its

S. Mis. 33 21

normal value. The wonderful agreement of these variations with the va-
riations of Wolf’s sun-spot numbers shows that we have here to do with
some general feature connecting the earth and sun, the inflections of the
rain-curve following those of the sun-spot by an interval of about one

year.

221. G. J. Symons, of London, gives an important discussion of the
variation in annual rainfall for the years 1830 to 1881 in England. The
mean of nine stations is reduced to annual percentages, the extreme range
of which is from 71 per cent. in 1854, up to 136 per cent. in 1852. From
1853 to 1859, inclusive, the rainfall was below the average; from 1875 to
1881, it was decidedly above the average. Hann remarks that this dry
period prevailed also on the northern side of the Alps, while the wet pe-
riod prevailed over the whole of Western and Central Europe. The very
dry period that prevailed in Hungary, 1861 to 1866, was not prominent
in England. In general, the average variability of English rainfall is
about 14 per cent. of its mean quantity, but it amounts to about 40 per
cent. each half century. The wet and dry years apparently arrange
themselves in series of ten and twelve years respectively; thus the wet
years are. 1836, 1848, 1860, 1372; the dry years are 1834, 1844, 1854,
1864, and 1874. (Z. O. G. M., Xvim, p. 387.)

222. I’. Augustin has studied the rainfall at Prague, especially as to
its daily periodicity, having at his disposal twenty years’ observations
with a self-recording rain-gauge; he finds it impossible to give the mean
annual periodicity, especially because of the difficulty of measuring the
snow in winter time, and the loss of occasional very heavy rainfalls in
Summer time, but the daily maxima and minima stand forth very clearly.
As regards quantity of rainfall, the principal maximum occurs between
4 and 5 p. M., shortly after the temperature maximum. A second max-
imum occurs between 9 and 10 P. M.; a third maximum between 9 and
10 A.M. The principal minimum occurs about 4 A. M., a second min-
imum between 7 and 8 P.M., and a third minimum between 11 A. M. and
noon. With regard to the frequency of rain, there are also three maxima
and three minima, as follows: The principal maximum, 7 to 8 P. M.;

the secondary maxima, between 8and 9 A. M., and between 2 and 3 P. M.;-

the principal minimum, between 2 and 3 A.M.; the secondary minima,
about noon and between 4 and 5 Pp. M.

METEOROLOGY. 323

The intensity of the rainfall or the quantity per hour changes very
nearly as the total quantity; the probability of rain follows the curve
of rain frequency. (Z. O. G. M., xvu, p. 243.)

223. I’. Seeland, of Klagenfurt, has studied the daily record of the
height of water in the wells fed by subterranean springs at Klagenfurt
during the five years 1878 to 1882; the height of water is, of course, a
general result of the rainfall of the whole of the surrounding basin,
which extendsfrom northwest to southeast. Al] the springs in this basin
show similar phenomena; the lowest average reading prevailedin 1878 ;
the highest in 1879. Comparison with the rainfall at one station,
Klagenfurt, scarcely gives any satisfactory basis for unraveling the
complicated phenomenon. The highest rainfall occurred in 1787 and
the least in 1881. (Z. O. G. M., XVII, p. 339.)

224. H. F. Blanford, director of the Meteorological Office in India,
from a study of the connection between snowfall in the Himalaya and
the subsequent dry winds of Northern India, draws the following con-
clusions:

1. A remarkably heavy and especially a late snowfall in the Northwest
Himalayas is followed by a long period of drought on the plains of
Northwest and Western India.

2. A rich winter and spring precipitation at the stations of the North-
western Himalayas is followed in sixteen cases out of eighteen by a de-
ficient summer rain on the plains of Northwest India, and vice versa.

3. The west winds that are characteristic as abnormal during droughts
in west and north India are identical in character with the normal
winds of the regular dry season, and appear to be fed by descending
currents from the Northwest Himalayas and possibly from the mount-
ains on the west.

4. It is an ordinary well-known phenomenon of the winter months
that a fall of rain and snow in the Northwest Himalayas is direetly fol-
lowed by a wave of high pressure that progresses from the western lills
toward the east, accompanied by a cool northwest wind.

&. The conclusion that seems to follow is that an unusual extension of

thesnow-coveringin the Northwest Himalaya acts upon the higher levels
in summer like the ordinary fall of snow and rain in the lower regions
of the Himalayas in the winter time,and favors the formation of the
dry northwest winds on the plain of Western India.
, 6. That the dependence of the dry winds upon the Himalaya snow-
fall offers a criterion for the prediction of the probability of a drought
in Northwestern and Western India. (Z. 0. G. JL, X1x, p. 378, and Na-
ture, XXX, p. 46.)

225. U. I’. Blanford, in studying the theory of the-winter rains in
Northern India, concludes that the aqueous vapor evaporated from the
earth’s surface diffuses gradually upwards in the quiet atmosphere of
Northern India and reaches an altitude favoring the condensation into
cloud. When once in this way a moderately thick bank of cloud has
a

324 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

been formed, the equilibrium is soon disturbed, the diminution of tem-
perature under the cloud is slower and the average temperature there-
fore higher. This suffices to inaugurate an inflow of air from all sides
and an ascending motion and a falling barometer. Warm, moist air
blows up from the south and we have the conditions for the winter rains.
If this is correct we must consider the quiet calm air as the initial con-
dition, but this calm is due to the existence of the high chain of mount-
ains that surrounds Northern India on the east, north, and west. Were
these absent the strong, dry northeast winds would carry away the va-
por and the weather would be similar to that of Southern China.

226. [This is also a very fair description of the growth of a storm-
center in the region west of the Mississippi, such as occasionally takes
place directly under the observation of the Signal Office.] (2. 0. @. IL,
XIX, p. 452.)

227. A. Richter, of Ebersdorf, has discussed the observations made
at that place for six years on the direction of movement of the upper
clouds, with the following results: The mean direction of the move-
ment is from the point south 84° W., but for observations made one or
more days before rain the direction is from a more northerly point, and
for observations made a few hours before rain the direction is from a
more southerly point. The probability of rain within twenty-four hours
is greatest (65 per cent.) when the clouds move from the southwest; the
general probability that rain will follow within twenty four hours after
an observed cirrus is 56 per cent.; but rain fell on 58 per cent. of all
the days in these six years; therefore, in general, the cirrus precedes
non-rainy weather. This is explained by the fact that cirrus observations
cannot be made when low clonds obscure the heavens, on which days
the probability of rain is greatest. The direction of cirrus movement
is for winter from the N. 82° W., and for summer 8. 74° W. Using the
wind direction as observed at a more favorable station five miles dis-
tant, it is found that the cirrus deviates from the wind most frequently
by angles of plus or minus 45°, but the probability of rain is less when
the wind is opposed to the cirrus than when the directions agree, and
similar results are found by comparing the cirrus and lower clouds. On
special days of low barometer the direction of the cirrus has no appar-
ent influence upon the rainfall, but when the barometer is simply fall-
ing with a southwest wind the occurrence of cirrus movements nearly
coinciding with that of the wind is in 73 per cent. of such cases followed
by rain, while with northeast winds only 43 per cent. are followed by
rain. _(D. M. Z., 1, p:.319:)

228. Prof. H. Klein proposes to make more use than hitherto of ob-
servations of the cirrus clouds for purposes of weather prediction. The
difficulty lies mostly in the fact that all observations must be made at
the earth’s surface, and we therefore know but little of their altitude
and thickness. Systematic observations, however, have lately been
made both by himself at Cologne and by Neumeyer at Hamburg, from
METEOROLOGY. 395

which he indicates a few rules additional to the ideas previously pub-
lished by others. Thus he states that when a thin cirrus are appears
upon the western horizon with its summit in the west, this surrounds a
depression still further west moving eastward, and will be followed in
four to eight hours by a heavy rain. Again, if for twelve hours the
cirrus clouds moving from the west occupy ouly the southern horizon,
then for the next day we expect an east wind; but if the cirrus move
from the southeast many dry days of east winds are to be expected,
and if the cirri move from the east-northeast, or the east, a continuous
dry weather may be expected.

229. [The importance of studying the movements of both upper and
lower clouds which had already been abundantly indicated by Espy
and Redfield and others, led the present writer to include all of these
in his daily telegraphic dispatches for the Daily Weather Bulletin of
the Cincinnati Observatory, the publication of which began in Septem-
ber, 1869. The daily manuscript weather map of the Army Signal Office
began in 1871 to show the direction and kind of clouds, and the util-
ization of cirrus and other cloud movements for the anticipation of
storms, and even as a first indication of the formation of a new storm-
center, growing up immediately under one’s eyes, became a matter of
daily practice from that time.] (24. 0. G. M., Xvi, p. 220.)

230. J. Damian, of Innspruck, by careful observations of the clouds
during June, 1832, has endeavored to determine the relation between
the rainfall and the upper and lower currents of air. He finds the
quantity of rain greatest when the lower current is from the southwest
and the upper current from the north, but least when the lower current
is from the north with the upper from the south. When the angular
deviation between the direction of the two currents is 23° he finds one
case with rain and six without rain; when it is 45° the numbers are 1
and 9, respectively ; when it is 90° the numbers are 2 and 8; for 135°
the numbers are 8 and 3; for 1809, 4 and 1, which results are equiva-
lent to saying that the more nearly the upper are opposed to each other
the more likely is rain to follow. (Z. 0. G. M., xvut, p. 345.)

231. G. Mantel gives in the Swiss Annuaire for 1882 a study into the
connection between the number of clear and cloudy days in any period
and the mean cloudiness of that period. His investigation is partly
mathematical and partly based on actual observations. He shows that
assuming a mean daily cloudiness of 1 on a seale of 10 for the clear
days, 9 for the cloudy days, and 5 for the remaining days, we can com-
pute the mean cloudiness even for a period of months in close agree-
ment with direct daily observation. (Z. O. G. M., XIx, p. 346.)

232. Grossman has studied the connection between the mean cloudi-
ness of any period and the number of clear and cloudy days, in a man-
ner similar to the study of G. Mantel for Switzerland. Grossman has
tested Mantel’s Swiss formula by application to the German stations;
he finds that the monthly mean cloudiness (C) can be expressed as a
326 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

function of the difference between the number of cloudy and clear days

by the formula C=53 + * (cloudy-clear), where » is the whole number

of days in the period. He, however, does not recommend that we give
up computing mean cloudiness by taking the actual average of each
day’s actual observation. (D. M. Z., I, p. 341.)

233. Roscoe and Stewart publish the results of observations made at
Kew, 1875-82 on solar radiation or the heat of sunshine as registered
by Campbell’s sunshine recorder ; the original form of this apparatus
consists of a wooden block with a hemispherical depression into which
is inserted a spherical lens so that the focus of the lens lies at the sur-
face of the wood, and it is assumed that the sun’s rays char or burn the
block in proportion to their intensity and duration. One block lasts
from June 21 to December 21, and is then changed for a second block
to last from December 21 to June 21. Twenty-four years of observations
seem to show that the quantity of solar heat received by the block is
greater from December to June than from June to December (due to
cloudy weather?); there is also a slight trace of a double variation in-
side of each sun-spot period. .(Z. O. G. M., X1x, p. 546.)

234, Prof. J. M. Pernter has made a collection of data relative to the
amount of sunshine received at different places on the northern hemi-
sphere, and the few stations given by him serve to increase the interest in
this important climatic and meteorologic element. His tables give the
hourly and monthly averages and totals of the amount of sunshine re-
corded by the Beck-Campbell sunshine register for five stations in Europe,
one in Asia, and four in Canada, all for the year 1882. [Records have
been maintained for a number of years with this instrument at Wash-
ington, but have not yet been reduced and published. In fact some
doubt seems to have arisen as to the value of these records.] Pernter ex-
presses the wish that the publication of the results of the sunshine-reg-
ister should be given by hours and tenths of hours, not the hourly means
expressed as rates per day, and not the monthly means, but the hourly
totals and the monthly totals. From his examination of the records
it seems that the depression in the curve of daily rate that had already
been established for Vienna at about noon appears with few exceptions at
all other stations. St. Petersburg and Winnipeg, like Vienna, show in
suminer more sunshine in the morning than in the afternoon, and the
reverse in winter; all stations have moresunshine in the afternoon than
morning throughout the year; this peeuliarity Pernter attributes tothe
difference between continental and marine climates.

By making use of Schott’s tables of sunrise and sunset on account
of their accuracy, Pernter computes the percentage of the observed to
the greatest possible duration of sunshine. In general the annual to-
tals and the annual percentages diminish with the inerease of latitude;
the annual averages are 61 per cent. for Bola, 46 for Toronto, 37 for
Magdeburg, 47 for Winnipeg, 42 for Vienna, 41 for Sydney, 71 for Alla-

eS =
METEOROLOGY. 327

habad, 39 for St. Petersburg, 27 for Stonyhurst. In general there is a
larger per cent. of sunshine in summer than in winter, or the short
winter days have more cloudiness than the long summer days; but
Allahabad shows the opposite, since there the months of longest days
are the rainy months, and the highest percentages of sunshine occur in
December and October. (Z. O. G. M., X1x, p. 326.)

MOVEMENT OF AIR, CONSIDERING THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH
AND THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS.

235. Dr. Woeikof has calculated for fifty stations in Siberia and Rus-
sia the diurnal period in the velocity of the wind, and shows its inti-
mate connection with the diurnal change of temperature and the uprising
currents as explained by Képpen. Where the surface-heating is slight
the diurnal amplitude is slight. (Natwre, xxvu1, p. 571.)

236. The United States National Academy of Sciences has published
a report of its expedition to Caroline Island, in the Seuth Pacific, for
the observation of the solar eclipse of May 6, 1883. The meteorological
results obtained by Prof. W. Upton give, among other things, a new
value of the atmospherie ‘‘ constant of absorption of solar heat” and an
approximate determination of the heat reflected from our atmosphere
during totality; also a determination of the diurnal period in the force
of the wind deduced from hourty records of the velocity of the sailing
vessel as determined by the ship’s log. During an interval of about ten
days the vessel sailed in a uniform trade-wind without a single change
in the trimming of the sails. Upton’s results show a greater velocity
of wind by night than by day.

237. [This exceptional result, if no flaw be discovered in the method,
may possibly be explained (1) as due to the fact that the height of the
center of wind-pressure against the sail is about 40 feet above the sea,
and (2) by the assumption that above this elevation the wind has its
normal velocity at night, but a less velocity by day, owing to the upris-
ing of slowly-moving heated currents from the surface of the sea; in
other words, the diurnal periodicity of the wind, which over the land is
observed up to a height of many hundred and sometimes of several
thousand feet, is over the sea felt up to the height of only a few hun-
dred feet. Above that level its velocity is uniform; immediately below
it the velocity is least in the middle of the day, while at the surface of
the sea the velocity is greatest in the middle of the day. The Espy-
K6ppen theory has not yet been developed far enough to enable us to
state the relation between temperature of earth or sea surface, and the
height of the plane of no diurnal wind-period, but it is evident that the
height over the sea may really be as small as Upton’s observations in-
dicate. This result explains also the peculiarities of the diurnal land
and sea breezes at sea-shore stations when the general winds are from
land or water.|

328 SCIENTIFIC: RECORD FOR- 1884.

238. H. E. Hamberg, of Stockholm, has published a third memoir on
the diurnal variation of the torce of the wind. The author endeavors to
show that the amplitude between the daily maximum and minimum of
wind velocity is greater for strong winds than for feeble ones. As to
the questions whether the amplitude of the wind is best expressed by
the difference between the maximum and minimum or by the ratio be-
tween them, Hamberg is of the opinion that the ratio should be pre-
ferred, but Hann remarks that the question can only be decided after
considering the object of the investigation. After discussing this ques-
tion, which is again fully replied to by Hann, Hamberg communicates
the results of a large collection of data elucidating the diurnai changes
for all classes of winds and for numerous stations in Europe; he then
passes especially to the daily period for Upsala in the winter time, show-
ing that the amplitude increases with the strength of the wind, and
that the influence of cloudiness is but slight. (2. O. G. M., x1x, p. 303.)

239. EK. Stelling discusses the wind direction in the lower portion of
the rivers Obi and Jenissei. He shows that the southeast, south, and
southwest winds of North and West Siberia do not belong to any North
Atlantic cyclonic system, but belong to the anti-cyclonic winds attend-
ing the high barometer of Northern Asia. (Z. O. G. M., xix, p. 417.)

240. Prof. H. Fritz shows that the whisper wind, which is a local cur-
rent at the entrance of the narrow valley of the Rhine, blowing down
the upper portion of this valley in the evening and early mornings of
warm, clear days, is simply a part of the general current of air in the
valley of the river, and not to be attributed to any special influence of
the Wisperthal which is popularly and romantically associated with the
wind. (Z. O. G. M., xIx, p. 246.)

241. J. M. Pernter, in a second contribution on the winds at high
altitudes, shows that on the summit of the Obir the southeast and south
winds are most frequent, and therefore the upper trade or return
trade has no existence there. For both frequency and total movement
there is a double maximum and minimum. The diurnal wind-changes
follow the sun, namely, they veer with the sun during the day time, but
during the night time * back” or return against the sun. The north
and northwest winds are the strongest, the south and southwest the
softest. By selecting fifty-one perfectly clear days the daily period
becomes still more pronounced, confirming the author in his supposi-
tion that the sun’s heat is the principal cause of the diurnal change of
wind force. (Z. O. G. M., X1x, p. 380.)

242. R. Billwiller, of Zurich, has published a preliminary discussion of
the results of the anemometer records for August, 1883, with the Munro
anemograph on the summit of the Santis. He fears that the instru-
ment will not work satisfactorily in the winter, owing to the frost and
ice that accumulate during the prevailing moist west winds, and has
attempted therefore to make a comparison during the favorable weather
with the records of the observatory at Berne, which is situated in an
METEOROLOGY. 329

open, free space, and fairly represents the wind of the northern base of
the Alps. In general he finds for Berne the southwest and north to
be the most frequent winds, while for Santis they are the southwest
and west. The total movement of the wind is, for Berne 2,500, but
for the Sintis 22,000 kilometers during the month. The strongest winds
for Berne are southwest, north, and northeast, but for the Sintis
southwest and west. The altitudes forthe two stations are, for Berne,
570 meters ; for the Sintis anemometer, 2,508 meters, the anemometer
cups being 4 meters above the summit of the mountain. ‘The diurnal ve-
locity of the wind is very great at Berne, having a maximum velocity
of 10.0 kilometers per hour between 1 and 2 P. M., and a minimum of 0.1
between 4 and 5 A. M., but for the Siintis sammit we have a maximum
38.1 between 3-and 4 A. M., and a minimum 28.2 between 8 and 10 A.
M., and again between 2 and 3p.mM. (Z. 0. G. M., xvi, p. 416.)

243. The first year of observations on the summit of the Siintis (alti-
tude 2,467 meters) are published by Hann, from which we see that the
greatest wind velocity occurred at 9 P. M. on the average of the year,
the mean value being 1.60 of the scale on the Wild tablet anemometer,
the maximum being 2:2 in March and the minimum 1.2 in June; the
average lowest wind force was 4.10 at 1 P. M., the highest being 2.1 in
November and the minimum being 0.8 in June. (Z. O. G. M., XvIU, p.
479.)

244. Stevenson has from some observations at heights less than 200
feet endeavored to obtain the rate of increase of the wind with the alti-
tude. He finds that the following formule represent his observations :

Fee h
For wind velocity ? =f +r. wind pressure —
y]

where the small letters refer to the lower station and the large letters
to the higher; the velocities are expressed in miles per hour, the press-
ures in pounds per square foot, and the altitudes in feet. By means of
these formule it should become possible for meteorologists to reduce all
observed wind velocities and pressures to a uniform standard altitude.
245. [It would seem that one of the most important steps to be taken
in the near future, in order to render the study of daily weather maps a
more precise scientific matter, consists in the correction of anemometer
readings for instrumental and local peculiarities and their reduction to
a uniform altitude above the surface of the ground ; similarly the tem-
perature and moisture observations so far as they relate to the moving
mass of air should be reduced toa uniform elevation; as regards rain-
fall the correction for local and instrumental peculiarities seems almost
hopeless, but isnone the less desirable ; the reduction to a uniform alti-
_ tude, however, is a much simpler matter.| (ZO. G. ML, xvi, p. 319.)
246. KE. D. Archibald, of London, has undertaken an investigation into
the velocity of the wind as affected by the altitude above ground, and
has extended Mr. Stevenson’s experiments (which terminated with a
Sane: SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

height of 50 feet), by means of kites extending up to 1,500 or 2,000. For

a
the formula a given by Stevenson, which should not be used
Vi

above 100 feet, Mr. Archibald suggests the following: x =i Je
h

which is one of Stevenson’s first formule. This holds good up to 23,000
feet if we may rely upon the observations of Vettin, and does not vary
very much from the formula given by Ferrel, viz:
0.00275, -A2
P =1x0.003665t P/™
(Nature, XXVII, pp. 243-507.)

247. Mr. Thomas Stevenson, of Edinburgh, replies to Mr. Archibald’s
remarks and maintains that his own second formula is abundantly suf-
ficient to represent the observed increase of wind velocity. (Nature,
XXVII, p. 432.)

248. A. Buchan communicates the results of the Challenger observa-
tions as to the diurnal velocity of the wind on the open sea near the
shore and on land. These results are also incorporated in his article on
Meteorology in the Encyclopedia Britannica. (Nature, Xxvu, p. 413.)

249. Mr. I. D. Archibald differs from Buchan in the latter’s explana-
tion of the diurnal variation in the variation of the wind, and affirms his
adherence to the views of Espy and Képpen. (Nature, xxvu, p. 461.)

250. W. Koppen criticises some passages in Hann’s Climatology rela-
tive to land and sea breezes, and his remarks suggest the importance of
a few additional observations in favorable localities; thus he says the
origin of the sea breeze is not primarily due to the increase of pressure
in the upper part of a warming column of air. Since the sea breeze be-
gins over the sea and subsequently stretches to the land and up into
the bays and inlets, this must be attributed to the resistance of the land
retarding the breeze which is felt at a little distance out over the sea and
is first overcome when the pressure increases to a certain limit.

K6ppen thinks that since the sum total of the upper and lower circu-
lation is certainly stronger by day than by night, and as the land breeze
is feebler than the sea breeze, it is not necessary to conclude that a land
wind is blowing strongly at some altitude above the earth’s surface.
He calls attention to the fact that although the sea breeze is generally
intensified when the prevailing wind direction agrees with it, yet, on
the other hand, observation does not confirm the idea that the land
wind is increased when the prevailing winds agree withit. This rever-
sion of the preceding law is an apparently natural one, and is, per-
haps, generally supposed to be true, but, as Képpen remarks, actual
observations do not confirm it, and we evidently still need a correct
explanation of the mechanism of the sea breeze. (Z. O. G. M., XIX, p. 39.)

251. [Is not this explanation suggested by the above note on the re-
sults of Professor Upton’s study of a ship’s velocity in the South Pacifie
Ocean, i. e., the level of uniform maximum velocity is much lower over

e
METEOROLOGY. ai

the sea than over the land, owing to the feeble uprising current, as it
is also lower over the slightly heated lands of high latitudes and over
the land during the night as compared with the day time. |

252. Dr. A. Sprung, of Hamburg, in reference to the daily period in
the direction of the wind which has for centuries been recognized, says
that the theory of vertical ascending currents or topsy turvey move-
ments would lead us to the following conclusions which are fully ex-
planatory of this periodicity :

1. In the northern hemisphere, on the low plains and on high plains,
the wind has a tendency to change its direction with the hands of a
watch in the morning and against the hands in the afternoon.

2. In the northern hemisphere on the summits of mountains a simi-
lar oscillation in the direction of the wind will occur, but in the oppo-
site direction. .

3. In the southern hemisphere the oscillation at low stations will be
against the hands of a watch in the morning and with them in the
afternoon, or opposed to the rule for the low lands, and agreeing with
the rule for the mountain summits in the northern hemisphere.

4. In the southern hemisphere for mountain summits the oscillation
is opposite to that of the low lands of that hemisphere.

5. At the equator the wind direction is not affected.

6. On the ocean, where the daily period in the strength of the wind
is slight in consequence both of the slight vertical diminution of fric-
tion and of the slight warming of the ocean surface, this oscillation in
direction is also not sensible.

So far as observations are at hand the above conclusions seem to be
confirmed, and so strong is the deflection due to uprising currents thus
theoretically explained that the diurnal change of wind at most north-
ern stations consequent on the eastward movement of storm-centers
whose paths lie north of the station is almost entirely annulled by it
in the afternoon, whereas in the morning the two forces combine to ex-
aggerate the phenomenon. (D. WM. Z., 1, pp. 15-65.)

253. Dr. A. Sprung gives an elementary geometrical derivation, which
is more complete than that given by Zéppritz and Butf, of the deflection
due to the earth’s rotation. (D. dM. Z., 1, p. 250.)

254. Wm. M. Davis, of Harvard College, gives an elementary proof
of the deflection, due to the earth’s rotation, of bodies moving par-
allel to its surface, showing the three general principles upon which,
he says, Professor Ferrel bases his formula for this deflecting force; this
is reproduced by Hann with afew notes from Van Nostrand’s Engineer-
ing Magazine. (Z. O. G. M., XvIIlI, p. 299.)

255. Dr. J+’. Roth, of Buxtehude, comments upon Professor Davis’ pre-
sentation of the subject to the effect that it does not make clear the
point under dispute between bimself and Dr. Sprung; he, however,
recognizes that Professor Davis’s method of demonstration virtually
assumes that the earth is a sphere, and that the true or apparent force
aby pa SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR igs4,

of gravity is perpendicular to the surface of a sphere. He prefers him-
self, however, to consider the earth as a spheroid formed by the rotation
of a fluid mass, and to assume that the direction of the plumb line is
always towards the center of the spheroid; this he thinks corresponds
better to the practical taste of the American, and is about the same as
Professor Ferrel has adopted. He then shows that of the three coim-

ponents into which Professor Davis analyzes the deviating force of the -

earth’s rotation, only the first actually exists. (Z. O. G. M., XVIII, p.
376.)

256. H. Bruns, of Leipsic, in reference to the movement of the atmos-
phere over the earth’s surface, states that Roth and other authors have
generally assumed the earth’s surface as perfectly smooth; he, therefore,
gives the formule required when we introduce the consideration of
friction, and shows that assuming the earth to be a surface of rotation
the friction will not affect the azimuthal deviation known as Ferrel’s
law. (Z. O. G. M., XVIII, p. 425.)

257. F. Roth, under date of October, 1883, communicates a note on
the deviations of motions of the earth’s surface, in which he shows that
the angle that determines the direction of motion as affected by the
earth’s rotation varies only with the time and is entirely independent
of the kind of frictional resistance; it is the same for any force that acts
in the direction of the path, and holds good for locomotives, steamships,
moving animals, &e. If the frictional resistance is in direct proportion
to the velocity, but in other respects the moving body is impelled by its
own inertia, then the orbit is a spiral turning with the sun and can be
expressed by the following equation:

aé
° Fw sin —
We therefore arrive at a remarkable confirmation of the assumption
with which Guldberg and Mohn commence their investigations. -(Z. 0.
Gre KI p40.)

258. I’. Roth, in reference to his development of the path of moving
bodies on the earth’s surface, controverts the position taken by Professor
Bruns to the effect that theoretical and mathematical investigations
have but little practical interest for the progress of meteorology unless
every detail is considered instead of the approximate solutions frequently
given; the fact, however, is that Bruns’ effort to introduce the consid-
eration of friction can scarcely be called very successful, as he certainly
has made no greater progress than did Finger in his memoir of 1877.
However, Roth finds in Bruns’ work a confirmation of the correctness
of his own previous assumption, namely, that the eaith is a sphere to
whose surface the observed force of gravity is perpendicular. Taking
complete account of the side forces introduced by frictional resistance,
Roth shows that it is not immaterial in which direction a body moves
on the earth’s surface, but that the deviating force is for a motion to-
wards the east greater than one towards the west. He gives also the

r=F
METEOROLOGY. 833

formula for the change .n the velocity due to friction, in which respect
he agrees with Professor Bruns. As has been before stated, the orbit
of a free particle moving on a horizontal plane under the influence of
the earth’s rotation and its own friction (assumed to be directly propor-
tional to the velocity) will be a logarithmie spiral. If, however, the fric-
tion depends upon the square of the velocity, then the differential curve
is easily given, but the integrated equation involves a series of sines and
cosines. (Z. O. G. M., XIx, p. 523.)

259. Prof. L. de Marchi, of Rome, has published in the Annals of the
Rome Meteorological Office an investigation into the mathematical
theory of the winds, in reference to which Dr. M. Margueles gives a
review with criticisms. Marchi aims to show that the quantity which
in hydrodynamics has been known as Wirbeigeschwindigkeit has.an
important meaning in the mathematical theory of the winds. If we in-
dicate this quantity by ¢, then the total rotation of any partiele of air
is equal to ¢ plus the rotation of the earth, and the total rotation is
always positive or against the rotation of the sun; the lines of equal
total rotation are also curves of equal density; that any condition in
which the quantity ¢ is zero cannot long exist over a large surface. If
we assume that the total rotation of a particle of air is constant for its
whole orbit, whieh Marchi thinks rendered probable by actual observa-
tions, but which Dr. Margueles thinks wholly arbitrary, then it follows
that the density is greater where ¢ is greater. If a region where ¢ is
zero divides two regions of positive and negative values of £, then the
density of the air will increase towards the positive and diminish
towards the negative ¢; he thus explains the distribution of pressure in
cyclones and anti-cyclones, and for the special case that the orbits of
the particles of air are logarithmic spirals the total rotation is con-
stant throughout the whole horizontal movement. Assuming the Mohn
aud Guldberg relation between density and temperature, Marchi finds
that when in the center of a cyclone ¢ is negative, this is then a warm
center, but when € is positive it is a cold center, provided that in both
cases the curve of £=0 completely incloses the center. After going
into many details in relation to individual simple cyclones, the author
remarks that by drawing lines for equal values of ¢, especially ¢=0,
we can easily study the ordinary complicated combinations of the daily
weather map. He lays it down as a general rule that two lines of
equal values of ¢ can never intersect each other, and that a line of
uniform £ must either be completely inclosed or must extend to the
very limits of the fluid; he proves that if the line is closed, then the
dilatation due to the motion will be greater on the north side than on
the south side, thus explaining the tendency of cyclones to move towards
the pole and of anti-cyelones towards the center in a different manuer
from that given by Ferrel. (Z. O. G. Mf., XIX, p. 278.)

260. In explanation of the above assumption to which Dr. Margueles
objects, Professor Marchi states that he did not enunciate this as a
334 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

general proposition, but distinctly as a special hypothesis appropriate
to a number of practical examples, and that in general such restricted
hypothetical cases must first be solved before we can, in the present
state of our knowledge, proceed to the general solutions which are now
impossible. (Z. O. G. M., X1x, p. 480.)

261. Prof. A. Oberbeck, commenting upon the memoir of Marchi,
states that his own investigations have led him +o a different conclu-
sion. In the first place the expression Wirbelgeschwindigkeit (which
is not used by Helmholtz) is not properly apphed to the movements
represented by Marchi by the letter ¢; in the second place the conclu-
sion that € cannot be zero for any Jength of time over a large space is
incorrect; in general the formula for the motion of the air as given by
Guldberg and Mohn is at present the best for comparison with the
observations; and if the latest researches of hydrodynamics are to be
considered, this can best be done by the formule given by Oberbeck in
Wiedemann’s Annalen for 1882. (Z. O. G. M., x1x, p. 489.)

262. Miller-Hauenfels in his Theoretical Meteorology endeavors to de-
duce philosophically from fundamental principles of mechanics and
physics all the principal phenomena of the atmosphere. He first shows
that the density of the atmosphere from the poles towards the equator ~
diminishes more rapidly than has heretofore been supposed. Since the
unequal warming of the strata of air disturbs the equilibrium it becomes
the office of the winds to endeavor to restore this normal density. By
studying the isosteres, or lines of equal density of the air, he finds sim-
plified laws for the wind movement, based on the principle of continuity.

The trade-winds girdling the earth can send no equatorial currents
toward the pole, but constitute a circulation of their own on both sides
of the equator. The author shows considerable dexterity in unraveling
the complicated phenomena, and his work is worthy the study of mathe-
matical and physical meteorologists. (Z. O. G. M., xvi, p. 483.)

263. Dr. Vettin, of Berlin, according to Képpen, more than 25 years
ago published in volume 102 of Poggendorf’s Annalen the results of his
experiments on movements in the atmosphere. These experiments,
together with his equally long-continued observations upon the clouds,
form an invaluable contribution to our knowledge of aerodynamies,
affording, as they do, abundant opportunity for testing mathematical
theories. A number of these experiments are described by Vettin in
the Journal of the German Meteorological Society, and will, it is hoped,
lead to the complete publication of his work, as he seems to be able to
reproduce nearly all the phenomena of storms. (D. I. Z.,1, p. 227.)

264. Prof. Osborne Reynolds has communicated to the Royal Society
of London an experimental investigation into the motion of water, which,
from its comprehensiveness, constitutes an important contribution to
our knowledge of hydrodynamics; the innumerable ingenious experi-
ments, the empirical formule and curves, and the comparison with de-
ductive or theoretical formule mark an advance in our knowledge that
METEOROLOGY. 335

will find many applications in the atmospheric movements. (Nature,
XXMT, p. 627.)

265. An anonymous article in Nature expresses some views on the
upper currents of the atmosphere, and suggests certain lines of research
inte some of the more striking optical phenomena. [So far as the dy.
namic problems are concerned there seems a little confusion as to the
cause.| (Nature, XXIx, p. 154.)

266. Dr. H. Hertz, of Kiel, presents an elaborate and important conven-
ient graphic method for determining the changes in the adiabatic condi-
tion of moist air. [The translation of this in full will, it is hoped, be pub-
lished for the benefit of American students.] The author states that
the condition of moist air, after being compressed or expanded without
addition of heat, has to be considered daily by the meteorologist; he
desires therefore to offer to the student the means of solving the various
questions without recourse to complicated formule. At present it is cus-
tomary to use the little table published by Professor Hann in 1874, but
he thinks that we can achieve more complete solutions with equal ease
by employing the graphic methods and the engraved table of curved
lines that he has prepared. He proposes nothing especially new in ad-

‘dition to the publications of Hann, Guldberg, and Mohn, but accom-
plishes the equally important result of making their formule easily
available in daily use. (D. WM. Z., 1, p. £21.)

VIII.—BAROMETRIC PRESSURE AND ITS VARIATIONS.

267. A. M. Pearson, of Bombay, compares the barometric changes of
monthly means at Zanzibar, Belgaum, and Bombay for three years, and
shows there are evidences of the movement of barometric waves east-
ward through these stations, the time of transit being 4.9 months from
Zanzibar to Bombay, with numerous smaller coincident deflections. He
very }:roperly claims that the atmosphere must have vibrations and
. waves originating in various ways, of which these barometric phenomena
_are the results. Similar studies, by J. Allan Broun, have lately been
published by the Manchester Philosophical Society. (Nature, xxvu1,
pp. 354-377.)

268. In a note of September 4, 1883, Mr. Pearson affirms that the at-
mospheric waves have been traced regularly since 1869; and that the
reason why they have a movement in tropical and sub-tropical regions
westward more rapid than eastward is owing to their combination with

the westward movement of the air in those latitudes, but as to the reason
_ why the amplitude is greater at eastward stations he advances the hy-
pothesis that the westward component proceeds from the tropics, where
all great movements originate. (Nature, XXxvIit, p. 562.)

269. A. Schomrock, of St. Petersburg, has compared the occurrence of
small, sudden, irregular variations of atmospherie¢ pressure as recorded
on the barographs at St. Petersburg and Pavlosk. These have an an-
nual periodicity, being most frequent in November, December, July, and
336 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

January, and somewhat less so in June and February. Sometimes they
continue only for a few hours, occasionally even only one occurs, but
frequently they follow each other in an uninterrupted series for many
days. Occasionally they attain an amplitude of many millimeters; they
occur both with rising and falling pressure, both during a maximum and
minimum, but most frequently during the latter, and least frequently
during the maximum. They have an undeniable connection with pre-
cipitation, so that whenever they occur there is, in most cases, simultane-
ously either rain, snow, or fog, or the formation of clouds, but inversely
they are not an invariable accompaniment of such phenomena; they do
not appear to depend on the direction or strength of the wind. They
have a most interesting and undeniable connection with thunder-storms,
being, with very few exceptions, invariably to be observed, so that one
may determine the time and duration of a thunder-storm by these irregu-
larities of pressure. In order to ascertain how general or local these
perturbations are, Schénrock compares the records at Pavlosk and
St. Petersburg and finds that they occur together at both places, but
the character of the records made by the Wild barograph, namely, one
record every ten minutes, conceals very many of the details and renders
the comparison very unsatisfactory. (Z. O. @. M., XIX, p. 396.)

270. [Schénrock has here initiated a study which must have long.
claimed especial interest on the part of every one who has had access
to the records of a self-registering barometer. Of the barographs at
present in existence, one of the most sensitive instruments and one well
adapted to this class of investigations is that invented and constructed
by Hough and established at Albany, at the Dudley Observatory, the
hourly readings of which have been quite fully published and discussed
by him. <A duplicate of this instrument was set-up at the Army Signal
Office in Washington in 1871, and still continues to perform satisfactorily.
Several others have been constructed introducing modifications of
Hough’s construction, so that abundant opportunity has been offered
during the past fifteen years for studying, on a continuous and yery
perspicuous register, the oceurrence of these irregular and rather mys-
terious changes of pressure. We have been accustomed to consider that
these may be produced by either one or all of tie following causes:

1. Sudden gusts of wind blowing across chimney tops produce dratts
and lower pressures, or blowing into the window of an otherwise closed
room produce slight increase of pressures within the room where the
barometer is placed.

2. The downfall of rain, cooling and dragging with it air, pushes
out from the region of rainfall as a gust of wind; this gust, as it pushes
against surrounding resisting masses of air, is compressed, whence a
temporary increase of pressure results in the locality preceding the
advancing rainfall, precisely as has been explained by Espy, Henry,
Koppen, and others.

3. Every ascending mass of air must be accompanied by the descent
METEOROLOGY oan

of other masses, and these latter may so descend bodily and rapidly to
the earth as by their inertia to experience a slight compression on reach-
ing the earth’s surface. This is perhaps best seen during the clear or
partly cloudy weather that accompanies our west winds. These winds
blow in gusts, the velocity at any one station alternating between 0 and
5 to J5 miles per hour. An observer standing ‘on an open free space
may generally easily recognize the fact that when such a gust is’ blow-
ing dust and Jeaves violently towards him, there is alittle way beyond a
simultaneous wind blowing dust in the opposite direction, and by care-
ful cireumspection he will assure himself that a downrush of air over a
well-defined circular region is being followed by its being pushed out in
all directions, thereby constituting the gust as observed by him. This
downrush of air may plausibly be supposed to be due to the fact that
at a short distance above a quantity of colder or drier and denser air
was ready to come down whenever the hot air below came to a state of
unstable equilibrium. The stoppage of any such downrush gives rise
to a temporary compression and increase of pressure which usually lasts
for short spaces of time, a half minute or more, but when great cumulus
clouds pass by this may continue for five minutes. ]

271. An interesting example of such barometric changes is given by
the Vienna Meteorological Institute as occurring on the 18th of Octo-
ber, 1884. The Kreil barograph (continuous register) shows that from
noon of the 17th to 7.25 A. M. of the 18th pressure fell steadily, then re-
mained ‘constant for five minutes, and at 7.30 A. M., entirely unan-
nounced, jumped up 2.5™", and continued ascending steadily until noon.
The Theorell barograph (recording every fifteen minutes) shows an in-
crease of 2.7™™ between 7.30 and 7.45 A.M. The Hipp barograph (regis-
tering every ten minutes) shows a similar jump between 7.20 and 7.40
A.M. The following were the attending meteorological phenomena:
A heavy northwest storm prevailed during the night of the 17th and
18th, diminishing somewhat in the morning; at 7.30 A. M. the wind sud-
denly sprang up from the north, it grew dark, and a heavy rain shower
from the north occurred, the total rainfall being 16™™, of which 6.3"
fell in the first ten minutes; after this shift in direction the force of the
wind diminished, the temperature sank, and the storm died away.

As this sudden barometric change corresponds to a sudden increase
of pressure to the amount of 36 kilograms on the human body it is a
subject that may interest physicians as well as meteorologists. (Z. 0.
G@. M, xix, p. 236.)

272. E. Renou, of Paris, has published an exhaustive and most careful
study of the records of barometric pressure at Paris. These records
begin in 1689, but only in 1809 does the instrumental temperature begin
to be given, and only since1834 is the series commensurable in accuracy
with those of the present day. Assuming that the average pressure
has remained the same, he corrects the older series of observations,

and, among other conclusions, he shows that for Paris we cannot safely
assume that the mean pressure in winter must be higher than in sum-
mer, aS many years show the opposite condition. (Z. O. G. I1., x1x,
p. 541.)

273. Mr. H. F. Blanford and Mr. Hill have published contributions to
the daily periodicity of the barometric pressure in India, The obser-
vations at Goalpara, Patna, Leh, and Allahabad have been especially
studied by them. In general it may be noted that the daily change of
pressure is in the valleys of the warm zone characterized by an early
occurrence of the morning maximum. The daily amplitude is 0:0048
of the mean daily pressure, or about 0.140f aninch. (Z. 0. G. M., xvu,
p. 258.)

274. Prof. H. Mohn has published the volume containing the results
of the Norwegian North Atlantic expeditions, 1876 to 1878, in which he
contributes the first observations that we have of the daily periodicity
of meteorological phenomena in this important region of the North Sea.
With regard to the pressure, we havea scarcely perceptible minimum
between 8 and 9 P. M., a principal minimum at 4 A. M., and a principal
maximum at 2 P.M. Combining this with the results of the Challenger
expedition it seems likely that there is no evening minimum under nor-
mal conditions in this region ; so that on the open sea in high latitudes
in both North and South Atlantic only one minimum and one maximum
appears in the diurnal curve of pressure. (Z. O. G. M., XVIII, p. 470.)

275. J. M. Pernter contributes to the subject of daily and annual
variations of pressure on mountains and in valleys a short study of
some observations in Austria, Switzerland, and on Mount Ararat. He
finds the following results for mountain peaks:

1. The curve of daily change is flatter for the elevated stations, the
morning minimum diminishes, while the afternoon minimum grows flat- .
ter, but without disappearing, as it is still very prominent upon Mount
Ararat; up to a moderate height the daily amplitude diminishes, but
then begins again to increase.

2. The evening maximum, that is quite small in low, flat lands, in-
creases with the altitude until it finally becomes the principal maximum
of the day. This has been known in a few instances, and ascribed to
special local circumstances, but is now recognized as a general law of
much import.

3. The periodicity during the day is not the same for summer and
winter seasons: thus for a low peak in summer the mid-day maximum
comes later than in winter, and this delay is greater in proportion to
the altitude, amounting to two hours at the highest station.

With reference to valley stations, he finds a dearth of material in the
higher Alpine valleys, but comes to the following coclusions :

4, The daily amplitudes are remarkably large.

5. The afternoon minimum is remarkably deep.
METEOROLOGY. 339

6. The time of afternoon minimum varies from 3 P. M. in winter to 5
Pp. M. in summer.

7. The morning minimum disappears or is very flat.

8. The morning maximum occurs very early—on the average at 8 A.
M.; and the evening maximum, which is more pronounced than in open
localities, is much delayei—even until 1 A. M.

With reference to the cause of the differences in- diurnal periodicity
between valley and:mountain stations, he remarks only that the princi-
pal cause, as long since recognized, is the expansion and contraction
with temperature of the stratum of air below the mount&in, but that,
besides this, dynamic causes contribute especially to the formation of
the evening maximum. A further investigation will be given by him
when he has secured two full years of all the observations at high and
low stations. (Z. O. G. Al., XVIt1., p. 290.)

276. [Many studies have contributed to show how slight is the diurnal
change of temperature of the great mass of air, and we may therefore
doubt whether«the expansion and coutraction corresponding to this
slight diurnal temperature change suffice as a static explanation of the
diurnal barometric differences at the top and bottom of a high mount-
ain. Weare rather inclined to think this a minor factor in the expla-
nation, of the phenomena to be studied by Pernter, and that he will
find that some kinetic law covers the whole ground. The broadest
basis fur this explanation has been given in the investigations by Ferrel
and others, and I have for many years taught that the phenomena, after
allowing for a small static influence, are reducible to three dynamic
causes: one general for the whole earth’s surface; a second, special for
the latitude and the continent; a third, and least important, special for
the locality, its altitude and its immediate surroundings, including the
exposure of the barometer to the influence of winds. ]}

277. André, of Paris, has studied the diurnal variation of the barom-
eter at different altitudes above the sea, and confirmed the results re-
cently announced by Hann, Pernter, and others. He also concludes the
existence of a third maximum in the winter months, occurring about
2.30 P.M. (Z. O. G. Mf., XIX, p. 143.)

278. Dr. R. Maurer publishes in full the results of hourly barometric
observations for one year—April, 1883, to March, 1884—on the summit
of the Siintis and the Great St. Bernard, and compares these with ob-
servations made at other high stations in the Alps. The mean gradient
between the two stations is as follows: For the spring, 0.10; for the
summer, 0.22; autumn, 0.69; winter, 1.10 millimeters. These figures
give a new demonstration of Hann’s conclusion, that only in winter in
‘extra-tropical latitudes can great general gradients occur in the higher
atmospheric strata,-while in summer, with a much more uniform distri-
bution of temperature, warmth, and moisture, the gradient is slighter.
2.40. G4, M., x1x, p. 513:)

279. Prof. B. Busin, of Rome, suggests that we may derive advantage
840 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

from studying a system of lines similar to isobars and constructed in
the following manner: If from the center of the earth radii are drawn
through the ordinary elliptical isobars we have a system of cones, which
can be so cut by a plane that the sections shall be concentric circles ; if
then we project this system upon the earth’s surface, we have a system
of circles to which may be directly applied the mechanical principles
deduced by Ferrel, Colding, and others. He suggests it as his own
belief that the physical reason why we should recur to such a system
of central projection consists in the fact that the axes of the cyclones
are ordinarily inclined to the earth’s surface, as he has in fact satisfied
himself by the study of the cyclones that pass over Sicily. (2%. 0. G. M.,
XIX, p. 404.)

280. Prof. Elias Loomis, in his nineteenth contribution to meteorology,
(American Journal of Science for December, 1883), discusses the baro-
metric gradient in great storms, and shows that the effect of friction
is greater than as assumed by Ferrel in his formula. (Nature, XX1x, p.
252:)

281. In his twentieth contribution (American Journal for July, 1884),
Professor Loom is especially discusses the reduction of barometric¢ obser-
vations to sea level; he concludes that the pressure coefficient in the
hypsometric formula of Laplace is too small. :

282. [As this conclusion is based on the assumption that the tempera-
ture of a mass of air below the mountain top is correctly given by tak-
ing the mean of the temperatures as ordinarily observed near the ground
at top and bottom, which assumption is quite erroncous for the clear
nights and days that prevail during high pressures, but more nearly
correct for the cloudy weather and high winds that prevail during low
pressures and storms, it would seem that systematic errors are hereby
introduced that must affect his conclusions |

IX.—(a) GENERAL STORMS; (b) LOCAL STORMS; (c) GENERAL WEA-
THER RELAIONS.

283. Dr. W. Képpen has published charts of the frequency and mean
paths of barometric minima between the Rocky Mountains and the Ural.
’ His charts are based upon the recent work of European meteorologists,
especially Hoffmeyer and Hageman, and upon the work of the Signal
Office during 1873 to 1879, especially its international bulletin. [His
frequency charts are similar to_ those compiled in 1874 by Abbe, and ~
published by the United States Census Office, and those of Finley re-
cently published by the Signal Office, while his charts of mean storm
tracks are similar to those compiled by Lieutenant Jackson vnder the
special orders of General Myer, in 1875.] | Képpen has, however, greatly —
improved upon previous publications of this kind, not only in more
eareful collation of data, but especially in that for the first time he
brought American and European storms together in sufficient number
to show the geucral relations between them, He finds that the moye-
METEOROLOGY. $41

tnents and changes of depressions of storm centers on the ocean are
much more irregular than over the North American continent. The
main storm track passes from Wisconsin eastward to Newfoundland,
thence northeast to the North Cape; outside of this track, areas of
great storm frequency are found in Davis Straits and Northern Ger-
many. (24. 0. G. M., XVII, p. 257.)

284. Dr. J. van Bebber has presented an admirable discussion of the
relative position, velocity, and intensity of the barometric minima of
‘Europe that have occurred during the years 1576 to 1880, inclusive.
His statistics are presented in the shape of charts showing by curved
lines the regions of equal mean velocity ; equal maxima of barometric
depressions ; equal average barometric depression, and equal average
barometric departure of the pressures at storm-centers from the nor-
mal pressure. He finds that the mean velocity of progress of a storm-
center is greater in the United States than in Europe, it being 100
myriameters per day in the United States and only 64 myriameters in
Europe. For both countries, however, the annual periodicity is about
the same, showing a minimum in August and a maximum during the
winter, which, as he says, is an important indication of the fact that
some general causes regulate the movement of storm-centers through-
out the world. The velocity of the most rapid storms exceeds 150
myriameters in thirty cases during the five years; the greatest number
of cases of any one velocity is that of 40 to 50 myriameters, for which
there were 217 cases. (Z. O. G. M., XVII, p. -97.)

285. Leyst has made a study of the storm tracks in European Russia
and Western Siberia for the years 1878~’80. He considers only the
storms of such a nature as those for which storm signals should issue
from the central office at St. Petersburg. Out of 250 cyclones there fall
in summer 17 per cent., autumn 29, winter 30, and spring 24 per cent.
The mean pressure of the central minima is for summer 738 mi!limeters,
for October 752, and for November to March 727. The mean velocity
‘increases as the storms move eastward, and in the summer time the cen-
tral depression also increases. The velocity of progression is also great-
est in January and least in July. The strongest gradients are for sta-
tions south and southwest of the centers, and the strongest winds
themselves are directed towares the southwest in January, February,
and June, but to the northwest in March and to the east-northeast
in April. When the cyclone comes into such a position that Russia
is in its southwest part, it has already moved further away from the
high pressure of Southwest Europe, and also has grown weaker by its
passage towards the north or northeast, and for both these reasons the
storm in the southwestern quadrant of the cyclone diminishes. (D. J.
Z., 1, 326.)

286. M. Modller,in some remarks on the cause of the movement of
barometric depressions, says these depressions are columns of air of less
weight than the surrounding masses of atmosphere; the movement of
$49 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR isa.

the depressions results partly from renewed formation, partly trom pro-
gression; both methods of movement can act in conjunction or in oppo- x
sition. In reference to the movement of progressionit can be analyzed
into three causes: influence of the distribution of atmospheric pressure;
influence of the mean distribution of temperature; influence of the
earth’s rotation.. The first influence is treated of by Dr. Képpen (Z. O.
G. M., February, 1880), who shows that the presence of a maximum
pressure increases the lower winds and thereby increases the rapidity
of movement of the depression. But Méiler has also shown that the
upper winds carry the depressions with them, so that the progressive
movement of a depression is to be considered as a consequence of the
movement of a thin layer of warm air and of the movement of a space
of rarefied air due to the vis-viva of the forces in action. The third
cause of movement, namely, the rotation of the earth, in all latitudes,
causes a movement from east to west and also towards the nearest
terrestrial pole. In this way he explains the western movements in the
torrid zone, where he says this effect of the earth’s rotation is at a
maximum, while the other causes become efficacious in the middle and
higher latitudes. [M6ller’s poleward tendency seems to be the same as
that first pointed out by Ferrel in 1857, but to which we believe the lat-
ter now attaches less importance. The poleward tendency for the lower
winds is balanced by the equatorial tendency due to the higher winds.]
As regards the second cause, namely, the distributionof temperature
on the earth, this is principally controlled by the sun’s heat; and intro-
ducing the algebraic expression for this he shows that the combined
influence of heat and rotation is to produce a motion towards the west
within 30° of the equator, but toward the east, in more northern lati-
tudes, up toa certain limit in the polar circle. The rather complicated
formula given by him can be put in tabular form in such a way as to be
conveniently used in a strictly scientific estimation of the most proba.
ble path that will be pursued by any depression.

287. {It is important that Méller’s formule be applied to the study
of the storms of the United States for the purpose of telling more ex-
actly the value of the considerations that he has given. It cannot be
doubted but that other more important physical laws, such as the con-
densation of moisture, the heating of {he upper layer of clouds, the
relation of Continents, oceans, mountain ranges, plateaus, and lowlands
have also so large an influence that the questions of inertia and temper-
ature of the moving atmosphere have only a partial if not in fact a
subsidiary interest.] (Z. O. @. AL, Xrx, p. 274.)

288. R. H. Scott has discussed the question of the reality of the ex-
istence of so-called equinoctial storms in the British Islands. To this
end he has examined statistics since April, 1870. It is evident from the
tables he gives that they simply confirm the results of studies by Dove,
Loomis, aud others, namely, that no one day of the year is especially
storiny, although the maximum number of storms in England increases

systematically from 0 in June and July up to 31 or 32 in December and
January. (Z. O. G. M., x1x, p. 393.)

289. Prof. M. Dechevrens has published a monograph on the typhoons
of July and August, 1882, wherein he traces the history of the whole
course of several typhoons along the coast of Asia. (Nature, Xxx, p.
388.)

290. W.Ko6ppen, inreference to the change with altitude of the position
of the center or axis of lowest pressure, sums up his conclusions as fol-
lows: The center is at high altitudes pushed towards that side which is
colder; therefore, in general, towards the left and backwards; on account
of the rapid diminution of temperature towards the east in winter in
Europe the exterior isobars of the depression extend especially toward
the east, therefore more or less forwards, so that if the position of a cen-
ter were in general determined by these isobars a shoving towards the
front would apparently exist. The ordinary expression ‘axis of the
whirl is inclined forwards or backwards,” which is also used by Clem-
ent Ley, leads to misunderstanding. A simple mathematical axis for
the whole whirl never exists in our great cyclones; these must stand
perpendicularly on the plane of rotation, and in fact many authors in
early and recent times, in speaking of the inclination of the axis of the
whirl, have assumed a corresponding inclination of the plane of rota-
tion. In truth, however, in the case of a cyclone we are dealing with a
superposition of very thin nearly horizontal disks whose vertical axes
of rotation do not coincide, but each of which is shoved a little toward
the colder side as compared with the one lying immediately below.
(D. M. Z., I, p. 168.)

291. Dr. C. Lang, of Munich, contributes a long review of Ferrari’s
study of thunder-storms in Italy. The observation of thunder-storms
has been conducted in Italy since 1876 in very much the same manner
as it has been for a long time in I'rance and Scandinavia. IT errari’s
monograph is divided into two sections: First, the observations; sec-
ond, climatological study; third, a dynamic study. The greatest fre-
quency of thunder-storms per square myriameter is in Upper and Cen-
tral Italy, whence it diminishes rapidly towards the south, being most
frequent in a band nearer the east coast of the peninsula; the region
of least frequency is the whole west coast. This geographical distribu-
tion, however, may be somewhat affected by the geographical distribu-
tion of observers, which are also fewest on the west coast, and for whose
distribution Ferrari has made an approximate correction. The month
of greatest frequency is July for Northern Italy, but the epoch is de-
layed as we proceed southward until it becomes August and September
for southern stations. The annual frequency of hail shows no strongly
marked features; the neighborhood of the Po has a slight immunity,
and the frequency increases northward, but again diminishes close to
the foot-hills of the Alps. The frequency of ordinary thunder-storms
is as usual greatest between noon and 6 p. m., which quarter of the day
La: SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

has a relative number 40, while from 6 p. m. to midnight the number is
32. More than two-thirds of the thunder-storms come from the west
and depart toward the east. The wind prevailing during the storm is
most frequently from between west and north. In general rain accom-
panies thunder-storms, and this is more intense in the hilly regions than
in the plains. The monthly frequency of hail is nearly the same as the
annual frequeucy of thunder-storms. The second portion of Ferrari’s
work, or the study of the mechanism of a thunder-storm, is the larger
and more important. He gives here detailed studies of those storms
that occurred between April 30 and September 17, and for each of
which he has at least a hundred observations ; charts are published in
full of ninety-five storms occurring on twenty-eight days. The charts
Show the hourly isochromes for the beginning and end of each storm.
Ferrari has drawn these lines after smoothing away individual differ-
ences; a process that may, however, hide from notice some important
phenomena. The cold air that accompanies or immediately succeeds a
thunder-storm is by Ferrari explained as due to a rapid descent of the
air from the higher regions, but this is opposed by Dr. Lang, who
thinks it is rather due to the cooling of the air by precipitation, espe-
cially hail. The intensity of the thunder and lightning is, after allow-
ing for local influences, more considerable in extended typical thunder-
storms than in those of small dimensions, and increases as the annual
curve of temperature rises. Ierrari finds that distant heat lightning
does not exist except in connection with thunder-storms there present.

292. [It was Professor Henry who first showed that in such cases the
thunder from distant storms might in its progress downwards towards
the observer suffer total reflection, and thus be carried over him above
his head.] The shapes of the thunder-storms are generally long bands.
In general Ferrari’s conclusions are in agreement with those quite in-
dependently evolved a little later by von Bezold from his studies in
Bavaria. (Z. O. G. M., x1x, p. 353.)

293. Prof E. Landolt, from an elaborate study of the severe hail and
thunder storms of the 2Lst of July, 1881, arrives at the following con-
clusions: (1) In very heavy thunder-storms the clouds are only a hun-
dred meters above the earth, and the hail-stones form in the lowest strata
of air; (2), the topography of the earth has a great influence upon the
distribution of the storms; (3), the directions of the strongest currents
of air dependent upon the thunder-storm follow the axis of the storm,
and sometimes precede it, and the air flows from both sides toward the
storm-center; (4), forests, especially when they crown the hilltops, mod-
erate the extent and severity of the hail; (5), the hailfall can be very
severe even on high regions that extend near to the thunder-cloud.
(2. ONG. XVil, p..254.)

294. Prof. W. von Bezold, of Munich, gives an account of the methods
pursued by him for inves‘igating thunder-storms in Bavaria and Wur-
temburg. The ordinary postal card is converted into a form for the
METEOROLOGY. 345

record of the storms—the blank spaces can be rapidly filled out, suggest-
ing, as they do, to the most inexperienced observer, the items that Be-
zold desires. The reports received during 1882 amount to over 5,000,
and come from over 300 stations. These reports are studied by entering
upon achart for each station the time at which the first thunder was
heard and arrows showing the direction from which the storm came
and toward which it moved. Lines are then drawn called isobrontons,
or lines of simultaneous appearance of thunder; these are drawn for the
full hours, and give a beautiful picture of the progress of the thunder-
storm. This procedure differs from that which is customary in France,
Norway, &c., where the attempt is made to picture the progress of the
center of the storm by taking the mean moment between the first and
last thunder. Bezold prefers to draw isobrontons for the last thunder-
claps as well as for the first so far as this is possible, but generally
finds it difficult to get reliable reports of this last phenomenon. He has
also, for the years 1881 and 1882, taken special care to reduce his baro-
metric observationsand to draw isobars of great accuracy,as a means of
studying the relation ofa thunder-storm thereto. [is conclusions may
be summarized as follows:

(1.) Thunder-storms that do not accompany heavy hurricanes origin-
ate when there arise in quiet air notable local differences of tempera-
ture and pressure. The isobars drawn for every 5 millimeters show only
distortions, but by drawing them more minutely, say for every millime-
ter, they show definite centers. These small depressions appear mostly
only as partial or auxiliary depressions in a great area of low pressure.
The progression of the thunder-storm in general takes place without
reference to the winds immediately attending these small depressions,
but in accordance with winds that evidently prevail in the higher regions
in connection with the great barometric depression. Especially intense
are the thunder-storms that occur in a ridge of high pressure separating
two great depressions.

(2.) If we draw a line inclosing the regions at which in a given instant
the first and last thunders are being heard we inclose a space over
which electric discharges are then going on. This is the area of the
thunder-storm proper, and, in most cases, this region has the form of a
narrow band perpendicular to the direction in which the thunder-storm
ismoving ; therefore, in general, the storms move with a very broad front
and very shallow depth. Cases are at hand wheve with a front of 300
kilometers we have a breadth of only 40.

295. [This peculiarity was long since remarked by the present writer,
who in 1873 called attention to the fact that numerous thunder-storms
and even tornadoes frequently occur nearly simultaneously on what ap-
pears to be the advancing edge of a broad area of cool or dry and there-
fore dense air; it is therefore not proper to say that the thunder-storm
cools the air, but rather that the thunder storm marks the progress of
the advancing cool air, which by uplifting the moist air in front of it is

ra

producing cloud and rain; it is the downfall of rain which, acting like
the water-dropper of Sir William Thomson, discharges the electricity
from uprising masses of moist alr and cloud, and produces those diffe:
ences of electric potential that give rise to lightning and thunder. |

(3.) There are definite regions that are especially favorable to the form-
atiov of thunder-storms, suchas for instance the swampy lowlands be-
tween the larger lakes and the Alps; so also the west slope of the Bo-
hemian forests very often gives rise to thunder-storms.

(4.) In those cases where the formation of a thunder-storm entirely
within the area of observation can be clearly proven, the remarkable
phenomena is noticed that over long distances the electric discharges
begin simultaneously, so far as this can be determined with ordinary
clocks; we are thus forced to the idea that the disturbance of electric
equilibrium due to the first stroke of lightning is immediately commu-

nicated by induction from cloud to cloud, and thus provokes a simul-
See outbreak at various places.

(5.) The observations of heat lightning or distant silent lightning are
interesting as showing the extraordinarily great distances to which this
can be observed; thus on August 26, 1880, lightning was observed in
the horizon at stations in Saxe-Meiningen that belonged to a thunder-
storm then prevailing 240 kilometers distant near Ulm; and on Decem-
ber 9, 1852, lightning was observed in the south that seems to have
lon eca to storms 270 kilometers distant.

296. |Observations similar to these have doubtless been made by
many others, and the present writer, after having satisfied himself that
with Washington as a center lightning was frequently observed oc-
curring near Norfolk and central Pennsylvania, proposed in 1872 to
map out the course of all such storms by means of observations of
azimuth and time to be made at all the regular Signal-Service stations ;
special directions were then given to signal-service observers to rec-
ord carefully these phenomena in the journal kept at each station. The
result proved that the observed azimuths were not generally recorded
with sufficient accuracy; an apparatus to obviate this difficulty was
designed but not introduced ; the lines of equal thunder-storm frequeney
in the monthly weather review for July, 1874, were largely based upon
the study of such records. |

(6.) The diurnal periodicity of the distribution of thunder-storms

shows that besides the maximum between 2 and 5 P. M., there is also a

secondary maximum between 2and34a.M. (Z. 0. G. Ml., xVul, p. 200.)

297. Von Bezold returns again to this subject in August, 1883, and
dwells especially on the circumstance, that with the outbreak of a thun-
der-storm there often occurs a decided fall of temperature and sudden
rise of pressure. As he looks upon the crowding together of isobars as
the cause of a thunder-storm he enforced the following sentences:

On the front side of the band of simultaneous electric discharges,
which band is perpendicular to the direction of progress and thereiore
METEOROLOGY. — $17

a little in front of the region of the thunder-storm, there exist peculiar
temperature and pressure relations, namely, the pressure as we approach
the storm from the front suddenly rises and the temperature falls.

The front edge of the storm sharply separates an area of high press-
ure from one of low, and equally separates an area of low temperature
from one of high.

By considering the wind directions at the moment of the outbreak
of a thunder-storm we find that on the front edge, in general, the winds
are perpendicular to the isobars, if the latter ran north and south, or
that the wind blows direct from the high pressure to the low pressure,
constituting a departure from the law of Buys-Ballot. .

The existence of this sharply-defined passage from high tu low pres-
sure and from high to low temperature is so uniform that it is sufficient
to study these isobars and isotherms in order to ascertain where the
front of the thunder-storm is at any moment. (Z. O. G. M., XVIN, p.
281.)

298. [For most of the thunder-storms that the present writer has
examined or observed personally in this country and Europe he is con-
vinced that the explanation of the outflowing cool wind immediately in
front of the storm was correctly given by Espy at least as early as 1338.
This wind is by him and Professor Henry explained as almost wholly
due to the air dragged down by the falling rain and also cooled and
rendered heavier, which, striking the ground, must be pushed out. But
as the storm is undoubtedly advancing, either with the front edge of
an extensive area of denser air, or else is being carried along within a
great current of air, it follows, in either case, that the wind due to the
down-rush of rain willkcompound with the wind due to the general motion
of the atmosphere; we therefore generally find strong outward-going
winds on one side of a thunder-storm and light outward winds or calms'
on the other side of the rain. Ferrel shows that no great barometer
fall can be caused by these straight-out winds; there must be a rota-
tion to produce a depression; on the contrary, air pushed down against
the earth and outwards may cause a slight temporary rise of pressure,
so that gusts and a sudden barometrical rise occur simultaneously. |

299. Dr. W. Képpen has given an exhaustive study of the destructive
thunder-storm of August 9, 1831. The chart accompanying his essay
shows that at 2 Pp. M.alow barometer was central jast south of Norway
and east of Denmark, while in the southeast quadrant from this, from
Denmark to Bavaria, numerous thunder-storms occurred. The study of
these storms seem to him to afford a striking example by which to test
the conclusions of his previous investigation, well known as * Contribu-
tions to our Knowledge of Boéen and Thunder-Storms,” to which the
present study forms a second memoir. After a minute description of
the phenomena, follows a comparison and discussion on the causes and
explanation of the thunder-storm from which Hann makes the tollowing

summary, bearing especially upon the Béen or wind-gusts that accom-
pany the thunder-storm.

Throughout its entire course the B6en was associated with the exist-
ence of an extraordinary well-developed change in pressure and temper-
ature. This temperature distribution, as shown by closely compressed
isotherms, corresponded toa very steep barometric gradient which aver-
aged 9 millimeters at the place of most compressed isotherms. The
object of the following is to explain how this extreme condition could
originate. In the region which was later in the day to be visited by the
Boen, there was already on the 8th of August a feeble southerly cur-
rent and strong insolation with a temperature high above that pre-
vailing to the westward, and which in Leipsic rose to 29.7 C., by noon of
the 9th. This high temperature relative to the surroundings must have
given rise to the formation of a low pressure at the base of the warm
column of air. But that the isotherms should be so closely crowded is
due to the fact thaton the border of the warm and cold air, rainfall was
caused by the uplifting of the former, which materially cooled this
region and thereby propagated the phenomena toward the direction of
the warm mass of air. With the heavyrain that thus originated air must
have been dragged down mechanically with the drops and also must
have sunk down in consequence of its lower temperature and greater
density. The dynamic warming of this air could only be slight because
of its mixture with water, and the downfalling cold air must have exerted
a strong uplifting effect upon the warm air below and adjoining it, and
thus the phenomena continually increased in severity. Thus, precisely
on the limit of the warm region the production of cold was mostintense;
in fact we see the greatest crowding of isotherms there where the pre-
cipitation is heaviest in the Béen, and where it partly fell in the form
of hail. The difference of temperature between Neustadt and Segeberg
at 2 P. M. was 26°.1—14°.6 or 11°.5 C., for only 39 kilometers distance.
K6éppen attributes the retardation of the lower stronger gradients to
friction at the surface of the ground, thereby causing the steepness of
the change of pressure. The effect of this steep gradient is felt almost
entirely in the acceleration given to the outflowing mass of air, because
its movement is nearly in the direction of this gradient. [The gradient
represents a constant force pushing outwards like gravity pulling down-
wards] The slight value of the angle between the gradient and the
wind is ascribed partly to the acceleration, partly tothe circumstance
that the air drawn into the Béen already has a motion nearly in the di-
rection of the gradient. This distribution of pressure by reason of the
great horizontal temperature gradient must change very rapidly with
the altitude, and Dr. Képpen computes that, at an altitude from 600 to
700 meters, the irregularities in the isobars have disappeared and they
have become simple ellipses inclosing the principal depression. At the
_ place where the warm air is lifted up in front of the Boen thick masses
of clouds must form, which move with the general air-current. towards

east and northeast and cause heavy rainfall. The Boden is thus pre-
sented as a whirl around a horizontal axis. Koppen states that, since

his first memoir in 1879, a slight change in his views has taken place, in
that although he retains the important feature of the descent of cool
air driven down by its density and falling rain-drops, yet he does not
give so great an importance to this falling air as he did before.

In general, on the southeast side of any barometric depression, inso-
lation causes a very warm region and at the same time, within a few
hundred meters of the earth’s surface, a subsidiary depression, although
in the atmosphere immediately above this the isobars retain their ellip-
tical form. ‘The eastern portion of this region is thus withdrawn from
the influence of the cooling current on the west side, and as a feeble
southeast current increases in temperature. The western part, on
the other hand, is early overflowed by the cool air from the west,
which, by reason of the progressive movement of the principal depres-
sion, always comes from a more northerly point. By the pushing up
of the warmer air rain is caused on this limit of the warm and cool
region. By this, lower temperatures are caused close to the limit of high
temperatures, and a temperature gradient produced which, following
both the general current of air and the perpetually renewed precipita-
tion on the temporary edge of the warm region, moves toward the side
of the higher temperature. By this temperature gradient combined with
the conditions of motion a pressure gradient is produced in the lower
600 meters of air which propagates itself in the same direction. This
pressure gradient (favcred by the fact that the remaining or horizontal
distribution of pressure both above and below causes a current that
flows approximately with that due to the steep gradient) causes an ex-
traordinarily strong wind along the whole breadth of tbe region during
its passage over, which usually lasts about twenty minutes. This stormy
portion of the current is about two-thirds due to the air dragged by the
downfalling mass of rain, while in front of it the air is ascending.
Special places in this stormy region, which generally crosses the south-
west current almost perpendicularly, are distinguished by special inten-
sity of the storm, and other portions by a formation of hail. There thus
originate regions of hail storm and of destruction, as evidences of the
passage of the storm, and whose greatest diameters are approximately
perpendicular to the greatest temporary extension of the Béen. So
long as the thunder-storm moves against the sun it is subject to the
influence of a daily period, since it originates in the morning, is best
developed wherever it may be at the warmest time of day, and then
with the beginning of the night rapidly diminishes in strength and soon
disappears. (Z. O. G. M., XIx, p. 12.)

300. [If we properly appreciate the points made by Dr. Képpen in
his beautiful study, we should say that that which is thoroughly novel
is the bringing out so clearly the fact that when once the development
of the thunder cloud has reached the point of decided rainfall, and with

attending downward currents of air, the process from that time on may
become a self-supporting one, each feature continually. increasing in in-
tensity until a maximum is reached, dependent on temperature, moist-
ure, and config uration of the earth’s surface, when it attains a condi-
tion of equilibrium, and so continues until nightfall. Képpen’s study
applies equally to every form of thunder-storm, tornado, and wind-
squall. The views developed by him in this essay are accompanied by
such a mass of exact data as to make it an invaluable. contribution to
our knowledge of a subject that was however already largely eluci-
dated by Espy, Fourth Meteorological Report, pp. 106, 164, 165, and
Prof. Joseph Henry, Lectures on Meteorology, Agricultural Reports, 1854
to 1859. In fact, we think it would not be an injustice to call the above
the Képpen-Espy theory of thunder-storms and squalls.]

301. ©. Ferrari writes in reference to Lancaster, K6éppen, and von
Bezold, who maintain that thunder-storms are caused by the small special
barometric depressions, that he himself in his previous publications had
really long before defended the same conclusions, and that he was the
first from a complete investigation to demonstrate by obser vation the
truth of these views. (Z. O. G. l., XVIII, p. 426.)

302. Dr. G. Hellmann, in reply f Ferrari’s reclamation, states that
many have published their views on the connection between the thun-

der-storms and atmospheric pressure; thus the fact that the barometer -

suddenly rises at the outbreak of a thunder-storm and subsequently
falls was, as far as he knows, first recorded by J. J. Planer, in 1782.
Rosenthal, and especially Lichtenberg, in 1784, gave a very clear de-
scription of the whole process. Equally clear and apparently independ-
ent of each other are Gronau (1821), Strehlke (1830), and Kiimtz (1836).
(ZOn GaN, XTX). 44>)

803. M. Moller discusses the suggestion thrown out by von Bezold to
the effect that the winds in thunder-storms and Boden agree with the
direction of the gradients, and do not correspond with the law of Buys-
Ballot. This latter law, Moller states, affirms that, as a result of the
acceleration due to the gradients, and under the influence of constant
friction and by reason of the deflecting force of the earth’s rotation,
there will for equal latitudes resuit also equal deviations of the wind
from the direction of the gradients. It has many times been shown how
this deflection must decrease if the air passes from strong to feeble
gradients. On the other hand, the reverse has not been stated, namely,
that a length of time to be counted by many hours is necessary to com-
municate to a mass of air a motion deviating from the direction of the
gradients, provided the air was originally at rest or did not possess such
deviation. By a little computation Moller shows that for short distances
and steep gradients, such as occur near a thunder-storm, the air—im-
pelled by the difference of barometic pressure, and having both a for-
ward velocity and a deviation due to the earth’s rotation—although it
obeys them both, yet appears to obey only the first of these forces, be-

METEOROLOGY. 351

cause that is over forty times larger than the second. (Z. 0. G. M., xix,
p. 80.) ;

304. M. Moller, in his investigation on the temperature and move-
ment of the air in a Béen, states that in 1880 he first recorded the sug-
gestion that the shadows of the clouds caused strong winds, which,
acting like gusts, are called Béen, and which accompany the streaks of
rain from cumulus clouds. This explanation, however, seemed unsatis-
factory, because such wind-gusts occur also at night time, when, of
course, there are no shadows. The true explanation has, he thinks,
been given by Képpen, namely, that the falling rain carries with it air
from above, which on reaching the ground spreads out and increases
_the strength of the prevailing wind. Combining his own and Koéppen’s
ideas, he develops carefully the structure and growth of a thunder-storm,
and succeeds in explaining very satisfactorily the mode of formation of
hail and the low-lying scud in advance of the main cloud, and which
the observer generally easily recognizes as rising up to feed the advanc-
ing edge of the cloud. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 230.)

305. [Views similar, and in most respects identical with K6ppen’s and
MOller’s, have during the last twenty years been frequently verbally
communicated both by Prof. Joseph Henry and the present writer to
fellow-Students of meteorology. They date at least as far back as 1838,
when Espy was in the full tide of his studies of thunder-storms in
Pennsylvania, a region where storms are developed to their fullest extent.

Our hearty appreciation of the views of Képpen and Moller is en-
hanced by their own kindly mention of that most genial of American
enthusiasts. |

306. C. G. Finemann, of Upsala, in a study upon the “ trombe,” or tor-
nado, of June 7, 1882, draws the foliowing conclusions:

1. The formation of a tornado is characterized by the simultaneous
occurrence of great relative and absolute moisture, high temperature,
almost perfect calm.

2. Tornadoes and thunder-storms originate under almost identical
atmospheric conditions.

3, The two phenomena can occur together or separately.

4, Finiey’s work seems to suggest that either phenomenon may de-
velop trom the other.

5. The tornado here studied certainly consisted in a strong ascend-
ing current of air, revolving also in a direction opposed to that of the
hands of a watch lying face upwards on the ground.

6. The ascending current formed an inverted cone out of the mate-
rial carried up with it, which moved forwards towards the northeast.

7. The tornado was fed by moist air, which flowed over the earth’s
surface with increasing velocity.

8. The moister the air by so much more did the interior velocity of
the tornado increase. :

9. The air was precipitated into the tornado from below, like cold air
352 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

drawn into the fire of a burning forest; at some distance this draft was
noticeable by the lowering of the lower portion of the clouds.

10. Subsidiary whirls formed under favorable circumstances. (Z. O.
G.M., x¥X, p. 262.)

307. William M. Davis, of Cambridge, writing to Dr. K6ppen in refer-
ence to the simoom [German, Samum], the latter replies by quoting the
following as the characteristics of the simoom as experienced in the
Indian deserts by Dr. Henry Cook :

Its beginning is sudden; occasionally a cold current of air precedes
it; it occurs ordinarily in the hot months, June and July; it occurs in
the night as well as by day; its path is straight and definite; its pas-
sage leaves a narrow trail behind; it burns and kills the animals and
vegetables in its path; it is accompanied by a very noticeable smell of
sulphur; it is described as like the current of air from a furnace, and
certainly the temperature of the air within it is very high; it is not
~ accompanied by either dust or thunder and lightning.

K6éppen shows that, assuming the rise of temperature in the simoom
to be 16° C., then, if the air has been thus heated by the compression
of a descending current, it must have descended about 4,000 meters ;
but he thinks it not at all plain why the air should descend to the
earth’s surface. There is not a perfect parallelism between the simoom
and ordinary Béen, nor an antithesis between Béen and thunder-
storms. (D. MM. Z., 1, p. 245.)

308. A. Klossowskij has discussed the observations of thunder-storms
made in Russia by the observers of the Geographical Association since
1871. This series of reports was inaugurated at the instance of A.
Woeikof, who also published the results for the first year (1871). The
present volume gives a complete summary of the work since that time.

309. J. Ludevig presents the results of the observations of thunder-
storms made during 1882-33, at the Government telegraph stations in
Germany. The maximum number of storms occurred in May, 1882, but
this was apparently abnormal; the normal maximum appears in July,
1882, and again in July, 1883. The maximum number of days on which
thunder-storms occurred was 28 in June, 1832, and 30 in June, 1833,
The storms came most frequently from the southwest and next fre-
quently from the west; the hours during which most storms occur is
from 3 to4 Pp. M., and the minimum frequency of storms from 12 to 3
Am. (2.0. Gs Mi, xIxs p.429.)

310. Dr. P. Andries, in a memoir on formation of thunder storms and
hail, after a review of the older literature on the subject, adopts me-
chanical theories very similar to those of Ferrel in his Meteorological
Researches, part 2. With regard to the formation of a potential suf-
ficient to produce lightning, he adopts the view that this is explained
by the combination in one of numerous small diops of water; as to the
origin of electricity on these small particles, he attributes that to friction
METEOROLOGY. 553

and induction. (Annalen der Hydrographie und maritimen Meteorologie,
1884, p. 65.)

311. Prof. James Thomson, of the University of Glasgow, read before
the Montreal meeting of the Brit. Assoc., a paper on whirlwinds and water-
spouts, in which he adheres to the old view that the diminution of press-
ure observed at the center of a hurricane is the cause of the movement
of the wind, anid queries whether it may not be possible for the low
pressure to be abated through the combined influence of rarefaction by
heat and the whirling motion. He also thinks that in great whirlwinds
the whirling motion may be propagated upwards to the top of the at-
mosphere. He suggests that the dark clouds, and in tornadoes the pen-
dent spout, may be due to the precipitation of moisture on account of
abatement of pressure due to centrifugal force and ascension above the
sea level. [Prof. James Thomson’s publications on this subject date
from 1852, and especially 1857, but while his writings are always worthy
of attention, it would seem that these particular points have already
been clearly explained by other students of meteorology.] (Nature,
XXX, p. 648.)

312. Prof. W. von Bezold, of Munich, has studied the question of the
cold daysinMay. He finds that whenever high pressure prevails in the
west and lower pressure in the east, and especially in southeastern
Europe, a cold period occurs, and that this distribution of pressure is
particularly liable to oceir in May. If this characteristic distribution
fails, then the cold days also fail; the explanation of the coid days is
therefore dependent upon the explanation of the occurrence of this distri-
bution of pressure. After studying the isobars of Europe, he concludes
that when in spring the warming ofthe northern hemisphere begins at
the south and oceans and continents interchange their relations with
reference to pressure and temperature, then the Balkan peninsula, to-
gether with the land between the Adriatic and Black Sea, plays the
part of a small continent. It is therefore warmed up with reference to
the surrounding region, experiences a low barometric pressure, and es-
pecially favors the development of storm-centers. These, therefore, cause
the cool northerly winds and the cold days of Germany. (Z. 0. G. M.
XVIII, p. 268.)

318. Dr. Képpen, in reference to the cold days in May, states that
neither the explanations of Midler, Erman, Sainte Claire- Deville, Ass-
mann, von Bezold, nor others seem to him to afford any satisfactory ex-
planation of the question why the precise days from the 10th to the 13th
should have such a decided tendency to be abnormally cold. (Z. 0. G.
a. SEX, p. 133.)

314, KR. Billwiller states that he has been surprised that van Bebber,
in his essay on the cold days in May, has so strongly stated that these
always happened on definite dates, whereas Dove had so clearly proved
that they are not simultaneous in different localities, nor do they hap-
pen on a definite date at any one locality, whence Dove considers that

354 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1s84.

any cosmic cause is out of the question. Now that this conclusion has
been confirmed by von Bezold by his demonstration of their purely terres-
trial cause, and that they occur pretty uniformly distributed through a
long interval of time, it seems strange that KOppen should state that the
inain point of the question has not yet been touched, and should again
suggest cosmic explanations. Billwiller’s opinion is that there are no
facts on record from which we can philosophically conclude that there
are three definite cold days in May or that there is any problem here
to be investigated. [In other words, this problem is to the German
what the problem of the equinoctial storm is to the American. What-
ever storm happens to occur within a week or two of the 21st of March
or September is called the “equinoctial storm,” and we frequently find
some one at work on the problem, “Why are storms especially apt to
occur on the equinoctial day?”] (Z. O. G. M., xIx, p. 245.)

315. Dr: W. Képpen, in reply to Billwiller’s remarks, states decidedly.
that he is not a believer in the three cold days of May, nor in their
explanation by cosmic causes. The essence of the problem seems to him
to lie in the following questions:

1. Is there really present that relative maximum tendency to cold
days which, according. to many, especially the older observations and

according to the investigations of von Bezold, apparently exists during ©

we asia pentade of May ?
. If this is the case, how shall the fate be exactly determined ?

te en if the first question should be denied, it would still remain of
interest to show why the tendency to a south and a southeast gradient—
that is, to a northeast wind—should be so decided in May, and should
also not exist in June, where the excess of temperature of the continents
above the sea remains the same while north and northeast gradients
prevail. He shows that this may be due to the heating of distant lands,
and remarks that also the studies of Dr. Krankenhagen on the baro-
metric phenomena attending the cold period in June combine to show
that in severely judging the belief in the definite character of special
days we may lave gone too far.

316. Buys-Ballot writes expressing his entire agreement with Pro-
fessor Billwiller. He states that every month has its cold days, and May
least of all, and suggests a method of investigation which he is about
carrying on. Ina parenthesis he exclaims, “ Shame, that in America
climatology is so entirely lost sight of!” (Z. 0. G. M., x1x, p. 320.)

317. G. Hellmann, in a study of the annual change of temperature in
Northern Germany, utilizes the averages by pentades for thirty-five
years; he finds a decided retrogression or cold period about the middle
of June for Breslau. The cold days of May vary so much as to their
dates that they do not show in the averages of thirty-five years, while
the cold days of June are well marked. Another retrogression, but in
this case warm days, occur in the last week of September. (2. 0. G. M.,
XIX, p. 384.)

318. Dr. Krankenhagen, of Stettin, has investigated the distribution
of temperature and pressure in Europe in June, and has shown that
the pentade, June 1 to 14, is peculiarly liable to a slight fall of tem-
perature, while on the other hand the isobars of June require such
winds as must produce this temperature fall. In general the areas of
low pressure that pass over Europe have a tendency to take a direction
toward the northeast, east, or southeast, and are therefore followed by
cold winds. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 11.)

319. Dr. Krankenhagen also contributes to the question of three cold
days in May astudy based on the consideration that such may be caused
by especially cold, clear nights; he therefore calculates how many days
have been above the meai, and how many below; the mean negative
departure we may call X, and positive departure Y; then the quotient
X + Y shows how many more times the mean negative departure is
greater than the positive. This ratio is 1.16 for the third pentade of May.
CDM. Z., 1, p: 371.)

320. Dr. J. van Bebber, of the Hamburg Seewarte, publishes the re-
sults of a study into typical weather phenomena in anticipation of a
mare exhaustive publication by the Seewarte. This isa continuation of
his studies upon the geographical! distribution, the paths and velocities
of barometric minima; his object now being to ascertain in what man-
ner these depressions influence the condition of the weather, especially
in Germany, and whether it is not possible from any given condition of
the weather to deduce practical rules for predicting the movement of
the depressions and the fature weather. He first determines the prin-
cipal paths followed by the majority of the storm centers, leaving to a
future time the study of the erratic minima. The tabular view of the
frequency with which storms traversed these principal paths shows a
decided tendency of minima to follow in groups along any path once
inaugurated by a leading storm. He aiso shows that the mean velocity
of minima moving along the paths is always much greater than the
general mean velocity of all minima indiscriminately. Therefore we
conclude that along these principal paths the conditions are most favor-
able for maintaining the intensity and rapid progress of minima. If
we consider the distribution of pressure for each of these paths sepa-
rately, we find characteristic relations ; thus, if a line be drawn from the
minimum to the maximum pressure, or from the minimum normal to the
closest isobars, we find the storm progress nearly perpendicular to this
line; in other words, the progress of the minimum agrees closely with
the direction of the strongest wind, thus agreeing entirely with the
principle announced in 1872 by Rev. Clement Ley, namely, ‘extensive
areas of very high pressure delay or turn aside the movement of a de-
pression, in that each depression moves with the greatest ease in a direc-
tion such that it shall have the highest pressure on the right-hand side
of its path.”

A relation is also apparent between the distribution of temperature
356 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1881.

and the progress of depressions so that the direction of the movement
forms an angle with the direction of the greatest rise of temperature,
which angle varies between 45 and 90 degrees, being greater in summer
than in winter, the highest temperature being on the right-hand side of
the storm path. This principle is also indicated by Clement Ley in the
following words: ‘The direction of progress of depressions in Western
Europe varies in Europe between north-northeast and south-southeast,
and is primarily dependent on the preceding general distribution of
temperature, so that the movement is inclined at an angle of 45 degrees
to the lower isotherms.” ‘These principles, announced 11 years ago in
England, have, says van Bebber, not found the proper consideration in
European weather predictions. After some explanatory words, he sums
them both up in the following: The progress of depressions takes place
approximately in the direction of the prevailing movement of the whole
mass of air in the neighborhood of a depression. This statement would
seem to support the assumption that the atmospheric whirl is carried
along by the prevailing current of air. |We are now giving van Beb-
ber’s statements nearly in his own words and reserve the privilege of
stating that, although the connection between the phenomena is very
nearly as he gives it, yet the rationale of the process is, we think, not
at allas he seems to suggest.] By reducing pressures upwards and
constructing isobars for an altitude of 2,500 meters and also for
higher altitudes, he is led to the conclusion that the whirlwind move-
ment is confined only to the lower strata of air, that the axis of the
whirl is inclined to the left and slightly towards the front, and that the
upper currents of air in the neighborhood of the whirl have nearly the
same direction, so that those belong to a great ring progressing with
the depression and in which the air that rises within the depression now
sinks again. This agrees with the fact that the movement of the cirrus
clouds agrees with that of the progress of the depression ; this also ex-
plains why the upper clouds, which also move with the depression, are
so prominent in advance, while on the left side of the path the cirrus
clouds are so infrequent; this also explains why the principal storm
paths marked out by van Bebber are especially followed in the colder
season of the year and why the storm paths, numbered 1 and 4 by him,
moving towards the northeast or east-northeast, occur most frequently
in the warm season. Equally easy is it to explain why a number of suc-
cessive storms have a tendency to follow the path pursued by some prom-
inent leading one, for if atmospheric pressure and temperature are so
distributed over a large part of the hemisphere as to be favorable to
the production of a given storm path, then it is clear that succeeding
depressions will follow the same path so long as the distribution of
temperature and pressure does not change, and as these changes can
only go on slowly it necessarily happens that storms and local weather
changes some times show great similarity for days and weeks together.

821. [It is certainly to be regretted that the intense study under most

favorable circumstances given continuously since 1870 to the tri-daily
weather maps of the United States and Canada should not long ago
have been supplemented by some general summary of the laws of storm
progress and weather changes with which the officers of the Signal
Service have become familiar. Guided by the writings of Redfield,
Espy, Henry, and Ferrel, the deductive branch of meteorology was
making rapid progress—greater than could possibly have been fol-
lowed by those outside of the office. It was already in 1872 a matter
of common note that storms and also areas of high pressure, &c., pur-
sue successively the same or very similar paths, each one showing a
progressive systematic difference from its predecessor, until by a sud-
den change in distant surrounding circumstances the whole system was
broken up and a new order of things inaugurated. These similarities
between storm paths were frequently pointed out, both in the daily
weather predictions and the Monthly Weather Review. An interest-
ing illustration of this will be found in the daily predictions of the
hurricanes of August 18 and 25, 1871, as made by the present writer for
the official weather “Synopsis and probabilities” of the Army Signal
Office.]

Van Bebber continues by saying that only in the rarest cases are press-
ure and temperature distributed around two storm-centers in the same
manner, and to this circumstance principally is it to be attributed that
the progress of and changes in the depressions show such extraordinary
variety. If the distribution of pressure and temperature is reversed,
then will the movement of the depression be hindered or entirely an-
nulled, and at the same time it itself takes a long irregular form [the
barometric trough of the Signal Service Bulletins], its longer axis per-
pendicular to the pressure gradients, and from its ends frequent small
minima break off that then follow the general current of air prevailing
in their region; if, however, on either side pressure or temperature pre-
vail, then the direction of the movement of the storm-center will be
thereby determined.

From this short explanation we see the great importance of these two
principles in their application to weather predictions. If, however, we
would form a correct prediction, we must extend our weather map to the
greatest possible extent, especially toward the west, and study expressly
the behavior of the great barometric maxima and minima that charac-
terize certain regions of the earth. We see also the importance of the
study of the cloud movements, especially the upper clouds. (Z. O. G.
M., XVIu, p. 447.)

322. Teisserenc de Bort having studied the general weather condi-
tions attending abnormal winters, further develops his generalizations
relative to the “principal centers of action of the atmosphere,” and
shows that the perturbations in the position and intensity of these at-
mospheric centers correspond with important changes in the character
of the weather. If, therefore. we y ould predict the weather for a long
358 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

time in advance we must determine the connection between the local
weather and the general circulation over a large part of the earth’s sur-
face as due to these centers. (Z. O. G. M., x1x, p. 105.)

323. [The centers of action, as he calls them, seem to be identical with
the large areas of maximum and minimum pressure first marked out by
the isobars of Buchan and generally known to meteorologists as conti-
nental and oceanic maxima and minima. Teisserne de Bort gives in
detail the types of weather peculiar to France for each location of the
surrounding maxima and minima areas, but the assumption running
through his essay to the effect that the changes of local weather are
directly due to the changes in the pleiobars and meiobars, as they were
called by Prestel, seems to us quite unwarranted. This matter is refer-
red to in a circular of the Signal Office, published in June, 1871, ‘* How
to use weather maps,” and was for several years carefully studied from
Teisserenc de Bort’s present point of view, but the present writer was
forced to the conclusion that some ulterior forces controlled both the
local weather and the permanent or subpermanent highs and lows, so
that although it is very convenient, for instance, to connect our Atlantic
coast weather with the Atlantic area of high pressure between latitudes
20 and 30 degrees, yet it is not possible to say that the latter is cause
and the other effect. |

324. H. H. Hildebrandsson has still further investigated the average
distribution of meteorological elements, wind, clouds, temperature, rain,
haze, or fog, with reference to the isobars ; he divides these latter into five
zones, namely, the low ¢enter, three intermediate bands, and the high
area. Each of these zones he divides into eight portions according as
the gradient therein is directed toward the north, northwest, &c. The
examination of six years of weather maps shows that for Upsala and
for southern and central Sweden the following generalizations hold
good:

1. The wind makes a greater angle with the gradient in summer than
in winter and within a minimum than within a maximum; greater at
sea than on land; greater for gradients directed towards the east and
least for those towards the west. The strength of the wind is greatest
for gradients directed towards the north and least for those towards the
west and southwest.

2. The lower clouds move in directions deviating to the right from
the direction of the wind at the earth’s surface; the lower clouds move
nearly perpendicular to the gradients er parallel to the tangents of the
isobars; for gradients towards the west the lower clouds are inclined
more than 90°; that is to say, the air is moving away from the area of
low pressure.

3. The cirrus clouds move from the minima out towards the maxima;
this movement is feeblest near the center of depression and most rapid
within the maximum zone; the movement is greater on the advancing
side of a depression, or on the western side of a maximum; directly be-

hind and above a low center the movement in the upper regions is for
Sweden ordinarily from north or west, but there are cases in which the
movement is from south or southeast, which latter is the ordinary case
in England, according to Clement Ley.

4. The temperature in the maxima and minima areas is above the
mean if the gradients incline towards the west, and below the mean if
inclined towards the east; in winter the temperature is above its mean
minimum and below in the maximum area; in summer this is reverseds
The temperature differences between upper and lower stations are great-
est when the gradient is directed towards the north or east, but least
towards the south or west.

5. The quantity of clouds or rain are greatest for gradients towards
the south or west and least towards the northeast.

6. The transparency of the air for distant objects is independent of
barometric pressure; greatest fog occurs with gradients towards the
west, but in the Kattegat the fog is most frequent for gradients towards
the north. (Z. O. G. M., x1x, p. 469.)

325. Prof. P. Busin, of Rome, has endeavored to indicate the various
positions that areas of high and low pressure must have relative to Italy
in order to produce any given type of weather; he computes a new kind
of wind rose for Rome, showing the probability of various types of
weather for numerous relative positions of the isobars; the number of
these types may amount to about 100. He concludes that the changes
in the barometer for intervals of more than eight hours, and equally so
the changes of temperature for twenty-four hours, are of little use for
weather predictions; he suggests that it will be probably of more use to
study the departures of the temperature and pressure for the normal
values of the day and the hour for which the weather map is drawn.
(Z. O. G. M., XIX, p. 235.)

326. [The actual pressures and temperatures and the departures have
each their special significance—both are used by the Signal Office, but
of the two the former has greater value in studying the mechanical laws
of atmospheric motions, }

327. Dr. J. van Bebber, of Hamburg, reviews the works of Hoflmeyer
aud Teisserenc de Bort, as well as Hildebrandsson, on types of weather,
aad their connection with general distribution of temperature and press-
ure. In conclusion he says: ‘If we glance back upon the progress
made in these [and his own equally extensive] works we must come to
the conclusion that the prevailing character of the weather on any day
in Germany is determined by the more general distribution of weather
conditions, and that we shall only understand the general weather
changes when we take into consideration the seasonal interchanging of
the general centers of action in the atmosphere. But within this region
[Europe] rapidly progressing changes are completed that can indeed
have no important influence on the prevailing weather of the larger
areas but that are of fundamental importance for the weather of small

regions. Often barometric minima, formed on the edge of the greater
centers of depression, glide in rapid succession along the edge of the
great barometric maxima, exerting upon the wind and weather of the
region through which they pass in broad circles an extraordinary influ-
ence, and give the weather the character of variability. As a contribu-
tion to this subject, see my investigation on Typical Phenomena, which
I wrote at the beginning of the year 1883 for the introduction to the
volume of Monthly Weather Reviews for 1882, and which will soon be
published in greater fullness in the Archiv of the Deutsche Seewarte-
In this investigation the effects of the depressions upon the weather are
referred back to the well-established main tracks of storms, and these
are brought into connection with the general atmospheric conditions.
These and similar studies give the first foundation for weather predic-
tion for a long period in advance. We are persuaded that the weather
predictions for such periods are not among the impossibilities, but that
hereafter they will at some time exceed in usefulness the daily predic-
tion.” (D. M. Z., 1, pp. 22-70.)

328. [Predictions three and four days in advance based on similar
considerations were made by the Signal Office in 1871 and 1872 on
occasions of importance.] 6.

329. The subject of atmospheric electricity and terrestrial earth cur-
rents was dealt with by the Electrical Congress held at Paris April,
1884, which recommended that the different countries should collect
reports and forward them annually to the International Bureau of Tel-
graph Administration at Berne, which bureau will digest and commn-
nicate a summary in return. It also recommended that observations
of earth currents be made in all countries.

330. The United States National Conference of Electricians, meeting
at Philadelphia in 1884, renewed these recommendations, commending
them most heartily to the action of our Government, and appointing a
committee to confer with the Chief Signal Officer, who is commissioned
to collect the data for the United States, and who has already for two
years been conducting preliminary observations on atmospheric elec-
tricity with a view to the addition of this item to the Signal Service
daily report.

331. E. Hoppe publishes a history of electricity (Leipsic, 1884). This
volume of 622 pages shows great industry on the part of the author,
who has probably made his work quite as exhaustive as would be profit-
able to the most patient reader. He divides the progress in this science
into the following epochs: (1) Before Franklin; (2) Franklin and Cou-
lomb; (3) from Volta to 1819; (4) electricity and magnetism; (5) from
Ohm to Helmholtz; (6) more recent progress. (D. J. Z., 1, p. 419.)

332. Prof. P. G. Tait, of Glasgow, in a lecture before the Scottish
METEOROLOGY. ; 361

Meteorological Soc¢i>ty, gives his views on the source of the elec-
tricity of the air about as follows: The new kinetic theory of gases
teaches that in a cubic inch of saturated aqueous vapor under atmos-
pheric pressure there are contained some three hundred trillion of par-
ticles. ‘This corresponds approximately to 755 of a cubic inch of water,
or to one rain drop of ordinary size. When every particle of vapor be-
comes electrified for any reason, and all are at the saine potential, then,
after the union of all into one rain drop, the potential of the latter will
be fifty billion times greater. From this it is evident that if from any
reason every particle of vapor received so slight a potential that it is im-
perceptible to our most delicate electrometers, yet the formation of drops
of water from these particles would explain the most terrible strokes of
lightning. Some years ago it occurred to me that the simple contact of
rapor particles with those of the air by the process of diffusion going on
between them must be sufficient to produce this extremely small poten-
tial. Thus the source of atmospheric electricity is the coutact of two
snbstances, as in Volta’s apparatus, where it is the contact of two dry
metals. Experiments upon a small scale have not as yet confirmed this
view, nor can it be thoroughly investigated without making them on so
large a scale that private means are inadequate to cover the expense.
oO. G.M., xr, p. 301.)

333. Prof. P. G. Tait communicates a critical summary of allsuggested
theories as to the source of atmospheric electricity. His own contact
theory is given above; the other theories may be briefly summarized as
follows: (1) Aerial friction; (2) Pouillet, combustion and evaporation;
(3) Saussure, vapor condensation ; (4) Peltier; and von Lamont, the per-
manent negative electrical charge of the earth by conduction and in-
duction clectrifies the air and vapor; (5) Sir William Thomson, air is
electrified by contact with the ground, and remains so after ascending
in the ordinary convection currents; (6) Becquerel, electified corpuscles
travel from the sun to the earth’s atmosphere; (7) Miihry, a direct effect
of solar radiation; (8) Liiddens, friction of vapor against the dry air;
(9) The capillary surface tension of water drops; (10) The production
of hail-storms; (11) Friction of air against the ground or against cur-
rents of air. (Nature, x1x, p. 517).

334, Prof. Edlund, of Stockholm, has endeavored to determine numer-
ically the amount of the unipolar induction due to the relative move-
ments of the atmosphere and the earth considered as a magnet. The
measures which he has made in Stockholm give for a layer 1 meter thick
at the equator an electro-motive force of 0.0321 Daniell’s cell. Allowing
that the moist air is a good conductor, and that the clouds have an
average height of 1,000 meters, he reckons that between the earth and
the clouds there must exist an electro-motive force of at least 23 Dani-
ell’s, which abundantly explains the electric tension ordinarily observed
in the air. The extraordinary electric tension necessary to produce a
lightning flash originates according to him in the increase of tension
362 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

that takes place when the volume occupied by the aqueous vapor is so
enormously diminished as in the formation of rain drops, a view that is
apparently similar to that of Tait and other authorities. (Z. O. G. M/.,
XIX, p. 535). ;

835. Prof. H. Dufour communicates to the Swiss Scientific Association
the results of his observations on the electricity of the air as made in
the laboratory at Lausanne. From six months’ observations with a
Mascart self-register, he finds approximately the maxima at 7 A. M. and
9 p.M.; the minima between 3 and 5 P.M. and3and4A.M. Negative
electricity occurs frequently during very hard snow; occasionally two
suecessive precipitations separated by clearing weather show opposite
electricities. The conditions recorded by the electrometer are very
complicated ; they depend upon the potential of the air at the water-
dropper, and on the induction of electrical layers on the water dropping
from the tube; in fact, the records of the electrometer are like those of
a thermometer hung freely in the air whose temperature is that which
results from conduction to the neighboring air and radiation to more
distant objects. Dufour has attempted to separate the electric indue-
tion and conduction from each other as follows: The discharge tube
was made to end in the center of a metallic cage of 40 centimeters cube,
each of whose six metallic sides could be removed without disturbing
the others. If the cage is entirely closed the electrometer shows the
poteutial of the mass of air streaming through it; if one or other side
beremoved, the instrument comes under the additional influence of induc-
tion through a definite region of space.

Together with these observations, Dufour, by allowing drops of water
to fall through unelectrified air, showed that electricity was more evi-
dent in air filled with water-dust than in pure air. Clouds of smoke
from burning wet straw, carried in currents of air past the apparatus,
showed for each cloud the presence of electricity, similarly clouds of
steam from a tube communicating with the earth. If the air of a great.
hall was electrified and strong drafts produced within, the hall, the
electrometer showed variations similar to those recorded by the Mas-
cart during the prevalence of north winds. Attempts to produce elec-
tricity in the air by the sudden condensation of vapor into fog gave
negative results. (Z. O. G. M., xx, p. 129.)

336. Prof. L. Palmieri publishes a little memoir summing up all his
works upon atmospheric electricity. According to him the electricity of
the earth’s surface is induced by that of the air. The potential of the air
is always positive in clear sky, and so, also, during a cloudy sky, pro-
vided that no rain has fallen within 70 kilometers; but as soon as rain
falls, positive and negative electricity rapidly alternate. Lightning ean
only cecur during or in connection with rainfall. The origin of atmos-
pheric electricity is, he thinks, to be found in the condensation of aqueous

yapor. (Z. O. G. I., xvii, p. 80.)
337. Dr. S. Kalischer, of Berlin, has experimentally investigated the
METEOROLOGY. 363

condensation of steam as a cause of electrification, and finds wholly neg-
ative results. (Nature, XxIx, p. 227.)

338. G. Le Goarant de Tromelin publishes in the Comptes Rendus
of Paris his theory that the principal cause of atmospheric electricity
consists in the friction of moist masses of air on the surface of the earth
orocean. The electrified molecules of water rise above and form clouds
on whose surface the electricity is expanded, which then gives occasion
to lightning; during the afternoon and evening the water, vapor, and
clouds, coo] down, the electric tension on the individual particles of mist
becomes greater, and the electric discharges known as heat-lightning
oceur. (Paris, Comptes Rendus, 1884, p. 248.)

339. Dr. Linns, of Darmstadt, in reference to the origin of atmos-
pheric electricity, suggests a laboratory experiment which he thinks is
new and will go far to elucidate his view of the subject, according to
which the electricity of the rain and thunder clouds can only affect the
instruments, and give the phenomena of high tension, through the sepa-
ration in space of the two principal parts of the cloud, namely, the air
and the vapor. The three fundamental questions are the following: (1)
whether electricity is first formed during the fall of the precipitation
possibly through its friction on the air, or (2) whether it is produced by
the process of condensation itself, or (3) whether before the precipitation,
in the mixture of air and vapor, the molecules of these components are
not laden with the opposite electricities. Linns considers the latter as
the most plausible, in view of our present knowledge of electricity,
that in fact the electricity of the clouds results from the well-known
phenomena of contact electricity observed in the contact of heitero-
genous bodies; the molecules of the components of a mixture of gases
are, in consequence of the enormous number of impacts which, accord-
ing to the latest theory, occurs in every second, oppositely electrified by
contact; this electricity, however, can only produce an exterior effect
through a rapid separation of the gases ; the original mixture itself
must always appear non-electric on account of the intimate mixture of
the oppositely electrified molecules, and since the sum of the positive
and negative electricities must be equal to each other. His proposed
experiment looks to the rapid separation of the vapor and gas by ab-
sorption, and the experiment should succeed with other gases and vapors
besides those of the atmosphere.

340. Dr. E. Hoppe, of Hamburg, having opposed this hypothesis from
a theoretical point of view, Dr. Linns replies suggesting other experi-
ments, and also states that he has now, since August, 1883, conducted
observations on the loss or dissipation of electricity by conductors ex-
posed to free atmosphere ; he finds the loss least in winter, greatest in
summer, less in the morning and evening, greater in the day-time. He
proposes that lines of equal electric loss be constructed on the daily
weather charts, by the study of which our knowledge of atmospheric
electricity will be much assisted. (D. M. Z., I, p. 464.)
364 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

341. Lieutenant Lephay, with a Mascart self-register and a water-
dropping collector 3 meters above the earth’s surface and 24 meters
above the ocean, at the French international station at Cape Horn, de-
duces the following results as to atmospherie electricity:

1. The normal tension is positive and between 50 and 70 volts; its
maximum occurs in clear sky and frosty weather.

2. The daily maxima and minima ordinarily observed were only ap-
parent at the cape in beautiful weather, with clear, blue skies free of
clouds.

3. Whenever the sky is beclouded after a fine day the normal ten-
sion immediately changes, and vice versa when the cloudiness clears
away.

4, Clouds affect the electrometer in different ways, according to the
form of the precipitated water, and even according to their direction
from the observatory ; cumuli increase the positive tension; high cirro-
cumuli increase it still further to plus 400 volts; cirro-stratus seem to
have no influence; fog and fine rain produce a positive tension that is
sometimes very high.

5. With hail there always comes an extraordinary strong, negative
tension, so that even sparks dart from the upper part of the apparatus.

6. Snow gives always a positive tension, and by so much the greater
as the snowflakes are larger.

7. Rain, with four exceptions, always gave a negative tension.

8. A fall of snow-dust and small ice-crystals on the 8th of May oc-
curred with a decided positive tension.

9. Of three sleet storms, two occurred with foggy weather, fine rain,
and positive tension, and one with heavy rain and negative tension.

10. For twelve or fifteen hours before the outbreak of heavy winds
and gusts the positive tension increased. It is not possible to say what
tension prevails during the storm itself, since the rapid-passing clouds
obscure the influence of the winds by their own more powerful effect.
The dry, warm, north-northwest or northeast winds diminish the posi-
tive or increase the negative tension; the cold west, southwest, and
south-southwest winds increase the positive tension. The strongest
electric phenomena occurred with moist winds from the west-northwest
aud west-southwest. (Z. O. G. M., xx, p. 471.)

342. Prof. E. Mach has more accurately investigated the amount of
protection from alightning discharge, as actually experienced by an ob-
ject inside of a metal box representing the wire-cage inclosure in Mel-
sen’s system of protection from lightning. He finds that although the
theoretical explanation of Melsen’s system must be slightly modified,
still even when the wire of the cage is brought to a red heat by the
lightning discharge the interior will be almost perfectly protected. (Z.
OV GRIN SxIx, p.-264:.)

343, Prof. J. J. Spartsch, of Breslau, in an essay on the climatology
of Greece, states that the statistics of the thunder-storms, or of days on

a
METEOROLOGY. 365

which thunder is heard, shows that the islind of Corfu belongs to a re-
gion in which electric discharges are more frequent than in any other
part of Europe. (Z. 0. G. M., XIx, p. 123.)

344. P. von Salis, telegraph inspector, has collected a mass of statis-
tics relative to lightning on telegraph lines, and at other stations dur-
ing the past thirty years in three cantons of Switzerland. He finds—

1. That in a remarkable way, with extraordinarily few exceptions,
and even then only where we may safely infer the presence of a great
quantity of water in the ground, all and every lightning discharge
occurs upon telegraph lines in the immediate neighborhood of a small
or large brook or river; further, these also occurred in the case of the
telegraph poles established for conveying submarine lines on the shore
of the lakes and never occurred elsewhere.

2, That the lightning for the past thirty years has occurred more fre-
quently on lines in the lowlands and valleys inclosed between high
mountains than on the highest Alpine passes. This latter conclusion
is borne out by the following table:

348. Prof. W. von Bezold has discussed the cases of destructive light-
ning in Bavaria during the years 1833 to 1882; this work is a continu-
ation of a lesser work undertaken some fifteen years ago. Among his
results we note that the frequency of destructive lightning when re-
duced to uniformity in the matter of buildings has almost steadily in-
creased in forty years to more than three times its previous frequency, a
remarkable phenomenon but apparently well established. As the prin-
cipal object of his investigation, von Bezold presents on a chart the
geographical distribution of lightning strokes for the year. (D. M. Z.,
I, p. 339.)

846. Dr. Kayser exhibited to the Berlin branch of the Meteorological
Society photographs of flashes of lightning, one of which showed four
parallel flashes from top to bottom, which must have occurred simulta-
neously or in very close succession; his opinion was that a double dis-
charge going and coming had occurred, the course of which (through
air of least resistance) had of course been displaced by a strong wind.
The amount of the displacement could be observed on the photographs
whence be calculated the time between the first and second discharge.

347. K. Schering, of G6ttingen, describes a new instrument for de-
termining the variations of the vertical component of terrestrial mag-
netic force. This has been used at GO6ttingen in connection with the
International Polar Observations; it has an advantage in that it is en-
tirely free from the perturbing influences of friction ; is much less influ-
enced by the torsion of the suspension thread and by the effect of tem-
perature on the center of gravity of the needle, which consists of a
magnetized steel tube 300 millimeters long and 10 millimeters interior
diameter. (Z. O. G. M., x1x, p. 547.)

348. A. L. von Tillo has collected together all possible data relative
to the geographical distribution and secular variation of the magnetic
declination and dip in European Russia. (Z. O. G. M., x1x, p. 550.)

849. Dr. Guido Schenzl publishes in one volume the result of sixteen
years’ labor on terrestrial magnetism in Hungary. The observations
extend from 1865 to 1879. All data are reduced to the normal station at
Munich, and the normal epoch, 1875.0. The charts show by isogonic
and other lines the general distribution of declination, dip, and inten
sity. (Z. 0. G. M., Xvu, p. 248.)

350. EK. E. Blavier, of Paris, having organized a very careful system
of observations, publishes a study on earth currents, made in accordance
with the suggestions of the Electrical Conference held at Paris in 1881.
As director of the telegraphic administration of france, Blavier has
had extensive opportunities and has used them skillfully. He finds the
general direction of the line of maximum electro-motive force in France
from northwest to southeast inclined 56° to the magnetic meridian.
(Nature, Xxx, p. 106.)

351. Prof. H. Wild has contributed to the subject of earth currents
an important study upon those observed in his buried telegraph cables
in the neighborhood of the observatory of Pavlosk. The principal series
of observations previously made were those by Lamont, 1859, with lines
only 100 meters long; Airy, 1862, with lines 13 and 16 kilometers long;
Galli, 1880, lines 4 and 6 meters long. {Lieutenant Ray, at Point Bar.
row, 1852, used four lines, each of about 300 meters length.] Professor
Wild used four lines, north, south, east, and west of the central mag-
netic observing station, which is itself underground. ‘The lines of wire
were each 1 kilometer in length, and crossed each other at the ob-
servatory, where the galvanometer was established. He deduces the
following results:

1. In this neighborhood in seasons of magnetic calm the earth current
is so feeble that its difference of potential for one kilometer is less than
the uncertainty of our measurements, or 0.001 of the electro-motive
force of one Daniell’s cell.

2. The currents observed by Galli at Velletri, on bis short line, were
wholly due to the ground plates; those observed by Lamont were partly
ground-piate and partly terrestrial currents; and those observed by
METEOROLOGY. oor

Airy on his long line undoubtedly show the presence of terrestrial cur-
rents, but there is no means of separating the one from the other.

3. In magnetic calms the difference of electric potential between
ground plates 1 kilometer apart, so far as it is due to terrestrial cur-
rents, is less than 0.001 volt, while so far as due to the plates themselves
it can easily amount to 0.05 volt, or even more; at times of magnetic
perturbations it is only rarely that the first difference increases to an
equality with the second.

4. In such short lines it is therefore imperative that the observation
be so arranged that we may distinguish between the terrestrial and the
ground-plate current, and this is easily done by making ditferent com-
binations of the four plates by means of the four connecting cables.

5. For plates 1 meter square and L kilometer apart the resistance of
the earth may be estimated at from 30 to 60 ohms; if, therefore, the
resistance of the cable and that of the galvanometer coil be each about
40 ohms, so that the total resistance of plate and wire be about 100
ohms, then a galvanometer must have a sensitiveness of 0.000002
ampere for one division of the scale in order that the deviations in
times of great magnetic perturbations shall not frequently exceed the
limits of the scale, supposing the latter to be 250 divisions long, cor-
responding to 0.05 volt.

6. The ratio of the strength of the earth current in any conductor to
the strength of the ground-plate current is independent of the resist-
ance of the conductor and of the size of the earth plate, but increases
with the distance between the latter; therefore an increase in the size
of the ground plates, or the introduction of resistance in the conductor,
do not tend to weaken the ground-plate current in comparison with the
terrestrial current.

7. If we desire to observe the terrestrial current during magnetic
calms, the distance between the plates must be at least 50 kilometers;
for shorter lines, say from 1 to 5 kilometers, the terrestrial current can-
not be satisfactorily observed unless the ground plates are much more
nearly alike than ordinarily attained. (Z. O. @. M., XIX, p. 55.)

352. H. Wild, from a further study of observations made up to Sep-
tember, 1883, draws the following conclusions:

1. The earth current appears not like a current of nearly uniform in-
tensity, but as alternating stronger and weaker currents, which rapidly
change their direction in space.

2. The east-to-west components are stronger than the north-and-south
component, or the direction of the current is nearer the parallels than
the meridians.

3. Only by taking the mean of the twenty-four term days during the
year do we find traces of slight diurnal change whose amplitude corre-
sponds nearly to 0.0008 volt.’ The diurnal change of the earth current
is therefore not the cause of the diurnal change in the magnetic ele-
ments,
368 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

4, As soon as the earth currents in both lines become strong, the mag-
netie instruments deviate from their ordinary positions, and these per-
turbations increase with the strength of the earth currents, but not in
any regular proportion.

5. The changes in the south-to-north line preceded by about five min-
utes the changes in variation of declination, and similarly the current
in the east-to-west line preceded the changes in the horizontal intensity,
so that the earth current would appear as the primary cause. He con-
cludes that the earth currents are the primary cause of many pertur-
bations, but not the cause of the periodic variations in the magnetic
elements. (Z. O. M. G@., XIx, p. 510.)

353. Prof. K. Schering, of Goéttingen, criticising Professor Wild’s re-
sults, states that the method is not thoroughly reliable, and expresses
his conviction that we cannot determine a difference of potential be-
tween two points of the earth, nor even prove its existence, if we use
ground plates which by contact with the earth become electrified in any
unknown manner. He recommends the method introduced by W. Sie-
mens in the programme of the German North Polar expedition for 1882-
83 as the only one to be used in determining the currents induced by
the changes taking place in the magnetic force of the earth. (Z. O. G.
MW... SIX, ps.552.)

354. The great magnetic storm and auroral display of November 17,
1882, is abundantly discussed, with numerous contributions of observa-
tions, throughout vols. xxvui and xxvitt of Nature.

355. T. W. Backhouse, of Sunderland, collects together all accessible
observations on the spectrum of the aurora, and-shows that the number
of striking coincidences between it and the modified air spectrum make
the suggestion that they are identical one worthy of consideration.
(Nature, XXVIII, p. 209.)

356. O. Jesse discusses the auroral are observed October 2, 1882, and
places it at an altitude of 122.2 kilometers, with a probable error of 4.5
kilometers. (Z. O. G. M., XVIII, p. 238.)

357. O. Jesse, in some remarks on the determination of the altitude
and position of the aurora, states that the very rapid changes going on
during a display make it important to have a method of determining its
altitude by observations made at one place. He has, therefore, devel-
oped such a method, which is published in full in the Astronomische
Nachrichten, No. 2540. This method is based upon the assumption that
the rays constituting the aurora lie on the surface of a cone whose apex
jS in the interior of the earth, where the direction of any one ray and the
osculating magnetic axis of the earth intersect each other. The appli-
cation of this method requires that we should measure for as many rays
as possible the angle under which the ray or its prolongation intersects
the horizon; also, the azimuth of the point in which the ray cuts the

sion is to be determined. Tor these observations he proposes a binoc.
ular attached to a circle having a horizontal axis which revolves around
a vertical axis, so that the binocular can have the plane of its axes
brought into the plane of the auroral beams. Many observations show
that the auroral rays arrange themselves pre-eminently along the mag-
netic parallels in curves that cut the magnetic meridians at right angles;
they also show that the auroral phenomena as arranged along the mag-
netic parallels follow the curves of equal total magnetic intensity. (7.
O. G. M., X1x, p. 405.)

358. Dr. H. Ekama, of Haarlem, gives a summary of the observations
on the aurora made by the International Polar party sent by the gov-
ernment of the Netherlands to the Sea of Kara. The aurora was in
general very unsteady and variable, so that drawings could rarely be
made. Ares frequently occurred, but soon changed to the form of
bands; the dark band below the are was never distinctly seen. The
aurora Was invariably visible when the heavens were clear and the moon
not too bright; the finest appearances occurred at about 10.30 P. M.,
when the corona most frequently occurred; the bands were strongest
about 9.30 p. mM. The anroras were generally on the north side of the
heavens, and only reached to the south of the zenith after a very bright
display; the highest point of the ares did not lie in the magnetic gra-
dient, but in the astronomical meridian. Out of 86 observed ares and
66 bands the summits of 64 and 41, respectively, lay in the astronomical
meridian. Ekama has computed the altitude of his auroras by the for-
mula given by Nordenskiold in his account of the Vega’s wintering in
Bebring’s Sound, 1878~79; the results of nine nights agree closely, and
give for the distance of the are above the earth’s surface 0.035 of the
earth’s radius; for the radius of the nearly horizontal are itself 0.934;
and for the distance of the center of this circle below the earth’s surface
0.02 of the earth’s radius, which value agrees with that of Nordenskiold.
The auroras were geuerally very faint; the arcs had nocolor. The wave
length of the peculiar auroral line was determined by the spectroscope
at 556.535 millionths of a millimeter; no other lines were visible; even
a wholly red aurora gave only this yellow-green line. No connection
was found between the polar bands of clouds and the auroral light. Out
of 203 polar bauds the vanishing or converging points were distributed
as follows:

| points. Cases. points. Cases.

The direction of the polar bands probably depends on the direction
of the wind prevailing at the cloud level. (Z. 0. G. M., x1x, p. 482.)

359. A. Paulsen, of Copenhagen, gives in Nature, xxix, p. 337, the
results of observation on the height of the aurora as made at Godthaab,
of which the following notice appears in the Austrian Zeitschrift fiir
Meteorologie:

The results of observations at that station on the altitude of auroras
were as follows:

Of the latter 14 cases the lowest were, respectively, 3.72, 3.69, 3.22,

360. Prof. H. Fritz, of Zurich, states that as these observations were
very carefully made, the distance between the two observers being 5.8
kilometers, they seem especially worthy of study, and undoubtedly
confirm the observations of S. Fritz, made at Ivigtut, and those of
Steenstrup, made in Iceland, and assure us that undoubtedly the
auroral light may exist even at the ground. He has therefore at once
collated all previous records of low-lying auroras, and makes some
general remarks upon the present staté of our knowledge with regard
to these and the character of the observations still needed to further
elucidate the subject. (Z. O. G. ML, x1x, p. 290.)

361. Prof. H. Fritz, in a general review cf Tromholt’s Nordlysets
Perioder and of Rubenson’s Catalogue of Swedish Auroras, finds that
the 111-year period, first determined by him in 1862 and confirmed by
Loomis for the American auroras, is also strongly confirmed by Ruben-
son’s catalogue. He also finds that the influence of the bright light of
the moon in introducing an apparent lunar period, as first shown by him
in 1864, is fully confirmed by Tromhelt from the study of observations
at Godthaab and Christiania. (Z. O. G. M., XVII, p. 321 )

362. Prof. Sophus Tromholt, in his ‘Om Nordlysets Perioder,” pub-
lished by the Institut Mét. Danois, deduces the following conclusions
from the observations of the aurora made at Godthaab, in Greenland,
during 1865 to 1880 by Professor Kleinschmidt:

1. Everything pertaining to the variable frequency of auroras in
Godthaab proves that the phenomenon exists there under quite different
conditions from those obtaining in lower latitudes.

2. The number of observed auroras is inversely proportional to the
square root of the cloudiness.

3. After correcting for cloudiness there remains not only no parallel-
ism between the .sun:spots and the auroras, but even an almost diamet-
rical difference as to frequency.

4. The maximum of auroras is delayed two years behind the minimum
aa METEOROLOGY. EY @|

of sun-spots, but the next following auroral minimum coincides with
the sun-spot maximum.

5. Some observations by Bloch, 1841 to 1846, show that the number
of auroras is very large at the minimum of sun-spots, but decreases as
the sun-spots increase.

6. By separating the evening and morning auroras he finds the former
twice as numerous as the latter, and that itis probable that the evening
auroras give us the best idea of the true condition of the atmosphere
with reference to these phenomena.

7. The morning and evening auroras both show a maximum in the
polar region at the time of the winter solstice.

8. Kleinschmidt distinguishes eight types of auroras, three stationary,
and five of them movable. Of these the most interesting is his type
number 7, namely, rays arranged in a band stretching from the north-
east to the southwest and passing through the zenith. This phenomenon
rises in the east like a column of fire from some point in the interior of
Greenland. The column is narrowest and brightest over the land, while
its southwestern extremity, namely, over the sea, is slightly broader
and fainter, so that in general it does not seem to touch the southwest
horizon. These arches almost always take the same position. [This
form of arch, which is comparatively rare in Europe, is much more fre-
quent in the United States and Canada. An attempt to locate several
such arches and to explain their structure will be found in the report
of the Chief Signal Officer for 1876. |

9. The aurora very rarely appears to the north of Godthaab, the cen-
ter of the phenomenon is most frequently between the south and south-
southeast, and this holds good for the whole of the west coast of Green-
Jand.

10. The color of an aurora is almost invariably white, except only a
little red or green during the most rapid movemeuts; not the slightest
noise has ever been heard.

11. With reference to the oscillation north and south of the zone of
greatest auroral frequency, Tromholt finds that the relative frequency
of auroras which occur in the zenith or to the north of the observer has
an annual period showing two minima at the equinoxes and a maximum
at the winter solstice.

2. In every month he finds that the morning auroras are more fre-
quent in the zenith and the north than in the south, and that the re-
verse holds good for the evening auroras.

13. As regards the auroras in the daytime, his figures confirm Wey-
precht’s conclusion that, in the neighborhood of the autumn equinox,
the auroral zone stretches toward the south and then turns toward the
north to reach its northernmost position at the winter solstice, if then
returns southward and Lasits southernmost position at the spring equi-
nox.

14, In the course of twenty-four hours the auroral zone moves north-
372 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

ward during the night and southward during the day. This explains
at once the daily period which is especially marked in middle latitudes
where the maximum frequency of auroras occurs some hours before
midnight.

15. At the time of the aurora maximum the frequency at Godthaab
exceeds not only the absolute but also the relative frequency for the
zenith for this locality, or others more to the north of it; a similar
statement is true for the time of minimum. Therefore, in the course of
the eleven-year period, there is a periodic movement of the auroral zone
which lies further north during the sun-spot minimum than during the
maximum.

16. We see thus that a perfect harmony exists between the eleven-
year period and the annual and diurnal periodicity, so that these three
periods have one and the same cause, namely, the oscillation of the
auroral zone.

17. Considering each of Kleinschmidt’s seven types separately, Trom-
holt finds that during the auroral maximum not only the frequency,
extent, and intensity, but also the variety of kinds surpasses those
of the minimum.

18. Between the periodicity of the cirrus clouds and that of the
aurora a connection exists, such that these phenomena have their max-
ima and minima almost at the same time.

Trombolt concludes that we are not able to establish a satisfactory
theory as to the nature and cause of the aurora, but that it is not a
cosmic phenomenon is shown by the want of agreement in the auroral
periods tor the whole earth. For the present, therefore, observations
are of the first importance. He has organized a network of observers
for Scandinavia, Finland, Denmark, England, and Iceland, and has
already shown that over so small a region as Norway no day passes
without an aurora at one or more points. (Z. O. G. Jl., XVIII, p. 306.)

863. Prof. S. Lemstrém, of Helsingfors, gives the results of his own
observations on artificial] auroras at Oratunturi and Sodankyla and Pie-
tarintunturi, (Nature, XXvutl, p. 60.)

364. Prof. S. Tromholt communicates a general account of his latest
researches, during 1882 and 1883, into the aurora and its phenomena in
Northern Finmark, where the aurora is seen almost every night in nu-
merous forms and frequently very low down, although his own estimate
ot its height is 150 kilometers. (Nature, XXVU, p. 394.)

365. Aiter concluding his special observations in Kautokeino, Nor-
way, Tromholt took up his residence in Redykjavik, Iceland, in October,
1883, and communicates to Nature some of the results of his work dur-
ing the winter 1883~84. Helhas never as yet seen any auroral light de-
scend to the low level of the mountain top of Esja, namely, about 2,500
feet. The weather, however, has been very unfavorable, and he has made
but 40 observations on 83 thoroughly clear evenings ; appareutly I[ce-

land lies, at least for this year, south of the position of the maximum
zone. (Nature, XXIX, pp. 226, 543, 409, and 537.)

366. On page 80, vol. xxx, of Nature, Tromholt states that a few
lovely days have enabled him to set up his artificial-aurora apparatus
on the summit of Esja, but without as yet any optical results.

367. In the autumn of 1584, Prof. Tromholt returned to Bergen where
he will work on the great catalogue of auroras observed in Northern
Europe, which with other works is being prosecuted at the expense of
the Norwegian government. (Nature, Xxx, p. 592.)

368. T. von Oppolzer, of Vienna, at a meeting of welcome in honor
of the session of the International Polar Commission April 21, 1854, de-
livered an address upon the connection between atmospheric refraction
and the distribution of temperature throughout the air. After explain-
ing his formula for refraction, based on the assumption that the change
of temperature with altitude is proportioned to the change of density of
the air, and having shown that this empirical assumption agrees with
the observations at least for the lowest 10 kilometers, he says that it
may now be asked whether the observed atmospheric refraction may
not give some clue to the actual temperatures at great heights in the
air where direct observations can never hope to reach. This, however,
he answers in the negative, but, in regard to the lower strata, it is en-
tirely possible for meteorology to derive assistance from astronomical
observations, though the latter will undoubtedly receive much more
assistance from the former. This essay is printed as an appendix to
the Zeitschrift of the Austrian Association for May, 1884. (Z. 0. G.
M., XIX, p..265.)

369. P. G. Tait gives a thorough elucidation of the atmospheric con-
dition necessary to produce forms of mirage. This is in continuation of
his former paper on mirage, and as an example of an application of
Hamilton’s general method in optics, which is being published by the
Royal Society of Edinburgh. (Nature, xxviu, p. 84.)

370. C. Montigny has for some time observed the colors of the stars
by means of a scintillometer, and among other things has discovered
that the blue color prevails remarkably when rain approaches, and
this phenomenon can therefore be used for the prediction of rain. In
June, 18835, having observed that the blue color had been absent for three
months, and that the green was becoming more prominent, Montigny ven-
tured the prediction that the quantity of water in the upper strata of
air had become diminished, and that during the year 1883 fewer long
rains would oceur. This prediction having been well fulfilled, Montigny,
in April, 1884, made the same observations and renewed the same pre-
374 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1ss4.

diction for this year; in fact, he had observed that the blue was even

‘Jess prominent than in 1883, that the green was more prominent, and
that even violet occasionally occurred. Montigny suggests that the
blue tint in the scintillation is due tothe water in the atmosphere, which
is known to have a bluish tint when viewed by ordinary sunlight.
(Z. O. G. M., XIX, p. 534.)

371. L. Thollon contributes to the Bulletin Astronomique an elabo-
rate study into the structure and origin of the lines forming the group
B of the solar spectrum, which paper is handsomely reproduced in Na-
ture, XXX, p. 520. This region was carefully worked over by Piazzi
Smyth, and Langley; but Thollon has now revised his own previous
work, and the elegant map given by him shows at a glance, first, the
metallic lines; second, those produced by atmospheric vapors—probably
the aqueous vapors; third, those produced by atmospheric gases—oxy-
gen, nitrogen, carbonic acid, and any others that do not materially vary
in quantity, leaving finally non-telluric lines, twenty-five in all, or sev-
enteen if we count double and triple lines as one. The lines due to at-
mospheric gases constitute a system of twelve pairs, and the whole
group is distinguished by its regular symmetry. Under such a seru-
tiny as this there seems no doubt that certain lines are also a perfect in-
dication of the hygrometric state of the air. In 1882 Professor Egoroff,
of Warsaw, joined Thollon in his investigations at Paris, where they
examined the spectrum of a beam of electric light 10 kilometers long,
and which gave a perfect reproduction of the telluric rays ; afterwards, by
condensing oxygen in a short tube, the gaseous rays were obtained foy the
eroups A and B, and probably a greater quantity of oxygen would have
given the feebler group Alpha; so that these three groups, A, B, and
Alpha, originate in the absorption of atmospheric oxygen. That the spec-
trum of absorption for cold oxygen should differ so much from the spec-
trum of emission for incandescent oxygen is, he thinks, attributable to
the influence of heat. Thollon is at present engaged in the further
search for lines or groups due to the presence of nitrogen or carbonic
oxide. Hitherto, apart from the oxygen, or A, B, and Alpha groups,
he has discovered no lines that may be confidently attributed to the
constant gaseous portions of the atmosphere. (Nature, XXX, p. 520.)

372. G. Pizzighelli publishes, through Dr. E. Hornig, a work on Acti-
nometry, or the photometry of the chemically active radiations. The
author is a most expert photographer, and has here compiled an almost
exhaustive account of modern apparatus and methods for measuring the
intensity of light by photographic and chemical methods. He gives a
special chapter to the meteorological applications of actinometry, espe-
cially the results of the studies of Pernter, published in 1882. (D. MI. Z.,
I, p. 420.)

373. Captain Abney, as the result of photographing the ultra-red
portion of the solar spectrum in very various atmospheric conditions,
found that in very dry weather the photographs show only absorption
METEOROLOGY. aye

lines, but in very moist weather they show strong absoption bands, which
are more numerous and darker as the relative humidity of the air is
greater. These demonstrate that this absorption is not due to the true
aqueous vapor in the air, but to water in a fluid condition, namely, mi-
nute fog or cloud particles. He also concludes that it is certainly
water in this fluid condition that causes the deep blue of the sky, since
no other ground can be imagined why the color should be a deeper biue
in moister weather; this view is also confirmed by the fact that in as-
cending high mountains the tint changes from a dark to a black blue.
(Z. O. G. M., XVIII, p. 276.)

374. Captain Abney and Colonel Festing have presented a valuable
paper on the influence of water in the atmosphere on the solar spee-
trum. They both recognize the fact that the spectrum extends to the
lower limit established by Langley; they then investigate the radiation
from the positive pole of the electric are, and introduce absorbing layers
of water. These so modify the original curve of distribution of heat
in the spectrum that even the introduction of an absorbing layer of
water 14 of inch thick reduces it to similarity with the curve given by
sunlight, whence they conclude that the greater part of the absorption
in the red and ultra-red portions of the solar spectrum is due to the
presence of water. As opposed to Langley’s opinion that the maximum
intensity of the solar spectrum outside of the earth’s atmosphere lies
nearer the blue, their own observations give an extra-atmospheric¢ curve
having a second maximum in the ultra-red. This they explain as due to
the superposition of radiations belonging to a low temperature upon
radiations from bodies with a high temperature, the former being the
prevalent. By examples they show that the superposition of such
curves from different sources of heat will give such aresult. Assuming
with Dewar that the areas of these radiation curves are proportional to
the temperatures of the radiating bodies, they find the temperature of
the sun’s surface to be between 10,000 and 12,000 degrees. (Z. O. G. IL,
x1x, 430, and Nature, XXVItl, p. 45.)

375. H. Becquerel has studied the same question by means of the
phenomena of phosphorescence. He has investigated under different
atmospheric conditions the ultra-red part of the spectrum, and, like
Captain Abney, found that the absorption lines increase with the rela-
tive humidity. He also found that the absorption bands of layers of
fluid water agreed for various thicknesses of water with the above lines
for corresponding relative humidities. (Z. O. G. M., xvii, p. 277.)

376. Cornu proposes to determine the absorption of the solar rays by
observing the intensity of well determined atmospheric lines in the
solar spectrum, which he accomplishes by comparing them with the
constant lines that certainly owe their existence to the absorption in the
solar atmosphere. This is an extension of the proposition to observe
the rain band so earnestly advocated by Piazzi Smyth. Cornu chooses
that portion of the spectrum between the wave length 587.40 and 602,90,
576 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 18984.

and assigns to the various groups of atmospheric lines corresponding
metallic lines for comparison. (Z. O. G. M., XVII, p. 239.)

377. Dr. H. Klein, in reference to the use of the spectroscope, or the
observation of the so-called rain band, states that his own observations
confirm those of Smyth, Capron, and others to the effect that a promi-
nent rain band is regularly followed in a short time by precipitation.
However, the frequent exceptions to this rule renders the spectroscope
alone very unreliable; this is to be attributed to the fact that the spec-
troscope makes no distinction between the moisture near by and that at a
ereat distance. When from his observatory Klein examines the horizon
at an altitude of 20°, he finds the vapor lines on the east, southeast, and
noitheast notably darker and more prominent than in any other direc-
tion; this he attributes to the fact that a few thousand feet distant on
the east flows the broad Rhine; but he states that this increase of the
vapor line does not always occur, and at certain times the influence of
the Rhine is not to be noticed; he has as yet found no explanation for
these exceptional cases. The application of the spectroscope to the
prediction of rain is, he thinks, problematic, except in the case of heavy
thunder storms for which it frequently gives good indications. Upton’s
comparison showed that 69 per cent. of rain predictions were verified
within twenty-four hours when based entirely upon the intensity of the
_ rain band, but 84 per cent. were verified when other meteorological con-
ditions were taken into account. The spectroscope has been used at
the Wetterwarte of the Cologne Zeitung with satisfactory results in
summer. (Z. O. G. M., XIX, p. 531.)

378. Mr. W. Ackroyd has read before the Physical Society of London
a mathematical investigation of the rainbows produced by light before
entering the rain drops. (Nature, XXvi, p. 133.)

379. The observation of coronas and fogbows, made at the summit of
Ben Nevis, promises to give us valuable information in regard to the size
and shape of the particles composing the clouds ; thus, October 4, 1884,
strong double corona surrounded the moon; outer diameter of the red
circle was for the outer corona 7° 46’, and for the inner corona 49 52’,
When clouds came between the moon and observer three such rings
were seen, the measurements of which gave for the inner ring 4° 6/,
middle 6° 2/, outer 8° 10’, the probable error in each ring being about
8’. A colorless pair of fogbows visible on a distant fog bank gave
diameters of 75° for the outer ring, 65° for the inner and fainter ring;
the space between the ring appeared quite dark and no color could be
distinguished. (Nature, Xxx, p. 613.)

380. Professor von Bezold, in the publications of the International
Polar Commission, described the normal phenomena of twilight as fol-
lows:

1. A bright segment appears on that side of the sky below whose
horizon the sun is found; this is limited at the top by a special bright
METEOROLOGY. att

zone, above which the ordinary blue or purple sky is visible, while be-
low we have yellow, then orange, and on the horizon brownish red.

2. Opposite to the above is a dark segment which is simply the ashy-
tinted shadow of the earth, and which is sharply distinguished from
the remaining portion of the beavens.

3. A circular region of considerable diameter of a rosy-red that is
generally described as the purple light; this develops above the bright
segment a long time before sunrise or after sunset, so that the lower
part of this region seems to be hidden behind the bright segment.
The center of this region sinks rapidly after sunset, while at the same
time its radius increases so that finally the limit of the borders of the
purple region unites with that of the bright segment, the impression
being as if the purple light slipped in behind the bright segment. The
purple light plays the part of a very much magnified, very much diluted,
image of the sun; at the time of its greatest development the general
brightness is increased so that objects on the earth’s surface that were
invisible soon after sunset become again visible. The maximum of this
second illumination occurs in the Alps when the sun is four or five de-
grees below the horizon, at which time the center of the purple light
is about 18° above the horizon, while its highest point reaches up to 40°
or 50°.

As soon as the purple light has completely disappeared behind the
bright segment there appears a second dark segment on the opposite
side of the sky. Soon there further develops a second bright segment
above the slowly sinking first one, and only with difficulty distinguished
therefrom; with very clear skies one can later occasionally also observe
a second purple light, and therewith a temporary increase of bright-
ness, so that a third illumination of objects favorably located can be ob-
served. [It would seem that the occurrence of two separate periods of
the red or rosy or purple tint, as was observed in the winter of 1883-84
at many places throughout the world, is therefore simply an unusual de-
velopment of an ordinary phenomenon. The twilight phenomena of
1883~84 have been specially due to the remarkable development of the
second purple light, which has frequently surpassed the first purple
mebt.| (0... Z.,.1, p. 32.)

381. Dr. G. Hellmann contributes some observations on twilight made
by himself in Spain, 1875 to 1877, and follows this by a comparison with
previous authorities, from allof which he deduces the following results:

1. The depression of the sun under the horizon at the end of the as-
tronomical twilight is not, as has been generally assumed, constant at
about 18 degrees.

2. The depression shows a decided annual period, a maximum in win-
ter and minimum in summer.

3. The depression 1s greater in the morning than in the evening.

4, It shows an intimate connection with the relative humidity of the
378 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

air, increasing and diminishing directly with it, so that the items 2 and
3 are probably explicable thereby.

5. It follows that this angle (whose annual mean value for the even-
ing twilight is in Athens 15°.9, southern Spain 15°.6, South Atlantic
Ocean 15°.6) must be greater in high latitudes than in low, and on the
ocean than in dry continental regions, but this conclusion needs further
confirmation by other observations.

6. Since the twilight depression of the sun is thus periodically vari-
able it follows that the various solutions of the problem of the short-
est twilight thus far offered are no longer sufficient. (Z. O. G. M., XIx,
p. 57.)

382. Dr. G. Hellmann, in a second communication on the twilight
phenomena, analyses numerous observations from all parts of the world
and formulates the following conclusions relative to the difference be-
tween this phenomenon in southern Spain and in Germany.

1. The phases of the phenomenon are better developed in Spain than
in Germany, the chronological order is more determined, the strata of
different colors are easier to distinguish from each other, the limit of
the bright segment against the dark sky is very sharp.

2. In Germany the extension of the colors in time and space are
greater than in Spain, except for the anti-twilight.

3. In reference to the colors, green was almost regularly observed in
all its shades in Spain but rarely in Germany.

4, The red colors of the twilight in Spain had in Germany very fre-
quently a decidedly flesh color and purple tint.

5. Violent colors in Germany were more decided than in Spain.

6. In Spain there was a greater contrast between the twilight phe-
nomenon of the summer and winter (the dry and rainy periods) than in
Germany.

The above conclusions, and in fact this whole essay, were completed
before the appearance of the remarkable sky colors of 188384, and in
reference to these Hellman states in a note that, although he has fol-
lowed it closely and collected numerous reports from others, yet he will
not at present attempt any analysis or explanation. He however notes
the great ignorance of observers generally as to what constitutes the
ordinary and typical phenomena of the twilight, and at present his own
feeling is that the real peculiarity of the phenomena of 1883~84 con-
sisted in their universality, the length of duration, the intensity and
variety of colors. (4. O. G. M., xIx, p. 162.)

383. Professor Kiessling, of Hamburg, has reproduced the experi-
ments of Coulier, Mascart, and Aitken on the effect of dust in the atmos-
phere. He says that if we understand the word dust to refer to the
total of all foreign substances in the atmosphere, including coarse and
fine particles of dust, microscopic or organic forms, the products of pu-
trefaction and oxidation, even when they are entirely gaseous, as, for
instance, the expirations of human beings and animals, there will be
METEOROLOGY. 379

found a definite very small quantity of dust which is especially favora-
ble for the development of color by the process of diffraction, and this
can therefore be specified as the dust favorable to opticak phenomena.

2. The absolute maximum of color due to diffraction is in moist air
conditional upon the simultaneous occurrence of this optical dust with
the maximum relative humidity of the air stratum in which it is con-
tained.

3. The twilight colors depend principally upon diffraction in moist
air. (D. M. Z., I, p. 34.)

384, Professor Kiessling, of Hamburg, has collected together the ob.
servations of others and compared them with his own obsexsvations on
the influence of artificial fog on direct sunlight, and the consequent ex-
planation of the twilight phenomena. He uses a glass vessel with sev-
eral apertures in connection with a Sprengel or water air pump; within
this vessel he forms fogs of varying degrees of intensity, and examines
the diffraction phenomena when a beam of sunlight falls upon the fog
from the heliostat. Besides the fog from aqueous vapor, he also utilizes
the sulphate of ammonia, phospborie acid, gunpowder, and other sub-
stances producing very dense smoke or fog; for instance, with sulphate
of ammonia a very dense smoke is produced consisting of exceedingly
small hard particles of this salt; after twenty or thirty minutes of set-
tling a thick white dust covers the base and sides of the vessel. The
sun, seen through the cloud, does not blind the eye, but shows a re-
markable change of colors. At the first moment of its formation the
sun appears of a brilliant dark copper color, but changes its color
rapidly, first to a violet tint and then through dark carmine red into a
brilliant azure blue. This change of colors occupies in dry air about
two minutes, but in moist air scarcely twenty seconds; similar phenom-
ena take place with other heavy vapors. If the light is allowed to fall
upon a white screen it is seen to be at first of a copper-brown, which
afterward becomes blue. If in place of these chemical dust-clouds we
allow a stream of aqueous vapor to escape from a steam boiier, the cloud
of fog shows an intense blue as soon as the above beam of blue solar
light falls upon it; if the stream of vapor is, however, properly man-
aged, it can be made to exhibit in itself all the changes from brownish
red to blue, which, however, very rapidly disappear on account of the
dissipation of the cloud. In order to accomplish this best the stream of
steam must be horizontal and mixed with a feeble current of very cold
air drawn overice. It has not yet been possible to Kiessling to experi-
mentally reproduce the green colors of the sun.

If the vessel within which the diffraction phenomena are produced is
full of moist, perfectly filtered air, entirely free from dust, then a fog can
. be produced by simply lowering the temperature, which is, however,
only visible in direct sunlight. This fog consists of very small, seat-
tered, rapidly moving particles of vapor, which, however, in transmitted
light show not the slightest trace of colored diffraction rings, evidently
380 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

because there are too few of them. This fog renders it very doubtful
if the law announced by Aitken in 1879 can be true, according to which
aqueous vapor will not condense from the air without having a solid
nucleus of dust particles on which to accumulate. If into the vessel
full of filtered air a small stream of steam enters, then the first cloud
formation of fine fog soon disappears, but after a few minutes large
scattered rain drops strike on the surface of the inclosure, and form a
rain without fog or cloud. But if we allow a very small quantity of
dusty air to enter the vessel, then immediately fine fog is formed along
side of the larger rain drops. If the beam of sunlight falls upon this
mixture of rain and fog, then a yellow halo with reddish brown borders
is formed of the same color and magnitude as with ordinary lunar
halos. If now by lowering the pressure we produce a sudden fall in
temperature, there is formed a system of larger fog particles and a cor-
responding system of larger diffraction rings without changing those
already formed. In order to realize a fine mist or fog or haze of particles
having a very uniform size we must evidently have the maximum quan-
tity of moisture in the vessel, or the most favorable mist and the most
perfect saturation. This is best attained by introducing quite warm
moist air and lowering the temperature rather slowly. In this way we
obtain a very intense development of color, and the amplitude of the dif-
fraction circle varies between 10° and 30° depending upon the size of the
particles while the intensity of the color depends upon the uniformity of
their size. By further diminution of pressure and consequent cooling
and increase in the size of the particles remarkable changes in color take
place; the variations in the colors depend in a very sensitive way upon
the degree of saturation and the rapidity of cooling. In this way Kiess-
ling has been able to re-produce so large a number of the appearances
observed in nature that there can scarcely be any doubt but that the
diffraction due to particles of aqueous vapor will be found to explain
nearly all our sky colors. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 117.)

385. Dr. von Danckelman has published an extensive memoir col-
lating the meteorological observations made on the coast of southwest
Africa, and especially at Vivi on the Lower Congo. A summary of his
results with regard to the cloudiness is given by him in D. M. Z., I, p.
301.

Von Danckelman ealls attention to the fact that the great forest and
prairie fires of the Congo in central Africa throw up into the atmos-
phere such an enormous amount of fine dust, that we have here a source
of production of fine particles that annually throws great quantities
into our atmosphere—quite as much or vastly more than could have come
from the Krakatoa eruption. (D. M. Z.,1, p. 311.)

386. [The corresponding prairie and forest fires in America, giving |
rise to our Indian summer haze, have long been known to produce a
copper-red tint in the sky and over the solar disk. This haze however
has rarely been known to spread fa: eastward over the Atlantic, and
METEOROLOGY. 381

certainly never around the world, and to all latitudes from 60 north to
40 south ; neither does it ever give rise to anything like the brilliant
purple twilight. The great cload of smoke due to the forest fires of 1871
(not to the Chicago fire as erroneously assumed) was observed by navi-
gators in the mid Atlantic. The haze is in fact composed of minute
particles of carbon, each of which, as is well known, has the property of
condensing upon itself a small atmosphere of other gases, including
aqueous vapor. This quasi-chemical action seems to hold the vapor in
an invisible state at a lower temperature than would have been the case
were no particles there; it hinders condensation so that rain and cloud
are lessened during the prevalence of this smoke. When however rain
does form, it falls with unusual severity. It is, we think, likely that to
this property of carbon or to the special radiating and cooling proper-
ties of fine solid particles that we must attribute the phenomena dis-
cussed by Aitken, as there can be no doubt that aqueous vapor will con-
dense into fog particles and larger drops even in an atmosphere free
from fog and solid particles. |

387. [The remarkable red sunsets and sunrises of October to Decem-
ber, 1883, have formed the subject of innumerable contributions both
from an observational and theoretical standpoint. Exhaustive investi-
gations are promised by committees of societies, especially the Royal So-
ciety, which have undertaken to collect all the data relative to these
important phenomena. The hypothesis that these were due to the
gradual spread over the northern hemisphere of dust ejected from the
tremendous eruption of Krakatoa, started by Bishop, September 5, 1883,
and Lockyer, October, 1883, was first modified into the assumption that
moisture as well as, or even instead of, dust was more plausible; the
possibility being granted that the vapor exists in the form of minutest
spicule of ice or of minute spheres. Subsequently it became a query
whether circumstances favorable to the dissemination of ice spicule or
vapor in the higher regions might not have existed independent of the
Krakatoa eruption ; this view was then strengthened by the discovery
that similar twilight phenomena had been observed some time before
the Krakatoa eruption, while on the other hand it was also shown
that several volcanic eruptions in past years had been followed by
similar sky colors. The renewal of the phenomena in 1884 made it
highly probable that we have to seek the cause of these colors in some-
thing outside of the earth’s atmosphere; during a whole year the sun
had been surrounded by a large irregular cloud of haze, extending 20
to 40 degrees from its center in all directions. This haze was decidedly
Streaky or striated, and occasionally showed a pinkish tint. At present
the most plausible hypothesis seems to be that the earth in the autumn
of 1883, and again of 1884, passed through a stream of gaseous or va-
porous meteoric matter, which temporarily combined with the earth’s
atmosphere, while the great mass passed on to the sun, and has accu-
mulated as a nebulous cloud about that body. The color phenomena,
382 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

as Seen in our atmosphere, are most plausibly due to selective absorp-
tion and reflection from minute solid particles, whose size is comparable
with the dimensions of the wave length of light. That these should
exercise also a selective influence upon the ultra-red rays, such as
would be detected by Langley’s bolometer, seems highly probable. It
is therefore possible that the general distribution of heat over the earth’s
surface may have been slightly affected by the novel addition to our
atmosphere, and especially may have had some influence upon the for-
mation of rain and snow; but these influences must have been quite fee-
ble, and have not yet been demonst: ted from observations. On several
occasions during the past century the earth has passed near enough to
comets or their tails to awaken inquiry as to the possible result of actual
contact; in fact, in the summer of 1576, the carth may possibly have
encountered the tail of the comet then visible, as several observers re-
ported the appearance of pinkish and ashen tints in the sky. It would
not be surprising if we should sometime be able to show that these sky
and sunset phenomena, as well as the aurora, and possibly other mat-
ters, such as Wilkes’s red fog, may be due to the encountér of cosmic
meteoric matter by the earth in its annual orbit.]

388. Dr. Neumayer publishes a large collection of data relative to
the twilight and other phenomena, in a series of papers extending
through the first volume of the Journal of the German Meteorological
Society.

389. Prof. H. Krone, of Dresden, communicated through Dr. Neu-
mayer his observations and conclusions as to the nature of the twi-
light phenomena.

1. A fine haze that cannot be called a fog and that does not diminish
the brightness of the sunshine must be the origin, and has been pres-
ent ever since the last of August.

2. The twilight colors were tested by the use of a number of colored
glasses, which showed that the orange was absorbed by the blue, while
the red was not; the red region agreed with the ring observed by Falb.
This ring he considers due, not to diffraction, but that it is the red re-
gion of the rays of less refrangibility, like the reddish, yellow and red
caused by the ordinary refraction at sunrise or sunset, and due to the
air and its vapor.

3. A variation appeared on the evening of January 2, shortly after
the outburst of the orange, as an intense rosy red bundle of rays,
which in a few minutes extended from the sun, then under the horizon,
in all directions through the red region nearly up to the zenith, and
sideways for 70° in the horizon either side of the sun. Similar phe-
nomena were seen by Krone during his journey to India in 1875, and
both appearances then and now indicated that the sun’s rays were
passing between clouds in our atmosphere beyond the horizon and
through a stratum of air containing more aqueous vapor, which com-
municated to them a rosy red tint.
METEOROLOGY. o

4. It is not to be denied that the phenomena in general are due to
the refraction of the sun’s rays in the aqueous vapor of the atmosphere ;
but in order to explain the superposition of color we must also con-
sider the reflection of colored rays from exceedingly small bodies at an
extraordinary heightin the atmosphere. This does not constitute inter-
ference phenomena. [It has been called, very appropriately, selective
reflection. |

5. The ordinary twilight is, to a certain extent, such a phenomenon
of reflection; the astronomical twilight disappears at the horizon when
the sun is about 18° below that plane from which we compute the alti-
tude of the layer of haze producing it; but if the duration of twilight
increases we must conclude that the layer of haze is proportionately
higher. Krone’s observations, however, in December, 1583, and Janu-
ary, 1884, seem to show that occasionally the twilight did not disappear
through the whole night, but thata reddish tint was visible in the hori-
zon and even half way to the zenith. That this reflecting material can
possibly be the finest dust from the volcanic eruption at Krakatoa, is, he
thinks, entirely improbable; neither can it be due to the presence of ice
spicul, but it must be minute particles of water. Owing to the low
temperature in the upper regions, this water can only be frozen. but we
know nothing as yet as to the form of the particles of such very cold
aqueous vapor. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 277.)

390: [The examination of certain thin hazy clouds that covered Paris
during January, 1882, was made by Fonvielle, who rose up into them in
his balloon, and found that they were formed of the minutest spheres of
water frozen at a temperature many degrees below freezing; the forma-
tion of the cloud was apparently due to radiation, as it stayed in the same
locality for several weeks. The atoms of water were quiescent, but if
setin motion among themselves crystallized into minute spicule. Dufour
has shown that minute drops may be cooled to —20° C., so long as the
surface tension is kept large without crystallizing or even solidifying; it
is therefore plausible that the twilight phenomena of 1883-54 were due
to selective reflection and diffraction by aqueous spherules of the finest
size, such as must always exist to a greater or less extent in the upper
atmosphere. If the particles, whether dust or vapor, were electrified
before or while being carried up to the height of several miles, they
would in the thin air of that region not only be carried along by its
currents, but by their own mutual repulsion would tend to rise still
higher, forming an appendage to the earth, and reminding one of the
ascent of an envelope from the surface of the nucleus of a comet, where
the particles are distinctly seen to ascend on the hot side toward the
sun and then by mutual repulsion, as shown by G. P. Bond and other
astronomers, flow away from the sun. ]

391. Among the principal items relating to the sunsets and Kra-
katoa, we may mention the following :

Lockyer’s theory of the volcanic dust. (Nature, XXx1x, pp. 148-174.)
384 SCIENTIFIC RECORI> FOR 1884.

Clement Ley’s theory that the sunsets are due to ice spicule. (Na-
ture, XXX, p. 175.)

Mr. Bishop, of Honolulu, made the observations of the sunset colors
on September 5, 1883, and immediately suggested that they were due
to clouds of dust from Krakatoa which had come around westward
three-fourths the circumference of the earth. (Nature, xx1x, p. 174.)

A number of interesting items were published at the May meeting of
the Mauritius Meteorological Society. (Nature, vol. xxx, p. 279.)

An excellent map of the Krakatoa region is given in Nature, Xx1x,
p. 228.

The Royal Society has appointed a special committee, of which Mr.
G. J. Symons, of London, is the chairman, to collect data.

The report of the French mission sent to Krakatoa in June, 1884, is
briefly summarized at Nature, vol. Xxx, p. 372; the report of Mons. R.
D. M. Verbeek is translated in full in vol. xxx, p. 10.

392. Mr. S. E. Bishop, of Honolulu, from observations at Strong’s
Island, latitude 5° N. and longitude 162° E., fixes September 7 at that
place, or September 6 of London reckoning, as the date when the cop-
pery sunset became visible, which, with some other data, gives him the
conclusion that this stream of smoke was progressing westward at the
rate of 64 miles per hour. J. Joly, of Dublin, from observations by
Captain Thomson, of the Medea, computes 17 and 21 miles as the
height of the column of dust seen to shoot up from Krakatoa on Au-
gust 26. (Nature, Xxx, pp. 23 and 72.)

393. Rev. Samuel Haughton gives a computation of the depression
of the sun and the height of the dust, and argues the incredibility of
certain phenomena, especially Mr. Bishop’s results. (Nature, XX1Ix, p.
470.) - |

394. A. Ringwood read before the Canterbury Philosophical Insti-
tute of New Zealand a paper on red sunsets, giving an interesting sum-
mary of previous records. (Nature, XXX, p. 301.)

_ 395. A previous eruption of Krakatoa had occurred in May, 1883;
but from a letter from Robert Leslie it appears that the remarkable
sunsets were observed still earlier by Mr. Neison at the Natal Observ-
atory, where they increased in intensity from February to June, 1883.
(Nature, Xxx, p. 463.) But the descriptions of the phenomena are not
such as to assure us that the twilight phenomena at Natal were at all
equivalent to those seen later in the year in northern latitudes.

396. Tissandier communicates to the Paris Academy a comparison
between the atmospheric conditions of 1831 and 1883. The eruptions
at Sicily in the former year were analogous to those of Krakatoa, and
were followed by corresponding optical phenomena. (Nature, XXIx, p
376.)

397. M. Gay, on June 23, read a paper to the Paris Academy on per-
sistent rain and its possible connection with recent volcanic eruptions.
METEOROLOGY. 385

He gives a comparison with the eruptions of May, 1783, in Iceland;
July, 1831, in Sicily ; Cotopaxi, in 1856; Vesuvius, 1862, and Kraka-
toa, 1883. In all of these cases similar twilight colors have been fol-
lowed by heavy rains. (Nature, Xxx, p. 229.)

398. Mr. J. Murray communicates to the Royal Society, Edinburgh,
an extensive paper on volcanic ashes and cosmic dust, showing, among
other things, that in proportion as ashes are collected at a greater dis-
tance from a volcano, so are they less rich in minerals, while the pro-
portion of vitreous matter more and more predominates. (Nature,
XXIX, p. 585.)

399. [In 1884 the twilight phenomena of 1883 were renewed, beginning
. in England about September 10, and Berlin, September 13, Vancouver’s
Island, September 30, while the records in England for 1883 were about
September 20. The maximum brightness in 1883 was about the 20th
of December, in 1884 it was later, but in general was decidedly infe-
rior and shorter than in 1883-84.]

400. M. Cornu maintains before the Paris Academy of Sciences
that the white or reddish tinted cloud-like nebulous halo or corona
that has permanently accompanied the sun during the whole of 1884,
and of which he gives many observations, probably has some connec-
tion with the Krakatoa eruption. That in fact a cloud of particles,
with a nearly uniform average diameter, was projected by the volcano,
and is held in suspension in the higher region of our atmosphere.
(Nature, Xxx, p. 556.)

401. This cloud has been observed in Dublin since November, 1883.
(Nature, Xxx, p. 663.) [It has also been observed in Washington since
about that date, with a peculiar streaky appearance, visible before sunset,
the lines being inclined to the west horizon, at an angle of about 30°
slanting down toward the south. The pink or purple tint has been
especially visible during the whole of any fair day. When the sun is
behind a cloud, and the observer examines the tints by sky between
the clouds, the purple is traceable for 30 to 40 degrees from the sun.]

402. According to A. Griitzmacher, in Das Wetter for April, 1884,
and Koéppen, in the D. M. Z., this brownish red ring about the sun ap-
pears to have first been observed in Europe at the end of November
1883, and not to have existed earlier. It is essentially different from
ordinary solar halos, and the material from which it comes must exist
beyond the highest cirrus clouds. Its explanation as a diffraction
phenomenon is undoubtedly correctly given by Kiessling. (D. IM. Z., 1,
p. 256.)

403. O. Jesse, of Steglitz, near Berlin, has endeavored to compute the
altitude of the layer of dust or mist that has hypothetically caused the
twilight phenomena of 188384. After fully explaining his theoretical
formula he applies it to observations made by himself on eight days at
Steglitz, from which he concludes an altitude of 17 kilometers. The

individual determinations range from 12 to18. These observations
properly refer to the upper limit of what von Bezold calls the first pur-
ple light, and which Jesse has observed as being the limit of the earth’s
shadow. In an appendix Jesse adds to the preceding observations,
which were taken between November 1883, and March 1884, a few
taken in the latter part of March with better apparatus, and which give
results varying between 7 and 12 kilometers, as though a decided dim-
inution had taken place in the altitude of the dust, which was great-
est in January, and least at the end of March. (D. WM. Z., I, p. 127.)

404. All the phenomena in connection with the green sun, as re-
corded in India, have been collected by Prof. C. M. Smith, of Edin-
burgh, from which he concludes that the green sun must be distin-
guished from the remarkable sunsets of 1883~84. His own view is
that there is some definite evidence to show that the phenomenon is
due to aqueous vapor, for it is not so uncommon as is generally sup-
posed. (Nature, xxx, p. 347.)

405. The Krakatoa eruption has also given rise to an interesting
series of studies into a so-called wave of pressure that seems to be
traceable from that region outward throughout the whole globe. Gen-
eral Strachey (Nature, XX1x, p. 181) seems to have first called attention
to the fact that a series of remarkable barometric fluctuations recorded
by self-registers in various parts of Europe harmonized with the hy-
pothesis that a wave of atmospheric compression, starting from Kra-
katoa and moving outward in all directions, after concentrating at the
antipodes returned to Krakatoa, making a complete circuit of the earth
in from thirty-four to thirty-seven hours; after crossing at Krakatoa,
this again made the circuit of the earth in a second period of thirty-six
hours. Four such circumnavigations are claimed by some of those who
have studied the subject; where self-recording registers are not availa-
ble, attempts have been made to utilize the automatic registers of press-
ure kept in connection with the city gas-works.

406. Rykatcheff, of St. Petersburg, from a study of all known data
on the velocity of the Krakatoa atmospheric wave, fixes it at 327.9
meters per second, corresponding to the velocity of sound at the tem-
perature of —10 C., which temperature is attained at an altitude of 4,000
meters in the atmosphere when the temperature at the earth’s surface

is +12 C., so that we may conclude that these great waves of pressure .

move with the velocity of sound. The amplitude of this wave for Euro-
pean stations was 1.3 millimeters, but it was almost twice as great,
namely 2.5, at the island of South Georgia. (Z. O. G. M., X1x, p. 431,
and Nature, xxx, p. 135.)

407. General J. T. Walker, of the India Geological Survey, gives the
results of observations of the earthquake ocean wave. (Nature, XXIx,
p- 376.)

CLIMATES OF GEOLOGICAL EPOCHS.

408. A. Belikoff and M. Rykatscheff, from a study of the anemograph
records at St. Petersburg, conclude that although one year’s record is
searcely sufficient to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the atmospheric
tide, yet there are indications of a north and south movement during
the lunar day having one maximum and one minimum, and an east and
west movement having two maxima and minima, and therefore similar
to the ocean tide. (D. I. Z., 1, p. 373.)

409. EK. Leyst has investigated the possible influence of the moon
upon the velocity of the wind as shown by the study of the St. Peters-
burg records for 1878. He finds a slightly greater velocity for the lower
culmination of the moon as compared with the upper culmination, and
again a slightly greater velocity for the six hours after the upper cul-
mination or the lower as compared with the six hours before; he finds
the influence of the moon on the velocity more regular and sometimes
greater than that of thesun. [Nothing is said as to the probable error
of the mean values as used by him, and his results are certainly very
anomalous.] (Z. O. G. IL., X1x, p. 142.)

410. Mr. B. Stewart and W. L. Carpenter communicate to the Royal
Society a report on diurnal temperature ranges at Toronto and Kew,
compared with apparent inequalities of short period in sun-spot areas.
They find that periods of 24 and 26 days in the sun-spot and tempera-
ture coincide; the solar maximum occurs eight or nine days after the
Toronto maximum, and the Kew maximum seven days after the Toronto
and one or two before the solar. [If the phenomena occur in the order
Toronto-Kew-solar, then the causal connection seems very indefinite. ]
(Wature, Xxx, p. 119.)

411. Charles Chambers, of Bombay, has investigated the relation be-
tween sun-spots and variations of the daily range of atmospheric tem-
perature; he finds the maxima of variation in daily amplitude agreeing
with the minima of sun-spots. By the same method he finds also vari-
ations parallel with the phases of the moon.

He has also compared the daily variations of magnetie declination
with the sun-spots and the moon’s phases, and finds an agreement be-
tween them. He also finds a very large periodicity in declination coin-
cident with the revolution of the planet Mereury about the Sun. In
most cases the amplitude of the above parallel variations seems too
small to be real, but in the case of Mercury the amplitude is quite
large. (Z. O. G. M., xIx, p. 226.)

412. J. Lizuar states that while the variation of the declination of the
magnetic needle with sun-spots has been recognized for some time, yet
so far as he knows, the other magnetic elements have not been com-

pared; he therefore compares the horizontal intensity, the vertical in-
388 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

tensity, total intensity, and dip at St. Petersburg with the sun-spots
and shows that all have a parallelism. (Z. 0. @. M., x1x, p. 415.)

413. Prof. W. Foérster has investigated the periodical changes in the
azimuth and level of the fundamental bed of masonry established in the
Berlin Observatory for the support of the meridian instruments. He
concludes from the study of 42 years of observations as follows :

1. Neither the permanent nor the periodical changes show any de-
pendence on the water or moisture in the earth.

2. Those movements that are certainly separated from small move
ments in the instrument itself and are plainly to be considered as
movements of the whole pier, go through a distinct annual and an 11-
year period, and both have a thermal character.

3. The thermal effect corresponds to a rise of temperature or solar
radiation at the time of the sun-spot maxima.

4, These observations have a general interest, and not purely local.
Professor Forster shows that they depend not on lo¢al temperatures of
the air, but on the intensity of solar radiation of which the disturbance
of the pier is a sort of summation. He has therefore lately sunk three
thermometers into his pier in order to understand better its internal
temperature.

414. [If we couple Forster’s investigation with that of Dr. B. A.
Gould into similar motions throughout the world, we should conclude
that these changes take place not in the pier but in the ground on
which the observatory stands; but this seems impossible in the case
of Berlin, where the observatory is surrounded by trees and buildings.
The fact that greater solar heat is radiated at times of sun-spot maxi-
mum was clearly shown by the present writer’s study of temperatures
observed on the Hohenpeissenberg. (Amer. Jour. Sci., 1869.)]

415. A similar investigation on the movements of the pillars of the
observatory at Neuchatel, 1859 to 1881, has been made by Hirsch and
Faye, showing the same periodical and irregular variations as at Ber-
lin. (Nature, XXvut, p. 216.)

416. Prof. Paul Reis has made an exhaustive study of the high and
low waters of the Rhine in connection with the question of a possible
sun-spot periodicity. With regard to the floods he finds maxima agree-
ing with the principal maxima of sun-spots as given by Wolf’s relative
numbers, and concludes that there is very nearly a period of 110 years,
which is twice Fritz’s 55-year period, and ten times Wolf’s sun-spot
period, and which, therefore, would be 111 years. This conclusion,
based upon observations since 1705, is confirmed by the records of high
waters running back as far as the year 14 B. C. He, of course, main-
tains that the cause of the overflows is cosmic or extra-terrestrial.
Dividing his high waters into four classes, he finds that the prediction
of a high water of the first class can be made with greater certainty
than a weather prediction. (Z. O. G. M., XVI, p. 261.)

417. Lieut. v.d. Groeben, of the Engineer Corps in Berlin, endeavors
METEOROLOGY. 389

to elucidate the connection between the sun-spors and rainfall by a
study of the hydraulics and physics of the Mississippi River, as given
in the work of Humphreys and Abbot, together with more recent data,
and offers the following conclusions: From the observed discharge of
the Mississippi since 1819 there follows neither a confirmation nor a
refutal of Meldrum’s law, according to which there should be heavier
rainfall at the time of the sun-spot maxima and slight rainfall «at the
time of the minima. On the other band, from the magnitude and ir-
regularity of the variations in the discharge compared with the period-
ical influence which in favorable cases should have been expected
according to Meldrum’s law, we may safely conclude that in the Missis-
sippi watershed influences of this regular form are completely obscured
by the incomparably greater effect of apparentiy irregular variations
of wind and weather. If, however, this is our result for the Mississippi
in spite of the magnitude of the area represented by it and in spiteof the
relative simplicity in the form of the North American continent, then it
‘follows that a compensation of the disturbing influences by the aceumu-
lation of a larger number of observations from all parts of the earth is in
general not probable and that it is therefore to be recommended that
the further investigation of the subject be based not upon an empirical
accumulation of observations but rather upon a more careful, intelligent
seleetion. ‘In this selection the principal circumstances to be attended
to are as follows: A constant direction of the wind through a whole
year or at least during the greater part of the year; when possible, such
a position of the area of observation that this wind shall be from the
ocean; the greatest imaginable simplicity of topographic contour. If
from the observations that have so far been discussed we separate those
that correspond to this point of view, then from them almost without
exception can be deduced a confirmation of Meldrum’s law.

If we go still further and inquire into the possible reason of the paral-
lelism between sun-spot frequency and precipitation, or, what is almost
the same, between sun-spot activity and radiation of solar heat, it would
then appear as if a comparison of sun-spot phenomena with the period-
ical geyser eruptions would give not only a credible answer to this ques-
tion, but also would be proper to give information on many other prob-
lematic phenomena observed on the sun-spots. According to the results
of these comparisons the sun spots are nothing else than the external
evidences of the peculiar process of cooling on the sun, which goes on
in such a way that hot masses periodically come from the interior to the
surface, and in this way the loss of heat caused by radiation must from
time to time be always renewed; and in this way these comparisons ac-
quire still another special interest, for they appear to present a solution
of the problem of the conservation of solar energy that leaves nothing
to be desired in the way of simplicity, of course with the important res-
ervation that this conservation of energy can only be a temporary state
of transition. (ZO. G. M., x1x, p. 1.)

418. Prof. William Ferrel has investigated the effect of uprising cur-
rents upon the atmospheric pressure both in his original memoir of 1857
and in his later ewargement of the same published as Meteorological
Researches by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. In the
third part of these Researches he gives a hypsometric formula in which
the terms depending on the movements of the atmosphere are introduced,
but, as he himself shows, these can only be appreciable in most extreme
eases. In other respects, however, his formula also represents our latest
knowledge on the subject of the attraction of the earth and the effect
of atmospheric moisture. (Z. O. G. M., X1x, p. 466.)

419. [The formula given by Upton in his method of reducing the ba-
rometer to sea-level (Ann. Rep. Chief Signal Officer, 1882) introduces
some new values of numerical coefficients which, if combined with the
improvements made by Ferrel, give us a formula more painfully exact
than that of Riihlmann, but the practical value of these in ordinary hyp-
sometry is, of course, limited by the accuracy with which we can ascer-
tain the true average temperature of the air.|

420. Paul Schreiber has published the second edition of his Hand-
Book of Barometric Hypsometry. This work has been for some years
by far the best general guide to those who wish to derive the best re-
sults attainable by the use of the mercurial or aneroid barometer. The
author neglects certain refinements relative to the effect of aqueous
vapor, but for general use his work is highly to be recommended. Of
course, those having a large number of stations at their disposal may
prefer to work out special methods, as has been done by Mr. G. K. Gil-
bert for the use of the United States Geological Survey, but it is not
yet certain that’ they will obtain results of much greater accuracy.

421. R. Hult has discussed the mass of phenological observations
accumulated for the last 10 years in Sweden. One hundred and fifty-
seven stations have afforded about 150,000 observations. The previous
labors of the French botanist, Adamson, had shown that the develop-
ment of the buds is determined by the sum of the daily mean tempera-
tures since the beginning of the year. Boussingault had, however,
shown that the temperature during the period of rest from growth need
not be taken into consideration, and that the length of the growing
period is therefore inversely proportional to its mean temperature.
Linsser concluded that the sums of the temperatures above zero which
are necessary to effect development of a plant at any two localities are
in direct ratio to the sums of all temperatures at both stations above
zero. J. Sachs, the ablest botanical physiologist of the present time,
has studied the subject from an entirely different side. He has by di-
rect experiment with different plants determined the influence of tem-
perature on the development and growth, and found that for each ar-
rangement of external conditions about any plant there is a minimum,
a best, and a maximum temperature. Thatis to say, a certain amount
of heat is necessary, namely, the temperature minimum ; an increase of
METEOROLOGY. 391

temperature accelerates the development up to acertain limit, which is
the best temperature; every increase above this retards the develop-
ment up to a certain limit, which is the maximum possible, beyond which
the growth of the plant must cease.

The results attained by Hult do not entirely agree with any of the
preceding. He finds that the precipitation in Sweden is nowhere so
slight that vegetation is regularly restricted, nowhere so great that
the blossoming or leafing is disturbed, but the ripening of the fruit
occurs at the season of greatest rainfall, and this stage of plant growth
is affected by the rain. The blossoming of any plant throughout the
whole of Sweden occurs at the same temperature, but when we pass to
Lapland and Jempland, the very rapid progress of the spring tempera-
ture cannot be followed by the plant, and the blossoming occurs subse-
quent to the occurrence of the normal temperature. (Z. 0. G.M., x1x,
p. 139.)

422, A. Spamer communicates the following conclusions as to the de.
pendence of the growth of wood upcn meteorological factors :

1. Temperature and precipitation are the meteorological phenomens
that affect the process of the formation of wood.

2. Of these two variable quantities during the principal period of
growth, the rainfall diminishes the formation of wood while the heat
increases it.

3. The principal period of wood growth is from July to October, at
least for the plants which are very sensitive to frost.

4. The rainfall seems to influence growth more than the temperature.
[Excess of rain diminishes growth more than excess of temperature in-
creases it.|

5. The growth of different plants is not affected in the same degree
by the rain; some are affected more by rain and others by the tem-
perature.

6. In many periods only one of these factors appear to exert any in-
fluence, the other being inactive.

7. Possibly this anomaly may be explained by observations of the
duration of insolation. ;

8. The increase of carbonaceous compounds goes parallel with the in-
crease in the inorganic constituents of the wood.

9. The aqueous component of the wood diminishes when the carbon-
aceous increases.

10. The so-called ripe wood [the heartwood] differs from that which
is less ripe by a greater amount of ashes and carbon. (Z. 0. G. IL,
MIX, p: 93.)

423. M. Bergmans, of Flushing, has studied the difference between
sea and continental climates as shown by the vegetation, especially by
a Study of the plants ordinarily cultivated in the temperate zone. He
finds that the difference in vegetation is due not to the difference in
mean temperature but to the difference in the amount of sunshine; clear
392 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

skies and full sunshine means high midday temperature and low tem-
peratures or frosts at night time ; high temperatures in the sammer and
low temperatures in the winter. These extreme variations in tempera.
ture decide whether any given plant can thrive or not. The actual de-
velopment of the plant depends upon the action of sunlight. (Nature,
XXX, p. 092.)

424. W. O. Atwater offers experiments to show that certain plants
grown under natural conditions do directly assimilate the atmospheric
nitrogen.

425. | Although the amount of this assimilation is not at present suffi-

cient to be of any importance to meteorology, yet the establishment of
this fact, which has been controverted by so many eminent chemists,
would be of importance in studying the climates of past geological
epochs, when other plants and other gases were present.|] (Nature, Xxx,
p. 593.)
. 426. C. Ferrari has published in the Agricultural Annals.for 1883-a
comparison for Italy between the statistics of harvests and the meteor-
ological phenomena. He deduces a number of practical rules, such as
the more rain we have in summer the greater the harvest of corn; but
for wheat, rye, and other grains great rain frequency is injurious, and
the harvest is greater as the temperature is higher and the cloudiness
less.

427. Prof. H. Hoffmann, communicating the result of the most recent
observations on the thermal constant of vegetation, compares the fig-
ures for a number of plants for Upsala and Giessen, and concludes that
the results agree quite as closely as can be expected, showing that there
is no change in the constant depending on latitude or climate. (D. M.
Zi, 1.5, ANT.) | |

428. General Strachey has endeavored to establish a simple method
of computing the quantity of heat received at any place and proper to
use as a standard for comparison with the progress of vegetation. - Ree-
ognizing the fact that it is not the absolute temperature that should be
summed up from day to day for this purpose, but that it is the excess
above a definite minimum and that below this minimum active vegeta-
tive processes are not possible, General Strachey has endeavored to es-
tablish the minimum limit and to devise convenient methods for sum-
ming up the excess above it. Numerical tables are given to assist the
computation. By assuming 42° F. a base temperature, it results that
a very close approximation is given by simply subtracting. this figure
from the true mean temperature on each pentade and summing the re-
mainders. (Z. O. G. M., X1x, p. 425.)

429. {In studies looking to the prediction of hatching of locust”
eggs (see Reports of the United States Entomological Commission) the
present writer used 50° F, as a minimum limit for the development of
the eggs. |

430. Dr. A. Frankel gives an account of experiments on the influence
METEOROLOGY. 393

‘

of rarefied atmosphere upon the animal system. He concludes that the
rarefaction influences the metastasis by depriving the blood and the
tissues of some of their necessary oxygen, and that this want of oxygen
entails an excessive destruction of albumen, the constituents of which
are in part deposited as fat. (Nature, xxvu, p. 191.)

431. S. A. Hill, of India, has investigated the connection between
statistics of death and crime and the variations of the weather in that
country. He finds that a mere rise of temperature has comparatively
little effect and the effect of varying humidity is still less, while the va-
riations of diurnal range in temperature are quite appreciable. The
most prevalent fatal diseases are the malarial fevers, and these are
doubtless increased by the rainfall, so that dry years are healthy and
wet ones unhealthy. Crimes of violence in India may be said to be
proportional in frequency to the tendency to prickly heat; that excru-
ciating condition of the skin induced by a hightemperature combined
with moisture. (Nature, XXIX, p. 338.)

432. N. Alcock discusses the effect of climate on the color of the hu-
man skin, and maintains that the effect of great sunshine upon the pig-
ment is to intensify the skin color and cause the intense blackness of
the races that live in the tropical regions where the chemical power is
intense for a vertical sun. (Nature, Xxx, p. 401.)

433. The glaciers of the Straits of Magellan are described by W. J. L.
Wharton (Nature, xxx, p. 177), who has made measures upon their
dimensions and movements.

434. Prof. F. Simony, in a study of the glacial formation of the Karls-
Icefield, the largest glacier in the Austrian Alps, finds that during the’
last thirty years a steady diminution has taken place in the average
quantity of ice, and at the present rate only twelve or fifteen years more
will be required to bring it back to the minimum condition which local
report said it had attained some three hundred years ago. It would
seem, then, proper to assume that long prevailing secular changes in
climate take place that are best shown by such phenomena as the
glacier changes of corresponding long periods. (Z. O. G@. M., XIX, p.
127.)

435. W. R. Browne presented to the Royal Society in 1882 a very
suggestive paper on the causes of glacial motion, which however seems
not to have been printed until a year after, and which should be read
in connection with the following. (Natwre, XXVUI, p. 235.)

436. A. Irving, in a paper on the mechanies of glaciers, states that
there is as yet no explanation of the fact that the movement is greater
by day than by night and greater in the summer than in the winter.
This he attributes to the fact that the solar rays entering into the inte-
rior of the glacier are there transformed into heat and melt the ice, whose
variations have thus a daily and annual period. (Natwre, XXVII, p.
553.)

487. Dr. R. von Lendenfeld has made a survey and study of the gla-
394 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884,

ciers of New Zealand, showing that the present glaciers are as large
and extend to as low levels as those in Norway, while the mean temper-
ature of New Zealand is 11° C., as compared with 3° in Norway. The
cause of this glaciation is considered to be the greater humidity of air
and more copious rain and snow of New Zealand, due to the greater
expanse of water in the southern hemisphere. The author considers
that the glacial period in New Zealand, during which the sounds in the
southwest coast were scooped and not filled up with débris but since
which time the present small rapidly increasing alluvial deposits have
all accumulated, must therefore have been very recent. [A greater
expanse of water in the northern hemisphere with a north polar conti-
nent would similarly give us higher temperatures and heavier gla-
ciers. (WVature, XXX, p. 651.)

438. E. Hill, of Cambridge, England, has given a mathematical in-
vestigation of the effect of fluctuations of solar heat and terrestrial ra-
diation upon terrestrial temperatures, and especially upon the glacial
epoch. He shows that the temperatures of the continents are now lower
under the present periodical change from day to night and from sum-
mer to winter than they would be if precisely the same quantity of heat
were communicated to them continuously and uniformly. The same is
also shown for the ocean; periodical changes in the transmitted heat
increase the evaporation but diminish the radiation. An increase in
the amplitudes of these heat variations will exaggerate the increase or
diminution of the mean values of evaporation, &c. An increase in the
eccentricity of the earth’s orbit exaggerates these amplitudes, and there-
fore lowers the mean annual temperature in the one hemisphere and in-
creases it in the other, also increasing the evaporation in the one hemi-
sphere and diminishing it in the other. Increased evaporation may
increase the snowfall. This is, therefore, possibly appreciable in con-
néction with the glacial epoch as discussed by Hill in the Geological
Magazine, November, 1881. (Z. 0. G. M., XIX, p. 260.)

439. W. F. Stanley maintains the improbability of the theory that
former glacial periods in the northern hemisphere were due to eccen-
tricity of the earth’s orbit and to its winter perihelion. He quotes Fer-
rel and Hann to show that the mean temperature of the southern hem-
isphere is now equal to if not higher than the northern, although the
northern is the most glaciated, so that, whatever may be the relative po-
sition of the earth’s orbit and axis, it could have no more influence than
now prevails. He explains glaciation as a local phenomenon, dependent
upon the distribution of land and water and attending changes in aerial
and oceanic currents. (Nature, Xxx, p. 526.)

440. A. Blytt, by the study of the distribution of the plants of Scan-
dinavia at the present time and at the time of the formation of the peat-
bogs, concludes that since the glacial epoch the climate has experienced
periodical changes, in that dry continental periods have interchanged
with moistinsular climates. These periodical climatic changes he traces
METEOROLOGY. 395

back to periodic variations in the temperature of the sea. He concludes
that when the winter agrees with the earth’s aphelion the currents will
probably increase, and when the winter agrees with the perihelion the
currents will slightly diminish ; therefore at present northwestern Eu-
rope is enjoying relatively gentle rains and a large difference between
the winter and summer temperatures, which conditions will be reversed
in about 10,000 years with the change in position of the earth’s axis.
In other regions than Europe the effect of this change may be different.
Thus the eastern part of North America will, with wirter in the aphel-
ion, have stronger northwest winds, and therefore a more severe climates
the same for Eastern Asia, while the western coast of North America
will be affected like Europe. But such changes must also affect other
portions of the ocean and of the world, causing periodic changes in the
climate over the whole earth’s surface. (Z. O. G. AL, x1x, p. 413.)

441. Dr. Penck, of Munich, in some remarks on the glacial epoch, says
a numerical expression for the difference between the climate of the
glacial epoch and that immediately before and after it is found by a
comparison of the limit of perpetual snow for that and the present
epoch. This limit was at that time decidedly lower than the present,
namely, at 45° N. latitude 1,300 meters lower, and at 26° N. latitude, 1,000
lower. In the southern hemisphere the probable depression of the
snow limit at 30° S. was 1,000 meters, and at 45° S. at least 800 meters
lower than now. During the glacial epoch the region of perpetual snow
in the northern hemisphere was lower than it is to-day in the southern,
and in the southern it was much lower than now. An interchange of
the climatic relations of the north and south hemispheres would not of
itself produce a glacial epoch. The remarkable agreement between the
intensity of the present glaciation and that of the glacial epoch justifies
the assumption that the latter occurred under general external relations
such as now prevail; in fact, it can be proven that the glacial epoch
occurred during the present arrangement of land and water, and not
with a lower but rather a higher elevation of the land. The mass of
sea water that was at that time on the land in the shape of ice was
approximately 56,000,000 cubic kilometers. A characteristic of the gla-
cial epoch, the recurrence of the glaciation as recognized in northern
Europe and America, and which repetitions, as the Alps show, were
separated by epochs of mild climate whose durations were greater than
the time that has now elapsed since the iast glaciation. The great ex-
tent of the glaciation is explained by no other theories as to its cause
except Croll’s theory of the alternate glaciation of both hemispheres,
and the theory of the existence of a sensible cold period over the whole
earth; but the periodicity of glaciation is explained only by Croll’s
theory, so that this is the most probable, although great difficulties
stand in its way. (D. M. Z., 1, p. 473.)

PHYSICS.

By GEORGE F. BARKER, M. D.,
Professor of Physics in the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia,

GENERAL.

The address of Lord Rayleigh, president of the British Association,
at the Montreal meeting, reviewed very ably the recent progress of
physical science. One of the most striking advances is in the produe-
tion and application of electricity upon a large scale, the reaction of
which upon the advancement of pure science has been most salutary.
The electro-magnetic rotation of the polarized ray, which Faraday used
the most refined means to detect, can now be produced through 180° ;
the question of magnetic saturation, in the hands of Joule a purely sci-
entific one, is now a fundamental one in every dynamo machine. The
laws of alternating currents show some curious modifications by indue-
tion in powerful machines. Suppose an electro-magnet wound with
two parallel wires, through one of which an alternating current passes
and develops a certain amount of heat in the circuit. If now the sec-
ond wire receive the current, it would at first be supposed that the heat
effect would be doubled. In fact, however, the total current, since it
is governed by the self-induction of the circuit, would not be increased
at all; and hence the heating effect would be actually halved in the
doubled conductor. On the question of electric standards, Lord Ray-
leigh mentions his own measurements of the Clark cell as 1.435 theo-
retical volts, and of the electro-chemical equivalent of silver, 4.025
grams per ampere-hour, as closely according with that of Kohlrausch.
Another direction of marked progress is in thermo-dynamics. Some
confusion has arisen in consequence of applying the first law too rigidly,
unmodified by the second. The latter teaches that the real value of
heat as a source of mechanical power depends upon the temperature of
the body in which it resides. Every change, chemical, thermal, or me-
chanical, which takes place or can take place in nature does so at the
cost of a certain amount of available energy. If, therefore, we wish to
inquire whether or not a proposed transformation can take place, the
question to be considered is whether its occurrence would involve dissi
pation of energy. If not, the transformation is absolutely excluded

The fraction of the total energy which can be converted into work, ac-
cording to the second law, depends on the difference of the initial and
final temperatures. In optics, Cornu’s ingenious application of Dop-
pler’s principle to determine whether a spectrum line is solar or terres-
trial in origin is mentioned. An image of the sun is thrown on the
slit of the spectroscope and caused to vibrate two or three times a sec-
ond, so that the light enterjng the instrument comes alternately from
the advancing and the retreating edge. Since the line, if solar, suffers
in this way alternate displacements, it appears to tremble, while if ter-
restrial it appears fixed. In acoustics the curious fact is stated that
while when a pure note, such as that of a tuning-fork, is sounded, we
cannot tell whether the sound comes to us from in front or from behind,
when any other sort of sound is produced, from a clap of the hand to
the clearest vowel sound, the discrimination is not only possible but
easy and instinctive. The address concludes with a discussion of the
importance of experimental science in a system of education. (Nature,
August, 1834, xxx, 410-417.)

As president of the mathematical and physical section, Sir William
Thomson gave an address entitled “Steps toward a kinetic theory of
matter,” in which, after giving a résumé of the kinetic theory of gases,
and discussing especially the theory of the repulsive action between
molecules in collision, he takes up the question of elasticity and shows
that any ideal system of material particles acting on one another mu-
tually theough massless connecting springs, may be perfectly imitated
in a model consisting of rigid links jointed together, and having rapidly
rotating fly-wheels pivoted on some or on all of the links. He figures
two systems, each consisting of two hooked rods, connected in the first
to an elliptical spring, and in the second to the opposite corners of a
square frame loosely articulated, upon each of the sides of which, as
an axis, is a fly-wheel or gyrostat in rapid rotation. If either of these
systems be hung up by the hook on one of its projecting rods, and a
weight be placed on the hook on the other rod, the weight when first
put on will oscillate up and down, and will go on doing so forever if the
system be absolutely unfrictional. Thus, out of matter possessing ri-
gidity, but absolutely devoid of elasticity, a perfect model of a spring
has been made in the form of a spring-balance. (Nature, August, 1884,
xxx, 417-421.)

The second and third volumes of the “ Travaux et Mémoires” of the
Bureau International des Poids et Mesures have been published during
1883 and 1884, the first volume having appeared in 1881. The second
volume contains papers by Dr. Benoit on his expansion experiments,
by M. Marek on the methods and results of the weighings made at the
bureau from 1879 to 1881, and by Dr. Broch, the director, on the ex-
pansion of mercury. The third volume contains an account of the modes
of comparison of the standards, with descriptions of the apparatus used
and a complete statement of the observations and the methods of their
PHYSICS. 435

reduction; a careful account by M. Marek of the excellent normal ba-
rometer and cathetometer in use at the bureau, and a description of the
methods of calibrating the thermometers used during the weighings;
and illustrations of the specific gravity apparatus, and of the method
of Stas for clearing the surfaces of metals by a jet of alcohol vapor.
Besides these memoirs, the International Committee publishes reports
to the Governments represented, of which the seventh appeared in 1884.
Great Britain has now a representative on this committee. (Nature,
April, xx1x, 529; October, 1884, xxx, 612. Science, 11, 305, March,
1884.)

Herschel has given a short method of converting yards into meters,
and the converse, based upon the ratio of the meter to the yard ob-
tained by W. A. Rogers, in his comparisons of the “ métre des archives”
with thestandard yard. This ratio, which is 39.57027 : 36, agrees with the
simpler one, 35:32, very closely, the error being only 1 part in 8,000. Her-
schel’s rule is as follows: To convert yards into meters, subtragt one-
tenth and add one-seventh of that tenth. If great accuracy be required,
add one one-hundred-and-thirtieth of that seventh. The result is ac-
curate to the sixth decimal place. To convert meters into yards, add
one-tenth, subtract one-sixteenth of that tenth, two one-hundredths of
that sixteenth, and one-twentieth of that two one-hundredths. The error_
is less than 5 inches in the kilometer, or less than 2 decimeters in the
mile. (Nature, July, 1884, xxx, 312.)

Johnstone Stoney has called attention to the fact that Clarke’s deter-
mination of the yard in metrical units differs from Kater’s by more than
the difference between Clarke’s and the simple value 914.4 millimeters
for the yard. Hence the yard may be assumed to have this value, with
an error of less than a fifth metret (10-°) in the meter. So the pound
may be assumed as 453.6 grams, with an error of one-fourth of a grain
avoirdupois, on the authority of Professor Miller; and the gallon may
be considered as 4,544 cubic centimeters, with an error of less than one
cubic centimeter in 10 liters. (Nature, January, 1884, xx1x, 278.)

Rowland has proposed to construct scales with his ruling-engine, which
will enable the physicist at any time, by purely optical means, and
without knowing the coefficient of expansion of the metal or its temper-
ature, to obtain the value of the length of the scale in terms of the wave-
length of any given ray of light. These scales are simply to be straight
pieces of speculum metal, ruled with lines just like an ordinary grating,
except that the length of the lines is to be only about one centimeter,
every one-hundredth line being somewhat longer than its neighbors; the
whole ruled slip is to be one decimeter in length. From the manner of
ruling it will be easy to count the whole number of lines in the length
of the strip, and then, by a simple use of the scale asa grating in a
suitable spectrometer, the whole length may be immediately found at
any time, in terms of any specified wave-length of light. (Science, Sep-
tember, 1854, ry, 496; Nature, October, 1884, xxx, 596.)

F. J. Smith has described a new transmitting dynamometer or ergom-
eter, as he calls it, which resembles the early dynamometer of Morin
in having two pulleys, the angular advance of one being regulated by
aspring. In the Morin instrument, however, an extended piece of steel
formed the spring; and in the modified form of it proposed by Ayrton
and Perry spiral springs were used. In the latter form the springs are
liable to fly out by centrifugal force, and, moreover, a special optical
arrangement is required for reading the angular advance. In Smith’s
ergometer there is no tendency in the spring to fly, and the tension is
read directly upon a dial. (Nature, July, 1884, xxx, 220.)

Brackett has devised a dynamometer especially adapted for measur-
ing the energy expended on a dynamo-machine. The machine to be
tested is so supported that it can turn freely through a small are of a
circle, the center of whichis in the armature axis. When the armature
is rotated, the circuit being closed, a mechanical couple is set up be-
tween this armature and the field magnets, which tends to make the
latter revolve in the same direction as the armature. The value of this
couple is ascertained by measuring the value of the equal and opposite
couple required to maintain equilibrium. This is done by means of a
lever-arm fixed to the machine or cradle, provided with a sliding weight
sufficient to maintain the machine at zero. The length of the lever-arm
and weight being known, it is necessary to know only the number of
revolutions in order to calculate the energy. If W denote the weight,
L the lever-arm, and 2 the number of revolutions in a minute, the en-
ergy expended will be represented by 2xLWn. (Am. d. Sci., January,
1884, III, xxvu, 20.)

Boltzmann, by means of Carnot’s principle and the theory of proba-
bilities, has calculated the energy developed in chemical combination,
considering only the cases where the substances are gaseous both before
and after the reaction, and where the diatomic molecules dissociate into
atoms of the same kind. Assuming that the heat of dissociation is in-
dependent of the temperature, the formula gives as the number of ca-
lories (gram-degrees) required for the dissociation of one gram of nitro-
gen tetroxide, 151.3; and of iodine vapor, 112.5. (Ber. Ak. Wien, 1884,
18t; J. Phys., Il, 111, 274, June, 1884.)

Sir William Thomson described at Montreal a gyrostatic balance for
measuring the vertical component of the earth’s rotation, which con-
sisted of a gyrostat supported on knife-edges attached to its containing-
case, with their line perpendicular to the axis of the interior fly- wheel,
and above the center of gravity of the fly-wheel and frame-work, by an
exceedingly small height when the frame-work is held with the axis of
the fly-wheel and the line of the knife-edges both horizontal, and the
knife-edges downward in proper position for performing their function.
The apparatus, when supported on its knife-edges, with the fly-wheel
not spinning, may be dealt with as the beam of an ordinary balance.
Let now the frame-work bear two small knife-edges or knife-edged holes,
like those of the beam of an ordinary balance, giving bearing-points
PHYSICS. 437

for weights in a line cutting the line of the knife-edges as nearly as
possible, and of course approximately perpendicular to this line, and,
for convenience of putting on and off weights, hang, as in an ordinary bal-
ance, two very light pans, by hooks, on these edges, in the usual way.
Now, with the fly-wheel not running, adjust, by weights in the pans, if
necessary, So that the frame-work rests in equilibrium in acertain marked
position, with the axis of rotation inclined slightly to the horizontal, in
order that the axis of the fly-wheel, whether spinning or at rest, may
always slip down so as to press.on one and not on the other of the two
end plates belonging to its two ends. Now unhook the pans and take
away the gyrostat and spin it, replace it on its knife-edges, hang on the
two pans, aud find the weight required to balance it in the marked posi-
tion, with the fly-wheel now rotating rapidly. This weight gives an
accurate measure of the vertical component of the earth’s rotation.
(Nature, September, 1884, xxx, 524.)

Respighi has made a series of experiments at the Roman Observatory
in order to determine the intensity of gravity. For this purpose he
used a pendulum composed of a sphere of lead 0.11698 meter and weigh-
ing 9.43515 kilograms, suspended toa steel wire varying in length in
the different experiments from 5 to 7.8 meters. The total weight of the
wire and the other accessories was only ;}; of the weight of the lead
sphere. A correction of 3.4™" was, however, necessary, in consequence
of the rigidity of the wire, between the length of the actual pendulum
and that of the equivalent simple pendulum. The oscillations were
determined by the method of coincidences, a mercury surface being
raised at the proper time until a point attached to the pendulum made
contact with it at each oscillation, and made an electro-chronographic
record. The results gave for the value of the seconds pendulum
0.9934891 meter, and for the value of g 9.805343 meters. These figures
differ by only the zo55 part of their value from those calculated by
Biot—9.9933380 and 9.803851. (Atti Acc. Lineei, III, x11, 346; J. Phys.,
February, 1884, II, 111, 95.) ;

An article by Hall upon inertia has called out replies from Hastings,
Mendenhall, and others. Hastings says that the difficulty in the correct
use of the word arises from the fact that it has been used in two perfectly
legitimate senses—one qualitative, the other quantitative. In the qual-
itative sense it simply implies the truth of Newton’s first law of motion;
in the quantitative sense it is mass and nothing else. On account of
this ambiguity all careful writers and teachers have long since practi-
cally abandoned it. (Science, 111, 482, 559, April, May, 1884.)

MECHANICS.

1. Of Solids.

Dobbie and Hutcheson have described an apparatus fur the rapid de-
termination of the specific gravity of sclids, founded on the measure-
ment of the volume of water displaced. It consists of a U-tube, one
438 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

limb of which is about 5" in diameter and somewhat longer than the
other, which is mucléla rger, and closed at the top by means of a movable
piece of tube of the same size, carrying a stop-cock and attached by a
rubber band. The small tube is graduated into cubic centimeters above
a point on the same level as one of several lines drawn on the larger tube.
To make an observation the tube is filled up with water to one of these
lines and the substance whose specific gravity is required is dropped in
the larger limb. Of course if it sinks it displaces its own volume of
water, and by blowing through the stop-cock the level of the water is
depressed below the original mark. It is then allowed to rise again
slowly until the surface reaches the line at which it stood before the
solid was introduced. By reading the buik of the water displaced in
the smaller tube, which may be done with much accuracy, and by di-
viding the weight of the body previously ascertained by this number,
the specific gravity is obtained. (Phil. Mag., V, xv11, 459, June, 1884.)

Belli has observed that if two glass plates be made to adhere by ap-
plying them exactly to one another, and are then left so that gravity
acts upon them, they always separate, no matter how small may be the
weight of the one united to the other by adhesion. Obviously molecular
attraction cannot be the cause of this phenomenon. The long duration
of the adhesion arises simply from the slowness with which air pene-
trates between the plates. Stefan has come to the same conclusion
from a mathematical investigation. (Jl Nuovo Cimento, x11, 34; J.
Phys., December, 1884, II, 111, 552.)

Turpin and Warrington have repeated Bottomley’s experiment of cut-
ting through a block of ice by means of a wire having weights attached
to its ends, with a view of noting the effect of varying conditions. Bot-
tomley had observed that string would not cut through the ice, and ex-
plained the fact by supposing that the string is not a sufficiently good
conductor to relieve itself of the cold in front and pass it’ back to the
water behind. To test the effect of conductivity, wires of silver, copper,
brass, iron, and German. silver, 0.67™" diameter, were employed, each
carrying 2.5 pounds. The results show that the time increases as the
conductivity decreases. In a second experiment the wire was of iron, .
and was loaded in the first case with 5 pounds, in the second with 74,
and in the third with 124 pounds. It was found that the time taken
was approximately inversely proportional to the load. Pfaff’s experi-
ment of placing a tube upright on a block of ice, pressing it down by a
weighted lever, while maintaining it at 0° by surrounding it with snow,
was then repeated, using tubes of copper, brass, lead, and glass, each
about a foot long and of three-eighths inch bore, the weight being
2pounds. In four hours the copper tube had penetrated 100™™, the brass
tube 35", the lead tube 7™" and the glass tube 3™; showing con-
clusively that when the temperature is not lower than 0° C. the chief
factor is the lowering of the freezing point by pressure, and not the plas-
ticity of ice. If the result takes place below 0°, as Pfaff states, the
PHYSICS. 439

explanation is not easy without admitting a certain amount of plasticity
inice. (Phil. Mag., August, 1884, V, xvu1, 120.)

Krouchkoll has-noticed that perfectly clean platinum readily amal-
gamates with mercury, but that aluminum and iron do not. On at-
tempting to unite mercury with a scraped surface of aluminum, this
metal oxidizes with great facility. If, however, the aluminum be made
the negative electrode in acidulated water, this metal becomes strongly
charged with hydrogen; and now if it be dipped into mercury at the
bottom of the vessel, it unites with it instantly. On exposure to the air
it is tarnished at once. A wire of iron acts in the same way. The au-
thor suggests that the action of sodium in facilitating amalgamation is
due to its reducing action. (J. Phys., March, 1884, I, 111, 139.)

2. Of Liquids.

E. Wiedemann has calculated, from certain experiments made by Ber-
thelot, that the force necessary to separate two adjacent layers of water
cannot be less than 55 atmospheres. (J. Phys., December, 1854, II, 111,
555.)

Reinold and Riicker have continued their studies on liquid films, and
have observed that the disturbing action of the electric current, previ-
ously noticed, is due to the transference of liquid by this current in its
own direction, thus thinning the film, or the reverse, according to the di-
rection. By forming a plane film between two horizontal wires, illumi-
nating it by the calcium light and projecting its image on a screen, the
authors showed the motions of the bands of color in the direction of the
current. (Nature, December, 1884, xxx1, 186.)

Schitf has determined with care the capillary constant of a large
number of liquids at their boiling points. For this purpose he used two
capillary glass tubes, one 1.5"" in the bore, the other half as much, con-
nected so as to form the legs of aU tube. This tube, after being filled
with the experimental liquid, is hung in a wider vessel, at the bottom of
which a little of the liquid is kept boiling. From the difference in level
of the liquid in these two connected capillary tubes, as measured ata
temperature which must be very nearly the boiling point, the surface
tension at that temperature is readily deduced. ‘To this surface ten-
sion, in milligrams per millimeter, divided by the’ relative molecular
weight (and multiplied for convenience by 1,000), Schiff assigns the
symbol N. He illustrates its significance by pointing out that in the
case of a capillary elevation against a vertical wall wetted by the liquid,
it represents the number of molecules raised above the free surface per
unit length of the wall. The results obtained show that not only is
this number N the same for isomeric substances, but that it is often the
same for liquids of very different chemical constitution, and that it is
possible to replace a certain number of atoms of one kind by a certain
number of another kind, without producing in the value of N an alter-
ation which comes within the limit of precise observation. In these
440 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

replacements C = 2H, O= 3H, and Cl = 7H; so that from the formula
of a body the value of N can be deduced, and thus the surface tension
at the boiling point calculated. (Liebig’s Annalen, March, 1884, cCXxI11,
47; Nature, October, 1884, xxx, 618.)

Krouchkoll has observed that isolating liquids, such as carbon disul-
phide, ether, and turpentine, not miscible with water, acquire a conduc-
tivity when in contact with this liquid. He then made an investiga-
tion to ascertain whether the capillary constant at the surface of con-
tact between one of these liquids and water varied under the action of
an electro-motive force. The results of his experiments prove that
this variation actually takes place, and that it is in the same direction
as in the case of the surface of separation between water and mercury.
(J. Phys., 11, m1, 303, July, 1884.)

Wroblewski’s experiments on the direct liquefaction of oxygen by
compression gave for the density of the liquid only a superior limit, given
as 0.94. By observing that the tension of oxygen at —150° is near that
of carbon dioxide and nitrogen monoxide at 0°, knowing that the den-
sity of liquid CO, is 0.9471 and of N,O is 0.9370, the author has calen-
lated the density of liquid oxygen to be 0.899. This agrees well with
Cailletet and Hautefeuille’s results, who obtained, by compressing a mixt-
ure of 7 volumes of CO, and 1 of O, the value 0.89 at —25° C. and 500 at-
mospheres pressure; and from a mixture of N.O and O, the value 0.94
at —23°and300 atmospheres. The value 0.899 also agrees with the press-
ures observed by Pictet in his experiments on the compression of oxy-
gen. (Wied. Ann., xx, 80; J. Phys., II, 111, 938, February, 1885.)

Bender has investigated the law of density of saline solutions by
comparing together solutions containing, for a given volume, a given
number of equivalents of various salts. Using, for example, chlorides,
he finds that the difference between the density of the solution of any
salt whatever and that of a solution of sal-ammoniac is proportional to’
the number of equivalents contained in the solution, provided always
that this number does not exceed four. The law extends to other radi-
cals besides chlorine, so that the density of any saline solution what-
ever may be represented by the formula—

du = (du) wosicr + pe (My + Mz)

in which jc is the number of equivalents of the salt contained in the so-
lution and m, and m, the moduli of the metal and of the acid radical.
These moduli have been experimentally determined by the author, and
from these the density of any normal solution whatever may be calcu-
lated. (Wied. Ann., xx, 560; J. Phys., May, 1884, II, 111, 221.)

Mendelejeff has communicated to the Russian Chemical Society a
paper on salt solutions. It would be easy to prove, he says, with the
data of Gerlach, Marignac, Cremers, and Schiff, that the volume of a
given amount of a salt in its solutions (of a molecule, for instance) va-
ries with the variations of temperature and the degree of concentration
of the solutions. It increases with both of these values; and it might
PHYSICS. 441

be concluded therefrom that the force on which solution depends varies
with the degree of concentration. Still, another conclusion may be ar-
rived at if Grassy’s measurements of the decrease of volumes of NaCl
and of CaCl, be taken into account. Interpolation shows that these so-
lutions are reduced in volume by pressure as the amount of the dis-
solved salt varies; and the reduction of volume which accompanies the
solution enables us to calculate the corresponding pressure. It ap-
pears that to each molecule of NaCl dissolved in 100 parts of water cor-
responds a nearly permanent pressure of about 120 atmospheres, what.
ever be the degree of concentration. Kor CaCl, the pressure also re-
mains constant, but is nearly three times as great. Thus, if the tendency
towards solution be measured by pressure, it results, for the two salts
above mentioned, that the first amounts of salt dissolved exert the same
pressure as the last, which bring the solution near to saturation. (Na-
ture, March, 1884, xx1x, 512.)

Nicol has published a series of papers on salt solutions. In the first
he considers the phenomenon of equilibrium in these solutions, and con-
cludes that when salt solutions are mixed the tendency is to form the
system which will occupy the smallest volume, since then the equilib.
rium is stable. In the second he discusses the saturation of sa!t solu-
tions, and finds that, as a general rule, the solubility of two salts
together is greater than when separate. Inthe third he continues the dis-
cussion on the molecular volumes of salt solutions, and treats especially
of water of crystallization. He points out that water of crystallization
bas no effect on the molecular volume of a salt in solution; and
hence draws the inference that in all probability water of crystallization
does not exist in solution. In the fourth paper he gives the results of
his investigations on the nature of solution, particularly on the boiling
points of salts solutions; and he shows that by rise of temperature the
attraction of sait for salt is so greatly diminished that it is equivalent
to an increase in attraction of salt for water. (Phil. dlag., February,
June, September, October, 1854, xvi, 150, 537; xviii, 179, 364.)

Guthrie also has continued his researches upon solution, aiid has
published the results of a study of the ammonia group (including the
ethylamines and aniline) in its behavior with water, and also the results
obtained by shifting the temperatures up on the seale until the solid
fuses, so as to establish the continuity of the phenomena of fusion with
those of solution. He establishes the fact that certain bodies originally
solid may at high temperatures become miscible with water in all pro-
portions—a fact of great geologic interest, since it throws light on the
pyrohydration of igneous formations, as eryohydration has done for
floes. (Phil. Mag., V, xvi11, 22, 105, July, August, 1884.)

3. Of Gases.

Andres proposes the following lecture experiment to illustrate
Boyle’s law: In a glass tube about a meter long and from 14$™™ to 2™™
A492 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1894

internal diameter, closed at one end and open below, is introduced a
thread of mereury about 2507" in length. .This incloses a certain vol-
ume of air, about 40 cubic centimeters. The tube is supported on a
stand, which has a scale on white paper divided into centimeters, and can
be placed on the table with either end vertical. When the closed end
is uppermost, the pressure on the inclosed air is the difference between
the barometric height and 250; and when inverted, it is the sum of the
barometric height and 250. If the barometer stand at 750", the press-
ure in the former case is 500™" and in the latter 1,000". Consequently
the volume is reduced from 40 cubic centimeters to 30. (Phil. Mag.,
July, 1884, xviit, 80.)

Diakonoff has devised a new form of siphon barometer, which, being
easily filled, is more readily portable than the ordinary forms. The
barometer tube proper, which at its upper third has a diameter of 0.012
meter, is continued above by acapillary tube of the same length, which
turns downward. At bottom it opens into the side of a larger tube, the
upper end of which is closed with a cork, while the lower end is drawn
out to enter one end of arubber tube, the other end of which 1s fastened
to the lower end of a funnel tube the length of the barometer and a
little more. After the apparatus has been thoroughly cleaned, it is
filled by pounag mercury in the funnel tube, whence it rises through
the barometer tube and overflows at top, the excess of mercury falling
through the small tube into a reservoir below, into which its end dips.
When all the tubes are full, the rubber tube is detached from the funnel
tube, and a portion of the mercury is allowed to flow out till the column
stands at the proper height. It is read by means of a graduated scale
and two verniers. (J. Phys., I, m1, 27, January, 1884.)

Grumnach has suggested the use of a vacuum tube in connection
with the barometer, so that by electrical means the rarefaction may be
ascertained. He states that the opinion entertained until recently that
the electric discharge would not take place through the best attainable
vacuum is not absolutely true, since recent experiments have shown
that the passage of the electric discharge depends largely upon the form
of the electrodes. In a vacuum in which the spark will not pass if the
electrodes are simple wires, it readily passes when they are of the form
of balls or cylinders. The author’s barometer is connected with a mer-
cury pump and with a Geissler tube, operated by a small induction coil.
As the exhaustion proceeds, the nitrogen bands first disappear, then the
lines Ff and @ of hydrogen and some lines of mercury. Finally the
phosphorescence of the glass appears first at the negative end, then at the
positive end, and finally throughout the tube. At last the discharge
is totally arrested or is slowly intermittent. Comparisons with this nor-
mal barometer show differences too large to be attributed to errors of
observation. The author finds that a difference of 0.07° C. produces
an error of 0.01" in the barometer reading. (Wied. Ann., XXI, 698;
J. Phys., U1, 1, 264, June, 1884.)

Frank Waldo has suggested the use of Wright’s apparatus for dis-
tilling mercury in the direct filling of barometer tubes. By attaching
the tube to be filled to the end of the distilling-tube, the mercury, as it
condenses, passes into it at once, and without coming in contact with
the air. Certain precautions are detailed in the paper. (Am. J. Sci.,
January, 1884, III, xxvu, 18.)

Schumann has made a long series of experiments on the coefficient of
friction of gases and vapors and its dependence on temperature. He
concludes (1) that values of this coefficient calculated by the formula
of Maxwell show greater deviations from each other than would corre-
spond to errors of observation, and this particularly at high tempera-
tures; (2) that by introducing a correction this formula gives numbers
which at ordinary temperatures show close agreement with those ob-
tained by the method of transpiration ; (3) that, owing to absorption, the
method of transpiration gives for gases too high values and for vapors
too low values of the coefficient of friction; (4) that the dependence of
the coefficient on the temperature increases with the temperature; (5)
that the coefficients of all the vapors examined have almost the same
function of temperature; and (6) that the relation found by Puluj to
exist between length of path and refractive index holds for the vapors
of homologous ethers at corresponding temperatures. (Wied. Ann.,
Xx11I, 353, November, 1884; Phil. Mag., December, 1884, V, xviII, 544.)

Winkelman has studied the phenomena of diffusion of gases and va-
pors, in order to compare the results obtained with those calculated from
the formulas of Stefan and Meyer. His experiments were made in a
tube drawn ‘out at the lower end into a portion of uniform but of much
finer bore than the upper portion, and graduated. This lower portion
contained the liquid which was to be vaporized, the gas into which it
was to diffuse being passed into the upper portion by means of an
entrance and exit tube. For diffusion of steam into hydrogen, into
carbon dioxide, and into air, discrepancies between the actual results
and the theoretical ones deduced by Meyer’s formula were observed.
For alcohol and for ether vapor diffusing into these three gases, a fair
agreement with Stefan’s formula was observed. The mean length of
free path of the vapor molecule can be obtained from the latter for-
mula, at least approximately. (Wied. Ann., June, 1884, xx1I, 1; Am.
J. Sci., July, 1884, II, xxvii, 70.)

Guglielmo also has determined the coefficient of diffusion of the vapor
of water into air, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. He gives for the first,
12.86 at 8° and 13.05 at 15°; for the second, 46.95 at 18°; and for the
third, 8.38 at 18°. The last two values are 3.52 and 0.628 times the co-
efficient of diffusion into air. By Meyer’s formula the author has cal-
culated the mean length of free path of the molecule of vapor of water
in an atmosphere of this vapor. He finds the value 0.00000891, that
directly obtained by Kundt and Warburg being 0.00000649. The fun-

mento, XIII, 104; J. Phys., December, 1884, IT, 111, 555.)

Bunsen has investigated the condensation of carbon dioxide gas on
the surface of glass. The glass employed was the fine-spun variety
used in weaving. The space occupied by 150 grams was only 100 ¢. ¢,
The length ot filament was 62 geographical miles and its surface 23
square meters. The specific gravity of the glass was 2.50596. The ap-
paratus consisted of a graduated glass tube, closed above by a stop-
cock; above this is a length of the same tube, in which the spun glass
is placed, and which is closed above by a second stop-cock. The whole
is placed over a mercury cistern, and the lower part filled with dry CQ).
The upper part is then exhausted, and the experiment commences by
opening the communicating stop-cock. At the end of a given time the
pressure of the gas is determined anew, and from this the weight of the
gas which has been condensed is readily calculated. Bunsen’s experi-
ments began on the 20th of April, 1880, and at the end of three years
the condensation did not seem to have terminated. During the first
year it was 49.21 ¢. ¢., during the first two years 57.94 ¢.¢., and during
the three 69.98 c.c¢., or for the three years 5.135 ¢. e. per square meter.
Granted that capillary attraction can be perceived, as Quincke states,
at a distance of 0.000005 from the surface, the 5.135 ¢. ec. condensed
ona surface of 10,000 sq. cm. would occupy a space of 0.05 ¢. ¢. and
have been condensed by a pressure of 102.7 atmospheres. Since carbon
dioxide is liquid at 57.5 atmospheres at the temperature of the experi-
ments, there can be no doubt that the surface of the glass was covered
with a layer of liquid carbon dioxide. (Wied. Ann., xx, 545; Phil.
Mag., March, 1884, V, xvi, 161; J. Phys., June, 1884, IT, 111, 262.)

Blondlot has considered the influence of electrification on the maxi-
mum tension of a vapor in contact with its liquid, and concludes that
the maximum tension of the vapor in contact with this electrified sur-
face is smaller than it would be if the surface was not electrified, by an

0

amount represented by 2zp! in which » represents the electric surface

density and x the ratio of the densities of the vaper and the liquid.

ACOUSTICS.

Martini has studied the phenomena of the production of sound by the
flow of liquids. His apparatus consisted of a vertical tube either of
glass or metal, within which was a metallic disk perforated at its center
with a hole, the diameter of which was equal to the thickness of the
plate. The production of the sound is determined by the periodicity
of the flow, the tone produced being either the fundamental note of the
liquid column or one of its harmonics, according to the position of the
regulating cock. The sounds produced seem like those of a closed pipe.
PHYSICS. ; 445

They are the same whatever the position of the disk in the tube. Two
vibrating cylinders give notes whose pitch is inversely as their linear
dimensions. If the disk is on the side where the water enters, the
number of vibrations given by the same cylinder is proportional to the
square root of the charge. The nature of the tube is without influence
on the pitch of the note. (J. Phys., May, 1884, II, 11, 218.)

Neyreneuf, following Tyndall, has called attention to the facility with
which sound traverses the interstices of solid bodies when the air in
them is continuous. If the conjugate-mirror experiment be repeated
with a thick sheet of cotton wool between the mirrors, the sound does
not seem to be sensibly altered in intensity. Two such sheets may be
interposed without preventing a sensitive flame from showing agitation
when placed in the conjugate focus. A sheet of filter paper is equiva-
lent to two sheets of cotton. To prove how difficult it is to destroy
resonance, the author states that he has performed the reflection ex-
periment with one of the mirrors covered with cotton upon its reflecting
surface. (J. Phys., May, 1884, II, 111, 209.)

Neyreneuf has also continued his researches on the transmission of
sound by gases, and now gives the results obtained with nitrogen
monoxide and dioxide, ammonia, and ethylene. With nitrogen. mo-
noxide and air the ratio of the flame distances was as 1.32 : 1 as a mean,
a value identical with that obtained for carbon dioxide. For ammonia
and air the ratio of the flame distances was 1.46 in place of 1.42. No
differences were observed between air, nitrogen dioxide, and ethylene.
He has observed that the damping effect of solid particles is very
marked. By using a long inverted U-tube of rubber filled with hydro-
gen the author bas shown that the sound is much less enfeebled than
when traversing the same thickness of air. (C. R., xcvu1, 980, 1264,
April, May, 1884.)

Elsas has studied the laws of the foreed vibrations of plates; 7. e.,
those which the p!ate is made to exeeute under the influence of a vibrat-
ing body in communication with it. The plate, circular in form, and
made of cardboard, gelatin, ebonite, &c., is fixed by its center to a sew-
ing needle perpendicular to its plane. <A flexible cord, stretched by a
weight, is attached to the needle by one end, and by the other to the
prong of a tuning-fork. By means of sand and lycopodium on the plate
the position of the nodes and venters could be determined. The results
show (1) that such a plate gives the nodal figures of Chladni, the cen-
ter being a node; (2) that these figures never have an uneven number
of diametral nodal lines; (3) that, while always even, these lines degen-
erate frequently into hyperbolic curves, the vertices of which are on the
same straight line; (1) that for the same reasons the nodal lines are
wanting in the central portions, but appear on the periphery of the
plate; and (5) that the nodal lines of communicated vibrations never
cut each other. These results are in accord with those previously ob-
tained with membranes. (Wied. Ann., xIx, 474; J. Phys., January,
1884, II, 11, 33.)

Mercadier has presented to the French Academy the results of his re.
searches on the laws of transverse vibration of elastic rods. The rods
were made of iron and steel, were rectangular in section, and were vi-
brated electro-magnetically, the vibrations being recorded on the chron-
ograph. He finds (1) that the vibrations are independent of the width,
(2) are directly proportional to the thickness (measured in the direction
of vibration), and (3) are inversely as the square of the length. Rep-

resenting these results by the formula n=k, Mereadier has caleulated

the value of the coefficient k for steel from his measurements, and finds
it to be 5,529,503, while Poisson’s formula gives 5,310,866. The mean
value, 5,320,134, being adopted, the author bas calculated the number of
vibrations for different rods and compared them with those given by
experiment. The results are in very satisfactory accord, and show that
by means of this coefficient the dimensions of a rod required to give
any special pitch may be readily calculated. (C. R., Xcvii, 803, 911,
March, April, 1884; J. Phys., May, 1884, IT, 111, 189.)

hk. Weber has devised an electric siren, which is simple in principle
and which has many advantages. Its principal element is a disk, whose
periphery is divided into alternate segments of conducting and non-
conducting substance. Fifteen of these disks are placed upon an axis,
each being 4°° in diameter and separated by 3™" from the others. The
first wheel has twenty-four metallic contacts, the second twenty-seven,
the third thirty, and so on up the gamut. Upon the edges of these
disks fifteen springs press, for the purpose of making electric contact
with the metallic segments, and so completing the circuit through the
axis. [ach spring has its own cell of battery, the current passing
through a telephone, in which is heard a note corresponding to the
number of interruptions made by the disk in the same circuit. The
siren may be driven by any form of power, but a small electric motor the
author finds very serviceable. A counter permits the number of rota-
tions to be determined. One curious result was obtained when four
disks were used, having the same number of teeth but differently spaced,
the metallic part being in the first ;/5, in the second -3;, in the third 5%,
and in the fourth ;%, of the insulating part. The sound produced by
the first, though feeble, was accompanied by its double octave; by the
second, the tones 1:2:3:4:5:6:8; the third gave 1:2:3; and the
fourth, 1:2:4. Resultant tones were also very satisfactorily studied.
(J. Phys., December, 1884, II, 111, 535.)

Blaikley has continued his studies upon the phenomena connected
with the determination of the velocity of sound in air by means of the
nodal points in smooth brass tubes. He concludes (1) that these tubes
must speak with a pure tone; (2) that if partials are present the tubes
must be of such form as to have their proper tones in exact agreement —
with the harmonic series ; (3) that the air-blast must not constrain the
pipe to speak any other than its natural resonant pitch; (4) that in
PHYSICS. 447

smooth tubes the diminution of velocity is proportional to r— and to
n~%, as determined by Helmholtz; (5) that the velocity in free air for
sound waves of low intensity, or just audible, is 331.676 meters at 0° C.;
and (6) that the ratio between the two specific heats of air, as deduced
from the Newtonian velocity, 279.955 meters, and the above value, 331.676
meters, is 1.4036. (Phil. Mag., October, 1884, V, xv, 328.)

Rayleigh has examined the conditions of sensitiveness of smoke-jets
and jets of colored liquid, paying especial attention in the former to
the illumination, and exalting the effect by means of resonators. The
inaximum sensitiveness was reached at 256 vibrations. By using the
stroboscopic method, the serpentine motion of the jet previous to rupture
was clearly seen. For liquid jets, water colored with permanganate was
used in water containing ferrous sulphate. The notes for maximum
sensitiveness were far lower than for smoke-jets, forks vibrating from
20 to 50 times a second producing the maximum effect. This is due,
not to the difference of density, but to a difference of viscosity. (Phil.
Mag., March, 1884, V, xvu, 188.)

Fuchs has suggested a simple method of analyzing the vowel sounds,
which is easy to put in practice. One of the ears is closed with a piece
ot wet tissue paper, and to the other is applied one end of a rubber
tube tipped with horn, the other end being placed in the mouth. The
mouth is then given the configuration corresponding to the vowel A,
for example, and the various keys of a piano in good tune are struck,
beginning with the highest notes of the scale. The mouth cavity acts
like a resonator, so that when a note is struck which accords with it
this note is re-enforced by resonance and appears stronger than the others.
In this way the harmonics which are characteristic of the vowel for
which the mouth is set may be easily determined. The sonometer may
be used in this experiment in place of the piano. (Wied. Ann., xx1,
513; J. Phys. I, 111, 548; Phil. Mag., May, 1884, V, xvut, 410.)

Melde has investigated the effect of placing the vibrating fork at a
position on a string other than its extremity. If it is at the middle
point, the vibrations are symmetrical and the two halves take identical
forms. Since the point of attachment cannot be a node, the cord does
not vibrate if the sound of the fork is that of an even harmonie of the
cord. In short, each half vibrates as if it was an entirely distinct string,
vibrated at their common extremity. If the fork is not at the middle
point, the form of the string during the vibration is dissymmetrical with
relation to the middle. The forks were vibrated electrically. (Wied.
Ann., XXI, 452; J. Phys., December, 1884, II, 111, 547.)

Thompson has given an illustrated description of the sound-mills con-
structed by Dvorak. Two of these act by the repulsion of resonant-
boxes. Inthe first four, resonators are mounted so as to revolve horizon-
tally ; in the second the resonator is a cylindrical box, which revolves
on its axis, The third is called a “sound radiometer” and the fourth

St. George bas patented a novel form of phonograph. A round photo-
graphic plate is revolved on its axis by means of any suitable motor.
The light falls on the plate perpendicularly through a small opening,
which, by means of a screw connected to the axis by bevel gear, is car-
ried slowly toward the center. If the light were uniform, a spiral line
would be traced on the plate. But over the opening is a slide connected
by a lever with a diaphragm and mouth-piece, so that on talking inte
the latter the vibration of the diaphragm varies the size of the opening ;
so that there is produced on the plate a spiral band of varying width
corresponding to the vibrations of the plate. If now the prepared plate
be rotated under such conditions that a beam of light sent through this
photographic image falls upon a selenium photophone transmitter, the
tones of the voice are reproduced. (Science, Iv, 124, August, 1884.)

Dr. Zintgraff, who has gone into the interior of Africa with Cha-
vanne, has taken with him a phonograph, for the purpose of fixing the
speech and melodies of hitherto unknown tribes, which when received
by the instrument will be forwarded to scientific men in Germany. The
apparatus, now used for this purpose for the first time, was made by
Fublrmann, of Berlin, in fae simile of one kept in that city, so that the
plates made in Africa can be put upon the Berlin machine and caused
to reproduce the sounds received. (Nature, March, 1884, xx1x, 460.)

Cross has given a lecture on the determination, history, and present
standards of musical pitch. Under the first head he considered the
methods by the sonometer and the tuning-fork and the tonometer of
Scheibler. The fork he considered the only good standard, since it
changed its rate by less than 5955 per degree centigrade. He gives the
following table, prepared in 1880, giving the results of some of his meas-
urements:

In 1882-83 the standard used by the Boston symphony orchestra
was an A fork of 448 double vibrations; in 183384 it was a French
A of 435 vibrations. The standard French pitch of the New England
PHYSICS. 449

Conservatory of Music is a middle O, a true sixth below the normal A;
hence 261 vibrations. Hence the © fork used with an orchestra which
has A for its standard does not agree with this. Chickering’sand Miller’s
forks are C standards, a tempered sixth below the French A; hence
258.7 vibrations. Thomas’s present pitch is an A, a little sharper than
the French A. In Handel’s time the C fork had 249.6 vibrations ; hence
the difficulty now experienced in singing old music. (Science, May, 1884,
II, 667.)

Compton has devised a method for autographically recording the
vibrations of a tuning-fork in terms of the beats between it and a siren.
Three pens make records on a strip of chemical paper. The first marks
seconds, the second the revolutions of the siren, and the third the beats.
Since the first pen is connected to the back contact of a relay, and the
second to the front contact, both pens cannot record together ; and when
the coincidence is perfect, the siren mark is omitted. The beat record
is made by placing a membrane over the small end of a resonator, with
an adjustible platinum contact in the main circuit of a relay, the pen
being in the secondary circuit. The adjustment is so made that when
a fork placed in front of the resonator beats with the siren, the circuit
is broken, the armature falls back and closes the secondary circuit, pro-
ducing a dash ou the paper. ‘The record, therefore, shows three sets of
marks: First, the beat dashes ; second, the siren revolutions; and third
the seconds marks. From the two latter the pitch of the siren is deter-
mined; and this, with the two former, determines the pitch of the fork.
(Am. J. Sci., June, 1884, IIT, xxvii, 444.)

HEAT.
1. Production of Heat.—Thermometry.

Lippmann has objected to the thermometric scales in use as being
entirely arbitrary. Neither temperature nor intervals of temperature
are measurable magnitudes, in the proper sense of the word. To meas-
ure a quantity is to find its ratio to a magnitude of the same kind taken
as a unit. The only physical magnitudes capable of measurement are
those of which multiples can be constructed. But this is not true of
temperature, since intervals of temperature cannot beadded. He sug-
gests, therefore, an absolute thermometric scale founded on the quantity
of mechanical work done by heat-engines. According to Carnot’s prin-
ciple, the maximum efliciency is the same for all heat-engines working
between the same limits of temperature. If such an engine take a quan-
tity of heat, Q, from the source of heat and give up the quantity Q/ to
the refrigerator, then the ratio has a minimum value for a given in-
terval of temperature, independent of the nature of the engine. The
temperature-interval is represented by that fraction of a heat-unit which

is transferred to the refrigerator without having been transformed

into work. The interval between two temperatures is represented not
by a difference but by a ratio, the ratio between the quantities of heat
received and rejected by a perfect engine working between these tem- ~
peratures. (J. Phys., February, II, 111, 53; July 1884, II, 111, 27%.)

Pettersson has laid down the following principles with reference to
the measurement of heat: First, measurements of heat should be executed
at constant temperature, 7. e., without the aid of thermometers ; second,
the amount of heat developed in calorimetric experiments should be
directly transformed into work and measured in absolute units ; third, the
principle should be applicable to the measurement of all kinds of ¢a-
loric energy, such as specific heat, radiant heat, the heat absorbed or
evolved in chemical reactions, &c. Several forms of apparatus are de-
scribed which the author has used for such measurements, including
the form finally adopted. (Nature, July, 1884, xxx, 320.)

Guthrie has studied the thermal and corresponding volume-changes
attending the mixture of liquids, the substances used being alcohol,
carbon disulphide, amylene, ether, chloroform, and benzene. (Phil. Mag.,
December, 1884, V, xviit, 495.)

Cailletet has constructed an apparatus for the continuous production
of intense cold, which consists of a closed steel cylinder containing a
coil of copper pipe projecting from each end. Two copper tubes are
screwed into the cylinder; one of these communicates with the author’s
mercurial piston-pump, the other receives the ethylene, which has been
compressed by the pump and cooled by methyl] chloride. In this way
a circuit is formed, in which the same quantity of ethylene is repeatedly
evaporated in the copper coil, producing intense cold, and then com-
pressed again by the pump, it being cooled sufficiently by the evaporation
of methyl chloride. (Science, April, 1884, 111, 526.)

Barbier has demonstrated Regnault’s principle between weight and
stem thermometers, that if they are in accord at two fixed points they
remain in accord at all temperatures, as follows: If the temperature
t° be defined by saying that 5,550™™ of mercury at 0° become 5,550-+-
¢™™ at ¢°, then in the stem thermometer it will occupy at 0° 5,550™™
of volume =n; and at t°, n+¢ volumes. In the weight thermometer,
containing all the mercury at 0°, ¢ volumes will flow out at f°, leaving

n volumes; i. ¢., the fraction will flow out, and _" will remain.
n+t n+
The ratio of these values is = which is proportional to ¢ as in the

stem thermometer. Since t= ae the two thermometers are di-
rectly comparable with one another when ¢ is made equal to ;45. (C.
&., November, 1854, xc1x, 752.)

Mayengon has devised an instrument, which he calls a thermogalvan.
oscope, for the purpose of rendering the expansion of wires visible at
a distance, serving, therefore, as an indicator of temperature. It con-
PHYSICS. 451

sists of a metallic wire fixed at the ends, and connected at its middle
point with a cord passing over a pulley above and having a counter-
weight below. When the wire elongates by heat, its center falls, rotates
the pulley, and causes an index to traverse a graduated scale. The ap-
paratus is very sensitive as a thermoscope, and by passing a current
through the wire it may be used asa galvanoscope. (J. Phys., Septem-
ber, 1884, II, 111, 393.)

Clodig has proposed to furnish steam-boilers with mercury thermom-
eters, the reservoir (which is of iron) being placed in the steam, while
the stem (which is of iron within and glass without the boiler) passes
through the metal. The pressure of the steam compresses the reservoir
of the thermometer and increases the rise of the mereury in the tube,
thus acting as a manometer. (J. Phys., May, 1884, II, 111, 222.)

Browne has given a résumé of the most important pyrometers at pres-
entinuse. In Siemens’s instrument the temperature is determined from
the increase in the resistance of a platinum wire as the heat increases.
Tremeschini uses the expansion of a thin plate of platinum which is
heated by a mass of metal previously raised to the temperature of the
medium, in order to determine the temperature. Trampler’s pyrometer
is based on the differential expansion of iron and graphite. The Gaunt-
lett instrument is similar, except that fire-clay is used instead of graph-
ite. Ducomet’s pyrometer consists of a series of rings having progress-
ively lower melting points. These are strung on a rod, which is pushed
into the medium to be measured, the rings being pressed together by a
spring. When any ring softens it is pressed out, the column shortens,
and a simple apparatus shows the temperature. The instrument known
as the thalpotasimeter 1s based on the principle that the tension of a
saturated vapor is proportional to the temperature. A tube of metal
is partly filled with a liquid suited to the temperature to be measured,
and connected with a pressure-gauge. Ether is used from 100° to 220°
F., water up to 680°, and mercury above this. Saintignon’s pyrometer,
as improved by Boulier, depends on the water-current principle, the
temperature being determined by noting the amount of heat communi-
cated to a known current of water circulating in the place whose tem-
perature is desired. At Limoges and at Sévres this pyrometer has been
satisfactorily used for determining the temperature of the porcelain fur-
naces. (Nature, August, 1884, xxx, 366.)

Von Baumhauer has contrived a modified form of thermo-regulator
for use with paraffin baths to render the temperature constant. It con-
sists of an air-reservoir containing mercury, plunged into the paraftin.
As the temperature rises, the expansion of the air forces the mercury
up a central tube until it cuts off the flow of gas entering by a smaller
tube adjustable within the latter. (C. &., August, 1884, xc1x, 370.)

Ericsson has published a description of the sun-motor which he had
in operation in the summer of 1883, as the result of twenty years’ experi-
ments, Its leading feature is that of concentrating the radiant heat
An? SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

by means of a rectangular trough having a curved bottom, lined on the
inside with polished plates, so arranged that they reflect the sun’s rays
towards a cylindrical boiler placed longitudinally above the trough.
The trough is 11 feet long and 16 broad, and receives a beam of sun-
light of 25,400 square inches in section. The boiler is 64 inches in
diameter and 11 feet long. The motor employed is a steam-engine
with a cylinder 6 inches in diameter and 8 inches stroke. In the trials
the previous summer the average speed of the engine was 120 turns a
minute, the pressure on the piston being 35 pounds per square inch.
From these results, Ericsson deduces some conclusions with reference

surface. Hence, as the boiler of the motor contains 1,274 square inches,
the solar rays acting on it are diffused in the ratio 1,274 : 0.508, or 2,507 :
1. Since the radiant heat transmitted to the reflector by the sun is
capable of imparting a temperature to the boiler of 520° F. above that
of the atmosphere, accepting Newton’s law that “the temperature is
as the density of the rays,” the temperature imparted to the boiler of
the sun-motor proves that the temperature of the solar surface cannot
be less than 520° x 2,507, or 1,303,640° F. (Nature, January, 1884,

Ayrton and Perry have presented a paper on the indicator diagram
of the gas-engine to the London Physical Society, intended to teach
engineers a new mode of studying these diagrams. The paper gives the
most recent results obtained with Dowson gas, a large wooden model
of the Otto engine enabling the operations during the cycle to be un-
derstood. By means of tables of the composition of the Dowson gas
and coal gas, of the air required for their combustion, and of their spe-
cific heats, as well as those of their products, the characteristic equation
of the fluid used in the engine may be determined. Three practical
methods of determining the rate of gain of heat by the fluid during the
forward stroke are given, this rate being compared everywhere with
the rate of doing work, by means of a diagram. If W represent the

receive the heat developed by = 0.508 square inch of the solar

indicated work in one cycle, 5.64 W is the total energy of combustion ~

of one charge; and this is expended as follows: 1.45 W is the work
done in the forward stroke, 2.22 W is given to the cylinder by radiation
in the forward stroke, 1.5 W is carried off through the exhaust-pipe,
0.47 W is given to the cylinder as heat after the exhaust-valve opens.

Thurston has published the results of tests made on an Otto gas-en-

gine by Brooks and Steward at the Stevens Institute of Technology. The-

combustion continues even after expansion has progressed considerably.

the cost of operating it is given as 8? cents per horse-power per hour.

2. Hapansion and Change of State.

Thorpe and Riicker have applied the theory of Van der Waals to.
the establishing of an important. relation between the absolute tem-
perature of boiling of a liquid, the volume at this temperature, and a

_ constant, which they have determined to be 2, or very near this number.

Mendelejeff had already established the formula = — kt for the ex-

pansion of liquids, in which k is a modulus varying with the liquid.
This author now shows that if the dilatation of gases be expressed by

V,=1- at, and that of liquids by —— then 2¢,= a and put-
_— a

ting a equal to 2, we have i = 2,+ 273, in which either k or ¢ being

given the other can be determined. (J. Chem. Soc., April, 1884, xLv,
135; J. Soe. Phys. Chim. Russe, XV1, 232; Nature, August, 1884, xxx, 396.)

De Heen, assuming that the molecules of a liquid attract each other
in the inverse ratio of the seventh power of their distance, and that the
work done by the molecular forces during expansion through 1° in
temperature is a constant for the same liquid, has given the formula

ay aV?°3 as true for the volumes of all liquids. In this formula a

dt
represents the expansion coefficient at 0°. The author has compared
the values of Al calculated by this formula with those deduced from

_ the empirical formulas of other authors, especially Kopp and Is. Pierre,

and finds a satisfactory agreement. (J. Phys., December, 1884, II, m1,
549.) ;

Thoulet has suggested a very simple method of determining the vol-
ume expansion-coefficient of solid substances in small fragments. For
this purpose he uses a solution of mercuric iodide in potassium iodide,
of specific gravity from 2.75 to 2.85, the coefficient of which has been
accurately determined by Goldschmidt. The solid is placed in the
solution, and water is added until it remains in equilibrium, having the
same density as the liquid. The temperature and density are noted.
A small quantity of the concentrated solution is now added, and the
solid rises to the surface. The density is again noted. Then the tem-
perature is slowly raised, the liquid expanding more than the solid,
until the temperature is reached at which the solid is again in equilib-
rium. Noting the final density of the liquid and its temperature, the

data are at hand for the calculation of the coefficient of the solid, (@
R., March, 1884, xcvi11, 620.)

As long ago as 1867 Govi had propounded the hypothesis that the
contraction which takes place when stretched rubber is heated was due
to the expansion of the gas contained in its pores. When the caout-
chouc is stretched the spherical cavities elongate; and on heating, the
gas dilates more than the solid, and tends to make the ellipsoidal cavi-
ties spherical again, thus shortening the rubber. Hesehus has tested
this hypothesis by performing the experiment in vacuo. Placing the
stretched caoutchoue under an exhausted receiver, the expansion of
the air due to diminished pressure should have the effect of shortening
the rubber. But not the smallest effect was observed. (J. Soc. Phys.
Chim. Russe, XV, 103; J. Phys., October, 1884, I, m1, 459.)

Fromme has made an investigation into the changes produced in the
molecular condition of iron by heating to redness and cooling. He con-
cludes that in the tempering of a steel bar, besides the mechanical and
purely physical process of sudden contraction, another change, also of a
chemical nature, takes place, this consisting in a combination between
the free carbon and the iron. (Phil. Mag., December, 1884, xv1tt, 473.)

Gernez has studied the duration of the solidification of surfused sul-
phur in both the prismatic and octahedral forms, and finds that the time
required for the latter to solidify is much longer, in some cases 100
times, than the former. During these experiments he sucveeded in ob-
taining a third form of erystal, in long prismatic rods with a nacreous
luster. Hence he concludes that the measurement of the velocity of
solidification constitutes a new method of investigation, which applied
to sulphur developed some unexpected facts, such as the modifications
produced at constant temperature under the prolonged influence of heat,
and the order of transformation under various conditions. (J. Phys.,
II, 111, 58, 286, February, July, 1884.)

K. Wiedemann has experimented to determine the change in volume
which metals and their alloys undergo on fusion. He used a thermom-
eter containing the metal to be examined, in the form of a cylinder, sur-
rounded with oil. The points of solidification were determined by the
method of cooling. Zine melts at 226° and increases in volume at the
moment of fusion, this increase being from 1.7 to 2.2 per cent., according
to the specimen. Plumber’s solder increases in volume also about 2 per
cent. Lead-bismnth alloys of various compositions show two different
points of fusion, to each of which corresponds a notable increase of vol-
ume, but which, however, isnot sudden. (Wied. Ann., Xx, 228; J. Phys.,
Il, 111, 148, March, 1884.)

Raoult has examined the laws of congelation in solutions, and con-
firms essentially the principles established by Blagden in 1788. The
conclusion reached is enunciated in the following general law: A mole-
cule of any compound whatever, in dissolving in 100 molecules of any
liquid whatever, different in character, lowers the solidifying point of
PHYSICS. 455

this liquid by a quantity nearly constant, which is not far from 0.639.
(J. Phys., January, 1884, II, m1, 16.)

Guthrie has given the name eutexia to the property possessed by cer-
tain compound bodies of fusing at very low temperatures, such bodies
being called eutectic bodies or eutectics. He uses the term for bodies
made up of two or more constituents, which constituents are in such
proportion to one another as to give the resulting compound body a
minimum temperature of liquefaction. Taking up metallic alloys, he
finds that the eutectic alloy of bismuth with lead contains 44.42 of
lead and fuses at 122.79; with tin, 53.90 per cent. of tin and fuses at
133°; with cadmium, 40.81 per cent. Cd, melting at 1449; and with zine,
7.15 per cent. of zinc, fusing at 248°. A tetra-eutectic alloy, containing
47.38 of bismuth, 19.36 of lead, 13.29 cadmium, and 19.97 of tin, fused
at 71°, below the temperature of boiling alcohol. His next experiments
were made with salt alloys. With niter, fusing at 320°, the eutectic
alloy with potassium sulphate fused at 300°, with potassium chromate at
295°, with barium nitrate at 278, with strontium nitrate at 253°, with
calcium nitrate at 251°, and with lead nitrate at 207°. The analogy
between eutectic alloys of this sort and eryohydrates is pointed out, and
the geological and mineralogical importance of eutexia is discussed in
the original paper. (Phil. Mag., June, 1884,V, xvi, 462; Nature, June,
1884, xxx, 139.)

Trouton has compared together the quantities of heat necessary to
evaporate at constant pressure quantities of different liquids taken in
the ratio of their molecular weights, and finds that the amount of heat
required by any body is approximately proportional to its absolute
temperature at the point of ebullition. By multiplying the latent heat
by the density, the amount of heat required to evaporate a quantity of
a body proportional to its molecular weight is obtained; and the ratio
of this value to the absolute temperature of the boiling point is approxi-
mately constant. Thus, the latent heat of bromine is 45.9, it boils at
45.9 x 79.75 :
373 463 = 10.89. The la-
tent heat of butyric acid is 114.7, it boils at 162°, and its density is 44.
114.7 x 44
cludes that the molecules of bodies, and especially of chemically related
ones, in changing from the gaseous to the liquid state at the same press
ure, disengage quantities of heat which may be called the molecular
latent heat, directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the
boiling point. (Phil. Mag., July, 1884, V, xvi, 54.)

Klobakow has devised an instrument for determining the vapor den
sity of bodies of high and of low boiling points, respectively. For low
boiling points the apparatus (which he calls a vapor-density dilato
meter) resembles a weight thermometer. For bodies of high boiling
point le uses an apparatus resembling an araometer, consisting of a

63°, and its density is 79.75. Hence,

glass vessel with an opening at its lower part, which allows a part of the
liquid in the instrument to flow out as the vapor in the upper portion
expands. By means of a weighing apparatus the pressure of the in-
closed vapor is ascertained. The results seem to be satisfactory. ( Wied.
Ann., XX1, 466; Am. J. Sci., November, 1884, III, xxvu1, 390.)

Meunier has modified the apparatus of Crafts and Meyer so as to ob-
tain with it, under greatly reduced pressure, the vapor density of certain
additional products of benzene which decompose at their boiling point
under the ordinary pressure. The results given agree closely with
theory. (C. R., xcviii, 1268, May, 1884.)

Clark has described an apparatus for the purification of mercury by
distillation, which differs from those hitherto suggested chiefly in being
supplied with the mercury to be distilled from a movable reservoir in
the form of a constant-level regulator, the raising of which fills the dis-
tiller with mercury, thus rendering unnecessary a Sprengel pump to
start the operation. The apparatus described will distill about two
pounds of mercury in an hour. (Phil. Mag., January, 1884, V, XvIt, 24.)

Many experiments have been made on the liquefaction of the so-called
permanent gases. Wroblewski has produced liquid oxygen in such
quantities as to use it as a refrigerating agent. When liquefied in large
quantity and allowed to evaporate briskly by the sudden removal of the
pressure, it does not solidify like carbon dioxide, though it deposits a
crystalline residue. Hitherto he has not found it possible to obtain
oxygen in a Stable liquid condition under the pressure of one atmos-
phere. Hence the objects to be cooled must be placed in the apparatus,
which is then filled with the liquid oxygen. By means of a thermo-
electric apparatus, controlled by a hydrogen thermometer between 100°
and —130°, the author estimates the temperature produced by boiling
oxygen at —186°. When nitrogen is compressed, cooled in boiling
oxygen, and then slightly released from pressure, it solidifies and falls
like snow, in crystals of remarkable size. (Phil. Mag., February, 1884,
V, XviiI, 158; Am. J. Sci., April, 1884, III, xxvit, 319.)

Dewar, in a lecture at the Royal Institution, produced and experi-
mented with 1.5 c. ¢. of liquid oxygen, prepared by an apparatus of great
simplicity. In an iron reservoir oxygen is compressed to 150 atmos-
pheres. A copper tube, on which is a manometer, connects this reser-
voir with a glass tube 5" diameter and 3” thick, in which the lique-
fied gas collects. This is inelosed in a glass tube containing the liquid
ethylene, solid carbon dioxide, or liquid nitrogen monoxide, which is to
be boiled in vacuo as the refrigerant. Outside of this is a larger tube,
through which the cold vapors pass on their way to the air-pump. When
the pump has reduced the pressure to 25™", the ethylene has a temper-
ature of about —140°; and then a pressure of between 20 and 30 at-
mospheres is sufficient to produce liquid oxygen in the tube. When
solid CO, is used, a temperature of —115° is obtained; and with liquid
N,0, one of —125°. As the critical point of oxygen is —113°, both

these refrigerants enable the condensation to liquefy the oxygen, pro-
vided the pressure is above 50 atmospheres. But it is convenient to
have a stop-cock attached to the tube, whereby a sudden expansion may
be effected and a lower temperature thus obtained. By knowing the
volume of the liquid oxygen and the corresponding volume of the gas-
eous oxygen, the density of the liquid may be obtained. <A rough ex-
periment gave Dewar 0.65 as the density near the critical point. As
early as 1883 Dewar had made experiments on liquefied marsh gas, and
pointed out the fact that the ratio of the critical temperature to the
critical pressure is proportional to the molecular volume, Hence, since
the critical temperature of marsh gas is less than —100°, and its crit-
ical pressure only 39 atmospheres, he believed he could approach the
absolute zero by its evaporation. In his paper he gives a valuable
table of the critical temperature, the critical pressure, and the ratio of
the two for 21 gases,in parallel columns. (Phil. Mag., September, 1834,
V, xviu, 210.)

Olszewski, using a hydrogen thermometer, has shown that under a
pressure of 1 atmosphere oxygen boils at —181°, and that when it evap-
orates under a pressure of 6™" of mercury the temperature is —198°.
But even this latter temperature was not sufficiently low to liquefy hy-
drogen, being above its critical temperature. Recourse was therefore
had to nitrogen. This gas, under a pressure of 60 atmospheres, cooled
to —142° by ethylene boiling in vacuo, liquefied, but showed no meniscus.
On diminishing the pressure to 35 atmospheres, the nitrogen boiled so
rapidly that it appeared white and opaque in the upper part of the tube.
Keeping the pressure at this point, the boiling ceased, the liquid became
clear and showed a well-pronounced meniscus. About 3 or 4 ¢. ¢. of
liquid were obtained, which evaporated slowly, increasing the pressure
until it reached 30.2 atmospheres, the critical pressure, when the menis-
cus disappeared. Exposed to the atmospheric pressure the liquid evap-
orated at first rapidly, then more slowly, the liquid remaining transpar-
ent, with no trace of the crystals observed by Wroblewski. Indeed, by
no sudden expansion could it be frozen. But when a sudden expansion
was produced with hydrogen in a tube placed within the liquid nitro-
gen, the pressure falling from 160 to 40 atmospheres, the hydrogen con-
densed as a colorless and transparent liquid, running down the walls of
the tube. An instant after, the outside of this tube became covered
with a white, opaque layer of solidified nitrogen, produced by the intense
cold given by the boiling hydrogen. Subsequently Olszewski employed
liquid ethylene under a pressure of 10"" of mercury and obtained a tem-
perature of —150°. He studied the temperatures obtained at various
pressures, as follows: At 750", —103°; at 546™", —105°; at 441™,
—108°; at 3416"", —111°; at 246", —115.5°; at 146", —122°; at 107",
—126°; at 72™™, --129.79; at 56™, —1329; at 31™, —139°; at 12™,
—148°; and at 9.8"",—150.4°. At this latter temperature the liquefaction
of several cubic centimeters of nitrogen presents no difficulties, it being
458 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR i884.

entirely unnecessary to use liquid oxygen. Studying nitrogen as above,
he obtained the following values of pressure and temperature: At 35 at-
mospheres (the critical pressure) the temperature was — 146° (the critical
temperature) ; at 31 atmospheres — 148.29; at 17 atmospheres —160.5° ;
at 1 atmosphere, —194.4;-and in vacuo, —2139. This, then, was the tem-
perature actually attained in the experiments with hydrogen above de-
eribed. The author differs from Wroblewski, since with oxygen boiling
under a pressure of only one atmosphere, and even under an expansion of
100 atmospheres, he obtained no trace of liquefaction with hydrogen. In-
deed, it was only with oxygen boiling in a vacuum, and hence giving a
lower temperature by 179, and under expansion of the gas compressed to
190 atmospheres, that the first trace of liquefaction appeared. The liquid
hydrogen enabled Dumas to say that it certainly was not a metal, as
many had been led to believe it would be. It was a colorless, transpar-
ent liquid. Continuing his researches, Olszewski next used air as the
refrigerant, having obtained 6 ¢.c. of it. The air was compressed in Nat-
terer’s apparatus and allowed to pass into a glass tube cooled to —142°
to —150° by means of ethylene. No meniscus was observed at 50 at-
mospheres, although this is superior to the critical pressure. On dimin-
ishing the pressure to 37.6 atmospheres, the air began to boil and the
meniscus appeared at once. This pressure is below the critical press-
ure, the meniscus disappearing at 39 atmospheres. The following are
the observed values of pressure and temperature for air: At the press-
ire of 39 atmospheres the temperature was —140° (the critical point);
at 33 atmospheres, —142°; at 27.5 atmospheres, —146°; at 20 atmos-
pheres, —152°; at 14 atmospheres, —158.5°; at 12.5 atmospheres,
—160.5°; at 6.8 atmospheres, —169°; at 4 atmospheres, —176; at 1 at-
mosphere, —191.4°; andin vacuo, —205°. Since the temperature under
which air boils in vacuo, calculated from that of oxygen, —198°, and ni-
trogen, —213°, differs considerably from —205°, it would seem that when
air is liquefied the relative proportion of its constituents is not pre-
served. (C. R., April, 1884, xovi11, 913; July, 1884, xcrx, 133, 184.)
Olszewski has liquefied carbon monoxide also, and has studied its prop-
erties. The gas was carefully purified from carbon dioxide, and com-
pressed to 70 atmospheres in Natterer’s pump, from whence it passed
to the apparatus used in liquefying oxygen and nitrogen. ‘The follow-
ing values were observed: Under the pressure of 35.5 atmospheres the
temperature was —139.5° (the critical temperature) ; at 25.7 atmospheres,
—145.3°; at 23.4 atmospheres, —147.7°; at 21.5 atmospheres, —148.8°;
at 20.4 atmospheres, 150.09; at 18.1 atmospheres, —152°; at 16.1 at-
mospheres, —154.4°; at 14.8 atmospheres, —155.79; at 6.3 atmospheres,
—168.2°; at 4.6 atmospheres, —172.6° ; at 1 atmosphere, —190°; and in
vacuo, —2119, the solidifying point. At temperatures between —139.5°
and —190° liquid carbon monoxide is colorless and transparent. In
vacuo the temperature falls to —211°, and it solidifies either in a snowy
mass, if the vacuum is rapidly made, or a compact, opaque mass, if the ;

process be slow. If it be so slow that the evaporation is allowed to
take place from the surface only, the solid mass is entirely transparent
Increasing the pressure to 1 atmosphere liquefies it. (C. &., October,
1884, xo1x, 706.)

In hygrometry, Jamin has called attention to the unsatisfactory char-

acter of the ratio os J being the elastic force of the vapor as observed

and F the maximum tension for that temperature, this ratio being called
the relative humidity, to express the quantity of vaporin the air. This
ratio varies with the proportion of vapor in the air, with the altitude
and the barometric pressure, and with the temperature. He therefore
proposes the ratio iS which measures the hygrometric composition
of the air. This value he calls the hygrometric richness. (J. Phys.,
November, 1884, II, 111, 469.)

Crova has pronounced in favor of the Saussure hair-hygrometer, and
says that, well made and with a good table of calibrated values, it
will give very satisfactory results, entirely comparable with those of
other instruments. He gives in his paper the details of a plan of gradu-
ating absorption instruments, which is simple and apparently accurate,
(J. Phys., September, 1884, IT, 111, 390.)

Pernter has made a series of psychrometrical observations on the
Obir, 6,722 feet above the sea-level, using Wild’s ventilation-hygrom-
eter, Regnault’s dew-point hygrometer, and Schwackhofer’s volumetric
hygrometer. The general result obtained is that an exact formula for
the psychrometer can scarcely be obtained, and that therefore we can-
not expect by means of the psychrometer to determine the pressure of
vapor to within 0.1". (Beiblitter der Physik, vut, 31; Phil. Mag., May,
1884, V, xv, 412.)

LIGHT.

1. Production and Velocity.

Lecher has made an experiment to determine whether the velocity ot
light is affected by the motion of a current in the medium. A beam
of light was divided into two parts, which, after passing through two
parallel glass troughs, were united by an interference prism, giving the
usual fringes. The troughs contained a strong solution of silver nitrate,
and, by means of suitable silver electrodes, an electric current of six
amperes strength was carried in opposite directions through the trough,
so that in one the electric current flowed in the same direction as the
light, and in the other in the opposite direction. But in no case was
any displacement of the fringes observed. Hence he concludes that
the velocity of light is not influenced by a current flowing through the
medium. (Nature, xxrx, 559, April, 1884.)

At the Electrical Congress held in Paris in April it was decided to
adopt the light emitted from a square centimeter of platinum at its
460 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

melting point as the photometric standard. This standard was sug-
gested by Violle, who has made many experiments, first with silver and
subsequently with platinum. Having assured himself that the radia-
tion from silver was constant during solidification, he proposed as the
absolute unit of light the radiation emitted by a square centimeter of
surface of melted platinum at the temperature of solidification. The
platinum must be perfectly pure and must be melted in a lime crucible.
By means of a diaphragm blackened on its surface, having a square
opening, it is easy to obtain a beam of definite’ cross-section. When
the measurement is to be made, the gas is shut off and the liquid metal
is allowed to cool. This, which is at first rapid, becomes slower and
slower, becoming finally stationary. Then a “lightening” passes over
the surface, and the cooling continues. The moment of measurement
is at the instant when the temperature is stationary. By continuing
the flow of gas, instead of cutting it entirely off, this point may be pre-
served for a longer time. The author has compared the light thus ra-
diated with that of a standard carcel lamp, first, when the light was
emitted by the platinum at an angle of 45°, and, second, when it was
emitted normally and reflected from a mirror at 45°. The photometer
used in the first comparisons was the Rumford instrument, as used in
the light-house service ; in the second, besides this instrument, a Fou-
cault photometer was used, of the form used in testing officially the gas
supplied to Paris. By the first method the light emitted by the plati-
num was 2.118 carcels; by the second, 2.079 for series 1, group A, and
2.077 for group B, series 2 giving 2.077. The mean of the whole is 2.08
earcels. Assuming the flame of the carcel lamp to have 5.25 sq.
em. of surface, an equal surface of platinum would emit 2.08 x 5.25,
or 10.92 careels. The intrinsic-intensity of the platinum standard is
then 11 times that of the carcel lamp. Comparisons were also made
with a Swan incandescent lamp, the ight emitted by it under known
current conditions having been carefully determined. The mean of
these comparisons gave 2.069 carcels. (C. &., April, 1884, xcvii, 1032;
J. Phys., June, 1884, I], m1, 241; Phil. Mag., June, 1884, V, xvi, 563;
Am. J. Sei., July, 1884, II, xxvii, 72.)

Werner Siemens has contrived an apparatus for putting the above
unit into practice, although it determines the light emitted by plat-
inum at its melting point and not at its solidifying point. A very thin
platinum plate is inciosed in a metallic case provided with a hole 0.1
sq. cm. in section, which is immediately over the metal. The sides
about the hole are inclined toward it, the platinum plate being consider-
ably larger. At the instant of melting, the light radiated through
the opening is 0.1 of the standard. By suitable arrangements the
current may be modifled and controlled so as to produce the melting
at will when the comparison is to be made. Preliminary experiments
show that the light emitted is about 1.5 standard candles. (Wied. Ann.,
xXx1, 304; Am. J. Sci., August, 1884, III, xxvii, 150.)
PHYSICS. 461

_ Weber has described a photometer depending upon equal visual acute-
ness, the two sources of light which are to be compared being made to
illuminate two similar halves of a glass plate on which are photographed
concentric circles very close together. The advantage claimed for this
method is the facility which it gives of comparing a diffuse light with
a standard, or even two lights of different colors with one another. In
the latter case the observation is facilitated by the use of a red glass.
(Wied. Ann., XX, 326; J. Phys., March, 1884, II, 111, 143.)

Wild has shown that his polarizing photometer may be converted
into a spectrophotometer by interposing an Amici prism between the
double-image prism and the polariscope. The slit is placed close to the
terminal faces of the total-reflection prisms. <A collimating Jens is
placed against the Foucault prism. Under these conditions each of
the sources of light shows a channeled spectrum, the bands being alter-
nate in the two. Hence when the spectra are superposed, the fringes
disappear. for one particular portion of the spectrum. A slit attached
to the eye-piece, movable by a micrometer screw, serves to limit the re-
gion in which the measures are taken. (Wied. Ann., xx, 452; J. Phys.,
March, 1884, II, 11, 142.)

Crova has pointed out that the complete determination of the photo-
metric value of a powerful light requires: first, a comparison of two
lights of differing colors; second, an estimation of the color by means of a
numerical factor; and, third, the determination of the photometric ratio
between avery intense light and a relatively feeble standard. The first
point he solves by the use of a solution consisting of 22.321 grams of
ferric chloride and 27.191 grams crystallized nickel chloride, dissolved
in distilled water to a volume of 100 c. ¢. at 15°, which is placed between
the eye and the screen. <A thickness of 7" of this solution allows rays
of wave-length 630 to 534, only to pass, the limiting value being 580

which is the best for solar photometry. The second point is attained
by making two successive determinations by means of the spectropho-
tometer—one through the above solution, giving the intensity ratio;
the other through a red glass colored with cuprous oxide, which allows
rays from 726 to 752, to pass, and which gives a ratio as much be-
low the former one as the light is whiter than the earcel. The quotient
of the first ratio by the second is a constant which fixes the color,
having a higher value as the light is whiter, and is equal to unity when
the light has the same color as the carcel. For an incandescent lamp
it varies from 1.05 to 1.23, and for the are 1.5 to 1.7. The third point
requires a special photometer. (C. &., December, 1884, xcrx, 1067.)

Crova has subsequently described this instrument, which he calls a

‘diffusion photometer. On a plate of ground or of opal glass, or on a
Foucault screen, acting as a diffuser, a uniform luminous field is thrown,
the incident rays falling normally. Each of the points of the plate may
be considered as a luminoxws source, and sends back of the screen an
amount of light dependipg on the character of the screen and varying
462 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

with the angle of emission, though in a nearly normal direction the
rays have the same intensity. Behind the diffuser an opaque screen is
fixed, furnished witha variable slit. Theamount of light passing through
this opening is proportional to the extent of the luminous field covered
by it, to a coefficient depending on the diffuser itself, to the area of the
opening, and to the inverse square of the distance. By means of such
a photometer the author has determined the sun’s light to be equal to
7,500 carcels, that of the Serrin lamp used by him being 230 to 320
earcels. The coefficient of his diffuser is the value in earcels of the ~
field in which the diffuser should be placed in order that 1 sq. cm. of
its surface should emit the light of one carcel. Thus a ground glass of
400 carcels is a glass 1 sq. em. ef which placed in a field of 400 carcels
emits alight of 1. (C. R., December, 1884, xcrx, 1115.)

McLeod has proposed a new sunshine-recorder, consisting of a camera
so fixed that its axis is parallel to the polar axis of the earth, the lens
pointing northward. Opposite the lens a silvered sphere is placed, from
which the rays of the sun are reflected through the lens of the camera
on to the sensitive paper, on which a distorted image of the sun is formed,
the positions of the lens and sphere being so arranged that the image
is a linear and radial one. By the motion of the earth the solar image
is carried over a circular are, and traces a curve on the sensitive paper.
The ordinary ferricyanide paper is employed, and the instrument is
sufficiently sensitive to register gleams of sunshine and also the pas-
sage of small clouds. Radial lines are drawn from the center of the cir-
cular band, 15° apart, to serve as hour lines. (Phil. Mag., August, 1884,

2. Reflection and Refraction.

Basso has studied the phenomena of reflection from crystalline sur-
faces, using a Bunsen photometer illuminated on one side by sunlight
which has traversed orange-yellow glass, and is polarized in a suitable
azimuth by means of a Nicol prism, reflected to the screen from the
crystalline face to be studied, the other side receiving the light from a
disk of ground glass, illuminated by a petroleum lamp. The crystal
used was a plate of Iceland spar, cut perpendicularly to the axis. The
intensity of the light reflected from the spar was calculated for various
angies of incidence and for various azimuths of polarization. For azi-
muth 0 the formulas become those of Fresnel. Assuming the value
for this azimuth and rotating the Nicol, the intensity may be determined
for various azimuths by varying the distance of the lamp from the disk.
The results are in fair accord with theory. (I! Nuovo Cimento, Xtv, 5;
J. Phys., December, 1884, II, 111, 558.)

Conroy has communicated to the Royal Society the results of his
measurements of the amount of polarized light reflected by metallic
surfaces, He used mirrors of steel and of speculum metal, highly pol-
ished, the incident light being polarized by a Nicol prism. The experi
Ore! ate el =

ments appear to show that the generally received formulas for metal-
lic reflection are approximately correct, but that the actual intensity of
the reflected light is always less than the theoretical intensity. Hence,
unless the surfaces be defective, these formulas do not express the laws
of metallic reflection. If, as appears to be the case, a change in the re-
flective power of a plate can occur without any change in the values of
the principal incidence and azimuth, the formulas must be regarded
as only approximately true, and there is additional reason for thinking,
with Stokes, that three constants are required to define a metal optic.
ally. (Nature, February, 1884, xx1x, 398.)

Gouy bas studied the light diffused from depolished glass and metal
surfaces. The apparatus consisted of a mirror and attached polarizer,
by which a beam of light polarized in any plane could be thrown at
any incidence upon the roughened plate, placed horizontally. The dif-
fused light was observed by means of a polariscope. Taking a plate
of ordinary ground glass, the incident ray being polarized in a plane
perpendicularly to the plane of incidence, and the angle of incidence
being 60°, he finds that there are two neutral directions, making an
angle of 47° with the normal to the plate and symmetrically situated
with reference to plane of incidence, so that that plane which contains
either of them and the normal makes an angle of 22° with the plane of
incidence. On the one side of the incident plane the light is circularly
or elliptically polarized in the right handed direction, and on the other
side left-handed, while in the plane of incidence it is plane polarized.
If, however, the incident light is polarized in the plane of incidence,
the two neutral directions still exist, and are symmetrical with refer-
ence to this plane, but are otherwise quite different from those just de-
scribed. The two angles are 77° and 95°, respectively, and the gyration
of the rays is inverted, so that the right and left handed rays have
changed sides. (C. R., April, 1884, xcvi1t, 978.)

Dufet has examined the influence exerted by temperature on the re-
fractive index of quartz, studying, first, the variation of the double refrac-
tion, and, second, the variation of the ordinary and extraordinary indices.
The quartz used was a rectangular parallelopipedon, 14.07°" in the
direction of the axis and 14.614"™" in the perpendicular direction. The
refractive indices taken were those of Mascart, and the expansion co-
efficients those of Benoit. The variation of the double refraction was
measured by the displacement of Fizeau’s and Foucault’s fringes, and
that of the two indices by the displacement of Talbot’s bands. He finds
that the indices of both rays diminish with the temperature by values
considerably above those of Fizeau. (CO. R., May, 1884, xcviml, 1265;
J. Phys., June, 1884, I, m1, 251.)

Bauerwald has determined the refractive indices of rutite, the speci-
men being a remarkably transparent crystal from Syssert, in the Ural,
cut into a prism of 25°. The ordinary index for the lithium line was
2.5671, for the sodium line 2.6158, and for the thallium line 2.6725, The
464 - SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

extraordinary index for these three lines was 2.8415, 2.9029, and 2.9817,
respectively. The only minerals having higher indices are zigueline,
red silver, and cinnabar. (Zeitschr. Kryst. &@ Min., vir, 167; J. Phys.,
February, 1884, II, 11, 105.)

Soret has determined the refractive indices of the alums for the eight
principal lines of the spectrum. He used seven alumina alums, four

chrome alums, five iron alums, two gallium alums, and an indium alum,

(C. R., November, 1884, xcrx, 867.)

Quincke has investigated the change which takes place in the volumes
and refractive indices of liquids when subjected to hydrostatic press-
ure. The liquids were contained in glass or metal tubes 230™ long,
which were placed in an interference apparatus. One of the two inter.
fering pencils traversed the liquid, and by measuring the number of in-
terference bands which corresponded to a given Fraunhofer line, before
and after the pressure was applied, the change in the index could be
calculated. He draws the conclusion that at constant temperature and
varying hydrostatic pressure, the specific refraction, at least for the
liquids examined, which is n —1~<s, is equal toa constant; in other
words, the decimals of the refractive index are proportional to the den-
sity. (Phil. Mag., January, 1884, V, xvIl, 65.)

Shaw has described a means of verifying the phenomena of refraction
by the prism, especially the focal lines, by using a piece of wire gauze
as the object, placed so that one set of wires is horizontal and the other
vertical, and illuminated by a sodium flame behind it. If the light pass
directly from the gauze to the prism, the focal lines are of course vir-
tual, but they may be easily viewed and their positions identified by
means of a telescope which will focus an object at a short distance. For
one position of the eye-piece of the telescope the vertical wires are seen
distinctly, but not the horizontal wires; while for another position these
latter may be seen, but the former ones are not visible unless the prism
is at minimum deviation. The experiment is more striking if the foal
lines be made real by interposing between the gauze and the prism
a convex lens of somewhat long focus. The vertical and horizontal
images may then be viewed by means of an ordinary magnifier, or, bet-
ter, by a telescope eye piece placed behind a second gauze, withits wires
at 45° to the vertical. In this way the images corresponding to the two
focal lines can be seen very clearly, and their distances from the prism
accurately measured. If the prism be placed first in the position of
minimum deviation, and the magnifier be focused upon the image of the
gauze, both horizontal and vertical wires are seen sharply defined. On
gradually turning the prism the vertical lines disappear completely.
If the eye-piece be drawn back some way, a badly defined image of the
gauze can be obtained, corresponding to the circles of least confusion;
and on withdrawing the eye-piece still farther, the horizontal wires dis-
appear entirely, while the vertical ones come out sharply as a set of bars
across a uniform field. (Nature, December, 1884, XXx1, 185.)
PHYSICS. 465

Haycraft has described the model of a lens which he has used sue-
cessfully in his lectures. It consists of a piece of deal board cut in the
shape of the cross-section of a double-convex lens, and mounted so as
to stand vertical. Four small squares of board are fixed on the two
sides of this model, near the top and bottom, so that they can move
about a center. To each of these a glass tube bent at an obtuse angle is
fastened, and strings passing through these tubes represent the visual
rays. (Nature, October, 1884, xxx, 543.)

od, Dispersion and Color.

Demar¢ay has pointed out the advantage of employing in spectrum
work an induction coil having a shorter and larger secondary wire than
isusual. His coil gives a spark only about 5™™ long, though it is 11.5¢
in diameter and 25 long. The primary and secondary wires are both
1m” in diameter, but the latter is nearly three times as long as the
former and the coil has three times the usual condensing surface. The
spark, though short, is quite thick, its aureole being 3" in diameter.
For the examination of liquids the author uses a sort of wick made of
platinum wires twisted together and then rolled into a cirele, with one
end rising out of the middle. This is placed in the small dish contain-
ing the solution to be examined, and the spark, which need not be
more than one fourth to one-half a willimeter, is passed to the upright
end from a positive electrode of large wire. (C. &., December, 1884,
XOIx, 1022, 1069.) :

- Thoilon has published an illustrated monograph of the line, or rather
the group, D of the solar spectrum, as observed with his new compound
prism. He gives for comparison the group as observed by Huggins in
1863, by Campbell in 1865, by Russell in 1877, by Vogel in 1879, by
Gassiot in 1863, by Cooke in 1866, by Fiéves in 1882, and by Cornu in
1884. The last two were obtained by means of a Rutherfurd grating.
The author’s spectroscope separates the components proper of the line
Dby12 minutes. Between these extremes this instrument shows twelve
sharply defined lines, the wave-iengths of which are given. Of these
nine are telluric, produced by some variable constituent of our atmos-
phere, moisture probably. Two are not teiluric, the one belonging to
nickel, the other to an unknown element. The last seems to possess
the characteristics of both, and hence the author concludes must be
made up of two components superposed, one telluric, the other metallic.
A drawing is given showing the appearance of this group, first, when the
eastern limb of the sun is on the slit, and, second, when the western
limb is so placed. The displacement of the solar lines and the non-dis-
placement of the tellurice ones are marked. (J. Phys., January, 1884, IT,
II, 5.)

Cornu has published a valuable memoir on the group « of the solar
spectruin, having devised an exceedingly ingenious method of distin
guishing at a glance solar froin telluric lines, On the slit of the col-

limator a small image of the solar disk is projected by means ef an
achromatic lens of 10 or 12 inches focus. On causing now this lens'to
oscillate rapidly two or three times per second, so as to bring the two
opposite edges of the disk alternately on the slit, the lines of solar ori-
gin oscillate with the lens, while those which are telluric remain fixed.
Moreover, a singular illusion appears: the trembling lines seem to stand

~ out in relief, and to oscillate in front of the fixed ones. By means of -

this neat device the author has determined the group a to consist of
three entirely distinct sets of lines: first, those which are solar, and of
which twenty-five are figured; second, those which are due to the dry at-
mosphere (the structure and grouping of these lines strikingly recalls
that of the groups A and B; and since Egoroff has shown these latter
to be due to oxygen, it is probable that the former are due to the same
element); and, third, lines due to aqueous vapor, of which only a few are
given. (J. Phys., March, 1884, II, m1, 109.)

Thollon has also -described and figured with minute accuracy the
seventeen lines which constitute the group B of Fraunhofer, arranging
them in four sections: First, when the sun is at 80° from the zenith; sec-
ond, when the sun is 60° from the zenith, air damp ; third, when the sun
is 60° from the zenith, air dry; and, fourth, lines not of telluric origin.
Egoroft’s discovery that this group is due to oxygen mainly, disposes of
most of the lines. The others are due to solar absorption and to atmos-
pheric moisture. (J. Phys., October, 1884, II, 1, 421.)

Egoroff has exhibited before the physical section of the Russian
Physico-Chemical Society the production of the Fraunhofer lines A and
B by passing the rays from a calcium light through a layer of dry oxy-
gen 20 meters long, under a pressure of 8 atmospheres. (J. Phys., Oc-
tober, 1884, II, m1, 467.)

Liveing and Dewar have investigated the production of spectrum
lines of the metals developed by exploding gases. Observing the flash
of a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen gases, exploded in a Cavendish
eudiometer, in the spectroscope, the authors were struck with the bright-
ness of the lines not only of sodium but also of calcium, and were thereby
led to make a series of experiments in iron tubes, half aninch in diameter
and 3 feet long, closed at one end by quartz plates held in place by
means of ascrew-cap. The stronger iron lines were distinctly seen,
and so various substances in powder were introduced into the tube.
In the case of lithium, when the mixture was fired at the remote end of
the tube, so that the flame traveled toward the slit, the red line was re-
versed, a fine dark line being visible in the middle of the band; thus
proving that there are gradations of temperature in the flame, the front
of the advancing wave being somewhat cooler than the following part.
Sixty iron lines in the indigo, violet, and ultra-violet developed in this
way were pho‘ographed. Other metallic salts were introduced into the
tube, and also other gaseous mixtures. (Phil. Mag., September, 1884, V,
Xvi, 161; Nature, April, 1884, xx1rx, 614.)

PILYSICS. 467

H. Becquerel has_examined the emission-spectra of metallic vapors
iu the infra-red region, making use of a suitable phosphorescent sub-

stance, previously rendered luminous by insolation, as the screen for

receiving these spectra. Under the influence of the infra-red rays a
temporary excitation preceding extinction is developed, and the lines
otherwise invisible appear brilliant. Certain of these phosphorescent

powders, notably calcium sulphide, were so sensitive as to allow the wave-

lengths of the more brilliant lines of potassium, sodium, and cadmium
to be determined at once by means of a Rutherfurd grating. In other
cases the spectra were obtained by means of a carbon disulphide prism,
the wave-lengths being determined byinterpolation. The wave-lengths
of 4 lines of potassium, 1 of sodium, 5 of strontium, 2 of calcium, 4 of mag-
nesium, 2 of aluminum, 2 of zinc, 1 of cadmium, 5 of lead, 2 of silver,
2 of tin, and 1 each of bismuth and thallium are given. (C. R., XCrx,
374, August, 1884; Phil. Mag., October, 1884, V, xv111, 386; Am. J. Sci.,
December, 1884, III, xxvuit, 457.)

Becquerel has applied the same method to the investigation of the
infra-red region of the solar spectrum. A beam of light reflected from
a diffraction grating was concentrated by a lens and traversed a ¢ar-
bon disulphide prism whose sides were normal to the slit and the lines
of the grating, and formed on the phosphorescent surface a series of
oblique spectra, in which the radiations with spectra of different orders
were juxtaposed and not superposed. The slit was so narrow that the
principal lines of the luminous spectra could be seen, so that by com-
paring the lines and bands in the infra-red of the first spectrum with

the known lines of the second and third their wave-lengths could be

obtained. The author claims that this method allows of. a further ex-
ploration than the photographic one, and is not exceeded by the bolom-
eter or thermopile. Indeed, if the phosphorescent agent is sensitive,
the details can be made out far better than with the bolometer. The
wave-lengths measured are given in the paper. (C. R&., xorx, 417, Sep-
tember, 1884; Phil. Mag., November, 1884, V, xvi, 465; Am. J. Sci.,
III, xxviun, 391, 459.)

Soret and Sarasin, members of a commission appointed by the Natural
History Society of Geneva to study the properties of the water of their
lake, have observed a distinct absorption band in its speetrum, which

is visible when the light passes through a layer of the water only 2™

in thickness. This band is a little less refrangible than D, being
located in the orange, about one-fifth the distance between D and ©,
corresponding to a wave-length of about 600. This band was observed
in distilled water even when carefully purified by distillation with per-
manganate in a vessel of platinum. (C. R., March, 1884, xcviu, 624.)

Soret has published a later paper, in which the question of the color of
water is discussed with especial reference to the color of the Lake of
Geneva. (J. Phys., October, 1884, I], 111, 427.)

Abney and Festing have shown that, when light traverses a thick-

ness of 2™™ of a solution of iodine in carbon disulphide containing
4 per cent. of iodine, a photograph of its spectrum proves the non-
absorbed light to consist of two bands, one beginning near G and termi-
nating in the ultra-violet, the other including the infra-red and extend-
ing toa point near D. As the richness of the solution in iodine increases
up to 32 per cent., the former of these bands narrows from both ends,
finally becoming a mere strip near h, while the latter contracts toward
the red, the extreme red not being reached by the absorption. This
solution, therefore, is very useful in the study of these regions of the
spectrum. (Proc. Roy. Soc., XxxIv, 480; J. Phys., March, 1884, II, 1,
145.)

The absorption of the ultra-violet rays by different media has been
made the subject of investigation by several physicists. Liveing and
Dewar employed as a source of light an induction spark between iron
points, a condenser being in circuit, the iron lines furnishing points of
reference. The prisms, lenses, and tanks used were of quartz or of
rock salt, and the absorbing bodies tried were chlorine, bromine, iodine,
sulphurous oxide, hydrogen sulphide, carbon disulphide and tetrachlo-
ride, chlorine tetroxide, chrome alum, mica, silver, gold, Iceland spar,
&c. The spectra were photographed. (Proc. Roy. Soc., Xxxv, 71; J.
Phys., May, 1884, LL, m1, 218.) ;

Soret used a revolving spark-carrier, consisting of two disks, whose
‘axes were at right angles, and whose circumferences carried different
metals for producing the spark. ‘The liquid whose absorptive effect
was to be studied was contained in a glass vessel closed at bottom
by a quartz plate, and the light of the spark, after being rendered par-
allel by a quartz lens, passed through this liquid, the thickness of which
was varied by the immersion in it of a glass tube having quartz plates
at the ends. Beneath this colorimeter was a spectroscope with a fluo-
rescent eye-piece. After determining the thickness of a liquid required

‘to extinguish any of the metal lines, the author constructed curves
having the deviations of these lines as abscissas and the thicknesses of
the layers as ordinates, and thus obtained curves for the comparison
of the absorption of the substances used. (J. Phys., July, 1884, IL, 111,
311.)

Atmospheric absorption has received considerable attention. Lang-
ley read a paper before the National Academy, in which he showed that
the ordinarily assumed coefficient, about 20 per cent., was too low prob-
ably by an amount equal at least to the whole amount in question.
The cause of this lies in the assumption by Bouguer’s formula, employed
by Herschel, Pouillet, and others, that the coefficient of transmission
through the atmosphere is a constant. That this is impossible follows
from the composite character of the radiation, as Melloni long ago proved.
¥rom his own reasoning, founded upon the best data he has been able
to obtain, the author believes the actual mean absorption of sun and
starlight to be not improbably over 40 per cent, at the sea level, (Am,

Abney and Festing, by photographing the infra-red solar spectrum
under different atmospheric conditions, have shown that when the air
is nearly saturated with moisture this part of the spectrum is covered
by a dark band extending to wave-length 8330. In a very dry time
the band extends only from wave-length 9800 to wave-length 9420. At
a great altitude, with a cold northeast wind, this band disappears
almost entirely, but can be reproduced by placing a suitable thickness
of water before the slit. These photographs serve as indicators of at-
mospheric moisture. (Proc. Roy. Soc., Xxxv, 80; J. Phys., May, 1884,
II, 111, 219.)

Nichols has studied the character of the light reflected from pigments
by means of a spectrophotometer, in which one-half of the slit is cov-
ered by a right-angled prism, the other half by a Nicol prism, while the
eye end of the observing telescope is furnished with a second Nicol and an
adjustable diaphragm. By these means two spectra, one above the other,
are produced, the lower one polarized in a vertical plane. In order to

compare the spectrum of the light reflected by any object with the

spectrum of daylight, the object is placed beneath the reflecting prism,
and illuminated either by direct sunlight or diffused daylight. Sky-
light reflected through the Nicol gives the polarized spectrum, and by
rotating the Nicol in the eye-piece it may be given any intensity re-
quired. Whatever be the character of the light reflected by the object
to be studied, it is always possible to find a position of this Nicol for
which any region of the spectrum under observation and the corre-
sponding wave-length of the polarized spectrum are equally bright.
Knowing the angle between the principal sections of the Nicols, the in-
tensity of this region, in terms of the intensity of the corresponding

wave-length in the spectrum of daylight, can be calculated. The au-

thor examined in this way red lead, chrome yellow, chrome green (chro-
mic oxide), and artificial ultramarine, and gives the results in tabulated
form and in the form of curves. (Am. J. Sci., November, 1884, ITI,
XXVIII, 342.) ;

Rosenstiehl has made a valuable contribution to the science of color
in a little book published by the Société Industrielle of Rouen, intended
to show the imperfection of methods founded on the study of coloring
matters in distinction from‘those which recognize color simply as a prop-
erty of matter, and, in the physiological sense, as simply an affection
of the organ of sight. Attention is specially directed to the study of
color by means of color sensations; and it is shown that it is to the
analysis and synthesis of the retinal impressions that we are to look for
exact views on the relationships of the colors. For the investigation
of colors the author uses concentric disks rapilly rotated. These disks
are divided into sectors of different magnitudes, variously colored.
For the white disk barium sulphate is used, applied to a suitable sur-

face. It revolves in front of a small chamber lined with black velvet,
and the proportion of black to white is determined by the size of the
sector cut from the white disk. (Nature, November, 1884, xxxXI, 58.)

Hoffert has devised a new apparatus for producing color combinations,

which consists of a flat box irregularly hexagonal in shape, on one side
of which six prisms are placed, arranged in two pairs and all! set at the
angle of minimum deviation. The first prisms have their refracting
edges in contact, and, by means of a screen in which is a small rectangu-
lar aperture, small equal strips of the adjacent faces of these prisms are
visible from an eye-piece which is simply a tube of brass in which is
a slit one-tenth of an inch wide. If light entered through the eye:

piece, each set of the prisms would deviate it about 150°, one to the

right, the other to the left, and each beam would then fall on.a lens of
about 10-inches focal length, the two spectra thus produced being
brought to a focus on the sides of the box immediately to the right and
left of the eye-piece. At these points, on each side, are placed three in-
candescent wires; sothat, conversely, if these be the sources of light, the
rays follow an inverse course, and the corresponding half of the aperture
in the screen is seen illuminated with a color which will depend on the
position of the incandescent wire. (Phil. Mag., August, 1884, V, XVIII,
81.)

4. Interference and Polarization.

Kissling has mvestigated the influence which foreign admixtures
exert on the formation of fog in moist air, in the course of which he has
observed a series of diffraction phenomena, the law of whose formation
can only with difficulty be made to agree with Fraunhofer’s law. He
finds that in general the law of Aitken is true, and that when aqueous
vapor is condensed in the air it always takes place on some nucleus.
In the ordinary unfiltered air of a dwelling-room, when the space in
which diffraction occurs is but slightly cooled, the fog is so strong that
it greatly enfeebles even a powerful source of light. If this air be
gradually admixed with filtered air, the formation of fog gradually di-
minishes, while at the same time phenomena of diffraction set in, the in-
tensity of whose color increases until the quantity of vapor has sunk to
a definite though extremely small amount. Small admixtures of sul-
phurous oxide and of ammonia with the unfiltered air of a room pro-
duce so strong a fog that any action of diffraction ceases. (Phil.
Mag., August, 1884, V, xvi, 160.)

Madan has called attention to a simple method of producing the in-
terference phenomena known as Ohm’s fringes. Ohm himself directs
that two »lates of equal thickness are to be cut from a uniaxial crystal,
their parallel surfaces making an angle of 45° with the optic axis. If
now one of these be placed on the other in such a position that the optic
-axes lie in the same plane but upon opposite sides of the normal common
to the twe plates, and the combination be held in a convergent beam of

monochromatic plano polarized light, numerous alternations of bright
and dark elliptical bands are seen, most distinctly when the plane con-
taining the optic axes makes an angle of 45° with the plane of polar-
ization of the light. Since in Iceland spar the natural faces of the
rhombohedron make an angle of nearly 45° with the optic axis, Madan
suggests the use of a simple cleavage plate, 2 by 1™ in size and 2™™
thick, broken in halves, and one half turned round 180°, superposed on
the other, and cemented with Canada balsam. On placing this on the
eye-lens of a microscope, with the analyzer just above it, the ellipses will
be well seen when sodium lightis used. (Nature, November, 1884, xxxt,
83.)

Macé de Lepinay has shown that the graphic method of Cornu may
be applied with great facility to the study of the diffraction fringes pro-
duced by an opaque rod, by means of an auxiliary curve, which is the
same in all cases, since it is only the primitive spiral displaced par- |
allel toitself by a fixed quantity. (J. Phys., January, 1884, II, m1, 11.)

Hartley has described a simple method of observing faint lines with
diffraction spectroscopes. The operation is conducted in a darkened
room, the goniometer of the spectroscope being illuminated by a shaded
lamp placed on the right of the telescope. The grating is movable,
the collimator and telescope being fixed so as to include as small an
angle between them as possible. The telescope being to the right of
the collimator, a small gas-jet is placed on the left, the rays of which
are reflected into the telescope from the grating. By the adjustment of
this light the field may be illuminated with any color of the spectrum,
and by selecting that tint which is complementary to the color of the
lines to be measured they are sure to stand out, apparently, in relief on
a bright ground. (Nature, March, 1884, xx1x, 470.)

Mertching, under Egoroft’s direction, has determined experimentally
the focal distances for monochromatic light of a reflecting grating of
Rutherfurd having 17,296 lines in an inch, for all incidences. In the
spectra of the first and the second order the variations of the focal dis-
tances of the images situated to the right of the reflected image of the
slit were inconsiderable, while those on the left were much greater and
of contrary sign. The results, represented graphically, give a curve in
which the focal distance is a function of the angle of deviation, and
which the author regards as a variety of the hyperbola of the second
degree. (J. Phys., October, 1884, II, 111, 459.)

Bucking has submitted crystals to pressure, with the view of deter-
mining the influence thus exerted on their double refraction. The crystal
plate is placed on the stage of a polarizing microscope, pressure being
exerted by a screw and measured by a dynamometer. In the case of
apatite, for example, the angle between the axes, in the plane parallel
to the direction of the pressure, but before the pressure was applied,
was 3°. The plate used was 5™ square and 4" thick, and the press-
ure varied from 0 to 100 pounds. ‘The angle between the axes became

zero for a pressure of 6 pounds, equal to 10° for a pressure of 33 pounds,
and to 17° for one of 100 pounds. After the removal of the pressure
the angle between the axes was 5° in the primitive plane, and did not
vary on repeating the experiment. Beryl gave no permanent variation.
Vitreous orthoclase, whose axesare either in the plane of symmetry or
perpendicular to it, shows, under pressure perpendicular to this plane,
an increase of the angle in this plane and a decrease in the perpendic-
ular plane. (J. Phys., February, 1884, II, 111, 106.)

Von Fleischl has communicated to the Vienna Academy the dis-
covery of double-refracting liquids. The apparatus used was a com-
pound hollow prismresembling, in general, Fresnel’s quartz combination.
Concentrated solutions of tartaric acid and of various sugars were em-
ployed, and also certain optically active oils. These doubly refracting
liquids possess no optic axis, and the wave surfaces are in every instance
two concentric spheres. (Nature, January, 1885, xxx, 204.)

Rontgen has published a valuable memoir on the variation of the
double refraction of quartz. produced by electric force. Pressure ex-.
periments show that in a crystal of quartz of normal structure the sur-
face of « section normal to the principal axis may be divided into six
fields by lines intersecting at an angle of 60°. A pressure exerted in,
any direction passing through this point develops contrary electricities
at its extremities. When a fragment of quartz is submitted to electric
induction, so that the lines of force, without being parallel to an axis of
no pressure-electricity, are normal to the principal axis, the natural
polarization is modified by the action of the electric forces, and at the
same time the double refraction of the rays normal to the principal axis
and to the lines of force is increased or diminished according to the di-
rection of the lines of force. These results are of importance in connec:
tion with the theory of pyroelectricity proposed by Sir. W. Thomson.
( Wied. Ann., XVIII, 213; J. Phys., Jannary, 1884, II, 111, 35.)

Two new forms of polarizing prism have appeared, one contrived by
Feussner and theother by Bertrand. Sleeman has described the former,
giving at the same time an illustrated account of the various polarizing
prisms -thus far proposed, six in number. The prism of Feussner con-
sists of a thin plate of a doubly refracting crystal cemented between
two wedge-shaped pieces of glass, the terminal faces of which are normal
to their length. The refractive indices of the glass and the cementing
medium should correspond with the greater index of the crystals and
the directions of greatest and least elasticity in the latter must stand in a
plane perpendicular to the direction of the section. One great advan-
tage of this prism is that other crystalline substances may be used in-
stead of cale spar, provided the difference between the ordinary and the
exiraordinary index is greater than in ecale spar. Feussner has used
for this purpose a plate of sodium nitrate, whose indices are 1.587 and
1.336. In this, as in cale spar, cleavage plates may be used. Asa

lene was used, having an index of 1.58. (Zeitschr. f. Inst.-Kunde, Feb-
ruary, 1884, Iv, 42; Nature, xxix, 514, March, 1884.)

Bertrand constructs his prism by taking a prism of flint glass of index
1.658 and cutting it along a plane making an angle of 76° 43/ 8” with
the terminal faces. These new faces are polished and cemented with a
substance of index equal or superior to 1.658, placing between these
surfaces a cleavage prisin of cale spar suitably adjusted. A ray of light
falling on the prism enters it and is incident on the plate of calcite,
which divides it into two, polarized in planes at right angles to each
other. The ordinary ray, whose index is 1.658, continues its part in a
direct line; but the extraordinary ray, whose index is less, does not
enter the sparat all. In this way a polarizing prism is produced which
has a field of 44° 46’ 20’. ‘This prism closely resembles that of Feuss-
ner above described. (C. R&., September, 1884, xcrx, 538.)

ELECTRICITY.
1. Magnetism.

The magnetic moment of a bundle of iron wires has been frequently
compared with that of an iron cylinder, but the influence of the diame-
ter of the wire seems not to have been studied. Bakmetieff has filled
the core of a cylindrical coil, 148"" long and 32.2™™ in interior diame-
ter, with iron wires of 1", of 2™™ and of 5™ diameter, and magnetized
them by more or less intense currents. The magnetic moment of the
bundle of the finest wires, as well as its specific magnetism, was notably
superior to that of the two others, especially for intense magnetizing
currents. But when, instead of filling all the space within the coil with
the wire, only an annular layer of wire was placed within it, the spe-
cific magnetism of the fine wire, for the same current, was many times
greater than that of the larger wires. (J. Soc. Phys. Chim. Russe, Xv,
142; J. Phys., October, 1884, II, 111, 463.) ;

According to Auerbach, an iron cylinder free from magnetism re-
ceives from a magnetizing force a normal magnetic moment correspond-
ing to that force, and which is measured by the current induced during
its development. Bakmetieff new shows that this law does not apply
to iron already possessing remanent magnetisnr. His experiments
show that for electro-magnets not forming a closed magnetic circuit
the normal magnetism has for its measure the arithmetical mean of the
two induced currents obtained by closing the magnetizing circuit, di-
rectly and inversely. For a closed circular electro-magnet the normal
magnetism has double this value. (J. Soc. Phys. Chim. Russe, XV, 173;
J. Phys., October, 1884, II, m1, 464.)

Some time ago Quincke showed that electric foree produces a press-
ure upon insulating liquids placed in an electric field. He has now
extended his investigation to magnetic and diamagnetic fluids placed
in a magnetic field. Calling the diamagnetic constant for air unity, le

finds that if the magnetic field is boutded by air the magnetic dif:
ference of pressure in the fluid and in the air may be expressed by a
- hydrostatie pressure, and thus its diamagnetic constant, less unity, can
ie oe as Using fields varying in strength from 300 ¢. g.s. to

2,000 c. g. s., the increase in height in some cases was more than 32™"
a ant fluids and —0.7™ for diamagnetic ones. (Ber. Ak. Berl.,
January, 1884; Phil. Mag., June, 1884, V, xvii, 447; Am. J. Sci., Sep-
tember, 1884, Il, XXVIII, 223.)

Von ‘Eells has applied the ordinary chemical balance to the
determination of magnetic moments. Even when the balance is itself

not absolutely free from iron, values can be obtained which are con-
. Stant and accurate to within a quarter of 1 per cent.; moreover, the
most essential advantage of the method is that it is quite free from
disturbances due to the incessant changes in the terrestrial magnetism.
(Ber. Ak. Bert., April, 1883; Phil. Mag., January, 1884, V, xvit, 75.)

Wleiigel and Henrichsen have examined the magnetism of some com-
pounds of the alcohol radicals C,H»,,,, by placing them in long glass
vessels suspended bifilarly between the pointed half armatures of a pow-
erful electro-nagnet, charged by the current from 16 to 18 Bunsen cells.
The magnetism developed was measured by a torsion method by means
of a mirror and scale. The conclusions are: (1) The introduction of CH,
into the molecule produces an increase in the molecular magnetism which
is nearly constant and has —1,640 for its mean value; (2) the molecular
magnetism of a chemical body is equal to the sum of the partial mag-
netisms of the alcohol radical and of the other parts of the compound ;
(3) HO, I, S, ana Br have the same specific magnetism, the mean value
of which is —44.3; (4) Cl, on the other hand, has a different specific
magnetism, about —61, a value nearly the same as that found for the
radical of acetic acid, —63; (5) the alcohol radicals possess the same
specific magnetism as their isomers; and (6) the magnetism of the alco-
hol radicals is made up of the atomic magnetisms of the carbon aad
hydrogen. (Phil. Mag., July, 1884, V, xvii, 78.)

Leduc has shown (J. Phys., II, 111, 133) that when a plate of bismuth
is placed in a magnetie field at ment angles to the lines of force, the
equipotential surfaces of a current traversing the plate are deflected
from their proper direction. Hence the physical condition of the metal
must have experienced some alteration. Hurion has taken advantage
of Kerr’s observation that a mirror placed between the poles of an elec-
tro-magnet rotates the plane of polarization of an incident perpendicular
~ay when the magnet is excited, to test this change in the physical
properties of bismuth. By pouring the melted metal on a hot plate of
glass he prepared a mirror, which was placed between the poles of a
Faraday’s electro-magnet. It was found that the bismuth rotated the
plane of polarization through 18/ in the opposite direction to the eur-
rent which excites the magnet, and that its electric resistance is in-

‘crease(l when it is placed in a magnetic field. (Phil. Mag., October,
1884, V, XVIII, 389.)

. Bosanquet has tested experimentally the idea of a repulsion between

magnetic lines of force, by the use of rings magnetized by means of a
continuous wire uniformly wound around them, and has shown that they
“present no external magnetic action even though they may be the seat
of closed circuits of magnetic lines of force of very great intensity.
Since we may suppose the ring divided into a number of separate rings,
each containing lines of force, and since such rings will be wholly with-
out action on one another, it follows that if such similar rings be placed
parallel and close to each other they do not repel each other, as they
should do if there existed a repulsion between parallel lines of force.
(Phil. Mag., December, 1884, V, Xv1i1, 494.)

McGee has described a novel magnetic engine, based on the diminu-
tion in the magnetism of iron by heat. It consists of a ring 13 in
diameter, made up of one or more turns of iron wire and supported on
radial arms so as to revolve about a vertical axis. Near it, and with
its axis in a radial direction, is a permanent bar-magnet. If now the
ring of wire be heated to bright redness on one side or the other of the
magnet, this magnet exerts a stronger attraction upon the wire on the
opposite or cooler side than upon the heated side, and the ring revolves.
By means of a pulley and string on the axis, using a powerful electro-
magnet, a weight of six grams was raised 50™ in six minutes. The

source of energy is of course the gas-burner employed. (Science, U1,
274, March, 1884.)

Stracciati has studied the currents produced in iron by its demag-

netization, and their influence upon the rapidity of this demagnetization,

_using for these experiments the method of Felici. He concludes that
the rapidity with which the magnetism of a mass of iron disappears
when the magnetizing force ceases, diminishes at first rapidly, when
this force increases, but appears finally to tend toward a constant value;
and that this velocity in the case of a bundle of iron wires separated by
silk from each other diminishes notably when the mass is rendered a
continuous conductor, as by plunging itina bath of mercury. (J. Phys.,
December, 1884, II, m1, 552.)

Trowbridge and Hill have made an elaborate investigation of the heat
produced in iron and steel by reversals of magnetization. Their con-
clusions are as follows: (1) The heat developed is probably due to in-

- duction currents and not to molecular vibrations; (2) the heating is
confined to the surface until equalized by conduction; (3) the musical
note emitted is the note of the coil, due to the number of reversals of
the machine, and is merely strengthened by the metallic core; and (4)
these experiments confirm what has long been known on the effect of
vibrations and shocks on the magnetic condition of iron and steel.
(Am. J. Sci., January, 1884, II, xxvii, 58.)

Bakmetieff, who has also investigated these phenomena, arrives at
the conclusion that magnetism by itself produces variations of tempera-
ture in magnetized bodies, and that this magnetic heat is equal to the
476 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

product of the magnetic moment by the magnetizing force multiplied
by a constant, increasing with the frequency of interruption of the cur-
rent, and still more when the current is alternated. (Nature, July, 1884,
XxX, 223.) ‘

Warburg and Hoénig have also experimented in the same direction,
and have come to the conclusion that a large proportion of the heat
observed, nearly 75 per cent., is due to magnetic friction. (Am. J. Sei.,
March, 1884, III, xx1x, 238.)

2. Hlectrie Generators.

Kalischer has tested the hypothesis that the condensation of steam
may be a source of electrification, using twelve large glass vases covered
with tin foil and filled with ice, placed on a sheet of tinned iron, insu-
lated by a block of glass; the whole being placed within a large insu-
lated metallic box, the metallic cover of which was perforated to allow
the access of air. An insulated wire connected the sheet of iron on
which the vases rested with one of the pairs of quadrants of a Kirchhoff
electrometer, the other pair being put to earth. The atmospheric
moisture condensed on the outside of the vases. The observed devia-
tions of the electrometer were of the same order of magnitude whether
the vases were empty or full of ice, being sometimes in one direction,
sometimes in the other. The best results were obtained, however, by
compressing air into a glass reservoir, connecting the metallic rod pass-
ing into its interior with the electrometer. During the expansion the
moisture condensed on the rod, but the needle showed no -deviation.
It cannot, consequently, be affirmed that condensation of aqueous vapor
is a source of atmospheric electricity. (Wied. Ann., xx, 614; J. Phys.,
May, 1884, II, 111, 219.)

It is generally assumed that ordinary zinc is positive to amalgamated
zine in a solution of zine sulphate. But Robb has shown that if care
be taken to employ pure zine, and solutions of sulphate free from acid,
the couple shows no sensible electro-motive force. Lippmann has
diseussed this result,and shows that the contrary result is in direct
contradiction to the second law of thermo-dynamies, since the action of
the current developed would cause the deposition of zine on the pure
zine, Which could then be amalgamated again, and so on; a finite quan-
tity of work being done at the expense of the amalgamation only. With
cadmium in cadmium sulphate, however, the polarity is reversed, and
hence there is no conflict with the above law. (J. Phys., September,
1884, II, 111, 388.)

Carhart has determined the relation between the electro-motive force
of a Daniell cell and the strength of the zine sulphate solution, employ-
ing for the purpose the compensation method of Poggendorff. With
a 1 per cent. solution the electro-motive force was 1.125 volts; 3 per cent.,
1.133; 5 per cent., 1.142; 74 per cent., 1.120; 10 per cent., 1.118; 15 per
cent., 1.115; 20 per cent., 1.111; and 25 per cent., 1.111; the mean of

fe

the whole being 1.122: Testing a Latimer Clark standard cell by this
method, the author obtained for its value 1.434 volts. Hence the van-
ation in the strength of the zine sulphate solution affects the electro-
motive force. (Am. J. Sci., November, 1884, Il], xxviut, 374.)

Beetz has proposed a simplified form of Daniell cell for use as a nor-
mal element, which is of remarkable constancy at different temperatures,
and which, owing to its high resistance, falls off only slightly on closed
circuit. The battery for charging the quadrants of an electrometer is
made by filling glass tubes, 8° long and 5™ in diameter, one-half full
of plaster of Paris mixed with solution of copper sulphate, and the other
half with plaster mixed with zine sulphate solution, wires of copper
and of zine being placed in the corresponding mixture, the external
ends being soldered together alternately. Twelve of these form a row,
and twelve of these rows form the battery, the difference of potential
of the 144 vells being 152 volts. The entire battery occupies a space
of only 16° square. (Wied. Ann., xxiI, 402; Phil. Mag., September,
1884, V, xvi, 173; Am. J. Sci., November, 1884, II1, xx v111, 390.)

Another standard’cell devised by Beetz is a modified Latimer Clark
cell. It consists of a tube in which a compressed cake of mercurous
and zine sulphates is placed, the zinc being on one side of this cake
and the mereury on the other. The electro-motive force was 1.44 volts,
which on short circuiting for 48 hours fell only to 1.408. Its resistance
is 15.7 ohms. (Nature, October, 1884, xxx, 568.)

At the Montreal meeting of the British Association one of the sub-
jects for general discussion was the seat of the electro-motive forces of
the voltaic cell. It was opened by O. J. Lodge, who inclined to the
chemical theory, in opposition to Sir William Thomson and others, who
favored the contact theory. Printed copies of notes prepared by Dr.
Lodge, containing the points involved in the question at issue, were
distributed before the meeting. (Nature, October, 1884, xxx, 594.)

Quite a number of new forms of voltaic cell have been proposed.
Reynier has studied the effect of varying the size of the elecirodes in a
battery upon its electro-motive force, and has constructed two cells
which he calls maximum and minimum cells. The former has a copper
plate plicated so as to have a surface of 30 square decimeters, or 300
times as large as that of the zinc plate, which is simply a wire 5™° in
diameter. The containing vessel has a capacity of 800 c¢. ¢. and the
cell has a resistance of 0.2 to 4 ohms, according to the liquid used.
The latter, while exteriorly of the same size, contains a negative elec-
trode 5 sq. dm. in size, the positive being a copper wire 0.5°" in diam-
eter, the surface immersed being 1 sq. em. With these batteries he has
measured the maximum and minimum electro-motive force ofthe or-
dinary electrolytes. In dilute sulphuric acid, the zine being amal-
gamated, the maximum electro-motive force observed was 1.072 volts
and the minimum 0.272. The maximum cell, charged with a liquid
composed of 20 parts salt in 100 of water, he proposes as a standard
478 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884. .

cell, its electro-motive force being 0.82 volt between’ 5° and 40°. (J.
Phys., October, 1884, II, 111, 444, 448.)

Lalande and Chaperon suggest cupric oxide as the depolarizing agent
in the battery. The oxide is placed on the copper plate, which is
covered with a solution of caustic potash, and a plate of zinc is suspended
init. The electro-motive force is 0.98 volt and the cell is remarkably
constant. (Nature, January, 1884, XxIx, 227.)

Tommasi and Radiquet have constructed a battery with two carbon
electrodes. The pesitive plate is placed at the bottom of a porcelain
jar and covered with lead peroxide, the negative plate is covered on
its surface with platinized coke, the two being separated by a sheet of
parchment paper. A solution of common salt is used as the electro-
lyte, which must not completely cover the upper plate. The electro-
motive force on closed circuit is 0.6 volt. (OC. R., July, 1884, xcrx, 129.)

Pabst has invented an iron cell, the electrodes of which are carbon
and wrought-iron in a solution of ferric chloride, and which is claimed
to be non-polarizable and self-regenerating. The oxygen of the air is
absorbed in the working of the battery, and ferric oxide is deposited at
the bottom of the cell. Its electro-motive force is about 0.78 volt. (Na-
ture, January, 1885, Xxx, 203.)

Bartoli has designed a battery in which the material consumed is
carbon, which is in the form of a compacted mixture of Ceylon graphite
and retort coke. This constitutes one of the electrodes, while the other
one is platinum. The exciting liquid is sodium hypochlorite, and the
electro-motive force is only about 0.2 volt. (Nature, January, 1885,
XxXxI, 203.)

Jablochkoff has produced a battery of considerable scientific interest.
A small rod of sodium, weighing about 8 grams, is squeezed into con-
tact with an amalgamated copper wire and flattened. Itis then wrapped
in tissue paper and fastened by wooden pegs to a plate of very porous
carbon. The sodium absorbs the moisture of the air and no solution is
required. Its electro-motive force is 2.5 volts, but its resistance is 25
ohms. (Nature, January, 1885, xxxI, 203.)

Skrivanow’s battery consists of zine and of silver chloride enclosed
in parchment paper and immersed in a solution composed of 75 parts
caustic potash in 100 of water. The enclosing vessel is a hard rub-
ber cup which is hermetically sealed, and the whole weighs 100 grams.
The electro-motive force is from 1.45 to 1.50, and the cell will give a
current of 1 ampere for about an hour. Then the solution must be re-
newed, and after two or three renewals of this the silver chloride must
be replaced. (C. &., January, 1884, XcvIII, 224.)

Gore has constructed a new and convenient form of thermo-electric
apparatus for measuring small electro-motive forces by the method of
opposition. It consists of about 300 horizontal, slender, parallel wires
of iron and German silver, the former covered with cotton. These
wires are about 8 inches long, fixed side by side in close mutual con-

tact, though insulated from each other, as a continuous flat layer about
16 inches long, soldered end to end in an alternating series. About 14
inch in length at each end is bent downward so as to dip into two
liquids of different temperatures contained in two long, narrow troughs.
The hot one is melted paraffin, kept at 120°; the cold one is a non-vola-
tile petroleum. The resistance of 295 pairs of such wires was 95.6 ohms
at 16° C.; and when the difference of temperature in the two baths was
100° the electro-motive force was 0.7729 volt, and when it was 130°,
1.005 volts. Each element gave, therefore, 0.0000262 volt top 1 WV ath
this apparatus measurements have been made to the 35355 part of a
volt. The author finds it very useful in practice. (Nature, March.
1884, XxIx, 513.)

Von Waltenhofen has observed that the Mee thermo-battery is capa-
ble of taking a charge like an accumulator. When the current of a
battery is sent for a few moments through one of these generators, it is
capable of yielding a counter-current, due, of course, to the well-known
Peltier effect. A different effect, however, was observed according to
the direction of the charging current. When this current was in one
direction, the discharge currents were proportional to these and were
always in the opposite direction. But when the charging current was
reversed, the discharge current at first increased to a maximum, then
decreased to zero, then began in the reverse direction, or that of the
charging current. The author ascribes this anomalous result to the
unequal heating of the junctions. (Nature, January, 1884, xx1x, 227.)

Two important papers have appeared having for their object the dis-
cussion of the theory of the dynamo-electric machine. The first of these
is by Clausius (Wied. Ann., XX, 353; Phil. Mag., January, February,
1884, V, xvut, 46, 119; J. Phys., July, 1884, IT, 11, 313), and the other,
on machines with alternating currents, by Lucas (0. R., March, 1884,
Xcvi1, 670), who used the Meritens machine in his experiments.

Fitzgerald has sought to produce a non-sparking dynamo by apply-
ing the principles of Maxwell’s modification of Thomson’s electric doub-
ler to a dynamo, in which the current passes through two or more coils
in parallel circuit. Under these circumstances it is possible to arrange
the magnetic field and the brushes so that when the terminals of any coil
come into contact with their brushes the terminals shall be at the same
difference of potential as the brushes, so that when they break contact
there shall be no current circulating in the coil, and therefore no sparks
produced. The energy of self-induction, usually wasted on local cur-
rents and sparks will now be spent in the production of useful current

(Nature, July, 1884, xxx, 331.)

3. Electrical Units and Measurements.

The International Electrical Conference held in Paris in April con-
cluded the business before it and adjourned finally. Each section
adopted resolutions as follows: First section, electric units: (1) The

legal ohm is the resistance of a column of mercury of a square millime
ter in cross-section and 106° in length, at the temperature of melt-
ingice. (2) The conference expresses the wish that the French Govern-
ment should transmit this resolution to the different states, and recom-
mend an international adoption of it. (3) The conference recommends
the construction of primary standards in mercury conformable to the
resolution previously adopted, and the concurrent employment of scales
of secondary resistances in solid alloys, which shall be frequently com
pared amongst one another and with the primary standard. (4) The
ampere is the current the absolute value of which is 10 to the power
minus | in electro-magnetic units. (5) The volt is the electro-motive
force which maintains a current of 1 ampere in a conductor the resist-
ance of which is 1 Jegal ohm. Second section, earth currents and
atmospheric electricity: (1) It is to be desired that the results of ob-
servations collected by the various administrations be sent each year
to the International Bureau of Telegraph Administration, at Berne,
which wil! make a digest of them and communicate it to the various
Governments. (2) The conference expresses the wish that observations
of earth currents be pursued in all countries. Third section, standard of
light: (1) The unit of each kind of simple light is the quantity of
light of the same kind emitted in a normal direction by a square centi-
meter of surface of molten platinum at the temperature of solidification.
The practical unit of white light is the quantity of white light emitted
normally by the same source. (Nature, May, 1884, xxx, 26; J. Phys.,
June, 1884, II, 111, 229.)

Rowland has completed his determination of the length of the mer-
cury column 1 sq. mm. in cross-section which has a resistance of 1
ohm. The experiments were made at Clifton, 2 miles from Balti-
more, the expense being defrayed by the Government. The resist-
ance of columns of pure mercury, contained in glass tubes of various
calibers and lengths, was first determined in B. A. units, and then the
determination in ohms of the B. A. standard completed the measure-
ment. ‘Three methods were used in the latter comparison. The first
consisted in heating some non-conducting liquid, such as aleohol or tur-
pentine, by the current, in a conductor whose ends were kept at a known
difference of potential, the same heating being then produced mechan-
ically, thus determining the resistance of the conductor in terms of the
work-equivalent of the heat. The second method used was that of
Kirchhoff, as modified by Rowland in his 1876 determination of the ohm.
The third method was the earth-inductor method of Weber. Unfortu-
nately the experiments were not completed in season to have the results:
communicated to the Paris conference in April, but they were commu-
nicated to the American Electrical Conference held in September in
Philadelphia. Rowland gives as the length of the mereury column, as
the mean of his experiments, 106.27. (Science, January, 1884, 11, 10;
Lilec, Worla, September, 1884, tv, 101.)

PHYSICS. 481

Mascart, De Nerville, and Benoit have made a determination of the
length of the mercury column required by the legal ohm, using for this
purpose the methods of Kirchhoff and Weber. ‘They conclude as fol-
lows: “ The experiment appears to us to show that the value of the
ohm is surely comprised between 106.2 and 106.4; we may consider
the value 106.3 as exact, at least to ;j55 part.” (C. R., April, 1884,
xovill, 10384; J. Phys., June, 1884, I, 111, 230.)

Benoit has constructed for the French Government four mercury
standards corresponding to the ohm of the conference. These are
straight glass tubes whose caliber is nearly 1™™, The resistances as
measured were 1.000017, 0.999996, 0.999960, and 1.000003 ohms, or
0.999994 asa mean. (C. R., xc1x, 864, November, 1884.)

The committee of the British esooiunon has announced that arrange-
ments have been completed for testing resistance coils at the Cavendish
Laboratory, and issuing certificates of their value. They assume the
B. A. unit to be 0.9867 of astandard ohm. (Natwre, xx1x, 465, March,
1884.)

Edelmann has modified the quadrant electrometer of Thomson by
making the quadrants cylindrical, formed by slitting a metal tube into
four parts by four equidistant cuts parallel to the axis. The needle
consists of two portions of metal cut from a cylinder, united above and
below and hung by a single fiber, directive force being given by a small
attached magnetic needle. (Nature, January, 1884, Xx1x, 259.)

Chervet has described a new form of capillary, electrometer with hor-
izontal tube, in which this tube is slightly conical, and which is empir-
ically graduated. Witha lens magnifying six times, a difference of po-
tential of 0.00001 Daniell cell may be obsenyed: (J. Phys., June, 1884, IL,
Il, 258.)

Garbe has laid down the two following laws in relation to the cap-
illary electrometer of Lippmann: (1) The capillary constant of mer-
cury is greatest when the electrical difference at the meniscus is nil,
and as a rule its value is independent of the sign of this difference.
(2) The electrical capacity at a constant surface of an electrode plunged
in a liquid is purely a function of the electrical difference, independent of
the sign of that difference, and is least when that difference is nil. (Na-
ture, October, 1884, xxx, 568.)

Lippmann has contrived a mereury galv anometer based on the ae-
tion of magnets on currents. A mercury manometer in the form of a
U-tube is placed between the poles of a permanent magnet, so that
these poles are on the right and left side of the horizontal portion.
The current to be measured is made to traverse this horizontal portion
in a vertical direction; «4 ¢., perpendicular to the axis of the tube. A
difference of level is thereby produced in the manometer columns pro-
portional to the strength of the current. In one of the author’s instru-
ments this difference is equal to 25°" for 1 ampere ; in another to 55°" for
l ampere. The apparatus is reversible; by moving the mercury me-

chanically a current is developed. (C. R., May, 1884, xcvm1, 1256; J.
Phys., September, 1884, II, 11, 384.) __

An obvious modification permits this instrument to be converted
into an electro-dynamometer. A small retangular chamber filled with
mercury is placed at the center of a coil of copper wire. The current
to be measured passes successively through the coil of wire and the
layer of mercury. which communicates laterally with the two branches
of a manometer, and causes a difference of level in the mercury columns
which is rigorously proportional to the square of the current strength.
It may be graduated in absolute measure; in one of the author’s instru-
ments a current of 10. G.S. unit, or 10 amperes, produces a pressure
of 650 dynes, or about 650 ne eaae per square centimeter. It may be
used for direct or alternating currents, and when once graduated may
serve as astandard. (C. &., June, 1884, xovit, 1534; J. Phys., Septem-
ber Sed. Eni, o3s.)) =

Several new forms of galvanometer have been described. T.and A. Gray
have constructed a very sensitive instrument, consisting of two pairs of
couls with hollow cores, arranged so that the axes of each pair are parallel
and in a vertical plane, and act on a needle system consisting of two
horseshoe magnets of thin steel wire, connected by a very light frame
of aluminum, and hung with their nine vertical, so that a horseshoe
corresponding to each pair of coils has its poles within the hollow cores.
Each pair of coils is carried by a-vertical brass plate, the two plates
being placed so as to make an angle with one another gf about 100°.
Certain other instruments are described, in which two perfectly ver-
tical and straight needles are used to give an astatic system. (Nature,
March, 1884, xx1x, 444.)

In D’Arsonval and Deprez’s galvanometer the coil is movable and
the maguet fixed. A powerful horseshoe magnet placed vertical, with
its poles upward, has a rectangular coil suspended between these poles
by fine silver wire. A small cylinder of soft iron is supported within
the rectangle for the purpose of re-enforcing the magnetic field. A mir-
ror above the rectangle enables the defleciions to be read. The instru-
ment is very dead-beat and will indicate a millionth of an ampere.
(Nature, November, 1834, XXxtI, 86.)

Bosanquet has devised what he calls a standard tension galvanometer,
which is a form of tangent galvanometer independent of any process
of calibration, and whose accuracy depends only on the usual measures
of dimensions and the knowledge of the horizontal component of the
earth’s magnetism, together with its resistance. (Phil. Mag., January,
1884, V, XVII,.27.)

Botteher’s solenoidal galvanometer consists of a soft iron cylinder 1 to
ise in diameter and 20° long, suspended by a thread to a spring-
balance, so that one half projects from a firmly fixed coil of wire. (Phil.
Mag., March, 1884, V, xvut, 248.)
PHYSICS. — 483

Ducretet’s instrument has the two astatic needles in the same hor-
izontal plane. (C. #., October, 1884, xo1x, 605.)

Stone has described an electro-dynamometer with an extremely light
suspended coil made of aluminum wire. (Nature, xxx, 635, October,
1884.)

Beillati has substituted for the needle of a reflection galvanometer a
small cylinder of soft iron suspended bifilarly in a direction perpendicu-
lar to the magnetic meridian, the vertical coil through which the current
passes being inclined 45° to this meridian. Since the electro-magnetic
action preserves always the same sign, the instrument acts as an elec-
tro-dynamometer. Ifa bundle of soft iron wires be used, 0.15"" in diam-
eter and 17°" long, the instrument readily indicates telephone cur-
rents. (J. Phys., May, 1884, II, 111, 220.)

4, Klectrie Spark and Electric Light.

Foster and Pryson have given a simple formula to represent the dif-
ference of potential required to give sparks in air. If this difference of
potential be represented by V, and the length of the spark in centimeters
bel, theirexperiments give approximately V =102/+ 7.07. The results
were obtained with brass balls 1.35" in diameter, a frictional machine,
and a Foster absolute electrometer. When /=0.142, the difference of
potential was 154.76; with 1=0.284, V—133.35; for /= 0.497, V = 131.66;
and for / = 0.9, V = 188.57; the value of V diminishing then and increas-
ing again. (Nature, March, 1884, xxrx, 446.)

In his Bakerian lecture, Schuster has ably discussed the experiments
which have made on the electric discharge through gases, and has given
a sketch of a theory of this action. He shows that the negative glow
is divisible into three layers, increasing in thickness with decreasing
density. In the first place, a luminous layer closely surrounds the elec-
trode, which, when this is new, is of a golden color. The spectroscope
shows in this the presence of sodium and hydrogen. The second layer is
known by the name of the dark space. The third layer is the glow
proper. The theory proposed is this: that within the first layer the
gaseous molecules are decomposed, that their respective parts are pro-
jected with great velocity through the dark space, that this velocity is
gradually reduced by impacts within the glow, and that-in the positive
part of the discharge the discharge takes place by diffusion, except when
stratifications appear. (Nature, July, 1884, xxx, 230.)

E. Wiedemann has also investigated the phenomena of the electric
discharge in gases. He supposes that the positive discharge consisting
in a current preceded by a polarization of the gas is an electrical phe-
nomenon proper, and he attributes it to a longitudinal motion. The
negative rays are the true luminous rays, of very short wave-length,
energetically absorbed by the ponderable medium, in which they excite
phosphorescence. The negative electrode is a source of transversal.
waves, exerting on their front, according to Maxwell, a pressure which
184 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

the Crookes phenomena prove. (Wied. Ann., xx, 756; J. Phys., II, 11,
210; Phil. Mag., July, August, 1884, V, xv111, 35, 85.)

De la Rue and Miller have studied the discharge of 15,000 cells of
the silver chloride battery, using two very slightly convex disks, a point
and disk, and two paraboloidal points, the potential being increased a
thousand cells at a time. Inspection of the curve.shows that it is con-
tinuously concave for the disks, while for the disk and point and two
points it is concave only for a certain distance and then turns off and
becomes convex. The intensity of force per centimeter decreases con-
tinuously up to 15,450 volts in the case of planes; but in the other cases
the decrease ceases after a certain potential has been reached, and then
increases so as to be nearly a constant quantity. At 9,000 volts, and
beyond, the potential between a point and a disk is very nearly 9,200
volts; hence, if the law holds good, to produce a spark 1 long,
92,000 volts ; 1™ long, 920,000 volts: and a flash of lightning a kilo-
meter in length, 920,000,000 volts, would be required. This would, of
course, be lessened by the diminished atmospheric pressure at that
height. Under a mean pressure of 939,211 M it would require 864,-
000,000 to produce a discharge between a cloud a kilometer high and
the earth. In an induction coil a spark of 1 inch requires 23,367 volts,
1 foot 280,400 volts, and 1 yard 841,230 volts. (Nature, January, 1884,
XXIX, 327:)

Lucas has determined the resistance of the are produced in the Ser-
rin lamp, between two Carre carbons 16™" in diameter. With a 50-
ampere current, the carbons being separated 4™, he finds the resistance
to be 0.58 ohm. (C. &., April, 1884, xcvi1, 1040.)

Schneebeli has examined the radiation from the Swan incandescent
lamp at various temperatures, employing the method of Svanberg and
Langley. The resistance of the lamp, cold, was 80 ohms. The current
strength, the total radiation of the lamp, and the luminous radiation were
measured, and it appeared that for each current strength C there exists
the following relation: C?-R = KW, in which R is the resistance of the
carbon at the designated temperature, W the energy emitted by the
lamp, and Kaconstant. If Ris constant between 900° and 1,500°, then

N2

s is constant. The results show that the resistance of carbon between

a red and a white heat is apparently independent of temperature. The
abserption coefficient of the glass globes of the lamp is also apparently
independent of temperature. (Wied. Ann., xx1, 430; Am. J. Sct., Sep-
tember, 1884, ILI, xxvii, 225.)

The electric light systeins exhibited at the Cincinnati Exposition were
tested by a jury consisting of Mendenhall, Eddy, French, and Laidlaw,
and their report has been published. The dynamometric measurements
were made by means of the Brackett dynamometer, specially constructed.
The current strength was measured by one of Thomson’s current gal-
yanometers and a Brackett differential galvanometer. The electro-me-
PHYSICS. 485

tive force was measured on Thomson’s potential galvanometer, a high-
resistance Thomson galvanometer and a condenser being used to check
the indications. The photometric power of the lamps, both are and in-
candescent, was determined in terms of an Edison 16-candle lamp taken
as a Standard. The efficiency found for the Thomson-Houston are dy-
namo was 81.5; of the Weston are dynamo, 86.5; of the Weston in-
candescent dynamo, 87.9; and of the Edison incandescent dynamo, 95.1.
In the case of the are lamps the jury found a difference of more than 40
per cent. in favor of the Thomson-Houston, and in that of incandescent
lamps they found a difference of 25 per cent. of light per electrical
horse-power in favor of the Edison. (Science, February, 1884, 11, 174.)

5. Hlectro-chemical Decomposition.

Jahn, ina paper communicated to the Vienna Academy, has shown
that in the electrolysis of solutions of copper sulphate and of zine sul-
phate between two electrodes of platinum, the quantities of heat which
become free during the decomposition of equivalent weights of the two
salts are inversely as the quantities of heat evolved during the formation
of these salts by means of the two metals, of oxygen and of sulphuric
acid. (J. Phys., June, 1884, IT, 11, 274.)

Warburg has succeeded in electrolyzing glass by heating it to 300°
between mercury electrodes. The glass used was a soda-lime glass,
which is a conductor at this temperature. The current of 15 to 30 Bun-
sen cells was used, and at first passed freely ; but in a few moments the
current diminished, and in the course of an hour fell to =;;,, from the for-
mation at the anode of a layer of insulating silica. This siliceous layer
acted as the dielectric of a condenser between two conductors; and by
charging it with from 5 to 20 Bunsen cells, the condenser was found to
have a capacity of from 0.021 to 0.041 microfarad, according to the
thickness of the layer. If sodium amalgam be used as the anode, no
layer of silica results, but sodium is found in the mercury on the cath-
ode side, the amount of which was found to agree with the weight of
silver deposited in a voltameter in the same circuit. Potassium amal-
gam is without action. (J. Phys., October, 1884, II, 111, 452; Phil. Mag.,
August, 1884, V, xv111, 159.)

Gore has propounded a theory of the relation of heat to electrolysis
which assumes that metals and electrolytes are throughout their masses
in a state of molecular vibration; that the molecules of these sub-
stances, being frictionless bodies in a frictionless medium, and their
motion not being dissipated by conduction or radiation, continue inces-
santly in motion until some cause arises to prevent them; that each
metal or electrolyte when unequally heated has to a certain extent an
unlike class of motions in its differently heated parts, and behaves in
those parts somewhat like two metals or electrolytes, and those unlike
motions are enabled, through the intermediate conducting portion of
the substance, to render those parts electro-polar; that every different
A86 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR ias4

metal and electrolyte has a different class of motions, and in conse.
quence of this they also, by contact alone with each other at the same
temperature, become electro-polar. The molecular motion of each dif-
ferent substance also increases at a different rate by rise of temperature.
(Nature, January, 1884, xx1x, 300.)

Hammer! has studied the conditions of accuracy in the copper vol-
tameter, and finds them to be as follows: (1) The liquid should not be
heated above 40°, for fear of oxidizing the deposit; (2) the plates should
be nearly rectangular, preferably circular, parallel, and varnished on
the back; (3) if they are not less than 1.5™ apart, the density of the

current for exact measurement should not exceed 7 amperes per square

decimeter. (J. Phys., April, 1884, II, 111, 178.)

Maseart has repeated his determination of the electro-chemical equiv-
alent of silver, and now finds that a coulomb will deposit 1.1156 milli-
grams of silver and will decompose 0.09303 milligram of water. The
values found by Kohlrausch were 1.1183 and 0.09325, respectively. (J.
Phys., July, 1884, I, 11, 283.)

Rayleigh has also determined the electro-chemical equivalent of sil-
ver and finds 1,118x10~ for its value in C. G. S. units. One ampere-
hour deposits 4.025 grams silver. (Proce. Roy. Soc., March, 1884; J.
Phys., July, 1884, I, 111, 307.)

Lodge, in a paper on storage batteries, concedes that at the present
time it is pretty generally felt that no existing form of storage battery
is perfect, and that on the whole such batteries are extravagant and
wasteful to an extent sufficient to more than compensate for their un-
deniable convenience. ‘‘Itis perfectly certain,” he says, ‘“ that their em-
ployment has not become at all general, and that they have failed to
realize the somewhat sanguine hope of their early promoters.” Storage
batteries would be useful, he thinks, (1) to economize now wasted power,
like water-power ; (2) to obtain regular from irregular action, as wind
and tides; and (3) to obtain strong but short—from long-continued
though weak action. (Nature, October, 1884, xxx, 585.)

CHEMISTRY

By H. CARRINGTON BOLTON,
Professor of Chemistry, Trinity College, Hartford.

GENERAL AND PHYSICAL.

The Color of Chemical Compounds as a Function of the Atomic Weights
of their Constituent Elements.—Thomas Carnelly finds that the color of
chemical compounds depends on at least three conditions—(1) the tem-
perature, (2) the quantity of the electro-negative element, and (5) the
atomic weights of the constituent elements. Of these three conditions |
the two former have been especially studied by Mr. Ackroyd, whose re-
sults are thus summarized:

(1) All the chromium compounds change their color in a definite serial
order, that of the spectral colors, in such a manner that as the tempera-
ture rises the color approximates more and more to-the red end of the
spectrum, and ultimately, at a sufficiently high temperature, passes into
brown and black. Most frequently the transition of color is direct from
white to a pale yellow, while violet, indigo, blue, and green are passed
over as transition stages.

(2) In binary compounds an increase of the quantity of the electro-
negative element involves a change of color to the red end of the spec-
trum, and ultimately into brown and black.

(3) Dr. Carnelly expresses his law as follows. Influence of the atomic
weight: in some series of compounds, Aw Ry; Br Ry; Cx Ry; &e.,
in which R is an element or a group of elements, while A, B, C, &c.,
signify elements belonging to the same subordinate group in Men-
delejeff’s table of the natural classification of the elements, the color
passes entirely er partially through the following scale: White or
colorless, violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red, brown, black,
with the increasing atomic weight of the elements A, B, C, &e. In
other words, the higher the atomic weight of the elements A, B, C, rises,
the more the color of the compound approaches the red end of the
spectrum, and passes in certain cases into brown and black. This rule
applies only when the elements A, b, C, &e., belong to the same sub-
group. In 426 cases examined the author found only 14 exceptions, 4
four of which, DiCl;,V2,0;, CrO;, and CdO, do not admit of satisfactory

explanation. The author thinks that there are indications that the
color of compounds is a periodic function of their atomic weights.
This is best seen in the normal iodides. He proposes extending his re-
searches to the colors of organic bodies. (Berichte d. chem. Ges., XV,
2151.)

The Periodic Law and the Occurrence of the Elements in Nature, by Thomas
Carnelly.—The theory concerning the occurrence of the elements in
nature is based upon the periodic law, and comprises four points :

(1) Elements which belong to the odd series (of the periodic classi-
fication) are as a rule readily brought into the free condition. On the
other hand, those elements belonging to the even series are only set
free with difficulty. Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sodium, magnesium,
and silicon are the only exceptions to this rule, which is explained by
the inverted character of the “ curve of the elements.”

(2) Elements belonging to the even series, with the exception of
carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and the group VIII, never occur in nature
in a free state. The elements belonging to the odd series frequently
occur in this condition.

(3) The elements belonging to the odd series occur in nature ordinarily
as sulphides or double sulphides (selenides, arsenides, &c.), 7. ¢., in com-
bination with a negative element belonging to an odd series, rarely as
oxides. Elements belonging to the even series are commonly found as
oxides or double oxides (with formation of silicates, carbonates, sulphates,
aluminates, &c.), that is to say, in combination with a negative element
belonging to an even series, and never (with two exceptions) as sul-
phides.

(4) The halogens chlorine, bromine, iodine, fluorine, the most electro-
negative elements, occur in nature in combination with the most electro-
positive metals, as chlorides, bromides, iodides, and fluorides, and (omit-
ting certain metallic oxychlorides and sulphochlorides) in combination
with oxygen or sulphur.

The above-mentioned ‘facts may be thus expressed with reference to
Lothar Meyer’s curve of the elements: Elements whose place is on fall-
ing parts of the curve are difficult to reduce, and never occur in nature
in a free condition or in combination as sulphides, but always in com-
bination with oxygen as oxides or double oxides (silicates, sulphates,
carbonates, &c.) ; while the elements whose place is on ascending parts
of the curve are easily reduced, and occur almost always—more or
less—in a free condition, and also in combination with sulphur and very
-rarely with oxygen. (Berichte d. chem. Ges., XVII, 2287.)

Explanation of Gladstone and Tribe's 2-3 Law in Chemical Dynamics,
by John W. Langley.—Gladstone and Tribe showed. that if a plate of
metal is suspended in a solution of another metal which it can precipi-
tate, the rate of chemical action, as shown by the loss of weight in the
suspended plate (for a given period of immersion), will vary with the

.

CHEMISTRY. 493

percentage strength of the solution in a remarkable manner, which they
epitomize in the following statement: If the percentages of the salt be
expressed by a series of the powers of 2, the chemical action will be ex-
pressed by the corresponding powers of 3. In their experiments they
employed a plate of copper suspended in a solution of silver nitrate.
Since the authors offered no explanation of this law, Professor Langley
raised the following questions: Is the rate of metallic precipitation for
varying strengths of the solution due to the chemical action alone, or
is the operation of chemical affinity compounded with one or more purely
physical forces; and, ifso, what is the relative part contributed by each?

To solve the problem Professor Langley devised apparatus for bring-
ing the solution against the plate with uniform velocity ; this was sug-
gested by an observation of Gladstone and Tribe that two currents, one
ascending and one descending, formed during the precipitation. Pro-
fessor Langley arranged a plate of copper so that it revolved 54 times
per second, and asa result of many trials, made in divers ways, he arrived
at this law: In metallic precipitations of dilute solutions the chemical
action varies directly as the mass, 7. e., percentage of the dissolved
salt.

Gladstone and Tribe’s experimental work was confirmed, and Pro-
fessor Langley offers the following explanation of their law: When the
plate is suspended in the liquid a film of copper nitrate is at once formed
against it. Now, the access of fresh silver nitrate depends on the re-
moval of copper nitrate ; this film, being heavier than the main solution,
begins to fall (a part also rises), and thus drags in fresh liquid from
above to attack the copper. The rate at which it falls depends upon
its density, that is, on the quantity of copper dissolved, but it is resisted
by the inertia of the surrounding fluid which it must displace. Now,
as the percentage of silver nitrate in the solution is increased the den-
sity of the copper nitrate increases, and it will descend faster. The rate
of motion, however, is dependent on several considerations, which the
author discusses fully, and he concludes that the observed rate of
action will be made up of two factors: twice the chemical action
because of chemism, and 14 because of gravitative action; or, when the
percentage of silver salt is doubled, the quantity of copper dissolved
will be tripled. This is Gladstone and Tribe’s law.

The author thinks it probable that the true law of chemical action,
where one metal precipitates another, should be that the time during
which one atom replaces another in a compound molecule is’ constant,
and hence that the rate of total chemical action varies directly as the
mass of the reacting body in solution. (Jowrn. Chem. Soc., December,
1884.)

Certain Phenomena attending Mixture, by Prof. F. Guthrie.—Experi-
ments conducted with a number of different liquids show that mixtures
can be arranged in two distinct classes. Of the first a mixture of
water and ether is an example; when shaken up together they mix, heat
A94 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

is evolved, and a diminution of bulk takes place. If any excess of ether

present be poured off, and the lower clear liquid heated in a sealed tube,
it becomes turbid, owing to the separation of the ether. This is accom-
_ panied by an increase in bulk and absorption of heat.

Alcohol and carbon disulphide foim a typical case of the second class
of mixtures. These liquids mix with each other, in all proportions above
0° C., with increase of bulk and absorption of heat. Upon cooling the
mixture to about —17° C. the liquids separate. In these cases the
action is regarded as a chemical one. (Chem. News, L, 233.)

On a Relation between the Molecu‘ar Weights of Liquids and their Veloc-
ities of Evaporation, by C. Schall.—On disiilling successively in the same
apparatus given volumes of benzene and of water, the author found that,
even when the boiling was maintained as nearly uniform as possible,
very different weights of these two substances passed over in the same
time. Even in a rough experiment the quantity of benzene in the re-
ceiver was double that of the water. With a view to give the experi-
ment greater exactness, the time of evaporation of equal volames of these
liquids was carefully determined. Knowing, then, the density of the
liquids at the boiling point, their weights could be caleulated, and hence
the exact time of evaporation of equal weights.

On comparison the values thus obtained appeared to be very nearly in
the inverse ratio of the molecular weights of the liquids employed. Thus,
benzene, with a boiling point of 79.2° and a density of 0.8136, evaporated
in 12.7, 12.95, and 12.3 minutes; while the same volume of chloroform,
boiling point 61.5° and density 1.4048, evaporated in 14.3, 14.5, and 14.3
minutes; or, reduced to equal weights, in 8.25, 8.4, and 8.28 minutes.

Since m:m/=t': t, the first value gives for the molecular weight of
chloroform 119.64, the second 120.25, and the third 119.88, the true value
being 119.5. Benzene, when compared with carbon disulphide, boiling
point 45.3° and density 1.2212, evaporated in 12.3 minutes, while the
same volume of CS, required 19 minutes; or, reduced to equal weights,
12.66 minutes. This gives, by calculation, a molecular weight of 75.79
in place of 76. Water, boiling point 99° and density 0.9596, evaporated
in 64 minutes; or, reduced to equal weights, in 54.26 minutes. This gives
a molecular weight of 17.68 instead of 18. Moreover, the ratio of the
volumes of two liquids evaporated in equal times is the ratio of their
molecular volames. Thus, the ratio for benzene and chloroform above
given is 1.126:1; whence 1.126: 1=95.94 (the molecular volume of
benzene): 85.2 (the molecular volume of chloroform). Svhiff obtained
84.65. The author has further observed that on comparing Regnault’s
values of the heat of vaporization of several liquids, these numbers de-
crease as the molecular weight increases. From which, of fifteen liquids

whose heat-data are known, thirteen fall readily into five groups, in each
of which the product of the heat of vaporization by the molecular weight
is approximately constant. Thus, water gives 536.67 x 18=9660.06,

CHEMISTRY. 495

while alcohol gives 214.3 x46=9857.8; acetone gives 7523.76, chloro-
form 7289.5, and carbon tetrachloride 7161; ethyl oxide 6711.8, carbon
disulphide 6361.2, and ethyl chloride 6128.7; stannic chloride 11736.4,
arsenious chloride 12292.99, and ethyl acetate 12820.72; phosphorous
chloride 8970.5 and ethyl iodide 8938.8. The remaining two are amyl
alcohol, which gives 17954.64, and bromine, 7963.2. These do not seem
to belong to any of the*above groups, unless the latter be placed in
that containing acetone. (Am. Journ. Sci., CXXVII, 233, in abstract by
G. I. B. from Berichte d. chem. Ges.)

On the Connection between Pseudo Solution und True Solution, by W.
W. J. Nichol.—The well-known Brownian motion of small particles
suspended in a liquid being regarded as a consequence of molecular im-
pacts is applied by the author to support the molecular as distinguished
from the hydrate theory of solution. According to the former theory, the
solution ofa salt in water is a consequence of the superior attraction of the
molecules of water for those of the salt as compared with the cohesion
of the salt itself. Substances are soluble in inverse proportion to their
cohesion. Cohesion being destroyed by subdivision, a finely divided
substance remains suspended for along time in water. Such suspen-
sion or pseudo solution difters only from true solution in respect to fine-
ness of division of the solid. If subdivision could be carried to the iso-
lation of the molecules, true solution would result, and substances thus
dissolved could separate from solution only slowly, in spite of the supe-
rior cohesion of their molecules, because aggregations of these mole-
cules sufficiently large to separate themselves from solution could only
occasionally be found. As an instance of this we have slow precipita-
tion of many insoluble substances from solution when cold and dilute.

INORGANIC.

Liquefaction of Hydrogen.—S. Wroblewski has subjected hydrogen to a
pressure of 100 atmospheres in a glass tube of 2™" external diameter and
of 0.2-0.4™ internal diameter. The tube was placed vertically, and by
means of a screw the compressed gas could be released instantaneously.
The tube and contents were cooled by boiling oxygen. At the moment
of releasing the hydrogen an ebullition appeared in the tube similar to
that observed by Cailletet in oxygen, in his experiments made in 1882.
The phenomenon is produced in the same manner at a certain distance
from the bottom of the tube; it lasts for a much shorter time and is less
decided and much less easy to perceive. The reason of this difficulty
may perhaps be explained by the very low density of liquid hydrogen.
-Cailletet and Hautefeuille, in their researches on the density of oxygen,
hydrogen, and nitrogen liquefied in the ,resence of 1 liquid having no
action on these elements, have inferred that liquid hydrogen has a den-
sity of 0.033. Since the same method yielded under the same conditions
496 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

the number 0.89 for the density of oxygen, Wroblewski admits that the
figures 0.033 are not far from the truth. On the other hand, gaseous
hydrogen reaches this same density, 0.033, at a low temperature, under
inconsiderable pressures; hence arises an optical diffieulty in distin-
guishing the liquid from the gaseous hydrogen, a difficulty which prob-
ably prevented Wroblewski from reproducing Cailletet’s experiment on
hydrogen. The analogy between the phenomenon described and those
presented by oxygen permit the supposition that the temperature nec-
essary for the complete liquefaction of hydrogen is not far from that
which may be obtained by means of boiling oxygen. (Comptes rendus,
XCVII, January 28, 1884.)

Boiling Point of Hydrogen.—Dr. Edmund J. Mills, on purely mathemat-
ical considerations, has calculated the boiling point of hydrogen at —215°
C. This figure remains to be confirmed by Wroblewski and Olzewski,
who are separately engaged in investigating the subject. According to
the former, oxygen boils at —184° and nitrogen at —193°, under the ordi-
nary pressure. Olzewski, who uses a hydrogen thermometer, claims to
have measured a temperature of —215° C. (Chem. News, L, 179.)

Liquefaction of Oxygen by the Aid of Marsh Gas.—Cailletet has discov-
ered that marsh gas (formene) can be used to liquefy oxygen, without
employing mechanical means for lowering the temperature of boiling of
the cooling liquid. The formene is compressed and cooled in ethylene
boiling under atmospheric pressure ; in the liquid state it is very mobile,
and in vaporizing lowers the temperature sufficiently to immediately
liquefy oxygen. This process greatly simplifies the liquefaction of oxy-
gen gas. (Comptes rendus, XCIX, 1565.)

Atomic Weight of Carbon determined by Combustion of the Diamond, by
C. Friedel.—Having obtained, through the generosity of Mr. Chatrian,
a number of very fine white diamonds from Africa, the author made
combustions in a current of oxygen, with a view to determining the
atomic weight of carbon with unusual accuracy. The experiments gave
C=12.007 when O=16. The ashes remaining after the combustion were
small white flakes, yellowish in places, with small black spots. Some
were attracted by the magnet; several were transparent, and of these
some were acted on by polarized light, having preserved their crystal-
line form. The weight of the ashes was about 0.058 per cent. of the
diamond. ‘

During the combustion the diamond did not change into coke, as has
been claimed by others, but was merely roughened on the surface, as if
attacked by an acid. (Bull. soc. chim., XI, 100.)

The Atomic weight of Glucinum, by L. F. Nilson and Otto Pettersson.—
A few years ago these authors concluded, from their experiments on the
specific heat of glucinum, that the atomic weight of this element is 13 65,
CHEMISTRY. 497

and not9.1, as had been generally admitted. Lothar Meyer attempted
to show that their results are capable of a different interpretation, quite
in harmony with the atomic weight 9.1. Afterward Nilson replied to
Meyer, and, taking into account the specific heats of the oxide and sul-
phate of glucinum, found confirmation of his view that the atomic weight
is equal to 13.65. If this figure be correct, the periodic law receives a
serious blow, for with the larger atomic weight glucinum does not fit
into the scheme based on the law. In the article under review the
authors named give the results of the determination of the specific
gravity of gaseous glucinum chloride, and find that the correct formula
is BeCl,, in which the atomic weight is equal to9.1. In view of this re-
sult, they add, and of the fact that Avogadro’s law is, without exception
in the whole field of chemistry, the basis for the conception of the
molecule, we must give up the idea formerly held by us that gluci-
num is a trivalent element, to which we were led by the agreement
of the atomic heat (Be’’=13.65) with the law of Dulong, and the
humerous analogies between the physical constants (molecular heat
and volume) of the compounds of glucinum, on the one hand, and of
the rare metals scandium, erbium, yttrium, &c., on the other. While
recognizing in this important case the validity of the periodic law,
we at the same time call special attention to the singular fact that
the laws of Dulong and of Avogadro lead to exactly opposite conclu-
sions regarding the atomic weight and value of the element of gluci-
num, a fact which is unique in the field of metallic elements. (Ber. d.
chem. Ges., XVU, 987.)

Redetermination of the Atomic Weight of Cerium, by Henry Robinson.—
The author details the precautions taken in prepaiing the cerous chloride
and in conducting the experiments. The mean of seven determinations
of the chlorine (made-by titration with silver nitrate) gives 139.8584 as
the atomic weight of cerium if H=1, or 140.2154 if O=16. (Chem.
News, L, 251.)

Redetermination of the Atomie Weightof Platinum, by W. Halberstadt.-
Asa result of 97: analyses of no less than five different compounds of
platinum, conducted in two distinct series, the author finds for the
atomic weight of platinum the value 194.57592. (Berichte d. chem. Ges.,
XVII, 2962.)

Iodide of Nitrogen and its Use in Actinometry, by Antony Guyard.—
The author prepares iodide of nitrogen by acting on one gram of iodine
with 8 c. c. of aqua ammonia at 22° B. With less ammonia, the am-
monium iodide which forms removes some of the iodine from the prod-
uct. Exposed to direct or diffuse sunlight, the iodide of nitrogen is
immediately decomposed, with liberation of nitrogen, and the reaction
is so clean as to be useful in actinometry. Explosions result occasion-
ally if the iodide be subjected to the action of light under water, but
under ammonia at 22° B. the decomposition ensues quietly, with effer-
vescence. By determining the weight or volume of the nitrogen liber-
ated in a specified time, the reaction may be applied to measurement of
the energy of sunlight. The reaction is expressed thus: 2 NH,I=
NH,I,+ N. Iodide of nitrogen is decomposed rapidly, sometimes with
explosions, by dilute sulphuric and hydrochloric acids; it dissolves
without danger in sodium hyposulphite and in potassium sulphocyanide,
ammonia being set free. (Bull. soe. chim. [2], XI, 12.)

Antiseptic Value of Carbon Disulphide.—In October, Prof. Eug. Péligot
presented a paper to the French Academy of Sciences on the utility of
an aqueous solution of carbon disulphide in the treatment of the vine
attacked by phylloxera. He showed that the liquid is far more soluble
in water than the determinations made by Mr. Ckiandi established ; at
ordinary temperatures water dissolves 3.5 ¢. ¢. per liter, or 4.52 grams,
its density being 1.293. Its antiseptic properties have also been fully
confirmed by the further investigations of Pasteur, who anticipates that
it will become the most efficacious of all antiseptics, it being also the
cheapest, costing only a few centimes per liter. It is, moreover, the
best known insecticide, and has already rendered great services in the
destruction of phylloxera. At present 30,000 hectares (about 74,000
acres) of vineyards are yearly treated with over 4,000,000 kilograms
of carbon disulphide, with excellent results. When applied in the form
of potassium sulphocarbonate, it has a double action, the sulphur deriv-
atives killing the insect and the potash enriching the soil. (Nature,
Xxx, 628.)

Disinfection by Combustion of Carbon Disulphide.—Carbon disulphide
forms on burning, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. In consequence
of the yield of the latter product, the.liquid has been recommended by
a French commission as the best material for disinfecting rooms in
which patients suffering from contagious diseases had sojourned. The
liquid carbon disulphide is more easily burned than sulphur, and is less
injurious to furniture or metallic articles in the apartments.

Presence of Carbon in ordinary Phosphorus, by Ira Remsen and E. H.
Keiser.—As a contribution to the question regarding the action of moist
phosphorus on carbon monoxide, Professors Remsen and Keiser have
quantitatively determined the amount of carbon in ordinary phosphorus,

Researches on Titanium Compounds, by Otto Freiherr v. d. Pfordten.—
Kbelmen obtained TiS, by heating together titanium chloride and sul-
phuretted hydrogen; the author obtains TiS in small erystals by heat-
ing the disulphide in a current of hydrogen, carefully excluding oxy-
gen. The former is yellow, the latter black in color. Attempts to
reduce TiO, in a similar way yielded only the indigo-blue oxide Ti,O;
discovered by Deville. The author noticed the formation of gelatinous
titanic acid, analogous to the silicium compound, noticed by H. Rose in
his investigations. (Berichte d. chem. Ges., XvVU1, 727.)

Extraction of Cesium and Rubidium from Hebron Lepidolite, by F. C.
Robinson and C. C. Hutchins.—The authors recommend mixing the
_powdered mineral with an equal weight of fluor-spar and heating the
mixture for some hours in a sand-bath with strong sulphuric acid.
When cold the mass is broken up, lixiviated and filtered. The filtrate
contains the Cs, Rb, and K as alums, which are easily separated by their
great differences in solubility at 17°. One thousand grams lepidolite
yielded about 30 grams cesium and rubidium alums. (Am. Chem.
Journ., V1, 74.)

Electrolytic Magnesium.—Adolph Gritzel, of Hannover, Prussia, has
devised a method of preparing pure magnesium on a large scale by the

electrolysis of carnallite. This mineral, which abounds in the upper

part of the salt formation at Stassfurt, consists essentially of the chlo-
rides of magnesium and potassium with water, and contains from 31 to
36 per cent. of MgCl,. At the session of the German Chemical Society
in Berlin held March 10, 1884, Dr. Gratzel exhibited a bar of magnesium
weighing one-half kilogram and of great purity. The absence of sodium
is especially noted, a metal present in all commercial magnesium hith-
erto made. The electrolytic magnesium does not decompose water at
ordinary temperatures. If the new process will furnish magnesium in
abundance at a low price, the importance of this discovery will be very
great. (Berichte d. chem. Ges.)

Magnesium Hydrosulphide Solution as a Source of Hydrogen Sulphide,
by E. Divers and Tetsukichi Shimidzu.—The authors wishing to obtain
a regular stream of pure hydrogen sulphide found that this could be
effected by gently heating a solution of magnesium hydrosulphide.
Ordinary hydrogen sulphide (from ferrous sulphide and hydrochloric
acid) is passed into water containing magnesia in suspension. The gas
_ is absorbed and the magnesia dissolves. On heating the colorless so-
lution to 60°-65° it gives out a steady current of hydrogen sulphide,
free from hydrogen and from hydrogen arsenide. The maguesia which
is precipitated during the evolution of the gas may be again used in the
preparation of the magnesium hydrosulphide. (Chem. News, L, 293.)

Compounds of Chromium Sesquichloride with metallic Chlorides, by Abbé
Godefroy.—The author finds that the sesquichloride of chromium forms
with chlorides of several metals well defined and crystallized combina-
tions. The method of preparation is as follows: To obtain a compound
of chromium chloride with the chloride of a metal, R, pass a current of
chlorine gas into a mixture of 700 grams of alcohol and 300 grams of the
chromate (or dichromate) of R, until the liquid fumes freely when ex-
posed to the air. If the liquid separates into two layers, add enough
alcohol and continue to pass the chlorine. Decant, filter through glass
wool with the aid of a filter-pump, wash with concentrated HCl, and
dry on a plate of porcelain at a gentle heat. Transfer to dry and well-
corked bottles. These double salts are decomposed by water with the
formation of HCl. Bromides and iodides of chromium and the metals
are obtained in a similar manner. The potassium salt has the formula
4 KCl. Cr,Cle+2 HO. (Bull. soe. chim., xLi1, 194.)

Recovery of Zinc from the Residues of Pyrites—At the Wocklum Works
a process has been in operation for many years by which zine chloride
is recovered from the burnt pyrites. The burnt ore is lixiviated, thus
extracting the iron and cupric sulphates ; the lixivium is concentrated
to crystallization, is mixed with a quantity of sodium chloride equiva-
lent to the zine sulphate in the solution, and thereby deposits Glauber’s
salts, the value of which alone covers the whole expense of treatment.
Yhe mother liquid is concentrated; various mixed ferrous and sodium
sulphates crystallize out; the zine chloride remaining in solution is ob-
tained by evaporating to dryness. The dry salt contains, however,

On the Bromides of Tin, by Bohuslaw Rayman, and Karl Preis.—The
authors describe the dibromide and tetrabromides of tin, and several
compounds of the latter with other metallic bromides. SnBr, forms a
crystalline, yellowish, transparent mass, melting at 215.5° to a pale
yellow liquid. It forms with water a crystalline hydrate, which appears
in colorless needles or thin prismatic crystals, soluble in water with
turbidity. SnBr, distills at 196° to 198°, and the distillate solidifies to a
mass of crystals with a white, mother-of-pearl luster. They rapidly
deliquesce on exposure to the air, and form a hydrate, SnBr,.4 H,0.
The following compounds are also described : Stannohydrobromie acid
and its salts of sodium (Na,SnBr, + 6 H,O), of calcium, strontium, mag-
nesitun, manganese, iron (FeSnBr, + 6 HO), nickel, and cobalt; also the
oxybromide of tin (Sn3;BrgO0 + 12 H,O). (Liebiy’s Annalen, CCXXIH, 323.)

Permeability of Silver by Oxygen Gas, by L. Troost.—The author shows
that pure oxygen and the oxygen of the atmosphere are capable of
passing through the sides of a heated tube of silver, while only a trace
of nitrogen permeates the metal. Carbon monoxide and dioxide also
penetrate the silver, though less rapidly than oxygen. The author
CHEMISTRY. 5O1

suggests tliat pure oxygen may be manufactured from air on this prin-
ciple. The silver must not be heated above 800° C. (Comptes rendus,
XOvul, June 9, 1884.)

On Bismuthic Acid, by Carl Hoffmann.—The highest oxide of bismuth,
bismuthic acid, has the formula Bi,O;.. The potassium salt is obtained by
passing chlorine into a solution of potassium hydroxide (specific gravity
1.539) in which bismuth hydroxide is suspended. The operation is re-
peated three times, with the addition of fresh lye. The potassium bis-
muthate so obtained is of the composition 2 BiO,K + nBi,V;. Itisof a
red-brown or dark violet-brown color, and contains more or less potas-
sium according to the strength of the lye. By treating the body re-
peatedly with water holding carbon dioxide in solution, a lighter-brown
compound is formed, not quite free from potassium. These compounds
treated with acetic acid leave an orange-colored bismuthyl-bismuthate,
Bi,Os, and treated with dilute nitric acid, a yellow-brown body, Bi,O,.
(Liebig’s Annalen der Chemie, COXXIII, 110.)

The Alkali Industry, by Walter Weldon.—In our review of the prog-
ress of chemistry in 1883 we gave an abstract of Mr. Weldon’s paper
before the London section of the Society of Chemical Industry, Janu-
ary 8. This eminent authority on the alkali industry delivered (July
9, 1884) an address as retiring president of this society, in which he
continues to trace the decline of the Leblanc method and the increasing
growth of the ammonia method. The ammonia process being more than
70 per cent. cheaper than the Leblanc process per given quantity of soda,
the only claim the latter has for continuance is in its production of the
necessary article hydrochloric acid. In order to avoid closing Leblane
soda works, the makers have temporarily combined to reduce production
and force up prices.

One of the important problems connected with the ammonia-soda in-
dustry is the recovery of the chlorine at present thrown away in the eal-
cium chloride. Mond has recently patented the following process: The
residual liquor, consisting of a nearly saturated solution of sodium and
ammonium chlorides, is evaporated to such a degree that the sodium
chloride deposits, leaving the ammonium chloride in solution; this
is then evaporated todryness andthe solid salt treated with enough
sulphuric acid to convert it into hydroammonium sulphate, the chlorine
going off as HCl. The residual sulphate is then treated with free
ammonia, and so converted into neutral ammonium sulphate, for sale
as such, or it is sold to manufacturers of ammoniacal phosphatic fer-
tilizers. This process is, after all, not the recovery of chlorine from the
calcium chloride, but from the sodium chloride, and it involves, more-
over, a radical change in the process, viz, the abandonment of the plan
of regenerating the ammonia employed, and the necessity of finding a
sale for the ammonium sulphate produced. Mr. Mond is said to manu-
50? SCIENTIFIC RELORD FOR 1884.

facture 50,000 tons of ammonia-soda annually; and if the above process
were applied to the whole of the product, he would not only produce
128,000 tons of ammonium sulphate, but he would be obliged to consume
one-third more ammonia than the total quantity at present produced in
all Great Britain and Ireland. Obviously the process cannot be exten-
sively applied so long as we depend on the distillation of coal for am-
monia.

A combination of the first step in Aue Leblane process, and the sub-
stitution of sodium sulphate for the chloride in the subsequent treat-
ment by the ammonia process, has been found theoretically possible, but
its commercial merits remain to be proven. The natural objection to
this modification is that the first step of the Leblane process is the
costly one.

Messrs. Carey, Gaskell, and Hurter have devised a more practicable
process, based upon the decomposition of sodium sulphate by bicarbo-
nate of ammonia, and the recovery of both the ammonia and the sul-
phuric acid. These chemists find that if a mixture of equivalent quan-
tities of ammonium sulphate and sodium sulphate be heated to fusion,
and steam be injected into the liquid mass, the whole of the ammonia is
set free, and the sulphuric acid combines with the sodium salt, forming :
hydro-sodium sulphate, which alone remains behind. This hydro-sodium
sulphate can then be used to decompose sodium chloride. The nor-
mal sodium sulphate resulting is decomposed by bicarbonate of aneno-
nia, with production of bicarbonate of soda and ammonium sulphate,
which last can be used to repeat the first step. These processes have
the advantage of no waste, a merit not shared by the Leblanc process,
invented ninety-Sseven years ago by the immortal Nicholas. (Chem.
News, 1, 41.)

Use of Nickel Vessels for Operations with fixed Alkalies, by Professor
Dittmar.—Fleitmann, in 1879, suspecting that the brittleness of nickel ;
was due to the presence of occluded carbonic oxide, had the happy
thought of fusing the metal with a small proportion (one-eighth part) of
magnesium, and obtained thereby a regulus capable of being rolled into
thin sheets and drawn into fine wires. Since this important discovery
the inventor has made a business of manufacturing kitchen utensils
which are nickel inside and outside, with a core of iron between. Basins
of this make are found by Professor Dittmar very useful in operations
with caustic alkali solutions, and they are far cheaper than silver.
These nickelized vessels cannot be used with fused potassium or so-
dium hydroxides, since the latter attack strongly every metal save
gold. (Chem. News, L, 3.)

Constituents of Snow- Water, by Dr. Elwyn Waller.—A sample of snow

While the water was settling, a slimy fungoid growth collected on
the bottom and sides of the vessel. The presence of volcanic ash (pre-
sumably from Krakatoa) was not established. (Chem. News, L, 49.)

Occurrence of Manganese in Plants and Animals, by E. Maumené.—
_ Wheat, rye, rice, and barley are shown to contain manganese, probably
combined with an organic acid. The bran and starch of wheat do not
contain the element. It is also found in potatoes, beets, carrots, lentils,
peas, parsley, and in exceedingly minute quantities in apples and grapes.
It is found in a large proportion in cocoa, still larger in coffee, and most
of all in tea. It is absent in oranges, lemons, onions, &c. Human
blood does not always contain it; very small traces occur in milk, urine,
bones, and hair. It is almost entirely eliminated in the solid excrements,
and should be régarded as non-essential to life; hence manganese
must not be substituted for iron in medicine. (Comptes rendus, XCVI11,
June 9, 1884.)

Notes on Explosives.—Panclastite, the new explosive invented by
Eugene Turpin, consists essentially of a mixture of liquid nitrogen
tetroxide with carbon disulphide in the proportions of 3 N,O, + 2 C&,.
The mixture is exploded by a fulminate primer, with a result more
powerful than that of nitro-glycerine. If ignited without confinement
in a vessel it burns with a brilliant flame, which M. Turpin proposes to
utilize as a signal in the field or for photographie purposes. The heat
of combustion is also very great, being estimated at about 3,000° C.;
platinum fuses instantly under the action of this flame. The advantages
claimed for this explosive are greater power than dynamite. perfect
safety of the separate constituents in transport and storage, insen-
sitiveness of the mixture to blows, and easy control of the manufacture
by the Government, owing to the fact that nitrogen tetroxide is not
met with in commerce.

Explosive gelatine, or gelatine dynamite, is made by dissolving photo-
graphie gun-cotton in nitro-glycerine, or by mixing nitro-glycerine with
collodion, removing the solvent by evaporation. The solution is aided
by heat, and yields a gelatinous mass of a consistency varying with the

amount of the soluble gun-cotton. The jelly is very insensitive to blows.
and is not easily exploded, requiring a very powerful fuse. and is not
injured by water. It is said to be 75 per cent. stronger than dynamite,
and it is very free from liability to accident or injury in use or trans-
portation. Onthe other hand, its stability is questioned. General Abbot
found that samples underwent spontaneous decomposition, separating
into cellulose and free nitro-glycerine, with a copious evolution of nitrous
fumes.

Sir Frederick Abel, chief of the chemical bareau of the Woolwich
Arsenal, had a miraculous escape from death early in March, 1884.
He was barely ninety feet from the place where 1,000 kilograms of gun-
cotton accidentally exploded with terrific violence; he was knocked
down by the concussion and injured in several places by flying missiles,
but in no wise dangerously. Sir Frederick ascribes his wonderful escape
to the fact that a strong wind was blowing at the time from him to-
wards the scene of the explosion. (Munroe’s Notes on the Literature of
Explosives, No. V1.)

Toughening Gold and Silver in the Crucible-—Dr. James C. Booth, of
the United States mint, Philadelphia, describes a general method of
refining gold in the crucible as practiced in the mint. Some brittle
gold, having been accidentally melted with a quantity of well-refined
and tough gold, was found to have rendered the whole mass very brittle,
with a highly crystalline fracture, and therefore useless for coinage. To
avoid loss of time and greater cost of refining by acid, it was toughened
wholly by fluxing. This was accomplished on 75,162.55 ounces (5,154
pounds avoirdupois) in one and a half days, at a trifling cost, and with
scarcely apparent loss. The 75,000 ounces were divided into fourteen
melts of about 5,400 ounces each, and each melt was separately tough-
ened. The ingots, easily broken into pieces by striking them on the edge
of a wooden box, were put into the crucible with soda ash and anhydrous
fused borax, in the ratio of 1 or 2 ounces to a melt, until the crucible
was nearly full. It then appeared as a quiet mass of metal covered
with a rather viscid slag, disposed to swell and puff. A few crystals of
saltpeter, say 1 or 2 ounces, were then dropped successively into the
center of the metallic surface, and, as they melted, their spreading out
over the whole surface was aided by the conceutric motion of the bot-
tom of a small crucible. The moment the visible oxidizing action began
to slacken the melter skimmed off by a small black-lead dipping cruci-
ble the fluxed matter, as rapidly as was consistent with the care neces-
sary to avoid taking up metal. The remainder in the melting-pot
was the toughened metal. The points to be noted are (1) that one
part of foreign matter sufficed to impart brittleness to 75,000 parts of
good standard gold; (2) by aslight oxidizing process the matter causing
brittleness was removed with no appreciable loss of gold; (3) moreover,
the ratio of copper remained constant after the fluxing; (4) the tough-

ening proceeds from the top downward to the depth of 9 to 12 inches of
its own accord. (Chem. News, L, 37.)

Determination of Nitrogen by Combustion with Calcium Hydroxide.—
Prof. 8S. W. Johnson showed in 1873 (Am. Chemist, 111, 161) that the
mixture of sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide proposed by Will
and Varrentrapp as a reagent for converting organic nitrogen into am-
monia, for the purpose of analysis, may be advantageously replaced by
a mixture of sodium carbonate and calcium hydroxide. In the Annual
Report of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station for 1883,
the same chemist gives a series of analyses made with calcium hydrox-
ide alone, and the results warrant this further simplification of the
Willand Varrentrapp method for most substances ordinarily encountered
in technical work. A tube 14 inches long is recommended for the com-
bustion of 0.5 grams of substances containing 8 per cent. of nitrogen or
less. Cochineal solution is preferred as an indicator, being not seriously
atfected by carbonic acid, quite sensitive in its reaction, and keeping
better than litmus. (Am. Chem. Journ., VI, 60.)

Occurrence of Zine in Drinking- Water.—Mr. C. W. Heaton reports find-
ing 6.41 grains per gallon of zine carbonate in a drinking-water carried
from a spring through half a mile of galvanized iron pipe. The spring
water itself was very pure, containing no ammonia, only nitrogen as a
nitrate; this, however, was wholly converted into ammonia by the zine.
(Chem. News, XLIX, 85.)

Prof. F. P. Venable, of the University of North Carolina, also calls
attention to this impurity. The water from a spring 200 yards distant
was brought by galvanized iron pipes to a dwelling hoase, and there
stored in a zine-lined tank, which was painted with white lead. The
water became somewhat turbid and metallic-tasting, and its use for
drinking purposes was discontinued. Analyses were made after the
pipes had been in use about one year. A somewhat full analysis of the
spring water was made by Mr. J. C. Roberts. The analyses of water
from the tank and directly from the pipe are carried out only so far as
ziuc, iron, and tests for lead were concerned. The results are caleu-
lated in grains per gallon of 231 cubic inches:

The tank contained 4.48 grains of zine carbonate per gallon, with a
trace of iron and no lead. Water from the pipe gave 4.29 grains of
zine carbonate per gallon and a trace of iron.

It is evident, then, when the dangerous nature of zine as a poison is
taken into consideration, that the use of zine-coated vessels in connec-
tion with water or any food-liquid should be avoided.

Ammonium Fluoride as a Blowpipe Reagent, by Prof. N. W. Lord.—The
author recommends ammonium fluoride as a substitute for hydro-potas-
sium sulphate and fluor-spar in developing flame colorations. It has
the advantages of being free from fixed alkali and of being easily ap-
plied. For testing feldspar or similar silicates a little of the powdered
mineralis mixed with ammonium fluoride, placed on a piece of platinum,
and moistened with sulphuric acid; the mixture is gently warmed,
taken upon a loop of platinum wire, and tested in the flame of a Bunsen
burner or of the blowpipe. The alkali Hame is nearly as well shown
as with the pure salts. A slight change in treatment renders the re-
agent very useful in detecting boron. A high heat must be avoided.
The delicacy of the reaction is surprising. (Engineering and Mining
Journal.)

The Reversion of Phosphoric Acid has been further investigated by
Thomas 8. Gladding. In a previous paper he showed that commercial
superphosphates contain the reverted phosphoric acid in three forms—
combined with lime, with iron, and with alumina. The artificially pre-
pared phosphate of lime (whether dicalcie or tricaleie form) is, under
given conditions, wholly soluble in a neutral solution of citrate of am-
monia at the temperature of 40° C., while the iron and alumina phos-
phates treated in the same way become largely insoluble. The citrate
of ammonia solution dissolves every form of reverted phosphate at a
temperature of 65° (150° F.), and hence should be used at this tempera-
ture. ‘These points are fully sustained in the present publication by ad-
ditional experiments, and the investigation is extended to a-considera-
tion of the reversion of soluble phosphates in artificial and natural soils.

The author recommends the following method of analysis of super-
phosphates, based on the principles stated :

(a) Preparation of Sample.—Pass the sample through a twelve-mesh
sieve. If too wet, a portion must be air-dried and then sifted, and an
allowance made by calculation for loss of moisture.

(b) Determination of Moisture.—Dry 5 or 10 grams at 100° C.

(c) Determination of Total Phosphoric Acid.—Weigh 2 grams, brush
into a 200 c. ¢. flask, add 50 c. ¢. nitric acid, together with several ec. ec. HCl
when working with difficulty soluble iron and alumina phosphates.
Boil gently for fifteen minutes, cool, fill to mark, mix, filter through a
dry filter-paper into a dry receiver, take 50 c¢. c. of filtrate, place ina
beaker, add 25 c. c. concentrated ammonia, then nitric acid to acidity.
To the hot liquid add molybdie solution, let stand for one hour at about

- ~

CHEMISTRY. 507

65° C., filter, wash with nitrate of ammonia solution, dissolve on paper
with hot ammonia solution, and wash with same. Run in magnesia mix-
ture from a burette at the rate of one drop a second, stirring con-
stantly. Let stand several hours, filter, wash with ammonia solution,
dry, ignite to whiteness, and weigh.

(d) Determination of Soluble Phosphoric Acid.—Weigh 2 grams, rub up
in a mortar with a soft, rubber-tipped pestle (grinding is avoided), digest
in 25 ¢. c. of cold water, decant clear liquid into a filter-paper, filtering
into a 200 c. c. flask, add 25 ¢. c. of water to residue, digest for several
minutes, and again decant. Repeat five or six times, and finally bring
all upon the filter-paper and wash till flask is filled to the mark. Mix,
take 50 c. c., and estimate P.O; as in (ce).

(e) Determination of Insoluble Phosphoric Acid.—Wash the residue upon
the paper into a 200 c. ¢. flask with 100 ce. ¢. citrate solution, cork the
flask, digest in a water-bath at constant temperature 65° C, (150° F.)
for thirty minutes, with frequent agitation. Filter the warm solution
quickly (by the aid of a filter-pump if convenient) and wash with cold
water. Return paper and contents to the same 200 e¢. ec. flask, add 50
e. ¢. nitric acid, boil for 15 minutes, and estimate the P.O; as in (¢).

(7) Determination of Reverted Phosphoric Acid.—The soluble + insolu-
ble phosphoric acid subtracted from the total will give the reverted
phosphoric acid.

Memoranéa.—The molybdic solution is made, as usual, to contain 5 per
cent. MoQ;, and 60 ¢. ¢. are used to every 0.100 gram P,O;. The mag-
nesia mixture is made up as follows: 110 grams eryst. MgCl, 300 grams
NH,Cl, 400 c. ce. cone. ammonia, 1,500 ¢. ¢. water; 10 ¢. ¢. are used to
every 0.100 gram P,O;. The citrate solution is made of specific gravity
1.09, carefully neutralized. The ammonia solution contains 1 part
strongest ammonia to 3 parts of water. The nitrate of ammonia so-
Intion is a 10 per cent. solution, slightly acidified with nitric acid. (Am.
Chem. Journ., VI, 1.)

ORGANIC.

Nomenclature of Organic Compounds.—As the prodigious number of
organic bodies rapidly augments, the difficulty of providing for them a
satisfactory system of terminology likewise increases. Prof. Adolf
Baeyer proposes certain changes and some novelties; he favors the
use of the letter B to express the benzene-ring, and of the letters Py to
indicate the pyridine-ring, employing them as in the following example:

B-1, 4-dichloro-Py-1, 3-dioxychinoline.
He also proposes to use the Greek letter @to denote the first carbon
atom in case of the derivatives, this to be followed by a, 6, vy, &c., as

usual. To distinguish substitutions in the rings from those in the side
chains the author proposes to employ the syllable eso in the first in-
s

508 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

stance and evo in the second. Thus, we might have esotrichlor-exo-
dichlor-ethylbenzene, a name self-explanatory.

Prof. H. Kolbe subsequently attacked these proposed innovations in
a severe and sarcastic manner. (Berichte d. chem. Ges., Xvit, 960.)

* Production of Hydroxylamine from Nitric Acid, by Edward Divers.—In
investigating the reducing action of various metals upon nitric acid the
author finds that the action of tin, zinc, cadmium, magnesium, and
aluminium gives rise to the production of hydroxylamine, especially in
the presence of hydrochloric or sulpburic acids. The function of the
second acid is to decompose the nitrate as fast as it is produced, and so
(1) to hold the hydroxylamine in a more stable state, (2) to preserve
it from the destructive action of nitrous acid by preventing the forma-
tion of this acid trom the reaction of the metal on the nitrate, aud (3)
to determine the reduction of the nitric acid to hydroxylamine by sup-
plying the hydrogen for reproducing it. The author divides metals
into two classes, according to their action on nitric acid. In the first
class are silver, copper, mercury, and bismuth; these metals form
nitrite, nitrate, and water, and exert no further action, producing neither
ammonia nor hydroxylamine. They decompose the nitric acid into
hydroxyl! and nitroxyl, combining with these radicals to form hydrate
and nitrite, which by secondary reactions become water, nitrous acid,
and metal nitrate. They therefore separate nitrogen from oxygen
(hydroxyl) in decomposing nitric acid, and not hydrogen from oxygen.

In the second class are tin, zinc, cadmium, magnesium, aluminium,
lead, iron, and the alkali metals; these form ammonia and generally
hydroxylamine, but do not produce nitrous acid or nitrite with free
nitric acid. On the other hand, they readily form nitrite by acting on
their own nitrate. Two actions are noted: First, upon seven molecules
of acid separating as hydroxylamine, the hydrogen of six of them form-
ing nitrate and leaving the seventh converted to water and the said
hydroxylamine ; Second, they combine with hydroxylamine to form me-
tal-ammonium hydrate, which decomposes with water into metal-hydrate
and ammonia. The author considers that nitrites have a constitution
indicated by the name “nitronates,” the metal being directly united to
their nitrogen. The radical is the same as that existing in nitrates—
NO,—these being its metal-oxyl compounds. (Am. J. Sci., CXXVU,
234, abstract from Journ. Chem. Soc., XLII, 443.)

Action of Nitrous Anhydride on Glycerine, by Orme Masson.—At the
ordinary temperature glycerine absorbs nitrous anhydride rapidly, loses
its viscidity, and turns yellow; the temperature soon rises and nitric
oxide is evolved, with decomposition of the product. If, however, the
glycerine is well cooled and the nitrous anhydride is dried over calcium
chloride, the decomposition is arrested. As the gas is absorbed, the

ih at ie Daeg eas

CHEMISTRY. 509

volume of the liquid increases greatly (24 times) and the yellow color
passes to brown, and at the end of the reaction toa dark green. The
products form two layers; one is aqueous and contains nitrous acid
and the oxidation produets of glycerine; the other, which is three times
greater in volume, contains chiefly a nitrous ether of glycerine. ‘To
isolate the latter the two layers are separated, and the larger portion is
distilled on a water-bath in a strong current of hydrogen. The dis-
tillate is the trinitrous ether of glycerine, C;H;(NO,)3, mixed probably
with the dinitrous compound.

This new body is a yellow, mobile liquid, volatile at ordinary temper-
atures, distilling at 150°, and decomposing in part with liberation of
reddish vapors. Its density at 10° is 1.291. It burns with a white flame
and does not detonate when struck. It has a strong nitrous odor. It
is soluble in ether, in chloroform, and in benzine, and insoluble in car-
bon disulphide. It dissolves in acetic acid, with a green color and lib-
eration of NO; it is rapidly reduced by H.S; it is decomposed by
K,CO;, forming KNO;. This ether is insoluble in water, but the latter
liberates NO at the point of contact, especially when warmed or agi-
tated. Exposed to the air in presence of moisture the body forms crys-
tals of oxalic acid. It cannot be preserved in sealed tubes, for it spon-
taneously decomposes with evolution of gas in such quantities as to
break them. (Journ. Chem. Soc., XLII, 341.)

Synthesis of a Coloring Matter similar to that of Litmus, by M. C. Traub
and C. Hock.—By the action of small quantities of sodium nitrite on
resorcine at 150° a deep-blue material is obtained, which is reddened
by an acid in the same manner as a litmus solution.

The best method of preparing the new body is as follows: 100 parts
of resorcine, 5 of sodium nitrite, and 5 of water are heated in a flask
over an oil-bath gradually to 110°. The yellow mass becomes darker
and a lively reaction sets in, necessitating moderation of heat; the con-
tents of the flask becomes raspberry-red and the action is quieter ;
then the heat is increased to 115°, or 120° at the highest, ammonia be-
ing disengaged and the material becoming blue.

The deep-blue solution is diluted and a quantity of hydrochloric acid
is added, forming a precipitate, which is collected on a filter and dried.
As thus obtained it forms a shining, red-brown, amorphous body, insol-
uble in chloroform, benzene, and benzine, and soluble in methyl-, ethyl-
and amyl-alcohol, in ether, and pure water. All these solutions show
a peculiar red color, which is turned to blue by the slightest trace of an
alkali. The alkaline solution shows a broad band in its spectrum near
the line D, which shades off toward E. In acid solution it cuts off the
more refrangible parts of the spectrum.

The exact nature of this substance is under investigation. (Berichte
d, chem Ges. XVII, 2615.)

warm water and inalcohol. It is without action on alkaline copper solu-
tions, is optically inactive, and cannot be fermented by the aid of yeast.

The ripe nuts of Laurus persea contain 6 to 8 per cent. of the sugar. —

Synthesis of Umbelliferone and of Daphnetine, by H. von Pechmann.—
In 1866 Zwenger and Sommer discovered in the bark of the spurge
laurel, and in the products of the dry distillation of the resins of um-

belliferone. Later researches showed it to be paraoxycumarine—

The author has made this synthetically by the action of resorcine on
malice acid.

By the action of pyrogallol on malic acid the author obtained daph-
netine, a derivative of daphnine, a glucoside occurring in the spurge
laurel (Daphne mezereum). This synthesis proves it to be dioxycumarine;
its identity with the natural product was fully established. Daphnine
is isomeric with wesculine, and further researches by the author are in
progress with a view toits synthesis. (Berichte d. chem. Ges., XVI, 929.)

On the Physiology of the Carbohydrates in the Animal System, by F. W

tion. Beginning with the stomach, the attempt is made to follow the

changes in these substances as they proceed towards absorption, up to
their arrival within the portal system of vessels. The experiments were
performed upon the digestive organs of freshly-killed rabbits, portions
of the stomach or intestines being left in contact, for a given time, witb
solutions of known weights of the carbohydrate in question, and the
copper-reducing value of the substance, after this digestion, was com-
pared with that which it had been found to have before contact with
the animal substance. Inasmuch as grape-sugar is characterized by
the property of possessing the same reducing power after treating with
sulphuric acid as before, while the carbohydrates which represent steps
in an operation of which glucose is the final product are altered in re-
ducing power by the action of the acid, the author took the precaution
to boil one portion of the modified liquid with sulphuric acid in all cases
before estimating the reducing power. The copper-reducing value of
the digested liquid may thus be compared with that of glucose, while
the relation of the modified product to glucose is also ascertained. The
most striking result of these experiments is the indication that trans-
formation of glucose into bodies of lower reducing power is possible
under the influence of a ferment existing in the stomach and intestines.
Boiling of the animal substance with water previous to the experiment
was found to annul the action of this ferment. The latter body seems
to exist rather within the walls of the vessels examined than upon the
mucous surface. So far as the experiments have gone, the author re-
gards them as indicating that this ferment is more abundant in the
stomach and intestines of the rabbit than in those of the dog, cat, horse,
sheep, or pig. (A. A. B., from Chem. News, XLix, 140.)

Kanarine, a new Dyestuff, by W. Markownikow.—The preparation
of this dyestuff, discovered in 1883 by O. Miller, is as follows:

Dissolve one part of sulphocyanide of potassium in two parts of
water, and add about one-fifth of the total amount (one-half part) of po-
tassium chlorate and one part of hydrochloric acid. The reaction begins
in a few minutes, with evolution of gas and the formation of a yellow
precipitate; the vessel is placed in cold water, and the rest of the potas-
sium chlorate and another part of hydrochloric acid is added to the mix-
ture. The temperature should not fall below 80°. An orange-colored
precipitate results, which is crude kanarine; this is then purified by
solution in warm caustic-potash solution and precipitation with alcohol.

Dried at 100° pure kanarine forms a red-brown powder, with an
almost metallic luster. It is insoluble in water, alcohol, ether, and ben-
zene, but easily dissolves in alkaline solutions. Kanarine is destined
to become an important dye-stuff, since it can be fixed on vegetable fibers
without a mordant. It possesses great tinctorial power and is a fast
color. (Journ. d. Russ. phys.-chem. Ges., 1584 (1), 380.)

On the Fractional Distillation of American Petroleum, by D. Mende-
lejett—In the fractional distillation of petroleum from Baku the author

noted an abnormal feature, viz, the rise in temperature from 55° to 629,
80° to 90°, and 105° to 110° was accompanied by a decrease in the spe-
cific gravity of the portions distilling at the temperatures named. A
carefully conducted fractional distillation of petroleum of American
origin showed that this has the same peculiarity. The petroleum was dis-
tilled in an apparatus arranged so that the result was equivalent to 50
simple distillations. At 60° very little distilled over, the specific grav-
ity was 0.6642 at 17° C. and rose to 0.7347 at 80° C., products being
collected separately every 2° of rise. The first decrease in specific
gravity occurred at 92°, the distillate showing at 75° aspecific gravity
of 0.7069. A regu'ar increase in the specific gravity followed up to
104°, at which point the specific gravity was 0.7543; then a decrease
was noted, the distillate at 115° to 117° having the specific gravity
0.7270. From 117° to 125° the specific gravity increased regularly.
The author ascribes the failure of others to notice this peculiarity to

the lack of delicacy in the distillations previously conducted. (Protok. -

d. Russ. phys.-chem. Ges., 1884, 458.)

Composition of Chlorophyll—Dr. Adolph Hansen has published im-
portant investigations on the nature of chlorophyll. Chemists will re-
member that Frémy claimed that green chlorophyll consisted of a blue
and a yellow constituent. He mixed an ethereal chlorophyll solution
with hydrochloric acid, when two layers formed, a lower blue layer
and an upper yellow ethereal layer; the blue coloring matter was named
by Frémy phy!locyanin and the yellow phylloxanthin. Hansen shows,
however, that this is not due to a splitting up of the chlorophyll green
into a blue and a yellow component, but only an incomplete separation
of the chlorophyll green from the chlorophyll yellow, the former becom-
ing changed to blue by the hydrochloric acid. He farther shows that
an ethereal solution of pure chlorophyll green treated with hydrochloric
acid does not furnish any yellow constituent, the ethereal layer remain-
ing colorless.

It will be remembered that Kraus also supposed he had decomposed
cblorophyll green into a blue-green anda yellow component; he called
the blue-green cyanophyll, the yellow body xanthophyll. Hansen shows,
however, that Kraus is wrong, and his supposed decomposition is only
an incomplete separation, and that his cyanophyll is nothing more than
an ordinary chlorophyll solution from which a part of the yellow color-
ing matter has been removed. Both Frémy and Kraus were correct in
assuming the existence of yellow and of green bodies, but mistaken in
supposing they existed in combination. Hansen shows that they exist
side by side, and that chlorophyll is a mixture of these coloring matters.

Inpreparing pure chlorophyll Hansen used the leaves of young wheat-
plants. These are first boiled to remove extractives, the water is
decanted, and the material washed; it is quickly dried at a low tem-
perature, and then extracted sith alcohol of 96 per cent., in a dark room,
CHEMISTRY. 513

to prevent decomposition of the chlorophyll by light. The extraction
with alcohol was repeated and the united solutions were concentrated
and saponified. This saponification was carried out thus: The alcoholic
extract was treated with a moderate quantity of caustic-soda solution (1
part NaHO to5 H,O) ata boiling temperature. The alcohol is evaporated
by degrees, water is added, and the soap separated by the aid of sodium
chloride, the soap precipitating in granular form. It is then shaken in
a separating funnel with petroleum ether, which assumes a dark-yellow
color, since it removes only the yellow constituent. On evaporating the
ethereal solution the yellow constituent remains; it crystallizes in dark-
yellow needles and gives all the chemical and spectrum reactions on! a
lipochrome.

The soap is next treated with ether, which removes various impuri-
ties, and then with a mixture of alcohol and ether, which removes the
green constituent ; and this, after purification, crystallizes in ‘sphero-
crystals” of great beauty. From 450 grams dried wheat-leaves Hansen
obtained 3 to 4 grams solid coloring matter.

In the solid state chlorophyll green is opaque and does not fluoresce;
in sclution it possesses a red fluorescence.

Chlorophyll yellow occurs in small proportion as compared with chloro-
phyll green (1: 100). Its solutions show no fluorescence. It possesses
the reactions of Krukenberg’s lipochromes, viz, a blue coloration with
sulphuric acid, the same with nitric acid, and a green-blue with a mix-
- ture of iodine in potassium iodide. It shows three bands in the blue
half of the spectrum, but no absorption of red.

Chlorophyll green has four bands in the red half of the spectrum,
agreeing with the four bands of the ordinary chlorophyll solutions. (C.

Composition and Methods of Analysis of Human Milk, by Dr. Albert R.
Leeds.—In this comprehensive memoir the author gives results of the
examination of eighty samples of hnman milk. After a careful study
of many methods of analysis, he greatly prefers that devised by Ritt-
hausen and modified by Gerber, the main points of which are as follows:
(1) The total solids are determined by evaporating 5 grams in a plati-
num capsule, after coagulating with absolute alcohol. (2) Ash: The
residue is ignited gently and then to a dull-red heat. (3) The albumi-
noids are precipitated by sulphate of copper solution, with the addition
of sufficient potassium hydroxide solution to exactly neutralize the ex-
cess of the sulphate. (4) The precipitate is separated by filtration, with
due precautions, and treated with ether to extract fat; the residue,
dried at 110° (less the weight of ash), gives the amount of albuminoids.
(5) The filtrate from the albuminoids, with washings, is used for the
determination of milk-sugar by Febling’s solution. Results are very
satisfactory.

With the exception of the ash, these figures agree very closely with
those of Konig, deduced from the analysis of 190 samples by a great
variety of methods. K6nig’s mean for albuminoids is 1.95, Leeds’s 1.995;
2 per cent., therefore, may be regarded as the average amount of albu-
minoids in woman’s milk.

The author considers also the relations between the physical history
of the milk and its composition, especially the (1) color, taste, consist-
ency, and specific gravity ; (2) age of the mother; (3) period of lactation
and interval since nursing ; (4) nationality ; (5) physical constitution of
the mother.

Unlike cow’s milk, the appearance is no indication of the quality of
the fluid. Bluish samples often contain most fat, while thin samples
often give most total solid matter. A fatty acid of a greenish color was
extracted from human milk, which the author thinks is particularly
characteristic, and unlike anything obtained from cow’s-milk. Unfort-
unately the entire mass of fats was lost by accident in the early stages
of manipulation. The characteristic point was the emerald-green color
of the ethereal extract of the copper albuminate obtained from numerous
samples. . jie

The results of analysis are presented in a graphic chart, which exhib-
its in a striking manner the great variability in the constitution of
woman’s milk. (Read before the College of Physicians of Philadelphia,
May 7, 1884, and published in Chem. News, L, 263 et seq.)

Continuous Etherifieation as applied to other Alcohols than Ethylic, by L.

H. Norton and C. F. Prescott.—The authors worked upon mixtures of -

various alcohols with sulphuric acid and studied the conditions neces-
sary to produce the best results. Beginning with ethyl alcohol, they
found that by dropping the alcohol into mixtures of sulphuric acid and
alcohol, with boiling-points ranging from 120° to 150° C., they obtained
fiom 7.35 to 28.87 per cent. of the theoretical yield of ether. The best
temperature to obtain the maximum yield of ether was found to be from
140° to 145° C., higher temperatures giving no greater yield, while lower

ones gave less. At 160° C. the formation of ether stops, sulphurous
acid is evolved, and decomposition takes place. The same results are
obtained with propyl aleohol. With isobutyl alcohol decomposition
takes place at 120° to 135° C. In the case of isoamyl alcohol the decom-
position occurs at 100°C. By mixing the alcohols the authors obtained
mixed ethers by the same treatment as with single aleohols. By mixing
methy] and ethyl alcohols in molecular proportions, they obtained
methyl-ethyl ether in large quantity, together with methyl ether and
ethyl ether. Applied to ethyl and propyl alcohols, the corresponding
ethyl-propyl ether was obtained. But a mixture of ethylic and isobu-
tylic alcohols did not give ethyl-isobutyl ether, and methyl-isoamyl
ether was not obtained from the corresponding alcohols. The conclu-
sions of the authors are that the method of continuous etherification
is only applicable in the case of simple ethers, and does not work with
those containing more than three atoms of carbon. (Am. Assoc. Adv.
Science, Philadelphia meeting.)

Liquid Paraffin a Reagent for detecting Water in Alcohol, Ether, and
Chloroform, by Léon Crismer.—The new German Pharmacopeia treats
of a little-known substance called “liquid paraffin.” It forms an oily
liquid, consisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons of the methane series,
boiling, under 6™" pressure, between 215° and 240° C.

This substance mixes in all proportions with chloroform and ether
when they are deprived of water by means of sodium, and forms clear
solutions; but the slighest trace of water, or of alcohol containing water,
renders the liquid turbid; hence the liquid paraffin forms a delicate test
for water in alcohol. Direct experiments show that by it ;3, volume
of water can be detected in alcohol. It forms a useful reagent for recog-
nizing absolute aleohol. Liquid paraffin readily dissolves chlorine, bro-
mine, and iodine, and colorless phosphorus to aless degree. The author
uses the substance in question in the preparation of hydrobromic and
hydroiodic acids, as well as of iodide of ethyl. The fact that it is not
volatile is of great advantage. (Berichte d. chem. Ges., XV, 649.)

Glucose.—In response to a request made by the Commissioner of In-
ternal Revenue of the United States, a committee of the National Acad-
emy of Sciences, consisting of Profs. George F. Barker, William H.
Brewer, Wolcott Gibbs, Charles F. Chandler, and Ira Remsen, has
published an exhaustive report on glucose. The letter of the Commis-
sioner called for information “ as to the composition, nature, and prop-
erties of the article commercially known as ‘glucose’ or ‘ grape-sugar’;
its saccharine quality as compared with cane-sugar or molasses; and
also especially as to its deleterious effect when used as-an article of food
or drink, or as a constituent element of such articles.” Accordingly
the report gives details concerning the history, manufacture, and use of
starch-sugar, with statistics showing the magnitude of the industry ;
it also describes the nature of the commercial products, and narrates
516 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

the results of new experiments to determine whether the use of glucose
is injurious to health.

There are twenty-nine factories of starch-sugar in the United Srates,
using, as nearly as can be estimated, 43,000 bushels of corn per day.
yielding products of the annual value of nearly $10,000,000. In Ger-
many the industry is an old one; in 1881~82 there were thirty-nine
factories, consuming over 70,000 tons of starch and producing about
40,000 tons of starch-sugar.

The products are of various grades, appearing in’commerce under the
following names: (A) Liquid varieties: Glucose, mixing-glucose, mixing-
sirup, corn-sirup, jelly-glucose, confectioners’ crystal glucose. (B) The
solid varieties: Solid grape-sugar, clipped grape-sugar, granulated grape-
sugar, powdered grape-sugar, confectioners’ grape-sugar, brewers’ grape-
sugar. The process of manufacture consists, first, in extracting the
starch from the corn in a state of sufficient purity, then transforming this
into sugar by treatment with dilute acid, and subsequently neutralizing
the acid, purifying, and concentrating the product. The steps in the ex-
traction of starch are steeping, grinding, mechanical separation, cleans-
ing, collecting, and washing. A bushel of corn weighing 56 pounds
yields, on the average, 30 pounds of starch, 14 pounds of cattle food, and 12
pounds of waste. The transformation of the starch into sugar, termed
conversion, is effected in either open or closed converters ; the former are
wooden vats of 3,000 to 4,000 gallons capacity, the latter are copper
vessels furnished with safety-valves and capable of withstanding a
pressure of six atmospheres. The acid used is usually sulphuric, and
the quantity employed varies with the object of the manufacturer, the
liquid product requiring less acid than the solid; the proportion varies
from one-half pound oil of vitriol to 14 pounds per 100 pounds of starch.
In the open converter the starch and acid liquid are boiled until the
iodine test ceases to give a blue color, which usually requires about four
hours. In the closed converter less time is required, since the pressure
is raised to 45 to 75 pounds per square inch.

The sulphurie acid is then neutralized with marble-dust, and the sul-
phate of calcium removed by filtering through bags of cotton cloth or
filter-presses. The liquor is next passed through bone-black filters,
concentrated in vacuum-pans, and further purified. The liquid and
solid varieties receive different treatment in the final stage.

Both glucose and grape-sugar find extensive application for a great
variety of purposes as substitutes for cane-sugar or for barley. The
most general purposes for which starch-sugar is used are (1) for the
manufacture of table sirup; (2) as a substitute for barley-malt in brew-
ing ale or beer; (3) as a substitute for cane-sugar in confectionery; (4)
for the adulteration of cane-sugar, to which it is added to the extent of
20 per cent. or more; (5) for the manufacture of artificial honey; (6) in
the manufacture of vinegar; (7) in the manufacture of liquor-coloring,
and in many minor applications, such as in cooking, in preparation of
CHEMISTRY. 517

chewing-tobacco, in the manufacture of printers’ rollers, and of some
kinds of ink.

The following table shows the composition of fair samples of the
solid product :

The liquid products contain from 54.5 to 42.8 per cent. of dextrose
and 29.8 to 45.3 per cent. of dextrine.

The inorganic constituents consist of ash, sulphuric acid, chlorine,
ferric oxide, lime, magnesia, and alkalies. No traces of tin, copper, or
other metallic impurities were found. The total ash was only between
0.325 to 1.060 per cent.

The question as to the effects of glucose on the health was carefully
investigated by Dr. J. R. Duggan, of the Johns Hopkins University.
QWarlier experiments, chiefly in Germany, wereunfavorable to the use of
glucose made from potato-starch. Dr. Duggan’s experiments occupied
two months, during which time he repeatedly took large quantities of
concentrated extracts from fermentation (in doses from 120 grams to 160
grams), without the slightest observable effect.

In conclusion the committee thus summarize the results of their in-
vestigations: (1) The manufacture of sugar from starch is a long-estab-
lished industry, scientifically valuable, and commercially important ;
(2) the processes which it employs at the present time are unobjection-
able in their character and leave the product uncontaminated ; (3) the
starch-sugar thus made and sent. into commerce is of exceptionable
purity and uniformity of composition, and contains no injurious sub-
stances; (4) although starch-sugar has only about two-thirds the
sweetening power of cane sugar, yet Starch-sugar is in no way inferior
to cane-sugar in healthfulness.

Appendixes to the report give lists of the starch-sugar factories of
the United States, the results of examination of commercial sugars with
reference to their adulteration with starch-sugar, and a very full bibli-
ography of starch-sugar, prepared by the late Dr. E. J. Hallock. A list
of patents relating to the manufacture of starch and starch-sugar com-
pletes this valuable report. (Report on Glucose, prepared by the National

Gallisin, an unfermentable Substance in Starch- Sugar, by C. Schmitt and
A, Cobenz].—‘‘ ith a view to ascertaining whether popular estimation of
starch-sugar as an exceedingly unwholesome dietetic articleis correct, the
authors made a careful investigation into the more obscure ingredients
contained therein, and especially of the unfermentablesubstances. They
succeeded in isolating a definite body, which they name gallisin. The
process for its extraction and purification isa follows: Five kilograms of
commercial starch-sugar were allowed to ferment in a 20 per cent. solu-
tion, ata temperature of 28° to 20°C. After five or six days the fermeu-
tation was completed. After filtering, the nearly colorless liquid was
concentrated as much as possible on a water bath, and the still warm
sirup introduced into a large flask. The sirup was thep shaken with
a large excess of absolute alcohol, when it became viscous, but did not
mix with the aleohol. The latter was decanted and the sirup re-
peatedly agitated with fresh quantites of alcohol, which finally left behind
a pulverulent yellow-gray mass. This was then vigorously rubbed in a
large mortar witha mixture of alcohol and ether in equal parts, where-
by the whole mass was changed into a gray powder. These operations
must be conducted as rapidly «s possible, to prevent absorption of moist-
ure and deliquescence of the mass. The resulting material is dried
under a strong vacuum-pump, washed with alcohol and ether, and dried
under a bell jar, over concentrated sulphuric acid; calcium chloride will
not suffice, for the body is more hygroscopic than the calcium chloride
jtself. This material is further purified by dissolving in water, boiling
with animal charcoal, and evaporation to a sirup, which is then poured
in a thin stream into a mixture of anhydrous alcohol and ether.

Gallisin so prepared forms a fine white powder, which under the
mInicroscope proves to be completely amorphous. As stated, it is far
more hygroscopic than calcium chloride. Treated with dilute mineral
acids or with oxalic acid it yields dextrose. It does not ferment with
fresh yeast. It is slightly sweet to the taste. Analyses lead to the
formula Cy,,H.,O;. Treated in an aqueous solution with an alcohol so-
lution cf barium hydroxide, it yieids a flocculent precipitate of gallisin-
barium, C,.H.BaO,, . 3 H,O. Heated to 130° to 1469, under pressure,
with three times its weight of acetic anhydride, it dissolved, and subse-
quent treatment yielded a product which appeared to be hexacetylgallisin.
The presence of gallisin in doctored wine was directly proved; at the
same time by experiments on lower animals and on human beings it
was found to be quite innocuous. (Berichte d. chem. Ges., XV11, 1000.)

Sulphon-Phthaleins, by Ira Remsen.—The analogy in constitution be-
tween phthalic and orthosulphobenzoie acids suggested to the author
that sulpho compounds analogous to the phthaleins might be obtained
by the action of the latter acid upon phenols. Prelimivary experiments
confirm these views, and the author proposes to make an exhaustive
study of the new class of bodies. (Am. Chem. Journ., V1, 180.)

A new Synthesis of Saligenin, by William H. Greene.—Since by the re-
action of chloroform or of carbon tetrachloride on an alkaline solution
of sodium phenate, salicylic aldehyde may be obtained, the author ex-
pected to synthesize saligenin, an oxybenzylic alcohol, by the action of
methylen clioride on the sodium phenate. Experiments confirmed his
views, though the yield of saligenin was small. (Chem. News, L, 76.)

Action of Metals on Chloral Hydrate, by S. Cotton.—An aqueous solu-
tionof chloral hydrate is decomposed by most metals, with formation of
a metallic chloride. The degree of decomposition depends upon the
temperature, the nature of the metal, and the state of fineness of the
metal used.

Zine decomposes chloral hydrate slowly at theeordinary temperatures,
but at 80° to 100° the action goes on rapidly, disengaging in one hour
125 ¢. c. of gas when operating with 600 grams of metal and 10 of chlo-
ral. This gas is a mixture of hydrogen with formene and traces of
chlorine products. At the same time chloride and oxychloride of zine
are formed, the latter covering the metal and stopping the action. The
operation is impeded rather than quickened by amalgamating the zine.
If zine dust be used, the reaction begins vigorously at the ordinary tem-
perature. Iron acts very differently unless finely divided, in which case
it gives the same results as the zine. (Bull. soc. chim., XLU, 622.)

New Forms of Albumose.—Prots. W. Kiihne and KR. H. Chittenden in
a previous paper described hemialbumose, a cleavage product of the
albumins. In studying its reactions the authors noted differences of
solubility and inconstancy in the reactions with sodium chloride, circum.
stances which have led them to the separation of four different forms
of aibumose, viz: I, protalbumose; II, deuteroalbumose ; II, hetero-
albumose ; and, [V, dysalbumose. These bodies were obtained in part
by digestion of fibrin with pepsin-hydrochlorie acid, or from the com-
mercial ** pepton ” manufactured by Witte, and in part from preserved
hemialbumose from the urine of a patient with osteomalachia. For de-
tails of preparation and properties we refer to the original articles.

Trvestigations on Sinapine and Sinapie Acid, by Ira Remsen and kh. D.
Coale.—In 1825 Henry and Garot discovered a new substance in white
mustard seed to which they gave the name sulphosinapic acid. In
1852 von Babo and Hirschbrunn published an elaborate investigation of
this substance, since which practically nothing has been added to our
knowledgeof thesubject. Professors Remsen and Coale have undertaken
a new investigation of sinapine and its decomposition products. From
100 pounds of unground white mustard seed they obtained 80 grams
pure sulphocyanate of sinapine, which crystallizes from water in beauti-
ful feathery masses. It melts at 176°. The sinapic acid is best pre-
pared from this product by treating it with barium hydroxide. This

acid crystallizes from hot aleohol in small, transparent prisms of a
yellowish hue. Carefully purified material was repeatedly analyzed,
and the authors camé to the conclusion that the composition is repre-
sented by the empirical formula C,,H,,.0;. Further researches showed
the acid to be monobasic and led to the conclusion that it is butylene-
gallic acid, as shown in the formula—

Conversion of Organic Isocyanates into Mustard Oils, by Arthur Michael
and George M. Palmer.—The action of phenylisocyanate on phosphorus
pentasulphide yielded a liquid, boiling between 222° and 223°, having
all the properties of phenyl mustard oil. The yield is almost theoretical.
The same oil was also obtained by the action of the sulphide on phenyl-
urethane. The authors believe the process is capable of generalization,
and that the oils may be advantageously prepared. Ethyl mustard oil
was obtained by an analogous process. SuJphur estimations made in
the products gave results close to the theoretical amounts, and their
behavior with aniline further established their identity. (Am. Chem.
Journ., VI, 257.)

On Fluobenzene and Fluotoluene, by Paterno and Oliveri.—Schmitt
and Gehren described fluobenzene as a solid body, melting at 40° and
boiling at 180° to 183°. Knowing that the chlorides, bromides, and io-
dides of benzene are liquid and. boil at 132°, 155°, and 185°, respectively,
the authors questioned the accuracy of the experiments of the German
chemists, and repeated them. They found to their surprise that the
fluobenzene of Schmitt and Gehren is nothing but phenol.

Paterno and Oliveri succeeded in obtaining a true fluobenzene by
heating in a sealed tube fluobenzene-sulphonic acid, derived from
paradiazophenylsulphurous acid and concentrated hydrofluoric acid.
Fluobenzene forms a limpid liquid, with the odor of benzene, boiling at
85° to 86°, and not solidifying at 20°. The analogous fluotoluene ob-
tained by the authors boils at 114° and has a characteristic odor of
bitter-almond oil. (G@azz. chim. italiana, X11, 533.)

Occurrence of Phenol in Pinus sylvestris.—Dr. A.B. Griffiths announces
the discovery of phenol existing in a free state in the stem, acicular
leaves, and cones of Pinus sylvestris. The phenol was simply extracted
by heating with water to 80° C., stirring, and filtering. The filtrate
yielded six-sided prisms of phenol hydrate, which were carefully identi.
fied. The quantity varies with the age of the stem, the older portions
yielding 0.1021 per cent. and the younger portions only 0.0654 per cent.
The leaves yielded from 0.0936 to 0.0515 per cent. and the cones from
0.0774 to 0.0293 per cent., according to their maturity.

~ Synthesis of Piperidine, by A. Ladenburg and C. F. Roth.—By the
action of sodium in alcoholic solution on pyridine the authors obtained
a base having all the properties of piperidine. Piperidine was first
obtained by Wertheim and Rochieder from the piperine discovered by
Oersted (1819) in long and black pepper. Its formula is C;H,). HN.
Pyridine (C;H;N) was discovered by Anderson in bone-oil, and after-
wards established as a constituent of coal naphtha. The indentity of
the artificial product with that of pepper was fully established. (Ber-
ichte d. chem. Ges., XVII, 514.)

Fluid Hydrocarbons obtained by Compression of Petroleum Gas, by Gre-
ville Williams.—W hen the gaseous hydrocarbons obtained by subjecting
petroleum to a high temperature are compressed into cylinders (for the
purpose of lighting railway cars), a volatile fluid is condensed contain-
ing benzene, toluene, and certain olefines. Seven specimens of the liquid
gave percentages of benzene and toluene from 65.6 to 24.6. (Chem. News,
xHIX, 197.)

Anthracene in the Tar of Water-Gas.—Dr. Arthur H. Elliott has estab-
lished the presence of anthracene in the tar of water-gas. That so
heavy a hydrocarbon should result from the destructive distillation of
light petroleum naphthais interesting and instructive. Details will be
found in Am. Chem., Journ. V1, 248.

Absorption Spectra of the Alkaloids, by Prof. W. N. Hartley.—Experi-
ments have been made to ascertain whether absolute physical measure-
ments can be substituted for the uncertain chemical reactions and vari-
able physiological tests employed to detect alkaloids in medicolegal
522 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

examinations. About forty alkaloids of authentic origin and great
purity have been examined; these may be divided into two groups, as
follows:

(1) Alkaloids and derivatives exhibiting Absorption-bands in their Spec-
tra.—Aconitine, pseudoaconitine, japaconitine, morphine, narcotine,
codeine, thebaine, papaverine, oxynarcotine, apomorphine hydrochlo-
ride, cotarnine hydrobromide, tetracetyl morphine, diacetyl codeine,
quinine, quinine sulphate, cinchonine sulphate, quinidine sulphate,
cinchonidine sulphate, veratrine, piperine, brucine, strychnine.

(2) Alkaloids yielding continuous Spectra.—Narceine, aconitine (foreign \s
cevadine, atropine, solanine, hyoscyamine, digitaline, picrotoxine, nico
tine, caffeine.

Solutions were carefully made of the same strength in most cases,
usually in alcohol. Cells, with quartz sides, varied in thickness from
1™" to 20"".. By using electrodes consisting of alloys of tin and cad-
mium or of lead and cadmium (20 per cent.), well-defined spectra are ob-
tained, with lines of the same ‘intensity, aumerous and evenly distrib-
uted throughout a spectrum extending from wave length 4414.5 to 2145.8.
The spectra were photographed and the photographic impressions were
measured by an ivory scale divided in hundredths of an inch. The ab-
sorption curves cannot be here reproduced. The conclusions drawn from
the investigation are in part as follows: The absorption spectra offer a
ready and valuable means of ascertaining the purity of preparations of
the alkaloids, and practically of establishing their identity. The quan-
tity of some of the alkaloids present in a solution may be estimated by
means of the absorption curves. The different character of the various
aconitines, so called, may be recognized ; thus, the comparatively harm-
less base may be distinguished from those of great physiological ac-
tivity by its transmission of a continuous spectrum, while the three
specimens of physiologically active aconitines are distinguished from one
another by characteristic absorption curves. The purity of quinine and
absence of any admixture of cinchonine can be readily determined ;

drugs of such potency as aconitine, morphine, strychnine, &e., which

ought to be preseribed only when of absolute purity, should have their
exact nature and degree of purity guaranteed by an examination of
their absorption spectra. (Chem. News, L, 287.)

Cocaine Hydrochloride, a new Anesthetie.—The wonderful anesthetic
properties of this substance, discovered by Dr. Koller, of Vienna, have
given it an interest entirely new.

The leaves of Hrythroxylon coca, a plant cultivated in the mountain-
ous districts of Peru and Bolivia, have been extensively used by the
natives asa substitute for tobacco, their practice being to chew the
leaves to secure power of enduring fatigue even with a scanty supply of
food. The plant, especially the leaves, contains an alkaloid which was
tirst extracted iu 1853 by Gardeke and named by him erythroxyline ;

ital
CHEMISTRY. 523

but Albert Niemann, of Goslar, subsequently made a more thorough
study of the leaves and extracted the alkaloid, which he called cocaine.
Niemann’s process was as follows:

The leaves were exhausted with alcohol (85 per cent.), to which was
added 2 per cent. of sulphuric acid, and to the resulting tincture milk
of lime in sufficient quantity. The mixture was filtered, the filtrate
neutralized with sulphuric acid, and the alcohol distilled off. The resin
was separated from the sirupy residue by treating with water, and so-
dium carbonate then added. The deposited matter was then exhausted
by ether, and the ethereal solution, after most of the ether had been
distilled, was allowed to evaporate. The crystals were obtained mixed
with a dark-yellowish matter having a disagreeable odor from which,
however, they can be separated by washing with cold dilute alcohol.

Purified by recrystallization, cocaine forms colorless transparent
prisms, inodorous, of a bitterish taste, soluble in 704 parts of cold water,
more soluble in alcohol, and freely so in ether. The solution has an
alkaline reaction and a bitterish taste, leaving a peculiar numbness on
the tongue, followed by a sensation of cold. The alkaloid melts at
97°.7 C. (208° F.), and on cooling congeals into a transparent mass, which
gradually becomes crystalline. Heated above this point it changes
color and is decomposed. It is inflammable, boiling with a bright flame |
and leaving charcoal. With acids it forms crystallizable salts, which
are more bitter than the alkaloid itself. The composition of this al-
kaloid, as determined by Losson, is ©);H,NO,.

Its combination with hydrochloric acid, commonly called the hydro-
chlorate, crystallizes in white, slender needles, easily soluble in water.
As stated in Watts’ Dictionary of Chemistry, Vol. I, p. 1060 (1866), ‘it
has a bitter taste and produces on the tongue temporary insensibility.”
This interesting observation, after eighteen years, has borne abundant
fruit. Dr. Koller, of Vienna, again noticed its power of benumbing sen-
sation during the course of some experiments on lower animals ; a5 per
cent. solution of the hydrochloride of cocaine dropped into the animal’s
eye entirely deprived the eye of sensation. Koller at once proceeded to
" experiment on himself and in the hospital, with astonishing results. He
communicated his discovery to the International Ophthalmological Con-
gress held at Heidelberg in September, and his results were speedily
confirmed by a host of experimenters.

Its chief use isin connection with operations on theeye. A few drops
of a4 per cent. solution are introduced into the eye, and if necessary
yepbated after a minute or two, until the organ loses entirely its sen-
sitiveness. The loss of sensation begins in three to five minutes and
continues from fifteen minutes to half an hour, the effect being super-
ficial. The insensibility is not absolute. The patient feels the opera-
tion as he would feel anything laid on his hand or arm, but the sense
of pain is almost wholly destroyed. Usually there is a slight feeling,
which is said by the patient to »e not worth mentioning.
524 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

It is unnecessary to repeat that the effect is confined to the part to
which the anesthetic has been applied. There is no general anesthesia
and no influence on the mind. The patient is left free to aid the opera-
tion by turning the eye in any required direction, holding down the
lid, or in any such way, and can give this help almost as indifferently
as a third person, and often more successfully. The absence of the
tendency to close the eye, which accompanies general anesthesia, is a
great advantage.

Before the close of the year an immense demand arose for the new
drug, and, owing to its rarity and the small supply on hand, its price
rose to $225 per ounce, or, according to another report, $7,000 per
pound. The leaf yields less than one-fifth of 1 per cent. cocaine.
Fortunately only a 4 per cent. solution is used, and only a few drops
of this are needed to produce the effect desired.

The new anesthetic proves to be a great boon to ophthalmologists,
and experiments are being made to extend its use to other departments
of medical and surgical practice. Dentists, in particular, hope to find
in it a remedial agent of value. Hypodermic injections of the 4 per
cent. solution ansthize the nervous centers. It has been used to
narcotize the throat and larynx when covered with ulcers, to remove
violent headaches, &c. It can well be classed among the great dis-
coveries of the decade.

The question naturally occurs to a chemist, compiling this brief notice
from various sources, how many more obscure substances await useful
applications? Who dare say hereafter that the newly born chemical
infant of polysyllabic name may not become a giant in strength and a
blessing to Christendom ?

NOTES.

Idunium is the name of a new element discovered in lead vanadate
from La Plata by Prof. Martin Websky. It resembles vanadium in its -
reactions. (Sttzungsb. Ak. Wiss., Berlin, xxx, 661.)

According to L. Ricciardi, the lavas and ashes of volcanic origin con-
tain 0.0034 to 0.013 per cent. of vanadium, and even the plants growing
in the lava of Etna contain appreciable quantities of this widely dis-
tributed yet rare element. (Gazz. chim. italiana, X11, 259.)

Red and yellow litharge are two varieties obtained according to tem-
perature and treatment of the material. Geuther has studied their
formation, and regards the yellow as Pb;O3, and the red variety as its
isomer, Pb,O;. The yellow variety is orthorhombic and the red tetrag-
onal in crystallization. Friction converts the former into the latter.
(Liebig’s Ann. d. Chemie, CCOXIx, 56.)

The alleged transformation of brucine into strychnine by the action
of hot dilute nitric acid, announced by Sonnenschein in 1875, is denied
by Hanriot, who believes the strychnine pre-existed in the imperfectly
purified brucine, Hanriot also finds that brucine masks the presence of
CHEMISTRY. 25

strychnine, even when he latter is present in comparatively large quan-
tity. (Comptes rendus, XOVI1, 267.)

A redetermination of the vapor density of ferrous chloride leads Vic-
tor Meyer to the conclusion that it consists at lower temperatures of
molecules of the formula Fe,Cl,, and as the temperature rises these
break up into molecules represented by the formula FeCl,. In the ex-
periments made the temperature reached was not sufficiently high to
entirely produce the latter molecular condition. (Berichte d. chem. Ges.,
XVII, 1335.) i

Ammoniacal chloride of silver and the corresponding iodide have
been obtained by M. Terreil in crystals. The ammoniacal salts were
heated witha saturated solution of ammonia, in a sealed tube, to 100°
C., and the silver salt dissolved, when heated, and erystallized out in
needles on cooling the tube. Exposed to the air the crystals lose am-
monia rapidly. (Bull. soc. chim., XLI, 597.)

The composition of bleaching powder has been again investigated by
Edmond Dreyfus. He comes tothe conclusion that the active principle
in the powder is CaHClO,, and that the correct formula for the mixture
is 2 CaHClO, + CaCl, + 2 H,0. It will be seen he disregards the eal-
cium hydroxide, commonly included in the formule prevailing. (Bull.
soc. chim., XLI, 600.)

Investigations made by O. Fisher and G. Thoémer on the structure of
chrysaniline lead them to believe that it is a diamidophenylacridine,
as they were enabled to obtain not only phenylacridine from chrysani-
line, but also to produce the latter in a new way, synthetically. The
material used in these experiments was Oehler’s phosphine, which, after
being purified, crystallizes in long, golden-yellow needles.

According to a report on the sugar beet industry by M. Pellet, there
are in France 527 manufactories, of which 482 were in operation in
1883-84. They produced 425,000,000 kilos of sugar, extracted from
6,500,000,000 kilos of sugar-beets. (Bull. soc. chim., XLI, 342.)

Palmitic acid and the palmitins have been.studied anew by Dr. R.
H. Chittenden and Herbert E. Smith. The numerous variations in the
melting points of the individual fats described lead the authors to be-
lieve in the existence of various physical modifications. (Am. Chem.
Journ., VI.)

Prof. Albert R. Leeds published a second memoir on the literature
of ozone and peroxide of hydrogen, in which he gives a summary of
the discoveries since 1878. (Chem. News, L, 215.)

Liquid carbon dioxide is now a commercial article, being manufact-
ured by the Aktiengesellschaft fiir Kohlenséure Industrie, in Berlin, and
sold in iron flasks containing 8 kilos of the liquid. Professor Landolt
finds the liquid as sold very convenient for the preparation of solid car-
bon dioxide, and describes experiments with the same. (Berichte d. chem.
Ges., XVII, 309.)

Urea had been obtained by E. Drechsel by electrolyzing with alter-
526 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

nating currents a solution of carbamate of ammonium. The electrolysis
of phenol gives rise to y-diphenol, brenzeatechin, hydrochinon, formic
acid, normal valerianic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, malonic acid, and
other bodies not yet examined. (Journ. prakt. Chemie, XX1x, 229.)

Prof. Harvey W. Wiley, chemist to the Bureau of Agriculture, has
devised optical methods of determining lactose in milks, which give ex-
cellent results. Details will be found in Am. Chem. Journ., V1, 289.

Antonio Longi recommends paratoluidin sulphate as a delicate test
for nitric acid; the latter gives rise to a red color, slowly changing to
yellow. If chlorates, chromates, &c., are present, an intense blue color
resultS; zs5¢o9 part of nitric acid can be recognized. Diphenylamin
sulphate, which yields an intense blue color, is even more sensitive,
surpassing brucine in this respect.

Prof. C. L. Bloxam reports a boiler incrustation containing 0.73 per
cent. of strontia. The water used in the boiler was from a deep well in
the chalk at Harrow, England. Owing to an increasing demand for
strontia, the author suggests chemists should be on the lookout for it.
(Chem. News, XL1x, 3.)

In both Germany and France attention is called by chemists to a
fraudulent tartar emetic found in the market, in which oxalic acid takes
the place of tartaric. The true emetic contains 43.70 per cent. of oxide
of antimony, while the false emetic contains only 23.67 per cent., and
dyers are defrauded in proportion. (Bull. soc. chim., XLI, 105.)

A detailed and interesting description of the manufacture of vermil-
ion in China will be found in Chem. News, L, 77.

The International Congress of Metric Weights and Measures has
adopted the following abbreviations, which are recommended for gen-
eral use:

1. Measures of length: Kilometer, km; meter, m; decimeter, dm;
centimeter, cm; millimeter, mm. ;

2. Surface measures: Square kilometer, km?; square meter, m?;
square decimeter, dm’; square centimeter, cem?; square millimeter, mm? ;
hectare, ha; are, a. :

entire or decimal. ;

At the meeting of the chemical section of the Association of German
Naturalists and Physicians held in September at Magdeburg, Dr. Frank,
CHEMISTRY. OT

of Charlottenburg, read a paper on the technical development of the
alkali industry iv Stassfurt, and stated that in July, 1882, 20,000,000
ewts. of carnallite were Connie in the preparation of chloride of po-
tassium.

The sessions of the chemical section of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science at Philadelphia in September were more
largely attended than at any time during the last eight years. Several
eminent chemists from Great Britain were present. A new feature was
the discussion of topics previously announced in a circular issued by
the chairman. The section was presided over by Prof. J. W. Langley,
of Ann Arbor, who made an address on chemical affinity, of great in-
terest and value.

At the Philadelphia meeting of the American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science, Prof. W. O. Atwater read a paper on the chem-
istry of fish. This embraced the results of an investigation into the
economic and nutritive, value of ‘fish, and a study of the chemical con-
stitution of the flesh of fishes and invertebrates. The flounder was
found to be the least nutritive of fishes, while the salmon, when fat, was
the most nutritive. Among the invertebrates the crab is the most nu-
tritious, while the oyster is least. Speaking of oysters, the author said
that those from Northern waters were more nutritious than those from
the South; and the amount of nutriment in the oyster was about the
same as that in milk. Digestive ferments (as pepsin, &c.) act upon the
flesh of fish in the same manner as upon that of vertebrates, about 98
per cent. of the albuminoids being digested in both cases.

Prof. F. W. Clarke, chief chemist to the United States Geological
Survey, has issued a report of work done in the Washington Labora-
tory during the fiscal year 1883- 84. The report gives results of the
analyses of twenty-two rocks, minerals, and ores, and of twenty-three
water analyses. The latter include waters from Montana, the Utah
Hot Springs, and the Virginia Hot Springs. The water of Mono Lake,
California, contains 51.85 grams to the liter total solids; that of the
larger Soda Lake, near Ragtown, Ney., contains no less than 125.13
grams to the liter, the solids consisting chiefly of sodium carbonate,
chloride, and sulphate. Lake Tahoe, California, sustains its reputation
for purity, the water containing only 0.073 gram total solids per liter.

According to the annual report for 1884 of the Russian Chemical and
Physical Society, situated in St. Petersburg, the chemical section had
162 members, its income, including several grants, reached 5,734 rubles
(about $2,750), ond its capital amounted to 13,932 rubles.

At the regular meeting of the Société chimique de Paris held May 23,
1884, it was voted, 30 to 12, to adopt a resolution looking to a change in
the name of the society by substituting ‘“‘France” for “Paris” in its
title. A committee was appointed to carry the change into effect in a
legal manner. The society numbers 468 members, and had an income
in 1883 of 20,000 franes.
528 SCIENTIFIC~ RECORD - FOR - 1884.

The Deutsche chemische Gesellschaft continues to prosper. At the
close of the year 1884 it had 2,901 members (including 13 honorary
members), having gained 170 members during the year. In 1883 the
society received 535 original communications, and in 1884, 646; in 1883
it published 3,101 pages in its Beriehte, and in 18384 3,065 pages, exclu-
sive of abstracts, a necrology, and an index, which have an independent
pagination. It received from all sources during the year 57,307 marks,
and expended about 4,000 marks less. It holds productive property
valued at 68,000 marks.

At the anniversary meeting of the Chemical Society (of London) held
March 31, 1884, the president called attention to the fact that notwith-
standing the increased number of laboratories in Great Britain, and
greater facilities for the prosecution of research through the aid of the
Government grant and the Chemical Society’s fund, the number of
papers read before the society is declining year by year.

Prof. W. N. Hartley, in Nature, considers somewhat at length the
circumstances which have brought about this ‘‘startling and anomalous

fact.” In 1880~81 the Chemical Society (of London) received from its_

members 113 communications; in 188182, 57; in 188334, 67. It is true
there are seven other societies which publish chemical papers, besides
two in Ireland. The Society of Chemical Industry received in the see-
ond year of its existence (1883-84) 68 papers. It is evident that the
number of communications to the Chemical Society has declined in pro-
portion as those to the younger Society of Chemical Industry increased.
Papers on industrial chemistry abound, those on pure research are rel-
atively few, and in this respect a great coutrast is offered to the work
of the German Chemical Society, which publishes 3,000 pages annually
of exclusively pure researches.

Professor Hartley is not willing to admit that the decline of interest in
original researches is the fault of the teachers in England, though he
regrets that m-ny professors are obliged to teach several branches of
science. He recognizes the influence of the requirements for the de-
gree of doctor of philosophy in German universities upon originality of
thought, but thinks this alone insufficient to account for the difference.
‘“‘It is rather that which is not required which is so advantageous to
students; it is the Lehre und Leben Freiheit which professors and pupils
both enjoy.” On the Continent the motive for scientific education is
mental culture, while in Britain it is utilitarianism; while the former
tends to the advancement of learning, the latter involves nothing further
than the diffusion of knowledge.

Does not the above criticism of English culture apply to a large ex-
tent to the system of education in America?

Co-operative Indexing in Chemistry.—At the Montreal meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science a committee was
appointed to devise and inaugurate a plan for the proper indexing of
the literature of the chemical elements. This committee reported in
CHEMISTRY. 529

August, 1882, that they had considered three methods of collecting mi-
terial for the indexes, viz:

1. Reviewing the Catalogue of Scientific Papers published by the
Royal Society (8 vols., 4to).

_ 2. Indexing special journals by different individuals and collating
the matter.

3. The independent plan, whereby each chemist indexes all the jour-
nals available to him with reference to a given element in which he is
presumably especially interested.

Each of these schemes is open to objections, which need not be named.
On the whole, the third plan seemed to a majority of the committee the
only feasible one for the present.

The report considers also the best arrangement of material, and three
ways are suggested: (1) Chronologically; (2) alphabetically by authors;
(3) topically.

The committee do not venture to dictate to volunteers and independ-
ent workers, but recommend the chronological arrangement, accom-
panied by a topical index.

In September, 1884, the committee reported that several indexes had
been published during the twelve months intervening, and that more
were in progress. They also announced that the Smithsonian Institu-
tion has consented to publish the indexes to chemical literature in-
dorsed by the committee, limiting somewhat the number of pages per
annum. The Smithsonian Institution also distributes free of expense
the circulars of the committee.

The indexes already published include the following: Uranium, by
H. Carrington Bolton, 15 pp.; Manganese (1596-1874), by H. Carrington
Bolton, 44 pp.; Titanium, by Edward J. Hallock, 22 pp.; Vanadium,
by G. Jewett Rockwell, 13 pp.; Ozone, by Albert R. Leeds, 32 pp.;
Peroxide of Hydrogen (1818~78), by Albert R. Lééds, 11 pp.; Elec-
trolysis, by W. Walter Webb, 40 pp.; Speed of Chemical Reactions, by
Robert B. Warder, 3 pp.; Starch-Sugar, by Edward J. Hallock, 44 pp.;
Ozone (187983), by Albert R. Leeds, 16 pp.; Peroxide of Hydrogen
(1879~83), by Albert R. Leeds, 3 pp.; Dictionary of the Action of Heat
upon Certain Metallic Salts, by J. W. Baird and A. B. Prescott, 70 pp.
8vo. New York.

The first two were published in the Annals of the New York Lyceum
of Natural History and all the rest in the Annals of the New York Acad-
emy of Sciences, except that on Starch-Sugar, which was published by
the United States Internal Revenue Department, Washington, D. C.;
and that on Speed of Chemical Reactions, which appeared in the Proceed-
ings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

A limited number of those published by the New York Academy of

MINERALOGY.

By EDWARD S. Dana,
Yale College, New Haven, Conn.

GENERAL WORKS ON MINERALOGY.

The additions to the list of mineralogical treatises have not been
numerous during the past year. Perhaps the most noteworthy is the
Text-Book of Descriptive Mineralogy, by Mr. Hilary Bauerman, of the
Royal School of Mines in London. It forms a companicen volume to the
Text-Book of Systematic Mineralogy, published three year ago, and
noticed in the report for 1882. The present volume is devoted to the
descriptions of species, which, though necessarily brief and not al-
ways as fully up to date as might be desired, are on the whole satisfae-
tory. It is interesting to note that the figures through the work are
for the most part printed from the original blocks used in the revised
edition of Phillips’s Mineralogy, prepared by Brooke and Miller in 1852,
a volume to which every working mineralogist now refers almost daily,
notwithstanding the fact that it was prepared so many years since. An
elementary text-book of mineralogy has been published in Germany by
Dr. H. Baumhauer, which deserves mention, though of modest propor-
tions. Dr. Weisbach has issued a new edition of his Synopsis Minera-
logica,* which gives a summary of mineral species, arranged according

-to their chemical composition, with notes as to their crystalline form

and some other points. Moreimportant than this last work is the open-
ing portion (first 80 pages) of the ninth volume of the Materialien zur
Mineralogie Russlands, by N. v. Kokscharow. The species treated at
length in this part are caledonite and wollastonite, but supplementary
notices are also given of monazite, rutile, pachnolite, and xanthophylite;
the whole work is a monument of careful and accurate labor.

A large volume (630 pages) has been published, under the editorship
of Dr. J. B. Marvin, of the Original Researches in Mineralogy and Chem-
istry of the late Dr. J. Lawrence Smith. Dr. Smith was for many years
one of the most active contributors to these sciences in the United States,

and it is well that these, his most important papers (numbering nearly
one hundred), should be put in permanent form. The volume con-
tains also biographical sketches by Dr. Marvin, Dr. Michel, and by the
late Professor Silliman.

Of the works devoted to special departments of mineralogy the
Traité de Cristallographie of Professor Mallard, of the Ecole des Mines
in Paris, must be mentioned first. The first volume of this most valu-
able work was issued in 1879, and the second has followed during the
past year. The two vclumes embrace upward of a thousand pages, and
an atlas with numerous plates accompanies them. It is the most ex-
haustive treatise upon erystallography and physical mineralogy which
has been published in many years, and covers some branches of the sub-
ject more fully than hasever been done before. Dr. Aristides Brezina,
of Vienna, has published the first part of a work entitled Avrystallo-
graphische Untersuchungen an homologen und isomeren Reihen, a memoir
which has received the Baumgartner prize from the Vienna Academy.
This part is devoted to a discussion of the methods of observation,
measurement of erystals, &e., and also the methods of calculation.
These topies are discussed with almost an excess of fullness of detail.
Dr. Eugen Hussak, of Graz, has issued a work entitled Anleitung zum
Bestimmen der gesteinbildenden Mineralien, which promises to be of value
to those who are especially interested in the application of mineralogy
to petrography. The excellent tables for the determination of minerals
prepared by von Kobell, and of which 11 editions were issued before
the death of the author, have been revised by K. Oebbeke, and a 12th
edition published, with the additions which the rapid development of the
science has made necessary.

The Eneyclopédie Chimique, published at Paris under the direction of
M. Frémy, contains two volumes which are gnteresting to the mineral-
ogist. The first of these is by L. Bourgéois, on the artificial production
of minerals. Thisis.a subjectto which French chemists have made impor-
tant contributions and upon which we already have an excellent French
work (1882) by MM. Fouqué and Lévy. This new volume is a valuable
contribution, giving with unusual fullness the methods employed in the
synthesis of minerals, with figures of the apparatus employed, and then
the special results obtained in the case of the different mineral species.
Another volume of this encyclopedia, by M. Meunier, is devoted to the
subject of meteorites. This is a large volume, profusely illustrated, and
covering the whole subject very thoroughly.

A second part has been published of the work, by Tschermak, men-
tioned in the last volume of this report, devoted to the illustration of the
microscopic structure of meteorites. This part contains eight plates
devoted to olivine, bronzite, augite,and plagioclase, Gc. They show most
satisfactorily the peculiar radiated structure which characterizes these
minerals when forming the spherical grains so common in the chon-
dritic variety of meteorites.

of the United States of Mr. A. Williams. A popular volume, entitled
Leisure Hours Among the Gems, has appeared from the pen of Mr. A.
C. Hamlin. Dr. Fletcher’s Guide to the Mineral Gallery of the British
Museum, with an introduction to the study of minerals, is a work of
some interest even to those who are not so fortunate as to have the op-
portunity to study the beautiful collection of minerals at South Ken-
sington.

CRYSTALLOGRAPHY AND PHYSICAL MINERALOGY.

Many contributions have been made to our knowledge of the crystal-
line form of different mineral species, and numerous additions have been
made to the already long lists of known planes. Only a few memoirs
of more than ordinary scope and interest will be mentioned. Two ex-
tended articles on this branch of miveralogy have been published by
H. A. Miers, of the British Museum. One of these (Min. Mag., v, 325)
is devoted to the description of crystals of meneghinite trom Bottino,
near Serravezza, in Tuscany. The same subject was a little earlier dis-
cussed by Krenner, in the Proceedings of the Hungarian Geological
Society. The results of the two investigations agree closely, they prove
that the species is to be referred to the orthorhombic system; not mon-
oclinic, aS has been hitherto assumed. The crystals are highly complex
in form. <A second paper by Miers is a monograph of the species
bournonite (Zb., V1, p. 58), in which the author reviews the work of earlier
erystallographers, from the time of Bournon (1804) down. To the list
of 50 forms already identified, Miers adds twenty-nine new ones, deter-
mined beyond doubt, and twenty-one others, which are of rare occur-
rence and need confirmation. Miers accepts the elements of Miller
(1852), and from these calculates a list of upwards of one thousand an-
gles, being the angles between the normals of all the known planes and
the most important planes of reference. The memoir is accompanied by
two plates, with numerous figures, and a spherical projection.

Another monograph is by W. J. Lewis, of Cambridge, on miargyrite
(Zeitsch. Kryst., VIII, 545), which adds much to our knowledge of the com-
plex crystals of that rare species, and removes some doubtful points
about them. The paper contains a large number of figures and a long
list of measured angles compared with the angles calculated from the
accepted elements. A paper by Max Schuster (Min. Petr. Mitth., v1,
301), on the structure and character of the crystalline surfaces of the
Swiss danburite, certainly leaves nothing unsaid on that subject. It
covers upwards of two hundred pages, and is the second part of a
memoir, the first of which was published a year ago. The detailed
description of the vicinal prominences on the planes, and all the other
peculiarities, especially in their influence upon the inter-facial angles
measured with the reflecting gonimeter, is not without interest, but the

subject would seem to be a little overdone when two hundred and
seventy-five pages are given to its discussion. Schuster, after a very
careful comparison of the angles measured by him on the Swiss crystals,
confirms the conclusion of Hintze that they have almost identically the
same axial relations as the crystals from Russell, N. Y. Of other
papers devoted to a similar class of subjects may be mentioned one by
P. W. von Jeremejew on Russian linarite (abstract in Zeitsch. Kryst.,
1x, 430) ; another by C. Morton on the stephanite of Kongsberg, Nor-
way (Aifversigt K. Vet. Akad. Forh., February 13, 1884), on the am-
phibole of the Aranyer Berg by Franzenau (Zeitsch. Kryst., VIII, 568),
on epistilbite by Hintze (ib., p. 605), on andalusiteand topaz by Griinhut
(Ib., 1X., 113). Solly has described (Min. Mag., V1., 80) a crystal of
tourmaline from Pierrepont, N. Y., which showed a tetartohedral devel-
opment of the scalenohedral planes; the matter needs confirmation.

Hj. Sjogren has settled (Gifv. K. Vet. Akad. Forh., April 9, 1884)
finally, it would seem, the disputed crystalline form of graphite, a species
which has generally been referred to the hexagonal system in accord-
ance with the early observations of Kenngott, but which was afterwards
made monoclinic by Nordenskjéld. Finding the direct determination of
the form by accurate measurement impracticable, because of the imper-
fection of the crystals, he attacked the problem indirectly. He shows
that the etching figures and the figures produced by partial combustion,
also the isothermal curves, all agree with the hexagonal system.

The subject of the double refraction of minerals, isometric in geomet-
rical form, has received some important contributions during the past
year, and we now seem to be approaching to a full understanding of
the true relations. A few years ago it appeared as if the only species
of those formerly included in the isometric system, which were likely to
be allowed to remain there, were those which from their opacity (like
galena) did not allow of an optical examination, so general a phenome-
non had this anomalous double refraction been shown to be. The new
light recently thrown upon the subject has come from the observation
of Mallard, that boracite loses all its double refraction and becomes
isotropic at a temperature of 265° C. To appreciate the significance
of this it is necessary to recall the fact that while the geometrical
form of boracite crystals is in strict accordance with the require.
ments of the isometric system, sections examined optically uniformly
show double refraction, the section being seen to be divided, when ex
amined in polarized light, into parts more or less regularly arranged,
with different optical orientation. Instead of assuming, then, that the
crystalline form is only a case of pseudo-symmetry, an imitative, or “ mi-
metic ” (to use Tschermak’s word) form due to the complex twining of
a number of orthorhombic crystals, we must conclude that the isomet:-
ri¢ form was the original one, and that the conditions under which
the ery stals were formed were similar to those we now obtain by an eleva.
tion of temperature to 265° C. Under these conditions of formation then

MINERALOGY. 547

the molecular structure was isotropic, and the geometric form and opti-
cal character were in harmony with each other: Under present condi-
tions, however, the molecular structure is anisotropic, double refraction
has arisen from secondary causes, while the geometric form remains un-
shanged—form and optical properties being then contradictory to each
other. This subject has been discussed by Klein (Jahrb. Min., 1884, 1,
235), and he describes the best methods of observation in order to show
this change from the isotropic to the anisotropic state and back again.
~Mack has discussed at length ( Wied. Ann., xx1, 410) the pyro-electricity
of boracite, and shows the close relation which exists between the elec-
trical and the optical phenomena.

It will be inferred from what has been said about boracite that a sim-
ilar explanation of the optical anomalies in other crystals may be ex-
pected to be found to hold true, although it is not to be supposed that
this is the only cause of the secondary double refraction shown by so
many minerals. Klein has extended his observations to a number of
other species, the most important of which is leucite. This species,
though long known to show more or less distinct double refraction, was
included in the isometric system until vom Rath (1873) showed that the
form could be interpreted as tetragonal; since then most mineralogists
have accepted vom Rath’s conclusion. It is now shown by Klein
(Nachrichten K. Ges. Wiss. Gottingen, May 3 and August 2, 1884) that at
an elevated temperature leucite also loses its double-refraction and be-
comes isotropic, and on cooling again becomes anisotropic, though the
structure was somewhat altered. From this observed fact, he naturally
concludes that at its formation the conditions were such that the min-
eral was isometric in form and its molecular structure correspondingly
isotropic.

The memoir by Klein on leucite is a model of careful, accurate work.
In his introduction he describes the special form of microscope employed,
which had been constructed according to his plan, and which was in
many respects an improvement upon earlier forms (as that of Bertrand)
made with the same object of allowing exact optical determinations.
The material under examination was ample, embracing crystals from
a variety of occurrences, and, of these, some 350 thin sections were
prepared. Without going too far into details, it is enough to state
the general conclusions, that in form and optical characters leucite cor-
responds to the orthorhombic system (as first urged on geometrical
grounds by Weisbach), but approximates closely to the tetragonal. The
structure is in general that of a complex twin, three fundamental indi-
viduals crossing each other, which may or may not be equally developed ;
in some cases, one of these may predominate over the others. These in-
dividuals are twinned parallel to the planes which on the old view
would have been called a dodecahedral plane. A good deal of: irregu-
larity is observed in the angles, both crystallographic and optical; it is
found, moreover, that the inclusions do not correspond in their distri-
548 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

bution to the optical limits of the individuals; from these and other sini-
lar facts, together with the most important point of all, that mentioned
above, that the crystals become isotropic at a high temperature, he
reaches the conclusion stated, that the orthorhombic form and anisotro-
pic optical characters are bath of secondary origin. This view seems all
the more probable in the case of leucite, since we know that it must
have been formed at very high temperatures, an assumption which is
not so natural for boracite, although we know here that artificial crys-
tals formed at a high temperature were originally isometric and isotropic,
though losing the optical simplicity at ordinary temperatures. Increase
of temperature is not the only change of conditions, however, which
may bring about a change of optical characters. It has recently been
shown by Mallard and Le Chatelier (Bull. Soc. Min. Nae 478), that hexa-
gonal silver iodide, which becomes isotropic at a fornpeeainike of 146° C.,
undergoes the same change at ordinary temperatures (20°C.) if sae
to a pressure of 2,500 kilograms per square centimeter. A mineral,
then, which has crystallized at a high temperature, or under a great
pressure, or both, may have taken a form which does not correspond to
its molecular structure under ordinary conditions of pressure and tem-
perature. This change may manifest itself in optical character alone
‘(as boracite) or in this and in geometrical form as well, as in leucite.

Some other contributions to the same subject deserve to be mentioned.
Merian has proved (Jahrb. Min., 1884, 1, 193) that crystals of tridymite,
which in optical character correspond, as shown by Lasaulx, to complex
triclinic twins, become normally uniaxial in accordance with their hex-
agonal form at an elevated temperature. Analcite underwent consid-
erable change in optical character when heated, although it did not be-
come completely isotropic. Merian did not succeed with léucite, but
Penfield (Jahrb. Min., 1884, 1, 224) confirms Klein’s results in this
respect, though he shows that elevation of temperature does not re-
move the optical anomalies of garnet.

Klein has also shown (Jahrb. Min., 1884, 11, 49) that aragonite, a
mineral which is optically biaxial and orthorhombic in form, though
often imitating hexagonal forms by twinning, becomes uniaxial upon
heating, the section changing into an aggregate of uniaxial particles
with negative double refraction. In other words, the molecular change
brought about in aragonite by elevation of temperature corresponds to
a change of aragonite to calcite. It may be remembered that G. Rose
showed a long time since that the powder into which heated aragonite
separated was probably calcite, as suggested by its lower specific grav-
ity. A similar optical change takes place, according to Miigge (Jahrb.
Min., 1884, 1, 63), in leadhillite (monoclinic) upon carefully raising its
temperature. These results recall the discussion of a similar subject by
Prof. J. P. Cooke, in his paper on the vermiculites (1873), and later in
that on haloid compounds of antimony (1877). Cooke shows that at a
moderate temperature (about 114° C.) the yellow orthorhombic antimony

ee ee

~ MINERALOGY. 549

iodide changes suddenly to the red hexagonal, and he argues that true
hexagonal structure may result from molecular twinning of orthorhombic
molecules. .

Other investigators have worked on the same subject, of the change
produced by elevation of temperature. Doelter (Jahrb. Min., 1884, 1,
217) has experimented upon vesuvianite, apatite, and tourmaline. W.
Klein, of Bonn, has published an extended paper (Zeitsch. Kryst., 1x,
38), in which he gives the. results of similar experiments with apatite,
quartz, apophyllite, zircon, iolite, heulandite, and other minerals.
Forstner (Ib., p. 333) gives the results of a very interesting series of
experiments upon the changes in optical characters brought about by
artificial change of physical conditions on the feldspars of Pantelleria.
These lead to essentially the same conclusions as the experiments of
Klein on boracite and leucite. Among other things Forstner says,
with respect to microcline-albite, that, considering the voleanic origin
of the feldspars, it is natural to conclude that at the time of its forma-
tion the conditions as to temperature, &c., were such as to cause a
monoclinic arrangement of the particles, and that the present (triclinic)
optical characters are the result of subsequent changes.

From a theoretical standpoint, perhaps the most interesting and sug-
gestive contribution to this subject is a paper by Mallard (Bull. Soe.
Min. France, Vu, pp. 349-401), in which he discusses the probable molec-
ular arrangements in the different types of crystals and the changes
which they undergo under changes of conditions, as of temperature, &c.
He calls attention to the cubie type, and the fact that the erystals of
other systems often approximate to it; and, moreover, that the erystal-
line parameters of a very large number of crystals are simple multiples
(1, 2,3) of the parameters of the cubic “réseau.” From this he concludes
that for all crystals, without exception, the réseau formed by the centers
of gravity of the molecules is the same, and very nearly that which char-
acterizes the cubic “réseau.” The relatively slight differences which
exist between this last and the one actually existing could constitute
with the special molecular twinning, and the molecular volume, the erys-
talline individuality peculiar to each substance. This molecular twin-
ning, which heat and other causes can alter, is regarded as giving rise to
the true crystalline molecules. Reference must be made to the original
paper for the full discussion of the subject.

Des Cloizeaux has continued his investigations of the optical charac-
ters of the feldspar species. A recent paper (Bull. Soc. Min., v1, 249)
is devoted to oligoclase and andesine, and covers nearly 100 pages,
giving a large number of determinations of the position of the axes of
elasticity, measurements of the axial angles, and so on. His observa-
tions go to show that, in the albite-anorthite series of plagioclase,
the species or subspecies andesine deserves a more definite place than
many mineralogists have of late years been inclined to give to it. It
may be added here that Gylling has recently described (Jahrb. Min.,
550 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

1884, 11, 19 ref.) good crystals of andesine from Orijirvi in Finland.
J. H. Kloos has contributed (Jahrb. Min., 1884, 11, 87) a series of optical
observations on orthoclase and microcline. He concludes that the two
species are thoroughly distinct, orthoclase being strictly monoclinic and
microcline triclinic, although the latter by very fine twinning may imi-
tate the monoclinic mineral. He does not support the view which has
been advanced that orthoclase is nothing but a mimetie microcline. The
observations of Férstner (see above) bear upon this subject.

Of researches bearing upon the cohesion in crystallized substances two
new papers by Miigge must be referred to (Jahrb. Min., 1884, 1, 50, 216).
Becke discusses at length the etching-figures on galena (Min. Petr.
Mitth., V1, 237). >

CHEMICAL MINERALOGY.

Of contributions to the general subject of chemical mineralogy several
papers by Rammelsberg deserve to be mentioned first. These are de-
voted to the discussion of some points bearing on the isomorphism of
minerals (Jahrb. Min., 1884, 11, 67); on the chemical relations of the
natural borates (Jb., p. 158). Blomstrand discusses (Geol. For. Forh.,
Stockholm, vit, 59) the composition of the native compounds of uranium.
Animportant paper by Doelterand Hussak (Jahrb. Min., 1884, 1,18) deals
with the action of a melted rock upon different minerals, with a view to
throwing light upon the contact phenomena observed in nature. Fine
pulverized rock, as basalt, andesite, or phonolite, was melted in a por-
celain crucible, and then the mineral to be experimented upon was in-
serted into the molten mass. The minerals chosen for the experiment
were pyroxene, hornblende, biotite, feldspar, olivine, quartz, garnet,
iolite, and zircon. The results of the experiments are not without in-
terest, though of too special a character to be detailed here; they do
not lead to any broad conclusions. Another paper (Ib., p. 158) by the
same authors describes the results of trials with different varieties of
garnet and vesuvianite, these minerals being fused and the products
resulting from the reerystallization of the melted material studied. For
example, melanite yielded in this way meionite, anorthite, and a variety
of olivine ; grossularite, from Wilui, gave meionite, a little anorthite, a
mineral like melilite and perhaps hematite, and soon. The original
mineral was not reproduced, and, moreover, the fusing together of ne-
phelite and augite, and also of meionité and olivine, failed to yield garnet.
Doelter has also made an interesting series of synthetic experiments
(1b. 1, p. 51, Zeitsch. Kryst., 1x, 321) on the pyroxenes and nephelite,
the results of which deserve to be studied in detail.

In the line of chemical studies of individual mineral species, Pen-
field’s paper on the composition of beryl (Amer. Jour. Sci., XXVIII, 25)
is perhaps the most interesting. The formula of beryl, as previously ac-
cepted, was that of a simple bisilicate of aluminum and beryllium, and
the only uncertainty surrounding it was supposed to be that connected

& ats

MINERALOGY. ; 551

with the question as to the true atomic weight of beryllium. Penfield
has made a series of careful analyses on pure specimens of beryl from
seven different localities, and shows by them that beryl uniformly con-
tains both alkalies and basic water, which earlier analysts have over-
looked. Thus the Hebron, Me., beryl contains nearly 5 per cent. of
cesium oxide, with 1 per cent. lithia and 1.8 soda and 2.3 water. The
beryl from Branchville, Conn., contains 1.5 per cent. of soda and 0.7
lithia, with 2.7 water, and that of Aduntschilon, Siberia, contains 0.25
per cent. soda and 1.1 water. The true formula of the species must,
therefore, take account of both alkalies and water, but additional
chemical work is needed to establish it thoroughly. Another point of
interest is the.identity of the rare mineral, scovillite, from Salisbury,
Conn., with the even rarer rhabdophane from Cornwall. A paper by
Brush and Penfield (Jb., xxvi1, 200) discusses this subject, and shows
that the mineral is essentially a hydrous phosphate of yttrium, erbium,
lanthanum, and didymium.

A new analysis of the haydenite of Baltimore has been made by Morse
and Bayley (Amer. Chem. Journ., VI., 24), which proves that the earlier
analysis was incorrect, and that it is, as has been assumed, identical
with chabazite. A hydrous sulphate of manganese and aluminum from
Sevier County, Tennessee, has been investigated by W. G. Brown (Jb.,
p. 97). It is shown not to correspond exactly to any of the known sul-
phates, though related to the afjohnite of South Africa and bosjemanite
of several localities. The same chemist has analyzed the cassiterite
from Irish Creek, Rockbridge County, Virginia (Zb., p. 185). Messrs.
Clarke and Chatard have published (Amer. Jour. Sci., XX V1, 20) analy-
ses of a series of minerals from different localities, including allanite
from Topsham, Me., some jade-like minerals, the material of Eskimo
implements collected at Point Barrow, Alaska, &e. Renard and Kle-
ment have a paper in the Bulletin of the Royal Academy of Belgium
(November 8, 1884) on the chemical composition of crocidolite and fibrous
quartz of South Africa.

NEW MINERAL LOCALITIES IN THE UNITED STATES.

The most interesting discovery of the past year is that of the rare
mineral herderite at Stoneham, Me., a locality which has already fur-
nished fine crystals of topaz and a number of other interesting minerals
(see the Report for 1883). The original herderite was described by
Haidinger in 1828, from a specimen from the tin mines of Ehrenfried-
ersdorf, in Saxony. The form was then made out fully, but the compo-
sition was left uncertain, there being only some blowpipe trials made,
according to which it was decided to be probably a fluo-phosphate of
aluminum and calcium. Only three or four specimens have been known

to exist, and from 1828 till 1884 nothing was added to our knowledge

of the species. Now, however, it has been found, as first described, by
552 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

W. E. Hidden (Amer. Journ. Sct., XXVIII, 73), at Stoneham, and in suffi-
cient quantities to allow of its thorough study. The erytalline form has
been found to be near that of the original mineral (Zb., p. 229), and also
its optical characters (Bull. Soc. Min., France, vit, 230). An analysis
was made by J. B. Mackintosh (Amer. Journ. Sei., xxvu1, 135), which
resulted in proving that it was a fluo-phosphate of beryllium and eal-
cium. Some doubt was thrown upon this determination by analyses by
Winkler (Jahrb. Min., 1884, 11, 134), on both the Maine mineral and that
from the original Saxon locality. The analyses of Winkler, however,
were made upon minute quantities, and have since been proved by Genth
to be inaccurate (Amer. Phil. Soc., October 17, 1884), Genth’s results con-
firming those of Mackintosh most fully and establishing the identity of
the two minerals.

Another mineralogical discovery of hardly less interest is that of the
beautiful new borate called colemanite, a description of which is given
among the new species beyond. The new Colorado minerals, zunyite
and guitermanite, are also mentioned in the same place.

Dr. Hillebrand has described a number of mineral occurrences which
present points of novelty. One paper (Amer. Journ. Sci., XX VU, 349) con-
tains an account of an unusual variety of nickeliferous lollingite occurring
in complex twin crystals, from Teocalli Mountain, on Brush Creek, Gunni-
son County, Colorado; of a variety of cosalite containing 8.4 per cent. of
silver and 7.5 per cent. of copper, from the Comstock mine near Parrott
City, La Plata County; of a sulphide of bismuth, silver and copper, per-
haps new, from the Missouri mine, Hall’s Valley, Park County; of hiib-
nerite, from the Uncompahgre district, Ouray County, and also from
Phillipsburg, Montana.

Another paper by the same author (Proc. Colorado Sei. Soc., 1, 112),
contains descriptions of a number of rare minerals, the majority new to
America, from the American Eagle mine, Tintic district, Utah. These
are olivenite in fine crystals, also in the brown compact fibrous form
called wood copper; conichalcite in emerald-green globular forms, with
radiated structure; chenevixite, in olive-green to greenish-yellow, com-
pact masses imbedded in the ore; also jarosite and a hydrous calcium
arsenate in fine, silky,white needles. He also describes bindheimite from
Secret Canon, Nevada; zinckenite from the Brobdignag mine, Red
Mountain, San Juan County, Colorado; and the rare nickel telluride
melonite from Boulder County, Colorado. Mr. Richard Pearce mentions
(Ib., p. 111) the occurrence of native bismuth with bismutite from Cum-
mins City, North Park, Colorado. The same volume of Proceedings re-
ferred to also contains a list of the important minerals of Colorado, with
localities, prepared by Mr. Whitman Cross.

Prof. W. P..Blake has described the occurrence of gigantic crystals
of spodumene at the Etta tin mine in Pennington County, Dakota. One
crystal is spoken of penetrating massive quartz and feldspar, which was
36 feet long and from 1 to 3 feet in thickness. At the Ingersoll claim,

pte nse scone

eb he eL

MINERALOGY. 553

in the same region, the same writer mentions the occurrence (Am. J. Sci.,
XXVIII, 341) of crystallized masses of a mineral which appeared to be col- .
umbite. One mass weighed by calculation about a ton. This mineral is
probably in fact tantalite, for an analysis of a similar mineral from the
same locality by C. A. Schaeffer proved it to contain 79 per cent. tanta-
lum pentoxide; moreover, the specific gravity was 7.72; that of typical
tantalite ranging from 7 to 8, and of ordinary columbite from 5.4 to
6.5. Fine erystals of vanadinite are described by F. H. Blake (J0.,
XXVIII, 145), from the Black Prince mine, Pioneer mining district, Pinal
County, Arizona. They vary in color from yellow to deep red, the latter
being the most common; wulfenite also occurs at the same mine, but not
in very perfect crystals. S. B. Newberry (Jb., xxvui1, 122) mentions the
discovery of nickel ore in large quantities in Cottonwood Campus,
Churchill County, Nevada. The specimens obtained from a depth of 80
feet were pure massive niccolite; these from depths of 60 feet and 45 feet
showed more or less oxidation and hydration; and specimens from near
the surface consisted of annabergite, the hydrated arsenate of nickel.
An interesting occurrence in New Jersey is mentioned by Prof. Geo.
H. Cook in his annual report of the Geological Survey, that of grains
of metallic iron in the triassic red shales near New Brunswick. They
were brought up by a drill used to bore a deep well, and were found also
in the surface soil—the correctness of the observations is regarded as
being above doubt. Prof. H. Carvill Lewis has given a preliminary ac-
count of an interesting mineral occurring in tetragonal crystals in calcite
at Wakefield, Canada. It has the form of sarcolite, but a microscopic
examination has proved it to be an altered mineral pseudomorph, after
some original mineral, which has not yet been found at the locality. In
occurrence and relatious it is suggestive of the gehlenite from the Tyrol.
The name cacoclasite was suggested for it, in allusion to the absence of
cleavage, before its pseudomorphous character was established. The
same author describes a yariety of dark-bluish spinel, also from Wake-
field; it is remarkable for having an approximately cubic form, the
planes, however, being much rounded. Barite crystals from DeKalb,
Saint Lawrence County, New York, have been described by Dr. Geo.
H. Williams. From Topsham, Me.. Prof. F.C. Robinson has obtained
crystals of allanite (Amer. Jour. Sci., XxVU, 412), which he has subjected
to chemical analysis. Additional points of interest are the occurrence
of kaolinite in microscopic crystals, showing pyramidal planes, at the
National Belle mine at Red Mountain, Ouray County, Colorado, as noted
by R. C. Hills (Jb., xxvu, 472); also the occurrence of leucite in lava in
the vicinity of the volcano, Cerro de las Virgines, in Lower California.

NEW MINERALS.

Aimajibrite, Aimatolite—See Hemafibrite, Hematolite, below.
Allaktite.—This is one of a group of manganese arsenates recently
discovered in Nordmark, Sweden. This group includes allaktite, dia-
554 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 14.

delphite (or aimatolite=hematolite), hemafibrite (¢imafibrite), synadel-
_ phite. From this locality comes, too, manganostibiite, a related mineral
containing also antimony, and xanthoarsenite is still another manga-
nese arsenate (and antimonate) from a different Swedish locality. As
announced by A. Sjégren, allakite occurs in small crystals, rarely 4
-by 2™ in length and breadth, tabular parallel to the orthopinacoid.
They occur in cavities and druses, in a manganese calcite, together with
fluorite, pyrochroite, chrysolite, &c. The crystals, which are fully de-
seribed by H. Sjégren, are monoclinic in form and closely related to
pharmacolite and vivianite. They are quite complex, showing some fif-
teen different planes, half of them in the prismatic zone; the optic axes
lie in the plane of symmetry. The hardness is 4 to 5, the specific gravity
3.83 to 3.85. The erystals are strongly pleochroic, with blood-red, yel-
low, and bluish-green as the axial colors. The luster is vitreous, trans-
parent to translucent; the fracture is splintery. An analysis leads to the
formula Mn;As,0, + 4 H,MnO,. (Geol. For. Férh., Stockholm, vu, 109,
220, 407.)

Broggerite—This name has been given by Blomstrand in honor of the
Norwegian mineralogist, W. C. Brégger, to a uranium mineral, near
cleveite in composition—cleveite, it will be remembered, is lone allied
to uraninite or pitch-blende. The specimen examined by Blomstrand was
from the neighborhood of Moss, Norway. It formed part of an octahe-
dral crystal; the mineral, consequently, like the others named, is to be
referred to the isometric system. The hardness was 5 to 6, ue specific —
gravity 8.73, and the color iron black. An analysis Teer it to con-
sist of about 80 per cent. of the oxide of uranium, with 84 per cent. ot
lead oxide, 53 per cent. of thorina, and small quantities of other ele-—
ments, including the cerium yttrium metals. The author accompanies
his description of this mineral with an extended discussion of the vari-
ous minerals containing uranium. (Geol. For. Forhandl., Stockholm, vi,

Colemanite.—This is a new mineral of rare beauty and perfection of
form. It was first described by J. T. Evans, and named by him after
William T, Coleman, of San Francisco. Later the crystalline form has
been exhaustively studied by Jackson, and other contributions have
been made by mineralogists abroad. As shown by the analyses of
Evans, it is a hydrous borate of calcium, having the formula 2 CaO,
3B,0; + 5 HO, and very closely related to (if not identical with) the
priceite from Oregon and pandermite from the Black Sea. It occurs in
splendent crystals, sometimes attaining a size of 30™", lining cavities in
the massive mineral. They belong to the monoclinic system, and have
perfect clinodiagonal cleavage. In habit the crystals are near datolite,
and a hasty examination of them might lead to their being referred to
that species. The crystals are very highly modified, about forty differ-
ent forms having been observed, half of them on a single crystal. The
hardness is about 4 and the specific gravity 2.43. The crystals vary

Ie

from white to clear and colorless ; the massive mineral is white. The
locality-of this beautiful borate is in Southern California, in the Calico
district, San Bernardino County, and Death Valley, Inyo County.
(California Acad., Bulletins Nos. 1 and 2.)

Diadelphite—This name was given by H. Sjégren to a manganese
arsenate ‘from the Moss mines in Nordmark, Sweden, and simultane-
ously the same mineral was announced by Igelstrém under the name
aimatolite (properly hematolite). In its method of occurrence it is like
allaktite described above. The crystals are small, from a fraction of a
millimeter to 2™". In form they belong to the rhombohedral division of
the hexagonal system, but optically they show anomalies, and Ber-
trand calls them pseudo-hexagonal. The color is brownish-red to gar-
net-red, the streak light chocolate brown. The crystals become super-
ficially oxidized easily, and then turn black and opaque. The hardness
is 3.5. The name refers to the close relation the mineral bears to syn-
adelphite and the other manganese arsenates from Nordmark. (Geol.
For. Forh., Stockholm, vit, 210, 233, 369, 407; Bull. Soc. Min. France,
VII, 121, 124.)

Goyazite—A new hydrous phosphate of aluminum and cakcium, de-
scribed by Damour, from the diamond-bearing gravels of the province
of Minas Geraés, Brazil. It occurs in small rounded grains of a yellowish-
white color, showing one cleavage, normal to which the black cross of a
uniaxial crystal can be observed in the polariscope. The hardness is 5,
the specific gravity 3.26. The name refers to the province where the
principal diamond deposits occur. (Bull. Soe. Min., vit, 204.)

Guitermanite.—A name given by W. EF. Hillebrand, after Mr. Frank-
lin Guiterman, to a new metallic sulphide from the Zuni mine, near
Silverton, San Juan County, Colorado. It occurs intimately mixed with
zunyite (see below). When in the fresh state it has a bluish-gray color
and slight metallic luster. The hardness is about 3, the specific gravity
5.94. The formula deduced, after deducting the impurities present in
the material analyzed, is 10 PbS, 3 As,S3.

Hemajibrite (or Hemafibrite)—Another of the new manganese arse:
nates from Nordmark, Sweden, described by Igelstr6m, and named in
allusion to its color. It occurs in globular forms, with fibrous struct-
ure, mixed with magnetite and serpentine. According to Bertrand the
mineral is orthorhombic, with the acute positive bisectrix parallel to the
prismatic edge, and an optic axial angle of 70°. The color is blood-red,
to which the name given refers. Its composition is near that of allak-
tite, but it contains more water. (Geol. For. Forh., Stockholm, 210, 407 ;
Bull. Soc. Min. France, Vit, 121, 124.)

Hematolite (or Hemalolite).—The proper form of the name aimato-
lite, given by Igelstrém to the mineral also ealled diadelphite (which
see) by H. Sjogren. References as for hemafibrite above.

Hillangsite.—Described by Igelstr6m as a new mineral, but probably
only a variety of amphibole. It is said to resemble the anthophyllite
556 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FCR 1884.

from Texas, Pa. It is properly colorless and transparent, but some
times has a black metallic color from included microscopic crystals ot
magnetite. The luster is silky. The hardness is 6. It is difficultly
fusible to a black magnetic slag. An analysis makes it a bisilicate of
iron and manganese, with a little magnesium and calcium. The locality
is the iron mine of Hillang, Ludvika parish, Sweden; it occurs with
garnet, magnetite, and igelstromite. (Bull. Soc. Min., v11,282.)

Koninckite—Described by Cesaro as a new hydrated phosphate of iron,
corresponding to the formula Fe,P,0, + 6 H,O. It occurs in small
globular or semi-globular forms, consisting of radiating needles, which
are translucent and almost colorless, and are to be referred to the mono-
clinic system. It has a vitreous luster, a hardness of 3.5, and a specific
gravity of 2.3. it fuses readily to a black bead. Koninckite is found
with the fluo-phosphate of iron, richellite, recently described by the
same author at Visé, Belgium. It is named after Prof. De Koninck, of
Liege. (Ann. Soc. Geol. Belg., x1, 247.)

Manganostibiite.—Still another new mineral from Nordmark, Sweden.
According to Igelstrém, it occurs in black grains, probably to be re-
ferred to the orthorhombic system. These are found in crystalline lime-
stone with other manganiferous minerals, as hausmannite, pyrochroite,
allaktite. An analysis leads to the formula 5 MnO (Sb, As), O;, with
the antimony predominating. The name refers to its composition as
containing both manganese and antimony (stibium). (Geol. Fér. Forh.,
Stockholm, Vil, 210; Bull. Soc. Min. France, Vu, 120.)

Polylithionite—A. variety of lithia mica described by Lorenzen as
occurring at Kangerdluarsuk, Greenland, with rinkite (see below), arved-
sonite, egirite, eudialyte, &c. It is found in pale green to white six-
sided tabular crystals. These are divided, after the manner of zinn-
waldite, into six sectors, with striations diverging from the center; the
optical characters are also very near those of zinnwaldite. In composi-
tion it shows a higher percentage of silica and lithia, less alumina, and
almost noiron. The name has reference to the large amount of lithium.
(Zeitsch. Kryst., 1X, 251.)

kinkite—Associated with the lithia mica just described, and with the
other minerals named, is a mineral to which Lorenzen has given the
name rinkite,after Dr. Rink. It occurs in monoclinic crystals, tabular
in habit, parallel to the orthopinacoid. The color of the fresh mineral is
yellowish-brown, but the crystals are often slightly altered on the sur-
face, and these straw-yellow. The luster is vitreous to greasy. The hard-
ness is 5, the specific gravity 3.46. An analysis shows it to be a titano-
silicate of the cerium metals and calcium with sodium fluoride. (Lbid.)

Salmite.—This is a manganesian variety of chloritoid from Vielsalm,
Belgium, described by Eug. Prost. It occurs in irregular masses with
coarse saccharoidal structure and grayish color. The hardness is 5 to
6, and the specific gravity 3.38; this determination, however, is a little
low, in consequence of admixed quartz. An analysis shows the pres:

te We et

MINERALOGY. 557

ence of 7 per cent. manganese protoxide, which is the only distinguish-
ing feature of the variety. (Geol. Soc. Belg., 1884.)

Synade’phite—A new arsenate of manganese from Nordmark, Swe
den, described by H. Sjégren. It occurs sometimes with scheelite, some-
times in cavities in the porous calcium carbonate. The crystais belong
to the monoclinic system, and are very near liroconite in angle; also
not far off from lazulite. The color is blackish-brown to black, being
considerably darker than that of the other manganese arsenates de-
scribed from the same locality; it is translucent to nearly opaque. The
luster is vitreous on the fracture, submetallic on erystalline faces. The
hardness is 4.5, the specific gravity 3.46 to 3.50. The composition is
stated to be that of a hydrated arsenate of manganese, with also alumina
and iron, being near that of diadelphite, from which, however, it differs
in containing less water. The crystalline forms of the two species are
also distinct. The name has reference to the close relation to diadel-
phite and the other allied species from the locality. (Geol. For. Forh.,
Stockholm, V11, 235, 382, 407.)

Utahite—A mineral from the Eureka Hill mine, in the Tintic district,
Utah, described by Arzruni. It occurs in fine scales forming an aggre-
gate with silky luster as a coating on quartz. Under the microscope
the scales are found to be hexagonal plates with rhombohedral planes on
theedges. Notwithstanding the minuteness of the crystals it was found
possible to measure them,and so to determine the length of the vertical
axis, namely, c= 1.1389. The mineral has been analyzed by M. Damour
and sbown to correspond with the formula 3 Fe,O03, 3 SO;4+4 H,O; itis
consequently a basic sulphate of iron sesquioxide. (Zeitsch. Kryst., UX,
598; or Bull. Soc. Min. France, Vii, 126, 128.) :

Xanthoarsenite.—Described by Igelstrém as a new arsenate of man-
ganese from the Sj6 mines in the parish of Grythyttan, Sweden. It
occurs in sulphur-yellow masses, resembling the yellow compact garnet
found with rhodonite at the Langban mines. Itis associated with haus-
mannite, magnetite, and hematite. No crystals were found, but Ber-
trand has shown that it is optically biaxial; whether it belongs to the
orthorhombic, monoclinic, or triclinic system could not be decided. An
analysis showed it to be a hydrous arsenate of manganese chiefly, with
also a little antimony replacing the arsenic, and small quantities of iron,
magnesium, and calcium replacing the manganese. It is very near the
chondroarsenite of the same author, only differing in containing a little
more water, and having a more decidedly yellow-color; it is also related
to the manganese arsenates from Nordmark described above. (Bull. Soc.
Min., Vu, 237.) :

Zunyite.—A remarkable new mineral described by Hillebrand from
the Zuni mine on Anvil Mountain, near Silverton, San Juan County,
Colorado. It oceurs intimately intermingled with the sulphide of ar-
senic and lead, guitermanite (see above), from which it was separated
for examination by removing the sulpnide by nitric acid, The crystals
558 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

thus obtained were found to be tetrahedral in habit, with also the
planes of the minus tetrahedron, cube, and perhaps the dodecahedron ;
there is cleayage parallel to the faces of both tetrahdrons. The crystals
are clear and transparent, except as rendered black and opaque by in-
clusions of black grains of titanic oxide. The luster is vitreous. The
hardness is about 7, and the specific gravity 2.875. Several careful
analyses were made which fix in general the composition of the mineral,
but without entirely establishing its exact formula. It is shown to be
a silicate of aluminum, very low in silica, with nearly 11 per cent. of
water assumed to be basic, as it does not go off at 270°C., also 5.6 per
cent. fluorine and 3 per cent. chlorine. The mineral is then as remark-
able in composition as in erys talline form, and deserves further study.
(Proc. Colorado Scientific Soc., vol. 1, 124.)

NECROLOGY OF MINERALOGISTS, 1884.

FRIEDRICH KLOCKE.—Born May 28, 1847, in Breslau ; died June 17,
1834. He was assistant in mineralogy at Heidelberg in 1868-70; in
1879 he became “ausserordentlicher Professor” at Freiburg, in Breis-
gau.; in 1881 he became “ordentlicher Professor” of mineralogy and
petrography at Marburg. The list of his scientific papers includes 17
articles, many of them devoted to physical mineralogy; his most im-
portant contributions are those upon the cause of ‘optical anomalies” of
crystals as due to secondary causes. (See the Reports for 1882, 1883.)

JOHANNES LORENZEN.—Born November 23, 1855, in Sénder-Jylland ;
died May 5, 1884, when on his way from Copenhagen to Greenland. He
was curator of the Mineralogical Museum at Copenhagen, and the author
of a number of important mineralogical papers. Among his contribu-
tions may be mentioned his memoirs on the metallic iron of Greenland,
and the minerals occurring in the sodalite-synite of the Tunngdliarfik
and Kangerdluarsuk fiords of Southern Greenland.

QUINTINO SELLA.—Born at Mosso, in Piedmont, July 17, 1827; died
March 14,1884. He was a mathematician and mineralogist of the high-
est rank, and at the same time one of the foremost statesmen of United
Italy. In the last capacity he served in several distinguished positions,
being for many years minister of finance. His scientific contributions
were chiefly in crystallography ; he also took an active part in the ar-

rangements with reference to the geological survey of Italy. He was
president of the R. Accademia dei Lincei.

A REVIEW OF THE PROGRESS OF NORTH AMERIOAN IN-
VERTEBRATE PALZ ONTOLOGY FOR 1884.

By JoHN BELKNAP MARGCOU.

In this work I have endeavored to collect the titles of all of the works
on North American invertebrate paleontology published during the
past year. An attempt has been made to give a brief idea of the con-
tents of each work, the new genera and species described, and the general
conclusions of the authors. ‘The alphabetical arrangement by authors
seemed, after a good deal of thought, the best method of arrangement
and has consequently been adopted. The explanatory notices are placed
after each title. The work I hope will prove useful, and I will be glad
if those who notice them will call my attention to any omissions.

Ami, H. M.—Notes on Triarthus spinosus Billings. (Trans. Ottawa
Field Naturalists’ Club, No. 4. Ottawa, 1883.)

Interesting notes on this Trilobite with two figures, one a copy of
Billings’s, the other original, with some of the furrows and grooves on
the occipital segment imperfectly figured.

BEECHER, C. E.—Ceratiocaride from the Chemung and Waverly Groups
at Warren, Pa. (Rep. of progress, P. P. P., 2d Geol. Surv. Penna.,
pp. 1-22, pls. i and ii, Harrisburg, 1884.)

A very interesting paper on a group of which but little is known.
Gives descriptions of two new genera, Elymocaris and Tropidocaris, El.
siliqua n. sp. and IT. bicarinata, T. interrupta, T. alternata n. sp., and
also a new species of Echinocaris, E. socialisn. sp. He also redescribes
and gives good figures of EH. punctata Hall. The figures and descrip-
tions are excellent; a short bibliography of the subject is also given.

BILLINGS, W. R.—Notes on, and description of, some fossils from the
Trenton Limestone. (Trans. Ottawa Field Naturalists’ Club, No. 4.
Ottawa, 1883.)

Describes a new species, Heterocrinus bellevillensis, with good figures.
Gives a good illustration showing the arms of Dendrocrinus jewettir
Billings, 1859; he estimates their number at least at forty. Describes

563
564 : SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

a ne. variety of Amygdalocystites florealis as var. levis. The illustra-

tions are good. He records the existence in the Trenton limestone at
Brigham’s Lake, Hull, of Jocrinus subcrassus, Glyptocrinus decadactylus,
and Gl. parvus.

CHAPMAN, EH. J.—A Classification of Crinoids. (Trans. Royal Soc. Can-
ada, vol. 1, section iv, 1882, pp. 113-116. Montreal, 1883.) [Ap-
peared 1884. |

This classification is based on the presence or absence of a canalicu-
lated structure in the calyx and arm-plates. The author makes three
divisions with a subdivision in the first and second divisions. In the
first division the plates (apart from the stem segments) are without in-
ternal canals; in the second the arm-plates are perforated internally ;
and in the third a system of canals radiates from the base of the calyx
to the extremities of the arms. The following is asummary of the clas-
sification : :

I. Emedullata :
1. Amplicincta :
. Proclinata (e. g. Cheirocrinus).
. Attenuata (e. g. Pisocrinus; Hybocrinus).
. Spatiosa (e. g. Platyerinus).
. Pinnigera (e. g. Poteriocrinus).
5. Disjuncta (e. g. Marsupites).
2. Multicincta:
1. Squamosa (e. g. Ichthyocrinus).
2. Copulata (e. g. Melocrinus ; Eucalyptocrinus).
3. Ornata (e. g. Actinocrinus ; Glyptocrinus).
4, Opulenta (e. g. Polypeltes).
5. Mutica (e. g. Uintacrinus).
Il. Fistulata: .
1. Ramosa (e. g. Cyathocrinus)

CLAYPOLE, E. W.—On the occurrence of the Genus Dalmanites jn the
Lower Carboniferous Rocks of Ohio. (Geol. Magazine, 3d Decade,
July, 1884, vol. i, No. vii, pp. 303, 307, London.)

The author describes Dalmanites? Cuyahoga, illustrated by a wood-
cut, and he discusses the Trilobitic fauna of the carboniferous.

The figures are clear. The new species described are as follows:
Bathyurus taurifrons, B.? crotalifrons, Cyrtoceras vassarina, C.% dac-

The author, from the fact that he found a crinoid stem disposed in a
perfect natural coil, argues that it placed itself in that position, was de-
stroyed while in that position, and must have had the power of motion
to place itself in that position.

peared December, 1884. |
This work is divided into three parts. In the first Professor Fontaine

gives a brief description of the geology of the Virginia Mesozoic areas.

In the second he describes the flora, among it the two new genera, Mer-

tensides n. g. and Pseudodancopsis n. g., and twenty-seven new species:

Schizoneura virginiensis, Acrostichides rhombifolius, A. microphyllus, A.

densifolius. Mertensides distans, Asterocarpus virginiensis, A. platyrachis,

A. penticarpa, Pecopteris rarinervis, Cladophlebis subfalcata, C. auriculata,

C. ovata, C. microphylla, C. pseudowhitbiensis, C. rotundiloba, Lonchop-

teris virginiensis, Pseudodancopsis reticulata, P. nervosa, Petrophyllum in-

cequale, Ctenophyllum truncatum, C. grandifolium, C. giganteum, Podo-
zamites emmonst, Sphenozamites rogersianus, Cycadites tenuinervis, Zamio-
strobus virginiensis, Baiera multifida.

A table comparing them with plants from the Triassae, Jurassic, and
Rhetice of other regions is given; 9 per cent. show affinities with Tri-
assic forms, 19 per cent. with Jurassic forms, and 28 per cent. with
Khetic forms. The flora must therefore be considered not older than
the Rheetic.

In the third part he republishes Emmons’s figures of the Mesozoic flora

of North Carolina and compares this flora with that of Virginia in a
table, showing also the affinities to Jurassic, Rhetic, and Triassic plants
of foreign countries. This list contains thirty-nine species. Twenty-
three per cent. of these are peculiar to North Carolina, 41 per cent. are
found in Virginia, 20 per cent. are allied to or identical with Jurassic
forms, and 33 per cent. are allied to or identical with Rheetic forms, and
therefore the North Carolina flora may be considered of the same age as
that of Virginia.

HAMBACH, G.--Notes about the Structure and Classification of the Pen-
tremites. (Trans. Acad. Sci. Saint Louis, vol. tv, No. 3, pp. 537-547.
Saint Louis, 1584.)

A portion of the paper is devoted to answering Mr. Carpenter’s eriti-
cisms on the author’s paper on the Anatomy of the Blastoidea. The
author considers Pentremites more closely related to Hehinus than to
the Crinoidea; he gonsiders it impracticable to divide the genus Pen-
tremites into four or five new genera, as has been proposed by Mr. Carpen-
ter. Mr. Hambach thinks that all described Pentremites (except those
which belong tothe genus Codaster or Codonites) can easily be distributed
in one of these three divisions, viz: First division comprises all species
in which the horizontal portion of the deltoid piece is very narrow, the
sinus to both sides in the deltoid and lancet pieces comparatively large,
and so surrounded by the zigzag plicated integument that two of the
so formed openings appear externally only as one, e. g., P. florealis
Say, and P. reinwardtii Troost. The second division comprises all
species in which the deltoid pieces are very broad, the lancet pieces
very narrow, and the sinus for the formation of the spiracle openings
in both deltoid and lancet pieces very little; the zigzag plicated in-
tegument corresponding to the narrow ambulacral field is not wide
enough to surround these openings fully, hence they haye to remain
568 . SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

separate, or, in other words, where we have ten distinctly visible
openings, e. g., P. mels Owen & Shumard, and P. crenulatus Roemer.
The third division comprises all species in which the deltoid pieces are
perforated, because the lancet pieces do not reach far enough to the
summit to enter into the composition of the spiracle openings, e. g., P.
norwoodi Owen & Shumard, and P. ellipticus Sowerby. The article is
illustrated by six figures in the text.

The author describes the following new species from the subcarbon-
iferous limestones: Melonites crassus, M. irregularis, Oligoporus parvus,

Describes Ammonites Parkeri, considers it closely related to ** Arcestes
antiquus” Waagen. It is associated with Zaphrentis, Phillipsia, Bel-
lerophon, Conularia, Chonetes, and Productus. Professor Heilprin refers
this form to the “old genus Ammonites,” but as nearly as can be
judged from the figures and descriptions we would place it in the genus
Popanoceras Hyatt, of which Arcestes antiquum Waagen is an extreme
form.

of certain species of plants, the divers horizons of coal strata in differ-
ent localities. But with the exception of a few cases of marked iden-
tity, as long as the observations were confined to a field of limited area,
he considers it is right to say that generally the data furnished by re-
mains of fossil plants are either insufficient or deceptive; insufficient,
because the specimens of fossil plants are rarely found representing
such a number of species that a satisfactory comparison can be made

_ between the plants of different localities; deceptive, because the vege-

ee

tation of the coal period, like that of the present epoch, has been sub-
jected to great variations, according to geographical distribution or
local influences. Professor Lesquereux makes four distinct modifica-
tions of the essential characters of the pre-Carboniferous and Carbonifer-
ous floras. The first, comprising the Lower or pre-Carboniferous, is per-
sistent in the Devonian, Chemung, and the Catskill; the second, partly
marked in the Pocono, becomes modified and persistent in the sub and

intra conglomerate measures; the third pertains to the lower pro-

ductive coal measures from above the conglomerate to the base of the
barren beds of Pennsylvania; the fourth is that of the upper pro-
ductive coal measures, including the Pittsburgh coal and a few hun-
dred feet above. Of course some species of each group have a greater
degree of persistence, and pass from a lower to an upper stage.

The author describes the new genus Dendrophycus and the following
new species :

Dendrophycus desorii, Calamostachys lanceolata, C. brevifolia, Volk-

In the descriptive part of this work Mr. Lesquereux gives descrip-
tions of the coal flora, a part of which are modified or borrowed from
his U.S. Coal Flora, Report P, of the 2d Geol. Surv. Penna. The plaies
and figures are very good of their kind, and the whole work answers
very well its purpose of an elementary treatise on the subject. The
Geological Survey of Indiana has done excellent work in this direction.
and it is to be hoped that its labors will not be permanently discon-
tinued.

Relates to the development of the species Ctenocephalus Mathewi and
other Conocorypheans of the Acadian fauna, and is considered under
the three heads, development of the Glabella, acquisition of sensory
organs, and the decoration of the test.

MAt1HEW, G. F.—The Geological Age of the Acadian Fauna. (Geol.
Mag. 3d Decade, vol. I, pp. 470,471. London, 1884.)

An attempt is made to show more accurately than has yet been done
the position of the Saint John Cambrian. It is shown that the genera
and species of the Acadian trilobites do not agree with those of the
Menevian in its more restricted sense. Mr. C. D. Walcott considers
the Saint John fauna as the oldest known Cambrian fauna. Both the
above papers are apparently abstracts of papers prepared for the meet-
ing of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, at Mon-
treal, in 1884.

The author identifies a few American forms with European ones in
addition to those already identified by Mr. Heilprin, and describes the

_ following new species from the Eocene sands of Claiborne, Ala.: Zibiella

new genus of Pteropoda, but no synopsis of generic characters is given.
The new species are illustrated by cuts in the text.

NEUMAYER, M.—(Neu. Jahrb. fiir Min. Geol. und Pal. Stuttgart, 1884.)

The author notes the parallel position occupied by the Laramie group
in Northwestern America and the intertrappean beds of the Deccan in
Hindostan, both being placed between the Cretaceous and Eocene, and

All but two or three of the specimens obtained belong to the group of
cockroaches; and although Mr. Lesquereux thinks the beds of Permian
age according to the fossil flora, Mr. Scudder thinks the evidence of
the insects is in favor of their Triassic age. Eleven of the seventeen
species of cockroaches and five of the nine genera found at Fairplay,
Colorado, belong to the Paleoblattariw. The genera are as follows:
Hioblattina (1 sp.), Petrablattina (2 sp.), Anthracoblattina (1 sp.?), Spilo-
blattina n. g. (4 sp.), and Poroblattina n. g. (3 sp.). As seen above two
of the genera are new.

A discussion of Carboniferous Myriapods. The author proposes the
new suborder Protozyngnatha for the reception of the genus Palwocampa
M. and W., and in the suborder Archipolypoda, in the family of the

Gives an account of the very interesting paleozoic fauna of this dis-
trict. The first chapter contains a fair summary of the results. A. com-
mingling of Upper Devonian and Lower Carboniferous fossils occurs.
The discussion of the development of Olenellus Howelli is very interest-
ing. The succession in the faunal series from the Olenellus beds,
through a well-defined fauna of the character of the Potsdam group of
New York and the Mississippi Valley, to one containing a mixture of
Cambrian and Silurian types passing upward to a fauna comparable
to that of the Chazy and Calciferous groups, is shown. The transi-
tion is said to be very gradual, and such as would occur where there
had been no marked physical disturbance. Here is another instance of
the occurrence of passage beds between faunas before considered per-
fectly distinct, and it is very interesting to note this fact in our earliest
faunas, which is so common in our later ones.

The author gives carefully prepared systematic lists ef the fossils in
each formation and a paleozoic section of Nevada showing the vertical
range of the genera. Two new genera are described, Schizambon, referred
to the Siphonotretid, from the L. Silurian Pogonip group and Zaptychius,
an auricula-like shell, from the Carboniferous. The author describes one
hundred and seventy-three new species, of which thirty are from the
Cambrian: Acrothele? dichotoma, Scenella ? conula, Kutorgina whitfieldi,

posed in place of the generi¢ use of the name Hrignys anticipated. Mr.
G. F. Matthew having proposed the name Bailiella, Conocoryphe (Bai-

the St. John species. Mr. Walcott doés not accept the genus Conoce-
phalites, and refers its different species to some of Ptychoparia and one
of Conocoryphe. ;

The second part is on the “fauna of the Braintree argillites.” Mr:
‘Walcott gives excellent figures of Paradoxides harlani and doubts its
specific difference from P. bennetti. He describes two new species from
this formation, Hyolithes shaleri and Ptychoparia rogersi, and refers W hit-
field’s Arionellus quadrangularis to the genus Agraulos. ~

Part three contains the description of a new genus and species of
Phyllopoda from the middle Cambrian slates uf Parker’s farm, Georgia,
Vt., Protocaries n. g. type P. marshi. The illustrations are all wood-

580 ’ SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 12884.

in thickness, are supposed to represent the lower part of the middle Cre-
taceous, notwithstanding the fact that they contain many fossils consid-
ered Jurassic by previous American authors. However, the identity of
these species is very doubtful. The upper division, containing Znocera-
mus problematicus, is 1,500 feet thick and is separated from the three
lower divisions by 2,000 feet of unfossiliferous strata, the whole mass
resting unconformably upon what is considered the Triassic. The au-
thor is driven by his conclusions to assert that the Jurassic of the Black
Hills and Rocky Mountains is Cretaceous. In order to make a more com-
plete Cretaceous series, he cuts out the entire Jurassic formation. Mr.
Whiteaves seems to have overlooked the work of Mr. C. Grewingk, who
described the fossils brought back by Ilia Wossnessensky, the work of
Kichwald, who described the fossils brought back by Doroschin, and
that of Pinart, all three describing asomewhat similar fauna in Russian
America. He has also not noticed the fact that traces of a Jurassico-
cretaceo fauna occur from the neighborhood of Moscow, through Siberia
to Alaska, and that very possibly be has similar passage beds in British
Columbia and Queen Charlotte’s Islands, that such passage beds are
found between every formation, and that the occurrence of some of our
Jurassic fossils in such a connection is a poor reason for calling Creta-
ceous the beds where there is no such association.

The following new species are described: Belemnites skidegatensis ?,
Spiroceras carlottensis, Sphenodiscus mandensis, Haploceras cumshewaense,

This part is on some new, imperfectly characterized, or previously

unrecorded species of fossils from the Guelph Formation of Ontario.

The lists of the fossils of this formation in the “ Geology of Canada”

‘contain the following names, for the species of which no descriptions or

Amplexus lascatus, Cyclonema galtensis, C. Thysbe, C. Psyche, C. depressa,

Pleurotomaria huronensis, Murchisonia tullia, Cyrtoceras jonesi. The

Mr. Whitfield thinks that the typical New York Potsdam is about
equivalent to the lower portion of the Wisconsin areas, and that the
Acadian beds of Canada and Vermont and perhaps the other Atlantic
areas are not appreciably ditferent in age, but that the difference in
faune is more the result of conditions upon which life depended than
a difference in time. Mr. Whitfield was probably unaware of the fact
that 3,000 feet of limestone without a break separate the Georgian
from the Potsdam fauna in Central Nevada. He describes the following
new species: Lingulepis minima, Orthisina orientalis, Nothozoe vermon-

ZOOLOGY.

By Professor THEODORE GILL.

INTRODUCTION.

Investigations ifto the seerets of the animal world have been con-
ducted by most of the investigators prominent for the past few years,
and by the usual number of recruits to the ranks of zoologists. The
addition to our knowledge of the various types of the animal kingdom
has been substantial and important, but as usual chiefly confined to
matters of detail and refinement, which can be only appreciated by the
skilled biologist. Some noteworthy discoveries that can beset forth in
a few words, and whose importance can readily be appreciated by all
have likewise been made. Among them are the find of a Silurian scor-
pion which takes the class of Arachnids much farther back in time, a
like extension backwards of the fishes by the exhumation of remains
near the base of the upper Silurian beds of Pennsylvania, by Mr. Clay-

pole, and the confirmation of the oviparity of the Monotremes, of the

only two known family types (Ornithorhynchids and Tachyglossids),
by Messrs. W. D. Caldwell and W. Haacke, as well as some insight into
their embryonic stages.

There are also two features of special interest as signs of the time,
in the accessions to the ranks of true investigators from sources from

which in times past none looked for work of an exact or highly original

nature; such are the female sex and people formerly called barbarous.

A most pleasant feature is the number of recent female contributors,
and there is a most laudable absence of ignorant wonder and congratu-
lation in all of them. America and England have been especially for-
tunate in the number of able female investigators. We may be pardoned
for recalling the names of a few. In the United States, Miss Rosa
Smith, of San Diego, Cal., has deseribed new species and a genus of
fishes; Miss Katherine J. Bush has published a useful catalogue of
mollusea and echinodermata of Labrador; Miss Mary H. Hinckley has
made known the habits and transformations of a tree-frog (JZyla Picker-
ingit) in a special monograph; Miss Sara Gwendolen Foulke las made
known the structure and habits of many of the lower forms of animal
life; Miss Mary Esther Murtfeldt has given several communications on

583
584 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR is84.

insects ; and Miss Genevieve Jones and Miss Eliza Schulze have given
to the world a most magnificent illustrated work on the nests and eggs
of the birds of Ohio. In England, Miss %. A. Ormerod has published
excellent reports on the insects affecting agricultural interests; Miss

Catherine ©. Hopley has been active in the study of reptiles, and espec-

ially the snakes, and published a very creditable volume on the latter;
Miss Agnes Crane has contributed to the history of Brachiopods, Poly-
zoans, and other animals; and Miss Alice Johnston has attacked, with
a well-equipped mind and training, some of the most profound problems
in morphology. Further, we may name two who have done excellent
work in presenting in popular form the results of recent researches, Miss
Arabella Buckley, and Mrs. Martin, who, in conjunction with her hus-
band, Professor Martin, of the Johns Hopkins University, has published
a manual of physiology.

Distant and formerly isolated Japan has also furnished to the scien-
tific corps a notable contingent, who have demonstrated the ability of
the Mongolian race to hold their own with the best of the Caucasians.
Professor Kakichi Mitsikuri, a graduate of the Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, and now professor of zooiogy in the University of Tokio, and Dr.
Isao lijima have been working successfully in fields wherein only the
best trained minds, supplemented by extraordinary ski}l in anatomy
and manipulation generally, can hope for success. Laborers such as
these, of either sex or any country, will always be welcome.

A pleasant and in some ways an important event of the year was the
meeting, for the first time in its long history, of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science on American soil or even outside of
the British Isles. The session at Montreal in September was as largely
attended as could have been expected under the circumstances, and
there was a pleasant interchange of courtesies between the association
and: its younger American sister. Many naturalists long known to
each other by reputation, and often through correspondence, met face
to face for the first time, and doubtless misapprehensions were rectified,
better knowledge of each other obtained, mutual respect insured, and
personal friendship cemented.

As in the previous reports, the language of the original from which
the abstract is compiled is generally followed as closely as the case
will permit. It has, however, been found necessary to limit the ab-
stract to the illustration of the prominent idea underlying the original
memoir, and pass by the proofs and collateral argumenis. At the
same time it has been often attempted to bring the new discovery into
relation with the previous status of information respecting the group
under consideration. As to the special discoveries recorded, they have
been generally selected (1) on account of the modifications the forms
considered force on the system; or (2) for the reason that they are or

have been deemed to be of high taxonomic importance; or (3) because

the animals per se are of general interest; or, finally, (4) because they

*
ZOOLOGY. 585

are of special interest to the American naturalist. Of course zoologists
cultivating limited fields of research will find in omissions cause for
censure, and may urge that discoveries of inferior importance have
been noticed to the exclusion Of those better entitled to it. It is freely
admitted that this charge may even be justly made; but the limits
assigned to the record have been much exceeded, and the recorder has
studied the needs of the many rather than of the few, The summary
is intended, not for the advanced scientific student, but for those who
entertain a general interest in zoology or some of the better-known
classes.

A very partial bibliography of noteworthy memoirs and works relat-
ing to different class of animals is supplied, and will, it is hoped, prove
to be of use to some to whom the voluminous bibliographies and ree-
ords of progress in science are inaccessible.

It has been a difficult matter to_select the titles which might be
most advantageously introduced in a limited report like the present.
Articles of a general interest or of special importance as contributing
to throw light on the affinities of certain groups, or monographs have
been given the first place. Necessarily many very important papers
have not been referred to, and very few descriptive of species have
been admitted, and only when unusual interest attaches to the new
species or the groups which they enlarge.

The compiler desires to make special acknowledgment for most ma-
terial assistance to the Zoologischer Anzeiger of Professor Carus and to
the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society.

I. GENERAL ZOOLOGY.

The deep-sea researches of the United States Fish Commission in 1884.

Professor Verrill has given an account of the work of the steamer
Albatross in 1884. The exploration of the Gulf Stream region was con-
tinued under nearly the same conditions as in 1883, and four trips
586 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR igs4.

were made between July 20 and September 13. Sixty-nine dredgings
were made. Of these, five were in depths between 2,000 and 2,600
fathoms and the rest in less deep water. The results were “highly -
satisfactory, both in the way of physical observations and zoological
discoveries.” Large numbers of additions were “ made to the fauna, in-
cluding representatives of nearly all classes of deep-sea animals. Many
pelagic species were also secured in surface nets, and especially in the
trawl-wings. Among these there are some new forms, and many of
them have previously not been observed so far north and near the Gulf
Stream.” :

The deep-sea deposits were especially noteworthy. ‘ The bottom be-
tween 600-and 2,000 fathoms, in other regions, has generally been found
to consist mainly of ‘globigerina ooze, or sometimes of a mixture of
globigerina and pteropod ooze. Off our northern coast, however, this is
by no means always the case. The ooze is always mixed with some
sand and frequently with much clay-mud. In a number of instances
the bottom, between 500 and 1,200 fathoms, has been found to consist
of tough and compact clay, so thoroughly hardened that many large
angular masses, sometimes weighing more than fifty pounds, have been
brought up in the trawl.”

The animals obtained were sometimes of singular interest. ‘ Many
additions to the fauna of great depths were made, and a large portion
of them are undescribed forms. Some of the fishes were of great inter-
est. Huge spiny spider crabs (Lithodes A gassizit) over three feet across
were taken in 1,000 to 1,230 fathoms, and another very large crab
(Geryon quinguedens) occurred in great abundance in 500 to 1,000 fath-
oms.” Numerous species of handsome shrimps, many “of a bright color
and some of very large size, occurred as usual in the deeper dredgings.
Some of these had not been taken before.”

Of the Echinoderms, the star-fishes were numerous, and two species -
ofa very singular genus, called Brisinga, were obtained in many loeali-
ties, sometimes in large numbers. Ophiurans of many species were
also obtained in numerous localities. (Am. Journ. Se. (3), XXVIII, pp.
378-384.)

Origin of the deep-sea fauna.—In a menograph of the Pourtalesiide, a
family of deep-sea Echinoidea, Professor Sven Loven has expre sed some
thoughts respecting the origin of the deep-sea fauna, and suggested how
the forms characteristic of the depths may have been evolved, distrib-
uted, and modified from species of the littoral zone.

“In the adult state most of the marine evertebrates remain in their
native station, wandering within its precinets. Their embryonic and
larval age is their period of dispersal. Of numerous littoral forms, of
different classes, tribes, and orders, currents must occasionally carry
away the free swimming larve far into the sea, and during the course
of succeeding generations early stages of many a species will have in this

way reached the wide ocean. There they will have sunk, their de-
velopment accomplished all through depths full of danger and more
and more uncongenial, and a few of them will have settled on the bot-
tom of the abyss, and fewer still will have come to thrive there. Among
these some will long have their original character, and but slowly been

‘modified, while others will have exhibited a latitude of variation un- -

known or rarely seen where they came from, but upon the whole there
will be reasons for assuming the less altered forms to be new comers,
the more deviating to be old inhabitants of the deep.”

Organisms in ice.— A Philadelphia gentleman gave Prof. Joseph Leidy,
for examination, a vial of water obtained from a lump of ice which had
been used to cool ordinary drinking water. ‘From time to time, among
some sediment taken from the water-cooler, the gentleman had observed
what he supposed to be living worms, which he suspected were intro-
duced with the water into the cooler and not with the ice.” On exami-
nation of the water melted from this ice, Professor Leidy was ‘surprised
to find a number of worms among some flocculent sediment, mainly con-
sisting of vegetal hairs and other débris. Besides the worms, there were
also immature Anguillulas, and a number of Rotifer vulgaris, all living.
It would appear that these animals had all been contained in the ice,
and had been liberated.on melting. It was an unexpected source of
contamination of our drinking water that Professor Leidy had _ previ-
ously supposed very improbable. The little worms he was not familiar
with.” .

A study of the worms showed that “they belong to the family Lwm-
bricide, and probably may be an undescribed species of Lumbriculus.
They are white or colorless, from 4 to 6 millimeters long by a third of a
millimeter in thickness;” there are about thirty segments. ‘Several
dead worms swarmed in the interior with large, ovate, beaked, ciliated
infusoria, measuring from 0.05 to 0.06 ™™ long by 0.04 to 0.048™™ broad.”
(Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc. Phila., 1884, p. 260.)

Microscopic fauna in water reservoirs.—An accidental breaking of a
valve, necessitating the drawing off of the water from the Fairmount
reservoir, was taken advantage of by Mr. Edward Potts to study the
minute fauna to be found.

‘The commensal habit of many of the lower animals who feed by
the creation of ciliary whirlpool currents has been frequently referred
to; the weaker current-makers, such as vorticelle, stentors, and the
errant and tubicolous rotifers, planting themselves about the heads of
the stronger polyzoa to supply their own nets with what may have es-
caped from the others. The same instinctive principle which leads all
these to locate themselves most plentifully amongst the stones in the
rapids of streams, was-_particularly noticeable in promoting their ag-
gregation upon and in the neighborhood of the inlet and outlet gates
588 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884. ‘

of the reservoirs. The feeble currents produced by each can only
bring within its reach the floating provision from a very limited area ;
the volume of water poured through these gates brings to them a rich
supply, and the numbers and variety of these organisms increase in pro-
portion. Of the fixed forms were seen amongst the bryozoa, besides one
or more undetermined species of Plumatella, Pectinatella magnifica, and
Urnatella gracilis of Leidy, and the newly described Paludicella erecta.
Attached to these were vorticella, epistilis, and stentors innumerable ;
Pyxicola and Acineta, rotifers of various names, including prominently
Limnias and other probably undescribed forms among the melicertidz.
Very abundant among these was the interesting chaetobranch annelid,
Manayunkia speciosa Leidy, which has of late been frequently noticed
in this vicinity, and the wonderfully marine-looking hydroid Cordylo-
phora lacustris. This last was particularly abundant around the south-
east outlet, its stems forming a complete matting over many yards of
surface, commingled with bryozoa and sponges in intricate confusion.”
(Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc. Phila., 1884, pp. 217-219.)

Symbiosis of Hermit Crab and Sea-Anemone.—The subject of Sym-
biosis, or the association for mutual benefit of different animals, or,
may be, of an animal and a plant even, has of late been attracting much
attention. The name was first suggested by the French botanist, De
Bary, in connection with certain phenomena of the vegetable world.
The associates come together and associate “like two partners in a well
regulated business concern, co-operating in the work of life, taking part
in all its toils and troubles, and honorably sharing the common profits.”
The symbiotic relationship of one of the hermit crabs and a sea-anemone
(Adamsia palliata) has been studied in the Naples aquarium by Pro-
fessor Hertwig. The sea-anemone, a beautiful species, ‘ attaches itself
to the roof of the common abode in such a position that its mouth and
prehensile apparatus are always turned toward the bead of its-associ-
ate. It is thus enabled to join in all the expeditions of the restless
hermit crab and conveniently share in the common plunder. In return.
for this service the anemone protects its companion from his many
enemies by means of the numerous long threads which it shoots out at
the least alarm, and which are provided with millions of capsules
charged with a stinging acid like that of the common nettle. So close
is the compact entered into by the two partners that both have become
indispensable to each other,” and, ‘if the crab be removed from his
house, and this be stopped up so as to prevent his re-entering it, he will
cast about for another shell, and never stop until his old associate is
also transferred to their new abode.” Many similar cases of symbiosis
of actinians and decapod crustaceans are now known, and the relation-
ship is probably as intimate in almost all cases as the one studied.
(Am. Nat., XVIII, pp. 83, 84.)

Il, PROTOZOANS.
Sporozoans.

A new Sporozoan type.—In 1883 Dr. A. Schneider described a new
type of Sporozoans to which he gave the name Ophryocystis butschlii.
Later studies have not only confirmed the distinetness of the form, but
revealed characteristics so different from those manifested by others of
the class, as to have impelled the author to distinguish it as the type of
“a new order of Amcebosporidia.” The Amcebiform stage is very ver-
satile in its phases and has “a facies altogether different to that of any
known Sporozoan ;” there is “a large number of nuclei,” and in this
respect it presents an analogy “to certain Ameebina, and distantly to
the Myxosporidia.” <A ‘conjugation of two always uninuclear indi-
viduals has been observed, but conjugation is not known among the
Coccidia, and this peculiarity allies Ophryocystis to the most differen-
tiated Gregarines. The mode of sporulation allies them possibly to the
Myxosporidia, while, on the other hand, the production of falciform
bodies or sporozoites in the spores is the exact opposite of what takes
place in the Myxosporidia.” In fine, the process of conjugation and
the mode-of sporulation distinguishes Ophryocystids “from the Coc-
cidia, as do the pseudopodia and the sporulation from the Gregarinide,
and the falciform corpuscles from the Myxosporidia.” (Arch. Zool.
Expér. et Gén., 11, pp. 111-126, 1 pl.; J. R. WM. S. (2), vV, pp. 82-83.)

Rhizopods.

A continental Foraminifer.—The Foraminifers hitherto known are in-
habitants of the ocean, and the discovery of a species of the order in
saline continental waters is therefore of unusual interest. The form in
question proved to be not only a new species but a previously unknown
generic type. Its infusorian companions were mostly of marine types
of new species or conspecific with already known sea-forms, but “a
fourth of the whole number are only known as fresh-water forms.”

The new foraminiferous genus has been named Lnrtzia and belongs
to the group of Helicostegia ; the shell in form resembles the Rotaline
of the group Globigerine, in structure the Trochammine, and * the chem-
ical constitution is that of Difflugia, Trochammina, and some of the Globi-
gerina ;” it is stated that it closely connects the last with the Lagenide
by means of Trochammina and the Rotaline. (Zeitschr. f. wiss. Zool.,
XL, pp. 465-480; J. Rk. M.S. (2), IV, pp. 760-761.)

Dimorphism in Orbulina.—Long ago it was shown that in the interior
of the foraminiferous “shells” of the Orbulina type or genus were globi-
gerina-like bodies, and it was even urged that one was a stage of the
other. Valid objections, however, were ,brought against this view, but
the relations ot the two required elucidation. Recently uumerous
specimens of Orbulina wniversa, most of which were dredged from a
590 SCIENTIFi.C RECORD FOR 1884.

depth of about 2,000 fathoms by the “Talisman,” were subject to a criti-
cal examination by C. Schlumberger. The appearance previously indi-
cated was observed anew; ‘+a succession of globular chambers, arranged
in a spiral faslnon, like those of certain Globigerine,” were found within
the shells of some of the small Orbuline, but not in all. In many, even
of the small ones, no manifestation whatever of such contents existed,
and “the very large specimens also were nearly always empty.” Fur-
ther, on minute examination if was discovered that there were essential
histological and structural differences between the globigerina-like
bodies of Orbuline and true Globigerine.

The * plasmostracum” of the globigerina-like contents of the Orbu-
line is “‘extremely fine and traversed by widely scattered perforations ;”
the chambers forming the two first turns of the spiral are quite smooth,
while the following ones are provided with spines which reach as far as
the outer wall of the Orbulina and are there fixed firmly to it, and the
several chambers communicate with each other and also with the inte-
rior of the Orbulina.

The plasmostracum or cell-walls of the true Globigerine are relatively
thick, and punctured by closely approximated and numerous perfora-
tions.

In fine, the resemblance between the contents of the Orbulinw and
true Globigerine is simply superficial, and, apparently, the most prob-
able explanation is that Orbulina is another instance of dimorphism
among the Foraminifers such as has already been shown to exist in
other genera of that order by the author and Munier-Chalmas. (Comptes
Rendus, XCVIL1, pp. 1002-1004; J. R. M. S. (2), Iv, pp. 579-580.)

Life history of a Helizoan Rhizopod.—The life history of a beautiful
Heliozoan, named Clathrulina elegans, has been studied by a lady of
Philadelphia, Miss Sara Gwendolen TFoulke. This little rhizopod was
found “in myriads” attached to the roots of the Duck weec or Lemna.
In many cases they were seen in groups of ‘‘about twenty-five colony-
stocks, so matted together by the twisting of the pedicels, and so sur-
rounded by waste matter, as completely to conceal at that point the
supporting root fibre. The animals were in a most active condition,
feeding by means of their characteristic pseudopodial rays, and multi
plying so freely by self-division, that the water was full of the
Actinopbrys-like bodies, and almost every capsule supported from one
to ten young individuals. After being kept in captivity for two weeks,
the large social groups had decreased in number, although solitary
individuals were much more numerous. Reproduction was still going
on, but not so freely, and by more varied methods. The pbenomena
exhibited during the act of reproduction are the subject of this com-
munication.

‘The modes of repreduetion are four in number, two of these being
slightly similar, while the others essentially differ in character. These

eat sat
ZOOLOGY. — : 591

four modes are: first, by divisicn; second, by the instantaneous throw-
ing off of a small mass of sarcede; third, by the transformation of the
body into flagellate mcuads; and fourth, by, the formation and libera-
tion of minute germs. ‘ $

“ By the first mode (and this is the most common), the sarcode mass
within the capsule withdraws its rays, constricts, and divides into from

two to four granular masses, which, after a varying period of rest, pass

out from the capsule and instantly shoot forth pseudopodial rays on all
sides, thus assuming the appearance of an Actinophrys sol. These Acti-
nophrys-like bodies after a time develop a protoplasmic stalk, or pedi-
cel, by which they attach themselves, usually to the parent capsule. A
thin film of protoplasm is then thrown out and subtended by the rays,
at a short distance from the body, and this, by development and secre-
tion, becomes the latticed siliceous capsulé. The pedicel also becomes
more rigid, though always retaining a degree cf flexibleness. This
manner of reproduction was first described by Cienkowski, the great
Russian observer, and discoverer of Clathrulina elegans (see Leidy’s
Rhizopods of North America).

‘In the second mode of reproduction, the rays are not withdrawn, nor
does the body divide, but the sarcode becomes finally vacuolate, present-
ing knob-like projections. Suddenly a small mass of sarcode, usually
one of the knob-like projections, detaches itself, and, passing out of the
capsule, shoots out rays and develops, though more slowly, in the man-
ner above described. This continues until the parent body is much re-
duced in size, when the rays again protrude and the animal returns to
its normal condition.

‘‘The third mode of reproduction is by the formation and liberation
of minute germs. In this state, also, the rays are not withdrawn, but
the body of the Clathrulina becomes filled with minute green particles,
which, even before liberation, exhibit active motion. A number ot
these are expelled, inclosed in a thin protoplasmic film or globular sae,
which bursts shortly, and the liberated germs swim away. The devel-
opment of these germs, after this point, is yet to be followed.

“The fourth mode is still more remarkable, and is also significant in
bringing to light a new phase in the life history of the Heliozoa. The
Clathrulina, in which these phenomena were first observed, withdrew
its rays and divided into four parts, as in the ordinary method ; but the
sarcode, instead of becoming granular and of a rough surface, grew
smootherand more transparent. Then followed the period of quiescence; -
in this case of five or six hours’ duration, although in other instances
lasting three days and nights; after which one of the four parts began
slowly to emerge from the capsule, a second following a few moments
later.”

Tor the further progress of the last mode of multiplication, reference
must be made to Miss Foulke’s own communication. She thinks that
“this mode of reproduction secures 3 more wide-spread distribution of

°
592 SCIENTIFIC RECOKD FOR 1884.

the young than would be possible did this depend on the sluggish Acti-
nophrys form.” (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., Phila., 1884, pp. 17-19.)

Infusorians.

A marginal membrane in Trichomonas.—A hitherto unobserved pecu-
liarity of Trichomonas has been observed, which should incite to a re-
examination of related forms. At the anterior end of Trichomonas
vaginalis as well as 7. batrachorum, about the base of the three flagella,
T. Blachmann discovered an ‘undulating membrane” which “extends to

about the middle of the body ; this membrane, never hitherto observed, -

may be best seen if the creature is allowed to die gradually.” :

It is also recorded of Trichomonas batrachorum and Trichomastiz lacerte
at least, that “if the monad is allowed to remain for some time under the
pressure of the sun-glass the’whole margin of the animal is seen to ex-
hibit an active undulatory movement, though of course this is not so
regular as that of the membrane.” (Zeitschr. f. wiss. Zool., XL, pp. 42-
49;-J. BR. M.S. (2), 1V,-p. 159.)

PORIFERS.
Sponges.

Fossil sponges.—Although many fossil sponges have been described,
the information regarding them has been very scattered and altogether
in an unsatisfactory condition. To a large extent this defect has been
remedied by the publication of a “Catalogue of the Fossil Sponges in
the Geological Department of the British Museum, with descriptions of
new and little-known species,” by Dr. George J. Hinde. No less than
141 genera were represented by specimens in the Museum; of these 120
contained siliceous sponges, and the rest calcareous. Of the species,
32 belonged tothe Paleozoic times, 16 to the Triassic, 96 to the Jurassic,
245 to the Cretaceous, and only 3 were of Tertiary origin. The species
have been illustrated by 38 plates.

Some modifications of sponge spicules.—A notable modification of char-
acter induced in fresh-water sponges has been encountered by Mr.
Edward Potts. This modification has “apparently been affected by the
peculiar condition of the environment.” Amongst the sponges which
Mr. Potts found ‘“encrusting certain old pipes, recently removed, from
the water-works in the Schuylkill river in Philadelphia,” some portions
of the one called Meyenia Leidyi were ‘much more deeply colored with
rust than others, the statoblasts, particularly, seeming to be mere pseu-
domorphs of their originals in iron oxide, Fragments of this character
were boiled in nitric acid, washed ont and mounted for comparison with
other matter similarly treated, b tt free from such discoloration.” ‘The
normal skeleton spicule of the Meyenia Leidyi is “smooth, robust and
shorter than that of any other American species. Very rarely the fine
line of the axial channel is visibie, but in the specimen under examin-

\

ation the size and exterior appearance of the spicule remaining as be-
fore, the hardly noticeable channel has become a wide canal, open at
both ends, and occupying more than one-half of the breadth of the spi-
cule. Thisdoes not occur merely in occasional instances, but univer-
sally throughout the fragment of sponge so affected.

* The birotulate spicules of this sponge also are short and of a pecu-
liarly substantial appearance, with entire reflexed margins, yet in the
present preparation they could with difficulty be detected as mere ghosts
of their normal shapes. The two dises rarely remained together, their
characteristic entire margins were gone, the rotules being represented
merely by a line of very tine rays.” (Proc. Acad. Nat. Se. Phila., 1884,

Fresh-water sponges and water pollution—It las been stated that
fresh-water sponges, in their decay, are a notable source of pollution
of drinking-water, and that the supply thereof derived from the reser-
voirs may be materially injured by them. Mr. Edward Potts has taken
measures to inquire into the truth of these allegations. In the month
of February, 1884, he examined “the fore-bay at Fairmount Water-
works, on the Schuylkill River”, when the water had been temporarily
withdrawn. He found, on the bottom and sides, wherever he could get
within reach, and as a as his eye could detect in other places, the
surface ‘“ poeercdl by a mud.-colored incrustation of considerable thick-
ness, Which a more minute examination showed to be composed almost
eon of statoblasts and spicules of the sponge Meyenia Leidyi,” which
was the prominent one. Some few remains of Meyenia fluviatilis and
‘Spongilla fragilis were also seen.

‘While considering the effect of the presence of so large a sponge
growth at the very inlet to the supply pumps, Mr. Potts stated that this
‘particular species was conspicuous among the known North American.
sponges by its great relative density and the small proportion of its
sarcode or flesh. Its decay, therefore, at the termination of its period
of summer growth would be a less cause of pollution to the water-supply
than that of any other sponge.

‘* Moreover, from recent investigations ae the life history of these
low organisms, he was inclined to believe that decay was not the normal
or necessary result of the close of each season’s growth. The fragile
branches of some species inhabiting exposed situations may, of course,
be broken off and destroyed while the sarcode still covers them; but
in the sessile portions, and in all when sufficiently protected, the cells
of the sarcode at the period of full maturity, forsaking their places
along the lines of the skeleton framework, gather together by simulta-
neous ameboid movements into dense groups, where they are soon
covered by a tough chitinous ‘ coat,’ which, in time, generally becomes
surrounded by a ‘crust’ of minute granular cells, and armor-plated by
a series of protective spicules. These groups are now recognized «as
the statoblasts, gemmules or winter eggs of the sponge—eggs only in

appearance—in reality the resting spores or protected germs which con-
serve the life of the individual through the cold and storms of winter,
and awake very early in the spring-time into new life, yet a continuance
only of the same existence which was seen a few months before nestling
into this winter’s sleep.

‘“If this is the ordinary course with these organisms there seems no
reason to regard them as serious causes of the pollution of our streams,
though violent freshets before this resting period is reached may tear
them to pieces, and their decay may give a temporary taint to the
water.” (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc., Phila., 1884, pp. 28-30.)

Variation in corals.—The Astrangiacea (Madreporaria) have been stud-
ied by Mr. 8. O. Ridley, and have been found to present striking indi-
vidual variations in characters which have been assumed to be constant
and employed for the definition of generic or supergeneric groups.
Such variations affect the columella, cost, and paliform lobes, and
characters depending on their modifications must be employed with
great caution in the study of the Astrangiacea, ‘* whatever may be the
value for classification of the corresponding parts in the Turbinoliidze
and Oculinide.” (Journ. Linn. Soe. London, Zool., XV11, pp. 395-399, 1

The hydriform stage of Limnicodium.—Notices have been published
in previous issues of these records of progress in zoology, of the re-
markable little fresh-water Medusa, named Limnicodium Sowerbii, in
the Victoria tank of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Regent’s Park, Lon-
don. About four years and a half had elapsed since the discovery of
the mature form before the hydriform stage was discovered, although
assiduous search had been made forit. But, on the occasion of the clear-
ing out of the tank in December, 1884, more than usual thorough search
was instituted, and this was at length rewarded by the finding of the
hydra on some Pontederiw imported from South America several years
ago. Professor Lankester immediately communicated a notice of the
discovery to the London Times and Mr. A. G. Bourne (who first de-
tected it) to Nature (v. 31, p. 107, December 4, 1884). The details were
not published in 1884.

ECHINODERMS.
Origin of Echinoderms.

The development of the germinal layers of Echinoderms has been
studied by Prof. E.Selenka. The cleavage of the egg is said in general .-
terms to be regular, but really “ pseudo-regular” in the Asterioids or

ZOOLOGY. 595

star fishes and Ophiuroids, and “regular with polar differentiation ”
inthe Echinoids. ‘‘ The various modes of cleavage are of no value for the
phylogenetic history of the group; the influence of cenogeny is appar-
ent enough.” For further and explanatory details the memoir of Pro-
fessor Selenka must be consulted, but his conclusions as to the genetic
relations of the group are of suflicient general interest to warrant re-
peating here: ‘ Evidence of the vermian origin of Echinoderms is af-
forded by.the primary mesoderm having the form of two primitive cells
: and by the bilateral symmetry of the larval organs. The division of the
archenteri¢e diverticulum into codomi¢ sac and water-vessels correspond
physiologically to that which the mesodermic sac undergoes in verte-
brates, and to some extentin worms.” (Selenka’s Studien iiber Entwicke-
lungsgeschichte, 1; J. R. M.S. (2), IV, pp. 573-574.)

Reproductive function in Comatula.—Interesting observations have re-
cently been made on the actions and apparent copulation of two indi-
viduals of the Comatula meditteranea by Dr. C. F. Jickeli. The phe-
nomenon resembled that previously noticed in a star-fish (Asterina gib-
bosa) by Dr. H. Ludwig. The arms fell off as a climax, and this appeared |
to confirm Studer’s supposition that the loss of the arms, which often
occurs in star fishes, is connected with the discharge of the sexual pro-
ducts. (Zool. Anzeiger, VU, pp. 444-449; Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. (6),
XIV, pp. 367-368; J. R. M. S. (2), V, pp. 70-71.)

Asterioids.

A deep-sea star-fish.— An interesting star-fish, obtained in Faeroe
Channel, at a depth of 555 fathoms, has been described by Mr. W.
Percy Sladen, under the name Mimaster Tizardi. Its interestarises from
the bonds of union with several quite diverse types, and it is indeed
what used to be ealled a synthetic or comprehensive type. It recalls
in different parts some Asteriide (Solaster), Astropectinide, Goniaster-
idee, and Asterinide. It appears to be nearly related to a genus also
lately described, called Radiaster. (Trans. Royal Soe. Edinb., XXX, pp.

4 Morphology of the Echinoids.—In connection with studies of the Echi-
noids, and especially of the deep-sea species constituting the family
Uy ate .

3 Pourtalesiide, Prof. S. Loven has considered the general characters of

the order. The skeleton is ‘‘a hollow sae inclosing the visceral organs,
and constituted by three distinct systems—ambulacral, perisomatic or
interradial. and calycinal or apical.” On a careful study of this skeleton,
it is found that “its constituent elements are in reality and fundamentally
arranged bilaterally and symmetrically on either side of the mesial
596 . SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884,

plane, indicated by its antero-posterior axis. The archzonomous or old-
fashioned type of the Clypeastride as well as the neonomous or new-
fashioned Spatangide give distinct indications of the bilateral form of
the adult. Though more difficult to detect, this bilaterality obtains
also in the ancient Cidaride, and we have here “ another instance of the
validity of the laws more than once ascertained to underlie evolution,
namely, that structures which are gradually but forcibly worked dut
during the course of geological ages into specialized and highly char-
acteristic features are virtually present within the fabric of the earlier
forms, though dormant, and, as it were, lying in abeyance, and to be
detected only by a close scrutiny.”

In another place, in a discussion of the “ ealycinal system” (which is
defined as consisting of a central ossicle, five costals, and five radiais),
Professor Loven speculates on the evolution of certain forms and parts.
“ Tiarechinus, with its enormous calyx, appears to be the most antique
of Echinoids. While a number of foyms retain a stable relation of the
parts, we find that, when this is disturbed, the anal orifice is the first to
alter its } osiiion; it is followed by the madreporic and generative parts,
but the eyes remain stationary,” &e. :

The manner in which changes may take place are summarized by the
author in the following terms: “ A large and powerful structure, closely
specialized for a function of fundamental importance in the economy of
some remote ancestral type, is inherited in an early state by a descend-
ant in which, from a total change in the mode of life, the very purpose
no longer exists for which it was originally contrived and to which its
parts were adapted. It long retains certain marked features which even
to this day reveal its origin, but, unlike its Crinoidean sister-structire
which, with functions unaltered, multiplies its components, it remains
simple as from the beginning, and superfluous as it has become, grad-
ually declines in intrinsic vigor, and is given up to subserving activities
that had no share in its previous existence. Invaded by contending
organs and yielding to their various tendencies, it has its parts deeply
modified and even to some degree suppressed, and although still true
to its type, and asserting, so to say, its unimpaired independence by
redintegrating its injured frame, it dwindles, nevertheless, from age to
age in every succeeding form and is seen to fall into decay and dismem-
berment and to lose one by one its characteristics, till at last little re-
mains of its original constitution.” (K. Svenska Vet. Akad. Handal., X1x,

Holothurians.

A large Holothurian.—The pharynx of a very large Holothurian,
dredged up in the Sulu Sea, has been described by Prof. H. N. Moseley.
No traces of the rest of the animal were found, but the pharynx exhibits
unusual characters and the calcareous skeleton is remarkably developed.
It is, however, most noteworthy here on account of its large size, being

.2 inches long, thus exceeding in size the corresponding part of any
other species and indicating the existence of a Holothurian larger than
any previously known. (Quart. Journ. Mie. Se., XX1V, pp. 250-261, with

Rotifers.

Classification of Rotifers.—A new classification of the Rotifers has
been proposed by Dr. C. T. Hudson, who, it is understood, has been
for some time engaged in company with Mr. H. P. Gosse on a monograph
of the class. Twelve families are recognized and defined, and these
are segregated under four groups called “ orders” and distinguished
chiefly by the mode of progression. At first sight this might seem to
be an unsafe guide, and it remains to be seen whether it will stand the
test of critical analysis. The ordinal characters and families are as

follows:

“ORDER I, RuIzoTa,” including fixed forms, with the foot attached,

ieee wrinkled, non-retractile, and truncate.
Family 1, Flosculariide.
Family 2, Melicertide.

“ ORDER II, BDELLOIDA,” including Rotifers “that swim and creep like
a leech,” with the ‘foot retractile, jointed, telescopic,” and with
its “ termination furcate.”

Family 3, Philodinide.

“ORDER III, PLoma,” composed of Rotifers “ that only swim.”

Tiloricated.
Family 4, Hydatinide.
Family 5, Synchetide.
Family 6, Notommatide.
Family 7, Triarthride.
Family 8, Asplanchnide.
Loricated.
Family 9, Brachionide.
Family 10, Pterodinide.
Family 11, Euchlanide.

“ ORDER IV, SCIRTOPODA,” embracing * Retifers that swim with their
ciliary wreath,-and skip by means of hollow limbs with internal
locomotor muscles.

Family 12, Pedalionide.”

Platyhelminths.

Free-living Nematoids.—The free-living fresh-water Nematoids of the
Dutch fauna have been investigated by Mr. J. G. de Man, conservator
of the zoological museum of Leyden, and the results published in a spe-

cial monograph. These worms are not easily found; to obtain them, it
is necessary to dig with a knife into moist ground, and especially to seek
for therm about the roots of trees. The fresh-water species are generally
found among the leaves of plants, filaments of alge, or confervee, while
others are met with in the muddy bottoms of ponds and brooks.

A rare human Tapeworm.— At least eight species of tapeworms or
intestinal worms of the family Teniide have been found in the human
body in varying numbers. Of course, the most common are the Tenia
solium and the Tenia mediocanellata, the former being derived ordinarily
from pork, aud the latter from beef. There is one species of the tamily
—the Tenia (Hymenolepis) flavopunctata—that has only once been found
‘in the intestines of man. It was in 1858 that Dr. Weinland discovered
some specimens discharged by a child in Boston. Dr. Leidy recently,
obtained evidences of the same species expelled from a child three
years old by a dose of santonin; the specimens, consisting of a dozen
fragments, appeared to be portions of three worms, which reached a
leneth of from twelve to fifteen inches or more. Unfortunately the
head was lost, but enough remained to identify the species. ‘¢ The
mature eggs are spherical, measure some 0.072 millimeter in diameter,
and contain, fully developed, six hooked embryos.”

Although so rarely met with, it was thought by Dr. Leidy to be
probable that the worm is more common than would be supposed from
the rare instances of its observation, and that it has generally escaped
notice only ‘from its small size, and from the general ignorance of
the distinction, not only of this, but of the ordinary species of tape-
worms.” Nothing is known respecting the life history of the worm or
its other hosts. (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc. Phila., 1884, p. 137.)

Nematelminths.

The origin of the eggs and, sperm of Ascaris. — The direction of the
studies of zoologists nowadays is well illustrated by several very elab-
orate memoirs on the genesis of the eggs and sperm in the common
intestinal thread-worm of the horse (Ascaris megalocephala). One by
Dr. E. Van Beneden on the ovum and its fertilization takes up 375
pages; another, by Van Beneden and Julin, on the spermatogenesis, is
30 pages long; and another, also on the spermatogenesis, by Dr. P.
Hallez, is 3 pages long. The most important of these memoirs is pub-
lished in the Archives de Biologie (Iv, pp. 265-640, with 1 pl.).

Annelids.

An Aierican fresh-water Worm.—In certain rivers of Eastern Amer-
ica, beyond the inflow of salt or brackish water, is found a species of
tube-making chtobranch worm which is closely related to certain sea-
worms, aud which has no known relation in fresh waters elsewhere.

ZOOLOGY. 599

This was first described hy the great American naturalist, Dr. Leidy,
and has recently been the subject of renewed examination by two other
naturalists of Philadelphia, Miss Sara G, Foulke and Mr. Edward Potts.

The tentacular crown, or branchial organ, is considered by Miss
Foulke to be the feature of special interest. :

“According to Dr. Leidy, the tentacles present in an adult are eighteen
in number, besides two larger and longer tentacles situated midway
- between the two lophophores. These larger tentacles are conspicuous
by their bright green color, and are, in fact, external continuations of
the blood- vessels extending lengthwise throughout the body. In shape
these tentacles taper from base to apex; are convex on the outside, but
concave on the side which faces the center of the tentacular crown, so
that a transverse section would present the shape of a crescent. The
two edges thus formed are fringed with cilia. When closely watched,
the green tentacles are seen to pulsate with a rhythmical motion, con-
tracting and expanding longitudinally. The pulsation takes place in
each tentacle alternately.

“At the moment of contraction the tentacle turns slightly on its axis,
outwards and towards the end of the lophophore on that side, at the
same time giving a backward jerk, returning to its former position at
the moment of expansion.

‘* By force of the contraction, the green blood filling the tentacle 1s
forced downward out of the tentacle, and flows along the blood-vessel
on that side of the body. On the expanding of the tentacle, the blood.
instantly returns and suffuses it, and thus the process goes on.”

Mr. Potts’s observations were chiefly devoted to the manner in which
the worm takes its food.

Although the crown of the tentacles imparts to the worms some re-
semblance toa polyzoan, * there is a noticeable difference in the effect pro-
duced by the motion of their cilia. In the latter a powerful incurrent
bears food particles, &c., towards the mouth as a vortex; in the former
case, while the motion draws these particles from without or behind the
circle towards the tentacles, the moment they pass between them they
are influenced by an excurrent bearing them forcibly away. This out-
flowing current is further shown by the fact that excrementitious mat-
ters are drawn rapidly forward through the tube, and ejected at its
anterior extremity.

“ As food, therefore, cannot be sucked into the mouth of the worm, we
find thatit is carriedin. Acceptable particles which touch the tentacles
are grasped by the cilia, and rapidly passed down among them in near
contact with the tentacle into grooves at the base of the above-men-
tioned processes, and thence into the digestive tract.”

Mr. Potts was also fortunate enough to be able to study the worm in
the act of building a tube.

In its earliest stages, the tube ‘‘is a transparent, smooth, and homo-
geneous slime-like excretion, within which the worm may be very clearly
2

600 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

seen, as it works its way forward or drags itself backward by means of
its podal hooks and spines. Later on, the anterior extremity thickens
and becomes more and more opaque, and, as Dr. Leidy has observed,
‘feebly annulated,’ presumably from the adherence of effete particles,
and their compression by the repeated withdrawal of the ciliated tenta-
cles into the mouth of the tube. This methed of prolongation must con-
tinue during the residence of the worm, and in consequence, if supported,
it may sometimes reach a length which is several times that of its inhab-
itant.”. (Proc. Acad. Nat. Se. Phila., 1884, pp. 48, 49, 21, 22.)

Earth-worms in New Zealand.—The extensive modifications which the
boring and concomitant habits of earth-worms effect upon the land,
have become familiar through the work of Darwin on those humble
animals. The surprising results effected by worms on ordinary English
land might be made, according to the estimate of Darwin, by an army
consisting of an average of about 26,886 to the acre. Later, Henson,
from observations conducted in Germany, estimated that in favorable lo-
calities about twice as many as were calculated for by Darwin (53,767)
existed in garden grounds, while in green fields the number would closely
approximate that presented by the great English naturalist. The abun-
dance of a New Zealand species has recently been brought to light, and
Mr. A. T. Urquhart gives, as the result of his investigations, to an acre
of pasture land near Auckland, the large number of 348,480 worms as
found therein; and on his results being challenged, even this number
was greatly increased by subsequent experience. A piece was “laid
out into squares of 120 feet, and a square foot of soil was taken out at
each corner; worms hanging to the side walls of the holes were not
counted, and in one hole, where the return of worms was a blank, the
walls were crowded with worms.” As the result, there was an average
of 18 worms per square foot, or 784,080 worms per acre. Although this
average is in number so striking, when compared with those of Darwin
and Henson, the difference between the actual weight of the worms is
very much less in proportion. ‘According to Henson, his average of
53,767 worms would weigh 356 pounds, while Mr. Urquhart finds that
the average weight of the number found by him came to 612 pounds 9
ounces,” or less than twice the aggregate of the German percentage.
The value of the observations on the New Zealand worms would have
been much enhanced had their relationship been determined. (Trans.
New Zealand Inst., v. 26; Nature, v. 31, p. 23.)

Myzostomids.

The species of Myzostomids.—More than forty years ago Prof. F.S.
Leuckart discovered certain singular organisms parasitic on the-arms
of the crinoid known as Antedon rosacea, which were recognized as two
species of a previously unknown type, ain which received from him the
generic name Myzostoma; one of the species was called UM, glabrum and

ZOOLOGY. GOL

the other M. cirriferum. The relations of this type to other animals
have been involved in doubt, and various discrepant opinions have been
entertained respecting its proper systematic position,

The Myzostomids are minute disk-like animals, sometimes almost per-
fectly round and with markings recalling the marks on the face of a
watch. They are parasitic on Crinoids. The question of their relation-
ships has recently been discussed by Dr. L. von Graff and Dr. J. Beard.

Dr. von Graff thinks that they are related to the Tardigrades, and in-
deed proposes to take that group, as well as the Linguatuloids, from the
Arachnids and combine them with the Myzostomids in a special class,
which he names Stelechopoda.

Dr. Beard had the opportunity to study the embryology of the type
and has been led to consider them as chatopod worms which have be-
come degenerate through parasitism.

The collections of the Challenger expedition of Crinoids were examined
for these parasites, and a large number of new species were thus ob-
tained. Of sixty-eight species detected on the Challenger Crinoids, fifty-
two were new, and one of these was the type of a very peculiar family
named Stelechopodide. (Rep. Voyage Challenger, Zool., v.10; Nature,

5 ARTHROPODS.

Crustaceans.

The stomach of stalk-eyed Crustaceans.—The stomach of the podoph-
thalmous or stalk-eyed Crustaceans and its approaches exhibit some
interesting features, and especially in the armature by the stone-like
‘grinding pieces. The entire subject has been made the theme of
study by M. F. Mocquard, and his investigations have not been limited
to the stomachal armature, but have extended likewise to the muscles
as well as the nerves. In every natural family, according to M. Moe-
quard, the stomachal apparatus is, as a rule, disposed on some special
plan which is typical for each of them. There is, in the first place,
a distinction which is quite trenchant between the brachyurous and
macrurous Crustaceans. In the former, there is a narrow triangular
mesocardiac piece, and elongated horizontal pterocardiac ones, but in
the latter, the mesocardiac piece is very wide and the pterocardiac ones
short and almost vertical. The anomurans show, in this apparatus,
the heterogeneous character of the group, for some are like the macru-
rans and others like the brachyurans. Inthe brachyurans, the gastric
skeleton, with but few exceptions, is quite uniform, but in the macrurans
there is great diversity. The various modifications are of systematic
importance, and in many cases may give essential help in determining
the relations of the various forms. As an instance, onevof the results
reached by M. Moequard may be noticed. Ocypodide are divided into
602 "SCIENTIFIC RECORD. FOR 1884.

two groups, one restricted to the “*Ocypodiacea,” and the other com-
prising the Gelasimi and related genera as well as the Pinnotherians.
Whether such a combination is natural may be questioned, but a re-
newed examination of the detailed structure of the several types may
be demanded as the result of the investigation.

The muscles of the stomach and its armature are described in con-
siderable detail, both in respect to their connections and functions.
The median tooth is advanced forward and the two lateral pieces are
approximated at their anterior extremities. The median tooth is lodged |
in an angle between the lateral, and all together are worked for a see-
ond to grind the food taken in, then there is relaxation, and then again a’
new contraction, and so on. ~The urocardiae piece serves to maintain
the food in the special region. M. Moecquard thinks that these move-
ments are not reflex, but voluntary, as Cuvier had already contended.

The muscles which work the gastric pieces are innervated by nerves
issuing from the stomatogastric. The functions of this are analogous
to those of the sympathetic nerve, and are complex; in one place
it is subservient to sensation and involuntary movements, and it also
regulates voluntary movement as of the labrum and cesophagus ; per-
haps even it has filaments of special sensibility. Several questions of
this kind are left in doubt, and M. Moequard disclaims having ex-
hausted the subject. (Revue Scientifique, t. XXXIV, pp. 204, 205.) :

Peculiarities of deep-sea Crustaceans.—In asummary of the ‘‘Crustacea
of the Albatross dredgings in 1883,” Prof. Sidney I. Smith has enunci-
ated some generalities respecting the characteristics of the deep-sea
crustaceans. A striking characteristic is their red or reddish color.
“A few species are apparently nearly colorless, but the great majority
are some shade of red or orange,” and he had met with ‘‘no evidence
of any other bright color.” A few species “from between 100 and 300
fathoms are conspicuously marked with scarlet or vermilion, but such
brighter markings were not noticed in any species from below 1,000
fathoms. Below this depth, orange red of varying intensity, is ap-
parently the most common color, although in several species the color
was an excessively intense dark crimson.”

The eyes of the abyssal species are even more remarkable than their
colors. In sixteen species especially examined, the eyes were present
in the normal position, and distinctly faceted. In six they were well
developed, but smaller than in average prawns, and of a black color.
In one the eyes were ‘black, but conspicuously smaller than in the
allied shallow-water species.” In another they were ‘black, and of
moderate size”; and in still another they Were “apparently black, or
nearly black, and small.” In one they were “nearly colorless in alco-
holic specimens, and rather larger than usual in the genus, but con-
siderably smaller” than in related species found at less depth. In three
they were “not conspicuously different in size from those of allied shal-

atk

low-water species, and are dark brown.” Professor Smith, from these
data, concludes that, ‘“showever strong may be the arguments of the
physicists against the possibility of any light penetrating the depths
from which these animals come, the color and strength of their eyes, as
compared with blind cave-dwelling species, show conclusively that the
depth beneath 2,000 fathoms of sea-water is very different from that
of ordinary caverns. While it may be possible that this modification
of the darkuess of the ocean abysses is due to phosphorescence of the
animals themselves, it does not seem probable that it is wholly dua to
this cause.”

Another feature characteristic of the deep-sea crustaceans is the large
size of the eggs, which becomes a very marked feature in many of the
deep-water decapods. The largest crustacean eggs known to Professor
Smith are those of “ Parapasiphaésulcati/rons, a slender shrimp, less than
three inches long, taken between 1,000 and 3,000 fathoms. Alcoholic
specimens of these eggs are fully 4 or 5 inillimeters in shorter and longer

- diameter, fully ten times the volume of the eggs of Pasiphaé tarda from

100 to 200 fathoms, more than three hundred and fifty times the volume
of those of a larger shallow-water Palemon, and each one more than a
hundredth of the volume of the largest individual of the species.” Pro-
fessor Smith concludes that “from the peculiar environment of deep-
water species, it seems probable that many of them pass through an
abbreviated metamorphosis within the egg, like many fresh-water and
terrestrial species, and these largecggs are apparently adapted to pro-
ducing young of large size, in an advanced stage of development, and
specially fitted to live under conditions similar to those environing the
adults.”

These conclusions of Professor Smith appear to be highly probable,
and are consonant with the facts observed in fishes. In those forms of
the class which do not take any care of theireggs, the number of eggs
is extremely large, while in those which guard the eggs or young, they
are very much reduced in number but increased in size. (Am. Jour. S..,
(3), Vv. 28, pp. 53-56.)

Arachiids.

An ancient Scorpion.—The oldest of the scorpions until lately known
were inhabitants of the earth in the Carboniferous epoch. Two of the
four described types were the results of American investigations; but
during the past year several examples of a species were obtained from
Upper Silurian rocks in Europe. One specimen was found by Pref. Gus-
tav Lindstrém, in the Swedish island of Gothland. It was in a good con-
dition of preservation and showed the “chitinous brown or yellowish
brown cuticle, very thin, compressed and corrugated by the pressure of
the superposed layers.” The different segments, “ the ceplalothorax,

could all be distinguished. The surface of the back was sculptured by
tubercles and longitudinal keels corresponding with those developed in
recent species. ‘‘One of the stigmata on the right is visible, and clearly
demonstrates that it must have belonged to an air-breathing animal,
and the whole organization indicates that it lived on dry land.” “In
the conformation of this scorpion there is one feature of great impor-
tance, namely, four pairs of thoracic feet, large and pointed, resembling
the feet of the embryos of several other tracheates and animals like the
Campodea. This form of feet no longer exists in the fossil scorpions of
the Carboniferous formation, the appendices belonging to which resem-
ble those found in the scorpions of our own day.” The form in question
was named by Professor Lindstrém Palewophoneus nuncius, and is “ the
most ancient” of all known “ land-animals.”

Some time before the description by Professor Lindstrém of this new
animal was published, Dr. Hunter, of Carluke, obtained a fossil scorpion
also from the Upper Silurian, but in Scottish Lanarkshire, in June, 1883.
It was not, however, until Professor Lindstrém’s description of the
Swedish find appeared that Dr. Hunter recognized the importance of
his own discovery. ‘‘ The rocks from which the Scottish example was ob-
tained are the well-known Upper Silurian beds of Dunside, Logan Water,
Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire, which have yielded such a magnificent
suite of Eurypterids, and supplied a great part of the materials for Dr.
Woodward’s work on the Merostomata. The animal in this specimen
is about an inch and a half long, and lies on its back.on thestone. Its
exposed ventral surface shows almost every external organ that can be
seen in that position, and in this way seems to supplement the evidence
supplied by the Swedish specimen. As inthe northern individual, the
first and second pairs of appendages of the cephalothorax in the Scottish
example are chelate, but the palpi are not quite so robust. The walk-
ing-limbs, though not so dumpy as in P. nuncius, also terminate each in
a single claw-like spike. The arrangement of the sternum shows a large
pentagonal plate (metasternite) against which the wedge-shaped cox
of the fourth pair of walking-limbs abut. The cox of the third pair
bound the pentagonal plate along its upper margins, and meet in the
mid line of the body, where they are firmly united. The coxe of the
first two pairs, as well as the bases of the palpi, are drawn aside from
the center line of the body, showing that, as in recent scorpions, these
alone were concerned in mandueation, or rather the squeezing out of the
juices of the prey. From the circumstance of these being drawn aside,
the medial eyes are seen pressed up through the cuticle of the gullet,
and a fleshy labrum (camerostome) appears between the bases of the
chelicere.”

The characteristics exhibited by these very old scorpions are such as
to separate them quite widely from any of the recent types, and although
evidently belonging to the same order, and thus related to the latter,
they indicate a peculiar family, the Paleophoneide. Doubtless renewed

ZOOLOGY. 605

searching for fossils in the Silurian rocks, and especially for terrestrial
types, will be prosecuted, for such discoveries will serve as very eflicient
stimulants. (Nature, v. 31, pp. 295-298.)

Curious mimicry by a Spider.—A curious case of mimicry by a spider
has been recorded by Mr. H. O. Forbes. The spider in question is found
in Sumatra, and has been named Thomisus decipiens. On June 25, 1885,
in a forest of Sumatra, Mr. Forbes’ attention was excited by his “ eyes
resting on a bird-excreta-marked leaf” On examination it was found
that the appearance was deceptive and had been produced by a spider
which had so closely copied nature that the imitation would readily
deceive the uncritical observer. ‘The spider is in general color white,
spotted here and there with black; on the under side its rather irregu-
larly shaped and prominent abdomen is almost all white—of a pure
chalk white; the angles of the legs are, however, shining jet black.
The spider does not make an ordinary web, but only the thinnest film
on the surface of the leaf. The appearance of the excreta rather
recently left by a bird on a leaf is well known. There is a pure white
deposit in the center, thinning out round the margin, while in the
central mass are dark portions variously disposed ; as the leaf is rarely
horizontal, the more liquid portions run for some distance. Now, this
spider, one might almost imagine to have in its rambles marked and
inwardly discerned what it had observed, and had set about practicing
the wrinkles gained; for it first weaves a small irregular patch of white
web on some prominent leaf, then a narrow streak laid down towards
its sloping margin, ending in a small knob. It then takes its place on
the center of the irregular spot on its back, crosses its black-angled
legs over its thorax and waits. Its pure white abdomen represents the
central mass of the bird’s excreta, the black legs the dark portions of
the slime, while the web above described represents the more watery
marginal part (become dry), even to the run-off portion with the thick-
ened knob (which was not accidental, as it occurred in both cases), like
the residue which semi-fluid substances, ending in a drop, leave on
evaporation. It keeps itself in position on its back by thrusting under
the web below it the spines with which the anterior upper surface of
the legs is furnished.”

The most interesting fact of all, in the opinion of Mr. Forbes, is * not
so much that of the spider having gained, which it ean, of course, have
no consciousness of, by natural selection, the color and form of an ex-
cretum, but that it has acquired the habit of supplementing its own
color and form by an addition in such absolute harmony with that of
which itself is the similitude.”

This species, on being re-examined by the Rey. O. P. Cambridge, the
distinguished arachnologist, was considered to represent a peculiar
genus which was named Ornithoscatoides, from its simulation of a bird’s
excreta, Further, Mr. Cambridge recognized in various collectious
606 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1284. ;

four species of the genus, all of which inhabit India and the neighbor-
ing islands. It seemed to Mr. Cambridge that the whole phenomenon
described is ‘easily explained by the operation of natural selection,
without supposing consciousness in the spider in any part of the pro-
cess. The web on the surface of the leaf is evidently, so far as the
~ spider has any design or consciousness in the matter, spun simply to
secure itself in the proper position to await and seize its prey. The
silk, which by its fineness, whiteness, and close adhesion to the leaf
causes it to resemble the more fluid parts of the exereta, would grad-
ually attain those qualities by natural selection, just as the spider
itself would gradually, and probably part passu, become under the in-
fluence of the same law, more and more like the solid portion.” (Proe.
Zool. Soc. London, 1883, pp. 586-588, pl. 51; 1884, p. 196-203, pd. 15.)

Insects.

The mouth parts of suctorial Insects.—In connection with a memoir on
the systematic position of the Pulicide, Dr. Karl Kiiipelin has discassed
the structure of the mouth parts not only of the Fleas, but of tbe forms
with which they have been associated by other authors, the Diptera
and Hemiptera, and the results are of considerable systematic impor-
tance. It is found that the suctorial insects segregate themselves into
two primary groups. In one, consisting of the Hymenoptera and Lep-
idoptera, the suctorial organs are characterized by the lower parts of
the mouth, maxille and labium, being employed in the formation of a
sucking apparatus, while in another group, represented by the Diptera,
Siphonaptera, and Rhynchota, it is almost exclusively the upper parts,
labium and mandibles, that are implicated in the formation of the true
food canal. The characteristics of the mouth parts of the three orders
of the latter section are thus diagnosed by Dr. Kriipelin:

(1) Diptera.—* Insects with perfect metamorphosis. ° Head free, with
facetted eyes. Sucking-tube formed by a dorsal and a veutral half-
channel (labruin and hypopharynx), more or less inclosed throughout
its length by the labium, which is bent up like a sheath, and furnished
with uniarticulate apical palpi. Mandibles deficient or styletiform,
pushing in between the labrum and hypopharynux. Maxille, when pres-
ent, with palpi. Salivary efferent duct an unpaired closed canal in the
interior of the hypopharynx. A ‘sucking-stomach. Thoracic segments
amalgamated, usually with a pair of wings and a pair of halteres.”

(2) Siphonaptera.—< Insects with perfect metamorphosis. Head at-
tached to the thorax by a wide surface, without facetted eyes. Buccal
organs suctorial. Sucking-tube formed by a dorsal and two lateral
channels (labrum and mandibles), its anterior section only more or less
inclosed laterally by the mulitiarticulate terminal palpi of the labium,
and at the base, besides the latter, by the lamelliform palpigerous max-
ile. Salivary efferent ducts paired, developed as a channel along the
inner surface of the mandibles. No ‘sucking-stomach,” Thoracic seg-

meuts free, Without wings and halteres, with pleural processes upon the

‘last two segments.”

(5) Rynchota.—* Insect usually with imperfect metamorphosis. Head

free or broadly united to the thorax, with or without facetted eyes.

Bueeal organs usually suctorial. Sucking-tube (in the higher groups)
composed of two lateral balf-channels (the mandibles), only in the
anterior portion inclosed by the labium and its apical multiarticulate
palpi, which are united nearly to the apex; atthe base by the labrum.
Maxille styliform, without palpi, applied laterally to the mandibles in
the channel of the labium or the labrum. Salivary efferent duct un-
paired, formed by two half-channels of the mandibles closing together
from the sides. No ‘sucking-stomach. Thoracic segments free or
amalgamated. Four, two, or no wings; no halteres.”

Relations of the Embioid Insects.—In a contribution to our knowledge
of the Embiide, a family of Orthopterous insects, Mr. J. Wood-Mason
has added to our knowledge by describing the various phases of devel-
opment of some /'mbiide, and expresses his opinion as to the relations
of those curious insects. The Lmbiida, he thinks, ‘undoubtedly belong

to the true Orthoptera,” but they are ‘in some respects the lowest

term, and in others the lowest term but one, of a series represented by
the famities Acridioidea, Locustide, Gryllida, and Phasmatide ;” their
“resemblances to the much lower Perlide, which may well be direct de-
scendants of a form closely related to Campodea, are due to their low
position in the division of Orthopterous insects to which they belong,
and do not imply any such close genetic relationship to them as has been
suggested.” (Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1883, pp. 628-634, pl. 66.)

MOLLUSCOIDS.
Polyzoans.

Morphology of Flustra.—The investigation of the marine Bryozoans
has been undertaken by W. J. Vigelius, who proposes to publish a
monograph on the subject. A treatise on the morphology of Flustra
membranaceo-truncata is a precursor of and an introduction to the
work. The Flustre corroborate the dictum that the mode of growth

of the Bryozoan stock is of no value as a means of distinguishing

families, for which it has often been used. The nutrient animal and
the avicularium are alone distinctly differentiated individuals, for the
brood-capsules are simply organs. The nutrient animals may be (1)
budding, found on the marginal zone of the colony ; (2) perfect or re-
productive forms; (3) resting; and (4) decaying. The last two are only
found near the proximal part of the stock, and are much rarer than the
others. ‘The cystid and polypid makeup the complete nutrient animal,
and in the normal condition consist of integument, nutrient apparatus,
and parenchymatous tissue,” No nervous system has been distinctly
608 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

recognized, but it is supposed that “its center is perhaps represented by
the small rounded mass of cells which lies on the anal side of the an-
terior wall of the pharynx.” Spermatoblasts are * derived from the re-
peated sulidivision of the spermatophores, but they do not form rounded
or oval masses of regularly arranged cells placed on a nutrient blasto-
phore”; when they become converted into spermatozoa they are at first
pyriform, and only Jater does the tail arise at the narrow end and become
of some length. The histolysis of the digestive tract was investigated,
and to the brown body is attributed a nutrient function. The cystid and
polypid are parts of a single individual, as is proved by the history of
the process of germination as well as by the organization of the complete
nutrient animal.

The perigastric space is regarded as a true celon, but the polyzoa
are claimed to be pseudo-celia. (Biol. Centralblatt, 111, pp. 705-721;
dhe MS. (2) pL po oc)

Brachiopods.

Anatomy of Argiope.—Several species of Argtope have been dissected
and studied within the last two years by Dr. A. E. Shipley and Dr. A.
Schulgin, the former having worked at Naples on the A. Neapolitana
and A. cuneata, and the latter on the A. Kozalevskii. The brachial
appendages, to which in typical Terebratulids the gills are attached,
are Wanting in Argiope. There is, according to Schulgin, a feebly de-
veloped subcesophageal ganglion overlooked by Shipley, who mistook
the external sensory for the central nervous system.,

The relationships of the Brachiopods are considered by both authors.
Dr. Shipley accepted essentially the views of Professor Gegenbaur. (See
S. I. Report for 1883.) Dr. Schulgin thought it “probable that the
Polyzoa and Brachiopoda arose from a side branch or phylum, which
also gave rise to Annelids,” and they may be ‘grouped together under
the class of Vermoidea.” (Zeitschr. f. Wis. Zool., V. 41, pp. 116-141, 2
pl.; J. &. M.S. (2), Vv. 5, pp. 49, 50.)

MOLLUSKS.
Acephals.

A new Classification of Bivalve Shells —Much dissatisfaction has been
expressed with all the current arrangements of the Acephals, or bivalve
mollusks, and Dr. M. Neumayr has proposed a new one which he
thinks has some advantages compared with the others. The shells are
considered from a paleoutological point of view, and the data derived
from paleontology being co-ordinated with those obtained from a study
of the hinge of the shell, Dr. Neumayr was led to segregate all the
known forms into three orders, all differing from those of his predeces-
sors, and to which he has given new names. The definitions of the
groups, as rendered in English by Dr. von Martens, are as follows:

“Ord.1. PALaoconcH &, or Cryptodonta. Shell thin, without teeth,

or only with feeble indications of them in the hinge; two equal muscu-
lar impressions; pallial line entire. Palaeozoic.

“Ord.2. Desmoponara. Teeth of the hinge none or irregular, con-
nected with the ligamental processes; two equal muscular impressions ;
pallial line sinuated. Pholadomyide, Corbulida, Myide, Anatinida,
Mactride, Paphiide, Glycymerida, (?) Solenide, and all Tubicola.

“Ord.3. TAXODONTA. Teeth of the hinge numerous, not differen-
tiated, in a straight, arcuated or angular row; two equal muscular im-
pressions. Arcidc, Nuculide.

“Ord.4. Hrreroponra. Teeth of the hinge few, distinctly separated
as cardinal and lateral, alternating, exactly filling the pits of the op-
posite valve; two equal muscular impressions. Unionide, Cardiniide,
Astartida, Crassatellide, Megalodontida, Chamide, Tridacnide, Eryci-
nide, Lucinide, Cardiide, Cyrenide, Cyprinide, Veneride, Gnathodon-
tide, Tellinide, Donacide. The Trigoniide will form a distinct sub-
order. . ‘

“Ord. 5. ANISOMYARIA, or Dysodonta. Teeth of the hinge none or
irregular; two very inequal or only one muscular impression; pallial
line entire.

(a) Heteromyaria: Aviculide, Mytilide, Prasinide, Pinnide.

(b) Monomyaria: Pectinide, Spondylide, Anomiide, Ostreide.”

(Zoological Record, 1883, pp. 86 and 87, Aoll.)

Dr. von Martens, certainly a most competent judge, has expressed
the opinion that this classification “has several advantages in com-
parison with hitherto accepted classifications: (1) the distinction of a
limited number of natural types, instead of an artificial separation into
Monomyaria and Dimyaria, or Asiphonida and Siphonida; (2) the union
of the Heteromyaria and the Monomyaria into one common chief di-
vision;” and (3) ‘the constitution of a special chief division for the
Arcidz and Nuculide, as these families offer very peculiar characters
as well in the shells as in the gills and foot.”

The present recorder is unable to appreciate any superiority of the
new arrangement over that based on the muscles, and there are cer-
tainly more exceptions of the contents of the so-called *‘ orders” to their
diagnoses than in the case of the groups defined by the muscles. As
Dr. Paul Fischer has already remarked (Journ. Conch., ¥. 24, p. 121), a
single family (the Unionide) has representatives not only deviating
from the diagnosis of the including “ order” (Heterodonta), but exhibit-
ing characters assigned to two others, Anodonta recalling the Paleo-
conch or Cryptodonta, and Pleiodon the Taxodonta. Undoubtedly
Dr. Neumayr knew of these exceptions and regarded the forms and
questions as derivatives from the normal Heterodonta. But the dif
ferences from the type and assumption of characteristics of others
nevertheless exist. Tor this, if for no other reason, the value of sueh
characters for orders is nullified. There 1s also a want of co-ordination
between the hinge structure and modifications of other parts which

S. Mis. 33-——39
610 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 18384.

casts suspicion on the value of the former. There are likewise many
other failures than those mentioned of constituents of groups to embody
the requisites of the diagnoses of such groups. On the whole, then, we
cannot concede that the new arrangement is superior to those that have
preceded. It is, nevertheless, of some value as an incentive to further

study of the subject, in order to test the value of various propositions. ,

The Eyes of Bivalve Mollusks.—If the edges of the mantle of even our
common bivalve mollusks, such as the oyster, the hard clam, and the
soft clam, are very closely examined, specks may be found which prove
to be rudimentary eyes. These organs have been recently examined by
Dr. Benjamin Sharp, of Philadelphia, who has studied them in the
oyster, the hard clam, the soft clam, the common mussel (Jytiius edulis),
the big clam (Mactra solidissima), and two razor-fishes (Solen ensis and
Solen vagina). The pigmented cells found in these parts are essentially
the same in all. The smallest of the cells were found in the oyster, and
the largest in the hard clam. Experiments. on these forms show their
sensitiveness to light and shadow, and the cells showing the retinal
character described leaves little doubt as to the power of vision, No
nerves could be demonstrated passing direct to these cells, and proba-
bly those distributed to the general epidermis serve in transmitting the
impressions. The visual power is so low that nerves have not yet been
specialized for this purpose.” (Proc. Acad. Nat. Se. Phila., 1884, p. 10).

The Greening of Oysters and its Cause.—There is always a reason or the
appearance of a reason for a given phenomenon engendered by popular
opinion, and one was devised to explain the cause of the green color so
prevalent in the British oysters especially. The reasoning in this case
was very facile.

Oysters are green; copper in oxidization becomes green. Therefore
the green color of oysters is due to the absorption of copper; conse-
qently the bottom of the sea, or the sea itself, is pregnant with copper.
The oysters have a “‘coppery taste,” and thus give proof of the exist-
ence of copper.

Science doubted and suggested explanations, but not until lately has
the question been approached in a severe critical and experimental man-
ner. An old suggestion was then proved to be practically correct. The
most recent and skilled of the inquirers into the cause and origin of the
greening of the oysters are Mr. Puységur, an assistant commissioner of
the navy department of France, and Mr. John A. Ryder, of the United
States Commission of Fish and Fisheries.

Mr. Puységur has recalled the history of conjecture and research on
the cause of the green color of oysters and given the results of his own
investigations.

He tested the popular view that the color was the result of suffusion
with copper. Even a meritorious chemist, Mr. Gaillard, had found cop-

per in oysters. But Mr. Gaillard, from scientific considerations, himself
concluded that this was’ because some process was fraudulently em-
ployed to color the oysters, and that it consisted merely in immersing
them in a solution of a salt of copper, and leaving them in it till they
were saturated by it.

“Mr. Puységur sought by experiment to ascertain whether copper was
absorbable by the mollusk, and found that—

1, “An oyster which is placed in'a bath of sulphate of copper is not
colored at all.”

2. “Death quickly follows when they are plunged into such a mix-
ture.”

He did not deny that chemists may have found copper in oysters, but
his own direct experiments did not verify the absorption of the metal
by the animals. *

Copper, then, being out of the question, he sought to learn what was
the cause. .

Various observations and experiments were instituted, for a detail of
which reference must be made to the original memoir of the author.
His conclusions are thus summarized :

“There remains no longer any doubt as to the fact that the viridityof
oysters is entirely due to the absorption or digestion of the soft parts of
the Navicule held in suspension by the surrounding water; this definite
experience also completely overturns the hypotheses which attribute
it to the influence of the soil, to the mixture of fresh and salt water, to
northeast winds; in a word, all the other conjectural causes to which
this simple phenomenon has been childishly attributed are shown to be
inadequate.

“Tt is evident, moreover, that the coloring matter is directly absorbed
by the mollusks, and that the process takes place inside of the animals.
If, in fact, dissolution of the coloring matter tovk place in sea-water,
the water would be tinged as soon as the diatoms were blanched. Now,
this is not the case. In fresh water, on the contrary, the coloring mat-
ter is immediately dissolved, and as a result the diatoms are blanched.
A single drop of Water placed on a slide containing the diatoms causes
them to lose their color instantly. | Finally, if a piece of filtering paper
is saturated in the fresh water which has been placed on the diatoms,
and it is afterwards dried, it will present absolutely the same color as
the green oysters.

‘““These laboratory observations are, moreover, perfectly in accord
with the phenomena observed by the oyster-culturists. Heavy rains
cause the greenness, of the claires to disappear, and the dry and salt-
Jaden northeast winds, which augment the saturation of the waters, are,

.on the contrary, favorable to the production of the green coating in the

claires.”
Mr. Ryder supplemented Mr. Puységur’s researches by observations
of his own. His investigations convinced him of the correctness of Mr,
612 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

Puységur’s conclusions. He had ascertained that the common Ameri-
can oyster (Ostrea virginica) “is affected by an acquired viridity at cer-
tain times and in certain places in precisely the same way as the com-
mon O. edulis of Europe and the O. angulata of the Tagus,” as he had
been able to learn from fresh material from Liverpool, obtained through
the efforts of Professor Baird. ‘The cause of this peculiar staining of
the soft parts of these animals is, therefore, very probably the same
throughout both the European and the American oyster-growing re-
gions.”

Mr. Ryder further extended his studies to the florula of the water
abeut the oyster beds and to the contents of the oyster’s stomach. He
found the special oyster diatom (Navicula ostrearum) abundant, and also
other diatoms, and has thus summarized his results:

‘Taking a survey of the lower groups of the vegetable world, which
contain bluish-green pigments, and which are at the same time free-
swimming in their habits, so as to place them within reach of the sta-
tionary oyster as food, there is none which actually seems more likely
to be the source of the green tinge here discussed than the Diatomacee.
And as there is no other class of forms so commonly and constantly
met with in the alimentary canals of marine mollusks generally, I think
we might take it for granted, for this reason alone, that they are the
souree of the coloration. In fact, it is rarely that I have met with any
other vegetable organisms in the stomachs of oysters except diatoms,
after having examined hundreds, by the excellent method of first re-
moving the recently-swallowed contents of the gastric cavity with a
pipette thrust into the mouth and through the short gullet. The ‘bill
of fare’ of the animal can then be very deliberately studied under the
microscope after the contents of the pipette have been pressed out upon
and prepared for observation under a compressorium.”

Mr. Ryder also endeavored to ascertain the elementary nature of the
green thus dissolved out of the diatomaceous food of the oyster. His
investigations could not be completed, but were carried far enough to
justifyanopiniop. This was that “thecoloring material in green oysters,
on account of its solubility in water, its instability and color, is prob-
ably allied to phycocyanin, since we know that it is not chlorophyll,
because the latter is insoluble in water.” The spectroscope, however,
gave him ‘entirely negative evidence upon this point.”

Mr. Ryder concludes with the assurance that the belief or fear that
green oysters are injurious or hurtfulis without foundation. (Ann. Rep.
Com. Fish., &e., 1882, pp. 793-804, 1884.)

The assumption of the Spat stage by the Oyster—The ‘ metamorphosis
and the post-larval stages of the development of the oyster” have been
studied and described by Mr. John A. Ryder. His memoir is a long
one and gives details of his methods of investigation and his various
observations. The results have been summarized by himself in the
following terms:

ZOOLOGY. ’ 6da

“1, The mouth in the larval oyster is nearly ventral in position, while
in the adult it opens more nearly in the direction of the hinge or towards
the antero-dorsal region.

“2. Theretractor muscles of the velum probably atrophy at the end of
the larval period; if they are to be regarded as the musculature of the
primitive mantle organ, they are replaced in the spat and adult by the
radiating and marginal pallial muscles.

“3. The intestine of the larva is a simple tubular organ; inthe spat it
has an internal ridge developed on one side, which finally becomes a
pronounced induplicature in the intestine of the adult.

“4, The anterior adductor muscle of the larva is replaced by a per-
manent posterior adductor in the spat and adult. (Huxley.) ©

5, The heart and gills are wanting in the larva; they are developed
as post-larval organs. The gills are at first represented by only two
folds; the outer pair are developed later, and apparently from before,
backwards, or dorso-ventrally.

‘“ 6. The connective tissue of the spat and adult, including the organs
derived therefrom, seems to be almost entirely developed during post-
larval life.

“7, The blastocel is mostly obliterated by the development of the
connective tissues.

“© 8, The liver is represented by a pair of diverticula which grow out
jaterally from the walls of the stomach of the larva; its subsequent
development and subdivision into a vast number of follicles is accom-
plished during post-larval life.

‘9, Sometime after fixation the larval oysterseems to lose thestraight
hinge border of its valves, which then acquire umbones; the valves
retain their symmetry up to the time when the spat shell begins to be
formed, and it is probable that most of the larval characters of the
animal have disappeared when the formation of the spat shell begins;
in other words, the veliger stage is past and is at once replaced by a
structual condition of the soft parts which approximates that observed
in the adult.” (Ann. Rep. Com. Fish., for 1883, pp. 719-791, 1884.)

A remarkable new Type of Mollusks.—All the acephalous mollusks
hitherto known have distinct external valves on each side, although in
some, such as in the ship-worms (Teredinids) and the watering pot
shells (Aspergillids), the valves are extremely reduced; but in a form
recently obtained from California, external valves are not at all ap-
parent. When living, the animal is apparently of the “shape of a small
globose Cyprea [or cowrie] of inflated ovoid form, and being translucent,
jelly-like, dotted above with small rounded papilla, which appear of an
opaque white on the general translucent ground.” When fresh, accord-
ing to the discoverer of the specimens, Mr. C. R. Orcutt, the animal was
“over an inch in length,” but the contraction in alcohol is such that the
specimens, when received by Mr. C. H. Dall, were reduced to “less than
half an inch in length.”

When the wnantle is open, the small valves, become apparent. These

of epidermis, prismatic or pearly layers. , There are no muscular or
pallial impressions, no adductors, hinge, or,teeth.”.. They resemble in
form the exterior of the shell called Gervillia, and have a pure white
color. ‘‘As they lie in the body, they.diverge at a rather wide angle
from the beaks, forward. The embryonic valves are retained like two
tiny bubbles on the umbones.”

The affinities of this new form are even doubtful. The classification —
chiefly in vogue for the bivalve mollusks is based upon the number and
relations of the adductor muscles of the shell, and Mr. Dall remarks
that, if such classification is retained, the new form should be distin-
guished as the representative of a distinct order, which might be called
“Amyaria.” He doubts the propriety of such a separation, however,
but very properly claims that it,is the type of anew family, which. he
calls Chlam ydoconcher, and which would be, generally named, with. the
ordinary family termination, Chlamydoconchide. The species is named.
after its discoverer, Mr, C. R. Oreutt. It is evident, observes Mr. Dall,.
that ‘* the genus does nothing. toward. bridging the gap between the
gastropods and pelecypods [or bivalve mollusks], but is simply a remark-
ably aberrant form of the latter-group, and probably derived from some
form with an external shell. It is able, according to Mr. Orcutt, by
sphincter-like contractions of the mantle, to. produce currents of water
over the gills, which are, probably finally SiN by the anal tube.”
(Science, IV, pp. 50, 51.)

Gastropods.

Lhe Operculum of Gastropods.—The development of the operculum of
the Gastropods has been studied by F. Houssay on examples of Litiorina,
Murex, and Purpura. ‘The foot alone is implicated in the formatién of.
the operculum, but “only a small, very clearly defined portion of it.”
Quite close to the margin of the operctilum which adjoius the columella
when the length is restric/ed, a small transverse fissure was found which

ZOOLOGY. 615

penetrated about a millimeter into the thickness of the columellar muscle
and which oceupies the whole length of the foot. ‘The walls of this pedal
fissure are lined with a peculiar epithelium, folded, or rather goffered,
so as to somewhat resemble the polypary of a Mzandrina.” Then it has
avery delicate and very flexible transparent lamella, which can be taken
out with a fine needle, and which afterremaining some time in the airdries
and acquires a horny appearance. It is found that “the epithelial cells
of the fissure excrete a structureless material of a yellowish color and
strongly refractive, which, by agglomeration, constitutes the hyaline
lamella, The latter issues from the pedal fissure and adds itself to the
old operculum.”

‘The newly-formed parts apply themselves to the epithelium situated
between the fissure and the parts of the operculum which are already
fixed. At this point the epithelial cells are but feebly adherent to each
other, and only by their basal part, a remarkable exception among epi-
thelia. From this it results that the still plastic opereular material in-
vests these cells, and even diffuses itself somewhat among the elements
of the subjacent tissues (muscular fibers and connective cells). It is
thus that by suecessive appositions of new parts issuing from the pedal
_ fissure the striz are formed, of which only the most salient are visible to

the naked eye or the lens.”

‘“‘On the other surface of the operculum we must distinguish two re-
gions, the surface of insertion of the columellar muscle, and the free
internal surface. It is very easy to see that the free internal surface
and the outer surface of the operculum have not the same constitution.
The inner surface is covered with a homogeneous layer which forms, as
it were, a varnish without any striz perceptible to the eye. This coat-
ing may even be so thick that we cannot see through it the striz of the
other surface. In other cases it is delicate enough not to hide them.
This difference of constitution arises from a difference of origin. In
front of the surface of insertion the metapodium forms an interior ex-
pansion or lip, which, during the life of the animal, is constantly applied
against the inner unattached part of the operculum. The epithelial
cells of this anterior lip produce the varnish.

“Jt still remains to ascertain why the opercular material is rolled into
aspiral. To elucidate this point we must study the muscular impression.
As the operculum grows, the surface of insertion of the operculum is dis
placed with aslight movement of rotation, since during thesame time the
shell grows in a spiral. The muscle attaches itself to the newly formed
parts, abandoning the old parts on the side of the parietalmargin. These
stages of the columellar muscle are marked: by strie independent of
those of the superior surface. We observe them when preparing an
operculum after removing all traces of muscle. By studying these lines
we can even understand why there are opereula of which the form
always remains the same, while there are others of which the form
varies with the age of the animal. ‘The latter are said to have a nucleus
616 SCIENTIFIC. RECORD FOR 1884.

of formation. The posterior secreting portion of the foot always retains
the same form in the first case, whereas in the second we see it from
nearly circular become almost straight.” (Comptes Rendus Acad. Sei.,
1884, Jan. 28, p. 236; Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. (5), x1, pp. 304-306; Arch.
Zool, Hxpér. et Gén. (2), IV, pp, 869, 870; Rev. Sci., XXX1v, pp. 343, 344;
J. Kh. M.S. (2), IV, pp. 869, 870.)

Cephalopods.

Development of the Gills in Cephalopods.—-The development of the gills
in Cephalopods has, until recently, been but little, if at all, known. The
subject was investigated in 1884 by M. L. Joubin. It seems from
his investigations that “the brancbiz of the embryo make their appear-
ance at the beginning of the development in the form of two small buds,
situated symmetrically with relation to the antero-posterior plane upon
the middle of what will eventually become the posterior wall of the
pallial cavity. The bud, produced by a pushing force of the epithelial
layer by the cells of the subjacent layer, soon elongates and ferms a
small, well-differentiated eminence, rounded at the apex and attached
by a broad base.” No vibratile cilia, such as line the pallial cavity,
were detected. ‘The bud afterwards flattens so as to present two sur-
faces: a posterior one, applied against the visceral mass, and an anterior
one, which is subsequently covered by the mantle which bounds the re.
spiratory cavity superiorly.”

Upon this bittle lamina ‘‘a first horizontal fold appears towards the
middle, then a second nearer to the point, then a third still nearer the
free extremity, and so on. These folds form depressions upon one of
the surfaces corresponding with elevations upon the other surface; the
branchial bud has, therefore, become an undulated lamina; gradually
other folds appear, always toward the point, while the whole organ at
the same time increases in dimensions.”

Of the vessels which form the branchia, “the one which conveys the
blood to it appears early at the commencement of the formation of the
laminz; it occupies nearly the center of the organ, and is comprised
within the base of the laminz and the gland of the branchia, which is
also distinctly marked at this period. The efferent vessel is formed
upon the crest of the branchia and on the outer border of the lamina;
it is undulated like the parts which bear it, and issues from the branchia
at the base, to be continued by the auricle of the heart.” (Comptes Ren-
dus Acad. Sci., 1883, Nov. 12, p. 1076; Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. (5), X01,
pp. 67-69.)

PROTOCLORDATES.

Tunicates.

Development of Salpa.—Much has been written about the development
and morphology of Salpa, but some obscurity still hangs over the sub-
ject. The group has been investigated recently by Prof. W. Salensky,

Sere

ZOOLOGY. 617

who has examined four species—S. punctata, S. fusiformis, S. bicaudata,
and S. democratica. The sum of his researches has been thus recorded
in the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society: **The developmental
process of Salpa is so peculiar that it is very difficult to compare it
with other known types of development; the fact that the follicular
cells take a share in the production of the embryo (the process of de-
velopment being therefore both sexual and asexual) is not, however,
confined to this group. Lankester has described a very similar state of
things in Cephalopoda, where the inner capsular membrane, the follicle
itself, grows into the ovum and partly forms the nutritive yolk; recent
researches also into the Vertebrata tend to show that the yolk is partly
from the cells of the follicle. Salpa bicaudata appears to represent the
most simple development of all the species, while further complications,
such as the formation of a part of the embryo by cells of the oviduct,
tend to remove other Salpe further from the normal mode of develop-
ment exhibited in the animal kingdom.” (Jittheil. Zool. Stat. Neapel, Iv,
pp. 327-102, 6 pl.; J. R. MW. S. (2), Iv, pp. 368, 369.)

VERTEBRATES.
Fish-like vertebrates

British Fishes.—The work of Dr. Francis Day, on ‘The Fishes of Great
Britain and Ireland,” has been lately completed, and in it we have an
excellent résumé of what is known of the finny inhabitants of the home
empire. The system and nomenclature as well as definitions of Dr.
Giiuther are essentially adapted for the generic and supergeneric groups,
and a full synonymy and description are given of each species; then
follows information respecting the “names,” “habits,” * means of cap-
ture,” “baits,” “breeding,” “life history,” “diseases,” “uses,” “as
food,” and “ habitat” of the species if known or so far as known to the
author.

It may be of interest to compare the constitution of the British fauna
with that of a limited region of Eastern America, and in the following
tables the comparative data are given. The data in the work of Day
for the British fishes, and Goode and Bean for the American, as given
in “A List of the Fishes of Essex County, including those of Massachu-
setts Bay,” are accepted for the species. To bring the information toa
common denominator, the most recent systematic results of the Ameri-
can ichthyologists (who are all in essential accord in this respect) are
applied to the superspecific groups. The data are given (under family
names adopted by American authors) as to (a) the number of species
recorded from (1) Great Britain and (2) Massachusetts Bay, &c., (b) the
number of genera represented in (3) Great Britain and (4) Massachu-
setts, and (c) the (5) species and (6) genera shared in common by Great
Britain and Massachusetts. The Massachusetts region is limited pur-
posely in the tables to the waters north of Cape Cod, as the exhibit
thus brings out best what are the features common to the two. The
Cape |

families represented south of the cape are, however, added and distin-.
guished by italics (but without detailed information) to, indicate the.
peculiarities of the western side of the Atlantic. The Bassalian forms,
are omitted unless they have actually been caught near the shore. In;
asmuch as very deep water occurs much nearer the British coast than
the New England, considerably more deep-sea fishes have been found,
on the British Bles than along the American.

In the following tables those families whose names are . bracketed in
one set in the margin are included in a single family by Dr. Day, under
the name indicated by the letter (D); the families here adopted are
as a rule more restricted than Dr. Day’s. In one case, however, as will
appear by one of the notes, the constituents of one family are scattered
among three by Dr. Day, who has followed Dr. Giinther.

Some interesting and curious deductions flow from a comparison of
the data embodied in these tables.

The fresh-water fishes are mostly very different in the two regions.
The British isles are not distinct from the neighboring continent, so far
as its fishes are concerned, and almost all are conspecific with conti-
nental forms, the only difference being that there are fewer species and
an absence of some characteristic European types. Massachusetts and
its neighbors exhibit a similar relation to the rest of the American con-
tinent, in the paucity of species as well as deficiency of peculiar Ameri-
can types, and this feature is so well marked that more than a quarter
of a century ago Professor Agassiz denominated the region the “ Zoolog-
ical island of New England.” Both regions, however, so far as the fau-
nas go, are true to their continents. Notwithstanding the so much
talked of small size of the British area, the fishes of the same diversiform
families are on the whole larger than those of America, or, in more
exact terms, there is a lack of the very small species. The special
British Cyprinids and Percids, for example, are larger than those of
New England, and none are as small as the peculiar American types,
such as the little minnows, shiners, and darters. (It may be remarked
that for size, the suckers take the place of the large European Qypri-
622 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884,

nids.) The generic types common to the two regions are, however, about
equally developed, such as the lampreys, eels, salmonids, pike, yellow
perches, millers-thumbs, burbot, and sticklebacks. On one hand the
family of Loaches is the only one wanting in America, although there is
no grayling in New England; on the other, the suckers, catfishes, mum-
michogs or Cyprinodontids, and sunfishes of New England are wanting
in Britain. The common American chart or brook-trout is larger than
the British species and takes the place in New England of the true trout
of England, a type deficient from the Eastern American fauna. The
peculiar American species of the pike family are smaller* than the com-
mon pike common to the two countries,.and which alone is a native of
Britain, and indeed of Europe generally.

There is another feature of interest. It is that, with the exception of
the sticklebacks, none of the British fresh-water fishes take special care
of their eggs or young, while, of the Amerigan types, the catfishes and
sunfishes are noted for their care of both the eggs and young.

If now we compare the salt-water species, we find that Britain has a
lancelet, a six-gilled shark, an Oxynotid, three Scylliorhinids, many more
rays, a Murray (Murenid), a scabbard-fish (Lepidopodid), a John Dory
(Zenid), a boar-fish (Caproid), very many more Sparids, seven Labrids
to New England’s two; many more Triglids, and all of a special genus;
two Callionymids, nine gobies, four true blennies, and more Gadids,
flatfishes, and soles, a Centriscid, and more pipefishes, types wanting
or more poorly represented in New England.

To somewhat balance all these absentees, New England has an Odon-
taspidid, several Cyprinodontids, more Scizenids, more Labracids, a He-
mitripterid, a Dactylopterid, three Stichaids, a Cryptacanthodid, a Fis-
tulariid, an Antennariid, and a Maltheid—types entirely unknown or less
represented in England.

In. this comparison no account has been taken of deep-sea types
(which, on account of the proximity of deep water, are more numerous
near the British shores) or those that are mere wanderers to either
shore. On the other hand, types that are represented in the waters of
Massachusetts, though they may not have been credited to Massachu-
setts Bay, have been kept in view.

The oldest known fish.

Until lately the oldest known fishes had been obtained from the
English Ludlow beds, which are near the top of the Upper Silurian,
and none had been found in America lower than the Devonian. In the
past year, however, remains were found which indicate the existence
of what have been supposed to be fishes in’still lower beds of the Silu-
rian, in Pennsylvania. They were discovered by Prof. i. W. Claypole

“One of the American pikes (Zsox nobilior), but not occurring in Massachusetts,
is larger than the European, and the largest and finest of the family.

while engaged ‘on work on the paleontology of Pennsylvania.” First,
he fouvd.in what, he’calls the ‘ Bloomfield sandstone,” which “lies at
the top of the variegated shale or marl, the middle portion of the great
mass of the Onondaga,” certain remains analogous to those occurring
in the Ludlow beds. The Ludlow beds are believed to have their
equivalents in America in the Lower Helderberg, and inasmuch as the
Onondaga is below the Helderberg, the time in which the animals lived
that have left their remains in the Bloomfield sandstone must be still
further back. The remains in question indicated a species of the genus
Onchus and two of a genus related to Scaphaspis of the Pterichthyida,
but different to such an extent as to have impelled Professor Claypole
to refer them to a new genus called Palwaspis.

Next, “a thousand feet lower down, in the middle of the red shale,”
Professor Claypole found in a thin bed comminuted fish scales or shields
resembling in many points those of Palwaspis.

Further, ‘five hundred feet lower still, below beds indisputably of
Clinton age,” in the ‘well-known iron sandstone,” is ‘‘a thin layer
thickly charged with comminuted scales in much better condition than
those in the red shale. With these occurs a spine somewhat like those
from the Bloomfield sandstone,” which Professor Claypole considered
to indicate a new Onchus—the O. clintoni.

Professor Claypole asserts that “it is evident that in these fossils we
have the most ancient relics of vertebrate life yet known from any part
of the world.”

The Professor concludes that, “‘in thus carrying down the remains of
fish almost to the base of the Upper Silurian rocks, it becomes evident
that we must seek in some part of our Cambro-Silurian series to find
yet earlier forms. It is not likely that these are the first that existed.
Lower beds must be searched.” (Am. Nat., v. 18, pp. 1222-1226.)

Leptocardians.

Number of Branchiostomids.—The lowest type, by all odds, of true
Vertebrates is the genus LBranchiostoma, a representative at the same
time of a peculiar family, order, and class. The first example obtained
was described over a century ago by the celebrated Pallas as a Limax,
or slug. Since then, several species have been proposed on differences
in the number of transverse impressions representing the limits of what
are now called myocommas. ‘These, however, were all ignored by Dr.
Giinther, in 1870, and the species were all “lumped” together under
Branchiostoma lanceolatum. **The recent discovery of a second undoubt-
edly distinct species of Leptocardian on the coast of Australia {pi-
gonichthys cultellus|, as well as the acquisition of several well-preserved
examples,” induced Dr. Giinther “ to re-examine all the specimens in the
British Museum,” and he* convinced” himself that the view formerly held
by him ‘is incorrect, and that Sundevall was quite right in drawing atten.
624 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

-

tion to the number of myocommas as an excellent taxonomic character.”
Dr. Giinther was thus led to recognize six species of Branchiostoma:
(1) B. elongatum, Peru; (2) B. bassanum, Bass Straits; (3) B. Belcheri,
Borneo; (4) B. caribeum, West Indies; (5) B. lanceolatum, Europe; (6)
B.[Epigonichthys] cultellus. The B.bassanum was new. (ep. Zool. Coll.

Alert, pp. 31-33.)
Selachians.

An Hel-like Shark.—Perhaps the most interesting discovery of the past
year among new vertebrate forms is a species of shark made known by
Mr. Samuel Garman, of Cambridge, under the name of Chlamydoselachus
anguineus. All the previously known sharks are pretty uniform in hav-
ing the body of a more or less fusiform contour and comparatively stoat;
any differences in contraction or elongation are comparatively slight.
The new form, however, differs widely from all other described species,
and is so elongated as to suggest the snake- or eel-like form, which has
struck Mr. Garman and induced him to give to it the name anguineus or
snake-like. In other respects, it has more characteristics in common
with the Notidanids or Hexanehids (that is, the family represented by
the gray shark of Europe) than with any other. <As in the Notidanids,
there is only one dorsal fin, and in the new shark this is reduced in-size
and far behind, opposite the anal; the Jatter is much larger than the
dorsal and is elongated; the ventral fins are also behind the middle of the
length and reach to the anal. ‘The head is broad, slightly convex on
the crown, and has a look about it,” says Mr. Garman, “that reminds
one of some of the venomous snakes.” The mouth opens at the ante-
rior extremity, and is not overhung by the snout, as in most sharks.
The gape is very wide, lateral, and extends far behind the eyes. The
nostrils are also unlike those of ordinary sharks in being lateral. As
in the Notidanids, the branchial apertures are in increased number (six),
but those in front are very wide, and are quite characteristic in that
“the frill or flap covering the first opening is free across the isthmus,
as in [some] fishes, and hangs down about an inch.” The teeth are also
very peculiar. As in other sharks, they are arranged in rows across
the jaws. In detail, “they are all alike; each tooth has three slender,
eurved, inward-directed cusps, and a broad base, which extends back
in a pair of points under the next tooth, thereby securing firmness and
preventing reversion. In the twenty-eight rows of the upper jaws and
twenty-seven of the lower there are three times as many rows of the
fangs or cusps.”

Mr. Garman, in considering the relations of this remarkable animal,
thought that most resemblance was to be found in the dentition to the
teeth of Cladodus, of the Devonian, ** but the cusps were erect instead
of reclining, and the enamel was grooved or plicate instead of smooth.”
He was impressed by a study of the animal “ with the idea that, away
back in times when selachia and fishes were more alike, he would

ae
"ae

OS PEG IIR TE

have a better chance to trace the affinities.” Myr. Garman was finally
inclined to consider the species as the type, not only of a new genus
and family but even of ‘a new order, to which the name Selachoph-
ichthyoidi might be given, and which stands nearer the true fishes
than do the sharks proper.”

The new shark was 5 feet long and less than 4 inches in greatest
diameter. It was obtained in Japan.

Next, Professor Cope, soon afterwards, in a communication to Science,
expressed the opinion that the newly described shark was congenerie
with the Diplodus or Didymodus of the Devonian epoch, and that there-
fore it was the oldest living type of Vertebrata.

In a subsequent number of Science, Professor Gill commented upon
the views already expressed and had to differ from both gentlemen.
He was disposed to agree with Mr. Garman in the conclusion that
Chlamydoselachus anguineus approached nearer the true fishes than
do the sharks proper, not because it appeared to be in the line of des-
cent between the two, but because it was nearer the primitive line
from which both types have diverged. It is doubtful, however, whether
it is a more primitive type than the Notidanids. As to its relations to
extinct types, however, he dissented from both Mr. Garman and Pro-
fessor Cope, and doubted whether it was closely related to any known
extinct forms, urging that both of the forms to which it had been ap-
proximated by Messrs. Garman and Cope were very widely separate.
The Cladodus: and its relatives were at least subordinally distinct, and
Diplodus or Didymodus (which, he shawed, should be called Plewracan-
thus) appeared to have had no relations whatever to it, and apparently
did not belong to the same order or even subclass. On the whole
Chlamydoselachus appeared to him to be quite clearly related to the
Notidanids, but in a revised natural system of the Squali, the two
families might be considered as representatives (and the only known
representatives) of distinct suborders—the Notidanids of the suborder
Opistharthri, and the Chlamydoselachids of the suborder Pternodonta
or Selachophichthyoidei. The two seem to be closely related, however.

Telcostomes or fishes.

The lateral line of Fishes.—The so-called lateral line of fishes and its
extension on the head bas been a subject of many investigations. One of
the latest published on the subject is by M. Paul De Séde, who has paid
special attention to the histology and development thereof. We cannot
enter upon the anatomical details and must remain content to briefly
consider the results of some of the experiments made by the author.
He had undertaken the vivisection of certain fishes, subjecting them to
anesthesia and then experimented upon them in several ways. He
chiefly employed chloroform, and placed the fish in a glass jar three-

S, Mis. 33——40 |
626 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

fourths filled with water and closed by a glass cover. In the center of
the jar, a small bottle filled with chloroform had been previously at-
tached so that it should not be thrown out of place. The neck of this
bottle extended about a centimeter above the level of the water and
allowed the vapor of the chloroform to circulate freely. The effect of
the chloroform on the fish was manifested at first by violent attempts
to escape; then the animal swam on one side, made some turns round
the jar, and, at the end of several minutes, fell to the bottom of the
jar completely anestheticized. If in this condition it is allowed to re-
main three to four minutes, the cover being taken oft, it dies and floats
belly upwards to the surface; consequently, it should be taken out as
soon as it falls to the bottom of the jar and is motionless.

Water charged with carbonic acid may be substituted for the chloro-
form. It has been suggested, as a result of .the experiment of Brown-
Séquaid, that carbonic acid brought directly in contact with mucous
surfaces possesses powerful anesthetic properties. Thus anezesthet-

_icized, the subjects can easily stand a resection of the lateral nerve for
a length of one or two centimeters according to size. The lateral nerve
was cut out and the animal did not manifest pain in any manner. ~ But
the operation must be performed with delicacy and quickness, and this
result was not obtained without numerous attempts. The fishes oper-
ated upon, while living, were placed in a large bottle where they were
allowed to rest. They exhibited at first the characteristic sluggishness
which follows the absorption of chloroform, and it was manifested in
various incoherent movements. When they had entirely recovered from
the effects of their being subjected to the chloroform, their movements
were watched with interest. The fishes operated upon, it was observed,
swam with great slowness and hesitancy in the jar, evidently feel-
ing their way; while those in which the lateral line was perfect passed

through the water and between obstacles with little or no diminution of

speed. It seemed evident to M. De Séde, as a result of his experiments,
that the lateral line has a tactual or sensitive function and supple-
ments or supplies the place of vision. The lateral line takes cogni-
zance of the currents and other movements of the water and the fish
knows its own swiftness and how to regulate it. Moving in an ele-
ment agitated without cessation, it perceives the least displacement;
living in the midst of enemies which surround it on all sides it becomes
conscions of their approach by the slightest movements of the water.
The lateral line is, then, the result of an adaptation to aquatic life, an
adaptation which ceases with this mode of existence and disappears,

as we know is the case in the amphibians, when the animals become.

adult and leave the water. The organs of general sensibility, these
tactual corpuscles, are grouped in a more delicate apparatus, affecting
special dispositions absolutely different from those which characterize
the other organs of the definite senses. It may be said, therefore, that
in the lateral line a sixth sense in the full meaning of the word is de-

veloped. In other words, the lateral line is a tactual organ specialized
to the same extent as those organs in certain deep-sea fishes which
give light. The anatomical characteristics of the lateral line are very
diversified, but in all cases there is a similar adaptation for the per-
ception of sensations, and the apparatus is more or less protected by
the integuments; it is for the purpose of communicating with the sen-
sorium through the intervention of the lateral nerve. (Revue Scien-
tifique, t. XXXIV, pp. 467-470.)

Hermaphroditism of Fishes.—-1t has long been known that hermaphro-
ditism occurs in a number of fishes, and in some of them it is so general
as to almost constitute the normal form. The subject has lately been
reinvestigated by Max Weber. He has re-examined especially the well-
known cases of hermaphroditism of the sea perches of the Mediterra-
nean, of the genus Serranus, and also of certain Sparids. The greatest
number of species in which hermaphroditism is manifested are Physo-
clists or Acanthopterygians ; only three phystomous fishes (the carp, the
herring, and the pike) have yielded hermaphrodites. Besides the three
species of Serranus and one of Sparus, hermaphroditism has been de-
tected more or less frequently in various species related to Sparus. The
family of Sparids, indeed, furnishes no less than six species subject to
hermaphroditism. These are (1) Sparus aurata, (2) Pagellus mormy-
rus, (3) Sargus annularis, (4) Sargus Salviani, (5) Charax puntazzo, and
(6) Box salpa.

In the family of Scombrids, hermaphroditfsm has been observed in the
common mackerel (Scomber scombrus); in the Percids, in the river perch;
and in the Labrids in Labrus mixtus. One species of Ophidiids, no less
than three species of the family of Gadids, and one of the Soleids have
also yielded hermaphroditic individuals: of the Ophidiids, the Ophidium
barbatum; of the Gadids, the common cod, the whiting, and the fresh-
water burbot or cusk; and of the Soleids the common sole. It is espe-
cially the characteristics of hermaphroditism in the perch and codfish
that Mr. Weber has studied, and he has sought to learn the causation
of the phenomenon. The result, he contends, arises from the primordial
sexual indifference of the materials out of which are, in time, developed
the genital glands. At the moment of sexual specialization, a portion
of the elements of which these embryonic materials. are constituted
develop toward the male sex, while the other portion undergoes succes-
sive modifications which tend to the female sex, and from these diverg-
ing tendencies arises without doubt the appearance of true hermaphro-
ditism. {tis recalled that hermaphroditism is most common in fishes
and becomes rarer in the higher vertebrates in which sexual differenti-
ation has become more decided.

The species studied by Dr. Weber are all common European fishes.
Hermaphrodites have likewise been found in extra- European fishes, es-
pecially among the Serranine and the Lutjanine. (Nederland. Tijdschr,
Dierkunde, 1, p. 84; Revue Scientifique, t. XXXIV, pp. 376, 377.)

Serrated Throat Appendages of Amia.—The so-called “mud-fish” or
“lawyer” (Amia calva) of our Western and Southern lakes and rivers, is
especially interesting to the morphologist on account of the peculiarities
of structure and the habits coincident therewith which it exhibits, and
also, more especially, from the fact of its being intermediate between
the old-fashioned and the new-fashioned fishes. One of the peculiari-
ties of this fish is the existence of ‘serrated appendages” or “ flagella”
beneath the throat, which are attached by their bases to the lateral as-
pect of the sterno-hyoid muscles. Experiments have been made, uuder
the direction of Prof. R. Ramsey Wright, of University College, Toronto,
to elucidate the physiology of these appendages. His specimens of
Amia, “after being in captivity for some time, became very sluggish,
and hardly any movements of respiration could be detected. After the
fish had been removed for a little out of the water, however, and then
returned to it, the movements were sufficiently active to disclose the fol-
lowing facts:

‘ During the enlargement and filling of the cavity of the mouth, the
posterior flexible (and muscular) border of the gill-opening is tightly
applied to the soft parts behind the gill-opening. When the mouth-cav-
ity is quite full, the mouth closes, the muscular border of the gill-cover
releases its sucker-tike hold of the soft parts, and the water is driven
out by the contraction of the walls of the mouth-cavity.” (Science, Vv.
4, p. 511.)

Development of the common American Catfish.—Mr. John A. Ryder
has published the results of an investigation into the embryology of
a common American catfish, the Amiurus albidus. The eggs of this
species are laid in a large depressed mass, and are adherent together
and to the object upon which they are laid. They are about one-eighth
inch in diameter and hatch in about six days, when the water is of the
temperature usually prevalent during the breeding season of the species,
which, about Washington, isin July. The male, after the eggs are laid,
faithfully guards the eggs, hovering over them, and fanning the mass
of ova with his lower fins, apparently for the purpose of forcing water
through them.

Each egg is covered by two envelopes, an inner true zona radiata
and an outer elastic adhesive lamina, which is raised up from the inner
one upon a series of columns consisting of the elastic substance. It
thus results that a space is formed between the inner and outer envel-
opes of the egg, which is filled with water. The outer elastic envelope
permits the male to make comparatively violent movements while re-
newing the water over the ova without detaching them from one
another or from the objects to which they are affixed. Indeed, the elas-
ticity of this outer membrane is surprisingly extensive in the living ova.

On the second day the barbels appear in blunt processes, thus early
defining the order to which the embryos appertain, They arise at the

ZOOLOGY. 629

angles of the mouth; then the chin and the nasal barbels make their
appearance. All but the nasal barbels, upon examination with the
microtome, are found to contain a cartilaginous supporting axis.

The yelk is very coarsely granular and is composed of spheroidal
bodies which are more or less misshapen by mutual pressure. At the
end of about two weeks the yelk bag becomes outwardly imperceptible.
The peculiarly wide or extended cerebellum of these fishes begins to be
apparent at a very early stage in the embryo. The segmentation is
meroblastic, a very sharply defined germinal disk being formed. The
way in which the embryos swing their tails back and forth within the
egg on the second and third days reminds one forcibly of this habit in °
an angry cat, and is worthy of note on account of the name of this
group, viz, the Catfishes.

The young, after hatching, cluster together and seem to follow the
male parent. When feeding upon chopped meat the young were fre-
quently taken into the mouth of the male parent, who would, however,
always reject his progeny alive and unharmed from his mouth before
swallowing, showing that he was able to discriminate between his young
and his food. (Bull. U. S. Fish Com., 11, pp. 225-230.)

The Saccopharyngide relatives of the Eurypharyngide.—In the search
for relations of the strange Eurypharyngide, Messrs. Gill and Ryder
became convinced that the genus Saccopharynx, proposed in 1824 by
Mitchill, and the Ophiognathus, named three years later by Harwood
(1827), were closely related, and consequently the family embracing the
two has been appreximated to the Eurypharyngide as a related type.
Some modifications were also found to be necessary in the diagnosis of
the ordinal group. The Lyomeri are now distinguishable as Teleost
fishes with five branchial arches, none of which are modified as branehi-
ostegal or pharyngeal, far behind the skull; an imperfectly ossified
cranium, deficient especially in nasal and vomerine elements, articulat-
ing with the first vertebra by a basiocipital condyle alone; with only
two cephalic arches, both freely movable, (1) an anterior dentigerous
one (the supramaxillary) and (2) the suspensorial, consisting of only
hyomandibular and quadrate bones; without opercular elements; with-
out palatine or pterygoid bones; with the scapular arch imperfect, lim-
ited to a simple cartilaginous piece, remote from the skull; with the rays
‘of the pectorals sessile directly upon them, and with separately ossified
but imperfect vertebrae.

A peculiar type of Fishes.—Over 100 years ago (in 1781) a very curious
fish was described by the German naturalist, Hermann, under the name
Sternoptyx, but the old naturalist was deceived by appearances and
quite misunderstood the structure and relation of the species. Al-
though its anatomy has been worked at, its peculiarities have not been
appreciated. Attracted by certain appearances, Professor Gill ex-
amined the skeleton and found that it exhibited differences of such a
630 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

character as to isolate it from most other fishes. In the typical fishes,
generally, the scapular arch is connected with the cranium directly
through the intervention of the supra-scapula or post-temporal bones
which abut upon the paroccipital bone. In Sternoptyx the scapular
arch, however, has no connection whatever with the sides of the cra-
nium, but the post-temporal or its homologue advances upwards and
meets its fellow of the opposite side and the two abut upon the middle
of the cranium or supraoccipital bone behind and at the nape. Con-
sequently the genus is not only the type of the family Sternoptychida,
but has been taken as the type of a group which may be considered as
“of ordinal value and to which the name Iniomi has been given. Tiis
order includes not only the Sternoptychids, but, according to the obser-
vations of Mr. John A. Ryder, also the Chauliodontide; and quite likely
some other fishes which .have been confounded with the Scopelidz and
Stomiatidz# may also belong to it.

The Sternoptychids, it may be added, exhibit such differences among
themselves asapparently to necessitate a recognition of twosub-families,
the Sternoptychine and Argyropelecine.

The American Mullets—The true mullets or those constituting the
family Mugilide, are fishes which are gregarious, moving together in
large schools. They havea peculiarly modified and complex pharyngeal
apparatus, by means of which they strain the mud in which they chiefly
find their food in the form of the microscopical organisms included
therein. The family is abundantly represented in the tropical as well as
temperate waters, although much less so in the latter than in the former.
According to the latest views of ichthyologists, two species ascend on
the coasts of Europe to the British waters and even further northwards,
and two species likewise reach the American coast as far north as Mas-
sachusetts. Messrs. Jordan and Swain have recently investigated the
salt-water American species of the family occurring in the témperate as
well as tropical waters, and find that in the seas on both sides of the
continent there are representatives of three distinct genera, JJugil,
Chenomugil, and Querimana.

The genus Mugil contains the largest species, and is the one most
generally distributed and represented by numerous species throughout
the range covered by the family. Six species of the genus are recog-
nized as American, and two of these are very abundant along the
southern coast of the United States and form the subjects of a very
important fishery. Our two species are now endowed with the names
Mugil cephalus and Mugil curema. Mugil cephalus is the designation
which it is proposed to adopt for the species formerly known as Mugil
albula, for it is now declared that the American form is not specifically
distinet from the European Mugil cephalus. Mugil curema is the name
substituted for the one generally called Mugil braziliensis. The Mugil-
cephalus is the species which has the soft dorsal and anal fins almost

na ii heehee his Meats ionsil

naked, and the sides ornamented with Gark longitudinal stripes ; it is
the largest of the east coast species. The Mugil curema has the soft
dorsal and anal fins sealy, and the sides are plain and without any dark
stripes.

A very little mugilid is quite abundant about Key West and other
parts of Florida, and also occurs in Charleston Harbor; it is known as
the whirligig, and has been named Querimana gyrans.

The American Parrot. fishes. — Under the name of Parrot-fishes are
included quite a number of typical fishes distantly related to the
blacktish or tautog of the North American waters, but differing in the
development and exposure of the jaws and the more or less confluence
of the teeth with the jaws, and also by the modification of the pharyn-
geal bones, which are provided with broad pavement-like teeth. The
rays of the fins are very constant in number, there being in the dorsal
fin nine spines and ten rays, and in the anal two spines and nine rays.
The seales are large and also quite constant in number, there being
about 24 vertical rows, of which those ending on the caudal fin are
elongated and pointed backwards. The colors are usually quite gay
and striking. The fishes themselves are mostly found about coral reefs
or in coral groves, and the peculiar character of the jaws and teeth has
reference to their habits, the fishes feeding upon the coral, which they
bite off and then ingest. They may to some extent be called ruminating
fishes, and have a peculiar apparatus exercising an analogous function,
as has been lately demonstrated by Dr. Sagemehl. These fishes are well
represented in the Caribbean Sea, and have been recently investigated
by Messrs. Jordan and Swain. These gentlemen regard the group as
a sub-family of the labrids, and recognize for the American species
three genera, for which they adopt the names Scarus, Sparisoma, and
Cryptotomus. Their nomenclature is somewhat peculiar for the genera.
(1) The one called by them Scarus is the same as that generally known
as Pseudoscarus ; (2) the Scarus of European and most other authors is
called Sparisoma ; (3) the genus generally known as Calliodon is also
called by a different name, Cryptotomus, inasmuch as the former was
originally given as a generic name for all Scarida, but with specific
mention of only true Scart of Jordan and Swain. Thecelebrated Scarus
of the ancients, a well-known inhabitant of the Mediterranean Sea, must
now, it seems, be known as a Sparisoma, and as congeniers of it in the
Caribbean Sea we have eight species ; of the genus Scarus, five species
are recognized by Jordan and Swain, and of the genus Cryptotomus only
two are known from the West Indies. The species have been neatly
defined by Jordan and Swain, and the result of their labors is a substan-
tial addition to systematic ichthyology, and especially the West Indian
fish fauna.

The use of the Remora in fishing by Africans.—It has long been known
that fishes of the Remora kind, or salt-water “suckers,” as they are
632 _ SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

ealled by American fishermen, have been used for fishing purposes,
but a recent account by Mr. Frederic Holmwood, the British consul at
Zanzibar, adds additional information. It appears that the use of the
remoras for fishing is still in vogue in that country. The fishes are
mostly kept in small canoes and come to the surface of the water on the
approach of the fishermen, and they have learned to allow themselves
to be taken from the water and submit to being handled without at-
tempting to plunge or break away. The owners call them with “a soft
whistling sound,” but Mr. Holmwood had “no means of observing
whether this was recognized by the fish.” Each fish had a strong iron
ring or loop fixed in front of the tail or caudal fin for attaching a line
to when it was to be employed in fishing. ‘In some cases these ap-
pendages had evidently remained on for years, during which the fish
had so grown that the iron had become embedded in a thick fleshy
formation. In twoinstances the ring had been inserted in the muscular
substance at the root of the tail, but generally a simple iron band was
welded round the thinnest part of the body a few inches from the tail,
which kept it from slipping off. To this was riveted a small movable
rinz or loop resembling that of a watch-handle. In one case this loop
was fastened on by servings of brass wire in a similar manner to the
rings of a fishing-rod.”

The fishes are taken out by the fishermen on their trips, which, ac-
cording to Mr. Holmwood, never occupy less than fifteen days. A
specimen was brought to him with the ring gone and with a large
wound or rent before the tail, part of which was also gone. The owner
declared that it had eaught two turtles, and that it had afterwards
‘‘ affixed itself to a large shark, and holding on after all the spare line
had been paid out, the tail had given way. Hestated that the remora,
or, as it was called by the natives, chozo, had then relinquished its hold
and returned in its mutilated state to the boat.” The fishermen assured
Mr. Holmwood that “this was not an unusual occurrence, and that
after a time a fresh ring would be attached and the fish become as
useful as before.”

The sucker of one of the specimens examined by Mr. Holmwood had
twenty-three pairs of lamella, and the species was probably the Hcheneis
neucrates, or slenderremora. (Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1884, pp. 411-413.)

Amphibians.

A new family of Toad-like Amphibians.—A toad-like animal was ob-
tained by the British Museum from Mr. H. B. Guppy, which is of in-
terest on account of its distinctness from previously known forms; it
inhabits three of the Solomon Islands and presents such peculiar char-
acters that it has been regarded by Mr. Boulenger as the representative
of a new family. The species has been named Ceratobatrachus Guen-
theri; the generic name alludes to the development of “a small curved

— ees

spine at the angle of the jaws.” It belongs to the group of Firmis.
ternia and is related to the other species of the group as the Hemi-
phractide are to the Arcifera. The family named Ceratobatrachide
in fact is definable as Firmisternials with teeth in the upper as well as
lower jaw, cylindrical (non-dilated) sacral diapophyses, and with precora-
coids and an omosternum. (Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1884, pp. 212, 213.)

Pugnacity of a Frog.—The frog will appear in a new light to many,
through the observation of an English gentleman, Mr. Edwin H. Evans,
recorded in Nature. A short time before dark this gentleman heard “a
squeaking noise” below his veranda, and on inquiry found that it came
from a bat in contest with a frog. The bat was “evidently getting the
worst of it, but at last succeeded in getting away for a time from its op-
ponent; the frog again attacked it, but this time he was glad to ery
‘quits, as the bat turned on him and beat him off, afterwards managing
to hide somewhere,” so that he couid not be found. The frog was found
badly “bitten about the nose, and was in a sad plight.” Mr. Evans |
remarks that the bat had “ probably fallen from its nest during the day
and was waiting for the evening, when the frog espied it and attacked
it, with the before-mentioned result.” (Nature, Xxxt, p. 55.)

Reptiles.

A new group of extinct Jurassic Reptiles.—In Wyoming Territory, in
beds of the horizon of the Atlantosaurus beds of the Upper Jurassic,
the lower jaw, or rather the dentary bones, of a peculiar reptile were

obtained. These are believed by Professor Marsh to indicate a new

‘‘ order” of extinct Jurassic reptiles, to which he has given the name
Macelognatha. The bones in question ‘‘ resemble in many respects the
corresponding parts of a turtle, but are broader and more nearly hori-
zontal. The jaws were evidently covered with a horny beak in front,
but further back they contained teeth. The edentulous portion is flat
and thin, and nearly horizontal. The two rami meet in nearly the same
plane, and are united at the symphysis by a close suture.” The teeth
had fallen out, but their places were indicated by sockets, the walls be-
tween which “ become thinner backwards, and a groove appears to grad-
ually take their place.” Such were the only evidences of the nature of
the extinct animal, but Professor Marsh considers that he was justified
in assigning to the species (Macelognathus vagans) not only a new family

name but a new ordinal one. He thought that the “jaws are too solid

and massive for birds or pterodactyles,” and that “ the close union of the
rami by suture separates them from Dinosaurs. and the edentulous beak
from crocodiles.” He surmises that the animal ‘was nearest allied to
the Chelonia, although turtles without teeth oecur in the same strata
with them.” (Am. Journ. Se. (3), XXVU, p. 340.)
634 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1as4.

New American Dinosaurs.— Professor Marsh has continued his investi-
gations of the American Jurassic Dinosaurs, notices of which have been
published in previous numbers of these reports of progress, by the de-
scription of anew family of ‘‘Sauropoda.” <A considerable portion of
the skeleton of one of the species of the group was exhumed, and it
was ascertained that the new family called Diplodocide was related to
the Atlantosauride and Morosauride, and distinguished by the follow-
ing characters :

Sauropodous Dinosaurs with the ischia having straight shafts directed
downward and backward, the ends meeting at median line; a large
pituitary fossa, and anterior caudal vertebra deeply excavated below.

Two species ef the family have been made known, which have been
named Diplodocus longus and Diplodocus lacustris. The D. longus was
intermediate in size between the previously known Sauropods, aud is
supposed to have been about forty or fifty feet long when alive. The
teeth show, according to Professor Marsh, that “it was herbivorous, and
the food was probably succulent vegetation. The position of the exter-
nal nares indicates an aquatic life.” The remains of the D. longus were
found in Upper Jurassic beds near Canon City, Colo., and those of the
D. lacustris near Morrison, Colo. All of the American Sauropod Dino-
saurians, hitherto obtained, have been found in Upper Jurassic rocks,
and no Cretaceous forms of this group are known. The group is sup-
posed by Professor Marsh to have the nearest affinities, of all the Dino-
saurs, with the Crocodilians. (Am. Journ. Sci. (3), XXVII, pp. 162-168,
pl: 3, 4.)

United metatarsal Bones in a Reptile —Last year a Dinosaurian reptile

was described as Ceratosaurus nasicornis, whose most interesting fea- -
ture is to be seen in the metatarsal bones. ‘There are only three me- |

tatarsal elements in each foot, the first and fifth having apparently dis-
appeared entirely,” while the remaining three had become ‘completely
ankylosed,” and very much shorter and more robust than in the other
members of the group to which it belongs. In fact, the union of the
metatarsal elements in the Dinosaur is as perfect as is that in ordinary
birds. The position of the foramen, so characteristic of recent birds,
is also the same in the Dinosaur. Professor Marsh summarizes that all
known adult birds, ‘with possibly the single exception of Archcopterya,
have the tarsal bones firmly united, while all the Dinosauria, except
Ceratosaurus, have these bones separate. The exception in each case
brings the two classes near together at this point, and their close affinity
has now been clearly demonstrated.” (Am. Jour. Se. (3), XXVIII, pp.
161, 162.)

The Pteranodous or toothless Pterodactyles.—In 1872 Professor Marsh
briefly noticed some remains of reptiles exhumed from middle Cretaceous

4
ZOOLOGY. 655

rocks of Western Kansas, which were regarded by him as indicative of
not only a new family, but a new order related to the pterodactyles,
and distinguished by the absence of teeth. His previous communica-
tions have been recently supplemented by a well illustrated article on
the ‘principal characters of American Cretaceous pterodactyles,” in
connection with which he gives figures of the skull and bill from four
different views. The skull is certainly very remarkable, and extremely
different from those of all the typical pterodactyles; it is much elon-
gated, the facial portion being greatly produced forwards, and a sagit-
tal crest of enormous size, and reminding one somewhat of a helmet,
but compressed, extending “far backwards and somewhat upward.”
The jaws are also quite peculiar and “project forward like a huge pair
of pointed shears; they are very long, sharply pointed in front, and
entirely destitute of teeth,” and indeed the margins are as smooth
and thin as in recent birds. It is supposed by Professor Marsh that
the jaws were inclosed in a horny sheath. The bones of the skull are
mostly extremely thin, and, “with the exception of the occipital con-
dyle, the lower ends of the quadrates all seem to have been pneu-

~ matic.” <A noteworthy feature is the existence of large antorbital

openings near the middle of the skull and directly over the posterior
nares. The skull is described as having a length of 760 millimeters.
Professor Marsh sums up the evidence furnished by the skull with the
statement that it differs especially from that of the other pterodactyles
‘in (i) the absence of teeth; (2) the absence of anterior nasal apertures,
distinct from the antorbital openings; (3) the presence of the elongated
occipital crest”; and (4) the encasement of the jaws with a horny sheath.
(Am. Journ. Se. (3), XXVIII, pp. 422-426, pl. 15.)

The classification of Lizards.—The system of the Lacertilian order
has been revised by Mr. G. -A. Boulenger. Commendation is given
of Professor Cope’s work on that group as showing the best appre-
ciation of the characters and relationships of the families of the order.
Physiognomy and external characters, which were much relied upon by
the old naturalists, are of little censequence and very apt to mislead.
The anatomical characters and especially the modifications of the eran-
jum are the safest guides and the best clew to the affinities of the an-
imals. The suborders of Professor Cope’s system are reduced to two:
(1) the Lacertilia vera, and (2) the Rhiptoglossa, including only the
Chameleons. Twenty-one families are recognized; many of these are
more or less modified and two new ones established, Uroplatide for
Uroplatys, formerly confounded with the geckos, and Dibamida, based
on Dibamus, one of the most degraded of the lizards. (Ann. & Mag.
Nat. Hist. (), XIV, pp. 117-122.

The Bull-snake’s Voice.—A large and well-ktiown snake, although of
local distribution in the United States, and known in New Jersey by
636 “SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

the name of Bull or Pine snake (Pityophis melanoleucus) is notorious on
account of the sounds it emits. This was described by the o!d natural-
ist of Philadelphia, William Bartram, as ‘a terrible hiss, resembling
distant thunder,” but there are few who have heard it who would not
regard such a description 2s very much exaggerated. By Dr. Charles
A. White, the hiss of the bull-snake is described as having ‘a peculiar
hoarseness which is sometimes so loud that, with the help of the imagi-
nation, it appears to have suggested a Jikeness to the low rumbling
bellow of the bull,” and in reference to this similarity the serpent owes
one of its names. Dr. White has inquired how the sound is produced.
He found that it is due to the character and posture of the epiglottis.
This organ is absent, or represented only by a tubercle, in all other ser-
pents which he had seen: in the bull-snake it is “a thin, erect, flexi-
ble, flag-shaped or curved spatulate body, situated upon the median
line immediately in front of the rima-glottidis, and’ with its free end
directed upward and backward, its posterior edge curving partly over
the rima. It is evidently this epiglottis that produces the hoarseness
of the hissing sound, which it accomplishes by dividing, and fluttering
in the strong current of air which is forced from the lung out of the
rima.” (Am. Nat., Xvi, 19-21.)

Birds.

Coues’ Key to North American Birds.—One of the most important
books on ornithology published during the past year is the second edi-
tion of Coues’ “ Key to North American Birds,” and, in the words of
one of the most distinguished of European ornithologists, it is “one of
the best and most useful bird-books ever written.” The first edition of
this well-known work was issued in 1872, and the changes have been so
great as to necessitate a thorough revision and recasting of the work.
Indeed, the so-called second edition is really a new work, for very little
of the old is retained unchanged; to it are added the “ Field Ornithol-
ogy,” formerly published as a separate work, and above all a most
important introduction on the anatomy of birds in general, in which
the osteology, neurology, angeiology, pneumatology, splanchnology, and
oology are successively considered. In the words of the European
ornithologist, already quoted, “So much information that cannot be got
at elsewhere is brought together in this comprehensive treatise, that it
ought to be in the hands of every ornithologist, whether he is a special
student of the American avifauna or not.”

Baird, Brewer, and Ridguay’s Water-Birds of North America.—The
great work on North American Water. Birds, whose completion has been
so long and eagerly looked for, has at length been finished. The three
volumes on the Land- Birds were prblished about ten years ago (in 1874)

bom hace)
ee
ZOOLOGY. 637.

with the general title ‘A History of North American Birds,” by Little,
Brown & Co., of Boston, but, as we are informed in the preface to the
Water-Birds, “the cost of the publication of the ‘Land-Birds of North
America’ was so great that the publishers of that work were unwilling
to continue it at their risk and expense.” At last, Professor Whitney,
the former State geologist of California, and Prof. A. Agassiz, the di-
rector of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, assumed the cost of pub-
lication. The volumes of “The Water-Birds of North America,” thus
brought out, are nearly uniform with, and the practical completion of,
the old * History of North American Birds.” <A full figure of the bird
and figares of generic details in outline illustrate each genus, and the
head of each species is also figured. Both colored and uncolored copies
are published.

The water-birds are segregated under nine groups, four of waders and
five of swimmers. The orders of waders are Herodiones (1, p. 1) with
four families, Limicole (1, p. 107) with seven families, Alectorides
(I, p- 350) with three families, and Phoenicopteri with one family ;
those of the swimmers are Anseres (I, p. 419) with one family, Stega-
nopodes (vy. 2, p. 126) with six families, Longipennes (11, p. 191) with
three families, Tubinares (11, p. 344) with two families, and Pygo-
podes (11, p. 420) with three families. This arrangement was not pre-
sented as “strictly natural,” but as the mest apt at present “for the
convenience of the student.” It was suggested that “the orders most
nearly related are the (1) Herodiones and Steganopodes, (2) Limicole
and Alectorides, (3) Phoenicopteri and Anseres, and (4) Longipennes
and Tabinares. Of the Pygopodes the Alcidw present many points
of true relationship to the Tubinares avd Longipennes, while the
latter are not far removed from the Limicole. The Podicipidz also
appear to resemble in some respects (perhaps only teleological) the
Steganopodes.”

The most noteworthy features, in the way of novelty in the new work,
are the revised groupings of the Tubinarine families, and especially of
the family of Albatrosses or Diomedeide, the increase in the species of
gulls of the family Larida, and the arrangement of the family of Alcidae.

Although published in the same year as Dr. Coues’ *“‘ Key,” the later
date of printing and the sudden acquisition of specimens and comparison
of all the forms enabled the authors of the Water-Birds to incorporate
two additional species of large northern gulls (Larus Nelsoni of Hen-
shaw, and Larus schistisagus of Stejneger), thereby increasing the number
of North American species of the genus (including the Chroicocephali)
to nineteen.

The large collections of skins of Alcids, or auks, murres, &c., and
various data resulting from the experience of Dr. Stejneger, in their
homes, threw fresh light on their characters and relationships, and a
new arrangement of the entire family was theresult, which is here given

Miocene Tertiary Indian Birds.—The Tertiary beds of India, belonging
to the series of Siwalik beds (so called on account of their being devel-
oped in the Siwalik Hills), have furnished numerous remains of mam-
mals, which have been the subject of various elaborate monographs.
The bones of birds have also been found in considerable numbers, but
have not been investigated until lately. Mr. Robert Lydekker has re-
cently applied himself to the determination of the relationships of these
remains, and has been able to prove to his satisfaction that the bones
belonged to species of Pelecanus, Phalacrocoax, Leptoptilus, Mergus,
Struthio, and Dromeus, or at least very closely related genera. The
most interesting is the so-called Dromeus. This form, called Dromcus
sivalensis, has been based upon four phalangeal bones, which so closely
resemble those of the living Dromeus or emu as to leave little doubt in
his mind that they belonged to at least a nearly allied genus of the class,
although perhaps generically separable. (Jbis (5), 111, p. 107.)

Shedding of Claws in Birds.—Long ago Prof. Sven Nilsson, who re-
cently died at a very advanced age, called attention to the fact that
n certain species of grouse the claws were periodically shed, but his
—

ZOOLOGY. 63

aud other observations have been generally torgotten of late years.
Dr. L. Stejneger has lately had occasion to recall them in connection
with new facts discovered by himself, exhibited in a ptarmigan (Lagopus
albus). He states that in this bird the shedding of the claws “ takes
place in July or August, according to locality and other circumstances,
at the time when the toes are most denuded, in fact almost wholly
naked, and the dark summer plumage is most complete. The claws
grow very rapidly, however, and reach their full length long before the
white winter plumage with the densely clothed toes is fully developed.”
So far as known, continues Dr. Stejneger, ‘‘this process is confined to
the members of the family Tetraonide,” but has been now found in
Bonasa bonasia, Urogallus urogallus, Lyrurus tetrix, Lagopus albus, and
L. Ridgwayi. According to Dr. Collett, of Christiania, a specimen of the
common quail of Hurope (Coturnix coturnizx) also shed its claws in con-
finement, but this, says Dr. Stejneger, ‘may have been due to some
pathological process.”

As is generally known, the claws of the ptarmigans in winter become
much elongated, and Dr. Stejneger quotes some observations of Pro-
fessor Meves upon the habit of the bird bearing upon this development.
The species of Lagopus have, ‘all through the winter, to struggle with
the snow, upon which they are forced to walk. The snow is often
loose, and, with a foot like that of the common fowl, they would need
much greater exertion of their strength in order to keep themselves on
the surface. But the ptarmigan, by having the under side of the toes
thickly covered with feathers, which can be spread out, and by means
of the long and straight claws, which may be compared with snow-
shoes, are enabled to run easily over the snow. The usefulness and the
necessity of the lengthening of the nails are self-evident. Inthe genus
Tetrao ( Urogallus, + Lyrurus, + Bonasa) the lateral horny fringes of the
toes render the same excellent service, and may fitly be regarded as a
kind of snow-shoe. During the summer this whole outfit becomes super-
fluous, which may be the main cause of the periodical shedding.”
(Am. Nat., XVI, pp. 774,775; Ibis (5), 111, pp. 50-52.)

The number of Parrots —A useful work by Dr. Anton Reichenow
has been brought to a close, and, as it has been finished, constitutes a
monograph of the family of Parrots. It has appeared in 11 folio parts,
with 33 colored plates; 4485 species of the group are recognized, and
thus we have, including species described meanwhile and since, nearly
460 species of that family or group of families. These, some or other,
inbabit all the tropical countries and are represented by a few outlyers
in both the northern and southern temperate regions. (bis (4), I, p.
112.

Light weight of the Hornbill.—Some interesting observations have
been published by Prof. Alphonse Milne-Edwards on one of the horn-
bills. (Calao rhinoceros), The individual serving for these observations

was taken to Paris by M. F. Fauque, the chief of a scientific mission to
Sumatra, sent by the French minister of public instruction. The bird
is apparently almost as large as a turkey, but on account of the pecu-
liar disposition of its breathing apparatus and the large air-sacs it is
remarkably light; its weight scarcely exceeds 1,500 grammes. (Comptes
Rendus Acad. Sc. Paris, November 17; Nature, XxXx1, p. 95.)

Two Swans from one egg.—A remarkable case of the development of
two birds from an egg with two yelks has been recorded by Mr. Albert
A. C. le Souéf, of Melbourne. A black-necked swan of Australia had
commenced sitting on three eggs, but one of them was broken and not
replaced by another, leaving only two behind. Nevertheless, to the
astonishment of Mr. le Souéf and the keeper, three cygnets came forth
from the two eggs. At first the cygnets were nearly of a size, but in a
very short time one commenced to grow much faster than the other two,
and at the age of seven months one of them was as large as the parents,
but the other two very much smaller, although unequal in size, and the
smallest was a queer little fellow, and although apparently quite healthy
remained covered with down and looked as if it were only two months
old. (Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1884, p. 390.)

Mammals.

Tuberculosis in Menagerie Animals.—It has been asserted that a very
large proportion of tropical animals, and especially of the monkeys, die
in the menageries from consumption—phthisis tuberculosis. The sub-
ject-matter has been investigated by Mr. J. B. Sutton, lecturer on com-
parative anatoury in the Middlesex Hospital Medical College, and his
conclusions contradict the views generally current. On a superficial
examination, indeed, he says, ‘it would seem that half the animals dying
in the Society gardens succumb to this affection. It so frequently hap-
pens that if the lung presents a spotted appearance or on section shows
caseous spots of any description, the condition is set down as ‘tubercu-
losis.” But after careful inquiry, the conclusion was forced on Mr.
Sutton that “ tubercle is by uo means so common among animals as is
generally supposed. Three diseases are especially liable to be con-
founded with consumption, and the latter must be diagnosed carefully.
The precision afforded by microscopical examination of diseased tissues
has led to a more rigid definition, and consequent restriction, of the term
‘tubercle’ from such appearances as the lungs present in lobular pneumo-
nia, or lung-tissue consolidated by pneumonia, which, instead of resolv-
ing, ends in suppuration, and, lastly, encysted parasites. If these three
morbid conditions be excluded, then tuberculosis is very uncommon. The
larger carnivora (lions, tigers, and leopards) are exceedingly vulnerable
to attacks of pneumonia, and bears frequently die from this affection,
due to the suppuration of the consolidated portion of the lung. The
coati (Nasua) is very liable to suffer from cavities in its lungs due to
ZOOLOGY. 641

this breaking-down of inflammatory products, and on three occasions
pneumothorax has resulted from the rupture of a vomica.” Even en-
cysted parasites may be mistaken for tubercle. After due study of the
disease and its conditions, Mr. Sutton reached the conclusion that “the
disease had its origin in the food or at least in the alimentary canal,”
and bacilli were found by ‘thousands and tens of thousands.” The
viscera of such animals as had died of consumption exhibited certain
lesions, and it was supposed that the disease was due to feeding on
fowls that already had consumption. Two animals afforded the means
for determining whether such was likely to be the case or not. The two
animals were ‘‘ fed on birds’ heads and viscera, and as their livers con-
tained ‘ bacilli’ it was fair to infer that they had accidentally contracted
the disease by feeding on tuberculous fowls.” But ‘‘ what the precise
nature and origin of these organisms may eventually turn out to be, is
of course very uncertain; the matter is still being investigated and
must for the present remain sub judice.” As to the monkeys, tubercle
was found only in three cases among 110 individuals that died; of these
two were Rhesus monkeys and one a Vervet monkey, all Old World spe-
cies. In these cases ‘“ the disease was unmistakable tubercular phthisis
associated with cavities in the apices of the lungs, in every point re-
sembling the disease as met with in the human subject.” (Proc. Zool.
Soc. London, 1884.)

The Monotremes, egg-laying Mammals.—In 1799, Shaw ventured to de-
scribe, as a new generic type of mammals, a skin obtained from Australia
which combined the body of a quadruped with a bill resembling that of
a duck. On account of such a combination, Shaw was at first doubtful
whether it was not an artefact, but, seeing no evidence of the handi-
work of man, he proceeded, with some hesitation, to describe the object
as anew species, giving it the name of Platypus anatinus. Very soon after
(in 1800), Blumenbach, in Germany, also described a similar specimen
under the name of Ornithorhynchus paradoxus. The name Platypus being
pre-occupied, the animal, for such it proved to be, bears now the name
of Ornithorhynchus anatinus, its validity as a true animal being estab-
lished. But later, skepticism was awakened on another point. It was
affirmed that this animal laid eggs, and, indeed, a couple of anatomists in-
ferred that it did from observations of its genitalia. Inasmuch, however,
as all other mammals were supposed to be viviparous, and in such the
ovarian eggs are excessively minute, it was thought by many that there
must be some error in the observations, or falsification. The assertion
was taken up and corroborated later by several observers of the animal
in nature, and an egg was even figured by Geoffroy St. Hilaire. Sev-
eral of the old naturalists, including Charles Bonaparte, on account of
its oviparity, regarded it as the representative of a peculiar class inter-
mediate between mammals and birds. A French naturalist claimed
to have found a specimen pregnant with young, but skepticism pre-

a Sedo ———4 1
642 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

vatied, and in time not even the remembrance of the facts was left.
During the past year, however, the reliability of the old naturalists has
been verified by two independent observers, Mr. W. H. Caldwell and
Dr. Wilhelm Haacke. Mr. W. H. Caldwell, who, it may be remarked,
was the first Balfour student, went to Australia, partly at the expense of
the British Association for the Advancement of Science, for the purpose
of studying the embryology of the Monotremes and Ceratodus. In Sep-
tember a telegram was sent to the British Association informing its mem-
bers that ‘ Caldwell finds Monotremes oviparous; ovum meroblastic.”
About the same time Dr. Haacke found an egg in the Australian
Echidna or Tachyglossus. The two animals, however, differ consider-
ably in their disposition of the egg. The aquatic Ornithorhynchus ex-
cavates a deep hole in the banks, which it enters by an opening under
the water, and in its burrow it forms a kind of a nest in which it de-
posits two eggs. The terrestrial Tachyglossus produces only one large
egg having an essential resemblance to that of the Ornithorhynchus, but
transfers it to its mammary pouch, wherein it is hatched.

The statement that the egg is meroblastic, which the telegraph con-
veyed to the British Association, demands a word of explanation. This
means that only a portion of the egg is involved in the original segmen-
tation, and that the rest is a food-supply for the early developing em-
bryo. In other words, the egg resembles that of a bird or reptile, and
differs from the minute one of the other mammals.

For other facts in the long and interesting history of the Monotremes
the various articles elicited by the new discovery may be referred to.
(Zool. Anzeiger, December 1; Science, V, p. 3; Science, Iv, p. —; Nature,
XXXI, pp. 132-135; Revue Scientifique, XXXv, pp. 657-659.)

The species of Tachyglosstds.—In the early part of the past century a
strange spine-bearing mammal of Australia was made known under
the name of Echidna aculeata, and is now generally known as the Tachy-
glossus aculeatus, the former name having been previously given to a
genus of fishes. For a long time it was the only known species of the
type, and the genus was supposed to be peculiar to Australia; but
within the past decade no less than three species have been obtained
from New Guinea, and two of these are so different from the long-
known Australian species (and another related one discovered in New
Guinea) that they have been generically separated. We have, there-
fore, now four species, or, if we give specific rank (as some may con-
sider to be most natural) to the form occurring in Tasmania, we have
five species of this interesting family. These are as follows:

1. Tachyglossus aculeatus, of Southern Australia.

It may be remarked here that the name Zaglossus was the first given
to the genus later called by others Acanthoglossus, Proechidna, and
Bruynia. The name was proposed by Gill, in 1876, in the Annual Ree-
ord of Scientific Discovery.

The skull of a Triassic Mammal from South Africa.—Although quite
numerous evidences of the existence of mammals in the Triassic and
Jurassic formations have been obtained, that evidence has been chiefly
limited to what could be obtained from the lower jaw and the dentition
thereof. The discovery of more or less entire skulls is therefore of
great interest. Such a find has been made in South Africa in the Trias
beds, distinguished by the richness of their reptilian remains. The
specimen in question is a nearly entire skull, wanting only the hinder
part, and measuring “ about 3? inches in length from the broken end of
the parietal crest to the point of the united premaxillaries. The upper
surface shows the anchylosed calvarial portions of the parietals and the
frontal bones divided by a suture; the contiguous angles of these four
bones are cut off, so as to leave an aperture, occupied by matrix, which
may be a fontanelle, or a pineal or parietal foramen. The frontals
form the upper borders of the orbits, which are bounded in. front by the
lacrymal and malar bones, and were not completed behind by bone.
Each frontal is narrowed to a point at the suture between the nasal and
maxillary. The nasals are narrow, but widen in front to form the upper
border of the exterior nostril, which is terminal, and is completed by
the premaxillaries. The maxillaries are widened posteriorly, then con-
stricted, and again widened before their junction with the intermaxil-
laries.” c

It will be thus seen that Professor Owen has not been able to obtain
characteristics of great importance, and the structure of the base of the
cranium, the roof of the mouth, and the interior of the skull remains
unknown. In faet merely superficial characters have been determined.

The teeth of this form in the upper jaw consisted of a pair of large
round incisors, behind each of which was a smaller premaxillary tooth.
On each side were six molar teeth, “the first of which has a subtriangular
crown with the base applied to the second tooth.” The latter and the
following teeth are “nearly similar, subquadrate in form, with the crowns
impressed by a pair of antero-posterior grooves, dividing the grinding
surface into three similarly disposed ridges, and each ridge is separated
by cross notches into tubercles. Of these there are in the second to the
fourth molar inclusive, four tubercles on the mid ridge, three on the
inner ridge, and two on the outer ridge.” Between the premaxillary and
molar teeth was ‘a ridged diastema,” no canines being developed.

The dentition thus indicated was different from that exhibited by re-
cent forms, resembling that of the Alicrolestes from the Keuper of Wiir-
temburg and the Rhetic of Somersetshire and those of the Oolitic
genus Stereognathus and the three forms apparently belonged to the
same family, the Stereognathida.

The dentition of the Capybara.—The Capybara is distinguished by a
very remarkable dentition which has impelled some naturalists to recog-
nize it as a peculiar family type—the Hydrocheride. The milk-teeth
have been lately examined by Professor Flower. The little animal,
eight days old, had just the same number of teeth as the adult. “ The
incisors and four molariform teeth were all present and in an equal state
of development. A small portion of the surface of each, including the
posterior molar, has been already abraded by wear. The molar teeth
show the same form and pattern as in theadult, being each divided by
deep lateral grooves into distinct lobes corresponding to those of the
full-grown teeth. They are, however, all very much smaller, the length
of the whole series in the upper jaw being 30 millimeters instead of 72
as in the adult. They evidently represent the narrow apical portion of
the permanent teeth, which, as growth proceeds, wears off, and they are
not in any case milk-teeth. As the first of the series, or premolar, is as
fully developed as the one which follows it (or first true molar) it must
either have no predecessor, or one which has disappeared at an early
stage of intra-uterine life.” (Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1884, pp. 252, 253.)

A new generic type related to the Musk-rat.—A naturalist would scarcely
look for a new generic type of mammals as large as a rat in any part of
the United States, and yet such a form was obtained last year by the
National Museum and described by Mr. Frederick W. True, the curator
of mammals. The specimens were obtained at Georgiana, Fla., by
Mr. William Wittfield. The animal resembles an ordinary musk-rat in
general appearance, but has neither the compressed, rudder-like tail nor
the large webbed hind feet and bent toes characteristic of the musk-rat.
It looks, indeed, in the words of Mr. True, ‘‘like an overgrown and
dropsical house-rat, and was at first entered in the catalogue of the
Museum,” by his assistant, ‘‘as a doubtful species of that genus.” A
closer examination, however, demonstrated that it was very distinct not
only from any Mus, or the musk-rat, but from any other known mammal.
It has the ‘general form and color,” as well as the “head, eyes, and fore-
legs,” characteristic of the musk-rat, but the hind limbs are less than
twice the length of the fore-feet and have “straight slightly webbed
toes and naked soles;” the tail is round and very thickly covered with
dull-brown hair, through which the scales which encase it are apparent.
The length of the head and body is 20.2 centimeters, and that of the
tail 12.7 centimeters; the hind-feet (without the claws) are 3.9 centi-
meters long. ;

No particulars have been received respecting the habits of the animal,
but, in Mr. True’s opinion, ‘the slight webbing of its toes, and their
unbent condition, taken together with the rounded tail, would lead one
to prophesy that it is not so thoroughly aquatic as the ordinary musk-
rat, probably no more so than many of the field-mice.”. The name
Neofiber Alleni has been given to the new Murid. (Science, Iv, p. 34.)

A new suborder of extinct Mammals.—In 1882 Professor Cope described,
from a fragment of the lower jaw, a new generic type of mammals under
the name Pantolambda bathmudon. A considerable part of the skeleton
having been since secured, Professor Cope was able to form a more
adequate idea of its characters and considered it as the type of not only
a distinet family but of a “new” suborder of Amblypoda. The refer-
ence is somewhat doubtfal owing to the inability of Professor Cope to
examine the carpus, but the co-ordination of characters seems to indi-

- eate the place claimed for the genus by him. Assuming, then, that

the Pantolambdide form a peculiar family of Amblypoda, Professor
Cope proposes to define and limit the suborders as follows: :

The Pantolambdid represent the suborder Taligrada distinguished
by the ‘‘astragalus, witha head distinct from trochlea, with distal articu-
lar facets.”

The Pantodonta may be known by the astragalus destitute of a head
and the distal facets subinferior. (Proc. Am. Phil. Soc., XX, pp. 557-
559.)

The acclimatization of the Japanese Deer.—TVhere is a small deer found
in Japan, Cervus sika, related to the Sambur deer, or Rusa, which may
become a subject of some economical importance. The Viscount Pow-
erscourt imported some of these animals and turned them into his
park, and had considerable success in raising them. He commenced
with one male and three females, and these, Viscount Powerscourt
thinks, “have been the only deer of any newly-introduced kind which
have been a real success.” These deer were introduced about the year
1860, and in 1854 Viscount Powerscourt had ‘“ upwards of one hundred
of them, besides having shot two or three yearly, and also having given
away a great many and sold others.” The viscount sums up his opinion
that the Japanese deer are “ a most satisfactory little deer; the venison
when dressed is about the size of Welsh mutton and very well flavored.
The little stags, with their black coats and thick necks, like miniature
Samburs, are very picturesque and ornamental, and I think they are a
decided addition to our varieties of hardy park deer.” They have “a
most peculiar cry in the rutting season, a sort of whistle, varying some-
times into a scream.” The Japanese deer interbred with the red deer
in the viscount’s park, and there were three or four deer in the park
which were regarded as being certainly hybrids, the red hind in each
case being the dam.

Harly Lemuroids.—The Lemuroids, which are now so characteristic of
Madagascar and represented sparingly in other parts of Africa, instead
of being peculiar to a limited continent, were in early times widely dis-
tributed, and the forms of Africa are really the relics of a once widely-
spread type. The old forms, however, were not very closely related to
the modern, and represent even distinct families. They were at home
in America as well as in Europe during the Eocene, and in late years
646 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884,

much light has been thrown upon their relationship. One was known
to Cuvier and indicated under the generic name of Adapis. But the
great French naturalist had no idea as to its true affinities, and in fact
mistook its remains for those of a hog-like animal. In America, accord:
ing to Professor Cope, two families were represented in the Eocene
period, one of which, the Mixodectida, had three premolars in the upper
jaw, and the other, the Anaptomorphide, had two. The Mixodectide
were represented by as many as five generic types, and of the Anapto-
morphide, two have been made known. Of the latter, the typical genus
is Anaptomorphus, and another one has been called Indrodon.

The name Anaptomorphus has reference to the similarity of the era-
nium to that of man, while Indrodon refers to some similiarity between
the dentition of the form so named and that of the extinct Madagascar
genus, Indris. (Am. Nat., xvi, pp. 59-62.)

Breeding and disposition of Monkeys and Lemurs.—The extent to which
the Primates (monkeys, &c.) may breed in confinement will probably be
new to most persons. Mr. Arthur Nichols ascertained that at least
twelve out of about eighty species kept in the Zoological Gardens have
bred during the past thirty years. Lemurs formed a large proportion.
The Rhesus monkey bred more frequently than any other species.
According to Mr. Nichols, ‘the disposition and moral character (in the
widest sense) of no species of monkey whatever approaches that of the
dog,” and he suggests that this may be due to the absence of inheritance
of the “ gradually accumulated cultivation of these qualities through
association with man” which the dog has enjoyed. The monkey cannot
benefit by such experience, ‘owing to the impossibility of rearing a
succession of generations in captivity.” (Nature, XXX1, p. 54.)

Diseases of Monkeys and Lemurs.—The diseases of the monkeys and
lemurs have been investigated by Mr. J. B. Sutton, who had special
access, for that purpose, to the Zoological’Gardens of London. He con-
tinued his investigations from December 1, 1881, to March 30, 1883, dur-
ing which time one hundred and ten of the quadrumana died, and the
viscera of ninety-three were specially examined with the following re-
sults : (1) tubercle was found in three instances only ; (2) bronchitis was
met with in twenty-two cases; (3) pneumonia in its lobar form is not
common, only three deaths being traced to that disease, but ‘ the lobu-
lar form is frequent, seven deaths having been occasioned by it;” (4)
empyema was manifested in two cases; (5) “ abscess of lung burst into
a bronchus, filled the trachea and thus suffocated a baboon ;” (6) “ edema
of lung killed a squirrel monkey ;” (7) alveolar abscess was a not un-
common mode of death in young animals, “ leading to ulceration and
sloughing of the gums;” the purulent discharges being swallowed, septic
pneumonia is established, “‘sometimes leading to gangrene of the lung;”
(8) scrofula was well marked in three cases ; (9) “ intussusception of the

ZOOLOGY. 647,

jejuaum killed a very fine lemur ;” (10) leucocythemia was met with in
a lemur, “the spleen of the animal having become enlarged to fifty times
the normal bulk ;” (11) “ typhoid fever proved fatal in four cases, three
lemurs and one monkey.”

A “very unexpected cause of death manifested itself in bone disease,
in the form of typical rickets. Next to bronchitis this is the most fre-
quent cause of death among the monkeys.” For a detailed clinical
account reference must be made to Mr. Sutton’s original communica-
tion. (Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1883, pp. 581-586.)

A new fresh-water Manatee.—It has recently been shown that not only
is there a difference between the African and American Manatees, but
that there are two species of the genus represented along the American
coast, one being that of Florida and the other fouud along the South
American coast. Still more recently, the mammals collected many years
ago by Dr. Natterer, the Austrian naturalist, so well known for his
travels in Brazil, have been worked over by Dr. Von Pelzeln, who has
now charge of the collections in Vienna of which the old traveller’s
gatherings form a part. It seems that among them were found speci-
mens of a manatee that lives high up the Amazon as well as the Rio
Negro, the Rio Brancho, and Madeira. It is stated that Natterer him-
self had perceived the differences between this manatee and the others
that are known, and had given it the name Manatus inunguis, referring
to its nailless fingers. The specific distinction of the form has been in-
sisted upon by Dr. Von Pelzeln, and the animal has been ally described.
(Am. Nat., XVIII, p. 941.)

The flukes of Whales —What are the flukes of whales? This, it ap-
pears, is a question that cannot be satisfactorily answered at the pres-
ent time, and at least there is a diversity of opinions in respect to their
homologies. Do they simply represent a laterally expanded tail, or are
they the remnants of the posterior feet of quadruped ancestors? A
difference in interpretation has long prevailed, and the subject has been
made prominent recently by some memoirs or addresses of Prof. W.
H. Flower. By some old naturalists, and even by Linneus, the flukes
were regarded as tantamount to the entire hind limbs. Not long ago, Gill
suggested that the flukes represent the hypertrophied integuments of the
hind limbs, while the osseous portions partially persist in the rudimentary
bones located far in front of them. Lastly, Professor Flower has again
taken up the question. ‘‘ One of the methods,” says he,“ by which a land
mammal may have been changed into an aquatic one is clearly shown
in the stages which still survive among the carnivora. The seals are
obviously modifications of the land carnivora, the Otaria, or sea-lions and
sea-bears, being curiously intermediate. Many naturalists have been
tempted to think that the whales represent a still further stage of the
same kind of modifications. But there is to my mind a fatal objeetion
to this view. The seal, of course, has much in common with the whale,
648 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

inasmuch as it is a mammal adapted for an aquatic life, but it has been
converted to its general fish-like form by the peculiar development of
its hind limbs into instruments of propulsion through the water, for,
though the thighs and legs are small, the feet are karge and are the
special organs of locomotion in the water, the tail being quite rudi-
mentary. In the whales the hind limbs are aborted and the tail devel-
oped into a powerful swimming organ. Now, it is very difficult to sup-
pose that when the hind limbs had once become so well adapted to a
function so essential to the welfare of the animal as that of swimming,
they could ever have become reduced and their action transferred to the
tail. It is far more reasonable to suppose that whales were derived
from animals with large tails, which were used in swimming, eventually
with such effect that the hind limbs became no longer necessary, and so
gradually disappeared. The powerful tail, with lateral cutaneous flanges,
of an American species of otter (Pteronura Sandbachit), or the still more
familiar tail of the beaver, may give some idea of this member in the
primitive cetacea.”

Such are the arguments, in brief, of Professor Flower. But it is not
necessary to suppose that the whales have evolved from a specialized
form like the Pinnipeds, which he indeed denies, for be rather contends
that they show ungulate affinities. It appears to be more reasonable to
infer that the cetaceans have descended from quadrupeds with rather
weak or ordinary hind limbs. Nevertheless, we find, in the feet of the
Otariids, or eared seals, some clew to the possible genesis of the flukes .

as modifications of the limbs.

Let us suppose, then, that a terrestrial mammal with even ordinary (but
not ungulate) hind limbs should take to the water,and its descendants,
following it in habits, should develop processes analogous to the mem-
branous extensions of the hind limbs in the eared seals. These may be em-
ployedin swimming, and the osseous parts not assisting, or even being
prejudicial to such progress, might become atrophied, and. in the course
of atrophy would be overgrown by the integument and muscles, and ap-
pear to be pulled forward, while the membranous portions of the feet
would becoine hypertrophied; this hypertrophy would extend to the mus-
cles as well as to the integuments, and, of course, all would become very
much modified. In fine, we wouldin time have a case where the posterior
limbs of the ancestral quadruped would be represented in part by the
flukes and in part by the included rudimentary bones, the flukes repre-
senting the hypertrophied integuments of the primitive members and the
bones the atrophied remains of the skeletal portions. The fact that m the
specialized aquatic or rather pelagic forms, the tail is always very much
reduced or rudimentary, may be considered as entitled to some value as
an argument in favor of the view presented, although not much, The
transversely expanded tails of the South American otter and beaver.
are quite exceptional. In most aquatic forms, the tail is more or less
compressed.

By Ov1s T. MAson.

INTRODUCTION.

The summary of progress in Anthropology for 1884 will contain the
titles of many illustrious works in every department of the science.

The programme of antbropology has been admirably sketched by
Professor Flower in his anniversary address before the Anthropological
Institute of Great Britain and Ireland.

‘One of the great difficulties with regard to making anthropology a
special subject of study and devoting a special organization to its pro-
motion, is the multifarious nature of the branches of knowledge com-
prehended under the title. Anthropology, as now understood, treats
of mankind as a whole. It investigates his origin and his relations to
the rest of the universe. It involves the aid of the science of zodlogy,
comparative anatomy, and physiology; and the wider the range of
knowledge met with in other regions of natural structure, and the more
abundant the terms of comparison known, the less risk there will be of
error in attempting to estimate the distinctions and resemblances be-
tween man and his nearest allies, and fixing his place in the zodélogical
scale. Here we are drawn into contact with an immense domain of
knowledge, including a study of all the laws which modify the condi-
tions under which organic bodies are manifested. Furthermore, it is
not only with man’s bodily structure and its relation to that of the lower
animals that we have to deal: the moral and intellectual side of his
nature finds its rudiments in them also, and the difficult study of com-
parative psychology is an important factor in any complete system of
anthropology.

“The study of ‘ prehistoric archeology,’ as it is commonly ealled, in-
vestigates the origin of all human culture, endeavoring to trace to their
common beginning the streams of all our arts, customs, and history,
knowledge of the origin and development of particular existing cus-
toms, throws immense light upon their real nature and importance, and,
conversely, it is often only from a profound acquaintance with the
present, or comparatively modern, manifestations of culture that we
are able to interpret the slight indications afforded us by the scanty
remains of primitive civilization. Even the more limited subject of
ethnology must be approached from many sides, and requires for its

677
67184," SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

cultivation knowledge derived from sciences so diverse, and requiring
such different mental attributes and systems of training as scarcely
ever to be found combined in one individual. The differential charac-
ters of the groups or races of mankind, are:

‘1, Structural or anatomical characters.

“<2, The mentaland moral characters by which races are distinguished.

“3, Language.

“4, Social customs, including habitations, dress, arms, food, cere-
monies, beliefs, laws.

“The subject of ethnography, or the discrimination and description of
race characteristics, is perhaps the most practically important of the
various branches of anthropology.” :

The following works of general import were issued in this country
during the past year:

‘‘The Second Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology to the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 1880-81, by J. W. Powell,
Director,” this year issued from the Government press, bearing the date
of 1883. The volume is uniform in appearance with the first, and con-
tains xxxvii-477 pages, 77 plates, 714 figures, and 2 maps. The follow-
ing is the table of contents: Report of the Director, pp. xv-xxxvii;
Zuni Fetiches, by F. A. Cushing, pp. 9-46; Myths of the Iroquois, by
Erminnie A. Smith, pp. 47-116; Animal Carvings from the Mounds of
the Mississippi Valley, by H. W. Henshaw, pp. 117-166; Navajo Sil-
versmiths, by Dr. Washington Matthews. pp. 179-306; Art in Shell
of the Ancient Americans, by W. H. Holmes, pp. 185-305. Catalogue
of Collections, &c., by canes Stevenson, pp. 307-422; Catalogue of
Collections, by J once Stevenson, pp. 425-466.

The Director’s report reviews the work of the Bureau, with comments
upon the papers published in the volume.

Mr. Cushing discusses the subject of fetiches in general, but devotes
the most of his paper to a very interesting explanation of the hunter
gods of the north, south, east, west, above, below.

Mrs. Smith’s chapter is a collection of Iroquois myths, taken partly
from literature, but mostly from the lips of the Indians by the writer.

Mr. Henshaw reviews the works of Squier and Davis, as a naturalist,
to show that the suggestions of the mound pipes and other carvings
existed in the Mississippi Valley, and none of the animals represented
are tropical.

Dr. Matthews, while serving on the frontier, employed a Navajo silver-
smith to make some jewelry, watching him, and reporting every step
in the process..

Mr. Holmes’s paper relates especially to the use. of shells by the
ancient mound-builders, the most interesting chapter being devoted to
carved gorgets resembling in ornamentation Aztec specimens.

Colonel Stevenson gives an account of a year’s Cees his cata-
logue being illustrated with numerous cuts.

ANTHROPOLOGY. 679

The American Antiquarian continues to be the only periodical in
America devoted entirely to a department of anthropology.

The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Annual Reports of the Trustees of the
Peabody Museum, forming Nos. 3 and 4 of Vol. III, contain the fol-
lowing anthropological papers:

Sixteenth report of the curator.

List of additions to the museum and library.

Social and political position of women among the Huron-Iroquois
tribes, by Lucien Carr, assistant curator.

Human remains from caves in Coahuila, Mexico, by C. A. Studley.

The White Buffalo Festival of the Uncpapas. by Alice C. Fletcher.

The Elk Mystery of the Ogallala, by Alice C. Fletcher.

Ceremony of the Four Winds, by the Santee Sioux, by Alice C.
Fletcher.

The Shadow or Ghost Lodge, an Ogallala ceremony, by Alice C.
Fletcher.

The Pipe Dance of the Omahas, by Alice C. Fletcher.

Seventeenth report of the curator, with lists of additions.

Report on Meteoric Iron from Mounds, by R. P. Kennicott, Ph. D.

The curator’s report gives a flattering account of the work of the mu-
seum in 1884. In addition to the usual appropriation the sum of $3,350
was subscribed for archeological research in America.

Professor Putnam gives a résumé of successful explorations in the
shell-heaps of Maine and in the mounds of Tennessee and Ohio. The
explorations at Madisonville, Ohio, especially, were of the most thorough

character, and the results were in many respects new to American
archeology.

Mr. Carr takes the ground that woman among the Huron-Iroquois
Indians was not the drudge she is commonly represented to be, but
had only her fair share of labor, and great influence in the councils of
the tribe.

Miss Studley gives an account of the osteological collections from four
caves in the limestone formation in the State of Coahuila, Mexico, col-
lected in 1880 by Dr. Edward Palmer.

Miss Fletcher describes the festival given to the man who among the
Unepapas has the good fortune to kill a white buffalo; the Santee cere-
mony of seeking the black stone or the raven; symbols of the four
winds; and the Ogallala-Sioux custom of keeping a ghost lodge for
deceased kinsfolk.

By far the most important things found by Professor Putnam, in the
altar of the Turner mound, were several pieces of meteoric iron and
ornaments made of this metal. Dr. Kennicott gives an analysis of this
iron at the close of the report.

M. Désiré Charnay published in a quarto volume the results of bis
explorations ander the patronage of Pierre Lorillard.
CS SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1284.

The international geographical exposition at Toulouse included an
anthropological section, with the following subdivisions :

(1) Anthropology.—Cr rani skeletons, anatomical preparations, fig-
ures, and busts.

(2) Demography.—Statisties, graphic methods, charts, &e.

(3) Prehistorics. Human remains, quaternary: fauna and flora, arms,
utensils, &¢., charts, books, reproductions, views, &e.

(4) Hthnology and ethnography.—Lay figures, illustrations of the ori-
gin, crosses, character, cults, manners, and industries of peoples.

(5) Linguistics —Geographical distribution and filiation of languages,
patois, books, globes, charts, tables.

(6) Societies —Publications, apparatus of demonstration, programmes
of courses, instructions, plans of museums and laboratories.

The Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia has created a chair
of ethnology and archeology, and appointed Dr. Daniel G. Brinton
professor.

Two works continue to be issued from the Surgeon-General’s Office in
Washington of which the value is inealeulable to anthropologists—the
Index-Catalogue and the Index-Medicus. The former is a classified list
of the literature in the great library of the Surgeon-General, and the
latter is a monthly classified bibliography of the medical literature of
the world.

Three volumes in the series of H. H. Bancroft appeared: the first of |
the history ef California forms volume xviII of the series; the first and
second of the history of the Northwest Coast form volumes xxviI and
XXvill of the series.

The Dictionnaire des Sciences Anthropologiques completed its first
volume, and two numbers of the second volume appeared during the
year.

‘In Russia,” says L’Homme, “there are eight universities: Peters:
bourg, Moscow, Kief, Kharkof, Kazan, Odessa, Dorpat, and Varsovie.
The professors number 385. Among the chairs lately created in each
university there is to be a professor of geography and ethnography.”

Among the English visitors at the British Association in Montreal
was Prof. E. B. Tylor, who took occasion to visit Washington and the
Pueblos. Three addresses were delivered by Mr. Tylor, all of them
worthy of thoughtful attention, upon sociological topics in aboriginal
and civilized America.

THE ORIGIN OF MAN.

No progress seems to have been made during 1884- towards settling
the question of the place, time, or conditions of man’s origin. The
conference of the anthropological section of the Association Frangais
at Blois reveals a multiplicity of opinions, not only respecting the dis-
coveries of Abbe Bourgeois, but M. Mortillet has wrested the case
altogether from human hands and given it to Anthropopithecus. This
—_

will not do; the word was pre-empted by Blainville for a genus of
Simiing, and we should rather say Pithecanthropos. But what ignis
fatuus are we pursuing that becomes man or ape, according as geolo-
gists say man shall or shall not appear in the Miocene? If the flints of
Thenay are artificially wrought, that is mas work, whether it was
done in Eocene or post-Pliocene. Even then we are far from the first
man, who did not imbibe knowledge of flint dressing with his mother’s
milk.
ARCH ZOLOGY.

A permanent contribution to archeological and proto-historic litera-
ture is the work of Dr. Charles Rau, on prehistorie fishing, forming part
of Vol. xxv of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. The au-
thor divides his treatise into two parts, the first relating to Europe, the
second to America. An appendix gives extracts fro.a the early writers,
Egede, Crantz, Lloyd, de Laet, de Champlain, Sagard Theodat, Le
Jeune, Charlevoix, Henry, Hearne, Mackenzie, Williams, Johnson, Ogil-
by, Josselyn, Vander Donck, Kalm, Morgan, Loskiel, DeBry, John
Smith, Beverly, Lawson, Brickell, Adair, Du Pratz, Wyeth, Catlin,
Powers, Stone, Dunn, Swan, Meares, Captain Cook, and Captain King.

In the discussion of European fishing, a chronological order is fol-
lowed. Of the Paleolithic Age, the drift period furnishes no relics of
fishing implements, the, cave period contributes fish-hooks, harpoon-
heads, and fish remains. The Neolithic and the Bronze Ages, in all
their periods, are rich in the evidences of great activity in this industry.
The second part of the volume, relating to North America, is divided
into chapters by subjects: Fishing implements, boats, and appurte-
nances ; prehistoric structures connected with fishing ; representations
of aquatic animals on pipes, &c.; and artificial shell deposits.

In the month of November, 1883, some workmen brought to Dr, Anton
Fritsch, from the clay behind the brewery at Podbaba, near Prague,
the remains of a human skull. It was taken from undisturbed brick
clay (loess) two meters thick, lying under one meter of dense loam, and
at the same level at which, about a week previously, a tusk of the mam-
moth had been obtained. The skull consists of the frontal bone, the
whole left parietal, a fragment of the right as well as a part of the left
temporal bone, with the petrous. The comparison of this skull with a
modern normal one reveals alow arch, a forehead slope of 56°, strongly
developed eyebrows, as in the Neanderthal skull. In the layer above
that containing this skull are found skeletons and artefacts of the
Bronze Age, while in the loess occur remains of the mammoth, Rhinoc-
eros tichorhinus, reindeer, and horse. Professor Schaafihansen is of the
opinion that there is not enough of the skull remaining to justify definite
conclusions.

The horse has been so long associated with man that its history is
considered to be necessary to a study of human environment. The
horses, which constitute the genus Hquus of Linnzeus, and are the sole

representatives of the family Equide, fall into two subgenera, Hquus
and Asinus. Of the subgenus Asinus the best-known species are (1) the
wild ass of Upper Nubia (Hquus teemopus), probably the origin of the
domestic ass; (2) the wild ass of Persia and Kutch (E. onager); (3) the
hemippe, or wild ass of the Syrian desert (H. hemippus); (4) the kiang,
or wild ass of Thibet (HZ. hemionus); (5) the quagga (H. quagga) of
South Africa; (6).the Burchells zebra (ZH. burchellt) of Southern and
Eastern Africa; (7) the zebra (EL. zebra) of Southern Africa. No recent
species of horse referable to the subgenus Hquus was known until
Prjevalskey on his third great jour ney to Central Asia brought back to
St. Petersburg an example of a new species of wild horse. This ani-

mal was described in 1881 in a Russian journal by J. S. Poliatow and
named Hquus prjevalskit. There are some asinine characteristics about
the animal, but the preponderance of characters is- towards the horse.
(Nature, August 21.)

Miss Frances E. Babbitt has succeeded in shifting the interest with
regard to glacial man from New Jersey to Minnesota. The investigation
was conducted with the greatest care, and the result now depends upon
two considerations; the geological age of the bed, and the human work-
manship upon the objects.

The report of Mr. Bandelier upon his archeological studies among
the pueblos of New Mexico in 1881 was printed during the year, and is
a permanent contribution to our literature upon thatsubject. His results
are based upon careful and extended measurements.

The Stone Age in China is a new inquiry, and should lead to good
results. Mr. Mark Williams announces that from Kalgan to Yiicho,
100 miles south, are ancient mounds in clusters on the plain, or singly
on eminences. They are about 30 feet high, circular or oval in shape.
At Kalgan is a group of forty mounds. The Kalgan mounds, 110 miles
west of Peking, have been investigated by Dr. Joseph Edkins.

The Marquis de Nadaillac follows up his volume on prehistoric Amer-
ica with a compilation of what has been written upon the antiquity of
man on our continent, and an essay on the latest writings respecting
the mound-builders Ane the modern Indians. But the most remarka-
ble production of the last-named topic is that of Dr. Emil Schmidt on
the mound-builders and their relation to modern Indians, published in
Kosmos (Leipzig). In the same line are the papers of Carr, Henshaw,
Thomas, Royce, and Brinton.

The first volume of the celebrated ae Mexico & traves los Séglos,
was prepared by Alfred Chavero. The volume comprises the ancient
history from prehistoric times till the capture of the city of Mexico by
Hernan Cortés, and is composed of the following parts:

Introduction: Comprising a review of all the sources of Mexican his-
tory, and an extensive bibliography of Mexican and foreign works on

documents which are known,

Book 1.—Prehistoric times: Comprising anthropological researches,
cosmogonic traditions, the autochthonic race, the origins of civilization
in the south and in the north, é. e., ‘‘maya-kiche” and “ naoha,” primi-
tive monuments, languages, religions, customs, &ce.

Book 2.—The “ Meca,” comprising the various emigrations of this
period, the change of civilization, &e.

Book 3.—The “ Tolteca,” comprising the history of all the contempo-
raneous nations, the new civilization, new customs, new monuments, &e.

Book 4.—The “ Mexica,” comprising the Aztec migration, the history
of the Anahuac people, and of the nations related to them, with a special
treatise on their sociology.

Book 5.—Greatness and downfall of Mexico, comprising the Con-
quest.

Two works on Japanese prehistoric archaeology appeared in 1884,
composed, printed, and illustrated by natives. The impetus to this
work was first given by Professor Morse in his explorations among the
Omori shell-heaps. The two volumes just mentioned arrest the atten-
tion both by the similarity of humbler forms and ornamentation with
the same classes in America, and by the existence of higher forms
quite different from American. If this has any bearing upon the ques-
tion of ethnic contact, it speaks against rather than for the theory.
(See “ Jijima” and ‘“‘ Kanda” in the bibliography.)

BIOLOGY.

The final agreement of the German anthropologists upon a method
of cranial measurement has been reviewed during the year by Dr. J. G.
Garson. After a careful study of the code, the conelusion is reached
that the importance of the following measurements (numbered the same
as in the text of the agreement) has been recognized, and the method of
making them is now agreed upon generally:

2. Maximum length. 17a. Bi-jugal breadth.
4. Maximum breadth. 18. Bi-zygomatie breadth.
5. Maximum frontal breadth. 18a. Interorbital breadth.
7. Height (basio-bregmatic). 21. Height of nose.-

10. Basio-nasal length. 22. Breadth of nose.

12. Length of foramen magnum. 23. Orbital breadth.

13. Breadth of foramen magnum. 25. Orbital height.

15. Fronto-occipital are. 30. Basio-alveolar length.

The following measures are deemed unsatisfactory :

1. Horizontal length. 17b. Infra-jugal face-width.
6. Total height. 24. Maximum horizontal orbital breadth,
8. Ear-height. 26. Vertical height of orbits.
9. Auxiliary ear-height. 27. Palatal length.
11. Basilar length. 28. Palatal breadth.
18a. Bi-mastoid width. 29. Posterior palatine breadth.
13b. Breadth of skull-base. 31. Profile angle.

16. Transverse vertical are,

At the fourteenth general meeting of the German Anthropological
Society, Dr. Johannes Ranke presented a bronze skull which counter-
feited as near as possible the human cranium, and could be subjected
to the same measurements. Moreover it could be filled with water, and
its exact contents determined. Copies of this bronze skull were sent

to the most distinguished cranioscopists throughout the world, for the

purpose of testing their methods.

At the fifteenth meeting in Breslau, some of the results of various”

cranio-metrie processes were reported as follows:
The true cubage of the bronze skull is 1,316.4 cubic cemtimeters.

The British Association Anthropometric Committee.—In 1875 the Brit-
ish Association appointed a committee on anthropometry, of which Dr.
William Farr was chairman until 1878. The reports of the committee
are as follows: 1878, 5 p., Annual Report 182-6; 1879, 35 p., ibid. 175-

One of the most important contributions to ethnic anatomy during
the year is that of Prof. W. H. Flower, on the size of teeth as a char-
acter of race. Asa test of the size of the teeth, the length in a straight
line (as measured with a sliding compass) of the crowns of the five upper
molar teeth, in situ between the anterior surface of the first pre-molar
and posterior surface of the third molar, is called dental Jength (d). The
standard of length, as indicating the general size of the cranium, is the
cranio-facial axis (B N), the distance between the nasion (naso-frontal
suture), and basion (middle of anterior ridge of foramen magnum). In
the average male skull the length is very nearly 100™"; in the female,
95. Between the basio-nasal length and the dental length an index can

: d x 100
be established on the formula y= the dental index. The average

indices range from 40-48; general average, 43. The colton series
will be convenient in the study of races:

Microdont, below 42.

Mesodont, between 42 and 44.

Migadont, above 44.

Mr. Nathaniel Alcock has advanced a curious theory about the black-
ness of the tropical man. The gist of this theory is, that the pigment
of the negro skin offers an impediment to the undue excitation of the
nervous system by the actinic rays of light.

Considerable interest has been excited by a physiological paper of
Dr. Clevenger upon the disadvantages of the upright position. Assum-
ing that man once progressed on all fours, it is shown that the valves
in the veins facilitated the return of blood to the heart. But in the up-
right position there are certain veins in which such return is rather im-
peded, producing hemorrhoids and other disorders.

One of the most practical investigations now going on is that which
essays to bring into some relation measurement of the living and of
the skeleton. Dr. Paul Topinard, while finding the most satisfactory
agreement between these two measures, has discovered that in some
respects, notably in the nasal index, the living subject gives better
ethnic results.

PSYCHOLOGY.

Comparative psychology has received an important addition in the ef-
forts of Sir John Lubbock to teach a dog to understand card language
and to communicate his wishes in the same manner. Dr. P. A. Chad-
bourne, of New York, has revived the study of what is called instinct in
animals, comparing it with the mental powers of man, The scrutiny of
688 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

animal mind is useful to the comparative psychologist in two ways: It
enables him to trace the dividing line between human thinking and ani-
mal thinking, and it affords the opportunity of watching the movements
of thought in its humblest manifestations. Another very fertile field of
anthropological study is child mind. Mr. T. S. Clouston publishes in
Edinburgh Health Society’s Journal, a paper on the growth and devel-
opment of a child in body and mind. Again, the Italian psychologists
excel-in the study of the delinquent classes—examining their brains es-
pecially to find out what are the anatomical concomitants of depravity
and insanity, and also, if possible, to approach the cradle of our race.

But really, psychology is a science of the future. The Society for
Psychical Research devotes its time to ghosts, spirit rappings, mind
reading, rhabdomancy, &c. This is well enough, and such things as
exert an influence on masses of people should be studied. But the so-
ciety for psychical research that we would encourage is one in which
thousands, or at least hundreds, of individuals should sit down beside
the simplest mental phenomena until they understand them. No douht
good results will come from the study of telepathy, and Science does
well to publish the account of all such researches. The American Nat
uralist also continues to publish in a separate department the manifesta-
tions of animal intelligence.

ETHNOLOGY.

E. F. im Thurn contributes to Timehri many interesting articles on
the ancient inhabitants of British Guiana. His greatest work is a vol-
ume entitled ‘Among the Indians of Guiana,” in which the following

tribal names occur: *

Bessels has made an interesting addition to our knowledge of the Es-
kimo in his chapter on the northernmost inhabitants of the earth, whom
he calls the Itanese.

The opinion is gaining ground that the present Eskimo are the sur-
vivors of a very ancient stock once spread much farther south on this
continent, and, according to some, dwelling in the caves of France.
Professor Dawkins is commonly regarded as the apostle of this theory,
and has published a paper in Nature upon the subject.

Dr. Otto Stoll’s volume on the ethnography of the Republic of Gua-
temala is an excellent guidebook to the tribes of that country. Com-
parative vocabularies are given, as well as a colored chart showing the
tribes, and a dissected chart exhibiting the affiliations of the different
branches of the stock.

Von Hellwald’s Natural History of Man has added twelve numbers
during the year. Prof. A. H. Keane has brought this work to the notice
of English readers in his appendices to Sanford’s Compendiums.

The same gentleman contributes to Nature, of January 24, 1884, a
paper on the Egyptian Sudan and its inhabitants, an abstract of which
is given below. Sudan is the Arabic equivalent of Nigritia (Negroland).
Its sections are:

(1) Western Sudan.—The basins of the Senegal and Quovra-Bénue
(Niger).

(2) Central Sudan.—The basins of the Komaduga and Shaw, with
lands draining into Lake Chad.

(3) Eastern Sudan.—Kast of Waidai, the Upper and Middle Nile Basin,
now known as Egyptian Sudan.

The provinces formed out of this territory in 1882 were:

West Sudan.—Darfur, Kordofan, Bahrel-Ghazal, and Dongola, with
capital Fasher.

Central Sudan.—Khartum, Senaar, Berber, Fashoda, and the Equator
(Hat-el-Istwa), with capital Khartum.

East Sudan.—Taka, Suakin, and Massowah, with capital Massowah,

Harrar.—Zeyla, Berbera, and Harrar, with capital Harrar.

* Hamite, Kushite of some writers, answering to the African division of the Mediterranean or Cau-
casio anthropologic type. For the removal of Tibbu from the Negro to the Hamite race, see Vatwre,
March 1, 1883 (North African Ethnology). Most of these are zealous Muhammedans.

fThe Arab Semites are recent intruders, mainly via Isthmus of Suez and Egypt. The Himyarites
are intruders from prehistoric times from South Arabia via Strait of Bab-el Mandeb. The former
Muhammedans, the latter monophysite Christians. ;

t Nubas, intermediate between the Negro and the Hamite. Speech, Negro. No connection with the
Fulah of West Sudan. The Kordofan Nubas, original stock, Pagans. Those of the Nile, Negroid
Christians from V-XIV century. Since then mild Muhammedan. They are the Uaua of Egyptian
records ; Nubce of Strabo, later Nubata.

§ Most of these negroes still Pagans. Some, as Mittu, Krej, and Bongo, red-brown, rather than black,
but the type is negro. Speech of all except the Dinka shows grammatic gender.

|| Bantus not reduced. Included in the Moudirie del’ Kquaeteur of Messedaglia’s official ‘Carte du
Sudan” (Khartum, 1883).

Prince Roland Bonaparte is conferring a lasting benefit upon science
by his portfolios of racial types. Each person is taken in profile and
in full face, and a short biography is in most cases attached.

COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGY.

In the philological camp during the past year there was little activ-
ity. Neither the Smithsonian Institution, the Bureau of Ethnology, the
Peabody Museum, the Antiquarian Society, nor the Archeological In-
stitute published a paper or a volume on language. Aleman’s Quiché

irammar, Brinton’s Grammar of the Cakchiquel, Campbell’s Khitan
Studies, Charency’s Maya-Quiché papers, Gatschet’s Substantive Verb
in North American Languages, and Powell’s Classification of North
American Languages are about all that might be called permanent lit-
erature upon our side of the Atlantic.

The last-named paper is a compilation of the labors of all past inves-

tigators, supplemented by the critical study of the best linguists and the
original investigations of the author. Excepting a small part of our
west coast, we are now able to refer every square league of our territory
to some linguistic stock, and to declare to what stock each tribe be-
longed. In round numbers there are, or were, within the territory of
North America seventy stock languages, each spoken in one or more
separate tongues or languages, and each of these ofttimes divided into
several dialects.

Dr. Allain’s investigations concerning the first rudiments of infantile
language open up a wonderful vein of inquiry, leading not only to the
study of order in the production of sounds, but to the psychological
manifestations revealed in the process.

The development of language among children is the subject of a paper
by M. Sikorsky.

Tolmie and Dawson have prepared a volume of comparative vocabu-
laries of the Indian tribes of British Columbia, with a map illustrating
distribution. The stocks from north to south are the Thlinkit, Tshim-
sian, Haida, Kwakiool, Kawitshin, Aht, Bilhoola, Selish, Tinné, Tshi-
nook.

Prof. John Campbell, of Montreal, has continued his investigations
upon the probable relationship between the Aztec and other American
aboriginal languages and the Khitan.

Through the studies of Brinton, and Charency, the knowledge of the
Central American languages has advanced. Brinton especially has
made solid contributions to knowledge by the addition of new material.

Mr. Robert Needham Cust has published in two volumes, with a map,
a sketch of the modern languages of Africa. It is a work of the great-
est value, albeit in some places the author confounds blood and lan-
guage. The work is reviewed in Nature by Mr. A. H. Keane, and the
defects are pointed out. It is just such work as preceded the formation
of our own Bureau of Ethnology, which will sift the evidence and give
us an accurate account of linguistic stocks.

MYTHOLOGY AND FOLK-LORE,

Mr. J.O. Dorsey has made two contributions to the literature of Indian
mythology. Several other myths have been recorded. The Bureau of
Ethnology is especially engaged in this work, and will publish a large
volume on the subject.

Mr. Cushing’s paper on Zuni fetiches, before mentioned, is an account
of the deities presiding over space, of the animal forms in which these
deities are embodied, the manner in which they are represented in stone,
and the conceptions which underlie their worship of these animals.

Major Powell, in commenting on this paper, uses the following lan-
guage:

“The philosophy of the Zunis is an admirable example of that stage in
692 SCIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

savagery where a transition is shown from zoétheism into physitheism,
with survivals of hekastotheism. In this stage fetichism is the chief
religious means of obtaining success and protection. The fetiches most
valued by the Zunis are natural concretions or eroded rock-forms, having
an obvicus or fancied resemblance to certain animals, or objects of that
nature in which the evident original resemblance has been heightened
by artificial means. It is supposed that these fetiches are actual petri-
factions of the animals represented by them, which retain their vital
forces for certain magic powers and religious purposes. This belief is
explained in a remarkable epic, metrical and sometimes rhythmical, and
filled with archaic expressions, which is in part translated by Mr. Cushing.

“A noticeable point in the paper is the elaborate and systematized _

relationships Shown among and between the animals, the animal gods,
and other supernatural beings having animal or combined animal and
human personalities. This constitutes a theistic society with an elabo-
rate hierarchy and regulated domains, powers, and obligations. Such
minuteness in multiformity, as well as the precision of the beliefs and
ceremonials stated, will be surprising, not only to persons who have
been taught the old fiction of the Indian’s monotheism, but to those who
have regarded his religious philosophy to be vague and chaotic. The
facts are presented with the same corroboration of etymologies in lan-
guage used so successfully by scholars in the study of Eurasian myths,
and with further verification by objects figured in the illustrations.”

Folk-lore is a term applied to the learning or philosophy of unlettered
people. Long before the systematic, recorded, multiplied observation
of phenomena, people come to have a body of sayings about them.
There is lore about the weather, medicine, every human occupation.
Observe, also, that this lore may be concerning the causes and effects
of phenomena, commonly expressed in the words, “ That will make it do
this or that”; or it concerns natural concomitancy, when we say, ‘* That
isa sure sign of something happening.” This folk-lore among savages
runs into mythology, or lore about spiritual beings, the unseen forces of
phenomena. For this reason societies of folk-lore spend much of their
labor in gathering what might be called the unwritten bibles of peoples,
rather than in the saving of their books of practical wisdom or lore. It
will be observed, also, that writers on lore are not careful to discriminate
between cause and effect. When they write about flower-lore, for in-
stance, we are not sure whether they mean the lore about what flowers
will do or are the signs of, or lore about causes and signs relative to the
growth of flowers, or, finally, all the lore in which flowers occur in any
connection.

The greatest praise is due to those anthropologists who spare no pains
in gathering the lore of the lowly and uncivilized peoples. The English
people are far in the lead in this matter, although America, peopled by
all races from all lands, offers a most inviting field. .

ANTHROPOLOGY. 693
SOCIOLOGY.

Sociological studies in our country have been pursued in two direc-
tions. Under the supervision of Major Powell the study of Indian so-
ciology has been prosecuted with great thoroughness. Chief among
the students in this line are Major Powell himself and the Rev. J. Owen
Dorsey, the former devoting himself more especially to the philosoph-
ical side of the question, the latter to the phenomenal side. One of the
most interesting inquiries connected with these investigations, relates to
those influences internal and external to the tribe which have led from
mother-right to father-right. Similar researches have been carried on
among Australian tribes, and reported in the Journal of the Anthropo-
logical Institute in Great Britain. The other direction which sociolog-
ical studies have taken is that which leads to the customs prevailing
in the early communities of Europeans settling within our territory.
These studies have been prosecuted especially under the patronage of
the Johns Hopkins University. Mr. C. Letourneau has given much
attention to the definition and limits of sociology and the relation of
race to social structure.

A popular work of more than ordinary interest is the account of the
snake-dance of the Mokis, written by Captain Bourke, U. 8. A., from
his personal observations.

The sociological studies of Dr. Ploss have become famous through his
great work upon the treatment of children among savages, entitled,
‘Das Kind im Brauch und Sitte.” During the year he published an-
other volume, of no less interest and importance, upon the Wife. These
subjects are worked out with true German scrupulosity. The works
abound in reference to authorities.

The ingenuity of Francis Galton was not exhausted by his invention
of composite photographs. During 1884 he devised not only family
and life history albums, but sect up anthropometric laboratories. It is
said that when he could not persuade the people to be measured, he
secured his end by charging them a shilling for the privilege, carefully
preserving the stubs of the printed record furnished to each visitor.

TECHNOLOGY.

The examination of the bibliography accompanying this paper reveals
the fact that there is a technical side to every investigation. There are
certain tools of all human activities, be they food-quest, fabrication of
clothing or sheiter, amusement, social life, or religion. Each tool and
each process has had its life history. The study of the life history of
tools and their functions is comparative technology. Mr. Simmonds of
London has published a dictionary of useful animals, with their prod-
ucts. The collectors for the Smithsonian Institution have spared no
pains in obtaining the vulgar and scientific names of the animals and
plants entering into domestic economy of savages. A very complete
694 - - §CIENTIFIC RECORD FOR 1884.

investigation in aboriginal technology is a short paper in Major Powell’s
Second Annual Report, on Navajo silversmiths, by Dr. Washington
Matthews. It is impossible to tell when this art of metal-working was
introduced among the Navajos. It is well known that the Navajos are
related to the Tinné Indians of British America, a stock well ad-
vanced in artistic conceptions. Coming southward into contact with
people acquainted with primitive metallurgy, this natural bent would
make it easy for them to practice this art. Their tools and methods are
of the most primitive character, and yet some of the works which they
produce are of great beauty.

PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.
ANTIQUITIES AT PANTALEON, GUATEMALA.

By Lieut. CHARLES E. VREELAND, U. S. N.,
and

J. F. BRANSFORD, Passed Assistant Surgeon, U. S. N.

Some 28 miles from the Pacific, on the railroad from San José to the
city of Guatemala, the town of Escuintla is situated in a piedmont belt
of extremely fertile land. In the same belt, about 30 miles from Es-
cuintla in a northwesterly direction, is the magnificent estate of Panta-
leon, within one league of Santa Lucia.

This neighborhood was brought to the attention of archeologists a
few years ago by the discovery of the very interesting antiquities at
Santa Lucia which were studied and drawn by Dr. Habel, who wrote
a paper for publication by the Smithsonian Institution. Several of the
finest of these specimens were removed to Berlin, where an account of
them was published by Professor Bastian.

The result of the interest thus awakened was the further discovery
of great numbers of relics of the old inhabitants in that vicinity.

In 1882 Dr. Bransford visited this locality in the interest of the Smith-
sonian Institution, and saw some most interesting figures at Pantaleon,
a slight account of which he furnished for the Smithsonian Report of
1882.

At the request of Professor Baird, the United States steamer Hart-
ford stopped at San José, July 31, 1884, and we were allowed to visit
Pantaleon for the purpose of photographing the antiquities. The super-
intendent of the estate, Dou Miguel Garcia Salas, informed us that -
the objects had never been photographed, but drawings had been made
and photographs taken from them at Guatemala.

The objects were all of black basalt or hard lava. Nos. LI, 1, IV,
and V, the small heads in Fig. 1, were mounted on a low wall around

the fountain in the court-yard. Just to the rear and center of these

was the grand figure, No. I (Fig. 2), on a pedestal, while No. VI was
fixed in the wall of the court, behind No. I. Originally there projected
from the lower back part of each head a sort of tenon, which was proba-
bly inserted into a wall supporting the figure. This projection is par-
tially shown in Figs. 7 and 9.

Far the finest of these objects in size and workmanship was No. I,
shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 4. This was found in a low mound on a hill in
the hacienda San Juan, about 7 miles northwest of Pantaleon. Senor
Salas informed us that a sculpture similar in size and design, but not
in such good condition, was left at the mound. The figure was in high
relief, fronting a tablet 50 inches high, 43 wide, and 9 in thickness. A
crest rose 17 inches from the upper edge of the tablet, making the total
height of the object 67 inches. It was in a state of excellent preserva-
tion, the only serious defect being the loss of the greater portion of
the nose. The quiet strength and simplicity of the face is something
new in the art of the ancient Americans. It was well formed, the lines
simple and clear cut, and without a shadow of the conventional. Maj-
esty was so plainly stamped on the countenance that it was known by the
Indians as El Rey—The King. The brow, the eyes, and the nose, as far
as could be judged, were in good shape and proportion. The mouth
was hard and the chin firm and full of character.

On the head was a turban with a banded edge, coming well down on
the brow. On the front of the turban an elaborate arrangement of
plumes was secured by a double band, knotted in front. Lying on its
left side, supported by the band, was a mask of a human face nearly
half the size of that of El Rey. This mask, the ear-rings, and the gor-
get suspended by the necklace were probably chalchihuitls, as we may
well imagine that a man of his consequence would naturally choose the
favorite green stone wherewith to adorn his person. Asa background
for the mask was apparently a broad leaf—it was too broad to have been
a feather—supported in turn by two others of similar design. These
may have been beaten gold, worked into the form of broad leaves or
plumes. Behind these and mounting well above, on each side, were long
plumes. If the last were furnished by that royal bird the quetzal, our
cazique surely rejoiced in a head-dress which in gorgeous brilliancy left
nothing to be desired.

From the lower edge of the turban, behind the ears, depended braided
folds, as of cloth, which mingled with the banded ornamentation on the
chest. From the lobe of each ear was suspended a medallion-shaped
object, and a larger gorget was supported by the necklace. Around
the neck and upper chest other circular ornaments were apparently fast-
ened to the dress.

The tablet had ornamented bands and lines near the sides, but there
was no appearance of hieroglyphs. From the upper margin arose a
sort of crest, which curved over to'the front and ended in a tasseled
arrangement pendent above the head. The appearance of the tablet
ANTIQUITIES AT PANTALEON, GUATEMALA. 725

and crest suggested the back of a chair of state. On the rear surface
a fresh cut nearly 3 feet square showed where the tenon had been re-
moved.

The head No. II, Fig. 5, was that of an old person, whose venerable
appearance was heightened by the deeplines on browand cheek. Nearly
the whole of the ear was taken up by the cylindrical ornaments. The
head-dress ended below in a fluted band, above which, in front, was
the body of a bird. The tail and most of the body of the bird had been
broken away, but the outstretched wings remained to give evidence of
the nature of the cap.

The extreme height of No. II was 21 inches. No. III, Figs. 6 and 7,
was another head of an old person, but instead of the calmness of the
preceding face there was depicted the inexpressible sadness of age
with blindness. Both eyes were represented as hanging from the sock-
ets, the balls resting on the cheeks. The chin and lower lip protruded,
the upper lip fallen in as from loss of teeth. To the long ears were
appended large, pear-shaped ornaments. The head-dress was arranged
in braided folds, turban-like, with a little Tam O’Shanter cap on top.

Fic. 10.—Sculpture from Guatemala, quarter view of Fig. 8.

Figs. 8, 9, and 10, full, three-quarter, and side views of the head No.
IV, show what was probably the most strongly characteristic face of the
lot. The prominent brow and cheek-bones, aquiline nose, and well-formed
chin were here given their full effect, as in this one figure the nose was
complete. Theright eye was hanging from its orbit; around the mouth
and eyes were few but deep wrinkles; and between the eyes the skin
was drawn into two heavy perpendicular folds, giving an expression of
agonizing pain.

The few simple lines by which this effect was produced showed in the
artist real strength, far removed from the elaborate but fantastic style
of conventional Copan.

The long ears were probably exaggerated in size by the heavy orna-
ments in the lower lobes. The head-dress was arranged in folds, and
secured by a band, marked with longitudinal and transverse lines, which
passed behind the ears and under the chin, well back against the
throat. On the upper left side was an elaborate bow, on which was a
circular ornament with graven outlines of eyes, nose, and mouth. On
top and a little to the left side of the head a small cap was jauntily
placed. The cap was one feature in the tout ensemble which gave this
more the look of a woman’s head.

The height was 23 inches.

The object of the sculptor in portraying these eyes as hanging from
their sockets is rather puzzling. It has been suggested that tearing
out the eyes was a mode of punishment among the ancients. But it re-
quired long time and much labor to carve one of these heads in hard
stone, with the tools at their command, and it does not seem likely that
such honor would have been shown to criminals. Don Manuel Herrera
thought tbat the fact that eye complaints were prevalent in that sec-
tion should be considered in the study of this subject. It seems as
likely as not that these were representations of individuals whose mis-
fortune was depicted in the sculptures, the artist adopting this mode
of indicating blindness.

Fic. 11.—Seculpture from Pantaleon, Guatemala.

In No. V, Fig. 11, we again had the head of an old man.

There were wrinkles on the venerable face around the mouth and
eyes and particularly strong on the brow. The supraorbital region
and cheek-bones were prominent, the mouth firm, and the large nose
was aquiline in form. The tip of the nose was broken.

In front and on top of the turban-like arrangement on the head a
broad sash or band was tied in a double bow-knot, the ends widening
and falling behind and to the lower edge of the ear on each side. The
“a0 ™ PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

little cap on the vertex was pretty well demolished. The beard-like ar-
rangement on the chin may have been intended to represent a chin-strap
as it passed up behind the ear-rings, and was apparently continuous with
the head-dress.

This is one of the most striking of the faces, and in a general collec-
tion would suggest the patriarch of Western Asia. Its height was 21
inches.

Fic. 12.—Sculpture from Pantaleon, Guatemala.

Fixed into the wall of the court, behind El Rey, was No. VI, shown in
Fig. 12. It was the roughest of the specimens, and without peculiar
features. The ear-rings were large, and on the cap a broken surface
showed where was probably a knot, as on No. IV.

Lying in the court-yard was arough representation of the head of a
wild-cat, and a skull somewhat similar to those in Habel’s drawings
from Sante Lucia and others at Copan.

These figures in simplicity and strength differ from all specimens of
ancient American sculpture we have seen pictured or described. They
stand as far apart from the grim statues of Nicaragua as from the fan-
tastic and hieroglyph-covered monoliths of Copan, and surely deserve
the careful consideration of American archeologists.

THE GUESDE COLLECTION OF ANTIQUITIES IN POINTE.A-
PITRE, GUADELOUPE, WEST INDIES.

By Oris T. MASON.
INTRODUCTION.

The stone implements and other objects described in these pages be-
long almost exclusively to the celebrated collection of M. Louis Guesde,
of Pointe-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe. M. Guesde is the son of M. Mathieu
Guesde, whose series of Carib stone implements attracted so much at-
tention in the Paris Exposition of 1867, and Louise Loyseau, a creole,
of Guadeloupe. He was born at Hamacas, Porto Rico, in 1844, but at
two years of age was brought by his parents to live at Pointe-a-Pitre.
From 1856 to 1867 M. Guesde pursued his studies in Paris and returned
to Pointe-a-Pitre as register to the minister of finance, in whose oftice he
is at present director of the third bureau. He has inherited from his
father his love for collecting the relics of the ancient Caribs, and for
nearly twenty years has been assiduous in his efforts. His duties call-
ing him to reside successively in various quarters of the island, he
profited by these opportunities to carry on his researches. ‘To his zeal
as collector M. Guesde fortunately adds the skill of the artist, and he
has prepared two albums of aquarelles, in natural size and color, of all
the types in his museum. One of these albums is in the Trocadero
Museum at Paris, the other has been kindly presented to the Smith-
sonian Institution at Washington. So life-like are these portraits that
one has no difficulty in imagining the objects before him.

In a former publication (Smithsonian Annual Report for 1876, pp.
372-393) a very large collection of somewhat similar objects, gathered
by Mr. George Latimer in Porto Rico, was described and some reflec-
tions indulged in respecting those who made them. Since that paper
appeared, Mr. E. F.im Thurn, of Georgetown, British Guiana, has given
great attention to this subject, and is the author of several illustrated
articles respecting the stone implements of the ancient Caribs. Without
entering into a discussion upon this subject, and taking for granted that
the Indians of the “ discovery” were sufficiently advanced in culture
to produce such works of art, we may better improve the present oppor-
tunity by instituting comparisons with well-known peoples.

It we would look for the evidence of the reappearance of similar forms
and customs in regions wide apart, we must search out those portions
of the earth that present the same general features, the same natural
materials, and the same external suggestions or motives. While the
similarities in art products which point to consanguinity of their makers
often thrive in quite contrary circumstances, so outlandish frequently

731
tae PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

as to seem like the distorted memory of a story, or little snatches ora
melody sung in a distant land, those similarities which indicate the
passing of a certain milestone of human progress are so nearly identical
that the older anthropologists were wont to believe that like effects
sprung from the same rather than from like causes.

Fortunately, there are two regions where the ground has not been so
denuded as to prevent our knowing a great deal about the primitive
inhabitants; where, also, the natural environment is so similar to that
of the West Indies as to lead us to anticipate even the discoverers of
their relics. These two areas are Oceanica and the Northwest coast of
America from Sitka to Vancouver Island. In the first-named area we
must include the Papuan, the Malay, and the Polynesian; in the sec-
ond, the Thlinkit, Haida, Chimsian, Kwakiui, Nutka, and Selish stocks.
We might also include the tribes of British Guiana and Venezuela,
which have been so exhaustively described by Schomburgh and im
Thurn.*

In all these regions we have: (1) Proximity to the sea, abounding in
edible marine animals; (2) abundance of the finest timber in the world
for savages to work upon; (3) lack of flint and plenty of volcanic and
metamorphic rocks susceptible of the highest polish; (4) almost entire
absence of clay or of some of the other natural resources for the man-
ufacture of fire-proof vessels.

In the descriptions which follow, frequent allusions will be made to
similar shapes in order to guess at the functions of M, Guesde’s speci-
mens. -

The editor of this monograph sincerely regrets that he has not the
specimens before him; but it was impossible to transport with safety so
many valuable objects to Washington, and equally impossible for the
editor to make the journey to Guadeloupe. Fortunately, M. Guesde
has painted in water-colors, with scrupulous care, all of the examples
figured, preserving both the color and the size. The omission of the
thickness would somewhat mar the description in many cases, were we not
familiar with the two typical forms of blades so frequently figured here.

A few objects not belonging to M. Guesde’s cabinet will be introduced
to throw light upon his figures and to supply omissions in West Indian
archeology.

The classification adopted here is for convenience of comparison, and
it may be that things with different function will be found side by side.

The nomenclature of the parts of stone implements is taken from John
Evans’ classic work, “Ancient Stone Implements of Great Britain.” An
ax when completed consists of haft and blade. The parts of the blade
are the head or butt; the neck, or groove; the body, having sides,
faces, and edge. When the hafting excavation is not encircling we
may have either lateral notches or facial grooves.

GUESDE COLLECTION OF ANTIQUITIES IN WEST INDIES. 733

The editor cannot conclude this introduction without paying the
highest tribute of praise to M. Guesde, who has, at great cost, brought
together so many wonderful specimens of ancient Carib art.

As a guide to the understanding of the true size of the specimens by
the drawings, a line is piaced by the side of each picture, and upon
these lines true inches on the specimens are indicated by dots. This
plan is resorted to because by photographic reductions exact propor-
tions are not always observed. Whatever reduction the camera makes
upon the drawing it will also make on the accompanying line, and the
inch spaces will be reduced accordingly.

M. Guesde gives the following bit of personal history concerning
these antiquities (pp. 53-60) :

From my youth I have always been deeply impressed with what I
have read about the Caribs. The sight of the stone objects which once
belonged to these primitive inhabitants of the Antilles produced an
indescribable impression on me.’

As years went by the stronger became my desire to collect together
all that the soil of Gaudeloupe might contain relating to the Caribs.

I accordingly went to work in the year 1866, and after eighteen years
of constant research, never allowing myself to be discouraged by any
difficulty, I have the satisfaction of being able to exhibit to ethnolo-
gists this collection, which I believe to be more complete than all others
now existing, in Paris as well as in America.

My collection includes roughly-worked stones indicating an industry
in its infancy ; and others, on the contrary, which are brought to such
a degree of perfection that it would be difficult to improve on them,
either in design or workmanship.

It is necessary to state the fact which permitted John Lubbock to
class the aboriginal inhabitants of the American islands among the
neolithic peoples; it is because the stone is always polished. There
is not a single relic formed solely by being chipped, for those rare
pieces (axes or chisels) which present such an appearance also have the
surface very well polished. Besides, these voleanic stones cannot be
worked by chipping, like flint, quartz, or obsidian.

We come across axes so small that we ask ourselves if they were not
used by pygmies, and these alongside of others so large and heavy
that we dream of Titans, and no longer of men like ourselves.

In addition to all these relics, which I have gathered from the ground
in all parts of the colony, both on the sea-shore and in the interior, and
at altitudes of from 200 to 900 meters, enormous stones covered with
strange designs are found, especially in a single quarter of Guadeloupe
proper. The dimensions of these stones vary considerably. In some
the drawings are so high up that it is diffieult to reach them; in others
they are near the ground or buried under the surface. ‘They are scat-
tered without order about the country and in the beds of the rivers.
At St. Vincent, also, the last refuge of the Caribs, stones with inserip-
tions on them are found in the beds of rivers.
134 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

It is now very difficult to find wrought stones in the ground. Here
and there the plow or the hoe turns up some occasional fragments.
These stones lie in fact in the arable layer or stratum, and this has been
so well worked that everything it contained has been brought to light.
New clearings alone would favor the collector. In the deep strata
would other things belonging to an earlier race be found? In the case
of Grande-Terre it would be impossible, for as soon as we have passed
the vegetable mold we reach calcareous rocks, Madreporic formations
containing numerous fossil shells and dog-fish, which preclude all idea
of the presence of man. It appears to me more probable in the case
of Guadeloupe, which is of more ancient formation, and which must at
all times have offered more resources to man.

However large may be the number and variety of the types which I
possess, I still consider my work incomplete.

It constitutes only the prolegomena of what I would wish to accom-
plish.

In the presence of this collection, one is led to ask if these wrought
stones are the work of the Yguiris or of the Caribs, or if they would
not belong to these two races. Weare in almost complete darkness on
this point. It is necessary to throw some light on the subject. This
could be done only by visiting all the Lesser Antilles, which were al-
ready occupied by the Caribs on the arrival of Columbus; the Greater
Antilles, from Porto Rico to Cuba; and Trinidad, which is but a frag-
ment recently detached from the continent; by gathering carefully in
each island all the wrought stones which would certainly be found there;
by studying with the utmost care the inscribed stones; by classifying
separately the inscriptions and relics according to locality, and finally
by comparing the whole together in order to determine the points of
relationship.

Having completed this first labor in the Greater and Lesser Antilles,
it would be necessary to collect together the relics from the soil of
Guiana, and, taking them as types, to compare them with those of each
Antille separately. Then only could we come to some conclusion. We
would have laid open to us, in fact, the now silent history of these
aboriginal inhabitants.

I have been able to obtain some pieces from Porto Rico, as follows:
Ist. Celts of all sizes, in general well polished, but some with a fine
brilliant glazing. 2d. A mortar representing a bat—a very curious
piece which must have required long months of labor. 3d. An idol
representing a man lying on his belly, and supporting a mountain on
his back. A very remarkable peculiarity is that the legs are bent as
if in the act of swimming. I think that this idol is the personification
of some marine deity, protector of an island. 4th. An enormous
necklace, covered with inscriptions on one of its lower surfaces. This
necklace was evidently slung over the shoulder like a hunting-horn.
5th. The lower part of another necklace, but without any inscription.
6th. A small netting-needle. 7th. Some remains of pottery (heads of
w
GUESDE COLLECTION OF ANTIQUITIES IN WEST INDIES. 735

men and monkeys modeled with great boldness, evidently forming cup-
handles) and the upper rim of a cup which must have been of great
diameter. Some of these fragments of pottery still bear traces of a
fine red glazing.

I must acknowledge that during two sojourns at Porto Rico—one of
six and the other of two months—I never came across an ax. More-
over there is not a single ax in the superb collection presented to the
museum at Washington by Mr. G. Latimer, and which is entirely from
Porto Rico. The abundance of axes in the Lesser Antilles and their
complete absence in Porto Rico would seem to indicate a difference of
race in the inhabitants of these different islands.

I have been able to obtain five perfect celts and four fragments from
Martinique, one single celt—but very remarkable for form and polish—
from Dominica, two celts and three axes from St. Lucia, and one celt
from Santo Domingo (the Hispaniola of Columbus).

No typical difference can be established between the celts, whether
they come from Porto Rico or from Martinique, Guadeloupe, Dominica,
and St. Lucia.

Now, since the strata of the Lesser Antilles do not contain the mate-
rial used in some of these celts, it is certain that they were not made
where they were found. Should we not, therefore, infer from this that
they all have the same origin, that they all come from the continent or
from the Greater Antilles?

I have in my possession a club (baton) from the Galibis of Dutch
Guiana. This club has a certain age. The wood, of a red color when
freshly cut, has assumed a very deep black hue; the cotton thread
around the handle is very dirty. The weapon has seen service. This
club is exactly like those used by the Caribs of the islands, and which
Father Dutertre has described, but the peculiar part of it, the thing
that gives it an enormous interest, is the green celt fixed in its lower
extremity. Now, this celt resembles all those which I have found in
Guadeloupe and the other islands. Is it of modern manufacture? Is
it not rather the work of the first inhabitants of the continent? Has it
not been found in the soil and used by its discoverer? I would decide
without hesitation in favor of the latter hypothesis, for it is covered
with a patina which only a long continuance in the soil could give it.

Here is another fact which seems to prove that the Caribs of Colum-
bus and of Father Dutertre are the same as those of Guiana.

The exterior distinguishing color is not always that of the stone of
which they are made. The color, which is black, red, yellow, brown,
or bluish, partakes essentially of that of the soil trom which they were
taken. Those from Grande-Terre, whose calcareous soil is covered with
a thin layer of black and compact vegetable earth, all have the colors
more or less dark—brown, red, black—while those from Guadeloupe
proper, whose soil is covered with a thick layer of more or less ferru-
ginous red earth, have the tints lighter. Yellow specimens are numer-
ous there. Many of them have preserved their normal tint. These
736 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

are the ones found near rivers. Continually washed by their waters,
they have not acquired the coating of rust with ek those buried in
the ground are covered.

So true is the above that every fresh break shows the interior of the
stone to be of a different color from the exterior.

All these rocks are voleanic, and are naturally either black, blue, or
green.

This peculiarity does not generally exist in polished celts. The glaz-
ing has unalterably fixed the color of the stone. They have, in conse-
quence, remained free from all oxidation, and appear as if just from the
hands of the workman.

Aves.—Axes are more numerous than all the other pieces. That may
be easily understood, the ax being of prime utility to man. Some are
long and narrow, others short and wide. Some are very flat, others
very thick. Some are very small, while others are of enormous size and
weight.. I have two weighing, respectively, 4 kilograms, 750 grams,
and 4 kilograms, 775 grams. Some are of very simple construction,
merely the natural stone of appropriate form, which a little working
transformed into an instrument; while others, on the contrary, are true
masterpieces, which will bear comparison with those found in Denmark
only. The latter are very rare. They were evidently used for purposes
of parade, for it cannot be allowed that the author of such a work
would have exposed it to be broken at the first shock, thus losing the
product of the labor of several months, I might even say of several years.

The ax admits of four distinct parts—the head, the neck, the blade,
the cutting edge.

The head is sometimes round, sometimes flat, sometimes very small,
sometimes as large as the blade. Some axes have one or several trans-
verse grooves, some have none at all, others a single longitudinal groove.
The last are very rare. Pierced axes are very rare. The holes served,
if they offer any assistance, to fasten the stone to the handle; if not, to
suspend ornaments. The head played an important part in attaching
the ax to the handle, for there can be no doubt that all these axes had
handles. The small as well as the large ones were fixed on a wooden
handle by means of cords made of cotton or mohot.

The neck is more or less lengthened. Sometimes it is formed by lat-
eral notches only, but generally by a circular depression.

The blade varies considerably in form, length, and thickness. There
is no proportion between it and the other two parts.

The edge is more or less distinct. In some axes it is so perfect that
one would think they had been sharpened the day before.

I have three double-edged axes—two of moderate size, the other very
small. I have four axes of which the head is prolonged into a long
tail, and which resemble (one of them especially) that which has been —
termed Montezuma’s ax. I have also a certain number, both small and
very large, with a slight but decided protuberance on the lower part of
GUESDE COLLECTION OF ANTIQUITIES IN WEST INDIES. 737

one side of the cutting edge, which suggests the idea of a tool appro-
priated to some special purpose. Finally, I have some axes with the
blade curved like that of a cimeter. These are rare.

Celts —Celts vary much in form, size, and color. Some are slender
with a sharp point, others are massive with a blunt point; some are
broad and flat, others narrow and deep; some reach enormous propor-
tions, while others are very much reduced in size.

Celts are scarcer than axes in Guadeloupe. Most of them are made
of a handsomer, harder material than that used for axes, such as ser-
pentine, jade, or jadite. The fine glazing of the stone, also, is found
only in celts. I have some, large and small, made of the volcanic stone
used ordinarily for axes. These are very well polished, but not glazed.
This handsome glazing gives an exalted idea of the industry of these
savages, for it could not be done better in our days.

The Caribs made use of the living forces of nature to fix the celts on
the wood. But to introduce a celt into a young tree and let the tree
grow till the resistance was sufficient, required many years. I believe,
therefore, that they rarely had recourse to this process. They evi-
dently followed the same method employed by the Canaques and other
savages of the present century ignorant of the use of metals, whose
celts do not differ from those found in our islands. This method con-
sisted in fixing the stone by the aid of very fine cords in a socket pre-
pared in the wooden handle.

I must not forget to mention the shell celts. These are not made of
living shell, which would not have been hard enough for the purpose,
but of fossil shell. They are very rare. They were extracted from the
outer edge of the Strombus gigas, very common in the Caribbean Sea.

It is to be supposed that the glazed celts were rather warlike weapons
than instruments of labor, for they offer more resistance in proportion
to their size, and we know besides that the savages used in war what-
ever had most value in theireyes. The very large-sized celts must have
served as wedges in splitting trunks of trees.

Casse-tétes.—The casse-téte type is furnished by a stone, either round
or with bilateral facets, in the center of which is a more or less deep
groove for the wooden handle. One can easily conceive the power of
such a weapon wielded by a muscular arm in hand-to-hand combat.

Some are more perfect in form than others. Every one was free to
fashion so important a weapon as best suited him.

But what astonishes the observer is the small size of one of these
relics. Evidently it could have been only an amulet, worn with the
idea of preserving its owner from the blows of the weapon it represented.

Other casse-tétes were used without handles. Only two types figure
in my collection. This weapon had not the value of the preceding.

Pestles, grinders.—Pestles and grinders are of various forms and sizes.
My collection includes a certain number of them. I possess a single

specimen, which was used with both hands.

Mortars.—Mortars are not very numerous. This is explained by the
fact that any hard stone which was flat and smooth would take their
place. The complete mortar could have been only an article of luxury
belonging to a cacique.

Shall I designate as mortar that rounded concave stone with regular
grooves descending from the central point to therim? Although quite
hollow on its lower surface, [ do not think it could have been anything
but the lid of a large vase, grooved or fluted in like manner. In fact
this mortar would have had no fixed position. It could not remain
stationary in the position necessary to make use of it. Or should we
not rather think that the maker of this piece wished to represent a mili-
form cactus so common in the Antilles? And in this case should we not
rather class it among the idols? (Fig. 172.)

Dishes.—There are but two dishes in my collection: 1st. A large one
of rude workmanship. The concavity only is polished; the exterior
rough and very irregular. 2d. A small one of very remarkable finish.
It is in fact very well polished on all its inner and outer surfaces.

Harpoon.—One single harpoon, slightly broken at the three extremi-
ties. The absent parts can, however, easily be restored in following
the lines traced on the body of the piece. This instrument is very
remarkable.

Hooks.—I have two hooks very different in form. Both are a little
broken, but easy to reconstruct by following the method indicated

. above.

Awls.—Awls are rare. My collection includes only two of them, but
I must state that the material employed is harder than that of the
ordinary tools and instruments.

Chisels.—Chisels are numerous and of various forms and sizes. The
basil of the cutting-edge is perfect. Some of them are made of the
saine material used in the fine celts, and, like the latter, have the
handsome glazing mentioned above.

Vases.—I have only two vases. One is of guaiacum. The handle is
perfectly isolated from the body of the vase. This piece is of very great
interest. As the guaiacum is incorruptible, we need not be surprised
that it has come down to us. It was found at Bertram Creek, the last
quarter of Guadeloupe inhabited by the Caribs. Its edges are worn
and hacked, and bear evidence of having been a long time in the earth.
I have seen a small tortoise of the same wood found in a cave at St.
Vincent.

The other in my possession is of stone. It is an astonishing piece
from its general regularity and its contour.

Shall I class among the vases that small cup with a rather long
spout? It rather resembles a spoon, and I think that it might be des-
ignated as such, taking into consideration the break, which leads us to
suppose that a prolongation forming a handle formerly existed.
GUESDE COLLECTION OF ANTIQUITIES IN WEST INDIES. 739

Netting-needles.—There is one small netting-needle, very well made
and very regular, which evidently served to net cotton, and two other
larger, more massive ones, which served to prepare cords.

Idols.—The idols are six in number.

Ist. One representing a man extended on his back, the legs bent
under him, the arms applied to the chest, the head covered with a cap,
the sexual organs very conspicuous. It is well finished and must have
cost years of diligent labor. (Fig. 200).

2d. One representing a man on one face and a monkey on the other,
is very interesting (Fig. 210). It was found at Matouba. The work
on this statuette is rude. The hand that made it was wanting in skill.
But what shall we say of the genius which inspired this combination of
man and monkey? Should we not consider Darwin only a plagiarist ?

3d. Another found in Guadeloupe, of the same type as that from
Porto Rico, but much larger and so rough that it cannot be determined
what it represents. The under surface is slightly concave.

4th. A small granite pyramid, with three grooves or furrows on its
lower part. It was found on the island of Désirade.

5th. A head with two faces surmounted by a Phrygian cap. This
head was to be fixed on another stone or a piece of wood forming the
body of the idol, for it is much too heavy to admit of the supposition
that it was carried in the hand. I have vainly searched for this com-
plemental lower portion at the place where I found the head.

With this last idol we must place an ax and one other piece, both
having lines identical with those of the idol head. I think they repre-
sent faces.

Amulets.—The principal amulet is of carbonate of lime in bladed
crystallization. It represents a maboya (evil spirit) with bended arms
and legs, and the virile organ in a state of action. The shoulders are
pierced posteriorly to allow of the suspension of the amulet. The
other amulets are medallions of different sizes, more or less round, all
pierced with a small hole to admit of suspension. I have a single
small crescent of stone, an evident representation of the caracoli of
metal. This crescent must have been set in wood, unless it was pro-
vided with a cotton string terminating at each extremity in a small
cord for suspension.

Disks or quoits.—I have six disks, large and small. One especially
is a very remarkable piece of work. There is no doubt about the
determination of these relics. The Caribs played quoits.

Edicule-—A small monument having handles on each side, on top of
the handles a platform disappearing under a vault. There is a hole in
the middle, presumably the place for an idol. This relic is very curious,
and reminds one of the Mexican teocalli. (Fig. 194).

Chisels of shell—Besides. the various stone tools, my collection in-
cludes a series of very fine chisels extracted from the outer edge of the
740 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

Strombus gigas. This part of the shell is very thick and harder than
stone. It is certain that the Caribs did not use the living Strombus,
but were careful to take the fossil Strombi, which had in time acquired
the hardness of ivory.

Stone for making axes.—I have in my possession a very interesting
stone, which has inscribed on it the use for which it was intended. It
has concavities on three of its surfaces. It is evidently a kind of
grind-stone, on which stones were rubbed in order to shape them.

Since writing the above, I have had the good fortune to discover in
Grande-terre, in a piece of ground which had not been plowed for 60
or 80 years, two tools of flaked flint—a knife and hacking-knife. This
discovery somewhat modifies the theory held to this day by writers on
America that flaked flint does not exist in the Antilles.

It is very evident however that these two flints were not dug from
the soil of the island and then flaked by their possessor, for this stone
does not exist in Grande-terre or Guadeloupe in a state of nature.

These two flaked flints establish, in an irrefutable manner, the fact
of a migration of men from the valleys of the Orinoco towards the
islands.

I. UNPOLISHED IMPLEMENTS.

These do not form a class apart, but they are exceedingly useful as
showing the method of blocking out the more elaborate implements,
when nature has not supplied a polished pebble sufficiently near to the

desired pattern. The three methods of chipping, picking, and grinding
are all outlined in this group (Figs. 1-8).

very much like our handwriting; we try to imitate certain copies, but
we only preserve the type while we stamp our own individualities upon
them. All sorts of pebbles lie at the hand of the savage mechanie,
none of them just what he wants. He selects the best and founds a
new type for the learned archeologists. A collection of pebbles from
the West Indies would be very instructive in showing just how far
nature had been the draughtsman and the teacher of the aboriginal
artisan. This implement, though rude, shows much use, and rather
hints that fine polish is evidence of age and much use in many cases.

Length, 6 inches; greatest width, 34.

II. POLISHED BLADES WITHOUT HAFT-GROOVES.

The typical ‘‘ celt” of the West Indies is the almond-shaped variety,
called “ petaloid” by Mr. im Thurn, so distinctly recognizable that
John Evans receives an alleged Scottish specimen of the same shape
with suspicion. But this petaloid or almond variety runs into other
forms, notably what we might call the Papuan type. The petaloid
type was doubtless inserted or ‘“ perserted”; but’ the flatter Papuan
form was always inserted, and served with sennit or other twine. The
hafts also were of different shapes; that of the former was straight,
that of the latter lambdoidal. In certain portions of the Antilles the
greatest abundance of shell chisels are found, and it would not be mar-
velous to discover in stone implements a close resemblance to some of
these.

When we remember that we are speaking of a maritime people who
had the greatest abundance of ship timber at hand and leisure to work
it, and that they had the very best voleanic rocks to convert into imple-
ments, we have only to turn either to New Guinea or Queen Charlotte
os

Islands to reconstruct in part the lost social fabric of those who used M.
Guesde’s stone adze blades.

The Caribs had two kinds of boats—a very large canonia and a small
couliala, both dug out of a single trunk. The former attained a length
of 40 feet and were 7 or 8 feet wide. They could carry fifty persons
with arms and baggage, and were worked with oars and sails. The
coulialas were not more than 20 feet long and 3 or 4 wide; they were
propelled with paddles. The Indians of the Northwest Coast have the
same distinction of dug-outs. In the National Museum at Washington
may be seen both the immense family boat, over 60 feet long, and the
smaller, more shapely whaleboat, about 12 feet long, from the same
people, carved from the Thuja gigantea.

age origin. These specimens would be considered unique in any area of
lithic culture, and certainly the West Indies have produced no others
similar. (See Timehri 1, p. 265, 1-7.)

mon in the West Indies, and occurs very frequently in Costa Rica. The
bent butt of the blade is a very common feature in shell blades. Per-
haps the only truth about the shape is that the savage found it so and
let it stay.

Length, 4;% inches; greatest width, 1,5 inches.

III. FACES CONTINUOUS, SIDES INCURVED OR NOTCHED.

The next type which is to be considered is that in which the faces are
continuous from the edge to the opposite extremity, but the sides, near
the butt, have been modified in various ways, apparently to aid in haft-
ing. The butt, or head, also passes through a variety of modifications,
almost as numerous as the proximal end of leaves. Such implements or
forms have a certain number of possibilities. They may have been fell-
ing axes, hoes, adzes, battle-axes, ceremonial axes, or simply works of
art. That is to say, similar objects have been found performing these
functions in different parts of the world. Reverting to our typical areas
we are at a loss to proceed. The Haida do not use implements of these
shapes; the Mound Builders did, however, and many of this class can be
duplicated in our collections.

concavities at the sides and a very slight pecking on the faces. The
edge is much broken, and large fractures on the sides, as well as the
weathering, give to the implement the appearance of great age. This
form is very common throughout the United States, especially in those
areas where the aborigines were agriculturists.

IV. BUTT DISTINCT, FACES NOT CONTINUOUS.

The next form of blade to be considered is that in which the butt or

head is distinct. This implies a more definite hafting-space, an encir-
cling groove or neck of some kind rather than antero-posterior notches
or concavities. It will be seen by running along the members of this
section that there are gradations of form, and that this idea of a sepa-
rate butt is not co-ordinated with any especial kind of haft-space, sides,
faces, or edge. Commencing with the simplest type of ax, we pass

through one series of forms to the graceful patu-patu; through another,
shouldered variety, to the chopper-knife pattern.

It must be repeated that no such designs of classification are here
attributed to the ancient Antillians. They may or may not have been
dominated by them. We are only looking at three forces compounding
and resolving to bring about a great variety of results, according to
the influence of each in any example. These forces are the nature and
original form of the pebble, the type-form into whose neighborhood the
artist aimed to come, and that sense and pride of achievement which
rules in the savage and civilized bosom alike.

fact that on the coast of New Zealand extensive layers of flat and blade-

the fabrication of hatchets, knives, and other implements. No less true
is it that in the West Indies, where no calcareous flint occurs, “ Nature,

utilize the materials at hand for their convenience and happiness. The

V. BLADES WITH HOOKED EDGES. ~

In the small series of blades now to be presented, a characteristic
previously noticed as being more or less apparent in the work of those °
barbaric peoples who work without compass or rule, will be brought
more prominently into view. Indeed, to use the language of biology,
varietal marks become fixed and specific. Another wonderful law of
biology is also noticeable. . It is this, that no part of a structure can
undergo any great modification without profoundly affecting many
other parts. Nature has changed her key-note and the whole com-
position must be played on another scale. It is hard to guess what
this bill-hook form in so many bladescan signify. In vain we turn to
Polynesia or Queen Charlotte Sound for help. In higher civilization
the bill-hook does good service, first in the hands of the soldier, then in
those of the hedger. Coming to view in this Carib environment we are
left to wonder. Most of M. Guesde’s specimens of this class are very
large, massive indeed, and most carefully polished. We shall be able to
show a gradation of form beginning with suggestion and ending with
unmistakable reality.

VI. BLADES WITH ENCIRCLING GROOVES.

The next type of blades embraces many examples in the Antillian

area, extending from a very rude form to some of the greatest beauty.
The encircling grooves or excavations for hafting in a large series of
stone implements will be found to include many geometric figures in
other parts of the implements, such as the circle, ellipse, vesica piscis,
and any of these may have one or two truncations. The grooves will
also differ in their position on the blade, in depth, width, and the con-
struction and parallelism of their borders. In the series of hafted ham-
mers, hoes, adzes, and axes in the National Museum at Washington,
one can readily perceive that even the savage workman was not shut
up to a single device in hafting his tools. Indeed, such is the diversity
of methods that one familiar with a large number of specimens learns
to pick out localities and nations by the methods used.

Another fact illustrated in this series is the easy transition from use-
ful to highly ornamental forms. Beginning, as Klemm has advised us,
with little modified pebbles, we culminate in examples wherein every
vestige of nature and use is lost.

Fig. 89. A small blade of blackish color. The very least opportunity
is afforded for hafting, but we may refer again to John Evans. Marie-

the groove is rectangular. The same idea of a shoulder on one side of

England. This latter one, however, is very rude, and far behind the
Guesde’s example. (Evans’ “Ancient Stone Implements,” Fig. 82.)

VII. HAMMERS, GRINDERS, AND POLISHERS.

In most archeological collections a series of implements are brought
together under the titles given above. The idea or concept is that
pounding, grinding, rolling or mulling-food, paint, incense, wedges, or
human heads, are processes that have no broad dividing lines. Indeed,
among a people so highly civilized as the ancient Antillians a great
variety of such operations would be performed. Mr. im Thurn thinks
that since these people were mainly cassava eaters they had little need
of mills. True, but grinding is not confined to food even. The Haida
and Thlinkit Indians make beautiful mortars and pestles to grind a
native tobacco into snuff, and to pulverize dried fish. The Pueblos
use grinders for corn and wild seeds, for paint, and to grind up de-
graissant for their pottery. The innumerable uses of hammers will
occur to every one. The order followed in the description is almost
arbitrary, the prevailing motive being to proceed from less to greater
completeness.

wedges split the logs into planks to be used in their houses and furni-

says Dr. Washington Matthews, at the present day play with the in-
tensest excitement a game called “turkey claw.” Two players contend
in the following manner: Each one is provided with a pole, twice a
man’s span in length, consisting of two parts lashed together by a long
leather thong, either end of which hangs loose for about a yard. At
distances of nearly a foot on these loose ends are sewed crosswise simi:
lar leather thongs so that there seems to be two tassels of five strands
each. At a given signal a ring, made by wrapping rawhide strings
around a hoop, until it becomes very thick and heavy, is rolled along
the ground. The players aim to throw their spears so that the ring in
falling will gather up and become entangled with several of the leather
strands. The number and position of strands lying on the ring enables
the players to decide the game. ‘There is no reason why such a disk
Should not be thus used. The statement made by writers that the pole
should pierce the ring is not strictly true.

obverse is slightly concave and bordered by a molding which is ear:
ried nearly to the narrow portion. The latter is lingulate in form and
has ten concentric ridges terminating in the border which is fluted ex-
ternally. There is no duplicate of this form.

It is hollow like a mortar, but the most remarkable feature about it is

ence to this opinion it is drawn with the broad part downward.

VIII. PERFORATED STONES.

The perforation of stone by the American aborigines has been faith-
fully studied by Dr. Charles Rau and others. When the boring is for a
short distance two conical excavations are made from opposite sides, mak-
ing a cavity shaped like an hour-glass. The process of boring a similar
hole is commonly called countersinking. The West Indians as well as
other aborigines of our continent also understood how to produce long
excavations through very hard material, but never with the uniformity
of a steel drill. One of the best tests of genuine relics of this class is
the method of perforation.

IX. ORNAMENTAL FORMS.

In this group have been brought
together those specimens in which
ornament is of more importance than
use. They are not all made of stone,
and a few of them are not in M.
Guesde’s collection. The last named
have come into the National Museum
since the description of the Latimer
collection in 1876. (Smithsonian Re-
port, 1876, p. 372-393.) It is not to
be supposed that the makers designed
any such division of their artefacts.

Fig. 193. The object sketched in this figure resembles some of the
plainest specimens of mammiform stones from Porto Rico, in the Lat-
imer collection. (Smithonian Report, 1876.) No head or legs are indi-
cated in the projections from the base. The lower face, not seen in the
drawing, is concave and there is a hole in the apex. On either face of
the mamma are distinct ridges. Mr. im Thurn figures one of these ob-
jects and calls attention to examples from San Domingo in Blackmore
Museum. His own specimen is described as having animal heads at
either end. This does not correspond with the one in the Latimer series,
in each of which there is a head at one end and feet at the other. Their
use as stools is very questionable, because that would bring the unsightly
portion upward and bury the ornamental portion out of sight. The
owner of the small island of Canouan, says Mr. Low, has a mammiform
resembling Fig. 42, Latimer collection, with carved lines like those on
Fig. 43. (See also Timehri, 1, 268, 269.)

object was found at Abymes, but the evidence of aboriginal origin
should be strong just in comparison to the outlandishness of a specimen.

This being on the left, the ornamental panel is on the right. The ele-
ments of this panel are not unique. Notice first the beading looped on
the right side at the top of the panel, and widening downward to in-
close the key ornaments and to pass quite around the boss below. The
border on the edge outside and in front of this bead has a human face
between two opposing scrolls. The bas-relief ornament inside the bead
consists of a double ring in relief, with two ornaments as nearly alike
as the varying space would admit.

The shoulder projection, the looped
bead, with its herring-bone ridges,
inclosing triangular excavations, the
boss, and the slight ornament on the
shouldered side are all well expressed.
Although both these are left-shoul-
dered, there are many right-shoul-
dered ones, plainly showing that they
were to be used in pairs.

scribed, however, is either sandstone

mal form. In M. Guesde’s specimen
the material is a dark brown volcanic
- stone, and the device is the human
-form. Moreover, the position is in-
verted. The man is lying on his
back, with his feet drawn up to form
the legs of the stool. His arms, with-
out any attempt at accuracy of delin-
.eation are doubled on his neck. The
eyes and mouth are like the saine
features in all aboriginal statuary,
and beautiful shells were doubtless

serted plugs of wood, stone, shell, or feathers. The legs of the

chair, just beneath the man’s shoulders, are mere projections from the ~

stone. The markings in the head and forehead are quite tastefully de-
signed. The back does not slope upward as much as in the Latimer
specimens. In Dr. Liborio Lerda’s ** Eldorado” is figured a mummified
human body seated on a stone stool in a cist. The figure in this paper
and notes of im Thurn ( Timehri, 1, 271) should be consulted. The im-
possibility of using such objects as mealing stones was pointed out by
the author of these notes ten years ago, and im Thurn adds the very
pertinent argument that the ancient West Indians did not grind maize,
subsisting mainly on cassava. Dr. Joseph Jones quotes Sheldon as
saying, ‘*When a Carib died his body was placed in the grave in an
attitude resembling that in which they crouched around the fire or the
table when alive, with the elbows on the knees and the palms of the
hands against the cheeks.”

ANCIENT MOUNDS IN CLINTON COUNTY, MICHIGAN.
By M. L. Leacu, of Traverse City, Mich.

Clinton County, occupying a central position in the Lower Peninsula
of Michigan, is one of the most fertile portions of the State. The
northern part of it is watered by the Maple River and its tributaries.
The Maple is a small, sluggish stream. Rising in the central part of
Shiawassee County, it takes a northwesterly course through the town-
ships of Owosso and Middlebury, in Shiawassee, and Ovid, in Clinton;
turns sharply to the northeast, then to the west, and finally to the
north in the township of Duplain; crosses the boundary into Gratiot
County, runs a westerly course for 13 miles, and re-enters Clinton near
the northwest corner of the township of Essex.

It is only of the townships of Middlebury, Ovid, Duplain, Greenbush,
and Essex that we have to speak in these notes. All the five town-
ships lie wholly within the Maple River Valley. The surface of the
country is gently undulating. There are no high hills or deep valleys.

The land slopes down to the margins of the streams, generally with-
out any well-marked terraces. There are some extensive swamps and
marshes. The soil of the higher lands is a rich, sandy loam, easily cul-
tivated, adapted to general farming, and remarkably well suited to the
production of the cereals. When first settled by the white men, large
portions were covered with heavy forests of oak, maple, elm, beech,
basswood, and ash, with patches of pine interspersed; other parts were
what is there called plains, being comparatively level, with an open for-
est consisting almost wholly of oak.

The Maple River Valley was the seat of a populous settlement of the
Mound Builders. Their remains consist principally of burial mounds.
These stretch in an irregular line, in a northwesterly course, from the
township of Middlebury, through the most fertile part of the valley, to
the northwestern part of Essex. The accompanying map is sufficiently
accurate for practical purposes. I have taken great pains to ascertain
the position of most of the mounds relative to the lines of the Govern-
ment survey. When the location is given without qualification, it may
be relied on as correct.

The mound on the southeast quarter of the southeast quarter sec-
tion 36, in Ovid, marked 17, has entirely disappeared pero the

march of the white man’s improvement. Mr. Hugh Swarthout, of
Ovid, from whom I have the account, says it was 30 feet across at the
base and as high as a man’s head. Forty-three or forty-four years ago,
he, with others, dug down in the center of it, and found bones at or near
the natural surface of the ground. A tibia taken out was at least 6
inches longer than that of a man 6 feet high. The bones were all
large. Though Mr. Swarthout is reliable, itis not safe to trust reports
of big bones and other wonders, as I have learned by experience.

About the location of the mound there is no doubt.

Of the group of mounds in Middlebury I cannot give the exact
location. I visited them once when called to the neighborhood on
business, but took no notes. There were six or seven of them, all of
which had been leveled by several years’ use of the plow and harrow,
but the site of each was still plainly discernible at a long distance.

From this group, passing down the Maple 2 or 3 miles, we come to an-
other interesting group, marked 15 on the map, on the farm of Malcolm
Fitch, about 1 mile east of the village of Ovid. In July, 1878, I
visited this group, in company with my friend the late W. S. Trask,
of Charlotte, Mich. With the assistance of Mr. Fitch’s son, I took
some rough measurements while Mr. Trask was sketching. There
were six of the mounds, situated on level, sandy land, in a beautiful
grove. The largest was 34 feet in diameter at the base, circular, and
well rounded up. It was 4 feet high, but the height may have been some-
what increased by the earth thrown out of an excavation in the center
by some explorer. A portion of a tree which had grown on the mound
was still lying upon it. It was 2 feet or more in diameter. Mr. Fitch
said it must have fallen down before he came to the place, twenty-seven
years previously. Southeast of this first mound, at a distance of 18
feet from its base, we came to the base of another. It was somewhat
irregular in shape, being 50 feet long from east to west, 30 feet broad,
and from 24 to 3 feet high. Mr. Trask suggested that the two mounds
were part of a natural ridge, and that the earth from the space between
them had been removed and added to the northwestern extremity of
the ridge to complete the first mound, leaving the remaining portion of
the ridge with the appearance of an artificial structure—an opinion with
which I do not coincide. Measuring 90 feet from the eastern base of
the second mound, in a southeast direction, we came to the base of
the third. This mound was irregularly oval in outline, being 30 feet
long from north to south, 25 wide, and 2 feet 3 inches high. Growing
on top was a white-oak tree 2 feet 3 inches in diameter, 3 feet from the
ground. Trees of various sizes, but smaller than this, were growing
upon the mounds already described. Southeast from this third mound
we came toa fourth. From an omission in my notes, I am unable to
give the distance. It may have been anywhere from 20 to 100 feet.
On account of the same omission, I am unable to draw a plan of the
group. The mound was small, and flat. Twenty feet southwest of
842 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

it was another small, flat mound, and 180 feet northeast of No. 2 was
another of the same character. My recollection is that none of this
group except No. 1 had ever been disturbed. It is a matter of regret
that I did not have an opportunity to make internal explorations of
the more important ones.

In the western part of what is now the village of Ovid there formerly
existed a group of small burial mounds, marked on the map. They
were long since destroyed by the cultivation of the land. I have an
account of them from Mr. Dennis Birmingham, of Ovid Township, who
is not unfamiliar with the works of the Mound Builders, and would not
be likely to be deceived.

Continuing on down the Maple, in a north westerly direction, some-
thing like a mile and a half, we come to the site of two small mounds,
marked 2. The location is 30 or 40 rods west of the center of section 11.
They are situated on a tract of rich, loamy soil, with a mixture of fine
gravel, heavily -timbered with several varieties of forest trees. The
tract slopes gently down from higher land at the north till it blends
with the Maple River bottom at the south. At the west it terminates
in a bank or bluff about 12 feet high, 50 or 60 paces distant from the
larger mound. At the foot of the bank is an ancient channel of the
river, with low, wet bottom land beyond. It is not improbable that the
river flowed through this channel at the time the country was oceupied
by the Mound Builders, though it is now found some distance farther
southwest. The larger mound, measured by the eye, at the time of my
visit was not more than 16 feet in diameter and 2 feet high. There
was a Shallow trench all around its base, from which, no doubt, a por-
tion of the earth for its construction had been taken. Excavations had
already been made in both mounds. In the vicinity of the mounds were
a large number of ‘‘dug-holes.” They were generally circular, some of
them having a raised margin made by the earth thrown out, while around
others the ground was level up to the very brim, as if the excavated
earth had been carried away to did in the construction of the mounds.
Perhaps those with raised margins may have been made by the modern
Indians for burying their corn. Possibly the Mound Builders also
buried their corn in the same manner. It is not always easy to distin-
guish between the dug-holes of the Indians and those of the more ancient
people.

Continuing down the valley of the Maple, in a direction almost due
northwest, for a little more than 2- miles, we come to the site of the
mound marked 3, on the northeast quarter of the northeast quarter
section 4. This mound has disappeared in the process of cultivation.
Mr. Gleason, the owner of the farm, describes it as 16 feet broad and 2
feet high. I remember that many years ago, when hunting there, while
Mr. Gleason’s farm was still a forest, the deer I was tracking walked
over this mound, and I stood for some time on its summit, peering into
the surrounding forest for signs of the game. My attention had not at

neti cla

that time been called to the works of the Mound Builders, and I did
not recognize the real character of the curious little hill 1 stood upon.
My recollection of it is that Mr. Gleason’s estimate of its diameter is
correct, but that it was fully 3 feet high. Mr. Gleason and others dug
into it and took out a skull. They saw a large quantity of bones.

Going again to the northwest, at the distance of something more than
half a mile, we come to an interesting group of mounds, marked 4, on
the east part of the east half of the southwest quarter section 33, in
Duplain. Leaving out of the account several small, slight elevations
about the character of which there was doubt, this group consisted of
four well-defined mounds. The largest one was oblong in shape, being
25 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 24 or 3 feet high. Lying south of this,
their bases almost touching, was another oblong mound, 23 feet high,
22 feet long from east to west, and 14 wide. Southwest from the prin-
cipal mound, distant 20 feet, was the third one, 3 feet high, 25 feet long
from north to south, and 15 feet wide. All around these three the earth
appeared to have been scooped out for the purpose of building them.
The fourth mound of the group stood apart from the others, about 16
rods distant, in a southwesterly direction. It had been opened, and it
was said that bones had been taken out. It was circular, 20 feet broad
at the base and 3 feet high.

In 1877 and 1878 I made thorough examinations of the three mounds
situated near together. The largest one was nearly all dug away, and
a broad trench, reaching down below the natural surface of the ground,
was carried threugh each of the others in its long diameter. In all
three, with the exception of a surface layer a foot. thick. the soil, a
gravelly loam, was extremely hard and apparently impervious to water.
It was the opinion of Mr. Trask, as well as of myself, that it had been
rammed hard around and above the bodies. Forming an impenetrable
protection to the bones, it has, in a great degree, preserved them from
decay. In two or three cases the periosteum was found still adhering
to its bone.

In the large mound were found six skeletons, besides some scattering
fragments. Each of two lay alone; the other four were in pairs. In the
case of one of those buried singly, as nearly as could be determined,
the body had been laid on the back, the head to the east, the legs flexed
under the thighs so that the heels were near the pelvis, and the head
raised in such a position that, as the bones settled together in the proc-
ess of decay, it rested on the left shoulder-blade. It has occurred to
me since that it may have been buried ina partly sitting posture. The
other skeleton that lay alone had been carefully disposed for burial.
It had been placed in a shallow, short grave (before the mound was
built), with the face to the north, the head to the east, the legs and
thighs flexed as much as possible, with the head a little elevated. One
pair had evidently been as carefully placed, with the thighs and legs
flexed in the same manner, with the heads to the east, one looking north
844 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

and the other south. The bones were in such close proximity that the
backs of the heads and bodies must have touched. The order and regu-
larity of this burial produced the conviction that the two bodies were -
buried at the same time. The position of the other pair could not be
satisfactorily made out, but one skull lay above the other. All these
graves were at or just below the natural surface of the ground.

In the mound lying south of the one just spoken of three skeletons
were found. The first lay in the western half of the mound, a little be-
low the natural surface of the ground. It had been placed on the back,
with the head to the east and slightly elevated, the thighs and legs
somewhat flexed, and the right arm flexed so as to bring the palm of
the hand upon the upper part of the right side of the chest. Above
the left shoulder lay a heavy stone ornament, charm, or token, of a blue
color when first exhumed, but turning black on exposure to the air. It
was 43 inches long, 24 wide, and seven-sixteenths thick, slightly bent,
and shaped a little like a hoe or an adz. There is a hole through the
narrower end, by which it may have been suspended by a string from
the neck. It appears to have been made from a stone that required but
little fashioning to bring it to the required shape, as it showed but little
polishing, and in spots the rough, natural surface could still be seen.

This was the only manufactured article found in any of the mounds
examined by me in this part of the State. The second skeleton we
came upon was in the upper portion of the eastern half of the mound,
the skull, which was the most elevated part, being not more than 8 or
10 inches below the surface. It lay upon the back, the head to the east,
the shoulders elevated and the head tipped forward upon the chest, the
pelvis a little elevated, and the thighs and legs completely flexed. There
was a cut through the skull. Mr. Trask was of the opinion that it had
been made before burial, and was the cause of death. I think it was
accidentally made by the spade in excavating. The third skeleton was
found at a lower level than the second, but not directly under it, a little
nearer the north side of the mound. Like many of those found in the
sane group of mounds, it lay with the head to the east, on the right
side, the head a little elevated, with the knees drawn up to the chest
and the heels to the pelvis. A peculiarity in this burial is that the
hands were placed in contact with the face.

Not the least interesting and instructive of the mounds of this group
was the one situated a short distance southwest of the principal one.
A little north of the center, a foot and a half below the surface, I came
upon what, for want of a better name, I call an ancient fire-place. It
was simply a level surface, made upon the mound when only partly
built. I uncovered it with the greatest care, working for hours upon
my knees, scraping away the superincumbent earth with a common
table- knife, so as not to displace anything that might be of interest.
When done, I had before me a bed of ashes, mixed with charcoal and
burnt sand, on which lay the bones of a partially burned human skele-
ANCIENT MOUNDS IN CLINTON COUNTY, MICHIGAN. 845

ton. At the bottom of the mound, just below the natural surface of
the ground, were the remains of two skeletons, one under the north
half of the mound, the other under the south. Both appeared to have
been carefully disposed for burial, according to what seems to have been
an approved mode—on the right side, the head'to the east and slightly
elevated, with the thighs and legs flexed so as to bring the heels near
the pelvis. The following facts in the history of this mound are pal-
pable : Two bodies were laid in shallow graves and a mound partly
built above them; on a level spot on the partially built mound a fire
was kindled and a human body burned ; then the bed of ashes and the
remains of the burned body were covered up with earth by the com-
pletion of the mound.

Continuing on down the valley, but bearing more towards the west,
we come to what was probably the largest mound in this part of the
country, situated on the northwest quarter of the southeast quarter
section 32, on the farm of Edward Paine. It is marked 5 on the
map. When my attention was first called to it, not only had excava-
tions been made in it and the bones of several skeletons found, but
- more than half the earth of which it had been composed had been carted
away for use elsewhere and the remainder was in process of removal.
In order to improve what little opportunity for investigation remained,
I volunteered to wield the spade during the completion of the work.
Before this mound had been disturbed it was nearly circular in form,
being 40 feet broad from east to west and a little less from north to
south. According to the best information I can get, and I think it
reliable, it was 44 or 5 feet high. At one time three skulls and a quan-
tity of bones were taken out. Mr. Paine says the skulls were found
close together in the north part of the mound, and, though no special
care was taken to observe the position, he thinks the three skeletons
lay in a horizontal position, with the heads to the north. During the
removal of the last portion of the mound, at which I assisted, nothing of
interest was found except a fire-place. This was situated some distance
below the surface, in the southwest part. The remains consisted of char-
coal and burnt earth mixed with a considerable proportion of a sooty sub-
stance having the appearance of lamp-black. A careful examination of
the charcoal, which was in small pieces and very soft, convinced us
that the fuel had been largely pine wood. The fire had been kept
burning for some time in a hollow or pit in what was then the unfin- -
ished mound. It had afterwards been covered up by additions made
to the mound. No burnt bones or remains of artificial objects were
found. Mr. Paine informs me that at a little distance southwest of
this large mound were formerly several small ones, all of which have
long since disappeared under the operations of the farm.

About 100 rods distant from the mound, on Mr. Paine’s farm, in a di-
rection a little west of north, on the same section, there was formerly
846 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

a mound of considerable size. Itis marked 6 onthe map. It had been
worked down with the plow, when I saw it, till only a slight elevation
remained visible. It was said to have been 25 feet broad at the base
and 4 feet high. I made extensive excavations on its cite, but found
nothing. Mr. N. W. Brass, who was brought up from childhood in the
vicinity, informs me that there was once a small one near it.

Let us now return to group No. 4, on section 33. Going from that point
a little more than half a mile in a northeasterly direction, we arrive at the
location marked 7, on the northeast quarter of the southeast quarter of
the same section, on the farm of Charles Dailey. Here were formerly a
great number of small mounds, scattered over a considerable area. That
they were burial mounds, and not natural undulations of the surface,
was proved by digging into them. All of them have disappeared.

Something more than a mile farther to the northeast, on the farm of
H. B. Smith, on the southeast quarter of section 27, we come to
the site of another mound, marked 8, all traces of which have disap-
peared. My wife, who was among the early settlers, remembered it well,
and confirmed the accounts of it received from others. Mr. Smith rep-
resented it as 30 feet or more in diameter and 4 feet high. A small ex-
cavation was once made in it and a skull taken out. When I visited the
place two thrifty peach trees were growing where the mound formerly
stood.

I forgot to mention, in connection with group No. 4, that there are sev-
eral dug-holes a short distance from the mounds. They are all perfectly
circular and perfectly bowl-shaped. I carefully cleaned out one of them,:
examining every spadeful of earth thrown out, but found no relics. When.
cleaned out to its original size, as nearly as I could judge, it was 7 feet in:
diameter and 3 feet deep. There is no raised margin about any of them.

The only mounds in the township of Greenbush of which I have
any knowledge are situated on section 11. One, marked 9, which I
visited in July, 1878, was about 20° rods north and the same distance
east of the center of the northwest quarter of the section, on the farm
of P. Jefferys. It was in a grove of heavy oak timber, in a tract of
country considerably broken by low hills. Its form was circular. I
did not measure it, but judged that it was 35 feet in diameter and 4 feet
high. Mr. Jefferys informed me that, before it had been disturbed,
there was a perfectly level area 12 or 15 feet in diameter on the top.
It was, in fact, according to his description, a regular truncated cone.
Somebody had made a large excavation down into the center. It was
reported that nothing was found. Another mound, said to be broader
and flatter than the one above described, was reported to be situated 40
or 50 rods southwest of it. I spent considerable time in searching for it,
but the forest being filled with an undergrowth of shrubs and small
trees, almost impenetrable, | was not successful. Of its existence,
however, there is no doubt.
ANCIENT MOUNDS IN CLINTON COUNTY, MICHIGAN. 847

In regard to the mounds in Essex, I cannot do better than to copy
verbatim my notes taken durjng a visit to that township in July, 1878.

The tract of country occupying the central portion of Essex seems
to have been a favorite place of residence of both the Mound Builders
and the red Indians, as it is now of the whites. In point of fertility,
ease of cultivation, and large returns for agricultural labor, it is seldom
excelled. When first known to the oldest of the present residents it
was covered with patches of thrifty hazel bushes, alternating with
patches of a rank and nutritious grass. Oak trees of considerable size
were scattered over its surface. |

About 118 rods west of the northeast corner of section 16, and per-
haps 25 rods south of the section line, the remains of a mound (10)
. are still to be seen. The field in which it is situated has been under
cultivation for, perhaps, thirty years, and the repeated use of the plow
has reduced the height of the mound as least one-half. The same agency
may have also increased its apparent area and somewhat changed the
form of itssurface. Atthe present time the length of the base is 50 feet;
width of the base, 35 feet; height from the natural surface of the ground,
2 feet; height from the bottom of the broad and shallow trenches around
it, from which the earth was apparently taken for its construction, 3
feet. The long axis lies nearly east and west, but inclines a little (per-
haps 5 or 6 degrees) to the southeast and northwest. The east end is
bold and well defined; the west not well defined, the mound sloping
gradually from the junction of its eastern and middle thirds to the nat-
ural surface of the ground at its west end. The earth for its construc-
tion appears to have been scooped up around its base, but principally
in three places—around the east end and along both sides of the west-
ern part. At avout the junction of the eastern and middle thirds, cor-
responding to the highest part of the mound, the earth appears to have
been left in place on each side, forming a passage between the excava-
tions to the foot of the mound, and, perhaps by artificial additions made
to it, a graded way to the top. The soil is a sandy loam, with a small
admixture of gravel. I worked with a spade for three days in succes-
sion, and made extensive excavations in it, but without finding relics or
any evidence of the use it had been put to. A short distance easterly
from this mound is a smaller one, situated directly in the line of the
axis of the larger, which has nearly disappeared under the plow.

On the south part of the northeast quarter of the northeast quarter
section 16 is another mound (11,) but a little less in size than the of
preceding. Its form is circular. According to measurements that I
made, its.diameter at the base, at the present time, is 40 feet, and the
height above the natural surface of the ground 22 inches. There is a
broad. and shallow excavation all around it, from which the earth for
its construction was taken. Its height has been diminished by the plow
at least one-half. Mr. James Soule was familiar with it before the land
848 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

was improved. He says there was an oak tree growing upon it, which,
when cut, many years ago, measured 32 inches in diameter at the stump.
At a short distance east-northeast of this mound is plainly to be seen
the remains of a smaller one.

On the northwest quarter of the northwest quarter of section 23
are two mounds (12) of no great size. They are near together, one
west of the other, on a ridge running east and west. They are plainly
seen, but are fast disappearing under the plow.

There are two small mounds (13), near together, about 85 rods north
and 33 west of the center of section 23, on the farm of Jonathan Hicks.
Like those just mentioned, they are still plainly visible, but are being
rapidly graded down in the process of cultivation.

There was formerly a remarkable group of very small mounds (14) on
the section line between sections 15 and 16 commencing about 40
rods north of the southeast corner of sixteen and extending about
40 rods farther north. Mr. Soule says there were as many as forty of
them. They were raised but a little above the surface of the ground,
and are represented as having been full of human bones. <A gentleman
whose name I have forgotten, but whom I regarded as reliable, told me
that he had frequently passed over them before they had been dis-
turbed, that the bones in many instances were sticking up out of the
soil, and that he had pried out with a stick skulls that were so protrud-
ing. These mounds, with perhaps a single exception, have all been
graded down and destroyed in the construction of the highway and the
cultivation of the adjoining fields.

The opinion of the people living in the neighborhood, founded on
Indian tradition, is that the Essex mounds, large and small, were the
graves of the dead killed ina battle between the Chippewas and Potat-
watomies which occurred not many generations ago. Mr. Soule called
the attention of a very aged Indian woman to the mounds and asked
her their orgin. She confirmed the tradition of the battle, and affirmed
that she had the account from her grandfather, who was an.actor in
the affair. There are many reasons for doubting the truth of the tradi-
tion as far as the larger mounds are concerned, but the group of forty
small ones may possibly have been the graves of the victims of the bat-
tle alluded to. More than this cannot be conceded. The larger mounds
were undoubtedly the work of the race of Mound Builders, and were in
existence long before the traditional battle was fought.

Two or three miles southwest of group 13 I saw several interesting
dug-holes, but find nothing in my notes in regard to them, and cannot
now give anything like a full description from memory. The exact
location I have forgotten.

ANCIENT FORTS IN OGEMAW COUNTY, MICHIGAN.
By M. L. Leacn, of Traverse City, Mich.

June 18 and 19, 1878, I examined two old forts on Rifle River, in the
township of Churchill, Ogemaw County, supposed to be the work of the
Mound Builders. The following isa transcript of my notes made at the
time:

Fort No. 1, Ogemaw County, Michigan.

of section 4, township 22 north, of range 3 east, on the east bank of the
‘river, on a bluff elevated 25 feet above the water. Its form is irregu-
larly oval, the long diameter, from north to south, measured from center
to center of the parapet, being 17 feet, and the short, from east to
west, 141.- The southern portion is a trifle wider than the northern.
The work consists simply of a wall of earth, with a ditch on the outside.
The ditch at the present time is from 2 to 3 feet deep and from 6 to
10 wide; the wall from 2 to 3 feet high and from 6 to 10 wide at

the base. ‘There are eight openings in the wall, distributed at irregu-

lar intervals, but looking towards the eight principal points of com-
pass. The one at the northwestern curve, just on the brow of the bluff,
is the widest, and may have been.the principal entrance. From it the
hill-side seems to have been graded down, forming a gradual and easy
descent to the river. Springs of excellent water come out of the face
of the bluff near the bottom all along the front of the fort. There has
been a heavy growth of pine in and around the fort. A pine stump
standing on the wall measures 3 feet in diameter, and the lumbermen
have cut several of equal size within the area. The lumbermen have
made a road, with a causeway of logs, along the springy hill-side, be-
tween the fort and the margin of the river, so that it is impossible to
tell now exactly the form of the face of the bluff, but have not destroyed
any portion of the earth-works. The river is about 50 feet wide, with
low, wooded land on the opposite side.

No. 2, the larger fort, is about half a mile distant from the smaller,

in a southeasterly direction. In form it is quite regularly egg-shaped,
the larger end being towards the west. Its long diameter, from east to
west, is 310 feet; its short, from north to south, 270. It is a heavier
work than No 1, the ditch being broader and deeper and the wall of cor-

respondingly greater dimensions. In some places the height from the
bottom of the ditch to the top of the wall is fully 8 feet. Unlike No. 1,
this has only four gateways or entrances. These look northeast, north-
west, southeast, and southwest, and being located with great regular
ity with reference to the peculiar shape of the fort, the two at the east-
ern or smaller end are much nearer together than the other two. The
one looking southwest is much wider than the others, and was probably
the main entrance. The ground within the inclosed area is quite un-
even, rising in the southern part considerably higher than the parapet.
As faras I know, but my search was not very extended, there is no
water in the immediate vicinity. Pine trees equal in size to those men-
tioned in. connection with the other fort have been cut on the walls of
this, the stumps of which are still to be seen.

No mounds, graves or other remains, have been found in connection
with these forts. Doubtless, when the country comes to be cultivated,
flint arrow-heads and stone hatchets will make their appearance.

The measurements given above may not be minutely accurate, as I
worked alone and without instruments, except such as I could improvise
for the occasion in addition to a pocket compass. The general features
of the works, however, as given, are substantially correct.

Residents of the vicinity asserted that there were mounds near the
river, several miles below.

A SKETCH OF FLINT RIDGE, LICKING COUNTY, OHIO.
By CHARLES M. SmitH, of New Madison, Ohio.

The great numbers of flint implements, such as arrow, lance, and
spear heads, drills, knives, scrapers, &c., which are found scattered
through all parts of the country, frequently lead to inquiry as to the
sources whence so great an amount of material may have been pro-
cured.

Under the general name of “flint,” in this connection, are included
various forms of siliceous stone, such as chalcedony, jasper, hornstone,
chert, basanite, and even some forms of quartz that have no resemblance
to flint.

The sources of supply are widespread ; but before touching upon this
part of the subject it will, perhaps, be well to give a short résumé of
the different theories in regard to the manner in which is accumulated
the material forming the beds, though geologists have not yet suc-
ceeded in settling this vexed question.

Quartz or silica, in its various forms, is one of the most abundant of
the minerals forming the earth’s crust. Hard (easily scratching glass),
infusible, not affected by acids, it survives, unchanged, agencies that
852 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

will destroy nearly all other rocks. But there is one way in which it
can easily be reduced: the alkaline minerals, such as sodium, potassium,
and a few others, form compounds which are highly soluble; when
water, especially if thermal, thus charged, comes in contact with quartz,
the rock is easily decomposed and held in solution until, by cooling or
evaporation, the water will not retain so much foreign matter, and the
silica is deposited. In this manner is the quartz supplied which forms
our agates, geodes, crystals, the concretions around hot springs, &e.

Should the dissolved silica be carried onward, however, to a consid-
erable body of water, it tends to produce flint or its allied forms in large
masses; and there are different ways in which this can be brought
about. In sea-water there exist microscopic animals whose shells are
formed from silica in the same manner that the shells and skeletons of
mollusks and corals are formed from carbonate of lime; and upon the
death of these animals their remains find a resting place upon the bot-
tom of the ocean, and hold a limited place in the rocks formed by the
limestone-makers—limited because, although numerous, these animal-
cule are so small that thousands or even millions of them will not equal
in bulk a single clam-shell.

Generally the flint thus formed is scattered through the limestone in
such a way as to be scarcely, if at all, noticeable; in the Niagara di-
vision of the Upper Silurian age it seems first to collect itself in nodules
or masses by that mysterious proceeding called ‘concretionary ac-
tion,” a something which has never been explained. Even when the
flint lies in a regular stratum, as it sometimes does, the layer is not con-
tinuous, but is broken up into these concretions. Similar masses are
found in the succeeding geological formations, especially in the Chalk-
measures; in fact, some geologists claim that the only true flint is that
found in the Cretaceous rocks of Europe, and that flint proper is not
found in America at all. Be that as it may, the term is now too firmly
attached to our siliceous rocks of this nature ever to be changed. Flint
formed thus, however, is found only distributed in other rocks and does
not occur in masses to itself.

The principal flint-beds are found in the Carboniferous age, and the
manner in which they are found associated with the other rocks of the
series shows another of the methods of flint-making.

In the lagoons of the present’ day exist immense numbers of minute
plants called Diatoms, which have the power of abstracting silica from
the water and using it in their plant structure. On the decay of the
plant the silica is not restored to the water, but is precipitated ; and if
this work is allowed to continue undisturbed, in time a thick deposit
is the result. As a general thing, the slower the process the more com-
pact the stone will be; and if no tides or freshets interfere, beds of pure
siliceous rock inches or even feet in thickness may be formed. Geolog-
ical conditions at the beginning of the Carboniferous age seem to have
been favorable for the existence of these Diatoms in vast numbers, for
SKETCH OF FLINT RIDGE, LICKING COUNTY, OHIO. 853

in no other formation is the flint so abundant. Land-locked basins
seem to have existed along the border of the ocean in that period, wherein
our little plants flourished, while farther out the limestone was being
formed by such animals as find their most suitable surroundings in
open salt water; so that one has only to lay before him a section of a
coal-shaft, suppose this shaft to have been made through rock of which
some limestone layer was formed near the shore in quiet water, substi-
tute “flint” for “limestone,” and the explanation of flint-beds is at
hand—such, at least, as are due to this vegetable agency. It is not to be
inferred, however, that all flint should for this reason present the same
appearance; there are to be taken into consideration the chances of oc-
casional slight changes of level; tides and storms bringing in a supply of
salter water, with, it may be, many lime-producers ; the swelling of a
tributary stream, where-by various organic and inorganic impurities are
carried in to a greater extent, coming sometimes from one kind of soil,
sometimes from another—all these points, and others, are to be remem-
bered in accounting for the different grades and colors found even in
a limited space.

These are the most common explanations. Recent investigations go
to show that chemical changes at the bottom of the ocean have much
todo with flint formation; and the process of substitution, whereby
silica replaces other material in decaying substances, as is seen in the
petrifaction of woody fiber, adds its mite to the limited knowledge of
the subject; but the question is far from being definitely settled.

Throughout Eastern Ohio there are numerous deposits of flint of vari-
ous descriptions; and in several counties places are to be found in which
the “ancient arrow-maker” practiced his calling with the material so
abundantly supplied.

Pre-eminent among them, on account both of its great extent and the
vast amount of aboriginal labor evident throughout nearly its whole ex-
tent, is the deposit Jying in the southeastern part of Licking and west-
ern part of Muskingum Counties, Ohio. This has been known for many
years as “ Flint Ridge,” and, numerous as are similar deposits in other
places, it is by all odds entitled to be called the “ Flint Ridge” not only
of Ohio but of the whole country.

Its most western point is on the road leading from Newark to Zanes-
ville, about 8 miles from the former place and half a mile from the east-
ern line of Franklin Township. From here it extends eastward across
Hopewell Township and about 2 miles into Muskingum County, making
its entire length very nearly 8 miles, counting by section lines, and
fully 10 miles following the turns of the road. At about 2 miles from
its western end, north of the village of Brownsville, it reaches its great.
est breadth, 24 miles. Owing to the extensive erosion that has taken
place since its final emergence from the ocean (the summits of the hills
being more than 300 feet above the streams), its outline is exceedingly

irregular. The surface is undulating, but on the ridge proper is level
enough to admit of a good road along its whole extent, while long spurs

Flint Ridge, Licking and Muskingum Counties, Ohio.

The dip of the strata in this region, as in nearly all the eastern part
of Ohio, being to the southeast, the flint at the western end of the
ridge is very near the surface, while at the eastern end it is about 80
feet below the highest points, the country holding about the same ele-

vation above the sea-level.
856 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

The flint, from its great resistance to weathering agencies, forms the
cap-rock of the whole ridge, the superincumbent material being for
the most part either clay or soil resulting from the disintegration of the
Shales and sandstones which formerly existed at this horizon. The
natural place of the Kittanning coal of the Pennsylvania series is 15 to
20 feet above the level of the flint, but it runs out before reaching this
far west—at least there is no trace of it here. Thiv beds of bituminous
coal lie at different levels in the hills; 104 feet below the flint is a work-
able seam of cannel-coal. A section of the formations in the eastern
part of Licking County shows the same alternation of sandstone, shale,
clay, coal, limestone, and iron ore that is found in all coal regions, so
that a detailed statement of its geological structure is unnecessary in
this connection.

Did the topography of the country depend upon surface drainage
alone, the flint would act as a protection to the rocks below, and the
whole ridge presenta more symmetrical outline than it does ; but, owing
to the numerous crevices existing in it, and to the porous nature of the
greater part of the underlying strata, water easily passes downward
until it reaches the stratified beds of clay, along which it makes its way
to the openair. The springs thus created have worn their way back, by
the destruction of the adjacent rock and the consequent displacement
of that farther away, until the whole region is a succession of steep
hills separated by narrow ravines.

It is difficult to determine the thickness of the flint at any point with-
out cutting through it, as the outcrop is so weathered and broken as to
offer no safe basis for estimate. A few wells have been dug through it,
and the thickness is given at different points at from 4 to 7 feet. It
probably varies, owing to slight irregularities of the bottom on which
it was deposited, and the more favorable conditions in some places than
in others for the multiplication of the flint-making agents. It is thick-
est at the eastern end, according to persons living there.

In the fourth range of sections in Hopewell Township, counting from
the western line, between the farms of Samuel McCracken and Lennox
Fisher, is a break of three-fourths of a mile in which no flint is found,
erosive agencies having removed all the rock for 20 to 40 feet below the
level of the flint stratum. Beyond this it reappears, and continues un-
broken to its eastern limit in Muskingum County.

In the geological scale this flint is continuous with the ferriferous lime-
stone of Southeastern Ohio, and is highly fossiliferous in some places.
In. the museum of the State University is a very fine nautilus imbedded
in a piece of buhr-stone from this place. Other smaller fossils occur
abundantly both in this and the more solid flint, particularly Fusulina
cylindrica, a small foraminifer found in great numbers in Europe at a
corresponding horizon. Very frequently, however, the fossil, being
calcareous in its nature, has disappeared, and only the matrix remains.

Underneath the flint lies the “« Putnam Hill limestone” of the Ohio sur-

ae

vey, so named from a high hill opposite Zanesville where it is well
Shown. The upper part of this limestone is shelly, sometimes closely
approaching a thin sandstone in its appearance, and of a yellow cast;
farther down it becomes more solid and takes on a blue color.

The flint varies in its nature in different parts of the ridge. It is im-
possible to gain an accurate knowledge of its appearance in many places
without excavation; but, so far as can be judged from the outcrop and
the reports of the well-diggers, the following will be found not far out
of the way: j

At the extreme western end the stone is of a gray or whitish color,
cellular or porous in its structure, and of the sort commonly known as
‘“‘ buhr-stone.”

By the oxidation of the included iron, it shows various shades of yellow
or brown along the lines of fracture.

Half a mile east of this appears a translucent, bluish variety, frag-
ments of which are seen scattered in the fields or along the outcrop.
Still, the buhr-stone seems to predominate.

Two miles east, in the neighborhood of the cross-roads, the flint
changes considerably. There is to be found every color and shade ever
seen in such stone. White, red, black, brown, yellow, green, and blue,
in various shades, occur plentifully in the pieces around the fields and
where the flint shows in the hill-sides. This coloring is all due to the
oxidation of the iron and organic impurities contained in the flint, as
may be shown by digging to the bottom of one of the bowlders which
shows different colors on its top; on reaching a part that is unweathered
it is generally found to be of the same bluish tinge as the greater part
of the bed-rock.

Near the intersection of the ridge road with the one leading from
Brownsville to Clay Lick Station (on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad),
which, for distinction, is calied the cross-road, the well-diggers report
that the flintis light blue and translucent. A few hundred yards north
itis nearly white, while at the same distance south a layer of a very
dark shade is reported at the same level by parties who sunk a shaft
here many years ago ‘“‘to see what was down there.” To determine
what was meant by “dark flint” it was decided to clear out the trash
that had blown into the shaft and examine the flint in its place; and
this is the result:

Commencing at the edge of the shaft, the flint was found at 3 feet
under the original surface, but as this was near the outcrop itis not to
be taken as the full thickness of the overlying dirt, for there is a rise of
several feet from this point to the top of the hill. Under this soil was
a layer of flint of a grayish color, which must be very limited in extent,
as no pieces of it are found in the ‘ work-shops.”

Next was the “ dark flint,” which is further mentioned on a following
page. This flint contained a large amount of iron sulphide, which has
oxidized along the seams, the iron giving a rusty-looking coat to the
858 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

stone, which is not solid, as in some other places, but is in thin layers,
between which a thin parting of clay is occasionally found.

The total thickness of the flint here was 29 inches. Next is a layer
of bluish clay ; on the top of this the sulphur set free by the decompo-
sition of the sulphide had collected in a thin veneer.

Theclay continues pure only for2 or 3 inches; then sand appears mixed
in with it; a little lower some lime also enters; next it isin thin plates;
and. finally, at 16 inches, it runs into the solid limestone. The clay is
quite soft, but as the sand and lime become mixed with it the whole
grows harder and more compact.

This same blaek flint is found east of here, beginning near the next
section line and extending eastward for half a mile, and also at the ex-
treme southeastern spur of the ridge.

A grayish, banded flint, presenting very narrow stripes of white or
light gray, alternating with darker shades of the same color, is founda
few hundred yards southeast of the cross-roads in rather limited quan-
tity. On the farm of Joseph Duncan the same flint occurs in great abun-
dance, the whole outcrop being of this nature on a point north of his
house.

At the eastern end, along the Muskingum line, theflint has much the
same appearance as at the western end—a buhr-stone that has been
quarried to a considerable extent by the whites for making mill-stones.
At the eastern termination of this stratum a white flint is found, having
occasionally places in which iron has given it a reddish tinge.

It would seem, so far as can be judged from the limited opportunities
for examination, that at the edges of the deposit, on every side, it is more
in the nature of the buhr-stone, while through the central part, proba-
bly owing to clearer or less disturbed waters, the formation of a denser,
purer siliceous rock was possible. Scattered around the pits, to be
spoken of later, south of the blacksmith shop, at the cross-roads, near
where the “shaft” mentioned above was sunk, can be found all the colors
and shades mentioned, while farther away, in all directions, it seems to
be of one general character. Much of it answers to the description of
chalcedony, nearly all at the central points being translucent or even
transparent. Theso-called “ black flint” is not the opaque variety, basa-
nite, found in other parts of the Coal measures, but a clear, vitreous kind,
containing a large amount of iron and carbonaceous matter, to which its
color is due. This is proven by finding pieces almost: perfectly transpar-
ent from the absence of impurities, and ranging from that to a deep
black that is translucent only in the thinnest flakes. Some of it has the
coloring matter so distributed as to resemble moss agate very closely;
a variety occurs which has a beautifully mottled or clouded appearance,
due probably to the entanglement of some gas in the silica at the time
jt was deposited, the cloudy part being sometimes in spots, again in
narrow stripes, and occasionally in bands, which make it resemble smal]

concretions. Agates cannot exceed in brilliancy or delicacy the beau-
tiful markings found in many of the fragments.

In nearly all the crevices in the flint, so far as digging by searchers
goes to show, are found quartz crystals. These are of more recent ori-
gin, being formed by the evaporation of waters of infiltration carrying
silica in solution. They vary in size from those which are microscopic
to those_as large as a hen’s egg. Some are limpid as pure water;
others are charged with carbonaceous matter, and sometimes in such
quantity as to make them almost black. They are all short, the ter-
minating pyramidal point frequently being all there is to them Gener-
ally they are found adhering to the face of the rock, though some-
times they may be found in the soil filling the crevices. In the latter
case it is probable that the flint holding them has weathered down and
they have fallen off, as crystals formed free or unattached to a base
generally terminate in a pyramid at each end, a shape not found here.

Baryte and calcite are found occasionally, filling cavities in the flint.

A few dollars’ worth of gold was washed out of the sand in the bank of a
little stream on the south side of the ridge a few years ago, and stories
of various Indians and Californians who know the location in these hills
of nearly all the metals of the globe can be heard from every man who
lives within miles. No doubt minute quantities of various minerals can
be found such as occur in all geological formations; but coal and clay
will be about the only sources of wealth that can ever be made availa-
ble beyond the agricultural productions of the country. The land is
admirably suited to the growth of grass, and this, with the abundance
of pure water in every ravine, must make stock-raising the most profita-
ble occupation in which the people can engage.

Now, as to the evidences of prehistoric industry.

The blacksmith shop of John Loughman, at the cross-roads, 3 miles
north of Brownsville, is a central point from which distance and direc-
tion can be estimated, and has the advantage of being well known to
every one for miles, so that a person can easily take it for a starting
place.

It is not until within half a mile of here, coming from the direction of
Newark, that pits opened for the purpose of obtaining flint begin to ap-
pear. The western end of the ridge was for some reason left untouched ;
probably it can be explained when we come to speak of the evidences of
settlements; at any rate, the rock could have been easily quarried, and
seems as well adapted to purposes of manufacture as at other places.

The pits first appear on the north side of the ridge road, and extend in
a northwest direction, along a spur of about one-fourth of a mile in length,
nearly to its termination, A ravine heads, near the road, east of this
spur, and the next pits are found.on the eastern side of this ravine, on
the farm of Alexander Miller, whose land extends to the cross-roads.

The flint lies nearer the surface here than on the south side of the
road, which at this place is about 500 yards south of the northern limit
860 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

of the flint; and this space, occupied by the farms of Loughman, Miller,
and Feegan, has pits over nearly its whole extent. Southwest of the
blacksmith shop, on the farms of Loughman and Vermillion, the pits
extend nearly half a mile, mostly in uncleared ground, as the succession
of ‘holes and ridges where they have been dug makes it impossible to
cultivate what little soil may be found among the rocks. The holes
grow larger and deeper as the spur extends south, until at the end some
occur which measure 60 feet across. Just how deep they may be can-
not be told except by cleaning them out, as they are partly, or in some
cases wholly, filled with dirt and decayed vegetation. They nearly al-
ways contain more or less water, the present summer being the first
one in many years that they have been dry. Jumping or throwing a
heavy stone in them causes the whole surface to tremble, showing that
the muck filling them is still soft and spongy below, and the length of
time this trembling continues indicates a considerable depth. South ot
Miller’s house, and east of these just mentioned, are a few, but they are
small, and the amount of débris around them shows their depth to be
inconsiderable as compared with the larger ones.

Ten or twelve acres have been dug over on the western side of the
cross-road; that is, if the actual area excavated be measured it will
amount to that much, though the pits themselves are scattered over
several farms. The spurs are narrow, and in many places there is a
considerable interval between the points in which the work has been
carried on; those lying on the southern spur, however, are close together,
and very great labor has plainly been expended on them.

On the east side of the cross-road the holes increase in size and num-
ber.

North of the blacksmith shop are about 6 acres every rod of which
has been dug over. Many of the pits here hold water the entire year.
They are mostly shallow, as the soil is thinner here than at other points
in the excavated district; some are filled with muck, while others con-
tain very little trash. This field has been cleared and cultivation at-
tempted in such parts as can be plowed, but without much success, as
the amount of loose flint heats the ground to such an extent in summer
that everything dries up.

East of these, in a piece of timber, are 2 acres of larger and deeper
pits. Then, scattered at irregular intervals, are a few, single or in
small groups, extending for about half a mile east of the shop, when
there is a break in the work and no more are found on the north side
of the road for nearly a mile.

South of the road, on the east side of the cross-road, continuous with
those described as north of the shop, and extending for about 500 yards
in a direction east of south, are the most extensive excavations, both
as to size and number, to be found in an equal area anywhere in the
State. The part dug over sometimes narrows to 5 or 6 rods, sometimes
widens out to 300 yards. Some of the pits are small, from 15 to 20 feet

Se a
SKETCH OF FLINT RIDGE, LICKING COUNTY, OHIO. 861

across; others have a diameter of not less than 80 feet. As with them
all, the depth is difficult todetermine. A pole 18 feet in length has been
thrust out of sight perpendicularly in one without encountering any-
thing more solid than the muck and trash which shows at the surface ;
but this is scarcely a fair test of the depth, for should there be a crevice
in the limestone beneath, as there well may be, for the stone has fre-
quent joints, the slow drainage would gradually enlarge it, and the
trash could thus sink to a greater depth. Besides, the ground is undu-
lating from here to the cross-roads, and a rise of 10 or 12 feet would
scarcely be noticed by any one in walking that distance along a winding
path.

There can be no doubt that a greater thickness of soil lies over this
particular place than over others. That the holes on this spur (which
lies mostly on the land of J. G. Loughman) were much deeper originally
than at any other point excavated is plain from the higher banks of
dirt and broken rock piled around them. The spur is directly east of
the one running south from Miller’s, and the fragments lying scattered
around on the two points show that the stone is of the same general
character in both; in fact, the ravine between them, up which extends
the cross-road, has been eroded from the middle of a local deposit that
is of richer color, more compact texture, and better adapted to the
needs of those using flint implements than is any other part of the
whole ridge. It is at these places that the most beautifully colored
pieces are found, and there is no doubt that if some of these deepest
pits were cleaned out a more comprehensive idea could be gained of
the original method of excavating, and a better assortment be secured
than at any or all other places on the ridge, both as to color and
variety.

Going still south and east from here, and crossing a deep depression
drained both to the east and the west, we come to an isolated area,
from which spurs extend to the north, east, and west. The first spur
reached, that trending north, is on the farm of W. Iden. In a cleared
field, about 1 mile from the cross-roads, are five or. six large pits; a
short distance east of these between 1 and 2 acres of small, shallow
ones are found. In spite of their number, it does not appear that much
flint has been taken from them. No others are found until the Bowman
farm is reached, nearly a mile southeast from Iden’s. Here is a spur
extending east, on which are 2 acres of pits of a size to compare with
those north of the blacksmith shop, that is, from 15 to 30 feet across.
There are two spurs reaching from here—one toward the southwest, on
which no pits exist; the other southeast, extending about a mile, and
terminating on the farm of J.Kreager. Here is about an acre that has
been dug over, and from the fragments scattered around it would seem
that both black and white flint exist on this point, Before reaching
Kreager’s a spur goes off in a southern direction on Drumm’s farm,
but it was never worked,
862 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

No more flint exists in this direction. Directly north of the spur on
Bowman’s farm, and separated from it by a deep, narrow ravine, is a spur
on the farm of E. H. Duncan, containing pits of the same character and
about the same extent. Immediately east of these, in timber belonging
to Joseph Duncan, are five or six large, deep excavations. Continuing
north, we come to the depression spoken of as separating this area from
the main ridge. Lying partly in this is the farm of Capt. John Lough-
man. North of his house about an acre has been pretty thoroughly dug
over East of this in a bleared field, is about half an acre the flint from
which is a dark variety, approaching more nearly to that at the “shaft”
than at any other place on the ridge. This field is nearly a mile from
the blacksmith shop and close to the town house, located at the point
where the ridge road is crossed by the one leading from Black Hand Sta-
tion to Brownsville. East of the town house is the farm of Samuel
McCracken, on the northern and eastern parts of which are two small
groups of pits, both comprising about an acre, on a spur extending
northward.

Just beyond here commences the before-mentioned break in the stra-
tum of about three-fourths of a mile, the flint next appearing on the
farm of Lennox Fisher, about a mile west of the Muskingum County line.
Some 300 yards east of his house are three large pits, which the owner
calls *“‘ ponds,” as they generally furnish water for his stock through
the summer.

The bottom of these ‘“ponds” is 5 or 6 feet below the surrounding
surface; the original depth was at least twice or three times as great,
if they preserve the same slope the exposed sides show.

The dip of the stratum is more apparent here than at the western
end, as knolls 25 to 30 feet high are in the immediate neighborhood of
the pits.

About one-fourth of a mile south of this, on the adjoining farm of
William Fisher, a piece of woodland contains 2 acres of pits, some of
which are 50 to 60 feet across, but seem to be of less depth than holes
of a corresponding size near the cross-roads.

This is the last sight of aboriginal work on Flint Ridge within the lim-
its of Licking county.

The pits being so scattered, and nearly all in dense timber, it is diffi-
cult to form an accurate estimate of their extent. Certainly they can-
not occupy a smaller area than 60 acres, counting only the space act-
ually excavated.

Half a mile east of the line of Licking and Muskingum Counties, on
the farm of Mathias Drumm, are a few pits, one about 60 feet in diameter,
the others much smaller; there are not more than a dozen of them.

No others occur until the farm of Jacob Burrier is reached, about 3
miles from Fisher’s place. A few small pits exist in the woods southeast
of his house. These are on the southern point of the eastern end of Flint
Ridge.

PS
SKETCH OF FLINT RIDGE, LICKING COUNTY, OHIO. 863

About three-fourths of a mile east of Burrier’s house, on the Brookover
farm, are 2 acres of pits, on the most eastern point of the ridge. About
the same extent of ground is dug over on the Varner farm, half a mite
north of Burrier’s house. Beyond Varner’s the spur extends half a mile
north, and here is the termination of the ridge in this direction.

To sum up, then, we find these pits reaching from half a mile west
to a mile and a half east and from a fourth of a mile nortb to a little
more than 2 miles south of the blacksmith shop at the cross-roads.
These vary from 12 to 80 feet in diameter, and some of them, at least,
cannot be less than 20 feet in cep:

Then, a small number, some 2 acres, 3 miles east of the shop and
near the Muskingum County line.

* Finally, a number scattered along in Muskingum County, from half
a mile to nearly 2 miles from the line, those farther east being, as a
general thing, smaller than the ones in the vicinity of the cross-roads.

They are found on the most northern, southern, and eastern spurs of
the ridge, but not within 2 miles of the most western spur.

These distances are only approximate, the winding roads and per-
plexing sign-boards making it impossible for even those long resident
in the locality to form any very correct idea of the distance between
two places. It is easy to count up section lines, but when one attempts
to follow the roads it will be found that a “ mile” is an exceedingly in-
definite unit of measure.

The flint around the edges of: the whole deposit is not so diversified
in color or quality as that in the more central parts, nor does it seem
to have been so well adapted to the manufacture of the finer grades of
implements.

The amount of work done in excavating is such as would require
hundreds of men for many years, even with our superior advantages in
the way of better tools, there being from 4 to 8 feet, and in a few places
even more, of soil and loose rock to remove, and the flint being so hard
that the best drill, according to the well-diggers, cannot penetrate it
more than 6 inches alii being repointed and retempered. When we
take these facts into consideration, and remember that the aboriginal
workers had nothing but stone tools, the magnitude of their labor be-
comes apparent.

The time that has elapsed since this work was Abie must remain un-
known. Efforts have been made to estimate the length of time neces-
sary for trash to accumulate to any particular thickness; but when we
know that sometimes an inch and sometimes a foot of leaves may pile
upina single storm, this formsavery unsatisfactory basis of calculation,
especially when it is not possible to know the amount of compression
that takes place in any given time. ‘ Results” thus obtained areno bet-
ter than the merest guesses.

On the dirt thrown out from some of the pits are oak trees over 3 feet
in diameter, that it is plain have sprung up since the pits were aban-

doned ; stumps and trunks decaying on every hand point to trees still
older. Timber will not increase in size nearly so fast on this stony
ground asit will under more favorable conditions, so that centuries, pos-
sibly, have passed away since any work of this sort has been done here.

How these ancients knew where to find the best flint for their pur-
poses, unless indeed these sites were chosen at random, cannot be told.
It also remains a question as to how the flint was quarried after its lo-
cation was determined. No doubt a thorough examination of some of
these pits will throw much light upon the methods in use among them
for obtaining the raw material.

In Coshocton County, near Warsaw, are some similar pits which have
been opened by residents of the locality. In them were found two lay-,
ers of flint, the upper a dark variety, the lower a clear, translucent
kind, which answers to the description of chalcedony. This lower flint
seems to have been the kind sought. Traces of fire were plainly visi-
ble in the pits, from which the inference is natural that fires were built
upon the rock, and that, while heated, water was thrown on it. The
stone could thus be broken into pieces. In the bottom of the pits were
found bowlders of granite, syenite, and other glacial rock, which plainly
showed that they had been used as hammers. No doubt a similar plan
was followed at the ridge, and such a supposition is supported by the
fact that these hammers, weighing sometimes 40 pounds, are found in
the fields around the pits. Although the glacier did not cover any part
of the ridge, the western line of Franklin Township coincides very closely
with its limit; besides which the Licking River, which is not more than
3 miles distant in some parts, carries down glacial material in the ice
every winter, so there would have been nothing difficult in finding abun-
dant material for tools; in fact, the pebbles of which the smaller ham-
mers could have been made are found several miles soutli and east of
the glacier limits, even on high ground, having been carried there by
floods or floating ice at the end of that period.

The hammers are found in greatest abundance wherever other signs
exist of an ancient “‘work-shop,” or place where the flint was dressed.

Of these work-shops there are two sorts, which are generally distinct,
though sometimes the two sorts of work were carried on in one place.

One may be designated as the * blocking-out” shops, the other as the
“finishing” shops.

At the first kind, which are always near the pits, it seems the flint
blocks were brought to a size and shape convenient for dressing into
such implements as were desired. In them are always found the larg-
est hammers, though smaller ones are sometimes picked up as well.
Seattered thickly over the ground are angular fragments of flint, such
as would result from knocking off corners and projections from tbe
large pieces taken out of the pits, and also from breaking them up into
smaller pieces, it being unlikely that a block of such brittle material
could be broken up without much waste resulting.

i
SKETCH OF FLINT RIDGE, LICKING COUNTY, oHI0. 865

The pieces thus fitted for working were then mostly carried to the fin-
ishing shops, though, as above stated, the whole work seems to have
been sometimes completed in one place.

These finishing shops are characterized by the smaller fragments,
thin flakes, and broken or unfinished implements, very seldom found
in the blocking-out shops. The hammers found in them are generally
of small size, seldom exceeding 8 ounces in weight, and are of harder
or smoother stone than those found in the other class of shops.

The blocking-out in some cases was done at the pits whence the raw
material was obtained; but generally a convenient spot was chosen to
which all the larger pieces from pits close around were carried, rough
worked, and then taken to one of the finishing shops, which are less
numerous than the others.

Although these shops are to be found at many places on the ridge,
only the more important, those where the greatest amount of work was
done, will be mentioned here, as a study of the places named will give a
visitor as good an understanding of the method of work as would an
inspection of scores of similar places. The relation of the work-shops
to each other and to the pits will be readily perceived from an inspec-
tion of the map.

The blocking-out shops show material scattered over from 5 to 10
acres inextent; the others, though covering less ground, show a greater
amount of work on an equal area.

Of the first sort, then, the principal are located as follows:

On the farm of John G. Loughman, lying along the south side of the
ridge road and just south of the western limit of excavation.

Northeast of the blacksmith shop at the cross-roads. The work seems
to have been done here as soon as the flint was quarried out, and the
fragments are scattered among the pits. Along the side of the road and
within a few feet of the shop is a large pile, many wagon-loads, of an-
gular fragments.

Northwest of the pits on Bowman’s farm, and again between this
shop and Iden’s farm, at which place the two kinds of work seem to
have been carried on at the same time, or perhaps, better to say, where
a portion of the material, after being blocked out, was finished up, while
the greater part was carried elsewhere for the finishing touches.

On McCracken’s farm, within the limits of the pits mentioned as be-
ing north and east of his house.

On the farm of Lennox Fisher, between the pits on his place and
those on William Fisher’s land, is another work-shop combining the
two kinds of work.

At Drumw’s, east of Fisher’s. Here the flint was blocked out at the
pits.

Finally, the last blocking-out place of importance is on Burrier’s farm.
The stone from the pits north, and those on the Brookover farm east,

was carried to what now forms part of several fields, and worked up

866 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

A great amount of work is indicated here by the large territory covered
by the chips and the number of hammers of all RIZER from 2 or 3 ounces
to 15 pounds, scattered on every hand.

In regard to the finishing shops, there is ae a farm, or even a
field, in all this region where evidences cannot be found of the fact that
weapons were finished up, or at least dressed to some extent. Partially
finished or broken specimens, spalls, and flakes may be gathered almost
anywhere; unfortunately, such are, now, about all that can be picked
up. Collectors from various places have been here so often and in such
numbers, and have paid boys such faney prices for “ flints,” that the
ground is kept pretty well searched over. Indeed, when the ground is
plowed in the spring, boys hunting “ flints” are almost as numerous as
the blackbirds following the plow.

The locations of the more important ones will be given:

On the Burrier farm is a knoll of about 10 acres, south of his house,
on which the flakes are scattered thickly. The finishing up of nearly
all the flint quarried in Muskingum County (except that from the few
pits on Drumm’s place) seems to have been done here.

Some 30 rods east of the pits on the Drumm farm is a strip of high
ground containing some flakes and spalls—not many, but stil! in as great
quantity as the limited number of excavations would lead one to ex-
pect.

In addition tu the shop named on Fisher’s place as combining the
two kinds of work, is one of small extent, on a knoll north of the three
pits, and another west of this, in what is now an orchard, where con-
siderable work has been done.

Just east of the town house is a small area where the flint from the
pits in that vicinity seems to have been finished. Southwest of this a
limited space on Capt. John Loughman’s farm has flakes quite thickly
spread.

On Iden’s farm is a field of 10 acres where abundant chips and flakes
show that on this spot the finishing touches were given to all the flint
from his, Duncan’s, and Bowman’s farms.

At John G. Loughman’s house is about 1 acre thickly covered with
pieces of all the colors to be found in this region, while on the same
farm ,some 40 rods west, on the point containing the large, deep pits, is
the most interesting spot of all. Hundreds of implements, in all stages
of finish, have been found here, and each fresh plowing seems to expose
them in undiminished numbers. As deep asa plow can go these speci-
mens are found, and in such numbers that the jingling noise made by
them sounds as though one were plowing through a lot of castings. At
the side of the field nearest the edge of the hill the spalls are said to have
been piled up in a mound before cultivation scattered them, as though the
“ancient arrow-maker” had either thrown the fragments on every side of
him, and thus gradually elevated himself, or else had heaped all the flakes
and unfinished or broken specimens into a single pile. Over an acre

ete a

of this point has been plowed this year, and the remains of “ primitive
industry” cover aljl this area. How much more may be hidden under
the soil formed by vegetable growth since the shop was abandoned is
uncertain, but it seems reasonable to suppose that all the part in which
no pits are found, some 4 acres, may have been left by the aborigines
as a place in which the work might be completed. On the part that
has been plowed there is about half an acre in which the flint amounts
to four-fifths of the whole; that is, if all the soil could be put in one pile
and the flint chips in another, this would be the proportion of each.

Nearly all this is in small flakes and spalls, chipped off in finishing.
Very few angular blocks or fragments are found, and such as do occur
are those which were carried from elsewhere, but on which, for some
reason, the finishing process had not begun. This is the only work-
shop on the ridge where may be found the flint ‘ coves” from which
were flaked off long, thin splinters to be used as knives, perforators,
lancets, and the like.*

On J. Kreager’s farm is a shop just north of the pits and on the side
of the hill. Both angular fragments and thin flakes may be found here,
showing that the rough blocks were fully dressed out before being car-
ried away.

Smaller shops may be found on J. 8S. Loughman’s land, just at the
western edge of the break in the stratum, and on Cook’s land, a short
distance southwest of Capt. John Loughman’s.

The work of making these implements, then, seems to have been
thus:

The aborigines (meaning thereby Indians, Mound Builders, or what-
ever other name may be assigned to the people who did this work) knew
that by digging into the unweathered bed-rock a quality of flint could be
obtained better suited to their purposes than that which could be pro-
cured along the outcrop. The dirt was cleared away, by being carried
out in baskets or skins, until the flint was exposed. Cleaning out a
space sufficient for working purposes, a fire was built on top of the rock,
and when it was heated water was thrown onit. This would cause the
rock to crumble, and on clearing out the fragments a fresh surface of
flint would be exposed around the hole thus made in it, from which
pieces could be broken off with the large bowlders found in the vicinity,
A question presents itself here, ‘‘If this method was used, why did
they not follow the flint stratum, once they had found it, throwing the
dirt behind them, instead of opening so many fresh holes?” The only
answer to be given is that they did not, except in a few instances, and
that is all we know about it.

The pieces thus obtained, if not already small enough, could be again

* On digging in this shop, after the above was written, it was discovered that the
layer of chips was not so thick as it was supposed to be; at any point in the field soil
free from flint could be found at not more than 16 inches below the surface. Still, an
immense amount of work has been done here,
868 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

broken into smaller ones of a convenient size for handling, and taken
to one of the blocking-out shops. Here they were broken into pieces
of such size as would be best adapted for the form of weapon desired,
the faulty pieces rejected, aud perhaps the largest blocks chipped into
a rough outline of its final form. Next, it was taken to the finishing
shops, where the smaller hammers were brought into play to chip off
as much as was possible by such means, after which the weapon, if in-
tended to be completed here, was flaked off, by means of pressure ex-
erted with a piece of bone or horn, until it reached an outline as regular
and a finish as smooth as its maker desired or was able to give.

The well-diggers say that the flint can be got out in solid pieces meas-
uring 12 to 18inches each way ; that it has a smooth, oily look not found
in those pieces exposed on the surface; and that it is much tougher
and harder to break. This “toughness” is probably due to the moist-
ure in the stone, as the statement has been made that flint when first
got out of the ground can be flaked off with but little difficulty, while
after even a short exposure it becomes brittle and is liable to break in
any direction. Whether, when thus dry and brittle, it could be re-
stored to its former state by immersion or burial is a question for ex-
periment.

One of the old-timers who has been living here for nearly fifty years
says that when he first came to the country the old-fashioned flint-lock
muskets were in general use, and that the hunters were in the habit of
collecting pieces of flint and soaking them in oil for some weeks before
using them. This caused them to last much longer; a flint that would,
by shattering, become useless in one day, could by this means be made
to last for weeks. Is it not possible that the aboriginal workers had
some such process by which they could render their work easier and
more certain ?

Careful investigation of these finishing shops gives rise to another
belief, namely, that very few weapons, as compared with the great amount
of flint used, were ever fully completed here. The great number of
roughly finished specimens found here, when there seems to have been
no reason for having discontinued work on them, and the great quan-
tities of similarly shaped pieces from this locality occurring at places
quite distant, show that the majority of the pieces worked here were
brought nearly to the required shape and that it was left with the final
owner to give each one such degree of fine finish and symmetry as
suited him. There are many places remote from any flint deposit
where flakes and spalls are found in abundance, showing that flint im-
plements of some description had been dressed on the spot.

The immense amount of work done at Flint Ridge, and the widely
separated points at which material from here has been found, may be
explained in two ways:

First, that some particular tribe or race owned this region, and car-
ried on for generations, or perhaps centuries, a regular traffic in such

ee Pere

unfinished weapons. It is stated in many works upon our modern In-
dians that each tribe has a particular form of arrow-head or other
weapon, so that one found at a distance from a settlement shows to an
experienced observer just what tribe has been represented in the vicin-
ity. As it is highly improbable that any one tribe could have utilized
the great quanity of flint that has been taken even from this one locality,
there can be little doubt that a regular trade was carried on with
neighboring tribes, or even with those at a distance; and in this view
it is likely that the separate blocks were brought to the smallest com-
pass compatible with their ultimate use, in order that as little useless
material as possible would have to be carried away. And the same
holds good with the so-called ‘leaf-shaped arrow-heads,” even those
dressed as smoothly as we sometimes find them; in support of which
the following is offered :

An examination of flint weapons shows that there are two general
forms of the upper part or point—the straight sides, as in Fig. 1, or the
curved sides asin Fig. 2. The angle of divergence of the sides may vary

considerably, but this does not affect the subject.

Now, in the many specimens which have been found in various facto-
ries, particularly the one under consideration, it may be noticed that
nearly all which have been dressed as smooth and thin as they can be
have two general forms of the base—the square, as in Fig. 3, or the
curved or circular, as in Fig. 4.

Very few, comparatively, are found in which the barbs or tangs are
finished out. Take almost any arrow-head, restore its outline by filling
the chipped out places with wax (the experimenter will probably be
surprised to see what a small quantity will be required), and the weapon
will be restored to one of the forms made possible by a combination of
the straight or curved sides with the straight or curved base.

A few such restorations are here given:

870 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

These facts, which may be noticed at other places as well as at Flint
Ridge, give much support to the theory of a general traffic in weapons
by one tribe with other tribes, and goes far toward explaining the oc-
currence of the great numbers of unfinished weapons, flakes, and spalls -
of any particular flint scores or hundreds of miles from the place where
it could have been quarried.

Before giving the second way in which the facts may be accounted
for, a little digression is necessary.

As is well known to all who have perused the various works on arch-
ology, Licking County is not surpassed by any equal area in the coun-
try in the size, number, and complicated arrangement of prehistoric
earthworks. More stone mounds, too, are found in its limits than in any
other one county, in Ohio at least.

From the immense works at Newark a system of mounds and other
structures stretches towards the Muskingum Valley on the east and the
Scioto on the west, so that by means of semaphori¢ communications the
whole region could be appraised in a short time of any unusual event.

Notwithstanding this, the whole of Flint Ridge, despite its evidence of
long occupancy, shows few remains of this nature.

The line dividing Franklin and Hopewell Townships crosses a stone
fort. The hill-top is level and gradually widens out as it extends east-
ward from the fort, which incloses about 10 acres and is built upon the
point of the hill in such a way as to reach the brow on the northern,
western, and southern sides, and is admirably situated for defensive op-
erations, and also for commanding the valleys leading from the ridge
westward. Within it are two mounds, one of earth, the other of stone,
not more than 20 yards apart. Both have been opened, but without re-
sults. The stone mound and the fort are constructed of flint blocks
gathered up from the outcrop just below the top of the hill.

In the field containing the blocking-out shop, southwest of the black-
smith shop, is a circle of about 35 yards diameter; a few rods west of
the blacksmith shop is, or rather was, another of about 50 yards; and
on Bowman’s farm, west of the pits, was another, whose size could not
be learnéd. Both the latter have been plowed down level with the sur-
rounding surface. They all seem to be village sites or permanent en-
campments, being on the highest ground in the vicinity.

On Captain Loughman’s farm, in the finishing shop east of the house,
a mound formerly stood which has been plowed down. From no point
on the ridge can a more extended view be obtained than from the site
of this mound. Hills in the three adjoining counties of Perry, Muskin-
gum, and Coshocton are plainly visible, and the country nearer at hand
is spread out like a map before the observer.

These are all the places, so far as known, that indicate any perma-
nent settlements. Diligent search failed to reveal any traces of pottery
or other domestic implements, nor does it appear that any relics have
SKETCH OF FLINT RIDGE, LICKING COUNTY, OHIO. 871

ever been discovered except such as may have been lost or abandoned
by wandering, hunting, or exploring parties.

While on this part of the subject it may be stated that the “trail”
from Grave Creek, West Virginia, to the lakes led past the captain’s
and close to the cross-roads. Old settlers speak of seeing the Indians
follow it many years ago.

A so-called “furnace,” which many of the inhabitants believe to have
been used by the Indians to melt gold out of the flint (every man who
comes to the country will be assured that this is ‘a solemn fact”), lo-
cated half a mile south of the captain’s, proves to be an old camp site.
Being close to three large springs, it would naturally be selected by
hunters and movers, and was much used, a large amount of burned
sandstone being scattered around, of which fire-places were constructed.

A “mound” on the Muskingum line proved to be a spot where an
excavation had been begun but soon abandoned ; a crescent-shaped
hole has the dirt from it thrown on the surface between the horns.
Most probably made at an early: day by whites seeking material for
millstones.

To return to the argument: This scarcity of the evidences of perma-
nent settlement on a scale commensurate with the amount of work done
offers another solution of the unfinished state of so many implements,
which is this:

It is well known that the celebrated ‘‘red pipe-stone quarries” were
held as sacred and neutral ground by all the tribes which were accus-
tomed to gather there for the purpose of procuring this rare and, to
them, valuable stone. No matter what feuds may have existed between
tribes, or what deadly enmities may have been held by individuals,
when workers met in these quarries it was always in a state of peace,
even if their differences would not allow friendly intercourse.

Some such feeling as this may have influenced the natives of this sec-
tion of the country. With that disposition characteristic of the super-
stitious, nations as well as individuals, to attribute everything by which
they are benefited to the direct and friendly interposition of a beneficent
Superior Being, it is easy to believe that these people may have held this
Flint Ridge as a sacred gift from their Great Spirit. All the different
tribes may have resorted to this place to obtain material from which to
fabricate weapons, and also, it may be, to secure the more brilliant stone
for making totems or insignia, or for some tribal or religious ceremonies.

The stupendous works at Newark, and the connected system of
mounds, &c., could have been built only by a nation that possessed the
territory for a great length of time and were in large numbers. They
would claim dominion over all the country round for many leagues, ex-
cept perhaps this sacred ground, if so it was held, and would jealously
guard their territory against the hunting parties from other regions ;
and although they would not, from religious motives, molest outside
parties engaged in procuring flint, yet when these same parties went
872 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

beyond their allotted boundaries, they would, like more modern peuple,
find that a decided limit can be given to conscientious scruples by per-
sonal interests; hence it would behoove them to secure their flint as
quickly as possible and get back to their own hunting grounds, unless,
indeed, they had the means to supply themselves with provisions from
the owners of the surrounding country, for supporting themselves, in
case a longer sojourn was desirable. So that they would chip their
flint to a portable size and shape, and carry it thus with them to such
points as they chose, and there take all the time necessary for dressing
and finishing it up.

The caches of so-called “ disks,” “‘scrapers,” ‘ leaf-shaped implements,”
‘“‘ turtle-backs,” or ‘ hatchets,” as they are variously named in so many
localities where they are found, which may be regarded as nothing more
or less than such unfinished pieces, render this theory plausible; and
it certainly loses no strength if we accept the statement quoted some
pages back that “fresh” flintis much more readily worked than ‘ dry.”
Burying it in the ground would allow it to remain in working order much
longer than if it were exposed to the atmosphere.

The finely dressed arrows or knives sometimes found, and the few
“circles” in the vicinity, do not militate against the theory; in fact,
they rather strengthen it; for such of the natives as lived within a short
distance coald well spare the time necessary to complete their work
while they were about it, and the defensive position indicated by the
fort and “circles” is only such a precaution as would naturally be taken
by a settled people who were compelled to allow strangers or even enemies
to remain so near them unmolested. Three hours’ time, or even less,
would have allowed a treacherous, hostile party to reach the Newark
works from the Ridge, and it was only a matter of ordinary prudence
to keep a look-out for such a contingency. The position of the fort, too,
supports this view, being located, as itis, so far west of the nearest point
to their settlements where any work was done, although a limit had
been set past which none were allowed to go.

If it be objected to all this that it makes the Indian and the Mound
Builder the same person, let it be remembered that no one has yet
proven that the Indian was not a Mound Builder, or that the Mound
Builder did not do this work on Flint Ridge.

Whether there is anything in these two “ explanations” which possi-
bly *‘ do not explain,” or whether a combination of both may better suit
the case, or whether, finally, the facts must be explained by a new
hypothesis, archeologists may determine. The writer, not professing to
be posted in the science, simply submits such thoughts as will suggest
themselves to any one who may go over the ground carefully; and ic
these observations will throw any light upon this interesting subject,
or afford any information, let it be taken for what it is worth.

Strict accuracy is not claimed for the accompanying map. <A person,

on strange ground, much of which is covered with heavy timber and
dense undergrowth, may be pardoned a few errors.

The roads and farms are taken from a county map; the pits, work-
shops, &c., are put as near as possible in their true positions, but are
somewhat exaggerated in area, that they may be more easily located ;
and any one with this map will experience but little difficulty in finding
anything of archeological interest on the Ridge.

Any one wishing to make a personal investigation will do well to
begin his work by calling on Capt. John Loughman, living near the
cross-roads. He has hunted over these hills for more than fifty years,
and every field is familiar to him. He takes pleasure in giving informa-
tion to the seeker of knowledge.

EARTHWORKS AND MOUNDS IN MIAMI COUNTY, OHIO.
By E. T. WILTHEIss, of Piqua, Ohio.

The accompanying map represents Washington and part of Spring
Creek Township, Miami County, Ohio, in which are located all the
ancient works that were in existence when the Europeans made their
first appearance in that locality. The works are marked with figures
to identify them in order.

No. 1 is a large ellipse whose axes are respectively 1,500 and 900 feet,
and incloses, according to Col. John Johnston, who was the former
owner of the place, 17 acres. The wall is made of bowlders, all water
washed, and, no doubt, they were gathered from the bed of the East
Miami River. The work is located 3 miles north of Piqua, Ohio,
and is 30 feet above the level of the valley of the river. The founda-
tion of the wall is 10 feet wide at the base. The wall which was, at
the appearance of the settlers in 1797, about 4 feet high, has fallen
down, and the bowlders lie scattered all over the field. The present
owner is destroying it as fast as possible, as he has the field under cul-
tivation.

The figure of the ellipse deviates in some cases from a strict regularity
to accommodate itself to the surface of the country as it then was.
There was a large spring on the northeast in the fort which was walled
with bowlders. About 30 feet southwest from the spring stands a bowl-
der on end 8 feet in height. On the south end of the fort is a mound 240
feet in circumference and 5 feet high. This mound was surrounded by a
small ditch, which was paved with small bowlders. It took one man a
week to remove this pavement. In May, 1880, the writer made an ex-
ploration of the center of the mound and found it to contain a sacrificial
altar. After digging through a foot of soil, a stratum of yellow sand
was encountered, 10 inches thick; then 6 inches of ashes mixed with
burnt bones. This stratum of ashes was pressed in such a solid mass

that it required a pike to break through it. After the removal of the
ashes, 19 inches of clay burnt red were met with. The excavation was
about 6 feet square. There is a large stump of a tree standing a little
to the north of the center of the mound. On the west side of the fort
are three gateways 8 feet wide, which are covered on the outside by a
stone wall 10 to 12 feet long, and 6 feet thick. There are also three small
ravines running down to the valley below in front of these gateways,
which no dgubt were excavated by human hands. On the west wall
are standing at present some very large trees.

No. 2 is a small circular fort situated 200 yards southeast of No. 1.
The height of the wall is at present about 18 inches, but formerly, no
doubt, it was much higher. This inclosure has a ditch on the inside,
and gateways facing fort No. 1, and is about 150 feet in circumference.

No. 3 is a similar structare, and is located about 200 yards east of
No. 2. This embankment has t.vo gateways, one on the east and the
other on the west, 8 feet wide. The wall is about 4 feet high and
slopes towards the gateways. This also has a ditch on the inside.
This work has never been disturbed. It is. about 200 feet in circum-
ference and is fenced and covered with sod.

No. 4 is located 1 mile south of No.1 and situated on the second bot-
tom. It is 300 feet in circumference, with an entrance on the south-
east side, 10 feet wide. Its embankment is at present about 2 feet high
and 8 feet wide, which the plow lowers every season, and its wall will
soon be erased from the surface. This also has a ditch inside.

No. 5 is a mound situated 300 yards to the northeast of No. 4. This
mound was 240 feet in circumference, and was formerly about 9 feet
high, but at present is almost obliterated. An exploration was made
by running a ditch from south to north to the center of the mound,
and it was found to contain an altar composed of burnt clay. This
was covered with ashes, charcoal, and burnt bones, 3 inches thick. On
this was a layer of clay, then alternate layers of clay and charcoal
5 feet thick, each charcoal stratum being about 1 inch in thickness,
the whole covered with clay and gravel mixed, 2 feet thick. West of
the altar were found human remains, viz, a skeleton lying with the
head towards the southeast imbedded in clay; the skull bore the ap-
pearance of having been crushed with a blunt instrument. Fragments
of the skull were within the cavity near the surface. Broken pottery
similar to that found in Kentucky occurred.

Nos. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are altogether obliterated and were located
within the present limits of the city of Piqua, Miami County, Ohio, all
within an eighth of a mile of the river. These works were described by
Maj. S. H. Long.

No. 11 is situated 1 mile southwest of the center of Piqua, on the
upland. It is an ellipse 60 feet wide and 100 feet long, with ditch on
inside and one gateway on the north. This work has been almost ob-
876 PAPERS RELATING TO ANTHROPOLOGY.

literated by the plow. There is a spring at the foot of the hill in front
of the gateway.

Nos. 12 and 13 are stone mounds about 2 feet in height and 100 feet
in circumference. From No.12 were taken a great many human remains,
and from No. 13 a skeleton, a stone ax, and a slate-stone plate per-
forated with one hole.

No. 14 was another mound, which is now entirely obliterated.

No. 15 is a circular earthwork, with a ditch on the inside. The em-
bankment, which is about 3 feet in height and 5 feet wide, is situated on
a high bluff off the Miami River, and can be distinctly traced.

No. 16 was another circular earthwork, and there are at present no
traces of it, for the Dayton and Michigan Railroad runs over the spot
where it was. It was about 300 feet in circumference, with a ditch on
the inside. There is a spring on the west of the work, about half way
down the bluff, which never fails.

No. 17 is another stone mound 150 feet in circumference and is now
2 feet high, but formerly was much higher. The former owner has
removed a great deal of the material of this mound for the purpose of
burning lime. There are a great many human remains beneath this
mound.

No. 18 is a large mound, covering nearly an acre of ground, and
at present is 21 feet, high. There is a house built on this mound, the
owner of which informed the writer. that in digging the cellar he en-
countered ashes, charcoal, and remains of burnt bones. This mound
cannot be thoroughly examined, on account of the house, which stands
in the center of the mound. The map is marked with crosses where
human remains are found; also the village sites.

There are remains of works in other townships.

In Concord there is a mound 155 feet in circumference and 5 feet
high, truncated. In Newton Township there is a one half circular
work, 700 feet in circumference, 240 feet in length, and 6 feet high.
There is a ditch on the inside and outside, sloping towards the
ravines, where the embankment ends. The wall of earth faces the
west. Also one circular work 300 feet in circumference. These two
works are located on the west bank of the Stillwater River, on Sec-
tion 19, Newton Township, Miami County, Ohio, and are covered with
timber. They are situated on a bluff 60 feet above the river. There is
a ravine running from the southwest and another from the northwest,
and in the fork between these ravines the largest of the works is located.
