PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION

OF THE

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

(PRESENTED IN THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SEORETARY, AND
ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF REGENTS, DECEMBER 13, 1847.]

INTRODUCTION.

General considerations which should serve as a guide in adopting «
Plan of Organization.

1. Witt or Smitason. The property is bequeathed to the United
States of America, ‘‘to found at Washington, under the name of the
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, an establishment for the increase and diffu-
sion of knowledge among men.’’

2. The bequest is for the benefit of mankind. The government of
the United States is merely a trustee to carry out the design of the
testator.

3. The Institution is not a national establishment, as is frequently
supposed, but the establishment of an individual, and is to bear and
perpetuate his name.

4. The objects of the inanieattan are, first, to increase, and second,
to diffuse knowledge among men.

5. These two objects should not be confounded with one another.
The first is to enlarge the existing stock of knowledge by the addition
of new truths; and the second, to disseminate knowledge, thus in-
creased, among men.

6. The will makes no restriction in favor of any particular kind of
knowledge; hence all branches are entitled to a share of attention.

7. Knowledge can be increased by different methods of facilitating
and promoting the discovery of new truths; and can be most exten-
sively diffused among men by means of the press.

8. To effect the greatest amount of good, the organization should |
be such as to enable the Institution to produce results, in the way of
increasing and diffusing knowledge, which cannot be produced either
at all or so efficiently by the existing institutions in our country.

9. The organization should also be such as can be adopted pro-
visionally, can be easily reduced to practice, receive modifications,
or be abandoned, in whole or in part, without a sacrifice of the funds.

10. In order to compensate, in some measure, for the loss of time
occasioned by the delay of eight years in establishing the Institution,
Ig

8 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

a considerable portion of the interest which has accrued should be
added to the principal.

11. In proportion to the wide field of knowledge to be cultivated,
the funds are small. Economy should therefore be consulted in the
construction of the building; and not only the first cost of the edifice
should be considered, but also the continual expense of keeping it in
repair, and of the support of the establishment necessarily connected
with it. There should also be but few individuals permanently sup-
ported by the Institution. ns bbe

12. The plan and dimensions of the building should be determined
by the plan of organization, and not the converse.

13. It should be recollected that mankind in general are to be
benefited by the bequest, and that, therefore, all unnecessary ex-
penditure on local objects would be a perversion of the trust.

14. Besides the foregoing considerations deduced immediately from
the will of Smithson, regard must be had to certain requirements of
the act of Congress establishing the Institution. These are, a library,
a museum, and a gallery of art, with a building on a liberal scale to
contain them.

SECTION I.

Plan of Organization of the Institution in accordance with the foregoing
deductions from the will of Smithson.

To INcREASE KNowLeDGE. It is proposed—

1. To stimulate men of talent to make original researches, by offer-
ing suitable rewards for memoirs containing new truths; and

2. To appropriate annually a portion of the income for particular
researches, under the direction of suitable persons.

To Dirruse Know.epce. It is proposed—
1. To publish a series of periodical reports on the progress of the
different branches of knowledge; and

2. To publish occasionally separate treatises on subjects of general
interest.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE.

I.—By stimulating researches.

1. Facilities afforded for the production of original memoirs on all
branches of knowledge.

2. The memoirs thus obtained to be published in a series of volumes,
a quarto form, and entitled Smithsonian Contributions to Know-
edge. .

3. No memoir on subjects of physical science to be accepted for
publication which does not furnish a positive addition to human
knowledge, resting on original research; and all unverified specula-
tions to be rejected.

4, Each memoir presented to the Institution to be submitted for
examination to a commission of persons of reputation for learning in
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 9

the branch to which the memoir pertains; and to be accepted for
publication only in case the report of this commission is favorable.

5. The commission to be chosen by the officers of the Institution,
and the name of the author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless
a favorable decision be made.

6. The volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the transactions
of literary and scientific societies, and copies to be given to all the
colleges and principal libraries in this country. One part of the
remaining copies may be offered for sale; and the other carefully pre-
served, to form complete sets of the work, to supply the demand from
new institutions.
~ 7. An abstract, or popular account, of the contents of these memoirs
to be given to the public through the annual report of the Regents
to Congress.

Il.—By appropriating a part of the income, annually, to special objects
of research, under the direction of suitable persons.

1. The objects, and the amount appropriated, to be recommended
by counsellors of the Institution.

2. Appropriations in different years to different objects, so that, in
course of time, each branch of knowledge may receive a share.

3. The results obtained from these appropriations to be published
with the memoirs before mentioned, in the volumes of the Smith-
sonian Contributions to Knowledge.

4, Examples of objects for which appropriations may be made.

(1.) System of extended meteorological observations for solving the
problem of American storms.

(2.) Explorations in descriptive natural history, and geological,
magnetical, and topographical surveys, to collect materials for the
formation of a Physical Atlas of the United States.

(3.) Solution of experimental problems, such asa new determination
of the weight of the earth, of the velocity of electricity, and of light;
chemical analyses of soils and plants; collection and publication of
scientific facts, accumulated in the offices of government.

(4.) Institution of statistical inquiries with reference to physical,
moral, and political subjects.

(5.) Historical researches and accurate surveys of places celebrated
in American history.

(6.) Ethnological researches, particularly with reference to the
different races of men in North America; also, explorations and accu-
rate surveys of the mounds and other remains of the ancient people
of our country.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN FOR DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE.

I.—By the publication of a series of reports, giving an account of the new
discoveries in science, and of the changes made from year to year in all
branches of knowledge not strictly professional.

1, Thgse reports will diffuse a kind of knowledge generally inter-
esting, but which, at present, is inaccessible to the public. Some of
10 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

the reports may be published annually, others at longer intervals, as
the income of the Institution or the changes in the branches of know-
ledge may indicate.

2. The reports are to be prepared by collaborators eminent in the
different branches of knowledge.

3. Each collaborator to be furnished with the journals and publica-
tions, domestic and foreign, necessary to the compilation of his report;
to be paid a certain sum for his labors, and to be named on the title-
page of the report.

4. The reports to be published in separate parts, so that persons
interested in a particular branch can procure the parts relating to it
without purchasing the whole.

5. These reports may be presented to Congress for partial distri-
bution, the remaining copies to be given to literary and scientific
institutions, and sold to individuals for a moderate price.

The following are some of the subjects which may be embraced in
the reports:

I. PHYSICAL CLASS.

1. Physics, including astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry,
and meteorology.

2. Natural history, including botany, zoology, geology, &c.

3. Agriculture.

4, Application of science to arts:

II. MORAL AND POLITICAL CLASS.

. 0. Hthnology, including particular history, comparative philology,
antiquities, &c.

6. Statistics and political economy.

7. Mental and moral philosophy.

8. A survey of the political events of the world, penal reform, &c.

Ill. LITERATURE AND THE FINE ARTS.

9. Modern literature.
10. The fine arts, and their application to the useful arts.
11. Bibliography.
12. Obituary notices of distinguished individuals.

Il.—-By the publication of separate treatises on subjects of general interest.

1. These treatises may occasionally consist of valuable memoirs
translated from foreign languages, or of articles prepared under the
direction of the Institution, or procured by offering premiums for the
best exposition of a given subject.

2. The treatises should in all cases be submitted to a commission
_ of competent judges previous to their publication.

)
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 1

3. As examples of these treatises, expositions may be obtained of
the present state of the several branches of know ledge mentioned in
the table of reports.

SECTION II.

Plan of organization, in accordance with the terms of the resolutions of
the Board of Regents providing for the two modes of imereasing and
diffusing knowledge.

1. The act of Congress establishing the Institution contemplated
the formation of a library and a museum; and the Board of Regents,
including these objects in the plan of organization, resolved to divide
the income* into two equal parts.

2. One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse knowledge
by means of publications and researches, agreeably to the scheme
before given. The other part to be appropriated to the formation of
a library and a collection of objects of nature and of art.

3. These two plans are not incompatible one with another.

4. To carry out the plan before described, a library will be required,
consisting, Ist, of a complete collection of the transactions and pro-
ceedings of all the learned societies in the world; 2d, of the more
important current periodical publications, and other works necessary
in preparing the periodical reports.

5. The Institution should make special collections, particularly of
objects to illustrate and verify its own publications.

6. Also, a collection of instruments of research in all branches of
experimental science.

7. With reference to the collection of books, other than those men-
tioned above, catalogues of all the different libraries in the United
States should be procured, in order that the valuable books first pur-
chased may be such as are not to be found in the United States.

8. Also, catalogues of memoirs, and of books and other materials,
should be collected for rendering the Institution a centre of biblio-
graphical knowledge, whence the student may be directed to any
work which he may require.

9. It is believed that the collections in natural history will increase
by donation as rapidly as the income of the Institution can make pro-
vision for their reception, and, therefore, it will seldom be necessary
to purchase articles of this kind.

10. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of art casts
of the most celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture.

11. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of ex-
pense, for the exhibition of the objects of the Art-Union and other
similar societies.

iD PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

12. A small appropriation should annually be made for models of
antiquities, such as those of the remains of ancient temples, &c.

13. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, besides
the Secretary, no permanent assistant will be required, except one,
to act as librarian.

14. The Secretary, by the law of Congress, is alone responsible to
the Regents. He shall take charge of the building and property,
keep a record of proceedings, discharge the duties of librarian and
keeper of tlf€ museum, and may, with the consent of the Regents,
employ assistants.

15. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Con-
cress, will be required to illustrate new discoveries in science, and to
exhibit new objects of art; distinguished individuals should also be
invited to give lectures on subjects of general interest.

This programme, which was at first adopted provisionally, has be-
come the settled policy of the Institution. The only material change
is that expressed by the following resolutions, adopted January 15,
1855, viz:

Resolved, That the Tth resolution, passed by the Board of Regents
on the 26th of January, 1847, requiring an equal division of the
income between the active operations and the museum and library,
when the buildings are completed, be and it is hereby repealed.

Resolved, That hereafter the annual appropriations shall be appor-
tioned specifically among the different objects and operations of the
Institution in such manner as may, in the judgment of the Regents,
be necessary and proper for each, according to its intrinsic import-
ance, and a compliance in good faith with the law.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY FOR 1859.

To the Board of Regents:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor again to present to you the history
of the transactions of the Smithsonian Institution for another year,
and I am happy to be able, at the beginning of my report, to state
that nothing has occurred since your last session to interfere with the
successful prosecution of the several objects embraced in the plan of
organization.

The funds of the establishment are still in a good condition: the
original bequest of Smithson remains in the treasury of the United
States; the extra fund which was saved from the annual income, is
still invested in State stocks, which have since the last meeting of the
Board considerably increased in marketable value, and could now be
sold for more than was paid for them. The accumulation of half a
year’s income in the treasury at the beginning of last year has enabled
us to pay in cash for all the materials purchased and labor performed
on account of the Institution, and has thus not only been the means of ©
a saving by reduction in the cost of the operations, but also of pre-
venting the embarrassment and anxiety which has sometimes been felt
on account of outstanding debts, besides enabling us more readily to
adapt the expenditures to the several items of appropriation.

The Institution, during the past year, by its publications, exchanges,
researches, &c., has sustained the reputation it had previously ac-
quired, and has continued gradually to extend the sphere of its
influence and usefulness. By its persevering efforts to carry out the
will of the founder, it has succeeded in rendering familiar to the public
mind in the United States the three fundamental distinctions in regard
to knowledge, which must have an important bearing on the future
advance of science in this country: namely, the increase of knowledge,
the diffusion of knowledge, and the practical application of knowledge
to useful purposes in the arts.

It is of the highest importance to the well-being of our race that each
of these distinctions should be recognized, and that each of the pro-
cesses to which they relate should receive encouragement and support.
14 | REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In our country, however, they have not all met with an equal share
of attention, and at the beginning of this Institution the confusion
of ideas on this subject was so great that in the interpretation of the
will, even by some of our prominent and enlightened men, the diffu-
sion of knowledge was identified with its increase; and it was con-
tended that Smithson had used the terms as synonymous, and desired
by the one merely to enforce the other. But that this was not the
case may be gathered from the meaning attached to these terms hy
the class of mento which he belonged. ‘‘ While we may truly exult,”’
says one of his eminent contemporaries, *
national intellect, we must remember that diffusion and advancement

‘Cin the awakening of the

are two very different processes, and that each may exist independvat
of the other. It is very essential, therefore, when we speak of the
diffusion or extension of science, that we do not confound these stages
of development with discovery or advancement, since the latter may be
as different from the former as depth is from shallowness.’

That the diffusion of knowledge has been an object of solicitude to
the enlightened legislatures of almost every State in the Union is
evinced by the provision which has been made for libraries, schools,
academies, and colleges. The practical application of science to the
useful arts has received direct encouragement from the general gov-
ernment by the enactment of patent laws and the establishment of the
Patent Office. The fact, however, does not appear to have been so
constantly before the public mind that the advance of science or the
discovery of new truths, irrespective of their immediate application,
is also a matter of great importance, and eminently worthy of patron-
age and support. The progress of society and the increase of the
comfort and happiness of the human family depend as a basis on the
degree of our knowledge of the laws by which Divine Wisdom con-
ducts the affairs of the universe. He has created us with rational souls,
and endowed us with faculties to comprehend in some measure the
modes in which the operations of nature are effected; and just in
proportion to the advance we make by patient and persevering study,
in the knowledge of those modes or laws, are we enabled to apply
the forces of nature to our own use, and to avert the dangers to which
we are exposed from our ignorance of their varied influences.

“Myr. Swainson. Cabinet Cyclopedia, 1834.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. pane 35)

Nearly all the great inventions which distinguish the present cen-
tury are the results, immediately or remotely, of the application of
scientific principles to practical purposes, and in most cases these
applications have been suggested by the student of nature, whose
primary object was the discovery of abstract truth. The statement
cannot be too often repeated that each branch of knowledge is con-
nected with every other, and that no light can be gained in regard to
one which is not reflected upon all. Thus researches which at first
sight appear the farthest removed from useful application, are in time
found to have an important bearing on the advance of art, and conse-
quently on the progress of society. To illustrate this position, I shall
take the liberty of trespassing on your time with a few instances
gleaned from the history of inventions.

Astronomy was not studied by Kepler, Galileo, or Newton for the
practical applications which might result from it, but to enlarge the
bounds of knowledge, to furnish new objects of thought and contem-
plation in regard to the universe of which we form a part; yet how
remarkable the influence which this science, apparently so far removed
from the sphere of our material interests, has exerted on the desti-
nies of the world! Without its guidance what would navigation have
remained but a timid exploration of coasts and inlets, leaving the
fairest portions of the earth to be the heritage of rude and idolatrous
tribes? The steam-engine, in its improved form, is due to the labo-
rious scientific researches of Black, Watt, and Robinson, and the new
theory of heat, which is now occupying so much of the attention of
the abstract physicist, has lately served to modify our views of this
agent, and to develop new and important facts in regard to it which
will tend to economize its power, and increase the means of rendering
it more effectually the obedient slave of intelligent man.

In the year 1739, the Rev. Dr. Clayton communicated to the Royal
Society his discovery of what he called the ‘‘spirit of coal,’’? which
he confined in a bladder, and showed its burning powers as it
issued from a puncture in the membrane. Sixty years after this Mr.
Murdock, of Manchester, applhed this discovery to the purpose of
illumination; and what was at first a mere object of scientific research
has now become, from its almost universal employment, a necessity
of civilized life.

Early in the present century Davy published an account of a dis-
covery he had made of the effect produced on the nervous system by
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the respiration of nitrous oxide, a substance due to chemical research.
It was ascertained that the inhalation of the vapor of ether, another
chemical product, produced a similar effect, and these facts, many
years afterwards, were applied by Jackson and Morton, in our own
country, for the purpose of producing insensibility to pain, and thus
to relieve an incalculable amount of human misery, and to ameliorate
in a measure the original curse to which our race has been subjected.

Dr. Priestley, in the course of a laborious series of investigations
relative to the different kinds of air, subjected, on the Ist of August,
1774, to the heat of a burning lens (which is now, through the liber-
ality of one of his grandsons, the property of this institution) a
quantity of calcined mercury, and evolved from it a gas since known
by the name of oxygen, a discovery which led to a knowledge of the
composition of the atmosphere, and finally to the improvement of
almost the entire circle of the chemical arts.

About the middle of the last century Franklin devoted his sagacious
mind to what was deemed by some of his friends a trifling pursuit—
the study of the phenomena produced by the friction of different
substances when rubbed together. But from this investigation he
deduced his admirable theory of electrical induction, and the fact:
of the action of points at a distance, on which was founded the pro-
tection of buildings from lightning, and which, with the additional
discoveries of Volta, Oersted, and others, has given to the world the
electrical telegraph.

These are instances of investigations commenced without any idea
of immediate practical utility. They exemplify discoveries made
by men who studied science for its own sake, and received no other
reward than the consciousness of enlarging the bounds of human
thought, while it was left to others to gather a rich pecuniary har-
vest from what they had so effectually sown.

‘‘Tt is the destiny of the sciences,’’ says Fontanelle, ‘‘ which must
necessarily be in the hands of a few, that the utility of their progress
should be invisible to the greater part of mankind, especially if those
sciences are associated with unobtrusive pursuits. Let a greater
facility in using our navigable waters and opening new lines of com-
munication but once exist, simply because at present we know vastly
better how to level the ground and construct locks and flood-gates—
what does it amount to? The workmen have had their labors lightened,
but they themselves have not the least idea of the skill of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

geometer who directed them; they have been put in motion nearly
as the body is by a soul of which it knows nothing; the rest of the
world has even less perception of the genius which presided over the
enterprise, and enjoys the success it has attained only with a species
of ingratitude.”’

But it is not alone the material advantages which the world enjoys
from the study of abstract science on which its claims are founded.
Were all further applications of its principles to practical purposes
to cease, it would still be entitled to commendation and support
on account of its more important effects upon the general mind. It
offers unbounded fields of pleasurable, healthful, and ennobling ex-
ercise to the restless intellect of man, expanding his powers and
enlarging his conceptions of the wisdom, the energy, and the benefi-
cence of the Great Ruler of the universe.

From these considerations, then, and others of a like kind, I am fully
justified in the assertion that this Institution has done good service
in placing prominently before the country the importance of original
research, and that its directors are entitled to commendation for
having so uniformly and persistently kept in view the fact that it
was not intended for educational or immediately practical purposes,
but for the encouragement of the study of theoretical principles and
the advancement of abstract knowledge.

Smithson declares his bequest to be for the increase of knowledge
and the diffusion of this among men, being well aware that a single new
truth added to the general stock must affect man for good in all times
and all places. We doubt not that when the importance of the
abstract speculations of science is more generally and more justly
appreciated, individuals who are favored by Providence with those
peculiarities of mind which fit them for the advancement of science
will be set apart as the priests or interpreters of nature, and be
furnished liberally with the means necessary to benefit their fellow men
by the discovery of new principles. The grand philosophical vision of
the father of modern science, which has waited so long for its ful-
filment, will then be realized, ‘‘by the union and co-operation of all
in building up and perfecting’ that House of Solomon, (as Bacon
quaintly termed it,) ‘‘the end of which is the knowledge of causes
and of the secret motions of things, and the enlarging of the bounds
of human empire to the effecting of all things possible.’’

18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

\

Publications. —The publications of the Institution are now divided

7 mm quarto

into three classes: the ‘‘ Contributions to Knowledge,’
form; the ‘‘ Annual Reports’’ to Congress, and the ‘‘ Miscellaneous
Collections,’’ in octavo.

The eleventh volume of Smithsonian Contributions is nearly ready
for distribution, and will contain a number of origimal memoirs, which
are presented to the world as additions to knowledge of sufficient
importance to warrant their publication by the funds of the Institu-
tion. The fact, however, should be recollected that the Institution
does not merely publish these volumes, but, as a general rule, extends
its assistance to the original researches of which the papers published
contain the results, sometimes by furnishing the subjects or materials
of observation, and sometimes by defraying the whole or a part of
the expenses incident to such researches.

The first memoir contained in this volume is on North American
Oology, by Dr. Thomas M. Brewer, of Boston, an account of which
was given in a previous report. ‘The text of this work was printed
in 1857, but the preparation of the plates to accompany it not being
completed, it could not be included in any volume previous to the
eleventh. Copies, however, of the paper had been presented sepa-
rately to some of the principal naturalists of this country and Hurope,
and the work has been received with approbation as an important.
addition to the branch of natural history on which it treats.

The second paper is on the total eclipse of the sun, September T,
1858, as observed near Olmos, Peru, by Lieutenant Gilliss, United
States navy, illustrated by a plate of the appearance of the sun
during the total obscuration. A full account of this paper is given
in the last report of the Institution.

The third memoir in the eleventh volume has the following title:
‘*Discussion of the Magnetic and Meteorological Observations made
at the Girard College Observatory, Philadelphia, from 1840 to 1845,
by A. D. Bache, LL.D.” ~ Part 15 Investigation of the eleven-
year period in the amplitude of the solar-diurnal variation, and of
the disturbances of the magnetic declination.

About twenty years ago the British Association organized a series
of cotemporaneous magnetic and meteorological observations at dif-
ferent colonial positions in the British empire, with which most of
the civilized governments of the world co-operated. No assistance,

however, was rendered to the enterprise in this country,, except in
the instance here referred to, in which the observations were con-
ducted by Dr. Bache, at Philadelphia, by means of funds supplied
by the members of the American Philosophical Society and the Topo-
eraphical Bureau of the United States, and with instruments furnished
by Girard College. This series of observations commenced in May,
1840, and, with short interruptions, terminated in June, 1845, thus
furnishing a record extending over five years, for three or four
months of which the observations were made bi-hourly, and for the
remainder of the time hourly. A general reduction of these observa-
tions was published in 1847, by order of Congress, in three octavo
volumes, with an atlas of diagrams. The records, however, contained
facts of great interest, which, owing to the laborious duties of Pro-
fessor Bache, could not then be deduced from them, and he has since
renewed the investigation, with the aid of Mr. Schott, and the present
paper gives an account of the first results which have thus been
obtained.
_ To present the bearing of the interesting researches exhibited in
this paper on the progress of science, it may be proper to state that
the magnetic force of the earth is almost constantly disturbed, both
in direction and intensity.

1. It is subject to a change which appears to complete its cycle in
a large number of years, for the determination of which it is necessary
to know the magnetic state of various places on the globe simul-
taneously at a given epoch, and again after the lapse of several years.
2. It is subjected to a change which is completed in the course of a
year; and 3d, another which runs through its course in a single day.

Beside these regular disturbances, there is another series of varia-
tions, large in magnitude, denominated magnetic storms, which have
been, until lately, considered as fitful, appearing to observe no law,
but which were manifest over a considerable part of the earth’s
surface. These, however apparently irregular as to the individual
instances, are in all probability, as has been shown by General Sabine,
subject to a law of more frequency of occurrence in certain years.

The object of Professor Bache’s paper is to investigate from the
data furnished by the Girard observations, the law of recurrence of
the latter disturbances. Since this has not as yet been accurately
ascertained, and every independent series of observations when pro-
perly discussed is of great value in giving more precision to our
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

knowledge of one of the most remarkable classes of phenomena pre-
sented in the whole course of physical science, the results of this
discussion cannot but be received with much interest by the scientific
world.

As the magnetic needle, for example, may be considered as sub-
jected at the same time to different forces, each tending to produce
one of the variations we have mentioned, it becomes a subject of nice
inquiry to eliminate the several effects, and to obtain the magnitude
and period of each separately. In the case under consideration it
was necessary to separate more especially the large apparently fitful
variations from the regular daily ones. To effect this, the process
proposed by Professor Peirce, of Cambridge, and founded on the
doctrine of probabilities, was employed as a criterion in judging as
to the magnitude of a disturbance which should be considered as be-
longing to the class under consideration, and it was finally concluded
that all disturbances which exceeded 3/.64 of an arc were abnormal,
and accordingly all observations differing by that amount or more from
their mean monthly values were marked. Next, a new hourly mean
was taken, omitting the values so marked; and each observation again
examined in reference to deviations from this new mean, and so on—
the last mean thus obtained for each hour during each month gave
what was considered the normal daily curve.

From this it appears that the north end of the needle reaches its
‘greatest eastern position between 7 and 8 o’clock in the forenoon, and
its greatest western deviation about 1 o’ clock in the afternoon.

The author next proceeds to discuss the large disturbances, and
from these he deduces the fact that a principal maximum of disturb-
ances occurs in October, a smaller one in April, and the two minima,
mearly equal to each other, occur in the months of February and
June.

The diurnal variation arising from the large disturbances presents
one maximum and one minimum; its most prominent feature is the
easterly deflection, which occurs about a quarter after 8 o'clock
p. m., at which hour the maximum deflection amounts to 32” of an
arc; the great westerly deflection takes place at a quarter past 6
a.m., and en an average amounts to 14”.

These variations are compared with deductions made from similar
observations at Toronto, and are found to be the same in kind, but
less in magnitude.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Ze

The whole discussion clearly indicates a law of recurrence in the
frequency of the large disturbances, although the period over which
the observations extend was not sufficient to determine the interval.
The observations, however, indicate with great precision the time of
the minimum, the rate of diminution as the disturbances diminish in
approaching this period, and their increase as they recede from it.
The minimum thus found, of frequency of large disturbances, occurred
in August, 1843.

The establishment of the elements of a law of periodicity in rela-
tion to changes of the magnetic force which, from the time they were
first noticed until within a few years past, were regarded as entirely
irregular, is in its relation to terrestrial magnetism a fact of import-
ance; but the value of this is highly increased when it is found that
these disturbances are connected with changes in matter foreign to
our earth. To realize this, we must refer to a series of persevering
observations made day by day for thirty years on the spots of the
sun, by an astronomer named Schwabe, in an obscure town of Ger-
many. This devotion to an apparently unfertile field of inquiry was
finally rewarded by the discovery that the spots on the sun’s disc are
subject to a regular law of recurrence, and that they pass through the
phases of periods of greatest and least frequency in about eleven years;
but strange to say, it was afterwards announced by General Sabine that
the period of recurrence of large magnetic disturbances coincides
both in duration and its epoch of maximum with the period discovered
by Schwabe in reference to the solar spots; that is, that at the period
of greatest disturbances there occurs the maximum number of spots,
and vice versa. The investigations of Professor Bache serve to
establish this conclusion, and to furnish additional elements for amore
accurate comparison. From these results it is clear that the sun
exerts an influence on the magnetism of the earth which depends on
the existing state of its own luminous atmosphere, affording another
example to be added to other illustrations of the same truth, that
scientific researches, if skilfully and perseveringly continued, will
always lead to valuable results, and often to those which could not
have been anticipated by any previous conceptions.

The volumes of records of the Girard observations, which present
on casual examination immense series of tabulated figures in which
no law or regularity is observable, when scientifically studied and
properly interpreted, are thus found to yield truths of the highest
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

interest. Professor Bache proposes to continue his inquiries and ex-
tend his investigation to the influence of the moon and other agents
on the magnetism of the earth. He has already finished a second
paper on these discussions, and has a third in a state of considerable
advancement. These will probably forma part of the twelfth volume
of the Contributions.

The eleventh volume also contains a second series of the discussions
of the physical observations made by Dr. Kane during his last voyage
to the Arctic regions, the first part of which, or that relating to ter-
restrial magnetism, was published in the tenth volume of Contributions.
This second part relates to meteorology, and was prepared for publi-
cation in the intervals of his official duties by Chas. A. Schott, esq.,
assistant in the United States Coast Survey, under the direction of
Prof. Bache, and at the expense of the Smithsonian funds. This
memoir not only forms an interesting and important addition to
meteorology, which will tend to connect the name of our lamented
countryman with this branch of science, but also furnishes a model
for imitation, of the method in which observations of this character
ought to be reduced and discussed in order that they may best sub-
serve the advancement of science.

The following account of some of the points of the memoir and of
the facts developed will probably be generally interesting and serve
to illustrate its value:

The observations were made at Van Rensselaer harbor, on the
western coast of Greenland, and extend over a period of two winters
and a considerable part of two summers, during which the vessel was
constantly frozen in the ice.

They show in a very striking manner the constant and laborious
occupation of the little party in their lone abode, records having
been made at every hour of the day and night during the whole
period. It would be out of place in this report to, give a full account
of all the subjects discussed in this memoir, and I shall therefore
only glance at a few of the most prominent points, referring to the
paper itself for a full exposition of its more valuable contents. It
consists of three parts-—the first is on temperature, the second on
winds, the third on atmospheric pressure. The first part, viz. that
on temperature, gives the observations for every hour, from which
are deduced the diurnal and annual variations of the thermometer,
the influence of the different winds on the temperature, and an
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

analysis of the recurrence of cold periods during the winter; tables
deduced from the daily observations for ascertaining the corrections
required to be applied to observations made only once or twice a
day in order to obtain the mean temperature of places within the
arctic circle; and, finally, observations to determine the diminution
of temperature with an increase of elevation.

Beside the corrected records of the motion of the air, the second
part of the memoir contains the resultant direction, the average
force, the mean velocity, the quantity, the frequency, and the dura-
tion of the winds. The third part contains not only the record of
the pressure, but also a comparison of the mercurial and aneroid
barometers, the diurnal and annual variation, the regular fluctuations
of the monthly and annual extremes of pressure.

The expedition was supplied with thirty-six mercurial thermome-
ters, four maximum and minimum thermometers, twenty-four spirit
thermometers of different sizes, including two standards and a regis-
ter thermometer of thirty-six inches in length. A laborious series of
the different readings of these instruments, particularly at low tem-
peratures, was made, from which have been deduced corrections to
be applied to the records prepared for publication. The differences
exhibited by the spirit thermometers at low temperatures was referred
to the unequal contraction of colored alcohol not chemically pure.
This liquid, when exposed to a great degree of cold, appeared to
change its condition, the coloring matter being deposited on the sides
of the tube. The lowest temperature observed during the first
winter, 1853-54, was, February 6, —66°.4; and during the second
winter, 185455, occurred, January 8, —65 .5.

The highest temperature observed was July 23, 1854, +51°, giving
an absolute difference of 1179.4. The diurnal maximum or highest
temperature of the day occurred in October and November, about
one hour before noon, and in April and May, three hours after noon.

In the months of October, November, and December there are two
points of low temperature each day—one at 6 a. m., and the other at
about 9 p. m.; during the remaining months of the year there is one
minimum during the twenty-four hours, which occurs at 1 a. m.

It was a fortunate circumstance that the observations extended
over two winters, and thus gave a more exact mean for that season.
The warmest month is July, the coldest March; the temperature of
December, however, does not differ much from the latter. The
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETALE

highest mean monthly temperature seems to occur almost exactly in
the middle of July, and the lowest point would probably have been
found in February if the series had been extended over several
winters. The méan temperature of winter, namely, of December,

January, and February, was —28°.59; of spring, —10°.59; sum-
mer, 33°.38; autumn, —4°.03. The mean temperature for the
whole year was —2°.46. The temperature was always lowest

during calms, and rose with the springing up of a wind from any
quarter.

There is also a great regularity in the elevation of temperature
during the hours of the fall of snow; on an average the sensible heat
was increased during this period 7°.7. In seventeen months it
snowed during six hundred and eighty hours, and rained during sixty
hours.

A series of recurring periods of cold was observed, which Dr. Kane
seemed inclined to consider as intimately connected with the phases
of the moon, and on this point a series of elaborate investigations
was made by Mr. Schott, from which it was found that in a period
of six days on an average the cycle was completed, and that the
lowest temperatures are reached about the time of full moon. Setting
aside some small deviations in the regularity of the curves of tem-
perature, there is not a single exception to the correspondence of the
greatest cold near the epoch of full moon, and of least cold near the
time of the new moon. It*should be observed, however, that since,
from the observations made at this Institution, the waves, as it were,
of cold air which reduce the temperature of the United States,
frequently begin several days earlier at the extreme west, the same
coincidence as to identity of occurrence of the maximum cold with
any particular phase of the moon cannot be true of all points on the
surface of the earth, although the period of recurrence may, as in the
case of the tides at different places, be governed by that luminary.

A series of comparative observations at the level of the sea and at
the top of the mast of the brig, at eighty feet elevation, was taken
during the months of August, September, and October, from which
is deduced a diminution of temperature of 1° for two hundred and
ten feet of elevation. ,

The direction of the wind was noted in the original records with
reference to the magnetic points of the compass, and the mean results:
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

determined in regard to the true north. It appears from all the
observations that the true direction of the wind is from the eastward,
varying in the several months northward and southward. There is
but one exception, namely, in June; the wind then veers round to
the westward of south. The resulting direction for the whole year
is almost exactly east; in winter it is E.N.E. and in summer S.E. by 8.

The greatest quantity of air which moves over the place during
the year comes from a direction north of east. é

The predominance of calms is a circumstance quite characteristic
of this region. The number of hours of winds recorded was 3,697,
and those of still weather 5,063.

The snow or rain wind is between N.N.E. and E.S.E., or from the
direction of the Spitzbergen sea, and also from the opposite direction
of S.S.W., or that of the upper Baffin’s bay. From the northwestern
quarter there was hardly any precipitation.

During the whole period there were recorded thirteen gales, with
a duration of not less than two hours. They do not appear to be
confined to any particular season of the year, and on the average
continue about seven hours.

These records are of great interest in enabling us to ascertain
whether the great storms which pass over the United States can be
traced into the Arctic regions.

For observations on atmospheric pressure the expedition was pro-
vided with amercurial barometer and two aneroids, and from a series
of reductions of the observations of these instruments it is concluded
that the indications of the aneroid may generally be relied on to
within nearly one hundredth of an inch.

Owing to the small amplitude in the oscillations of the barometer,
and the magnitude of occasional disturbances, the law of diurnal
variation is apparently subject to considerable fluctuations. The
principal maximum is reached about one o'clock p. m.; the evening
maximum at about ten p. m., in conformity with the general law
deduced from observations in the northern hemisphere. The one
p.m. minimum seems to occur about three hours earlier than is
indicated at more southern stations.

_ The average maximum height of the barometer is above the mean
in the months of January, February, March, April, and May, and
descends below the mean in the remaining summerand autumn months.
The general law observed in other parts of the world, that the height
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of the barometer is less in summer than in winter, is prominently
exhibited.

The mean height of the barometer for the whole time was 29.775
inches, which is less than that for places under the tropics; and it
should be stated that Van Rensselaer harbor is fourteen degrees
farther north than the latitude 64° in which the height of the
barometer is a minimum.

The fluctuations in the height of the barometer were greater in
winter than in summer. The greatest pressure, 30.97 inches, oc-
curred in the morning of January 22, 1855; the lowest, 28.84 inches,
occurred near noon of February 19, 1854. Little change was ob-
served in the barometer during the fall of snow.

The barometer fell during the blowing of all the winds except those
from about north by east and southeast.

The observations indicate that the hottest winds are from the north-
east, one-half east, and the maximum atmospheric pressure nearly
east.

This memoir was referred for critical examination to Professor
Peirce, of Cambridge, and Professor Chauvenet, of St. Louis.

The next memoir is by Dr. John Le Conte, of Philadelphia, and is
intended to give a catalogue of the Coleoptera or beetles known to
inhabit the middle and eastern portions of the great central region of
temperate North America. The province here treated of includes
Kansas, a portion of Nebraska, and the eastern part of New Mexico.
Tis eastern limit is well defined, but its other boundaries are indefinite,
since it there fades imperceptibly into other provinces of the samegreat
zoological district. The descriptions of new species are principally
from specimens furnished through the Smithsonian Institution from
collections made by different explorers connected with the surveys of
the officers of the United States army.

Before proceeding to describe the special materials used in the
preparation of the memoir, the author gives a short sketch of the
results already obtained in regard to the geographical distribution of
coleopterous insects in this country, illustrated by a map on which
the several regions are distinguished by different colors. From this
map it appears that the whole area of the United States is divided by
nearly meridianal lines into three or perhaps four zoological districts,
distinguished each by numerous peculiar genera and species, which,
with few exceptions, do not extend into the contiguous districts.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. page

These districts are divided into a number of provinces of unequal size,
which are limited by differences in climate, and are therefore some-
times distinctly and sometimes vaguely defined.

The mode of distribution of species in the Atlantic and Pacific
districts is entirely different. Inthe Atlantic districts a large number
of species are distributed over a great extent of country; many species
are of rare occurrence, and in passing over a distance of several hun-
dred miles but small variation will be found to exist. In the Pacific
district a small number of species are confined to a limited region of
country. Most species occur in considerable number, and in travel-
ling even one hundred miles it is found that the most abundant species
are replaced by others, but of a similar character.

The object of the memoir is to give an account of what is known
of this class of insects in Kansas, upper Texas, and Arizona, and to
furnish means for facilitating the further exploration of the whole
country in regard to the same animals.

This will undoubtedly be considered a valuable addition to a branch
of zoology which, however insignificant it may appear to the popular
mind, is not only connected with questions of interest in relation to
abstract science, but also with the economical resources of the
country.

The memoir, beside the colored map to which we have alluded, is
illustrated by two engraved plates.

The next paper consists of the result of magnetical and hypsomet-
rical observations in Mexico, to which is appended notes on the
volcano of Popocatepetl and its vicinity.

In 1856 Baron Von Muller undertook an exploration of Mexico in
reference to its natural history, and proposed to the Smithsonian
Institution to make in its behalf a magnetic survey of the same country.
This offer having been accepted, an appropriation was made from the
Smithsonian fund to pay a portion of the salary of Mr. Sonntag, the
assistant of Baron Von Muller; and the magnetic instruments which
had been previously lent to Dr. Kane, and used by Mr. Sonntag
himself, as one of the assistants of that lamented explorer in his last
Arctic exploration, were furnished to the expedition for the contem-
plated survey. Several records of the unreduced observations made
at a number of places in Mexico, were at different times transmitted to
the Institution previous to the return of Baron Von Muller to Germany,
after which nothing more was obtained; and after considerable delay
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

we were informed by him that he had been robbed in Mexico, and that
the instruments had been captured and destroyed. Not having re-
ceived a final report from Baron Von Miiller, to render the observa-
tions which had been obtained from Mexico available to science, they
were placed in the hands of Mr. Sonntag on his return to Washington,
and have been reduced by him at the expense of the Institution. He
has also appended a series of notes relative to the volcano of Popo-
catepetl and its vicinity, and also a series of barometrical and trigo-
nometrical measurements of heights of various places in the vicinity
of the city of Mexico. The observations included those for the
declination or variation, the inclination or dip, and, lastly, those for
the relative intensity of the magnetic force. A series of observations
for each of these elements was made at the following places; namely,
Vera Cruz, Potrero, Cocolapam, San Andres, Mirador, city of Mexico,
Chalco, and Tlamacas. The average variation of the needle from the
whole series of observations was about 83° east; at the city of Mexico
it was 8° 46’ east. The average dip for the whole region was about
423°, and for the city of Mexico 41° 26’.

The interesting fact is noted in the appendix that the southwestern
wall of all the recent Mexican craters observed by the author is higher
than the northeastern wall—a phenomenon probably due to the action
of the trade-winds constantly impelling the ashes and cinders from
the northeast to the southwest. The elevation of eleven different
places was determined, including the city of Mexico and the highest
peak of Popocatepetl. The former was 7,472.8 feet, and the latter
17, 817.6 feet.

We regret very much the loss of the ree instruments, not
only on account of the use which might be made of them in deter-
mining the magnetic elements of different portions of the American
continent, but also on account of the interest which attaches to them
from ae been employed in the observations by Dr. Kane.
They have, however, done good service; and although the result of
the co-operation of Baron Von Miiller has not been as fortunate as we
could have wished, still it has added something of considerable value
to our knowledge of the terrestrial magnetism of this continent.

Another memoir, which will form a part of the 11th volume of
‘*Contributions,’’ is on the American storm of December 20, 1836,
and the European storm of December 25 of the same year, by Pro-
fessor Elias Loomis, of the University of New York.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

About twenty years ago this industrious meteorologist presented
to the American Philosophical Society an investigation of the first of
the above-mentioned storms, which extended from the Gulf of Mexico
to an unknown distance to the north. The area covered by the ob-
servations, and to which consequently the investigation was confined,
included only the southern part of the storm, and therefore the au-
thor regarded the results he had obtained, though of sufficient interest
to warrant publication, as not entirely satisfactory. Having since
obtained additional information, and adopted with success in the
study of similar storms a method of investigation which consists in
representing the disturbances of the atmosphere by lines and colors
on charts, he concluded to review his former labors, and to publish
all his results illustrated by a series of colored maps, which he is now
enabled to do through the provision made for this purpose by the
Smithsonian Institution.

The author first presents a summary of the observations of the
barometer at each of the American stations from which information
in regard to the indications of this instrument was derived. The
average height of the barometer at each of the stations is given, and
the fluctuations from this height during the storm, as well as imme-
diately before and after it. With these data a series of lines is drawn
on five charts, exhibiting the progress of the storm for as many suc-
cessive periods, namely, for December 19, at 8 o’clock p. m.; Decem-
ber 20, at 8 a. m. and 8 p. m.; December 21, at 8 a. m. and 8 p. m.
On each chart is drawn a line indicating the places of mean pressure
of the atmosphere, or those where the pressure is in a normal con-
dition, also a line indicating two-tenths of an inch of mercury above
the mean, &c. :

In examining these lines on each map, it is apparent that there
exists a large area over which the barometer was below its mean
height, which on the evening of the 20th of December extended 980
miles from west to east. On the morning of December 21 it extended
770 miles, and on the evening of the 21st it had become reduced to
600 miles in the same direction. It is evident, also, that toward the
north the limit of low barometer extended much beyond the map,
and, since the lowest point was found at Quebec, it is inferred that it
extended as far north as it did south of this point, and would, there-
fore, be on the 21st of December at least 3,000 miles in length from
north to south. The area, therefore, of least pressure was in the
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

form of an oval figure, having a length of three times its breadth,
and, from the inspection of the several maps, it will appear that it
travelled constantly eastward.

A similar table of observations is given in reference to the ther-
mometer as observed at fifty-seven places, and lines corresponding
to the mean temperature to ten degrees above and ten degrees below,
&e., are drawn on each of the maps. From these it appears that on
the evening of the 19th the area of greatest temperature extended
from 800 to 1,100 miles in an east and west direction. The centre
of this area of high thermometer did not coincide with the centre of
Jow barometer, but was uniformly somewhat to the east of it.

On the same charts the condition of the weather at different inter-
vals as to clearness, cloudiness, rain, &c., is represented by different
colors, and from these it will be seen that on the evening of the 19th
of December rain or snow was falling over the entire region west of
the Mississippi as far as the map extends, and that a cloud covered
the whole of the United States except that part bordering on the
Atlantic ocean. On the evening of the 20th the rain had reached
Washington, and on the morning of the 21st the cloud had covered
the whole of the eastern portion of the country, while the sky had
cleared off as far as Cincinnati, at the same time that rain was falling
in the whole of New England except the State of Maine. On the
evening of the 21st the storm was confined to a small portion of the
eastern part of the chart, while the sky over nearly the whole United
States, with a few exceptions of spots of limited extent, was free from
clouds.

The direction of the wind is indicated by arrows, and its intensity
shown by their length; and from these it is seen that during the en-
tire period within the area of rain and snow the direction of the wind
in the rear of the storm was from the west, northwest, or north, and
that in the southwest part of the United States the winds were some-
what more northerly than in the northwest part of the country. In
front of the storm the winds generally blew from « southerly point,
the average of which was 10° east of south, while in the south and
northern parts of the country in front of the storm the wind was
easterly. There was thus along a meridian line of at least 1,200
miles in length a violent wind from a point on an average 30° north
of west, and on the east side a strong current from a point 10° east
of south. These two contrary winds blew with great violence for at
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ol
least forty-eight hours, indicating an ascending current of air and a
tendency to rotation contrary to the motion of the hands of a watch.

The author next proceeds to offer some suggestions as to the origin
of the storm, which in the main agree with the exposition of the phe-
nomena as given in the theory of Espy, namely, the upward motion
of the air at the point of lowest barometer, the evolution of latent
heat by the condensation of the vapor which it contains, and the
transfer eastward of the whole disturbance by the flow of the upper
current in that direction. He attributes the principal cause of the
cold experienced to the upper current descending to the surface of
the earth. :

The European storm of the 25th of December of the same year is
investigated in the same manner, and the results illustrated by means
of eight separate maps, one for each day, commencing with Decem-
ber 21, including the beginning and ending of the disturbance. It
was at first supposed that this storm was a continuation of that of the
20th experienced in America; the rate of progress, however, of the
latter was such that it could not have reached Europe before the
27th, whereas the storm of the 25th was fully organized on the 23d,
and, indeed, its first movements can be distinctly traced in Germany
on the 22d. The European storm evidently originated in Europe,
and the American storm wasted itself in the Atlantic. It was,
however, the possible connexion of these two storms that induced
Professor Loomis to collect particularly, during a visit to Europe in
1856— 57, records of meteorological observations for this period. The
whole number of stations from which he obtained data was nearly
fifty.

It was mentioned in the last report that the Institution had con-
cluded to publish in full detail several series of meteorological obser-
vations made for long periods in different parts of the United States.

The 12th volume of Contributions will contain the first of these
series, by Professor A. Caswell, of Brown University. The observa-
tions commence with December 1, 1831, and end with December 31,
1859,* including a period of a little more than twenty-eight years.

These observations were made three times daily, embracing the
thermometer, barometer, the direction and force of the wind, the

These tables have been extended to June, 1860.
32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

degree of cloudiness, the amount of precipitation, and, for a portion
of the time, the psychrometer.

In addition to these fixed and regular observations, daily and special
notice was taken of all phenomena connected with atmospherica
changes, with storms, the aurora, &c. The barometrical observa-
tions are reduced to the level of the sea and the temperature of 32°
Fahrenheit.

The author has given a series of general summaries deduced from
the whole period; and when a sufficient number of similar observa-
tions for long periods are collected and published, they will be sub-
mitted to the process of exhaustive investigation similar to those to
which the observations of Dr. Kane have been subjected, in order to
determine peculiar points of interest relative to the climate of the
United States.

We have found that the printing of papers of this character re-
quires much time and is very expensive, since they are composed
almost entirely of rule and figure work. We think, however, the
value which will be attached to them will fully warrant the expendi-
ture on account of their publication. They will afford the data for
answering many questions which are propounded to the meteorolo-
gist, such as the period of recurrence of storms, the connexion of the
changes of the weather with the phases of the moon, &c. The means of
ascertaining the state of the atmosphere over a considerable portion of
the United States on any day for the last quarter of a century will be
interesting in many cases, independent of scientific considerations.

The report of the Regents to Congress for 1858, besides an ex-
position of the condition and operations of the Institution for that
year, was, as usual, accompanied by an appendix containing the report
of lectures, and other matter which has proved highly acceptable to
a large number of intelligent persons in every part of the country.
These reports, copies of which are especially solicited by teachers,
besides furnishing valuable knowledge not otherwise readily attain-
able, serve to diffuse information as to the operations of the Institu-
tion which tends to increase the number of its friends and co-opera-
tors, and to elevate popular conceptions in reference to science, as
well as to increase the number of its cultivators.

The number of copies of the report ordered to be printed at the
last session was less than that of the preceding year, yet the supply
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 303
to the Institution was the same. Indeed it is'a gratifying evidence
of the public estimation in which the Institution is held, that Con-
gress has been so favorably disposed, even during the depressed con-
dition of the treasury, towards the distribution of this document.

It was mentioned in the last Report that the Institution had made
arrangements for the preparation of elementary treatises on the dif-
ferent orders of insects found in North America, with a view to
identify the species and facilitate the study of their relation and
habits. Considerable progress has been made in this work, and sev-
eral parts are either in the press or ready to be given to the printer.
These treatises will afford the means of instructing the farmer in
regard to the character of the insect enemies with which he has to
contend, and will enable him by watching their habits, time of ap-
pearance, and mode of propagation, to add much valuable informa-
tion to what is already known relative to the method of guarding
against their ravages.

But before anything of this kind can be done systematically, we
must be able to recognize the insects, since the same animais are
known in different countries by different names. If, therefore, we
would avail ourselves of the facts which have already been gathered
by patient study in. this branch of natural history, we must be assured
of the identity of the species; and if we would make the knowledge
which already exists in this country generally available, the insects
must be described with that scientific precision which will enable
them to be immediately recognized with certainty in every part of
the world.

These treatises or catalogues will be illustrated by wood-cuts, and
published as a part of the Miscellaneous Collections of the Institu-
tion.

The last Report contains a series of instructions for collecting and
preserving specimens of insects, prepared by the following gentle-
men, viz: Dr. John L. Le Conte, of Philadelphia; Dr. B. Clemens,
of Easton, Pa.; Dr. P. Uhler, of Baltimore; and Baron R. Osten
Sacken, of the Russian Legation. These instructions have not only
directed attention to the subject, but furnished the means by which
a large number of specimens have been obtained for scientific inves-
tigation.

It will be recollected that it is one of the objects of the Institution

3
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to induce as many individuals as possible, in various parts of the
country, to devote their leisure hours to special objects of natural
history—to point out to them the pleasures derived from studies of
this kind systematically pursued, and the important results which
will flow from their labors when combined with those of other per-
sons in the same line, and also to facilitate by catalogues, descriptions,
and correspondence, the progress of the student in the elementary
part of his studies. In connexion with this object, circulars have
been distributed directing special attention to different points,
among which we may mention one on American grasshoppers, an
insect to the ravages of which a large portion of the United States
is frequently subjected, and relative to which every well authenticated
fact is of considerable interest. Another circular has been issued in
regard to the collection of nests and eggs of birds, to furnish the
material for a continuation of Dr. Brewer’s work on Oology.

The fact was stated in a previous report that materials had been
collected for a new edition of a report on the libraries of this country,
originally prepared by Professor C. C. Jewett. This work was en-
trusted to Mr. William J. Rhees, chief clerk of this Institution, to
be done out of the usual hours of his official duties; but the materials
which were collected contained so much information relative to edu-
cational and other institutions, which was thought too important to be
omitted, that the report when completed was found to exceed the
limits assigned by the Institution; and rather than abridge it by
leaving out a part of the material which had cost so much labor,
Mr. Rhees offered to publish it on his own account; and such an
arrangement being compatible with the general policy of the Institu-
tion, the proposition was agreed to, and the work has accordingly
been issued under his own name and responsibility. It forms a
volume of 700 octavo pages, and contains a large amount of very in-
teresting and valuable matter which has cost the author a much
greater amount of labor than can ever be repaid by even an extensive
sale of the work.

In this connexion we may mention that a list of the libraries, soci-
eties, and institutions in North America, has also been prepared by
Mr. Rhees and printed for the use of the Institution. It forms an
octavo pamphlet of 81 pages, and is found of much value in facili-
tating the distribution of our several classes of publications and in
directing circulars, &c.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 30

Researches. —Mr. L. W. Meech has continued his mathematical re-
searches in regard to the light and heat of the sun, and, since the
date of the last Report, has succeeded in integrating some of the an-
alytical expressions which had previously appeared likely to prove
exceedingly troublesome, and the analysis is now sufficiently advanced
for another publication. His next memoir will treat of the relative
intensity of the sun’s rays after passing through the air to the earth’s
surface. It will be recollected that his former memoir presented, in
tables and curves, the intensity of the sun’s rays at the exterior of
the atmosphere. The primary formula, to be given in this memoir,
has been demonstrated and verified, and the derived formule are
mostly made out for the range and other phases of the intensity of
the light and heat. These depend on what are called elliptical func-
tions, and are much more complicated than those of the former paper.
Before curves can be drawn from them, the numerical values for every
five degrees of latitude are to be computed and checked, which will
require the labor of several months. To defray the expense of this,
another small appropriation will be required. The success of the
previous labors of Mr. Meech warrants this expenditure, from funds
intended for the increase of knowledge, since the results which can.
now be obtained from his formula will, in all probability, be consid-
ered standard elements in the physical theory of heat.

Dr. Wolcott Gibbs has continued his chemical researches, and a paper
in relation to them will probably appear in the next volume of Con-
tributions. It will present new processes for the separation of all the
platinum metals in a state of absolute purity. These are very simple,
and easy of execution, and not only apply to the separation, but to
the quantitative analysis of mixtures of the different metals of this
group in almost any proportion. The researches also involve the
preparation and properties of a new and remarkable series of salts,
which, it is thought, will remove the difficulties with which the sub-
ject has hitherto been surrounded.

It was stated in the last Report that one of the most important op-
erations in which the Institution had been engaged during the previ-
ous year was the construction of a map to present at one view the
arable, forest, and sterile portions of the United States. The design
at first was merely to exhibit the limits or boundaries of these por-
tions of the country, and this has been faithfully executed by Dr. J.
G. Cooper, to whom the work was intrusted, as far as the materials
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

could be gathered from all the accessible published data, the records
of the Land Office, and other sources. The facts presented at once
to the eye by this map are in striking accordance, as we have before
mentioned, with the deductions from the meteorological materials
whicn have been collected at this Institution, and serve to place in a
clear point of view the connexion of climate with the natural produe-
tions of different parts of the earth. The plan has, however, since
been enlarged, and Dr. Cooper now proposes, with the aid of the
Institution, to construct a map which shall give in detail the distribu-
tion of the several kinds of trees and shrubs found in different por-
tions of the country; and, in view of this, he has prepared an article,
which has been published and widely distributed by the Institution,
containing a list of the localities of the most important and useful
trees and shrubs, as far as known, and asking additional information.
The chief difficult:; in carrying out the plan has been the want of
definite knowledge as to the locality of different plants; for example,
a plant is mentioned as occurring in Virginia, but this statement is
not sufficiently precise, since this State occupies a large surface,
on asmall portion of which only the plant may be found. Facts are
also required as to the abundance of trees in a given locality.

The collection of the material for a map of this kind, in connexion
with a work on the forest trees of America, still in progress by Dr.
Asa Gray, of Cambridge, is a very important matter both in a politi-
cal and an economical point of view, and the work might be materially
aided, without much expense to the government, by appending a few
additional queries to the questions propounded by the marshals who
collect the statistics of the census. The outline map, which has al-
ready been prepared at the expense of the Institution, has excited
much interest, and the proposition to enlarge the plan of the work
has been received with commendation.

As an interesting object in regard to physical geography, and
intimately connected with meterology and various branches of natural
history, a commencement has been made, in connexion with the Coast
Survey, in collecting materials for the construction of a hypso-
metrical map of the United States.

No part of the surface of the earth, of equal dimensions, has been
so extensively traversed by lines of explorations for canals, railways,
and river improvements, as the United States. The materials, how-
ever, which are afforded by these, for constructing a map of the ele-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. BY

vations and depressions of the surface of the country are widely scat-
tered, and unless an effort be made to collect them will ultimately be
lost. Previous to the connexion of the Institution with this enterprise,
circulars were sent by the Coast Survey to engineers and directors
of public works, m answer to which replies were received giving the
elevation of a large number of points. Since this connexion another
circular has been issued, to which a large additional number of an-
swers have been received. The whole number of points heard from
is about 9,000. Many of the replies to the circulars have been ac-
companied by valuable topographical information and maps, some of
which, as testified by the contributors, were rescued from the obliv-
ion which has been the fate of the records of many of the earlier sur-
veys. For the exhibition of these points, in connexion with the to-
pography of the country, it is proposed to have them plotted on a
map consisting of two sheets, with a projection of spp5¢500- One
sheet is to show the surface east of the Rocky mountains, the lines
of water courses, and is to be filled up from the best existing maps; the
western sheet is to be copied from the map of the same scale, issued
from the office of the Pacific Railroad explorations. An accurate out-
line map of the United States on this scale will be of great import-
ance as a base-chart on which to delineate the result of various other
statistical inquiries which have been instituted by this establishment.

Mr. Lewis H. Morgan, of Rochester, New York, having studied for
several years the ethnological peculiarities of the Indians of the
North American continent, has discovered among them a system of
relationship which he wishes to compare with the systems of con-
sanguinity existing among the natives of other countries, and the
Institution, at his request, in order to aid in this research, has dis-
tributed circulars to our consuls, missionaries, and ethnologists in
various parts of the world. The peculiar system of relationship of
the Iroquois, one of the principal families of American Indians first
attracted the attention of Mr. Morgan. The fundamental idea of this
system, which is carried cut with great logical rigor, is, that the bond
of consanguinity is never suffered to lose itself in the ever diverging
collateral lines—the degrees of relationship are never allowed to pass
beyond that of first cousins; after that the collateral lines are merged
in the lineal lines, so that the son of a cousin becomes a nephew,
and the son of this nephew becomes a grandson. This principle ex-
tends upwards as well as downwards, so that the brother of a man’s
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

father becomes his father, and the brother of his grandfather be-
comes also his grandfather. At first Mr. Morgan supposed this ;
peculiar system to be confined to the Iroquois, but subsequent inves-
tigation developed the fact that the same system in its complexity
and precision is common to all the Indian tribes of North America.
It therefore becomes an object of interest to inquire whether the
same system exists among the natives of any other country. It is
proper to remark that, at the request of the Institution, General
Cass, the Secretary of State, has given to this interesting inquiry
the official sanction of his Department, and in a letter appended to
our circular, has commended it to all the diplomatic agents of the gov-
ernment abroad.

Laboratory.—During the last year the laboratory has been under
the direction of Dr. B. F. Craig, of this city, and, as in former years,
a considerable number of specimens of the products of different parts
of the country have been examined. The policy adopted from the
first in regard to examinations of this kind is to furnish a report free
of cost to the parties asking for the information, provided it is
of general interest and immediately connected with the advance of
science, and can be afforded at little expense to the Institution. If,
however, the examination is required principally to promote private
interests, a charge is made suflicient to cover the expense of the in-
vestigation. By the adoption of this policy, the laboratory is kept in
operation by means of a small appropriation for chemicals and ap-
paratus.

It may be proper to mention that during the year Dr. Craig has
been engaged in investigations, on his own account, in the laboratory,
and that Mr. J. H. Lane has made a series of experiments relative
to different points connected with the Atlantic telegraph.

Magnetic Observatory.—The remaining instruments necessary to
complete the equipment of the magnetic observatory established at
the joint expense of the Institution and the Coast Survey were re-
ceived and put into operation in the early part of the year; but as it
has been found that the changes in the direction and intensity of the
elements of terrestrial magnetism at Toronto, Philadelphia, and
Washington are almost precisely the same, it has been considered
that more important service would be rendered to the inquiries now
being made in regard to this branch of physics, if the instruments were
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. a9
placed in some more distant position, and it has been determined to
send them to the Tortugas, a group of islands within the Gulf of
Mexico, at which the United States coast survey has also a tidal
station. A single instrument, however, is still to be kept in opera-
tion at the observatory to record the changes in declination and to
exhibit the perturbations connected with the appearance of the
aurora borealis.

Exchanges. —The general system of international exchange, which has
been the subject of so much attention heretofore, continues to increase
in magnitude and importance. By reference to the special report on
this subject, it will be seen that the operations have been more exten-
sive in 1859 than during any preceding year. The facilities afforded to
the operations of the Institution in the department of exchanges and
of natural history by various transportation express companies, as
referred to in the preceding reports, have been continued throughout
the year. The steamers of the North German Lloyd have carried a
large amount of freight for the Institution, free of charge, between
Bremen and New York, as promised by their directors, at the in-
stance of Mr. Schleiden, minister from Bremen, resident in Wash-
ington. The steamer lines to California, consisting of the Unitsp
States Matt Co., M. O. Roberts, President; the Panama RaILRosD
Co., David Hoadley, president; and the Paciric Mat Co., W. H.
Davidge, president, transported a large amount of material for the
Institution up to the expiration of their mail contract in October, when
the NortH ATLANTIC STEAMSHIP Co., I. W. Raymond, president, re-
placed the United States Mail Co. in the line, which has since
continued the same favors. Mr. Bartlett, of New York, has offered
the use of his line of ships to the west coast of South America, and
the exchanges with Chili are now carried on chiefly through his ves-
sels. The steamer Isabel, Messrs. Mordecai & Co., of Charleston,
agents, has transported a number of packages for the Institution be-
tween Charleston and Key West, free of charge, and Messrs. Russell,
Major & Waddel, army contractors of transportation to Utah, have also
rendered valuable service in this line. The Adams Express Co., through
Mr. Shoemaker, the superintendent of its southern division, has also
exhibited liberality in reducing its charges greatly on heavy freights,
and in carrying small parcels free of cost. It is difficult to esti-
mate the value to the Institution of all these services. They are
interesting as exhibiting a high appreciation of the mission and
operations of the Institution, at the same time that they disclose a
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

spirit of liberality as gratifying as it is beneficial. It is believed that
an amount of at least $1,500 has been saved by these free freights dur-
ing the year, a sum which in effect may be considered as having been
added to the income of the Institution, and thereby correspondingly
increasing its means of usefulness. Acknowledgments are due to a
number of persons in the United States who have assisted without
charge in distributing the volumes of Smithsonian Contributions, viz:
Hickling, Swan & Brewer, of Boston; D. Appleton & Co., New York;
J.B. Lippincott & Co., Philadelphia; Russell & Jones, Charleston;
Robert Clarke & Co., Cincinnati; and Bloomfield, Steele & Co., in New
Orleans. Messrs. J. W. Raymond and Mr. W. H. Wickham, of New
York, and Mr. A. B. Forbes, of San Francisco, agents of the California
lines referred to above, have rendered services of a similar character.

It is gratifying to be able to repeat the statement made in previous.
reports, that all Smithsonian packages are allowed to pass free of
duty and without examination at the custom-houses of all the civil-
ized countries with which the Institution is in correspondence.

Library.—During the past year the plan adopted in regard to the
increase of the library has been constantly kept in view, namely, to
procure as perfect and extensive a series as possible of the transac-
tions and proceedings of all the learned societies which now exist or
have existed in different parts of the world. The library, in this
respect, is now perhaps the first in the United States, and has in-
creased, since the date of the last Report, not only by the addition of
the current publications but by a number of new series and of volumes.
to complete sets hitherto imperfect.

The catalogue of the serial publications of foreign learned societies,
State governments, universities, public libraries, and private parties,
contained in the library, mentioned in the last report, has been pub-
lished. It forms a book of 259 octavo pages and includes all the
collections of the kind above mentioned, down to the middle of the
year 1859. Copies of this have been sent to all the foreign societies,
with a request that deficient series of volumes or parts of volumes
be supplied, and that any works of the same kind which are not to
be found in the catalogue be furnished from duplicates at the disposal -
of any of the establishments with which the Institution is in cor-
respondence.

The distribution of this catalogue to the principal institutions of
this country and abroad will not only facilitate the completion of the:
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Al

design of forming as perfect a collection as possible of transactions,
but will also render the library more generally useful to the cultiva-
tors of science in the United States. But the most important means
of facilitating the use of a special library of this class of works will
be that of the publication of the classified index of all the physical
papers contained in the transactions, now in progress at the expense
and under the direction of the Royal Society of London. This
index is confined to papers relating to astronomy, mathematics, and
general. physics, and even with this restriction will include about
250,000 titles.

Professor J. Victor Carus, of Leipsic, informs us that during the
last two years he has been collecting materials towards a general
catalogue of zoological literature, from 1750 up to the present day,
including not only all the separately published works, books, and
pamphlets, but also and especially all the papers, notices, and articles
contained in periodicals, the number of which is increasing every
year. The titles and references will be arranged systematically, not
according to the alphabet of authors, but within the classes and
groups according to the alphabet of the genera, so that at a glance
the whole literature of a particular genus may be found. The
author calls for aid in obtaining information as to American zoological
papers contained in periodicals difficult of access, and any one who
can assist in this desirable object would confer a favor by forwarding
to him, through the Institution, information bearing on this subject.

To assist in the same general plan of facilitating the acquisition of a
knowledge of what has been done in different branches of science,
the Institution has authorized the preparation of a bibliography of
American botany, by Mr. Thurber, of New York, under the direction
of Dr. Torrey.

Since the date of the last Report, the act amendatory of the law
relating to the disposition of books intended for copyright has gone
into operation. This act merely requires that one copy of every
article intended to be secured to the author by copyright is to be
deposited with the clerk of the district court from whom the certifi-
cate is obtained, and repeals the requirement that a copy should be
presented to the library of Congress and to that of the Smithsonian
Institution. All the books which have heretofore been deposited
with the district clerks, and those which may be obtained in future,
are to be arranged in the Patent Office, where they will form an
AI REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

extensive collection, the support and preservation of which,. however
interesting to the bibliographer, are not in accordance with the gen-
eral objects of the Smithsonian Institution, although as the means of
securing evidence of title they are in strict conformity with the
design of the Patent Office.

Few, comparatively, of the books which were received by the In-
stitution under the operation of the copyright law were of any
scientific value, and by far the greater number, consisting of ele-
mentary school books and publications designed especially for children,
were entirely foreign to the plan of the library, and yet they have cost
the Institution for postage, certificates, entries, care, &c., several thou-
sand dollars. It now becomes a matter of consideration as to their
disposition, and petitions have been received from the Washington
Library and that of the Young Men’s Christian Association, of this
city, that they may be placed in their charge. Without expressing
any opinion as to the propriety of complying with these requests, I
beg to submit these propositions to the Board.

The operation of the former law of copyright illustrates the neces-
sity of caution, on the part of the Institution, in receiving miscel-
laneous donations into a special collection without careful discrimi-
nation, particularly if the gift is coupled with the condition that
the articles are to be perpetually preserved. Without care in
this respect a large amount of trash must inevitably accumulate,
which will interfere with the extension of the collection in the
desired direction.

Among the special donations to the library are a series of expensive
illustrated works from the Duke of Northumberland, privately printed
by him as materials for the history of the county which bears his
name. They include a survey of the Roman wall which was built across
the north of England, a description of coins of the Roman families,
some of which were found in that locality, and an‘account of some
ancient castles which possess historical interest.

Another portion of the great work of Lepsius on Egypt has been
presented by the King of Prussia, and valuable donations in the way
of completing our transactions have been received from different
societies.

The purchases for the library have been principally in the way of
completing such transactions and of supplying such additional series
as we have failed to obtain through our exchanges.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

The library now contains a very large collection of the catalogues
and reports of different public institutions in this country, which have
been classified and arranged in a separate apartment so as to be
readily accessible for statistical inquiries; and we trust that this
collection will continually be enlarged by additions of the current
reports, particularly those of all institutions which receive the Smith-
sonian publications.

Meteorology. —The arrangement between the Patent Office and this
Institution in relation the collection of meteorological statistics still
continues. The amount appropriated, however, by the former has
been less than in previous years. The observers have very much in-
creased in number, and are now divided into three classes—the first
making records with a full set of instruments, the second with a
thermometer and rain gage, and the third without instruments; all,
however, reporting the state of the sky, the direction of the wind,
beginning and ending of storms, and casual phenomena. All the
observations which have been taken since 1854 have been reduced,
and are uow in the hands of the Commissioner of Patents to be pre-
sented to Congress as an Appendix to his Agricultural Report. It is
presumed they will be ordered to be printed since they form an in-
teresting part of the agricultural statistics called for by the Depart-
ment of the Interior.

The several systems of observations made in different parts of the
American continent have been continued and extended during the
past year. Those under the direction of the Surgeon General of the
United States have been made to include the new military posts of
the army, and a series of investigations of much interest has been
prosecuted in California by Lieut. R. S. Williamson, of the topo-
eraphical corps, relative to the diurnal changes, the diminution of
temperature depending upon elevation, and the extent of simultaneous
barometrical fluctuations.

Observations have also been made by the following surveying and
exploring parties, sent out under different departments of the gov-
ernment, viz:

Under the INTERIOR DEPARTMENT:

The Wagon Road Expedition from South Pass to California, under
command of F. W. Lander.

The survey of the boundary between Texas and New Mexico,
John H. Clark, commissioner.

In addition to the regular observations, the following were re-
ceived by the Institution during the year 1859:

From Dr. 8. P. Hildreth, Marietta, Ohio, observations for forty-
two years, from 1818 to 1859, inclusive, on the barometer, thermom-
eter, and amount of rain, with remarks on the weather.

From Professor A. Caswell, Brown University, Providence, Rhode
Island, observations for twenty-eight years, from 1832 to 1859 inclusive,
on barometer, thermometer, winds, rain, and remarks on the weather.

From Dr. Nathan D. Smith, near Washington, Arkansas, observa-
tious for twenty years, from 1840 to 1859, inclusive, on thermometer,
rain, and remarks on the weather.

From Hiram A. Cutting, Lunenburg, Vermont, abstracts of ther-
mometer observations, from 1848 to 1858, inclusive.

From Henry Connelly, Rigolet, Esquimaux bay, Labrador, observa-
tions on barometer and thermometer, from November, 1857, to May,
1859, inclusive.

From Abram Van Doren, Falmouth, Virginia, psychrometrical ob-
servations at Mount Langton, Bermuda, from November, 1847, to
May, 1848, and from November, 1848, to March, 1850, inclusive.

From Dr. John F. Posey, Savannah, Georgia, hourly barometrical
and thermometrical observations during half the day for about ten
days in each month, from May, 1858, to September, 1859, inclusive.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. A‘

From Queen’s College, Kingston, Canada West, summary of ob-
servations for 1858.

The observations from Captain George G. Meade, noted on the
opposite page, consist of fifty-eight sheets, made with full sets of
instruments, on the northern and northwestern lakes, from June,
1858, to November, 1859, inclusive. The continuation of these will
be of much value in regard to the climate of this region. Those from
Captain A. W. Whipple were made at Oswego harbor, Detroit river,
St. Clair flats, and Lake George, of St. Mary’s river, for the purpose
of determining the rise and fall of the lake surface, from the year
1854 to 1859, inclusive.

Between four and five thousand newspaper notices of the weather
of 1859 have been cut out and preserved. Besides the papers re-
ceived by the Institution, a large number of exchange papers are
obtained from the office of the Evening Star. These two sources
together furnish the means, either by original or copied articles, of
obtaining popular notices of the principal changes of weather and
meteorological phenomena in nearly all parts of the country. The
method of preserving the scraps is to paste them on sheets arranged,
not by the date of the paper, but by that of the occurrence noted.
‘By this arrangement all notices of any storm, hot or cold terms,
aurora, earthquake, or any other phenomenon, are brought together,
no matter how widely apart may be the place of publication. It
would be an acceptable donation if all readers, when they meet with
any meteorological scrap worthy of preservation, would send the
paper containing it to the Institution, or the article cut out, with the
name, date, and place of publication of the paper plainly marked on
the slip. Without these marks it would be sometimes impossible
to identify either time or locality. The preferable mode is to send
the entire paper.

A general distribution of blanks is made twice a year. In this
distribution twelve blanks are sent to each observer, one for each
month, to be retained for his own use, and one to be returned to the
Institution.

As the registers come from all parts of the country, and arrive at
different times, a number are received every day, sometimes as many
as thirty or forty. A book is kept containing the names of all the
observers, with their place of observation; and when the registers
are received, an entry of each one is made in this book, so that, by
inspection, it can be seen at any time for what months registers have
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

been received from each observer. A memorandum is also made of
deficiencies, omissions, instruments used, discontinuance, change of
address, or such other items as may be necessary for reference or to
show the character of the observations. The date of the reception
is marked in red ink on each register, and they are placed on
shelves, those for each month being kept together. With the re-
gisters, letters are often received asking for information on meteor-
ological and other subjects. These embrace a very wide range of
inquiry, and, with the other letters received, make large demands on
the time of the secretary. When a number of registers have accu-
mulated, they are sent to Professor Coffin, at Haston, Pennsylvania,
who, with his corps of assistants, makes the reductions and prepares
them for publication.

Early in March, when a sufficient time is supposed to have elapsed
to allow all, or nearly all, the registers for the preceding year
to be received by due course of mail, an examination of the record
is made, and a notice is segt to each observer, whose register for
any month may not have reached us, informing him of the deficiency,
and requesting that, if possible, it may be supplied.

It sometimes happens that through loss in the mail or other causes
the blanks fail to reach some of the observers, and their stock, there-
fore, becomes exhausted before the time for the semi-annual distri-
bution. In such cases, as soon as the Institution is informed of the
fact, a new supply is forwarded.

Three forms of blanks are now distributed, corresponding to the
three classes of observers: First, a large blank, marked No. 1, which
contains columns for the records of the barometer, its observed
height, attached thermometer, and height reduced to the freezing
point; of the thermometer in the open air; the psychrometer, or
wet and dry bulb thermometer; the depth of each rain and snow,
with the time of beginning and ending; the direction and force of
winds; the kind, amount, and motion of clouds; and also for the force
of vapor and relative humidity of the atmosphere as deduced from
the observations with the wet and dry bulb thermometers.

Second, a blank half the size of the former, marked No. 2, and
contaiming all the columns which are on the first blank, except those
for the barometer and psychrometer, and the deductions from them.

Third, a blank the same size as the second, marked No. 3, and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AT

containing columns for such observations only as may be made without
any instruments, viz: the amount, kind, and motion of clouds; the
time of beginning and ending of rain and snow, the direction and
force of wind by estimation, and general remarks on the weather.
On the reverse of all the blanks is a place for remarks on casual
phenomena, as tornadoes, auroras, meteors, &c.

The importance of such meteorological records as may be kept with-

out instruments seems to be much underrated, and many persons have
declined to make or continue observations unless supplied with full
ssets of instruments, assigning as a reason that such records can be of
no value. But a little reflection will show that these observations
may furnish interesting and important information. If kept daily
and in all parts of the country and sent to the Institution, they would,
without the aid of any other record, enable an investigator to deter-
mine the direction and rate of motion of every storm, hurricane,
tornado, and thunder shower in the United States, and also the time
and place of their origin and termination when these occurred within
the limits of the observers.

They would enable him to mark out with accurate lines the districts
most subject to these atmospheric disturbances, and those free from
them or only partially visited, and also the portions of the year at
which they are most or least frequent. They would enable him to
ascertain the number, extent, and principal phenomena of all the
auroras, earthquakes, and meteors; the occurrence of the first, last,
and severe frosts, the comparative duration of clear and cloudy
weather, and the prevailing winds, both surface and upper current.
If to ascertain these points in the meteorology of every part of
North America is important, then the keeping such records as may be
made without instruments ought not to be omitted. While there are
persons in every neighborhood in this country who could faith-
fully and accurately fill these blanks, the number who can obtain
instruments and properly observe them must be comparatively limited,

Frequent applications are made to the Institution offering to record
meteorological observations for a reasonable pecuniary compensation.
But the policy originally adopted, on account of the want of means,
of declining to pay observers, has been uniformly adhered to. To
depart from this policy, while it might here and there secure an addi-
tional observer, would involve difficulties of discrimination altogether
disproportionate to the advantage gained. While, however, no
A8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

pecuniary compensation is made to observers, the facilities exten ed
to them, besides the reports and other documents occasionally dis-
tributed, though not expected to be a remuneration for the time and
labor devoted to the subject, are still of some value. An inducement
also exists in the pleasure to be derived from the study of the changes
of the phenomena of nature, besides the consciousness of co-operating
with many others in a system intended to advance an important branch
of science.

Although the information derived from the system of observations,
under the immediate direction of the Institution, is exceedingly*
valuable in many points, it is to be regretted that changes in the
observers are so frequent. The value in determining the great ques-
tion as to the periodicity of the weather and its average conditions
as to heat, moisture, cloudiness, occurrence of frosts, &c., other things
being the same, depend upon the length of time the series of observa-
tions have been continued, and results which may be relied upon
as the element of insurance against failure of crops and disasters by
storms are valuable strictly in proportion to the number of years
embraced in the observations.

The reason why meteorology is not further advanced is not on
account of the want of observations, but of extended series at a
number of properly chosen places. From observations of this kind
it is found that much of the apparent irregularity and caprice of the
weather is due to our limited vision, and that by extending the records
and properly studying them, many phenomena which are apparently
fitful and exempt from all law will be reduced to order and periodicity.

According to Mr. Glaisher’s investigations of the records made at
the Royal Observatory for a long series of years, there is a rotation
in the character of the weather at London about every fifteen years,
the seasons growing warmer and warmer until they reach a maximum
of temperature, and then gradually colder until they come to the
lowest point, when they begin a new cycle of temperature. A series
of meteorological tables may appear to the casual observer a mere
mass of dull, uninteresting figures, yet a little study will enable us,
says a popular writer of the day, to read in them the past history of
‘‘rich harvests, prosperous commerce, good health, plenty, and con-
tentment; or, perhaps, the gloomier side of the picture, scanty crops
and high prices, stagnant trade and social irritation, prevalent diseases
and busy death;”’ and, it might be added, a still greater interest is
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

inspired by the prospect they afford, that in the course of time they
will not only reflect the past but foreshow the future, and enable us
by their timely monitions to avail ourselves of the benignity, or
guard against the ravage of the coming day.

During the year 1859 a remarkable exhibition of the Aurora
Borealis occurred, and special efforts have been made to collect all
the reliable observations which could be obtained in regard to this
phenomenon. The materials thus accumulated have: been arranged
and will be published in order to render them generally accessible.
‘The occurrence of the Aurora, as is well known from the observa-
tions of Arago and others, is attended with a remarkable disturbance
of the magnetic needle; and since the latter, as has been shown in
the account of the paper of Dr. Bache, is connected with the spots
on the sun, it would follow that the Aurora, although apparently of
electrical origin, is connected with influences entirely exterior to our
planet, and hence precise information as to its appearance over so
wide an area as that in which it was exhibited about the beginning
of September last, must be specially acceptable to the student of
terrestrial physics.

Two remarkable meteors have appeared during the last year, one
of which exploded near the boundary between New York and Mas-
sachusetts, and the other apparently descended to the earth either in
Delaware bay or in the ocean in its vicinity. All the facts collected
in regard to these mysterious visitants of our atmosphere have been
referred to scientific gentlemen for critical examination, the results
of which will be published either by the Institution or in the Ameri-
ean Journal of Science.

The reduction of the current observations is continued by Professor
Coffin, who is also engaged, with the assistance of the Institution, in
the investigation of the winds of the southern hemisphere and in the
extension of his previous researches in regard to those in the northern
hemisphere.

The office duties of distributing the blanks; arranging the meteoro-
logical material and returns received from-observers; of superintend-
ing the observations made at the Institution, and in assisting in the
Smithsonian publications relative to meteorology, are assigned to Mr.
William Q. Force, of Washington, and to his industry, ingenuity, and
efficiency the system owes many improvements.

50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Musewm.—During the year 1859 the labelling and repairing the
specimens received from the Patent Office, and setting up and classi-
fying new specimens collected by the Institution, or deposited by dif-
ferent government explorations, have been uninterruptedly continued
under the immediate direction of Professor Baird.

The extensive series of corals collected during the United States:
exploring expedition have been arranged and labelled by Professor
Dana, of New Haven, by whom they were originally described, and.
now constitute an interesting and attractive part of the general mu-
seum. We have also employed a distinguished conchologist, Mr. P.
P. Carpenter, of Warrington, England, to classify and label the ex-
tensive collection of shells, and have been favored in this work with
the co-operation of the principal gentlemen most distinguished in
this country for their original investigations in this branch of natural
history. Mr. Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, assisted by Dr. Foreman,
has named the Unionide; Mr. Binney, of New Jersey, the Helicide;
Mr. Stimpson, the shells of the eastern coast of the United States;
and Dr. Gould has identified the new species of the exploring expe-
dition, and rendered aid in the classification of the collection gene-
rally. Assistance has also been rendered by Mr. J. G. Anthony, Mr.
James Lewis, Dr. Newcomb, and Mr. Lapham.

A taxidermist has been constantly engaged in going over the col-
lection. He has mounted several hundred new specimens of birds,
and set up a considerable number of large quadrupeds.

According to the statement of Professor Baird, the number of en-
tries in the record books, of additions to the museum, in the line of
zoology, during the year 1859, amounts to 11,691, and the whole
number of records in all the books is 87,197; but, as explained in
previous reports, this number is far from exhibiting the aggregate of
specimens catalogued; each entry frequently includes all the speci-
mens of any one species received at one time from one locality, and,
in some cases, embraces several hundred individual objects. It will
not be too high if we estimate five specimens on the average to each
entry, and we shall then have 185,985 as the aggregate of these ob-
_ jects now in the museum. In addition to the foregoing, there is a
large collection of specimens in ethnology, botany, mineralogy, and
geology.

The object of the Institution in obtaining so large a number of du-
plicates is, that they may be distributed for the advancement of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. DF

knowledge to persons who may be engaged in original investigations
in natural history, to museums for the completion of their lists, and
also to colleges for the purposes of education.

As it is not a part of the policy of the Institution to form a general
collection like that of the British museum, which can only be the
work of the general government, but to assist in advancing and
diffusing a knowledge of the natural history of North America, we
have been anxious to distribute the duplicates in such a manner as
to render them subservient to the objects in view, and it is hoped
that we shall begin the work of distribution within the present year.
As usual, a number of young gentlemen have availed themselves of
the facilities offered by the library and collections of the Institution to
prosecute their researches in different branches of natural history;
and in some cases, in which such confidence seemed fully justified,
series of specimens have been intrusted for examination to indi-
viduals at a distance. Although the primary object of the Institu-
tion is not educational, yet the museum is arranged with especial
reference to the study of the elements of different branches of science;
and the distribution of the extra specimens will furnish the means of
diffusing a knowledge of natural history more generally throughout
the country.

Explorations—A number of expeditions sent out by the general
covernment have been furnished with instructions, and in some cases
with apparatus for the collection of objects of natural history, and
several explorations have been undertaken by individuals under the
immediate auspices of the Institution. I need only mention in this
place that conducted by Mr. Robert Kennicott in the regions of the
Hudson’s Bay territory and in Russian America. This young gentle-
man is assisted by the Smithsonian Institution, the University of
Michigan, the Audubon Club and Academy of Sciences of Chicago,
and a number of liberal-minded persons interested in natural history.
His labors have been greatly facilitated by the cordial co-operation
of Sir George Simpson, governor, and the other officers of the Hud-
son’s Bay Company, to whom we are also indebted for valuable dona-
tions of specimens and records of meteorological observations.

For a detailed account of the explorations and the museum, I refer
to the report of Professor Baird hereto appended.
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The interest is still kept up in the lectures, although they occasion-
ally called forth criticisms on account of the character of particular
courses, which, while they are received with much interest by one
class of hearers, are not in accordance with the taste of those whose
pursuits or reading lie in an opposite direction.

While a large number of persons regularly attend the lectures for
the sake of the advantage to be derived from them, others, and par-
ticularly young persons, attend as a mere pastime, or assemble in the
lecture room as a convenient place of resort, and by their whispering
annoy those who sit near them. Frequent complaints have been
made on this account, and it has been suggested that it might be
well to try, as an experiment, a plan similar to that adopted at the
Lowell Institute, in which, as in the case of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, free lectures are given to a promiscuous audience. To secure
proper order, and to prevent the interruption of the speaker by per-
sons arriving after the lecturer has commenced, a series of numbered
tickets may be distributed at the commencement of the season, and
the names of the persons who receive them entered in a book, oppo-
site the number of the ticket; and in addition to this, the doors may
be closed a few minutes after the lecture commences.

Respectfully submitted.

EXCHANGES.

As in previous years, a continuous increase and expansion of ope-
rations has taken place in this department. The annexed tables will
give a better account of their magnitude than any general remarks
on the subject. It will be sufficient to say that the number of insti-
tutions and individuals in the United States availing themselves of
the Smithsonian facilities now embraces nearly all those publishing
works of a scientific and literary character.

The expenses of the system of exchanges conducted by the Insti-
tution have, of course, increased with the expansion of operations,
and but for the free facilities so generously accorded by various par-
ties would have arisen to such an amount as to render it necessary to
call on each of the institutions benefited for a share of the cost.
This has not yet been done, except in the case of the United States
Coast Survey, which has greatly exceeded all the rest in the bulk of
its transmissions; but it may soon be required from other parties.

The thanks of the Smithsonian Institution for free freights of pack-
ages containing exchanges and specimens of natural history are espe-
cially due to the following companies:
56 REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

The North German Lloyd steamers, running between Bremen and
New York, of which Messrs. Gelpcke, Keutgen, and Reichelt, 84
Broadway, are agents. This line has carried 250 cubic feet for the
Institution at a single trip, without charge.

The California steamer line, consisting of the Pacific Mail Steam-
ship Company, between San Francisco and Panama, (as well as
between San Francisco and the ports of Oregon and Washington
Territory,) of which Mr. W. A. Davidge is president; the Panama
Railroad Company, David Hoadley, president; from Aspinwall to New
York the line at first consisted of the United States Mail Steamship
Company, M. O. Roberts, president, up to the 5th of October last,
when it was replaced in the route by the North Atlantic Steamship
Company, I. W. Raymond, president. Theagents of thisline, Mr. W..
H. Wickham, at New York, and Mr. A. B. Forbes, assisted by Mr.
Samuel Hubbard, at San Francisco, have also been very zealous im
their attentions to the interests of the Institution.

Messrs. Adams & Co., through the superintendent of the southern
division, Mr. S. M. Shoemaker, of Baltimore, and the Washington
agent, Mr. A. J. Falls, have very materially aided the Institution by
a reduction of freights on heavy goods, and their remission entirely
on small packages. This has also been done by Messrs. Wells, Fargo
& Co. in California. ;

The line of sailing vessels between New York and the west coast
of South America, belonging to Mr. Bartlett, 110 Wall street, has
continued to carry our Chilean exchanges free of charge.

To Mr. Edward Cunard, of New York, the Institution is indebted
for the offer to carry a specified amount of freight from New York to
Liverpool by his steamers, free of charge—a privilege which has al-
ready, in part, been made use of.

The Isabel steamer, running between Charleston, Key West, and
Havana, has also continued to carry packages free of charge, through
the liberality of the agents, Messrs. Mordecai & Co., of Charleston.

Messrs. Russell & Jones, contractors of army transportation to
Utah, and through Kansas and Nebraska, have also kindly extended
the facilities of their line to the Institution.

Considering the large amount of freight which some of the above-
mentioned lines transport annually for the Smithsonian Institution, it
will readily be understood how much they have assisted in carrying
out its objects, as, with a fixed income, the expenses of the ex-
changes and natural history operations conducted by the Institution
would be entirely beyond its present means.

58 REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

The great increase in the number and bulk of packages of books
sent abroad during the period reported on is owing to several causes.
Among these may be mentioned the fact that the table embraces the
statistics of three different transmissions, rendered necessary by the
accumulation of materials in the Smithsonian building. A large pro-
portion of the works sent consisted of such publications of the
United States government as the Pacific Railroad Report, the Mexi-
can Boundary Report, the Report on Commercial Relations, the Coast
Survey Report, &e.

Of the Pacific Railroad Report alone, over one hundred sets were
sent, in behalf of the War Department, to the principal public libra-
ries and societies in Europe, and more than three hundred copies of
the Coast Survey Report to similar institutions. The Patent Office
exchanges with parties in Europe also occupied a very large bulk.

MUSEUM.
ADDITIONS TO THE MUSEUM.

Extensive as were the additions to the museum in 1858, (exclusive
of those transferred from the Patent Office,) those of 1859 have ex-
ceeded them in magnitude and extent. The number of separate do-
nations amounted to 301, (127 in 1858,) embracing nearly 500 different
packages. A detailed list of these donations will be found at the end
of this report, to which I would refer, and I will proceed here to
mention more in detail such of the collections received as from their
importance appear to require it.

As heretofore, most of the large collections were received from
officers in charge of parties under different departments of the gov-
ernment. Although the number of these parties has not been as
great as in some other years, the results attained by them are in no
way inferior in importance.

EXPLORATIONS UNDER THE WAR DEPARTMENT.

1. Construction of wagon road from Walla- Walla, Oregon, to Fort
Benton, under Lieutenant John Mullan, U. S. A.—This expedition,
with Dr. Mullan as medical officer, went to California in the spring,
by steamer, and thence to Walla- Walla, the starting point. Supplies
were sent up the Missouri by the steamers of the American Fur
Company of St. Louis, one of which made the first trip through to
Fort Benton. The supplies were accompanied by Mr. John Pear-
sall, an assistant of Lieutenant Mullan, who made large collections of
nests, eggs, birds, insects, and fossils. Collections were also made
by Lieutenant Mullan, between Walla-Walla and his winter camp,
near Fort Owen, not far from the Bitter Root valley, where he was
established at the last advices.

2. Exploration of the Upper Missouri and Yellowstone. under Cap-
tain J. W. Raynolds, U. S. A.—This expedition, accompanied by Dr.
“Hayden as geologist and naturalist, went up the Missouri in the steam-
boat of the Fur Company, in June last, and disembarked at Fort
Pierre. From this starting point they proceeded across to the Yel-
lowstone, at Fort Sarpy, and thence, after various lateral explora-
tions, to their winter quarters on Deer creek, at the crossing of the
Platte, about 100 miles west of Fort Laramie, and in the immediate
vicinity of the Upper Platte Indian agency, in charge of Major Twiss.
During the winter, excursions have been made in different directions
for the purpose of geological explorations, and large collections se-
cured in all departments of natural history. The collections received
in Washington from Captain Raynolds consist mainly of the zoolo-
gical series gathered up to the arrival of his party at Fort Sarpy, and
embrace specimens of birds, eggs, insects, &c.
64 REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

3. Exploration of the San Juan river and Upper Colorado, under
Captain J. N. Macomb, U. S. A.—This party, accompanied by Dr.
Newberry as geologist and naturalist, did not get into the field until
a late period in the summer, and returned before winter to the east.
The principal results of the expedition, independently of interesting
geographical discoveries, are to be found in the department of geology,
in which Dr. Newberry was enabled to extend his observations made
while on the Colorado expedition under Lieut. Ives. Among other
fossils, Dr. Newberry obtained remains of a new genus and species
of extinct lizard, larger than any formerly found in North America.

4. Explorations with the army in Utah, under Captain Simpson,
U. S. A.—This party, under Captain Simpson, accompanied by Mr.
Charles 8S. McCarthy as collector, left Fort Leavenworth for Camp
Floyd, in May, 1858, reaching its destination in September. From
this time until March, 1859, the party was occupied in making roads
between Camp Floyd and Fort Bridger, and in marking reservations.
From May to August, 1859, Captain Simpson explored two wagon
road routes between Camp Floyd and Genoa, in Carson valley, which
shorten very much the distance from Salt Lake City to California.

As much of this region had never been before traversed by scien-
tific men, the results were very interesting, consisting of several new
and peculiar forms of fishes, as also of reptiles, insects, &c. Many
rare birds, with their eggs, were also procured.

The party left Camp Floyd for Leavenworth in August, by way of
the Timpanogos, the Uintah mountains and the valley of the Green
river.

In addition to large zoological collections made by Mr. McCarthy,
Mr. Engelmann, the geologist of the expedition, made some important
geological discoveries, and brought in many fossils and plants.

UNDER THE STATE DEPARTMENT.

5. Survey of the northwest boundary: Archibald Campbell, esq.. com-
missioner.—This expedition, with Dr. Kennerly as the surgeon and nat-
uralist, and Mr. George Gibbs as geologist, has already been referred
to in previous reports. ‘These gentlemen have continued to make
large collections during the year, those received filling twelve boxes.
The specimens gathered about the Chiloweyuck depot proved parti-
cularly interesting, from including a new salmon, Anodonta, and other
species of animals. The collections also embrace skins and skulls of
the Aploceras montanus, or Rocky mountain goat, the only ones known
in American collections; also of Lagomys princeps, or little chief hare,
and skins of Lagopus leucurus, the white-tailed ptarmigan, and of the
black-throated diver, Colymbus arcticus, in adult summer dress.

UNDER THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.

6. Exploration of the Parana and its tributaries, under Captain
T’. J. Page, U. S. N.—This survey, in continuation of that prosecuted
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 65

by Captain Page several years ago, is accompanied by Mr. Christopher
Wood as taxidermist, and has already sent home quite a large collec-
tion of birds, embracing several rare and perhaps new species.

UNDER THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.

T. Wagon road from El Paso to Fort Yuma, under Colonel Leech.—
This expedition returned to Washington in 1858, but the collections
did not arrive until early in 1859. These were made by Dr. 8. Hayes,
and consisted chiefly of a large and valuable herbarium, embracing
several new species of plants.

8. Wagon road from the South Pass to California, under Colonel F. W.
Lander.—This party passed so rapidly over the country as to be unable
to do much in the collecting of specimens of natural history. Mr.
James A. Snyder, who had charge of this department, among other
duties, succeeded in obtaining specimens, both in skin and in alcohol,
of the very rare Lagomys princeps, or ‘‘coney’’ of the Mormons.
These were captured in the Wahsatch mountains, to which, according
to Colonel Lander, they appear to be chiefly confined.

IN CONNEXION WITH THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

9. Exploration of the vicinity of Fort Tejon and of Cape St. Lucas,
by Mr. John Xantus.—Among the very important researches in the
natural history of America, the explorations of Mr. John Xantus de-
serve particular mention. In previous reports, the collections made
by Mr. Xantus at Fort Tejon have been referred to. During a resi-
dence there of about sixteen months, from the summer of 1857 to the
autumn of 1858, although constantly occupied with official duties, he
has exhausted the natural history of the vicinity of the fort in the
most thorough manner. All departments are fully represented in his
collections, which filled thirty-five boxes ; the birds alone embracing
nearly 2,000 specimens and 144 species.

Professor Bache, the Superintendent of the United States Coast Sur-
vey, having determined to establish a tidal station at Cape St. Lucas,
Lower California, Mr. Xantus was placed in charge, and reached the
Cape in April last. He has since that time made, in the intervals of
his official duties, and forwarded to Washington, collections which vie
in thoroughness with those of Fort Tejon, and exceed them in number
of species, embracing as they do the marine as well as the fresh water
and land forms. Of 42 species of birds first received from him, 8 are
new; of crustaceans, there are over 100 species, many of them new;
while in all other departments the collections have been proportion-
ately great.

The results obtained at Cape St. Lucas by Mr. Xantus add another
to the many benefits to natural history as well as to physical science
rendered incidentally by the operations of the United States Coe t
Survey, as shown previously in the important collections of Lieutenant
Trowbridge, Mr. Wurdemann, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Wayne and others.

66 REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

10. Explorations of the Hudson's Bay Territory, by Mr. Robert Ken-
nicott.—Mr. Kennicott, under the patronage of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and by the assistance of the University of Michigan at Ann
Arbor, the Audubon Club of Chicago, the Chicago Academy of Sci-
ences, and a number of gentlemen interested in the natural history of
the Arctic regions, has ‘been during the past year engaged in an ex-
ploration of the north, which promises results of no ordinary import-
ance. His labors have been greatly facilitated by the cordial co-
operation of Sir George Simpson, governor of the territory, and the
officers of the service, especially of Mr. Barnston, of Michipicoten,
and Mr. B. R. Ross, of Fort Simpson. Mr. Kennicott left in May for
Lake Superior, via Toronto and Collingwood. From Fort William, on
Lake Superior, he was conveyed to Norway House in the Company’s 8
boats, and thence towards.Fort Simpson, on the Mackenzie. At the
latest advices, of July 29, he had reached Methy or La Loche Portage,
and, in company with Mr. Ross, it was his expectation to proceed in a
few days to Fort Simpson, there to winter. He intends inthe spring
to go to Great Slave or Bear Lake to collect eggs, and hopes to re-
main long enough in the north to spend another spring and summer
on the Youkon of Russian America, and another on the shores of the
Arctic ecean, north of Great Bear Lake.

A small portion only of the collections made by Mr. Kennicott have
yet reached Washington; those gathered between Norway House and
Portage La Loche having arrived at Pembina too late to come down
this year. Among the specimens received, however, is a fine skin of
the rare Larus Sabini, or the fork-tailed gull, shot on Lake Winnipeg.

Mr. Kennicott was accompanied to Lake Winnipeg by Mr. Charles
A. Hubbard, of Milwaukie, who returned home in the fall, by way of
Fort Garry and Pembina, from whom the Institution received a val-
uable collection of eggs, and through him, from Mr. Donald Gunn, a
number of birds and of specimens in alcohol.

11. Explorations on the Saskatchewan, by Captain Blakiston, Ra A.—
The Institution has also received some interesting collections made on
the Saskatchewan, by Captain Thomas Blakiston, R. A., through the
Royal Artillery Institution at Woolwich, London. These consist of
eggs and skins of birds, several of the former of which are rare and
new to our museum. |

Dr. Rae, the celebrated Arctic traveller, presented to the Institution
specimens of Spermophilus parryi from Repulse bay, latitude 56° 30’
north, thus supplying an important addition to the collection of North
American mammals.

12. Various other points on the west coast.—Other collections of in-
terest consist of nests, eggs, and skins of birds, and of other animals
from Fort Umpqua, sent by Dr. Vollum; of skeletons of the sea otter,
by Mr. R. W. Dunbar; of specimens in alcohol, by Mr. Alexander Tay-
lor; and of eggs, by Dr. C. A. Canfield.

13. Explorations of Fort Crook, by John Feilner, esqg.—Mr. Feilner
during the past year has made large coliections of birds and mam-
mals at Fort Crook, rivalling those of Mr. Xantus at Fort Tejon.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 67

Among them are good specimens of such rare birds as Picus william-
sont, albolarvatus, thyroideus, ke.

14. Exploration in the Rocky mountain region.—In addition to the
government collections of Captain Simpson and Captain Macomb, Dr.
Wdersan U.S. A., has continued to send a number of rare birds froin
Cantonment Burgwin. Dr. Irwin, U.S. A., at Fort Buchanan, has also
made large collections for the Institution, none of which, however,
have yet been received except one box of birds. Dr. George Suckley,
U.S. A., while accompanying a detachment of troops from Leaven-
worth to Camp Floyd, made some interesting collections, including the
eggs of the Rocky mountain plover. Several rare animals have also
been received from Colonel Vaughan, Indian agent for the’ Blackfeet,
near Fort Benton-

Dr. Brewer, U.S. A., presented to the collection, through Captain J.
H. Simpson, some rare reptiles and shells from southern Utah.

15. Explorations in and near Florida.—Dr. H. Bryant and Mr. Wil-
liam Cooper spent the winter in the Bahamas chiefly in and about
Nassau, and made rich collections of animals, series of which were pre-
sented by them to the Institution.

Dr. J. G. Cooper visited Key West in March, and thence proceeded
to Cape Florida, where he spent two months, and another month om
Indian River and the St. John’s. In addition to extensive zoological
collections, Dr. Cooper paid particular attention to the trees of Florida,
and succeeded in obtaining several West Indian and tropical species.
not previously known to occur in the United States.

A large number of marine animals in alcohol, and of birds and their
eggs, were collected at the Tortugas for the Institution by Captaim
Woodbury, U.S. A., and by Dr. Whitehurst.

Dr. Bean, of Micanopy, Florida, has also furnished a collection of
the eggs, reptiles, and fishes of the State. Among the first are the
only eggs of the glossy ibis,' [bis ordit, yet detected within our limits.

In connexion with Florida explorations, with which he was so clcesely
associated, itis my painful duty to mention the death, during the past
year, of Mr. Gustavus Wurdemann, a tidal observer of the United
States Coast Survey, and for many years an active correspondent of
the Smithsonian Institution. Occupied with the important scientific
duties incident to his place in the Coast Survey, Mr. Wurdemann yet
found time for attention to natural history; and at his different stations,
of St. Joseph’s islands, Texas; Calcasieu,* Louisiana; Fort Morgan,
Alabama; and Key West, Tortugas, Indian Key, Key Biscayne, Char-
lotte Harbor, &c., Florida, made collections “rine have proved of the
greatest service in supplying information concerning the zoology of
the Gulf region. Independently of the many new and little known
crustacea, shells, and other marine animals collected by Mr. Wurde-
mann, he succeeded in adding several species of birds to the fauna
of the United States; among others, Larus cucullatus, Certliola fla-
veola, Quiscalus baritus, Cor vus Americanus var. floridanus, Ardea
Wiirdemanni, &e.

16. Miscellaneous localities. —A collection of eggs and birds of II-
linois was received from Mr. Tolman; of insects and reptiles of
68 REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

Kansas, from Mr. H. Brandt; and of eggs, reptiles, and shells,. from
St. Charles’s College, Louisiana. Mr. Theodore Gill, during a vist
to Newfoundland, obtained a collection of fishes and invertebrates for
the Institution. Mr. Willis, of Halifax, has also furnished valuable
collections of eggs and shells. For a statement of many other im-
portant additions to the Smithsonian Museum from private sources, I
beg leave to refer to the list hereunto appended.

17. Other parts of the world.—A series of skins of the tropic-birds,
and of eggs of birds breeding on the Bermudas, has proved of
much interest for comparison with North American. These were
presented by Chief Justice Darrell; a collection of fishes and reptiles
from Nicaragua, presented by Dr. H. C. Caldwell, United States
navy, embraced several species new to the Smithsonian collection.
Mr. McLeannan, of the Panama Railroad Co., has presented to the
Institution many species of birds taken on the Isthmus not before
in the museum. Captain Dow, of the same company, has also sup-
plied a pair of living curassows.

18. Miscellaneous collections.—One of the most important additions
to the museum during the year has been made by Mr. William Stimp-
son, embracing, among other specimens, the whole of his collection
of shells of the Atlantic coast, including the types of his ‘‘shells of
New England,’”’ and the ‘‘marine invertebrates of Grand Manan.’
A large portion of the collection consists of specimens in alcohol, of
many species, the animals of which are almost entirely unknown
elsewhere.

With this collection and that of the exploring expedition, and
other parties from the west coast, the Smithsonian Institution has
within its walls the best single collection extant of the marine shells
of North America.

Dr. Jan has presented, on the part of the Museo Civico, Milan, of
which he is director, a large number of species of snakes, for the most
part types of his great work on serpents. ;

From the zoological museum of the University of Copenhagen,
Dr. J. J. Steenstrup, director, the Institution has received types of
various species of radiates, crustacea, &c., described by C. F.
Liitken, Dr. H. Kroyer and others.

WORK DONE IN CONNEXION WITH THE COLLECTIONS.

Much progress has been made during the year in putting the speci-
mens already exhibited in the museum in order, in adding additional
ones, and in properly labelling and arranging the whole. So much,
however, is required to be done, that it is not to be wondered at if
the amount actually accomplished is not at first fully realized by the
visitor. The taxidermist has completed the change of stands of all
the mammals and of the North American birds on the south side of
the hall, and is now engaged on the exotic birds. He has also
mounted several hundred birds, chiefly from fresh specimens, for
the purpose of exhibiting deficient species of more special interest.

A considerable number of large quadrupeds have also been
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 69

mounted and put in place—such as two grizzly bears, a cinnamon
bear, an antelope, a pair of mule deer, several wolves, &c.

The labor of cataloguing, entering, and arranging the collections
has also been diligently continued during the year, as shown by the
accompanying table. Much assistance in this has been derived from
the voluntary services of Mr. Robert Kennicott, Mr. E. Coues, Mr.
Prentice, Mr. A. J. Falls, and others.

The actual number of entries during the year amounts to 11,691,
being the difference between the aggregates of 1858 and 1859, and
2,343 more than the entries of 1858. As explained in previous re-
ports, these numbers are far from exhibiting the aggregate of speci-
mens catalogued, except in the case of mammals, birds, and osteolo-
gical preparations.

Hach entry generally includes all specimens of the same species re-
ceived at one time from a given locality, and may embrace hundreds
of individual objects. Thus in the oological catalogue, one number
covers 242 eggs of the white ibis, Ibis alba, received from Dr. Bean.
In a similar manner one entry of shells may embrace hundreds or
even thousands of specimens. It will not be too high an estimate,
probably far below it, to assume 5 specimens as the average to each
number, making 185,985 as the aggregate of objects entered on
the record books.

At the present time there remain to be catalogued as many, proba-
bly, as 10,000 jars of fishes and other alcoholic specimens, independ-
ently of the entire series of the crustacea, radiates, &c., collected by the
North Pacific and Behring Straits Expedition; the fishes of the Wilkes
Exploring Expedition, in the hands of Professor Agassiz, embracing
over a thousand species; the skins of the birds of the same expedition;
and the shells, radiates, &c.; many thousand series of fossils, vegeta-
ble and animal, both vertebrate and invertebrate; all the insects,
70 REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

worms, microscopical preparations, &.; a large portion of the eth-
nological collections, the entire herbarium, &c., amounting, in all
probability, to 100,000 numbers.

The series of skins and eggs of North American birds has been
entirely rearranged during the year to accommodate the large increase
both of the species and the specimens. This has only been done ap-
proximately in regard to the mammals, as the additions have been so
great, since their first arrangement in 1857, as to require a study of
the entire class in order properly to determine their names.

The corals have all been arranged and fully labelled by Professor
J. D. Dana during the year, and now constitute a highly interesting
and important feature of the public collection.

During the, year the services of Mr. P. P. Carpenter, the well
known conchologist, having been secured, he is now at work upon the
arrangement and labelling ‘the shells, the whole labor of which will
probably be completed in 1860. The co- operation of all the Ameri-
can conchologists, known as original investigators, has also been ob-

tained, and the objects of their especial attention ‘submitted to them

for determination; the Unionide to Mr. Lea, assisted by Dr. E.
Foreman; the Helicide to Mr. Binney; the east-coast shells to Mr.
Stimpson; the west-coast to Mr. Carpenter himself; while Dr. Gould
has identified the new species of the exploring expedition, and ren-
dered aid in the criticism of the collection generally. Much assist-
ance has also been rendered by Mr. J. G. Anthony, } Mr. James Lewis,
Dr. Newcomb, Mr. Lapham, and other gentlemen, who have ma ude
conchology a speciality.

In the proposed method of arrangement of the shells, the types of
descriptions, and a good representative of each species in different
ages and varieties, w rill be cemented to square plates of glass; the se-
ries, illustrating geographical distribution, being kept in trays.

A specimen of each species of North American shell will be ex-
hibited on the glass plates in table cases, lined on the bottom with
black paper; but of exotic shells there will only be table surface
enough for a type of each genus. The other portions of the series
will be kept in drawers below the tables. It is also proposed, for the
more ready appreciation of points connected with geograplucal dis-
tribution, to keep in separate series the shells of northern China,
Japan, and the North Pacific; the boreal shells of the west coast as
far south as San Diego; the marine shells from San Diego to Panama;
the marine shells of the west coast of South America; the marine shells of
the Atlantic coast to Fernandina, Florida; the marine shells of Florida,
the West Indies, and the Gulf of Mexico; and the different American
land and fresh water species. The shells of the rest of the world, with
a few exceptions, will probably be arranged in one systematic series.

As stated in the last report, a large portion of the collections in
charge of the Smithsonian Institution are in the hands of various
eminent naturalists for determination. Professor Agassiz and Mr. J.
C. Brevoort have different portions of the series of fishes; Mr. Bar-
nard, certain Echini; Professor Agassiz, the turtles; Mr. Cassin the
South American birds; Mr. Lyman, the Ophiuride; Mr. Putnam, the

/
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ut

Etheostomoids; Drs. Torrey and Gray, the exploring expedition plants,
&c. None of the collections, stated last year to be out of the build-
ing, have yet been returned.

Much progress has been made upon the descriptive works on North
American Diptera, by Dr. Loew and Baron Osten Sacken; on Newroptera,
by Dr. Hagen; on Hymenoptera, by Mr. De Saussure; on Coleoptera, by
Dr. Leconte; on Hemiptera, by Mr. Uhler; and on Lepidoptera, by Dr.
Morris, based, toa greater or less extent, on specimens supplied by the
Smithsonian Institution. Itis hoped that nearly all these works will be
submitted to the Institution during 1860; and their publication can-
not fail to give an impetus to the “study of entomology, so important
in its application to the interests of agriculture. In this connexion it
may be proper to state that a circular has been drawn up by Mr.
Uhler,and published by the Institution, embodying numerous queries,
having for their object the eliciting such information respecting
the habits and history of the grasshopper tribes of North Americaas
may serve as a basis of operations in restraining their ravages.

A circular intended to secure contributions of shells from different
localities in North America, and a new edition of the circular in ref-
erence to North American eggs, have also been prepared for distribu-
tion.

PRESENT CONDITION OF THE COLLECTIONS.

In the last report I presented a list of all the great collections
constituting the bulk of the museum of the Smithsonian Institution,
and the additions since then are enumerated in the following pages.*

* For convenience of reference, it may be well to continue the enumeration here from
page 55 of the report for 1858 :

fe REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

The more prominent results of additions to the museum during the
current year are to be seen in the approach to completion of the series
of North American mammals and birds by the reception of such rare
species as Lagomys princeps, Aploceros montanus, &. Specimens of
the musk ox, barren ground bear, and reindeer, with other species,
collected by Mr. B. R. Ross for the Institution, were detained at Pem-
bina with Mr. Kennicott’s collections, having reached that point too
late in the season to come through to St. Paul.

Among the species of birds added in 1859 may be mentioned Phaeton
Havirostris, Puffinus obscurus, Xema sabini, Rosthramus sociabilis, Vireo
altiloquus, Sula personata, Tetrao richardsonit, Lagopus leucurus, and
adult Colymbus arcticus and Podiceps arcticus, in summer dress, with
the numerous novelties from Cape St. Lucas sent by Mr. Xantus.

The series of South American birds has been largely increased in
number of species. Many very rare North American eggs have been
added to the collection. The other specimens received, with the
exception of Mr. Stimpson’s Atlantic coast shells, have served to fill
up slight gaps in speciés or localities, rather than to bring any to a
condition of completeness.

The estimated income for the year 1859, inclusive of the balance
in the hands of the Treasurer, was $54,495 56, and the actual
income $54,467 50; showing a difference of $28 06 less than the
estimate. This difference arises from the fact that in the previous
reports the whole amount of $3,210 interest on Virginia stock was
‘assumed to have been placed to the credit of the Treasurer, although
Riggs & Co. retained $16 06 for commission, &c., at the time of the
purchase.

In addition to the above, the interest for two years on the Wash-
ington corporation stock, amounting to $12, was considered as in the
hands of the treasurer, although it had not actually been drawn.

The estimated expenditure was $38,000. The actual expenditure
$34,833 39; showing a difference of $3,166 61 less than the esti-
mate, due principally to a less expenditure on the building, furniture,
and the publications.

The amount of income above that of the expenditure was $3,492 75,
which, added to the actual balance ($16,141 36) in the hands of the
Treasurer at the beginning of the year 1859, makes $19,634 11. It
is necessary to mention that $5,000 of this belongs to the extra fund,
which has not yet been invested.

The annual appropriation from Congress for keeping the museum
of the exploring expedition has been expended, under the direction
of the Secretary of the Interior, in assisting to pay the extra ex-
penses of assistants and the cost of preserving and arranging the
specimens.

An appropriation has also been continued during the past year by
the Patent Office for the collection of meteorological statistics for the
Agricultural Report.

It is believed the expenditures under these heads have been eco-
nomically and judiciously made, and that the services rendered to
government have been strictly and faithfully performed.

The specimens intrusted to the care of the Institution are now
undergoing a thorough examination, and, being scientifically arranged,
are in a better condition to meet the wants of the naturalist, and to
interest the public, than ever before.

The committee respectfully submit the following estimate of the
expenditures for the year 1860:

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.
OF THE
BOARD OF REGENTS

OF

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

WASHINGTON, January 18, 1860.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution fixing the time of the beginning of their an-
nual sessicn on the third Wednesday of January of each year, the
Board met this day in the Regents’ room of the Institution.

Present : Hon. Jas. A. Pearce, Hon. W. H. English, and the Sec-
retary.

No quorum being present, the Board adjourned to meet on the 28th
of January.
JANUARY 28, 1860.

The Board of Regents met this day, at 103 o’clock a. m., in the
Regents’ room,

Present: Hon. Mr. Breckinridge, Hon. James A. Pearce, Hon. J.
M. Mason, Professor C. C. Felton, Professor A. D. Bache, Hon. J.
G. Berret, W. W. Seaton, esq., Treasurer, and the Secretary.

The Secretary announced the reappointment, by the Vice-Presi-
dent, under a resolution of the Senate, of the Hon. 8. A. Douglas, as
a Regent for the term of six years, and stated that the House of Rep-
resentatives not having organized, the vacancies in the Board from
that body had not been filled. He regretted to state that the Chan-
cellor of the Institution, Chief Justice Taney, was confined to his bed
by temporary illness; that Mr. Hawley, of Albany, was unable to at-
tend on account of bad health, and that since the last meeting of the
Regents a vacancy had occurred in the Board by the death of the
Hon. Richard Rush, of Philadelphia.

Hon. Mr. Pearce then made the following remarks:

Since the last meeting of the Board of Regents, as announced by
the Secretary, one of its earliest and most distinguished members,
the Hon. RicHarp Rusu, has departed this life.

The history of his public career is familiar to all the Regents, to
102 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.

whom I need scarcely detail even its more prominent incidents; but
T may remark that it is seldom the good fortune of any man to fill so
many important offices,* and to execute so many responsible public
trusts, not only with credit, honor, and usefulness, but with ever-in-
creasing reputation. Mr. Rush’s life was along one, and he entered
into the service of his country while yet in the spring of manhood.
He was Comptroller of fhe Treasury at a time when the fiscal affairs
of the government were in disorder, when the public accounts were
numerous and complicated, and often required difficult legal adjust-
ment. He was next Attorney General. Soon after the peace of 1815
he was minister to England, and occupied that important post during
eight years, when various national questions of difficulty and delicacy
required for their proper settlement diplomatic skill, firmness, and
caution. He was Secretary of the Treasury when measures of rev-
enue were violently disputed; minister to France when the mon-
archy was a second time overthrown and a republic again proclaimed.
To these great and varied employments he brought integrity,
ability, intelligence, firmness, courtesy, and a directness of purpose
which scorned all finesse, and which served his country to the full
extent of all that could have been demanded or hoped. He was a
good scholar, having graduated at Princeton College, and cultivated
literature, as wellas the severer studies of his profession, with great
zeal and success.

Withal he was remarkable for the kindness of his temper, the
amenity of his manners, and the charms of his conversation.

With this establishment he had the earliest connexion, having,
under the authority of the government, caused the institution. of legal
proceedings in England for the recovery of the fund with which it
was founded and endowed, and superintended their progress to the close.

The act of Congress of 1846 having established the Smithsonian
Institution, he was appointed one of its first Regents, and was con-
stantly continued by Congress a member of their Board. His zeal
for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men, and_ his
sound judgment, contributed to the adoption of the system of opera-
tions which, so far, has borne the happiest fruits; and his interest in
and care for its successful management furnished one of the enjoyments
of a tranquil old age, ‘‘ attended by reverence and troops of friends.”’

I offer the following resolutions:

fesolved, That the Board of Regents have learned with deep regret
the death of the Hon. Richard Rush, one of their members, whose
long and distinguished career of public usefulness commanded their
entire respect, and whose moral and social worth won their highest
esteem and regard.

Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to the family
of the deceased.

The resolutions were unanimously adopted.

On motion of Mr. Mason, it was ordered that a copy of the remarks
of Mr. Pearce be included in the proceedings, and also transmitted
to the family.

The Treasurer presented the account of receipts and expenditures
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 103

for the year 1859, and a general statement of the finances, which
were read and referred to the Executive Committee.

The Secretary read the following letter from the Duke of North-
umberland, and presented the books to which it refers:

NORTHUMBERLAND Houses, July 4, 1859.

Sir: Permit me to present to the Smithsonian Institution some
books which I have had privately printed as materials for the history
of the county of Northumberland. There is a survey of the Roman
wall which was built across the north of England; coins of the Roman
families, some of which were found in this country; and an account
of some ancient castles which have historical interest.

I again beg to express my thanks to the members of the Smith-
sonian Institution for the valuable publications which they have had
the kindness to send me.

Iam, sir, your obedient servant,

NORTHUMBERLAND.

The Secretary exhibited a burning lens and a condensing air-
pump, which had been presented to the Institution by J. R. Priest-
ley, esq., of Northumberland, Pa., a grandson of the celebrated Dr.
Priestley, and made the following remarks:

This lens is undoubtedly connected with the history of one of the
most important chemical discoveries of the latter part of the last
century. Dr. Priestley, who has been styled the father of pneumatic
chemistry, made a series of experiments on different kinds of air,
which greatly extended the science of chemistry, and has been of
material importance in the improvement of various practical arts.

‘“At the time of my first publication,’ [says Dr. Priestley, ]* ‘‘I
was not possessed of a burning lens of any considerable force, and for
want of one I could not possibly make many of the experiments
which I had projected, and which in theory appeared very promising.
But having afterwards procured a lens of twelve inches diameter and
twenty inches focal distance, I proceeded with great alacrity to ex-
amine by the help of it what kind of air a great variety of substances,
natural and factitious, would yield, putting them into glass vessels,
which I filled with quicksilver, and kept them inverted in a_ basin of
the same. With this apparatus, after a variety of other experi-
ments, on the Ist of August, 1774, I endeavored to extract air from
mercurius calcinatus per se, and I presently found that by means of
this lens air was expelled from it very readily. Having got three or
four timesas much [air] as the bulk of my materials, [admitted water
to it, and found that it was not imbibed by it. But what surprised
me more than I can well express was, that a candle burned in this
air with a remarkably vigorous flame.’’

The gas thus discovered, to which he gave the name of ‘‘ dephlo-
gisticated air,’’ was what is now known as OXYGEN.

* Experiments and observations on different kinds of air, &c., by Jos. Priestly : vol. ii,
pp. 106-112. Birmingham, 1790.
104 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.

Dr. Priestley, however, though he made a large number of experi-
ments in regard to it, remained in ignorance of its true nature until
March, 1775; but in the course of this month, says he, ‘‘I not only
ascertained the nature of this kind of air, though very gradually, but
was led by it, as I then thought, to the complete discovery of the con-
stitution of the air we breathe.”’

That the lens now exhibited to the Board is the one with which
this important discovery was made cannot be doubted, since, accord-
ing to the statement of his grandson, it has never been out of the
family—is twelve inches diameter, and has a focal length of precisely
twenty inches.

The annual report of the operations and condition of the Institu-
tion was presented by the Secretary, and read in part.

On motion of Mr. Pearce, the Board then adjourned to meet on

Saturday next, at 10 o'clock.
SaturpDay, Lebruary 4, 1860.

A meeting of the Board of Regents was held this day, at 100’ clock a.m.

Present: Hon. John C. Breckinridge, Hon. James A. Pearce, Hon.
S. A. Douglas, Professor C. C. Felton, Professor A. D. Bache, Hon.
J. G. Berret, and the Secretary.

Mr. Breckinridge was called to the chair.

The minutes were read and approved.

The Secretary announced the death of the following persons who
had been connected officially and otherwise with the operations of the
Institution: Washington Irving, an honorary member; Professor Par-
ker Cleaveland, also an honorary member; Professor W. W. Turner,
Professor James P. Espy, and G. Wiirdemann, esq.

Professor Felton then addressed the Board as follows:

Mr. CHANCELLOR: The year 1859 will be memorable in the history
of civilization for the number of illustrious men who have passed away
from the scene of their earthly labor in its course. The year 1769
was remarkable for the number of men born in it, who have changed
the whole aspect of science and letters and the political condition of
the world. Of the great men born in that year, one, Humboldt, the

most eminent of all, lived to the year 1859, thus spanning over the
interval between them by a life of 90 years consecrated to the highest
objects of human pursuits.

The Smithsonian Institution has to lament an unusual number of
those connected with it among the distinguished dead of the past
year. The venerable Mr. Rush has already been fitly commemorated
by a member of the Board. I take the liberty of offering a few re-
marks upon two others whose death the country deplores.

Professor W. W. Turner was born in England in 1810. At the age
of five years he was brought by his father to the United States. The
fortunes of his family being humble, he learned the trade of a carpen-
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 105

ter; but at the age of nineteen he became a printer. During his
youth and early manhood he exhibited an ardent love of knowledge,

and devoted every moment he could spare from the necessary labors
of his trade to its acquisition. His taste led him especially to the
study of philology, and his acquisitions in this department of knowl-
edge were surprising. He studied not only the ancient languages,
including the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, Samaritan, Coptic and San-
scrit, but the modern EKuropean and Oriental tongues. To these rich
and varied accomplishments he added an extensive knowledge of the
dialects of the American aborigines, which form a group so peculiar
in their characteristics, and so important in their bearings upon com-
parative philology. But Mr. Turner possessed not merely the talent
of learning languages. His mind was of a philosophical cast; he
mastered easily and rapidly the general principles of the science of
comparative philology, which has become within the present age one
of the surest guides in tracing the history and affinities of the different
branches of the human race. ‘This science but few men of his age
have so thoroughly explored as our departed friend.

In 1842 Mr. Turner was elected professor of Oriental literature in
the Union Theological Seminary of the city of New York. The duties
of this office he dischar ged with signal ability for ten years. In 1852
the Commissioner of Patents invited him to W ashington to take charge
of the library in that department. His labors in forming a library
for the special use of the department and adequate to its wants have
been highly appreciated by those who knew them best.

His literary activity has been various and effective. He assisted
the learned Dr. Nordheimer in the preparation of his Hebrew gram-
mar. He executed the greater part of the translation of Freund’s
Latin Lexicon from the German for the American edition. He wrote

many valuable papers for the ‘‘ Bibliotheca Sacra’’ and other kindred
periodical publications. A few years ago an inscription was found
near the ancient Sidon, cut on the lid of the sarcophagus of an ancient
king of that city, and copies of it having been transmitted to this
country by the American missionaries, it attracted the earnest atten-
tion of Oriental scholars, and among the rest, of Professor Turner.
The discovery was important, because the inscription contains the
longest continuous text yet known in the Phenician language: a lan-
guage closely connected with the Hebrew. The labors of Professor
Turner upon this curious document were among the last of his life.

Two of the principal philological works published by the Smith-
sonian Institution were moulded into their present shape by Professor
Turner: the Dacota grammar and dictionary, and the grammar of

the Yoruba language. The materials furnished him were elaborated

with great skill and learning; and these two admirable volumes form
an inter esting addition to philological science—the Dacota grammar
illustrating in a philosophical manner the characteristic peculiarities
of the American type of the agglutinating or polysynthetic languages,
and the Yoruba grammar illustrating the African type of the same
great division in the classification of human speech.

The unremitting labors of Professor Turner gradually undermined
his constitution. In October last he visited New York, vartly for the
106 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.

benefit of his impaired health, and partly to attend a meeting of the
American Oriental Society, of which he was an active member. On
his return to Washington, in November, he rapidly declined, and on
Tuesday, the 29th of that month, expired, without pain, at the age
of 49 years. bi

Professor Turner was not only distinguished for his abilities as a
scholar, his extraordinary capacity for labor, his great power of grasp-
ing the generalization of the science to which he was devoted, but
his private life was marked by singular purity. His manners were
simple and cordial; his conversation lively and instructive. He was
modest, without reserve; he was unobtrusive, but always ready to 1m-
yart his affluent knowledge whenever the occasion seemed to call for
it. he death of such a man is a loss to science and the country. I
move the adoption of the following resolution:

Resolved, That this Board have learned with deep regret of the
death of Professor W. W. Turner, a scholar of rare gifts and large
acquirements, whose abilities and learning have in many ways been of
great value to the Smithsonian Institution. As a philologist, he had
but few equals; as an earnest laborer in the pursuit of knowledge, he
was a high example to American students. As a public officer, he
was upright, conscientious, and prompt in the discharge of every duty.
His social virtues endeared him to his friends in no common measure.
By his death American scholarship has sustained a heavy loss, this
Institution has been deprived of an efficient collaborator, and the com-
munity at large of a virtuous and distinguished citizen.

On motion of Hon. J. G. Berret, it was

Resolved, That a copy of this resolution, with the introductory
remarks, be transmitted to the family of the deceased.
The resolutions were adopted.

Professor Felton then addressed the Board as follows:

I have also, Mr. Chancellor, to call the attention of the Board to
the death of an honorary member of the Smithsonian Institution—the
beloved and illustrious Washington Irving, the most venerated repre-
sentative of American literature. He was born April 8, 1783, in New
York, and died at his residence, at Sunnyside, on the banks of the
Hudson, November 28, 1859, in the T7th year of hisage. His literary
career extends over a period of more than half a century. For many
years he has stood undoubtedly at the head of American literature.
He enjoyed only the common opportunities of education in his youth;
but the oldest universities of England and America honored themselves
by conferring their highest honors on him in his manhood. At an
early age he commenced the study of the law. His health failing, he
travelled two years in Europe, and resuming his professional studies
on his return, was admitted to the bar. Not finding the practice of
the profession congenial to his tastes, he relinquished it, and became
a partner in a mercantile house with his brother. But he was not
destined to remain long in the career of trade; the failure of the
house in the crisis that followed the peace of 1815 turned his attention
to literature as a permanent pursuit. He had already shown by the
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 107

most decided proofs that nature had endowed him with the richest
gifts of genius. His early writings, especially his contributions to
Salmagundi, and Knickerbocker’s ‘History of New York, exhibit the
keenest power of observation, the most brilliant wit, and an English
style at once pure, copious, and expressive. But when he vesolaad to
devote himself to letters as the business of his life, instead of the
amusement of his leisure hours, he gave to the culture of style the
thought, care, and labor that the painter and the sculptor expend in
acquiring a mastery over the materials, principles, and processes of
their respective arts. In the choice of his words and the structure of
his sentences he exercised a refined taste and a delicate discrimination,
allowing nothing to escape him which was not justified by the most
fastidious judgment. He studied the best authors of the best ages in
English literature, and disciplined his genius by a strict conformity to
the ‘esiabliahed idiom of the mother tong: ue. Oddity and extravagance
of expression, which some writers of our age mistake for originality of
genius, found no favor with him. His genial nature, his sensibility to
all that is beautiful in the works of God, his ready sympathy with the
best affections of the human heart, were thus embodied in a style of
marvellous grace, purity, and harmony. His imagination, gentle yet
powerful, brightened everything it fell upon; his wit exhilarated and
gladdened; his humor charmed by its sparkling play; his pathos, so
true, so tender, colored with the unforgotten sorrow of his own early
bereavement, touched the chords of sympathy in every heart. He
was an elegant essayist, a delightful biographer, a profound and
brilliant historian, and his whole life was loyal to the highest interests
of humanity. In private friendships he was faithful and genereus.
He had all the excellencies of the literary character, with none of its
defects. He had no rivalries to disturb the serenity of his days, no
jealousies to irritate his temper. While enjoying his own brilliant
success, with a modest appreciation of its value, he rejoiced in the
successes of others, and delighted to aid them with his powerful influ-
ence. He never had an enemy, for all men were his friends. He
never uttered a word that could wound the feelings of the most sensi-
tive; he never wrote a sentence that could offend the most delicate;
he never printed a line which, dying, he could wish to blot. His genius
has been recognized throughout the civilized world; his works are read
and his name revered wherever a cultivated language has been the
organ of a national literature. The legends of Spain and Italy have
furnished congenial subjects for his pen. The manners and life of
England have been more brilliantly illustrated by him than by any
English writer of our time. His native land, however, has been
crowned by the richer and mature products of his genius. The
picturesque banks of the Hudson have been made classical by the
charm with which his creations—poetical in all but the form—have
invested them. It is his peculiar felicity to have built the most
enduring monument to the discoverer of America and to the Father
of his Country, with the latter of whom he was associated by his
baptismal name.

Mr. Irving took a lively interest in all that concerned the intellectual
progress of the country; in all that concerned humanity, beyond the
108 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.

circle of his own literary interests. He was the first named trustee
of the Astor Library under the will of its munificent founder, and for
many years acted as the president of the board. He served as a
director in the Savings Bank in the place of his residence until his
death; and he was an officer of the village church, from which his
own lifeless remains were borne to their final resting place by his
mother’s side. He had the prospects of this Institution much at
heart, and gave his constant attendance to its proceedings during a
whole season passed by him in Washington. Ripe in age, crowned
with the most enduring honors of the world and with the warmest
affections of his countrymen, having finished the work which was
given him to do and laid aside his pen forever, after a short period
of repose in the midst of his friends, at the close of an evening of
social and domestic enjoyment, he passed away in a moment by a
blessed euthanasia. We cannot be surprised at such an event, though
it excites our sensibility. His death was in beautiful harmony with
his life, for he died as he had lived, the beloved of men and the
favored of Heaven.

Thinking thus, Mr. Chancellor, of Mr. Irving’s life, character, and
death, I offer the following resolutions:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
recognize in the character of their late associate, Washington Irving,
a conspicuous example of the noblest virtues and the most generous
qualities that belong to human nature.

Resolved, That while lamenting his death with the peculiar sorrow
of countrymen and associates in this Institution, yet, in common with
the whole civilized world, they gratefully appreciate the services he
has rendered to literature, and hold in reverent remembrance his long
career of labors as an author no less loyal to truth and virtue than
brilliant with the gift of genius and graced with the amenities.and
courtesies that are the fairest ornaments of social life.

On motion of Senator Douglas, it was

Resolved, That a copy of the above resolutions, together with the
remarks that preceded them, be transmitted to the family of the
deceased. :

The resolutions were then adopted.

Professor Bache made the following remarks:

James P. Espy, one of the most original and successful meteor-
ologists of the present time, died in Cincinnati, Ohio, on the 24th of
January, 1860, in the seventy-fifth year of his age, after an illness of
a week, at the residence of his nephew, John Westcott.

The early career of Mr. Espy as an instructor was marked by the
qualities which led to his later distinction in science. He was one
of the best classical and mathematical instructors in Philadelphia,
which at that day numbered Dr. Wylie, Mr. Sanderson, and Mr.
Crawford among its teachers.

Impressed by the researches and writings of Dalton and of Daniell
on meteorology, Mr. Espy began to observe the phenomena, and then
to experiment on the facts which form the groundwork of the science.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 109

As he observed, experimented, and studied, his enthusiasm grew, and
his desire to devote himself exclusively to the increase and diffusion
of the science finally became so strong that he determined to give up
his school, and to rely for the means of prosecuting his researches
‘upon his slender savings and the success of his lectures, probably the
most original which have ever been delivered on this subject. His
first course was delivered before the Franklin Institute of Penn-
sylvania, of which he had long been an active member, and where he
met kindred spirits, ready to discuss the principles or the applica-
tions of science, and prepared to extend their views over the whole
horizon of physical and mechanical research. As chairman of the
committee on meteorology, Mr. Espy had a large share in the organi-
zation of the complete system of meteorological observations carried
on by the institute under the auspices and within the limits of the
State of Pennsylvania.

Mr. Exspy’s theory of storms was developed in successive memoirs
in the Journal of the Franklin Institute, containing discussions of the
changes of temperature, pressure, and moisture of the air, and in the
direction and force of the wind and other phenomena attending re-
markable storms in the United States and on the ocean adjacent to
the Atlantic and Gulf coast. Assuming great simplicity as it was
developed, and founded on the established laws of physics and upon
ingenious and well-directed original experiments, this theory drew
general attention to itself, especially in the United States. A me-
moir submitted anonymously to the American Philosophical Society
of Philadelphia gained for Mr. Espy the award of the Magellanic
premium in the year 1836, after a discussion remarkable for ingenuity
and closeness inits progress, and for the almost unanimity of its result.

Mr. Espy was eminently social in his mental habits, full of bonhom-
mie. and of enthusiasm, easily kindling into a glow by social mental
action. In the meetings and free discussions in a club formed for
promoting research, and especially for scrutinizing the labors of its
members—and of which Sears C. Walker, Professor Henry, Henry
D. Rogers, and myself were members—Mr. KEspy found the mental
stimulus that he needed, and thegriticism which he courted, the best
aids and checks on his observations, speculations, and experiments.
But there was one person who had more influence upon him than all
others besides, stimulating him to progress, and urging him forward
in each step with a zeal which never flagged—this was his wife.
Having no children to occupy her care, and being of high mental en-
dowment and of enthusiastic temperament, she found a never-failing
source of interest and gratification in watching the development of
Mr. Espy’s scientific ideasy the progress of his experiments, and the
results of his reading and studies; the collection and collation of ob-
servations of natural phenomena in the poetical region of the storm,
the tornado, and of the aurora. Mrs. Espy’s mind was essentially
literary, and she could not aid her husband in his scientific inquiries
or experiments: her health was delicate, and she could not assist him
in his out-door observations; but she supplied what was of more im-
portance than these aids—a genial and loving interest ever manifested
in his pursuits and successes, and in his very failures. Alere flam-

mam was the office of her delicate and poetical temperament.
Younger than Mr. Espy, she nevertheless died several years before
him, (in 1850,) leaving him to struggle alone in the decline of life
without the sustaining power of her devoted and enthusiastic nature.

Having ina great degree matured his theory of storms; having
made numerous inductions from observations, and having written
a great deal in regard to it, Mr. Espy took the bold resolution, though
past middle age, to throw himself into a new career, laying aside
all ordinary employments, and devoting himself to the diffusion of the
knowledge which he had collected and increased, by lecturing in the
towns, villages, and cities of the United States. This proved a suc-
cessful undertaking, and by its originality attracted more attention
to his views than could have been obtained, probably, in any other
way. He soon showed remarkable power in explaining his ideas.
His simplicity and clearness enabled his hearers to follow him without
too great effort, and the earnestness with which he spoke out his con-
victions carried them away in favor of his theory. The same power
which enabled him to succeed in his lecturing career procured sub-
sequently for Mr. Espy the support and encouragement of some of the
leading men in Congress, and especially in the Senate, and also in
the executive departments. Their attention was arrested by the
originality of his views and his warmth in presenting them, and he
imparted so much of his conviction of their truth as to induce many
of our statesmen and official persons to exert themselves to procure
for him, under the patronage of the government, continued oppor-
tunities for study, research, and the comparison of observations. To
the consistent support of his scientific friends, and particularly of the
Secretary of this Institution, Mr. Espy owed also much in obtaining
the opportunities of keeping in a scientific career. His reports to
the surgeon general of the army, to Congress, and to the Secretary
of the Navy, are among his latest efforts in this direction.

The earnest and deep convictions of the truth of his theory in all
its parts, and his glowing enthusiasm in regard to it; perhaps, also,
the age which he had reached, prevented Mr. Espy from passing
beyond a certain point in the develgpment of his theory. The same
constitution of mind rendered his inductions from observation often
unsafe. His views were positive and his conclusions absolute, and
so was the expression of them. He was not prone to examine and
re-examine premises and conclusions, but considered what had once
been passed upon by his judgment as finally settled. Hence his
views did not make that impression upon cooler temperaments among
men of science to which they were entitled—obtaining more credit
among scholars and men of general reading,in our country than among
scientific men, and making but little progress abroad.

Feeling that his bodily vigor was failing, and that his life must soon
close, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution induced him to
re-examine the various parts of his meteorological theories of storms,
tornadoes, and water-spouts, and to insert in his last report, while it
was going through the press, an account of his most mature views.
I trust that the Secretary will, in one of his reports, give usa thorough
and critical examination of the works and services of this remarkable

contributor to a branch of science, the knowledge of which the Smith-
sonian Institution has already done so much to advance and to diffuse.

On motion of Professor Bache, the following resolutions were adop-
ted:

Resolved, That the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution have
learned with deep regret the decease of James P. Espy, one of the
most useful and zealous of the meteorologists co-operating with the
Institution, and whose labors in both the increase and diffusion of
knowledge of meteorology have merited the highest honors of science
at home and have added to the reputation of our country abroad.

Resolved, That the Regents offer to the relatives of Mr. Espy their
sincere condolence in the loss which they have sustained.

On motion of Mr. Pearce, it was resolved that the remarks of Pro-
fessor Bache be entered in the proceedings.

The Secretary introduced the subject of warming the Smithsonian .
building, stating that it was important to provide better means for
this purpose, to insure the safety of those parts of the building which are
not fire-proof. The subject was referred to the Executive Committee,
and the Secretary was instructed to procure estimates for the intro-
duction of steam or hot-water apparatus.

The reading of the report of the Secretary was continued.

The Board then adjourned.

SatuRDAY, March 17, 1860.

The Board of Regents met this day, at 10 o'clock a. m.

Present: Hon. John C. Breckinridge, Hon. James M. Mason, Hon.
James A. Pearce, Hon. 8. A. Douglas, Hon. William H. English, Hon.
Benjamin Stanton, Hon. J. G. Berret, Prof. A. D. Bache, Mr. Seaton,
Treasurer, and the Secretary.

Mr. Breckinridge was called to the chair.

The minutes were read and approved.

The Secretary announced the reappointment, by the Speaker of the
House of Representatives, of Hon. William H. English, of Indiana;
Hon. Benjamin Stanton, of Ohio; and Hon. L. J. Gartrell, of Georgia,
as Regents for the term of two years.

The Secretary presented the following letter from Kdward Cunard,
Esq. :

New York, February 25, 1860.

Dear Sir: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the
16th instant, and, in reply, I beg to inform you that I shall have much
pleasure in conveying in our steamers fr om New York to Liverpool

The Secretary presented the following letter from Sir W. E,
Logan:
MontreEAL, March, 1860.

My Dear Sir: Understanding that the shells of the United States
exploring expedition are being arranged, and that there are many
duplicates, I should be rejoiced if a set of them could be obtained for
our Provincial Museum. It may be the case that what we may be
able to return for them may not equal their value; but the Canadian
territory is a large one, and we shall have duplicates of our fossils
from various parts, extending from Labrador to Lake Superior.

In our geological expeditions to the eastern part of the province,
advantage has been taken of the opportunity to dredge in the Gulf
of St. Lawrence, and we shall undoubtedly have duplicates of many
of the specimens obtained. This season I hope to send an exploring
party to the Straits of Belle Isle.

We are so much pressed with work at present that it may be a
little time before our duplicates are ready, particularly as the pro-
tracted want of Professor Hali’s third volume of the paleontology of
New York disables us from naming many of our fossils according to
his authority, while a regard for him prevents us from naming them
for ourselves: Our Lower Silurian fossils will be the first that will
be ready.

I am, my dear sir, very truly yours,
W. KE. LOGAN:

Professor HENRY,

Smithsonian Institution, Washington.

A letter was read from Hon. Alfred Ely, chairman of the Com-
mittee of Claims of the House of Representatives, relative to an
application of an officer of the navy for remuneration for specimens
of natural history, &., collected by the United States exploring ex-
pedition.

The subject was discussed, and referred to the Secretary and the
Executive Committee.

A letter was read from Sir George Simpson, governor of the Hud-
son’s Bay Territory, offering to aid the Institution in collecting me-
teorological and other information.

A letter was read from C. Zimmerman, of Columbia, South Caro-
lina, on the subject of the preparation by the Institution of manuals
on entomology.

The Secretary stated that a proposition had been made by Lieu-
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 113

tenant Gilliss relative to an expedition to the coast of Labrador to
observe the total eclipse of July 18, if the necessary means could be
secured to defray the expenses, towards which, if the Institution
would subscribe $500, the balance, it was believed, could be secured
from individuals.

Professor Bache addressed the Board, commending highly the pro-
posed expedition, and stating the advantages which would result to
science if the observations could be made.

On motion of Professor Bache, it was

Resolved, That an appropriation be made, not exceeding $500, to aid
in the proposed expedition to observe the eclipse of July 18, 1860,

The Secretary called the attention of the Board to another expe-
dition, proposed by Dr. I. I. Hayes to the Arctic regions, and sug-
gested the propriety of aid in furnishing that gentleman with the
requisite instruments of observation.

On motion of Mr. Pearce, it was

Resolved, That the Secretary of the Institution be authorized to
furnish such aid to the expedition of Dr. Hayes, in the way of instru-
ments, as may be deemed advisable.

The Secretary introduced the subject of the Stanley gallery of In-
dian paintings, and stated that Mr. Stanley asked for an allowance of
one hundred dollars a year to pay the interest on a debt he had in-
curred to prevent the sacrifice of the paintings by sale.

The subject was referred to the Secretary and the Executive Com-
mittee. i

A letter from Professor Secchi, of Rome, was read, stating that he
had obtained permission for the Institution to procure casts or moulds
of celebrated works of art in that city.

The Secretary stated that Mr. Corcoran, of Washington, was about
to found a gallery of art, and it was very desirable that the Institu-
tion should co-operate with him, especially in relation to copies of
works of art from Italy.

The subject was referred to the Secretary and the Executive Com-
mittee.

The Secretary presented the continuation of his annual report;
which was read.

The opinion was expressed by several of the Regents that a less
number of lectures should be given than heretofore, twelve being
considered sufficient for each season.

The Board then adjourned.

SaturDAy, April 1, 1860.
The Board of Regents met this day at 10 o’clock a.m. Present:
Hon. James A. Pearce, Hon. 8. A, Douglas, Hon. W. H. English
Hon. Benjamin Stanton, Hon. George E. Badger, Professor Bache,

and the Secretary.
Mr. Pearce was called to the chair.

The minutes were read and approved.
Mr. Pearce presented the Report of the Executive, Committee

which was accepted, and the estimates for the year 1860 adopted.
On motion of Mr. Douglas, it was

Resolved, That the Executive Committee invest the five thousand
dollars now in the hands of the Treasurer, belonging to the extra

fund.
The Secretary laid before the Board the eleventh volume of Smith-

sonian Contributions to Knowledge, which had just been issued.

The Secretary brought before the Board the subject of the pay of
the assistants; which, after some remarks, was referred to the Secre-
tary and the Executive Committee.

Professor Bache made the following remarks:

Mr. Gustavus Wurdemann, in charge of the tidal observations of
the Coast Survey on the Florida reefs and Gulf of Mexico, died at
his home in New Jersey on the 30th of September. His health had
been failing for some years, and during the last year he had discharged
his duties with ereat difficulty, owing to great physical debility. Mr.
Wurdemann entered the survey under my predecessor, and served,
throughout a somewhat extended career with a fidelity and single-
ness of purpose that has never been exceeded. Exact truthfulness
was the leading trait of his character, and his observations, even
the most minute, were always reliable. It is easily seen that it
is no exaggeration to say that such a man was invaluable in his
place, and an example worthy to be held up as the type of faith-
fulness. During the discharge of his laborious duties he found time
and opportunity to make collections in natural history, which have
been acknowledged by the Smithsonian Institution as among the
most valuable contributions to the knowledge of the fauna of Florida.

On motion of Professor Bache, the following resolution was unani-
mously adopted:

Resolved, That the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution have
learned with regret the decease of Gustavus Wurdeman, tidal ob-
server in the Coast Survey, whose collections of specimens from the
coast of the Gulf of Mexico, and especially of the birds of Florida,
liberally furnished to the Smithsonian Institution, have proved of
great importance in increasing our knowledge of the natural history
of the southern part of the United States.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 115

Resolved, That this resolution be communicated to the widow of Mr.
Wurdemann.

The Secretary read the following authentic notice, which had ap-
peared in a recent periodical, respecting the late Professor Cleave-

land :

‘Professor Parker Cleaveland died on the 15th of October, 1858.
He was born in Rowley (Byfield parish)Massachusetts, January 15,
1780, graduated at Harvard College in 1799, taught school and studied
law until 1803, when he was appointed tutor in mathematics in Har-
vard College. He was made professor of mathematics and natural
philosophy, chemistry and mineralogy in Bowdoin College in 1805,
and discharged with distinguished ability the extended duties of that
professorship until 1828, when a professor of mathematics was ap-
pointed, and he was relieved from that part of hislabor. He contin-
ued to be the professor in the other departments until hisdeath. He
became widely known in the United States, and in Europe, by his
early and successful treatise on mineralogy and geology, published in
1816, and in a second edition in 1822. A third was called for, and
he labored in its preparation more or less for thirty-five years, leav-
ing it nearly ready for the press. His high reputation as a lecturer
was spread through the country by a succession of graduates of Bow-
doin College of more than fifty years. He was a member of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and of many literary and
scientific societies in this country and in Europe. In 1824, the hon-
orary degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on him by Bowdoin
College. In private life he was universally respected for his unblem-
ished moral character, and his genial and affable disposition. His
death called forth unusual and remarkable demonstrations of respect.
to his character and memory. In June, 1853, he was elected an
honorary member of the Smithsonian Institution.’

On motion of Mr. Douglas, the following resolutions were adopted:

Resolved, That the Regents of this Institution have learned with
deep regret of the decease of Professor Parker Cleveland, of Bow-
doin College, one of the honorary members of this establishment,
who was highly esteemed on account of his labors as a man of
science and a teacher, and whose memory will be held in grateful
remembrance.

Resolved, That the Regents offer to the family of the deceased
their sincere condolence at the loss which they and the country have
sustained.

The Secretary presented the following letter from Mr. Ross, chief
factor of the Hudson’s Bay Company:

Fort SIMpPson,
McKenzies river, 30th November, 1859.

Dear Str: At the period of the departure of our usual winter ex-
press I sit down to write you a few lines upon the subjects mentioned
116 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.

in your communicatiofi of the 2d of April, 1859. I trust that the
various cases sent you last summer from Portage La Loche reached
you in safety, and that the contents proved satisfactory and of in
terest. It will be my endeavor during the present and succeeding
seasons to collect the animals mentioned as being wished for by the
Smithsonian Institution, but I will not merely restrict myself to
these particular objects of research, the whole field of either science
or curiosity will be considered in all contributions which I may here-
after forward to your collection.

The Meteorological Register for the months of September, October,
and November, will be forwarded by this conveyance, and I will en-
deavor to organize a systematic series of observations at all the posts
throughout this district. -These of course will vary as to complete-
ness and accuracy according to the tastes and acquirements of the
officer who conducts the registry, as there are very wide differences
in the education and talents of the various persons in the progressive
grades of our service. A series of spirit thermometers of assured
correctness would be useful, in fact are absolutely necessary for this
purpose.

As my attention will hereafter be particularly directed to ethno-
logical pursuits; and my public duties in conducting the affairs of this
large district are not very light, it will be impossible to keep the
regular series of meteorological observations here myself, but I will
delegate this duty to Mr. Andrew Flett, a very careful and intelligent
person, though not of a finished eduction; but any extraordinary
phenomena I will note myself in addition.

By the usual summer boats a packet will be forwarded to your ad-
dress, containing such observations as I can collect in our journals,
and a complete Auroral and Weather Register taken by myself for
Colonel Lefroy in 1850 ~ 51, if I can find the latter.

In conclusion I will merely say that all that lies in my power will
be done to oblige you in any way. Every facility will be given to Mr.
R. Kennicott to collect and forward specimens of natural history;
free passage will be allowed him from post to post throughout the
district, and to all his plans the various officers under my command
will, [am sure, gladly render assistance.

I have the honor to remain, dear sir, yours faithfully,

BERNARD R. ROSS.

The reading of the report of the Secretary was then continued.

On motion of Mr. Badger, the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the thanks of the Board of Regents are hereby
given to the various companies and individuals who have generously
aided in advancing the objects of the Smithsonian Institution and the
promotion of science, by the facilities they have afforded in the trans-
portation of books, specimens, &c., free of charge.

The Board then adjourned to meet at the call of the Secretary.

LECTURES
ON AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY.

BY PROFESSOR SAMUEL W. JOHNSON, OF YALE COLLEGE, CONNECTICUT.

LECTURE I.
- THE COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF THE PLANT.

The objects of agriculture are the production of certain plants and
certain animals which are employed to feed and clothe the human
race. The first object in all cases is the production of plants.

Nature has made the most extensive provision for the spontaneous
growth of an immense variety of vegetation; but, except in rare cases,
man is obliged to employ art to provide himself with the kinds and
quantities of vegetable produce which: his necessities or luxuries
demand. In this defect, or rather neglect of nature, agriculture has
its origin.

The art of agriculture consists in certain practices and operations
which have grown out of an observation and imitation of the best
efforts of nature, or have been hit upon accidentally.

We distinguish here between agri-cultwre, or the culture (improve-
ment) of the field, and farming, which may be anything but the imita-
tion of nature, which often is the grossest violation of her plain
precepts.

The science of agriculture is the rational theory and exposition of
the successful art.

Nothing is more evident than that agricultural art impedes its own
growth by holding aloof from science. In many respects the Egyptians,
the Romans, and the Chinese, had, centuries ago, as perfect an agri-
cultural practice as we now possess; but this fact so demonstrates the
extreme slowness with which an empirical art progresses, that incal-
culable advantage must be anticipated from yoking it with the rapidly-
developing sciences. In fact, the history of the last fifty years has
proved the benefits of this union; and no farmer who by the help of
science has mastered but one of the old difficulties of his art that for
all time have been tormenting the thoughtful with doubt and misleading
every one into a wasteful expenditur e of labor or material would willingly
return to the days of pure empiricism. On the other hand, those who at-
tempt to unfold the laws of production from considerations founded mere-
ly in the pure sciences, without regard to, or knowledge of, the truths
of practice, are sure to go astray and bring discredit on their efforts.

Agriculture, 7. e. field culture, not husbandry or farm management
in the widest sense, is a natural science, and is based principally upon
physics, chemistry, and physiology.

By physics (natural philosophy) is meant the science of matter con-
sidered in relation to those forces which act among masses, or among
120 LECTURES ON

particles, (atoms,) in such a manner as not to alter their essential
characters.

The forces of cohesion, gravitation, heat, light, electricity, and
magnetism, are physical forces. A thousand fragments of iron, for
example, may be made to cohere together or gravitate to the earth, may
be changed in temperature, illuminated, electrified or magnetized, with-
out any permanent change in that assemblage of properties which
constitutes this metal.

Chemistry is the science of chemical force or affinity, which causes
two or more bodies to unite with the production of a compound pos-
sessing essentially new characters. Thus a hard lump of quicklime
when brought in contact with water greedily absorbs it, with the pro-
duction of great heat, and falls to powder. In slacking, it has combined
chemically with water.

Physiology is the science of the processes of life, which require, in
addition to the chemical and most of the physical forces, the co-opera-
tion and superintendence of the vital principle.

The first inquiries in the natural science of agriculture are: What
is the plant? Out of what materials, and under what conditions is it
formed ?

The plant is the result of an organism, the germ, which under
certain influences begins an independent life, and grows by con-
structively adding to itself or assimilating surrounding matter.

The simplest plant is a single cell, a microscopic vesicle of globular
shape, which, after expanding to a certain size, usually produces
another similar cell division either by lateral growth or by its own.

In the chemist’s laboratory it is constantly happening that, in the
clearest solutions of salts, like the sulphates of soda and magnesia,
a flocculent mould, sometimes red, sometimes green, most often
white, is formed, which, under the microscope, is seen to be a vege-
tation consisting of single cells. The yeast plant (fig. 1) is nothing more

than a collection of such cells now
existing singly, now connected in
one line or variously branched.

The cell is the type of all vege-
tation. The most complex plant, a
stalk of cane or an oak, is nothing
nore than anaggregation of myriads
of such cells, very variously modi-
fied indeed in shape and function,
but still all referable to this simple typical form.

In the same manner that the yeast plant enlarges by budding or
splitting into new cells, so do all other plants increase in mass; and
thus growth is simply the formation of new cells.

So far as the studies of the vegetable physiologist enable us to
judge, all vegetable cells consist, at least in the early stages of their
existence, of an external, thin, but continuous (imperforate) membrane,
the cell-wall, consisting of a substance called cellulose, and an interior
lining membrane of slimy or half liquid character, variously called
the protoplasm, the formative layer, or the primodial utricle, (fig. 2.)

6 6,

“408

AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. BLA

At one or several places, the formative
layer is thickened to the so-called nucleus,
(a fig. 2) the point from which growth
and transformations proceed. Within
the cell thus constructed exists a liquid, Ip
the cell-contents, from which, in course -—6//
of time, solid cell contents of various a
character are found to develope. =

In a chemical sense, not less than in a atiichter the single globu-
lar cell is the type of ‘all vegetation.

The outer wall of the cell is formed of that material which is
itself the most abundant product of vegetable life, and which rep-
resents an important group of bodies, that are familiar to all, as large
ingredients of our daily food.

The table which here follows gives the names and the chemical
» formule of what we may term the CELLULOSE GROUP or the VEGETAL
CARBO-HYDRATES.

Cellulose is the body already alluded to as constituting the material of
the outer coating of the cells. It often accumulates in some parts of
the plant by the thickening of the cell Pie ae:
walls, thus forming the greater share
of the wood (fig. - 4) of trees and shrubs. ®y
Linen,hemp,(B fig.3) and cotton (A fig.
3)are nearly or quite pure cellulose. It
exists largely in the stones or shells of
fruits andnuts. The so-called vege-
table ivory is chiefly a very compact
form of cellulose. In general, this
proximate organic element is the
frame-work of the plant, and the
material that gives. toughness and
solidity to its parts.

Cellulose is characterized by its
great indifference to most ordinary
solvents. Water, alcohol, &c., do
not dissolve it, and the stronger rea-
gents of the chemist rarely take it
up without occasioning essential
changes in its constitution.* | With
strong nitric acid it yields nitro-cel- 4 ~

*According to Pelouze, cellulose is dissolved by strong hydrochloric acid, and separates
again in part (part is converted into sugar) on dilution. Schweitzer has recently made the
122 LECTURES ON

lulose or gun cotton. By the continued action of oxydizing agents
itiis converted into that series of brown bodies known under the
3 name of Humus, or finally into
oxalic and carbonic acid.

Next to cellulose, starch (fig. 5)
is the most abundant vegetable
body. It usually occurs as micro-
scopic grains, which for many spe-

“0 99 cies of plants possess a character-
ii/ ; ' rc 5
v ¢ ~ istic form and size, being some-

timesangular asin maize,but most
often oval or spherical as in the
other grains, the potato, &c.

Starch is insoluble in and un-
affected by cold water; in hot
water it swells up and forms a
translucent jelly, and in this
state is employed for stiffening
linen.

Starch is always enclosed in the cells of the plant as seen in the ac-
EIEN companying figure 6, and is exceedingly
abundant, existing not only in the grains
and esculent roots, but also in the trunks
of trees, especially the sago-palm, and
throughout nearly the whole tissue of the

~ higher orders of plants.

Inulin closely resembles starch in
many points, appearing to replace. that
body in the roots of the artichoke, elecam-
pane, dahlia, dandelion, and other com-
posite plants. It occurs in the form of small

\ round transparent grains, which dissolve
\ easily in boiling water, and mostly sepa-
rate again as the water cools. Unlike
starch, inulin exists in a liquid form in
the roots above named, and separates in grains from the clear
pressed juice when this is kept some time. The juice of the dahlia
tuber becomes a semi-solid white mass in this way, after reposing 12
hours from the separation of 8 per cent. of this interesting substance,
(Bouchardat. )

Dextria is a colorless transparent body, soluble in water, and
it appears universally distributed in the juices of plants, though
existing in but small amount compared with the previously de-
scribed proximate principles. The solution of an impure and arti-
ficially prepared dextrin, called British gum, is largely employed in
calico printing, as a substitute for the more expensive natural gums,
and closely resembles them in its adhesive properties. It is an im-

portant ingredient of bread, being formed in the loaf by the process
of baking, from the transformation of starch.

Gum is a generic term, and includes a number of substances, as
gum tragacanth, gum Arabic, gum Senegal, cherry gum, &c,, which,
though unlike in some respects, agree in composition, and have the
property either of dissolving or swelling up in water with the forma-
tion of an adhesive mucilage or paste. In the bread grains there is
usually found a small quantity of gum soluble in water, and in meal
from the seed of millet it has been observed to the amount of 10
per cent.

The sugars are so familiar that they scarcely require special notice.

Cane sugar or sucrose is the intensely sweet soluble crystallizable
principle found in the juice of the cane, maple, and sugar beet. It
is found, besides, in many other plants.

Fruit sugar or fructose is uncrystallizable, and exists in the juice
of acid fruits, in honey and in the bread grains.

Grape sugar or glucose is found solid and crystallized in dried fruits,
especially in the grape. It gradually separates from honey as the
latter candies.

In the young cell this group of bodies is represented by cellulose,
as the cell wall, and by dextrin and the sugars existing in its fluid
contents.

The machinery of the vegetable organism, which all the while
operates as perfectly in the single cell as in the complex mass of cells,
has the power to transform most if not all these bodies into every
other one, and we find them all in every individual of the higher
orders of plants—at least in some stage of its growth. From dex-
trin, which is dissolved in the juice of a parent cell, is moulded the
cellulose which envelopes a new cell.

From starch, and perhaps cellulose in the stem of the maple, cane
sugar is formed in the changeful temperature of spring, and, as the
buds swell, this sugar is reorganized again into cellulose and starch.

The analysis of the cereal grains oftentimes reveals the presence
of dextrin, but no sugar or gum; while at other times the latter are
found, but not the former.

It is easy to imitate many of these transformations outside of the
vegetable organism. By the agency of heat, acids, and ferments,
either singly or jointly, we may effect a number of remarkable
changes.

Cellulose and starch are converted, first, into dextrin, and finally
into grape sugar, by boiling with a dilute acid. In this way glucose
is largely manufactured from potato starch, and has, in fact, been
made from saw-dust. This transformation is also effected by the
digestive apparatus of herbivorous animals, and in case of starch by
a roasting or baking heat. So, too, in the sprouting of seed, the same
changes occur, as exemplified in the preparation of malt.

By heat and acids inulin is also converted into a kind of sugar, but
without the intermediate formation of dextrin. The same is true of
the gums. By these agencies cane sugar is converted into fruit
sugar, and this spontaneously passes into grape sugar.

124 LECTURES ON

Grape sugar is thus seen to be the final product of the transfor-
mation of the carbo-hydrates, either in the vessels of the chemist or
in the digestive process of animals. It is the form in which the
carbo-hydrates of the food pass into the blood, and, in consequence,
it is a constant ingredient of the latter.

It will be noticed that while physical and chemical agencies pro-
duce these metamorphoses in one direction, it is only with the assist-
ance of the vital principle that they can be accomplished in the
reverse manner.

In the laboratory we can only reduce from a higher, organized, or
more complex constitution, to a lower and simpler one. In the vege-
table cell, however, all these changes, and many more, take place
with the greatest facility.

The ready convertibility of one member of this group into another
is to some extent explained by the identical or similar composition of
these bodies. It will be observed by reference to the table that they
are all composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

That they contain carbon is made evident by their yielding charcoal
when heated with imperfect access of air. When heated they also
yield water, which, as all know, is a compound of oxygen and hydro-
gen.

Furthermore, several of these bodies contain the same proportions of
these elements. The formule of cellulose, starch, inulin, and dextrin
are identical. The remaining compounds only differ by the elements
of one or several atoms of water.

The term carbo-hydrates (very convenient for our present purpose,
though to the chemist absurd) was applied here because we may in
a certain sense consider all these substances as hydrates of carbon.
They are, in fact, composed of carbon and the elements of water.

These bodies in their transformations have merely to undergo a
rearrangement of atoms, just as the rearrangement of a few blocks
enables the child to build a variety of toy-houses; or at most they
need only lose or assume a few atoms of water—an omnipresent body,
characterized by the facility with which it enters into all manner of
combinations—and the work is accomplished.

To furnish a more complete illustration of the typifying of all vege-
tation by the single cell, and at the same time to extend our inquiry
into the composition of the plant, we may now advert to the lining
membrane of the cell-wall, or, as physiologists term it, the pro-
toplasm, formative-layer, or primordial utricle. This. consists
chiefly of some body that differs in chemical composition from the
group just described by containing, in addition to the three elements
that form the carbo-hydrates, about 16 per cent. of a fourth element,
nitrogen, and small quantities of sulphur, and perhaps sometimes
phosphorus.

The following table gives the names and percentage composition of
the most important.

These bodies differ considerably in certain characters, though
their similarity in others is very strongly marked. In composition
they are almost identical. From the difficulty of obtaining them in
the pure state their precise composition is not definitely known. The
figures in the table represent the mean results of the best analyses.

The names albumin and casein originated from animal substances,
and in fact we find in the animal kingdom a series of bodies corres-
ponding almost perfectly with the vegetable nitrogenous principles.

In the white of the egg, in the serum of blood, and in many diseased
animal secretions, we meet with albumin which has the property of
passing from its usual fluid condition into the solid form on the appli-
cation of heat. It is said to coagulate.

In the vegetable, albumin exists in much smaller relative quantity
than in the animal; but it may be found in the juice of nearly all
plants. If potatoes, turnips, or flour be digested for some time in
water and the liquid then allowed to clear by settling, it contains a
minute quantity of albumin in solution, as may be made evident by
heating it, when a coagulum of this body separates.

Casein 18 an ingredient of the milk of animals. Heat does not
coagulate it, but acids have this effect. Cheese has casein for its
characteristic constituent.

In the seeds of leguminous plants, as the peaand bean; in the pea-
nut and almond, this body exists very abundantly.

If crushed peas are soaked some hours in warm water, to which a
little ammonia is added, they yield casein to the liquid, and on the
addition of an acid it is separated as a curdy matter like the casein
of milk. In Chinaa kind of cheese is thus largely manufactured. In
smaller quantity casein is found in all the grains and seeds used as
food.

Gluten exists in wheat, and may be obtained by slowly washing a
dough made from wheat flour, whereby the star ch is removed and a
glutinous mass remains which is the substance in question. As thus
seen, it is mingled with more or less albumin and casein, as well as
oil and starch. Gluten is the characteristic ingredient of those grains
from the flour of which a light raised bread may be made. Liebig
has given to gluten the name vegetable fibrin, from its analogies with
the fibre of flesh or animal fibrin.

The albuminoids, like the carbo-hydrates, are easily susceptible
of mutuak transformation. In the animal the casein of milk or beans,
the albumin of eggs or of vegetables, and gluten, are converted first
into albumin and ‘liquid fibrin in the shape of blood, and afterward
into the solid flesh. So, too, in the plant, similar changes, without
doubt, occur.

To some extent these conversions may take place outside the or-
ganism. If, for example, animal fibrin be exposed with water to the
126 ° LECTURES ON

air for some days in a warm place, it disappears or dissolves; if now
Fig. 7. the liquid be heated to near boiling, a

coagulum separates, having all the char-
acters of albumin. After removing the
albumin, the addition of an acid causes
another coagulation, separating a body
that agrees in its properties with casein.
As has been already stated, the albu-
minoid bodies form the hning membrane
of the young cell and are diffused in the
dissolved state throughout its liquid con-
tents. In those parts of the plant where
these bodies accumulate, they are found
nearly filling entire cells and series of cells.

tinguished from starch by the eye,
(A, fig. 8) often, however, in per-
fect polyhedral crystals. (Fig. 8,
_ Band C.) This alewron, as Hartig
|) \\y terms it, is not a pure albuminoid;

YY as according to an analysis made
from material prepared by him,
it contains but 9.46 per cent. of
nitrogen. The aleuron grains dur-
ing the hfe of the plant suffer
metamorphosis into starch and
other organized matters, of course
undergoing radical chemical chan-
ges at the same time. .

While the two great classes of organic proximate elements, just
considered, make up the larger share of vegetation, and suflice to
show in the most beautiful manner how the single cell represents
the whole plant, both structurally and chemically, we should stop
short of the object of these lectures did we not consider some other
vegetal principles of great importance both to the vegetable and ani-
mal economy, which agree with the cellulose group in consisting only
of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but differ again from the carbo-hy-
drates in the fact that their hydrogen and oxygen are not in the pro-
portions to form water.

We may notice these substances under three divisions, viz:

Pectose and its derivatives.

The vegetal acids.

The oils and fats.

The pectose group includes pectose, pectin, pectosic, and pectic
acids. These bodies exist principally in fleshy fruits and berries,
and in the roots of the turnip, beet, and carrot. They are an important
part of the food of men and domestic animals. :

Pectose is the designation of a body which occurs with cellulose in

AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY, . 127

the flesh of unripe fruits, and of the roots just mentioned. Its prop-
erties in the pure state are quite unknown, since we have no method
of separating it from the associated cellulose. Nearly the entire mass
of green fruits and of these roots consists of pectose, which is rec-
ognized to be a special organic body by the products which it yields
when submitted, either naturally or artificially, to the action of vari-
ous chemical or physical agents.

Pectin is prepared from pectose in a way analogous to that by which
cellulose or starch yields dextrin, viz: by the action of heat, acids, and
ferments. When the fruits or roots that contain pectose are subjected
to the action of gentle heat and an acid, the cellulose they contain is
more or less changed into dextrin and sugar, and at the same time tho
firm pectose begins to soften, and in a little time becomes soluble in
water, being converted into pectin. In the baking or roasting of apples
and pears, and in the boiling of turnips and beets, it is precisely this
transformation that occtrs. When fruit ripens, either on the tree or,
as happens with winter apples and pears, after being gathered, the
same metamorphosis takes place. The hard pectose, under the influ-
ence of the acid (or ferment) that exists in greater or less quantity
in the fruits, gradually softens and passes into pectin. If the clear
juice of ripe pears be mixed with alcohol the pectin, which cannot
dissolve in the latter liquid, is separated as a stringy gelatinous mass,
that, on drying, remains as a white body, easily reducible to a fine white
powder. The concentrated solution of pectin in water has a viscid
or gummy consistence as seen in the juice that exudes from baked
apples. :

Under the further action of heat, acids, and ferments, pectin itself
undergoes other transformations. We shall only notice its conver-
sion into pectosic and pectic acids. These bodies, chiefly the first,
together with sugar and flavoring matter, compose the delicious fruit
jellies, which, as is well known, are prepared by gently heating for
some time the expressed juice of strawberries and raspberries, or the
juice obtained by stewing apples, pears, grapes, currants, gooseberries,
plums, &c. They are both insoluble in cold water, and remain sus-
pended in it as a gelatinous mass. Pectosie acid is soluble in boiling
water, and hence most fruit jellies become liquid when heated to 212°.
On cooling, its solution gelatinizes again. Pectic acid is insoluble
even in boiling water. It is also formed when the pulp of fruits or
roots containing pectose is acted upon by alkalies or by ammonia-
oxyd of copper. This reagent (which dissolves cellulose) converts
pectose directly into pectic acid that remains in insoluble combina-
tion with oxyd of copper. )

Our knowledge of the composition of the bodies of the pectose
group is very imperfect, from the difficulty or impossibility of pre-
paring them in a state of purity. Below is a table of their composi-
tion according to the most recent investigations:

From the best analyses, and from analogy with cellulose, it is prob-
able that pectose has the same composition as pectin, or, like the
pectic and pectosic acids, differs from it only by one or more equiva-
lents of water. This relatedness of composition assists us here, asin
case of the preceding groups of organie principles, to comprehend, in
some measure, the ease with which the transformations of these bodies
are effected.

It will be perceived, by a glance at the composition of the pectose
group, that their oxygen exceeds the quantity necessary to form water
with their hydrogens by eight equivalents.

The vegetal acids are exceedingly numerous. They are found in all
classes of plants, and nearly every family in the vegetable kingdom
has one or more acids peculiar to itself.

Those we shall now notice are few in number, but of almost uni-
versal distribution. They are oxalic, tartaric, citric, and malic acids.
In plants they never occur in the free or pure state, but always com-
bined with lime, potash, ammonia, &c. They are most often accumu-
lated in large quantity in fruits.

Oxalic acid exists largely in the common sorrel, and, according to
the best observers, is found in greater or less quantity in nearly all
plants. The pure acid presents itself in the form of colorless bril-
liant transparent crystals not unlike Epsom salts in appearance, but
having an intensely sour taste. It is prepared for commerce by sub-
jecting starch or cane and grape sugar to rapid oxydation, generally
by means of nitric acid. Salt of sorrel, employed to remove ink-
stains from cloth and leather, is an oxalate of potash and water.

Tartaric acid is especially abundant in the grape, from the juice of
which during fermentation it is deposited in combination with potash,
as argol, which, by purification, yields the cream of tartar of com-
merce. Tartaric acid, when pure, occurs in large glassy crystals very
sour to the taste. It has recently been observed by Liebig as one of
the products of the artificial oxydation by nitric acid, of the peculiar
sugar found in milk, and is also probably a result of the oxydation of
gum by the same reagent.

Malic acid is the chief sour principle of apples, currants, gooseber-
ries, and many other fruits. It exists in large quantity in the garden
rhubarb, in the berries of the mountain ash and barberry, and in the
leaves of the beet and tobacco plants.

Citric acid is most abundant in the juice of the lemon, lime, and
cranberry.

All these acids usually occur together in our ordinary fruits, and in
some cases it is certain that they are converted the one into another
during the development of the plant.

Their composition is expressed in the following table: |

The vegetal acids exert an important influence in the plant as
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY, 129

well as in the food of animals, by effecting the transformation of cel-
lulose and starch into dextrin and sugar, and of pectose into pectin.

Tn all plants, and in nearly all parts of plants, we find some fixed
oil, fat (or wax;) but it is chiefly in certain seeds that they occur
most abundantly. Thus the seeds of maize, oats, hemp, flax (fig. 7 /),
colza, cotton, pea-nut, beech, almond, sunflower, &c., contain from
6 to 70 per cent. of oil, which may be in great part removed by
pressure. In some plants, as the African palm and the Nicaraguan
tallow-tree, the oil is solid at ordinary temperatures, while many
plants yield small quantities of wax, which either coats their leaves
or forms a ‘‘bloom’’ upon their fruit. The oils differ exceedingly in
taste, odor, and consistency, as well as in their chemical composition.

They all contain much carbon, and less oxygen than is requisite to
form water with their hydrogen.

The oil or fat of plants appears to be, in many cases, a product of
the transformation of starch or other member of the cellulose group,
for the oily seeds when immature contain starch, which vanishes as
they ripen, and in the sugar-cane the quantity of wax-is always
largest when the sugar is least abundant, and vice versa.

It has long been known that the ‘brain and nervous tissue of ani-
mals contain several oils of which phosphorus is an essential ingredi-
ent. Recently Knop has discovered that the sugar-pea yields a sim-
ilar oil containing 1.25 per cent. of phosphorus, in addition to carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen.

The bodies to which attention has thus been briefly directed, con-
stitute by far the larger share of the solid matter pot only of the
young cell but of all vegetation. ‘They comprise, nearly all, those
vegetable substances which are employed as food or otherwise pos-
sess any considerable agricultural significance. The numberless acids,
alkaloids, resins, volatile oils, coloring matters, and other principles
existing in small quantity in the vegetable world, are unimportant to
our present purpose.

We find under the microscope that certain of these bodies have an
organized structure; such are cellulose, starch, inulin, and gluten,
(aleuron of Hartig;) while others, as dextrin, gum, sugar, albumin,
and casein, are the products of the disorganization of those above
mentioned—the structureless materials, out of which the organized
portions of the plant renew themselves.

To return to the cell. As the life of the plant progresses, not only
does the form of the cell greatly change in many cases, but it under-
goes very marked internal transformations. The liquid that fills the
young cell contains both dextrin and albumin; from the former 1s
elaborated the walls of new cells, or else the existing cells are filled
up more or less completely with some solid carbo-hydrate resulting
from the transformation of dextrin. Thus in the potato tuber the
cells are almost entirely occupied with starch. In the stem of trees
the cells are lengthened and thickened by the continuous deposit of
cellulose with other ill-defined bodies, and the result is wood. In
the seeds of the cereal grains and numerous other plants we find the

cells densely crowded, (hence polyhedral in figure.) and filled with
9
130 LECTURES ON

starch and gluten, the latter often crystallized. In leguminous seeds
casein accumulates; while in the exterior portions of most seeds occur
cells containing, in addition to these bodies, numerous droplets of
fixed oil.—(See the figures already given.) Some cells are largely
occupied with coloring matier, which is green in leaves, red, yellow,
&e., in petals. In many cells we meet with crystals of salts; some are
compounds of vegetal acids with lime and magnesia; others are phos-
phates and sulphates.

In every plant, and in each cell, there may be found, by chemical
analysis, though generally not by the microscope alone, a certain,
never-failing content of mineral matters, which remains as ash when
the vegetable is burned. The ashes of all agricultural plants contain
the following mineral matters, to which in the table are appended
their chemical symbols:

These matters taken together form but a small part of the plant—
usually from one to five per cent. of its weight—yet they are indis-
pensable to its development, as is evident from their constant presence,
and as has been likewise proved by the most careful and extended
synthetic experiments. Without the co-operation of all these earthy
and saline matters it is impossible for plants of the higher orders to
develop themselves. ;

The Prince Salm Horstmar, of Brunswick, has made the function of
the mineral food of the plant the subject of a most extended and
laborious investigation. In experiments with the oat he found that
when silica was absent from the soil, everything else being supplied,
the plant remained smooth, pale, dwarfed, and prostrate.

Without lime the plant died in the second leaf. .

Without potash or soda it reached a height of but three inches.

Without magnesia it was very weak and prostrate.

Without phosphoric acid it remained very weak, but erect and of
normal figure, bearing fruit.

Without sulphuric acid it was still weaker; was erect and of normal
figure, but without fruit.

Without iron it was very pale, weak, and disproportioned.

Without manganese it did not attain perfect development, and bore
but few flowers.
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 131

Other experiments proved that chlorine is essential to the growth
of wheat.

Wiegmann and Polstorff found that when seeds of cress (Lepidium
sativum) were sown in minced platinum wire, contained in a platinum
crucible, and moistened with distilled water, the experiment being
conducted under a glass shade, out of reach of dust, they germinated
and grew naturally during twenty-six days, when, having reached a
height of three inches, they began to turn yellow and to die down.
On burning the plants thus produced, their ash was found to weigh
exactly as much as was obtained from a number of seeds equal to that
sown. Prince Salm Horstmar found that oats grown with addition
of fixed mineral matters (ash ingredients) only, gave four times the
mass of vegetable matter that was obtained when these were withheld.

The plant, as we have seen, is an assemblage of cells, which are
situated in more or less close contact with each other. The plants
that consist of but a few cells, like yeast, simply lie or float in the
medium in which they are naturally found. Agricultural plants, how- °
ever, and the higher orders generally, possess roots, whose functions
are performed underground, and stems, leaves, and flowers, that exist
in the air.

The yeast plant finds its food in the fermenting solution, and the
cells have a power of absorbing their nutriment out of this solution.

Marine plants wholly immersed in the ocean abstract their food
from the sea water.

The higher land plants derive the materials from which their cells
are multiplied, partly from the soz/, by their roots, and partly from the
atmosphere, by their foliage.

In the living plant, then, there is provision for the access of liquids
into the cells from without, and for the transmission of the same from
one end of the plant to the other, or in any direction; for if we plant
a seed in pure sand mingled with ashes and duly watered, we shall
find in a few weeks that a plant has resulted containing in every por-
tion of it carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, which could only kave been
derived from the atmosphere, and also saline and earthy matters, which
must have been imbibed from the ashes and carried upward to the
points of its branches and leaves.

The young cell, though its wall reveals no perforation to the most
powerful magnifier, is porous; and though the older cells, which form
the cuticle of a somewhat developed plant, are often impermeable to
water and air, from the fact that they are indurated or glazed by the
formation of a corky or waxy coating, yet the young cells that are
continually forming at the extremities of the advancing rootlets, and
those of the still fresh leaves, are highly porous, and no more oppose
resistance to the passage of water or of air than does a sieve.

We have only to immerse the roots of a vigorous plant in a solution
colored with some harmless pigment, and in a short time we can trace
its diffusion throughout the plant.

If liquids thus easily permeate these tissues, there is every reason
to suppose that they may admit the vastly more subtle particles of a
gas; and of this we have abundant experimental evidence, as will be
set forth bye and bye.

LECTURE II.

THE ATMOSPHERE AND WATER IN THEIR RELATIONS TO VEGETABLE LIFE.

In the former lecture we have seen that the plant is a collection of
cells, and the residence of an organizing up-building agency—the
vital principle. We have seen that the cells. are composed of, or
occupied with, carbo-hydrates, albuminoids, fats, and salts. The
structure of the plant admits the entrance of gases and liquids, and
their diffusion throughout its mass.

We are now prepared to inquire what are the materials employed
by the plant in its development—what is the food of vegetation?

A seed sown in a moist sand may grow into a perfect plant, and

roduce a hundred new seeds, each as large and complete as the first,
although the sand, the water, and the air, which only can have
nourished the plant, contain no traces of cellulose or starch, of al-
bumen or oil. .

These proximate elements of vegetation are then obviously con
structed by the plant out of other forms or combinations of matter
belonging to the mineral world, and to be sought in the atmosphere,
in water, and in the soil.

Of the entire mass of the plant, but a small portion is derived from
the soil, ninety-five to ninety-nine per cent. of it coming originally
from the atmosphere.

The general composition of the pure and dry atmosphere, according
to the most reliable data is, by weight, as follows: (To the names of
the ingredients are appended their chemical symbols.)

Oxygen, O---- seer eee eee eee eee Ly aces els
Nitrogen, N---+ s+e2++ cree cece tee ee eee eee 76.82
100.00

Besides the above ingredients, whose proportion is very constant,
there occur in it the following substances in more variable quantity:

Water, (as vapor,) HO, average 1-hundredth.

Carbonic acid, CO,, average 6 ten-thousandths.

Ammonia, NH,, average 23 billionths.

Nitric acid, NO,?

Carburetted hydrogen, CH?

Nitrous oxyd NO?

Let us now inquire with reference to each of these substances,
how is it related to the nourishment of the plant? A number of ex-
ceedingly ingenious experiments have been instituted from time to
time for the purpose of throwing light on this subject, and we are
thus fortunately able to present it in a quite satisfactory manner.

As to oxygen, we have no evidence that it directly feeds the plant,
or is assimilated, so as to increase the mass of its organic matter.
On the contrary, plants when growing exhale oxygen, separating it
from the carbon and hydrogen of their proper food.

The presence of oxygen in the atmosphere is, however, in many
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 133

ways, essential to the perfection of the plant; for in its absence seeds
cannot germinate, flowers cannot yield fruit, and fruits cannot ripen.
In germination the larger bulk of the seed, the cotyledons, by the
absorption of oxygen, are disorganized and converted into structure-
less and soluble bodies, which become the food of the smaller part of
the seed, the embryo, a and by its vital operations are again organized
as the young plant. In the process of flowering, matters stored in
organized form in other parts of the plant are transported to the
blossom to serve for its rapid development. The flower itself cannot
absorb food from without; and in the transformation of the already
elaborated food from the stem and leaves of the plant into the new
forms required by the flowers, oxygen plays an essential part. The
reawakening of life in the tree at spring time, and the ripening of
fruits, are accompanied with changes of a similar character, and from
them result many oxydized products. Vegetable physiologists have
furnished microscopic evidence that similar alternations of the orga-
nizing and disorganizing processes take place in the individual cells,
SO that we are warranted in assuming that oxygen (whether that of
the free atmosphere or that evolved in the cells themselves is in-
different) plays an important and unceasing part in the development
of vegetation.

Nitrogen in the free state also appears to be incapable of direct
assimilation. Within a few years the subject has been studied by
various investigators, but with contradictory results. Ville, of Paris,
in 1853, published a volume describing his experiments, which led to
the conclusion already arrived at by Priestley, in 1779, viz:. that
nitrogen is assimilated. Other investigators, however, by means of
trials carried out under conditions less complicated and more adapted
to yield reliable evidence, have uniformly been conducted to the
opposite view.

Especially to Boussingault do we owe a most careful investigation of
this question. His plan of experi- Fig. 9.
ment was simply to cause plants :
to grow in circumstances where,
every other condition of develop-
ment being supplied, the only source
of nitrogen at their command, be-
sides that contained in the seed it-
self, should be the free nitrogen of
the atmosphere. For this purpose
he prepared a soil consisting of
pumice stone and the ashes of clover,
freed by heat and acid from all
compounds of nitrogen. This soil
he placed at: the bottom of a large
glass globe, (see figure 9,) of 15 ‘to
20g gallons capacity. Seeds of cress
or of other plants were deposited inf
the soil, and pure water supplied to 7
them. After germination, a small ““””7”
glass vessel (D) filled with carbonic acid (to eigally carbon) was secured

134 LECTURES ON

air-tight to the mouth of the large globe, and, the apparatus being
disposed in a suitably lighted place, was left to itself until the plants
began to turn yellow and show signs of decay. Then they were re-
moved, separated from the soil, and, by chemical analysis, the amount
of nitrogen in them was ascertained. It was found in every instance
(the experiment being several times repeated) that the nitrogen in the
plants thus raised was no more than that contained in the seed from
which they had grown. Our ingenious countryman, Dr. Evan Pugh,
now president of the Farmers’ College of Pennsylvania, while resi-
dent in England a few years since, made an elaborate investigation
of this subject, with results confirming those of Boussingault.

So far from the external free nitrogen being assimilated, it appears,
especially from the researches of Dr. Draper, of New York, that
plants constantly evolve this substance in the gaseous form; al-
though, according to the investigations of Unger and Knop, made
more recently, and with more exact methods, the nitrogen found by
various observers in the exhaled air of plants comes only from the
atmospheric air absorbed by them.

It thus appears that the two gases which, together, make up
ninety-nine per cent. or more of the atmosphere, do not constitute
in any way the direct food of vegetation. It is, in fact, in the small
quantity of other and somewhat variable ingredients that we must
look for the atmospheric nutriment of the vegetable kingdom.

Water in the vaporized form we find never absent from the air,
and it is especially abundant in the warm period of the year when
vegetation is active. Its presence is made evident by its deposition
in the states of dew, fog, rain, and snow, when the temperature of
the atmosphere is reduced.

It has been universally taught that the watery vapor which is thus
in perpetual contact with the leaves of plants is readily and largely
absorbed by them. According to Unger and Duchartre, however, it
is never imbibed by foliage in even the slightest degree. On the
contrary, under all circumstances there occurs a constant loss of water
by evaporation from the leaves, which does not wholly cease even
when they are confined in an atmosphere saturated with moisture.
Duchartre admits that liquid water in contact with the leaves is
slightly absorbed; but it would appear that the root is the organ of
absorption for water, and that the soil must perform the function of
supplying this indispensable body to the plant. 4

It has long been known that water is absorbed by the roots in
large quantity, and exhaled through the leaves into the atmosphere.
The well-known trials of Hales prove this. He found, in one in-
stance, that a single cabbage exhaled 25 ounces of water in 24 hours.
We owe to Mr. Lawes, of Rothamstead, England, a series of experi-
ments on the transpiration of water through wheat, barley, beans,
peas, and clover, continued throughout nearly the whole period of the
growth of these plants. The result was, that for every grain of solid
matter added to the mass of the plant 150 to 270 grains of water
passed through it. From these, and especially from very recent in-
vestigations of Knop and Sachs, it is seen that the transpiration is
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 135

very variable, as might be anticipated. It takes place most rapidly in
a dry, warm air, but is not absolutely checked when the atmosphere
is saturated with moisture. Transpiration is remarkably diminished
by the presence of many soluble salts, and of the alkalies, in the water
of the soil; while free acids increase its rapidity and amount.

As is well known, water is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen;
although we have no direct evidence, the inference is fully warranted
that a portion of the water which enters the plant by the roots is
arrested in its upward path, to become itself a part of the tissues.
It is either held in the form of hygroscopic moisture, or is united
chemically to carbon; or, finally, it is decomposed, its hydrogen being
retained, and its oxygen eliminated wholly or in part. In fact, we
must regard water as the chief source of the hydrogen which is a com-
ponent of almost every vegetable principle.

Carbonic acid is a compound of carbon and oxygen. It exists in
immense quantities in solid combination with lime in the various mar-
bles, limestones and marls, and in chalk. Separated from these bodies
by pouring on them sulphuric or nitric acid, it may be collected as a
gas, which, unrecognizable by the other senses, is agreeably sour to
the taste; is two and a half times heavier than common air, and con-
siderably soluble in water. This gas is never absent from the air, and
although it occurs there in relatively small quantity, its absolute
amount is so great that, taking the atmosphere up to its entire height,
we have no less than seven tons of carbonic acid over every acre of
surface.

A plant confined in an atmosphere free from this gas cannot enlarge
itself.* Some plants will live and grow in a confined space, as for
example, sealed up in a bottle ; but in this case the carbonic acid con-
sumed by the growing parts of the plant is supplied by the decay of
the lower leaves.

Priestly and Saussure long ago, furnished experimental evidence
that carbonic acid is absorbed by growing plants, and Boussingault
has described the following illustration of the rapidity with which the
gas is imbibed by the foliage of vegetation. Into one of the orifices
in a three-necked glass globe he introduced the branch of a living
vine bearing twenty leaves; with another opening he connected an
apparatus by means of which-a slow current of air, containing a small,
accurately known proportion of carbonic acid could be passed into the
globe. This air after streaming over the vine leaves, escaped by the
third neck into an arrangement for collecting and weighing the car-
bonic acid that remained in it. The experiment being set in process
in the sun-light, it was found that the enclosed foliage removed from
the current of air three-fourths of the carbonic acid it at first con-
tained.

The absorption of the gas in question by the leaves is found to take
place only under the influence of the light of the sun, or of the accom-
panying chemical rays. Through the roofs, carbonic acid, when held
in sohition of water, may be absorbed at all times.

* Unless, indeed, as is probable, carburetted hydrogen may, to a small extent, be an actual
source of carbon to plants, a point not yet satisfactorily determined.
136 LECTURES ON

It is, however, only in the sun-light, and with many plants (accord-
ing to the recent researches of Corenwinder) only in direct sun-light
that carbonic acid or, more properly, carbon is assimilated. We have
already alluded to ‘he fact that oxygen is exhaled by the plant. This
oxygen comes from the decomposition of carbonic acid (and water) in
the interior of the plant. The vegetable cell aided by the sun has
the power of separating the elements of this compound with the great-
est ease, and it retains the carbon to add to its structure while the
oxygen escapes entirely or in part into the general atmosphere.

As already mentioned, however, oxygen itself, under certain cireum-
stances, more particularly at certain stages of vegetable development,
is absorbed; and as a consequence of this and at just the same time,
carbonic acid is evolved. This separation of carbonic acid may be
observed in all young plants (still depending upon the disorganization
of the parent seed) when situated in the shade; and some plants exhale
it at all periods of their growth when not exposed to direct sun-light.

All plants exhale carbonic acid during the night or in the entire
absence of sun-light; but the amount of this eas that is absorbed and
decomposed by day vastly exceeds that evolved by night. In fact,
one hour or half hour of direct sunshine enables it to absorb and de-
compose more than has escaped from it in a whole night.

Carbonic acid gas is unquestionably the chief source of the carbon
of agricultural plants. Some writers, with Liebig, consider it to be
practically the exclusive means of supplyi ing this element. Others,
after Saussure and Mulder, regard the slightly soluble compounds re-
resulting from the decay ae vegetable matter (humus) in the soil, as

capable “of directly supplying a portion of carbon to a new generation
of plants. While there is perhaps no satisfactory evidence that humus
is entirely excluded from immediately nourishing vegetation, it is plain
from considerations founded in the growth of forests and prairie grasses
that the atmosphere, and indeed carbonic acid is now entitled to rank
as the great storehouse of carbon for this purpose, as once, before
humus existed, it must have been the exclusive source of this element.

From what has been already remarked with regard to the compo-
sition of the vegetable carbo-hydrates, it is seen that a certain general
theoretical view of their formation in the plant may be at once gath-
ered from the facts now set forth. In order to form the members of
the cellulose group, it is only needful that the carbon retained by the
cells from the carbonic acid which they decompose so readily, should
enter into union with adue amount of the water that perpetually streams
upward through them. By the elimination of a portion of oxygen
from the water itself, we have remaining the elements that form the
fats and fixed oils. To yield the vegetable acids and the pectose
group, it suffices that a portion of oxygen be retained or be reabsorbed.
These considerations are purely hypothetical, yet, although the real
processes of decomposition and organization are in many cases vastly
more complex, they possess great interest in a survey of the economy
of vegetation.

For the elaboration of the albuminoids, a source of nitrogen must be
present tothe plant. This essential element is supplied, so far as the
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. Hai

atmosphere is concerned, almost entirely in the form of ammonia.
This substance, familiar under the common name of hartshorn or spirits
of hartshorn, is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen, and is charac-
terized by its alkaline or basic properties, having a caustic burning
taste and uniting with avidity to acids, forming a large class of salts.

In the atmosphere, in presence of an excess of carbonic acid, it
cannot occur in the free state, but always exists as bicarbonate of
ammonia, the same form in which it usually constitutes ‘* salt of harts-
horn’”’ or ‘‘smelling salts.’’

Bicarbonate of ammonia may not only occur in the solid state as a
white powder, but also readily assumes the condition of a gas, as 1s
evident from the volatile pungency of smelling salts. It is readily
dissolved to a very great extent by water ; but as readily evaporates
from solution again, leaving the water almost entirely free from it.
For this reason its amount in the atmosphere is so variable and so
small, it being removed by every shower of rain or deposition of dew
and again restored by warmth and wind, or such causes as favor
vaporization.

In fact it is not by examining the air itself that we gain any ade-
quate idea of the amount of ammonia it may furnish to vegetation.
We must rather look to the atmospheric waters, to dews, rains, and
fogs, in order to estimate this matter rightly. In rain water (the entire
fall) the quantity of ammonia is also quite variable, ranging in the
country from 4 to 19 parts in ten millions; while in the rain falling in
cities a 10 times larger amount has been observed.—(Boussingault,
Bineau, and Way.)

In the first. portions of rain or in slight showers, as well as in fog
and dew, the proportion of ammonia is considerably larger. Thus, in
the first 10th of a slow falling rain, Boussingault found 66 parts in
10 million of water; in dew, he found 62, and in fog 72, and in one
extraordinary instance 497 parts of ammonia in 10 million of water.

Way has determined the entire amount of ammonia contained in
the rain water that fell during the years 1855 and 1856 at Rotham-
stead, 20 miles from Linden. He found that the water which fell on
an acre of surface contained in 1855, 7.11 pownds, and in 1856, 9.53
pounds of ammonia.

The evidence that ammonia is capable of absorption and assimila-
tion by the plant is as various as it is conclusive. Numerous field ex-
periments made with artificial ammonia-compounds, as well as the
fact that all animal manures in the very process of decay, whereby
they appear first to acquire their full activity, yield this body in
abundance—practically establish the point; nor are there wanting
more precise investigations.

Ville especially, also Chlebodarow, have shown that the addition
of ammonia to the ordinary atmosphere, as well as watering with its
dilute solution greatly increases the mass of vegetation produced,
and makes the same much richer in albuminoids. Ville has intro-
duced the use of ammonia into conservatories with quite striking
effect, diffusing into the air of the green-house from two to four 10-
thousandths of its weight of carbonate of ammonia by placing a lump
of this salt upon the steam pipes that supply the space with heat.
138 LECTURES ON

Nitric acid, the well-known compound of nitrogen and oxygen, oc-
curs in the atmosphere in very minute quantity, usually in the form
of nitrate of ammonia. This body being incapable of existing in
vapor, and readily soluble in water, is brought to the earth in dews
and rains. Its quantity is even more minute than that of ammonia.
The most trustworthy estimations are those of Way, who found in the
waters that fell upon an acre at Rothamstead, in 1855, 2.98 pounds,
and in that of 1856, 2.80 pounds of nitrie acid, or about one part of
nitric acid to two million parts of water.

In the soil, nitric acid often occurs in considerable quantity, (the
result of chemical processes which we shall presently notice.) Here it
exists in combination with various bases, usually as nitrates of lime,
soda, and potash. The fertility of soils in which nitrates accumu-
late, and the remarkable effects of their application as fertilizers, are
evidence that nitric acid feeds vegetation.

Fig. Ul. Fig. 10. It is again to Boussingault
qe that we owe the more careful
| study of its effects. Among
other experiments he made
the following: Two seeds
of Helianthus argophyllus were
planted in each of three pots,
the soil of which, consisting
of a mixture of brick-dust and
asand, as wellas the pots them-
“selves, had been thoroughly
freed from all nitrogenous com-
pounds by ignition and washing
with distilled water. To the soil
of the pot A, fig. 10, nothing was
added save the two seeds, and
distilled water, with which all
the plants were watered from
time totime. With the soil of
pot C (fig.12)were incorporated
small quantities of phosphate
of lime, of ashes of clover and
bicarbonate of potash, in or-
der that the plants growing
in it might have an abundant
supply of all the mineral mat-
ters they needed. Finally, the
soil of pot B, fig. 11, received
the same mineral matters as
} pot C, and in addition, a small
quantity of nitric acid as ni-
trate of potash. The seeds
were sown on the 5th of July, and on the 30th September, the
plants had the relative size and appearance seen in the figures, re-
duced to one-sixth of the natural dimensions.

This striking experiment demonstrates that nitric acid directly
serves to supply nitrogen to plants. In fact, it appears to equal
ammonia in its assimilability.

Liebig was formerly of the opinion that ammonia was the only form
in which vegetation could be supplied with nitrogen, and that nitric
acid was not appropriated by the plant untilafter it had become con-
verted into ammonia in the soil. We know that under the influence
of certain bodies having strong affinities for oxygen, nitric acid is
transformed into ammonia, hydrogen displacing oxvgen. This change
was supposed to occur in the soil by virtue of the action of the car-
bonaceous matters (humus) there present. Now, while this may
actually happen under certain circumstances, it is well ascertained
that the soil and natural waters more generally contain nitrates than
salts of ammonia, and the actual conversion of ammonia into nitrates
in the soil has been experimentally traced.

The presence of nitrous oxyd in the atmosphere is not as yet directly
proved, from want of a proper method of detecting it when forming
but a small proportion of a gaseous mixture; but Knop has shown the
probability of its occurrence there, and has proved that it may serve
as a source of nitrogen to plants. What may be its significance in the
actual nourishment of vegetation remains to be determined.

The important questions now arise, what are the sources of the
water, carbonic acid, ammonia, and nitric acid, that exist in the atmos-
phere? are these minute quantities liable to exhaustion? are they
sufficient to supply vegetation with carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen?

The time was—so the reasonings of geology convince us—when the
soil, having scarcely cooled down from a state of fusion by fire, could
contain no carbon, or at least no nitrogen, ina form capable of feeding
plants. Consequently, at this period all the nitrogen, and by far the
larger share of the carbon, destined to aid the growth of plants must
have existed in the air; and although processes subsequently came
into operation whereby portions of these substances were incorporated
with the soil, the final result of natural operations is to restore them
in great part to the atmosphere.

The effect of oxygen, as manifested in the processes of decay, com-
bustion, and animal nutrition, is to bring down the vegetable organism
to the inorganic level—to convert the carbo-hydrates, the albuminoids
and other proximate principles of vegetation, into carbonic acid, water,
ammonia, and nitric acid, the very materials out of which, under the
influence of the vital principle, they were constructed.

These three varieties of chemical disorganization, which were par-
allel with the vital up-building of vegetation, deserve a somewhat
extended notice.

Decay is a general term expressing the wasting or destruction of
organic bodies under the influence of warmth, oxygen, and water.

The carbo-hydrates, when perfectly pure and dry, may be preserved
indefinitely without undergoing any change. This we know in the
case of cellulose, (cotton, paper,) sugar, starch, &c. In presence of
a certain amount of water, and exposed to the air at a warm tempera-
ture, they undergo change; which, in case of cellulose, is very slow,
140 LECTURES ON

in sugar is more rapid. The oils in the pure state, as well-as the

organic acids, are extremely slow in alteration. The albuminoids,

also, when dry may be kept at ordinary temperatures for an indefinite

time with no symptoms of change. If, however, they be exposed to
warm air in the moist state, they speedily undergo the process of
putrefaction; they decay with great rapidity, and with the production

of volatile bodies having a most intense and noisome odor.

The albuminoids are highly complex in their chemical composition;
their atoms are, so to speak, delicately poised, and in a condition
of unstable equilibrium, and, for this reason, liable to easy disturbance
by any external agency. Hence, they at once break up into several
less complex and more stable compounds when heat and oxygen act
upon them with the intervention of water. Not only so, but in their
fall they entangle the carbo-hydrates, the oils, the acids, and in fact
all the organic constituents of the plant. In this way the soluble
albuminoids act as ferments. Sugar dissolved in water is slow to
change, until a decaying albuminoid, furnished by yeast, be added,
when it is rapidly transformed into alcohol or acetic acid and carbonic
acid. Butter, if carefully made, keeps sweet a long time; but if the
casein of the milk be not thoroughly removed, it speedily becomes
rancid, when air and warmth act upon it.

It is possible that the carbo-hydrates, if they could be absolutely
separated and protected from matter containing nitrogen, would be
found capable of perpetual preservation, even in contact with water,
for in the presence of a minute quantity of some metallic salt, or other
body that makes insoluble (inactive) compounds with the albuminoids,
they do remain unaffected for long periods. Thus wood, which, though
chiefly consisting of cellulose or other non-nitrogenous bodies, is not
free from albumin, when exposed to the weather—7. e., to oxygen,
water, and warmth—undergoes that form of slow decay known as
mouldering or humifaction, the immediate visible result of which is
vegetable mould or humus. If, however, the wood be first saturated
with corrosive sublimate (kyanized) or blue vitrol, it resists decay for
a long time.

As it happens naturally, with very few exceptions, the organic
matter of vegetation, or of animals that have subsisted upon and
been formed from vegetation, falling upon the surface of the earth or
buried a little way beneath it, find just the conditions of decay; and
their nitrogenized ingredients yielding first to the sway of oxygen,
involve with them the whole organism, so that nothing but their
mineral matters, which are already oxyds, escape the destruction.

The process of decay, thus sketched in outline, includes, however,
numberless intermediate stages. Thus wood in its decay yields a
large series of bodies which have the collective name of humus, but
are distinguished into several groups, as the humic acids, ulmic acids,
and geic acids, the latter comprising crenic and apocrenic acids. These
bodies all differ from wood, out of which they originated, by containing
much less hydrogen and oxygen compared to carbon. We can, in fact,
trace the gradual removal of these elements up to a certain point, after
which other products arise from the simple oxydation of those first

AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 141

formed. The fact that hydrogen is more susceptible of oxydation than
carbon, to a certain extent explains the production of these bodies.

In the decay of sugar under the action of ferments there appears
in an analogous manner a series of intermediate bodies, which differ
in character according to the circumstances under which the fermen-
tation is conducted.

The intermediate products of the decay of vegetable matters, wood,
&c., accumulate in large masses, especially where submersion in water
cuts off the free access of oxygen and keeps the temperature reduced.
In this way the peat of swamps and bogs is formed, and the immense
coal beds now buried in the rock strata of the earth are doubtless
nothing but the peat of a former geological epoch altered in its
character by further chemical agencies.

The final products of complete decay are universally the same,
whatever may be the intervening stages. The carbon of organic
bodies is oxydized to carbonic acid. The hydr ogen is mainly converted
into water. Nitrogen unites more or less with hydrogen, forming am-
monia; in part, however, it escapes in the free state. Sulphur and phos-
phorus are converted into sulphuric and phosphoric acids. The jixed
mineral eeu remain.

Combustion, or burning, is likewise a process of oxydation. It
differs from ee in the rapidity with which it occurs, and in the
different intermediate products that result; but otherwise it is the
same, its final issues being identical with those of decay. Combus-
tion may, in fact, be called a quick decay, as decay has been termed
by Liebig, a slow burning—eremecausis. It is easy to illustrate, by
simple experiments, the ioe mation of water, carbonic acid, and am-
monia in the burning of organic substances.

When burning non-nitrogenous bodies, as the wax and cotton of a
lighted taper, are looked upon, under ordinary circumstances, we
gain the impression, indeed, that they themselves waste away, but
we perceive no result of the fire except light and heat. If, how-
ever, an inverted dry glass bottle be lowered over the flame, and
held so for a time, a mist presently gathers on its interior walls, and
after a little drops of a liquid may be collected which are pure water.
The bottle still being kept in the same position, we shortly see the
flame becoming smaller, and its light dimmer, making it evident that
something in the air which feeds the flame is being exhausted from
the limited space that surrounds it. If, now, the bottle be removed,
and have a little clear lime-water agitated in it, there will at once be
formed a copious precipitate, as the chemist technically designates it,
of carbonate of lime, the lime-water having served to make the in-
visible carbonic acid that resulted from the union of atmospheric
oxygen with the carbon of the wax, evident to the sense of sight.

During the combustion ofa nitrogenous body, in addition to water and
carbonic eal we may detect ammonia. Thus, if the smoke ofa cigar be
puffed against moist turmeric paper, (paper saturated with the yellow
coloring principle of the turmeric or curcuma root, which is turned
brown by alkalies,) the change of color at once shows the presence of
ammonia. This body is always found in the soot of chimneys, where
142 LECTURES ON

wood is burned. It is collected, too, in great quanties in the gas-
works of large cities, being formed from the nitrogen of the bitumin-
ous coal which is distilled and imperfectly burned in the gas retorts.
The common name, spirits of hartshorn, originated in the fact of the
preparation of this substance from the horn of deer, (hart.)

When combustion goes on with full access of oxygen a good deal
of nitrogen escapes in the free state, the hydrogen it might unite
with to form ammonia being chiefly appropriated by the more active
oxygen. In proportion as the burning proceeds with a limited sup-
ply of oxygen, and at a lower temperature, more ammonia is proba-
bly formed. In presence of a fixed alkali, as potash, soda, or lime,
all the nitrogen of organic bodies may be converted into ammonia;
and it is by an ingenious use of this fact that the chemist is enabled
to determine with the greatest ease and accuracy the proportions of
nitrogen which organic bodies contain.

As in decay, so in combustion, it easily happens that numerous in-
termediate products occur, especially when the supply of oxygen is
deficient. The oil, tar, smoke, and soot of ordinary fires are ex-
amples. All these substances, however, by access of more oxygen
at the proper temperature, may be fully consumed into the same final
products as mentioned under decay. The mineral matters of organic
bodies remain in this process as ashes.

The third means of restoring to the gaseous state the elements so-
lidified by vegetation is found in the results of the animal functions,
viz: in nutrition and respiration.

The non-nitrogenous food of animals, consisting always of the vege-
table carbo-hydrates, oils, &c., or of certain products of their trans-
formation, are chiefly burned in the body by the oxygen that the
lungs inhale, and the carbonic acid and water thus formed are
thrown out of the system with the exhaled air. If one breathes
through a tube into a glass bottle, the deposition of moisture proves
the existence of water in the expired air; and by forcing the breath
through lime-water the formation of the white precipitate of carbo-
nate of lime reveals the presence of carbonic acid.

The lungs and the skin, which also constantly throw off the same
substances by perspiration, are the agencies whereby the gaseous
products of the oxydation of the food are restored to the atmosphere.
The kidneys and lower intestines remove a portion of the waste; the
former in the liquid, the latter in the solid form. A small part of
the nitrogen, of which animals require constant supplies in their
nutriment, is exhaled as ammonia from the lungs and skin; but as
the caustic characters possessed by this body, even when in combi-
nation with carbonic acid, would not be compatible with its copious
separation in the gaseous form, we must look to the liquid or solid
dejections for the excretion of nitrogen. In animals we find that the
kidneys dispose of this element. In the blood of man and quadru-
peds there may be detected a substance which the kidneys collect
and discharge from the body in large quantities through the urine.
This substance, from its occurrence, is termed wea. When pure, it
1s a colorless or white body that may be procured in beautiful erys-
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 13

tals, and has a not unpleasant saline taste. In a state of purity its
solution in water may be kept indefinitely without change; but in
presence of a ferment, (an oxydizing albuminoid,) with which it is
always naturally associated, it speedily undergoes decomposition; and
by simply involving a certain amount of water in its change falls into
the same substances which we have so often referred to as among the
termini of vegetable and animal disorganization, viz: c: iene acid
and ammonia. The following scheme illustrates this change:

Besides urea there occurs in the urine of man, and in large quan-
tity in that of herbivorous animals, a body containing nitrogen which
bears the name Aippuric acid. In the urine of carnivorous animals,
and especially in the solid urine of birds and reptiles, is found wrie
acid. Both these substances readily undergo conversion into carbo-
nate of ammonia.

In the solid excrement of animals are found other bodies contain-
ing nitrogen, which by decay shortly restore the same to the atmos-
phere.

The processes we have thus briefly noticed do not, as already inti-
mated, fully and immediately change the organized matter of vegeta.
bles and animals back again into the substances which, according to
our present knowledge, are to be regarded as the food of the plant.
In the immense coal beds of former epochs and in the vast deposits
of peat and sunken drift-wood that are now accumulating in marshes
and river deltas, an enormous quantity of carbon and of nitr ogen too,
is, so far as the historical age is concerned, permanently set aside from
the great circulation of matter.

What is of more agriculturai importance, a large amount of nitro-
gen escapes in the free state into the atmosphere, and thus becomes
lost. to the staves of: nutriment for plants. But there are other re-
sources provided in nature’s economy to maintain the requisite equi-
librium.

The numerous voleanoes from which the smoke of central fires is
perpetually escaping, pour daily into the atmosphere vast volumes of
carbonic acid and not a little ammonia. In many regions, not in the
usual sense volcanic, the earth is full of fissures that give forth un-
ceasing streams of these gases. In the district of the Eifel, on the west-
ern shore of the Rhine, it has been estimated that 100,000 tons of
carbonic acid are annually thrown into the atmosphere.

But the principal means of resupplying carbonic acid and ammonia
consists in the combustion of the coal and peat that represent the
144 LECTURES ON

vegetation of former times, or, indeed, of pre-Adamite epochs. It
it is calculated that the carbonic acid yearly produced by the consump-
tion of bituminous and anthracite coals in Great Britain amounts to
fifty millions of tons, a quantity capable of supplying carbon to seven-
eichths of all the cultivated crops of that country.

‘The deficit of nitrogen-compounds is made up in part by electrical
discharges in the atmosphere. Cavendish was the first to notice that
the electric spark causes nitrogen and oxygen, In a state of mixture,
to combine into nitric acid. In accordance with this observation, it
is found that the rain which falis during thunder storms contains more
nitric acid than at other times. Although in our latitude the amount
of plant food thus formed may be very trifling, it is possibly other-
wise in tropical regions, where, according to the testimony of trav-
ellers, the rumbling of thunder may be heard at any hour of the day
during a considerable portion of the year.

The conversion of free nitrogen into ammonia is not known to take
place in the atmosphere, nor are we certain that it is accomplished in
the soil. It has, indeed, been asserted by Hermann and Mulder that,
during the decay of wood, hydrogen is evolved, which, at the mo-
ment of liberation, unites itself to nitrogen with the production of
ammonia, but the experiments on which this assumption was based
do not now appear to be worthy of confidence. .

In the soil, however, there does occur a constant formation of nitric
acid, especially where lime or other alkaline bodies are present that
may combine with it. It appears, indeed, that the greater share of
this nitric acid results from the oxydation of the nitrogen of organic
debris, but 1t is probable that the free atmospheric njtrogen is, to
some extent, involved.

When electrical discharges are made to pass through the air or
through pure oxygen gas, the latter shortly acquires entirely new
properties. The most remarkable change it undergoes consists in its
obtaining a powerful and peculiar odor, the same which is so often
perceived near where lightning has struck. The oxygen, thus modi-
fied, is found to be capable of much more rapid and intense action
upon other bodies than is exerted by ordinary oxygen. It at once
oxydizes ammonia to nitric acid and water, and also, in presence of
an alkali or lime, unites direct with free nitrogen producing a nitrate.
Oxygen thus altered, and intensified in its affinities, is termed ozone —
or active oxygen, and not only is it produced by electiicity, but like- —
wise by certain processes of oxydation. When phosphorus slowly
oxydizes in the air, when the oils of turpentine and bitter almonds
are exposed to the atmosphere for atime, the same ozonization oc-
curs. Schoenbein, to whose assiduous researches we owe these highly
interesting facts, is of the opinion that all instances of nitrification
are due to the action of ozone. Although we are not as yet able to
make a probable estimate of the amount of free nitrogen that is thus
oxydized in any given time, or to form any notion of the quantitative
importance of the effects of this agent, we have the satisfaction of
standing on a threshold which promises us an entrance into the full
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 145

understanding of the processes by which the element nitrogen is
made assimilable to vegetation.

Within a few years numerous investigations relative to this subject
have been made. Luca has observed that when air (freed from am-
monia) is passed through a solution of potash, nitrate of potash is
formed, in case the air has been in previous contact with the foliage
of plants, but not otherwise; thus indicating that the oxygen is ozon-
ized by the oxydations going on in or about living vegetation (espe-
cially when ethereal oils are exhaled?) and, according to Pless and
Pierre, ozone is also produced in the decay of the organic matters of
the soil.

If, as thus appears probable, it is the case that the very existence
of living plants, and certain later stages of their destruction by
decay, are means of recombining nitrogen to an extent equal to or
slightly greater than that to which this element is placed beyond the
reach of vegetable assimilation in the earlier steps of organic decom-
position, we see that the vegetable germ carries with it, so far as this
element is concerned, the possibility of an almost unlimited, reproduc-
tion or expansion.

Allusion has already been made to the possibility of the occurrence
of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere, but we have as yet no positive
evidence of the fact.

Having thus shown the origin of the compounds out of which, for the
most part, the plant organizes itself, and explained, so far as the
present state of science allows, how the supplies that are continually
being consumed are as continually maintained, we now come properly
to consider the question, Are the atmospheric stores sufficient for the
purposes of vegetation ?

To this inquiry we must undoubtedly reply, that while the quantity
of carbonic acid absolutely contained in the atmosphere is so large as
to feed an abundant vegetation, it being experimentally shown that
some plants are able to grow well with none other than the ordinary
atmospheric supplies, it appears that a concentration of this substance
in the vicinity of the absorbing organs not only develops, but is essen-
tial to the intense growth which characterizes agricultural production.

Liebig and others have instanced forests and prairies as proving the
sufficiency of the atmosphere in this respect, for, say they, under the
occupancy of trees and grasses the soil is constantly enriched in car-
bon drawn from the atmosphere by these plants and annually deposited
upon the soil as fallen foliage. In our view, however, the fact that a
forest does not come into its most vigorous growth before the soil has
been covered with decaying leaves, proves that the general atmos-
phere is insufficient, not indeed in the amount, but in the rapidity of
its provision, and that an atmosphere more highly charged than usual
with the products of vegetable decay, near or in the soil, is essential
to the full supply of carbonic acid. The same doctrine must obtain
with reference to the other forms of plant-food. It is, in fact, needful
that the soil become a medium for the condensation and more speedy
transmission into the plant of the originally purely atmospheric sup-
plies. We shall recur to this subject in subsequent pages,

Closing here our study of the atmosphere considered as a source of
the food of plants, we still need to remark somewhat upon the physi-
cal properties of gases in relation to vegetable life; so far, at least, as
may give some idea of the means by which they gain access into the

lant.

: Whenever two or more gases are brought into contact in a confined
space, they instantly begin to intermingle, and continue so to do until,
in a short time, they are each equally diffused throughout the room
they occupy or pass into a condition of osmotic equilibrium. If two
vessels, one filled with carbonic acid, the other with hydrogen, be con-
nected by a tube no wider than a straw, and be placed so that the heavy

Fig. 13. carbonic acid is below the fifteen times lighter hy-
drogen, we shall find after the lapse of a few hours
that the two bodies are in a state of uniform mix-
ture. On closer study of this phenomenon it has
been discovered that gases diffuse with a rapidity
proportioned to their lightness. Hence, by inter-
posing a porous membrane between two gases of
unequal density, the lighter passing more rapidly
into the denser than the latter into the former, the
space on one side of the membrane is overfilled
while the other side is partially emptied of gas.
This fact is taken advantage of for the visible illus-
tration of the fact of gaseous diffusion.

In the accompanying figure 13 is represented along
glass tube 6 widened above into a funnel, and having
cemented upon this an inverted cylindrical cup of
unglazed porcelaina. The funnel rests ina round
aperture made in the horizontal arm of the support
while the tube below dips beneath the surface of
some water Contained in the wine glass. The porous
cup, funnel, and tube being occupied with common
air, a glass bell cis filled with hydrogen gas and
placed over the cup as shown in the figure. In-
stantly bubbles begin to escape rapidly from the
bottom of the tube through the water of the wine
J glass, thus demonstrating that hydrogen passes into
the cup faster than air can escape outward through its pores. If the
bell be removed, the cup is at once bathed again externally in common
air, the light hydrogen floating instantly upward, and now the water
begins to rise in the tube in consequence of the return to the outer
atmosphere of the hydrogen which before had diffused into the cup.

It is the perpetual action of this diffusive, or, as it is scientifically
termed, osmotic tendency, which maintains the atmosphere in a state
of such uniform mixture that accurate analyses of it give for oxygen
and nitrogen almost identical figures, at all times of the day, at all
seasons, all altitudes, and all situations, except near the central sur-
face of large bodies of still water. Here the fact that oxygen is more
largely absorbed by water than nitrogen diminishes by a minute amount
the usual proportion of the former gas.

AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 147

If into a limited volume of several gases be placed a body in the
solid or liquid form, which is capable of uniting with chemically, or
otherwise destroying the gaseous condition of one of the gases, it will
at once absorb those particles of this gas which lie in its immediate
vicinity and thus disturb the osmotic equilibrium of the remaining
mixture. This equilibrium is at once restored by diffusion of a por-
tion of the unabsorbed gas into the space that has been deprived of
it and thus the absorption and the diflusion keep pace with each other
until all the absorbable air is removed from the gaseous mixture and
condensed or fixed in the absorbent.

In this manner a portion of the atmosphere enclosed in a large
glass vessel may be perfectly freed from watery vapor and carbonic
acid by a small fragment of caustic potash. A piece of phosphorus
will in a few hours absorb all its oxygen, and an ignited mass of the
rare metal titanium will remove its nitrogen.

A few words will now suffice to apply these facts to the absorption
of the nutritive gases by vegetation.

The cells of plants are permeable to gases, as is especially manifest
from what has been stated regarding the separation or evaporation of
gaseous water from leaves. They too, or some portions of their con-
tents, absorb or condense carbonic acid and ammonia in a similar way,
or at least with the same effect as potash absorbs carbonic acid. As
fast as these bodies are removed from the atmosphere surrounding or
occupying the cells, so fast they are re-supplied by diffusion from
without; so that although the quantities of gaseous plant-food con-
tained in the air are, relatively considered, very small, they are by
this grand natural law made to flow in continuous streams toward
every growing vegetable cell.

LECTURE III.

THE SOIL AS RELATED TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.

No agricultural plant flourishes naturally except its roots are sit-
uated inasoil. The soil is that upon which the farmer spends his
labor; the atmosphere, the weather, he cannot control. His art
enables him, however, so to modify and adapt the soil that all the
deficiencies of the atmosphere or the vicissitudes of climate cannot
deprive him of a reward for his exertions.

The soil has a two-fold function. In the first instance, it forms the
appropriate support and home of the plant, is its birthplace, the
station where it runs through all the stages of its development, and
the protection beneath which its roots or seeds survive the desolation
of winter to gladden every spring-time with renewed growth. In the
second place, it is the exclusive source of an indispensable part of the
food of all agricultural plants, and the medium through which another
larger share of their nutriment is accumulated and presented to them.

In nature we observe a vast variety of soils, which often differ as
much in their fertility as they do in their appearance. We find large
148 LECTURES ON

tracts of country covered with barren, drifting sands, on whose arid
bosom only a few stunted pines or shrivelled grasses find nourish-
ment. Again there occur in the highlands of Scotland, Bavaria,
Prussia, and other temperate countries, enormous stretches of moor-
land, bearing a nearly useless growth of heath or moss. In Southern
Russia occurs a vast tract, two hundred millions of acres in extent,
of the tschornosem, or black earth, which is remarkable for its extra-
ordinary and persistent fertility. The prairies of our own west, the
bottom lands of the Scioto and other rivers of Ohio, are other ex-
amples of peculiar soils; while on every farm, almost, may be found
numerous gradations from clay to sand, from vegetable mould to
gravel—gradations in color, consistence, composition, and produc-
tiveness.

Some consideration of the origin of soils is adapted to assist in
understanding the reasons of their fertility. Geological studies give
us reasons to believe that what is now soil was once, in chief part,
solid rock. We find in nearly all soils fragments of rock, recogniza-
ble as such by the eye, and by help of the microscope it is often easy
to perceive that those portions of the soil which are impalpable to
the feel are only minuter grains of the same rock.

We have space for only the merest general outline of what was
probably the original condition of the earth, and of the successive
changes that have wrought it to its present state. During the lapse
of the uncounted ages that have been forming our globe, rocks have
been ground to soil, and soil has been recemented into rock, and to-
day the same transformations are slowly and silently proceeding.
When the earth first cooled down from the primal heat, it had no
soil, in the proper sense of that word, but was a mass of crystalline
granitic rocks and volcanic scoriw, incapable of supporting vegeta-
tion. When the vapors condensed upon its surface, began that strife
between fire and water which, under the mild forms we call weather,
has never since ceased. Rains then began to fall upon the mountain
wrinkles produced by the contraction of the cooling crust. Streams
flowed downward into the valleys, cracking the still hot rock, whirling
fragments along in their courses until they settled as gravel, sand, or
finer powder to the bottom of some quiet sea, or were dissolved in
boiling wells. In later epochs vegetation began to flourish; then,
after slow centuries had passed, animal life was set in process; each
department of organized éxistence, in its own way, adding to the list
of changes. From the first the atmospheric oxygen was omnipresent,
and carbonic acid too, began to act upon the rocks; and as the result
of the solvent, decomposing, breaking-up, and commingling course of
operations, thus carried on through long periods of continual action,
we have the soil in its present characters and aspects.

The mechanical force of running water has been among the most
effective agencies in the pulverization of rocks. During what is
termed the diluvial or drift period, a current of water passed from
north to south over the northern portion of this continent, wearing
down the rocks, and bearing with it an enormous mass of solid matters,
which now remain as then deposited, constituting gravelly hills, and
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 149

soils which are filled with pebbles or boulders, that were then
rounded and polished in their transit from distant nothern latitudes.

Since the opening of the human epoch, lesser local floods in the
waters of rivers have made numberless so-called alluvial deposits
(river bottoms and deltas) in like manner.

Changes of temperature, especially the alternate freezing and thaw-
ing of water, exercise great influence in the pulverization of rocks.
Water, as is well known, expands with great force in the act of freez-
ing, and by insinuating itself while liquid into the fine cleavage rifts
of rocks, and there congealing, breaks asunder the particles. The
dense limestone of the Jura formation, as found in polished nodules
in the soil near Munich, in Bavaria, if moistened with water and ex-
posed to frost a single night is so disintegrated that, as the ice melts,
it yields a water turbid with the loosened atoms of rock.

Oxygen exerts a perpetual disintegrating effect, by uniting with
the protoxyd of iron, which occurs in nearly all rocks, setting free
the acids and bases before in combination with it, and yielding
peroxyd of iron. Sulphid (sulphuret) of iron is an exceedingly
abundant ingredient of rocks, and, under the influence of oxygen, is
readily converted into soluble sulphate of iron—a product which, in
turn, reacts upon other constituents of rocks to dissolve or alter them.
Carbonic acid, especially in conjunction with water, dissolves or com-
bines with the alkalies and earths existing in rocks, and thus destroys
their integrity and causes them to crumble away to soil.

The composition and chemical characters of soils depend upon the
kind of rock or rocks from which they originate. A glance at the
nature of these will therefore be of service tous. As to chemical
ingredients, we find that the most abundant and widely diffused are
precisely those which are found in the ash of plants. They mostly
occur in certain definite combinations, and form the minerals, quartz,
feldspar, hornblende, augite, mica, serpentine, kaolin, zeolite, carbo-
nate of lime, carbonate of magnesia, and numerous others of less im-
portance. ‘The composition of specimens of these minerals is given
in the annexed table. They occur, however, in very numerous varie-
ties, and vary greatly in the kind as well as proportions of their in-
eredients.* It is seen from the table that many of them contain
nearly all the inorganic ingredients of plants.

* This fact may appear to stand in contradiction to the statement above made that these
minerals are definite combinations. In the infancy of mineralogy great perplexity arose from
the numberless varieties of minerals that were found—varieties that agreed together in cer-
tain characteristics, but widely differed in others. In 1830, Mitscherlich, a Prussian phi-
losopher, discovered that a number of the elementary bodies are capable of replacing each
other in combination, from the fact of their natural crystalline form being identical; they
being, as he termed it, isomorphous, or of like shape. Thus, magnesia, lime, protoxyd of iron,
and protoxyd of manganese; potash, soda; silica, and alumina may replace each other in
such a way as to greatly affect the composition without altering the constitution of a
mineral. Of the mineral hornblende, for example, there are known a great number of
varieties ; some pure white in color, containing, in addition to silica, magnesia and lime ;
others pale green, a small portion of magnesia being replaced by protoxyd of iron; others
black, containing alumina in place of a portion of silica, and with oxides of iron and man-
ganese in large proportion. All these minerals, however, admit of one expression of their
constitution, for the amount of oxygen in the bases, no matter what they are, or what their
proportions, bears a constant relation to the oxygen of the silica (and alumina) they con-
tain, the ratio being 4: 9.

AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 151

These minerals, while they make up the chief bulk of rocks or of
the soil, are always associated with minute quantities of other com-
pounds, such as phosphates, chlorids, sulphates, or bodies yielding
sulphates, &c., upon which the geologist scarcely bestows attention,
which are, however, for the scientific agriculturist of great moment.

In consequence of this wise provision and of the beneficent inter-
mingling of the fragments of rock from widely distant regions, during
the drift period and by alluvial agencies, it has resulted that, almost
everywhere, there exist in the soil all those mineral bodies which are
found in plants. Some one has been, indeed, so impressed with the
universality of the distribution of each elementary form of matter as
to offer the opinion that all the sixty simple bodies which constitute
the globe might be found in every handful of soil or cup of water
existing on its surface did we but possess sufficiently delicate tests.

It sometimes happens, indeed, that where a soil is in place, i. e.,
has not been transported, but lies covering the rock from which it
has been formed, it is very poor and supports only a sparse vegeta-
tion, or, perhaps, is totally naked and destitute of all organic life.
But these instances are comparatively rare, and their infertility is
more often due to want of water, or some external cause, than to the
absolute deficiency of those ingredients which are needful in a pro-
ductive soil.

It often happens that a close connexion exists between the rock
and the overlying soil; as often, however, the one serves as no indi-
cation to the value of the other.

The mechanical analysis of any soil separates it into portions of
different fineness. A coarse sieve removes gravel, consisting of the
larger fragments of rock; a finer one, coarse sand; by washing with
water, fine sand is left, while the turbid washings deposit after a time
a quantity of impalpable matter which may consist in part of the
exceedingly fine particles of rock, and in part of clay, or it may be
entirely formed of the latter.

In most inferior soils the gravel and sand, when abundant, are an-
gular fragments of quartz, feldspar, hornblende, augite, and mica, or
of rocks consisting of these minerals. It is only these harder and
less easily decomposable minerals that can resist the pulverizing
agencies through which a large share of our soils have passed. In
the more fertile soils, formed from secondary limestones and slates,
the fragments of these stratified rocks occur as flattened pebbles and
rounded grains.

The fine portion of the soil bears, either in quantity or composition,
the most direct relation to its fertility. It is this which is capable of
yielding to the growing plant the food it requires. The coarser parts
of the soil are a vast store of materials in reserve for the distant fu-
ture, since, by their slow disintegration, they themselves gradually
become so comminuted as to serve the wants of vegetation.

Clay, which is almost invariably a chief part of the impalpable
matter of the soil, has been marked by us asa mineral, and its general
composition indicated in the table (p. 150.) It is a product of the
action of water and carbonic acid upon such minerals as feldspar,
mica, hornblende, and augite. Under the influence of these agents,
152 LECTURES ON

the silicates of alumina and potash, lime, &c., yield carbonates of
potash, lime, &c., which dissolve and wash away, while a silicate of
alumina and water, mingled with free silica, and mechanically retain-
ing more or less of the other substances remains, and this is clay.

When formed from feldspar alone it is often pure white in color, |
and bears the name kaolin. This, the purest form of clay, is the
material which constitutes the basis of porcelain. In mines, excavated
through feldspathic rocks, nothing is more common than to find masses
of the whitest kaolin in the fissures or cavities, which give a down-
ward passage to the percolating water. The clay of ordinary soils,
is, however, a material greatly admixed with other substances, and
therefore exceedingly different and variable in its composition, and
all the better adapted by this for its agricultural applications.

Many soils contain much carbonate of lime in an impalpable form,
having been derived chiefly from the mechanical wearing down of
lime rocks, as marble and chalk—from the shells of mollusks or coral
branches, or, finally, being clays that have originated by the chemi-
cal decomposition of feldspathic rocks containing much lime.

Organic matter, especially the debris of former vegetation, is
almost never absent from the impalpable portion of the soil, existing
there in some of the many forms assumed by the Protean humus.

From consideration of the relative proportions of the principal me-
chanical ingredients has chiefly arisen the customary classification and
nomenclature of soils. Silicious sand (grains of quartz, feldspar, &c.)
and clay make up the chief proportion of many soils. The mixture
of the two forms a loam which may be sandy (light) or clayey (heavy.)
A further division is into loamy sand and loamy clay. When, in ad-
dition to these, lime is present the soil is said to be a marl, either
sandy, clayey, loamy, &c., according to the relative quantities of the
ingredients.

Soils containing organic matter to the amount of 5 to 10 per cent.
are termed vegetable moulds; if this ingredient exceeds 10 per cent.,
which rarely occurs, except in wet situations, we have a peaty soil.

If coarse rounded fragments of rock be present in large quantity
the soil is gravelly. Where much oxyd of iron exists, as evinced by
a red or yellow color, the soil is ochery. The epithets peaty, gravelly,
ochery, come then, in many cases, to further modify the designations
of sands, clays, marls, and moulds. '

Other divisions are current among practical men, as, for example,
surface and sub-soil, active and inert soil, tilth, and hard pan. These
terms mostly explain themselves. When, at the depth of four inches
to one foot or more, the soil assumes a different color and texture,
these distinctions have meaning. The surface soil, active soil, or
tilth, is the portion that is wrought by the instruments of tillage—
that which is moistened by the rains, warmed by the sun, permeated
by the atmosphere, in which the plant extends its roots, gathers its
soil food, and which, by the decay of the subterranean organs of
vegetation, acquires a content of humus. Where the soil originally
had the same characters to a great depth, it often becomes modified
down to a certain point, by the agencies just enumerated, in such a
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 153

manner that the eye at once makes the distinction into surface-soil and
sub-soil. In many soils, however, such distinctions are entirely ar-
bitrary, the earth changing its appearance gradually or even remain-
ing uniform to a considerable depth.

Again, the surface soil may have a greater downward extent than
the active soil, or the tilth may extend into the sub-soil.

Hard-pan is the appropriate name of a dense, almost impenetra-
ble, crust or stratum of ochery clay or compacted gravel, often under-
lying a fairly fruitful soil. It is the soil reverting torock. The parti-
cles once disjointed are being cemented together again by the solu-
tions of lime, iron or alkali-silicates that descend from the surface soil.
Such a stratum often separates the surface soil from a deep gravel
bed, and peat swamps thus exist in basins formed on the most porous
soils by a thin layer of moor-bed-pan.

With these general notions regarding the origin and characters of
soils, we may proceed to a somewhat extended notice of the pro-
perties of the soil as influencing fertility. These divide themselves
into physical characters—those which externally affect the growth
of the plant; and chemical characters—those which provide it with
food.

Among the physical characters* we first notice the state of division
in which the soil is found.

On the surface of a block of granite only a few lichens and mosses
can exist; crush the block to a coarse powder and a more abundant
vegetation can be supported on it; if it is reduced to a very fine dust
and duly watered, even the cereal grains will grow and perfect fruit
on it. Thus two soils may have the same chemical composition, and
yet one be almost inexhaustibly fertile, and the other almost hope-
lessly barren. There are sandy soils in the Eastern States, which,
without manure, yield only the most meagre crops of rye or buck-
wheat; and there are sandy soils in Ohio, which, without manure,
yield on an average 80 bushels of Indian corn per acre, and have
yielded this for twenty to fifty years in unbroken succession. Ac-
cording to David A. Wells, (American Journal of Science, July,
1852,) these two kinds of soil yield very similar, practically identical,
results on chemical analysis, so far as their inorganic ingredients are
concerned. What is the cause of the difference of fertility? Our
present knowledge can point to no other éxplanation than is furnished
by the different fineness of the particles. The barren sandy soils
consist in great part of coarse grains, while the Ohio soil is an ex-
ceedingly fine powder.

It is true, as a general rule, that all fertile soils contain a large
proportion of very fine or impalpable matter. How the extreme
division of the particles of the soil is connected with its fertility is
not difficult to understand. The food of the plant must enter it in
a state of solution, or if undissolved, the particles must be smaller

In treating of the physical characters of the soil, the writer employs an essay on this
subject, contributed by him to vol. XVI of the Transactions of the N. Y. State Agricul-
tural Society.
154 © LECTURES ON

than we can discover with the best optical aids, because the pores of
the roots of plants are not discernible by any microscope. The
mineral matters of the soil must be dissolved or diffused in water.
The rapidity of their solution is in direct proportion to the extent of
their surface. The finer the particles, the more abundantly will the
plant be supplied with its necessary nourishment. In the Scioto
valley soils the water which is transpired by the crops comes in con-
tact with such an extent of surface that it is able to dissolve the soil-
ingredients in as large quantity and as rapidly as the crop requires.
In the coarse-grained soils this is not the case. Soluble matters
(manures) must be applied to them by the farmer, or his crops refuse
to yield handsomely.

It is furthermore obvious, that, other things being equal, the
finer the particles of the soil the more space the growing roots have
in which to expand themselves, and the more numerously are they
able to present their absorbent surfaces to the supplies which the
soil contains.

It will presently appear that other very important properties of the
soil are more or less related to its state of mechanical division.

The soil has, secondly, a power of withdrawing from the air vapor of
water and condensing the same in rts pores. It is, in other words,
hygroscopic.

This property of a soil is of the utmost agricultural importance,
because, 1st, it is connected with the permanent moisture which is
necessary to vegetable existence, and, 2d, since the absorption of
water-vapor determines the absorption of other vapors and gases.

In the following table from Schiibler we have the results of a
series of experiments carried out by that philosopher for the pur-
pose of determining the absorptive power of different kinds of earths
and soils.

The column of figures gives in thousandths the quantity of moisture
absorbed by the previously dried soil, under the same circumstances,
in twenty-four hours:

An obvious practical result follows from the facts expressed in the
above table, viz: that sandy soils which have little attractive force
for watery vapor, and are therefore dry and arid, may be meliorated
in this respect by admixture with clay, or better with humus, as
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 155

is done by green manuring. The table gives us proof that gypsum
does not exert any beneficial action in consequence of directly attract-
ing moisture. Humus, or decaying vegetable matter, it will be seen,
surpasses every other ingredient of the soil in absorbing moisture.
This is doubtless in some degree connected with its extraordinary
porosity or amount of surface. How the extent of surface alone may
act is made evident by comparing the absorbent power of carbonate
of lime in the two states of sand and of an impalpable powder. The
latter it is seen, absorbed twelve times as much vapor of water as
the former. Carbonate of magnesia stands next to humus, and it is
worthy of note that it is a very light and fine powder.

Finally, it is a matter of observation that ‘‘silica and lime in the
form of coarse sand make the soil in which they predominate so
dry and hot that vegetation perishes from want of moisture; when,
however, they occur as fine dust, they form too wet a soil, in which
plants perish from the opposite cause.’’—(Hamm’s Landwirthschaft.)

In the fact that soils have a physical absorbing power for the vapor
of water, we have an illustration of a general principle, viz: That the
surfaces of liquid and solid matter attract the particles of other kinds of
matter. In the same way that water is absorbed, oxygen gas is con-
densed, especially in certain highly porous bodies. Platinum, copper,
lead, and iron, when in the state of fine sponge, exert a remarkable
condensing power on oxygen, and it is probable that thereby this
element is ozonized. Platinum sponge exhibits the characters of a
body charged with ozone, and it is to be anticipated that investiga-
tion will shortly demonstrate the occurrence of gaseous condensa-
tions in the soil, the effect of which is to produce chemical changes
of the most important character. It is not unlikely that the organic
matters of the soil, which possess the extremest porosity may thereby
acquire their power of ozonizing the oxygen which combines so
readily with them, and thus accomplish the formation of nitric acid
from atmospheric nitrogen.

Of exceeding influence on the fertility of the soil is, thirdly, its
permeability to iquid water.

A soilis permeable to water when it allows that liquid to soak into
or run through it. To be permeable is of course to be porous. On
the size of the pores depends its degree of permeability. Coarse
sands, and soils which have few but large pores or interspaces, allow
water to run through them readily—water percolates them. When,
instead of running through, the water is largely absorbed and held
by the soil, the latter is said to possess great capillary power; such a
soil has many and minute pores. The cause of capillarity is the same
surface attraction which has been already mentioned.

When a narrow vial is partly filled with water, it will be seen that
the liquid adheres to its sides, and if it be not more than one-half
inch in diameter, the surface of the liquid will be curved or concave.
In a very narrow tube the liquid will rise to a considerable height.
In these cases the surface attraction of the glass for the water neu-
tralizes or overcomes the weight of (earth’s attraction for) the latter.

The pores of a sponge raise and hold water in them, in the same

156 LECTURES ON

way that these narrow (capillary*) tubes support it. When a body has
pores so fine (surfaces so near each other) that their surface attrac-
tion is greater than the gravitating tendency of water, then the body
will suck up and hold water—will exhibit capillarity; a lump of salt or
sugar, a lamp-wick, are familiar examples. When the pores of a
body are so large (the surfaces so distant) that they cannot fill them-
selves or keep themselves full, the body allows the water to run
through or to percolate.

Sand is most easily permeable to water, and to a higher degree
the coarser its particles. Clay, on the other hand, is the least pene-
trable, and the less so the purer and more plastic it is.

When a soil is too coarsely porous it is said to be leachy or
hungry. The rains that fall upon it quickly soak through, and it
shortly becomes dry. On such a soil, the manures that may be ap-
plied in the spring are to some degree washed down below the
reach of vegetation, and in the droughts of summer plants suffer and
perish from want of moisture.

When the texture of a soil is too fine, its pores too small, as happens
in a heavy clay, the rains penetrate it too slowly; they flow off the
surface, if the latter be inclined, or remain as pools for days and even
weeks in the hollows. Ina soil of proper texture the rains neither
soak off into the under earth nor stagnate on the surface, but the soil
always (except in excessive wet or drought) maintains the moistness
which is salutary to most of our cultivated plants.

The part which the capillarity of the soil plays in the nutrition of
the plant deserves a moment’s notice.

Ifa wick be put into a lamp containing oil, the oil, by capillary
action, gradually permeates its whole length, that which is above as
well as that below the surface of the liquid. When the lamp is set
burning, the oil at the flame is consumed, and as each particle disap-
pears its place is supplied by a new one, until the lamp is empty or
the flame extinquished.

Something quite analogous occurs in the soil, by which the plant
(corresponding to the flame in our illustration) is fed. The soil is at
once lamp and wick, and the water of the soil represents the oil. Let
evaporation of water from the surface of the soil or of the plant take
place of the combustion of the oil from a wick and the matter stands
thus: Let us suppose dew or rain to have saturated the ground with
moisture for some depth. On recurrence of a dry atmosphere with
sunshine and wind, the surface of the soil rapidly dries; but as each
particle of water escapes (by evaporation) into the atmosphere, its
place is supplied (by capillarity) from the stores below. The ascending
water brings along with it the soluble matters of the soil, and thus the
roots of plants are situated in a stream of their appropriate food. The
movement proceeds in this way so long as the surface is dryer than
the deeper soil. When, by rain or otherwise, the surface is saturated,
it is like letting a thin stream of oil run upon the apex of the lamp-

wick—no more evaporation into the air can occur, and consequently
there is no longer any ascent of water; on the contrary, the water, by
its own weight, penetrates the soil, and if the underlying ground be
not saturated with moisture, as can happen where the subterranean
fountains yield a meagre supply, then capillarity will aid gravity in
its downward distribution.

The most rational conclusion from all the facts at our command is
that all the mineral matters, as well as a portion of the organic bodies,
which feed the plant, are carried into it by water. So long as evapora-
tion goes on from the surface of the soil, so long there is a constant
upward flow of saline matters. Those portions which do not enter
vegetation accumulate on or near the surface of the ground; when a
rain falls, they are washed down again to a certain depth, and thus
are kept constantly changing their place with the water, which is the
vehicle of their distribution. In regions where rain falls periodically
or not at all, this upward flow of the soil-water often causes an accumu-
lation of salts on the surface of the ground. Thus in Bengal many
soils which in the wet season produce the most luxuriant crops, during
the rainless portion of the year become covered with white crusts of
saltpetre. Doubtless the beds of nitrate of soda that are found in
Peru have accumulated in the same manner. So in our western caves
the earth sheltered from rains is saturated with salts—epsom salts,
glauber salts, and saltpetre, or mixtures of these. Often the rich
soil of gardens is slightly incrusted in this manner in our summer
weather; but the saline matters are carried into the soil with the
next rain.

It is easy to see how, in a good soil, capillarity thus.acts in keeping
the roots of plants constantly immersed in a stream of water or moist-
ure that is now ascending, now descending, but never at rest, and
how the food of the plant is thus made to circulate around the organs
fitted for absorbing it.

The same causes that maintain this perpetual supply of water and
food to the plant are also efficacious in constantly preparing new sup-
plies of food. As before explained, the materials of the soil are always
undergoing decomposition, whereby the silica, lime, phosphoric acid,
potash, &c., of the insoluble fragments of rock, become soluble in
water and accessible to the plant. Water charged with carbonic acid
and oxygen, is the chief agent in these chemical changes. The more
extensive and rapid the circulation of water in the soil, the more
matters will be rendered soluble in a given time, and, other things
being equal, the less will the soil be dependent on manures to keep
up its fertility.

No matter how favorable the structure of the soil may be to the
circulation of water in it, no continuous upward movement can take
place without evaporation. The ease and rapidity of evaporation,
while mainly depending on the condition of the atmosphere and on
the sun’s heat, are to a certain degree influenced by the soil itself.
We have already seen that the soil possesses a power of absorbing
watery vapor from the atmosphere, a power which is related both to
158 LECTURES ON

the kind of material that forms the soil and to its state of division.
This absorptive power opposes evaporation. Again, different soils
manifest widely different capacities for imbibing liquid water—capa-
cities mainly connected with their porosity. Obviously too, the
quantity of liquid in a given volume of soil affects not only the
rapidity, but also the duration of evaporation. bea

The following tables by Schiibler illustrate the peculiarities of dif-
ferent soils in these respects. The first column gives the per cents of
water absorbed by the completely dry soil. In these experiments the
soils were thoroughly wet with water, the excess allowed to drip off,
and the increase of weight determined. In the second column are
given the per cents of water that evaporated during the space of one
hour from the saturated soil spread over a given surface:

It is obvious that these two columns express nearly the same thing
in different ways. The amount of water retained increases from quartz
sand to magnesia. The rapidity of drying in the air, diminishes in the
same direction.

The want of retentive power for water in the case of coarse sand is
undeniably one of the chief reasons of its unfruitfulness. The best
soils possess a medium retentive power. In them, therefore, are best
united the conditions for the regular distribution of the soil-water under
all circumstances. In them this process is not hindered too much either
by wet or dry weather. The retaining power of humus is seen to be
more than double that of clay. This result might appear at first sight
to be in contradiction to ordinary observations, for we are accustomed
to see water standing on the surface of clay but not on humus. It
must be borne in mind that clay, from its imperviousness, holds water
like a vessel, the water remaining apparent; but humus retains it
invisibly, its action being nearly like that of a sponge.

One chief cause of the value of a layer of humus on the surface of
the soil doubtless consists in this great retaining power for water, and
the success that has attended the practice of green manuring, as a
means of renovating almost worthless shifting sands, is in a great
degree to be attributed to this cause. The advantages of mulching
are explained in the same way.
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 159

The relations of the soil to heat are of the utmost importance in
affecting its fertility. The distribution of plants in general, is deter-
mined by differences of mean temperature. In the same climate and
locality, however, we find the farmer distinguishing between cold
and warm soils.

The temperature of the soil varies to a certain depth with that of
the air; yet its changes occur more slowly, are confined to a narrower
range of temperature, and diminish downward in rapidity and amount,
until at a certain depth a point is reached where the temperature is
invariable.

In summer the temperature of the soil is higher in day time than
that of the air; at night the temperature of the surface rapidly falls,
especially when the sky is clear.

In temperate climates, at a depth of three feet, the temperature
remains unchanged from day to night; at a depth of 20 feet the an-
nual temperature varies but a degree or two; at 75 feet below the
surface, the thermometer remains perfectly stationary. In the vaults
of the Paris Observatory, 80 feet deep, the temperature is 50° Fah-
renheit. In tropical regions the point of nearly unvarying tempera-
ture is reached at a depth of one foot.

The mean annual temperature of the soil is the same as, or in higher
latitudes a degree above, that of the air. The nature and position
of the soil must considerably influence its temperature.

The sources of that heat which is found in the soil are two, viz:
first, an internal one, the chemical process of oxydation or decay;
second, an external one, the rays of the sun.

The heat evolved by the decay of organic matters is not inconsid-
erable in porous soils containing much vegetable remains; but this
decay cannot proceed rapidly until the external temperature has
reached a point favorable to vegetation, and therefore this source of
heat probably has no appreciable effect one way or the other on the
welfare of the plant. The warmth of the soil, so far as it favors ve-
getable growth, appears then to depend exclusively on the heat of
the sun.

The earth has within itself a source of heat, which maintains its
interior at a high temperature; but which escapes so rapidly from the
surface that the soil would be constantly frozen but for the external
supply of heat from the sun.

The direct rays of the sun are the immediate cause of the warmth of
the earth’s surface. The temperature of the soil near the surface
changes progressively with the season; but at a certain depth the
loss from the interior and the gain from the sun compensate each
other, and, as has been previously mentioned, the temperature remains
unchanged throughout the year.

During a summer day the heat of the sun reaches the earth
directly, and it is absorbed by the soil and the solid objects on its
surface, and also by the air and water. But these different bodies,
and also the different kinds of soil, have very different ability to ab-
sorb or become warmed by the sun’s heat. Air and water are almost
incapable of being warmed by heat applied above them. Through
160 LECTURES ON

the air especially, heat radiates without being scarcely absorbed.
The soil and solid bodies become warmed according to their individ-
ual capacity, and from them the air receives the heat which warms
it. Ftom the moist surface of the soil goes on a rapid evaporation,
which renders latent* a large amount of heat, so that the tempera-
ture of the soil is not rapidly but gradually elevated. The ascent of
water from the sub-soil to supply the place of that evaporated goes
on as before described. The liquid water of the soil has combined
with (rendered latent) a vast amount of heat therefrom, and passed as
gaseous water (vapor) into the air. Whenthe sun declines, the process
diminishes in intensity, and when it sets, the reverse takes place.
The heat that had accumulated on the surface of the earth radiates
into the cooler atmosphere and planetary space, the temperature of
the surface rapidly diminishes, and the air itself becomes cooler by
convection.t As the cooling goes on, the vapor suspended in the at-
mosphere begins to condense upon cool objects, while its latent heat
becoming free hinders the too sudden reduction of temperature. The
condensed water collects in drops—it is dew; or in the colder seasons
it crystallizes as hoar-frost.

The special nature of the surface of the soil is closely connected
with the maintenance of a uniform temperature, with the prevention

% When a piece of ice is placed in a vessel whose temperature is increasing, by means of
a lamp, at the rate of one degree of the thermometer every minute, it will be found that
the temperature of the ice rises until it attains 32°. When this point is reached, it be-
gins to melt, but does not suddenly become fluid: the melting goes on very gradually. A
thermometer placed in the water remains constantly at 32° so long as a fragment of ice
is present. ‘The moment the ice disappears, the temperature begins to rise again, at
the rate of one degree per minute. The time during which the temperature of the ice
and water remains at 32° is 140 minutes. During each of these minutes one degree of
heat enters the mixture, but is not indicated by the thermometer—the mercury remains
stationary; 140° of heat have thus passed into the ice and become hidden, Jatent; at the same
time the solid ice has become liquid water. The difference, then, between ice and water
consists in the heat that is latent in the latter. If we now proceed with the above experi-
ment, allowing the heat to increase with the same rapidity, we find that the temperature
of the water rises constantly for 180 minutes. The thermometer then indicates a temper-
ature of 212, (32-+180,) and the water boils. Proceeding with the experiment, the water
evaporates away, but the thermometer continues stationary so long as any liquid remains.
After the lapse of 972 minutes, it is completely evaporated. Water in becoming steam
renders, therefore, still another portion, 972°, of heat latent. The heat latent in steam is
indispensable to the existence of the latter. If this heat be removed by bringing the
steam into a cold space, water is reproduced. If, by means of pressure or cold, steam be
condensed, the heat originally latent in it becomes sensible, free, and capable of affecting
the thermometer. If, also, water be converted into ice, as much heat is evolved and made
sensible as was absorbed and made latent. It is seen thus that the processes of liquefac-
tion and vaporization are cooling processes; for the heat rendered latent by them must be
derived from surrounding objects, and thus these become cooled. On the contrary, solidi-
fication, freezing, and vapor-condensation are warming processes, since in them large quan-
tities of heat cease to be latent and are made sensible, thus warming surrounding bodies.

+ Though liquids and gases are almost perfect non-conductors of heat, yet it can diffuse
through them rapidly, if advantage be taken of the fact that by heating they expand and
therefore become specifically lighter. If heat be applied to the upper surface of liquids or
gases, they remain for a long time nearly unaffected; if it be applied beneath them, the lower
layers of particles become heated and rise, their place is supplied by others, and so currents
upward and downward are established, whereby the heat is rapidly and uniformly distrib-
uted. This process of convection can rarely have any influence in the soil. What we have
stated concerning it shows, however, in what way the atmosphere may constantly act in
removing heat from the surface of the soil.
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY, 161

of too great heat by day and cold by night, and with the watering or
vegetation by means of dew. It is, however, in many cases only for
a little space after seed-time that the soil is greatly concerned in
these processes. So soon as it becomes covered with vegetation the
character of the latter determines to a certain degree the nature of
the atmospheric changes. In case of many crops the soil is but par-
tially covered, and its peculiarities are then of direct influence on the
vegetation it bears. Among these qualities the following may be
noticed: ,

1. The color of the soil.—It is usually stated that black or dark co-
lored soils are sooner warmed by the sun’s rays than those of lighter
color, and remain constantly of a higher temperature so long as the
sun acts on them. An elevation of several degrees in the tempera-
ture of a light colored soil may be caused by strewing its surface
with peat, charcoal powder, or vegetable mould. To this influence may
be partly ascribed the following facts. Lampadius was able to ripen
melons even in the coolest summers in Friberg, Saxony, by strewing
a coating of coal dust an inch deep over the surface of the soil. In
Belgium and on the Rhine, it is found that the grape matures best
when the soil is covered with fragments of black clay slate. Girar-
din found in a series of experiments on the cultivation of potatoes,
that the time of their ripening varied eight to fourteen days, accord-
ing to the color of the soil. He found on August 25th, in a very dark
humus soil, twenty-six varieties ripe; in sandy soil, twenty; in clay,
nineteen; and in white lime soil, only sixteen. It is not difficult to
assign other causes that will account in part for the results here men-
tioned; and although it has been observed that dark soils range from
three to eight degrees higher in temperature than contiguous soils
having a lighter color, it is not to color so much as to other qualities
that the soil owes its peculiar temperature, as is proved by the recent
observations of Malaguti and Durocher. They found that the tem-
perature of a garden soil, just below the surface, was on the average
6° Fahrenheit higher than that of the air, but that this higher tem-
perature diminished at a greater depth.. A thermometer buried four
inches indicated a mean temperature only 3° above that of the atmos-
phere. Besides the garden earth, just mentioned, which had a dark
gray color, and was a mixture of sand and gravel containing but little
clay, with about five per cent. humus, the thermometric characters
of the following soils were observed, viz: a grayish-white quartz
sand; a grayish-brown granite sand; a fine light-gray clay (pipe clay;)
a yellow sandy clay; and, finally, four lime soils of different physical
qualities.

It was found that when the exposure was alike, the dark-gray
granite sand became the warmest, and next to this the grayish-white
quartz sand. ‘The latter, notwithstanding its lighter color, often ac-
quired a higher temperature when at a depth of four inches than the
former, a fact to be ascribed to its better conducting power. The
black soils never became so warm as the two just mentioned, demon-
strating that color does not influence the absorption of heat so much
as other qualities. After the black soils, the others came in the fol-

va
162 LECTURES ON

lowing order: Garden soil; yellow sandy clay; pipe clay; lime soils
having crystalline grains; and, lastly, a pulverulent chalk soil.

To show what different degrees of warmth soils may acquire, under
the same circumstances, the following maximum temperatures may be
adduced: At noon of a July day, when the temperature of the air
was 90°, a thermometer placed at a depth of a little more than one
inch, gave these results: .

Here we observe a difference of nearly 40° in the temperature of
the coarse quartz and the chalk soil. The experimenters do not men-
tion the influence of water in affecting these results; they do not state
the degree of dryness of these soils. It will be seen, however, that
‘the warmest soils are those that retain least water, and doubtless
something of the slowness with which the fine soils increase in warmth
is connected with the fact that they retain much water, which, in
evaporating, appropriates and renders latent a large quantity of heat.

The chalk soil is seen to be the coolest of all, its temperature in
these observations being three degrees lower than that of the atmos-
phere at noon day. In hot climates this coolness is sometimes of great
advantage as appears to happen in Spain, near Cadiz, where the
Sherry vineyards flourish. ‘‘The Don said the Sherry wine district
was very small, not more than twelve miles square. The sherry grape
grew only on certain low chalky hills where the earth being light-
colored, is not so much burnt; did not chap and split so much by the
sun as darker and heavier soils do. A mile beyond these hills the
grape deteriorates.’’ —(Dickens’ Household Words, November 13, 1858.)

In explanation of these observations we must recall to mind the fact
that all bodies are capable of absorbing and radiating as well as
reflecting heat. These properties, although never disassociated from
color, are not necessarily dependent upon it. They chiefly depend
upon the character of the surface of bodies. Smooth polished sur-
faces absorb and radiate heat least readily ; they reflect it most per-
fectly. Radiation and absorption are opposed to each other, and the
power of any body to radiate is precisely equal to its faculty of absorb-
ing heat. It must be understood, however, that bodies may differ in
their power of absorbing or radiating heat of different degrees of intensity.
Lampblack absorbs and radiates heat of all intensities in the same
degree. White lead absorbs heat of low intensity (such as radiates
from a vessel filled with boiling water) as fully as lampblack, but of
the intense heat of a lamp it absorbs only about one-half as much.
Snow seems to resemble white-lead in this respect. If a black cloth
or black paper be spread on the surface of snow, upon which thé sun
is shining, it will melt much faster under the cloth than elsewhere,
and this too if the cloth be not in contact with, but suspended above
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 163

the snow. In our latitude every one has had opportunity to observe
that snow thaws most rapidly when covered by or lying on black
earth. The reason is that snow absorbs heat of low intensity with
greatest facility. The heat of the sun is converted from a high to a
low intensity by being absorbed and then radiated by the black mate-
rial. But it is not color that deteymines this difference of absorptive
Power, for indigo and Prussian blife, though of nearly the same color,
have very different absorptive powers. So far, however, as our
observations extend, it appears that usually, dark colored soils absorb
heat most rapidly, and that the sun’s rays have least effect on light
colored soils.

2. The degree of moisture present is of great influence on the tem-
perature of the soil. All soils when thoroughly wet seem to be nearly
alike in their power of absorbing and retaining warmth. The vast
quantity of heat needful to gratify the demand of the vapor that is
constantly forming, explains this. From this cause the difference in
temperature between dry and wet soil may often amount from 10° to 18°.
According to the observation of Dickinson, made at Abbot’s Hill,
Hertfordshire, England, and continued through eight years, 90 per
cent. of the water falling between April Ist and October Ist, evapo-
rates from the surface of the soil, only 10 per cent. finding its way into
drains laid three and four feet deep. The total quantity of water that
fell during this time, amounted to about 2,900,000 lbs. per acre; of
this more than 2,600,000 evaporated from the surface. It has been
calculated that to evaporate-artificially this enormous mass of water,
more than seventy-five tons of coal must be consumed.

Thorough draining, by loosening the soil and causing a rapid re-
moval from below of the surplus water, has a most decided influence,
especially in spring time, in warming the soil and bringing it into a
suitable condition for the support of vegetation.

It is plain then that even if we knew with accuracy what are the
physical characters of a surface soil, and if we were able to estimate
correctly the influence of these characters on its fertility, still we must
investigate those circumstances which affect its wetness or dryness,
whether they be an impervious sub-soil, or springs coming to the sur-
face, or the amount and frequency of rain-falls, taken in connexion
with other meteorological causes. We cannot decide that a clay is
too wet or a sand too dry, until we know its situation and the climate
it is subjected to.

The great deserts of the globe do not owe their barrenness to neces-
sary poverty of soil, but to meteorological influences—to the continued
prevalence of parching winds, and the absence of mountains to con-
dense the atmospheric water and establish a system of rivers and
streams. This is not the place to enter into a discussion of the causes
that may determine or modify climate, but to illustrate the effect that
may be produced by means within human control, it may be stated that
previous to the year 1821, the French district Provence was a fertile
and well-watered region. In 1822, the olive trees which were largely
cultivated there were injured by frost, and the inhabitants began to
cut them up root and branch. This amounted to clearing off a forest,
164 LECTURES ON

and in consequence the streams dried up, and the productiveness of
the country was seriously diminished.

3. The angle at which the sun’s rays strike a soil is of great influence
on its temperature. The more this approaches a right angle the
greater the heating effect. In the latitude of England the sun’s heat
acts most powerfully on surfaces having a southern exposure, and
which are inclined at an angle of @6° and 30°. The best vineyards
of the Rhine and Neckar are also on hill-sides, so situated. In Lap-
land and Spitzbergen the southern side of hills are often seen covered
with vegetation, while lasting or even perpetual snow lies on their
northern inclinations.

4. The influence of a wall or other reflecting surface upon the warmth
of a soil lying to the south of. it, was observed in the case of garden
soil by Malaguti and Durocher. The highest temperature indicated
by a thermometer placed in this soil at a distance of six inches from
the wall, during a series of observations lasting seven days, (April,
1852,) was 32° Fahrenheit higher at the surface, and 18° higher at a
depth of four inches than in the same soil on the north side of the
wall. The average temperature of the former during this time was
8° higher than that of the latter.

In the Rhine district grape vines are kept low and as near the soil
as possible, so that the heat of the sun be reflected back upon them
from the ground, and the ripening is then carried through the nights
by the heat radiated from the earth.—(Jowrnal Highland and Agricul-
tural Society, July 1858, p. 347.)

5. Malaguti and Durocher also studied the effect of a sod on the
temperature of the soil. They observed that it hindered the warm-
ing of the soil, and indeed to about the same extent as a layer of earth
of three inches depth. Thusa thermometer four inches deep in green-
sward acquires the same temperature as one seven inches deep in the
same soil not grassed.

It is to be remembered that the soils that warm most quickly, also
cool correspondingly fast, and thus are subjected to the most exten-
sive and rapid changes of temperature. The greensward which
warms slowly, retains its warmth most tenaciously, and the sands that
become hottest at noon-day, are coldest at midnight.

Of no little practical importance is the shrinking of soils on drying.—
This shrinking is of course offset by an increase of bulk when the
soil becomes wet. In variable weather we have therefore constant
changes of volume occurring. Soils rich in humus experience these
changes to the greatest degree. The surfaces of moors often rise and
fall with the wet or dry season, through a space of several inches.
In ordinary light soils containing but little humus no change of bulk
is evident. Otherwise, it is in clay soils that shrinking is most per-
ceptible; since these soils only dry superficially they do not appear
to settle much, but become full of cracks and rifts. Heavy clays may
lose one-tenth or more of their volume on drying, and since at the
same time they harden about the rootlets which are imbedded in them,
it is plain that these indispensable organs of the plant must thereby

e ruptured during the protracted dry weather. Sand, on the other

hand, does not change its bulk by wetting or drying, and when present
to a considerable extent in the soil, its particles being interposed be-
tween those of the clay, prevent the adhesion of the latter, so that,
although a sandy loam shrinks not inconsiderably on drying, yet the
lines of separation are vastly more numerous and less wide than in
purer clays. Such a soil does not ‘‘cake,’’ but remains friable and
powdery.

Marly soils (containing carbonate of lime) are especially prone to
fall to a fine powder during drying, since the carbonate of lime, which
like sand, shrinks very little, is itself in a state of extreme division,
and therefore more effectually separates the clayey particles. The
unequal shrinking of these two intimately mixed ingredients accom-
plishes a perfect pulverization of such soils. Professor Wolff, of the
Academy of Agriculture, at Hohenheim, Wirtemberg, states that on
the cold heavy soils of Upper Lusatia, in Germany, the application
of lime has been attended with excellent results, and he thinks that
the larger share of the benefit is to be accounted for by the improve-
ment in the texture of those soils which follows liming. The car-
bonate of lime is considerably soluble in water charged with carbonic
acid, as is the water of a soil containing vegetable matter, and this
agency of distribution in connection with the mechanical operations
of tillage, must in a short time effect an intimate mixture of the lime
with the whole soil. A tenacious clay is thus by a heavy liming
made to approach the condition of a friable marl.

We may give a moment’s notice to the cohesiveness of the soil.—
A soil is said to be heavy or light, not as it weighs more or less, but
as it is easy or diflicult to work. The state of dryness has great influ-
ence on this quality. Sand, lime, and humus have very little cohesion
when dry, but considerable when wet. Soils in which they pre-
dominate are usually easy to work. But clay has entirely different
characters, and upon them almost exclusively depends the tenacity
of a soil. Dry clay, when powdered, has hardly more consist-
ence than sand, but when thoroughly moistened its particles adhere
together to a soft and plastic, but tenacious mass; and in drying
away, at a certain point it becomes very hard, and requires a good
deal of force to penetrate it. In this condition it offers great resist-
ance to the instruments used in tillage, and when thrown up by the
plough it forms lumps which require repeated harrowings to break
them down. Since the cohesiveness of the soil depends so greatly
upon the quantity of water contained in it, it follows that thorough
draining, combined with deep tillage, whereby sooner or later the
stiffest clays become readily permeable to water, must have the best
effects in making such soils easy to work.

The English practice of burning clays speedily accomplishes the
same purpose. When clay is burned and then crushed the particles
no longer adhere tenaciously together on moistening, and the mass
does not acquire again the unctuous plasticity peculiar to unburned
. Clay.

Mixing sand with clay, or incorporating vegetable matter with it,
166 LECTURES ON
serves to separate the particles from each other, and thus remedies
too great cohesiveness.

When water freezes its volume increases, as 1s well known. The
alternate freezing and thawing of the water which impregnates the
soil during the colder part of the year plays thus an important part
in overcoming its cohesion. The. effect is mostly apparent in the
spring, immediately after ‘‘the frost leaves the ground,’’ but is
usually not durable, the soil recovering its former consistence by the
operations of tillage. Fall-ploughing of stiff soils has been recom-
mended, in order to expose them to the disintegrating effects of
frost.

In turning now to the chemical characters of the soil, we have
first to notice its composition. It being understood that the soil is
the exclusive source of mineral food to the plant, we of course expect
to find all the ingredients of the ash of plants in every soil that is
able to maintain vegetation. Great differences however, are found
to exist in the proportions, and especially in the condition as regards
solubility of these matters, as seen from the following analyses:

In fertile soils there is always to be found a quantity of fixed min-
eral as well as organic matters that are soluble in pure water. In
the wheat soil this quantity amounted to but three parts in 1,000, and
in this Dr. Anderson found no phosphoric acid and no oxyd of iron,
although all the other mineral ingredients of plants were present.
In the sterile soil nothing weighable, when, as was the case, but a
small sample was operated on, could be separated by water alone,
but as even this soil supported some vegetation—the whortleberry and
various grasses as well as lichens, all the minerals found in vegeta-
tion might have been detected by exhausting a sufficiently large
quantity. In the fertile soil is found a larger amount of matters solu-
ble in acid, in the above instance six and a half per cent.; and here
the analyst had no difficulty in finding all the mineral food of vegeta-
tion. In the sterile soil but little more than four per cent. of matters
were dissolyed by acids, and in this phosphoric acid and alkalies
were not present in appreciable quantity. Finally, the larger share
of the soilin both cases resists the solvent action of acids nearly
altogether.
168 LECTURES ON

The portion soluble in water represents*the presently available
stock of plant food in the soil. As already intimated, plants receive
their nutriment either as gas or as liquid. The fixed mineral matters
of the soil are taken up by the plant from solution in water. If we
examine the soil with sufficient care, we do not fail to find everything
in it in a soluble state that is needed by vegetation.

Quite recently, Grouven and Stéckhardt have given renewed proof
of this statement. Below is a tabular view of the matters found by
these chemists in three soils—one poor, the others very productive:

That portion which comes into solution only by the use of strong
acids represents the reserve forces of the soil. Here we find stores
of plant food, which, under natural agencies, require many years to
become fully available to vegetation; but which are, nevertheless,
constantly, though very slowly, contributing to the fertility of the
soil. The least soluble matters, again, do not wholly escape slow
alteration and partial solution, and, as analyses show, often contain
alkalies, lime, &c.

As to the solubility of the food of the plant in water, it may be
remarked that while the analyses quoted sufficiently demonstrate the
general fact, science enables us to comprehend, to some extent, the
detail of the processes which bring about this result. The chemist
is in the habit of considering certain bodies, viz: silica, oxide of iron,
and phosphate of iron or phosphoric acid in presence of oxide of iron,
as absolutely insoluble, and under most circumstances’ they are so, in
pure water, when alone. But in presence of other bodies, especially
when the mixture is so complicated as in the soil, they manifest
a very different action. Many bodies which do not yield to the
solvent action of pure water are very perceptibily taken up by car-
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 169

bonated water, (i. e., water saturated with carbonic acid.) Thus, to
use a well-known instance, carbonate of lime is as good as insoluble
in pure water, but in carbonated water it dissolves quite readily.
Salts of ammonia dissolve phosphate of lime to a very appreciable
extent, as has long been known, and as Liebig has recently shown by
quantitative trials. Silica is not absent from natural waters, although
the conditions of its solution are not well understood. The chemist
has succeeded in preparing strong solutions of silica in pure water,
artificially, and the so-called infusoria of all fresh water streams,
which sometimes have accumulated to form beds of many miles in ex-
tent and many feet in depth, are but the silicious skeletons of micro-
scopic vegetable organisms that collected their silica from the clearest
and purest water. Phosphate of iron is soluble, or at least yields its
phosphoric acid, under the conjoint action of carbonate or silicate of
lime and carbonated water. Sulphate of baryta, even, is decomposed
in the soil, and yields its sulphuric acid to a growing plant.

Allusion has already been made to the importance of those matters
which, originally belonging to the atmosphere, have become a portion
of the soil.

Pulverized rocks do not constitute a good soil until they have be-
come weathered—4. e., chemically decomposed, so as to contain a
portion of soluble matters, and also acquire a certain content of car-
bon and nitrogen. - It happens that these two effects are conjointly
brought about. The neighborhood of a volcano affords opportunity
for tracing the formation of a fertile soil in a manner analogous
to, or identical with what occured over all the land before the
human epoch. The lava that lies on the slopes or fills the con-
tiguous valleys, once melted rock, remains after cooling, almost
bare for years. Then lichens begin to cover its surface. These
succeed each other for generations, slowly increasing in number
and size, hastening by their decay the disintegration of the rock,
and causing the accumulation of humus and nitrates. So the weath-
ering of the rock, the use and enrichment of the sparse soil, goes
on, perhaps, for centuries before the earth is deep and fertile
enough to produce low shrubs. After another similar period a forest
is formed, with a soil rich in all that is needed for agriculture, being
stored with the fixed minerals that have been detached or solved
from the original lava, and having gathered during these ages mate-
rials from the atmosphere to make up the complement of fertility.

We often see railroad cuttings through beds of gravel or clay which
perfectly resemble the adjacent productive soil, but which remain for
years perfectly naked and barren, and only after a long period of time
assume a state of tolerable fertility.

The humus of the fertile soil, as already stated, does not, perhaps,
act to much extent in directly feeding vegetation, although we have
no positive evidence against the assumption that it is thus useful in
some degree. It does, however, in many indirect ways contribute to
the welfare of the plant. Its influence on the physical characters of
the soil, its mediating agency in maintaining the proper consistency,
moisture, and warmth of the earth, has been already noticed. The
170 LECTURES ON

carbonic acid resulting from its ceaseless oxydation is of vast import-
ance, both as a supply of this form of plant food, in more ‘abundant
measure than the atmosphere alone could yield, and as the most pow-
erful means of maintaining the requisite store of solved saline and
earthy food in the soil.

The general statement that humus, or, in other words, condensed atmo-
spheric plant food, is needful in the soil, requires some qualification.
It is not essential to all, even, of the so-called higher orders of plants,
or, indeed, to all agricultural plants. The cactus has its home on
the most naked arid sands. Pines and firs flourish in soil equally
destitute of humus. Buckwheat commonly grows on light, poor soils;
and it is asserted that in Peru and Chili, maize prospers in soils free
from humus, if started by a little guano, and afterward supplied with
water. We may, however, safely assert, that in temperate climates,
for the usual course of crops, a soil to be productive, in a practical
sense, must either contain originally, or have added to it, nitrogen
and carbon in assimilable form. Natural growth, in soil, destitute of
atmospheric ingredients, either of those plants just mentioned, whose
proper habitat is such a soil, or of the grains and common agricul-
tural plants, is, other things being equal, invariably too slow for the
purposes of agriculture. Not, indeed, for all purposes of agricul-
ture, for in what is called agriculture many very inferior crops
are annually reaped; but for the general purposes of a culture which
seeks to be ina high degree remunerative, the telluric elements are
insufficient.

The same holds true of the atmospheric as of the earthy ingre-
acne of soil in respect of varying quantity and different assimila-

ility.

In the poorest sand, analysis reveals the presence of nitrogen,
often one hundred times as much as is needed by the largest grain
crop; while in good soil the quantity of this element may amount to
from one to two thousandths of the entire weight. Of this nitrogen,
a portion exists as ammonia, another as nitric acid, but another and
far larger share of it, is in a form that is insoluble in water and una-
vailable to the plant.

In a rich garden soil that had been cultivated for many years,
Boussingault found in 100 parts—

Nitrogen ohetohar erence caettenetetre 0.261
Ammonia -+-++ +++. 4+... 0.0022 Containing nitrogen ----0.00181
INIEGRCHACT stage er tree + oh soe 0.00034 Containing nitrogen ----0.00009

By actual trial with this soil, the same distinguished experimenter
found that only the small amount of nitrogen existing as ammonia
and nitric acid was of present use to vegetation; the remainder,
96-100 of the whole, being for the time quite inert.

The inert nitrogen appears to exist chiefly in the humus of the
soil, in a form analogous to that assumed by the same element in
bituminous or anthracite coal. It is, however, most probable not
utterly unassimilable; but, as the carbon and hydrogen which are
combined with it oxydize, it appears in the form of nitric acid,
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. ail

especially in presence of lime or alkalies, or perhaps under other
conditions as ammonia.

As to the amount of assimilable matters needful to constitute a
fertile soil, we have hardly any just notion, nor, indeed, can we easily
form one.

If we assume what is as yet not altogether warranted, the right
of distinguishing between the assimilable and non-assimilable parts
of the soil by the solvent action of carbonated water, we still en-
counter the variable influence of physical characters as affecting the
distribution of the plant-food, and above all, there stands in our way
the capital fact that as the growth of the plant is progressive, so are
its wants, and likewise those solving mediating agencies which supply
its food. So that we cannot, by observations made at any one mo-
ment, determine the value of ingredients which extend their action
over a considerable period of time.

The same soil may vary exceedingly at different times in its con-
tent of soluble matters, as analysis has proved. In the garden soil
above alluded to the content of nitric acid given is that found in
June; but Boussingault informs us that in the following September
the same earth contained near thirty times as much of this ingredient.

There is doubtless a rigorous reciprocal relation between the
quantities of soluble (assimilable) matters in the soil and the mass
of soil needed to feed a plant during the vegetative period.

The greater the proportion of soluble matters, the less volume of
earth is neeeded to sustain a given crop. In practice it is found that
each kind of plant requires a certain and pretty large quantity of
soil for its development. The farmer has his rules as to the space
which shall intervene between individual plants of wheat, of potatoes,
of maize, &c.; and in regions widely distant from each other these
rules, adopted as the best result of experience, are more or less
unlike, varying with climate, soil, and other circumstances. It is
found, also, that on a given soil nearly the same crop is obtained,
whether the plants be closer to, or farther from each other, within
certain limits. In case of fewer plants, each one is more vigorous,
and gives a larger return; while in the other instance, the smaller
individual yield is made up by the greater number of plants.

Boussingault, to whose numerous and admirable researches the
student of scientific agriculture must constantly make reference,
found by actual measurement that, according to the rules of garden
culture as practiced near Strasburg, a dwarf bean had at its disposition
65 pounds of soil; a potatoe plant, (hill?) 190 pounds; a tobacco
plant, 480 pounds; and a hop plant, 3,000 pounds.

In respect to chemical composition, we may assert that the absence
of several, or even of one essential form of plant-food, must stamp
a soil with utter infertility, no matter how abundant its other ingre-
dients may be. It is equally true that the absence of one ingredient
in assimilable condition must constitute:a soil barren and worthless.

We may likewise lay down the proposition that the deficiency, up to
to acertain point, of one or several substances in available form,
renders a soil infertile. On the other hand we cannot, with any
riz LECTURES ON

hope of success, undertake to show what is this certain potnt or
define the limits which, over-passed, make the soil unproductive.

It not unfrequently happens that the presence of noxious com-
pounds greatly injures an otherwise excellent soil. Soluble salts of
iron and alumina, especially the sulphates of these bases, are, so
far as we now know, the principal causes of this kind of mischief.
Some soils are formed from rocks that contain numerous grains and
larger masses of iron pyrites or sulphid of iron, which, exposed to
the weather, oxydize to sulphate of iron (copperas) and the solution
of this salt in a certain stage of concentration destroys the vegetable
tissues, and thereby renders the soil in which it exists unfavorable
to growth. Ina specimen of peat from Brooklyn, Conn., the writer
found a not inconsiderable quantity of sulphate of iron, and likewise
sulphate of alumina. Both these salts have a powerful decomposing
effect on the rootlets of plants.

The importance which attaches to the proper availability or solu-
bility of the nutriment in the soil leads at once to the inquiry, may
not the soluble matters be washed out and lost by rains, or may they
not accumulate in too great quantity ?

There are certain influences external to the soil, which, acting re-
ciprocally, tend to maintain in it a nearly constant content of soluble
matter. On the one hand the disintegration of the soil, the decay of
vegetation, rain, and dew, are perpetually enriching; while vegetable
growth, springs, and streams, (rain that has passed through the mould, )
and evaporation, are as continually wasting the soil. Since the mass
of soil is so great, and the most rapid and exhausting of these pro-
cesses operate so slowly, their effect is in general to leave the soil in
possession of the requisite small amount of soluble matters, and only
in exceptional cases can positive excess or deficiency occur.

In the soil itself we find, however, a remarkable property which
enables it to convert excess of soluble matters into an appropriate
quantity. and at the same time to store up this excess against what
might otherwise be a period of want. The soil has, in fact, a power
of regulating its supplies to vegetation, in a manner that was not
dreamed of but a decade since.

The fact has been already alluded to, in treating of the physical
characters of the soil, that it has a power of absorbing vapor of
water, and in general other gaseous bodies—a power shared by the
soil to more or less extent with all porous bodies.

Besides this purely physical quality, we find the soil to possess
another absorptive capacity, which, though not independent of phy-
sical conditions, appears to be chemical in its nature, that is, depends
upon the presence of certain kinds or combinations of matter.

Without this chemical absorption the other quality would be of
little avail in directly nutrifying the plant, because water alone is
capable of nullifying the latter, and at the same time performing any
office that it might appear to exercise in a much more effectual man-
ner. Ammonia has long been known to be taken up by the soil, and
to be retained init. Previous to the year 1850 it was supposed that
this gas underwent absorption by surface condensation, exerted by
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 1%

the more porous ingredients of the soil, namely, humus, oxyd of iron
and alumina; an agency which is exhibited most strikingly in case of
ammonia by charcoal, which, when freshly ignited, may absorb as
much as ninety times its bulk of this gas. The ammonia thus con-
densed is, however, easily removed. Water or exposure to moist
air at once displaces it, for it is only the absolutely dry charcoal that
absorbs ammonia. Common moist charcoal has no appreciable faculty
of this kind, its pores being already fully occupied, having satisfied
their absorptive power on vapor of water and the ingredients of the
atmosphere.

Liebig, reasoning from these facts, asserted in his ‘‘ Chemistry
applied to Agriculture and Physiology,’’ that ‘‘the ammonia absorbed
by clay or ferruginous oxyds is separated by every shower of rain
and conveyéd in solution to the soil.”’

The chemical absorption consists in the fixation and retention in
the soil of volatile or dissolved matters, by their entering into com-
paratively insoluble combinations. This fixation is not, however,
absolute, as we shall presently see.

Thompson and Way of England, in 1850, (see Journal Royal Agri-
cultural Society of England for that year,) first began to develope the
interesting facts which relate to this subject. Since the date of their
investigations Liebig, Voelcker, Henneberg & Stohmann, Eichhorn,
and Brustlein, have occupied themselves with its study.

The main facts are, briefly stated, as follows:

Free ammonia and lime, and their carbonates, are absorbed and
chemically retained by the organic acids, (humic, crenic, &c.,) the
ammonia in a non-volatile, but to some extent soluble form. Am-
monia is also absorbed by oxyd of iron and alumina, and held in a
non-volatile and very slightly soluble state.

Salts of ammonia, namely, sulphate hydrochlorate and nitrate, are
at once decomposed by the soil when their dilute solutions are agitated
with or filtered through it; the ammonia being retained, the acid re-
maining in solution united to lime. ~

The same salts of potash are likewise decomposed as above; the
potash being retained, the acids uniting with lime.

Salts of lime, in general, are not absorbed, especially when added
alone to the soil, or when the soil is rich in lime; but in several of
Voelcker’s experiments the liquor from a dung-heap containing a con-
siderable quantity of sulphate of lime lost this ingredient nearly or
entirely by filtration through a sandy soil, and at the same time the
amount of carbonate of lime in the solution was diminished.

Salts of soda and magnesia are also retained, though usually in a
less degree.

When solutions of phosphates and silicates of the alkalies are em-
ployed in these experiments, we find that the acids are also retained;
and from the trials of Voelcker already referred to, we have evidence
that sulphuric and hydrochloric acids are also liable to absorption.
In no instance has a fixation of nitric acid been observed.

According to Brustlein’s late researches, the retention of the bases
when employed in saline combinations cannot occur except in presence
of carbonate of lime. This view is, however, erroneous.
174 LECTURES ON

Way, after studying separately as far as possible the effect of each
ingredient of the soil without arriving at any satisfactory conclusion
as to the seat of this peculiar absorptive power, as a last resort inves-
tigated the relations of the silicates to saline solutions. Silicates con-
taining but one base he found ineffectual, and next had recourse to
compound silicates. He experimented then with feldspar, but found
that it was without action on solutions of ammonia salts, and hence
concluded that the powder of granitic rocks is not the agent of these
decompositions. Hisnextstepwasamoresuccessfulone. Heattempted
to imitate the compound silicates that may occur in the soil as products
of the weathering of rocks, such as most probably exist in all soils to
a greater or less degree. He artificially prepared silicates of alumina
with potash, soda, lime, and ammonia, respectively; and these he found
to possess the property of suffering decomposition in saline solutions,
with the mutual replacement (fixation) of isomorphous bases.

But it was reserved for Hichhorn, in 1858, to set forth in a true
light the action of the double alumina-silicates. This experimenter,
in cognizance of the fact that Way’s artificial silicates contained water
as an essential ingredient, was led to make trials with natural compounds
ofasimilarcharacter. Heselected for this purpose the zeolites, chaba-
zite, and natrolite, whose composition is given among those minerals
from which soils originate in the table on page 150. The chabazite
he employed was essentially a silicate of alumina, lime, and water.
The fine powder of this mineral being agitated and digested for some
days with hydrochlorates (chlorids*) of potash, soda, dilute solutions
of ammonia, lime, &c., fixed in the solid and nearly insoluble form a
portion of the basic ingredient of these salts, while the acid was found
in the solution combined with a quantity of lime equivalent to the
absorbed base. In one experiment the powdered chabazite was
digested for ten days with a dilute solution containing a known
amount of pure common salt. The mineral was then found to have a
composition, compared with that it originally possessed, as follows:

Comparing the two statements, we see that nearly one-half the lime
of the original mineral is replaced by soda. A loss of water also has
occurred. The solution separated from the mineral contained nothing
but soda, lime, and chlorine, and the latter in precisely its original
quantity.

By acting on chabazite with dilute chlorid of ammonium for ten days
the mineral was altered, and contained 3°33 per cent. of ammonia.
Digested twenty-one days, the mineral yielded 6:94 per cent. of
ammonia, and also had lost water.

Hichhorn found that the artificial soda-chabazite re-exchanged soda
for lime when digested in a solution of chlorid of calcium; in solution
of chlorid of.potassium both soda and lime were separated from it and
replaced by potash. So, the ammonia-chabazite in solution of chlorid
of calcium exchanged ammonia for lime, and in solutions of chlorids of
potassium and sodium both ammonia and lime passed into the liquid.
The ammonia-chabazite in solution of sulphate of magnesia lost
ammonia but not lime, though doubtless the latter base would have
been found in the liquid had the digestion been continued longer.

It thus appears that in the case of chabazite all the protoxyd bases
may mutually replace each other, time being the only element of
differences in the exchanges.

In experimenting on natrolite, however, Hichhorn found that it was
not affected by solution of chlorid of calcium, owing perhaps to some
peculiarity in the constitution of this mineral, its soda being probably
more firmly combined than that of chabazite.

These valuable researches, though serving but as an introduction
to the study of a highly-complicated subject, present so close an
analogy to what is observed in case of the soil, no matter whether it
be fertile or barren, clay or sand, that we are fully warranted in
assuming the presence in all soils of hydrous double silicates which
determine the absorption and retention of potash, ammonia, &c., from
solutions of their salts.

As regards the fixation of the acids, we know that oxyd of iron and
alumina, as well as lime and magnesia under certain conditions, form
insoluble phosphates and silicates; we are also acquainted with an
insoluble chlorine compound, viz: chloro-phosphate of lime, which
occurs abundantly as the mineral apatite, while sulphuric acid forms
insoluble combinations with excess of peroxyd of iron anda lumina.
We know, however, no insoluble compounds of nitric acid with any of
the bases found in the soil, excepting oxyd of iron and alumina, and
these require a high temperature for their formation.

The fixation of the bases in the circumstances described, both in the
soil and with hydrated aluminous silicates, is influenced by a variety
of conditions, physical and chemical. The only points which further
require notice are: 1st. That an ordinary soil is capable of fixing a
vastly larger quantity of ammonia, potash, or phosphoric agid—the
three generally most rare, and therefore most precious forms of plant
food—than is ever likely to be brought into the soil either by natural
or artificial means. 2d. That the soil never completely removes any of
these bodies from even the most dilute solution. 3d. The soil which
has saturated itself from a solution of these bodies restores them again
slowly to pure water or to a weaker solution.

Way, Russell, and Liebig, from a partial apprehension of the nature
of this absorption, drew the premature inference that land plants do
not receive their food from solutions, but themselves attack and solve
176 LECTURES ON

the soil. In the light of the facts we have set forth, this view is not
for a moment admissible.

In seeking the means by which the dissolved matters of the soil
find entrance into the plant, we must have recourse to the same
agency which accounts for the imbibition of its gaseous food. Differ-
ent liquids or solutions of different solids in the same liquid, if capable
of mixture at all, exhibit the osmotic or diffusive tendency, which
has been considered in case of gases.

If a tall vessel be partly filled with salt and then completely with
water, the salt as it dissolves forms a solution much heavier than
pure water, which therefore tends to remain unmixed at the bottom
of the vessel. In fact it is easy to add the water so carefully that at
first no salt shall be perceptible by taste or otherwise near the surface.
In time, however, although every possible means of mechanical
admixture be perfectly avoided, the salt will diffuse into the pure
water until every portion of the liquid be uniform in composition.

Diffusion will take place equally well through porous membranes,
provided they are capable of being wetted by (have surface attraction
for) at least one of the liquids.

The apparatus shown in figure 14 is one commonly employed to

Fig. 14. illustrate the fact of liquid diffusion. The tube a

F is fastened to the neck of a bladder filled with brine,

solution of sugar, or other dense Jiquid, and the

latter is immersed in the water of the large vessel.

Immediately water passes inwardly to the brine

(endosmose) and salt passes outwardly to the water

(exosmose.) The endosmose being more rapid than

the exosmose, the brine shortly rises in the tube to
a considerable height.

The rapidity and even the direction of the osmose _
is greatly dependant on the nature of the membrane.
Alcohol and water diffuse into each other without
difficulty when brought into direct contact; if we
separate them by a bladder we find that water will
rapidly pass into the alcohol, but the reverse flow
will take place with great slowness, for the reason
that alcohol cannot wet the surface of this membrane.
On the other hand india-rubber is readily moistened
by alcohol but not by water; and if a thin sheet of
this substance be interposed between these liquids,
it will be seen that alcohol passes the membrane
into the water much more rapidly than water tra-
verses in the opposite direction.

Schacbt has made observations on the cell-mem-
brane of the Caulerpa prolifera, a plant presenting
———— single cells of sufficient size for ‘such purposes, and
fou that it admitted of all the phenomena of diffusion exactly as
manifested by other membranes.

The rootlets of a plant being immersed in the water (or moisture)
of the soil, act towards it as the bladder filled with brine in our

AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. jr ed

figure. The liquids of the root-cells being of different composition
roue the soil-water, and the cell-membranes ‘admitting (having surface
attraction for) the soil-water, the latter with its contents penetrates
the cells, so long as difference of composition or want of equilibrium in
the surface attractions, either of the membrane for the liquid, or of
the dissolved matters for the solvent, exist. The diffusion goes on
from cell to cell in the same manner throughout the whole plant, as
long as any cause produces inequality in the toutual surface attractions
of any two of its ingredients, whether solid or liquid.

Since perpetual changes are progressing in every part of the grow-
ing vegetable organism, we have no difficulty in finding the causes
which keep up diffusion in or into the plant.

Let us suppose that in any cell there exists at the moment a liquid
containing in solution all the food of vegetation. If now carbonic
acid and water unite to form dextrin, and this solidifies in the shape
of starch or cellulose, there is foumed in this cell a vacuum which
disturbs the nee equilibrium of the whole plant, and determines
a movement towards this cell of carbonic acid from the leaf cells and
of water from the root cells to restore the same.

An atom of lime coming in contact with newly formed oxalic acid
combines with it to form an insoluble salt; the lime thus removed
from solution is at once replaced from an adjacent cell; this again
supplies itself from another in the direction of the soil, until the
extremity of a rootlet is reached, and here an atom passes in from
the soil water, this again to be replaced from the surrounding stores.

The vast amount of water that is removed by evaporation (the
attraction of dry air for water) from the foliage of vegetation is in
the same manner supplied from the soil, and it traverses in its upward
way all the cells of the plant. The supply of saline matters is
however partially or wholly independent of this ascending current of
water, for it must be very greatly checked in circumstances where
the atmosphere is saturated with moisture, as in a conservatory or
Wardian case, although here growth goes on with the greatest vigor.

It thus appears that whenever any chemical or physical change
occurs in the plant, we have the origin of a disturbance which may
set in motion the juices of the cells, the water, and dissolved matters
of the soil, and the gases of the atmosphere.

In this manner our cultivated plants are able to gather their food
from solutions like the water of springs and wells, or the aqueous
extract of soils, which are so dilute that but one part of potash or
phosphoric acid is present in one or even twenty thousand parts of
water. So, too, we may find in plants, substances which it is im-
possible to detect in the soil, and it is not a little interesting that
iodine, a substance largely employed in medicine and photography,
is almost entirely procured from the ashes of sea-weeds, although it
has never yet been detected with certainty in sea-water, even by
the use of methods that would enable the chemist to.find it, did it.

LECTURE IV.

IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL BY TILLAGE, DRAINAGE, AMENDMENTS, AND
FERTILIZERS.

Having attempted to define at length the reasons of fertility in the
soil, we may appropriately recapitulate this part of our subject in
order to set in a clearer light the means of improvement.

1. A fertile soil must contain all the mineral matters (ash) of the
plant.

2. It must include a certain store of atmospheric ingredients, viz:
organic matters or their equivalents—ammonia or nitrates—in short,
some store of nitrogen, and usually of carbon.

3. It must contain these matters in an available or assimilable form,
i. €., ina certain degree of solubility in water, thus yielding them to
vegetation as rapidly as required.

4. The soil must be free from noxious substances.

5. Must possess favorable physical characters, be neither too porous
nor compact, neither too wet nor too dry; must afford a congenial
home and lodgment for the plant.

It is comparatively rare that these conditions are perfectly fulfilled
in nature, or if they exist in any given place at a certain time they
suffer disturbance after a longer or shorter period. Hence the ancient
and wide spread art of cultivation or improving the soil. Hence,
too, the immense practical importance of a scientific, 7. e., accurate
and complete understanding of the conditions of fertility and of the
means of communicating or restoring them.

The method of improvement, like the characters of the soil, fall
naturally into the two classes, mechanical or physical, and chemical.

The first class of improvement comprehends tillage, drainage, and
mixture.

In the second class is included whatever contributes to the nourish-
ing qualities of the soil, either by direct addition of the food of plants,
or of agents that collect, solve, or otherwise prepare this food, as
manures and amendments.

This division, though warranted for convenience of study, has no
practical existence, for the chemical and physical phenomena of
nature are always so intimately associated that their rigorous sepa-
ration 1s, In most cases, impossible.

In a very fertile soil it is only needful to deposit the seed in favor-
able circumstances as regards temperature and weather, and in due
time the harvest is ready. In such a soil there is a suflicient store
of plant food, and all the external conditions of rapid vegetable
growth. In the poorer soil, in most soils, in fact, there is some want
to be supplied, some improvement to be attempted. The first step
in meliorating the soil, the one almost universally indispensable even
in fertile soils, as a preparation for the seed and young plant—the
step always first made in practice and the one in general first required
by enlightened theory, is tillage.
Z AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 179

The operations of tillage, viz: spading, ploughing, harrowing, &c.,
have the mechanical effect to break up and admix the earth. They
convert the surface compacted by rain and sun into a loose and friable
mould suitable for the deposition of the seed and for the enlargement
of the roots of the young plant. Beyond this, these operations, “really,
though but to a slight extent, mechanically lessen the size and increase
the number of the e earthy particles.

It is chiefly the loosening of the earth and the consequent better
admission of water and air, which facilitate the disintegrating effect
of these atmospheric agents, whereby, as already explained, the rock
fragments are decomposed and dissolved with perpetual increase of
the stores of assimilable food.

Tillage likewise assists, in the same manner, in converting any
poisonous matters into innocuous or even salubrious forms. Soluble
salts of protoxyd of iron, which might accumulate in the deeper soil,
are, by exposure to oxygen, changed into insoluble and harmless com-
binations. E ixposure e of the soil by tillage to the atmosphere also has
the effect to increase the absorption of ammonia, and to hasten the
process of nitrification.

Finally, the circulation of water and the consequent distribution
of plant food, the removal of excessive moisture after rains, and the
absorption of water vapor after droughts, as well as the regulation
of the temperature of the soil, are promoted to a most advantageous
degree.

In that stage of agricultural which first follows upon pastoral or
migratory husbandry, the simplest modes of cultivation are the only
ones practiced ; the amount of tillage is small, just sufficient to prepare
way for the seed, and it is accomplished by the rudest implements.

With the progress of the arts, ploughing, harrowing, &c., are em-
ployed to a greater extent. The implements used in these operations
are improved in construction, and adapted to all varieties and situa-
tions of soil, so that they may be worked at a greater depth and more
frequently, as well as at a reduced cost.

A matter of great importance in tillage is to secure a proper depth
of soil. It is obvious that, other things being equal, the deeper the
soil the more space the roots of crops have in which to extend them-
selves, and the more food lies at their disposal. By deep culture new
farms are discovered beneath the old, and it is possible to realize the
apparent absurdity of ‘‘more land to the acre.’’

Deep culture is one of the most efficacious means of counteracting
drought, as we shall notice presently in discussing drainage.

Deep tillage is not, however, always practiced. The grain fields of
Germany, even in the most carefully tilled provinces, as Saxony, are
to this day mostly ploughed with rude wooden tools often not unlike
those figured in classical dictionaries as in vogue among the ancients,
which merely score up the soil to the depth of two, three, or rarely
four inches. In our country, which surpasses every other in the real
merit of its agricultural implements, and where the means of deep
tilth are in the hands of every farmer, tillage is notwithstanding
180 LECTURES ON

shallow im the main, and our agricultural journals are often occupied
with discussions as to the advantage or disadvantage of deep culture.

There are, indeed, some instances in which deep ploughing is in-
jurious, either permanently, or as most generally happens for a short
period. In the latter case the temporary injury most often turns out
to be a lasting benefit.

Where a thin surface soil of fair quality rests upon a gravel or other
leachy stratum, too cae ploughing may, so to speak, knock the
bottom out of the po . é., by breaking through into the open sub-
soil, may injure the vain capacity of the upper soil for water and
manures. In case ie sub-soil is of a ‘‘cold’’ ochery, noxious char-
acter, the bringing it to the surface may occasion detriment for the
time.

The plough is the instrument most extensively employed for tillage,
and the one to which recourse must be had whenever large fields are
to be broken up. In ordinary ploughing the soil is inverted, and ac-
cording to its texture more or less pulverized and mellowed to a depth
of from three to six inches. Trench ploughing consists in a similar in-
versing of the soil to a considerably greater depth, as far as one foot or
more, ‘and is practiced to advantage where the soil is good to this
depth, especially with the view of bringing up manures which are sup-
posed to descend and accumulate below. Sub-soil ploughing is intended
merely to break up and loosen the lower soil without bringing it to the
surface. The sub-soil plough is merely a narrow share or wedge that
follows the furrow of the common plough, and disturbs the ordinary
plough bed to the depth of several inches. Itse Senos ae is expen-
sive and less in vogue than it was a few years ago. It is mainly
useful where the sub-soil is with diflic ulty penetrable to water.

In garden culture, or even in field culture in certain countries, as
in parts of sae where labor is cheap, spading and forking are em-
ployed instead of ploughing, and with great advantages in heavy soils,
because the tread of beasts of draught is entirely avoided, and the

soil is much more throughly pulverized, intermixed and loosened up.

After ploughing and if need be cross- ploughing, the harrow,
scarifier or cultivator, some form of toothed implement, is drawn over
the field to accomplish a sufiiciently perfect comminution and levelling
of the surface for the seed-bed. On heavy clays which, especially
in wet weather, are thrown up by the plough in tenacious lumps that
further harden in the wind and sun, the clod crusher, a system of
toothed disks revolving at a little distance from each other on a com-
mon center, at right angles to the line of draught is employed.

On very light soils. the roller is used to make the earth more com-
pact, especially above the seed. 7

In late years a countless number of modifications and not a few
improvements in the implements and methods of tillage have been
suggested, and to a greater or less degree employed, in practical agri-
culture; but it is not the place here to enter further into details.

Tn seis localities, tillage may completely and profitably replace
all other means of improving the soil.

It is obvious that with each harvest there is removed from the soil
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 181

a quantity of potash, lime, phosphoric acid, and other fixed mineral
matters, and likewise more or less ammonia and nitric acid. With
every crop the field yields, its own stores of fertility are drawn upon,
and, in fact, lessened, and after a certain number of crops are gath-
ered, the available food of most soils is so far diminished that the
succeeding crops fail of full development; in other words, the soil 1s
exhausted. By exhaustion ina practical sense is meant, be it noticed,
no absolute removal of plant food, but such a relative diminution as
eauses the harvests to fall below a medium or standard yield.

It is the business of culture to replace this spent material, to restore
the capacity of the soil, to keep it up year after year to a remunera-
tive degree of productiveness.

Jethro Tull, a distinguished Englishman, who worked and wrote in
the last century, was led to adopt the theory—not at all improbable,
viewed from the scientific stand-point of his day—that the impalpably
fine particles of earth are the real food of vegetation. and accordingly
he sought to fit the soil fora more rapid and perfect nutrition by
pulverizing it. He introduced the horse-hoe, or cultivator, into
English husbandry, and actually succeeded, by the diligent use of his
improved implements, and by a peculiar mode of oceupying his field,
in obviating the necessity of any manures and in raising successive
crops on the same field uninterruptedly for twelve years. He failed,
however, in maintaining this system for a longer time, having adopted
one fatal rule, ‘‘never plough below the staple.’ It is but just to
the memory of this eminent agricultural philosopher to explain why
he adhered to a notion to us so absurd. Tull was aware of the im-
portant part played by the atmosphere in the nutrition of plants.
The use of stirring and pulverizing the soil was to enable the parti-
cles of earth to attract from the atmosphere ‘‘the nitre or acid spirit
of the air,’’ which, in his view, further dissolves and prepares the
soil to support vegetation. He had no chemistry to teach him that
the indispensable mineral matters of the soil exist in it in such
minute quantity, and are therefore liable to exhaustion. He had no
analytical data to reveal the difference between the chemical statics
of the vineyard—from the sagacious observation of which his theory
originated—and the wheat field, which more largely robs the soil of
alkalies and phosphates, and so he found it reasonable to use only
that portion of the soil—the staple or usual tilth—to which the at mos-
phere has obvious access.

The system of Tull has, however, been revived, and, with the modi-
fications suggested by.modern science, has been eminently successful
in the hand of its ingenious advocate, the Rev. S. Smith, of Lois
Weedon, Northamptonshire, England. Mr. Smith has produced large
wheat crops continuously on the same soil for a series of years by
simply laying off his fields in strips five feet wide, and growing his
crops in drills, with frequent and deep hoeing, on alternate strips in
successive years. The tillage of the vacant strip this year prepares
it to sustain a crop next year—enables the solution and absorption of
‘food enough to feed a full crop.

By this plan of culture Mr. Smith raised the yield of his wheat

182 LECTURES ON

grounds from 16 bushels to an average (for ten years) of 34° bushels
per acre. Although he asserts that he has never known this pl n—
which differs from Tull’s chiefly in the depth of tillage—to fail where
carried out according to his directions, it is easy to see that not every
soil will admit of its successful application, even independently of
considerations of cost. This method demands for its success that the
soil be so deep and so readily decomposable that the plant may find
its needful supplies in one-half the accustomed superficies, and there-
fore must possess physical properties that, under the treatment, are
in the highest degree favorable to vegetation.

On large holdings the maintenance of such an amount of assimilable
food as constitutes the soil fertile, is often profitably accomplished by
the ancient practice of summer-fallow, which is the same thing for a
whole farm as the vacant strips in the Lois Weedon system are for
the wheat fields. A field is left void of crops, and is repeatedly
ploughed and harrowed during the whole of one summer, generally re-
ceiving the seed of some winter grain in the autumn. The fallow is
thus an extra period of rest for the soil—enables it te accumulate
within itself a store of fertility against future harvests, and is often
attended with collateral advantages that alone are sufficient to war-
rant its employment, viz., the destruction of weeds, insects, and the
improvement of the texture of the soil.

In many situations these processes of tillage are so laborious or in-
effectual that recourse must be had to other operations to change®
radically the characters of the soil.

Heavy clays, especially in a moist climate, are very difficult of
tillage from their peculiar physical qualities. In spring time they
become so exceedingly tenacious and compacted by the rains, that
they dry with extreme slowness.- While wet they resist any attempt
at pulverization, because if ploughed in that condition the plastic up-
turned masses harden in drying to intractable clods. It hence results
that heavy clays need to be tilled when they have arrived at a certain
stage of dryness, and then the operation of ploughing is exceedingly
laborious, while the full preparation of the seed-bed is brought late
into the season. As clay soils dry, the surface is baked into a crust
which impedes the circulation of water, and which, shrinking and
cracking apart in innumerable places, ruptures the rootlets of plants.
Is is especially difficult to induce a deep tilth in such soils, so that
during protracted drought the crops suffer greatly on them.

When clays are not continuous in depth, but rest upon a gravelly
and open sub-soil; or when, by art, underground channels are pro-
vided for the removal of surplus water, these impediments to tillage
and to profitable culture are greatly lessened or entirely removed.

Many soils of lighter character, and in wet climates, sandy soils
even, are remarkably benefited by artificial provision for the removal
of surplus or bottom water.

It is but a few years since the introduction into general practice of
a system of drainage intended to effect this purpose took place in
Great Britain, James Smith, of Deanston, Scotland, led by an in-
ductive study of the evils, and the true means to be employed in the

AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 1838

improvement of cold soils, devised what, under the name of Thorough
Drainage, has become one of the most ‘useful appliances in cultiva-
tion.

Thorough drainage consists essentially in constructing underground
channels, ‘sufficient in number and size, for the re moval of surplus
water down to a certain depth. * A, clay field, for example, has a
system of parallel ditches dug in it, three or four feet in depth, and
sixteen to thirty feet apart. These have such an inclination, and so
connect with cross or main ditches, as to give the water th: it may
collect in them a ready discharge. The bottoms of the ditches are
then filled with small stones to the pete of about one foot, or have
carefully laid in them a pipe of baked clay, (drain tile,) one to three
inches in diameter, and are thereupon filled up with earth. These
channels at once discharge the water of rains and melting snows when
the soil is sufficiently porous; and if at first, as happens with clays,
the soil is too retentive to allow the ready renova of water, this evil
mends itself in a year or two. We know that a mass of clay exposed
to the air in dry weather gradually dries off superficially, and ap-
pears full of minute fissures or larger rifts. In time it becomes
entirely friable; and if water be poured on it the liquid, for the most
part, rapidly filters through. It is only by a prolonged immersion in
water that the dried clay | absorbs so much of it as to become tenacious
and plastic again. The under drains are the effectual means of drying
out the clay soil to such a point that excess of water flows off without
hindrance, and they are no less effectual in preventing the recurrence
of a too retentive state.

The fact that we are in possession of extended treatises on drain-
age, renders it unnecessary to do more here than to allude to some
of the more striking results of this s¥stem which have been observed
in practice, and to indicate their scientific explanation.

One of the most important effects of thorough drainage consists in
tempering the extremes of moisture and dryness, of heat and cold,
so that a drained soil is dryer in the wet seasons and moister in the
dry seasons—is warmer in cold weather, and cooler in hot weather,
than an undrained soil.

The result of the rapid removal of surplus water on the soil is such
as enables it to be tilled from two to four weeks earlier in the spring
than might otherwise happen, a gain which, in cold climates or back-
ward spring-times, is often the saving of a crop.

The vast mass of water that is thus removed without evaporation
corresponds to a large increase in the amount of heat which may
accumulate in the soil, an increase that isnot only perceived in the

rapid growth of veg etation after the ground is prepared for seed, but
also is manifest in the earlier melting “of snows. The official inquiries
of the Royal College of Rural Economy of Prussia show that the
snow in that country thaws away on the average one week earlier on
drained than on contiguous undrained land.

It is said that Smith, of Deanston, was led to his study of drainage
by an observation made on ridged fields. From time immemorial it
has been a custom in some countries, especially in those overrun by
184 LECTURES ON

Roman civilization, to ridge up the fields by the plough, thus bringing
the soil into beds of a rod or thereabouts in width, which are several
inches higher in the centre than at the edges. It was observed that
in time of dry weather the plants stationed upon the centre of the
ridges fared best, while those at the borders were liable to suffer,
although it might be supposed they occupied the most favorable
position, so far as access to the subterranean moisture is concerned,
On a moment’s reflection, it is obvious that the deeper the ‘‘staple’’
or penetrable friable soil is, the greater space will be occupied by
the rootlets of plants, and the larger will be the supplies of capillary
moisture; so that if the soil under the influence of protracted drought
becomes surface-dry to the depth of one inch or two inches, less in-
jury will accrue to the crop whose roots are diffused through a deep
soil than to one stationed in a shallow tilth. The fact seen in the
ridged fields is far more plainly exhibited on comparing drained and
undrained lands. In fact, drainage is recognized, among practical
farmers, as the best protection against drought. Not only does it
regulate the use of the water which falls upon the fields as rain, but
by exposing an immense amount of absorbent surface to the atmos-
phere, which freely permeates the drained soil, large quantities of
water are collected and condensed from the vapor of the air. It has
been recently observed at Hinxworth, England, that the flow of
‘water from drains sometimes increases considerably when the baro-
meter falls, although no rain-fall has occurred. :

The various chemical advantages that have been already attributed
to tillage, viz: aeration of the soil, solution and preparation of plant-
food, oxydation of unwholesome matters, are evidently to be antici-
pated from drainage in an eminent degree. In wet climates it is
found to be the best preparation for effectual tillage, and where the
condition of the soil requires it, the indispensable pre-requisite to
profitable husbandry,

The tenacious and intractable characters of clay soils are also effec-
tually overcome by the operation of heat—by burning the clay. A
heat of redness expels the combined water of clay, and destroys for-
ever its tenacity. A part of the soil is converted into something like
brick-dust, and the admixture of a small proportion of this is suffi-
cient to amend the heaviest soils. The same burning likewise makes
soluble the alkalies, and, in fact, nearly all the fixed mineral matters
of the clay, thus rendering it more fertile by increasing its power of
feeding vegetation.

It often happens that contiguous soils are greatly improved by
mixing together. A few loads of clay remedy the too great porosity
of a sand, and vice versa.

The physical characters of the soil being set to rights, the next
point is to feed the plant. So soon as crops fall below a certain unre-
munerative rate of yield, which, in most soils, happens in a few years,
other means of improvement, viz: manures, are called into requisition.

We have already spoken of tillage as a substitute for manure; but
the word manure originally included tillage, coming from the French

AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 185

maneuvrer, (main ouvrer,) or Latin manus operor, signifying to work
with the hands, a sense in which it was employed by Milton. The
term manure is now used in a general way to signily any substance
added to the soil to make it more productive.

Substances added in large quantity often act chiefly by qualifying
the physical properties of the sou, and are then appropriately termed
Amendments. Matters which operate in the main by feeding vegeta-
tion are more properly Fer tilizers. These again May nouri ish, directly,
by supplying at once to the growing plant one or all the nutrient in-
gredients it requires; or indirectly, “by making soluble the stores of
the soil, or otherwise disposing them to assume assimilable forms, or
by absorbing matters from the atmosphere. Most manures combine
these various offices to a greater or less degree.

While the popular name of those materials that are successfully
employed as manures is legion, the chemist, by his analysis, recog-
nizes in them all only the same ‘dozen kinds of matter which consti-
tute plants and soils.

The use of manures has been known from the earliest times, and
there has been no lack of attempts to explain their effects; but it is
only after the sciences of chemistry and vegetable physiology had
entered upon the modern development that it was possible to begin
understanding their mode of action. So difficult is the subject that
We are as yet by no means advanced to its full comprehension, which
requires a complete knowledge of the relations of each nutritive
element and compound with the plant, with the soil, and with the
atmosphere.

During all the centuries in which agricultural experience, with
reference to the operation of manures, has accumulated, we find that
the opinions of practical farmers have been almost endlessly at
variance; and as these conflicting opinions have faithfully reflected
the facts and phenomena which have presented themselves to agri-
culturists, we are prepared to find that at the present day there is
a constant recurrence of endlessly differing results in the use and
estimate of manures. We find in our current agricultural journals
abundant examples of crops being benefited by application of nearly
every one of the ash ingredients of the plant, as well as by ammonia
and nitrates, or bodies yielding these; and, on the other hand, re-
peated instances of their failure. <A scientific consideration of these
results enables us to explain much that is obscure, and reconcile
much that is conflicting, by taking into the account differences of soil,
climate, and crop; and by a careful study of the circumstances which
alter cases to sucha great degree, it will be possible, in time, to
unfold every mystery and elucidate every variety of effect.

The space at command here does not allow any detail with refer-
ence to the action of manures, except as may illustrate some of the
general principles which alone can serve to initiate us into the
method of their operation.
185 LECTURES ON

These general principles are the following:

1. Plants require various kinds of fixed mineral matters, and derive
the same exclusively from the soil.

The only exceptions to this statement are, perhaps, to be found in
case of chlorine and sodium, which appear to be carried inland from
the sea in the direction of prevailing winds, both in the spray and
dissolved in the vapor that ascends from the ocean.

2. Some plants which, in the natural state, derive a large portion of
the volatile elements of their ydrogen, oxygen, and
nitrogen—from the air, must be supplied with much more of these matters
Jrom the soil, in agricultural production.

As already remarked, the increased supply of these matters by the
soil is requisite only to insure that rapid and abundant growth which
constitutes agricultural production.

The very fact of an artificially increased supply of food to plants,
in connexion with the care otherwise provided by cultivation, in a few
generations enlarges their capacity for assimilating nutriment, greatly
increases the mass of vegetable matter that can . develop on a given
surface, and, in consequence, makes a fertile soil necessary for exhib-
iting the capabilities of the crop. Many of our agricultural plants are
the result of high cultivation, including, as one of its most efficient
factors, a fertile, and, in most cases, artificially fertilized soil. The
wretched weeds from which our numerous varieties of turnip, ruta-
baga, kohl rabi, cauliflower, broccoli, and cabbage have been derived,
are hardly recognizable as the originals of so many useful plants,
and these, as well as the wild e egilops of southern Europe, from which
the w Hea grain appears to have come, are no less inferior to the cul-
tivated plants, in appearance and value, than is the soil required for
their natural development, to that demanded in their agricultural pro-
awevion:

3. Different plants require different proportions of these substances for
their luxuriant growth.

4. Different plants require different absolute quantities of food to ma-
ture a full crop.

These propositions are illustrated by the accompanying table,
which represents, in average figures, the weight, in pounds, of total
produce, and of the chief ingredients, removed ‘annually from an acre of
good land, in case of several of the more commonly cultivated crops.

This table shows, that, other things being supposed equal, a supply
of nitrogen sufficient for a full rye crop would answer but for one-
third of a clover or beet crop; the phosphoric acid sufficient for a
meadow is but little more than half enough for a wheat field, and
only one-third as much as a crop of beans requires. It appears that
the potash which would fully nourish a crop of wheat is nearly enough
for grass or beans; while for clover twice, and for beets four-and-a-
half times as much is needful. A clover crop demands almost ten
times as much lime and magnesia as suffices for rye, and a wheat crop
must have more than ten times as much silica as serves the growth
of an equal yield of beans.

The erroneous conclusions which a hasty deduction might bring
out of the foregoing instructive table are checked by the fact ex-
pressed in the next proposition, viz:

5. Different plants, from peculiarities in their structure, draw differ-
ently on the same stores of nutriment.

There are some plants which flourish on the poorest soils, being
adapted to resist the extremes of drought, and accumulate their food
188 LECTURES ON

under what are, for nearly all agricultural plants, the most unfavor-
able conditions. Rye, for example, will grow well where wheat is
utterly unprofitable. Buckwheat yields a fair crop on exceedingly
poor soils; and the lupine is so extraordinary in this respect that by
its help the farmer may cover the most desolate blowing sands with
a luxuriant vegetation.

On the other hand, some crops are easily spoiled by overfeeding.
Thus wheat, and the slender-stemmed grains generally, are unremu-
nerative on the newly broken up prairies of our west, while maize
flourishes even on the richest soils, being in practical language ‘‘a
rank feeder.”’

It is plain that, other things being equal, a plant with long-branch-
ing numerous roots does not require so rich a soil as one with these
organs short and few, because it has a greater mass of earth at its
disposal out of which to collect its food.

Again, those plants which expose to the air a large leaf surface
should, other things being equal, flourish better than the sparsely-
leaved plants in a soil poor in atmospheric elements.

A plant which is of slow, regular, and protracted growth may, in
the same manner, organize more vegetable matter on a given soil
during a summer than one which quickly runs through all the stages
of its life, and therefore requires more rapid supplies of food—de-

mands more in a given time.

In general, also, those crops which produce seed require a better
soil for their continuous production than such as yield only foliage.

6. Different soils abound or are deficient, to a greater or less degree, m
one or more needful ingredients im assimilable for m.

With the original differences of soils are to be likewise classed the
changes in condition which tillage and cropping are perpetually
inducing. By the continued removal of crops the soul suffers a dimi-
nution of its resources, and often some one or a few of the nutritive
elements are soon brought to a minimum, while the others still remain
in quantity sufficient for hundreds of harvests. According to the
original composition of the soil, the failing ingredient may be potash
in one case, sulphuric acid in another lime i in another; and applica-
tion of these substances, respectively, may then form the most profit:
able manuring.

T. Jt appears from experience that the ingredients which are rarest in
the soull—which are therefore most liable to exhaustion, and most needful
to be replaced—are, in general, phosphoric acid, assimilable nitrogen, (be tt
in the form of ammonia or nitric acid,) and potash.

The substances just named are therefore important ingredients in
all those manures by whose continued and exclusive use the soil is
kept fertile, and constitute the chief part of such fertilizers as bring
up exhausted lands to immediate and remarkable, though it be tem-
porary, productiveness.

The above is intended as a very general statement, the truth of
which, as such, is not invalidated. by the numerous and important
exceptions which occur.

In examining the question of the direct action of manures, we have
first to notice the value of deductions from the composition of a sub-
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. \ 189

stance as to its fertilizing effect. Can we, by the study of the com-
position of a crop, decide what manure is most likely to benefit it ?
or can we determine, from the composition of a manure, what crop it
is best adapted for? The answer to these questions is, in many
cases, No! In laying down the general principles which are to be
regarded in a rational theory of manuring, we have had frequent
occasion to make the truth of a proposition depend upon ‘‘ other
things being equal.’’ Now it happens, unfortunately for the sim-
plicity of our science, that ‘‘other things’’ are often in the highest
degree unequal and unlike, so that we must busy ourselves with the
slow work of induction from facts mostly yet to be extricated by toil-
some experiment from their present confusion, rather than incumber
theory and disgust practice by generalizing de ductions that cannot
fail to be premature and erroneous. There are many cases in which
the effect of a fertilizer can be immediately connected with its com-
position. It not unfrequently happens that pasture lands from which
the only matters agriculturally removed are the ingredients of cheese,
after long use, deteriorate, refuse to nourish dairy animals, and be-
come nearly worthless. The’ use of bones or phosphatic manures
restores such fields to perfect pasturage; and the explanation afforded
by chemistry—viz: that all the phosphate of lime put in the milk as
a provision for the formation of the bones of a young animal is
permanently alienated from the soil in the exports of cheese, so
that exhaustion of this substance is caused, unless phosphates be ap-
plied—is entirely satisfactory.

The leguminous plants, though the richest in nitrogen of all our
crops, do not by any means require nitrogenous manure to the extent
demanded by wheat, which removes from the soil but one-half as
much, or less, of this substance. The difference here is obviously
due to the fact that the leguminous plants have deeper roots, more
foliage, and a longer period of growth.

Leguminous plants are rich in lime and sulphur, and hence are
often remarkably grateful for applications of gypsum. Fruit and
shade trees yield an ash largely consisting of carbonate of lime, and
their growth, especially on meager sandy soils, is often wonderfully
enhanced by the accident of some oyster shells or old mortar being
thrown on the ground over their roots.

The grasses and grains contain a large amount of silica in their
stems and leaves; but the artificial use of soluble silicates of potash
and soda has rarely been attended with more benefit than that of the
corresponding chlorids, and for the reason that silica is so universally
distributed.

Mr. Lawes, of England, found that on his farm wheat might be
grown for a dozen years or more in succession on the same field, and
give an average crop of 17 bushels per acre, without manure; while
a contiguous field, planted in turnips, in three years came to yield
scarcely anything. Mr. Lawes then found that, by the use of nitro-
genous manures, the wheat crop was at once doubled, while the
turnip crop was hardly affected; and, on the other hand, a mixture
of sulphate and soluble phosphate of lime (super-phosphate of lime)
190 LECTURES ON

had little influence on the wheat crop, but at once raised the turnip
field to a considerable degree of productiveness. These facts, borne out
by the quite general result of practice, indicate the conclusion which
some eminent authorities have unhesitatingly adopted, that soluble
phosphate of lime exercises a specific action on the turnip, indepen-
dent of the actual need of this plant for phosphates. There are,
however, such grounds for doubting this doctrine that, until further
investigations give us more complete data for judgment, a decision
must be suspended.

Some recently described experiments of Mr. Lawes on the effect of
fertilizers upon meadows are very interesting. He found that when
a manure consisting of phosphates and sulphates of lime, potash,
soda, and magnesia was applied to grass land, the development of
clover was at once astonishingly increased; while, when nitrogenous
manures were used, either alone or in addition to the above mixture,
the true grasses maintained the mastery.

The attempt made not long since to manure, plants with mixtures
representing what is taken off the field by a crop, turned out unsatis-
factorily, as the facts we have instanced make evident such a scheme
must; and we are led every day more and more to seek explanations
of the anomalous effects of manures in their indirect action.

The most familiar instance of indirect action is that of gypsum or
sulphate of lime. In contact with carbonate of ammonia, with so
much water as to make the mixture wet, an interchange of ingredients
takes place, so that sulphate of ammonia and carbonate of lime are
formed; and Liebig accounted in part for the beneficial operation of
gypsum by assuming that it thus ‘‘fixed’’ the volatile carbonate of
ammonia of rains and dews, and held it in the soil for the use of
vegetation.

On the other hand, Boussingault showed that when the mixture of
sulphate of ammonia and carbonate of lime, from being wet, dries so
far that it is only moist, like the soil is ordinarily, the reverse decom-
position ensues, and the ammonia once fixed, is unfixed. While we
can conceive of circumstances in which both these properties come
into play, beneficially or otherwise, it must be remembered that the
more late discovered absorbent power of the soil sets these effects of
gypsum quite out of the account in nearly all cases.

Humus, which, in the form of peat or swamp muck, or as resulting
from the decay of litter and the carbonacious ingredients of the ex-
crements of cattle, is a most common and useful manure, doubtless
accomplishes more hy indirect than by immediate action. It is the
most energetic absorbent of ammonia, as carbonate (according to
Brustlein, not of other salts) is the source of carbonic acid in the
sou, thus, by its presence, setting in operation the endless train of
changes whose result is the solution of mineral matters, and by its
hygroscopic character it assists to maintain the proper physical con-
dition of the soil.

_ Lime, which is one of the greatest renovators in use in agriculture,
1s, In a similar manner, of more indirect than immediate effect. Its
influence is especially manifest in fluxing the insoluble stores of plant-
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 191
food, and compelling the soil to yield its ingredients to the support of
vegetation.

Ammonia, when acting on the soil as carbonate, (coming from the
decomposition of urea, uric acid, and other nitrogenous bodies, ) is not
inferior to lime in its solvent effects.

Gypsum, common salt, carbonate of lime, nitrates of potash and
soda, and in fact all the saline compounds which are incorporated with
the soil in manures, may exert important physiological effects on the
plant in addition to their mere nutritive function.

We have already intimated that the transpiration of water through
the plant is very remarkably hindered when lime, potash, or the salts
just named are present in the absorbed liquid. This fact, observed
for the first time by Mr. Lawes, in 1850, and recently brought
again more strikingly into notice by Dr. Sachs, of Tharand, Saxony,
appears to be of great importance in the theory of manures. Dr.
Sachs experimented on various plants, viz: beans, squashes, tobacco,
and maize, and observed their transpiration in weak solutions (mostly
containing one per cent.) of nitre, common salt, gypsum, (one-fifth
per cent. solution) and sulphate of ammonia. He also experimented
with maize in a mixed solution of phosphate and silicate of potash,
sulphates of lime and magnesia, and common salt, and likewise ob-
served the effect of free nitric acid and free potash on the squash
plant. The young plants were either germinated in the soil, then re-
moved from it and set with their rootlets in the solution, or else were
kept in the soil and watered with the solution. The glass vessel
containing the plant and solution was closed above around the stem
of the plant by glass plates and cement, so that no loss of water could
occur except through the plant itself, and this loss was ascertained
by daily weighings. The result was that all the solutions mentioned,
except that of free nitric acid, quite uniformly retarded transpiration
to a degree varying from 10 to 90 per cent., while the free acid ac-
celerated the transpiration in a corresponding manner.

As the processes of elaboration—the chemical and structural me-
tamorphoses going on within the cells of the plant require time for
their performance, we can easily perceive that a too rapid upward
current of liquid, by diluting the juices, might measurably interfere
with the assimilation of the food, and that the presence of a body
may be no less useful by its regulating influence on the circulation of
the water than by contributing an ingredient necessary for the forma-
tion of the substance ot the plant itself.

It is also obvious that if a substance added to the soil retard the
transpiration of water through vegetation, a given store of hygro-
scopic moisture in the soil will serve the needs of vegetation longer
will reach further into time of drought than it otherwise could. Dr.
Sachs found that gypsum exerted the greatest effect in preventing
loss of water, and this observation gives a scientific ground of evi-
dence to the opinion long maintained among farmers, but rejected by
men of science, (and very properly, as no cause could be discovered
for such an effect, and the effect is not capable of measurement in

192 LECTURES ON
field culture,) that gypsum has the influence of a body that attracts
moisture.

The facts brought to light by the researches of Way, Hichhorn,
and Voelcker, already described, indicate another general mode by
which fertilizers, especially soluble saline bodies, may operate indi-
rectly. The investigations referred to, show that the bases (and
acids?) may replace each other in insoluble or slightly soluble combi-
nations, 7. e., soluble lime may displace insoluble ‘potash, making this
soluble and becoming insoluble itself. Soda may, in the same manner,
displace lime or potash, or ammonia, the rule being that the body
in excess goes into combination and expels those before combined.
We observe here a tendency to bring all the bases into what we may
designate as an equilibrium of solution. This principle appears adapted
more than any other yet discovered to generalize the phenomena of
indirect action, and enables us to forsee and explain them. Proofs
are not wanting of the actual operation of this principle in the soil.

Wollf (Naturgesetzlichen Grundlagen des Ackerbaues, 3d ed., p. 148,)
found in fact that the ashes of the straw of buckwheat grown with
a large supply of common salt, compared with the ashes of the same
part ‘of that plant grown on the same soil minus this addition, con-
tained less chlorid of sodium but much more chlorid of potassium,
there having occurred an exchange of bases in the soil.

Closely connected in many points with these phenomena of dis-
placement, yet in many respects different and peculiar, are the sol-
vent effects of saline bodies, alkalies, and carbonic acid in dilute
watery solution, to which allusion has been so frequently made in the
foregoing pages. We refer to this subject once more in this place
in order to give the results of some actual trials as to the disintegrat-
ing effect of these substances on soils and rocks. Dietrich, to whom
we owe these investigations, found that from a diluvial loamy soil con-
taining humus, the amount of matters rendered soluble by a dilute
solution of carbonate of ammonia (containing one per cent. of the salt)
was twice as great as that set free by water saturated with carbonic
acid, and of the alkalies, potash and soda, four times as much were
dissolved by the former as by the latter liquid. Solution of sulphate
of ammonia dissolved six times as much as carbonated water.

The action of carbonated water and carbonate of ammonia extended
chiefly to the alkalies. Sulphate of ammonia, while equally effective
in their solution, likewise dissolved a large amount of lime and mag-
nesia as sulphates. Caustic lime (one per cent.) in most cases pro-
duced a remarkable increase of volume in the earths submitted to its
action; the loam just mentioned became nearly three times as bulky
as it was at first, a decomposition of the silicates having taken place.
Carbonate of lime, in solution in carbonated water, had the most
vigorous action in eliminating the alkalies. Even gypsum, (sulphate
of lime,) in moist contact with powdered basaltic rock, sets free a
considerable amount of alkalies in a few days. Ammonia salts exert
a strong action on insoluble silicates, the ammonia and silica being
partially set free, the other acids and bases remaining in soluble com-
binations.
AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. 193

The most abundant, most generally employed, and most permanently
useful manures are the excrements and waste of animals. These
matters are, in fact, the residue, more or less concentrated, that
remains from the oxydation of vegetables which have served as food.
By the vital processes, the hydrogen and carbon of the vegetable
nutrient principles are chiefly consumed to the gaseous form, while a
portion of these, together with nearly all the nitrogen and all the
fixed mineral matters, are separated from the animal in the liquid or
solid shape, either immediately prepared, or under the agencies of
warmth and moisture speedily assuming a suitable condition for
nourishing a new vegetation.

The excrements of domestic animals, containing, as they do, all the
ingredients of plants, and those in greatest relative amount which
veget: ition is obliged to seek for in the soil, constitute the most gen-
erally and durably efficient manure in countries like our ow n, where
cattle are largely depended upon as means of supplying food. The
dejections of man are amore concentrated and more powerful fertilizer,
and. though less adapted for maintaining the fertility of large farms
tilled by a few hands, because they are not associated with matters
that amend and modify the physical characters of the soil, are a main
reliance in countries like China, where the dense population subsists
almost exclusively on vegetable food, and under any circumstances
are an invaluable adjunct to the resources of the farmer. Human
excreta should never be suffered to waste so long as the soil is capable
of stimulation to higher productiveness.

Certain animal manures, viz., those very rich in nitrogen, though
usually exhibiting great energy of action, are liable to abuse, and often
ultimately impoverish the farmer. Peruvian guano, the excrement
of piscivorous sea-fowl, yielding sixteen per cent. of ammonia by the
decomposition of its uric acid, and the flesh, blood, hair, and wool
of animals are manures of this character. Nitrogen i is their principal
active ingredient; it passes into ammonia or nitric acid, excites a quick
growth of vegetation by furnishing abundance of material for cell
development, and at the same time rapidly solves the fixed minerals
of the sol. The latter, being as rapidly removed by the vigorous
vegetation, soon fall into a state of relative deficiency, especially on
the poor soils where these applications exhibit their effects most
strikingly; and unless restored by some other manure, the absence of
them produces the phenomenon of exhaustion.

It is an objection, indeed, commonly raised against manures con-
taining but one or a few nutritive ingredients, that they exhaust the

soil. “Obviously it is the crops, or ‘what is taken off ‘the soil, that
exhaust it; and if a manure assists a crop to rob a field, the abetting
farmer cannot rightfully complain, so long as the price of the produce
goes into his pocket, although, to be sure, there are various ways of
exhausting land, some of which are vastly more profitable than others.

The great practical lessons taught by experience and confirmed by
science, relative to the use of manures, are, save all refuse which
contains any of the elements of vegetation ; apply abundantly the mixed
ingredients of the dung and compost heaps. As concerns commercial
194 LECTURES.

and saline manures, such as guano, salt, plaster, lime, &c., experiment
with them repeatedly and accurately on the small scale, so as to learn what
the crops say about their value. Where phosphates have been heavily
applied, it is probable that ammonia or nitrogenous manures, or per-
haps lime or potash, may next exert the most beneficial action, and
vice versa. Be sure of enough, not only as regards the quantities, but
also the kinds of matters applied.

But our subject requires treatment which only a volume can give
space for. The recent progress of knowledge, thanks to the scientific
farmers and agricultural philosophers of England, Germany, and
France, demands a series of chapters on manures that are as yet
unwritten, but, when rightly produced, will be alike novel, interesting,
and useful to the true American farmer, who cultivates with equal
assiduity the ‘‘soil and the mind.’’
LECTURES
ON THE SHELLS OF THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA.

BY PHILIP P. CARPENTER, OF WARRINGTON, ENGLAND.

The pearl fishery carried on by the Spaniards in the ‘*Sea of
Cortez’’ during the 17th and 18th centuries, bore testimony to its
richness in molluscan life. To obtain the ‘‘pearl oysters,’’ eight
hundred divers were regularly employed, and the annnal value of the
exports was $60,000. So exhaustive was this fishery that it was
gradually abandoned; and the very limited trade between the gulf
ports and the Old World did not lead to more than the most fragmen-
tary knowledge of its marine fauna. A few of the shells of Acapulco
had been brought home by Humboldt and Bonpland as early as 1803;
and collections had been made at various stations on the Central
American coast by Captain Beechy and Lieutenant Belcher, R. N., in
the voyage of the Blossom, 1825-1828 ; by MM. Du Petit Thouars,
La Perouse, and Chiron, in the Venus, 1836-1859 ; and in the Sulphur,
by Sir EH. Belcher and Mr. Hinds, in 1836-1842. The shells of
Panama and the coast of Ecuador, closely related to those of the Gulf
of California, had been obtained in great abundance by Hugh Cuming,
esq., whose vast collection of shells is not only by far the largest in
the world, but, through the generous courtesy of its owner, the most
accessible to students of every nation. Scarcely any shells, however,
had been collected in the gulf, and indeed the records of scientific
voyages, rich as they are in additions to our knowledge of fresh forms,
rarely afford satisfactory data as to the fauna of any particular district.
Unfortunately, it has been the custom, in the accounts of these voy-
ages, only to describe the (supposed) new species ; besides which,
the locality marks, even if accurately noted at the time, are exposed
to many chances of error before the information is made accessible to
the scientific world.* Whether the shells of the gulf most resembled
those of Panama or those of California, (which were described by Mr.
Conrad from collections made by the late Mr. Nuttall in 1854,) was
still a matter of doubt up to the period of the Mexican war in 1846~8.
When Major Rich and Captain Green visited Mazatlan, they became
acquainted with a Belgian gentleman, M. Reigen, who had been em-
ploying himself in making a vast collection of the shells of that region.
This collection ultimately passed into the hands of a merchant who

* The works of Mr. Hinds are, however, in every respect reliable, in consequence of the
great skill and accuracy of the Jamented author.
196 LECTURES ON

divided it into two portions: the smaller was sent to Havre; the
larger, occupying no less than 560 cubic feet, to Liverpool.

A collection of such magnitude, known to have been made only at
one spot, had never before been thrown open to the public ; and,
knowing that its contents were likely to afford very valuable informa-
tion in reference to the geographical distribution of species, I em-
braced the opportunity which circumstances afforded me to pass the
whole under careful review. The result of my labors will be found
in # ‘report on the present state of our knowledge of the mollusca of
the wést coast of North America,’”’ prepared at the request of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science, and published in
the volume of transactions for 1856; and, in a more detailed form, in
the ‘‘descriptive catalogue of the Reigen collection of Mazatlan mol-
lusca’’ printed by order of the trustees of the British Museum, 1857.*
The best duplicate series, amounting to about 6,500 shells, I have
lately given to the State of New York. Having come to this country to
arrange it in the natural history rooms at Albany, Professor Henry
requested me to visit Washington, and arrange the shells of the United
States exploring expedition. For this difficult task, the sorting out
of the Mazatlan shells, amounting probably to 100,000 specimens, was
perhaps no unfit preparation.

In the present lecture, it is proposed to confine our attention to a
single shell from this collection. It belongs to a group nearly related
to the oysters, and still retains the name of Spondylus given to it by
Aristotle more than two thousand years ago, from the resemblance of
the thorny processes outside the valves to the vertebra of the higher
animals. Ihave named the species calcifer, from the use made of it
by the natives, who dive for it in order to burn for lime. _ Its solid,
ponderous growth affords a striking contrast to the great ‘‘ water-clam ”
of the Pacific islands, in which the shell-layers are generally separate
from each other.t Unfortunately the cumbrous size of these shells
led the Liverpool dealer to dispose of the whole stock before I had an
opportunity of examining them; their ignominious fate being to adorn
the ‘‘museum’’ of a large drinking saloon, the owner of which had
no idea of their scientific interest, and was unwilling to part with
any of his duplicates. The very few which fell into my possession
proved, however, to be a little museum in themselves; each specimen
so abounding in parasites, within and without, that I have described
upwards of a hundred entirely new forms of molluscan life derived
from this source alone; besides about 250 others which had been pre-
viously investigated, or which are not yet determined; and a variety of
Annelids, Crustaceans, Zoophytes, Sponges, Protozoas, Protophytes,

= Both of these works are in the library of the Smithsonian Institution. In order
to aid in their compilation, Mr. Herbert Thomas purchased for me what remained of
the Reigen collection. The first fruits of this, amounting to nearly 9,000 specimens, I
presented to the British Museum.

} A very remarkable specimen of this shell was brought home by the United States ex-
ploring expedition, in which the free as well as the attached valve displays the long, flat,

triangular ligament area, presenting somewhat the appearance of the gigantic fossil Pla-
giostomata.

and alga, which are yet awaiting the attention of naturalists acquainted
with those special departments. We propose first to examine the
creatures which make their abode on the outside of these oyster
valves.

Certain smooth, oval spaces bear testimony to the former presence
of many kinds of limpets. Some of those creatures, (as e.g. the Pa-
tella Mexicana, or giant limpet, which is sometimes a foot in length
and large enough for a basin) prefer to live on the rocks; others are
always found on dead shells; others again always adhere to living
ones. The irculation of water caused by the breathing currents of
the larger animal is no doubt congenial to their tastes. Most mollusks
have the power not only of forming, but also of absorbing shelly
matter ; and these limpets, by the constant action of their strong
muscular foot, eat into the shell of the spondylus and leave a mark by
which each species can generally be recognized. Some of them make
regular excursions to browse on the alge and nullipore which they
rasp off with their thousand-toothed lingual ribbon, always returning
to their own hole to sleep; but others appear to lead a sedentary life,
depending, like the bivalves, on whatever nutriment the water brings
within their reach. These, which go by the common names of ‘‘bon-
net,’’ ‘‘slipper,’’ or ‘‘cup-and-saucer’’ limpets, are more highly or-
ganized than their more active neighbors; the gill being a delicate
little comb at the back of the neck, and the sexes being distinct. The
Calyptreids (‘‘slipper’’ and ‘‘ cup-and-saucer’’ limpets) found on the
Spondylus valves are the most beautiful and varied that are known in
any part of the world. The shells are large and thin, delicately fur-
rowed, and as it were engine-turned with a profusion of tubercles,
which sometimes rise up into long hollow spines. ‘The colors vary
from white to a rich black-brown, or are variously mottled with sienna,
while the shape may be either an elevated cone or a widely spreading
disk. Sometimes the same individual will begin with one form and
sculpture-pattern, and suddenly change to ancther ; others again seem
to develop permanent and widely differing varieties. Occasionally a
starved or diseased Mazatlanian will present the aspect which is
normal on the colder shores of South America; exchanging its thin
texture and delicate sculpture for a coarse, solid, and nearly smooth
shell. So far the views lately propounded with such ability by the
celebrated author of the.‘‘ Voyage of the Beagle’’ meet with sufficient
confirmation ; and yet, amid all its changes, there is a habit of growth,
hard to describe and yet easily recognized by the practised eye, which
not only unites the most aberrant forms, but at once separates them
from neighboring species found on the same coast and appearing very
similar to the common observer. The ordinary plan of only preserv-
ing in collections a few picked specimens displaying marked pecu-
liarities, is by no means favorable to the elimination of truth im
reference to specific variation. These extreme forms are very natu-
rally described ag distinct species, the intermediate connecting links
not passing before the view of the naturalist. On showing to a dis-
tinguished author a carefully eliminated suite of Mazatlan specimens

coarse, arched, laminated C. Lessonii, passing through the forms C.
nivea, C. B. Ad.and C. striolata, Wke., he complained that I had ‘‘kept
all the puzzling shells.’’ In the very useful work of Messrs. H. and A.
Adams on the genera of recent Mollusca, these forms appear under
different subgenera.*- It is not fair to blame authors for these mis-
takes, which naturally result from the imperfection of the material on
which they work. But the prevalence of such errors should lead us
to embrace every opportunity of studying large numbers of specimens,
both from the same and from different localities. Patience, accuracy,
and honesty may thus render as valuable service to sciencé as brilliant
genius, and may supply the materials from which some master-mind
may hereafter develop the most important generalizations.

Those who describe species from minute differences founded on in-
dividual specimens, might do well to study the plates appended to
the ‘‘B. A. report on the West Coast Mollusca” before quoted. Take,
e.g., the Crucibulum spinosum, pl. 9. The shell is at first spiral, like
asnail. It then surrounds its entire margin with a rim, which is the
first beginning of what in the adult becomes the ‘*saucer,’’ or outside
shell; that is, the hardened skin of the animal's body; (for shells are not
to be regarded as a house constructed for the animal to live in, but as an
integral part of the animal itself, like the feathers of birds or our own
nails and hair.) At the same time it raises a slight lamina from the
labium, or ‘‘pillar-lip,’? which ultimately becomes the ‘‘cup.” At
first, however, it is like the ‘‘deck”’’ in the slipper limpets, from some
species of which it can scarcely be then distinguished. The Crepidule,
however, continue their deck in a horizontal direction, while the Cru-

Fig. 1. cibulum turns the edges upwards at a more
or less obtuse angle.’ Gradually, during the
progress of adolescence, this angle becomes
right and then acute; the outer shell mean-
while taking various forms, round, oblong, or
irregular, according to the nature of the sur-
face to which it has chosen to adhere. Often
this immature state is continued to a late
period; if permanent, it would belong to the
subgenus Dispotea (Say) of Messrs. Adams.
But, normally, the sides of the cup close in,

Crucitbulum imbricatum, jun. ani S si payde = . ra 1
Ten ee siowicptis anise hile its body becomes greatly swollen in
beginning to double in. front. This cup now assumes the form which

is always characteristic of the species under every modification of ex-
ternal growth ; being well rounded in C. imbricatum, angular at the
side in C. spinosum, and with the sides flattened against each other
in C. radiatum. In C. rude, the adolescent stage is very soon com-
pleted, and the cup is permanently detached from the side of the
shell, forming a veritable ‘‘cup and saucer,’’ one, too, after the fashion
so prevalent in America, where the cup-handle has never been formed.

*The plan adopted by D’Orbigny in his classification of Foraminifera, was to pick out
from a large mass of material the leading forms; which he grouped into genera, families,
and orders. In my brother’s papers on Orbitolites, &c , in the transactions of the Royal
Society, it is shown that individuals belonging, according to D’Orbigny, to different orders
are really aberrant forms of the same species,
THE SHELLS OF THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA. 199

It is a remarkable fact in geographical distribution, that the forms
imbricatum and rude, which are typical in the west tropical fauna of
Central America, reappear, but very sparingly on the Caribbean
shores; while C. spinosum, which is far more common, more variable,
and more widely distributed, being found (under various names) from
California to Chili, has not yet been discovered on the eastern side.
Again, the C. radiatum, which is the most delicately formed of the
whole group, confines itself to the equatorial western seas, not having
been found further north than the Panama district.

An extremely remarkable specimen of C. spinosum was dredged
by Mr. Cuming in comparatively deep water. The net brought up
a large stone ’with a small hole in it, on looking down which Mr. C.
perceived a number of spines as though a sea-urchin was lodging
there. A blow of the hammer discovered the existence of a large

cavity within, communicating with the external world only through
this narrow opening. In the hollow of this cavity lay the limpet,
turned, as it were, nearly inside out. The creature had gone to live
there when young, and being of sedentary habits it did not occur to
him that he might be imprisoned for life by his own corpulence, else
he would probably have made his escape before he had grown too
large. As it was he grew larger and larger, and as the walls of his
prison rose up round him on every side, he was obliged to flatten out
his shell till it became a plate instead of acone. «At the same time,
his body protruding into the hollow, the cup protruded along with it
till it stood considerably beyond the shell, of which it was normally
an inside partition. Thus our Calyptreid was fixed as immovably
as any Pholas, but with this difference in their condition: that the
Pholas, being designed for that kind of life, is not troubled with use-
less head and eyes, and, moreover, is furnished with two long pipes
to convey the water to and from the mouth and gills; while the Cruci-
bulum had eyes simply to stare at the wall in the dark, feelers to
push tke stone, and a long ribbon tongue, armed with hundreds of
teeth, to rasp the water. And while encumbered with these unneces-
sary appendages, he had not the bgnefit of water pipes to bring what
alone this lock-jawed subject had to feed upon. For this want,
however, the economy of the animal provided a remedy. The C.
spinocum, in its normal growth, is either spinose or not; the flatter
forms being almost always smooth. The spines are developed from
prolongations of the mantle, (or thin shell-bearing skin of the animal, )
which appear at irregular intervals, though in a regular pattern.
Sometimes the whole shell is covered with crowded prickles, (C. his-
pidum, Brod.,) sometimes a very few long spines appear at the edge
on one side of the otherwise smooth shell. Sometimes the spines are
few, large, and hollow, (C. tubiferum, Less.,) each of the outer row
communicating through a hole with the inner margin, which is after-
wards filled up. Our prisoner worked for his living by constructing
very large, long, and open spine pipes, which, instead of standing
up at right angles to the shell, were directed back towards the narrow

opening in the stone. It w ould appear that by this means the animal
was amply supplied with nourishment, for the shell was above the
ordinary size.

The most common Calyptreid on the backs of our Spondylus valves,
however, was Crepidula aculeata, Gmel. It was first described from
West Indian specimens, which are generally dead and worn, in col-
lections, and afterwards re-described from fine West Coast shells as
C. hystrix and C. echinus, Brod. The stunted Northern form was
named ©. Californica by Nuttall. The rule is laid down by some
American authors of great celebrity that no species can be common
to the Atlantic and Pacific waters. Accordingly, when the same
form reappears on the wrong shore, it is their custom to re-describe
it, there being always differences by which a few individuals can be
separated from each other. But it is well known by those who have
examined extensive series from different localities that each locality
may present the same species under very different aspects. A large
number of British shells live also in the Mediterranean, but in a
mixed collection it is generally easy to pick out northern specimens
from their southern congeners. So again the Panama shells (of iden-
tical species) can generally be separated from the Mazatlan; and these
again from those of Acapulco and Cape St. Lucas. Now if the east
and west coast shells do not differ more than those of Panama and
Mazatlan; nay, do not differ so much as those of either place among
themselves; it appears an argumentum ad ignorantiam to describe
them as distinct species, merely because we cannot tell how they have
become distributed. On comparing Dr. Gould’s descriptions of Pur-
pura pansa (Pacific) and P. patula, (West Indian,) with my own well
authenticated specimens, it appeared to me that the diagnosis of patula
was exactly fitted to the Mazatlan shells, while that of pansa belonged
rather to the shells collected by my brother at St. Vincent’s. Our
knowledge of the fauna of each region is as yet too meagre to speak
on doubtful matters with any dogmatism, but the researches of modern
geology have already determined the fact that in the tertiary (Miocene)
epoch there was a communication between the two oceans; that very
remarkable Pacific shell, Malea ringens, having been found f6ssil on
the Atlantic coast. This interesting solution of a doubtful problem
is due to the research of Dr. New berry, and is an instructive e example
of the light which different branches of study throw upon each
other. ;

We may now be allowed to predicate that old species, which have
survived since the Miocene epoch, may be expected to appear on both
sides of the peninsula; while those of modern creation may be ex-
pees to be distinct. Furthermore, the old species may be expected
to have more power of living under varied influences, and, therefore,
to be more variable in shape, and more widely diffused than those
more constant and local in their characters. The history of British
shells, which are more thoroughly known than those of any other
district in the world, furnishes. many instructive instances of these
facts. In Mr. Searles Wood’s work on the Crag Mollusca* the newer
tertiaries are divided into the Coralline crag, the Red crag, and the
Mammaliferous crag, (answering perhaps to the Miocene, Pleiocene,

* Published in three parts by the British Paleontographical Society, of which a copy
is in the Smithsonian Liban
THE SHELLS OF THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA. 201

and Pleistocene of American authors,) in each of which we have
species represented still living in the same seas or in the Mediter-
ranean or Boreal districts. If the species is in mature vigor, it may
still be found widely diffused. If, on the other hand, it be dying out
in its general area, it may preserve a lingering existence in very
remote localities which once were connected. Thus the Orbitolites
of the Paris basin is still living in the East Indies, although now
unknown in European seas; while the common gulf weed of the
modern Atlantic is believed by Prof. Forbes to be a further develop-
ment of the very same plant which floated (as now) in huge masses
in the ancient ocean of the Eocene.

When the tertiary fossils on each side of the Rocky mountains
shall have been thoroughly explored, when the age of these moun-
tains in the narrow isthmus shall be better understood, when the
deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific coast shall have
been well dredged, we may be in a position to speak with confidence
on the points of similarity and of contrast in the two oceans. At pres-
ent we can do little more than accumulate facts for future explanation.

In the case of Crepidula aculeata, however, the perfect specimens
brought by Mr. Dyson from Honduras correspond so exactly with
those from Mazatlan that it is hardly possible to resist the impression
that they are identical. Specimens from South Africa, from Sydney,
(Australia,) and from the Pacific islands also present no marks of
specific distinction. It appears to be one of the ubiquitous species,
of which several are found in various genera, and some are known to
have existed far back in time. Of this number is Saxicava arctica,
which has been found in all the three epochs of the English crag; is
now flourishing in the boreal as well as the temperate regions of Ku-
rope and America; has been found in the China seas and in Australia,
(C. testo, Forbes,) and attains respectable dimensions in the cavities of
our Mazatlan Spondylus. The Crepidula not only undergoes the
changes of form from nearly flat to deeply arched, from obese to elon-
gate, which every observer of the common slipper-limpet of the At-
lantic (C. fornicata, abundant from the icy shores of the St. Lawrence
to the tropical waters of the Gulf of Mexico) knows to prevail in that
species; but in sculpture it may either be crowded with short spines
(C. echinus, Brod. ;) or have afew radiating lines of longer spines with
nodulous interstices (C. hystrix, Brod.;) or be covered with an irregu-
lar mass of spiny knobs (normal state;) or lose the spines altogether
in roughened striew (smooth-water form;) or even become almost des-
titute of sculpture, like some northern specimens of the stunted va-
riety (C. Californica, Nuttall.) Through all these changes it is recog-
nized by its spiral stomatelloid growth, exemplifying a section of the
genus the extreme forms of which approach Trochita; and by its
beautifully waved deck-margin, which resembles a —*—. The
pointed centre, as the shell increases in size, generally leaves a char-
acteristic line on the surface of the deck, passing up to the vertex. But
often the point is rounded off, and even degenerates into a broad wave.
In one specimen, co-ordinate with this degeneracy, a sharp angle was
abnormally formed on one of the sides, so as to give the margin the
202 LECTURES ON

aspect of a brace turned the wrong way—thus —~—~ ; a very good
specific distinction, if no intermediate specimens had been found. A
series of deck margins, belonging to this and the following species,
will be found represented on plate 8 of the British Association report,

tion of the medial rib. clear portion and the
-mode of growth of the very young shell. Whatever be the abnormal
character of the adult, it did not appear that the offspring had a ten-
dency to the same degeneracy, but rather to the resumption of the
normal type. In the case of local varieties, the peculiarities are repro-
duced, because they depend on circumstances which affect all alike.
But in such cases as those under consideration, where the extremes
and all the intermediate forms of variation are found in the same local-
ity, the changes depending on the accidents of the individual, it is not yet
proved that the idiosyncracies are transmitted. In fact, the frequent
instances in which the individual itself changes its form and sculp-
ture at different periods of its life is against such a hypothesis. In
the higher animals, where there is, as it were, an innate vital power
shaped according to the species, with an additional power shaped ac-
cording to the individual, and these powers are to no slight extent
irrespective of the immediate external surroundings, there is a much
stronger tendency in the offspring to imitate the parent—as in the
black faces of the Southdown sheep, or the stump-tailed cats of the
Isle of Man. This tendency on the part of the parent to reproduce
itsel7, and even that particular phase of self which obtains at the pe-
riods of conception and gestation, culminates in man; who, of all ani-
mals, is the most independent of external circumstances. But, in the
lower forms of life, the nature both of the species and the individual
becomes more and more plastic, responding to the accidents of the
moment; there is accordingly proportionally less of the innate power
which leads to the transmission of variety. As instances of this plas-
ticity the reader is referred to Dr. W. B. Carpenter’s papers on Or-
bitolites and other forms of Rhizopods in the Transactions of the Royal
Society of London.

It is a fact worth noticing, that while some species of shells are
extremely variable, others, inhabiting the same localities, are very
constant in their characters. These are seldom widely diffused, and
are often rare in individuals. A few young specimens of such spe-
cies were found among the slipper-limpets on the Spondyli; but the
bulk of the specimens belonged either to ©. aculeata, which, as we
have seen, is a somewhat ubiquitous species, or to OG. nivea, which,
under many shapes and many names, spreads over the principal part
THE SHELLS OF THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA, 203

of the Pacific coast of America, representing there the very distinct*
C. fornicata of the Atlantic. Two extreme forms were first described
by Broderip, from Mr. Cuming’s collection: the one, C. squama, thin,
flat, and smooth; the other, C. lessonii, solid, often arched, and coy-
ered with concentric lamine. These sometimes appear at regular
intervals, and then seem to be the normal and unique sculpture of the
shell. It appears, however, that C. squama, (which is the calm water
form,) if exposed to rougher influences, arches its back, adds layer
after layer of porcellanous matter, hiding the color rays, and leaving
the margin like the edge of a quire of paper. Nowif, co-ordinate with
this laying on of extra coats, the creature advances forward, turning
up the previous portion, the form Lessonii is produced: in general
very roughly and irregularly, which is the C. striolata of Menke, but
sometimes very delicately, with fine sculpture between the lamina,
as described by Brod. It is common to find shells living for* some
time as squama, and suddenly plunging into the Lessonii types, with
one or two strong lamine. Every stage of intermediate form was
found among the Mazatlan shells. The degraded specimens of the
Chilian seas form a part of the C. protea of D’ Orbigny—a convenient
receptacle, as the type specimens in the British Museum show, for
the dead and puzzling shells which the author did not know where
else to place. The ordinary condition, intermediate between the
extremes first described, is the C. nivea of C. B. Adams. As it is
the normal state, the usual rules of priority have been set aside, and
C. nivea taken for the name of the species, leaving squama and Les-
sonii for the principal varieties. The White Slipper is known under
all forms (when in good condition) by its shaggy, light-green skin,
and by the very peculiar character of the nuclear whirls. These are
remarkably small, though the shell is large, standing out from the
surface, of areddish tinge, and crowded with regular transverse ribs.

it is obliged to develop itself longitudinally, at the same time turn-
ing up its sides in the vain attempt to get more room. The corre-
sponding slipper limpet of the Californian coast appears to have a
special fancy for this mode of life, as most of the specimens sent have
assumed the form now described. It was first found by Mr. Nuttall,
and distributed by him as C. exuviata. It was so published in Dr,
Jay’s catalogue. Dr. Gould, however, figured and described it as C.
explanata. It had been previously figured by Valenciennes, in the
Voyage de la Venus, as C. perforans, that author supposing that it
had made the burrow in which it was found. The designation repre-
senting an untruth, it must yield to the latest name, which alone is
accompanied by a description.* A very singular groove, not found
in the Mazatlan specimens, appears in all the specimens of C. expla-
nata, and gives name to the shell. It is, however, a mere accident
of growth, differing in every individual, and often not appearing till
the animal approaches maturity. A specimen, 7m situ, in the Smith-
sonian Institution fortunately reveals the cause of this unique appear-
ance. The creature goes to live at the outer or pipe-end of the
burrew of a bivalve,t which remains at the other end after the ant-
mal has perished. The growth of the shell is normal till it has
attained the breadth of the pipe, be that greater or less. It then
increases down the pipe, the vertex of the shell being always turned
towards the outer end. There is no groove at this period of its
growth; and when the vertex is rubbed off, (as it generally is in elon-
gated specimens, ) it can hardly be distinguished from similar speci-
mens of the White Slipper. But as soon as it has reached the bottom
of the pipe, where the dead bivalve (generally a Petricola, a creature
with rather short siphons) still remains undecomposed, it suddenly
encounters an unexpected obstacle. It wedges itself under this (to
it) mighty globe, and turns its delicate mantle, exuding the shelly
skin, up the sides of the new-moon-shaped cavity, but in vain. There
is nothing for it but to retrace its steps, and back out. As it does
80, every new portion, formed under the arched bivalve, repeats the
previous concave impression, and the Grooved Slipper is the result.
The sharp instrument of the ‘‘explanation’’ of one author, and the
‘‘ perforation’ of the other, is nothing but the little rounded ‘‘ clam,’’
tightly wedged at the bottom of its burrow; and the same slipper-
limpet, freely developed under unconstrained influences, is probably
the C. navicelloides of Nuttall, to ascertain the characters of which
we are still in want of perfect specimens.

* It is greatly to be regretted that in this country, where type series, named by Mr.
Nuttall himself, were readily accessible, his labors should have been so often disregarded.
On the other side of the Atlantic they have frequently found their way into the mono-
graphs, but unfortunately too late for preservation.

young ©. nivea were some which under the microscope displayed a
much larger but smooth and imbedded nuclear portion. On comparing
these with similarly situated specimens from the west coast of Africa
and from other places, I found them exactly identical. They pro-
bably belong to the C. unguiformis of Lamarck. Now, it so happens
that Provessor C. B. ee who in general described every shell of
Atlantic types as a new species, if found on the Pacific coast, in this
one instance felt constrained to adopt the Lamarckian name for the
unguiform slippers of Panama. It is not certain that in this one
instance he was correct. Some of the specimens he distributed under
that name are undoubtedly compressed and inverted forms of his own
C. nivea; for every species may take the form of unguiformis when
grown inside a dead spiral shell, especially with a hermit crab press-
ing against it. But there seems sufficient evidence to believe that
while each coast has its special species of slipper limpets, each one
of which assumes protean changes, there is this one species which
has been scattered, it may be in dead shells and on ballast, round the
world, and to be distinguished from all neighboring species by the
peculiar character of the nuclear whirls. It is too much the custom
among ‘‘collectors,’? and even among naturalists, to examine and
preserve only well-conditioned adult specimens. More may often be
learned from deformed and ‘‘ugly”’ shells; and especially from series
in all ages of development.

We might easily fill the lecture with additional particulars concern-
ing the shpper-limpets, but it is time to pass on to other matters.
There is another family, the bonnet-limpets, (Capulide,) nearly re-
lated to the cup-and-saucer tribe, but without the peculiar internal
appendage. Of these, two interesting species were found which
appear to be peculiar to the West tropical American fauna; while
others, the Hipponyx antiquatus, H. barbatus, and H. Grayanus, have
a very wide distribution in one or both hemispheres.

Differig considerably in shape, but presenting remarkable points
of similarity in the habits of the animals, are the Vermetide, (worm
shells, ) of which some interesting forms belonging to new types were
found on our Thorn- Oysters. At first sight these shells would not be
distinguished from the serpule, (shelly marine worms,) which are
found adhering to almost every dead shell from any sea-coast. The
shell-cases of both seem to crawl irregularly over the shell or stone
to which they adhere; and while some of the serpulz assume the re-
gular spiral form of the Mollusks, some of the Vermetids assume a
looseness of growth as great as that of any worm. And yet the
animals which have exuded these similar habitations from their soft
skins, are more widely removed, the one from the other, than lions
are from snakes or fishes. The Serpule belong to the same sub-
kingdom as the Insects and Crabs; and are, in fact, red-blooded worms
with ring-jointed bodies, without head or eyes, and with the nervous
system pretty regularly diffused. While the Vermetids claim kindred
with screw-shells and Periwinkles, having their little heads, with
feelers and armed tongue-ribbons, and their nervous power collected
into irregular knotted centres, The true aflinities with regard to

one species were long ago ascertained by Adanson, the very accurate
though eccentric naturalist of the west African coast. Since that
time the animals have been so far investigated that various genera
have been established by Dr. T. E. Gray and others. The typical
Vermetids begin life free, and so continue for some time, making a
delicate spiral shell exactly like Turritella. They then begin to tire
of their freedom, and long for some protecting support, They sud-
denly give up their beautiful spiral shape, and twist themselves any-
how in search of a secure foundation. Having moored themselves to
it for life they writhe in shelly contortions, crystallized (so to speak)
