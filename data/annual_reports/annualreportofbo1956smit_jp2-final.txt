Report of the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution

LEONARD CARMICHAEL
For the Year Ended June 30, 1956

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit a report showing the
activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and its
branches for the fiscal year ended June 380, 1956.

GENERAL STATEMENT

Botanists have learned in their study of the rings in the cross sec-
tions of trees that all years are not equally favorable for growth.
When sun and moisture are just right, development is best. In the
life of the Smithsonian Institution, the one hundred and tenth ring,
which is covered by this report, shows what is probably an unparal-
leled period of healthy growth in this old and honored institution.

Museum of History and Technology Assured

Last year it was possible to report that $2,288,000 had been appro-
priated to plan the already authorized new Museum of History and
Technology building for the Smithsonian. This year the additional
$33,712,000 has been appropriated to make possible the building of
this great and most urgently needed new museum structure.

The established site for this building is an admirable one. It is in
the Mall area of the Capital, near other Smithsonian buildings, and
is bounded on the north by Constitution Avenue, on the east by 12th
Street, on the south by Madison Drive, and on the west by 14th Street.
It is expected that the construction of the foundation of the building
will begin in the spring of 1957, and it is hoped that the building will
be completed in 1960.

The Smithsonian Regents selected the New York firm of McKim,
Mead & White as architects for the building. Under its direction
the development of the necessarily elaborate plans for the structure is
progressing in a most promising manner. ‘These plans are being
worked out so as to meet the requirements for the new building
that have been set by the staff of the Smithsonian Institution on the

DEC 1 - 1057
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

basis of detailed study of similar buildings and especially on the
basis of the knowledge of the objects to be displayed in it.

The Joint Committee on Construction of a Building for the Museum
of History and Technology for the Smithsonian Institution, of which
our Regent Senator Clinton P. Anderson is chairman, and our Regent
John M. Vorys, House of Representatives, is secretary, has devoted
much careful attention to the architectural problems presented by the
building. When the new structure becomes a reality, the Nation will
owe a deep debt of gratitude to the wisdom and effective assistance
that this committee has provided in the development of the new
museum. The full membership of the committee is as follows:

Clinton P. Anderson, Senator from New Mexico.
Leverett Saltonstall, Senator from Massachusetts.
H. Alexander Smith, Senator from New Jersey.
Stuart Symington, Senator from Missouri.

Edward Martin, Senator from Pennsylvania.
Clarence Cannon, Representative from Missouri.
Overton Brooks, Representative from Louisiana.
Robert E. Jones, Jr., Representative from Alabama.
John M. Vorys, Representative from Ohio.

Laurence Curtis, Representative from Massachusetts.

Now that the Museum of History and Technology building is becom-
ing a reality, we must remember that even this great structure is but
one step, although a very important one, in providing our Nation with
suitable modern buildings in which to house and display its unequaled
collections that tell the story of the rise to greatness of the United
States of America.

Other Buildings Needed

Of all the urgent additional building needs of the Smithsonian,
that which has highest priority is the expansion of the Natural History
Museum. In 1930 the two wings needed for this building were au-
thorized by the Congress. This was done because at that time—a
quarter of a century ago—the crowding of the Nation’s great Natural
History Museum had come to seem intolerable. In the intervening
years, conditions in this building have become progressively worse.
Now world-famous study collections must be piled to the ceiling in
the hallways of certain parts of this building. It is most sincerely
to be hoped that during the present year funds may be appropriated
for this long-delayed, although already authorized, addition to the
plant of the Institution.

As indicated in my report a year ago, by a special gift of private
funds an architectural study of an adequate building for the National
Air Museum was made last year. The site that had been tentatively
allocated to the Smithsonian for this building, on Independence
Avenue at 10th Street, near other Smithsonian structures, now has
SECRETARY’S REPORT 3

been declared unavailable to the Institution. Other promising loca-
tions, however, are ready for consideration. The National Air
Museum today maintains, mostly in storage for the future, effective
displays of the world’s most comprehensive collection of historic air-
craft, including innumerable devices and pieces of scientific apparatus
that are related to this important phase of modern life. It is hoped
that funds may soon be provided to make possible a suitable building
for the National Air Museum in close proximity to the other units of
the Smithsonian.

The Congress, in 1846, authorized the establishment, within the
Smithsonian organization, of an art gallery, which later was desig-
nated as the National Collection of Fine Arts. The important works
of art in the custody of this bureau are now inappropriately housed
in the Natural History Museum. A new and proper building to ac-
commodate this notable collection and to make possible the acceptance
of other available collections in the fine and decorative arts was au-
thorized by the Congress in 1938. In spite of many efforts, however,
the private funds that were expected to finance the planning and
erection of this building have not been secured. Each year pressure
from the public to make this building a reality becomes greater. Soon
some positive action in regard to this problem must be taken.

Congressional proposal has been discussed in the public press for
the establishment, possibly as a new and separate bureau of the Smith-
sonian Institution, of a National Portrait Gallery. It has been sug-
gested that this collection be housed in the old Patent Office Building.
This handsome building is now occupied by offices of the Civil Service
Commission, but it is not too well suited for a modern office building.
It is believed that this architectural monument of early Washington
could be transformed without too great cost into an admirable gallery
to house collections of portraits of Americans who have contributed
importantly to our country. The possibility that the National Col-
lection of Fine Arts could also be housed in this building deserves
study.

Besides the buildings mentioned above, additional structures are
urgently needed by the Smithsonian Institution at the National
Zoological Park. There is also continued discussion by interested
members of the public of the need for the erection of a National
Planetarium in connection with the Smithsonian’s Astrophysical
Observatory. Such a building would have great educational value
for the millions of citizens who come each year to Washington.

Rebuilding of Exhibits Continues

The program for the renovation of the exhibits in the old existing
Smithsonian buildings, which has been discussed previously, continued
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

during the period covered by this report. On March 22, 1956, the
new Bird Hall of the Natural History Museum was opened to the
public. It has been described by one internationally known ornitho-
logical expert as the most effective and most instructive museum
display of birds in the world. Dr. Herbert Friedmann, curator of
birds in the United States National Museum of the Smithsonian
Institution, is an artist as well as a scientist, and he and his associates
developed this hall in such a way as to make it not only beautiful and
eye-arresting but also instructive. The notable success of this hall,
with its many new display features, illustrates a function of the
Smithsonian Institution that is not always remembered. This is an
age in which museums are becoming very common throughout the
country. Leadership at the Smithsonian in the development of effec-
tive museum displays is thus especially important because, as the
world’s largest museum in number of cataloged objects, it almost auto-
matically sets for many other museums a pattern for guidance in
developing new and small museums throughout the country. There
is broad advantage, therefore, when the Smithsonian leads the way
in new museum display ideas as it has done in the Bird Hall and in
the other recently opened halls that are transforming the old
exhibitions of the Institution.

During the year progress was made in the renovation of the second
secion of the American Indian Hall, the Engineering Power Hall,
and the Health Hall. The notable artistic work required for the back-
grounds of the new North American Mammal Hall was produced
under special contracts. Part of the Printing Art Hall in the old
Smithsonian Building was renovated and is now open to the public.
The lights that have been installed in this hall are, so far as is known,
the first artificial illumination of any kind ever to be used in this
section of the Institution. Progress was also made in preparing a hall
displaying the style of life of the early American colonies.

Under the difficult conditions already referred to, improvements in
displays were made both in the National Collection of Fine Arts and
in the National Air Museum. Many of the plaster casts, which were
in far too great a variety of scales and which have long confused
the visitor on entering the Rotunda of the Natural History Museum,
have been placed on exhibit. elsewhere or are in storage.

Rehabilitation of the structures of the older Smithsonian buildings
went on during the year covered by this report. Painting of the re-
maining halls and courts in the Arts and Industries Building, started
last year, was completed. It is believed that some of this painting,
such as that on the underportions of the roofs, is possibly the first since
the building was completed in 1878. New and safer entrance and
exit doors were installed in this building.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 5

Nine halls of the Natural History Building were also repainted,
and a contract was let for the urgently needed repair of the roof of
this great structure. The ancient so-called “converter” heating system
of this building was modernized and made more economical. Steam
lines in various buildings, which were in a dangerous condition, were
replaced.

Work on the air-conditioning of the Freer Gallery of Art was
begun. The air-conditioning of this building will protect the price-
less objects of art contained in the Freer collections which were deteri-
orating under the extremes of temperature and humidity of Washing-
ton. Also, possibly for the first time since this building was opened,
the gallery has been completely repainted, and its library has been
renovated and provided with adequate lighting fixtures. Modern rest
rooms for the public were opened in the Natural History Building and
in the old Smithsonian Building.

Research in Astrophysics

It is always important to remember that Smithson, in establishing
his institution, and the Congress, in founding it, directed that it should
not only “diffuse knowledge” but also “increase knowledge.” During
the current year, effective research has continued in all the scientific
and artistic departments of the Institution. A particularly notable
development, as is indicated in the detailed report that follows (p. 65)
has taken place in the program of the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory.

Astrophysics has long been one of the principal research activities
of the Institution. With the retirement a year ago of Loyal B.
Aldrich as head of this bureau, it became clear that, because of the
growing importance of astrophysics in national defense as well as in
pure science, the future program of this bureau required careful study.
With the assistance of Mr. Aldrich, authorities in this field were con-
sulted and it was agreed that the time was ripe to expand both the
bureau’s facilities and programs. The Smithsonian was fortunate
in securing as director Dr. Fred L. Whipple, then chairman of the
Department of Astronomy at Harvard University. The scientific
headquarters of the Observatory have been moved from temporary
buildings behind the old Smithsonian Building to more adequate
quarters in immediate association with the Harvard College Observa-
tory in Cambridge, Mass. By this physical change, the Astrophysical
Observatory of the Smithsonian Institution, without compromising its
independence, has gained the advantage of close association with an
active group of scientists in the mathematical and physical as well as
astronomical sciences. Without such association, modern advances
in astrophysics are severely handicapped.
6 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

Dr. Finley Retires

The National Gallery of Art, a bureau of the Smithsonian, has had
a notable year. The art world has been saddened by the fact that at
the close of June, the Director of the National Gallery, Dr. David E.
Finley, whose unremitting labor has done so much to make this insti-
tution world famous, reached retirement age. It is most gratifying
to announce, however, that this important post has been filled by the
promotion of John Walker, Chief Curator of the Gallery, to the post
of Director. Mr. Walker has been connected with the Gallery from
its beginning and brings to his new post an outstanding international
reputation as a student of art.

Financial Support

Grants continue to be made to the Smithsonian by private founda-
tions, by individuals, and by other agencies in support of specific
service functions, such as the Bio-Sciences Information Exchange,
and many research projects. One of the most interesting of these
grants names the Smithsonian Institution as the agency to organize
throughout the world the program of observing the artificial earth
satellites that are to be launched under the auspices of the International
Geophysical Year. The fact that the Smithsonian Institution was
selected for this important function attests the recognition accorded
to it by the scientists who are responsible for this great and novel
project.

Detailed reports of all the ten bureaus under the direction of the
Smithsonian Institution follow. In addition, there are included a
report on the Smithsonian Library (p. 193) and a report of the Edi-
torial and Publications Division (p. 197) with a complete list of the
publications issued during the year. These publications have had a
most enthusiastic reception by the scientific and learned world.

In concluding this general introduction to the 1956 Smithsonian
Annual Report, it is impossible to resist an expression of deep appre-
ciaton to the Regents of the Institution for all that they have done
during the current year to advance the welfare of the Smithsonian.
The executive committee of the Board of Regents has been most active
and effective in the difficult tasks of managing the details of the private
funds of the Institution. In many other ways the Regents, not only
as a corporate body but also as individuals, have made possible the
really memorable advances in the Smithsonian that are recorded in
this report of the operations of its one-hundred and tenth year.

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846,
in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson, of Eng-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 74

land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian
Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting the trust,
Congress determined that the Federal Government was without au-
thority to administer the trust directly, and, therefore, constituted
an “establishment” whose statutory members are “the President, the
Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive

departments.”
THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The affairs of the Institution are administered by a Board of Regents
whose membership consists of “the Vice President, the Chief Justice
of the United States, and three members of the Senate, and three
members of the House of Representatives; together with six other
persons, other than members of Congress, two of whom shall be resi-
dent in the city of Washington and the other four shall be inhabitants
of some State, but no two of them of the same State.” One of the
Regents is elected Chancellor of the Board. In the past the selection
has fallen upon the Vice President or the Chief Justice.

The past year brought the resignation of a highly valued member
of the Board, Dr. Vannevar Bush, who had been a Regent since April
5, 1940. He was also a member of the executive committee of the
Board and in this capacity, too, rendered distinguished and outstand-
ing service to the Institution.

The Board is honored to welcome as new members the following:
Everette Lee DeGolyer, to succeed Harvey N. Davis, deceased ; Craw-
ford Hallock Greenewalt, to succeed Vannevar Bush, resigned; and
Caryl Parker Haskins, to succeed Owen Josephus Roberts, deceased.

The annual informal dinner meeting of the Board was held in the
main hall of the Smithsonian Building on the evening of January 12,
1956, amid various exhibits showing phases of the work being carried
on at present. Brief talks on their special fields of research and ac-
tivities were made by two staff members: Dr. T. Dale Stewart and
Dr. Fred L. Whipple.

The regular annual meeting of the Board was held on January 13,
1956. At this meeting the Secretary presented his published annual
report on the activities of the Institution and its bureaus; and Robert
V. Fleming, chairman of the executive and permanent committees of
the Board, presented the financial report for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1955.

The roll of Regents at the close of the fiscal year was as follows:
Chief Justice of the United States Earl Warren, Chancellor; Vice
President Richard Nixon; members from the Senate: Clinton P. An-
derson, Leverett Saltonstall, H. Alexander Smith; members from

412575—57—_2
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

the House of Representatives: Overton Brooks, Clarence Cannon,
John M. Vorys; citizen members: Arthur H. Compton, Everette Lee
DeGolyer, Robert V. Fleming, Crawford H. Greenewalt, Caryl P.
Haskins, and Jerome C. Hunsaker.

FINANCES

A statement on finances, dealing particularly with Smithsonian pri-
vate funds, will be found in the report of the executive committee of
the Board of Regents, page 204.

VISITORS

Visitors to the Smithsonian group of buildings during the year
reached an all-time high of 4,145,591, which was approximately a
quarter of a million more than the previous year. April 1956 was the
month of largest attendance, with 667,752; May 1956 second, with
597,566; June 1956 third, with 489,999. Largest attendance for a
single day was 54,466 for March 31,1956. Table 1 gives a summary of
the attendance records for the five buildings. These figures, when
added to the 3,788,229 estimated visitors at the National Zoological
Park and 1,013,246 recorded at the National Gallery of Art, make a
total number of visitors at the Smithsonian of 8,947,066.

LECTURES

In 1931 the Institution received a bequest from James Arthur, of
New York City, a part of the income from which was to be used for
an annual lecture on some aspect of the study of thesun. The twenty-
third Arthur lecture was delivered in the auditorium of the Natural
History Building on the evening of April 26, 1956, by Dr. Donald H.
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

Menzel, director of the Harvard College Observatory, Cambridge,
Mass. This illustrated lecture, on the subject “The Edge of the Sun,”
will be published in full in the general appendix of the Annual Report
of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution for 1956.

John K. Marshall, of the Peabody Museum, Cambridge, Mass.,
showed his color film “The Hunters—African Bushmen” before a
large audience in the Natural History Building auditorium on the
evening of February 9, 1956. This showing was under the joint
sponsorship of the Smithsonian Institution and the Anthropological
Society of Washington.

Prof. Millar Burrows, chairman of the Department of Near Eastern
Languages, Yale University Graduate School, delivered his lecture on
“The Dead Sea Scrolls” before an overflow audience in the Natural
History Building on the evening of February 29, 1956. This lecture
was sponsored jointly with the Archaeological Institute of America.

Dr. Gunnar Thorson, of the Zoological Museum, Copenhagen, Den-
mark, on the evening of May 10, 1956, lectured on the subject “The
Relationship Between Prey and Predator on the Sea Bottom” in the
auditorium of the Natural History Building. This was one of a series
of lectures that this distinguished foreign scientist delivered in
America that season.

Several lectures were also sponsored by the Freer Gallery of Art and
the National Gallery of Art. These are listed in the reports of these

bureaus.
BIO-SCIENCES INFORMATION EXCHANGE

The Bio-Sciences Information Exchange continued during the year
under the directorship of Dr. Stella L. Deignan. This agency operates
within the Smithsonian Institution under funds made available to the
Institution by other governmental agencies. By performing the
unique function of effecting an exchange of information on work just
beginning or not yet published, it serves as a clearinghouse for current
research in the biological, medical, and psychological sciences. Its
services are provided, free of charge, to investigators associated with
recognized research institutions in the United States and abroad.

The body of information within the Exchange now consists of brief
abstracts of over 10,000 active research projects and of a somewhat
greater number of summary statements on investigations which are
no longer current. The studies registered with the Exchange are for
the most part being carried out in laboratories in the United States.

Requests for information on work in scientific fields come to the
Exchange from granting agencies, committees, and from individual
investigators. For the first two groups, detailed surveys of current
work in broad fields are provided; for the individual investigator the
service is limited to information on work on one or a series of specifi-
SECRETARY'S REPORT it

cally defined problems. The purpose is not that of a reference library
to provide guidance to publications, but to place investigators in
contact with others having immediate and similar interests.

During the fiscal year 1956 replies to over 900 requests for subject
information were supplied by the Exchange. Among these were
requests for rosters of scientists to be used in planning symposia, con-
ferences, and international scientific meetings, and calls from scientists
abroad who were planning itineraries for visiting United States
laboratories, as well as from investigators planning problems and
wishing to know of others in related fields.

A primary purpose of the Exchange is to prevent the inadvertent
duplication of support by granting agencies of a field of research or
of an investigator. To carry out this responsibility, the Exchange
prepares, at the request of government and nongovernment granting
agencies, résumés of the support of men, research institutions, and
departments of such institutions. Approximately 7,500 such reports
were prepared during the year.

Because a large proportion of the research registered is supported
by grants and contracts, the Exchange prepares for its cooperating
agencies and, within the limits of its charter, for other qualified groups,
statistical information on the amount and distribution of research
support. As a correlation to liaisons with granting agencies, it pro-
vides also a considerable body of information on the general policies
of granting agencies. As staff and time permit, this information is
employed to aid scientists in locating possible sources of support.

JUNIOR LEAGUE DOCENT ACTIVITIES

In the fall of 1955, through the cooperative assistance of the Junior
League of Washington, a program was inaugurated for a volunteer
docent or educational guide service in Smithsonian exhibition halls
for elementary school children in the Greater Washington area. Such
a service has long been needed at the Institution. The project is one
of many voluntary programs undertaken by members of the Junior
League.

This program is under the immediate supervision of Frank M.
Setzler, head curator of the National Museum’s department of anthro-
pology, who undertook the task in addition to his regular duties.
Representing the Junior League are Mrs. Robert Nelson, Jr., chair-
man of the project, and Mrs. Alexander Chilton, vice chairman. They
organized the volunteers and met frequently with the Secretary,
Mr. Setzler, and other Museum officials concerned with procedures
and scripts.

To begin the program, two of the recently modernized exhibition
halls were selected—the Hall of American Indians and the First
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

Ladies Hall. The professional staff of the Smithsonian Institution
prepared the scripts used by the docents. All the drudgery of organ-
izing the tours, notifying the various elementary school systems in
the District and those in the adjoining counties of Maryland and
Virginia, and making all tour arrangements with the school teacher
and respective docent, was graciously assumed by Mrs. Nelson and
Mrs. Chilton.

On January 25, 1956, the first trial was held in the American Indian
Hall, and the first official scheduled tours began February 20. The
following Junior Leaguers served as docents in the American Indian
Hall: Mrs. George Goodrich, Mrs. William McClure, Mrs. Robert
McCormick, Miss Mary McNeil, Mrs. John Manfuso, Mrs. John Mash-
burn, Mrs. Robert Nelson, Mrs. Bolling Powell, Mrs. Walter Slowin-
ski, and Mrs. George Wyeth.

During the final stages of completing the First Ladies Hall, a
script was prepared emphasizing in this unique display graphic por-
trayals of interesting episodes in our American history. The program
for fifth- and sixth-grade pupils was inaugurated on March 29, 1956.
The following served as docents in the First Ladies Hall: Mrs. Alex-
ander Chilton, Mrs. William Evers, Mrs. Walter Graves, Mrs. Harold
Hull, Mrs. John W. Kern, III, Miss Mary L. Krayenbuhl, Mrs. Peter
MacDonald, Mrs. Jay B. L. Reeves, and Mrs. John Schoenfeld.

In reviewing the number of tours and children accommodated in
this short period, I am extremely pleased with the response and yet
somewhat chagrined that the Institution has not been able in the past
to offer more of this kind of service. The numerous requests for
it only accentuate the acute need for this type of educational pro-
gram. Moreover, it becomes especially desirable as we continue to
modernize our exhibition halls. During the 3-month period in the
American Indian Hall the Junior League completed 58 tours, escort-
ing over 3,000 third- and fourth-grade pupils. During the 2%-
month period in the First Ladies of the White House Hall, 44 tours
guided over 1,500 elementary school classes.

One of the most encouraging features resulting from a final con-
ference before the summer vacation period began was the manifest
enthusiasm on the part of the Junior Leaguers to continue this school
guide service in the aforementioned two halls and to extend the pro-
gram to other new halls as they are completed and opened to the
public.

In many ways the project has been the culmination of several years
of hopes, desires, and plans for assisting school children in under-
standing the Smithsonian’s new and modernized exhibition halls.
I feel confident that the members of the Board of Regents join with
me in expressing gratitude to the members of the Junior League

SECRETARY’S REPORT 13

Docent Service and those members of our professional staff who par-
ticipated in the establishment of one more educational program within
the Smithsonian Institution.

SUMMARY OF THE YEAR’S ACTIVITIES OF THE INSTITUTION

National Museum.—Accessions to the national collections showed
a normal growth, slightly more than 900,000 specimens being added
during the year. The total catalog entries in all departments now
number 43,756,010. Some of the year’s outstanding accessions in-
cluded: In anthropology, collections of ethnological material from the
Sudan, Peru, and New Zealand, fine lots of pottery and ceramic tiles,
a collection of Mexican jadeite, a series of pathological human bones
from Illinois, and a group of early Eskimo skeletons; in zoology, valu-
able collections of mammals from Siam and Africa, a Ross seal from
the Antarctic, a giant sea bass from the Marshall Islands, a collection
of over 230,000 termites, and more than 10,000 invertebrates from the
Antarctic; in botany, the James Smith Memorial Collection of fossil
diatoms from the Philippines and important lots of plants from
Brazil, New Guinea, Australia, Idaho, and Alaska; in geology, an
exhibit of synthetic diamonds, 11 meteorites new to the Museum, sev-
eral thousand miscellaneous but important invertebrate fossils in-
cluding many type specimens, a notable collection of fossil fishes and
reptiles from Kansas, and an example of a very rare Middle Eocene
bowfin from Wyoming; in engineering and industries, an unusual
number of turbine and other power machines; and in history, additions
to the collection of White House state china, more than 30,000 phila-
telic specimens lent by former Postmaster General James A. Farley,
including original, autographed sketches of stamps made by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Members of the staff conducted fieldwork in Peru, Europe, Canada,
Palau Archipelago, Libya, West Indies, Panama, and many parts of
the United States.

The exhibits-modernization program was successfully continued,
and the new Bird Hall was opened to the public.

Bureau of American Ethnology.—The staff members of the Bureau
continued their researches and publication in ethnology and arche-
ology: Dr. Stirling his Panamanian studies, Dr. Roberts his work as
Director of the River Basin Surveys, Dr. Collins his archeological
fieldwork in the Hudson Bay area, and Dr. Drucker his Mexican
studies.

Astrophysical Observatory.—Scientific headquarters of the Observ-
atory were moved to Cambridge, Mass., at the beginning of the year.
Broadened research programs of the agency now include not only
strictly solar research but also meteoritic studies and studies of the
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

higher atmosphere. The Observatory is also participating in the
new Satellite Tracking Program of the International Geophysical
Year. The division of radiation and organisms continued its research
on the role of light in regulating growth in higher plants.

National Collection of Fine Arts—The Smithsonian Art Commis-
sion accepted for the Gallery 1 oil painting, 3 miniatures, a German
antique cabinet, a collection of 31 pieces of glassware, 2 ceramic pieces,
and 8 bronze busts. The Gallery held 13 special exhibits during the
year, while the Smithsonian Traveling Exhibition Service circulated
72 exhibitions, 71 in the United States and 1 abroad.

Freer Gallery of Art.—Purchases for the collections of the Freer
Gallery included Chinese bronzes, paintings, and pottery; Japanese
lacquer work, metalwork, and painting; Indian and Syrian metal-
work; Coptic painting; and Persian pottery. The Gallery continued
its program of illustrated lectures in the auditorium by distinguished
scholars in Eastern art.

National Air Museum.—All the Museum’s stored materials have
now been moved to the storage facility at Suitland, Md. During the
year 118 specimens in 45 separate accessions were added to the aero-
nautical collections, including the first Pitcairn autogiro constructed
in America, a Stearman-Hammond airplane of the 1930’s, the Curtiss
Robin monoplane Ole Miss, which established an endurance record in
1935, an original amphibious aircraft of 1909-12, and a Bell P-39
Airacobra, besides many scale models and other aeronautical acces-
sories and equipment.

National Zoological Park.—The Zoo accessioned 1,710 individual
animals during the year, and 2,155 were removed by death, exchange,
or return to depositors. The net count at the close of the year was
2,965. Noteworthy among the additions were a pair of European
wisents, a rare dwarf Bolivian armadillo, an olingo from Colombia,
fine examples of gelada baboons, and a Guianan crested eagle. In all,
252 creatures were born or hatched at the Zoo during the year—77
mammals, 43 birds, and 182 reptiles. Visitors totaled 3,788,229.

Canal Zone Biological Area—Mr. Zetek, longtime resident man-
ager, retired at the end of May. He is succeeded by Dr. Carl B.
Koford. The year’s visitors to the island totaled 440, of whom about
50 were scientists using the station’s facilities for special researches.

International Exchange Service.—As the official United States
agency for the exchange of governmental, scientific, and literary
publications between this country and other nations, the International
Exchange Service handled during the year 1,161,855 packages of such
publications, weighing 803,056 pounds, about the same as last year.
Consignments were made to all countries except China, North Korea,

SECRETARY’S REPORT 15

Outer Mongolia, Communist-controlled areas of Viet-Nam and Laos,
and the Haiphong Enclave.

National Gallery of Art—The Gallery received 477 accessions dur-
ing the year, by gift, loan, or deposit. Ten special exhibits were held,
and 23 traveling exhibitions of prints from the Rosenwald Collection
were circulated to other galleries and museums. Exhibitions from the
“Index of American Design” were given 42 bookings in 20 States and
the District of Columbia. Nearly 46,000 persons attended the various
tours conducted by Gallery personnel, and the 42 Sunday-afternoon
lectures in the auditorium attracted 9,470. The Sunday-evening
concerts in the east garden court were continued.

Library.—A total of 78,715 publications were received by the Smith-
sonian library during the year. In all, 237 new exchanges were ar-
ranged. Among the gifts were several private collections of valuable
material, both of books and periodicals. At the close of the year the
holdings of the library and all its branches aggregated 956,157 vol-
umes, including 586,447 in the Smithsonian Deposit in the Library of
Congress but excluding unbound periodicals and reprints and sepa-
rates from serial publications.

Publications.—Seventy-four new publications appeared under the
Smithsonian imprint during the year (see Report on Publications,
p- 197, for full list). Outstanding among these were “The Brome-
liaceae of Brazil,” by Lyman B. Smith; “The Last Cruise of H. M. S.
Loo,” by Mendel L. Peterson; “Chazyan and Related Brachiopods”
(2 vols.) by G. Arthur Cooper; “The Honey-Guides,” by Herbert
Friedmann; “The Diné: Origin Myths of the Navaho Indians,” by
Aileen O’Bryan; and “Chinese Porcelains from the Ardebil Shrine,”
by John Alexander Pope. In all, 424,389 copies of printed matter
were distributed during the year.
Report on the
United States National Museum

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the condi-
tion and operations of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1956:

COLLECTIONS

During the year 905,473 specimens were added to the national col-
lections and distributed among the six departments as follows: An-
thropology, 19,371; zoology, 409,127; botany, 32,616; geology, 48,900;
engineering and industries, 4,292; history, 391,167. This increase is
smaller than last year, when the unusual increase resulted from the
accession of several million small fossils. This year’s total is a more
normal annual accretion. Most of the accessions were received as
gifts from individuals or as transfers from Government departments
and agencies. The Annual Report of the Museum, published as a
separate document, contains a detailed list of the year’s accessions, of
which the more important are summarized below. Catalog entries in
all departments now total 43,756,010.

Anthropology.—Awmong the outstanding accessions received in the
division of ethnology is a collection of specimens from the environs
of Nasir on the Sabat River in South Sudan, East Africa, presented
by Rev. A. MacRoy, an American missionary. These come from an
area hitherto unrepresented in the national collections. An interest-
ing object is a much-worn leopard skin, a traditional court accessory,
on which the witness sits while giving evidence during a trial. A
perjurer would be subject to dire consequences if he gave false evi-
dence while sitting on this leopard skin. Rings perforating one cor-
ner indicate the number of occasions the skin has been used by wit-
nesses. Another item, significant of the culture of the Nuer, is a fight-
ing bracelet of brass, generally worn on the right wrist by men and
women alike.

While building a railroad in about 1910, Alexander J. Norris col-
lected objects used in the daily life of the Arawak Indians living in
the colony of Perené in the watershed of the Rio Perené (upper Uca-
yali River), and from the Quechua Indians in the vicinity of Cuzco,
Peru. These ethnological specimens consist of hunting and fishing
weapons, woven ponchos, and various objects of personal adornment,

presented by Mr. and Mrs. Joseph C. Green. Another acquisition of
note, a stylistically carved wooden treasure box, “waka,” originally
presented to President Calvin Coolidge by the assembled chiefs of the
Arawa, was transferred from the Department of State. The Arawa,
a federation of Maori tribes living on the east coast of New Zealand’s
North Island, claim descent from members of the Arawa, the legend-
ary voyaging canoe that brought the Maori to New Zealand. A
notable collection of ceramic tiles given to the division by E. Stanley
Wires, ranges from early Moorish, Spanish, and Dutch tiles to Amer-
ican types of recent manufacthure. They are the result of Mr. Wires’s
lifetime interest in the history of tile manufacturing. Through the
efforts of Mr. Wires, the tile collection was further enhanced by a pair
of ceramic tile panels with animal designs in relief, sculptured by the
late Frederick G. R. Roth and presented by his widow.

Other donations to the ethnological collections include a total of
170 examples of Rockwood and other late nineteenth century and early
twentieth century pottery assembled by the late Dr. Edwin Kirk and
presented by his widow, Mrs. Page Kirk; 17 examples of stoneware
and pottery made by country potters in Maryland, Pennsylvania, and
West Virginia, given by Clyde N. Fahrney; and numerous glass and
ceramic specimens together with documented papers and account books
presented by Miss Madeleine Wilkinson.

The division of archeology received a collection of 187 polished
jadeite and other stone objects from La Venta, Tabasco, Mexico, as a
permanent loan from the Museo Nacional, Mexico. ‘These include
beads, celts, figurines, ear-spool parts, and other objects representing
the prehistoric Olmec culture of southeastern Mexico. A group of
conch-shell segments elaborately carved with anthropomorphic and
ceremonial art motifs in the style of the late prehistoric Southern
Cult, from the Spiro Mound, near Spiro, Okla., was received as an
indefinite loan from the Lightner Museum of Hobbies, St. Augustine,
Fla. <A large collection of pre-Spanish Peruvian artifacts consisting
of carved wood, metal, textiles, stone, and pottery, collected about 1910
in Peru by Alexander J. Norris, was presented as a gift by his
daughter, Mrs. Joseph C. Green, and her husband. A large collec-
tion of archeological material excavated from prehistoric sites on
Hokkaido Island, Japan, was generously donated by Lt. Col. Howard
MacCord, who has added many unusual objects to the collections.

A series of pathological human bones from Calhoun and Jersey
Counties, Ill., was donated to the division of physical anthropology by
Dr. P. F. Titterington. Many of the examples of pathology are un-
usual and extremely interesting from the standpoint of the history of
disease. All the material relates to a late prehistoric period. A collec-
tion of 85 skulls received from the Wistar Institute of Philadelphia
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

includes material no longer obtainable and fills some gaps in the na-
tional collections. Outstanding in this series is a group of early
Eskimo skeletons collected by the W. B. Van Valin-John Wanamaker
Expedition, University of Pennsylvania Museum, 1917-19. These
Eskimo skeletons were found at Point Barrow, Alaska, and represent
the bearers of the well-known “Old Bering Sea Ivory Culture.”

Zoology.—One of the most valuable and largest single accessions,
comprising 600 specimens collected by Robert E. Elbel in Siam, was
received in the division of mammals. Included was an especially good
series of squirrels and carnivores from localities not previously repre-
sented in the collections. Several noteworthy African mammal col-
lections included 250 specimens from Libya collected by Dr. H. W.
Setzer; 61 specimens from the Belgian Congo obtained by Dr. Waldo
L. Schmitt in the course of the Smithsonian-Bredin Expedition; and
smaller collections made in the Gold Coast by Donald Lamm and in
Kenya by John P. Fowler. From Ponapé in the Caroline Islands, a
team headed by Dr. J. T. Marshall, Jr., investigating the ecology of
the local rat populations under the auspices of the Pacific Science
Board, sent in a collection of 103 mammals. Another welcome addition
consists of a skeleton of a large sperm whale and the types of three
baleen whales presented by the Academy of Natural Sciences of Phila-
delphia. Worthy of notice also are the approximately 300 small mam-
mals collected by Dr. C. O. Handley, Jr., and John L. Paradiso at
selected sites in the Middle Atlantic States. Among the individual
accessions of outstanding interest is a Ross seal brought back by the
U. S. Navy’s Antarctic expedition. Other interesting additions in-
clude a rare big-eared bat (/dionycteris phyllotis) from Arizona, a
rock wallaby from the introduced colony on the island of Oahu in the
Hawaiian group, the type of a new shrew from North Carolina ob-
tained by Dr. Albert Schwartz, and the type of a new bog lemming
from Kentucky sent in by Dr. R. W. Barbour.

The more important of the year’s ornithological accessions consist of
145 bird skins from the Gold Coast and 137 bird skins from Burma,
both lots collected by Donald W. Lamm. Two deposits were received
by the Institution: 890 skins, 12 skeletons, 2 alcoholic specimens, 5 sets
of eggs, and a nest from Panama collected by Dr. A. Wetmore; 261
skins and 32 skeletons of birds collected in Northern Rhodesia by E.
L. Haydock. A transfer from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service
increased the Museum’s North American collection by 1,400 bird skins.

Through Dr. Hobart M. Smith, the division of reptiles and amphib-
ians received from the University of Illinois the gift of 25 paratypes of
of Mexican reptiles and amphibians. Other noteworthy gifts include
104 reptiles and amphibians from Germany and Cuba donated by Jerry

SECRETARY'S REPORT 19

D. Hardy, and 478 reptiles and amphibians from Virginia collected
by William L. Witt.

In recent years the division of fishes has received a number of very
valuable private collections. This year the largest accession, 2,550
specimens, the remainder of the collection of the late Dr. William C.
Kendall, was transferred from the University of Maine. Through Dr.
J. M. Carpenter, of the University of Kentucky, the division also re-
ceived 914 South American fishes, forming the collection of the late
Dr. William Ray Allen. Other types of fishes were received from the
California Academy of Sciences; Dr. William A. Gosline, of the Uni-
versity of Hawaii; the Chicago Natural History Museum; the Univer-
sity of Hawaii; and Herbert R. Axelrod, editor of the “Tropical Fish
Hobbyist.” Among 53 Pacific fishes transferred to the Museum by
the Atomic Energy Commission was a giant sea bass (Promicrops
lanceolatus) , the first record for the Marshall Islands. A gift from the
University of California yielded 634 fishes from the eastern Pacific.
From the Smithsonian-Bredin Expedition to the Belgian Congo, 550
fishes collected by Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt were added to the collections.
Worthy of mention also is the fine series of 1,246 Alabama fresh-water
fishes received in exchange from Dr. J. S. Dendy, of the Alabama Poly-
technic Institute.

By transfer from branches of the U. S. Department of Agriculture
the division of insects received three valuable collections: The largest
single accession in the past decade or more, consisting of over 230,000
termites transferred from the Forest Service upon the recommendation
of Dr. T. E. Snyder, one of the world’s leading authorities on these
destructive insects; over 13,000 miscellaneous specimens from the
Cereal and Forage Insects Laboratory, Lafayette, Ind.; and nearly
70,000 specimens from the Entomology Research Branch. Among the
year’s notable gifts were the 4,400 specimens consisting of 4,127 exam-
ples (including immature stages) of the family Psychidae (Lepidop-
tera) and 273 hymenopterous parasites reared from them, donated by
Dr. Frank Morton Jones; the personal collection of Dr. F. W. Poos,
comprising 3,433 miscellaneous North American insects; an important
lot of 1,553 midges (Culicoides) from Hawaii, given the Museum
by Dr. W. W. Wirth; 3,577 reared flies of the family Drosophilidae
from the Department of Zoology, University of Texas; and the second
most important collection to come from Thailand, 3,331 insects col-
lected by Robert E. Elbel with the aid of a grant from the Casey Fund.

Outstanding among the collections received in the division of
marine invertebrates were 1,709 fresh-water crustaceans and other
invertebrates obtained by the Smithsonian-Bredin Expedition to the
Belgian Congo and 267 Australian decapod crustaceans purchased
through the Richard Rathbun Fund from S. Kellner of Sydney.
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

the Indian Ocean were received from the Zoological Survey of India,
Calcutta. ‘Two comprehensive collections received as transfers—one
from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, comprising 1,269 crustaceans
and other invertebrates from survey vessel collections in the Gulf of
Mexico and off the southeastern United States, the other from the
U. S. Navy Hydrographic Office—brought to the national collections
plankton samples and other invertebrates amounting to more than
10,000 specimens from the Antarctic.

The division of mollusks was fortunate in receiving considerable
material from regions poorly represented in its collections. An ex-
change from the Bernice P. Bishop Museum yielded 531 specimens
from the Bonin Islands; 600 marine mollusks from Kuwait at the
head of the Persian Gulf were sent in by Harrison M. Symmes;
and 447 land and marine mollusks from Libya were collected
for the Museum by Dr. Henry W. Setzer. Fine series of North
American shells were received: 4,150 specimens from Arkansas in-
cluding some paratypes from Henry E. Wheeler; 262 miscellaneous
mollusks, including 4 holotypes of the new species of the genus
Conus, donated by Dr. Jeanne S. Schwengel. For the helmintholog-
ical collections Dr. Edwin J. Robinson, Jr., contributed the types of
two new species of trematodes, and Prof. Helen I. Ward sent in the
holotype of a new acanthocephalan. A specimen of the rare deep-
water coral Pocillopora modumanensis Vaughan was donated to the
coral section by the Bernice P. Bishop Museum.

Botany.—Notable gifts to the National Herbarium were 1,298 speci-
mens of Brazilian plants, many from remote areas, contributed by
the Instituto Agronomico do Norte, Belém, Brazil; and 823 grasses
given by the Welsh Plant Breeding Station, University College of
Wales, as voucher material of cytogenetic studies of Zoliwm and
Festuca. A fine collection consisting of 420 slides and 56 photomicro-
graphs of fossil diatoms from the Summulong Shale of the Philippine
Islands was presented by Col. William D. Fleming. This accession
was assembled by the late James Smith, of Pasadena, Calif., and will
SECRETARY’S REPORT pA

be kept intact as a unit to be known as the James Smith Memorial
Collection. C. V. Morton obtained 1,066 specimens of plants on his
collecting trip to the Sawtooth Wilderness Area, Idaho.

Significant material from the Guayana Highland area, Venezuela,
included 1,341 specimens sent by the New York Botanical Garden in
exchange or with a request for identifications; and 330 specimens
received from the Chicago Natural History Museum as a gift for
names.

A valuable collection of 1,000 Brazilian plants collected by Amaro.
Macedo was purchased by the Museum. More than 900 plants of Fiji
and New Caledonia collected by H. S. McKee were acquired in part
by purchase, in part for identification, and in part in exchange from
the Botanical Gardens, Department of Agriculture, Sydney, Aus-
tralia.

Among the numerous exchanges were 1,285 plants of New Guinea

tional Park Service; and 1,197 plants of Micronesia collected by F. R.
Fosberg from the Geological Survey.

Geology.—Specimens of great scientific and historical value, made
by the General Electric Co. and described by them as the first syn-
thetic diamonds, make up one of the most unusual and interesting
items added to the mineral collection in recent years. Among other
fine and rare minerals received as gifts are: From Prof. A. Schoep
a specimen of his new species likasite, a complex copper nitrate from
the Belgian Congo; from Prof. F. Heide crystals of his new iron-
boracite (ericaite) from the South Harz District, Germany; and
several large masses of jadeite from a newly discovered locality in
Guatemala, collected for the Museum by James Dupont.

Among the 564 specimens added to the Roebling collection were
some of outstanding exhibition quality, including an 18-inch pink
tourmaline crystal from Mozambique, a flawless peridot crystal from
Burma weighing 455 carats, and a magnificent group of unusually
large autunite crystals from the Daybreak mine near Spokane, Wash.
From the led-zinc mines of Trepca, Yugoslavia, came a series of
select crystallized specimens of pyrrhotite, sphalerite, and arsenopy-
rite. A magnificent specimen of the rare paradamite from the
Ouelja mine, near Mapimi, Mexico, recently described as a new species
by Dr. George Switzer, was obtained as an exchange.

Remington Kellogg, F. L. Pearce, and G. D. Guadagni. The first rep-
resentation of an interesting fish, a suite of Leptolepis nevadensis, col-
lected by Dr. Thomas B. Nolan from the Lower Cretaceous of Nevada,
was transferred from the U. S. Geological Survey. The exceedingly
rare Middle Eocene bowfin Paramiatus gurleyi, from the famous fossil]
fish quarries in the Green River formation near Fossil, Wyo., was pur-
chased by Walcott funds.

Engineering and Industries—A large collection of hydraulic
machines from the pioneer turbine inventors Uriah Boyden, James B.
Francis, and A. M. Sevain are welcome additions in the section of

her daughter, Mrs. John A. Bartlett, and a group of woods from Flor-
ida, Texas, and Mexico, received from Orville A. Oaks.

History.—Since the Museum has in its exhibition and study groups
the only collection of White House china of any size, a concentrated
effort has been made to expand this collection. Specimens of the state
service designed for use in the newly decorated White House dining-
room at the end of the Truman administration and continued in use
as the state china during the Eisenhower administration were received
as gifts from Lenox, Inc. Received as a gift from the Polk Memorial
Association, Nashville, Tenn., is a dessert plate from the state china
used in the White House during the Polk administration. The largest
single donor of White House china was Col. Theodore Barnes, who
presented a plate and a dessert cup from the official White House china
of the Lincoln administration and two dessert plates from the state
service of the Hayes administration.

Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower presented miscellaneous costume mate-
rials, including the pin she wore as an ornament on her wedding dress
which is exhibited in the Museum. <A magnificent garnet-red velvet

EXPLORATION AND FIELDWORK

To acquaint the exhibits staff engaged in preparing the displays
which will be shown in the Cultural History Hall (No. 26) with the
relationship of styles of furniture to types of architecture and the use
of materials in the craftsmanship of the Colonial period, C. Malcolm
Watkins, associate curator of ethnology, John E. Anglim, chief
exhibits specialist, and Rolland O. Hower, exhibits specialist, in Sep-
tember 1955 visited a number of museums and historic houses in
Massachusetts. Mr. Watkins devoted the last three days in December
1955 and the first four days in January 1956 to a search for docu-
mentary data on the history of the seventeenth-century “Bookhouse”
installed in the Cultural History Hall (No. 26). He also selected and
packed the Wires collection of tiles at Wellesley Hills for transporta-
tion to the U. S. National Museum. Before returning to Washington,
Mr. Watkins examined the furniture, including Pennsylvania Dutch
material, and paintings which Mrs. Arthur M. Greenwood is prepared
to present for installation in the Cultural History Hall.

Dr. Clifford Evans, associate curator of archeology, studied the
archeological collections of the University of Florida at Gainesville
and collaborated with Dr. John M. Goggin on the analysis of speci-
mens from Trinidad which have an important bearing on Dr. Evans’s
British Guiana excavations.

During November 1955 Dr. T. Dale Stewart, curator of physical
anthropology, studied portions of the Todd Skeletal Collection at
Western Reserve University, Cleveland.

Dr. Marshall T. Newman, associate curator of physical anthro-
pology, conferred at Boston during November 1955 with members of
the staffs of the Blood Grouping Laboratory of the Children’s Hos-
pital, the Climatic Research Laboratory, and the Nutritional Bio-
chemical Laboratories of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
relative to suitable procedures to be followed in conducting physical
and other studies on the Indians at Hacienda Vicos and elsewhere in
the Callejon de Huaylas, Peru. On March 16, 1956, Dr. Newman
departed for Lima, Peru, to inaugurate a research project financed by
a grant from the National Science Foundation.

Following several preliminary survey visits in March 1956, Frank
M. Setzler, head curator of anthropology, began excavations on April
2 at the site of Marlborough, Va., which was established as a port and
county seat for Stafford County by acts of the Virginia As-
sembly dated 1691 and 1705 and which was abandoned sometime in the
eighteenth century. Marlborough was located at Marlboro Point on
the southern tip of Potomac Neck, a peninsula formed by Accokeek
Creek on the west, Potomac Creek on the south, Potomac River on the
east, and Aquia Creek on the north; the site is about 13 miles east of
26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

Fredericksburg. The investigation is being carried on in collabora-
tion with Prof. Oscar H. Darter, department of history, Mary Wash-
ington College, and C. Malcolm Watkins, associate curator of
ethnology, U. S. National Museum, under a grant from the American
Philosophical Society. The excavations have revealed the foundation
of a house of large size which seems definitely to have been the one
occupied by John Mercer during the first half of the eighteenth cen-
tury. This determination is based mainly on documentary records
together with cultural objects found, such as wine bottles bearing
seals with Mercer’s initials and the date 1737. A number of smaller
house sites, probably dependencies of the main house, have been
found, and in moving the earth a large amount of cultural material
of the period was discovered. The excavations also revealed a series
of walls, extending for hundreds of feet, which appear to represent
lot lines and may indicate the layout of the original town shown on
two existing surveys dated 1691 and 1781.

At the University of Michigan during the first week of February
1956, Dr. Egbert H. Walker, associate curator of phanerogams, con-
ferred with Dr. W. H. Wagner relative to certain species of ferns
found on Okinawa and the southern Ryukyu Islands, which will be
included in his flora of that region. Subsequently he worked with
Dr. F. G. Meyer and Dr. J. Ohwi at the Missouri Botanical Garden,
St. Louis, in the editing of a manuscript translation of a Flora of
Japan.

Edward C. Kendall, associate curator of crafts and industries,
systematically studied the historical agricultural implements dis-
played in the Centennial of Farm Mechanization at Michigan State
University, East Lansing, in August 1955. Consultations were held
with representatives of agricultural implement manufacturers for the
purpose of procuring historically important implements to illustrate
chronological stages in the mechanization of farming.

Dr. Robert P. Multhauf, acting head curator of engineering and
industries, consulted with Orville R. Hagans, horologist of “Clock
Manor,” Denver, regarding the repair of clocks in the national collec-
tions. At San Francisco during August 1955 he studied the exhibits
in the Maritime Museum and conferred with the director, Karl
Kortum, regarding the contemplated extensive display of land trans-
portation. Continuing his search for an old Pelton turbine for the
Power Hall, Dr. Multhauf conferred with Richard Goyne, owner of
the Miners Foundry, Nevada City, Calif., where these turbines were
reportedly first manufactured. A wooden-wheel type which may
represent one of the oldest Pelton turbines still in existence was located.
During the last week of October 1955 Dr. Multhauf visited several
sites in New England in an effort to locate old water turbines for dis-
play in the reconstructed Power Hall. Nine old sites where water
SECRETARY'S REPORT 27

turbines were formerly operated were visited. The collection of
measuring instruments at Old Sturbridge Village was studied. Brief
visits were made also to the Patent Museum at Plymouth, N. H., the
Shelburne Museum at Shelburne, Vt., in which are displayed large
carriage and tool collections, and the small museum maintained by the
Proprietors of the Locks and Canals of Merrimack River, Lowell,
Mass.

Data and ideas that contributed materially to the planning of the
new health hall were obtained by George Griffenhagen, curator of
medicine and public health, during a European trip August 11 to
September 23, 1955. Pharmaceutical and other medical collections
were reviewed in London, particularly the medical museums in the
Wellcome Building, the British Museum, and the Victoria and Albert
Museum. The recently installed apothecary shop restoration at
Leeds and the pharmaceutical antiquities in the Castle Museum and
the Yorkshire Museum were examined. At Paris, Dr. Maurice
Bouvet, president of the World Union of Societies of Pharmaceutical
History, devoted a day to the showing of materials in his personal
collection and in the Faculty of Pharmacy. At Basel Mr. Griffen-
hagen was shown the Castiglione collection of pharmaceutical majolica
belonging to Hoffmann La Roche, and subsequently he viewed the
pharmaceutical antiquities in the Schweizer Pharmazie Historische
Museum and the Historisches Museum. At Waldenbuch, Germany,
the Dérr Pharmaceutical Museum collection was the primary point of
interest. After visiting the Deutsches Museum at Munich, Mr. Griffen-
hagen proceeded to Garmisch-Partenkirchen to examine an original
Roentgen X-ray tube as well as the private collection of pharmaceutical
antiques of Franz Winkler. Particular attention was paid to the
pharmaceutical antiques and apothecary shop restorations in the
Germanisches National Museum at Nuremberg and the Deutsches
Apotheke Museum at Bamberg. Officials of the German Health
Museum, Cologne, were consulted in regard to arrangements for the
procurement of a transparent woman for the Hall of Health. The
Rijksmuseum and the Medical-Pharmaceutical Museum in Amsterdam
and the Rijksmuseum voor de Geschiedenis der Natuurwetenschappen
in Leiden were visited. Following his return to London, Mr. Griffen-
hagen reviewed the special exhibits displayed at the meeting of the
Federation Internationale Pharmaceutique.

Precise specifications for exhibits required in the planning for the
Hall of Health were requested from Dr. Bruno Gebhard, director,
Cleveland Health Museum, by George Griffenhagen and Benjamin
Lawless, exhibits specialist, during October 1955. Old prints which
will be reproduced in medical history panels were studied in the Rare
Book Division of the Armed Forces Medical Library. Mr. Griffen-
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

hagen continued on to Chicago for consultations with the staff of the
American Medical Association and with Dr. Max Thorek, founder of
the Museum and Hall of Fame of the International College of Sur-
geons. Madison, Wis., was included in this trip for consultations
with Dr. George Urdang and Alex Berman of the American Institute
of the History of Pharmacy in regard to several projects related to
the planning of exhibits.

For the purpose of advancing the planning for the Hall of Health,
Messrs. Griffenhagen and Lawless, during the period February 5-10,
1956, traveled to Boston to study the health exhibits in the Science
Museum, the Ether Dome and the Museum of the Massachusetts Gen-
eral Hospital, and the Museum of the Massachusetts College of Phar-
macy. At New York visits were made to the New York Historical
Society for materials to be incorporated in the Food and Drug Admin-
istration exhibit, to the Hall of Man in the American Museum of
Natural History, to the Hispanic Society of America Museum for data
relating to Spanish majolica, to the Wood Library-Museum of Anes-
thesiology to examine anesthesia equipment and to inspect the medical-
instrument collection of Dr. Bruno Kisch. Data relating to Italian
majolica were sought at the Metropolitan Museum. The secretary of
the American College of Cardiology, Dr. Philip Reichert, gave per-
mission for the loan of examples of stethoscope and manometer for
display in the Gallery of Medical History. Data relating to health
exhibits were obtained from the Lankenau Hospital Health Museum,
Philadelphia. The giant heart exhibit at the Franklin Institute was
studied, and visits were made also to the Pennsylvania Hospital and
the Philadelphia College of Physicians to inspect the historical
collections.

At New York, during October 1955, Frank A. Taylor, Assistant
Director, and Dr. Multhauf studied the Atomic Energy Commission
exhibit which had been shown at Geneva. In addition to a series of
plexiglass models of atomic-energy powerplants and devices for the
handling and chemical analysis of radioactive materials, exhibits re-
lating to the uses of atomic energy in medicine, agriculture, and other
fundamental activities occupied about half of the floor space.

Dr. Multhauf and Mr. Kendall during November 1955 proceeded to
the Pennsylvania State University and to the Priestley Museum at
Northumberland, Pa., to locate and examine laboratory equipment used
by Joseph Priestley and to arrange for the return to the National
Museum of Priestley materials that had been lent to that museum.

Planning of the projected exhibits for the Museum of History and
Technology was advanced by the comparative studies made by Dr.
Multhauf, during the three weeks’ tour of European museums, March
18 to May 6, 1956. He was advised that the Museo Nationale della
SECRETARY'S REPORT 29

Scienza e della Tecnica, Milan, Deutsches Museum, Munich, Technische
Museum, Vienna, and Science Museum, London, are undertaking en-
largement of existing facilities and that similar plans had been made
for the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, Paris. This ac-
tivity conveys some indication of the present lively interest in the
history of technology in Europe. The museums in Munich and Milan
are housed in buildings heavily damaged by war, but since repaired.
The exhibits techniques at Munich were very effective and represent
a marked improvement over the prewar museum. Many novel tech-
niques were noted which can be adopted advantageously. The follow-
ing museums feature physical science and the history of science: Palais
de la Découverte, Paris; Museo di Storia della Scienza, Florence;
Liebig Museum, Giessen; Scientific Collections, Landesmuseum,
Kassel; Museum of History of Science, Leiden; Teyler’s Museum,
Haarlem; Whipple Museum, Cambridge; History of Science Museum,
Oxford; and Berzelius Museum, Stockholm. The Palais de la
Découverte is a unique example of a museum that aims to instruct
in the principles of science from the simplest to its most abstruse
aspects through pushbutton and demonstration exhibits. The above-
listed museums possess unusual materials representing the science of
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Of the three marine muse-
ums visited, the Scheepvaarts Museum, Amsterdam, exihibits many
unique navigational instruments, books, and maps. The Musée de
Marine, Paris, has been renovated recently, but seems to have sacrificed
maritime history to the exigencies of exhibits technique. In the
Greenwich Naval Museum, England, the history of the British Navy
is effectively and logically shown in spacious rooms.

Print storage methods and exhibition furniture were inspected by
Jacob Kainen, curator of graphic arts, in California institutions
during March 1956. Onthesame trip his research on the life and work
of John Baptist Jackson was advanced by examination of chiaroscuro
color prints in the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts in San
Francisco. The collection of eighteenth-century color prints in the
M. H. de Young Memorial Museum and late nineteenth- and twentieth-
century color prints in the San Francisco Museum of Art, as well as
reference works in the library of the Art Room of the San Francisco
Public Library, were consulted. Jackson prints and other pertinent
material were inspected in the Los Angeles County Museum, as well
as the collections of fine and decorative arts. Early books printed in
color were examined in the Huntington Library and Art Gallery in
San Marino.

Dr. George S. Switzer, associate curator of mineralogy and petrol-
ogy, inspected the John B. Jago mineral collection in San Francisco,
Calif., during July 1955 and conferred with the owner regarding his
30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

plans for its future disposition. In November 1955 he made a selection
of minerals at Easthampton, Mass., for the Roebling collection and
also conferred with the staff of the department of mineralogy of
Harvard University.

In the interest of enhancing the usefulness of the national collection
of meteorites, E. P. Henderson, associate curator of mineralogy and
petrology, and F. E. Holden, physical science aide, were engaged from
September 6 to October 8, 1955, in inspecting the collections of the
Institute of Meteorites at the University of New Mexico, the museum
at Meteor Crater, Ariz., the Meteorite Museum at Sedona, Ariz., the
Museum at Fort Hayes, Kans., and Texas Christian University at
Fort Worth, Tex. Private collections owned by A. R. Allen, Trinidad,
Colo., H. O. Stockwell, Hutchinson, Kans., and Oscar Monnig, Fort
Worth, Tex., were also studied. Data and photographs of meteorites
for research and reference purposes not otherwise available were ob-
tained by these visits. Five meteorites were presented for the national
collections by H. O. Stockwell, two unrepresented iron meteorites by
Oscar Monnig, and one large iron meteorite by H. H. Nininger.

Prospecting in the field for suitable fish and amphibian fossils for
inclusion in the planned Hall of Lower Vertebrates was conducted by
Dr. David H. Dunkle, associate curator of vertebrate paleontology,
and G. D. Guadagni, preparator, during the summer of 1955. While
en route to Kansas, arrangements were made at the Carnegie Museum,
Pittsburgh, for the transfer on an exchange basis of specimens of
Kuropean Mesozoic holostean fishes and of late Cretaceous and Eocene
teleosts. In northwestern Ohio a worthwhile collection of disasso-
ciated fish bones was obtained at the level of contact between the
middle Devonian Praut limestone and the base of the black upper
Devonian Ohio shales formation. Through the cooperation of George
F. Sternberg, curator of the Museum at Fort Hays State College,
arrangements had been made for a camping site on the R. W. Haver-
field ranch in southwestern Gove County. From the upper Cretaceous
Niobrara chalk formation in badlands locally known as Hell’s Bar
and later in other exposures on one of the Ben Christie ranches such
typical fishes as Cimolichthys, Portheus, Syllaemus, E’'nchodus, Pro-
tosphyraena, Gillicus, and Kansanius were excavated. One of the
most unusual recoveries were entire schools of the small acanthop-
terygian fish Kansanius, found preserved on the insides of giant shells
of the clam /noceranus.

In continuation of the search for exhibition specimens, Dr. Dunkle,
accompanied by Franklin L. Pearce, in charge of the divisional pre-
paratory staff, proceeded on October 27, 1955, to Norman, Okla.,
where advice was received from Dr. Carl Branson, of the Oklahoma
Geological Survey and School of Geology, and Dr. Stephen Borhegyi,
SECRETARY'S REPORT 31

director of the Oklahoma University Museum, regarding the location
of exposures of the Permian Hennessey formation that had previously
yielded skeletons of the large pelycosaur Cotylorhynchus. Although
five specimens of this unique reptile were located, only one incomplete
young individual merited the work involved in excavation. As a
result arrangements were made with the University Museum to obtain
a skeleton on an exchange basis. Dr. Dunkle’s party then traveled to
Richard’s Spur, Okla., where 11 bags of Permian bone-bearing matrix
were removed from solution fissures in Ordovician limestone. Arriv-
ing in Austin, Tex., on November 10, 1955, they were given an oppor-
tunity by Dr. John A. Wilson to examine the vertebrate fossil
collections at the University of Texas. Preliminary conversations
were held regarding some basis for exchange of materials. On Novem-
ber 15 and 16, 1955, a brief reconnaissance of the upper Cretaceous
beds of the Big Bend area, Texas, was made under the guidance of
David Jones, assistant superintendent of the Big Bend National Park,
with a view to evaluating the possibilities for procurement of dino-
saurs which will ultimately be needed for display. An exchange of
upper Devonian marine fossils between this Institution and the Cleve-
land Museum of Natural History was completed April 16-20, 1956,
by Dr. Dunkle. Skeletal materials representing a very large shark,
Cladoselache, and the arthrodire Dinichthys were selected and deliv-
ered to the Museum.

Inasmuch as the Museum lacked a suitable representation of upper
Devonian fishes, Dr. Dunkle conducted fieldwork in the fresh-water
sediments exposed along the shores of Escuminac Bay at Maguasha,
Province of Quebec, Canada. These sediments yield well-preserved
specimens of lungfishes, fringed-finned fishes, antiarch, and, less com-
monly, acanthodians, arthrodires, and palaeoniscoids, all of which are
important in any synoptic display in the exhibition hall. Prior to
commencing fieldwork, cooperative help had been obtained from the
National Museum of Canada, Ottawa, and the Royal Ontario Museum,
Toronto. While en route to Canada, Dr. Dunkle visited the Dartmouth
College Museum to make preliminary arrangements for an exchange
of upper Silurian ostracoderms. In Canada, consultations were held
with Dr. I. W. Jones, director, Quebec Geological Survey, and with
Abbe Laverdirere, chairman, Department of Geology, Laval Univer-
sity, Quebec City. On the return trip early Mississippian palaeonis-
coid fishes were sought at Albert Mines, as well as at the well-known
Devonian occurrences at Cambellton, both localities in New Bruns-
wick. This trip extended from May 21 to June 30, 1956.

- The Walcott bequest financed the trip to a locality near Burnet,
Tex., where Dr. David Nicol, associate curator of invertebrate paleon-
tology, and Robert J. Main, Jr., aide in that division, obtained fossil
32 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

mollusks from exposures of the Glenrose formation. At Lipan, Tex.,
samples of the Pennsylvanian Dickerson shale were collected. This
trip extended from July 28 to August 13, 1955.

Income from the same bequest provided funds for the paleontolog-
ical fieldwork of Dr. G. A. Cooper, curator of invertebrate paleontol-
ogy and paleobotany. At Fort Worth, Tex., he took charge of the
Smithsonian truck and accompanied by Mr. Main proceeded to Ard-
more, Okla., where they spent three days collecting Pennsylvanian
invertebrate fossils. From Ardmore they traveled to Muskogee and
Pryor for material from beds of Mississippian age. At Neosho, Mo.,
they collected Mississippian productid brachiopods, Pennsylvanian
fossils at Bartlesville, Okla., and subsequently Permian fossils in
Cowley County, Kans. Other materials were collected in Kansas
and Nebraska, and a large collection of Mississippian fossils was
made near Harrison, Ark. This field party returned to Washington
September 17, 1955. A profitable discussion of problems involved in
his Permian studies on the Glass Mountain fauna was held with Dr.
Carl Dunbar, Peabody Museum, Yale University, by Dr. Cooper in
February 1956. An arrangement was made to secure by exchange
some examples of Greenland Permian invertebrates.

Dr. A. R. Loeblich, Jr., associate curator of invertebrate paleontol-
ogy, devoted four days, April 10-18, 1956, to the collection of Paleocene
and Cretaceous Foraminifera in New Jersey in strata that are of
disputed age. The material obtained was not previously represented
in the national collections.

Mrs. Margaret Brown Klapthor, associate curator of civil history,
was invited to lecture at the historic-housekeeping course sponsored by
the National Trust and the New York State Historical Association at
Cooperstown, N. Y., the last week in September 1955. During Octo-
ber 1955, while attending the meeting of the National Trust at Nash-
ville, Tenn., Mrs. Klapthor acquired for the national collections a
dessert plate of the Polk White House china, Mrs. Polk’s lace fan, and
a pair of spectacles owned by President Polk.

During late August and early September 1955, Mendel L. Peterson,
acting head curator of history, inspected all existing specimens of
early artillery now preserved at Albany, N. Y., the Saratoga battle-
field, Fort William Henry, The Citadel on the ramparts, Fort Ticon-
deroga, and the Plains of Abraham battlefield in Quebec, Canada,
for the purpose of advancing the completion of his report on the
marking and decoration of these military objects. Transportation
furnished by Life Magazine enabled Mr. Peterson to proceed to Ber-
muda to investigate a collection of objects of probable early seven--
teenth-century origin recovered from a sunken ship presumably of
French registry which had been wrecked there. The ordinary imple-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 303

ments of shipboard use were French, while the gold bar, cakes of gold,
gold buttons, and silver coins were Spanish.

From June 21 to November 24, 1955, Frederick M. Bayer, associate
curator of marine invertebrates, participated in a biological survey
of the coral reef and other marine habitats found in the Palau Islands
Archipelago, sponsored jointly by the Office of Naval Research, the
Pacific Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences, the George
Vanderbilt Foundation of Stanford University, and the Trust Ter-
ritory of the Pacific Islands, and directed by Dr. R. R. Harry of
Stanford University. An ecological resurvey was made of Iwayama
Bay, Koror Island, to supplement the survey made 20 years previously
by members of the Japanese Palao Tropical Biological Station. Cir-
cumscribed problems of more specific interest, such as epizootic asso-
ciates of gorgonian corals, parasitic mollusks, crustaceans associated
with coelenterates, sea anemones and their biological associates, and
the relationship of hole-dwelling gobies with burrowing shrimps,
were selected for thorough investigation. The team cooperated in
obtaining information on the injurious, poisonous, and noxious ani-
mals of the reef complex. In September Dr. Harry and Mr. Bayer
visited Japan to consult with former members in regard to the re-
search of the Palau station and to trace the location of biological
collections obtained there before War II. They returned to Koror on
October 7 and terminated fieldwork there on November 15.

Dr. Harald A. Rehder, curator of mollusks, was given a detail
September 19-29, 1955, to pack up and arrange for transportation of
a collection of mollusks at the New York State Museum that had been
transferred to the Museum on an exchange basis.

Dr. David H. Johnson, acting curator of mammals, and John L.
Paradiso, aide, were engaged from September 12 to 15, 1955, in mov-
ing and loading whale skeletons at the Academy of Natural Sciences
of Philadelphia for transfer to the Museum.

Under an Office of Naval Research contract, Dr. Henry W. Setzer,
associate curator of mammals, left Washington on September 16, 1955,
for Tripoli, Libya, to conduct the field study requested by Naval
Medical Research Unit No. 3. Fieldwork was carried on from 18
different camps ranging from Tripoli to Derma and to Sebha Oasis
in the interior. Ectoparasites and mammals were collected.

As part of a long-term project on the zoogeography of the southern
Appalachian Highlands, Dr. Charles O. Handley, Jr., associate cura-
tor of mammals, devoted the period from September 12 to 26, 1955,
to collecting mammals near Mountain Lake, Giles County, Va. Taxo-
nomic problems involving southern African and neotropical mam-
mals necessitated an examination of pertinent comparative specimens
by Dr. Handley at the Chicago Natural History Museum, January
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

16-20, 1956. During April 1956 Dr. Handley, with Mr. Paradiso as
assistant, made a collection of small mammals in the generally
neglected salt-marsh areas of the Middle Atlantic States. Particular
effort was made to secure material at Back Bay in southeastern Vir-
ginia, Assateague Island off Delmarva Peninsula, and Oceanville in
southern New Jersey.

A grant from the American Philosophical Society enabled Dr. J. F.
Gates Clarke, curator of insects, to obtain larvae and rear moths of
the family Oecophoridae and to determine the host specificity of these
moths and their relationship to plants of the family Umbelliferae.
Specimens were collected and host observations were made at 71 sta-
tions mainly in Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, as
well as at scattered localities in Montana, North Dakota, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, and Michigan.

Dr. Ernest A. Lachner, associate curator of fishes, was awarded a
fellowship by the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation for the pur-
pose of advancing his research studies on tropical marine and North
American fresh-water fishes. Examination of type specimens and
other pertinent material will be made at various European museums.
Dr. Lachner left Washington for London on March 8, 1956.

Mr. and Mrs. Bruce Bredin, of Greenville, Del., presented funds
to the Smithsonian Institution to finance a collecting expedition.
‘These funds were used to finance a Caribbean field study. The Smith-
sonian party comprised Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt, leader, Dr. A. C. Smith,
Dr. J. F. Gates Clarke, and Dr. Fenner A. Chace, Jr. The expedition
left Trinidad on March 13, 1956, for visits to Grenada, several of the
Grenadines, and Martinique. Other stops included anchorages at
Dominica, Guadeloupe, Barbuda, Redonda, Nevis, St. Christopher,
Virgin Gorda, and Tortola, and terminated at St. Croix. A number
of interesting observations of shore fauna, including shrimp com-
mensal with anemones, and windrows of red-crab megalops on the
beach were made. Several thousand crustaceans were collected by
Drs. Schmitt and Chace, as well as crinoids, starfish, sea-urchins, sea-
hares, and cephalopods. On arrival at Trinidad Dr. Smith, curator
of phanerogams, proceeded directly to the field station of the New
York Zoological Society at Simla, Arima Valley, where he spent five
days collecting plants on the crest and slopes of the northern range
and preparing the material. Botanical collections were made on 11
islands, and more than 4,000 specimens were prepared for herbarium
study. Dr. Clarke, curator of insects, traveled from Washington to
Dominica by airplane and collected insects there in the interval be-
tween March 8 and 28 and then joined the party on the schooner at
Roseau. Some 20,000 insects were obtained. V. E. B. Nicholson, cap-
tain of the Freelance, the schooner used by the expedition, was ex-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 35

tremely helpful to members of this party and materially assisted in
the collection of marine animals. Drs. Clarke and Smith departed
for Washington from St. Croix, Virgin Islands, by air on April 19
and 20, respectively. Drs. Schmitt and Chace sailed from St. Croix
on the Alcoa Runner on April 23.

Between September 2 and 26, 1955, W. L. Brown, chief zoological
exhibits preparator, visited Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks
to procure photographs and other background data for authentic
habitat settings for the grizzly-bear and elk groups. Alpine fir, limber
pine, various grasses, flowers, soils, and rocks were secured for the
bear group. At Gardiner, Mont., sage bushes and grasses were se-
lected and shipped for inclusion in the elk unit.

On December 2, Dr. Alexander Wetmore, research associate and
former Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, reached Panama
for a further season of fieldwork concerned with the distribution of
the birdlife of the Isthmus. Work during the first month was devoted
to studies on the Rio Chagres, from a base at the Juan Mina field sta-
tion of the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory for Tropical Medicine, and
other investigations in and near the Canal Zone, including a few days
on Taboga and nearby islands. At the beginning of January, through
the interest of Dr. Alejandro Méndez P., director of the Museo Na-
cional of Panama, and of His Excellency Alejandro Remén C., Min-
ister of Government and Justice, Col. Bolivar Vallarino, Comandante
Jefe of the Guardia Nacional, kindly gave the necessary permission
and instructions for a month’s stay on Coiba Island. This, the largest
island on the Pacific coast of Central America, has been the location
of the penal colony of the Republic of Panamé since 1919. With the
friendly cooperation of Col. J. W. Oberdorf, commanding officer,
Albrook Air Base, transportation to Coiba and return on completion
of the work were arranged in an Air Force crashboat. On arrival
at the Colonia Penal on January 6, Dr. Wetmore and his two assist-
ants were assigned quarters by Capt. J. A. Souza, in command, and
were given all needed assistance in their work, which continued until
February 6. The island is covered with high gallery forest, with
mangrove swamps at the mouths of the numerous rivers. Clearings
for pasture and cultivation have been cut back of the convict work
camps, which are located along the Bahia de Damas and on the eastern
side north to Punta Aguja. The interior of the island, which rises to
an elevation of 1,400 feet, remains in its primitive condition, without
trails except in limited areas. Birds are common and of good variety,
though many of the familiar forest species of the mainland do not
occur in spite of conditions favorable to them. The heavy rainfall is
reflected in darker coloration in various of the smaller kinds, several
of which are new to science, some being remarkably distinct from
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

their mainland representatives. Following return to the mainland,
work continued until the end of February, with San Félix in eastern
Chiriqui as a base. Collections made here over a considerable area
between the seacoast and the inland mountains offer many valuable
data in plotting distribution. Most of the original forest has been
cut to provide pastureland, so the information secured is of special
importance since soon all forest areas will be gone. After some furth-
er observations at Barro Colorado Island and on the savannas near
Pacora, work for the season terminated on March 10.

EXHIBITION

Modernization of selected exhibition halls was continued in 1956
by a Congressional allotment of $411,500. Construction by outside
contractors began in the Power Hall in July 1955. Contracts were
awarded for the second American Indian Hall in April 1956 and the
Health Hall in May 1956; construction was commenced in these halls
in May and June 1956, respectively. During March 1956, the new
Bird Hall and the east side of the North American Mammal Hall
were completed and opened for public inspection.

The new Bird Hall, after months of planning by Curator Herbert
Friedmann, was officially opened to the public on March 22, 1956, at
an evening reception sponsored jointly by the Smithsonian Institution
and the Audubon Society of the District of Columbia. John E. Graf,
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, reviewed the pro-
gram for modernization of exhibits, and Irston R. Barnes, president
of the District of Columbia Audubon Society, commented on the inter-
est shown by ornithologists in the methods employed for presentation
of topical exhibits. Guy Emerson, honorary president of the National
Association of Audubon Societies, complimented the Institution and
Dr. Friedmann on the successful completion of this hall and cut the
ribbon, thereby officially opening the hall.

In the hall of North American Mammals, habitat groups for the
puma, wolf, pronghorn antelope, and white-tailed deer were opened to
the public. Four previously completed groups were again shown to
visitors after being shut off by construction work for more than a year.

During the current fiscal year, 37 new exhibit units, miniature
dioramas, and life-size lay figures are being developed in the second
Indian hall. These units will portray the manner of living of Indian
tribes that formerly occupied the forested eastern third of the United
States; the nomadic hunting tribes of the Great Plains; the salmon-
fishing and totempole-building Indians of the Northwest Pacific coast ;
and the Arctic Eskimo of Greenland and Alaska. The over-all plans
for this hall and the case layouts were prepared by Associate Curator
John C. Ewers in collaboration with Exhibits Specialist John E.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 37

Anglim and his staff. The installation of the exhibits portraying
colonial life in eastern North America is proceeding satisfactorily in
Hall 26. Six period rooms have been installed. Of these the Reuben
Bliss parlor (1754) is the oldest. Among others are a late Georgian
colonial parlor from Sussex, Va., an early nineteenth-century school-
room, and a farmhouse bedroom of about 1800.

Plans were completed in the division of mineralogy and petrology
for the layout of the Mineral Hall. Exhibits to illustrate the origin,
properties, and mode of occurrence of minerals will be prepared, in
addition to displays of the major minerals of the world. Outstanding
examples of uncut crystals of the more important gem minerals, as
well as series of cut and polished gems, will be utilized to make an
informative presentation of this phase of mineralogy.

The hall for display of fossil plants and invertebrates will provide
the visitor with some concepton of what fossils are, how they are
preserved, and their role as geological time indicators. Reconstructed
assemblages of fossil animals and plants from some of the geologic
periods will be utilized to portray the ecological associations that made
possible their mode of life.

Selection and preparation of specimens of lower vertebrates for
display in Hall 3 are being actively continued in the laboratory of
vertebrate paleontology. Associate Curator Dr. David H. Dunkle
was successful in his search for upper Cretaceous marine fishes in the
Niobrara chalk of western Kansas, and for upper Devonian fishes in
the fresh-water sediments of the Province of Quebec, Canada. Other
lower vertebrates were acquired on an exchange basis to complete the
developmental series in the systematic exhibits.

A display case containing manmade diamonds sorted in compart-
ments in accordance with size was presented on May 3, 1956, by Dr.
C. G. Suits, vice president of General Electric Co., to Dr. Leonard
Carmichael, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, for inclusion
in the gem exhibit in the Natural History Building. At the presenta-
tion ceremony Dr. Suits introduced the technical team responsible for
the development of the process that made manufacture feasible.

An exhibit illustrating the history of iron and steel production in
the United States was opened on January 11, 1956, in the Arts and
Industries Building by Secretary Carmichael and John C. Long, of
the Bethlehem Steel Co. This exhibit traces in 10 units the develop-
ment of the industry from the discovery of iron ore to the high-alloy
steels of today. Outstanding features of the exhibit are a group of
early artifacts from the excavations at Jamestown, Va.; a section of
the massive Hudson River chain swung into place near West Point,
N. Y., on April 16, 1778, to prevent the British from sailing to the
upper river ; and rare examples of American iron and steel work from
the nineteenth century.
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

Modernization of the Power Hall was delayed several months by a
shortage of steel, but it is now nearing completion. Models of types
of power machinery no longer available for acquisition have been
constructed and a number of machines hitherto unrepresented in the
national collections have been acquired.

Four of the older makes of automobiles have been refurbished
during the past fiscal year. The 1903 Cadillac, the 1903 Oldsmobile,
and the 1913 Ford were reconditioned through the courtesy of the
Cadillac, Oldsmobile, and Ford companies. The 1901 Autocar was
reconditioned by the Autocar Division of the White Motor Co. The
return of these cars to the exhibition floor markedly improved this
portion of the section of land transportation.

The gallery exhibit of the section of scientific instruments now
consists of 12 units devoted to various fields, beginning with weights
and measures and ending with astrophysics. Each case is designed
to tell the story of the mechanical development of some instrument.
The section devoted to typewriters, phonographs, and calculating
machines was greatly improved by repainting and lettering, as was
the section of manufactures by the installation of special lighting
fixtures. Loom products of the early nineteenth century weaver
Peter Stauffer, the small hand sewing machine, and the safety factor
of after-dark pedestrian garments were featured in new display units
in the section of textiles. .

Of the 35 new exhibit units illustrating photomechanical printing,
in the chapel of the Smithsonian Building, 26 were completed during
the past year. Selected examples of photogravure, rotogravure, re-
lief halftone and the halftone screen, collotype, photolithography,
and offset lithography are included in the display. The special
monthly exhibits by contemporary printmakers and photographers
were continued in addition to short-term displays of materials drawn
from the collections.

Individual exhibit units for the Hall of Health have for the most
part beeen designeed, the contents have been selected, and descriptive
text for many of the labels has been written. Construction work on
this hall has commenced. A series of 30 oil paintings depicting the
history of pharmacy lent by Parke, Davis & Co. was formally opened
for public view on September 30, 1955, at a ceremony attended by
Secretary Carmichael, George A. Bender, Robert A. Thom, the artist,
and Dr. Robert P. Fischelis, secretary of the American Pharmaceuti-
cal Association.

Eleven new exhibits were installed in the gallery of Medical His-
tory during the year. An informative display unit labeled “Vita-
mins for Health, Growth and Life,” prepared for the exhibit series
of the division of medicine and public health by Merck & Co., was
SECRETARY’S REPORT 39

accepted from Dr. W. H. McLean by Secretary Carmichael on Feb-
ruary 1, 1956. The 10 principal vitamins are shown inside revolving
transparent globes. Outstanding historical facts on vitamin develop-
ment are illustrated. Display panels entitled “Dr. Wiley’s Crusade,”
“Fifty Years of Progress in Food and Drug Protection,” and “How
Food and Drug Administration Protects You Today” were formally
presented for public view on May 4, 1956, at a ceremony attended by
Bradshaw Mintner, the Assistant Secretary of the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare, Dr. George P. Larrick, Commis-
sioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Mrs. Harvey W. Wiley,
Mrs. Grace Drexler Nichols, executive director of the General Fed-
eration of Women’s Clubs which supported Dr. Wiley’s crusade, and
Secretary Carmichael. These three panels commemorate the fiftieth
anniversary of the enactment of the Federal Food and Drug legis-
lation.

Substantial progress was made during the year on the installation
of the uniform and insignia display on the West Hall gallery. Glass
screens were placed over the fluorescent lights to protect the mate-
rials from fading, printed labels were prepared for many of the
specimens, and various items of personal adornment were installed.

The United States section of the National Postage Stamp Collection
was completely remounted and placed in the floor frames for public
viewing during the past fiscal year. Special displays of postal mate-
rials were made available to the Fifth International Philatelic Ex-
hibition, held in the new Coliseum in New York, April 28—May 6,
1956, and at the American Stamp Dealer’s Association shows in New
York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.

VISITORS

During the fiscal year 1956 there were 3,520,106 visitors to the
Museum buildings, an average daily attendance of 10,028. This is
an increase of 207,236 over the total in the previous fiscal year. In-
cluded in this total are 385,187 school children, who arrived in 10,457
separate groups. Among the visitors this year were special groups
such as the 4-H Club and the Safety Patrol. The month of April
1956 drew the largest crowd with 572,368 visitors. May 1956 was
the second largest with 517,447 and June 1956 was third with 421,107.
Attendance records for the buildings show the following numbers of
visitors: Smithsonian Building, 716,048; Arts and Industries Build-
ing, 1,796,480; and Natural History Building, 1,007,578.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

A contract between the Government and the architectural firm of
McKim, Mead & White for the design of the Museum of History and

412575—57—-4
A() ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

Technology building was signed on March 16, 1956. A program of
the requirements for the building based on many years of study by the
Smithsonian staff was presented to the architects, and the work of de-
signing a building that will effectively serve the Museum and the
public is progressing well. Schedules of work anticipate that working
drawings will be sufficiently advanced to permit bids to be asked for
the construction of the building in the spring of 1957. Legislation
appropriating $33,712,000 for the construction of the building passed
both the House and the Senate in the second session of the 84th Con-
gress. This legislation (Public Law 573) was signed by the President
on June 13, 1956. The total amount appropriated for this building is
$36,000,000.

The Secretary designated Frank A. Taylor, Assistant Director of
the United States National Museum, staff liaison with the architects.
The Planning Office was established to develop plans and requirements
for the building and its exhibits. John C. Ewers, associate curator in
the division of ethnology, was promoted to planning officer, and J. H.
Morrissey, architect of the Public Buildings Service, was assigned to
the Smithsonian by the General Services Administration to assist in
the planning.

CHANGES IN ORGANIZATION AND STAFF

Frank A. Taylor, previously head curator of the department of en-
gineering and industries, was promoted to Assistant Director of the
Museum on August 7, 1955.

Charles E. Cutress, Jr., a coelenterate specialist, was appointed asso-
ciate curator in the division of marine invertebrates, effective January
3, 1956.

The department of history lost through death on February 20, 1956,
the valuable services of Stuart M. Mosher, associate curator of numis-
matics.

John C. Ewers, associate curator of the division of ethnology, was
transferred to the office of the assistant director to serve as planning
officer for the Museum of History and Technology, effective February
26, 1956.

G. Carroll Lindsay was appointed assistant curator, division of
ethnology, effective February 20, 1956.

During January and February 1956, a reorganization of the exhibits
staff was effected with the promotion of John EK. Anglim to chief ex-
hibits specialist, R. O. Hower and Benjamin Lawless to exhibits spe-
cialists, and William L. Brown to chief zoological exhibits specialist.

Dr. William F. Foshag, head curator of the department of geology
since August 1948, and a member of the staff of that department from
June 1919, died May 21, 1956, of a heart attack at his home in West-
SECRETARY’S REPORT Al

moreland Hills, Md. During the 37 years since graduation from the
University of California with a degree in chemistry, Dr. Foshag ad-
vanced knowledge of the minerals of Mexico particularly and of the
world. Borax minerals claimed his interest for several years. While
assigned for work in Mexico during World War II, he witnessed the
early stages in the origin of the Paricutin Volcano and followed its
growth until activity subsided.

Four members of the honorary scientific staff were lost through death
during the fiscal year. Dr. Theodore S. Palmer, a member of the
staff of the Bureau of Biological Survey, U. S. Department of Agri-
culture, for 44 years and an associate in zoology of the National
Museum since August 1, 1933, died at his home in Washington, D. C.,
on July 23, 1955, at the age of 87. Dr. Frank L. Hess, custodian of
rare metals and rare earths in the division of mineralogy and petrology
since December 11, 1917, died August 29, 1955, in Washington, D. C.,
at the age of 83. Prior to 1925 Dr. Hess had been employed by the
U. S. Geological Survey, and from that time until his retirement in
1944, by the Bureau of Mines. William B. Marshall, assistant curator
in the division of mollusks until his retirement in 1934 and associate
in zoology since May 1, 1934, died in Washington, D. C., on Decem-
ber 18, 1955, at the age of 91. Gerrit S. Miller, Jr., curator of the
division of mammals for 42 years and research associate of the Smith-
sonian Institution since January 1, 1941, died in Washington on Feb-
ruary 24, 1956, at the age of 84.

Report on the Bureau of American
Ethnology

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1956, conducted in
accordance with the Act of Congress of April 10, 1928, as amended
August 22, 1949, which directs the Bureau “to continue independently
or in cooperation anthropological researches among the American
Indians and the natives of lands under the jurisdiction or protection
of the United States and the excavation and preservation of archeologic
remains.”

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

Dr. M. W. Stirling, Director of the Bureau, remained in Washington
during the major portion of the fiscal year. In addition to regular
administrative duties, he continued studies on the archeological collec-
tions made in Panama during 1952 and 1953. In May and June he
raade two brief inspection trips to Russell Cave in Jackson County,
Alabama, where Carl Miller conducted archeological excavations
under the auspices of the Bureau and financed by the National Geo-
graphic Society. The services of Mr. Miller were lent to the Bureau
by the River Basin Surveys for six weeks, the duration of this work.
The excavations, which reached a depth of 14 feet in the cave floor,
gave evidence of a fairly continuous occupation which extended from
approximately A. D. 1650 to the early Archaic. Samples from the
14-foot level yielded a carbon-14 date of 8160 B. P. (before the present)
+ 300.

The beginning of the fiscal year found Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts,
Jr., Associate Director of the Bureau and Director of the River Basin
Surveys, on an inspection trip in the Missouri Basin. He visited
survey and excavation parties working in the Oahe Reservoir basin
in North Dakota and South Dakota and the Fort Randall Reservoir
area, also in South Dakota. After his return to Washington he
devoted practically full time to the management of the River Basin
Surveys program and in reviewing and revising a number of manu-
script reports on the results of investigations in various areas. In
October Dr. Roberts went to Clarksville, Mo., to attend the annual fall
meeting of the Missouri Archeological Society. Hespoke at one of the
sessions on the subject “The Inter-Agency Archeological Salvage

42
SECRETARY’S REPORT 43

Program.” From Clarksville he proceeded to the field headquarters
at Lincoln, Nebr., where he reviewed the results obtained by the field
parties, working in the Missouri Basin during the summer and early
fall months. Following his return to Washington he participated
in the annual meeting of the Committee for the Recovery of Archeo-
logical Remains. During the winter and early spring months Dr.
Roberts worked on the manuscript of an article summarizing the activ-
ities and the results of the archeological salvage program for the
10 years that it has been operating. In May he went to the Lincoln
office to assist in the preparation of plans for the summer’s fieldwork
in the Missouri Basin. He was in the Washington office at the end
of the fiscal year.

During the first two months of the fiscal year Dr. Henry B. Collins,
anthropologist, with three assistants conducted archeological field-
work on Southampton and Walrus Islands in Hudson Bay. The
work was sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution and the National
Museum of Canada and was supported in part by a grant from the
American Philosophical Society. The party, consisting of Dr. Col-
lins, Dr. J. N. Emerson, University of Toronto, William E. Taylor,
Jr., National Museum of Canada, and James V. Wright, anthropology
student at the University of Toronto, left Montreal by R. C. A. F. air-
craft on June 8, 1955, and arrived at Coral Harbour, Southampton
Island, the following day. On June 13 they went by Eskimo dog
team over the sea ice to Native Point, an abandoned Eskimo village
site 40 miles down the coast, where they camped for the summer.
Native Point (Tunermiut) was the principal settlement of the Sadler-
miut, the aboriginal Eskimo tribe of Southampton Island, the last of
whom died there in an epidemic in the winter of 1902-3. The site
consists of the ruins of 75 semisubterranean stone and sod houses in
addition to a dozen old “quarmats” or autumn houses built by the
Aivilik Eskimos who have camped there in recent years. Hundreds
of stone graves, cairns, and meat caches lie along the beach near the
site and on the old shorelines in every direction for miles around.
Excavation of house ruins, middens, and graves at the main Sadler-
miut site and two smaller sites nearby supplemented the work of the
previous year and provided an adequate picture of the material cul-
ture and way of life of the Sadlermiut Eskimos. The Sadlermiut are
commonly thought to have been descended from the Thule Eskimos
who migrated from Alaska to Canada and Greenland some seven or
eight hundred years ago. However, from the work on Southampton
and Walrus Islands it seems more likely that the Sadlermiut had
merely been influenced in some ways by the Thule culture and that they
were actually the descendants of the prehistoric Dorset Eskimos, who
were the other, and principal, object of study by the expedition.
44 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

The main Dorset site at which excavations were made lies a mile to
the east of the Sadlermiut site. It is situated on the gently sloping
surface of a 70-foot high headland which had once fronted the sea
but which now lies half a mile back from the present beach. The site
consists of shallow midden deposits, covered by a low, sparse growth
of vegetation, extending for an area of well over 20 acres, one of the
largest Dorset sites known. The site was designated T 1, from
Tunermiut, the Eskimo name for Native Point. A second, later
Dorset site was found near the Sadlermiut site and called T 2. A
third Dorset site, T 3, slightly later than T 1, was found on the old
beach line immediately below it, at an elevation of 40 feet above sea
level. Samples of charred bone excavated at the T 1 site in 1954 were
submitted to the University of Pennsylvania Carbon-14 Laboratory
and found to be 2060-230 years old. The thousands of stone, ivory,
and bone artifacts found at T 1 and T 3, though conforming in general
to the basic Dorset culture pattern, were in many respects specifically
different from those found at other Dorset sites in Canada and Green-
land. Flint implements, which were far more abundant than any
other artifacts, were small and delicately chipped, like Dorset im-
plements generally, but most of them differed in form from previously
known Dorset types, and some of them were unlike anything known
from America. The majority of the blades would be described as
microlithic, and some of them in shape and technique were similar to
microlithic types from pre-Eskimo sites in Alaska and Mesolithic
sites in the Old World. The cultural material from T 1 and T 3 seems
to represent an older, simpler stage leading up to the classic Dorset
culture; it should probably be referred to as formative or proto-
Dorset. AJ] faunal remains from the excavations were preserved. The
thousands of bird bones and occasional fish bones and mollusks were
brought back to the Smithsonian for identification. The mammal
bones were counted and as many as possible identified in the field.
As a result of the bone count some striking differences were observed
in the food economy of the Sadlermiut and Dorset Eskimos.

Five days in July were devoted to excavations at an abandoned
village site on Walrus Island. The houses, which had been made of
massive blocks of granite, proved to be Dorset rather than Sadlermiut
as expected, and provided the first adequate information on the house
types of the Dorset Eskimos. The artifacts from the houses were
typical or classic Dorset, different from and later than those from the
proto-Dorset site T 1 at Native Point. Plants, fossils, and insects,
including ectoparasites on birds and lemmings, were also collected
during the summer.

Two preliminary reports on the Southampton and Walrus Island
work were prepared by Dr. Collins, one for the Annual Report of the
SECRETARY’S REPORT 45

National Museum of Canada and the other for Anthropological Papers
of the University of Alaska. “Archaeological Research in the Ameri-
can Arctic,” a general article describing the current status of Arctic
archeology, was published in Arctic Research, Special Publication
No. 2 of the Arctic Institute of North America. Dr. Collins continued
to serve as a member of the Board of Governors of the Arctic Institute
of North America and of its committee on research. As chairman of
the Directing Committee of Arctic Bibliography, he continued to
supervise the preparation of this work, a comprehensive annotated
bibilography which lists and summarizes the contents of publications
in all fields of science relating to the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of
the world. Volume 6 of the Bibliography, 1,208 pages, was issued
by the Government Printing Office in April 1956, and material for
volume 7, of approximately the same size, was turned over to the
printer in June. Funds for the preparation of an eighth volume were
obtained from the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force,
and the Defense Research Board of Canada. As a member of the
Permanent Council and the Organizing Committee of the Interna-
tional Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences, Dr.
Collins participated in the work of planning for the fifth session of
the Congress to be held in Philadelphia, September 1-9, 1956. At the
close of the fiscal year Dr. Collins was in Europe, making a survey of
Mesolithic materials in museums for their possible bearing on the
Eskimo problem.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Dr. Philip Drucker was in
Mexico finishing up his fieldwork at La Venta, studying the material
collected there and comparing it with the collections in the Museo
Nacional at Mexico City. It was through Dr. Drucker’s intercession
that the U. S. National Museum received a collection of 187 polished
jadeite and other stone objects from La Venta as a loan from the
Museo Nacional of Mexico. Upon his return to Washington in Sep-
tember he completed the writing of his share of the final report on the
La Venta excavations, and also completed and submitted for publica-
tion his manuscript on the Native Brotherhood Societies of Alaska
and British Columbia. On December 9, 1955, Dr. Drucker resigned
from the Bureau.

RIVER BASIN SURVEYS
(Prepared by Frank H. H. Rosenrts, Jr., Director, from data submitted by staff members)

Throughout the year River Basin Surveys continued its program
for salvage archeology in areas to be flooded or otherwise destroyed
by the construction of large dams. As in previous years, the work
was carried on in cooperation with the National Park Service and
the Bureau of Reclamation of the Department of the Interior, the
Corps of Engineers of the Department of the Army, and a number of
46 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

State and local institutions. An increase in funds for the fiscal year
made possible more extensive investigations than in the preceding
year. During 1955-56 the program of the River Basin Surveys was
financed by a transfer of $92,360 from the National Park Service
and a grant of $12,000 from the Idaho Power Co. The funds from
the National Park Service were for use in the Missouri Basin. A
carryover of $3,663 from the previous year made the total available
for operations in the Missouri Basin $96,023. The grant from the
Idaho Power Co. was to provide for the excavation of sites along
the Snake River in Oregon-Idaho which will be flooded by the con-
struction of that company’s Brownlee and Hells Canyon dams. The
latter funds were the first for work outside the Missouri Basin made
available to the River Basin Surveys in several years.

Investigations in the field during the year consisted of surveys and
excavations. Most of the efforts were concentrated in the digging
of sites. Because of a slight delay in receiving the new Federal funds,
it was the middle of July before parties were sent out from the field
headquarters at Lincoln, Nebr. On July 15 a survey party began in-
vestigations in the Tiber Reservoir. On July 18 a second party start-
ed digging at a fortified village site near the mouth of the Cheyenne
River in the Oahe Reservoir area, and on July 20 a third party started
operations in the vicinity of the Oahe Dam near Pierre, S. Dak. In
May a historic-sites party began excavations at the location of an early
trading post in the area of the outlet channel below the Oahe Dam.
Early in June a second party returned to the Cheyenne site and re-
sumed excavations at that locality. Later a third party proceeded to
a village site near Whitlocks Crossing in the Oahe Reservoir basin
and started investigations where no previous work had been done.
On June 2 a survey party began operations in the Big Bend Reservoir
area near Fort Thompson, S. Dak., and on June 12 an excavating party
began digging a site in the Lovewell Reservoir area in northern
Kansas. Late in June a party proceeded to Robinette, Oreg., where it
established camp and initiated excavations in one of the Snake River
sites. All these parties were continuing their investigations at the
close of the fiscal year. During the year no paleontological studies
were made in any of the areas by the River Basin Surveys. However,
some fossil collecting was done by State institutions.

As of June 30, 1956, reservoir areas where archeological surveys
and excavations had been made since the Salvage Program got under
way in 1946 totaled 244 in 27 States; also four canal areas and one lock
project had been investigated. The survey parties have located and
reported 4,365 archeological sites, and of that number 862 have been
recommended for limited testing or excavation. The term “excava-
tion” in this connection implies digging approximately 10 percent of
SECRETARY’S REPORT 47

a site. Preliminary appraisal reports have been issued for all the
reservoirs surveyed, and in cases where additional reconnaissance has
resulted in the finding of other sites supplemental reports have been
prepared. During the last fiscal year four such reports were written
and were distributed in a single mimeographed pamphlet. Through-
out the years since the initiation of the program 181 reports have been
distributed. The discrepancy between that figure and the total num-
ber of reservoirs visited is due to the fact that in several instances
the information obtained from a whole series of proposed reservoir
projects occurring in a basin or subbasin has been included in a single
report.

By the end of the fiscal year 329 sites in 46 reservoir basins scattered
over 17 different States had either been tested or partially dug. Only
a single site was excavated in some of the reservoir areas, while in
others a whole series was studied. Thus far at least one example of
each type of site recorded in the preliminary surveys has been ex-
amined. The results of certain phases of the excavations have ap-
peared in various scientific journals and in the bulletins of the Bureau
of American Ethnology and the Miscellaneous Collections of the
Smithsonian Institution. During the year River Basin Surveys Paper
No. 8, which is to be Bulletin 166 of the Bureau of American Ethnol-
ogy, was sent to the printer, and at the close of the year galley proofs
of the publication were being read by the author. Two detailed tech-
nical reports on the results of earlier work were completed during the
year and are ready for publication.

The reservoir projects that have been surveyed for archeological
remains as of June 30, 1956, were distributed as follows: Alabama,
1; California, 20; Colorado, 24; Georgia, 5; Idaho, 11; Illinois, 2;
Kansas, 10; Kentucky, 2; Louisiana, 2; Minnesota, 1; Mississippi, 1;
Montana, 15; Nebraska, 28; New Mexico, 1; North Dakota, 13; Ohio,
2; Oklahoma, 7; Oregon, 27; Pennsylvania, 2; South Dakota, 10;
Tennessee, 4; Texas, 19; Virginia, 2; Washington, 11; West Virginia,
2; and Wyoming, 22.

Excavations have been made or were under way in reservoir basins
in: California, 5; Colorado, 1; Georgia, 4; Kansas, 4; Montana, 1;
Nebraska, 1; New Mexico, 1; North Dakota, 4; Oklahoma, 2; Oregon,
4; South Carolina, 1; South Dakota, 4; Texas, 7; Virginia, 1; Wash-
ington, 4; West Virginia, 1; and Wyoming, 2. The foregoing figures
include only the work of the River Basin Surveys or that in which
there was direct cooperation with local institutions. Projects that were
carried on by local institutions under agreements with the National
Park Service are not included because complete information about
them is not available.
AS ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

During the year the River Basin Surveys continued to receive help-
ful cooperation from the National Park Service, the Bureau of Rec-
lamation, the Corps of Engineers, the Geological Survey, and various
State and local institutions. Transportation and guides were fur-
nished in a number of instances, and mechanical equipment made
available by the construction agency speeded the work at a number
of locations. Temporary headquarters as well as living accommoda-
tions were made available at several projects. Detailed maps of the
reservoirs under investigation were supplied by the agency concerned
and helpful information was provided whenever it was needed. The
National Park Service continued to function as the liaison between
the various agencies both in Washington and in the field and through
its regional offices obtained information about the locations for dams
and reservoirs as well as data concerning construction priorities. The
National Park Service was also chiefly responsible for the preparation
of estimates and justifications and in procuring funds for carrying
on the program. Had it not been for the enthusiastic assistance of the
personnel in all the cooperating agencies, it would not have been
possible for the River Basin Surveys to have accomplished so much
for the year.

General direction and supervision of the program were continued
by the main office in Washington. The field headquarters and labora-
tory at Lincoln, Nebr., was in direct charge of the work in the Missouri
Basin. All the materials collected in the Missouri Basin were proc-
essed at the Lincoln laboratory and subsequently two large lots of
specimens were transferred to the U. S. National Museum. Through
the cooperation of the Washington State Museum at Seattle, the Snake
River party was provided with a base of operations. The general
direction of the activities in that area, however, was from the Wash-
ington office.

Washington office—The main headquarters of the River Basin
Surveys at the Bureau of American Ethnology continued throughout
the year under the direction of Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr. Carl
F. Miller, archeologist, was based on that office and assisted the direc-
tor in general administrative duties from time to time. William M.
Bass was added to the staff on June 18 as a temporary physical
anthropologist.

Mr. Miller reported to the Lincoln office shortly after the beginning
of the fiscal year and worked in the Missouri Basin until late in
September, when he returned to the Washington office. His activities
during the summer are covered in the Missouri Basin portion of this
report. After his return to Washington he prepared a series of brief
reports on the results of his fieldwork and then turned his attention
to his unfinished report on his previous investigations at the John H.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 49

Kerr (Buggs Island) Reservoir in Virginia. In April Mr. Miller was
transferred to the regular staff of the Bureau of American Ethnology
for the purpose of carrying on investigations in a cave in Jackson
County, Ala., where the deposits contained a long sequence of Indian
cultural history. He returned from Alabama in June and resumed his
duties as a member of the River Basin Surveys staff. He proceeded
to Lincoln, Nebr., and on June 21 left for South Dakota where he
began excavations at a site in the Oahe Reservoir area. During the
months in the Washington office Mr. Miller spoke before a number
of Boy Scout troops and acted as scientific consultant to a number of
high-school students who were participating in a science contest in
Alexandria, Va. During the year Mr. Miller’s manuscript “Revalua-
tion of the Eastern Siouan Problem, with Particular Emphasis on
the Virginia Branches—the Occaneechi, the Saponi, and the Tutelo,”
which was a byproduct of his study of the data pertaining to the
John H. Kerr Reservoir, was sent to the printer and will appear as
Anthropological Paper No. 52 in Bulletin 164 of the Bureau of
American Ethnology.

After joining the River Basin Surveys Mr. Bass began a study of
the human skeletal material that had been collected in the Missouri
Basin and transferred to the U. S. National Museum. His work was
well under way at the end of the year.

Columbia Basin.—After a lapse of several years the River Basin
Surveys resumed investigations in the Columbia Basin late in the
fiscal year. On June 11 Dr. Warren W. Caldwell joined the staff
as archeologist. He left Seattle, Wash., on June 22 and proceeded
with a party to Robinette, Oreg., where camp was established and
excavations were started in a cave not far from the town of Robinette.
The latter is built on a series of Indian sites, and tests were to be made
also at various places in the town. The party was actively engaged
in its investigations at the close of the year.

A report, “Excavations in the McNary Reservoir Basin near Uma-
tilla, Oregon,” by Dr. Douglas Osborne, was sent to the printer toward
the end of the fiscal year. It will appear as River Basin Surveys
Paper No. 8, Bulletin 166 of the Bureau of American Ethnology. The
report covers investigations made during a previous year when the
River Basin Surveys was operating a full-scale program along the
Columbia River.

Missouri Basin—The Missouri Basin project continued to operate
throughout fiscal 1956 from the field headquarters and laboratory at
1517 “O” Street, Lincoln, Nebr. Except for periods of one week in
August and two weeks in September, when he was detailed to the
Department of Justice to assist in an Indian Lands Claim case, G.
Hubert Smith served as archeologist-in-charge from July 1 to Janu-
50 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

ary 10. On the latter date Dr. Robert L. Stephenson, chief, returned
from academic leave and resumed direction of the project. Activities
during the year included all four phases of the Salvage Program: (1)
survey; (2) excavation; (3) analysis; and (4) reporting. Phases 2
and 3 received the greatest attention however.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the Missouri Basin project had
a permanent staff of eight, six assigned to the Lincoln office and two
to the Washington office. Since the chief was in leave status there
actually were only seven on active duty. Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, arche-
ologist, and George Metcalf, field assistant, were detailed to the
Missouri Basin project from the U. S. National Museum during July
and August. In July, August, September, and October there were
20 temporary student and local nonstudent employees working in
the field. Their services were gradually terminated as excavations
were brought to a close, and by November 5 only the permanent staff
remained. During the winter and early spring months a clerk-
stenographer, a photographer, and a part-time records custodian were
employed. These permanent additions to the staff continued on duty
throughout the remainder of the year. In addition, a temporary part-
time draftsman and a temporary part-time photographer assisted in
the laboratory on various occasions. Wedel and Metcalf were again
detailed to the Missouri Basin project on June 5 and were working
for it at the close of the fiscal year. One temporary field assistant
entered on duty May 28 and another on June 11. Both were with
field parties at the end of the year. A temporary physical anthro-
pologist was appointed on June 18 and was assigned to the Wash-
ington office to prepare reports on the skeletal materials from various
Missouri Basin sites. The archeologist assigned to the Washington
office returned to the Missouri Basin on June 20 and was on duty there
at the end of the fiscal year. Also, 29 temporary student and local
nonstudent laborers were employed in the field. Thus at the close of
the year there were 11 permanent employees, 2 employees detailed to
the Surveys, 2 temporary field assistants, 1 temporary physical anthro-
pologist, and 29 temporary laborers on the staff of the Missouri Basin
project.

During the year eight River Basin Surveys field parties operated
in the Missouri Basin, three in the period July—October and five in the
period May-June. One party in the July—October period and one in
the May-June period were occupied in survey and site-testing activ-
ities. One party in the May-June period was engaged in the excava-
tion of a historic site. The other five were excavating in prehistoric
and protohistoric Indian village sites. Other fieldwork in the Mis-
souri Basin during the year included six field parties from State insti-
tutions working under agreements with the National Park Service
SECRETARY’S REPORT 51

and in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution. Three of these
parties were in the field in the July-October period and three in the
May-June period.

In the Tiber Reservoir area a small field party directed by Carl F.
Miller conducted excavations along the Marias River in north-central
Montana from July 19 to August 16. Various sites located by previ-
ous Smithsonian Institution parties in the area were revisited and
excavations were conducted at site 24TL26. This site proved to be
of Woodland affiliation with some possible earlier and later sporadic
occupation. Other sites visited by previous parties and recommended
for further study have been destroyed by periodic flooding in the area,
and on the completion of the 1955 season no further work was recom-
mended for the reservoir.

In the Pactola Reservoir basin, the Car] F. Miller party conducted
investigations on Rapid Creek in Pennington County, S. Dak., August
19-24. <A brief survey had been made there in 1948 by a Smithsonian
Institution field party, but heavy vegetation prevented adequate in-
vestigation at that time. Miller’s party failed to find any archeo-
logical materials and no further work was recommended for the area.

In the Merritt Reservoir basin, the Carl F. Miller party conducted
investigations on the Snake River and Boardman’s Creek in Cherry
County, Nebr., from August 26 to September 2. Sites recorded by
a previous Smithsonian Institution party were revisited, sampled,
and analyzed. Two of these had largely been covered by windblown
sand, one was test excavated, and two yielded Woodland and later
materials. Several blowouts were examined where chipped-stone arti-
facts were recovered. No further work was recommended for this
area until such time as construction activities might bring to light
new material.

In the Glendo Reservoir area, on the North Platte River in Platte
County, Wyo., the Carl F. Miller party continued its field season
from September 5 to 13. Investigations there consisted of a reexam-
ination of sites located by an earlier Smithsonian Institution field
party and recording of two new sites. One site, 48PL15, remains as
the principal locality for further examination in the Glendo Reservoir
area, and work will be started there early in the new fiscal year.

In the Oahe Reservoir area, the Carl F. Miller party concluded its
field season at the Buffalo Pasture site (838ST6) in Stanley County,
S. Dak., a short distance above the dam construction area. With the
aid of a bulldozer a trench 11 feet wide, 367 feet long, and about 314
feet deep was cut across a portion of the site in order to expose the
stratigraphy from the present surface to sterile deposits below any
cultural remains. There had been extensive digging at the Buffalo
Pasture site during a previous season when the remains of several
52 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

earth lodges were uncovered and the encircling moat and remnants
of the palisade were studied, but it was not until the big trench was
cut that the site was determined to represent a single occupation. The
trench bisected the depressions of four circular lodges and exposed
some 20 refuse-filled cache pits which were cleaned out by hand. An
excellent series of specimens, including a large pottery vessel, was
recovered while the operations were under way.

The second field party in the Oahe Reservoir area in the 1955 field
season was a Smithsonian Institution group directed by Richard P.
Wheeler. This party conducted excavations from July 20 to Novem-
ber 5 at the Leavitt site (39ST215) and at the Breeden site (389ST16),
formerly known as the Mathison site. The Leavitt site proved in
part to represent an early historic Indian occupation related directly
to the occupation at the Philip Ranch site, excavated in 1951 and
reported in Bulletin 158 of the Bureau of American Ethnology, and
in part to an older late prehistoric period. Thesite produced materials
that assist greatly in the interpretation of both phases in the Oahe area.
Especially important was the recovery of 15 human burials. One of
them was particularly interesting because the skeleton was that of a
large male with a lead musket ball embedded in the dorsal surface of
the right pelvic bone. The individual had been shot in the back,
possibly while running away from an assailant. There was nothing
to indicate immediate death, but the man had not lived long because
the bone surrounding the ball had not started to heal. Iron and brass
bracelets, as well as glass beads, were found in several of the graves.
At the Breeden site there was evidence for at least three occupations.
The earliest was older than the first one at the Leavitt site and pro-
duced four deeply buried rectangular house remains indicative of
the Monroe Focus which is thought to date at approximately
A. D. 1200-1300. The later occupations have not been sufficiently
identified to correlate definitely with other known cultures but they
did have circular house structures. One has been attributed tentatively
to the La Roche Focus, which is estimated by some to be A. D. 1600-
1700, and the other to the historic Teton Dakota of about 1825 to 1875.

The third Smithsonian Institution party in the Oahe area in the
1955 season was directed by Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, assisted by George
Metcalf. Working from July 18 to August 31, that party continued
investigations at the Cheyenne River site (839ST1) which were begun
by Dr. Wedel in 1951 for the River Basin Surveys. The site, a multi-
component one, is located near the juncture of the Cheyenne River
with the Missouri. Excavation of a large rectangular pit house, be-
gun in 1951 and identified with the earliest of three occupations, was
completed in 1955, and a 70-foot section of the stockade line forming
part of the defensive works for the last (third) occupation was un-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 53

covered. Much of the fill removed from the rectangular house pit
consisted of sherds, bone, and other refuse material attributable to
an intermediate late prehistoric occupation for which no houses have
yet been opened on thesite. The 1955 work apparently confirms earlier
inferences that the site represents three separate occupations, the
earliest probably postdating circa A. D. 1300, the latest antedating
1800 and in all likelihood attributable to the Arikara. At the close
of the season Dr. Wedel recommended further investigations during
the 1956 season in order to ascertain the nature of the dwellings left
by the second occupation which it has been suggested may belong to
the Bennett Focus. The site also promises important data bearing
on the interpretation of village plans, the cultural sequences, and the
way of life of the prehistoric Indians of that area.

The fourth party in the Oahe area in the 1955 season was sponsored
by the University of South Dakota and the South Dakota Archeo-
logical Commission working under a cooperative agreement with the
National Park Service. Dr. Wesley R. Hurt, of the University of
South Dakota, was the director, and the party continued excavation
of the Swan Creek site (39WW7) which was begun the previous year,
ending a 7-week season on August 1. Human burials, a moat, a pali-
sade, and houses were excavated, greatly increasing the information
on these features for the region. This party also conducted limited
test excavations at sites 39WW300, 39WW301, 39WW302, and 39-
WW303.

In the North Dakota portion of the Oahe Reservoir area the State
Historical Society of North Dakota, working under a cooperative
agreement with the National Park Service, comprised the fifth field
party in that reservoir. The party, directed by Alan R. Woolworth,
conducted excavations at the Paul Brave (or Fort Yates) site (32S14)
from early July until late August. Three earth lodges of rectangular
pattern were excavated. Limited testing was also accomplished in
sites 82SI2 and 32SI13. Surface collections were made at a series of
other sites in the vicinity, and aerial survey provided photographic
records of 10 other sites in the North Dakota portion of the reservoir.

The 1956 field season in the Oahe Reservoir area began early, and
by the end of the fiscal year six parties were in the field. G. Hubert
Smith led a Smithsonian Institution party to the vicinity of the dam-
construction area on May 21 and was still in the field at the end of
the fiscal year. Smith’s party spent some time examining old historic
land records in the General Land Office at the State Capitol in Pierre,
as well as records in the South Dakota Historical Society, in an effort
to determine the location of various frontier trading posts. They then
covered the area carefully on foot and finally found what appear to be
the remains of Fort Pierre II which was in use around 1859-63. It
54 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

also seems probable now that Fort Pierre II and Fort Galpin
(1857-59) are identical in location. Excavations in this locality in
June revealed the outline of the stockade, the location of several struc-
tures, and produced interesting artifactual materials. The fort was
much larger than most trading posts as the enclosure was approxi-
mately 200 feet square. It was destroyed by fire. Other historic sites
scheduled for investigation by this party include Forts La Framboise
and Primeau (both dating in the 1860’s) and, if time permits, the
sites of Fort Sully and Fort Bennett.

On June 5 Dr. Waldo R. Wedel returned to the Missouri River Basin
and took a Smithsonian Institution field party to the Cheyenne River
site (39ST1) where the final season of excavation was started. By the
end of the fiscal year the party had opened several test areas, cache
pits, and house features, recovering a good sample of artifacts. Upon
completion of work at this site the Wedel party plans to finish excava-
tions which were begun by another River Basin Surveys party in 1952
at the Black Widow site (839ST3).

A Smithsonian Institution party directed by Carl F. Miller began
digging at the Hosterman site (89PO7) near Whitlock’s Crossing, S.
Dak., the last week in June. Having only started by the end of the
fiscal year this party had nothing to report.

A University of South Dakota—South Dakota Archeological Com-
mission party, working under a cooperative agreement with the Na-
tional Park Service and directed by Roscoe Wilmeth of the University
of South Dakota, began excavations in mid-June at the Swan Creek
site (39WW7). This party also planned to make test excavations at
two nearby sites (39WW302 and 39WW2308) after completing the
work at the Swan Creek site which was begun two seasons ago. They
were in the field at the end of the fiscal year.

A University of Wisconsin field party, working under a cooperative
agreement with the National Park Service and directed by Dr. David
A. Baerreis of that University, began work early in June at the Eklo
site (39WW3) near Mobridge, S. Dak. The party expected to con-
duct test excavations at two other nearby sites (89CA6 and 39CAQ)
after finishing the season’s work at the Eklo site. They were in the
field at the end of the fiscal year.

In the North Dakota section of the Oahe Reservoir a State Histori-
cal Society of North Dakota field party directed by Alan R. Wool-
worth, working under a cooperative agreement with the National Park
Service, began investigations in mid-June. They excavated at the
Demery site (89CO1) in Carson County, S. Dak., and at the Fireheart
site (82SI2) in Sioux County, N. Dak. They also were to test an
additional site (82S1208) in the vicinity. All three sites are near the
North Dakota—South Dakota border. The party was in the field at the
end of the fiscal year.

SECRETARY'S REPORT 55

With the added results of the current year’s work, it is now possible
to identify at least nine archeological complexes in the Oahe portion
of the Missouri Basin, covering the years about A. D. 850 to 1859.
Some indications have been found of occupations belonging to an
earlier period, but they are not sufficiently known as yet to be included
in the definitely identified list.

In the Fort Randall Reservoir two field parties operated in the 1955
field season. The Nebraska State Historical Society, under a cooper-
ative agreement with the National Park Service, had a party directed
by Marvin F. Kivett excavating at the Crow Creek site (89BF11).
Work was started on this site in the 1954 season and the second sea-
son’s digging there was completed late in August of 1955. This com-
plex site contains the remains of two and possibly three occupations
ranging in time over 300 or more years. The season’s work provided
new data on village plans, house types, fortifications, and relationships
of this area to other areas in South Dakota and Nebraska.

The second party in this area was that of the University of Kansas
led by Dr. Carlyle S. Smith of that institution and working under a
cooperative agreement with the National Park Service. They exca-
vated site 89B F204 over a 7-week period ending the last of July. They
also conducted some test excavations in site 39BF201, which appeared
to be culturally identical to the former site. Both relate directly to
the Spain site (89L.M301) and the Talking Crow site (89BF3), which
were excavated in previous years by parties under Dr. Smith.

In the Big Bend Reservoir area a Smithsonian Institution party
directed by Harold A. Huscher began an intensive survey and site-
testing operation in this newly activated reservoir on the Missouri
River in South Dakota on June 2. The party planned to search the
entire reservoir area for archeological potentialities. It was scheduled
to visit all known sites, locate all possible new sites, and make explora-
tory tests in all of them in order to determine what additional excava-
tion must be done before inundation. By the end of the fiscal year it
had visited and tested 20 sites and had located several others from pre-
vious records.

In the Lovewell Reservoir area a Smithsonian Institution party
directed by Robert W. Neuman began the excavation, on June 12,
of three sites on White Rock Creek in Jewell County, Kans. They
started at site 14JW1 and worked there until the end of the fiscal
year. The other two sites are 14JW2 and 14JW201. These sites
should help materially in establishing the significance and cultural

412575575
56 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

content of the White Rock Focus and its relation to the western ex-
tension of the Oneota Aspect.

A total of 15 parties were in the field during fiscal 1956, 7 in the
1955 season, and 8 in the 1956 season, investigating archeological
remains in 8 reservoirs. ‘They conducted excavations at 24 sites,
tested over 40 sites, and examined the surfaces of nearly 100 sites.
Fach field party consisted of a crew chief and from 6 to 10 crewmen.
Bulldozers and other heavy equipment, supplied through the courtesy
of the Lytle-Green Construction Company and the Corps of Engi-
neers, were used at some sites in order to expedite investigations. At
all reservoir projects the complete cooperation of the Corps of Engi-
neers and the Bureau of Reclamation personnel was always willingly
given.

On May 14 three members of this staff jomed Dr. Dwight R. Cran-
dell of the U. S. Geological Survey, Denver office, on an archeological-
geological field trip to the areas of the Oahe, Big Bend, and Fort
Randall Reservoirs in South Dakota. The party was in the field for
seven days, examining Pleistocene and early Recent geological de-
posits and fossil soils. The principal purpose of the trip was to
instruct members of the River Basin Surveys staff how to recognize
possible localities where archeological deposits of Early Man mate-
rial or other pre-pottery cultural remains might be found. The
results of the trip, while negative from the standpoint of actually
finding such sites, provided this office with a great deal of informa-
tion as to where and how to search for such material in the future
and what might be expected in specific localities. The three members
of this staff who accompanied Dr. Crandell were Richard P. Wheeler,
G. Hubert Smith, and Lee G. Madison. Dr. Crandell’s participation
in the project was arranged through the cooperation of Dr. Wilmot
H. Bradley, Chief, Geologic Division of the Geological Survey.

While fieldwork during the fiscal year was devoted to phases 1 and
2 (survey and excavation) of the salvage program, laboratory and
office activities were devoted to phases 3 and 4 (analysis and report-
ing). During the time the archeologists were not in the field they
were engaged in analyses of their materials and in laboratory and
library research. They also prepared manuscripts of technical scien-
tific reports and wrote articles and papers of a more popular nature.
The laboratory and office staff devoted its time to processing specimen
materials for study, photographing specimens and preparing speci-
men records, and typing and filing records and manuscript materials.
The accomplishments of the laboratory and office staff are listed in
the following tables.

As of June 30, 1956, the Missouri Basin project had cataloged
570,238 specimens from 1,517 numbered sites and 47 collections not
assigned site numbers.

Two shipments of archeological materials were sent to the United
States National Museum for permanent transfer. One was by
Missouri Basin project vehicle and consisted largely of fragile items
such as human skeletal remains, pottery vessels and vessel sections,
bone, shell, and wooden artifacts. The second was by truck freight
and consisted of stone specimens and other more durable materials.

On May 3, 4, and 5 the annual meetings of the Society for American
Archaeology were held in Lincoln, Nebr. As a programmed part
of the meetings, Thursday evening, May 3, was devoted to an “open
house” at the Missouri Basin project laboratory at 1517 “O” Street.
The office and laboratory were prepared with suitable displays of
photographic and specimen materials in order to best exhibit the work
of the Missouri Basin project. The “open house” was scheduled for
8:00 to 10:00 p. m. but lasted until well past midnight. Approxi-
mately 120 people visited the office and laboratory at that time.

Most of the activities of the Lincoln office during the first three
weeks in March were devoted to a general remodeling of the office
space at 1517 “O” Street. The entire first floor was cleaned and
painted. The floors were sanded and coated with floor preservative.
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

The west half of the first floor was partitioned into seven office cubicles.
A map room was made and the filing and secretarial facilities were im-
proved. All the work was done by members of the staff.

Dr. Robert L. Stephenson, chief of the Missouri Basin project, re-
turned to Lincoln on January 10 after 16 months academic leave and
resumed his duties at the headquarters and laboratory. During the
remainder of the fiscal year most of his activities were directed toward
the preparation of plans for the summer’s field program. In addition,
he started work on a summary report of the Missouri Basin Salvage
Program for the calendar years 1952-1955. He presented a paper,
“Topography of a Late Archeological Site,” at the 66th Annual Meet-
ing of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences held in Lincoln on April
20-21. An abstract of the paper was published in the Proceedings of
the Nebraska Academy of Sciences. He also took an active part in
the annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology held in
Lincoln May 3-5 and presented a paper entitled “Pottery from the
Accokeek Site, Maryland.” At the close of the fiscal year he was pre-
paring to take a field party to the Sully site (39SL4) in the Oahe area
north of Pierre, S. Dak.

Harold A. Huscher, field assistant, who worked several previous
seasons for the River Basin Surveys, rejoined the staff on May 28, and
on June 2 left Lincoln in charge of a survey party which proceeded to
Pierre, S. Dak., and began a reconnaissance of the proposed Big Bend
Reservoir area on the Missouri River. The work of the Huscher party
was continuing on June 30.

Robert W. Neuman, temporary field assistant, joined the staff on
June 11. He left Lincoln on June 12 as the leader of a party which
proceeded to the Lovewell Reservoir on White Rock Creek, Jewell
County, Kans. By the end of the fiscal year he had excavated for two
weeks in site 14JW1 and one week in site 14JW201. The work of
Mr. Neuman and his party was handicapped by severe rains but was
continuing at the close of the year.

G. Hubert Smith, archeologist, as previously stated was in charge
of the Lincoln office during most of the period from July 1 to January
10. His work for the Department of Justice pertained to preparing
an ethnohistorical report on the Omaha tribe and appearing as a wit-
ness at a hearing held in Washington late in September when his
report was introduced as evidence. During the fall and winter months
Mr. Smith completed the manuscript of a detailed archeological report
on excavations at the site of Fort Berthold II (32ML2) in the Garri-
son Reservoir area in North Dakota. In addition Mr. Smith worked
on a manuscript pertaining to excavations at Fort Berthold I and the
adjacent Like-a-Fishhook Village. The latter paper is being prepared
in collaboration with Alan R. Woolworth of the North Dakota His-
torical Society and James H. Howard who was formerly associated
SECRETARY’S REPORT 59

with that organization and is now at the Kansas City Museum. Mr.
Smith participated in the annual Plains Archeological Conference,
the meetings of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences and of the Society
for American Archaeology which were held at Lincoln. At the An-
thropological Section of the Academy of Sciences, he presented a
paper on the ethnographic contributions of Paul Wilhelm, Duke of
Wuerttemberg, who first visited the Upper Missouri region in 1820.
Early in May Mr. Smith went to Pierre, S. Dak., and spent a week
with the geological party that was studying deposits in the Oahe
Reservoir area. Following that activity he remained at Pierre and
began his regular summer’s program, as mentioned in previous pages.
Mr. Smith’s party was continuing its excavations just below the Oahe
Dam at the end of the year.

Upon completing the 1955 season’s work Dr. Waldo R. Wedel re-
turned to Lincoln, and before his departure for Washington from
the Missouri Basin project headquarters, proceeded to Turin, Iowa,
to examine a reported find of human skeletons. He was accompanied
by Lawrence L. Tomsyck of the Lincoln office, and when they arrived
at the location of the burials they joined representatives from a num-
ber of institutions in studying the finds. Absence of diagnostic arti-
facts with the skeletons precluded any valid estimate of age or cul-
tural affiliations, but nothing was noted that would confirm assertions
which had been freely made that the bones were those of Paleo-Indians
and had a Pleistocene dating. Upon his return to Washington Dr.
Wedel resumed his regular duties at the U. S. National Museum. He
was again detailed to the River Basin Surveys for the 1956 season
and reported at the Lincoln headquarters on June 4. His subsequent
activities were described in the preceding discussion of field parties in
the Oahe area.

Richard P. Wheeler, archeologist, was in charge of a field party
working in the Oahe Reservoir area from July 25 through October 29.
During the remainder of the fiscal year he devoted his time to analyz-
ing the materials obtained in the field and in working on a number
of technical reports and short articles. One article, “Recent Archeo-
logical Salvage Operations in the Missouri Basin,” was published in
the Missouri River Basin Progress Report, October-December, 1955,
and another, “ ‘Quill Flatteners’ or Pottery Modeling Tools,” was
published in the Plains Anthropologist, April 1956. Wheeler pre-
sented a paper on his work in the Oahe Dam area at the Plains Con-
ference in November and participated in a number of discussions
during the conference. He was elected chairman of the 14th Plains
Conference which will be held in Lincoln in November 1956. At the
end of the fiscal year Mr. Wheeler was at the Lincoln headquarters
working on reports.
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

Cooperating institutions —Several State and local institutions con-
tinued to cooperate in the Inter-Agency Salvage Program throughout
the year, although the shortage of funds for working agreements in
projects outside the Missouri Basin considerably reduced the activities.
Several State groups carried on independently but their investigations
were correlated with the general program. The New York State
Museum at Albany kept close check on projects in that State. The
Department of Anthropology at the University of Michigan studied
the possible effect of proposed enlargements of the South Canal on
St. Marys River on archeological manifestations in that district. The
University of Minnesota made preliminary investigations relative to
sites that may be involved in the flood-control program for the
Mankato area. The Florida State Museum checked several proposed
canal routes in the northern part of Florida. The Ohio State Histor-
ical and Archeological Society continued salvage work in several
localities, and the Historical Society of Indiana included examination
of proposed reservoir areas in its general program for surveys in that
State. The University of California Archeological Survey did some
further work on projects for which it previously had agreements with
the National Park Service, and the Archeological Survey Association
of Southern California continued its volunteer efforts in the vicinity
of San Diego. In the Columbia Basin the University of Oregon did
additional digging at sites on the Oregon side of the Columbia River
at the Dalles Reservoir, while the University of Washington continued
its investigations on the Washington side.

The only work done under an agreement with the National Park
Service, except for that previously described for the Missouri Basin,
was that of the University of Missouri in the Table Rock Reservoir
on the White River in southern Missouri. A special appropriation
for that project for the fiscal year made possible an extensive series
of investigations under the direction of Dr. Carl H. Chapman. Sites
in the Table Rock area are exceptionally numerous and represent a
variety of cultures. Considerable progress was made by Dr. Chapman
and his parties during the year.

ARCHIVES

The Bureau Archives continued during the year under the custody
of Mrs. Margaret C. Blaker. From June 4 to 6 Mrs. Blaker attended
the Special Libraries Association Convention in Pittsburgh, Pa.,
where copyright problems and the preservation, microfilming, catalog-
ing, and arranging of photographic and manuscript collections were

discussed.
MANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS

The manuscript collections continue to be utilized by students.
Visitors consulted about 264 manuscripts, and reproductions of 70
SECRETARY’S REPORT 61

manuscripts were mailed out. In addition, 89 mail inquiries con-
cerning manuscripts were received and more than 200 manuscripts
were consulted by the archivist in preparing replies.

While examining these manuscripts, 93 of them were analyzed and
more fully described in anticipation of publishing a manuscript
catalog. Several descriptive lists of manuscripts relating to specific
subjects or tribes were prepared for distribution.

Additions to the collections included a manuscript translation of
the Book of Genesis into Choctaw by Rev. Cyrus Byington, dated
1862. This translation was received from Miss Marcia Walton of
New York City. Accompanying the gift were a number of photo-
graphs and news clippings relating to the Reverend Byington’s work;
some of these are for permanent deposit, while others have been lent
for copying only.

Just at the year’s end, Dr. Philip Drucker’s field notebooks and
unpublished manuscripts for the period 1937-55 were accessioned and
sorted. They cover ethnological and archeological work in Alaska,
the Northwest coast, California, Meso-America, and Micronesia. They
occupy about 20 manuscript boxes.

PHOTOGRAPHIC COLLECTIONS

A sustained interest in pictorial data relating to the American
Indian has been shown by authors, publishers, students, and others
who have continued to draw heavily on the Bureau’s photographic
collections. There were 294 inquiries and purchase orders for photo-
graphs, and 978 prints were distributed. In response to public inquiry,
the archivist prepared numerous lists that described photographs
available for specific subjects or tribes.

Public interest has also been demonstrated by the contribution of
additional Indian photographs to the Bureau’s collections.

Frank B. Shuler of Hamilton, Ohio, lent a group of 29 photographs
of Kiowa, Comanche, Caddo, Wichita, and Sioux Indians. These
photographs were made about 1900. Copy negatives of 17 of these
were made for Bureau files.

Through the courtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Hugh N. Davis, Jr., of
Miami, Fla., the Bureau received 295 photographic prints of Seminole,
Cheyenne, and Alaskan Indians photographed during the years 1905-
52 by Deaconess Harriet M. Bedell, a missionary now residing in
Everglades City, Fla. Mr. and Mrs. Davis contributed their services
in making enlarged 8-x-10’’ prints from snapshot negatives lent
to them by Deaconess Bedell; the cost of the materials used was borne
by the Bureau.

Later in the year a collection of 450 snapshot negatives of Seminole
Indians, made principally by Stanley Hanson in the period 1927-31,
was lent to the Bureau by Robert Mitchell of Orlando, Fla., through
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

Gene Stirling of Venice, Fla. Copy negatives of some 280 of these
were made. Enlargements of the remainder are being printed, the
work being about half completed at year’s end.

ILLUSTRATIONS

Tilustrative work for the Bureau of American Ethnology and the
River Basin Surveys consumed the major portion of the illustrator’s
time for the year. This included a great variety of work on charts,
graphs, maps, diagrams, photograph retouching, and other illustra-
tions for the Bureau and River Basin Surveys publications.

There were also charts, graphs, mechanical renderings, and illustra-
tions on a variety of other subjects prepared for other Smithsonian
departments.

MISCELLANEOUS

Dr. John R. Swanton, Dr. Frances Densmore, Dr. Antonio J.
Waring, Jr., and Ralph S. Solecki continued as collaborators of the
Bureau of American Ethnology. Dr. John P. Harrington is continu-
ing his researches with the Bureau as research associate. Dr. William
C. Sturtevant, ethnologist, joined the staff of the Bureau on March
29, 1956.

Information was furnished during the past year by staff members in
reply to numerous inquiries concerning the American Indians—past
and present—of both continents. Many new descriptive lists and in-
formation leaflets were prepared in answer to requests for information
on the Bureau’s photographic and manuscript collections and other
subjects. There continued to be a constant demand for information,
published material, and photographs from teachers, particularly of
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

primary and secondary grades, from Scout organizations, and from
the general public. Material for use in writing term papers was in
frequent demand by high-school students who show an increasing
interest in this popular subject. On several occasions publishers con-
sulted various staff members regarding ethnological and archeological
problems, and the archivist regarding unpublished manuscripts and the
photograph collections. Specimens sent to the Bureau were identified
and data on them furnished for their owners.

Report on the Astrophysical Observatory

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the oper-
ations of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1956:

The Astrophysical Observatory includes two research divisions:
the Division of Astrophysical Research, for the study of solar and
other sources of energy impinging on the earth, and the Division of
Radiation and Organisms, for investigations dealing with radiation
as it bears directly or indirectly upon biological problems. Three
shops—for metalwork, woodwork, and optical electronic work—are
maintained in Washington to prepare special equipment for both
divisions, and a field station for solar observation is located at Table
Mountain, Calif.

DIVISION OF ASTROPHYSICAL RESEARCH

At the beginning of the fiscal year, the scientific headquarters of
the Division of Astrophysical Research were moved from Washing-
ton to Cambridge, Mass. In this new location, a close liaison with
Harvard University is expected to add to the research effectiveness
in astrophysics for the Smithsonian Institution. With this transfer
and the development of a working association with Harvard College
Observatory, a reevaluation of the basic scientific policies and goals
of the Astrophysical Observatory was undertaken. Because of the
present-day rapid progress in the physical sciences, the understand-
ing of the fundamental astrophysical processes of the sun, earth,
planets, and interplanetary medium has grown at an ever-increasing
rate. In addition, our mushrooming technology has become more
and more sensitive to phenomena of the solar system which were once
considered as of only academic interest. The Astrophysical Observa-
tory’s long tradition of active research in solar and terrestrial phe-
nomena and their interrelationships has laid a firm foundation upon
which will be based new research objectives including, besides solar
radiation, other phenomena of the solar system which also affect the
earth and its atmosphere. Energy sources other than the sun have
a profound effect on our atmosphere, on geophysical phenomena, and
on practical technological aspects of radio communication, the guid-
ance of missiles, and other practical considerations. Among the
sources of energy are corpuscular radiation from the sun, meteors,

65
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

cosmic rays, interplanetary gas, and radiation from without the solar
system.

This broadened research program of the Astrophysical Observa-
tory now embraces not only research in solar activity and its effects
upon the earth, but also meteoritic studies and studies of the higher
atmosphere. New methods of research, as they develop, will be in-
cluded in the program. For example, radioactivity and nuclear
processes will be utilized in the study of meteorites. Theoretical
research and magnetohydrodynamics will increase our understanding
of how solar variations and activity occur and how the energy from
these activities affect the earth’s magnetic field, produce air night
glow, the aurora borealis, and other phenomena of a geophysical
character.

The new Satellite Program of the International Geophysical Year,
sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences and the National
Science Foundation, and in which the Astrophysical Observatory
has a very important part, promises a new and startling tool of re-
markable power in the study of solar-system and geophysical phe-
nomena. Such technological tools as may be developed will be in-
corporated in the working potential of the Astrophysical Observa-
tory. A restudy of plans and methods was an important first step.

Work on solar radiation—As reported last year, the quality of the
skies at the Montezuma station in Chile deteriorated to an intolerable
degree because of smoke introduced by smelting operations at nearby
copper mines. Consequently, the station was closed September 22,
1955. The scientific and new transportation equipment was moved
to Table Mountain in southern California. By the middle of winter
the three observers at that station, F. A. Greeley, A. G. Froiland, and
Stanley Aldrich, extended the observational program to include simul-
taneous observations of the sun from two similar arrays of radiation-
measuring equipment. In this fashion it will now be possible to check
the influence of instrumental variations upon the measurements of
solar radiation and atmospheric opacity.

However, the Table Mountain skies are also beginning to show
progressive deterioration from the smog from the Los Angeles urban
area. So far this has not been too disadvantageous, but probably the
transparency loss will eventually necessitate the acquisition of a new
observing station for solar radiation. Serious searches for a site
with clear skies have been conducted in recent years, but the time is
approaching when a conclusive investigation must be made of the
usable high-altitude locations that offer the necessary atmospheric
qualifications for precise solar measurements. It is possible that the
use of satellite vehicles for carrying instruments to measure solar radi-
ation will eventually obviate the need for ground stations by elim-
SECRETARY'S REPORT 67

inating the errors arising from atmospheric opacity. On the other
hand, the measurements of atmospheric opacity in the observing pro-
gram of the Astrophysical Observatory have become of increasing in-
terest to meteorologists and geophysicists in recent years. Records
from Table Mountain show clearly the increased opacity of the atmos-
phere arising from the Alaskan volcano in 1953. However, they show
no effect of increased opacity arising from the explosions of nuclear
or thermal nuclear bombs.

Meteoritic studies—Meteoritic studies have been a part of the
Smithsonian Institution’s scientific research program for the past 80
years. The Institution’s meteorite collection, which has been de-
veloped through these decades of exploration and study, is one of the
most outstanding in the world. In cooperation with meteorite spe-
cialists in the department of geology of the United States National
Museum, E. P. Henderson and the late Dr. W. F. Foshag, a freshly
oriented plan of meteoritic research has been explored. This new
program has been placed under the supervision of Dr. John S. Rine-
hart for the purpose of ascertaining the answers to numerous questions
concerning astrophysical dynamics. As a result, the following aspects
of the problem are now in course of consideration: Past and current
research pertaining to the nature and distribution of meteorite debris
and micrometeorites; the nature of meteorite craters; exterior and
terminal ballistics and other phenomena that relate to meteoritic im-
pact against the earth; and the extraterrestrial life of meteorites. All
these studies are directed toward answering astrophysical rather than
specific geologic questions.

Under the sponsorship of the United States Air Force, the Astro-
physical Observatory has initiated a program whose objective is to
develop a better understanding of the processes that cause ablation as
meteorites hurtle through the atmosphere. Effort thus far has been
confined (1) to renewed search of museum collections for specimens
that exhibit ablation, and (2) to a metallurgical examination of me-
teorites that show heat alteration effects caused by their passage
through the atmosphere.

In June 1956, Dr. J. S. Rinehart, Nicholas Matalas, R. O’Neil, and
R. Olson journeyed to the meteorite crater near Winslow, Ariz., in
order to investigate, by systematic sampling, miniscule spherules,
globules, and pieces of meteoritic matter in the soil around the crater.
The search will extend over an area of more than 100 square miles.
Magnetic means are being used to extract meteoritic material from
soil samples. Initial effort is being directed toward the development
of sampling techniques and the identification of material. The results
of the first survey will be used as the basis for further and more ex-
tensive exploration of the Arizona crater and other terrestrial me-
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

teorite craters. A long-term objective of the program is to arrive
at a better estimate of the rate of accretion of meteoritic material
by the earth.

Design and construction of a fluorescent X-ray micronanalyzer have
likewise been initiated and are now well under way. When completed
this instrument can be used to determine within a microscopic (5-
micron) area the concentration and distribution of the various chemi-
cal elements within a meteorite, without destruction of the sample.
The method will be applied first to the determination of nickel-iron
percentages in meteorites that have Widmanstaetten figures. A
knowledge of the distribution of nickel will be of considerable cos-
mological significance as related to the origin of meteorites.

Satellite Tracking Program—The United States National Com-
mittee of the International Geophysical Year under the National
Academy of Sciences and through the National Science Foundation
has assigned to the Smithsonian Institution the responsibility, and
also a grant of funds, for initiating and executing an optical research
program involving the tracking of the planned artificial earth’s satel-
lite. Dr. J. Allen Hynek has joined the project as associate director
in charge of the Optical Observing Program and will join the perma-
nent Smithsonian staff in July 1956.

The Satellite Tracking Program consists of two distinct parts: the
visual search and tracking program, of low-order accuracy, and the
photographic tracking program, of extremely high precision. The
two have a common denominator in the needs for a communication
system and a central computing bureau to provide ephemerides and
for the later analysis of scientific results attained from the tracking
of the satellites.

The precision optical program will be carried out by means of
special Schmidt cameras of aperture 20 inches, mirrors of aperture
30 inches, and focal length of 20 inches, for which a newly developed
optical system is being designed by Dr. James G. Baker. A unique
drive system for these cameras is being designed by Joseph Nunn
and associates to make possible the photography of a 15-inch sphere
at a distance of a thousand miles and a 3-foot sphere at the moon’s
distance during hours of deep twilight or darkness when the satellite
is illuminated by the sun. <A tracking accuracy of some 2 seconds of
arc normal to the path of the satellite on the sky and some 6 to 10
seconds along the direction of motion with a time precision of one-
thousandth of a second is anticipated in the operation of these cameras.

A number of observing stations, possibly 12, each of which will
include one of these cameras and a precise crystal-clock system, will
be established at intervals around the globe. Observations of artificial
earth satellites from such a system of stations, combined with an
SECRETARY'S REPORT 69

accurate computing system, should make possible the calculation of
the position of the satellite at any moment and the relative position
of the stations in respect to each other and to the center of the earth
with a precision of some 380 feet. Not only is such precision tracking
essential to the general scientific value of the Artificial Satellite Pro-
gram, but it will lead specifically to precise determination of the
atmospheric density and pressure as a function of height to an altitude
of some 300 to 500 miles above the earth’s surface. It will provide
a precise interconnection among the geodetic networks of the conti-
nents and islands, the inclination of these networks with respect to
the true geoid, the shape of the earth, certain gravimetric data con-
cerning the distribution of mass in the earth, and other geophysical
information of great significance.

The visual tracking program will have two aspects: (1) Acquisition
of a satellite in case the electronic tracking equipment contained in
the satellite should fail, as well as possible tracking near the end of
a satellite’s lifetime as it plummets through the lower atmosphere; and
(2) a broad contribution to general interest in scientific research by
young potential scientists as well as the general public. The visual
observations will be carried out by a large number of nonprofessional
observers under the general direction of Dr. Armand N. Spitz. It is
expected that between one and two thousand observers, usually amateur
astronomers, will be activated in this program, but many times that
number will follow the program in considerable detail and gain scien-
tific understanding and interest because of it.

The organization of the visual observation part of the program
is well under way, and the first of a series of bulletins has been pre-
pared and issued to more than 20,000 potential observers.

The participation of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
in the Artificial Satellite Program follows two traditions that we
cherish in the Smithsonian Institution. We are participating as
pioneers in the progress of science, comparable to Dr. Langley’s origi-
nal research in the flight of heavier-than-air craft. We are also
promoting international interest in the Satellite Tracking Program
which is in keeping with the worldwide pattern of contributions to
knowledge by the Smithsonian Institution.

DIVISION OF RADIATION AND ORGANISMS
(Prepared by R. B. Witurow, Chief of the Division)

The major activities of this division have been concerned with
fundamental physiological and biochemical research on the role of
light in regulating growth in higher plants. Seed germination, seed-
ling growth, flowering, and the development of what is commonly
referred to as a “normal plant” are controlled by light. Pigments
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

within the organism absorb the light and convert it into chemical bond
energy and thus initiate a chain of events that produce the observed
growth effects. In most instances, relatively little light is necessary.
This is in contrast to the photosynthesis of sugars where very high
intensities are required for optimal results. There is a similar group
of light-controlled reactions in animals which regulate many phases
of reproductive behavior. Plans have been prepared for extending
the findings and technics developed in the laboratories to this phase of
animal physiology.

The regulatory plant photochemical reactions may be divided into
two general groups: (1) Those controlled chiefly by red and far-red
light; and (2) those controlled principally by blue light. The
respective pigment systems channel the energy into different biochemi-
cal pathways and therefore induce entirely different physiological
responses.

Photomorphogenesis—tIncluded in the photochemical reactions
initiated by red light are formative growth processes in seedlings, such
as the ability to form normal] leaves and the disappearance of the stem
hook that often is present on germination. Any one of these responses,
among many others, can be used as quantitative bioassays of the photo-
reactions. In these laboratories we have developed a technic based on
the rate of angular opening of the excised stem hook or arch that
appears in seedlings of beans and other dicotyledonous plants that
have been grown in complete darkness. If the hook portion of the
stem is cut from the seedling and exposed to red light, and then
returned to darkness, the hook will open in the following 20 hours to
an angle that is proportional to the logarithm of the incident red-light
energy. Last year it was determined that the most effective region of
the spectrum for producing this response was in the red at 660 mp.
If, after an exposure to red light, the hook is treated with far-red
energy from 700 to 750 mp, much of the effectiveness of the initial red
treatment is inhibited or “reversed.” Dr. W. Klein, Dr. R. B.
Withrow, and V. Elstad have completed the action spectrum of this
far-red reversal phenomenom and have found that the maximum
reversal occurs at 710 and 730 mp, with a weak maximum at 640 mp. The
reversal action has been determined at 27 points in the spectrum from
365 to 800 mp in the following incident energy series: 25, 10, 7.5, and
5.0 millijoules (mj). The percentage reversal is directly propor-
tional to the far-red incident energy, up to values of 10 mj which pro-
duces about 85 percent reversal. This linear response is in contrast
to logarithmic function of the red-light induction reaction.

Phototropism.—Another expression of photoregulatory processes
in plants is bending toward a light source, or phototropism. Previ-
ously, Dr. E. S. Johnston of this laboratory had found the action
SECRETARY'S REPORT ay |

spectrum of this response in oat plants to have two maxima in the blue.
However, because of poor resolution of the reaction in this region,
subsequent disagreement has arisen and it has not yet been clearly
established what pigment absorbs the incident energy and initiates
the response. There are several blue-absorbing pigments, including
the carotenoids and flavins, with absorption characteristics that might
qualify them as candidates for the role of the photoactivated pigment.
For example, beta-carotene has absorption maxima in the blue at
435 and 470 mp and riboflavin at 445 and 475 mp. Both pigments are
commonly found in plants.

However, the flavins and the carotenoids have very clear-cut spectral
differences in the near ultraviolet. Riboflavin has a strong absorp-
tion maximum at 870 mp, but the carotenoids do not absorb in this
region. Therefore, the effectiveness of various ultraviolet wave-
lengths in promoting phototropic curvature might be used as an
indicator as to which of these two pigment types is involved. When
the pigment system responsible is identified, it will be possible to
resolve the initial steps of the chemical reactions leading to curvature.

In order to establish the effectiveness spectrum, a large-grating
monochromator, for irradiation in the near ultraviolet and visible,
has been built in the Observatory shops. Calibration of the equip-
ment has been completed and Walter Shropshire has standardized
bioassay technics, using curvatures of the oat and barley coleoptiles
to measure the effectiveness spectrum. Although positive phototropic
curvatures have been obtained in the near ultraviolet in preliminary
studies, a complete monochromatic analysis of the action spectrum in
the entire visible and near ultraviolet appears necessary before the
photoactivated pigment system can be clearly identified.

Photochemical synthesis of plant pigments—Dr. J. Wolff and L.
Price have found that the complete chlorophyll molecule is not formed
immediately on irradiation of leaves of plants grown in the dark, as
heretofore postulated. Instead, protochlorophyll, the green pigment
present in very low concentrations in leaves of dark-grown seedlings,
is rapidly converted by light to chlorophyllide a. This pigment is
subsequently linked to the long chain alcohol, phytol, by the action of
the enzyme chlorophyllase in a strictly nonphotochemical thermal re-
action. Chlorophyllide a and chlorophyll a have identical absorption
spectra in the visible, but differ in chemical properties. Protochloro-
phyll has a different absorption spectrum from chlorophyllide a, yet
the two pigments have similar chemical properties. These facts indi-
cate that what has been commonly termed “protochlorophyll” is actu-
ally protochlorophyllide.

Modification of X-ray damage by visible radiant energy.—The
damaging effects of X-rays and other forms of ionizing radiation to liv-

412575—57 6
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

ing cells are due chiefly to the breaking of the chromosomes and inter-
ference with normal cell division. Young rapidly dividing cells are
most susceptible to X-ray damage and evidence three types of aberra-
tions—chromatid break, isochromatid break, and chromatid exchange.
In the past year, Dr. C. C. Moh and Dr. R. B. Withrow continued the
study of the effect of infrared, far-red, and red radiant energy on the
modification of chromosomal damage induced by X-rays, using root
tips of the horse bean, Victa faba, as the chief experimental material.

It has been found that infrared, from 820 to 1350 mp, causes no
significant increase in X-ray damage to the chromosomes. However,
far-red at 710 to 820 mp did significantly increase the frequency of
chromosomal aberrations induced by X-rays. The three types of chro-
mosomal aberrations were not effected equally, however. Chromatid
exchanges increased 100 percent; chromatid breaks, 34 percent; iso-
chromatid breaks were increased very little, if at all. These results
were substantiated with the pollen of the 7’radescantia flower where
the chromosomes of the microspores showed similar results.

When wavelengths from 680 to 820 mp (involving red and far-red
radiant energy) were used, the ability of far-red to increase the X-ray
damage was not secured. Thus, apparently, when red and far-red
are combined in proper proportions, the two regions nullify each other.
This could explain the negative results obtained by several workers
who irradiated the biological material with filters that did not sharply
absorb all the red.

Red radiant energy (wavelengths from 630 to 680 mz), when used
alone prior to X-irradiation, increased the yield of chromatid ex-
changes significantly, but chromatid and isochromatid breaks were con-
sistently decreased by 10 to 20 percent. This action of red radiant
energy on X-ray-induced chromosomal breaks is not yet clear. It is
suggested that the red radiant energy might accelerate the rejoining
process after the breakage occurs.

During the current year the following publication concerned with
the work of the Division of Astrophysical Research was issued by the

A new series, Smithsonian Contributions to Astrophysics, has been
initiated to provide a proper outlet for the research contributions of
the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and to provide an addi-
tional avenue of publication for a limited number of contributions by
other investigators with interests in common with those of our ob-
servatory. These contributions will contain research papers specifi-
cally in astrophysics, with particular attention to problems of the sun,
the earth, and the solar system.

The first number of the Smithsonian Contributions to Astrophysics,
in galley proof at the end of June, is entitled “New Horizons in
Astronomy.” It is a collection of scientific papers by leaders in the
various fields of astronomy who present their concepts of the research
problems that should prove most important to the advancement of
astronomy during the next decade or two. These papers are published
with partial support by the National Science Foundation. An ad hoc
committee of the National Science Foundation, on the “Needs of
Astronomy,” has devoted its attention to methods of increasing the
potential of astronomy. One of the methods is the publication of the
“New Horizons” series of papers. There is hope that the Smithsonian
Contributions to Astrophysics will serve to further our understanding
and appreciation of this part of the universe in which we are privileged
to live.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

During the course of the year, the Director attended and contributed
to the following international congresses: The International Feder-
ation of Astronautics at Copenhagen, Denmark, in August 1955; a
symposium on radio astronomy at the Jodrell Bank Experimental
Station, University of Manchester, England, in August 1955; and the
Congress of the International Astronomical Union held at Dublin,
Ireland, in early September 1955. He was appointed President of
the Subcommission on Meteoritics of the [AU commission No. 22.

In national science and defense, the Director contributed by serving
in the following capacities: Chairman of an ad hoc committee on
“Needs of Astronomy” on the Panel on Astronomy of the National
Science Foundation; chairman of a working group to set up a stand-
ard atmosphere for national and international use; as chairman of the
Panel on Rocketry of the International Geophysical Year, U. S.

Report on the National Collection of
Fine Arts

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the National Collection of Fine Arts for the fiscal year ended June

30, 1956.
SMITHSONIAN ART COMMISSION

The 33d annual meeting of the Smithsonian Art Commission was
held in the Regents Room of the Smithsonian Building on Tuesday,
December 5, 1955. Members present were: Paul Manship, chairman;
Robert Woods Bliss, vice chairman; John E. Graf, acting secretary;
John Nicholas Brown, Gilmore D. Clarke, David E. Finley, Lloyd
Goodrich, Walker Hancock, Charles H. Sawyer, Stow Wengenroth,
Archibald G. Wenley, Lawrence Grant White, Andrew Wyeth, and
Mahonri Young. Thomas M. Beggs, Director, and Paul V. Gardner,
curator of ceramics, National Collection of Fine Arts, were also
present.

Dr. Finley, chairman, reported that the executive committee had
met on November 18, 1955. Those present were: Mr. Clarke, Mr.
Wenley, Mr. Manship, Dr. Carmichael, ex officio, and Mr. Beggs.
Various means of acquiring works by living artists were discussed.
Existing membership of the Commission was considered, and it was
suggested that at its annual meeting the present imbalance between
its three categories of membership (artists, experts, and men from
civic life) be corrected by strengthening representation of public in-
terest. Acting as a nominating committee, at the request of Mr.
Manship, the executive committee suggested a list of officers and mem-
bers for new terms. Following this report, the Commission voted to
recommend to the Smithsonian Board of Regents the reelection of
Lloyd Goodrich, Walker Hancock, Lawrence Grant White, and
Bartlett H. Hayes, Jr., for the usual 4-year period.

The following officers were elected for the ensuing year: Paul
Manship, chairman ; Robert Woods Bliss, vice chairman; and Leonard
Carmichael, secretary.

The following were elected members of the executive committee for
the ensuing year: David E. Finley, chairman; Robert Woods Bliss.
Gilmore D. Clarke, and George Hewitt Myers. Paul Manship, as
chairman of the Commission, and Leonard Carmichael, as secretary
of the Commission, are ex-officio members of the executive committee.

76 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

Mr. Beggs pointed out that gifts of valuable art objects will not be
received until exhibition space of the National Collection of Fine Arts
is noticeably increased. He stated that since the National Gallery
of Art now collects and superbly exhibits the art of the past, the
proper function of the National Collection of Fine Arts should be the
acquisition of meritorious examples of painting, sculpture, and design
by living artists. The Ranger Fund of the National Academy of
Design establishes a precedent for placing such works of art in other
institutions until re-called for use in the National Collection of Fine
Arts. Until a new Smithsonian Gallery of Art is built, therefore,
accessions by gift, as well as by purchase, might be lent if donations
were made with that understanding. The advantage of purchase
prize competitions was discussed, and possible circulation of selected
items from these by the Smithsonian Traveling Exhibition Service
was mentioned. The urgent need for space in a new building to house
all these services was cited.

Mr. Goodrich recalled that at the last annual meeting discussion
concerning the Smithsonian Gallery of Art had not been completely
resolved and presented a resolution which was unanimously accepted
as follows:

Whereas the Congress of the United States approved a Joint Resolution on
May 17, 1938, titled Public Resolution No. 95, 75th Congress, providing that a
suitable tract of public land in the District of Columbia between Fourth and
Fourteenth Streets and Constitution and Independence Avenues should be as-
signed as a site for the Smithsonian Gallery of Art, that appropriate designs
for a building for the Gallery should be secured, the sum of $40,000 being appro-
priated for this purpose, and that the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
should be authorized to solicit and receive funds from private sources to meet
the cost of construction of such a building, to purchase works of art, conduct
exhibitions, and carry on other related activities; and whereas a competition
for designs for such a building was held by the Smithsonian Gallery of Art Com-
mission ; therefore be it

Resolved, that the Smithsonian Art Commission strongly favors the early
construction of such a building; that the Commission believes that if this is to
be accomplished, funds must be appropriated by the Congress in addition to
donations from private sources; and that the Commission requests that the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution transmit this resolution to the Regents
of the Institution and to other interested persons.

Mr. Brown proposed the following motion which was carried
unanimously :

It is moved that the executive committee be requested to take under advise-
ment the program for the new building and, in consultation with the Secretary

of the Smithsonian Institution, define the purposes and the scope of the much
desired new building.

The Commission recommended acceptance of the following objects:

Oil, Brooding Silence, by John F. Carlson, N. A. (1875-1945). Henry Ward
Ranger Bequest.

LIBRARY

The library was reopened to the public on December 19, 1955, after
being closed for a year for installation of steel stacks and decoration.
The folio shelves are especially appreciated, as the many elephant
volumes are now shelved not more than two to a shelf. These major
improvements in the library facilities are due to the initiative and
imagination of the librarian, Mrs. Bertha M. Usilton, who devised all
the plans for the new arrangement and saw them to completion.

The geographic breakdown of Far East, Near East, South Asia,
West, and Orient was discontinued in the reshelving. The Dewey
decimal classification scheme controls these breakdowns in the various
categories in the Western languages. Orientalia are cataloged and
shelved separately as before. A thorough reading of the shelves in
the shelving process revealed that only 15 books can be termed “lost”
in the 33 years of the library’s history.

The library is the laboratory of the entire staff, and it is here that
data for correct attribution, comparative material, and recorded
facts can be searched for and found. It has research material of the
greatest value in the realm of Oriental art. Welcome gifts from
scholars and learned institutions included a reproduction of the world
by the twelfth-century geographer Idrisi, received from the Embassy
of Iraq. An autographed letter of Mr. Whistler written to Thomas
Way was purchased. Books, pamphlets, and periodicals now number
35,000.

Despite the fact that the number of the year’s accessions was greater
than the previous year, and the added labor of moving into new
stacks, the accessioning and cataloging have been kept up to date.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 93

During the Charles Lang Freer Centennial commemorating the
birth of the founder of the Gallery, a special exhibition was made of

and-white slides, and 36 microfilms. Total negatives on hand, 11,173;
lantern slides, 9,542; 110 reproductions in the round of Freer Gallery

BUILDING

The general condition of the building is good. All roof areas ap-
pear to be in good condition ; minor repairs were made when necessary
throughout the year. The ledge of the roof was repaired, and a coat-
ing of roofing compound was applied. The copper flashing surround-
ing the court area was retucked and caulked. AJ] exterior walls were
waterproofed and repointed; all exterior water valves were replaced
or repaired on the outside of the building and in the court. All screen
doors and areaways are in good condition.

Redecoration of the interior was completed on December 9, 1955,
and rubber-tile floors were installed in the library and main office.
Fluorescent light fixtures were installed in all offices, work rooms,
storage rooms, and corridors, with the exception of the gallery corri-
dors where incandescent fixtures were put in.

The major work of the cabinet shop has been devoted to the making
of exhibition cases for the galleries. Miscellaneous odd jobs related
to storage, exhibition, restoration, crating, and maintenance of office
and Gallery equipment continue as usual.

Some of the alterations in the court planting planned last year, such
as reseeding, replacement of shrubs, removal of ivy, were undertaken,
94 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

and all plants, trees, and shrubs appear to be doing well and are main-
taining steady growth.

Work on the installation of the long-needed air-conditioning system
to safeguard the collections has begun.

Christmas day. The total number of visitors to come in the main en-
trance was 94,276. The highest monthly attendance was in April,

STAFF ACTIVITIES

The work of the staff members has been devoted to the study of new
accessions, of objects contemplated for purchase, and of objects sub-
mitted for examination as well as to individual research projects in
the fields represented by the collections of Chinese, Japanese, Persian,
Arabic, and Indian materials. Reports, oral or written, and exclusive
of those made by the technical laboratory (listed below) were made
on 7,258 objects as follows: for private individuals, 4,975; for deal-
ers, 1,072; for other museums, 1,211. In all, 552 photographs were
examined, and 320 Oriental language inscriptions were translated for
outside individuals and institutions. By request 19 groups totaling
468 persons met in the exhibition galleries for docent service by staff
members. Two groups totaling 74 persons were given docent service
in the storage rooms.

Among the visitors were 70 distinguished foreign scholars or per-
sons holding official positions in their own countries who came here
under the auspices of the State Department to study museum ad-
ministration and practices in this country.

In the technical laboratory 90 objects from the Freer collections
and 74 from outside sources were examined. The following projects
were begun: Quantitative chemical analyses of ancient Chinese
bronzes; thin-section studies on Chinese porcelain bodies and glazes;
study of ancient Chinese bronze-iron objects to determine means of
fabrication and special behavior during soil corrosion. The following
projects were continued: X-ray diffraction studies on jade objects in
the Freer collections; examination of specimens of wall painting
from the ancient Christian church of the Chora, Istanbul (in cooper-
ation with Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection). The
following projects were completed: Spectrochemical analyses of
samples from ancient Persian and Near Eastern silver objects (results
to be published later) ; treatment and conservation of several Freer
Gallery objects, mostly bronzes. During the year, 22 written reports
were made and 56 verbal reports given on objects examined in the
technical laboratory.

Report on the National Air Museum

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the National Air Museum for the fiscal year ended June 80, 1956:

STATUS OF PROPOSED NATIONAL AIR MUSEUM BUILDING

At the beginning of the fiscal year the vigorous efforts by the Smith-
sonian Institution to obtain a site for the proposed National Air
Museum building seemed about to succeed. The preferred site had
been chosen after a study of the original “wineglass pattern” plan
developed by the National Capital Planning Commission for im-
provement of the southwest Washington area. At the offices of that
Commission it was agreed that the site on Independence Avenue, be-
tween 9th and 12th Streets, was most desirable for the proposed Na-
tional Air Museum building. Subsequently, however, the Commission
decided to adopt a plan for the development of southwest Washington
proposed by the firm of Webb & Knapp, New York City. That plan
eliminated the preferred National Air Museum building site in favor
of a 10th Street Mall. No alternate site has yet been assigned, although
several are being considered. Especial attention is being given sites
close to the other museum buildings in order to provide most con-
venient access to the visiting public with limited time in Washington.

Although the question of a site has not been answered, nevertheless
as a result of continuing efforts and cooperation the Smithsonian In-
stitution now has a broader appreciation and better knowledge of the
requirements for adequate care and housing of the National Aero-
nautical Collections. The architectural studies, which were generously
financed by the Aircraft Industries Association and the Air Trans-
port Association, and ably conducted by the architectural firm of
McKim, Mead & White, have provided the Institution with a magni-
ficent general internal and external plan of a building, scale drawings
of floor plans, perspective renderings, and scale models of a building
which is generally adaptable to any level site approximately 1,000 by
500 feet. A previous study conducted by the General Services Ad-
ministration, Public Buildings Service, produced a plan adaptable to
a larger area which would include outdoor exhibits and parking. As
the result of the work of the past several years, therefore, the Institu-
tion is provided with the principal features which can be adapted to
any chosen site.

101
102 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

At the close of the fiscal year, the Smithsonian Institution was pro-
ceeding with plans of buildings for other bureaus of the Institution.
it was decided that as soon as other units, now occupying space in the
Arts and Industries Building, are thus provided for, the space they
vacate will be made available to the National Air Museum. Such
space should be considered, however, only as an interim provision, and
not as a permanent solution of the constantly increasing need to give
adequate care and proper educational display to the Institution’s mar-
velous collection of aircraft. Four-fifths of that collection is hidden
away in storage, prevented from accomplishing its educational and
inspirational function for the students, engineers, and pilots of this
Nation which first gave powered and controlled wings to mankind.
Aeronautics is too important to the defense, industry, and progress of
our Nation to have this collection, embodying its very foundation and
development, so confined and suppressed as it now is.

ADVISORY BOARD

This Board of five members, specified in the Act establishing the
National Air Museum, continues to assist in the planning and opera-
tion of the Museum. Shortly after the beginning of the fiscal year,
Maj. Gen. George W. Mundy, the Air Force member, was assigned to
other duties away from the Washington area and was succeeded on the
Board by Maj. Gen. John P. Doyle. He and his assistant for Museum
matters, Maj. George C. Bales, have not only been ever ready to assign
Air Force personnel to help in maintaining the Air Force planes in the
exhibit, but also have directed the construction of a series of dioramas
and scale-model groups being made for the National Air Museum at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to illustrate significant events in
Air Force history.

The Navy member of the Board, Rear Adm. James S. Russell, and
his alternates, Capt. C. C. Case and Alfred Verville, have kept close
contact with the Museum on a number of projects. These include the
restoration of a World War I Curtiss N-9 training seaplane, the
improved display of the series of models illustrating the develop-
ment of naval aircraft, and the preservation of the original wind-tun-
nel models developed at the Washington Navy Yard. Associated with
the latter project is the intention to construct a scale model of that
wind tunnel, which was developed in 1914. The Museum is indebted
also to the Navy for its continued storage of Museum material, thus
relieving the Museum of this physical custody while its own premises
and facilities are completely occupied.

On March 20, 1956, William B. Stout, one of the Presidential
appointees to the Board, passed away at his home in Phoenix, Ariz.
His constant interest and wise counsel were a most helpful resource in
SECRETARY’S REPORT 103

conducting the work and planning of the National Air Museum. Sev-
eral months before his death, Mr. Stout had brought to the Museum
a group of five early experimental model aircraft devised during the
late nineteenth century and including two he had made at that time,
evidencing his early interest in aeronautics. He continued active ex-
perimenting and designing throughout his life, and the aeronautical
world is richer because of his accomplishments. His last letters to
the Museum relate to his efforts in obtaining for the Collections an
example of the famous Ford-Stout trimotored transport, which was
one of the mainstays of the pioneer airlines during the 1930’s. In his
letters, he included sketches detailing his ideas for hall arrangements
and exhibit locations in the proposed National Air Museum building.

During the year, the other Presidential appointee, Grover Loening,
shared his progressive ideas for improvements and expansion of the
National Air Museum with the fifth member of the Board, the Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution.

STEPHENSON BEQUEST

It will be recalled that Congress authorized the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution to accept as a gift from the late George H.
Stephenson of Philadelphia a statue of Gen. William Mitchell. The
development of this project is proceeding very satisfactorily. At the
time the previous report was submitted, the sculptor, Bruce Moore,
had completed his 14-size study and it has been approved by the Fine
Arts Commission. This has since been enlarged in plastiline to full
size, about 7 feet high. Details of the head, figure, uniform, and
other features are being perfected. The Director of the National
Collection of Fine Arts, Thomas M. Beggs, and the head curator
of the National Air Museum inspected this enlargement on February
2, 1956, and approved it in that elementary form. While continuing
his refinement of the sculpture, Mr. Moore has studied many photo-
graphs and motion pictures of General Mitchell and has had the
helpful assistance and constructive criticism of persons who knew the
General intimately. The sculpture will soon be ready for final inspec-
tion prior to casting.

SPECIAL EVENTS

On July 2, 1955, just 20 years after the world endurance record of
65314 hours continuous refueled flight had been established in a
Curtiss Robin airplane by the Key brothers, Algene and Fred, of
Meridian, Miss., that same airplane Ole Miss, piloted by Fred Key,
completed a flight from Meridian to Washington, D. C., for presenta-
tion to the National Air Museum. This accession not only adds an-
other event of flying history to the many outstanding accomplishments

412575578
104 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

illustrated in this Museum by original aircraft, but also provides the
collection with an example of a 3-place commercial airplane which
was popular in the 1930’s. This record of over 27 days in the air was
an impressive demonstration of the reliability of American aircraft
and engines, as well as a tribute to the piloting skill and endurance
of the Key brothers.

On August 18, the Civil Air Patrol, an air-youth organization
sponsored by the Air Force to encourage aeronautical training and
national airmindedness, chose the National Air Museum as a fitting
location for paying tribute to their retiring head, Gen. Lucas V. Beau.
The ceremony was held in the Aircraft Building in front of the
Spad-XIIT airplane, a type which General Beau had flown during
World War I.

August 19 was the birth date of Orville Wright. At one time this
date was designated as Aviation Day, and although that term is now
generally applied to December 17, when the Wright brothers first flew
in 1903, August 19 is deserving of recognition. The National Air
Museum marked the day with a public lecture on World War I avia-
tion, Col. Burling Jarrett, curator of the Army Ordnance Museum at
Aberdeen, Md., being guest speaker. He showed motion pictures that
he had produced with the assistance of Maj. Kimbrough Brown,
USAF, recording the heroism of the famous aces, Georges Guynemer
of France and Baron Manfred von Richthofen of Germany.

On September 5, 1955, at a meeting of the Early Birds in Phila-
delphia, this organization of pioneer pilots, who flew solo during the
first 13 years of human flight, 1903-1916, designated the National Air
Museum as their official depository for mementos of those fundamen-
tally important years of aeronautics. The head curator was elected
secretary of this organization. As a result, this Museum has received
a number of important accessions from the membership. These in-
clude the Knabenshue airship of 1905, Boland air-speed indicator of
1910, an Elbridge and a Lawrance engine from William Parker, a
group of instruments and a Daniel rotary engine from Adm. Luis de
Florez, and other items included among those listed at the end of
this report.

Members of the Philadelphia Flying Club came to Washington in
their own planes October 30, 1955, for the purpose of seeing the
Smithsonian’s aircraft collection; and on April 3, 1956, a tour of the
Museum by members of the Association for Childhood Education
International was followed by a group discussion on the value of aero-
nautics as a medium in school courses. On June 13 a group of chil-
dren, sponsored by Representative Peter Mack, were given a descrip-
tive tour of the aircraft display.

The National Air Museum was represented, by invitation, at the
Wright brothers memorial banquet of the Aero Club of Washington
SECRETARY'S REPORT 105

on December 17, 1955, and at the annual banquet of the American
Helicopter Society on May 2, 1956. The head curator continued to
serve as a director of the National Aeronautic Association and a
member of the Brewer Trophy award committee. On August 28 he
received the annually awarded citation of the Air Line Traffic Associa-
tion in recognition of the progress achieved by the National Air
Museum in memorializing aeronautical history. During the year he
gave 17 lectures on various aspects of the history and development of
aeronautics as requested by various groups, including the Institute of
Aeronautical Sciences at the Fairchild Aviation Division, Hagers-
town, Md., and the Management Club of McDonnell Aircraft at St.
Louis, Mo. Three television and three radio presentations on histor-
ical and current aspects of aeronautics were prepared by the National
Air Museum during this year and broadcast from Washington stations.

For the annual meeting of the Smithsonian Institution’s Board of
Regents on January 13, 1956, the National Air Museum prepared a
special display illustrating the development of the world’s first liquid-
fueled rocket by Dr. Robert H. Goddard. The main item of this
display was the revised version of the world’s first liquid-fueled rocket,
fired March 16, 1926. This flight was a significant milestone in the
development of rockets. Dr. Goddard’s experiments were carried on
under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution from 1913 to 1930
and were aided by an additional Smithsonian grant in 1932. This
Institution allotted funds to Dr. Goddard from a Research Corpora-
tion grant, the Smithsonian’s Hodgkins fund, and from its own re-
search sources. Clark University, the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, and the Carnegie Institution of Washington
also gave aid to Dr. Goddard during the 1917-1930 period. His later
sponsor was the Daniel Florence Guggenheim Foundation until, in
World War II, the United States Navy financed his final accomplish-
ments. Dr. Goddard died on August 10, 1945, at age 62. This Regents
display was added to the permanent exhibits of the Museum and now
includes full-sized original rockets of 1934-35 and a larger rocket,
about 16 feet long and 1 foot in diameter, developed 1939-41. Dr.
Goddard’s experiments were copied by the Germans during their de-
velopment of the V-2 rocket weapon and formed the foundation for
modern rocket progress.

IMPROVEMENTS AND CHANGES IN EXHIBITS

During the first part of this fiscal year several halls in the Arts and
Industries Building were painted, requiring partial disassembly and
covering of the suspended aircraft in those halls and the repair and
reassembly of the planes after the painters had completed their work.
Because of changes being made in the halls of the Arts and Industries
Building, in connection with renovation of exhibits pertaining to
106 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

American history and technology, the National Air Museum was
required to remove another full-sized aircraft, the William H. Martin
glider of 1909, from exhibition. The same renovation program re-
quired moving the Wright brothers’ first military flyer of 1909 and
the Wright brothers’ first transcontinental flyer of 1911 to other
exhibition locations in the same building. With the assistance of
working parties supplied by the Air Force, repairs were made to the
Douglas World Cruiser, Loening amphibian, and Spad—XVI air-
planes. Several of the fabric-covered aircraft, particularly those
exhibited in the Aircraft Building, required patching.

The Museum is particularly proud of its collection of famous aero-
nautical trophies. Several of these, such as the Pulitzer Trophy and
the Curtiss Marine Trophy, have served to stimulate progress in the
past, while others, including the Robert J. Collier Trophy, Wright
Brothers Memorial, Thompson, and Harmon Trophies, continue to re-
ward those who attain excellence and to inspire others. Improvements
have been made throughout the year in the display of these trophies
and the associated exhibition of specimens which illustrate the basis
for the individual awards. The display describing the two world
flights of Wiley Post in the Winnie Mae, 1931 and 1933, the first
time with Harold Gatty, has been improved by the addition of speci-
mens that expand the physical records of these famous flights. The
exhibition of scale models illustrating types developed by the Wright
brothers and the Wright Company during the 17 years of progressive
development, from their first glider of 1900 to the type “L” of 1916,
has also increased in contents and educational interest. The develop-
ment of our Armed Forces’ aircraft, as illustrated by groups of scale
models, has been expanded by important additions.

STORAGE

At the beginning of this fiscal year, the National Air Museum was
busily continuing shipment of its stored collection of aircraft and
aeronautical materials from the original storage area at Park Ridge,
Ill., to the Suitland, Md., facility, in order to advance the project of
concentrating all the Museum’s stored material at one location in the
Washington, D. C., area where the proposed National Air Museum
building is to be constructed. A target date of January 1, 1956, had
originally been set for completing this transfer, but Museum person-
nel at Park Ridge, under the capable management of Walter Male,
beat this deadline by four months. The final load was disptached on
August 27, 1955, and the storage operation there was terminated
September 1.

Meanwhile, at Suitland the carloads and truckloads of material
were being placed in the storage buildings by the Suitland force di-
SECRETARY’S REPORT . 107

rected by Stanley Potter, keeping pace, both in efficiency and speed,
with the hard-working Park Ridge crew. The last load was stored
on September 9. Most unfortunately Mr. Potter was severely in-
jured during the unloading of one of the final deliveries and has not
been able to return to work.

The construction of the largest of the Suitland buildings, which
will serve as a shop for the restoration and subassembly of aircraft,
was begun October 1 and completed January 27. This is 200 by 180
feet in area and will accommodate metal and woodworking machinery,
engine-handling devices, stocks of material, a spray booth, a fabric
and sheet-metal shop, and other equipment. During the period of
about seven years while these aircraft were at Park Ridge they were
unavoidably subjected to weather exposure and handling, and fur-
ther affected by their recent disassembly and shipment. With the
expectation of ultimately obtaining an adequate building for exhibi-
tion of the National Aeronautical Collections, it is vitally necessary
to conduct a continuing program of preparing these specimens for
durable, authentic, and attractive display in that building.

By the close of the fiscal year a force consisting of a foreman, two
mechanics, an assistant for maintenance, and an aide had been en-
gaged for duty at Suitland. They were setting up the individual
shops, sorting material, and selecting the aircraft most in need of
reconditioning.

Other projects at Suitland have included the repair of vehicular
handling equipment which was strenuously used during the aircraft
unloading operations, the repair of roads, and the rearrangement of
aircraft storage to clear one of the 4,000-square-foot buildings for
storing specimens of the Smithsonian’s National Collection of Fine
Arts and Division of Engineering.

The four Museum airplanes that were flown to Washington have
remained at Andrews Air Force Base where they landed. They were
moved to an end of a runway and at the close of the fiscal year a fence
was erected around them to protect them from damage. The dis-
mantling of the aircraft for storage of their parts at Suitland is the
first project of the next fiscal year for the Suitland crew.

INFORMATIONAL SERVICES

The supplying of information on aeronautical history; technical
development of aircraft; details of aircraft structure and operation;
the theory of flight; the collections of aircraft, engines, and flight
equipment in custody of the National Air Museum; biographies of air-
craft inventors, designers, manufacturers and pilots; and the fur-
nishing of photographs and drawings—these and other informational
services require a constantly increasing amount of time by the staff
108 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

of the Museum. These requests come from visitors to the Museum
who are interested in various details of the exhibits, from authors,
engineers, historians, teachers, students, and others whose need for
authoritative information leads them to this national depository for
aeronautical materials.

Among the numerous requests for assistance and information re-
ceived from other Government departments one of the most interesting
is the making of a historical film by the Navy Department, Bureau of
Aeronautics. It is astounding to realize that the evolution of naval
aircraft from the first 45-mile-per-hour 40-horsepower “hydroaero-
plane” of 1911 to the current supersonic jet-powered delta-winged
fighters has taken place in the active life span of a number of naval
aviators who retain keen recollections of this marvelous progress. In
this motion picture the memories of these men are being recorded and
illustrated by actual scenes taken from film records. The head curator
was appointed a technical director for this film, and it has been a
fascinating experience for him to listen to these stories in the words of
those persons who were actually there when history was being made.
For a number of scenes the Museum has supplied specimens which not
only stimulated recollections but also illustrated the vivid descriptions.
The Navy also requested assistance from the Museum in determining
the identification markings of carrier-borne aircraft of the 1930's, in
recalling details of the first aircraft landing aboard ship, and in dating
early catapulted takeoffs.

The Coast Guard is filling in the history of its aircraft, and was
pleased to obtain some needed illustrations from our reference files.
The Department of Justice, investigating the origins of inventions in
order to defend claims against the Government, was shown on a
Museum specimen of 1909, the Olmsted monoplane, a prior develop-
ment of a high-aspect-ratio elevated stabilizer, and was interested also
in the use by the Japanese on their transpacific incendiary balloons of
a means for automatically releasing ballast and explosives with
aneroid-operated relays, as evidenced by an example in the Museum.
The Central Intelligence Agency was also informed about these
Japanese balloons. The Air Force, in assembling a history of Mitchel
Field, was furnished with data and photographs of early air races
held there, and the Signal Corps, proud of the first military airplane
exhibited in the Museum, obtained help in describing its technical
details and history. A consulting engineer for the Atomic Energy
Commission was shown, in the files and library of this Museum, numer-
ous accounts and illustrations of flight-training devices to assist him
in preparing a curriculum for employees. The Treasury Department,
preparing Defense Bonds advertisements featuring famous Amer-
icans, was shown numerous biographical references in the National Air
SECRETARY’S REPORT 109

Museum files, and selected several to augment its program. The Voice
of America made a number of phone calls to the Museum to check
on details of scripts, and the Civil Aeronautics Administration re-
ceived helpful suggestions for the making of scale models of airplanes
used in accident investigations. These are only a few of the many
requests for assistance received from Government agencies. Several
Congressmen referred their constituents to the Museum or received
direct assistance in answering inquiries about historic aircraft, and
a research worker from the Bureau of the Budget was aided in his
study of the history of aerial photography.

Seventeen schools and colleges were assisted in preparing their
aeronautical courses, and numerous teachers and students consulted
the Museum for facts about many aircraft and related subjects.
Authors and an illustrator from the Civil Air Patrol were shown some
documents on aviation engines and propellers which aided them in
preparing texts. Aeronautical organizations that consulted the Na-
tional Air Museum included the National Aeronautical Association,
Royal Aeronautical Society, Institute of Aeronautical Sciences, Air
Transport Association, Air Industries Association, Washington
Junior Chamber of Commerce, and the National Aviation Education
Council. Several lecturers were assisted in preparation of texts and
in illustrating their talks.

Among the many interesting projects with which the Museum as-
sisted were three motion pictures, the producers of which have ex-
pressed their appreciation, not only for help in reproducing accurate
copies of historic aircraft, but also for supplying authentic facts for
the script. For “The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell” help in costum-
ing was supplied from actual uniforms of Mitchell preserved in this
Museum. The Spirit of St. Louis itself was measured, photographed,
and examined in detail to insure the accuracy of the copies of that
airplane constructed for the film. The third film project was the
story of the Wright brothers, and only in this Museum could the
technical directors find three original examples of Wright brothers’
aircraft, and a group of models from which they could scale details for
the reproductions they planned to make.

The list of airlines and aircraft manufacturers who were assisted
in writing their own company histories includes several which, but
for the Museum records, would have left gaps in their texts. The
publications that were given assistance include the National Geo-
graphic Magazine, Our Wonderful World, Reader’s Digest, Life,
Saturday Evening Post, American Aviation Daily, Pegasus, Skyways,
and Sperryscope. Numerous authors and artists based their work
on Museum material.
110 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

Maintaining this informational service is a task that has proved
its worth as evidenced by the needs and responses of those assisted.
This Museum is becoming increasingly recognized as a unique source
for authentic information, as embodied in the aircraft and other
specimens, the documentary files, the photograph collection, and in the
expert knowledge of the staff. Requests for this service are increasing
as it becomes more widely appreciated. An upsurge resulted from the
publication of an article describing this function.

This service has come to require more staff time than any other
duty, and yet those other duties must somehow be performed, especially
when they involve administrative requirements. Time must in some
way be found also to maintain the collection, both exhibited and stored,
and the associated records, to search for new material, to write texts
and other descriptions of aircraft and aeronautical objects in the
Museum, and to study. This constant searching for facts involves
not only the acquired specimens, but also texts, both historic and cur-
rent, in order that the staff’s personal knowledge and familiarity with
the collection—an intangible that is as valuable as any specimen—-may
be constantly increased. Thus, the need for adequate facilities for
the National Air Museum—a building, equipment, and staff—becomes
increasingly emphasized.

PUBLICATIONS

By the end of the fiscal year all work on the ninth edition of the
Handbook of the National Aeronautical Collections was virtually
completed, and the book came off the press in mid-August. This
Handbook is a general history of aeronautics, as illustrated by the
principal specimens in the collections. It contains 166 pages of text
and 220 illustrations.

Progress this year on the Catalog of Aircraft has been principally
through the procurement of photographs of each of the airplanes, sea-
planes, gliders, rotorcraft, and experimental aircraft in the collec-
tions, and the assembling of data on each, preparatory to condensing
each item to a concise description.

Several of the information leaflets that describe individual air-
craft in the Museum and are used principally as inserts for cor-
respondence were revised and multigraphed. Despite progress with
supersonic aircraft, correspondence throughout the year reveals that
there is still widespread interest in the most basic of aircraft, the
kite, for both practical uses and sport. The Museum exhibits a num-
ber of oriental and domestic kites, including some that were made by

1“«The Expanding Role of the Smithsonian Institution in Aviation and Educa-
tion,” by Leonard Carmichael and Paul E. Garber, in Education for September
1955.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 11]

aeronautical pioneers during their early experiments. Assembly of
material for a publication describing them has progressed during the
year, and promising leads are being investigated for the procurement
of several types of kites that should be obtained in order to complete
the series.

REFERENCE MATERIAL AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Documentation of the collections is an important procedure, in order
to authenticate the exhibits and acquire authoritative data from which
labels, catalogs, and other texts can be prepared. This material is
also essential for answering the thousands of questions received each
year and for serving those who come to the Museum engaged in re-
search. Realizing that the Museum has need for such material and
has facilities for keeping it in ready-reference form, a number of per-
sons and organizations have transferred reference items to this Mu-
seum. Appreciation is expressed to the following:

Report on the National Zoological Park

Str: Transmitted herewith is a report on the operations of the Na-
tional Zoological Park for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1956.

In all, 742 accessions, comprising 1,710 individual animals, were
added to the collection during the year by gifts, deposits, purchases,
exchanges, births, and hatchings. Among these were many rare speci-
mens never before shown in this Zoo. The addition of new kinds of
animals enhances the value of the collection, which is maintained not
only for exhibition but also for research and education. Opportunities
for research are afforded students of biology, particularly vertebrate
zoology, as well as artists, photographers, and writers. Methods of
study that do not endanger the welfare of animals or the safety of
the public are encouraged.

In addition to the regular diversified activities of carrying on all
the operations of the Zoo, the services of the staff included answering
in person or by phone, mail, or telegraph questions regarding animals
and their care and transportation; furnishing to other Zoos and other
agencies, public and private, information regarding structures for
housing animals; cooperating with other agencies of Federal, State,
and municipal governments in research work; and preparing manu-
scripts for publication.

The stone restaurant building, which was constructed in the Park
in 1940, is leased at $34,452 a year. This money is deposited to the
credit of the Collector of Taxes, District of Columbia.

Elton Howe, for many years a watch and clock repairman in
Washington but now associated with the Diamond Ordnance Labora-
tory at the U. S. Bureau of Standards, generously presented to the
Zoo the 4-faced, 8-day clock that had stood at F Street near Thirteenth
since 1922. Mr. Howe put the clock in first-class condition when it was
installed, and plans to maintain it in running order as long as he can
do so. It has been set up at the intersection of the concourse on the
main road through the park, and was started on Monday, June 4, 1956.

FINANCES

The regular appropriation for the fiscal year was $669,300, which
is carried in the District of Columbia Appropriation Act. This
amount was supplemented by $21,600, which was transferred to the
appropriation in accordance with Public Law 94, to cover pay increases

117
118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

made necessary by the Federal Employees’ Salary Increase Act of
1955, approved June 28, 1955.

THE EXHIBITS

Animals for exhibition are acquired by gift, deposit, purchase, ex-
change, birth, and hatching, and are removed by death, exchange, or
return of those on deposit. Although depositors are at liberty to
remove their specimens, many leave them permanently.

As in any colony of living things, there is a steady turnover, and the
exhibits are constantly changing. Thus, the inventory of specimens
in the collection on June 30 of each year does not show all the kinds
of animals that were exhibited during the year, for sometimes
creatures of outstanding interest at the time they were shown are no
longer in the collection at the time the inventory is made.

The United States National Museum is given first choice of all ani-
mals that die in the Zoo. If they are not desired for the Museum they
are then made available to other institutions or scientific workers.
Thus the value of the specimen continues long after it is dead.

The two pairs of young giraffes and the pair of young gaurs, as well
as other animals brought to the Zoo in 1987 by the National Geographic
Society—Smithsonian Institution Expedition, have bred so successfully
that the Zoo has been able to dispose of surplus stock having a total
exchange value greater than the entire cost of the trip. Such animals
are exchanged with other zoos and with animal dealers for specimens
that are needed for this collection.

ACCESSIONS

The Zoo is particularly fortunate in having friends who show their
sincere interest by bringing in specimens or arranging for acquisitions
from foreign countries.

To obtain suitable animals for exhibition extensive correspondence
throughout the world and a great number of personal contacts are
maintained. As a result it is frequently possible to obtain animals
that are not ordinarily available through animal dealers. Some of
these are gifts and some are obtained by purchase.

OUTSTANDING ACQUISITIONS

“Wirsts” and rarities are always welcomed, and the Zoo acquired
a gratifying number of such specimens during the year.

For the first time this Zoo has a pair of European bison, or wisents
(Bison bonasus), which are the European counterparts of the Amer-
ican bison. Wisents are extinct in the wild, but a few have survived
in captivity or in forest preserves in spite of wars in Europe.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 119

After trying for several years the National Geographic Society
procured for the Zoo a specimen of the very rare dwarf armadillo
(Burmeisterta retusa) of the Bolivian region of South America.
It was obtained by W. Frerking, a National Geographic Society
correspondent keenly interested in the undertaking, and was flown
from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, by the Pan American and National Air
Lines without cost. It arrived in perfect condition, and while not a
showy exhibition animal it is remarkable in form and appearance,
and its great rarity makes it an outstanding “first” for this Zoo. It
may be the first to be alive in the United States. It is about 7 inches
long. The pink color of the body shows through the shell, there is a
fringe of white hairs around the edge of the shell, and the hair of the
underparts is white. The feet are pink and the front feet have very
large claws for digging.

Lt. Col. Robert Traub, of the Army Medical Research Unit, who is
now stationed at Kuala Lumpur, Malaya, again generously offered
the Zoo a considerable assortment of animals, from which a few were
selected. The most outstanding specimen was a linsang (Prionodon
linsang) which unfortunately died only a few hours before reaching
Washington. It is very rare in the wild and is not known to have been
in captivity before.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, through the kindly interest of
Donald L. Spencer in Alaska and William Tierre in Washington,
made a noteworthy contribution of an Alaskan brown bear (Ursus
sp.)—a female cub born about February 1955.

The Army Medical School gave the Zoo seven chimpanzees of ex-
hibition quality.

The National Geographic Society, through Gilbert G. La Gorce,
presented two beavers (Castor canadensis), the first the Zoo has had
for some time.

Twenty specimens of a medium-size African galago (@alago sene-
galensis) were turned over to the Zoo by the Army Medical School
of Walter Reed Hospital, through Dr. J. A. Morris, after they had
served their purpose with the Medical Corps. They were in good
condition and are useful for both exhibition and exchange.

The Army Medical School also gave three Mongolian gerbils
(Meriones unguiculatus), which are sufficiently active during the day
to be good exhibition animals. This species was on exhibition only
once before.

Two interesting African small mammals, a rock rat (Aethomys
kaisert) and a kusu rat (Arvicanthus niloticus), were sent by Dr.
Lawrence Kilham of the National Institutes of Health while he was
engaged in research work at Entebbe, Uganda. These small mammals

412575—57——_9
120 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

have considerable external resemblance to some of the ratlike creatures
of North America and are interesting for exhibition.

A Himalayan snow cock (Tetraogallus h. himalayensis) was given
the Zoo by the Fish and Wildlife Service through Gardner Bump,
who was then in Pakistan, and F. C. Lincoln of the Washington
office. This is the first bird of this kind exhibited here. It is about the
size and form of a domestic chicken.

The Fish and Wildlife Service also presented the first specimens
of the sand grouse (Pterocles orientalis) the Zoo has ever had.

Two kea parrots (Westor notabilis), gifts from the New Zealand
Government, were brought north for the Zoo by the Naval Antarctic
Expedition. These birds were at one time threatened with extinction
and are now rigidly protected. They have been successfully exhibited
here for many years, but these two additional specimens are most
welcome.

Three emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) were brought to
the Zoo by Malcolm Davis of the Zoo staff, who accompanied the
Antarctic Expedition known as Task Force 48. He also brought back
six parasitic gulls known as skuas (Catharacta maccormicki). The
penguins died of aspergillosis within a few days.

From Dr. Juan Rivero, of the University of Puerto Rico, came three
different species of the beautiful little green anolis of Puerto Rico.

The following were obtained by purchase:

An olingo, or bassaricyon (Bassaricyon gabbi), from the Leticia
region of Colombia. For many years this rare animal has been sought
in Central America and northern South America. It is a relative of
the raccoons and kinkajous and bears considerable resemblance to
the latter, but its ears are larger, its tail is not prehensile, and its
movements suggest that it is probably more terrestrial than the kinka-
jou. Only a few specimens of this genus are known from widely
scattered locations in Central America and northern South America.
This is the first one of its kind exhibited in the Zoo and probably the
first to be alive in the United States.

Two young Sumatran orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), which had
been deposited in the Zoo by Mr. and Mrs. Carl Krummel of Bal-
timore, Md.

A male, a female, and a young Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica).

Fine specimens of male and female gelada baboons (7'heropithecus
gelada), the first the Zoo has had for several years. They are rare in
the wild and are noteworthy among the primates in having a naked
area on their red chest; in the female this area is bordered by a row
of tubercles on the skin more than one-eighth of an inch in diameter,
giving the impression that she wears a pink pearl necklace. The
single species of this interesting genus inhabits the mountainous parts
of Abyssinia.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 1 Pal

A South American tapir (Yapirus terrestris), which gives the Zoo
a pair of these river and swamp animals.

A pair of rib-faced deer, or muntjaks (M/untiacus muntjak).

A pair of beautiful young tamandua anteaters (Zamandua
tetradactyla).

Two African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus). The Zoo had some of these
animals several years ago, but they are not common in captivity.

Two black jacanas (Jacana spinosa hypomelaena). These tiny rela-
tives of the rails have extremely long slender toes and long legs,
and are well adapted to running on vegetation floating on the surface
of tropical streams and ponds. They are the first the Zoo has
exhibited.

A beautiful white-and-gray Guianan crested eagle (Morphnus
guianensis) from the Leticia region of Colombia. The species ranges
from Honduras and Costa Rica south to Argentina and Bolivia but
is scarce throughout its range and very rare in captivity.

Two Inca terns (Larosterna inca), inhabitants of the coast of Peru
and Chile. These are the first that have been exhibited here and are
attractive additions to the bird house.

Two whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus), inhabitants of Europe and
Asia, but now rare.

A fine specimen of the comb duck (Sarkidiornis melanota), which
inhabits most of Africa and southern Asia.

A specimen of an interesting Manduit’s hawk-eagle (Spizaetus
ornatus) .

Surinam toads (Pipa pipa). These are the first of these very in-
teresting creatures the Zoo has had for some time. They are remark-
able for their method of reproduction—the male embeds the eggs in
the soft spongy skin of the back of the female, where they go through
the tadpole stage and emerge as little frogs.

A parrot snake (Leptophis occidentalis) , from the Leticia region of
Colombia.

During the year contact was reestablished with a collector, J. D.
Handman, in Africa, who has sent several shipments of reptiles.
Among the more interesting ones were flap-necked chameleons (Cha-
maeleon dilepis), striped sand snakes (Psammophis subtaeniatus) ,
sharp-nosed snakes (Rhamphiophis rostratus), Egyptian cobras
(Naja haje), African black cobras (Naja melanoleuca), boomslangs
(Dispholidus typus), African house snakes (Boaedon lineatum), and
plated lizards (Gerrhosaurus major).

Several specimens of the Amazon spotted turtle (Podocnemis uni-
filis). Heretofore these turtles have been very rare in collections, but
apparently the area in which they may be common is now being
explored for animals.
122 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

By exchange with the Philadelphia Zoological Society a specimen
of the Cape Barren goose (Cereopsis novaehollandiae) was acquired.
A small but interesting collection of lizards and scorpions from
the Florida Keys was obtained by exchange from Mr. and Mrs. Louis
H. Babbitt.
DEPOSITS

This year, as in many years past, various individuals have depos-
ited in the Zoo animals to which they desired to retain title. These
are most acceptable additions to the exhibits. Depositors are assured
that the animals will receive routine care, but the Zoo assumes no
responsibility and no obligation to replace any that do not survive.
The following animals were on deposit during the year:

A young red ukari (Cacajao rubicundus), deposited by William
Schwartz. Ukaris are unusual in collections because they do not thrive
in captivity, but because of the special care given this specimen it gives
promise of surviving.

A number of active young chimpanzees, on deposit from the Army
Medical Corps and the Johns Hopkins Medical School. They are
kept here until they are needed for research work by the respective
institutions. Most of them suffer no greater indignity or discomfort
than having a small amount of their blood taken for testing in a
medical laboratory. They provide one of the most interesting and
active exhibits.

Two specimens of Branick’s paca (Dinomys branickii) on deposit
for three days. They are South American rodents that are very rare,
but the Zoo had had specimens of them on two previous occasions.

Some chukar quails (Alectornia graeca), deposited by the Pakistan
Embassy.

Ten different species of unusually attractive finches that were living
together, deposited by Dean Stambaugh, St. Albans School, Wash-
ington, D. C.

An interesting collection of Cuban reptiles, deposited by David
Hardy of Baltimore, Md.

A specimen of the Murray turtle (Zmydura macquarie), depos-
ited by Donald Pumphrey.

BIRTHS AND HATCHINGS

Conditions under which animals are kept on exhibition are usually

not favorable for breeding or raising young.

However, occasionally

young are born or hatched that are of unusual interest to the public

and are valuable as additions to the group or for exchange.

Out-

standing among the births at the Zoo were the following:

The herd of Nubian giraffes (Girajffa camelopardalis) again pro-
duced young, thus providing valuable exchange specimens.

The pygmy hippos (Choeropsis liberiensis) continue to produce
young, the eighteenth having been born during the fiscal year.

The water civets (Atilaw paludinosus), African relatives of the
mongoose, continue to produce young.

The colony of rather attractive slender-tailed cloud rats (Phloeomys

130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

The African porcupines (Hystria galeata) continue to increase.

The crested screamers (Chauna torquata) again laid eggs and
hatched three young, but they did not survive.

Through the painstaking care of Mario De Prato, principal keeper
of the reptile house, reproduction among reptiles has been very
gratifying. The most outstanding of these follow:

Eggs were laid by the flap-neck chameleon (Chamaeleon dilepis)
on April 2, 1955, and 6 hatched on June 23. In spite of the utmost
efforts the young refused to eat and so survived only a few days.

A three-horned chamelon (Chamaeleon jacksoni) gave birth to 16
young on January 9, 1956.

The five-lined skinks hatched six eggs August 11, 1955.

Fourteen young green water snakes (atria cyclopion) were born
June 3, 1955. One egg of an indigo snake (Drymarchon corais
coupert) was hatched, and 10 red-bellied water snakes (Natrix ery-
throgaster) were born.

An African house snake, or musaga (Boaedon lineatum), laid 21
eggs, and 7 of these hatched on December 11. These may be the first
of their kind to have been hatched in captivity.

An Egyptian cobra (Waja haje) laid 19 eggs on November 4, 1955.
On January 31, 1956, 3 of them hatched. Only one of the young
could be induced to eat freely. It thrived on baby mice. This was
the second time cobra eggs were hatched in the Zoo.

Eight rainbow boas (/'picrates cenchria) were born on March 12,
1956.

Following is a complete list of the births and hatchings:

high-stepping dance, with appropriate wing movements, on June 26,
132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

1956, the 50th anniversary of its arrival in the National Zoological
Park as a full-grown bird. This is a noteworthy longevity record,
and apparently the bird is in such condition that it should live consid-
erably longer.

RESEARCH

The National Zoological Park has no general research program, as
such. However, the successful keeping of any animal involves more or
less specific research. If the habits and requirements of a species in
captivity are not well known, they must be ascertained through
research, which may have to be carried out with all possible speed if a
newly received animal is to survive. The problems involved may con-
cern any or all of the following: Temperament of the animal; its need
for exercise and for companionship; diseases and external and internal
parasites to which it is subject; food preferences; housing, tempera-
ture, ventilation, and bedding.

If it is known in advance that a new animal is to be received, infor-
mation is sought from every possible source regarding its probable
requirements. Upon its arrival its age and physical condition are
noted, and any tentative plans for its care are modified or elaborated
as circumstances dictate. External injuries, if any, are treated, and
efforts are made to rid the animal of external parasites. Internal
parasites are watched for, and treatment to eliminate them is under-
taken. Observations on the animal are continued and changes are
made in its environment if necessary. If it refuses to eat, new foods are
offered and its preferences are noted.

The relatively low mortality rate among newly received animals and
the general good health of those in the collection attest the success of
the research that is carried on.

In addition to the problems concerned directly with the animals,
there are many others that involve research. One relates to the types of
construction materials most suitable for the housing and exhibition of
the animals and most economical to maintain. This calls for constant
study of various types of flooring, bars, wire fabrics, cage partitions,
doors, locks, and numerous other materials. Much research has also
been done on paints, and over a period of more than 25 years the Zoo has
tried many different kinds and has generally been among the first to
make use of new paints when they are suitable.

Another problem concerns the acquisition of ornamental plants and
shrubs for the Park. Some that might be entirely suitable from an
esthetic standpoint cannot be utilized for reasons peculiar to the Zoo.

Incidental research carried on by Ernest P. Walker, Assistant
Director, mainly in his home and on his own time, has concerned the
care of small animals about which little is known and which in many
cases had not been kept successfully in captivity. Outstanding among
SECRETARY’S REPORT 133

these were several different kinds of bats, African elephant shrews,
and North American shrews. His success he attributes largely to the
food formula? he developed, which is relished not only by these ani-
mals, but by many others.

Army medical research workers interested in the raising of tree
shrews because of their possible value as laboratory animals have been
impressed by Mr. Walker’s success with the other types of shrews and
have brought tree shrews to the Zoo. Given this food, the shrews
thrived on it and produced four litters of young. Indeed, the results
were so promising that the food has been canned in small quantities by
the National Canners Association, and two lots of it have been shipped
to Malay and Borneo by the Army medical workers. Also, a small
amount was recently taken to Mexico by Mr. Walker and turned over
to the Pan American Sanitary Bureau, which requested this material
for feeding bats they are studying in connection with research work
on rabies.

Information supplied in response to the many requests received
by mail, telephone, and from visitors is based on research by this Zoo,
or has been assembled from various sources, and in many instances
serves to facilitate scientific investigations that are being carried on
by other Federal or State institutions. Occasionally animals are de-
posited with the Zoo by research institutions until they are needed for
experimental purposes. Here they are cared for and are available to
the depositors when desired. The facilities thus provided contribute
indirectly to the research work of other organizations.

VETERINARIAN

For the first time since 1942 the National Zoological Park has a
veterinarian—Dr. Theodore H. Reed, appointed July 15, 1955. The
work of the veterinarian is threefold : to establish such a sound disease-
preventive program through nutrition, sanitation, parasite control,

* Ingredients: Yolk of 1 hard-boiled egg; approximately an equal amount of
rather dry cottage cheese; approximately an equal amount of ripe banana;
approximately an equal amount of mealworms; 6 drops of Jeculin; 6 drops of
wheat-germ oil; 3 grains of Theragram.

Mix with a mortar and pestle. If the wheat-germ oil is in 3-minim capsules,
put in two; also add the Theragram, which is a yellowish paste. Add afew drops
of water to soften the gelatin of the wheat-germ oil capsules and to dissolve the
Theragram. Then put the other ingredients in and grind all together with the
pestle until a paste is formed with the chitin of the worms scattered through it.

The mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) are the same or similar to those that get
into cereals. Cultures of them can be maintained in bran or cornmeal with the
addition of banana peelings, slices of raw potato, and occasionally light sprin-
klings of water to moisten the bran or cornmeal very slightly but not enough
to cause it to form lumps or to mildew.
134 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

laboratory examination, and environmental changes that the need for
treatment and surgery is reduced to a minimum; to treat diseased and
injured animals as necessary ; and to carry on research looking toward
better remedies and better health for the animals in captivity.

Changes in and additions to more than 92 of the diets have been
made, and benefits are beginning to be evident. Two second-genera-
tion hybrid bear cubs now 6 months old were raised on synthetic
bitches’ milk and are developing normally. The two young gorillas
continue to thrive. Nikumba, the male, weighed 17 pounds on arrival
at 15 months of age, and Moka, the female, weighed 20 pounds. Their
combined weight is now 100 pounds, the male being the heavier. Dr.
Joseph Watson, a private physician, is consultant pediatrician for
both the gorillas and orangutans.

A systematic parasite survey has been started, and treatment is
given where necessary. The new anthelmintic piprizine sulfate has
been used for roundworms with good results. It has the advantage
of being highly effective, relatively palatable and nontoxic. A satis-
factory method of treating reptiles for internal parasites is being
sought, and results so far are promising.

During the year 20 minor surgical cases were treated. The three
major operations were the removal of a fibroma between the two
lower canine teeth of a 19-year-old Bengal tiger, the reduction of an
umbilical hernia on a young male chimpanzee, and the removal of a
large mass (14 pint) of tapeworm cysts from the hind leg of a
De Brazza’s guenon. Lt. R. M. McCully, United States Air Force
(Veterinarian Corps), was the chief surgeon. Two unusual surgical
procedures were the removal of a marble-sized tumor from an African
lungfish and the extraction of an impacted tooth from an 18-foot
anaconda.

Treatment of infectious conditions has been as successful as could be
expected considering the difficulty in handling some of the patients.
Tn all, 119 mammals, 17 reptiles, and 25 birds were under treatment.

Every death that occurs at the Zoo is listed. When an animal dies
every effort is made to determine the cause of death, and to profit
from the findings.

The three emperor penguins received May 1, 1956, arrived infected
with aspergillosis. Treatment with Mycostatin (Squibb) and Alivar
(Winthrop) by inhalation with a DeVilbis nebulizer was immediately
started. One penguin died within 12 hours; the other two survived 5
days. The pathological reports on the two that died last showed
that the mold was not sporulating, indicating that an early treatment
against the disease would have been effective had there been oppor-
tunity.

Assistance in post-mortem procedures and all histopathologic exam-
inations were given by Drs. Eyestone and Lombard, National In-

are only a few in captivity. This picture shows the high, narrow form characteristic
of the animal. They are much less massive than the American bison. ‘The photograph

IMPROVEMENTS AND MAINTENANCE

The new building containing restrooms, headquarters for the police,
and office and storage space for the gardener, which was opened to
the public March 15, 1956, was designed by the Department of Build-
ings and Grounds of the Government of the District of Columbia in
accordance with provisions of law. The $197,000 appropriated for the
structure was carried in the District of Columbia Public Works Appro-
priation for 1955. With the small unexpended balance of the appro-
priation a driveway and a loading platform at the storeroom in the
basement of the building are to be constructed.

The routine work of maintenance and construction, which is carried
on practically every day of the year, consists of such varied tasks as
the removal of stoppages from drains and sewers, repairs of faucets,
doors, cages, water lines, steam lines, boilers, refrigeration equipment,
buildings, roads, and walks, and innumerable miscellaneous jobs nec-
essary to keep the National Zoological Park in a safe and presentable
condition. The need for the exercise of great care in working around
animals requires that practically all this kind of work be done by the
Zoo’s own specially trained workmen, who must not only perform
mechanical work but also cooperate with the keeper force so that
nothing is done that will injure the animals, the public, or themselves.

All designing, construction, repair, and maintenance work done in
the Park during the year were performed by the Zoo’s mechanical
department; but because of inadequate funds this work was limited to
that most urgently needed. It has been impossible to keep pace with
the deterioration of the old structures that require extensive repairs,
and some of them have had to be abandoned. The mechanical shops
designed and built new metal skylights for several animal houses. Ex-
tensive repairs were necessary to some of the stone buildings con-
structed during WPA days about 20 years ago.

Over a period of years there has been a gradual increase in the
amount of trimming of trees necessary along the roads, walks, and
paths, and in the exhibition area. Because of disease or age, some
of the trees are dying and must be cut down. Others must be trimmed
to remove dead or broken limbs that might fall and injure persons or
animals, or damage automobiles or structures.

The job of cleaning up the grounds is a major undertaking. Using
all available manpower, it usually takes 5 to 10 days to pick up the
trash and restore the park to a fair degree of presentability after
Easter Sunday and Monday. This work has of necessity been reduced
to a minimum. The lawns, shrubs, and trees cannot be kept in as

412575—57——__10
136 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

attractive condition as they might be because of lack of maintenance
funds. However, curtailment of this work results in less harm than
does the neglect of structures and fences.

From time to time during the year earth has been received for the
fill across the road from the large-mammal house. After the fill is
completed a sidewalk will be laid on that side of the road, providing
a greater measure of safety for the public. Until the fill settles, the
area will be used for a car-parking site, and later paddocks will be
placed on it.

The accessibility of the police headquarters in the new building has
so greatly increased the demands upon the police for first aid, in-
formation, and general assistance that it has been necessary to take
two men off patrol to maintain the service in the office. This leaves
the regular patrol force shorthanded, even with the temporary part-
time policemen that have been employed.

In addition to routine maintenance considerable reconstruction, as
well as new construction, is necessary to meet the requirements of ani-
mals or changed conditions. For example, with the prospect of
obtaining more penguins from the Navy Antarctic Expedition, ex-
tensive work was done on the penguin room with a view to filtering
the air to remove practically all air-borne germs and spores, maintain-
ing slightly lower temperatures, providing chilled water for the
swimming pool and for hosing down the cage. As the cooling system
has been in use for 20 years and it is uncertain how much longer it will
continue to function, an additional cooling unit for the cage was in-
stalled. This will be used when the old system fails or must be
repaired.

The two young gorillas that were given the Zoo by Russell Arundel
in 1955 have outgrown two cages, and a third had to be built. This
involved not only building a new wall in the great apes room in the
small-mammal house, but the construction of a retirement cage and the
laying of a new floor. Also, a new thermostat was installed to provide
better control of the temperature in this room for the gorillas.

With the appointment of a veterinarian it became necessary to pro-
vide an office for him and a hospital for the animals. An old stone
building is being adapted for the purpose and a beginning made to
equip it for surgery, treatment, and laboratory work. This has re-
quired installation of a new heating plant, remodeling of cages, and
painting the inside of the building.

VISITORS

Attendance at the Zoo this year reached a total of 3,788,229, an all-
time high record. In general this figure is based on estimated rather
than on actual counts, but the following actual counts made by mem-
bers of the police force on certain days are of interest: Reptile house,

About 2 p. m. each day the cars then parked in the Zoo are counted
and listed according to the State, Territory, or country from which
they came. This is, of course, not a census of the cars coming to
the Zoo, but is valuable in showing the percentage of attendance, by
States, of people in private automobiles. Many District of Columbia,
Maryland, and Virginia cars come to the Zoo to bring guests from
other States. The tabulation for the fiscal year 1955 is as follows:

The remaining 8.1 percent came from Alaska, Austria, British
Columbia, Canada, Canal Zone, Costa Rica, England, France,
Germany, Hawaii, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Newfoundland, Philippine
Islands, and Puerto Rico.

On the days of even small attendance there are cars parked in the
Zoo from at least 15 States, Territories, District of Columbia, and
foreign countries. On average days there are cars from about 22
States, Territories, the District of Columbia, and foreign countries;
and during the periods of greatest attendance the cars represent not
less than 34 different States, Territories, and countries.

Parking spaces in the Zoo now accommodate 1,079 cars when the bus
parking place is utilized, and 969 cars when it is not used.

COOPERATION

At all times special efforts are made to maintain friendly contacts
with other Government and State agencies, private concerns and
individuals, and scientific workers for mutual assistance. As a result
the Zoo receives much help and advice and many valuable specimens,
and in turn it furnishes information and, whenever possible, specimens
it does not need.

Special acknowledgment is due the United States Dispatch Agent
in New York City, Howard Fyfe, an officer of the State Department,
who has frequently been called upon to clear shipments of animals
coming from abroad. This he has done, often at great personal in-
convenience, and the animals have been forwarded to Washington
without the loss of a single specimen.

U. S. Marshal Carlton G. Beall turned over to the Zoo 50 bags of
rice and 200 pounds of poultry that had been condemned by the court.
The National Institutes of Health, the Army Medical Center, the Navy
Medical Center, and the Nutritional Laboratory of the Department of
Agriculture gave the Zoo mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and other
animals no longer suitable for their purposes. These are valuable
foods for many animals. The poultry division of the Department of
Agriculture gave a considerable number of day-old chicks that were
hatched in connection with certain of its experiments. These are a
highly desirable addition to the diet of many animals. The Fish and
Wildlife Service also gave some young chicks.

Dr. John C. Pearson, of the Fish and Wildlife Service’s aquarium,
in the Commerce Building, has traded specimens and given much
valuable assistance and advice.

Samuel M. Poiley, associate chief of the animal production section,
National Institutes of Health, continued to supply surplus laboratory
animals, some of which were desirable additions to the exhibition
collection.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 139

C. W. Phillips and P. R. Achenbach of the National Bureau of
Standards and R. W. Seiders of the General Services Administration
gave the Zoo valuable advice in connection with many of the problems
incidental to improving conditions in the penguin cage.

The National Institutes of Health, the Armed Forces Institute of
Pathology, the Johns Hopkins Medical School, and the Neurophys-
iology section of Walter Reed Medical School have given valuable
assistance and advice in the treatment and handling of animals. The
zoological division of the U. S. Department of Agriculture Research
Center, Beltsville, Md., continued to identify parasites found on the
animals.

Dr. Charles G. Curbin, associate veterinarian, medical division, bu-
reau of medicine, Food and Drug Administration, has supplied the
Zoo with surplus medicines, and the following commercial firms have
been extremely kind in furnishing drugs for use and for clinical] trials:

Lederle Laboratories.

Schenley Laboratory, Inc. (pharmaceutical division).

E. R. Squibb & Sons.
Upjohn Co.
Wyeth Laboratories.

The DeVilbiss Co. lent equipment for experimental purposes.

At the request of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau, a branch of
the World Health Organization, Ernest P. Walker, Assistant Direc-
tor of the Zoo, went to Mexico to photograph bats. Mr. Walker has
specialized in the photographing of mammals and has taken many pic-
tures of bats, both fiying and at rest. Certain species in Central and
South America have been found to be involved in the spread of rabies.
There have been no satisfactory photographs or drawings that could
be used by public health workers and others to determine and demon-
strate the kind of bats that they might be studying or discussing.
Therefore, they desired photographs that could be used in this work.
Mr. Walker left Washington October 31 and returned December 22.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

Because of the natural deterioration of structures and equipment,
and rising costs, the need for more funds for maintenance, repair, and
improvements becomes more critical every year. The newest of the
exhibition buildings are 19 years old, the reptile house is 25 years old,
and the bird house is 28 years old. These and the buildings and other
structures that were erected during the depression days now require
a constantly increasing amount of repairs. It has recently been neces-
sary to abandon 10 enclosures that have deteriorated to such an extent
that they can no longer be repaired. Large areas of the grounds
have had to be neglected entirely, or given scant care, in order that
140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

the meager funds available may be used to maintain the areas most
used by the public.

Additional funds are most urgently needed for personnel, mainte-
nance, installations, and the following construction:

Buildings:

A new administration building to replace the 151-year-old historic
landmark that is still in use as an office building but that is neither
suitably located nor well adapted for the purpose.

A building to house antelopes and other hoofed animals that require
a heated building.

A fireproof service building for receiving animals shipped in, quar-
antining them, and caring for those in ill health or those that cannot
be placed on exhibition.

Enclosures :
Enclosures and pools for beavers, otters, seals, and nutrias, which
cannot be adequately cared for or exhibited under existing conditions.
New paddocks for the exhibition of such animals as deer, sheep,
goats, and other hoofed animals, to provide for the exhibition of a
greater assortment of these attractive and valuable animals,

Installations:

A new ventilation system for the bird house.

A vacuum pump to provide more efficient and economical operation
of the heating system in the reptile house.

An air compressor for general use about the park, particularly for
freeing sewers of stoppages, operating air hammers, blowing out
boiler tubes, and for use in excavation and construction work.

Additional parking space to be developed on about 14,000 square
yards of land in several different locations, mainly near the creek.

An additional coal bunker for storage of a reserve supply of coal.

Personnel and maintenance:

1 assistant director. The steadily increasing popularity of the Zoo
as a source of both entertainment and education has developed such
a volume of requests for information that there is now need for an
additional scientist to share the load of answering queries and to as-
sist in other administrative work so that the Director and Assistant
Director can devote more time to general supervision of the Zoo.

1 general mechanic to assist the maintenance personnel in what has
hitherto been a losing race in trying to keep pace with natural deterio-
ration in the structures.

6 laborers for the mechanical force to replace 6 who were reallo-
cated by the Wage Board to the position of truck drivers, thus cutting
the laborer force from 13 to 7—a number way below the minimum
SECRETARY’S REPORT 141

necessary to carry on even the most urgently needed work that must
be done in the Zoo every day in the year.

1 gardener (foreman) and 1 laborer for the gardener’s crew for
proper maintenance of the grounds, removal of dead or fallen tree
limbs and other safety hazards.

2 attendants for the public restrooms to maintain these rooms in a
clean and sanitary condition and to prevent vandalism.

2 policemen to serve as station clerks in the new police headquarters.

3 property and supply clerks to comply with the requirements of
keeping property and inventory records, in accordance with the pro-
gram laid down by the General Services Administration.

?The Zoo is given many small creatures that have been pets in homes where
they are no longer welcome, or where circumstances necessitate giving them up.
These include ducks, chickens, and rabbits given to children at Easter time,
parakeets, alligators, caimans, guinea-pigs, etc. Also many of the common local
wild things that are found by children or adults who think the creatures need
help are brought to the Zoo. This includes a wide array, but particularly gray
squirrels, cottontail rabbits, opossums, skunks, raccoons, foxes, woodchucks,
blue jays, robins, sparrows, box turtles, as well as other less plentiful forms.
The quantity of these received far exceeds the need for exhibition animals and
facilities to care for them; therefore, some are used in exchange for other
animals that are needed, and some are liberated. During the past year there
were 215 individuals of 19 different kinds of such unneeded animals brought in.
These were accessioned and therefore are recorded, which accounts in part for
the large number of removals listed.

Report on the Canal Zone Biological Area

Sir: It gives me pleasure to present herewith the annual report
on the Canal Zone Biological Area for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1956. The principal portion of this report was prepared by James
Zetek, who retired from the position of resident manager of this
bureau on May 30, 1956. Mr. Zetek has been succeeded by Dr. Carl
B. Koford who assumed his duties as resident naturalist on June 380,
1956.

SCIENTISTS AND THEIR STUDIES

During the fiscal year 51 scientists, not including the Corrosion
Conference group, came to the laboratory. Some of these, such as
the research team from the University of Oslo, stayed for extended
periods. In addition, there were many scientists who wanted to “get
acquainted” with the island and had scheduled a one-day stopover

to inspect the laboratory and the forest area.

VISITORS

The visitors who spent at least a day on Barro Colorado Island *
this year totaled 440. The majority of these were local people, but
there were some who came by plane or boat to the mainland and had
included a side trip to the laboratory in their plans. As in other years,
all appeared to be very enthusiastic, and many expressed the wish
that they could stay longer or return again at some later time.

RAINFALL

In 1955, during the dry season (January through April) rains of
0.01 inch or more fell on 44 of the 120 days (128 hours) and amounted
to 10.78 inches, as compared to 5.84 inches during 1954.

During the wet season of 1955 (May through December) rains of
0.01 inch or more fell on 202 of the 245 days and amounted to 103.64
inches as compared to 99.85 inches during 1954.

During 1955 rain fell on 246 days (975 hours), and averaged only
0.45 inch per day, almost 0.12 inch per hour.

March was the driest month of 1955 (0.21 inch) and November the
wettest (17.14 inches). The wettest year of record (31 years) was

1935 with 143.42 inches, and the driest year of record was 1930 with
only 76.57 inches.

The maxima of record for short periods were 5 minutes 1.30 inches;

BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT, AND IMPROVEMENTS

When the new laboratory building was constructed, the contractor
could not obtain United States lumber for the flooring, and lumber
cut and milled in Chiriqui, Panama, had to be used. During the year
dry-wood termite infestation was observed, and though the damage was
not extensive and appeared to be spreading slowly, immediate steps
were undertaken to correct this condition. All the floor paint was
scraped off and two very liberal brushings of Penta W-R were ap-
plied and allowed to soak in thoroughly. Since this treatment was
given, no further signs of termite activity have been seen.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 165

Water and electrical installations in this new building were com-
pleted, and the large darkroom is almost finished. It is expected that
the building will soon be used to its full capacity and effectiveness.

All the screening on the original large laboratory was replaced with
plastic screening, as expert advice had indicated this type was ex-
ceptionally good. Unfortunately, experience did not bear out that
recommendation as rats ate the plastic with gusto, and cigarettes
which accidently came into contact with the screen caused holes to
develop immediately. It is planned to replace all the plastic screen-
ing with the aluminum type.

Some of the lumber and other materials needed for rebuilding and
repairing the laborers’ quarters were purchased. This project in-
cludes the installation of indoor toilet facilities, a luxury to the labor-
ers, but an added health protection factor on the island.

The roof of the Haskins Library Building appeared to be in poor
condition, but a careful examination revealed that the damage was
superficial, and the only repair needed was scraping and painting the
existing covering. These projects were carried out thoroughly, and
the roof is now in excellent condition. The runoff from the roof of
this building is not used as a means of water supply, and so painting
it presents no problem in this respect.

The new electric water heater furnishes hot water for the kitchen
and shower baths and is proving to be a valuable addition. Though
hot water cannot be used too freely when a large number of scientists
are on the island, it has been a welcome convenience for all.

The 110-120-volt, 60-cycle, overhead electrical installation, com-
pleted in 1955, is giving satisfactory service. Excellent arrangements
were made during the year for the maintenance and repair of the Diesel
generators. A Caterpillar generator was obtained on transfer, and
when this third unit is installed it is expected that no interruptions
in the electric supply will be experienced.

Materials were purchased for building dry closets, electrically
heated, in the various buildings. Some dehumidifiers have been in-
stalled, and they are doing an excellent job of drawing incredible
amounts of water from each room.

The large wooden water tank north of the old laboratory was in
danger of collapsing, and so some temporary, emergency repairs had
to be made until the water-supply problem can be resolved. During
the year it was discovered that a spring on the Snyder-Molino trail may
bethe solution. Before this can be determined, possible contamination
from rain drainage during the wet season will have to be eliminated
in order to obtain a good sample of water for analysis.

Minor necessary repairs were made to the launch Afoon. Local reg-
ulations make it necessary to equip the speedboat with life preservers.
166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

Further safety measures were taken by obtaining spotlights for the
launch and by having all the fire extinguishers recharged by the Fire
Division.

The dock proper is joined to a large platform covered with corru-
gated roofing and used for storage purposes. A portion of the roofing
caved in because of rot-infested roof timbers. This damage was
quickly repaired, and the new lumber was treated with preservatives
to retard decay.

URGENT REQUIREMENTS

The most urgent requirement of the island, which has been referred
to in the preceding section, is a safe and permanent supply of drinking
water. This problem is expected to be resolved during the coming
fiscal year.

The island dock still presents a perennial problem, but funds have
been made available to provide for its relocation. Engineering studies
will be made to determine the most suitable location for rebuilding
the dock so that the silting of the channel will not present an annual
problem.

The construction of the dry rooms referred to earlier in this report
is urgently required so that scientists may store in safety such property
as suitcases, cameras and their carrying cases, winter clothing, and
shoes.

Since the termite infestation of the floor in the new building has
been eliminated, the floors must be repainted soon.

The engine and hoist, which provide the only means of lifting heavy
shipments of supplies and equipment from the dock to the laboratory
level, must be replaced as soon as possible. Though the existing equip-
ment has given many years of fine service, it is now worn out, break-
downs are frequent, and repairs are more and more difficult to make.

Only two of the trail-end houses, the Drayton and the Fuertes, are
in usable condition, the others being in a very bad state of disrepair
and so cannot be used.

Now that better facilities are available for preserving books, much
work has to be done on the existing library, such as the rebinding and
repair of old, valuable, and irreplaceable publications and the binding
of series of scientific journals. Essential scientific reference texts and
publications which are not included in the existing collection should
be procured. Provision must be made to accommodate library mate-
rial being transferred from the Balboa office to the island. Some of
this is property of the bureau, but a large portion of it represents the
personal collection of Mr. Zetek who has indicated that he plans to
donate these fine publications to the island library. His generosity
is greatly appreciated.

The laboratory in the new building and its related storerooms have
to be equipped and properly organized. Funds have been provided
SECRETARY'S REPORT 167

to obtain some of the required equipment and supplies, but more will
be required.

An annual requirement, and one which is always a pressing problem
in any tropical environment, is the constant need of painting all
exterior and interior surfaces regularly to prevent wood rot.

FINANCES

The following institutions again contributed their table subscrip-
tions, which were received with sincere appreciation inasmuch as
without them the uninterrupted operation of the laboratory could
not be accomplished :

Donations are also gratefully acknowledged from the following:
Eugene Eisenmann, C. M. Goethe, D. S. Lee, and Harry C. Nichols.

A concerted effort must soon be made to interest additional groups
in supporting atable subscription. Though the needs of the laboratory
are great, its improved facilities are such that any participating group
would find that an outlay of $300 or $400 would reap unforeseen
dividends in the form of sound tropical research accomplishments.

The rate for one-day visits to the island is $3 per person. Such
visitors are met by launch at Frijoles and taken to the island and back
again in time to board the evening train home. The fee also covers
the noon meal and a guided trip into the forest.

Scientists from institutions which contribute to the support of the
island through an annual table subscription are charged $4 per person
per day. For others the fee is $5 per person per day. These rates
provide for the two launch trips to and from the island, three con-
secutive meals, and lodging.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Thanks are due the Canal Zone Government, its executive secretary
and staff, the Customs and Immigration officials, the officials and
employees of the Panama Railroad, and also the Police Division, for
their excellent cooperation. The Panama Canal Company, particu-
larly Mr. P. Alton White, chief of the Dredging Division, and his
technical staff were also of great assistance.

Particular mention is made also of Dr. Cleveland C. Soper, director
of the Eastman Kodak Company’s Tropical Research Laboratory, and
his efficient technical and clerical staff who despite their heavy re-
search program found time to help with the problems of the CZBA,
especially when emergencies arose. Without such kind and unfailing
assistance the Area could not function as it does.

Special appreciation must be expressed for the constant cooperation
and efficiency of Mrs. Adela Gomez, particularly when Mr. Zetek was
hospitalized on February 23, 1956, and the burden of managing and
operating the bureau fell on her shoulders.

Report on the International Exchange
Service

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the International Exchange Service for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1956:

The Smithsonian Institution is the official United States agency
for the exchange with other nations of governmental, scientific, and
literary publications. The International Exchange Service, initiated
by the Smithsonian Institution in the early years of its existence for
the interchange of scientific publications between learned societies
and individuals in the United States and those of foreign countries,
serves as a means of developing and executing in part the broad and
comprehensive objective, “the diffusion of knowledge.” It was later
designated by the United States Government as the agency for the
transmission of official documents to selected depositories throughout
the world, and it continues to execute the exchanges pursuant to con-
ventions, treaties, and other international agreements.

The number of packages of publications received for transmission
during the year increased by 14,983 to the yearly total of 1,161,855
but the weight of the packages decreased by 9,904 to the yearly total
of 803,056 pounds. The average weight of the individual package
decreased to 11.14 ounces, as compared to the 11.34-ounce average for
the fiscal year of 1955.

The publications received from foreign sources for addressees in
the United States and from domestic sources for shipment abroad are
classified as shown in the following table:

The packages of publications are forwarded to the exchange bureaus
of foreign countries by freight or, where shipment by such means is

169
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1956

impractical, to the foreign addressees by direct mail. Distribution in
the United States of the publications received through the foreign ex-
change bureaus is accomplished primarily by mail, but by other means
when more economical. The number of boxes shipped to the foreign
exchange bureaus was 3,064, or 228 more than for the previous year. Of
these boxes 986 were for depositories of full sets of United States
Government documents, these publications being furnished in exchange
for the official publications of foreign governments which are received
for deposit in the Library of Congress. The number of packages for-
warded by mail and by means other than freight was 228,394.

There was allocated to the International Exchange Service for
transportation $45,040. With this amount it was possible to effect the
shipment of 837,188 pounds, which was 37,188 pounds more than was
shipped the previous year. However, approximately 11,000 pounds of
the full sets of United States Government documents accumulated
during the year because the Library of Congress had requested suspen-
sion of shipment to certain foreign depositories.

Ocean freight rates to the Mediterranean ports were increased by
10 percent in June and the freight rates to and from the New York
piers were increased by a 10-cent arbitrary in April.

The total outgoing correspondence was 2,497 letters, exclusive of
information copies.

With the exception of Taiwan, no shipments are being made to
China, North Korea, Outer Mongolia, Communist-controlled area of
Viet-Nam, Communist-controlled area of Laos, or the Haiphong En-
clave.

On May 14 the International Exchange Service received from the
Kast German Exchange Service a shipment of 179 packages. This was
the first shipment received from East Germany since 1939. On June 7
an announcement was received that another shipment containing 181
packages was in transit.

With certain exceptions the regulations of the Bureau of Foreign
Commerce, Department of Commerce, provide that each package of
publications exported bear a general license symbol and legend, “Ex-
port License Not Required.” The International Exchange Service
accepts for transmission to foreign destinations only those packages
of publications that fall within the exception and those packages of
publications to which the general license symbol and legend have been
applied by the consignor.
